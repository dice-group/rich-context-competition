Petty, MD; Eva Lydick, PhD\nBackground: Obstructive lung disease (OLD) is an im-\nportant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US adult\npopulation. Potentially treatable mild cases of OLD of-\nten go undetected. This analysis determines the na-\ntional estimates of reported OLD and low lung function\nin the US adult population.\nMethods: We examined data from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III),\na multistage probability representative sample of the US\npopulation. A total of 20050 US adults participated in\nsures were low lung function (a condition determined\nto be present if the forced expiratory volume in 1\nsecond\u00adforced vital capacity ratio was less than 0.7 and\nthe forced expiratory volume in 1 second was less than\n80% of the predicted value), a physician diagnosis of\nOLD (chronic bronchitis, asthma, or emphysema), and\nrespiratory symptoms.\nResults: Overall a mean (SE) of 6.8% (0.3%) of the popu-\nlation had low lung function, and 8.5% (0.3%) of the\npopulation reported OLD. Obstructive lung disease (age-\nadjusted to study population) was currently reported\nof former smokers, 3.1% (1.1%) of pipe or cigar smok-\ners, and 5.8% (0.4%) of never smokers. Surprisingly,\n63.3% (0.2%) of the subjects with documented low lung\nfunction had no prior or current reported diagnosis of\nany OLD.\nConclusions: This study demonstrates that OLD is pre-\nsent in a substantive number of US adults. In addition,\nmany US adults have low lung function but no reported\nOLD diagnosis, which may indicate the presence of un-\ndiagnosed lung disease.\neases (OLDs), which in-\nclude chronic bronchi-\ntis, emphysema, and\nasthma, are the fourth\nmost common cause of death in the United\nStates and accounted for more than\ndisease is the only major disease among\nthe top 5 causes of death that is rising in\nprevalence and mortality.2 It is now esti-\nmated that nearly 16 million people in the\nUnited States have chronic bronchitis and\nemphysema, which is commonly re-\nferred to as chronic obstructive pulmo-\nnary disease (COPD).3 Costs of hospital-\nizations, physician visits, and consumption\nof health care resources for COPD were\nasthma may affect as many as 14.6 mil-\nlion people in the United States3,5 with as-\nsociated direct medical costs of $6.0 bil-\nBecause of the increase in prevalence\nandmortalityofOLD,andthemedicalcosts\nassociatedwiththem,itisimportanttoiden-\ntify patients and to treat them before they\nreach the symptomatic and costly stages of\ndisease.TheLungHealthStudyshowedthat\nwhen patients with mild to moderate OLD\nquit smoking, their lung function declined\nonly slightly over the next 5 years.7 In con-\ntrast, similar patients who continued to\nsmoke had rapid rates of decline in lung\nfunction.Inaddition,theLungHealthStudy\nshowed a high incidence of mortality re-\nlatedtolungcancer,heartattack,andstroke\nin subjects with only mild to moderate air-\nflow obstruction.7\nBecause a high proportion of OLD has\neluded diagnosis, it is impossible to know\nthe true prevalence of these diseases in the\nUnited States today. To estimate the mag-\nnitude of OLD in the United States, we ana-\nlyzed data from the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III)8 in an effort to determine\nhow much of the US population might\nhave low levels of lung function, OLD, and\nrespiratory symptoms.\nFrom the Air Pollution and\nRespiratory Health Branch,\nDivision of Environmental\nHazards and Health Effects,\nNational Center for\nEnvironmental Health, Centers\nfor Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, Ga\n(Dr Mannino); SmithKline\nBeecham Pharmaceuticals,\nCollegeville, Pa (Drs Gagnon\nand Lydick); and the University\nof Colorado Health Sciences\nCenter, Denver, Colo\n(Dr Petty).\n\u00a92000 American Medical Association.

Study participants completed extensive question-\nnaires in the household and a comprehensive physical\nexamination, including pulmonary function testing, ei-\nther in the household or at a specially equipped mobile ex-\namination center. A total of 81 sites were included in the\nfinal sample. The study was approved by the National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board.\nSUBJECTS\nOur study sample was limited to adults aged 17 years and\nolder who classified themselves as whites or blacks, had\npulmonary function testing performed in either the home\nor the mobile examination center, and had complete data\non their race, smoking status, height, and presence of res-\npiratory symptoms. Of the 20050 adult study partici-\nhave pulmonary function testing done, 8 were missing data\non smoking status, race, or height, and 56 were missing\ndata on 1 or more respiratory symptom. In addition, we\nexcluded 4 women from the analysis who were current ci-\ngar or pipe smokers. After the exclusions, we had data from\nThe race of the participants was classified as either white or\nblackandwasdeterminedbyself-reportonthequestionnaire.\nWedefinedsubjectsasbeingcurrentsmokers,formersmok-\ners, pipe or cigar smokers, or never smokers based on their\nresponsestoseriesofquestions.Onehadtohavesmokedmore\nthan 100 cigarettes to qualify as a former or current smoker\nand could not be currently smoking cigarettes to qualify as a\npipe or cigar smoker.

We considered subjects\nwithapositiveresponsetoapreviousdiagnosisofeitherchronic\nbronchitis or asthma, but a negative response to current dis-\nease, to have a past diagnosis of OLD. We classified subjects\nas having a symptom if they gave a positive response to the\nfollowing questions involving specific symptoms (cough,\nphlegm,wheezing,anddyspnea):\"Doyouusuallycoughon\nmostdaysfor3consecutivemonthsormoreduringtheyear?\"\n\"Do you bring up phlegm on most days for 3 consecutive\nmonths or more during the year?\" \"Have you had wheezing\norwhistlinginyourchestatanytimeinthepast12months?\"\nand\"Areyoutroubledbyshortnessofbreathwhenhurrying\non level ground or walking up a slight hill?\" If a subject had\na positive response to any of these 4 symptoms, we consid-\nered that subject to have a respiratory symptom.\nFor most analyses, we stratified subjects into 6 age\nlogistic regressions we classified subjects as having or not\nhaving cardiovascular disease (positive response to physi-\ncian-diagnosed stroke, myocardial infarction, or conges-\ntive heart failure); obesity (body mass index [BMI] 28,\ncalculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square\nof the height in meters); inactivity (based on self report as\nbeing less active than peers); and low socioeconomic sta-\ntus (based on family income below poverty level).\nUsing either a dry rolling seal spirometer in the mobile ex-\namination center or a portable spirometer in the home ex-\namination, spirometry was conducted on the examinees.\nProcedures for testing were based on the 1987 American\nThoracic Society recommendations.9 To obtain accept-\nable protocol curves, examinees performed 5 to 8 forced\nexpirations. We used published prediction equations for\nforced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1\n) to calculate\nthe predicted FEV1\nfor whites and blacks, stratified by sex.10\nWe then determined the value of the FEV1\n(as a percent-\nage of the predicted value) for each subject. We defined\nsubjects with an FEV1\n\u00adforced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of\nless than 80% of their pre-\ndicted value as having low lung function, and further di-\nvided this group into subjects with an FEV1\nand those with less than 50% of their predicted value, cor-\nresponding to people with stage 1 vs stage 2 or 3 OLD.11\nANALYSIS\nWe calculated all estimates using the sampling weight to rep-\nresent adults aged 17 years and older in the United States.\nThe purpose of these sampling weight calculations was to ad-\njust for unequal probabilities of selection and to account for\nnonresponse. They were poststratified to the US population\nas estimated by the Bureau of the Census. For analyses, we\nused both SAS and SUDAAN, a program that adjusts for the\ncomplex sample design when calculating variance esti-\nmates.12 Most of our analyses stratified the data by race and\nsex,withfurtherstratificationbyeithersmokingstatusorage.\nWe also present data stratified by reported lung disease and\nlevel of lung function. In these strata and substrata, we de-\ntermined the estimated national population, the mean FEV1\naspercentpredicted,themeanFEV1\n-FVCratio,andthenum-\nber and age-adjusted percentage of the population with low\nlung function. We used the 6 age classes noted above and the\noverall age distribution of the study participants to age-\nadjust our results. In addition, we determined the number\nand age-adjusted percentage of the population with past or\ncurrent OLD and the age-adjusted percentage of the popu-\nlation with cough, phlegm, wheezing, dyspnea, or any res-\npiratory symptom. We also determined the age-adjusted per-\ncentage of the population stratified by race, sex, and smoking\nstatus with low lung function but with no current diagnosis\nof any OLD. Finally, we modeled, using logistic regression,\nfactors predicting subjects who were unable to perform pul-\nmonaryfunctiontesting,subjectswithlowlungfunction,and\nsubjects with low lung function yet no reported OLD.\n\u00a92000 American Medical Association.

Among the population, an estimated\nmillion (4.3%) had OLD in the past, but not currently\n(Table 1). The proportion of the population with past\nor current OLD varied by sex, race, and smoking status,\nwith women reporting more disease than men, whites re-\nporting more disease than blacks, and current or former\nsmokers reporting more disease than never smokers\n(Table 1). Obstructive lung disease was present among\nof pipe or cigar smokers, and 5.8% of never smokers (all\nage-adjusted to study population). Former smokers were,\non average, older than never and current smokers (Table\n1). Mean level of lung function, either as the FEV1\nratio or FEV1\npercent predicted, was always lower among\ncurrent smokers, former smokers, and pipe or cigar smok-\ners, compared with never smokers (Table 1). Among\nwhites, the reported COPD component of OLD gener-\nally increased with age, while among blacks this trend\nwas less apparent (Figure 1).\nSubjects frequently reported more than 1 OLD. For\nexample, 25.0% of subjects with current bronchitis re-\nported that they had current asthma, and 34.3% of sub-\njects with current asthma reported that they had cur-\nrent chronic bronchitis. Similarly, 19.4% of the subjects\nwith emphysema reported that they had current asthma,\nand 25.0% of the subjects with emphysema reported that\nthey had current chronic bronchitis. Among subjects who\nreported having at some point been diagnosed with\njects who reported having been at some point diag-\nnosed with chronic bronchitis also reported a current di-\nagnosis.\nPulmonaryfunctiontestingwasnotobtainedon3355\nof the original 20050 subjects. The significant predic-\ntors of not having testing done were the presence of car-\ndiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confi-\ntion, or an estimated 11.5 million people had low lung\nfunction (Table 2). An additional 7.2% of the popula-\ntion had an FEV1\n-FVC ratio of less than 0.7 but an FEV1\ngreater than 80% of the predicted value. Significant pre-\ndictors of low lung function included current smoking\nall CIs significant). Moderate to severe lung obstruction\nless than 50% of the predicted value and an FEV1\n-\nFVC ratio of less than 0.7) was more common among cur-\nrent and former smokers and among people aged 45 years\nand older (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Overall, 1.5% of\nthe population, or an estimated 2.6 million people, had\nof less than 50% of the predicted value, includ-\nof less than\n35% of the predicted value. Lower levels of lung func-\ntion were associated with higher levels of reported symp-\ntoms (Table 3).\nCurrent and former smokers reported respiratory\nsymptoms more frequently than never smokers (Table\nTable 1.

Among subjects with low lung function, 66.1%\nreported at least 1 respiratory symptom (Table 3), com-\npared with 34.4% of subjects with normal pulmonary\nfunction. There was a great deal of overlap between sub-\njects reporting respiratory symptoms, those with low lung\nfunction, and those with current or prior OLD (Figure 4,\nOverall, 63.3% of the population with low lung\nfunction did not have a current diagnosis of OLD.\nEven among subjects with moderate to severe pulmo-\nnary impairment, as indicated by an FEV1\nof less than\n50% of the predicted value, 44.0% did not have a cur-\nrent diagnosis of OLD. Across sex, race, and smoking\ncategories this proportion ranged from 40% to 88%\n(Figure 5). People with a past diagnosis of obstruc-\ntive lung disease accounted for a small proportion of\nthis group of subjects not currently diagnosed (Figure\n5). The only significant predictors of low lung function\nwithout a current diagnosis of OLD were current smok-\nCOMMENT\nThese data show that low lung function and OLD occur\ncommonly in a nationally representative sample of the\nUS population. Low lung function is found in more than\n10% of the population over age 45 years, but is not as-\nsociated with reported current OLD 63.3% of the time.\nThis finding is important, because when these patients\ncan be identified in early and less symptomatic stages of\ndisease, interventions can be expected to alter the course\nand prognosis of disease.7,13,14 Clearly, smoking cessa-\ntion is the most important feature in management and is\napt to be beneficial when it is accomplished at an early\nage with only mild evidence of airflow obstruction. While\nthe finding of low lung function does not by itself diag-\nnose OLD, its presence should alert clinicians to the pos-\nsibility of OLD being present, resulting in subsequent\nevaluations and interventions.\nThese results confirm the findings of many previ-\nous studies, which show associations between cigarette\nsmoking and pulmonary effects, including low lung\nsurprising finding, though, was that cigar or pipe smok-\ners had a higher prevalence of low lung function\nthan never smokers, along with more reported respira-\ntory symptoms, a finding that runs counter to studies\nfinding fewer smoking-related health effects in pipe or\ncigar smokers.17 Our study suggests that pipe and cigar\nsmokers are getting enough doses of smoke to cause\nlung damage, but our findings may also reflect, in part,\nformer cigarette smoking (in our study, 69.3% of pipe\nand cigar smokers were former cigarette smokers).18 In\naddition, our finding of decreased lung function in\npipe and cigar smokers demands intervening in this\ngroup.\nThe results of our analysis also confirmed previ-\nously known associations between aging and increased\nairway obstruction.19 The prevalence of low lung func-\ntion increased with increasing age (Figure 2) except in\nthe oldest group, which may be related to either differ-\nential mortality or inability to do pulmonary function test-\ning. While it is certainly known that the individuals with\nthat people over age 45 years may have significantly de-\ncreased lung function that remains undiagnosed (Fig-\nure 2 and Figure 5). The patterns we found of reported\nOLD also were consistent with reports of COPD increas-\ning with age3 (Figure 1). The racial differences we ob-\nserved, of generally lower levels of reported COPD in\nblacks compared with whites, is consistent with other ob-\nservations.3\nThere have been numerous, but much smaller re-\ngional prevalence studies done in the United States, most\nnotably in Berlin, NH22; Tecumseh, Mich23; and Glen-\nwood Springs, Colo.24 These studies used different\ndegrees of airflow obstruction and had different defini-\ntions of the diseases characterized by airflow obstruc-\ntion. In Berlin, NH, the prevalence of all chronic non-\nand low levels of lung function were found among 3.1%\ncumseh, Mich, about 14% of adult men and 8% of adult\nwomen had chronic bronchitis, obstructive airway dis-\nease, or both.23 In Glenwood Springs, Colo, about 13%\nof adult men and 10% of adult women had chronic bron-\nchitis and 13% and 4%, respectively, had low lung func-\ntion.24 The above-noted findings can be contrasted with\nour own findings of 8.5% of adults reporting current OLD\nand 6.8% having low lung function.\nOur data also showed a large degree of overlap be-\ntween asthma and COPD. Subjects with both diseases had\nlower lung function and more respiratory symptoms than\nsubjects with just one or the other disease (Table 3).\nAsthma is a potentially reversible disease when diag-\nnosed and treated early in its course with bronchoactive\nandanti-inflammatorymedications.25,26 Bycontrast, COPD\nPeople With Indicated Condition, %\nBlack Female\nBlack Male\nWhite Female\nWhite Male\nCurrent COPD and Asthma\nCurrent Asthma\nCurrrent COPD\nPast Chronic Bronchitis or Asthma\nFigure 1.

The entire medi-\ncal history, including the previous and current diag-\nnoses, the respiratory symptoms, and the smoking\nhistories, were entirely self-reported. It is possible that\nsubjects may have underreported or overreported in any\nof these categories. For instance, we found that only 33.9%\nand 25.6% of subjects with COPD reported cough and\nphlegm, respectively. While the criteria for a positive re-\nsponse to these questions were stringent, this may indi-\ncate that either symptom or disease reporting was inac-\ncurate. Another limitation was that current smokers who\neither smoked irregularly or had just stopped smoking\ncould be misclassified as former smokers.

It\nis possible that subjects unable to do pulmonary func-\ntion testing were also more likely to have low levels of\nlung function, thus resulting in an underestimate in the\nburden of the prevalence of low lung function in the\nUnited States. Selection was limited to a noninstitution-\nalized, nonmilitary population, so it was not truly ran-\ndomized to a general population. Only patients who were\nambulatory and able to participate were studied, which\nmight have created a selection bias.\nPulmonary function testing may provide an inter-\nventional opportunity in the United States. Since early\nintervention may alter the course and prognosis of OLD,\nit is important that all clinicians who encounter smok-\ners and any patient with respiratory symptoms, particu-\nlarly those over age 45 years, be able to make an accu-\nrate diagnosis.
