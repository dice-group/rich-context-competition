    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article examines the extent to which the deregulation of Nigerian higher education (HE) has facilitated the McDonaldization\nof the universities. University education in Nigeria commenced in 1948 with the establishment of the University College,\nIbadan. After independence in 1960, subsequent governments expanded the number of universities, a policy based on a lack\nof quality manpower in leadership positions created by the exit of British officials and the need to grant access to an increasing\nnumber of prospective students. In the 1970s, the number of universities increased accompanied by a decline in infrastructure,\nfunding, and working conditions. This resulted in several strikes and an exodus of academics to other countries. Instead of\ntackling the problems, the federal government shifted responsibilities by approving private ownership of universities in 1999\nand by establishing the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) in 2001. Against this backdrop, this article critically\nanalyzes how some of these reforms facilitated the McDonaldization of Nigerian universities. The article reveals how this has\nresulted in an overloading of responsibilities on the faculty, erosion of academic autonomy, a prioritization of quantity over\nquality of publications, and an assumption of \"customer\" status by students. The article uses evidence from McDonaldized HE\nin Western countries to discuss the implications of these developments and suggests some remedial measures.\n",

After the\nwar in 1945, the United Nations was formed, and one of its\nimmediate concerns was the declaration of fundamental\nhuman rights. To this end, the UN General Assembly on\nHuman Rights (UDHR) and one of its main priorities (as part\nof the declaration) was the promotion of rights to education,\nwhich according to Lockheed and Verspoor (1991) \"shall be\nfree at least in the elementary and fundamental stages\"\nIn line with this, a conference jointly sponsored by the\nUnited Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) and Economic Commission for\nAfrica (ECA) that was aimed at promoting the right to edu-\ncation in African subregion and setting targets on how to\nObasi, 2000).

Such meetings were held in Paris (1962), in Abidjan\nIn the Addis Ababa's conference that was attended by\n39 African ministers of education and five delegates (rep-\nresenting five European countries; Yoloye, 1986) for\ninstance, it was agreed to \"set a goal for the achievement\nof 100% universal compulsory 6-year primary education in\ncentral to the meeting, priority was also placed on the\ndevelopment of secondary and HE (Bray, 1986), and this\ncan be authenticated by the fact that the African delegates\naverred that\nsome African countries have unduly neglected secondary and\nHE in proportion to primary education. Economic development\nis highly dependent on skills of the sort which are taught in\ninstitutions to students of 15 years of age and upwards. It is of\nthe highest priority to ensure that an adequate proportion of the\npopulation receives secondary, post-secondary and university\neducation; this should be put before the goal of universal primary\nIn fact, it can be argued that one main reason for laying\nemphasis on the development of HE is to meet the human\nresource demands in most African countries orchestrated by\nnot just the exit of foreign workforce following the attain-\nment of independence in many African states, but need to\naccelerate social and economic development in the African\ncontinent that suffered many years of colonial intrusion, con-\ntrol, and deprivation. Thus, Sherman (1990) notes that \"these\ncircumstances set the tone, and markedly influenced the\ncourse of higher educational development on the continent\"\nIn consonance with this immediate need to develop man-\npower, many African countries initiated the implementation\nof free and mandatory Universal Primary Education (UPE)\nafter the 1961's conference, but it was not launched in\nNigeria was made possible following the boom in the econ-\nomy that was orchestrated by the rise in price of crude oil in\nthe global market (Obasi, 2000). The boom did not just affect\nprimary education; it led to the establishment of many fed-\neral and state-owned universities in Nigeria.\nThis economic growth seemingly continued until the\nearly 1980s that saw the beginning of decline following eco-\nnomic recession that affected many developing countries.\nAccording to Obasi (2000), the \"recession was triggered off\nby the sudden collapse of the world market price for crude\noil\" (p. 192) that Nigeria mainly depended on, but another\nreason was due to the fact that the oil revenue derived during\nthe oil windfall was mismanaged and embezzled due to\nhyper-corruption in the Nigerian polity. The result of this and\nhow it affected education is hereunder examined.\nStructural Adjustment Program (SAP)\nand Education in Nigeria\ncountries witnessed severe economic hardship and this\nforced many of them to opt for the World Bank and/or\nInternational Monetary Fund's (IMF's) policy of Structural\nadjustment (Konadu-Agyemang, 2000). SAP is one of the\nWorld Bank and IMF's microeconomics policies mapped out\nfor developing countries under debt to adopt and implement\nvia loan facilities to remedy their ailing economy (Obasi,\ninclude privatization and commercialization of government-\nowned assets and companies, drastic reduction in govern-\nment expenditures and devaluation of the country's currency\nIn Nigeria, for instance, the distress in the economy in the\n1980s forced the then democratic government headed by\nPresident Shagari to begin to negotiate for the World Bank/\nIMF loan (irrespective of the fact that stringent conditions\nwere attached to the loan), but this was discontinued when\nthe government was overthrown in 1983 by General Buhari-\nBuhari's government was overthrown by General Ibrahim\nBabangida, who in 1986 adopted SAP with severe implica-\nnotes that one main attribute of SAP globally is \"a decrease\nin funds available for education as a component of social\nsector\" (p. 97), the implementation of SAP meant a total\nwithdrawal of scarcely given fund to the Nigerian\nuniversities.\nThis is why Geo-Jaja and Mangum (2001) note that SAP\ncontributed to the problems of the African and more pre-\ncisely, the Nigerian society. To these scholars, this was\nbecause the \"adjusters took the easy way out. Instead of\ninsisting that corruption be ferreted out, or that military\nexpenditures be cut, they slashed more visible expenditures\non education or public health . . . \" (p. 31). The introduction\nof SAP worsened the extant poor funding of education and\ngeneral condition, and this created tension in the economy\nthat resulted in several protests by different associations such\nas the National Association of Nigerian Students, the\nAcademic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), and so on\n(Shettima, 1993), but the government remained adamant.\nThis neglect in funding necessitated the introduction of fee\npaying programs in the universities as well as orchestrated\nseveral industrial actions in the Nigerian HE. Again, one of\nthe ways the government of Nigeria tried to cushion the\neffect of recession was the encouragement of private partici-\npation in the ownership of universities in Nigeria (Okebukola,\nThe Origin of PUs in Nigeria\nAs noted, the need for increased access necessitated the\nestablishment of many universities in Nigeria after\nindependence. Presently, three categories of university exist:\nfederal government universities (FGUs), state government\nuniversities (SGUs), and PUs. The first to set up universities\nwas the federal government, but the constitutional amend-\nment that placed HE \"under the concurrent list in 1979\"\nopened the doors for the state governments to own universi-\nuniversities in Nigeria was initiated in the 1980s (during the\neconomic recession), but due to irregularities, 24 operating\nthis was driven by a number of very practical issues such as\nthe government's inability to fund public universities in the\nlight of economic recession (that led to SAP) and the govern-\nment's willingness to allow private enterprises in university\neducation (and many other areas of the economy such as the\nbanking sector; see Dumbili, 2013a) to meet the ever-\ngrowing demand for it, which was also a response to political\nexpediency. As said, factors such as bad governance, corrup-\ntion, and repression in Nigerian polity (and in many other\nAfrican countries, especially military intervention in poli-\ntics) made the universities remain sole institutions resisting\nsuch malpractices, and hence denied government funding as\nwell as ever-growing willingness to privatize them by subse-\nquent administrations.\nIn 1999, Nigeria democratically elected President\nObasanjo, and one of the first policies his administration pur-\nsued was the reintroduction of PUs. Thus, three PUs com-\nmenced operation in that year (Akpotu & Akpochafo, 2009).\nThe PUs in Nigeria are owned either by religious organiza-\ntions or by entrepreneurs. In addition, the federal govern-\nment established the National Open University of Nigeria\nlearning degrees (ODL). PUs differ from public universities\n(FGUs and SGUs) in (a) the motive for the establishment, (b)\nownership and administrative structure, (c) the admission\nprocess, (d) school fees, and so on. For example, while all\nFGUs and SGUs are established mainly to give access to the\nincreasing Nigerian population seeking entrance to the uni-\nversities as earlier noted, some PUs (especially those owned\nby religious bodies) are likely to give access to specific reli-\ngious adherents while many (especially those owned by\nentrepreneurs) are established with profit motives (Erinosho,\n2007). In terms of the administrative structures of the univer-\nsities, there have always been government interferences\n(Teferra & Altbachl, 2004). In the FGUs, the President who\nis the Visitor1 has the final say in the appointment of a Vice\nChancellor. In the SGUs, the State Governor has the highest\nauthority, while the entrepreneurs manage their PUs.\nIrrespective of the structure, it is worthy of note that the main\nreasons for initiating the privatization of Nigerian HE was\ndue to the utterly dreadful character of Nigerian public HE\n(orchestrated by long neglect by the government) and the\nneed to grant additional access to the increasing admission\nseekers.\nAlthough university education as earlier noted com-\nmenced before Nigeria became politically independent, it\nhas in several ways received less attention than it deserved\nfrom the government. This negligence and underfunding by\nsuccessive governments of Nigeria, especially in the light of\nera of SAP necessitated in 1990 that the then federal govern-\nment initiated \"the Longe Commission on the Review of\nHigher Education in Nigeria\" to develop strategies to tackle\nthe above problems (Okuwa, 2004, p. 2). The Commission\nmade recommendations, but they were not implemented by\nthe military government. The subsequent action is what\nOdebiyi and Aina (1999) summed as follows:\nThe Association of University Union (ASUU) embarked on a\nseven-month general strike in 1992 which paralyzed activities in\nthe universities. Some of theASUU's agitations include funding,\nacademic freedom, and university autonomy. ASUU's strike\nactions attracted government intimidation and harassment with\nmany of its national executives incarcerated. (pp. 67-68)\nThis was followed by another strike in 1993 because the\ngovernment failed to implement the agreement with ASUU\nto restore the lost glory in the Nigerian HE, the federal gov-\nernment introduced \"the National Policy on Education of\nthe internal organization and administration of each institution\nshall be its own responsibility; the traditional areas of academic\nfreedom for the institutions are: selecting their students except\nwhere the law prescribes otherwise; appoint their staff, teach,\nselect areas of research; and determine the content of the courses.\nAlthough this brought a glimpse of hope, academic free-\ndom was still far from being assured because of the clause\ncontained in the same policy document: \"Government shall\ncontinue to respect this freedom as long as these areas are in\nconsonance with the national goal\" (Arikewuyo, 2004, p.\nmany other reforms and policies have ensued in the Nigerian\nHE. Some of these reforms and policies include the Virtual\n2011) and the Quality Assurance (QA) Policy of the NUC\nthat started following the creation of its department in 2005\nIt is against this backdrop that this article uses Ritzer's\nMcDonaldization thesis to analyze the myriad of evidence\nthat shows the extent to which the recent reforms have\nopened the doors for the McDonaldizing process in the\nNigerian universities leading to erosion of the fragile aca-\ndemic autonomy. It is worthy of note that to my knowledge,\nthis is the first attempt to examine the McDonaldization of\nNigerian HE. The focus of this article is, therefore, to explore\nwhen, how, and why the McDonaldization of HE began in\nNigeria; the implications of this McDonaldizing process; and\npossible remedies to the adverse consequences of\nMcDonaldization of HE. Drawing on available secondary\ndata and personal observation, the article makes explicit\n4 SAGE Open\nsociological contributions to the ongoing debate on\nMcDonaldization of HE. It is aimed at not just the Nigerian\npolicy makers but to draw the attention of policy makers in\nother developing countries to urge caution when formulating\nHE policies, especially without proper feasibility studies and\nwide consultations with stakeholders. The article is divided\ninto four sections: the following section lays out the theoreti-\ncal framework guiding the article; the next explores\nMcDonaldizing processes and the implications in the\nNigerian universities while the last section contains conclud-\ning remarks regarding possible remedial measures.\nTheoretical Framework\nThe McDonaldization Thesis\nMcDonaldization is a sociological concept Ritzer (2000)\nused to explore the increasing rationalization of postmodern\nsociety (Smart, 1999). Ritzer drew on Weber's bureaucrati-\nzation/rationalization theory to examine the rationalization\nof McDonald's food industry (Ritzer, 2000). To Max Weber,\nthe upsurge of \"two great forces of modernity--which he\nclaimed are capitalism and bureaucracy\" in Western society,\ncreated social change that affected every facet of social life\nbelieved that human society has experienced rationality (in\ndifferent forms and in different stages), none of them has\nexperienced what he called \"formal rationality,\" which he\ndefined as \"the search by people for the optimum means to a\ngiven end\" which is \"shaped by rules, regulations, and large\nThis structure is what he called bureaucratic organization,\nand according to Smart (1999), this was the \"most prominent\nexpression of the institutionalization of formal rationality: a\nform of organization, of rules and regulations, which was\nconsidered to constitute an optimum means for realizing pre-\nordained ends\" (p. 3). As noted, his argument was that the\nrationalization process that he believed has inevitably\ninfested modern Western world will forever transform not\njust the Western world but all human society even though he\nbelieved the latter will be in the future (Lippmann & Aldrich,\n2003). Weber noted that bureaucratization of human organi-\nzation, which makes it superior to, as well as dominates other\ntypes of organizations (Lippmann & Aldrich, 2003), is nec-\nessary. Although important due to its efficiency, he added\nthat this will in turn create \"uncheckable dynamics of ratio-\nnalization . . . which locks the actors it involves into the iron\ncage, leaving them no way out\" (Bender, Poggi, & Smart,\n1999, p. 26), and thus, culminates in disenchantment of these\nDrawing largely on this theory, Ritzer (2000) succinctly\nstates that McDonaldization is \"the process by which the\nprinciples of fast-food restaurant are coming to dominate\nmore and more sectors of American society as well as of the\nrest of the world\" (p. 1). Although of American origin, Ritzer\n(2001) avers that this McDonaldization process is gradually\nspreading to other parts of the globe and is dominating every\nsphere of the social milieu. These principles are fourfold:\n\"efficiency, calculability, predictability and control\" (Ritzer,\noften engenders unintended consequences, which can be lik-\nened, to \"the fifth dimension of McDonaldization,\" or irra-\ntionality of rationality because \"rational systems are often\nunreasonable\" (p. 16).\nEfficiency is \"the optimum method for getting from one\npoint to another\" (Ritzer, 2000, p. 12). McDonald's provides\ncustomers with the best and the quickest ways of moving\n\"from being hungry to being full,\" and the workforce is\nequally trained to follow the \"predesigned process\" effi-\nciently (p. 12). To achieve this, customers are indirectly\nrecruited to the workforce by making them serve themselves,\neat, and clean up the rubbish afterward (Ritzer, 2001). In HE,\nRitzer (2000) points out that the quest for efficiency has led\nto the machine-graded examination that makes it possible for\neven a \"graduate assistant\" to grade students (p. 49). The aim\nof efficiency according to Hartley (1995) \"is the optimisation\nof resources, but this, in turn, implies that the product itself\nis definable, precisely without ambiguity\" (p. 411).\nIn terms of calculability or quantification, McDonald's\nprefers quantity to quality. For example, Ritzer (2001) posits\nthat McDonald's lays \"emphasis on the quantitative aspects\nof products sold (portion, size, cost) and service offered (the\ntime it takes to get the product)\" (p. 199). What matters most\nin a typical McDonald's restaurant is the number and size of\nfood produced in the shortest time while the quality is incon-\nsequential, and this is because profit is determined by the\nnumber of items sold (Ritzer, 2000). In HE, Ritzer points to\nevidence of this quantification such as the rating or ranking\nof universities which helps students to choose from a menu,\nthe grading of students, the emphasis on credentials, the\nnumber of hours people work weekly, and the number of\npublications (as against its quality). Furthermore, he posited\nthat \"the focus seems to be on how many students (`the prod-\nuct') that can be herded through the system and what grades\nthey earn rather than the quality of what they have learned\"\n\"quantification allows for comparability and, therefore, for\ncompetition, which rewards the winners and shows up the\nPredictability is the third dimension of McDonaldization,\nand this is \"the assurance that products and services will be\nthe same over time and in all locales\" (Ritzer, 2000, p. 13).\nBecause of homogenization of the processes of food produc-\ntion, the size, taste, color, and so on are predictable in all\nfore notes that this has infested HE, and it is evident in the\nsimilarity of courses, textbooks, uniformity of syllabuses,\nmultiple questions, grading system, and so on. Finally, there\nis an emphasis on control. Here, Ritzer (2001) argues that\nbecause humans are highly unpredictable, control becomes\ninevitable, which necessitates the \"substitution of nonhuman\nfor human technology\" (p. 200). This is why machines are\ninvolved in food production while only a few humans are\nthat \"universities have developed a variety of nonhuman\ntechnologies to exert control over professors\" (p. 108).\nAcademics are meant to work under pressure to teach, exam-\nine, and submit students' grade at a specified time.\nFurthermore, he argues that students are also controlled in\nvarious ways. For example, they are given \"little leeway in\nthe courses they may take\" and \"because of the tyranny of\nthe clock, a class must end at the sound of the bell, even if the\nstudents are just about to comprehend something important,\"\nMcDonaldization and Nigerian\nUniversities: Evidence and Implications\nPrivatization of HE\nSuffice it to say that the privatization of Nigerian HE in\nof the QA department in NUC in 2005 marked the point of\ndeparture for the massification, commercialization, and the\nMcDonaldizing process in Nigerian universities. Although\nGeorge Ritzer's analysis of the McDonaldization of HE was\noriginally based on the American universities, it has become\ndifficult to ignore the fact that McDonaldization principles\ndriven by capitalism and technology are spreading across the\nentire globe though the impact may not be exactly the same.\nTo appropriately situate this discourse in this section, it is\nnoteworthy to mention that privatization and marketization\nof HE is not a Nigerian reserve. In fact, it can be argued to\nhave been an international trend since World War II. Thus, it\nbecame exigencies in many African countries (after indepen-\ndence) such as Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, Uganda, and so on\ndue to increasing demand for HE, the inability of public\nschools to admit ever-growing number of qualified candi-\ndates, and most importantly, lack of proper funding, most\nespecially at the wake of economic recession that necessi-\ntated the adoption of adjustment policies in these countries\nFor example, in 1980 before SAP was adopted in Nigeria\naccording to Hoffman (1995), the total enrollment of stu-\npublic fund was budgeted for education. In 1990 (post-SAP\nreceived only 1% of government expenditure, and govern-\nment spending continued to decrease in subsequent years\n(Dabalen, Oni, & Adekola, 2001). Similarly, Aluede, Idogho,\nAgainst this backdrop, privatization of HE (to increase\naccess) in Nigeria may seemingly be justified, but as the\nanalysis below will reveal, it can be argued to be not just a\nshift in government responsibilities but a policy designed\nwithout proper feasibility study, wide consultation with\nstakeholders, or any cushion effect.\nReferences will now be made to United Kingdom, the\nUnited States, and other countries that have McDonaldized\nHE. The aim is not for comparison, but to draw lessons from\nthem so as to show Nigerian policy makers in particular and\nothercountriesingeneraltheconsequencesofMcDonaldizing\nHE in a fragile economy such as Nigeria. Again, the article is\nnot to argue that the privatization of Nigerian HE and other\nrelated policies the government pursued are bad because\nsome of them have begun to yield positive results (Moruku,\n2013). My focus is to highlight and critique the negative\nimpact of these policies that policy makers may have not\ntaken into consideration before the implementation of the\npolicies so as to avoid such mistakes in future policies for-\nmulation and implementation. This is because Ritzer (2000)\nargues that the four principles of McDonaldization (effi-\nciency, calculability, predictability, and control) often engen-\nder unintended consequences (irrationalities).\nAs noted, the Nigerian government in 1999 approved pri-\nvate ownership of universities (Akpotu & Akpochafo, 2009)\nwas instead of improving the poor state of government uni-\nversities, and this led to the establishment of three PUs in\nthat year. To further strengthen privatization, the government\napproved more PUs, and as of November 2013, the numbers\nof PUs in Nigeria have reached 51 while FGUs total 40\n(NUC, 2013). The Nigerian privatization system is charac-\nterized by capitalism and its principles of too much emphasis\non profit at the shortest time, while quality is arguably imma-\nterial. Thus, this emphasis of capitalism on profit has the ten-\ndency to homogenize and degrade everything in its path, and\nthis happened when the Nigeria government introduced sim-\nilar reforms in the banking sector in 2005 (see Dumbili,\n2013c). Following the introduction of private ownership of\nuniversities, emphasis has begun to be laid on the \"market-\nthe number of students who are produced yearly. Another\nrecent phenomenon is the increasing emphasis on missions\nand visions of each school, arguably aimed to make its prod-\nuct attractive to potential customers. Each school's website\ndisplays how effectively they graduate students, how condu-\ncive or stable their programs are, and how competitive their\ncost is compared with others (public universities). The\nNOUN is not left out in this competition because it vividly\nadvertises its courseware, fees, and other academic\nactivities.\n6 SAGE Open\nAlthough the massification of education (through PUs) in\nquest for efficiency may increase access as noted, studies\nhave shown that it may not be the only or best means of\nachieving this. For instance, it makes room for market-driven\ncertification where results are measured according to \"per-\nformance indicators and efficiency\" rather than \"educated\n\"perpetuate inequality than eradicate it\" (Gouthro, 2002, p.\n30) because of its high cost (Adeogun, Subair, & Osifila,\nexample, one of the PUs in Nigeria (Igbinedion University)\ngovernment universities (GUs) charged about 50,000 naira\n(US$309). This makes it more difficult for the poor to pay\nand opens up wider doors for the elites. This is because a\nmajority of Nigerians live below US$1 per day, and the mini-\nto irrationality because the quest for efficiency (more access\nthrough PUs) is leading to inefficiency as it excludes a large\nnumber because of the high cost (Ritzer, 2000).\nAnother consequence of this McDonaldizing process is\nthat it has arguably begun to engender unhealthy competi-\ntions between GUs and PUs. Because the latter are arguably\ntend to be a larger number of students in a class than facilities\ncan accommodate (Erinosho, 2007). This massification of\nstudents arguably is becoming one of the criteria for judging\nthe faculty in GUs by policy makers (Bryson, 2004). This\nlends support to Margolis's (2004) argument that \"faculty are\npressurised to recruit and retain students . . . and to compete\nwith private for-profit universities\" (pp. 368-369). In addi-\ntion, the policy of privatization of HE in Nigeria will further\nperpetuate the perennial low government funding of univer-\nsity education in Nigeria (Odebiyi & Aina, 1999; Saint et al.,\nAnother implication of this deregulation of HE in Nigeria\nis that it has opened doors for increasing illicit universities in\nNigeria. Because PUs are run \"on franchise basis\" (Healey,\n2009, NUC discovered that 41 illegal universities were oper-\nating in Nigeria (Adeogun et al., 2009). Further revelations\nshow that 48 illegal universities exist in Nigeria in 2012, and\n\"this list of illegal universities is not exhaustive\" (NUC\nBulletin, 2012, p. 16). This is likely to lead many students\nwho are seeking university education to fall into the hands of\nswindlers. Just as Ritzer (2000) argues that a McDonaldized\nsystem is not always reasonable, the quest for more access\nand efficiency by privatizing HE in Nigeria rather than\nexpanding, equipping, and funding existing ones has resulted\nin irrationalities.\nEfficiency in the Nigerian Universities\nThe success of McDonald's is hinged on efficiency, and this\nis the rationale for scripting jobs and interaction to eliminate\ntime wasting (Ritzer, 2000). This has infested HE in many\nHayes, 2006). For example, Western universities in a quest\nfor efficiency now run many online degrees, use courseware\nto teach, employ few lecturers whose tenures are not fixed,\neliminate academic autonomy, and regard students as cus-\net al. (1999) argue that McDonaldization tends to provide \"a\nset of menacing and probably inescapable tendencies toward\ndehumanization\" (p. 23). In Nigerian Universities, some of\nthese features are beginning to surface. Following the rein-\ntroduction of NOUN in 2001, online studies are now possi-\nble (Okebukola, 2010), and many other universities have\nadopted this computer-based learning. The NOUN presently\nprovides courseware and other e-learning facilities for stu-\ndents to study and acquire online degrees and diplomas. On\nits part, the NUC created the Department of Information and\nCommunication Technology (ICT) in September 2010 with\nthe following vision and mission:\nto facilitate the utilization of ICT for teaching, research, planning\nmanagement and effective evaluation through the decision\nmaking package in the Nigeria university system; the department\nis to assist the NUC to carry out its mandate in the deregulated\nNigeria university system . . . (NUC, 2014)\nAlthough ICT innovation is germane to HE globally, it\ndoes not go without cost. It has been reported that, in many\nNigerian universities, the ICT does not work efficiently due\nto improper maintenance (due to poor funding), erratic power\nusing such technologies. In relation to learning, scholars\nhave argued that e-learning homogenizes learning, kills\ndiversity and creativity, and culminates in dehumanizing the\nlearner (Quinn, 2000). One of the reasons for this is that\n\"persuasive usage on internet technology does not guarantee\npositive gains in instructional objectives\" (Etherington,\n2008, p. 47). In addition, distance learning kills the opportu-\nnity of classroom criticism, widens the gap between the\nlearner and the teacher, erases the civility of the classroom\nnurturing, and hinders \"classroom interaction skills\"\n(Grineski, 1999, p. 47). Thus, the students only \"learn to do\nother than learning to know\" (Grineski, 2000, p. 22) because\nOn the part of the faculty, the pressure to teach and gradu-\nate students to satisfy market demand turns the former to\nwhat Halfond and Boyd (1997) call \"teaching machines\" (p.\n208) who are overloaded with responsibilities that are\nexpected to be performed efficiently and in the shortest time.\nreported to be studying in Nigerian universities, while a total\nand Matriculation Board (JAMB; Vanguard, 2014). The\nincrease in the number of students in geometric progression\nand lack of commensurate facilities, good working\nconditions and few numbers of academic staff in Nigeria\ncontribute to the dehumanization of available staff.\nThe academics are dehumanized because they are meant\nto teach these teaming numbers of students in the same space\n(with minimal facility) and are expected to produce quality\ngraduates. Similarly, in universities where teaching technol-\nogies are used, they are meant to teach with courseware that\nthey never designed, and grade students with machines that\nrequire little of their skills or input. In the same vein, the\nincreasing emphasis on internal and external-driven efficien-\ncies in all the Nigerian universities means that academics are\nmeant to work longer hours than they used to do in the past,\nteach and graduate students at record time with remarkably\nfew or no dropout (Ajadi, 2010). One of the implications is\nthat little or no time will be dedicated to research, which is\nsupposed to be the hub of universities--yet another\nirrationality.\nStudents as Customers in Quest for\nEfficiency in the Nigerian Universities\nThe viewing of students as customers became widely known\nwith the seminal work of Franz (1998), though its origin is in\nthe United States, and began because students paid the great-\nest part of the cost of their education in the United States\n(Redding, 2005). This is not same in the United Kingdom\nwhere education is mainly funded via money derived from\ntaxation (Redding, 2005). If this is so, in the Nigerian context\nstudents can be seen as customers. This is because the paying\nof fees has been a tradition in Nigerian universities, in that\nEducation, in general, and HE in particular have always been\nIrrespective of the fact that students hitherto paid school\nfees prior to the introduction of the current PUs in 1999\n(Okojie, 2008), it can be argued that students in these PUs\ncan be rightly called customers. This is, in part, because of\nthe way students are beginning to be reified in these PUs.\nAlthough a dearth of published data exist in this debate, it is\ngenerating heated discussions among Nigerians that many\nstudents in most PUs do not attend classes regularly, and lec-\nturers do not have the right to disallow such a group from\nwriting examinations as it is done in most GUs where 75%\nattendance is compulsory. This is, arguably, because their\nhigh school fees in the PUs have bought them the privilege.\nOne of the implications of students being seen and treated\nas customers is that, in the quest for efficiency, there is pres-\nsure for the manipulation of academic grades. This lends cre-\ndence to Franz's (1998) assertion that when students are\ncustomers, \"the ultimate outcome is unrelenting grade infla-\ntion--keep the student-cum-customer happy and give him or\nher what they want\" (pp. 63-64). In the Nigerian context,\nbecause students are becoming the customers in the PUs (due\nto high school fees and resultant reification), the proprietors\nof these schools, arguably, ensure that students get the best\nvalue for their money because their satisfaction will guaran-\ntee continued patronage from them and other customers as\nthe customer is always right. Softening the grading system,\nmaking it easier for students to pass to attract more custom-\ners to their schools, is arguably one of the ways this is done.\nThis can be authenticated by the proportion of first class\nhonors that graduate from these PUs yearly (unlike what\nFGUs and SGUs with better facilities produce), a factor that\nis beginning to generate debates among employers. This is\nbecause these graduates are said to be underperforming, and\nthis as Erinosho (2007) argues may not be unrelated to the\nmotive behind the founding of the schools, the qualities of\nteachers, and extant poor facilities.\nAs an example of the above, in a study that investigated\nthree of the foremost PUs (Babcock, Bowen, and Igbinedion)\nin Nigeria, it was reported that \"there are 1 doctorate degree\ncredence to the fact that they employed \"more masters than\ndoctorate degree teachers\" against NUC rules (p. 64).\nFurthermore, this scholar revealed that \"the academic pro-\ngrammes of private universities are circumscribed. The\nfounders are inclined to mount courses that will attract stu-\ndents or money or both, and they may also be inclined to\nsacrifice quality\" (p. 64). He further added that \"the motive\nto establish a university might not necessarily be altruistic\nbut driven by the desire to make money from the gullible and\nunsuspecting public\" (p. 66). This is, in fact, one of the prob-\nlems of massification of HE (Parker & Jary, 1995). However,\nthe claim that students are customers means that \"the pro-\nvider's (teacher's) task is to spoon-feed bits of content and\nthe customer's (student's) task is to assimilate, digest and\nregurgitate\" on the examination day (De Vita & Case, 2003,\npp. 391-392). It shifts the responsibilities of learning and\nplaces it on the teachers (Van Valey, 2001). Although this\ndoes no good to both the \"consumers and sellers of learning\"\nformer is losing more because of inactive participation in\nlearning.\nStudents as Working Customers in\nQuest for Efficiency\nIn the quest for efficiency in a typical McDonald's, Ritzer\nprocess by making them serve themselves in so many ways\nwithout being paid. For example, those who will dare to eat\nin the restaurant are meant to queue up, collect food, eat, and\nefficiently clear up the rubbish. For others, the run-through\nmakes it faster, and their \"cars are the spaces\" that make it\neasier for the rubbish to be cleared (Ritzer, 2000). Therefore,\nif students are becoming known as customers in Nigeria,\nthey arguably will be working customers.\nThe introduction of a techno-based system of registration,\nthe Virtual (Digital) Library Project (Okebukola, 2006), and\n8 SAGE Open\nthe creation of the ICT department in NUC marked the point\nof departure for using students as \"manufacturing custom-\nAs it is in McDonald's, Nigerian students start creating their\nown experience before they are admitted into the universi-\nties. Following the introduction of online registration by the\nJAMB2 in the late 2000s, students now do most of the jobs\npreviously done by the JAMB's officials and universities'\nnonacademic staff. For example, students buy scratch cards\nfrom JAMB designated centers, go to a cybercaf\u00e9 to buy air-\ntime, register online, and pay to print the documents before\nsubmitting the forms. If they make a mistake, this attracts\nextra cost. If they \"pass the test,\" they return to the cybercaf\u00e9\nto check their results or buy airtime to check through their\nphones. If they are successful, they move to the Post-\nUniversity Matriculation Examination3 (PUME) and repeat\nsimilar processes.\nHere, they buy another scratch card or form from the uni-\nversities they chose, go to a cybercaf\u00e9 to register, print the\nform, and submit it. If they succeed in the PUME, they need\nto go back to the caf\u00e9 to make and clear their payment before\nthey do the online registration of modules (courses or sub-\njects as they are called in the Nigerian HE). When they even-\ntually start taking the university's examinations, they will\nkeep spending money to check their results and perform the\nother techno-based school activities because many Nigerian\nuniversities mostly do not have functional Internet facilities,\nwhile those that have do not offer students free access. This\nis why private cybercaf\u00e9s flood every Nigerian university\ncampus.\nIn the universities that have digital libraries, students\ncarry out online data searching and processing, photocopy-\ning, scanning, printing, and so on for themselves. Although\nthe argument of this article is not that techno-based learning\nis useless, or that HE in Nigeria should go back to the state it\nwas before deregulation that engendered privatization begun,\nwhat it argues is the fact that the negative impacts are often\noverlooked by Nigerian policy makers. For example, stu-\ndents end up paying for these services they do for themselves\ndue to multiple fees (Moruku, 2013) and the high cost of\nInternet facilities in Nigeria (Salaam & Adegbore, 2010).\nThis lends credence to what Ritzer (2000) notes that \"ratio-\nnal systems are not less expensive, they force people to do\nunpaid work, and they are often inefficient\" (p. 125). Because\nstudents perform these tasks without being paid, this leads to\nexploitation of the student (Ritzer & Jurgenson, 2010).\nAnother consequence is that the deployment of technologies\nengenders job loss or insecurity (Dumbili, 2013c). This is\nbecause many tasks hitherto performed by the nonacademic\nstaff are now being transferred to students and technologies,\nleading to control. Therefore, nonacademic staff that previ-\nously performed these tasks are often rendered redundantly\nor sacked and this will increase if HE in Nigeria is fully\nMcDonaldized.\nAnother serious implication of McDonaldization is that it\nengenders malpractice. \"Examination paper\" leakages linked\nto JAMB officials are common occurrences in Nigeria, while\nthose desperate students who fail to get the questions pay\nsome corrupt JAMB and university staff to alter their scores\n(Willott, 2011) in ICT centers, often by overturning a student\n\"fail.\" Again, a dearth of data is evident in this direction, but\nit was widely discussed in 2011 among staff and students of\none of the eastern-Nigerian universities that a student who\nscored 37 was given 73 when she paid the large sum the ICT\nstaff of that university demanded. This is a tip of the iceberg\nof the situation in Nigerian HE (for more on corruption and\naccess to Nigerian HE, see Willott, 2011). This means that\nthe quest for efficiency through ICT is leading to inefficien-\ncies in many ways, that is, failed students are graduating,\nthereby undermining the employment market and ultimately\nthe value of a Nigerian degree.\nCalculability in the Nigerian\nUniversities\nCalculability has to do with reification of quantity against\nquality, and this has infested the Nigerian HE. One aspect of\nthis calculability is \"target setting\" (Wilkinson, 2006, p. 90)\nby Nigerian universities. This is evident in the number of\nstudents each university plans to admit yearly, teach, and\nmost importantly, graduate. Presently, one of the criteria for\nranking universities among the best (\"calculability\") is the\nnumber of students they graduate annually (Okebukola,\ntargets to make more money from their fees (through turn-\nover), be in the top list, and also have their course accredited\nby the \"watchdog\"--NUC or the \"efficiency police\"\ncome to matter most, and their qualities, arguably, are imma-\nterial. Little wonder why many of the Nigerian graduates fail\nto meet the standard required for employment because they\nlack employable skills (Dabalen, Oni, & Adekola, 2001).\nAnother aspect of quantification is linked to the competi-\ntion that occurs after the JAMB result is released. Many\nschools advertise for students who originally did not choose\ntheir institutions and those disqualified (due to low score) in\nother schools are encouraged to buy their forms and take\ntheir test. This is because the number of students who bought\nthe form determines the profit of the school. It should be\nrecalled that one of Ritzer's assertions is that \"material inter-\nests\" is one main factor that drives McDonaldization (Smart,\n1999, p. 6), but this has a serious implication because many\nof these students end up being refused admission, which\nleads to a loss of money and time on the part of students.\nIn addition, many universities admit more students than\ntheir facilities can sustain (Erinosho, 2007) because the num-\nber of students they have determines the amount of money\nthey will receive because of variable fees. Many GUs like\nPUs currently run different market-based diplomas, certifi-\ncates, and part-time programs with a growing number of stu-\ndents. In fact, it can be argued that these programs are created\nto make money and not to impart knowledge. This is because\nthe same number of academics is used to teach these courses,\nand this leads to overloading them with work, while others\nuse less qualified contract or casual staff to run the programs\nPublish or Perish as an Aspect of Calculability\nAlthough in Nigeria academics have always been assessed\nby their research output, previously quality was considered\nmore valuable than the quantity of publications. In many\nNigerian universities presently, academics are promoted to\nsenior positions without a single international publication\nleading many Nigerian lecturers to resort to pay-as-you-\nSome common emerging practices are self-publication,\nduplication of the same article with different titles, and argu-\nably the worst--plagiarizing other people's work. All these\nlead to the publication of inferior articles just to meet up with\nthe \"number\" required for promotion (Olukoju, 2004), and\nthis is leading to \"the ever-growing number of professors\nappointed or promoted on doubtful research and publication\nthat \"McDonald's has always emphasised on bigness\" or\nquantity (p. 64), the number of publications is fast replacing\nthe qualities in many of these Nigerian universities where\nacademics get promoted irrespective of the poor quality of\nresearch and papers they produce. Little wonder why Ritzer\n(2000) notes that \"any system that places much emphasis on\nquantity of publication will lead to the production of a great\ndeal of mediocre work\" (p. 69), but the implication of this is\nthat the poor academic standard in Nigeria may continue\nbecause there are no new contributions to knowledge (Saint\nAlthough these malpractices are rife in Nigeria, it must be\npointed out that some universities ensure the maintenance of\nhigh academic standard for both staff and students. For\nexample, some universities such as the University of Ibadan\nhave an established standard for appointing and promoting\nstaff and still stick to such a standard to date (University of\nsacked 44 lecturers due to their involvement in illicit prac-\ntices contrary to their call to duty (Ebegbulem, 2013).\nAlthough this can be regarded as a right step in the right\ndirection, the magnitude of different malpractices in the\nNigerian universities (public and private) contributes to\nincreasing irrationality in the system.\nAnother aspect of this calculability is the growing number\nof Honorary Doctorate Degrees (HDD) universities award to\npeople with questionable characters during convocations.\nBecause the number of HDD any university awards deter-\nmines the favor it will receive (monetary or otherwise) from\nthose honored, each university awards HDD to those who\nhave never affected the society positively or contributed to\nknowledge. This recently led to a call to suspend HDD in\nNigeria, and the Lagos State Government brought it to a halt\nin its state's university (Olufowobi, 2012).\nFurthermore, the Nigerian government in 2011 estab-\nlished nine more FGUs, again an aspect of calculability\nbecause no effort was made to build the infrastructure before\nthe commencement of the universities. As this is generating\ndebate among Nigerians, and people are questioning the\nrationale behind the establishment of the schools rather than\nstrengthening or expanding the existing ones (Olufowobi,\n2012), the government announced the establishment of\nanother three universities in December 2012 (\"FECApproves\nthat, in McDonald's restaurants, the size of the food may not\nbe commensurate with the quality, these new FGUs are\nworse than the former.\nPredictability in the Nigerian\nUniversities\nOne of the predictabilities in Nigerian universities is the uni-\nformity of \"National Curriculum,\" and a similar thing was\ninformed in the United Kingdom via the introduction of \"the\nthe Nigerian universities, courses, syllabuses, mode of grad-\ning, and so on are becoming the same. For example, courses\nare becoming standardized (through NUC) in Nigerian HE\nand this harmonized curriculum makes the faculty work with\n\"invisible scripts\" of which deviation, according to\nMcDonald's principles, will obstruct the smooth flow of pro-\nduction (Ritzer, 2000). This is arguably why most of the\ncourses are turning into garbage-in-garbage-out situations. A\nYear 2 student in a typical Nigerian university, for example,\ncan predict what he will be taught by merely glancing\nthrough the notes of any Year 3 student or by going through\nthe departmental handbook. This monotonous system gives\nlittle or no room for innovation, suffocates skills of lecturers\nand students, and makes \"accidental and spontaneous knowl-\nedge\" or discovery unlikely.\nPredictability is at play also in the NUC's routine accredi-\ntation exercise that takes place every 4 years to ensure mini-\nmum academic standards (Okojie, 2008). The timing of\naccreditation can be predicted, thus universities prepare for\nthe accreditation team at any cost when the exercise is near.\nBorrowing senior lecturers/professors from other schools as\nadjunct staff that may not retain their tenures after the accred-\nitation and promoting staff (who may not be due) are some of\nthe ways this can be done. In fact, the process of HE in\nNigeria can be predicted from start to finish. For example, as\none leaves secondary school, the predicted next step is to sit\nfor JAMB, which will be followed by the Post-JAMB. After\nthis first stage, there follows clearance, payment of school\nfees, online registration, orientation, beginning of lectures,\nand so on, in that order.\nAnother aspect is the recent introduction of universities'\nbranded uniforms such as T-shirts, caps, and so on, in some\nNigerian universities. In Nnamdi Azikiwe University\n(UNIZIK), for instance, students can predict what their lec-\nturers and nonacademic staff will wear to school every\nWednesday. This is because the management has made it\ncompulsory for staff to buy and don the university's branded\nT-shirt and cap, with stiff penalties for defaulters. This may\nappear to promote the unity of the system, but according to\nauthenticated by the fact that UNIZIK's management out-\nlawed the Labor Union for over 10 years before bowing to\nControl in the Nigerian Universities\nGovernance and management interference:\nRitzer (2000) claims that humans are most unpredictable,\nthus McDonald's replaces them with nonhuman technology\nthat can be regulated at ease. In Nigerian universities, control\nis extant where different types of human and nonhuman tech-\nnologies have been employed to control the faculty. From the\ninception of universities in Nigeria, academics enjoyed par-\ntial academic autonomy, but this was short-lived following\nthe intervention of the military in the Nigerian politics in\n1966. Successive military administrations in Nigeria gradu-\nally erased university autonomy both in the FGUs and in the\nSGUs, making the Vice Chancellors puppets (Erinosho,\nIn fact, Odebiyi and Aina (1999) report that many univer-\nsities were previously run by the military SoleAdministrators.\nWith military in power, HE received little funding and there\nwas a reckless abandon of universities' infrastructure\n(Okebukola, 2006) while research was neglected due to lack\nof research grants and funding (Odebiyi & Aina, 1999), lead-\ning to the exodus of academics in search of greener pastures\nto a point where academics were either incarcerated or\nsacked for striking against government neglect of HE\n(Odebiyi & Aina, 1999). A good example of lack of auton-\nomy was the mass dismissal of 41 lecturers of the Obafemi\nAwolowo University Ife in 2001 because they were involved\ninASUU's strike. To date, the situation has not changed, irre-\nspective of the fact that the Federal Ministry of Education\nproposed a bill to ensure academic autonomy to the faculty\nAutonomy was further eroded via the evolvement in 1974\nof the NUC (NUC, 2012); a centralized body with govern-\nment-backed power, charged with the duties of spearheading\nthe universities' affairs. This according to Saint et al. (2003)\nwas a reflection of the military structure that constituted it,\nbut the structure remains to date. Furthermore, the establish-\ndled with the responsibilities of reforming and reviewing the\nuniversities' curriculum (Okojie, 2008), leading to\nthe increasing managerial interference and other activities of\nthe NUC such as curriculum harmonization and monitoring,\nfurther serious threats to academic freedom in Nigerian uni-\nversities. This is because management makes decisions\nor implements government's policies with little or no\nconsultation with the faculty. In many Nigerian universities,\nacademics are employed by management without any input\nfrom the faculty. Thus, those who would have had no busi-\nness being in academia are employed by their friends or rela-\ntives and imposed on the faculty. Another part of this recent\noccurrence is that universities are beginning to prefer the\nemployment of contract and adjunct staff to cut costs. This is\nlikely to culminate in the preference for hourly paid lecturers\nbecause McDonaldized businesses require flexible work-\nEven the President and the State Governors have the final\nsay on the appointment of Vice Chancellors (Ekundayo &\nAdedokun, 2009) in the FGUs and SGUs while the entrepre-\nneurs appoint and dismiss the Vice Chancellors and lecturers\nin the PUs. This increasing monitoring and managerial inter-\nference internally and externally where the faculty is striped\nof academic autonomy will soon turn Nigerian universities\nto what has been described as the \"McUniversity\" (Parker &\nJary, 1995). In an academic environment where the faculties\nare regularized and overloaded with responsibilities (De Vita\n& Case, 2003) without commensurate salary, the result is\noutright \"collective demoralization\" of the workers\n(Wilkinson, 2006, p. 94). In fact, the civic and social losses\nimplicated in this nutritional starvation offered by\nMcDonaldization of HE in Nigeria are immense. For\ninstance, this continuous interference, control, and neglect\nhave often resulted in several conflicts and strikes (internal\nand external) in many Nigerian universities leading to the\nclosure of such institutions for several months. This can be\nauthenticated by the fact that due to government neglect and\nfailure to fund infrastructural development in Nigerian HE or\nkeep to its promise, ASUU recently embarked on strike in\nJuly 2013 that lasted for 5 months (\"Nigeria University\nLecturers ASUU Calls of Strike,\" 2013). This and other pre-\nvious strikes have left the Nigerian HE to suffer intellectu-\nally (because of exodus of academics to other countries and\nother related reasons), morally, democratically and most\nimportantly in international ranking (no Nigerian university\nat present ranks among the best 1,000 universities in the\nworld).\nConclusion\nThis article revealed evidence showing that Nigerian univer-\nsities are becoming fully McDonaldized and that this has\noccurred since HE was deregulated in 1999. Although the\nimport of privatization and rationalization of HE may be\nparamount to the government, this article has revealed that\nmany shortcomings accompany a McDonaldized system and\nthis may have been neglected by the policy makers.\nTherefore, the government should increase university fund-\ning instead of relying on the private sector to solve the prob-\nlems in its HE because the latter may only seek profit without\nproducing quality graduates. There should be strict monitor-\ning of the PUs to ensure that they employ qualified\nmanpower to teach their students, and inflation of marks\nshould be checked. This must be a matter of urgency because\ninternationally, it has been reported that privatizing HE does\nnot always produce quality. For example, Tilak (1991) notes\nthat \"the higher quality of private education compared with\npublic higher education is exaggerated\" because \"private\nuniversities are found to employ more retired, part-time, and\nunder-qualified teachers in Japan, Columbia, Brazil,\nArgentina and several other countries\" (p. 230). Because\nprivatization (a global phenomenon) itself is a brainchild of\nWorld Bank often imposed on countries to qualify for loan\nfacilities (Patrinos, 1990), it should not be solely relied on to\nremedy the problems in the Nigerian HE.\nThe government should grant the autonomy it promised\nNigerian universities in 2000, so that faculty can have input\nto the universities' curriculum, be involved in the employ-\nment of academics and other affairs without fear of losing\ntheir tenures.\nThe QA in the NUC should not just carry out govern-\nment's directives without wide consultation with academics.\nThis is because such may lead to resentment as it did in\ncation policies are made without involving the faculty who\nwill implement the policies, what happened in the\nMcDonaldized Nigerian banking sector that engendered job\ninsecurity (see Dumbili, 2013a) and other irrationalities may\nwell occur in Nigerian academia (Dumbili, 2013c). Policy\nmakers and other government allies interested in the Nigerian\nHE should understand that even though erosion of academic\nautonomy via government interference is becoming a global\nphenomenon, it must be noted that \"global trends are pro-\nmoted, resisted and negotiated differently in each national\ncontext and in each individual institution\" (Torres &\ncurriculum, and centralized control should be rethought by\nthe NUC in a way that both the rationalizers and academics\nwill benefit. One such way this can be done is to involve\nacademics in policy formulation. Again, Nigerian policy\nmakers should learn from countries such as Singapore that\nfirst of all equipped their people, especially academics \"with\ncreative and critical thinking so as to make them change-\nadaptive individuals . . . in other to prepare for the challenges\nof future\" before implementing diverse policies in the HE\nMore staff should be employed on a full-time basis rather\nthan on contract terms. This will help reduce the stress most\nof the faculties currently experience due to the increasing\nworkload. For its part, ASUU should begin to resist the casu-\nalization of academia, otherwise policy makers may\nsoon introduce hourly paid lecturers in GUs because\nMcDonaldization engenders labor commodification that\nleads to low pay, poor working conditions, and job\ninsecurity.\nThe reification of technology and ODL should be recon-\nsidered because most students do not actually acquire sound\nknowledge (Miller, 2010), and most drop out due to the high\ncost. The increasing emphasis on the number of publications\ninstead of their quality should be discouraged if the standard\nof research output is ever to increase in Nigeria. The empha-\nsis on market-driven degrees should be reconsidered, and\nstudents should be discouraged from seeing themselves as\ncustomers because they may soon begin to decide who\namong the academics should be employed, retained, or\ndismissed.\n"
