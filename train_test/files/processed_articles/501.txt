Data were obtained from\nthe US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) to illuminate circumstances related to homicide\namong children aged 4 years or less, and to identify demographic groups which may be at increased risk.\nMethods: The NVDRS is an active surveillance system that provides comprehensive information on all\nviolent deaths that occur within participating states within the US. Standard statistical tests were conducted\nto determine homicide rates among children ages 0\u00ad4 across states that provided data for both 2003 and\n2004 (Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia). These data\nwere further used to investigate infant/child homicides by race, gender, and other relevant circumstances\n(for example, victim-suspect relationship, weapon type, and location of homicide). A Poisson regression\nmodel was fitted to the sample data to investigate the multivariate relationship between the infant/child\nhomicide rate and available demographic information.\nhomicide rate was 2.5 per 100 000 population. African Americans were 4.2 times as likely as whites to\nbe victims of homicide. Suspects were commonly parents/caregivers. The vast majority of infant/child\nhomicides occurred in houses or apartments, using weapons that include household objects.\nConclusion: Homicides of infants and young children are most often committed in the home, by parents/\ncaregivers, using ``weapons of opportunity''. This suggests that the risk of infant/child homicide is greatest\nwithin the primary care giving environment. Moreover, the use of ``weapons of opportunity'' may be\nindicative of maladaptive stress responses. Prevention and intervention strategies to reduce infant/child\nhomicide should target the home environment and attend to maladaptive stress responses.\nHomicide is the leading cause of infant deaths due to\nreported homicides of children between zero and four\nyears of age.1 3 4 The risk for homicide is greater in infancy than\nin any other year of childhood before the age of 15 years.3\nPrior research suggests that the vast majority of perpe-\ntrators of infant/child homicide are female, most often the\nmother.2 3 As such, certain maternal characteristics have been\ncited as well established risk factors for infant/child\nhomicide: age 19 or younger; single marital status; 12 or\nfewer years of education; previous births; and late initiation\nof prenatal care.3 5\u00ad7 Further, infant characteristics associated\nwith infant homicide include low birth weight, low gesta-\ntional age, low Apgar scores, and male sex.8\u00ad10\nUsing data obtained from the National Violent Death\nReporting System (NVDRS), the current study explores the\ncircumstances and characteristics of homicide among chil-\ndren aged four years or less.\nMETHODS\nThe NVDRS is an active state based surveillance system that\nprovides comprehensive information on all violent deaths\nwithin participating states within the US. Seven states\n(Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon,\nSouth Carolina, and Virginia) provided data to the NVDRS\nin 2003. Six additional states (Colorado, Georgia, North\nCarolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) provided\ndata to the NVDRS in 2004. In the current study, we report\nonly on the seven states that began providing data in 2003.\nThe NVDRS defines violent death as death resulting from\nan intentional act (for example, poisoning) and/or the\nintentional use of physical force or power against oneself or\nanother person. This includes homicides, suicides, and legal\nintervention deaths. Unintentional firearm related deaths\nand deaths of undetermined intent are also included in the\nNVDRS. Legal executions and acts of war are excluded. The\nprimary data sources for the NVDRS are death certificates,\ncoroner/medical examiner records, police records, and crime\nlab data. Secondary, optional data sources include child\nfatality review team findings, supplementary homicide\nreports, hospital records, emergency department data, and\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)\ntrace information on firearms. The NVDRS makes a unique\ncontribution to injury surveillance in that information on\ncircumstances related to suicide, undetermined deaths,\nhomicides, and unintentional firearm injuries are contained\nin a single database.\nStatistical methods\nWe determined the homicide rate among children aged four\nyears and under across participating states. In addition,\ninfant/child homicide rates were stratified by race, gender,\nand other relevant circumstances and conditions (for\nexample, victim-suspect relationship, weapon type) to enable\nexamination of stratum specific variations in rates. Further,\nwe fit a Poisson regression model to investigate the multi-\nvariate relationship between the infant/child homicide rate\nand available demographic information and to facilitate\nsimultaneous statistical adjustment for the effects of all\nvariables of interest. Denominator data were obtained from\nAbbreviations: CFR, Child Fatality Review; NVDRS, National Violent\nDeath Reporting System.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nthe National Center for Health Statistics.11 We determined the\npercentage of homicides with particular suspect-victim\nrelationships, weapons, and location of homicide. To incor-\nporate into the estimation process an allowance for random\nvariability in the observations, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)\nwere generated relative to all percentages and parameter\nestimates. CIs for rates were calculated using asymptotic\nRESULTS\nWe report homicide rates, victim-suspect relationship,\nweapons used in homicide, and location and timing of\nhomicides.\nHomicide rates\nNVDRS recorded a total of 129 deaths of children aged four\nyears or less across the seven states that reported data in both\n51% of homicide victims age four years or less. As shown in\nTo investigate the multivariable relationship among homi-\ncide rate and certain demographic characteristics, we fit a\nPoisson regression model, with number of homicides as the\ndependent variable and, as independent variables, year of\nlevel), female), race (African American (reference level),\nwhite, and other), and all two-way interactions. All multi-\nvariate analyses also accounted for state-specific variations in\ninfant homicide rates by treating state as a seven-level factor\nin the Poisson regression models. We used backwards\nstepwise regression to identify statistically significant vari-\nables.\nIn the multivariate model, only race and the factor\nrepresenting state-specific variations in infant homicide rates\nremained after stepwise regression. Controlling for the effects\nof other factors, African American infants were 4.2 times\nthan white infants. Previous studies have found that male\ngender is a risk factor. If we do not control for state, gender\neffects are significant. State specific variation in homicide\nmight be a confounder of the association between gender and\nhomicide victimization.\nVictim-suspect relationship\nWe also explored the victim-suspect relationships for\nhomicides of children aged four years or less by race and\noften the primary suspects, followed by family acquaintances\nand friends. Parents and other caregivers were identified as\nthe primary suspect(s) in 52% of homicides involving African\nAmerican female infants and young children, and 49% of\nhomicides involving African American male infants and\nyoung children. In comparison, parents were identified as the\nprimary suspect in 50% of homicides involving white male\ninfants and young children, and 39% of homicides involving\nwhite female infants and young children (see table 2).\nMoreover, the overall rate of homicides by parents/guardians\nWhile the percentage of homicides in which parents or\nother caregivers were suspects was similar across most of the\ncomparison groups (white females were the exception,\ndisplaying the only percentage that did not approach or\nsurpass 50%), comparisons of homicide rates did however\nreveal that the risk of being killed by a parent or other\ncaregiver was greater for African Americans than for whites.\nThe risk of an African American male infant/child dying in a\nhomicide for which a parent or other caregiver was the\nfor white males and 5.8 times greater than the risk for white\nhomicide by parent(s) were observed among African\nAmerican females. Compared to white males and females,\nthe risks of being killed in a homicide in which a parent or\nFamily acquaintances and friends were also suspects in a\nsizeable portion of homicide deaths among those aged 0\u00ad4\nyears. Family acquaintances and friends were identified as\nsuspects in 30% of homicide deaths involving white female\ninfants/children, and 28% of homicide deaths involving white\nmale infants/children. In comparison, family acquaintances\nand friends were identified as suspects in 24% of homicides\ninvolving African American female infants and young\nchildren, and 12% of homicide deaths involving African\nAmerican male infants and young children.\nWe found no significant differences in the rates of\nhomicides in which acquaintances/friends were suspects for\nAfrican American male, white male, and white female\ninfants/children. However, our findings indicate that\nAfrican American females were 3.9 times more likely to die\nin a homicide in which a family acquaintance/friend was a\nWeapon type\nThe NVDRS weapon-type categories include firearms, blunt\ninstruments (for example, club or bat), sharp instruments\n(for example, knife, razor, broken glass, etc), poisoning,\nhanging (including strangulation and suffocation), personal\nweapons (for example, fist, feet, hands). Weapons not\ncorresponding to any of the aforementioned categories were\ndesignated ``other.'' In 2003\u00ad04 ``other'' weapons constituted\nthe most common weapon type for homicide perpetration.\nWeapons designated as ``other'' were cited in 32% of\nTable 1 Number of deaths for children ages 0\u00ad4\nYear Deaths\n*Presented figures are for Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey,\nOregon, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\u00c0Rates not reported due to small cell sizes.\nii40 Bennett Jr, Hall, Frazier Jr, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nhomicides involving infants and young children 0\u00ad4 years of\nage.\nOverall, 16% of the infant/child homicides involved blunt\ninstruments. Within this particular weapon category, African\nAmerican male infants/children accounted for 21% of\nhomicide victims. African American females accounted for\n18% of homicide victims in this weapon category. Twelve\npercent of white males and 9% of white females were victims\nof homicide via blunt instruments.\nThe relative risks for homicide using blunt instruments\nshow that African American male infants/children were 6.0\ntimes more likely to be slain by blunt instruments than white\nfemales the risk of being slain by a blunt instrument was 5.0\ntimes greater than the risk for their white female counter-\ndifferences in the rates of homicide via blunt instruments for\nAfrican American males and females.\nPersonal weapons were used in 16% of all infant/child\nhomicides. African American male infants/children\naccounted for 18% of these homicide victims. White male\ninfants/children accounted for 16% of homicide victims via\npersonal weapons followed by white females who accounted\nfor 13% of homicide victims in this weapon category. Lastly,\nAfrican American female infants/children accounted for 12%\nof homicide victims due to the use of personal weapons.\nAfrican American male infants/children were 4.1 times\nmore likely to be murdered with personal weapons than\nAmerican male infants and young children were 6.5 times\nmore likely to suffer homicide victimization via personal\nwe found that the risk of being killed with a personal weapon\namong African American female infants and young children\nwas 5.0 times greater than that of white females (95% CI 1.0\nto 20.1). We observed no significant differences in terms of\nthe risks for homicide via personal weapons among African\nAmerican males and females, nor for African American\nfemales when compared to white males.\nFinally, NVDRS data indicate that firearms were used in\nonly 5% of the homicides of children aged four years and\nunder. However, it should be noted that African Americans\ninfants and young children were again overrepresented as\nvictims. In 2003\u00ad04, all firearms related infant/child homicide\nvictims were African American.\nMultiple victims\nyoung children involved multiple victims. Moreover, multiple\nvictims were involved in 7% of homicides in which weapons\ndesignated as ``other'' were used. Further, multiple victims\nwere involved in 4% of homicides where blunt instruments\nused and 44% of homicides involving a combination of\nweapons.\nThree of these multiple victim incidents occurred within\nthe context of intimate partner violence, three others\noccurred as the result of arguments, and one was precipitated\nby robbery. Arson was cited as the cause of death for one\nvictim while another victim was murdered during an assault.\nThe specific circumstances surrounding the deaths of four\ninfants were unknown.\nLocation and timing\nHomes and apartments including driveway, porch, or yard\nwere the most frequent locations/places where infant/child\nhomicide occurred. Public highways, streets, roads, as well as\ncommercial, recreational, and natural areas were locations\nwhere at least one homicide occurred. Overall, 97% of infant/\nThe percentage of deaths occurring in this location varied\nminimally across racial groups ranging from 91% among\nAfrican American male infants/children, to 100% for both\nAfrican American and white female infants and young\nchildren.\nCrude rate comparisons reveal that African American male\ninfants and young children were 3.3 times more likely to be\nkilled in homes or apartments than their white male\nAmerican male infants and young children were 4.3 times\nmore likely to be killed in these locations than white female\ninfants and young children (95% CI 2.5 to 7.3). Similarly, for\nAfrican American females aged four years and under, the\nprobability of being murdered in a home or apartment was\n2.8 to 8.3). Lastly, prior studies have suggested that certain\ndays of the week may be linked to a greater number of\nhomicide occurrences among certain populations.14 15\nTable 2 Select incident characteristics: frequency and percentage by race and sex*\nCharacteristic\nWhite African American Other\nMales Females Males Females Males Females\nVictim-suspect relationship\nWeapon type\nLocation\nTransport area \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad 1 3 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nCommercial area \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad 1 3 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nResidential institution \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad 1 3 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\n*Presented figures are for Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia.\nColumns may not add due to rounding.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nHowever, we found no evidence of such a pattern for this age\ngroup.\nDISCUSSION\nImplications for prevention\nInfant/child homicide is a serious issue. It is essential that the\npublic health community continue to develop and refine\nprevention and intervention strategies aimed at curtailing the\nincidence and prevalence of this phenomenon. In order to\ndevelop appropriately targeted infanticide prevention and\nintervention programs, it is vital to have an informed\nknowledge of risk factors associated with this outcome.\nSuch efforts may be bolstered by the use of information\nregarding the circumstances, events, and conditions related\nto infant/child homicide.\nThe current study identified the importance of the NVDRS\nas a surveillance tool, and why it should be considered in\nfuture analyses related to the study of child maltreatment in\ngeneral and infant/child homicide in particular. The use of\nNVDRS data allowed for a broad examination of the\ncircumstances, conditions, and patterns related to infant/\nchild homicide across all participating states. Few surveil-\nlance data are able to provide information pertaining to\nvictim-suspect relationships, weapon type, multiple victims,\nlocation, and timing in the study of infant/child homicide.\nHence, the NVDRS should continue to be developed and used\nto monitor patterns and possible trends related to infant/child\nhomicide.\nCircumstances and characteristics\nNVDRS data indicate that African American infants and\nyoung children are at substantially greater risk for homicide\nvictimization than are their white counterparts. Moreover,\ninfant/child homicides were primarily perpetrated either by\nparents or friends and acquaintances and committed with\nweapons designated as ``other''. Lastly, the majority of these\noffences occurred in a home or an apartment. These findings\ncorroborate prior research which asserts that infants and\nyoung children are most often murdered by those who are\ncharged with, and/or responsible for their care and that\nhomicides among this population are concentrated in\nprimary care-giving environments.2 16\nWithin the context of the NVDRS, the designation ``other''\nincludes household items that because of close proximity or\naccessibility may be used as weapons of opportunity. This\nmight indicate that a sudden loss of temper may play a\nnoteworthy role in homicides among infants and young\nchildren.17 It is plausible that some individuals are simply\nunable to effectively cope with the demands and pressures of\ndaily living and thus lash out in anger that unfortunately\nresults in the death of a child. Certainly, the responsibility\nand care for young children can be extremely demanding.\nThis, along with other duties, commitments, and responsi-\nbilities may over-tax individuals who have less than adequate\ncoping resources, including lack of help-seeking behaviors\nand social support networks.\nHigh risk groups\nAfrican Americans and other minorities are disproportio-\nnately exposed to marginal socioeconomic conditions.8 10 18\nSuch conditions may compound the stressors associated with\nchildcare, deplete internal coping reserves, and make it\nextremely difficult to access resources (for example, personal\ncounseling services) that might reduce the likelihood of\ninfant/child homicide. Some researchers have explored this\nsupposition via the economic stress hypothesis which\npredicts maternal aggression and lethal violence in the\ncontext of economic stress.19 The comprehensive nature of\nthe NVDRS makes it a prime vehicle by which to more\nthoroughly explore this hypothesis.\nRecommendations\nTo reduce the potential for infant/child homicide, the public\nhealth community should use information like that provided\nby the NVDRS to identify emerging patterns and risk factors\nthat may portend this most unfortunate outcome.\nFurthermore, in light of the racial disparities discussed\nherein, it is essential that the public health community\ndevelop prevention and intervention efforts that are sensitive\nto and reflective of the populations with whom they are to be\nLimitations\nThe current study is subject to several limitations that can be\nattributed to the fluid nature of the NVDRS and the recent\nnature of its development and implementation. First, child\nabuse and maltreatment are widely acknowledged but largely\nuntested risk factors for infant/child homicides.20 In the\ncurrent investigation, the Child Fatality Review (CFR)\nrecords were examined in an effort to obtain additional\ninformation on the circumstances associated with infant/\nchild homicides. CFR records were available for only 13%\ninfant/child homicides in 2004. In those cases wherein a child\nfatality review was conducted, most contained responses of\nNo, Unknown, Not available, Not reported, Not collected, or were\nmissing variables that may have indicated a prior history of\nchild maltreatment within the victim's household. These\nfindings are due to the fact that the collection of CFR data is\ncurrently optional and also that only two states were funded\nto assess the availability and feasibility of collecting data\nfrom child fatality review teams. As a result, the CFR data\ncannot currently be used to extend our knowledge of the\ncircumstances surrounding homicides among infants and\nyoung children. It is possible that the utility of this\ncomponent of the NVDRS will increase substantially if CFR\ndata are redefined as a primary NVDRS data element and\nsubsequently collected more widely by NVDRS member\nstates. The success of such an expansion would, nevertheless,\nhinge largely on availability (and standardization) of CFR\ndata for all child deaths. The data currently available pertain\nlargely to fatalities stemming from specific causes; the\nspecific cause given attention may vary by state and by the\ndata year of interest.\nMoreover, the data did not contain information on\nhousehold socioeconomic status when this study was\nconducted. Prior research has demonstrated a consistent link\nbetween socioeconomic status and rates of homicide. States\nwith large numbers of impoverished women of childbearing\nage tend to have high rates of infant/child homicide.4 18 19\nOngoing efforts to expand the scope of the geospatial and\neconomic data provided by the NVDRS will make it possible\nto eventually link NVDRS data to the zip codes of victims,\nsuspects, and incident locations. This information could then\nbe cross referenced with census tract data to obtain aggregate\ninformation pertaining to socioeconomic status. Such infor-\nmation may allow further exploration of the relationship\nbetween socioeconomic status and infant/child homicide.\nLastly, two final facts must be noted. First, while every\neffort is made to include all appropriate deaths, some might\nhave been missed or not entered into the system when the\npresent study was initiated. As a result it is suggested that the\ncurrent research be considered an interim look at the NVDRS.\nSecond, the presented rates and percentages only apply to the\nstates used in the study's central analyses, although it is\nplausible that the results are more broadly applicable.\nii42 Bennett Jr, Hall, Frazier Jr, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nAuthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nM D Bennett Jr, J Hall, L Frazier Jr, L Barker, Etiology and Surveillance\nBranch, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of\nViolence Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nAtlanta, GA, USA\nN Patel, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Office of Statistics and Programming,\nAtlanta, GA, USA\nK Shaw, United Behavioral Health, Atlanta, GA, USA\nThe findings and conclusions in this paper are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention.\nCompeting interests: none.\nREFERENCES\n1 United States Department of Justice.
