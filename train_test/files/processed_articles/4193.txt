    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe benefits of minimizing the costs of engaging in violent conflict are thought to have shaped adaptations for the rapid assessment\nof others' capacity to inflict physical harm. Although studies have suggested that men's faces and voices both contain information\nabout their threat potential, one recent study suggested that men's faces are a more valid cue of their threat potential than their\nvoices are. Consequently, the current study investigated the interrelationships among a composite measure of men's actual threat\npotential (derived from the measures of their upper-body strength, height, and weight) and composite measures of these men's\nperceived facial and vocal threat potential (derived from dominance, strength, and weight ratings of their faces and voices,\nrespectively). Although men's perceived facial and vocal threat potential were positively correlated, men's actual threat potential\nwas related to their perceived facial, but not vocal, threat potential. These results present new evidence that men's faces may be a\nmore valid cue of these aspects of threat potential than their voices are.\n",

How-\never, research reporting that men's fighting ability can be\nassessed from their faces, but not their voices, suggests that\nfaces may be a more valid cue of some aspects of men's threat\npotential than their voices are (Doll et al., 2014).\nIn light of Doll et al.'s (2014) recent findings for fighting\nability, we investigated the relationships among men's actual\nthreat potential and ratings of both their perceived facial and\nvocal threat potential. Men's actual threat potential was\nassessed via a composite measure derived from a principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) of their handgrip strength, height,\nand weight. Perceived facial and vocal threat potential were\nassessed via composite measures derived from PCAs of dom-\ninance ratings, strength ratings, and weight ratings of their\nfaces and voices, respectively. Men's handgrip strength, face\nphotographs, and voice recordings were collected on five sep-\narate occasions to ensure we obtained representative measures\nof men's strength, facial appearance, and vocal appearance.\nGiven Doll et al.'s (2014) findings, we predicted that the com-\nposite measure of men's threat potential would be more\nstrongly correlated with the composite measure of their per-\nceived facial threat potential than with the composite measure\nof their perceived vocal threat potential.\nMethod\neach completed five weekly test sessions as part of a larger\nstudy on possible relationships among hormone levels and\nvoice perceptions (Kandrik et al., 2016). In each of the five\ntest sessions, each participant first cleaned his face with\nhypoallergenic face wipes. A full-face digital photograph was\ntaken a minimum of 10 min later. Photographs were taken in a\nsmall windowless room against a constant background, under\nstandardized diffuse lighting conditions, and participants were\ninstructed to pose with a neutral expression. Camera-to-head\ndistance and camera settings were held constant. Participants\nwore a white smock covering their clothing when photo-\ngraphed. Photographs were taken using a Nikon D300S digital\ncamera and a GretagMacbeth 24-square ColorChecker chart\nwas included in each image for use in color calibration. Fol-\nlowing other recent work on social judgments of faces (e.g.,\nJones et al., 2015), face images were color calibrated using a\nleast-squares transform from an 11-expression polynomial\nexpansion developed to standardize color information across\nthe images (Hong, Luo, & Rhodes, 2001). Images were\nmasked, so that hairstyle and clothing were not visible and\nstandardized in size and orientation on pupil positions.\nIn each of the five test sessions, a digital voice recording of\neach man was taken in mono using an Audio-Technica\nAT-4041 cardioid condenser microphone at a sampling rate\nof 44.1 kHz at 16-bit amplitude quantization. Each man was\ninstructed to say \"Hi, I'm a student at the University of\nGlasgow\" in their normal speaking voice. The word \"hi\" was\nthen extracted from each recording for use in the rating part of\nthe study. The sound pressure level of all voices was amplitude\nnormalized to 70 dB using the root mean squared method.\nIn each of the five test sessions, each man's handgrip strength\nwas measured 4 times using a T. K. K. 5001 Grip A dynam-\nometer, alternating between the dominant (M \u00bc 42.15 kgf,\n6.83 kgf) hand. Two men were left-handed and 42 were right-\nhanded. In addition, each man's height (M \u00bc 178.5 cm, SD \u00bc\nsured in one of the test sessions. Height, weight, and handgrip\nstrength have been previously used to assess men's threat poten-\ntial (e.g., Puts, Apicella, & Cardenas, 2012).\nNext, the face photographs of the 44 men (220 face photo-\ngraphs in total) and the voice recordings of the 44 men (220\nvoice recordings in total) were rated for dominance, strength,\nand weight using 1 (low) to 7 (high) scales. Faces and voices\nwere presented in separate blocks of trials, and dominance,\nstrength, and weight were rated in separate blocks of trials,\nrespectively. Trial order was fully randomized within each\nblock. None of the traits were defined for the raters and height\nwas not rated. Thirty-two men and 47 women (mean age \u00bc\nnumber of traits that each rater rated varied across raters. Each\nindividual rater was randomly allocated to rate between two\nand four blocks of trials (mean number of raters per block of\nage. Interrater agreement was high for all combinations of trait\nand stimulus type (all Cronbach's as > .89). Consequently, we\nface and voice. Separate analyses of men's and women's rat-\nings showed the same pattern of significant results as analyses\nof these combined ratings. Intercorrelations among ratings for\neach combination of trait and stimulus type across test sessions\nare given in our supplemental materials.\nResults\nFirst, we subjected the ratings of men's faces to PCA with\nno rotation. This analysis produced a single component that\nexplained approximately 75% of the variance in scores and was\nhighly correlated with facial strength (r \u00bc .98), dominance (r \u00bc\n.91), and weight (r \u00bc .67) ratings. We labeled this component\nthe perceived facial threat potential component.\nNext, we subjected the ratings of men's voices to PCA with\nno rotation. This analysis produced a single component that\nexplained approximately 82% of the variance in scores and was\nhighly correlated with strength (r \u00bc .98), dominance (r \u00bc .88),\nand weight (r \u00bc .85) ratings. We labeled this component the\nperceived vocal threat potential component.\nWe also subjected our four measures of men's threat poten-\ntial (handgrip strength for dominant hand, handgrip strength for\nnondominant hand, height, and weight) to PCA with no rota-\ntion. This analysis produced a single component that explained\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\napproximately 60% of the variance in scores and was highly\ncorrelated with handgrip strength for nondominant hand (r \u00bc\n.93), handgrip strength for dominant hand (r \u00bc .89), weight\n(r \u00bc .68), and height (r \u00bc .54). We labeled this component the\nactual threat potential component.\nScores on the perceived facial threat potential component\nwere positively correlated with scores on both the perceived\nand the actual threat potential component (r \u00bc .32, N \u00bc 44, p \u00bc\n.033). Scores on the perceived vocal threat potential component\nand the actual threat potential component were not signifi-\n(1980) test showed that the correlation between the actual\nthreat potential component and the perceived facial threat\npotential component was significantly stronger than the corre-\nlation between the actual threat potential component and the\nperceived vocal threat potential component (z \u00bc 1.97, p \u00bc\n.049). A table of intercorrelations among all variables is shown\nin our Supplemental Materials.\nDiscussion\nPCA of men's handgrip strength, weight, and height produced a\nsingle \"actual threat potential\" component. This result is con-\nsistent with previous work, suggesting that these measures are\npositively correlated indices of men's threat potential (Puts,\nApicella, & Cardenas, 2012). Moreover, PCAs of the face and\nvoice ratings each revealed a single perceived threat potential\ncomponent. This result is consistent with previous research,\nsuggesting that the impressions of men's strength, dominance,\nand body size are positively intercorrelated (e.g., Holzleitner &\nPerrett, 2016). Further analyses showed that men's perceived\nfacial threat potential was positively related to their scores on\nthe actual threat potential component. This result is consistent\nwith previous research, suggesting that men's faces contain\ncues to their actual threat potential (Burton & Rule, 2013; Doll\n2011). By contrast with our results for facial dominance, we\nfound no evidence that people could judge men's threat poten-\ntial from their voices. Our results then complement those of\nDoll et al. (2014), who found that men's fighting ability could\nbe better assessed from their faces than their voices. While Doll\net al. (2014) observed this pattern of results when men's threat\npotential was measured from acquaintances' ratings of their\nfighting ability, here we see the same pattern of results for the\nanalyses of anthropometric measures of men's threat potential.\nWhile some other studies with larger sample sizes have\nreported significant correlations between perceptions of men's\nvoices and measures of their threat potential (e.g., Sell et al.,\nthat men's faces are more valid cues to their threat potential\nthan their voices are. Because Doll et al. used full sentences as\ntheir voice stimuli, the pattern of results that we observed in the\ncurrent study is unlikely to be a consequence of the short snip-\npets of speech we used as stimuli.\nOne recent study found that the ratings of men's facial and\nvocal dominance were negatively correlated (Rezlescu et al.,\ncurrent study found that men's scores on the perceived facial\nand vocal threat potential components were positively and sig-\nnificantly correlated. In other words, our study found that men\nwhose faces looked particularly dominant possessed voices that\nsounded particularly dominant. The positive correlation\nbetween facial and vocal threat potential observed in the cur-\nrent study is consistent with other research reporting correla-\ntions between perceptions of faces and voices (reviewed in\nSmith, Dunn, Baguley, & Stacey, 2016) and suggests that\nmen's faces and voices contain some overlapping information\nabout their perceived threat potential. Our results suggest that\nthe overlapping information in the perceived dominance of\nmen's faces and voices is unlikely to include information about\ntheir upper-body strength, height, or weight. It is possible that\nthis correlation is driven by cues of men's aggressiveness or\nemotional state (e.g., anger), rather than threat potential, per se.\nIn our study, participants rated the faces and voices for\ndominance, strength, and weight. It is possible that weight rat-\nings of faces and voices are shaped by cues of adiposity, rather\nthan formidability, per se. However, the results of our PCAs\nshow that there is substantial overlap between weight, strength,\nand dominance ratings of men's faces (see also voices). Thus,\nwhatever information participants do use when they rate faces\nor voices for weight does seem to be highly correlated with the\ninformation that they use when making more direct assess-\nments of formidability (strength and dominance ratings).\nA further unresolved question is what specific facial character-\nistics are valid cues of men's threat potential. To date, most\nresearch addressing this question has focused on facial mea-\nsurements of putative sexually dimorphic aspects of facial mor-\nphology. Such measures may be error prone in 2-D images,\nhowever, due to difficulties controlling for head tilt, among\nother factors (e.g., Schneider, Hecht, & Carbon, 2012).\nIn summary, we found that a composite measure of men's\nactual threat potential (derived from measures of their upper-\nbody strength, height, and weight) was positively correlated\nwith a composite measure of these men's perceived facial, but\nnot vocal, threat potential (derived from dominance, strength,\nand weight ratings of their faces and voices, respectively).\nTogether with Doll et al.'s (2014) results for men's fighting\nability, these findings suggest that men's faces may be a more\nvalid cue to some aspects of their threat potential than their\nvoices are.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received financial support for the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article: This research was funded by a Eur-\nopean Research Council Starting Grant awarded to BCJ and an\nHan et al. 3\nOntario's Ministry of Research and Innovation's Early Researcher\naward to DRF.\nSupplemental Material\nThe online [supplements] are available at http://journals.sagepub.com/\nReferences\nBurton, C.
