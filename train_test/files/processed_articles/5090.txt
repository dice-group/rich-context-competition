Therefore, this transition period is\nan ideal time for preventive interventions to target alcohol use and related\nproblems.\nPurpose The purpose of this report is to describe the design and methods used in\nthe Transitions Project, a randomized controlled trial of two interventions designed\nto prevent and reduce heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related negative\nconsequences among incoming college students.\nMethods This study used a 2 \u00c2 2 factorial design to investigate the effects of a\ntwo-session brief motivational intervention delivered to students and a handbook-\nbased parent intervention. Interventions were administered to students and\nparents. Follow-up assessment took place at 10- and 22-months post-baseline.\nResults The Transitions Project successfully recruited and retained participants\nacross a major transition period (i.e., entering college), administered and compared\ntwo distinct but complementary interventions, and collected and analyzed highly\nskewed data. The application of a factorial design and two-part latent growth curve\nmodeling allowed us to examine main and interactive intervention effects in terms\nof both initiation and growth in heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems.\nLimitations While we conducted successful tests of our primary and secondary\nstudy hypotheses over a lengthy follow-up period, our study design did not permit\nfull interpretation of null findings. We suggest that researchers carefully consider\nassessment timing, tests of assessment reactivity, and ensure objective tests of\nintervention efficacy when conducting clinical trials of motivational interventions.\nConclusions The lessons we learned while conducting this trial have the potential\nto assist other researchers designing and conducting future preventive interventions\ntargeting parents and college students. The data analytic procedures presented can\nalso help guide trials that plan to analyze zero-inflated non-normal outcome\nBackground\nThe Transitions Project was a randomized\ncontrolled trial designed to examine the unique\nand combined effects of two preventive interven-\ntions to reduce heavy episodic drinking (HED) and\nrelated-harm among incoming college students.\nThe purpose of this report is to describe the\nmethodology of this trial and share the lessons\nlearned in terms of recruiting and retaining a large\nsample across a major transition period (i.e., enter-\ning college), administering and comparing two\ncomplementary interventions, and collecting and\nanalyzing zero-inflated non-normal data using a\nnovel data-analytic technique. The reduction of\nHED among college students is a national priority\n[1,2]. Over 70% of college students report using\nalcohol, and approximately 40% report HED\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA\nAuthor for correspondence: AC Fernandez, Department of Psychology, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA.\nE-mail: annefernandez@mail.uri.edu\n(typically defined as five drinks in a row for men\nand four for women) [3]. While alcohol use is\ncommon among late adolescents, the passage from\nhigh school to college is typified by an increase in\nalcohol consumption and associated negative\nconsequences [4\u00ad6]. Thus, the transition from\nhigh school to college represents a period of critical\nimportance with respect to preventing and reduc-\ning heavy drinking and alcohol-related negative\nconsequences.\nBrief motivational interventions are one-on-one\ncounseling sessions that utilize motivational inter-\nviewing and personalized feedback to facilitate\nchange in health-related behaviors. They are the\nmost empirically supported individual-level inter-\nvention for reducing alcohol use and problems\namong heavy drinking college students [7\u00ad13].\nWe expanded on past research by administering\nthe brief motivational intervention to college\nstudents with heterogeneous drinking experiences\nand extending assessment periods beyond 1 year.\nParent-based interventions are an emerging\napproach to prevent college student drinking.\nThese interventions target parents and promote\nparenting strategies associated with lower levels of\nalcohol use and problems in adolescence; they\nbuild on research indicating that parents exert a\ncontinued influence throughout the college years\n[14\u00ad17]. However, the potential beneficial role of\nparental influence on college student drinking has\nnot been widely investigated [18\u00ad22], despite a\nsubstantial body of research documenting the\nefficacy of family and parent-based substance use\ninterventions for younger adolescents [23\u00ad26].\nThis study\nThe Transitions Project was designed to simulta-\nneously examine a brief motivational and parent-\nbased intervention as a means to reduce the onset\nand growth of college student HED and alcohol-\nrelated consequences. A factorial design was chosen\nto examine complementary influences on college\nstudent drinking (parent and peer factors) [27] and\nto attempt to increase effect sizes and reduce cost\nby combining interventions in one stand-alone\nMethod\nThe Transitions Project used a 2 \u00c2 2 \u00c2 3 design\nwith two dichotomous between-subjects factors,\nbrief motivational intervention (yes, no) and\nparent-based intervention (yes, no), and one\nwithin-subjects factor (Time; pre-matriculation,\n10 months, 22 months). It was hypothesized that\nrelative to an assessment only control arm, the\nstudy interventions would reduce the initiation\nand growth of HED and consequences among\nincoming college students, and the intervention\neffect would be multiplicative; (i.e., combined\nintervention effects greater than the sum of the\nindividual effects). Secondary aims of this study\nincluded tests of intervention mediators such as\nchanges in descriptive norms, for the brief motiva-\ntional intervention, and changes in parental\nmonitoring, for the parent-based intervention.\nRecruitment and retention\nEligible students and their parents were recruited\nfrom two successive cohorts of incoming students\nat a mid-sized northeastern public university in the\nUnited States. All procedures were approved and\nmonitored by the university Institutional Review\nBoard (IRB).\nEligibility criteria\nThe target population for this research trial was\nmatriculating first year students ages 17\u00ad21 and\ntheir parents. Non-traditional students (e.g., older,\nmarried, returning, and transfer students) were not\neligible to participate because of the emphasis on\nparent communication within the home. Biological\nparents, stepparents, and legal guardians were\neligible to participate as long as they were living\nwith the student during the recruitment period.\nRecruitment and consent\nRecruitment took place by telephone in the\nsummer prior to college matriculation. Prior to\nthe first telephone contact, a detailed consent form\nand introductory letter were mailed to potential\nparticipants. For students who were under 18 years\nof age during the recruitment phase, an assent form\nas well as a parental permission letter was sent in\nlieu of the standard consent form. Upon telephone\ncontact, interested parents and students (ages\n18 and older) were asked to provide oral consent\nand complete the baseline assessment over the\ntelephone. Students who were 17 years old were\nrequired to provide oral assent and parental\nconsent over the telephone. In-person consent\nwas waived because recruitment took place before\nthe students arrived on campus. IRB approval for\noral consent was obtained in accordance with\n45 CFR 46 `Protection of Human Subjects,' Section\nGiven the power differential between parent and\nchild, we chose to recruit students prior to parents\nto minimize intentional or unintentional parental\npressure. All participants were informed that their\nparticipation was voluntary, and students were paid\nfor their baseline participation regardless of parent\nrecruitment. Confidentiality procedures did not\nguarantee complete anonymity for study participa-\ntion due to recruitment of family members within\nthe same household.\nIn an effort to recruit a gender-balanced parent\nsample, a mother or father was randomly chosen as\nthe initial recruitment target. If the pre-determined\nparent was unwilling or unavailable, another\nparent was accepted for recruitment (regardless of\ngender). We took this approach because fathers\nhave been under-represented in parent-based\nalcohol interventions with college students\nprofessional survey center which utilized compu-\nter-assisted telephone interviewing. Interviewers\nwere trained, certified, and monitored periodically\nin the proper application of standardized inter-\nviewing procedures and study protocols [31].\nInterviewers were blind to study arms.\nRandomization and retention\nStudent\u00adparent dyads were randomized to treat-\nment arms after consenting and completing the\nbaseline assessment. Our trial used standard proto-\ncols for subject tracking and multiple attempts to\ncontact participants in each follow-up period\nregardless of university enrollment status or partic-\nipation in previous assessments [32]. Home and\nlocal contact information was collected at baseline\nand confirmed at all time points. Two supplemen-\ntary contacts, i.e., people who would know the\nparticipants' whereabouts at all times, were\ncollected at each time point.\nIncentives\nStudents received $30 for completing the baseline\ninterview, $40 for completing the 10-month\nfollow-up procedures, and $50 after completing\nthe 22-month follow-up procedures. Participants\nwho attended all appointments and completed\nfollow-up procedures on time were eligible for $10\nfollow-ups, respectively. Three $200 cash prizes\nwere awarded annually to randomly selected\nstudent participants. Parents were offered $40 at\neach time point.\nAssessments\nStudent follow-ups took place at 10 and 22 months\nand were anchored according to the baseline\ncompletion date. Assessment time points were\nchosen to assess students while they were on\ncampus and capture long-term (>6 months) inter-\nvention effects rarely examined in past research.\nThe parent follow-up took place at 12 months post-\nbaseline and was timed to coincide with students\nreturn home for their first summer break in order to\nadequately assess parenting behaviors. All student\nassessments took place by telephone and lasted\napproximately 45\u00ad60 min. Parent follow-ups took\nplace by mail.\nInterventions\nBrief motivational intervention\nThe brief motivational intervention used in this\nstudy was modeled after the Brief Alcohol Screening\nand Intervention for College Students (BASICS)\nprogram [33] and included two counselor-\nfacilitated in-person interventions during the fresh-\nman year. The initial 1-h meeting took place in the\nfall, and the half-hour `booster' session took\nplace in the spring. Counselors (n \u00bc 16) were\nbachelor's- and master's-level psychology students\ntrained in motivational interviewing and interven-\ntion content. Training and weekly group\nsupervision were conducted by a PhD-level\npsychologist with years of experience in delivering,\nsupervising, and researching brief motivation\nA central component of the brief motivational\nintervention is the delivery of `personalized\nfeedback' to students regarding alcohol-related\nbehavior and beliefs. Feedback forms were created\nusing assessment data gathered approximately\n2 weeks prior to scheduled interventions (once in\nthe fall and once in the spring). Drinkers received\nfeedback on their current alcohol use and related-\nproblems as well as their drinking compared to\n`average students.' Abstainers received feedback on\nthe safety and health benefits of abstinence, their\nexperiences with second-hand effects of alcohol,\nand their abstinence-related self-efficacy. Booster\nsessions incorporated feedback on current and past\ndrinking to reflect change in alcohol-related behav-\nior since the initial evaluation. Clinicians were\ntrained to present all feedback using an empathic\nRandomized trials of alcohol-use interventions 207\nnon-confrontational style and students were given\nfeedback forms to take home.\nTo monitor intervention fidelity, the clinical\nsupervisor randomly selected 5\u00ad10% of audio tapes\n(50 for the initial fall intervention and 26 for the\nspring intervention), and coded them in their\nentirety using the Motivational Interviewing\nTreatment Integrity scale [34]. Written feedback\nwas provided to counselors. Session evaluation\nforms were also completed by students and coun-\nselors after each session to assess the quality and\ndelivery of intervention components. Evaluation\nforms were similar across time points.\nParent-based intervention\nThe parent-based intervention consisted of a\n32-page parent handbook which was mailed to\nparents in the summer before students matriculated\nto college. The handbook itself was modified from\nan original version [30] and included information\ndesigned to raise parental awareness of college\nstudent alcohol use and provide strategies to help\nreduce student drinking and associated conse-\nquences. These strategies included increasing\nparent\u00adteen alcohol-related communication and\nparental monitoring, and reducing parental\npermissiveness for drinking. A `booster' letter was\nmailed a year later that reviewed handbook\nconcepts and encouraged parents to continue to\nimplement strategies to reduce college student\nalcohol abuse.\nIn addition to the parent handbook, parents\nreceived a letter explaining the intervention, and a\nhandbook evaluation form. The letter informed\nparents that their evaluations were needed to assess\nand improve the handbook [30]. We hoped that\nthis letter would encourage all parents to read the\nmaterials and provide us with feedback. The eval-\nuation form served as our primary measure of\nintervention fidelity and assessed readability,\nusefulness, and clarity of the handbook. Parents\nwho did not return the evaluation by mail were\ncontacted via telephone by the survey research\ncenter.\nOutcomes and data analysis\nAt all time points, students were assessed regarding:\n(1) whether and how frequently they engaged in\nHED; (2) whether and how often they experienced\nalcohol-related negative consequences; and (3)\nhypothesized intervention mediators. Because our\nstudy was designed to enroll students with a range\nof alcohol-related experiences, our data contained\na large proportion of zero values (i.e., students who\ndid not drink) in addition to data reflecting very\nheavy drinking. To address this skew in our data\ndistribution, we chose to conduct our analysis\nusing two-part latent growth curve-modeling. This\ntechnique is well suited to address the heterogene-\nity arising from zero-inflated data by simulta-\nneously creating two correlated models from a\nsingle outcome variable; one model for the binary\n(onset) portion and one model for continuous (rate\nof change) portion of the variable's distribution\n[35,36]. In Part 1 (the binary portion), the outcome\nvariable is modeled as a random-effects logistic\ngrowth model with the log odds of use regressed on\ngrowth factors [37]. In Part 2 (the continuous\nportion), the non-zero continuous frequency of\nthe outcome is modeled using the latent growth\nmodel [38]. For this study, the binary part of the\nmodel estimated growth in onset of HED or\nconsequences (coded as 0 and 1). The continuous\npart of the model estimated change in the\nfrequency of HED or consequences for drinkers\nwho initially reported one or more instances of\nthese behaviors.\nAn important advantage of the two-part model\napproach over the censored normal model [39] for\nfitting discrete mixture models to longitudinal\nzero-inflated data [39,40] is the ability to estimate\nthe unique effects of covariates on each of the\ntwo parts even when they are correlated [37,38].\nTwo-part latent growth models, therefore, enable\nthe separate evaluation of intervention, mediating,\nand covarying factors on onset and growth of\noutcome variables. Thus, we were able to determine\nwhether our interventions affected mediators and\nwhether the mediators affected change in onset\nand growth of outcome variables. We estimated the\neffects of the brief motivational intervention, the\nparent-based intervention, and their interaction on\nall 10-month mediators regardless of an overall\nintervention effect to determine whether the\nintervention significantly changed the hypothe-\nsized mediator(s) in the desired direction\nand whether the mediator subsequently was\nrelated to the outcome measure in the predicted\ndirection. This analysis is especially important for\ndiscovering unexpected relationships that may\nmask an overall intervention effect due to suppres-\nResults\nSuccessful recruitment of a representative sample of\n1014 student\u00adparent dyads was achieved across\n2 cohort years with minimal refusal (Figure 1).\nUrn randomization produced equivalent groups at\nbaseline in terms of demographic and primary\noutcome variables.

Three dyads were removed because\nstudent participants began working at the survey center collecting data for this trial.\nRandomized trials of alcohol-use interventions 209\nInterventions\nIntervention delivery and fidelity\nAmong students randomly assigned to receive the\nreceived the initial intervention (85% in-person,\nbooster session (90% in-person and 10% by mail).\nMost students (!92%) endorsed key components of\nthe brief motivational intervention including high\nclinician rapport, empathy, and professionalism.\nEighty-eight percent indicated feelings of enhanced\nself-efficacy.\nAmong parents randomly assigned to receive the\nevaluation questionnaire by mail (n \u00bc 368) or tele-\nphone (n \u00bc 80). Approximately, 89% of responding\nparents reported being `very satisfied' or `mostly\nsatisfied' with the handbook as a whole and reading\n`most' or `all' of the material. The handbook\nchapters were rated as useful, interesting, and\nunderstandable by approximately 84% of parents.\nData collection and outcomes\nStudent data reflected a wide range of drinking\nbehavior across all time points. As anticipated, data\nfor the primary outcomes contained a large number\nof zero values (e.g., non-drinkers) and a large\nproportion of students engaging in HED and/or\nstudents reported abstaining from alcohol for at\nleast the past year, decreasing to 17% (n \u00bc 154) at\n22-month follow-up (percentages adjusted for attri-\ntion). Approximately, half of the baseline sample\n(51%, n \u00bc 517) reported no instances of HED in the\npast month, and the mean number of conse-\nquences experienced in the past 3 months was\nAs reported elsewhere [42], the brief motiva-\ntional intervention significantly reduced the onset\nof HED and alcohol-related consequences at 10 and\n22 months. However, the observed effects were\nsmall and the parent-based intervention did not\nreduce onset or growth of HED or consequences.\nEvidence for the combined intervention effects was\nlimited to alcohol-related consequences, with no\neffect observed for the combined intervention on\nHED. In terms of mediation, we found a consistent\nindirect brief motivational intervention effect\nthrough descriptive norms on both onset and\ngrowth in HED and consequences, but no evidence\nin support of hypothesized parent-based interven-\ntion mediators.\nLimitations and lessons learned\nWhile the Transitions Project was successful in\nmany respects, there are several limitations of this\ntrial. In attempting to evaluate potential explana-\ntions for null and modest intervention effects,\nseveral design issues initially considered in the\nplanning of this trial, re-emerged. Chief among\nthese include questions were: (1) did assessment\nreactivity take place among parents and/or\nstudents? (2) did our assessment schedule miss\ncritical short-term intervention effects?; and (3)\nwere our interventions delivered with fidelity?\nWe also have considered how these questions\ncould have been answered with alternative exper-\nimental designs and study procedures.\nThe potential for assessment reactivity to atten-\nuate or mask intervention effects is a serious and\ncommon problem in clinical research and is espe-\ncially problematic when the size of intervention\neffects is modest [40,43]. We believe our assessment\nprotocol, which included an in-depth assessment of\nprocess-related variables at baseline, may have\npotentially masked parent-based intervention\neffects by motivating control-group parents to\nengage in behavior that may have reduced alcohol\nuse among students. Previous research has sought\nto avoid this issue through the use of a post-test\nonly comparison design [30]. We opted for a\npre-test post-test design in order to better model\nchange over time. However, to disentangle inter-\nvention and assessment effects, an alternative study\ndesign is necessary, such as the Solomon Four\nGroup Design [44] which crosses two intervention\narms with baseline assessment (Yes/No). However,\nin most large clinical trials this approach is prohib-\nitively expensive and impractical. Newer, more\nefficient, methods for evaluating assessment\nreactivity are available which involve including\n`planned missingness' in the assessment\nAnother aspect of our study design that deserves\nconsideration is assessment timing. In the social\nsciences assessment, timing is often dictated by\nconvenience or tradition rather than empirically\nbased expectations regarding intervention effect\nperiods [46]. We reviewed relevant research and\nfound that intervention efficacy was well docu-\nmented through a 6-month follow-up period for\nbrief motivational interventions, with several\nexceptions [47,48]. For this reason, we decided to\nfocus on longer term outcome assessments to\ndetermine whether these interventions could\nproduce lasting change. The use of lengthy assess-\nments coupled with generous and increasing\nparticipation incentives enabled strong tests of\nthe primary and secondary aims but used a large\nproportion of study resources, thus limiting our\nability to afford a short-term assessment. Upon\ncompletion of this trial, we believe our null find-\nings reflect a failure to capture critical periods of\nshort-term intervention effects that decayed over\ntime. Therefore, we recommend using three follow-\nup time points in combination with a baseline\nassessment to detect long-term and short-term,\npotentially transient, intervention effects and to\nmodel non-linear (e.g., quadratic, piecewise)\neffects.\nOur lack of objective intervention fidelity\nmeasures is an additional limitation of this trial.\nSubjective measures of intervention fidelity\nemployed by this study indicated the interventions\nwere delivered as intended, but a lack of objective\nmeasures limits the strength of our inferences.\nConsistent with prior research [30], our parent\nhandbook evaluation asked parents whether they\nread and understood the intervention materials.\nParents may have provided socially desirable\nresponses; the non-anonymous nature of the\nassessment may have exacerbated this effect.\nSimilarly, participants in the brief motivational\nintervention were asked about clinician qualities\nand intervention components. Although their\nresponses were collected anonymously after\nsessions, the possibility of subjective biases cannot\nbe ruled out. In fact, our measures of intervention\nfidelity were relatively high and invariant across\nall categories for both interventions suggesting\nthe possibility of social desirability and ceiling\neffects.\nIdeally, future studies should examine the qual-\nity of intervention delivery using objective means,\nsuch as delivering the handbook online and track-\ning parent access. In terms of the brief motivational\nintervention, future trials should audio or video-\nrecord sessions and have them coded by at least two\nindependent reviewers. Detailed, more objective\nprocedures for assessing brief motivational inter-\nvention fidelity are available and increasingly\nexpected in clinical trials [49,50]. Nonetheless, our\nsupervision approach and the brief motivational\nintervention training we employed have been used\nin previous randomized controlled trials that\nobtained very good estimates of motivational\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, the Transitions Project had many\nstrengths, most notably the use of a factorial design\ncapable of testing unique and combined effects of\ntwo potentially complementary interventions and\nthe implementation of novel data-analytic tech-\nniques uniquely suited to our data. Limitations\nincluded our inability to explicate the extent to\nwhich assessment reactivity or the length of our\nfollow-up interval may help explain the lack of\nsupport for some study hypotheses.\nIn terms of study successes, a large sample of\nstudents and parents were recruited prior to college\nmatriculation. Consistent with other research\nworks, the use of monetary ballooning incentives\nand a highly trained survey center was likely\nintegral to recruitment and long-term retention\nparticipation were also high. Abstainers and drin-\nkers were willing to attend in-person interventions\nand parents were willing to read mailed interven-\ntion materials and return evaluation forms. These\nparticipation and retention rates should encourage\nfuture researchers who attempt to use similar\ntechniques and study similar populations.\nBy including abstainers in our study, we were able\nto examine intervention effects among an at-risk\nbut understudied group. The data complexity, the\nabstainers introduced (e.g., a high-zero count) was\nhandled using latent growth curve modeling as an\nalternative to traditional data transformation.\nAs published examples of two-part latent growth\ncurve modeling are limited, interested readers are\ndirected to our outcomes paper [42] and other\npublished studies using this technique [29,38].\nIn summary, the choice of experimental and\nquasi-experimental designs in randomized con-\ntrolled trials is a complex, multi-faceted endeavor\nwith inevitable tradeoffs. We hope that consider-\nation of the lessons we have learned and presented\nwill benefit those who undertake similar research in\nthe future.\n"
