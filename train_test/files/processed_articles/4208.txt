We have generated transgenic mice over-\nexpressing this protein (HuD-Tg) in adult DGCs (dentate\ngranule cells) and shown that their mossy fibres contain high\nlevels of GAP-43 (growth-associated protein 43) and exhibit\ndistinct morphological and electrophysiological properties.\nTo investigate the basis for these changes and identify other\nmolecular targets of HuD, DGCs from HuD-Tg and control\nmice were collected by LCM (laser capture microscopy) and\nRNAs analysed using DNA microarrays. Results show that 216\nknown mRNAs transcripts and 63 ESTs (expressed sequence\ntags) are significantly up-regulated in DGCs from these\ntransgenic mice. Analyses of the 39-UTRs (39-untranslated\nregions) of these transcripts revealed an increased number\nof HuD-binding sites and the presence of several known\ninstability-conferring sequences. Among these, the mRNA for\nTTR (transthyretin) shows the highest level of up-regulation,\nas confirmed by qRT\u00adPCR (quantitative reverse transcription\u00ad\nPCR) and ISH (in situ hybridization). GO (gene ontology)\nanalyses of up-regulated transcripts revealed a large over-\nrepresentation of genes associated with neural development\nand axogenesis. In correlation with these gene expression\nchanges, we found an increased length of the infrapyramidal\nmossy fibre bundle in HuD-Tg mice. These results support\nthe notion that HuD stabilizes a number of developmentally\nregulated mRNAs in DGCs, resulting in increased axonal\nelongation.\n",

This pattern of expression is\ncritical for proper neuronal differentiation, as shown by KO\n(knockout) and overexpression studies (Akamatsu et al., 2005;\nBolognani et al., 2006). Furthermore, recent studies also\ndemonstrate that HuD is required for mechanisms of learning\nand memory in mature hippocampus and peripheral nerve\nwith the role of HuD in developmental and adult plasticity,\ngenome-wide identification of its targets revealed that many of\nthese transcripts encode for proteins associated with axon\nguidance, actin dynamics and long-term potentiation\nWe have previously shown that DGCs (dentate granule\ncells) of the hippocampus express HuD mRNA and protein\nduring the first week of postnatal development (Bolognani\net al., 2007a).

Supporting this idea, we have shown that both\nHuD and GAP-43 are re-induced in DGCs of adult rats after\nepileptic seizures (Bolognani et al., 2007a) and that adult\ntransgenic mice in which HuD is overexpressed via the\naCaMKII (a-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II)\npromoter exhibit increased stabilization and accumula-\nFurthermore, mossy fibres of HuD-Tg exhibit increased PPF\n(paired-pulse facilitation) and increased sprouting of GAP-43\ncontaining terminals in the CA3 region (Tanner et al., 2008).\nTo further characterize the molecular targets and mechan-\nisms mediating the different properties of DGCs and their\nprojections in HuD overexpressor mice, we sought to identify\nthe mRNAs regulated by HuD in these cells using a combina-\ntion of LCM (laser capture microscopy) and gene expression\nprofiling. Our results clearly show an increased expression of\ndevelopment-associated genes in DGCs from adult HuD over-\nexpressor mice relative to age-matched control littermates.\nAnimals\nAll animal studies were approved by the University of New\nMexico Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to\nNIH (National Institutes of Health) guidelines for the use of\nanimals in research.

The number of transcripts with these\nsequences was compared with both the total number of\ntranscripts in the Affymetrix 430 2.0 array (Affy-chip) and\nthe top 500 expressed (present) transcripts in DGCs whose\nexpression levels were not significantly different between\nHuD-Tg and WT mice (DG-P500). As previously described\n(Bolognani et al., 2010), typical ARE sequences include: (i)\nconsensus AREs motifs described in the ARED (ARE database;\nARED 3.0, Bakheet et al., 2006, http://brp.kfshrc.edu.sa/ARED/),\n(ii) overlapping AUUUA motifs (AUUUA)n and (iii) the type I\nand II AREs described by Wilusz et al. (2001). Analysis of indi-\nvidual ARE sequences revealed that the percentage of transcripts\nwith (AUUUA)n and type II ARE motifs in the 39-UTR were\nsignificantly increased in HuD-DGCs (DG-up) relative to those\npresent in the DG-P500 set, whereas there were no differences\nin the percentage of other ARE motifs or GRE instability-sequences\n(Figure 3).\nSince HuD binds AU-rich and GU-rich sequences with high\naffinity and CU-rich sequences with less affinity (Bolognani\net al., 2010), we also investigated the presence of transcripts\nwith the three consensus-binding motifs for HuD: motif 1,\nUUUUUUUUUUAAA. As shown in Figure 3, while only 13% of\nall the transcripts in the chip and 14% of DG-P500 transcripts\ncontain the AUUUA-like motif 3 in the 39-UTR, the frequency\nof these sequences was significantly increased in HuD-Tg\nDGCs, reaching approximately 20% of all the up-regulated\ntranscripts. Likewise, we found significant increases in the\nGUUUG-like (motif 2) and UCCCU-like (motif 1), which reached\nto approximately 33% and 42% of all DGC overexpressed\ntranscripts, respectively (Figure 3). Overall we found that approxi-\nat least one of the HuD-binding motifs and 80% of DGC\ntranscripts (223/279) contained at least one of the AU-rich or\nGU-rich 39-UTR sequences described above (see Supplementary\nTable S1). Collectively, these findings suggest that the majority\nof HuD-DGCs transcripts were overexpressed because they\ncontain binding sites for this stabilizing RNA-binding protein.\nTo further illustrate this point, specific examples of mRNAs\ncontaining these 39-UTR motifs are shown in Table 2.

In contrast with HuR, mouse HuD transcripts were also\nincreased in the DGCs (Supplementary Table S1) in the presence\nof the human HuD transgene that does not contain the 39-UTR\nand thus cannot be detected by the mouse 39-UTR specific\nprobes present in the Affymetrix chip.

As shown in Figure 6(A), mossy\nfibres form two separate bundles: the SPB (suprapyramidal\nbundle) that travels above the CA3 pyramidal layer and the\nIPB that originates below this layer and later crosses it to\njoin the SPB (see arrows in Figures 6B and 6C). Mossy fibres\nwere stained using either antibodies against the calcium-\nbinding protein calbindin (Figure 6B) or the Timm' zinc stain\n(Figure 6C). The relative length of the IPB was calculated\nusing the length of the SPB as reference as described by Bagri\net al. (2003) (Figure 6C). As shown in Figure 6(D), the relative\nlength of the IPB was significantly increased in the HuD-Tg\nmice, supporting the results of the gene expression studies.\nOverall, our data indicate that HuD target mRNAs are impor-\ntant for the regulation of multiple aspects of development and\naxonogenesis. Furthermore, our data supports the hypothesis\nthat appropriate regulation of RNA-binding proteins is critical\nfor normal development and adult plasticity.\nDISCUSSION\nThe neuron-specific RNA-binding protein HuD plays a critical\nrole in the post-transcriptional regulation of neuronal gene\nexpression during neural development and adult synaptic\nplasticity. This protein is known to stabilize GAP-43 mRNA\nand other neuronal mRNAs containing U-rich sequences in\ntheir 39-UTR. In this study, we examined the effect of\noverexpression of this RNA-binding protein in DGCs of adult\nmice. Normally, these cells only express HuD during the first\npostnatal week. Our results indicate that persistent expression\nof HuD in adult DGCs induced the expression of devel-\nopmentally-regulated neural genes in these cells and\nincreased the length of their axons in the IPB. Together with\nprevious studies (reviewed by Perrone-Bizzozero and Bolognani,\n^nes-Furry et al., 2006), these results emphasize\nthe role of HuD in controlling the expression of genes impor-\ntant for neuronal development and axonal outgrowth.\nThe most drastic gene expression change in HuD-Tg mice\nwas a 50-fold increase in mRNA levels of the transporter of\nthyroxine and retinol, TTR. We confirmed this large over-\nexpression using ISH as well as qRT\u00adPCR.

Not surprisingly, TTR-null mice have\nbeen shown to contain only 36% of WT thyroid hormone\nlevels in their brains (Palha et al., 1997). The critical role of T3\nand TTR in hippocampal development and function is further\ndemonstrated by the findings that prenatal and neonatal\nhypothyroidism cause learning and memory defects, includ-\ning mental retardation in children (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004).\nAlthough thyroid hormone levels are important for growth\nand development, the protease activity of TTR might also\nhelp explain the increased axonal length that we observed.\nTTR has been shown to cause increased neurite outgrowth\nin PC12 cells incubated in medium from normal mice as\ncompared with PC12 cells incubated in medium from TTR KO\noutgrowth is reduced to TTR KO levels when the proteolytic\nactivity of TTR is inhibited (Liz et al., 2009), although the\nsubstrate responsible for increasing neurite growth has not\nbeen identified.\nAs shown in Figure 4 and Table 3, many up-regulated\ngenes encode proteins associated with axonal outgrowth (e.g.\nMapt, Mtap1b, Ncam2, Cacna1a, Ermn, Plxnb1 and Plxnb2),\nactin dynamics (e.g. Gsn, Myh14, Tagln2 and Tnnc1) and\nneuronal differentiation (e.g. Aplp2, Dcx, Neurog2, Notch3,\nup-regulated transcripts are known to be increased in the\nhippocampus during development (e.g. Sstr3; Stanic\n\u00b4 et al.,\n2009) or contextual fear conditioning (e.g. Itih5 and Edil3;\nKeeley et al., 2006). Besides, we noticed that the mRNAs for\na couple of axogenesis-related HuD targets, GAP-43 (also\nknown as neuromodulin) and cgp-15 (also known as neuritin;\nAkten et al., 2011), were not detected in the chip as being up-\nregulated. Although GAP-43 mRNA was detected by ISH in\nHuD-DGC (Bolognani, et al., 2006) and this mRNA was\nvalidated as a target of HuD by RNA-IP followed by qRT\u00adPCR\nTable 3 Genes in top enriched GO categories in DGCs of HuD-Tg mice\nProbe set ID Gene symbol Gene title\nPositive regulation of axogenesis\nAxon ensheathment\nCell development\nCell morphogenesis during differentiation\nNervous system development\nPositive regulation of development\nExpression of axogenesis genes in HuD-Tg mice\nE 2011 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(Bolognani et al., 2010), we have previously found that the\nsingle probe available in the mouse Affymetrix 430 2.0 chip\nshowed very low signal and failed to detect changes in this\ntranscript in both studies. In contrast, we found that the\nsignal of neuritin was very high in both control mice and\nHuD-Tg DGCs, suggesting that it may not be possible to\ndetect increases in its levels due to ceiling effects. Besides\nthe neuronally expressed axonal outgrowth-related proteins,\nsome of the HuD-DGC up-regulated transcripts were found to\nencode myelin proteins (e.g. Plp1, Mal, Mog, Mbp, Cldn11 and\nCnp). It is likely that these gene-expression changes take place\nin oligodendrocytes located in the DGC layer and constitute an\nindirect response to the increases in axonal length observed in\nthe HuD-Tg mice. Alternatively, although HuD is not normally\nexpressed in mature oligodendrocytes, the aCaMKII promoter\nused here to express transgenic HuD was shown to be active in\noligodendrocyte precursor cells (Mason et al., 2003). Thus, this\nactivity could account for some of the observed changes in\nmyelin gene expression. Finally, it is also well established that\nthyroid hormone increases myelination and re-myelination\nand promotes the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor\ncells (Bala\n1994) suggesting that the increased expression of TTR in HuD-\nTg mice may contribute to these effects.\nIn conclusion our results support the notion that persistent\nexpression of HuD in DGCs of transgenic mice has significant\nfunctional consequences on the differentiation and matura-\ntion of these cells, as shown by the increased mossy fibre\nlength in the IPB. These results are in agreement with our\nprevious findings of the effect of HuD overexpression on the\nwith observations from other laboratories supporting a role\nof Hu proteins in neuronal development (Wakamatsu and\nFurthermore, these findings are consistent with recent studies\ndemonstrating that the interaction of HuD with the SMA\n(spinal muscular atrophy) protein SMN (survival of motor\nneurons) is critical for localizing and stabilizing mRNAs in\nFigure 5 Biological network of genes involved in nervous system development\nIPA showing interactions of gene products from HuD-Tg overexpressed genes.
