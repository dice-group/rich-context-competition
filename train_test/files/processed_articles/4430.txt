Group\n1: untreated controls; Group 2: received TAA (200 mg/kg body weight (b.w.); i.p.) for 12 weeks; Group 3: received\nkg b.w.) for 12 weeks.\nResults: A significantly higher ACE gene expression was observed in TAA-induced groups as compared with control,\nindicating more synthesis of ACE proteins. Treatment with curcumin suppressed ACE expression in TAA liver and\nreversed the toxicity produced. TAA treatment results in higher lipid peroxidation and lower GSH, SOD and CAT than\nthe normal, and this produces oxidative stress in the liver. Cirrhotic conditions were confirmed by serum enzymes (ALT,\nAST and ALP) as well as histopathological observations.\nConclusion: Curcumin treatment reduced oxidative stress in animals by scavenging reactive oxygen species, protecting\nthe anti-oxidant enzymes from being denatured and reducing the oxidative stress marker lipid peroxidation. Curcumin\ntreatment restores hepatocytes, damaged by TAA, and protects liver tissue approaching cirrhosis.\n",

TAA produces selective renal tubular\nnecrosis, restricted to that portion of the proximal convo-\nluted tubule located in the inner half of the renal cortex. In\nthe development of TAA-induced toxicity, free radicals\nare thought to play a critical role.3 Therapeutic herbs and\ntheir principles of action have become a focus of attention\ndue to their anti-oxidant properties.4 Curcumin is a poly-\nphenolic compound, a yellow pigment extracted from tur-\nmeric, from the powdered rhizome of Curcuma longa. It\nis a commonly used food-stabilizing agent and spice in\nthe countries of Far East.5 It is renowned for its medical\nproperties and as a cure for several types of diseases. It\nhas been extensively studied for its anti-oxidant, anti-\ninflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and wound-healing\neffects.6,7 It scavenges and prevents the formation of reac-\ntive oxygen species (ROS).8 Curcumin can repress tumor\ninitiation, promotion and metastasis.9\nEffects of curcumin on angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme gene expression,\noxidative stress and anti-oxidant status in\nthioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity\nYumna Fazal1, Syeda Nuzhat Fatima1, Syed Muhammad Shahid2\nand Tabassum Mahboob1\n Keywords\nCurcumin, ACE gene expression, oxidative stress, anti-oxidant, hepatotoxicity\n1Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan\nThe Karachi Institute of Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering\n(KIBGE), University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan\nCorresponding author:\nSyed Muhammad Shahid, Assistant Professor, The Karachi Institute of\nBiotechnology & Genetic Engineering (KIBGE), University of Karachi,\nEmail: smshahid@uok.edu.pk\nOriginal Article\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), encoded by\nthe ACE gene, is a prime catalytic protease in the renin\u00ad\nangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system (RAAS) that converts\nangiotensin (Ang) I to II.10 Raised levels of renal ACE\nhave been comprehensively studied in connection with the\ndevelopment of cardiovascular disease in both humans and\nrodents.11 Susceptibility to end-organ damage caused by\nhypertension has been associated with elevated renal ACE.\nIn the case of TAA-induced liver cirrhosis, other parame-\nters such as oxidative stress have been postulated to be\nmajor molecular mechanisms basic to tissue alteration.12\nBased on the multifunctional properties of TAA and the\nanti-oxidant properties of curcumin, this study describes\nthe hepatoprotective effect of curcumin on TAA-induced\nliver cirrhosis, by estimating serum enzymes (alanine ami-\nnotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and\nalkaline phosphatase (ALP)), oxidative stress (malonyldi-\naldehyde (MDA)), and anti-oxidant status (superoxide dis-\nmutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH) and catalase\n(CAT)) to identify ACE gene expression in TAA-induced\nhepatotoxicity and its possible treatment with curcumin.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals and diet\nFor this study, 32 male albino rats (Wistar strain) with\nthe animal facility of ICCBS, University of Karachi. These\nanimals were housed in a polypropylene cage and the tem-\nperature of the animal room was maintained at 30\u00b0C and at\n50% humidity with an alternative 12 hours light/dark\ncycle. The animals were provided with standard food and\nwater.\nStudy design\nThe experimental period of the study was 24 weeks. Rats\nwere divided into four groups (n=8) and were treated as\nfollows:\nGroup 1: The control group remained untreated.\nGroup 2: Received TAA (200 mg/kg body weight\n(b.w.) intraperitoneal (i.p.)) for 12 weeks.\nGroup 3: Received curcumin orally (75 mg/kg b.w.)\nweeks+curcumin orally (75 mg/kg b.w.) for a further 12\nweeks.\nSample collection\nAt the end of the treatment, the rats were decapitated to\ncollect the blood from the head wound. A portion of blood\nwas taken in a separate tube to collect serum. Liver tissues\nwere excised and trimmed, followed by rinsing with deion-\nized water to eliminate blood contamination. Filter paper\nwas used to dry the tissues, which were weighed and kept\nin -70\u00b0C freezer until analyzed.\nHistological examination\nAfter quick removal, the liver tissues were cut into small\npieces, followed by immersion in neutral buffered forma-\nlin (10%) for 24 hours. Standard histological techniques\nwere used to fix and section the liver tissues. The morpho-\nlogical changes in the fixed sections of the liver tissues\nstained using hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) were used\nto evaluate the extent of TAA-induced necrosis.13\nPreparation of post-mitochondrial supernatant\nA tissue homogenizer (Ultraturrax T-25 Polytron) was\nused to obtain liver homogenates at 4\u00b0C. To prepare the\ncontaining EDTA 0.3 mM was used followed by centrifu-\ngation at 800 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to separate the nuclear\ndebris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,500 g\nfor 20 min at 4\u00b0C to obtain post-mitochondrial superna-\ntants used for analyses of SOD, CAT, MDA and GSH.14\nAssessment of serum enzymes and bilirubin\nThe estimations ALP, AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin\nin serum was done using reagent kits from Randox\nLaboratories Ltd., UK.\nAssessment of oxidative stress\nAs a measure of lipid peroxidation, MDA content was ana-\nlyzed by means of thiobarbituric acid reacting substance\n(TBARS) using tissue homogenate.15\nAssessment of anti-oxidant status\nPreviously established methods were used to measure the\nsupernatant.\nACE gene expression\nExpression of the ACE gene in liver tissue was assessed\nusing the quantitative RT-PCR method. RNA was isolated\nusing entire RNA Prep Plus. Amplification reaction was\nperformed in 12.5 \u00b5l total volume, containing a pair of spe-\ncific primers: 5'CAGCTTCATCATCCAGTTCC3' and\ncycles at an annealing temperature of 52\u00ad64\u00b0C. Restriction\nfragments were subsequently analyzed in 2% agarose gel\nstained with ethidium bromide.19\nStatistical analysis\nAll the data values are given in Mean\u00b1SEM. Statistical\nsoftware package SPSS for Windows\u00ae version 17.0 was\nused for statistical analyses. One-way ANOVA was per-\nformed followed by Student's t-test to evaluate variations\nin data; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe hepatocytes, portal triads and vasculature were found\nto be within normal limits during histopathological\nassessments. There was no pathological modification\nsuch as inflammation, necrosis and/or fibrosis in the liver\nof curcumin-treated animals (Figure 1). A massive fatty\nchange along with centrilobular necrotic shift was observed\nin the liver of TAA-treated rats. Apoptosis (single hepatic\ncell necrosis) was also very clearly observed, as well as\nmononuclear cells infiltration, mostly macrophages and\nlymphocytes, around central veins and in portal areas in\nTAA-treated animals (green arrow). The liver section\nshowed extensive damage, characterized by severe necro-\nsis, fatty degeneration, sinusoidal dilatation, and the pres-\nence of collagen bundles surrounding the lobules leading\nto thick fibrotic septae that disrupt the cellular architecture\n(Figure 2). A complete regeneration of hepatocytes and\nhepatic tissues appeared in most of the cases in curcumin +\nTAA-treated animals (Figure 3).\nThe levels of AST, ALT and ALP were estimated in\nserum to detect any possible deviations from normal in\nliver functions (Table 1). The liver-specific enzymes were\nfound to be markedly affected in the group treated with\nTAA. Significantly higher (p<0.05) levels of serum AST,\nALT and ALP in TAA-treated rats suggested elevations in\nthe release of the enzymes due to serious damage in the\nliver. However, a significantly lower (p<0.05) level was\nobserved for these enzymes in the study group treated with\nTAA+curcumin compared with the TAA-treated group.\nActivity of the anti-oxidant enzyme SOD activity was\nsignificantly lower (p<0.05) in TAA-treated cirrhotic\nrats, whereas no significant difference was observed in\ncurcumin-treated cirrhotic rats as compared with con-\ntrols. CAT activity was found to be significantly lower\n(p<0.05) in TAA-treated cirrhotic rats. No significant\nchange was observed in the level of CAT in curcumin-\ntreated and TAA-treated cirrhotic rats as compared with\ncontrols (Table 2).\nTissue MDA as a measure of tissue lipid peroxidation\nwas found to be significantly higher (p<0.05) in TAA-\ntreated cirrhotic and curcumin-treated cirrhotic rats as\ncompared with controls (Table 2). ACE gene expression in\nthe study groups is shown in Figure 4, which was signifi-\ncantly higher (p<0.05) after 8 weeks of TAA treatment in\ncirrhotic rats as compared with the control group. This\ngene expression was found to be reversed in the curcumin-\ntreated cirrhotic rats (Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nIn order to understand the underlying mechanisms involved\nin the development of cirrhosis, the present study inspected\nthe role of oxidative stress in the mediation of hepatic\nFigure 1.

The TAA-induced cirrhosis resulted in oxidative\nstress in the liver, as observed by a high level of lipid per-\noxidation, accompanied by distorted status of antioxidants.\nIn end-stage liver cirrhosis, organ failure has been observed\ndue to severe renal vasoconstriction, which frequently\ndevelops in patients with cirrhosis.20,21\nEven though the exact molecular mechanisms by which\nTAA induces toxic effects in different organs is not under-\nstood, it is well known that TAA interferes with ribosomal\nactivity, thereby interfering with protein synthesis and\nstimulating DNA synthesis.22\nThe present study aimed to determine the expression\nof the ACE gene in rats suffering from TAA toxicity and\ntheir treatment with curcumin, and compare their levels\nwith control groups by using the quantitative RT-PCR\nmethod. ACE gene expression was significantly raised in\nthe TAA group as compared with the control group, indi-\ncating that TAA induced changes in the ACE gene, pro-\nducing more ACE protein than would the normal gene.\nFurthermore, high activity of the RAAS causes hepatic\nscarring and decreases the number of functioning hepato-\ncytes.23 This increase in ACE gene expression was over-\ncome in the experimental animals who received curcumin\nafter TAA; hence, they seemed to be protected against\nabnormally increased levels of ACE in the liver caused\nThe boost in lipid peroxidation and generation of ROS\nmay diminish cell viability. TAA-induced lipid peroxida-\ntion is reported to disturb the reliability of the membrane,\nleading to inhibition of membrane-bound enzymes. Higher\nlevels of lipid peroxidation have also been observed in rat\nliver exposed to TAA. A significant decline in lipid peroxi-\ndation caused by administration of antioxidants was found\nafter the treatment with curcumin; therefore, it can be said\nthat the curcumin restrained the production of ROS, which\nhas been shown to decrease lipid peroxidation possibly by\nits anti-oxidant mechanism.26\nSOD is a metalloprotein widely distributed in all cells\nand plays a significant role in protecting against oxidative\ndamage induced by ROS. Reduced SOD levels may pos-\nsibly be due to the generation of more superoxide anions.\nHigher levels of production of H2\nlowered the activity\nof CAT.27 The activity of CAT was found to be signifi-\ncantly lower (p<0.005) in TAA-treated rats as compared\nwith the control group, and after treatment with curcumin\nCAT activity was found to be significantly reducing the\neffects of TAA in liver.\nTable 1.

ACE gene expression in study groups.\nThe non-enzymatic anti-oxidant GSH is thought to be\na key player in the process of detoxification, which\nactively participates in reactions which lead to the destruc-\ntion of H2\n, free radicals, and certain foreign com-\npounds.28,29 The higher consumption of GSH to scavenge\nthe toxic intermediates formed by TAA led to significantly\nlower levels of GSH in liver tissue of the TAA group. On\nthe other hand, a significant rise in GSH level was\nobserved following the administration of curcumin to\nTAA-induced liver.\nSignificantly higherACE gene expression was observed\nin the TAA-induced group when compared with controls,\nindicating that more ACE proteins are being formed. It\nseems that treatment with curcumin increases ACE gene\nexpression in liver as compared with the TAA-induced tis-\nsue, approaching normal levels.\nConclusion\nIt may be concluded from the findings of this study that\ncurcumin administration may produce a defensive effect\nagainst TAA-induced liver injury and oxidative stress in\nrats, which otherwise leads to liver cirrhosis. Further\nlong-term follow-up studies may be of great benefit to\nunderstand and to establish the hepatoprotective nature\nof curcumin administration in the animals under\nobservation.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nResearch grant from Dean, Faculty of Science, University of\nKarachi is gratefully acknowledged for this study.\nReferences\n1.
