    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Chilean Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey was used to model the choices made by households with respect to day\ncare or preschool (DC/PS) attendance. We also use georeferenced data on the location of centers that could take care\nof children. We present a detailed analysis of the correlates of DC/PS attendance choices, giving special attention to the\ndistance between the household and the center as predictors. For these purposes, the joint decision of child attendance to\nDC/PS and mother's employment is modeled. The measurement of this association is relatively new to the literature because\nit requires georeferenced data, which only recently have begun to be collected systematically by public policy agencies. The\nassociation we find between distance and attendance to DC/PS centers is significant but smaller than the association to the\nage of the child. Separate analyses for 0- to 14-month-olds and 25- to 54-month-olds show some heterogeneous effects on\nthe joint decision of attendance and education.\n",

It is generally argued that in addition to being\nan extremely cost-effective investment in human capital,\nquality preschool education helps to bridge the sociocultural\ngaps that become evident very early in a child's life (Becker,\nRecent initiatives launched in Chile, such as the Programa\nChile Crece Contigo (Chile Grows With You Program), aim\nto guarantee the 40% most vulnerable sector of the popula-\ntion access to day care or preschool (DC/PS) services (up to\nthe age of 4). Also, in the last few years, universal (although\nnot compulsory) access has been guaranteed for prekinder\nand kindergarten children.\nThese initiatives imply important investments in logistics\nand infrastructure, as well as the professional and technical\ncapabilities required in each center. For this reason, it is nec-\nessary to avoid deficiencies in the services supplied, as this\nresults in an unnecessary increase of public spending in pre-\nschool education. This is extremely important because a\nrational planning of spending on DC/PS centers generates\nsavings that could be used to extend this coverage to sectors\nwith difficulties of access and to improve the quality of the\nservices provided.\nThis calls for studies to provide an answer to several ques-\ntions regarding the demand for these services on the part of\nthe homes. In this line, it is important to determine how the\ndistance between the home and the preschool center relates\nto the way in which the families use this service. In addition\nto the distance between the center and the home, there are\nother factors associated with DC/PS use such as the age of\nthe child, the size of the household, the mother's educational\nand employment status, and others, such as the household\nmember's interests or preferences. This study seeks to look\ninto these correlates as much as the data available allow by\nestimating a model of the joint decision of child attendance\nto the DC/PS center and mother's employment. The article\nnot only provides an answer to some of the basic questions\nrelated to choice of day care centers in Chile but also raises\nnew questions and uncovers new issues that should be dealt\nwith in greater depth in subsequent studies.\n1Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile\nCorresponding Author:\nFrancisca Dussaillant, Center for Public Policy, School of Government,\nUniversidad del Desarrollo, Avda Plaza 680, Las Condes, Santiago, Chile\nEmail: mfdussaillant@udd.cl\nUsage of Child Care and Education\nCenters: The Proximity Factor\nFrancisca Dussaillant1\n Keywords\npreschool attendance, day care, child care, maternal employment\n2 SAGE Open\nLiterature Review\nThe objective of this analysis is to study the correlates of DC/\nPS use by households. There is a well-established literature\nthat explores the determinants of child care, summarized by\nThe specific subject of the relation of child care and labor\nsupply has also been thoroughly examined. Anderson and\ncomprehensive reviews of that research literature.\nDel Boca, Locatelli, and Vuri (2005) and Del Boca and\nVuri (2005) study the double decision of Italian mothers to\nwork and send their children to a formal child care center.\nBoth studies conclude that the most important factors that\naffect this decision are the mother's educational level (the\nhigher her educational level, the greater the probability of\nher working and using child care services, especially for\nyounger children), the age of the children (the probability\nincreases at the age of 4 or 5 years), factors related to the\nfamily structure and home support networks, and so forth.\nThese results are frequently replicated in the specialized lit-\nerature. For example, both Joesch and Hiedemann (2002)\nand Reyes and Urz\u00faa (2012) have found similar correlates of\npreschool attendance, the former in the United States and the\nlatter in Chile.\nIt has been documented in various studies that the par-\nents' preferences of child preschool attendance vary accord-\ning to the child's age (see, for example, Del Boca et al.,\nMichalopoulos, Robins, & Garfinkel, 1992). Parents of\nyounger children tend to resort to informal child care strate-\ngies (Hofferth, Brayfield, Deich, & Holcomb, 1991). This is\ndue to lower availability of formal centers, higher costs, or\nthe fact that families prefer informal arrangements in which\nthe caregiver is a family member or somebody that they trust\n(Del Boca et al., 2005). Even in the United States, where\nthere is a wide supply of child care centers, Joesch and\nHiedemann (2002) have found that a considerable percent-\nage of households with children below 3 years of age would\navoid child care centers, even if they were free of charge.\nThere are few studies that consider the effect of the loca-\ntion of child care centers on the decision to send the children\nto DC/PS establishments using georeferenced data. Kitano\nand Uda (2007) studied the accessibility of child care centers\nin two cities in Japan using georeferenced data of the loca-\ntion of the centers and of the homes with children under 6\nyears of age, and data on transport and highways. Compton\nand Pollak (2014) also argued that the mechanism through\nwhich proximity increases labor supply is the availability of\nchild care. In their case, they study proximity to mothers and\nmothers-in-law, as child care providers. The authors find\nthat, in the United States, the probability of employment and\nlabor force participation for married women with young chil-\ndren is higher for those living closer to their mothers or their\nmothers-in-law.\nHerbst and Tekin (2012) have investigated the effect on\nthe actual reception of social services of the distance a parent\nmust cover to get to a social services agency in the United\nStates. Their results show that the greater the distance, the\nlesser the child's probability of having access to a child care\nsubsidy.\nThe only study that examines location effects using geo-\nreferenced data in a developing country, as of our knowl-\nedge, is Reyes and Urz\u00faa (2012). They study the supply and\ndemand of early education using georeferential data of the\nhouseholds and preschool education or child care centers in\nthe metropolitan region (a mostly urban geographical sector\nof the country where the capital city, Santiago, is located).\nThey obtain the household information through data reported\nin the Ficha de Protecci\u00f3n Social (FPS), an instrument used\nfor the targeting of social benefits. The authors conclude that\nthe distance between the center and the home is an important\n(although not the only) correlate of attendance. Although\nparents do not necessarily choose the center that is the near-\nest to their home, they do choose one that is close.\nAnother Chilean study (Contreras, Puentes, & Bravo,\n2012) evaluates the association between distance from the\nhome or workplace to day care centers and the mother's deci-\nsion to work. In this study, distance is measured subjectively\nas perceived physical proximity. The authors find a correla-\ntion between their distance variable and labor force partici-\npation of mothers.\nOur study comes to complement Reyes and Urz\u00faa (2012).\nIt differs from theirs in that we use national data from a rep-\nresentative survey of early childhood, Estudio Longitudinal\nde Primera Infancia (ELPI). As respondents of this survey\nknew that their reports would be confidential and their names\nwould not be disclosed, they had less incentive to underre-\nport on several key variables (a recognized problem of FPS\ndata). The use of FPS data by Reyes and Urz\u00faa (2012) has\nsome advantage in that it includes the whole population, but\ntheir universe is restricted to the metropolitan region and to\nthe households that had decided to give their information to\naccess social benefits. Herrera, Larra\u00f1aga and Telias (2010)\nindicated that this population represented, as of 2010, more\nthan two thirds of the national population, and the group that\nwas left out was mostly the less vulnerable (which, as Reyes\n& Urz\u00faa state, are the less likely to use the public child care\nand education services under study).\nInstitutional Structure of Preschool\nEducation and Care in Chile\nFour preschool providers can be identified in the segment of\nchildren younger than 5 years old: municipalities, private\nproviders, the Junta Nacional de Jardines Infantiles (JUNJI),\nand the Fundaci\u00f3n Integra. JUNJI is an autonomous organi-\nzation related to the Ministry of Education, whose purpose is\nto provide quality education and care to vulnerable children\nDussaillant 3\nup to 4 years old. JUNJI also supervises and certifies other\npublic centers. Fundaci\u00f3n Integra is a private provider of\ncare and education to children of ages younger than school\nage, and it is fully financed by the government. Municipal\ncenters are autonomous organizations, and they are also\nfinanced by the government. Finally, private centers are\npayed by the families. Even though JUNJI and Fundaci\u00f3n\nIntegra work without apparent association, they offer very\nsimilar programs. They serve the bulk of the Chilean popula-\nIn the last couple of years, there has been a significant\nincrease of the social protection programs oriented to early\nchildhood. In particular, in the period that goes from 2006 to\n2010,1 preschool education and care services increased their\nalmost 500% in the public supply of nursery facilities that\nserve children from 0 to 24 months of age and an increase of\nmore than 50% of the public supply for children between 24\nand 48 months of age. Nonetheless, this significant increase\nin service availability did not consider supply and demand\nissues in its planification, so several issues associated to the\nquality of the services and their geographic location arose\nAs of 2013, administrative records indicate that a little\nless than 200,000 children were enrolled in these centers and\nthat most of them use JUNJI or Fundaci\u00f3n Integra facilities.\nTable 1 depicts total enrollment by type of provider, as\nreported by the Chilean Ministry of Education for 2013\n(Centro de Estudios MINEDUC, 2014). It should be beared\nin mind that enrollment and total capacity do not necessarily\noverlap in Chile (see, for example, Reyes & Urz\u00faa, 2012),\nwhere it is not rare to find DC/PS centers working in less\nthan full capacity due to a lack of demand. This will be later\ndiscussed in this study.\nMost DC/PS centers serve children of ages below 5. After\nthat, children enter the school system. Prekinder and kinder\nare available in some schools and serve children during the\ncalendar year they turn 5 or 6 years of age, respectively.2\nKinder education was deemed mandatory in Chile since 2013.\nThis study focuses on children aged 0 to about 4.5 years\nThe eldest of these cohorts, born in 2006, would be ready to\nthe analyses were gathered, these children mostly used the\nservices provided by DC/PS centers and not by schools. DC/\nPS centers receive children of different ages and internally\ndivide the children into age-differentiated rooms. They fre-\nquently serve children of every age, from birth until the\nmoment they enter school. There is no centralized curricu-\nlum or directive regarding the services to be provided in\nthese centers. Some of them provide mostly day care,\nwhereas others start giving some education to the children.\nEducational services come to replace pure day care when the\nchild grows, but the particular care/education time ratio at\ndifferent ages is a decision of each center. There are no data\nabout the type of service (care or education) provided in each\ncenter, so we decided to pool them and give them all the\nname of \"DC/PS centers.\"\nData and Descriptive Analysis\nThis section will present a snapshot of preschool education\nand child care in Chile obtained from the Early Childhood\nLongitudinal Study (ELPI in Spanish) that was conducted in\n2010 to increase the information available on early child-\nhood issues and to establish a baseline for a follow-up study\nof a cohort.\nThe information was drawn from a representative sample\nof each age range included in the survey to study the cohort\nof children by year of birth, that is, the birth cohorts of 2006,\nrepresentative at the time of the survey, consisted of approxi-\nAugust 31, 2009, residing in Chile throughout the country in\nurban and rural areas. The estimated sample error for each\nmonth of birth fluctuates between 5.0% and 5.7%; for a\n12-month aggregate or a calendar year, it is around 1.5%, and\nfor the total sample, it decreases to less than 1.0%.\nTable 1.

Only one child per household was\nselected.\nFor the purposes of this study, we used the ELPI sociode-\nmographic database, which has the particular feature of col-\nlating the children's \"history\"; that is, the questionnaire not\nonly refers to their current situation but also collects data\nrelated to points or periods of time prior to the survey. Thus,\nevery child is described as a set of \"moments\" or ages: The\ncharacteristics associated with the child vary according to the\n\"moment\" recorded. However, especially when it comes to\nattendance to DC/PS establishments, we have only consid-\nered the children at the \"moment\" corresponding to the inter-\nview (excluding their history). This is due to the fact that\nusing the history of the child's attendance would lead to bias,\nparticularly considering that the supply of establishments has\nincreased dramatically in recent times.\nThe Ministry of Education also provided data about the\ndistance from 12,575 households surveyed by ELPI to the\ngovernment-funded education and child care centers ran by\nthe JUNJI and Fundaci\u00f3n Integra. Only centers within a\nradius of 10 km were matched to each household. Data about\nthe age range serviced by each center were also provided.\nTwo thousand six hundred cases were not matched because\nthere were no DC/PS centers in the 10-km radius or because\nit was not possible for the ministry to georeferenciate them\n(no information regarding which cases corresponded to the\nfirst or second explanation was provided).\nThis means that in the descriptive sections of our study,\nwe were able to use about 83% of the original ELPI sample.\nThe 2,600 cases that were not matched are disproportion-\nally rural and belonged disproportionally to geographical\nregions different from the metropolitan, where the capital\ncity, Santiago, is located. Therefore, 6.8% of the households\nof the restricted sample are rural, whereas in the original\nsample, the figure was 10.0%. Also, in the restricted sample,\n42.1% of the households belonged to the metropolitan\nregion, whereas on the original sample, only 37.4% belonged\nto that geographical zone. On other relevant variables, the\nrestricted and the original samples do not differ significantly.\nFor example, in the original sample, 35.3% of the children\nassist to DC/PS centers, 44.5% of the mothers are employed,\nmean child age is 30.4 months, and the average age of the\nmother at childbirth was 27.3 years. In the restricted sample,\nOur final statistical analysis, a bivariate probit that mod-\nels the joint probability of a woman to work and use child\ncare facilities for her child, required further restriction of the\nsample to 9,604 cases. This, due to missing values in the\nlabor status of the mother or, in a minority of cases, because\nthe main caretaker of the child was not the biological or\nadoptive mother. Descriptive statistics of this estimation\nsample are available in Table 2.\nThe following subsections aim to briefly describe the situ-\nation of females and their children in terms of labor, access\nand use of child care, and the availability of child care and\neducation facilities near the households. These descriptive\nanalyses make use of the matched ELPI-distance database\nMaternal Employment, Child Age, and Child Care\nUse\nThere is a direct relationship between the mother's employ-\nment status and the age of her children. The survey reveals\nthat when the selected child was under 12 months of age, less\nthan 35% of the mothers were employed. On the contrary,\nwhen the children were between 4 and 5 years of age, this\nproportion climbed to 52.1%. Maternal working hours do not\nappear to vary by age of the child and are always about 40 to\n41 hr on average per week, distributed over a 5-day working\nweek (with the exception of the 0- to 3-month-old age range,\nin which some mothers do not report to work due to mater-\nnity leave and the mothers of 4-year-olds that mostly report\nfull-time 45-hr jobs).\nOur data show that in Chile, children of employed moth-\ners are more likely to attend preschool than those whose\nmothers are not employed (see Figure 1). The difference is\nmore striking in the case of younger children (under 1 year of\nage) and becomes less noticeable at successively older ages.\nTable 2. Unmet Demand for DC/PS Centers.\nProportion of households\nthat do not send the\nchildren to DC/PS (%)\nProportion of households that do\nnot send the children to DC/PS\nthat claim problems of access (%)\nProportion of households with\naccess problems that claim to have\ntransportation or distance problems (%)\nNote. DC/PS = day care and preschool.\nDussaillant 5\nThis may be indicating that preschool services are perceived\nby mothers as instances of educational value for their chil-\ndren, whereas mothers of young children would only regard\nday care establishments as a child care solution. The respon-\ndents who send their child to preschool or day care assess\nthese establishments quite positively (means are always\nabove 6.4 on a scale of 1-7) as regards infrastructure, cleanli-\nness, treatment of the children by their teachers, education\nprovided to the children, and schedules. The assessments do\nnot vary from item to item or according to the age range of\nthe child attending the center.\nWhen mothers or caregivers who have decided not to\nsend the child to preschool establishments are asked why, the\nanswers provided are multiple but can be grouped into two\nmain types: those that arise from availability issues and oth-\ners that are explained by the preferences of the households.\nOnly the former can be regarded as an unmet demand. Table\n2 gives an idea of the proportional size of that unmet demand\nin Chile.\nRespondents who say that they need a preschool center\nbut do not have access to one (because of distance, money,\navailability, or schedule issues) are potential users if the sup-\nply is improved. When studying nonattendance of children\nunder 12 months of age, it appears that less than 4.5% report\nsuch supply issues. This proportion slightly increases with\nthe age of the child to about 8.3% for 2-year-olds, 11.0% for\n3-year-olds, and 13.5% for 4-year-olds. These results are in\nline with those of Del Boca et al. (2005), Joesch and\nThe Distance Factor\nWe define as \"potential DC/PS demanders\" those households\nthat, although reporting a need of the service, say that they do\nnot have access to it. As Table 2 shows, although the highest\nproportion of people who do not send their child to DC/PS\ncenters report doing so because they do not want to, the\ngroup that indicates that their decision is due to supply issues\nstill represents a significant number of households. Most\n(between 49% and 80%, according to age) of the households\nthat reported difficulties in terms of access specify as their\nmain constraint the distance to and from the facilities. This is\nthe most frequently mentioned reason in each age range,\nalthough it is particularly significant for children between 4\nand 5 years old.\nTo deepen our understanding of the association of the dis-\ntance factor to the household decision of sending their child\nto DC/PS centers, we study the data on the existence of a DC/\nPS center3 within a 10-km radius of the household. The data\ninclude the linear distance between the household and each\nof these centers inside the 10-km radius, and the type of ser-\nvices (in terms of age) they provide. Therefore, data made it\npossible to match children with every center close to their\nhousehold that provided care for their age. If a 4-year-old\nchild was matched to 10 DC/PS centers in a 10-km radius,\nwe were sure that all these centers did attend 4-year-olds. On\nthe contrary, a nursery attending 0- to 2-year-olds was never\ncounted as a potential choice for these 4-year-olds, even if it\nwas located close to the household.\nThe number of establishments within a 10-km radius is, in\ngeneral, large, particularly in the metropolitan region (where\nSantiago, the capital and most populated city, is located), due\nto its greater population density. In this region, the house-\nholds with children below a year of age have an average of\n115.6 centers that attend to that age in the 10-km radius. This\nnumber reduces to 82.6 when 4-year-olds are considered.\nWhen the radius is narrowed to 2 km, the number of centers\ndescends to 8 for children below a year of age, and 5.4 for\n4-year-olds. Unfortunately, this information does not allow\nus to infer whether there are open vacancies.\nFigure 1. Attendance to preschool or day care establishments according to maternal employment status.\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 3 shows the average distance between DC/PS cen-\nters in the area around the household. The table differentiates\nbetween children who report attending DC/PS centers and\nthose not attending.\nWe see that children who attend DC/PS centers tend, on\naverage, to have facilities available at a shorter distance from\nthe household. This is particularly observable when we con-\nsider the distance to the nearest facility and when children\nare younger. However, it still remains valid when we com-\npare the third and fifth facilities nearest to the household.\nThe trend is reversed for the case of children between 4 and\n5 years of age. This might be reflecting the fact that, in many\nof these cases, these children already started attending the\nprekinder and kinder supplied by public schools, establish-\nments not considered in the database.\nHowever, the results on Table 3 refer only to average dis-\ntances. Further analysis of the data shows that, at least for\nyounger ages, the distribution of distances for those attend-\ning DC/PS centers dominates stochastically the distribution\nof distances for those not attending, regardless of whether we\nlook at the nearest, the third, or the fifth preschool establish-\nment in the distance ranking.\nThe relations between DC/PS attendance and distance\nshown in Table 3 should be handled with caution. The asso-\nciations do not imply causality. They do not necessarily tell us\nthat increasing the number of establishments near households\nwould increase the proportion of mothers who decide to send\ntheir child to these establishments. The association, as men-\ntioned above, may have arisen because of the following:\na. The existence of DC/PS establishments near the\nhousehold induces the use of the available supply.\nb. The sectors in which there is a larger proportion of\nmothers willing to send their child to DC/PS centers\ninduce the installation of new establishments there.\nIt is quite likely that both phenomena are taking place,\nand the data on Table 3 do not make it possible for us to dis-\ncern which of either effect is stronger. If we were to assume,\nfor instance, that DC/PS centers were distributed throughout\nthe national territory at random, as a result of a central plan-\nning that does not take into account demand issues, then the\ncause could be attributed to (a). However, even admitting\nthat the governmental plan to build new DC/PS centers was\nnot solely driven by considerations of demand, it is hard to\nbelieve that there were no major local pressures (possibly\nacknowledged by the government) in areas where such facil-\nities were more needed. In that sense, the effect described in\n(b) should also be of some importance.\nEconometric Analysis\nWe modeled the decisions of the selected children's mothers\nabout whether or not to opt for paid employment and whether\nor not to send their children to day care centers or preschool.\nHence, the joint distribution model for the binary variables\n\"attends\" and \"employed\" is constructed, where the former\nindicates whether the child attends a DC/PS center and the\nlatter indicates whether the mother is employed or not4 by\nusing a bivariate probit. The joint model is appropriate when\nthe errors of each individual equation are not independent.5\nThus, the estimates describe the size and strength of the\nassociation of the independent variables with the mother's\nchoice of employment, child care, or education.\nTable 4 shows the descriptive statistics of the sample used\nin this analysis. The independent variables include dummies\nby geographical region, age of the child in months (and its\nsquare), age of the mother when the child was born, number\nof people in the household, education of the mother, distance\nbetween the house and the nearest DC/PS center (providing\na service suitable to the age of the child), gender of the child,\nand a dummy indicating whether the father lives in the\nhousehold. In the particular case of Chile, price does not\nhave a significant role in the decision to attend to DC/PS\ncenters because most centers are free. Therefore, we can\ninterpret in our results that the availability and distance vari-\nables represent what families perceive as the cost of sending\ntheir child to a center.\nIt can be argued that the distance of DC/PS center from\nhome has a different meaning according to rurality. The same\nTable 3.

These heteroge-\nneous effects are studied by separating the sample into two\ngroups: rural and urban households. Estimates for the whole\nsample are also reported, including rurality as an indepen-\ndent variable.\nAnother potential source of heterogeneity is the age of the\nchild. It can be argued that the essence of the DC/PS service,\nfrom the point of view of the mother, is related to child care\nfor the smaller children, but to education and socialization\nfor the older. Therefore, we also perform separate estima-\ntions for children up to 24 months old and for children from\nThe appendix shows the marginal effects calculated using\nthe models described above. Each column of TablesA1 toA3\nrepresents the marginal effects on the probability of choosing\nany combination of actions associated with employment\ndecisions and attendance to DC/PS establishments. For\nexample, the first column of each of the tables shows how\neach one of the independent variables affects the joint prob-\nability of the mother being employed and the child being sent\nto a DC/PS center.\nTable 5, which we include in the main text, is a simpler\ndisplay of the effects6 of the independent variables on the\nmarginal probability of DC/PS attendance and on the employ-\nment decision of the mother.7 The table reports the results for\nthe whole sample estimation and for the urban and rural sam-\nples. Table 6 reports results for the age-specific samples. To\nprovide a benchmark for the reported marginal effects,\npredictive margins and predicted joint probabilities in each\nmodel are reported in Table 7. Also, in the same table, values\nfor the predicted conditional probability of employment given\nthat the child attends to a DC/PS center, and for the condi-\ntional probability of attendance given that the mother is\nemployed, are provided.\nThe whole-sample model estimation of Table 6 shows\nthat each month in the child's life results in an increase of\n1.7 percentage points in the probability of DC/PS atten-\ndance and has an effect of 0.4 percentage points on the\nmother's employment probability. Also, the older the\nmother when the child was born, the lower the probability\nof using DC/PS services, and the higher the probability of\nher being employed, although the size of these effects is not\ntoo large (0.3 percentage points per every year of age of the\nmother in the case of probability of DC/PS attendance and\n0.7 in that of the mother's employment probability).\nMothers with a college degree display the highest probabil-\nity of sending their children to DC/PS centers (and are also\nthe group with the highest employment) followed by those\nwith some level of higher education (complete or incom-\nplete). Mothers with primary education or less have a prob-\nability of being employed that is 47 percentage points lower\nthan that of mothers with a university education. Also,\nmothers with primary education or less send their children\nto DC/PS centers with a frequency that is 17 percentage\npoints lower than that of mothers with a college education.\nDistance to the nearest DC/PS center is decisive for the\nhousehold choice to use these services and an important\ncorrelate in the employment decision of the mother. An\nextra kilometer to the nearest DC/PS center is associated\nTable 4.

Similarly, the larger the\nnumber of people living in the household, the lower the prob-\nability of the child attending the DC/PS center or the mother\nbeing employed (an additional member of the household\nmakes the attendance probability decrease by 1.6 percentage\npoints and the maternal employment probability decreases\nby 1.5 percentage points). The gender of the child does not\nseem to be associated with the decision of the home.\nIf we consider the estimation for the whole sample, the\nresults indicate that the probability of using DC/PS services\nin rural areas (with respect to urban) decreases by almost 9\npercentage points and the probability of the mother of being\nemployed decreases by 7.2 points. Although there seems to\nbe some heterogeneity in the behavior of rural and urban\nhouseholds, as seen in the separate estimations for the rural\nand urban samples, estimated marginal effects are not sub-\nstantially different. Nonetheless, several coefficients for the\nrural sample deem insignificant (e.g., the marginal effect of\ndistance on the marginal probability of maternal employ-\nment). This may mean that the effect is absent, or it might\nsimply reflect the smaller size of the sample (N = 624) over\nwhich the rural estimation was performed. Distance seems to\nmatter less in the decision to send the child to the DC/PS\ncenter: Each extra kilometer of distance to the nearest center\nis associated to a descent of 3.4 percentage points in the\nprobability to attend in urban zones but only 2.2 percentage\npoints in rural zones.\nWhen the estimation is performed separately by age of\nthe child (see Table 6), there seems to be some indication of\nheterogeneous response. Attendance decisions are more\nassociated to mother's education for older children. This\nmight be occurring due to a higher salience of the educa-\ntional attributes of DC/PS services for older children, and\nTable 5.

On the\ncontrary, services for smaller children might be perceived to\nbe less educative and only related to day care and, therefore,\nare similarly valued across educational groups. Distance\nalso seems to matter more for the probability of attending of\nolder children. These results are more difficult to interpret,\nbut they might be due to the fact that mothers sometime get\nhelp from their employers to care for their 0- to 24-month-\nold children (this is mandated by law for some employers).\nEmployer-provided centers are frequently located close to\nthe mother's workplace, and not necessarily to the child's\nhousehold. On the contrary, employers do provide DC/PS\ncenters for older children. Rurality also seems to work dif-\nferentially depending on the age of the child: The probabil-\nity of attending DC/PS centers is lower in rural areas only\nfor older children (by more than 13 percentage points).\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe analysis in this article indicates that a number of factors\nare relevant when explaining the decision of households to\nsend their children to DC/PS centers. The analysis points to\nthe employment status of the mother as one of the main pre-\ndictors of the use of preschool services (especially for younger\nchildren). This is evident from our analysis in that the correla-\ntion between the errors of the attendance equation and the\nemployment equation of the bivariate probits ranges from .30\nto .48 depending on the sample over which the estimation was\nperformed. As would be expected, the higher correlations\nwere found for the estimation over the sample restricted to\n0- to 24-month-olds. This implies that in a country where\nfemale employment is on the rise, an increase in demand for\nday care and preschool establishments is to be expected.\nTable A1.

DC/PS = day care/preschool.\nAnother very important correlate of the demand for DC/PS\ncenters is the age of the child. Our estimates indicate that there\nis evidence of heterogeneous response in the decision to send\nolder versus younger children to DC/PS centers in Chile.\nAttendance is significantly more associated to education of the\nmother and to rurality when the child is older (25 to 54 months\nold). Distance to the nearest DC/PS center also seems to mat-\nter most in households of older children. Some explanations\ncan be ventured for these results, although more research\nwould be needed to check whether these hypotheses are cor-\nrect. The fact that attendance decisions are more associated to\nmother's education for older children might be due to a higher\nsalience of the educational attributes of DC/PS services for\nolder children, as more educated mothers value more early\neducation. Services for smaller children might be perceived to\nbe less educative and only related to day care and, therefore,\nare similarly valued across educational groups. The fact that\ndistance to the nearest DC/PS center seems to be more associ-\nated to the probability of attending of older children is more\ndifficult to interpret. One reason might be the fact that there is\na law that mandates some employers to help Chilean mothers\nby proving or financing child care for their 0- to 24-month-old\nchildren. But employer-provided centers are frequently located\nclose to the mother's workplace, and not necessarily to the\nchild's household. There is no legal mandate for Chilean\nemployers to provide DC/PS centers for older children.\nDistance from the household to the nearest the DC/PS\nestablishment relates to the mothers' decision to send their\nchildren to these establishments and shows a variation of\naround 3 percentage points in the attendance rate. The mea-\nsurement of this effect is relatively new to the literature as it\nrequires georeferenced data, which only recently have begun\nto be collected systematically by public policy agencies. The\nassociation we find between distance and attendance to DC/\nPS centers is significant but smaller than that which relates\nattendance to the age of the child or education of the mother.\nUnfortunately, we have no information on the distance\nbetween the DC/PS establishment and the workplace of the\nmother. This leads us to think that the distance effect esti-\nmated here is only partial. There may be a stronger associa-\ntion when the \"mother\u00adchild distance\" and not the decision\nto send the child to the DC/PS center are considered. This\nproposed \"mother\u00adchild distance\" variable, however, is dif-\nferent from the \"household\u00adchild distance\" variable, which\nis the one used in this estimation, because the mother is not\nnecessarily at home during the day. If we had such data, we\nwould expect, if anything, an increase in the strength of the\nassociation between distance and child attendance. It is inter-\nesting that the relationship is still showing, even considering\nthe abovementioned drawbacks.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. That period's institutional circumstances are of special rel-\nevance because this study examines data gathered in 2011.\n2. In Chile, calendar and academic years overlap. The Chilean\nacademic year commences in March and ends in December.\n3. Most government-funded centers were included in the data-\nbase, with the exception of a small percentage of centers\nbelonging to municipalities. Private centers were not identified\neither, but most children attend government-funded facilities\nbecause they are free of charge.\n4. The estimates were based on the subsample of children living\nwith their biological or adoptive mothers (a majority).\n5. In fact, in the estimation of the bivariate probit, a .30 to .49\n(p < .01) correlation was obtained between the errors of the\nattendance equation and the employment equation. The small-\nest corresponded to the estimation for the sample of older chil-\ndren, and the highest to that of the sample of older children.\n6. Throughout this document, \"effects\" should be understood as\nthe marginal effects of a variable on the probability of attend-\ning day care/preschool (DC/PS) centers or on that of the mother\nbeing employed. A marginal effect indicates how the probabil-\nity varies if the variable in question is modified by one unit.\n7. It should be borne in mind that according to the Bayes's\nrule, the joint probability P(A, E), where A = attends and E\n= employed breaks down into P(A/E)xP(E) or into P(E/A)\nxP(A), where P(A/E) and P(E/A) are conditional probabilities\nand P(A) and P(E) are marginal probabilities. Thus, the afore-\nmentioned table shows the marginal effects on the marginal\nattendance probability P(A), where P(A) = P(A/E = 1)xP(E =\n1) + P(A/E = 0)xP(E = 0) and, similarly, for the employment\nprobability P(E).\n8. This relation, as well as all the ones estimated, does not imply\ncausality. In this particular case, for instance, we cannot con-\nclude that a larger number of DC/PS establishments near the\nhousehold would lead to a greater use of them: It is possible\nthat the relation observed occurs because in areas more willing\nto send children to these centers, there are more of them.\nReferences\nAnderson, P., & Levine, P.
