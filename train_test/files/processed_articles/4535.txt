    "abstract": "Abstract\nEvaluating educational programs and interventions is generally considered a normal part of curriculum development and\nimprovement, and published findings are readily accessible through peer-reviewed journals. Recently, however, researchers\nand practicing educators have identified a lack of evaluative research regarding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) educational\npractices in the peer-reviewed literature. Autism Spectrum Australia (Aspect) has an established evidence-informed ASD\ncurriculum that is constantly reviewed and updated to meet the needs of the students in Aspect schools and classes. Through\na methodical evaluative process, all educational interventions and support processes and devices undergo a series of Evidence-\nBased Research Trials and evaluations before they are implemented in classes. This article demonstrates how a workflow\nmodel can deliver a systematic method for identifying, evaluating, implementing, and disseminating the research findings of a\nprogram or support intervention. The Autism Spectrum Disorder Evaluative Education (ASDEE) model is discussed.\n",

Although ASD can be identified as early\nas 2 years of age (Corsello, Akshoomoff, & Stahmer, 2013),\nit is often only identified once children enter the education\nThe reported prevalence of ASD within the community\ncontinues to rise. In England, researchers estimate that there\nare approximately 1 in 100 people in the population who are\nthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indi-\ncated a much higher community incidence when they\nreported an estimated prevalence of 1 in 68 8-year-old chil-\ndren are diagnosed with ASD--a 123% increase in the prev-\nalence of ASD since 2002 (Autism and Developmental\nIn Australia, data provided by the Australian Bureau of\nliving with ASD (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2014), and\nOf these children, 95% are reported to need specialized edu-\ncation to support their communication, social, or learning dif-\nficulties (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2014).

(2014) published an extensive\nreview of evidence-based practices for people with ASD.\nThis review evaluated more than 450 journal articles that\nreported intervention practices that addressed a single educa-\ntional goal with the aim of identifying practices that encour-\nage improved individual educational, behavioral, or\ndevelopmental outcomes. The majority of the participants in\nthese studies were aged between 3 and 11 years. A total of 58\nstudies investigated students'performance on tasks that typi-\ncally occur at schools.\nDespite the breadth of studies examined in Wong et al.\ncase studies and only 10% were based on studies of two\n(Harper, Symon, & Frea, 2008; Kuhn, Bodkin, Devlin, &\nDoggett, 2008) or four children (Laushey, Heflin, Shippen,\nAlberto, & Fredrick, 2009). The findings from this meta-\nanalysis suggest that although educational ASD interven-\ntions are being evaluated and reported, there is a need for\nlarger scale evaluations.\nAppropriately evaluated ASD curriculums have been\ndemonstrated to assist in supporting learning outcomes\n(Costley, Keane, Clark, & Lane, 2012; National Autism\nCenter, 2011) and are documented as a priority for education\nproviders (New South Wales [NSW] Department of\nEducation and Communities, 2011; Simpson, McKee, Teeter,\nlished a National Cooperative Research Centre to research\nthe needs of people living with ASD, and one of the specific\ngoals of the program is to \"provide appropriate educational\nenvironments and programs to optimise students' social,\nbehavioural and academic success, and equip teachers to\nmanage even the most complex behaviours\" (Autism\nAspect is an Australian ASD service provider of educa-\ntional services, diagnostic assessments, early intervention and\noutreach programs as well as professional development. It fea-\ntures an ASD-specific school program and delivers an evi-\ndence-informed curriculum to more than 1,000 enrolled\nstudents. Aspect has a network of eight independent schools\nand more than 100 satellite classes embedded in mainstream\nschools across the Australian State of NSW. Programs and\ninterventions are scrutinized through a process of evidence-\nbased research, peer- and self-reviewed evaluation, and a con-\nEvidence-based research provides scientific verification\nof the effectiveness or lack of significant change in outcomes\nas a result of an intervention. In education, however, a statis-\ntically significant basis for implementing a process or sup-\nport may not be the whole story. In cases where evaluation\nby collegial educators, support networks, and other stake-\nholders identifies student benefits from an intervention, a\nmethod of evidence-informed decision making can be valu-\nable (Ciliska, Thomas, & Buffet, 2012). Evidence-informed\nappraisal has the benefit that it can integrate scientific evi-\ndence with informed community opinions (Kohatsu,\nAspect uses an evidence-informed program selection pro-\ncess that assesses new products and programs to determine\nwhether an intervention will be included or excluded from\nthe curriculum. The Aspect model of evaluation uses both\nevidence-based and evidence-informed research to assess the\ninternal validity of a program, that is, to measure the effi-\ncacy. Evidence-informed assessment also provides a process\nfor bridging the gap between the practitioner's assessment\nand classroom practice through external validation by using\navailable resources and translating the suggestions into\nempirical research (Mercer, DeVinney, Fine, Green, &\nAccording to the U.S. National Research Council (2001),\nthe education of teachers and school personnel is the pri-\nmary way of encouraging evidence-based teaching strate-\ngies. Researchers suggest that the critical element for\ntranslating research into practice is to ensure that there is a\nhigh fidelity implementation through a system of regular\nprogram review by teachers (Mandell et al., 2013) and\nthrough ongoing training for paraprofessionals within\nschools (Brock & Carter, 2013). An example of a resource\nthat has been developed specifically to encourage practitio-\nners to take a scientific approach to selecting ASD-specific\ninterventions is the Autism Research Toolkit (White,\nLeekham, Shenow, & Gomez de la Cuesta, 2013). This\nresource suggests that intervention programs implement a\nresearch cycle to \"predict, test, observe, and explore\" the\nimpact of an intervention as a way of evaluating the efficacy\nof an educational program.\nAt Aspect, the primary objective is to develop an evi-\ndence-informed ASD-specific curriculum that validates the\nteaching and intervention methods used in the schools and\nclasses. A comprehensive evidence-based review conducted\nat Aspect identified several educational program elements\nthat were essential to a school program designed to support\nlearning and encourage transition to a more inclusive educa-\ntional setting. This specialized curriculum is designed by\nAspect and based on the literature that focuses on individual\nstudent education plans that are designed to evaluate and\nmonitor the pupil's core competencies and their outcomes\nbased on their support needs (Iovannone, Dunlap, Huber, &\nIn 2011, a multi-site action research project began to doc-\nument the information, processes, and procedures used\nwithin Aspect schools. The goal was to collect data that\nshowed how the Aspect Comprehensive Approach for\nEducation (ACAE) framework was implemented in the\nschools. As a result of this process, the ACAE manual was\nCostley et al. 3\ndeveloped, which provides a comprehensive description on\nan evidence-based curriculum for teaching children with\nASD (Aspect, 2012). The ACAE manual provides a blue\nprint for how each element of the ACAE should be imple-\nmented in the Aspect schools. Each section of the ACAE\nmanual provides the theory and current research supporting\nthe curriculum methodology, how to implement the method-\nology in classroom practice, case studies, lesson templates,\nand resources. The manual includes a Self-Review Checklist\nfor examining program fidelity as part of a Continuous\nImprovement Project cycle.\nAtAspect, a workflow model has been developed with the\naim of providing staff with an easily understandable template\nfor conducting educational evaluations. A workflow model is\na visual representation that identifies the procedures of a\ndefined project. Workflow models can characterize how\ntasks are undertaken with respect to an organization's poli-\ncies and specific objectives (Alhaqbani, Adams, Fidge, & ter\nHofstede, 2013). From an educational perspective, a work-\nflow model can be used to define the research question,\ndescribe the sequence of the research evaluation and imple-\nmentation stages, and identify the educational outcomes and\ncommunity benefits. A workflow model can provide schools\nwith a consistent system for identifying new educational\nsupport devices and strategies, and allow for focus on the\nreliable and valid assessment of student outcomes in authen-\ntic educational environments.\nThe goal of this article is to describe the Autism Spectrum\nDisorder Evaluative Education (ASDEE) model and to dem-\nonstrate how Aspect manages a process of research into new\nASD-specific education interventions.\nThe ASDEE Model\nThe ASDEE model shows the flow of the decision-making\nprocess for implementing new interventions and supports\nwithin the curriculum. The ASDEE model is an overview of\nthe procedures for identifying, piloting, evaluating, and\nimplementing ASD-specific educational programs and class-\nroom supports. It also depicts how evidence-based outcomes\nare professionally disseminated. Figure 1 depicts the process\ndeveloped by Aspect to support and evaluate the ACAE\ncurriculum.\nWhen new support devices and technologies become\navailable, parents often ask teachers to implement particular\ninterventions in the classroom, but it can be difficult for teach-\ners to identify which support is likely to benefit the student.\nOne recent example is the Apple iPad (iPad is a trademark of\nApple Inc.), which is marketed as a device designed with\nassistive features for students with special needs, including\nassistive touch, speech to text features, gesture-based screen\nreaders, and opportunities for reducing the visual clutter on\nscreens (Apple, 2014). There are numerous applications\ndesigned and marketed as providing communication, behav-\nioral, or learning support for individuals with ASD.\nIn response to the questions from parents and teachers,\nAspect conducted a research trial on iPad use in Aspect\nclassrooms (Aspect, 2013a). We will use this example to\ndemonstrate how Aspect evaluated the efficacy of a new\nintervention for potential inclusion in the ACAE manual.\nThe ASDEE model is divided into two phases: Evaluation\nand Practice. The Evaluation phase of the ASDEE model\nincludes the assessment and decision-making process under-\ntaken before an educational intervention is implemented.\nFollowing a positive evaluation outcome, the educational inter-\nvention is implemented within Aspect schools and the findings\ndisseminated. This implementation and dissemination process\nis shown in the ASDEE model as the Practice phase.\nNew Support Device or Intervention\nIdentified\nThe ASDEE model begins with the identification of an inno-\nvation that is suggested to be a promising educational sup-\nport for students (see Figure 1), as a New Support Device or\nIntervention Identified. The evidence-informed process\nbegins here and establishes the research problem by identify-\ning a program, support device, or intervention that has the\npotential to provide an improved educational outcome for\nstudents with ASD.\nFor example, when the iPad was first released, several par-\nents approached theAspect school teachers with the suggestion\nthat these new devices be used in class because they believed\nthat the iPad could provide substantial support to their child's\nlearning. Aspect considered the parents'request and decided to\nconduct an evidence-informed Small Pilot Study.\nLiterature Review\nThe peer-reviewed literature search provides the opportunity\nfor relevant, reliable, and valid studies to be evaluated. This\nprocess is the first stage in the evaluation of the\nintervention.\nThe literature review is conducted by reviewing relevant\nliterature, including peer-reviewed journal articles sourced\nthrough Google Scholar and EBSCO databases. This review\nalso examines \"grey literature,\" which includes published\nmaterial from technical reports, specialist professional publi-\ncations, and manufacturers' or developers' websites.\nThe criteria for inclusion in the literature review will\ndepend on the educational support to be evaluated. The\nobjective of the literature review is to define the research\nquestion and identify who will benefit from the intervention\n(e.g., students with limited communication skills). Material\nis included in the literature review if the published outcomes\nare measureable.\nFor example, in 2010, after the release of the iPad, stu-\ndents at Aspect schools began to bring the devices into the\nclassroom. Parents noted that their children demonstrated\nimprovements in a variety of skills when using the device.\n4 SAGE Open\nNew Support Device\nor Intervenon\nIdenfied\nLiterature Review\nEvaluaon of\nEvidence\nEvidence-Informed Evidence-Based\nResearch and Ethics\nApplicaon\nYes\nEvidence-Based\nResearch Trial\nNo Further\nInvesgaon\nNo\nNo Further\nInvesgaon\nEvidence Not Endorsed\nNo\nACAE Manual\nAspect Schools\nImplementaon\nModel Class\nProgram\nEvidence of Efficacy\nConnuous\nImprovement\nProjects\nor\nSmall Pilot Study\nNo\nWide Disseminaon\nYes\nYes\nEvaluaon\nPracce\nConnuous\nImprovement\nProcess\nFigure 1. The ASDEE model.\nNote. ASDEE = Autism Spectrum Disorder Evaluative Education; ACAE = Aspect Comprehensive Approach for Education.\nCostley et al. 5\nThis raised many questions about the children's engagement\nin learning activities and whether the benefits were measur-\nable. By 2011, reviews, commentary, and case study reports\nof how iPads could be used in education started to appear\n(Geist, 2011; Hutchison, Beschorner, & Schmidt-Crawford,\nmissing from the iPad reports was the rigorous pedagogi-\ncally founded evidence-based research. Therefore, we con-\nducted a review of relevant literature regarding the use of the\niPad with students with ASD.\nThe literature review for the iPad study was conducted by\nrunning a search through Google Scholar and EBSCO data-\nbases using the following search words: autism, iPad, educa-\ntion, learning, and teach. In addition to the peer-reviewed\nliterature, relevant \"grey literature\" including teacher educa-\ntion conference presentations and proceedings were gathered\nand appraised.\nEvaluation of Evidence\nAfter a literature review is conducted, the evidence is evalu-\nated by a team of Aspect teachers and researchers. The pur-\npose of the evaluation is to decide whether sufficient evidence\nexists to support further exploration of the use of the inter-\nvention at Aspect. During the evaluation of evidence pro-\ncess, two possible outcomes are examined: evidence\ninformed and evidence based.\nEvidence-Informed Outcome\nIn cases where peer-reviewed literature does not yet exist but\nanecdotal evidence is convincing, Aspect encourages a pro-\ncess of evidence-informed decision making with regard to\ntrialling new interventions. The process of evidence-\ninformed research recognizes that large-scale, randomized\ncontrol studies are not necessarily the most appropriate\nmethod of evaluating every intervention. This is especially\ntrue for research into educational interventions for individu-\nals with ASD as their requirements can be very individual-\nized, and standardized measurements may not reflect the\ntolerance levels required for evaluative comparison\nAn intervention can earn evidence-informed status when\nthere is evidence from reliable sources such as professional\nconferences, expert implementers, and/or teachers, occupa-\ntional therapists, and parents who may have observed\nimprovements after trialling a new support or intervention. If\nthe intervention meets the criteria for evidence-informed sta-\ntus, the decision can be made to conduct a research project\nand submit a Research and Ethics Application. In the exam-\nple of the iPad evaluation, the peer-reviewed literature sug-\ngested that this device had the potential to provide social and\nacademic benefits (Alexander, Ayres, Smith, Shepley, &\nIn addition, a teacher education conference presentation one\nof the Aspect teachers attended also demonstrated evidence\nof using the iPad as a communication tool that could facili-\ntate routine classroom activities for students with cognitive\nEvidence-Based Outcome\nThis decision underlines the ACAE principles that a compre-\nhensive ASD-specialized program includes a variety of edu-\ncational approaches designed to meet the range of individual\nneeds of all students at all times (Australian Advisory Board\non Autism Spectrum Disorders, 2010). The ACAE acknowl-\nedges that within a set of standard procedures and core cur-\nriculum, different teaching tools, interventions, and\ntechniques may be used at different times during a child's\ndevelopment. If the evidence meets the criteria of the ACAE\ncurriculum, the evaluation can proceed to the Research and\nEthics Application and approval process. To meet the criteria\nof the ACAE curriculum, the program must meet the require-\nments of the syllabus regulator, the Board of Studies NSW,\nAustralia; show evidence of significant outcome benefits as\ndetermined by the student's individual educational plan; and\nbe affordable within the school budget, as assessed by the\nsenior educational management team.\nIn the situation where there is no clear evidence that meets\nthe ACAE criteria, the evaluation process is discontinued\nand no further investigation takes place. When there is sub-\nstantiated peer-reviewed evidence of improved outcomes,\nASD specific or not, a valid assessment of the intervention\ncan lead to the decision to progress to the Research and\nEthics Application and approval process for clearance to trial\nand evaluate an intervention. After the Small Pilot Study\nshows positive outcomes for the students involved, an\nEvidence-Based Research Trial can be designed and con-\nducted in two classes in each of three Aspect schools over a\nperiod of 1 year.\nResearch and Ethics Application and\nApproval Process\nAll research conducted at Aspect requires ethics clearance\nprior to commencing a research study with students, staff,\nor clients. The ethics approval process ensures that research\nis appropriately conducted and that the welfare, rights, dig-\nnity, and safety of participants are protected. The process of\napplying for ethics clearance not only provides an opportu-\nnity for the application assessors to evaluate methodologi-\ncal rigor and scrutinize potential risks and benefits to\nparticipants, but it also ensures that the researcher consid-\ners and manages any risks and benefits associated with the\nstudy while developing the research methodology. The\napplication process also provides an opportunity for the\nresearcher to outline the study's contribution to the wider\nASD community.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe Research and Ethics Application and approval pro-\ncess is applicable to the Evidence-Based Research Trials,\nSmall Pilot Studies, and Continuous Improvement Projects.\nThe process is clearly mapped with application forms easily\naccessible through the Aspect intranet and Internet website.\nThe Research and Ethics Application requires details about\nthe research questions, methodology, risks/benefits analysis,\nand expected outcomes. Small Pilot Studies and Continuous\nImprovement Projects are assessed by the Aspect Research\nApprovals Committee, which is made up of a team of expe-\nrienced human research ethics advisors. Research approval is\ngenerally granted for 1 year.\nThe ASDEE model shows the flow of direction from the\nResearch and Ethics Application process to the research\nstudies options--Evidence-Based Research Trial, Small\nPilot Study, or Continuous Improvement Project.\nEvidence of Efficacy\nThe aim of conducting research at Aspect is to provide rele-\nvant improvements in educational processes and outcomes\nfor students. Small-scale study evaluations with valid and\nreliable methodology provide an opportunity to assess the\nefficacy of an intervention. Evidence of efficacy can be\nexplored by conducting a small research project. At Aspect,\nthere are two options: the Continuous Improvement Project\nand the Small Pilot Study. Often, Continuous Improvement\nProjects or Small Pilot Study research studies are conducted\nprior to Evidence-Based Research Trials.\nThe first option is the Continuous Improvement Project.\nThe purpose of the Continuous Improvement Project at\nAspect is to improve service provision and to annually moni-\ntor compliance with national and state curricula require-\nments. They are conducted each year on a selection of\nprograms that are identified by the school managers. Each\nContinuous Improvement Project runs over 1 school year.\nThe Continuous Improvement Project requires ethics and\nresearch clearance from the Aspect Research Approvals\nCommittee before commencement as well as signed informed\nconsent from participants or parents/guardians on behalf of\nstudent participants. The Continuous Improvement Project is\ndesigned for small, short-term studies and is usually a one-\noff or pre-/post-program questionnaire about the effective-\nness of an intervention and may be directed to parents,\nteachers, or students. Findings from a Continuous\nImprovement Project can only be distributed internally\nwithin Aspect. At the end of the Continuous Improvement\nProject, a participant-de-identified written report is prepared\nby the evaluator/s. The findings are reported to Aspect man-\nagers and executives, shared with teaching staff across the\norganization, and are used to improve practice.\nThe other option is the Small Pilot Study, in which an\nintervention is evaluated and results can be publicly dissemi-\nnated. The Small Pilot Study is designed as a research project\nwith rigorous methodology. The Small Pilot Study may be\nundertaken as a trial and may have peer-reviewed evidence-\nbased support or anecdotal indication of an evidence-\ninformed practice.\nAs a result of the collation of some evidence-informed\nmaterial and evidence-based iPad literature (Geist, 2011;\nRayner, 2010), a Small Pilot Study was developed to test\nwhether there was evidence of improved educational out-\ncomes for children with ASD. Aspect worked in partnership\nwith researchers from the University of Wollongong who\nsupported additional data collection, analysis, and reporting.\nIn all, 33 students aged between 5 and 7 years participated in\na study that evaluated communication, behavior, and social\nskills development after using appropriate iPad applications\nfor 1 full school year. In this study, the teacher evaluated the\nstudent's baseline measures at the beginning of the school\nyear and again at the end of the school year. The encouraging\nresults from the Small Pilot Study enabled further investiga-\ntion into the iPad as an educational tool through an Evidence-\nBased Research Trial.\nIn the ASDEE model, when outcomes from the Small\nPilot Studies provide evidence of efficacy, the decision to\nmove to an Evidence-Based Research Trial can be under-\ntaken. If after the Small Pilot Study there is no evidence of an\nimproved outcome, then the intervention is not implemented\nat Aspect schools.\nEvidence-Based Research Trial\nThe Evidence-Based Research Trial is larger in scope than\nthe Continuous Improvement Project and the Small Pilot\nStudy. The participant-de-identified findings from these\nprojects may be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal\narticles, conference presentations, conference proceedings,\nworkshops, fact sheets, the Aspect Model Class Program,\nand other media sources. The findings from the Evidence-\nBased Research Trial are also used to review and revise the\nACAE and accompanying manual. Evidence-Based Research\nTrials are conducted over the course of 1 school year. The\ntrials are piloted in up to five schools, with each school con-\nducting the program in two or three classes. Evidence-Based\nResearch Trials are granted ethics approval from an indepen-\ndent accredited Australian University Human Research Ethic\nCommittee as part of the evaluation process.\nOnce the intervention has been evaluated and the out-\ncomes reported to the Education and Research Committee, a\ndecision is made as to whether the intervention will be incor-\nporated into the ACAE manual. This decision to include an\nintervention in the ACAE manual is dependent upon evi-\ndence of a significant benefit to the student, budgetary con-\nsiderations, and how it complies with government educational\ncurriculum requirements.\nIn the iPad study, an Evidence-Based Research Trial was\nconducted and piloted in three schools. The results from the\ntrial have been disseminated through Aspect's professional\ndevelopment workshops, and journal articles are currently\nCostley et al. 7\nunder peer-review. The iPad Model Class Program is suc-\ncessfully running in one school and the program is incorpo-\nrated into the ACAE manual and implemented in Aspect\nclassrooms across the school network.\nACAE Manual\nThe Continuous Improvement Project, Evidence-Based\nResearch Trial, and Self-Review Checklist findings are col-\nlated annually and contribute to the ACAE manual. The aim\nof the ACAE manual is to provide Aspect educators and the\nwider community with an evidence-based educational\nresource specifically for supporting students with ASD. The\nmanual provides sections on implementation of the interven-\ntion in classroom practice, resources, case studies, and the\nACAE Self-Review Checklist.\nThe purpose of the ACAE Self-Review Checklist is to\nmaintain fidelity of the educational approach and to provide\nimproved quality, consistency, and standards of education\nfor the students withASD. TheACAE Self-Review Checklist\nis administered in Aspect schools on an annual cycle.\nAspect Schools Implementation\nOnce there is an evidence-base for supporting implementa-\ntion of an innovation, a staff Learning and Development\nProgram is offered to teachers from all Aspect schools,\nincluding those who were not involved in the research. Each\nof the eight Aspect schools trains several staff members,\nincluding the school coordinator (senior teacher) to use the\nintervention, and they are then responsible for supporting the\nimplementation in their school. Usually the school principal\nwill initially nominate one or two classes, so that the teachers\ncan develop teaching strategies and resources that suit their\nclasses. These classroom teachers in turn support the adop-\ntion of the new intervention across the school.\nAspect Model Class\nThe Aspect Model Class Program was developed to show-\ncase a specific innovation. Each Aspect school has at least\none classroom that is set up to demonstrate a specific innova-\ntion. The class teacher and teacher's aide are trained in the\nimplementation of the intervention and are supported by the\nschool coordinator who ensures that the intervention is\nincluded in the class program and the Individual Education\nPlans of the students. Each Model Class is supported with\nclassroom resources, and professional development work-\nshops, including pre-service and in-service teacher training\nand learning support team programs. Parent information fact\nsheets are also available for all Model Classes.\nAspect currently has six different Model Classes as part of\nthe Model Class Program. Each Model Class is based on the\noutcomes of a research evaluation carried out over the last 5\nyears by Aspect. Each Aspect school hosts a different Model\nClass Program, based on the evidence-based research evalu-\nation in which they played a lead role. Some examples of\nModel Classes are as follows: iPad Technology, Language\nAcquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) program\n(Bedwani, Winchester, Simmons, Roberson, & Costley,\n2013); Pivotal Response Training Intervention (Kilham &\nCostley, 2012); Secret Agents Society social skills program\n(Beaumont & Sofronoff, 2013); Treatment and Education of\nAutistic and related Communication-handicapped Children\n(TEACCH)-structured teaching intervention (Kilham &\nACAE in Practice Model Class.\nDissemination\nInformation about the Evidence-Based Research Trials is\ndisseminated through various means. Within Aspect, evi-\ndence of program efficacy is regularly reported through pro-\nfessional development workshops, Model Classes, and\nnewsletters. Parents are informed about the school practices\nthrough the Model Classes, newsletters, and program\nupdates. Parents whose children participated in research tri-\nals receive summary reports about the findings when reports\nare published.\nAspect research information is also disseminated to the\npublic in other ways. Aspect regularly conducts community\nprofessional development workshops for families and pro-\nfessionals who support children living with ASD. These\nworkshops share information about working with evidence-\nbased programs for children with ASD. Peer-reviewed jour-\nnal articles are published with the findings, and we encourage\nresearchers who conduct the studies to present their findings\nat relevant education conferences.\nThe summary findings from the iPad study have attracted\nwidespread interest from the Aspect school community. In\naddition to Aspect staff professional development work-\nshops, the summary findings from the iPad study have so far\nbeen distributed to families who participated in the research\nand through newsletter updates to the Aspect education com-\nmunity. Once the refereed journal articles have been pub-\nlished, community and professional workshops and\nconference presentations are planned.\nDiscussion\nThe gap between research and school implementation in ASD\neducation has highlighted the need for more rigorous evalua-\ntion of interventions and supports (Kasari & Smith, 2013;\nWong et al., 2014). TheASDEE model presented in this article\nprovides a systematic process for ethically trialling, rigorously\nevaluating, and reliably implementing an educational support\nor intervention for children with ASD. This model has been\ntested through a series of Continuous Improvement Projects,\nSmall Pilot Studies, and Evidence-Based Research Trials. The\n8 SAGE Open\nfindings from the Evidence-Based Research Trials have been\npublished in peer-reviewed journals (Baldwin, Costley, &\nbooks (Costley et al., 2012), andAspect-published and distrib-\nuted fact sheets, e-newsletters (Bedwani et al., 2013; Kilham\nand professional development workshops.\nThe strength of the ASDEE model is that it provides the\nAspect staff with a consistent method for evaluating the lat-\nest technology or intervention. The gap between research\nand classroom practice can be managed through a methodi-\ncal evaluation of a variety of evidence, as well as ethically\nconducted and evaluated evidence-based research studies\ndirectly in the classroom. By assessing new intervention pro-\ngrams or support devices in a trial class (Small Pilot Study),\nand more widely through multiple classes in several schools\n(Evidence-Based Research Trial), the participant sample size\nfor the research will be large enough to adequately represent\nthe population, within the context of students with ASD, and\ntherefore draw reliable conclusions from the findings (Odom\net al., 2005). By evaluating several classes, across two or\nmore schools, the studies aim to mitigate against introducing\na bias when interpreting the results from individual case\nstudies and very small group studies. At present, there is no\ndefinitive sample size within the refereed ASD educational\nliterature that is considered to have statistical power as vari-\nability of the student's educational requirements needs dif-\nferent research methodologies to evaluate efficacy (Odom\nThe ASDEE model offers a resource-efficient method for\noperating within the classroom. The resources and effort\nused in evaluating an intervention are based around educa-\ntional principles that are identified in theACAE. TheASDEE\nmodel demonstrates how evidence can be assembled from\ntraditional peer-reviewed academic publications or from evi-\ndence-informed or anecdotal sources. This flexibility in\nidentifying evidence allows for evaluation of new interven-\ntions before peer-reviewed articles are available. It also pro-\nvides the opportunity to evaluate interventions that have\nbeen trialled by parents or professionals, such as occupa-\ntional or speech therapists, with promising results.\nOne of the difficulties that the evaluation programs face is\nresistance from students, parents, and teachers. All too often,\nthe potential participants feel they are evaluated too fre-\nquently and this can lead to a lower percentage of the stu-\ndent, parent, or teacher cohort being involved. To overcome\nthis feeling of evaluation fatigue, researchers must ade-\nquately explain the benefits of the evaluation to the students,\nas well as the risks. It is also imperative that the evaluations\ndo not involve overly time-consuming surveys for parents\nand teachers. In our experience, we find that short pre-inter-\nvention and post-intervention surveys with targeted ques-\ntions are a successful method of evaluation.\nThe future of the ACAE is a cycle of Continuous\nImprovement Projects. Schools regularly undertake theACAE\nSelf-Review Checklist, and the school's collated results feed\ninto the frequently updated manual. As new interventions and\nsupport devices are developed, the workflow processes of the\nASDEE model are monitored and the findings are dissemi-\nnated. The staff are encouraged to submit Research and Ethics\nApplications, to conduct research, and to share their findings\nthrough the delivery of workshops and peer-reviewed forums\nsuch as journals and conference presentations.\nThe ASDEE model is one step toward closing the gap\nbetween the research laboratory and the classroom. It pro-\nvides a clearly defined pathway for educators to identify,\nevaluate, and implement new innovations that appear to offer\nsupport to students with ASD in a shorter time frame.\nConclusion\nThis article suggests that the gap between research and class-\nroom practice in ASD education is a problem that can be\nmanaged through regular classroom program evaluation and\nreporting. The ACAE is a systematic curriculum methodol-\nogy that is regularly evaluated and updated. By adhering to\nthe workflow ASDEE model, educators can identify evi-\ndence of a new educational intervention, conduct an evalua-\ntion, identify effective programs, implement the innovation,\nand share and disseminate the findings. Through methodical\nevaluation and continuous improvement processes, better\nstudent outcomes can be achieved.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlexander, J.
