Our key management recommendations for tigers in the\nKerinci Seblat region of Sumatra stress the importance of maintaining connectivity\nbetween the smaller areas and the larger area, and minimizing poaching within these\nsmaller areas. More widely, our research has shown the feasibility of using detection\u00ad\nnon-detection surveys combined with spatial modelling to provide timely information\nfor conservation management.\nKey-words: detection probability, GIS, logistic regression, population viability, spatially\nexplicit habitat model, Sumatran tiger\nIntroduction\nConservation managers often need to determine the\noccurrence, number and population viability of cryptic\nspecies living at low densities and over large areas.\nHowever, this can present a dilemma. On the one hand,\nconservation managers may begin to implement strat-\negies based, at best, on crude population estimates or\nguesses, which in turn may lead to the wrong manage-\nment approach (Blake & Hedges 2004). On the other\nhand, by stressing the need for accurate information\nrequiring investment of substantial time and money,\nCorrespondence: M.

Therefore, conservation\nmanagers require rapid yet rigorous population census\nmethods, and the means to model the results in a mean-\ningful and pragmatic way that leads to improved and\ntimely species management strategies. Such requirements\nare pertinent for many top terrestrial carnivores.\nTo overcome these management problems, previous\nstudies on large carnivores have used presence\u00adabsence\ndata within logistic regression modelling to investigate\nfactors that determine species occurrence, and a geo-\ngraphicalinformationsystem(GIS)toconstructspatially\nexplicithabitatmodels(SEHM)(Palma,Beja&Rodrigues\nbiases associated with a failure to differentiate `absent'\nand `undetected'can be avoided by explicitly incorporat-\ning detection probability estimates through repeated\ndetection\u00adnon-detection surveys (MacKenzie et al. 2002;\nThe detection\u00adnon-detection method assumes that\nall cells are either occupied or unoccupied. Ideally, three\ncases would be distinguished, true absences (where no\nsign is detected because the cell is not within an animal's\nhome range), false absences (where no sign is detected\neven though a sign exists within the cell) and pseudo-\nabsences (where no sign exists within the cell but, none\ntheless,thecelloccurswithinanindividual'shomerange).\nThe latter situation is likely to arise when cells are small\ncompared with a large carnivore's home range, as a cell\nmay be occupied (i.e. within an individual's home range)\nbutmaycontainnosignif thatindividualhasnotpassed\nthrough recently. Of these three cases, false absences can\nbe differentiated from true or pseudo-absences by survey-\ningeach cell more than once, ideally within a short time\nperiod (i.e. a few days) (MacKenzie & Royle 2005). If\nthe interval between surveys is short, the probability with\nwhich a sign is detected when present can be estimated\nfrom the frequency with which a sign is recorded in a\ngiven cell in some surveys but not in others. True absences\nand pseudo-absences cannot be differentiated and so\n`occupancy' measured in these studies may be more\nusefully thought of as `usage' (MacKenzie 2005). By\nsurveying large areas in this way, relative use of different\nhabitat types can still be estimated because cells in better\nquality habitat would still be expected to be visited more\noften and have a greater likelihood of containing a sign\nthan cells located in poorer quality habitat.\nConstruction of a SEHM using the detection\u00adnon-\ndetection approach can identify habitat suitability and\nthe proportion of a species' range actually occupied,\nrather than assigning arbitrary cut-off values for habitat\nsuitability (Lennon 1999). Furthermore, SEHM can be\nused to estimate carnivore population sizes, and these\nmay be combined with population viability analyses\n(PVA) to determine extinction risks under different man-\nagement strategies and scenarios (Coulson et al. 2001;\nThe tiger Panthera tigris is a cryptic top predator that\nlives in diverse environments. Three out of eight tiger\nsubspecies have already been driven to extinction by\nwidespread habitat clearance, human over-hunting of\nprey and use of tiger parts in traditional Chinese\nmedicine and other trade (Nowell & Jackson 1996). To\nprevent further losses of tigers across Asia, conserva-\ntionists have focused funds and effort on tiger conser-\nvation units (TCU) (Wikramanayake et al. 1998). Yet,\nthere is little or no detailed monitoring information on\ntiger populations in many of the most important level 1\nTCU, making it difficult to evaluate tiger conservation\nstrategies systematically. While camera trapping has pro-\nvidedreliableanddetailedinformationontigerdensities\nit is expensive, requires skilled personnel and can only\ncoverasmallarea(< 400 km2)overarelativelylongtime\nperiod (4\u00ad6 months). Through camera trapping alone,\nit would take many years to obtain sufficient monitor-\nTCU. Therefore, it is critical to develop a rapid, accurate\nand comparable survey method that all field staff can\nusetodeterminetheoccurrenceof tigersacrosskeyTCU.\nIn this study, we combined a rapid census method\nwith a spatial and population modelling approach to\nidentify tiger subpopulations and assess their viability\nin the Kerinci Seblat (KS) region, Sumatra, a level 1 TCU\nfor which limited information on tiger populations had\nbeen previously available. Specifically, we aimed to\n(i) use field data on tiger distributions analysed with\nlogistic regression modelling to map probabilities of tiger\noccurrence throughout the KS region, and (ii) para-\nmeterize a PVA, to assess the consequences of different\nmanagement strategies for the viability of these tiger\nsubpopulations.\nMethods\nLocated in west-central Sumatra, Indonesia (-3\u00b057 to\nper-humid bioclimate (Whitmore 1984) that supports\nfour broad forest types: lowland hill (0\u00ad300 m a.s.l.), hill\nmontane (1400 + m a.s.l.)

Nevertheless, agricultural expansion has\nfragmentedKSNPintotwopartsandpoachingof tiger\nprey has degraded habitat quality in sections of KSNP\ncells. A stratified sampling approach was used to select\n200cellsrepresentingthemainhabitattypesandvarious\ndistances from the forest\u00adnon-forest edge. Detection of\ntigers (defined as presence of tracks and/or faeces) was\nM. Linkie et al.\n \n ,\n \ndetermined from transects walked by three independent\nteams consisting of field researchers and KSNP staff\nthat was resurveyed was re-entered within 1 week of the\nfirst survey in that cell. Forty cells were resurveyed on a\nthird occasion, but the remaining 160 cells were not\nresurveyed for a third time because of field personnel\nconstraints.\nWithin each selected cell, transects averaging 2\u00b747 km\nin length were surveyed. To maximize the probability of\nencountering tiger signs, transects followed pre-existing\nanimal trails or topographic features such as mountain\nridges, which tigers often use as travel corridors (O'Brien,\nWibisono & Kinnaird 2003). The location of each\ntransect was recorded in universal transverse mercator\n(UTM) coordinates using a Garmin 12XL global posi-\ntioning system (GPS) (Garmin Corp., Ulathe, KA) and\nAlthough prey abundance is likely to be a primary\ndeterminant of tiger abundance (Karanth et al. 2004),\ndata on prey densities were unavailable for the KS region.\nWethereforeassessedsevenotherparametersaspotential\npredictors of tiger occurrence: mean proximity to public\nroads, logging roads, settlements and rivers, as well as\naltitude, slope and protected status.\nThe 2 \u00d7 2-km sampling grid was superimposed onto\na forest cover map developed for the KS region by on-\nscreen digitizing five corresponding Landsat 7 ETM+\nsatellite image scenes from 2001. For each grid cell,\naltitude, slope, rivers, public roads, settlements and\nproduced by the Indonesian National Coordination\nAgency for Surveys and Mapping (Bogdor, Indonesia).\nGrid cells of which more than 50% was occupied by\nKSNP were classified as protected. The position of\nlogging roads was identified from GPS location data\ncollected from field surveys and on-screen digitizing of\nsurveys using GPS units. These data were imported into\nan ArcView v3\u00b72 GIS software package (ESRI Inc.,\nRedlands,CA)andconvertedintoa100-m2 rasterformat.\nThe continuous data were extracted for each cell,\nlogarithmically transformed and imported into PRESENCE\nsoftware (Proteus Wildlife Research Consultants, New\nZealand). Tiger detection (1) and non-detection (0) data\nwerethenenteredtoprovideinformationonthedetection\nhistory of each sampling cell for each sampling occasion.\nMapping probability of tiger occurrence\nThree sequential steps were used to obtain unbiased\nestimates of the proportion of area occupied (PAO) by\ntigersintheKSregion.First,fromtheobserveddata(440\ncells surveyed) PRESENCE predicted a tiger detection\nprobability, as tigers will not always be detected within\na cell that they have been using during the survey period.\nSecondly, this detection probability ( p) was incor-\nporated into a logistic regression analysis to determine\nwhich of the seven landscape factors, individually or in\ncombination, best explained the probability of tiger\npresence (). Thus, in PRESENCE, different models\ntoexplaindetectionprobabilitieswerecompared.Models\nincluded detection probability as a constant, p(\u00b7), or as\naffected by different combinations of site-specific covari-\nates, such as altitude, p(Elevation) (MacKenzie et al.\n2002). Candidate models were ranked by their Akaike\ninformationcriterion(AIC)values(Burnham&Anderson\n1998). Thirdly, the best candidate model was used to\ndetermine the PAO by tigers for the KS region. The\npresenceof spatialauto-correlationinthefinalmodelwas\nthen tested by calculating Moran's I statistic (Cliff &\n& Associates, Annadale, VA).\nFrom the final logistic regression model the prob-\nability of tiger presence (P) was constructed by:\nP = eY/(1 + eY) eqn 1\nwhere:\nY = \n+  \ni\nXi\n\nis the constant coefficient (intercept); \n, \n... \ni\nrep-\nresent selected independent variable coefficients; X1\n... Xi\nrepresent their associated independent variables.\nThe SEHM predictions of the probability of tiger\npresence were validated using tiger encounter rate data\nderived from an independent camera trapping survey\nFig. 1.

To minimize problems with spatial auto-\ncorrelation, 50 camera traps, greater than 2 km apart,\nwererandomlyselectedandtheirrespectivetigerencounter\nratecalculated(tigerphotographs/100 days)andSEHM\nscore extracted from the corresponding cell. Spearman's\nrank correlation (rs\n) was used to test whether observed\ntiger encounter rates were correlated with expected\nSEHM scores.\nNext, the tiger SEHM was reclassified to include only\nthose cells with the highest habitat suitability values,\nwhich corresponded to the PAO by tigers (previously\nestimated in PRESENCE). This showed the locations\nof discrete tiger subpopulations, which we defined as\ncore habitat areas and treated independently thereafter.\nWe excluded areas of less than 200 km2 and areas that\nwere not connected to KSNP (and therefore not under\npark management jurisdiction). Tiger density varies\nwith prey biomass (Karanth et al. 2004). We did not have\nestimates of prey biomass but this factor was assumed\nto vary with habitat type. Consequently, the amount of\nlowland hill, hill, submontane and montane forest in\neach core area was calculated to allow an estimation of\ntiger carrying capacity in each core, as described in the\nnext section.\nEstimating tiger subpopulation sizes\nFor each core area, cameras were placed within a\ngrid formation at 1\u00ad4-km spacing for 4\u00ad5 months. To\nincrease the chances of photographing every tiger that\nentered the study site, placements covered all main\nridge and animal trails, leaving no apparent gaps in the\ntrapping area. Camera placements recording few or no\ntiger photographs were moved to another location\nwithin the same cell. Respectively, in the lowland hill,\n958 trap nights. All study sites had evidence of human\ndisturbance, i.e. human signs (footprints and litter) and\nsnare traps set for tiger prey. These sites were considered\nto be representative of other forest patches in KSNP.\nTwo methods were then used to estimate tiger density\nin the four different habitat types.\nFirst,tigerdensityinlowlandhill,hillandsubmontane\nforest was estimated using a capture\u00adrecapture method\n(Karanth & Nichols 1998). Closure tests were performed\nusing CAPTURE software to verify that each tiger popu-\nlation was closed (i.e. no births, deaths, immigrations or\nemigrations)duringthedurationof therespectivecamera\ntrap surveys. In CAPTURE, tiger capture probability ()\nand abundance (N) were estimated using model Mh\nbecause it is more robust and, by incorporating hetero-\ngeneous capture probabilities, produces more realistic\nestimates than the six other models (Rexstad & Burnham\ncalculated by dividing the N by the effective sampling\narea, calculated within the GIS as the camera trapping\narea plus a boundary strip width around the outermost\nSecond, because of the lower number of individual\ntigers photographed (Mt+1\n) in montane forest, it was not\nappropriate to apply the capture\u00adrecapture method\nbecause surveying in habitats where tiger population\ndensities are very low would have required an unrealisti-\ncallylargeamountof timeandfunds.Instead,anempirical\nrelationshipbetweencameratrap-derivedencounterrates\n(x) and tiger density (y), based on 19 studies throughout\nthe tiger's range, was used (Carbone et al. 2001):\nThis method, whilst not as statistically robust as\nthe capture\u00adrecapture method (Jennelle, Runger &\nWibisono & Kinnaird 2003), enabled an assessment of\ntigers in the montane forest study area. For this empirical\nrelationship, it was necessary to estimate 95% predic-\ntion intervals (PI), using a standard quadratic formula\n(Snedecor & Cochran 1989; as in Jennelle, Runger &\n(CI) because the density value was derived from an\nequation of which it was not originally a part.\nFinally, this encounter rate method was also used to\nestimate tiger densities in the lowland hill, hill and\nsubmontane sites for comparison with their previously\nestimated CAPTURE-derived densities.\nUsing the tiger density estimates from each habitat\ntype and the amount of habitat type in each core area,\nthe number of individual adult tigers that could be sup-\nported in each core area was estimated.\nPopulation viability model design\nThe viability of different sized tiger subpopulations to\ndemographic stochasticity and varying poaching\npressures was calculated by developing a tiger-specific\nstage-structured model with a 1-year step using unified\nlife models software (Legendre & Clobert 1995). This\nmodel considered a population as viable if its extinc-\ntion probability was lower than 5% within 50 years of\nPopulation viability model parameters\nOur model was based on the same life-history attributes\nand stages as Karanth & Stith (1999), which included\nmale and female cubs, juveniles, transients and territorial\nbreeders (Table 1). Young male and female tiger cubs\ndispersed and became transients at age 2, when they\nstarted searching for a vacant territory to occupy for\nbreeding. Thus, only adult individuals that had already\nsettled in a territory could reproduce. Transients initially\ntried to settle within territories in their natal core sub-\npopulationareabut,if therewerenoterritoriesavailable,\nthen they would disperse and search in connected core\nareas. Transients died if they failed to settle in their natal\ncore area or subsequently in adjacent, connected areas\nthat were fully occupied. Hence density-independent\nM. Linkie et al.\n \n ,\n \npopulation growth was assumed up to the maximum\nnumber of tigers in a subpopulation. We assumed den-\nsity independence below the ceiling because there were\nno data available to parameterize a density-dependence\nKaranth & Stith (1999) modelled male density as a\nfunction of female density. In contrast, in our model\nmale density was an emergent property of the number\nof occupied and vacant territories and incoming tran-\nsients. That male numbers could fluctuate because of\nintraspecific competition was not considered because\nthe number of females in a population is usually the\nThe demographic parameters used for the model\ncomprisedanageof firstreproductionof 3 years,equal\nsex ratio at birth, mean litter size of three cubs and\ninterbirth interval of 2\u00b75 years. By dividing mean litter\nsize (3) by mean interbirth interval (2\u00b75), we calculated\nthe annual mean litter size (1\u00b72). Demographic stochas-\nticity was applied to both survival and fecundity. Class\nsurvival followed a binomial distribution, where class\nsurvival was parameterized and a random number was\ndrawn from a Bernoulli trial resulting in a tiger surviv-\ning if the result was `1'and dying if the number was `0'.\nFecundity followed a Poisson distribution with mean\nlitter size as a parameter. Our model did not consider\nenvironmental stochasticity because there were no\navailable data to parameterize this.\nThe model considered the spatial arrangement of\nsubpopulationsbutdidnotmimicaspatialarrangement\nof territories within subpopulations. Each subpopula-\ntion was characterized by a maximum number of ter-\nritorial breeders and a maximum number of tigers. The\nfemale : male ratio was 3 : 1 among breeder territories\n(Sunquist 1981). We assumed that only the proportion\nof the best habitats indicated by the estimate of PAO\nwere occupied. Combining that proportion with the\nprobabilityof tigerpresencegaveestimatesof currentcore\npopulation sizes. Clearly, however, ceiling subpopula-\ntion sizes would only be reached if all available habitat\nwas occupied. Consequently, to derive theoretical ceiling\nsubpopulation sizes for the PVA, we used PAO = 1\u00b70 and\nestimated potential subpopulation sizes accordingly.\nTiger poaching was modelled randomly and specified\nthatalllifestagesexceptcubscouldbepoached(Table 1).\nSurvival of these stages was determined by multiplying\nthem by the probability of not being poached (1 - po),\nwhere po is the number of poached tigers divided by the\nnumber of individuals in the targeted classes. Poaching\nwas modelled as being completely additive to initial\nmortality, resulting in more conservative estimates of\nviability. When a tigress with cubs aged 0\u00ad1 years died\n(either naturally or through poaching), her whole litter\ndied.\nThetigersubpopulationsidentifiedineachcoreareawere\nused to model three scenarios to generate predictions\nof extinction probabilities when subpopulations were\n(i) isolated with varying poaching pressures, (ii) con-\nnected with varying poaching pressures and (iii) con-\nnected with varying poaching pressures, with adjacent\nsubpopulations completely protected from poaching.\nFor each scenario, Monte Carlo simulations were run\npopulationqualifiedasextinctonceallclasseswereempty.\nScenario 1: isolation\nThe viability of each subpopulation was determined\nunder poaching pressures ranging from no to five tigers\nremoved per year.

Interconnection was modelled by corridor\npermeability, which allowed either 25% or 50% of tran-\nsients from one subpopulation to search and settle within\nterritoriesinanadjacentandconnectedsubpopulation, if\nno vacant territories were available in their own area.\nScenario 3: connectivity with anti-poaching measures\nThe PVA models were repeated as for scenario 2, but\nanti-poaching measures were incorporated into the\nmodels.

Only two\nmodels explaining tiger detection received strong sup-\nport (models 1 and 2; Table 2) and together these had\nan Akaike weight of 1\u00b70. Both of these models included\ndistance to roads as an important parameter. Model 1\nhad the highest Akaike weight and suggested that tiger\noccupancy rates were higher further from public roads,\nwhile detection rates were also influenced by proximity\nto roads. Model 1 had a tiger detection probability of\ncated by having the smallest SE, and was not affected\nby spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0\u00b704, P > 0\u00b71).\nTheresultof thismodelwasusedtoconstructtheSEHM.\nThetigerSEHMwasconstructedfromasinglefactor,\ndistancetopublicroads.Itshowedthatgood-quality\ntiger habitat predominantly occurred inside KSNP\n(Fig. 2).Althoughlargeblocksof foresthabitatdidoccur\noutside KSNP, particularly in the north, the position of\nthis forest in relation to public roads reduced it to poor-\nquality tiger habitat.\nThe SEHM predictions of the probability of tiger\npresence were positively correlated with tiger encounter\nrates that were derived from independent camera trap\nThe final logistic regression model gave an overall esti-\nof the most suitable forest habitat was selected from the\nKS region.

Our\nSEHM approach has overcome the three main problems\nassociated with RSF models by: (i) accounting for false\nabsencesbyincorporatingadetectionprobabilitythrough\nrepeat surveys; (ii) statistically testing for spatial auto-\ncorrelation (Lennon 1999); and (iii) not arbitrarily defin-\ning suitable habitat as RSF > 0\u00b75 (Boyce & MacDonald\n1999) but instead linking this to occupancy through the\nPAO estimate.\nFrom the KS region, absolute tiger abundance was\ndetermined from densities derived from different forest\ntypes. However, the SEHM identified that forest pro-\nximity to roads influenced relative tiger abundance. A\nretrospective approach might therefore develop a SEHM\nand use the significant landscape factors to determine\ncamera trapping sites. We partially controlled for the\neffect of roads on tiger density because camera traps\nextended from the forest edge nearest to roads, towards\ntheforestinteriorfurthestfromroads.However,thiswas\nnotpossibleformontaneforestasnoneexistedattheforest\nedge. Overall, tiger density still showed a relationship\nFig. 4.

Furthermore, tiger densities might have\nbeen estimated in each habitat type in each core area.\nHowever, this would have taken more than 5 years, mak-\ning the assessment process less useful.\nDifficulties associated with PVA modelling frequently\narise because the requisite data are lacking. In order to\nminimize such difficulties, we evaluated relative, rather\nthan absolute, extinction risk, with projections over a\nshort time period, and with stochasticity modelled by\ntrue probability sampling, rather than by truncating\nnumbers (Burgman & Possingham 2000). Recognizing\nconcerns over the application of PVA, our PVA predic-\ntionscomprisedonlypartof adecision-supporttool,as\nopposed to a decision-making tool, which has greater\nIn KSNP, the smaller subpopulations in cores 1 and\n3, whilst more prone to extinction through stochastic\nprocesses (Kenney et al. 1995), were shown to be viable\nas long as poaching was minimized. Similarly, Karanth\n& Stith (1999) found that isolated tiger populations\ncontaining only six breeding females could be demo-\ngraphically viable. This contrasts with the findings of\nReedet al.(2003),thataminimumpopulationof between\nlong-term demographic and genetic viability (Reed et al.\n2003). While importantly focusing attention on the\nvulnerability of wild tiger populations, Reed et al.'s\n(2003) estimates were derived from a non-tiger-specific\nPVA model, which did not model tiger demographic\npatterns at the fine scale used in our study. Furthermore,\nReed et al. (2003) modelled genetic stochasticity, for\nwhich data on the number of lethal equivalents are scarce\nin most carnivore populations. Therefore, we found it\nmore useful to concentrate on measurable demographic\nparameters (Beissinger & Westphal 1998; Wiegand et al.\n1998). Our PVA highlighted the fragility of tigers in\ncore 4, especially if subjected to regular poaching. How-\never, tigers still persist in core 4, which suggests that the\nphysical barrier presented by the non-asphalt road that\ndivides cores 4 and 2 does not prevent their movement.\nIf future camera trapping on either side of the road\nconfirms connectivity between cores 4 and 2, then future\nmodelling could consider their viability as a single\ncombined core. Finally, our PVA might be advanced by\ncollectingandincorporatingbreedingsitedatafor model-\nling source\u00adsink metapopulations (Wikramanayake\nFor KSNP, the PVA models emphasized the merits\nof concentrating anti-poaching effort on the smallest\nsubpopulations and maintaining habitat connectivity\nbetween core 2 and both cores 1 and 4.

This stresses the importance of focusing anti-\npoaching efforts on core 3, which is the strategy that the\nPVA predicted to provide the greatest benefits for this\ncore.However,theseconservationstrategiesaredependent\non future poaching and deforestation patterns in and\naround each core area (Pressey & Taffs 2001).

Thus, within each core area, separate\ndetection\u00adnon-detection surveys should be conducted\non a yearly basis to determine the change in tiger popu-\nlation trends (i.e. PAO estimates) so that the success of\ntiger conservation strategies in KSNP can be evaluated.\nThe construction of a road through high-quality tiger\nhabitat in Russia was found to reduce a source popu-\nlation to a sink population that no longer provided sup-\nplementary tigers to neighbouring areas (Kerley et al.\n2002).
