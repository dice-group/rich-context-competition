There have been few cognitive-based\ninvestigations of jealousy, however. Here we investigated sex differences in implicit\nprocessing of jealousy-based information.

Men made significantly\nmore errors when asked to classify as pleasant, words indicating sexual infidelity. In\nExperiment 2, we modified the Stroop task to include words that depicted infidelity-related\ntopics in three priming conditions: sexual infidelity priming, emotional infidelity priming,\nand a no priming control. Men were significantly slower to respond after being primed with\nsexual infidelity scenarios. The effect of sexual infidelity priming was not word-category\nspecific, suggesting that cognition about a partner's sexual infidelity hijacks general\ncognitive and attentional processing. These findings suggest that men may automatically\nclassify information about sexual infidelity as negative and that the automatic negative\nprocessing of sexual infidelity takes precedent over other types of immediate cognition.\n",

Burch\nJealousy-based cognition\nIntroduction\nJealousy is a leading cause of female-directed intimate partner abuse, rape, and\nwomen are raped or physically assaulted by an intimate partner each year in the United\nStates and 8% of women report having been stalked by an intimate partner at some point in\ntheir lives (Tjaden and Thoennes, 1998a; 1998b). It has been hypothesized that men's\njealous, controlling and sometimes violent behavior may have evolved to prevent or punish\na partner's defection from the relationship (see Buss, 2002, for review).\nHumans engage in \"social monogamy,\" whereby males and females form\npartnerships and cooperate to raise offspring. Social monogamy may have evolved in\nhumans because of the need for bi-parental investment in altricial offspring. Social\nmonogamy does not imply genetic monogamy, however. In fact, genetic monogamy is the\nexception rather than the rule in the animal kingdom (e.g., Morell, 1998). Social\nmonogamy has been defined by Gillette, Jaeger, and Peterson (2000, p.1241), \"as occurring\nwhen two heterosexual adults, exclusive of kin directed behavior, direct significantly less\naggression and significantly more submission towards each other, and/or spend\nsignificantly more time associating with each other relative to other adult heterosexual\nconspecifics.\" In humans, social monogamy typically leads to marriage. Today, marriage is\nprevalent in every known culture and so, too, is infidelity (Anderson, 2006; Bellis, Hughes,\nThe occurrence of human extra-pair paternity varies widely, from 1-30%, with the\nFlores, Barton, Marty-Gonzales, Rivas and Chakbroty, 1999; Neale, Neale, and Sullivan,\ncuckolded--being deceived into investing resources in a child which one has not sired--\nmen may have evolved a number of anti-cuckoldry tactics (Gallup and Burch, 2006; Platek\nand Shackelford, 2006), one of which is mate guarding. Mate guarding refers to the process\nof safeguarding access to a mate as well as preventing other males from infringing on their\nsignificant other (Buss, 1988). This practice has been observed in a variety of species,\nespecially where parental investment by both parents is likely or common. Several\nevolutionary scientists have theorized that jealousy has evolved as a mate guarding tactic to\nhelp ensure that one's partner does not abandon the partnership, either temporarily (e.g.,\ninfidelity) or permanently (e.g., divorce; Buss 1988; Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Flinn,\n1988). Examples of mate guarding include a broad range of behaviors including making\noneself more attractive for one's partner to physically harmful acts such as domestic\nviolence. These tactics may be driven by reproductive (genetic) fitness gains/losses and\nultimately aid a male's confidence in paternity. If males are unsuccessful at preventing\ninfidelity by their mate, they risk genetic cuckoldry (Buss, 2002) and might therefore\nprovision offspring which share no genes in common with him. Females who are not\nsuccessful at mate guarding can also incur risks. For example, unsuccessful mate guarding\nby a female could lead to loss of resource investment by the male (e.g., diversion of\nfinancial and other resources to other sexual partners). Furthermore, social resources in the\nJealousy-based cognition\nform of alliances brought to the relationship by one partner may be lost due to breakup\nSex differences in reaction to a partner's emotional and sexual infidelity are well\ndocumented and are hypothesized to be attributable to recurrent sex-specific adaptive\nproblems (Buss, Larsen, Westen, and Semmelroth, 1992; Buss and Shackelford, 1997;\nPlatek and Thomson, 2007; Shackelford et al., 2004). Because of the adaptive problem of\npaternal uncertainty, men more than women are upset by a partner's sexual infidelity (e.g.,\nhaving sex with someone else). Because of the adaptive concern with parental investment\nand resource diversion, women are more upset than men by a partner's emotional infidelity\n(e.g., falling in love with someone else; Buss et al., 1992; Buss and Shackelford 1997;\nShackelford et al. 2000). In Buss et al.'s (1992) landmark study, participants were asked to\nimagine a romantic partner engaging in a sexual infidelity or emotional infidelity, and to\nselect which of the two would be more upsetting. Although Buss et al.'s (1992) hypotheses\nand results have been criticized (Buller, 2005; DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey,\nconsensus that these findings are robust (see Buss and Haselton, 2005; Shackelford, Buss,\nWiederman and Kendall, 1999). There is a growing number of studies, including cross-\ncultural studies and psychophysiological studies, that have provided convergent support for\nthe evolutionary hypothesis of sex differences in jealousy (see Buunk, Angleitner, Oubaid,\n1993; Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens and Thompson, 2002; Sagarin, Becker, Guadagno, Nicastle,\nHowever, only a few studies have investigated the possible cognitive mechanisms involved\nin jealousy-based information processing.\nSch\u00fctzwohl (2004) replicated Buss et al.'s (1992) study, substituting self-report\nsurveys with a computerized task in which reaction times were assessed. Although both\nmen and women reported greater upset to emotional infidelity scenarios, more men than\nwomen selected a partner's sexual infidelity as more upsetting. Women selecting emotional\ninfidelity as more upsetting reached their decision faster than women selecting sexual\ninfidelity. In contrast, men selecting sexual infidelity as more upsetting reached their\ndecision faster than men selecting emotional infidelity as more upsetting.\nSch\u00fctzwohl and Koch (2004) investigated the ability to recall cues to sexual and\nemotional infidelities. Participants were presented one of several stories about a couple\nspending an evening together. The stories were presented so that infidelity appeared to be\nneither very likely nor very unlikely. A week later, participants returned to the lab and were\nunexpectedly asked to recall what they remembered from the story. Men recalled more cues\nto sexual infidelity and women recalled more of cues to emotional infidelity. In a follow up\nstudy, Sch\u00fctzwohl (2005) investigated thresholds of jealous feelings. Participants were\npresented cues signaling either a mate's sexual or emotional infidelity and were asked to\nindicate which cue to infidelity elicited \"a first sign of feeling jealous\" and to indicate\nwhich cue would cause them to reply \"I won't take it any longer. My jealousy feeling is\nintolerable\" while reaction times were recorded. There were no sex differences found with\nregard to the number of cues to sexual or emotional infidelity until the first threshold. After\nthe first feeling of jealousy had been identified, men needed fewer cues to sexual infidelity\nJealousy-based cognition\nand women needed fewer cues to emotional infidelity until the second threshold. Men were\nsignificantly faster in determining the two thresholds for sexual infidelity and women were\nfaster for cues to emotional infidelity.\nHere we used two different tasks to investigate the cognitive-emotional aspects of a\nputative jealousy mechanism. We used the implicit associations test (IAT; see Greenwald,\nMcGhee, and Schwartz, 1998; Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji, 2003) to measure implicit\nassociations when participants were asked to categorize words depicting sexual infidelity or\nemotional infidelity as either positive or negative. Guided by an evolutionary psychological\nperspective, we predicted a sex-specific reaction time advantage and performance\ndecrement associated with categorizing different types of infidelity-related words as\npositive or negative. Specifically, we predicted that men would show greater bias (slower\nreaction time and increased error rate) to words depicting sexual jealousy and that women\nwould show greater bias to words depicting emotional infidelity.\nIn a second experiment, we modified the Stroop task to measure cognitive effects\nwhen primed with infidelity scenarios. The Stroop task has been shown to be a reliable\nassessment of measuring attentional bias (Williams, Matthews, and MacLeod, 1996) and\nresults of modified Stroop tasks have shown slowed reaction time to emotionally provoking\nstimuli (Egolf and Schmuckle, 2004; Intili and Tarrier, 1998; Lusher, Chandler, and Ball,\n2004). Due to the competing information processing tapping attention, we predicted that\nmen would have slower reaction times and commit more errors when primed with a sexual\ninfidelity scenario and that women would have slower reaction times and commit more\nerrors when primed with an emotional infidelity scenario.\nMaterials and Methods\nExperiment 1: Implicit Association to Infidelity-Related Words\nParticipants\nSixty-nine undergraduates (34 men; 35 women, M age = 20.4) from a Northeastern\nUnited States university volunteered for participation. All participants gave written\ninformed consent and received course extra credit for their participation. The study was\napproved by the local Institutional Review Board.\nApparatus and Procedures\nStimuli were presented to participants on a Gateway desktop with a 15\" monitor.\nParticipants were seated 35-40 cm away from the screen. The experiment was run using\nPresentation\u00ae software (Version 0.70, www.neuro-bs.com). In individual sessions,\nparticipants were administered a version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT; see\nGreenwald et al., 1998, and Greenwald et al., 2003). The IAT is a reaction time task used to\nassess implicit associations between social categories (e.g., race) and semantic concepts\n(e.g., unpleasantness). Implicit attitudes are thought to be manifest actions or judgments\nthat are under the control of automatically activated evaluations without the performer's\nawareness of that causation (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995). The reasoning behind using the\nIAT in measuring reactions to jealousy information is that it should be easier for one to\ncategorize words typically associated together than it would be for dissimilar words. For\nexample, it would be easier to categorize the word \"flower\" with the category of pleasant,\nJealousy-based cognition\nthan say the word \"death.\" We used the IAT to investigate sex differences when engaging\nin a modified version of the IAT designed to investigate sex-specific adaptive processing of\nupset to a partner's infidelity. When the stimuli produce cognitive dissonance, longer\nreaction times and increased number of errors result. We modified the IAT to include\npresentation of stimulus words differentially associated with sexual infidelity or with\nemotional infidelity (e.g. abandonment, unfaithful, extramarital, affair, unromantic). For\nexample, if \"adultery\" is associated with sexual infidelity, than we predicted that men\nwould be slower to categorize the word \"adultery\" with the category Positive + Sexual\nInfidelity than they would be to categorize it in the Negative + Sexual Infidelity category.\nTwenty words related to infidelity were rated by 87 undergraduates and eight expert\njudges (professors and graduate students who conduct research on sex differences in\njealousy) who did not participate in the study. Words rated as indicating either emotional\nor sexual infidelity by >80% of raters were used as stimuli in the IAT. Participants were\npresented with one word on the screen at a time. In the first block of trials, participants\ncategorized words as either pleasant or unpleasant. In the second block, they categorized\nwords associated with either sexual infidelity or emotional infidelity. A definition of each\ninfidelity type was provided. In the third block of trials, participants were randomly shown\nthe positive, negative, and infidelity-related words and asked to categorize each as either\n\"pleasant\" or \"unpleasant\" and \"emotional infidelity\" or \"sexual infidelity\" in a\ncounterbalanced design. Reaction time was measured by how long it took them to enter the\n\"correct\" answer and answers were considered \"errors\" when they were not categorized\nproperly. An example of an error would be categorizing the word \"cheating\" in the\npleasant/emotional infidelity category.\nResults\nResults for the IAT supported the prediction that men would show greater bias to\nwords depicting sexual jealousy, but did not support the prediction that women would show\ngreater bias to words depicting emotional infidelity. There were no differences in reaction\ntime between men and women, but we did find an effect for number of errors committed.\nMen made significantly more errors than women when asked to classify sexual infidelity\np <.05; see Figure 1). The other conditions although not statistically significant showed\ntrends in support of our predictions for sex differences. (see Table 1 for full results).\nAlthough the results did not fully support the predictions (i.e., there was no overall\nreaction time effect or an error effect for emotional infidelity in women), there was\nevidence that men have greater difficulty than women when asked to categorize a word\nsuggestive of sexual infidelity as being positive. Reference to sexual infidelity may produce\ngreater interference in the cognitive abilities of men than emotional infidelity does for\nwomen, a finding that is also evident in Experiment 2.\nJealousy-based cognition\nTable 1: Means (standard deviation) for the Implicit Association Test\nMales Females\nReaction Time -Positive\n+ Emotional Infidelity\nWords\nReaction Time -\n(Positive + Sexual\nInfidelity Words\nErrors \u00ad Positive +\nEmotional Infidelity\nWords\nErrors \u00ad Positive and\nSexual Infidelity Words\nFigure 1: IAT number of errors\nFemale\nMale\nMean number of errors\nNumber of errors to\npositive + sexual\ninfidelity words\nNumber of errors to\npositive + emotional\ninfidelity words\nNumber of Errors\nJealousy-based cognition\nExperiment 2: Stroop Test Primed with Infidelity Scenarios\nParticipants\nSixty-eight undergraduates (33 men; 35 women M age = 21.7) from a Northeastern\nUnited States university volunteered for participation. All participants gave written\ninformed consent and received course extra credit for their participation.\nApparatus and Procedures\nStimuli were presented to participants on a Gateway desktop computer with a 15\"\nmonitor. Participants were seated 35-40 cm away from the screen. The experiment was run\nin SuperLab\u00ae 2.0 and a Radio Shack desktop computer microphone (model #33-3031) was\nused to record responses. The cognitive mechanism theoretically associated with this task is\ninhibition; i.e., participants must inhibit their initial response (e.g., what the word says) and\nreport something different (e.g., color of word). Modified emotional Stroop tests are\ndesigned to investigate emotional words instead of the color words in the initial test (e.g.,\nseeing the word \"red\" in green ink). The modified tests are typically designed to investigate\nneutral vs. anxiety provoking terms. Research has shown that individuals with\npsychological disorders show a longer reaction time (RT) during an emotional Stroop test\nwhen those words are related to their clinical concerns (e.g., Thomas, Johnstone, and\nGonsalvez, 2006). The slower reaction time has been attributed to attentional bias, but this\ninterpretation has been disputed and has been argued to \"demonstrate interference from\npersonally relevant stimuli, rather than a clean attentional bias\" (see Teachman, Smith-\nJanik, and Saporito, in press).\nIn the Stroop task, participants responded to the word on the screen by saying the\ncolor of the word into the microphone. The Stroop task began with a practice round\nconsisting of color naming (each item consists of five O's, with each of the series printed in\none of five colors [red, orange, green, brown, and blue]). In the second part of the practice\nround, participants are asked to say the color of the word shown on the screen. Each item\nwas one of five colored words with no words being presented in their own color (e.g.,\nseeing the word red in the color blue). There were three priming conditions: a control\ncondition, an emotional infidelity condition, and a sexual infidelity condition. After\npriming participants were randomly shown both neutral words and infidelity-related words\nin each condition. Similar to Intilli and Tarrier (1998), the categorized words included\nMcKenna emotional words (a strong emotional connotation, e.g., crash, fail, fear, death,\nand grief), McKenna control words (neutral words matched to the previous set on word\nlength; e.g., clock, gate, note, thumb, field), infidelity target words (e.g., suspicious, rival,\nunfaithful, cheating, false) and control words (words matched for word length and\nfrequency of usage to the infidelity target words; e.g., needlework, flask, helicopter,\nmetaphor, stair).\nIn the emotional infidelity condition, participants were asked to think about and\nvisualize their partner spending time with someone else or having an interest in someone\nelse without having a sexual relationship with that person. In the sexual infidelity condition,\nparticipants were asked to imagine their partner having a one-night stand or sexual \"fling\"\nwith someone else but not having any feelings for this individual. In the control condition,\nparticipants were not asked to imagine any type of scenario. The control condition was\nJealousy-based cognition\nalways run first followed by the sexual and emotional infidelity priming conditions using a\ncounterbalanced design. We were not able to record vocal response errors--e.g., saying\n\"blue\" when the word was green. SuperLab\u00ae 2.0 only has the capability to record reaction\ntime in this type of task.\nTable 2: Means (standard deviation) for the control and priming conditions in the Stroop task:\nResults\nReaction times less than 300 ms and greater than 3500 ms were excluded from\nanalysis (similar to Yovel and Mineka, 2004). These outlier reaction times would typically\noccur because the microphone may not have picked up their initial response.\nThe results of the Stroop task were consistent with our predictions. We found a\nmain effect for the priming conditions, F (2, 132) = 4.29, p < .05. A significant interaction\nreaction time was longer when primed with sexual infidelity (see Table 2). This suggests\nthat the priming conditions did impact the reaction time of participants and that a\nsignificant sex difference exists. There were four categorizations used within each of the\npriming conditions. Following, we present key results for each of the four categorizations\nacross conditions.\nIn the Infidelity Control category, there was no overall main effect, F (2, 132) =\n2.31, p > .05, and no interaction between the Infidelity control words and sex, F (2,132) =\np >.05, but there was a significant interaction between the infidelity target words and sex, F\nsexual infidelity (See Figures 2a and 2b). In the McKenna Control category, there was an\ncategory, there was a significant main effect, F (2, 132) = 4.77, p = .01, and a significant\nJealousy-based cognition\nFigure 2: (a) Mean reaction time for jealousy target words across conditions (b) Mean\nreaction time for jealousy control words across conditions\nJealousy-based cognition\nFigure 3: (a) Mean reaction time for McKenna target words across conditions (b) Mean\nreaction time for McKenna control words across conditions\nJealousy-based cognition\nA within-participants ANOVA generated a main effect for the Infidelity and\nwhen this test was conducted on the target words: a main effect was not observed for the\nInfidelity and McKenna target words, F (2, 132) = 2.47, p > .05, but there was a significant\nMean scores by category).\nTable 3: Mean Reaction Time (standard deviation) as a function of conditions used in the\nStroop task\nCategory Condition Male Female\nJealousy Control\nJealousy Target\nMcKenna Control\nMcKenna Target\nDiscussion\nThe current results, for men, are consistent with the evolutionary hypothesis of sex\ndifferences in reaction to a partner's infidelity. These results support the hypothesis for a\nmale bias to processing information about sexual infidelity implicitly, which further\nsupports the hypothesis of an evolved cognitive adaptation for the detection and correction\nof infidelity (Shackelford, 2003). When men are performing implicit cognitive tasks while\nasked to think about sexual infidelity, the interference caused by these thoughts slows\nperformance and produces more errors. The male mind may be more likely to attend to\nsexual infidelity because this would have been an adaptive mate guarding strategy. There\nmay be a tradeoff between processing cognitive tasks and mate guarding, and for men's\nfitness; i.e., solving the adaptive problem of maintaining their partner's fidelity might\noverride other types of cognitive processing, and consequently hijack attentional resources\nbeing utilized to process other types of information in their environment.\nJealousy-based cognition\nWe did not find support for the prediction that women would have a slower reaction\ntime and commit more errors when primed with an emotional infidelity scenario. These\ndata are in contrast to recent evidence indicating that women are more attuned to\ninformation about emotional infidelity (Buss et al., 1992; Buss and Shackelford, 1997;\nand Koch, 2004; Shackelford et al., 2000). For women, emotional infidelity might not\nimpact cognitive systems involved in attention to the same degree that sexual infidelity\ndoes for men. This finding is consistent with the nature of sexual infidelity and emotional\ninfidelity: the detection of sexual infidelity can occur in one instance; that is the discovery\nof a partner's sexual infidelity can happen quickly and once it is known or certain it is\nclear. However, emotional infidelity often takes time to develop, thus the discovery of\nemotional infidelity may trigger cognitive processes involved with episodic memory (e.g.,\nremembering episodes when a partner has expressed emotional attachment to another)\nrather than attention.\nThis research has several limitations. The samples were limited to university\nstudents. Replication of this study using a sample with more experience in romantic\nrelationships would help to establish the generalizability of the results. Individuals who are\nolder than those in the current young adult college samples may be more likely to have had\nserious long-term relationships and more relationships in which they experienced a\npartner's infidelity. One of the limitations experienced with the Stroop task was that the\nsoftware we used was unable to record errors (e.g., saying \"blue\" when the word was\ngreen). Although the reaction time information did provide some of the information we\nsought, the number and type of errors across conditions might have provided more\nevidence and better comparison to the Implicit Association Test. Future research should\ncontinue to investigate what types of cognitive processing (e.g., attention, memory) is\nimpacted by strategies selected to detect a partner's infidelity.\nAlthough both sexes are upset by a partner's infidelities, the current research\nsuggests that men's cognitive skills may be especially impacted by processing information\nrelated to a partner's sexual infidelity. This research adds to a growing literature on the\nemotion of jealousy and on the sex differences in experienced jealousy. A better\nunderstanding on the cognitive effects of experiencing jealousy might result in improving\nthe care provided to individuals who experience extreme levels of jealousy and may lead to\nbetter identifying potentially dangerous behaviors which result from extreme jealous\nbehavior.\n"
