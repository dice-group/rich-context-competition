The data consist of samples of the\nUS noninstitutionalized civilian popu-\nlation, which were obtained using a\nstratified multistage probability de-\nsign with planned oversampling of cer-\ntain age and racial/ethnic groups.17\nyears and older interviewed for socio-\ndemographic, medical, and family in-\nformation and had a full medical ex-\namination at the medical examination\nthe interview sample aged 40 years and\nined sample.18 The NHANES protocol\nwas approved by a human subjects re-\nview board and written informed con-\nsent was obtained from all partici-\npants.\nFundus Photography\nCR6-45NM ophthalmic digital imaging\nsystem and Canon EOS 10D digital\ncamera (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) to take\n2 digital images per eye (total 4 im-\nages per participant) through a non-\npharmacologically dilated pupil. Par-\nticipants were seated in a windowless\nroom with the lights turned off to al-\nlow the pupils to dilate naturally in\npreparation for the retinal imaging ex-\namination. One image was centered on\nthe macula and the second on the op-\ntic nerve. The digital images were\ngraded by masked photo graders at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin Ocular Epide-\nmiologic Reading Center, Madison,\nusing a modification of the Airlie House\ngrading of digital images and quality\ncontrol by the Wisconsin group have\nbeen described in detail previously.22\nSurvey participants who had no light\nperception or severe visual impair-\nment in both eyes or had a severe in-\nfection in one or both eyes were ex-\ncluded (n = 13). Complete data of\nfundus photographs of both eyes were\naged 40 years and older who had full\nmedical examinations.\nReasons for having incomplete data\ntime to finish the examination (ie, ar-\nmunication problems (n=40; 3%), and\nothers. Those individuals with incom-\nplete data were more likely to be older,\nnon-Hispanic black, with less than a\nhigh school education, higher systolic\nblood pressure, higher glycated hemo-\nglobin A1c\nlevel, and a history of using\ninsulin than participants with com-\nplete gradable photographs (all\nP.001). We further examined the po-\ntential influence of nonresponse bias\ndue to the exclusion of participants\nwithout complete gradable photo-\ngraphs by adjusting the original sam-\npling weights using the standard\nusing these adjusted weights led to only\nminor differences in point and vari-\nance estimates (0%-0.5%), indicating\nminimal impact of nonresponse; there-\nfore, we present all estimates using the\noriginal sampling weights.\nDiabetic retinopathy was defined as\nthe presence of 1 or more retinal mi-\ncroaneurysms or retinal blot hemor-\nrhages with or without more severe le-\nsions (hard exudates, soft exudates,\nintraretinal microvascular abnormali-\nties, venous beading, retinal new ves-\nsels, preretinal and vitreous hemor-\nrhage, and fibroproliferans) using the\nEarly Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy\nStudy (ETDRS) grading standards.19\nDiabetic retinopathy was further\ncategorized as nonproliferative and\nproliferative determined by assess-\nment of the presence of retinal neo-\nvascularization or abnormal growth of\nnew retinal blood vessels into the vit-\nreous. Vision-threatening diabetic\nretinopathy, a level that may soon\nresult in vision loss if left untreated,\nwas defined as the presence of severe\nnonproliferative diabetic retinopathy,\nproliferative diabetic retinopathy, or\nclinically significant macular edema.\nClinically significant macular edema\nwas considered present when edema\ninvolved the fovea or was within 500\nmicrons of the fovea, or when a\n1disc area of edema was present\nwith at least a portion of it within the\nmacula. Outcomes for this study were\ndefined on the basis of the worse of\nthe 2 eyes.\nOther Measurements\nDiabetes was defined as self-report of\na previous diagnosis of the disease by\na clinician (excluding gestational dia-\nbetes mellitus) or hemoglobin A1c\nof\n6.5% or greater (American Diabetes As-\nsociation's new diagnostic criterion for\nundiagnosed diabetes).25 Although he-\nmoglobin A1c\ndoes not capture com-\npletely the increased risk of microvas-\ncular complications due to diabetes,26\nthe diagnostic hemoglobin A1c\ncut point\nof 6.5% was determined to be an in-\nflection point for retinopathy preva-\nlence, as is also true for the diagnostic\nthresholds of the glucose-based\ndiagnosed diabetes; n=211 for undiag-\nnosed diabetes).\nAll participants were asked about\ntheir age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nMexican American, and others [includ-\ning those who selected multiple races\nand non-Mexican American Hispan-\nics]), educational attainment (less than\nhigh school, high school education, or\nhigher), and health insurance status.\nConsistent with previous epidemio-\nlogic studies,29-31 risk factors for dia-\nbetic retinopathy and vision-threaten-\ning diabetic retinopathy (hemoglobin\n, duration of diabetes, insulin use\n[yes/no], systolic and diastolic blood\npressure, body mass index [BMI, cal-\nculated as weight in kilograms di-\nvided by height in meters squared], cur-\nrent smoking status [yes/no], and\nhistoryofcardiovasculardiseases[CVD;\nyes/no]) were examined. Hemoglobin\n, duration of diabetes, and systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure were used\nas continuous variables. Hemoglobin\nwas used as the surrogate for blood\nglucose level and measured by a high-\nperformance liquid chromatographic\nassay as used in the Diabetes Control\nand Complications Trial.7 Insulin\ntherapy indicated that the participant\nhad type 1 diabetes or their diabetes\ncould not otherwise be controlled with-\nout insulin.

If undiagnosed\ndiabetes were excluded from our\nsample, our estimates for diabetic reti-\nnopathy and vision-threatening dia-\nbetic retinopathy among self-reported\ndiagnosed diabetes would be 32.8%\nIt is also possible that the lower\nprevalence reported in this study re-\nflects a true reduction in the preva-\nlence of diabetic retinopathy. Rates of\nother diabetic complications have de-\nclined during recent decades. For ex-\nample, Geiss et al34 found that hospi-\ntalization rate for lower extremity\namputations among individuals with\nother recent study found that age-\nadjusted diabetes-related end-stage re-\neffective management of blood glu-\ncose levels, blood pressure, and serum\nlipid levels, is likely to reduce the in-\ncidence of diabetic retinopathy. Con-\nversely, it might also lead to increased\nTable 2.

More-\nover, a recent longitudinal cohort study\nsuggested that low vision and blind-\nness could be substantially reduced\namong individuals with diagnosed\ndiabetes who received guideline-\nrecommended levels of care.36\nWe found that the age-standardized\nprevalences of diabetic retinopathy and\nvision-threatening diabetic retinopa-\nthy were statistically significantly dif-\nferent between NHANES III and\nences between surveys may be real or\nmay be attributed to improved meth-\nods used to photograph the fundus in\ncompared with NHANES III. Two digi-\ntal 45\u00b0 color images of both eyes were\nin NHANES III only one 45\u00b0 color film\nimage from 1 eye was taken. Although\nsome studies have shown grading of\ndigital images to have similar sensitiv-\nity for detecting diabetic retinopathy as\ngrading of film images, it is possible that\nthe current method led to increased de-\ntection of both diabetic retinopathy and\nvision-threatening diabetic retinopa-\nthy because of more retina being as-\nsessed in 2 images compared with 1 and\nhigher-quality digital images com-\npared with earlier film images used in\nNHANES III, thus limiting our ability\nto directly compare results from\nA previous analysis of NHANES III\ndata by Harris et al12 suggests that the\nprevalence of diabetic retinopathy was\n46% higher in non-Hispanic black\nindividuals and 84% higher in Mexi-\ncan American individuals than in\nnon-Hispanic white individuals.\nAlthough not statistically significant\nat a .05 level, we also found that\namong individuals with diabetes, non-\nHispanic black individuals (47%\nhigher) and Mexican American indi-\nviduals (29% higher) had a higher\ncrude prevalence of diabetic retinopa-\nthy than their non-Hispanic white\ncounterparts. Moreover, the preva-\nlence of vision-threatening diabetic\nretinopathy in individuals with diabe-\ntes was 190% higher in non-Hispanic\nblack individuals and 130% higher in\nMexican American individuals than in\nnon-Hispanic white individuals. This\nmay be due to individuals of non-\nHispanic black and Mexican Ameri-\ncan heritage being more likely to have\npoorer glycemic control and being\nless likely to be screened and treated\nfor diabetic retinopathy.37 Data from\nNational Health Interview Survey also\nsuggest that non-Hispanic black indi-\nviduals and Hispanics are less likely to\nuse eye care services.38 These findings\nlend further insight to inform national\nefforts to reduce disparities in care\namong racial/ethnic and socioeco-\nnomic groups and preserve sight for\nall adults in the United States.\nConsistent with previous research,\nwe found that higher levels of hemo-\nglobin A1c\n, longer duration of diabe-\ntes, insulin use, and higher systolic\nblood pressure were independently\nassociated with diabetic retinopathy\nTable 3.

The new availability of care for\nvulnerable sections of the population\nshould have demonstrable effect on\nrisk of blindness in diabetes. Further-\nmore, primary prevention of diabetes,\nincluding identifying and protecting\nindividuals at risk (ie, by reduced\nbody weight and increased physical\nactivity), may also help delay the\nonset of type 2 diabetes and reduce\ncomplications of diabetic retinopathy.\nWe also found an inverse relationship\nbetween diastolic blood pressure and\nthe presence of diabetic retinopathy.\nThe underlying reason remains unex-\nplained and requires further explora-\ntion. It could be due to selective par-\nticipation bias. However, previous\nalso suggested a possible association\nbetween pulse pressure (difference\nbetween systolic and diastolic blood\npressure) and diabetic retinopathy.\nThe strengths of this study include\nits population-based national sample,\nits inclusion of individuals with undi-\nagnosed diabetes, and improved\ndetection of retinopathy due to use of\ndigital fundus images of both eyes.\nThis improved methodology results in\nestimates that are less biased than\nthose obtained from NHANES III.\nHowever, individuals without diabe-\ntes may have retinopathy because of\nhigher glucose level or hypertension,\nwhich is not assessed in the current\nstudy. Also, due to the infrequency of\nproliferative diabetic retinopathy\n(n = 23) and clinically significant\nmacular edema (n = 37), we were\nunable to provide meaningful esti-\nmates by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.\nOur study is subject to several limi-\ntations. First, individuals who were in-\nstitutionalized (eg, nursing home resi-\ndents) were not included in the\nNHANES, which may have led to an un-\nderestimate of diabetic retinopathy\nprevalence. Second, we could not dis-\ntinguish between type 1 and type 2 dia-\nbetes and the specific risk of diabetic\nretinopathy complications. Third, there\nwere substantial numbers of eligible in-\ndividuals with diabetes who did not\nhave photographs that could be graded,\nwhich may negatively bias estimates of\ndiabetic retinopathy prevalence. Sur-\nvey participants who had no light per-\nception or severe visual impairment in\nboth eyes, or a severe infection in 1 or\nboth eyes were excluded--this might\nnegatively bias the prevalence esti-\nmates. Small sample sizes might have\nprevented us from detecting differ-\nences, if they existed, between and\namong subgroups. Due to limitations\ninherent with the NHANES sampling\nframe, we were unable to estimate the\nprevalence of diabetic retinopathy and\nvision-threatening diabetic retinopa-\nthy among racial/ethnic groups other\nthan non-Hispanic white individuals,\nnon-Hispanic black individuals, and\nMexican American individuals.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOurdatademonstratethatahighpreva-\nlenceofdiabeticretinopathyandvision-\nthreatening diabetic retinopathy in the\nUnited States exists, especially among\nracial/ethnic minorities.

With the\nagingofthepopulationandtheincreas-\ning proportion of the population with\ndiverse racial/ethnic heritage, the num-\nber of cases of diabetic retinopathy and\nvision-threatening diabetic retinopa-\nthy will likely increase.
