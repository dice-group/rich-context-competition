Grey2,4 and Joseph Williams2\n Introduction\nProgram recipients' acceptance of and reaction to\ninformation presented in prevention curricula de-\npend, among other things, on their trust in and their\nperceived credibility of program instructors. There-\nfore, as suggested by the Elaboration Likelihood\nModel (ELM) [1, 2], the effectiveness of prevention\nprograms to some extent might depend on program\nrecipients' attitudes toward instructors. Although\nattitudes toward program instructors are crucial to\nprogram success, they have not been adequately\nexamined in the literature.\nStudies that document the types of substance\nabuse prevention programs delivered in the nation's\nschools indicate that Drug Abuse Resistance Edu-\ncation (D.A.R.E.) programs are delivered in ;80%\nof all school districts [3]. Given that police officers\ndeliver D.A.R.E. and other school-based prevention\nprograms, it is important to consider whether stu-\ndents' attitudes toward police instructors influence\nthe success of prevention programming. Moreover,\nstudents' attitudes toward police instructors of pre-\nvention programs have not been fully examined.\nStudies of the effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. deliv-\nery network have examined the effect on students'\nattitudes toward police officers in general [4\u00ad7]. A\ndominant finding from these studies is that students\nexposed to D.A.R.E. officers tend to have positive\nattitudes toward police officers in general. How-\never, these studies did not consider the factors influ-\nencing the observed attitudes or their relation to\nattitudes toward police officer instructors. Other\nlimitations of these studies are that they focus on\nspecific geographic locations and only on elemen-\ntary school students, particularly fifth and sixth\ngraders.\nAgainst the backdrop of these limitations is an\nongoing debate in prevention research on wheth-\ner police officers should deliver drug prevention\n1Department of Political Science, Augusta State University,\nPolicy, The University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325, USA,\n3Department of Sociology, The University of Akron, Akron,\nWestern Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA\n*Correspondence to: A.

This question is very important given\nthat a large body of literature exists elsewhere in-\ndicating that in general adolescents have negative\nattitudes toward police officers [8\u00ad15]. This litera-\nture suggests that the presence of police officers in\nschools is likely to pose a psychological threat to,\nand alienate, students who already have negative\nattitudes toward them [11].\nThis study addresses the limitations of and builds\non previous research by exploring adolescents' atti-\ntudes toward instructors of substance use preven-\ntion programs. Specifically, the study explores\ndifferences in students' attitudes toward police\ninstructors of drug prevention programs in six met-\nropolitan areas in the United States of America.\nThe key questions addressed in this study are as\nfollows:\n(i) What are students' attitudes toward instructors\nof drug prevention programs?\n(ii) Are students' attitudes toward program instructors\ndifferent for police and non-police instructors?\n(iii) Are there variations in students' attitudes to-\nward police instructors according to:\n(a) Their general attitudes toward the police?\n(b) Their prior exposure to the D.A.R.E. program?\n(c) Their sociodemographic characteristics?\n(d) The sociodemographic characteristics of their\nneighborhoods?\nFactors influencing adolescents'\nattitudes toward police officers\nStudies examining adolescents' attitudes toward the\npolice have indicated that individual characteristics,\nneighborhood conditions and type of encounters\nwith the police are key factors influencing such atti-\ntudes. Among the individual characteristics shaping\nadolescents' attitudes toward the police are gender,\ndeviance and race. For instance, delinquent adoles-\ncents are noted to have more negative attitudes to-\nward the police [16, 17]. Similarly, non-White\nadolescents are reported to have more negative atti-\ntudes toward the police than White adolescents [15,\n16, 18]. This general tendency to view the police\nnegatively on the part of adolescents varies not only\ndimensions of evaluation as well. For example,\nbased on semantic differentials, Moretz [22] con-\ncludes that ``students in the present study saw them\n(the police) as a valuable agency in society'' (223).\nFurthermore, Moretz argues that the police, while\nviewed as potent and valuable, are not well under-\nstood by adolescents.\nAdolescents residing in suburban neighborhoods\nand/or smaller cities are reported to have more pos-\nitive attitudes toward the police than their counter-\nhas also demonstrated the importance of individu-\nals' perceptions of conditions in their neighbor-\nhoods in shaping their attitudes toward the police.\nPeople perceiving their neighborhood conditions as\n`bad' tend to have more negative attitudes toward\nthe police than those with positive perceptions of\nThe nature of contacts between the public and the\npolice as well as public perceptions of these con-\ntacts have also been found to affect attitudes toward\nhave had prior involuntary encounters with the po-\nlice (such as being arrested or stopped for traffic\nviolations) have more negative attitudes toward\nthe police than adolescents with prior voluntary\nencounters [24]. Generally, adolescents who have\nfrequent contacts with the police in a supportive\ncontext are found to have more positive attitudes\ntoward the police [13, 17]. Negative experiences\nwith police appear prominently in the literature de-\nscribing attitudes toward the police. Hurst et al. [21]\nfind that the most powerful predictor of negative\nattitudes toward the police, for girls, is vicarious\npolice misconduct. That is, knowledge of police\nmisconduct was a more powerful predictor of neg-\native attitudes toward the police than were age,\nrace, school type or victimization experience. Fur-\nthermore, Cox and Falkenberg [20] conclude that\nnegative interactions with police by substance abus-\ning youth result in more negative attitudes toward\nthe police. In contrast to this trend, Esbensen\nand Osgood [25] in their evaluation of the Gang\nAttitudes toward instructors of prevention programs\nResistance Education and Training (GREAT) pro-\ngram find that program participants had significantly\nmore positive attitudes toward the police than did\nmembers of a comparison group, in two of the three\nsamples under investigation. It is important to note\nthat the GREAT program was developed based upon\nthe D.A.R.E. model [25]. Consequently, the positive\nclassroom interactions with police officers that ado-\nlescents experience in the GREAT program and that\nresult in their more positive attitudes toward the\npolice may operate similarly for D.A.R.E.\nMost of the studies on adolescents' attitudes to-\nward the police are limited to specific geographic\nlocations and populations, particularly Blacks or\ncomparisons between Blacks and Whites in urban\ncommunities [26]. Consequently, the question of\napplicability of the findings to other settings and\ncontexts remains unanswered. In addition, the ef-\nfect of other factors on attitudes toward the police\nhas not been compelling. For instance, while some\nstudies indicate differences in attitudes toward the\ncate no differences in attitudes toward the police by\nMethods\nThe conceptual model of this study is based on the\nargument that the effectiveness of prevention pro-\ngrams to some extent might depend on the periph-\neral route of persuasion as elucidated by the ELM\n[1, 2]. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to\nexamine attitudes toward instructors of prevention\nprograms overall, then determine whether attitudes\ntoward program instructors differ when the instruc-\ntor is a police officer or not. A key hypothesis of the\nstudy is that students' general attitudes toward po-\nlice officers will be predictive of their evaluation of\npolice officers as instructors. Specifically, it was\nexpected that students with positive attitudes to-\nward police officers would have positive attitudes\ntoward police instructors. As past research indicates\nthat students exposed to the D.A.R.E. program tend\nto have more positive attitudes toward police offi-\ncers, it was further hypothesized that prior exposure\nto the D.A.R.E. program would positively affect atti-\ntudes toward police officers in general. Considering\nthat adolescents' attitudes toward police officers may\nbe shaped by sociodemographic characteristics, it\nwas also hypothesized that subgroups of students\nwith different individual-level and neighborhood-\nlevel sociodemographic characteristics would also\nhave different attitudes toward police instructors.\nThese hypotheses are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nData\nData used for this study were drawn from the Ad-\nolescent Substance Abuse Prevention Study\n(A.S.A.P.S.). The A.S.A.P.S. has been described\nin details elsewhere [28]. In brief, it uses a random-\nized experimental design to explore the effective-\nness of an innovative adolescent substance abuse\nprevention program delivered by D.A.R.E. officers\nto students when they are in the seventh and ninth\ngrades. The A.S.A.P.S. is a 5-year, prospective,\nlongitudinal study of a cohort of seventh graders\nschools in six metropolitan areas across the United\nStates of America (Los Angeles, CA; Houston, TX;\nSt Louis, MO; Detroit, MI; Newark, NJ and New\nOrleans, LA). The selected school districts consist-\ning of 83 high schools (9th\u00ad12th grade) and all their\n122 feeder middle schools (sixth\u00adeighth grade)\nwere randomly drawn from a universe of school\ndistricts stratified by stress (defined by the propor-\ntions of district students eligible for the free lunch\nprogram and who represent minority groups) and\nthen randomly assigned to either experimental or\ncontrol conditions. Active parental consent and stu-\ndent assent procedures secured a 71% return rate.\nBaseline survey data were completed when students\nyear. Seven survey waves were planned with the\nfinal wave occurring when the students were in\nseven survey waves are seventh grade posttest,\neighth grade, ninth grade pre- and posttest,\n10th grade and 11th grade. With the primary sam-\npling unit being high schools and the middle\nschools feeding into the respective high schools,\nA. Hammond et al.\nthe movement of students from middle schools to\nhigh schools does not pose a possible confound prob-\nlem. Survey data are available for 19 200 students.\nThe program being evaluated, Take Charge of\nYour Life, incorporates current empirical evidence\non content and program characteristics shown to be\neffective in delaying the onset and reducing the\ntrajectories over time of substance use [tobacco,\nalcohol, marijuana and other illicit drugs or Alcohol,\nTobacco and other Drugs (ATOD)]. The program\nspecifically targets: normative beliefs regarding the\nperceived prevalence of substance use among teens,\nconsequences of substance use and strengthening life\nskills including decision making, communications\nand refusal skills. The curriculum is based on a model\nof prevention that suggests that challenging existing\nbeliefs through the use of objective data (e.g. survey\ndata from Monitoring the Future) lead students to\nan adjustment in their perceptions of the rates of\npeer use and in the level of acceptance of substance\nuse by those who are important to them and the real-\nlife personal, social and legal consequences of\nATOD use for adolescents. Students are then given\nopportunities to apply this new information in\nhypothetical authentic scenarios using a decision-\nmaking algorithm with the anticipated outcome be-\ning more negative attitudes toward substance use\nand consequently stronger intentions not to use to-\nbacco, alcohol, marijuana or other drugs. Finally,\nstudents learn refusal and communication skills and\npractice these skills through role-play with their in-\nstructor and peers with the goal of following\nthrough on the decision not to use these substances.\nAnalytical sample\nThe analytical sample for the current study consists\nof a subset of students (n = 6069) in both the treat-\nment and control conditions who reported on a\nFig. 1.

Responses\nto the items, which relate to students' involvement\nin behaviors such as group violence and theft in\nthe past year, ranged from `not at all' = 1 to `more\nthan five times' = 5. The factor loadings for this\nmean score of the measure was highly skewed to\nthe extent that most of the students (77.2% at\nseventh and 71.3% at ninth grades) indicated that\nthey have not been involved in deviant behaviors.\nThe skewed nature of this measure indicates the\npresence of two categories of deviant students;\ndeviant and non-deviant. Using a natural split, the\nmean score of the four items was dichotomized into\n`deviant' = 1 and `non-deviant' = 0 at the seventh\nand ninth grades (such that students with a mean\nscore of 1 were considered non-deviant and those\nwith a mean score >1 were considered deviant).\nTo reflect changes in deviant behavior over the\nperiod, the dichotomized measure at the seventh\nand ninth grades were combined to create a dummy\nvariable with non-deviant students at both the\nseventh and ninth grades as the reference group.\nWhile we lose some information by dichotomizing\nthe measure, the skewed nature of this measure\njustifies the dichotomization process [29].\nDrug use was measured based on students' self-\nreport of ever using three different drugs (cigarettes,\nalcohol and marijuana) during the 30 days prior to\nthe time of survey completion. Students who\nreported using any of the three drugs at any of the\nwaves prior to the ninth grade posttest were identi-\nfied as having prior drug use (coded 1) and those\nwho reported not using any of the drugs at any of\nthe waves prior to the ninth grade posttest were\nconsidered to have no prior drug use (coded 0).\nThe waves prior to ninth grade posttest are seventh\ngrade pre- and posttests, eighth grade follow-up and\nninth grade pretest.\nAttitudes toward police officers were measured\nusing two 5-point Likert-type scale items relating to\nthe duties of police officers at the seventh, eighth\nand ninth grades. Students' responses to each of the\nitems ranged from `disagree` = 1 to `agree` = 5.\nOne of the items was negatively worded and the\nresponse was reverse coded to ensure that higher\nscores indicate more positive attitudes. Consistent\nwith prior research [23], a composite score of atti-\ntudes toward police officers was constructed by av-\neraging each student's response to the two items.\nExposure to the D.A.R.E. program was a dichot-\nomous measure of students receiving the D.A.R.E.\nprograms prior to the seventh grade, during seventh\ngrade or during eighth grade. It was coded as `no\nexposure to the D.A.R.E. program' = 0 and `expo-\nsure to the D.A.R.E. program' = 1. Instructor type\nwas assessed by category of instructors who deliv-\nered drug education curriculum at the ninth grade\nand was coded as `non-police' = 0 and `police'\n= 1. The non-police instructors consist of teachers\nlivered diverse drug prevention programs.\nThe two neighborhood-level characteristics were\nschool location and school-level stress, where the\nstudents' schools are used to reflect neighborhood\nsociodemographic characteristics. School location\nwas assessed by whether the school district is\nlocated in the six inner cities (urban) or outside\nof the inner cities (non-urban). It was coded as\n`non-urban` = 0 and `urban` = 1. School-level\nstress was constructed by a measure of poverty\n(proportion of students in a school district qualified\nto receive free lunch) and coded `low stress' (25%\nor less students receiving free lunch) = 0 and `higher\nstress' (>25% students receiving free lunch) = 1.\nAnalyses\nFirst, to examine student attitudes toward preven-\ntion program instructors, a detailed table of the stu-\ndents responses to the four items presented in the\nsurvey was generated. Next, to determine if attitudes\ntoward the program instructor changed when the in-\nstructor was a police officer, independent t-tests were\nused. Differences in the means of each of the four\nitems and the combined mean score for all four items\nwere tested across students who had received pre-\nvention instruction from a police officer and students\nwho had instruction from non-police instructors.\nStructural equation modeling (S.E.M.) was\nthen used to test the hypothesized relationships\nA. Hammond et al.\nbetween students' attitudes toward police instruc-\ntors and the students' general attitudes toward the\npolice, prior exposure to the D.A.R.E. program,\nand students' individual level and individual-level\nand neighborhood-level sociodemographic char-\nacteristics as illustrated in Fig. 1. Since the focus\nof these analyses was students' evaluation of po-\nlice instructors, only students who had police offi-\ncers as instructors of prevention programs were\nincluded.\nTo better understand how the hypothesized\nschool-level independent variables effected stu-\ndents' attitudes toward police instructors and their\nrelationship to the individual-level independent var-\niables, two S.E.M.'s were estimated in a stepwise\nfashion, first estimating the individual- (within)\nlevel independent variable effects, then adding the\nschool- (between) level independent variables. The\nadequacy of the S.E.M.'s was evaluated using mul-\ntiple indices of fit [the chi-square difference test;\ncomparative fit index (CFI); Tucker\u00adLewis fit\nindex (TLI); root mean square error of approxima-\ntion (RMSEA) and standardized root mean square\nresidual (SRMR)] as recommended by Hu and\nPrior to evaluating the conceptual model, a con-\nfirmatory factor analysis using the four items mea-\nsuring student attitudes toward police instructors as\nobserved indicators of a single latent construct was\nconducted. The factor loadings for the four ob-\nserved indicators measuring attitudes toward police\nabove the 0.40 commonly used factor loading cut-\noff value, demonstrating adequate convergent val-\nidity of the latent construct for student attitudes\ntoward police instructors.\nAs the A.S.A.P.S. used a cluster sampling plan\n(students nested within schools), the descriptive\nand difference of means analyses were performed\nusing the survey (svy) commands in Stata 8.2 [31],\nwhich accounts for clustering and provides unbi-\nased standard errors for parameter estimates. For\nthe S.E.M.'s, clustering was handled by multilevel\nmodeling using version 4.2 of M-plus [32]. In this\napproach, a model for each level of the data, in-\ndividual (within) and school (between) is specified,\naccounting for the nested nature of the data due to\ncluster sampling.\nAs with most longitudinal studies, the data set\ncontained missing values. Apart from the fact that\none high school district dropped out of the larger\nin the original sample were lost by the ninth grade\nposttest. There was also a small amount of within-\nsurvey missingness. To address the problem of\nmissing data, a multiple imputation approach was\nused. Using the NORM program [33], the missing\nvalues in the data set were simulated multiple times,\nproducing 10 equally plausible versions of the com-\nplete data set. Each of these data sets was analyzed\nin the same way, using the statistical methods de-\ntailed above. The results were then combined using\nRubin's [34] rules for scalar estimates to produce\noverall estimates and standard errors that incorpo-\nrate missing data uncertainty.\nResults\nStudents' attitudes toward prevention\ninstructors\nTable III describes attitudes toward program instruc-\ntors held by the students in this study. As indicated\nearlier, attitudes toward instructors of prevention\nprograms were measured by four items with higher\nscores indicating more positive attitudes (see Table II).\nThe majority of the students agreed (`kind of agree'\nand `agree') that prevention program instructors un-\nderstood kid's world (63.1%), were easy to talk to\nenthusiastic (63.9%). Both the mean response for\noverall mean score (3.74) were greater than the\nmidpoint of the 5-point scale. The higher mean\nscore of responses as well as the majority of the\nstudents selecting the more favorable responses to\neach of the four items (`kind of agree' and `agree')\nsuggest that on average, the students in this study\nwere somewhat positive in their evaluation of\ninstructors of prevention programs. Next, we inves-\ntigate whether these positive evaluations hold for\nboth police and non-police instructors alike.\nAttitudes toward instructors of prevention programs\nDifferences in attitudes toward prevention\ninstructors\nTable IV presents difference of means test of atti-\ntudes toward program instructors. As reported in\nTable IV, the observed positive attitudes toward pre-\nvention program instructors were different for police\nand non-police instructors. Students who had police\nofficers as prevention instructors had a significantly\nhigher mean score for all the four items (ranging\nsizes (Cohen's d) for these differences ranged from\nthe four items was significantly higher (3.79) for\nstudents with police instructors than their counter-\nparts with non-police instructors (3.53) with an effect\nsize of 0.083. In effect, students in this study who\nhad police instructors reported significantly more\npositive attitudes toward program instructors than\nstudents who had non-police instructors.\nStudents' attitudes toward police\ninstructors\nTo explore whether attitudes toward police officer\ninstructors vary according to students' sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics, analyses were conducted\nusing two-level S.E.M. in the M-Plus program.\nAs shown in Table V, the measures of fit indices\nsuggest the individual-level model fits the data well\nand SRMR = 0.013). Though the chi-square differ-\nence test is the most commonly used fit index for\nassessing model fit, this study used indexes other\nthan the chi-square. This is because the chi-square\nis influenced by large sample sizes and considering\nthat these analyses are based on a large sample\n(n = 6069), the chi-square might not be an ideal\nmeasure of model fit. For a detailed exposition con-\ncerning assessment of model fit see Hu and Bentler\nIndividual-level analyses\nAttitudes toward the police\nThe mean level of students' attitudes toward police\nofficers from the seventh grade through to the ninth\ngrade was 3.45 out of a possible score of 5 and is\nconsidered to be positive. In effect, the students have\nsomewhat positive attitudes toward police officers in\ngeneral. Though students' attitudes toward police\nofficers declined over the period (slope = \u00c00.10),\ntheir overall attitudes remained generally positive.\nExposure to D.A.R.E. and attitudes toward\nthe police\nExposures to the D.A.R.E. program in prior years\nwere significant positive predictors of attitudes toward\npolice officers in general in subsequent years. For\ninstance, students exposed to the D.A.R.E. program\nprior to seventh grade tended to report more positive\nevaluation of police officers in general at seventh\nwho were not exposed to the D.A.R.E. program prior\nto seventh grade. Similar findings were observed for\nthe effect of exposure to the D.A.R.E. program at\nseventh and eighth grades on attitudes toward police\nofficers at eighth and ninth grades, respectively.\nTable III.

Hammond et al.\nThe intercept for attitudes toward police officers\nin general was significantly positive for attitudes\nSimilarly, the slope for attitudes toward police offi-\ncers in general was significantly positive for atti-\ntudes toward police instructors (b = 0.097,\nP < 0.001). That is, both the average level and rate\nof change of students' attitudes toward the police in\ngeneral, from the seventh grade through to the ninth\ngrade, were significant and positive predictors of\ntheir attitudes toward police instructors. In effect,\nstudents with more positive attitudes toward police\nofficers in general tended to evaluate police instruc-\ntors of prevention programs more positively. More-\nover, these positive attitudes toward police officers\nin general significantly predicted increases in posi-\ntive attitudes toward program instructors, over time.\nDrug use\nAnalysis of the individual-level model suggests that\nstudents' prior drug use has consistent effects on\ntheir attitudes toward police instructors of preven-\ntion programs. Controlling for all other factors,\nstudents who have used any of the drugs examined\n(cigarette, alcohol and marijuana) prior to the ninth\ngrade reported significantly more negative attitudes\ntoward police instructors of prevention programs.\nThat is, police instructors tended to receive negative\nevaluations among the students who have used\ncigarette, alcohol or marijuana during at least one\nwave before the ninth grade posttest. This finding is\nnot surprising considering that underage use of drugs\n(both legal and illegal) is a crime. This is probably\nbecause students who have used any of the drugs\nhave either encountered the police in a negative con-\ntext (such as being arrested) or have a greater fear of\nencountering the police in a negative context.\nDeviance\nCompared with students who reported low levels of\ndeviance at both seventh and ninth grades, students\nreporting higher levels of deviance at both grades\nreported significantly negative attitudes toward po-\nstudents involved in higher deviance at ninth grade\nonly reported significantly more negative evaluation\nof police instructors than those reporting lower levels\nat both seventh and ninth grades (b = \u00c00.321, P <\n0.001). However, there was no statistically signifi-\ncant difference in the evaluation of police instructors\nby students involved in higher deviance at seventh\ngrade only and their counterparts involved in lower\ndeviance at both seventh and ninth grades (\u00c00.043,\nns). It appears from this finding that students cur-\nrently involved in deviant behaviors may perceive\npolice officers skeptically; hence their negative atti-\ntudes toward police officer instructors.\nRace/ethnicity\nContrary to findings from previous studies [15, 16,\n18], there was no statistically significant difference\nin the evaluation of police instructors by White\nTable IV.

The findings from this study\nsuggest that students have somewhat positive eval-\nuations of instructors of prevention programs. The\nstudy also suggests that students differ in their eval-\nuation of instructors of prevention programs\naccording to instructor type. Police instructors of\nprevention programs tended to enjoy more positive\nevaluation among students than did non-police\ninstructors. This finding and evidence that adoles-\ncents have negative attitudes toward police officers\nin general [8\u00ad15] led us to believe that police offi-\ncers as instructors enjoy more positive evaluation\nfrom adolescents than in their traditional role as law\nenforcers. This is likely due to the more positive\ninteraction that takes place between the police offi-\ncer instructors and students in the classroom as op-\nposed to the likely hostile encounters with the\nTable VI.

Besides, with the view that the police are\nnot well understood by adolescents [22] and are\nthus likely to be perceived negatively by adoles-\ncents, it is possible that students who encountered\nthe police in the classroom tended to understand the\npolice better and evaluate them positively.\nThe positive attitudes toward police instructors\nheld by students were not uniform across subgroups\nof students. The negative relationships between\nattitudes toward police instructors and students'\ndrug use and involvement in deviant behaviors ap-\npear to suggest that students involved in `illegal'\nactivities hold negative evaluations of police\ninstructors, relative to their peers not involved in\n`illegal' activities. It is probably because this cate-\ngory of students fears being arrested by the police\nor has experienced negative encounters with the\npolice.\nThis study also highlights the importance of con-\ntextual factors in understanding students' attitudes\ntoward police instructors. Due possibly to positive\ninteractions between students and police officer\ninstructors, past studies have demonstrated that\nthe D.A.R.E. program has improved the image of\npolice officers among adolescents. However, these\neffects may vary in different contexts and for dif-\nferent subgroups of students. As a result, in drawing\nsuch a conclusion one has to take into consideration\nstudents' characteristics and the context within\nwhich they interact with the police.\nLimitations\nThe findings from this study must be interpreted\nwith caution due to some limitations. The effect\nof the D.A.R.E. program on attitudes toward police\nofficers is based on the assumption that students\nwho have had prior exposure to the D.A.R.E. pro-\ngram have encountered police (D.A.R.E.) officers\nin a supportive context and thus are more likely to\nevaluate police officers favorably. Though students\nmight have had several encounters with the police\nin diverse settings and conditions, the data set used\nfor this study did not include these measures, and\nstudents' encounters with the police were measured\nin the narrow context of prior exposure to D.A.R.E.\nprogram. It seems unlikely, however, that these un-\nmeasured encounters would bias students toward\nmore positive opinions of police instructors. It\nseems more plausible that these unmeasured expe-\nriences are negative and would suppress rather than\nexplain the correlations we found in this project.\nSecond, though students in this study who had\npolice instructors tended to evaluate program\ninstructors more positively than students who had\nnon-police instructors, this study does not claim\nthat the positive evaluation translates into positive\nprogram effect. That is, this study is not suggesting\nthat students who had police officers as instructors\nof prevention program had better outcomes on sub-\nstance use than their counterparts who had non-po-\nlice instructors. This issue must be addressed by\nfurther research.\nFurther, while the individual characteristics of\nthe instructor such as race and gender are likely to\nimpact students' evaluation of the instructors, this\ninformation was available for only police instruc-\ntors who delivered the Take Charge of Your Life\nprogram and could not be included in the analyses.\nIt is suggested that future studies gather information\non individual characteristics of instructors and con-\nsider the possible effect of these characteristics on\nstudents' evaluation of the instructors.\nImplications\nNotwithstanding these limitations, the findings\nhave provided insight into the developmental and\nsequential nature of attitudes toward police officers\nand instructors. The study has also provided find-\nings with important implications for prevention\nprogramming, policy makers and agencies con-\ncerned with improving the public image of the po-\nlice and police functions.\nGiven the possibility that program outcomes are\nrelated to attitudes toward program instructors [1,\n2], the more positive evaluation of police instruc-\ntors by students in this study suggests that programs\ndelivered by police officers are more likely to have\na positive impact. Consequently, we suggest that\npolice officers may be appropriate deliverers of\nA. Hammond et al.\nprevention programs for the majority of adoles-\ncents. The use of police officers as instructors of\nprevention programs has the potential of not only\nhelping improve the effectiveness of prevention\nprograms but would also help create and sustain\na more positive image of the police or at least abate\nthe negative image held by adolescents.\nThe positive image of the police developed\namong students may create a situation where the\nstudents could relate cordially to the police, report\ncrime voluntarily and cooperate in curbing crime in\nschools. With schools being a microcosm of the\nwider community, it is expected that the cordial\nrelationship developed between the police and stu-\ndents in schools would be transferred to the com-\nmunity. This might engender more positive\ncommunity engagement and meaningful police\u00ad\ncommunity partnerships toward effective and effi-\ncient policing.\nThis is particularly important considering that\ncommunity policing has become a dominant ap-\nproach to policing in the United States of America\nin recent years. With effective community policing\ncentering on meaningful police\u00adpublic cooperation\nand the observation that adolescents form a dispro-\nportionately large segment of the population the\npolice encounter in their duties [16], the successful\nmaintenance of law and order, especially commu-\nnity policing will require, among others, promoting\ntrust and positive image of the police among ado-\nlescents. Against this backdrop and the findings\nfrom the study, it will not be out of place to argue\nfor a mechanism such as the D.A.R.E. delivery\nsystem that creates an opportunity for adolescents\nto encounter the police in a more friendly and sup-\nportive context.\nHowever, the differential evaluation of police\ninstructors among students indicates that the effec-\ntiveness of prevention programs delivered by\npolice instructors might not be equal for all stu-\ndents. For instance, prevention programs delivered\nby police instructors might be more effective for\nstudents not involved in `illegal' activities than for\nstudents involved in some form of `illegal' activ-\nity. In fact any prevention program may not\nhave credibility for this group of students who\nmay warrant other, more intensive interventions.\nWhile these characteristics pertain to a smaller\nproportion of adolescents, it is proposed that deci-\nsions concerning the use of police officers as\ninstructors of prevention programs must take into\nconsideration students' unique characteristics and\nsocial context.\nFuture research\nThe factors influencing students' attitudes toward\ninstructors of prevention programs are complex. A\ncomplete understanding of students' attitudes to-\nward police instructors, therefore, would require\nfurther studies. First, it is suggested that this study\nbe replicated in other contexts with efforts made in\naddressing the limitations highlighted above. Par-\nticularly, researchers replicating this study should\nmeasure students' contacts with the police both\nwithin and outside the school as well as the nature,\nfrequency and intensity of such contacts.\nResearchers designing future studies should also\ninclude a diverse array of instructors of school-\nbased substance abuse prevention programs includ-\ning, but not limited to, police officers, peer groups,\nteachers and counselors. They should also consider\na broader age range of students and consider the\ndevelopmental changes in attitudes overtime.\nIt is possible that adolescents' attitudes toward\npolice instructors might differ across geographic\nareas. To address these possible differences, it is\nsuggested that future research considers regional\nanalysis of students' attitudes toward police instruc-\ntors. Researchers designing such study should de-\ntermine whether students' attitudes toward police\ninstructors differ across cities/areas and the possible\ncause for any observed difference. The importance\nof such study is illuminated by the view from this\nstudy that context matters in understanding atti-\ntudes toward police instructors.\nFunding\nAttitudes toward instructors of prevention programs\n"
