DMF modifies glutathione (GSH) levels that\ncan induce expression of the anti-inflammatory protein HO-1\n(haem oxygenase-1). In primary astrocytes and C6 glioma\ncells, BG-12 dose-dependently suppressed nitrite production\ninduced by either LI [LPS (lipopolysaccharide) at 1 mg/ml plus\nIFNc (interferon c) at 20 units/ml] or a mixture of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines, with greater efficacy in C6 cells.\nBG-12 reduced NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2) mRNA levels\nand activation of a NOS2 promoter, reduced nuclear levels of\nNF-kB (nuclear factor kB) p65 subunit and attenuated loss\nof IkBa (inhibitory kBa) in both cell types, although with\ngreater effects in astrocytes. In astrocytes, LI decreased mRNA\nlevels for GSHr (GSH reductase) and GCL (c-glutamylcysteine\nsynthetase), and slightly suppressed GSHs (GSH synthetase)\nmRNAs. Co-treatment with BG-12 prevented those decreased\nand increased levels above control values. In contrast, LI\nreduced GSHp (GSH peroxidase) and GCL in C6 cells, and BG-\n12 had no effect on those levels. BG-12 increased nuclear\nlevels of Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related\nfactor 2), an inducer of GSH-related enzymes, in astrocytes\nbut not C6 cells. In astrocytes, GSH was decreased by BG-12 at\n2 h and increased at 24 h. Prior depletion of GSH using\nbuthionine-sulfoximine increased the ability of BG-12 to\nreduce nitrites. In astrocytes, BG-12 increased HO-1 mRNA\nlevels and effects on nitrite levels were blocked by an HO-1\ninhibitor. These results demonstrate that BG-12 suppresses\ninflammatory activation in astrocytes and C6 glioma cells, but\nwith distinct mechanisms, different dependence on GSH and\ndifferent effects on transcription factor activation.\n",

FAEs were first considered for use as treatment\nfor psoriasis, a Th1-mediated disease, due to anti-proliferative\neffects on lymphocytes (Stoof et al., 2001; Mrowietz and\nAsadullah, 2005). One FAE (Fumaderm) has been approved for\npsoriasis in Europe for over 15 years. Subsequent studies showed\nthat DMF reduces inflammatory gene expression, including that\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and increases\nanti-inflammatory expression (Stoof et al., 2001; Loewe et al.,\npsoriasis efficacy. These findings have led to increased interest for\nusing DMF in other auto-immune or inflammatory diseases,\nincluding MS (multiple sclerosis) (Kappos et al., 2008;\nreduced glial inflammation during MOG-peptide-induced EAE\n(experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) and increased\nPhase 2B trial of BG-12 in RRMS (relapsing remitting MS)\npatients showed significant decreases in new gadolinium\nenhancing lesions, T1 and T2 lesions, and a non-significant\ndecrease in the annualized relapse rate (Kappos et al., 2008).\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email dlfeins@uic.edu).\nAbbreviations: BSO, buthionine-sulfoximine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMF, dimethyl fumarate; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis;\nEMSA, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay; FAE, fumaric acid ester; FCS, fetal calf serum; GSHp, GSH peroxidase; GSHr, GSH reductase; GSHs, GSH synthetase; HO-1, haem\noxygenase-1; HSP32, heat-shock protein 32; IFNc, interferon c; IkBa, inhibitory kBa; IL, interleukin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LI, LPS at 1 mg/ml\nplus IFNc at 20 units/ml; MS, multiple sclerosisi; NF-kB, nuclear factor kB; Nrf2, nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2; NOS2, nitric oxide synthase 2; qPCR,\nquantitative PCR; TNFa, tumour necrosis factor a; ZnPP, zinc protoporphyrin IX.\nE 2011 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nThe mechanisms of the action of BG-12 are not fully known.\nBG-12 can suppress NF-kB (nuclear factor kB)-dependent\naccounting for some of its anti-inflammatory effects. BG-12 can\nalso activate the Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-\nrelated factor 2) pathway (Lukashev et al., 2007; Kappos et al.,\n2008), which induces the transcription of various genes,\nincluding anti-oxidative ones, reduces oxidative neuronal death\nand helps maintain myelin integrity. BG-12 induces detoxifica-\ntion enzymes in astrocytes and microglial cells (Wierinckx et al.,\n2005). As a consequence, BG-12 can modulate GSH levels in cells\nleading to cytotoxic or protective effects (Dethlefsen et al.,\n(Schmidt and Dringen, 2010). The anti-inflammatory effects of\nDMF have been shown, in some cases, to involve induction of\nHO-1 (haem oxygenase 1) also termed HSP32 (heat-shock\nprotein 32) (Lehmann et al., 2007), which occurs following GSH\ndepletion. HO-1 can suppress a variety of inflammatory\nresponses (Horikawa et al., 2002), including those in astrocytes\nprotection against oxidative stress (Min et al., 2006).\nA role for astrocyte activation during the pathogenesis of\nMS and EAE has been implicated in several studies (Smith and\nLassmann, 2002). Inflammatory activation of astrocytes can\nlead to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well\nas of the inducible form of NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2)\nwhose overproduction of NO contributes to oligodendrocyte\nand neuronal damage. In vitro, astrocytes express NOS2 in\nresponse to a variety of stimuli, and in MS the predominant\nglial localization of NOS2 has been reported to be in astrocytes\nlocalization of NOS2 has also been reported in EAE (Brenner\nof MS (Oleszak et al., 1997). The effects of BG-12 in astrocytes\nhave not been well characterized. A recent study shows anti-\ninflammatory actions in microglial cells, but weaker effects in\nprimary astrocytes (Wilms et al., 2010). In the present study, we\nhave re-examined the ability of BG-12 to reduce NOS2\nexpression in primary astrocytes and compared those findings\nwith results using rat C6 glioma cells, often used to model\nastrocyte biology (Feinstein et al., 1994). A comparison of the\nanti-inflammatory actions of BG-12 in astrocytes versus C6\ncells, combined with measurements of effects on intracellular\nGSH levels, has allowed us to establish a linkage between these\ntwo phenomena, and suggests that changes in GSH modulate\nthe suppressive efficacy of BG-12.\nReagents\nCell culture reagents [DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's\nmedium) and antibiotics] were from Cellgro Mediatech\n(Manassas, VA, U.S.A.). FCS (fetal calf serum) (,10 units\nendotoxin/ml) was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.).\nBacterial endotoxin LPS (Salmonella Typhimurium), BSO\n(buthionine-sulfoximine), ZnPP (zinc protoporphyrin IX),\ngentamicin (G418), antibiotics, and other common reagents\nwere from Sigma\u00adAldrich (St Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Recombinant\nrat IFNc (interferon c), human IL-1b, and humanTNFa\n(tumour necrosis factor a) were from Gibco (Gaithersburg,\nMD, U.S.A.). BG-12 was provided by Biogen Idec (Cambridge,\nMA, U.S.A.). Antibodies against NF-kB p65 subunit and IkBa\n(inhibitory kBa) were from Santa Cruz Laboratories (Santa\nCruz, CA, U.S.A.), and those against b-actin were from Sigma.\nCells and treatments\nPrimary enriched astrocyte cultures were obtained from\ncerebral cortices of postnatal day 1\u00ad2 Harlan Sprague\u00ad\nDawley rats as described previously (Galea et al., 1992). All\nexperiments using animals were carried out according to\ninstitutional guidelines and were approved by the local\nInstitutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Media were\nchanged every 3 days. After 2 weeks of growth in DMEM\ncontaining 10% FCS and antibiotics (100 i.u./ml penicillin and\nastrocytes and 2\u00ad3% microglia. C6 rat glioma cells were\ngrown in DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. C6 cells\nstably transfected with a 2.2 kb fragment of the rat NOS2\npromoter (Gavrilyuk et al., 2001) driving expression of\nluciferase were passaged in complete medium containing\ntransferred to DMEM with 1% FCS and antibiotics and\ntreated with LI (LPS at 1 mg/ml plus IFNc at 20 units/ml) or TII\ninduction of NOS2. NOS2 activity was assessed indirectly by\nnitrite production in the cell culture media (Green et al.\n1982). Briefly, an aliquot of cell culture media (80 ml) was\nmixed with 40 ml of Griess reagent and the absorbance was\nmeasured at 550 nm. Cell viability was assessed by the release\nof LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) into the culture media using\nthe Cell-tox 96 kit (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.).\nmRNA analysis\nTotal cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from cells using TRIzolH\nreagent (Invitrogen); aliquots were converted into cDNA using\nrandom hexamer primers. Quantitative changes in mRNA levels\nwere estimated by real-time PCR [qPCR (quantitative PCR)] using\nthe following cycling conditions: 35 cycles of denaturation at\nspecific set of primers and extension at 72\u00b0C for 20 s. Reactions\nwere carried out in the presence of SYBR Green (1:10000 dilution\nof stock solution from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, U.S.A.),\ncarried out in a 20-ml reaction volume in a Corbett Rotor-Gene\napparatus (Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia).

An equal volume of\nluciferase substrate (Steady Glo reagent, Promega) was added\nto all samples, and the luminescence measured in a microplate\nluminometer (Rosys-Anthos, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland).\nGlutathione assay\nTotal GSH levels (GSH+GSSG) were measured in whole cell\nlysates using a commercial glutathione assay kit (Sigma\nCS0260). In brief, following treatments, cells were collected,\npelleted, lysed, deproteinized, and aliquots of the resulting\nsupernatant mixed with 5,59-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)\nand the formation of coloured 59-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid mea-\nImmunoblot analysis\nAfter treatments, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1 mM EDTA,\nand 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors.\nProtein content was determined by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA, U.S.A.) with BSA as standard. A 10 mg aliquot of\nprotein was mixed with Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled for 5\nmin and separated through 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels.\nSeparated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes by\nsemi-dry electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blocked\nwith 10% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder in TBST (10\nroom temperature, then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-\nIkBa (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.) or\nmouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody (Sigma) both at\n1:1000 dilutions overnight with gentle shaking at 4\u00b0C. Primary\nantibodies were removed, membranes washed three times in\nTBST, then incubated 1 h at room temperature with specific\nsecondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,\nU.S.A.). Following three washes in TBST, bands were visualized\nby incubation in ECLH (enhanced chemiluminescence) reagents\nand exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare, New York, NY,\nU.S.A.). The same membranes were washed three times in TBST,\nblocked with 10% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder in\nTBST for 1 h at room temperature and used for b-actin\nimmunoblot. Band intensities were determined using ImageJ\nsoftware (National Institutes of Health) from autoradiographs\nobtained from the minimum exposure time that allowed band\ndetection, and background intensities (determined from an\nequal-sized area of the film immediately above the band of\ninterest) were subtracted.\nImmunocytochemical staining\nAstrocytes and C6 cells were plated directly on to poly-lysine-\ncoated glass coverslips and grown until near confluency. The\ncells were then treated with LI and 20 mM BG-12 or vehicle for\nthe indicated lengths of time. After treatment, medium was\nremoved, and cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at\nroom temperature. The cells were then washed three times with\nPBS, blocked in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS containing\n(goat anti-NF-kB p65 subunit, 1:100 dilution) and the mixture\nincubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The primary antibody was removed,\ncells washed three times with PBS, then appropriate fluor-\nescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat\n1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,\nPA, U.S.A.) were added; they were incubated for 45 min at 37\u00b0C,\nwashed, and then Vectashield mounting solution was added\n(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.). The coverslips\nwere mounted on to glass slides and imaged.\nTranscription factor DNA-binding activity assay\nNuclear levels of active DNA-binding NF-kB p65 subunit and\nNrf2 were measured using ELISA-based TransAM kits (Active\nMotif, Carslbad, CA, U.S.A.). In brief, the cells were incubated\nwith LI and 20 mM BG-12 or vehicle, and, at indicated times,\nnuclear extracts were prepared, aliquots (2\u00ad10 mg) added to\nwells containing consensus NF-kB or Nrf2-binding-site element\noligonucleotides, incubated 2 h at room temperature, washed\nand then HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated antibodies\nagainst p65 or Nrf2 added for 1 h, washed, substrate added and\ncolour intensity (for Nrf2) or chemiluminescence signal (for\np65) measured.

In both primary astrocytes\nand rat C6 glioma cells (Figure 1), BG-12 dose-dependently\nreduced the LPS and IFNc (LI)-dependent production of\nnitrites. In astrocytes, a slight (,20%) but significant\ninhibition was observed at 3 mM, with maximal inhibition\nof near 50% at 20 mM the highest dose tested. In contrast, in\nC6 cells, 3 mM BG-12 reduced nitrite production approx. 50%,\nwith over 90% inhibition observed at a dose of 20 mM. In all\nincrease LDH release from either astrocytes or C6 cells. BG-12\nwas also more effective at blocking nitrite production in C6\ncells than in astrocytes when activation was carried out with\na combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 2).\nIn both astrocytes and C6 cells, BG-12 significantly reduced\nNOS2 mRNA levels (Figures 3A and 3B), suggesting an effect at\ntranscriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Consistent with\nthis, treatment with BG-12 potently suppressed the LI-\ndependent activation of a 2.2 kb NOS2 promoter stably\nexpressed in C6 cells (Figure 3C), with significant inhibition\nobserved at 3 mM, and complete suppression at 20 mM,\nsuggesting a reduction in NOS2 gene transcription.\nFigure 1 BG-12 reduces nitrite production\n(A) Primary rat astrocytes were treated with LI to induce NOS2 expression, in\nthe presence of the indicated concentration of BG-12 or vehicle (20 mM\nDMSO).

In astrocytes, LI\ninduced the appearance of nuclear p65 DNA-binding activity\nby 30 min, which returned to baseline by 4 h; in C6 cells\nnuclear activity was still high at 2 h, the longest time point\nmeasured. At all time points nuclear p65 activity was\nsignificantly reduced by BG-12. Immunostaining (Figure 4B)\nshowed that, after 1 h incubation with LI, BG-12 almost\ncompletely reduced nuclear levels of the NF-kB p65 subunit in\nastrocytes. In contrast, in C6 cells nuclear p65 could still be\ndetected in many cells, suggesting that the nuclear p65 was\nunable to bind DNA. Western-blot analysis of whole cell lysates\nshowed that, in astrocytes, BG-12 significantly reduced the\nrapid LI-dependent loss of IkBa (Figures 5A and 5C). In\ncontrast, in C6 cells the loss of IkBa measured after 30 min was\nonly slightly reduced by BG-12, while after 60 min levels were\nlower in the BG-12 treated cells. Together, these results\nsuggest that the effects of BG-12 on NOS2 are due, at least in\npart, to the inhibition of NOS2 gene expression, and that\nsuppression of IkBa degradation and NF-kB activation\ncontributes to that reduction, although differences exist\nbetween its actions in astrocytes and C6 cells.\nBG-12 differentially modulates GSH levels in\nastrocytes versus C6 cells\nDMF can increase GSH levels which in turn can influence\ninflammatory responses; we therefore tested if\n(A) Primary astrocytes and (B) C6 cells were treated with LPS/IFNc for 6 h alone, or in the presence of 10 mM BG-12 or equivalent\namount of DMSO (Veh), then RNA samples were measured by qPCR for NOS2 mRNA levels.

Quantitative PCR showed that,\nin astrocytes, after 6 h incubation, levels of GSHr and GCL\nmRNAs were significantly reduced by LI, while the levels of\nGSHs were reduced but that decrease did not reach statistical\nsignificance. Treatment with BG-12, but not vehicle,\nprevented the decrease of both GCL and GSHr mRNAs, and\nsignificantly increased levels of GSHs compared with\nincubation with LI alone. The effect of BG-12 on the GSHr\nwas significantly different compared with vehicle, and almost\n(P50.063) significant for GSHr. In contrast with astrocytes,\nwhile treatment of C6 cells with LI significantly reduced levels\nof GSHp and GCL, BG-12 did not modify expression of any of\nthe mRNAs tested compared with LI alone or to vehicle.\nSince expression of some GSH related mRNAs can be\ninduced by transcription factor Nrf2, we tested effects of BG-\n12 on the activation of this factor (Figure 7). In astrocytes,\nbut not in C6 cells, BG-12 significantly increased nuclear Nrf2\nDNA-binding activity compared with vehicle-treated cells\n(Figure 7A), with significant pairwise differences present at 1\nand 4 h, the longest time tested.\nConsistent with increased GSHr and GCL mRNA levels,\nmeasurements of total intracellular GSH (GSH plus GSSG)\ncontent showed that BG-12 significantly increased GSH levels\nin primary astrocytes (Figure 8A) but not C6 cells (Figure 8B).\nIn astrocytes, the increase was both time- and dose-\ndependent, since, at the lower dose of 3 mM, an increase was\nnot observed at 2 h, but only after 24 h. In contrast, at the\nhigher dose of 20 mM, we observed a significant reduction in\nGSH after 2 h incubation, but a significant increase after 24 h.\nReduction of GSH levels increases NOS2\nsuppression by BG-12\nTo determine if changes in GSH levels played a role in NOS2\nsuppression, we examined the effects of BG-12 on NOS2 ex-\npression in cells pretreated with BSO to deplete GSH levels\n(Figure 9). In both astrocytes and C6 cells, pretreatment with\nBSO had a small but non-significant effect on the ability of\n3 mM BG-12 to reduce nitrite production. However, the\nsuppression by 10 mM BG-12 was significantly increased by\nBSO in both C6 cells and primary astrocytes. At 20 mM BG-12,\nthe highest dose tested, there was potent inhibition (close to\n90%) of C6 cell nitrites that was not significantly increased by\nBSO; in contrast, the suppression observed in the astrocytes\n(approx. 70% inhibition compared with DMSO control) was\nsignificantly increased by BSO to near the levels achieved in C6\ncells. These results suggest that GSH normally restricts the\nability of BG-12 to reduce NOS2 expression in glial cells.\nBG-12 effects in astrocytes involve induction of\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of GSH depletion have been\nshown to involve induction of HO-1 [also called HSP32\nFigure 5 Effects of BG-12 on IkBa levels\n(A) Astrocytes and (B) C6 cells were treated with LPS/IFNc in the presence of 20 mM BG-12 (`BG') or vehicle (`Veh'), and after\nindicated times whole cell lysates prepared and used for Western-blot analysis of IkBa protein.

In primary astrocytes,\nmRNA levels of HO-1 were low, and slightly decreased\n(,50%) by incubation with LI, whereas co-incubation with\n10 mM BG-12 increased steady state mRNA levels over\n15-fold (Figure 10A). HO-1 mRNA levels were approximately\nthree times higher in untreated C6 cells compared with\nuntreated astrocytes; however, those levels were not altered\neither by incubation with LI or by BG-12 (Figure 10B).\nConsistent with this, co-incubation with ZnPP, a selective\ninhibitor of HO-1, significantly attenuated the suppressive\neffects of BG-12 in astrocytes, but not in C6 cells (Figure 11).\nThese results suggest that, despite having similar effects on\nGSH levels, the anti-inflammatory actions of BG-12 are\nmediated by different mechanisms in primary astrocytes\ncompared with transformed C6 cells.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we examined the effects of BG-12,\ncurrently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of MS,\non a robust inflammatory activation of glial cells. During\ndisease progression in MS, activation of parenchymal glial\ncells, both microglia as well as astroglia, results in sustained\nproduction of pro-inflammatory substances which contribute\nto neuronal and oligodendrocyte damage. Although BG-12\nwas introduced as a potential therapy for MS by virtue of its\nability to reduce activation of lymphocytes (Gerdes et al.,\npossible effects on brain glial cell activation have not been\nwell characterized. Our results confirm and expand on a\nrecent study that 10 mM DMF reduced cytokine (IL-1b, IL-6\nand TNFa) mRNA levels in primary rat astrocytes, although\nlevels of NOS2 mRNA were not significantly reduced (Wilms\net al., 2010). Interestingly, those authors found that DMF\nmore potently (e.g. greater reductions) suppressed microglial\ncompared with astroglial cytokine expression. Although GSH\nlevels were not measured in that study, our present findings\nsuggest that the effects of DMF on GSH in microglia may be\nsimilar to what is observed in C6 cells.\nFigure 6 Effects of BG-12 on GSHs, GSHp, GSHr and GCL mRNA levels\nPrimary astrocytes (A) or C6 glioma cells (B) were treated with nothing\n(control), LPS/IFNc or LPS/IFNc in the presence of 10 mM BG-12 or equivalent\namount of DMSO vehicle.

Nitrite accumula-\ntion after 24 h was modestly reduced by lower doses (3 and\n10 mM) of BG-12, and significantly reduced in the presence of\n20 mM drug. BG-12 more potently suppressed NOS2 activity\nin C6 cells, since incubation with 3 mM BG-12 reduced nitrite\ncompletely abolished nitrite. Despite these differences, BG-\n12 had a similar effect on steady-state NOS2 mRNA levels in\nboth cell types when measured after 5 h. This suggests that\nin both these cells, BG-12 is effective at reducing NOS2\ntranscription at early times, but that compensatory changes\nmay occur at later times in astrocytes, but not C6 cells that\nallow for further or increased NOS2 expression or activity.\nWe observed that BG-12 potently prevented activation of\nthe NOS2 promoter, suggesting an effect occurring at the\nlevel of NOS2 gene transcription. Since optimal NOS2\nexpression depends upon NF-kB activation, we examined\nthe effects of BG-12 on this transcription factor. In both\nastrocytes and C6 cells, BG-12 potently reduced the nuclear\nlevels of NF-kB p65 able to bind to DNA, determined using an\nEMSA-based kit. In astrocytes, immunostaining showed a\nlarge reduction in the presence of nuclear p65, while\nimmunoblot analysis showed that BG-12 prevented the loss\nof the IkBa inhibitory subunit. Together these findings are\nconsistent with the idea that, in astrocytes, BG-12 inhibits\nIkBa degradation, reduces NF-kB nuclear transport, and\nthereby reduces NOS2 gene expression. On the other hand, in\nC6 cells similar immunostaining revealed nuclear p65 in some\ncells and only modest effects on the loss of IkBa, despite the\nfact that EMSAs did not detect any NF-kB p65 DNA-binding\nactivity at that time point. These findings suggest that\nwhereas BG-12 does not prevent IkBa loss or NF-kB p65\nnuclear translocation, the nuclear p65 is less able to bind to\ncognate DNA. DMF can covalently modify proteins owing to\nthe presence of an a/b unsaturated carbonyl group (Frycak et\nFigure 8 Effects of BG-12 on GSH levels\n(A) Primary astrocytes were treated with LPS/IFNc together with BG-12 or vehicle at the indicated doses and for either 2 or 24 h, after\nwhich intracellular total GSH levels were measured.

In C6 cells, the low levels of NF-kB\np65 activity could therefore be due to modification of this\nsubunit by BG-12. BG-12 could also have important effects\non nuclear levels or DNA-binding activity of other NF-kB\nsubunits such as c-Rel, p50 or p52, which are differentially\nregulated by DMF in other cell types (Vandermeeren et al.,\nrelative levels could influence overall NOS2 gene expression.\nMeasurements of mRNA levels for enzymes involved in\nGSH synthesis show that BG-12 induced several of these\n(GSHs, GSHr and GCL) in astrocytes, but was without effect in\nC6 cells. BG-12 also increased GSH levels in astrocytes, but\nnot in C6 cells, when measured after 24 h. These results point\nto differences in the ability of BG-12 to induce an anti-\noxidant response in these cells, and measurement of nuclear\nlevels of transcription factor Nrf2, a potent inducer of anti-\noxidant genes, confirmed that BG-12 only activated this\nfactor in astrocytes. Nrf2 is kept in the cytoplasm by\nassociation with the Keap1 protein, which normally promotes\nNrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. In response to various\nstresses (Giudice et al., 2010), Keap1 thiol groups are modified\nwhich prevents Nrf2 degradation, and allows Nrf2 to\ntranslocate into the nucleus where it can activate transcrip-\ntion of several anti-oxidant genes, including that encoding\nGCL. It was reported that DMF treatment led to the activation\nof Nrf2 in the CNS (central nervous system; Lukashev et al.,\nbeneficial effects of BG-12 seen in MS. Our findings suggest\nthat the induction of Nrf2 in astrocytes increases their\nproduction of GSH which can have cytoprotective effects for\nglial cells as well as for neighbouring neurons. The reason for\nlack of effect of BG-12 on Nrf2 activation in C6 cells is not\nclear. It was suggested that, similar to modification of NF-kB\np65, a direct reaction between DMF and Keap1 thiol groups\ncould occur, leading to Nrf2 stabilization (Lukashev et al.,\n2007). If so, than interactions of BG-12 with other targets in\nC6 cells could limit its ability to interact with Keap1.\nOur findings indicate that BG-12 more potently inhibits\nNOS2 in C6 cells than in astrocytes, the cells in which GSH\nlevels are also increased. Several studies have reported that\nGSH forms a stable complex with DMF thus reducing both their\nthen higher GSH levels might be expected to reduce the ability\nof BG-12 to suppress NOS2 expression. To test this possibility,\nwe made use of BSO to selectively deplete GSH levels. We used\n(Schmidt et al., 2007). Under these conditions, we found that\nBG-12 more potently reduced nitrite production in both cell\ntypes, and that 20 mM now reduced astrocyte nitrite pro-\nduction to an extent comparable with that in C6 cells.\nIn the present study a comparison of the effects of BG-12\nin astrocytes to its effects in C6 glioma cells has identified\ninteractions between the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant\neffects of this drug. While NF-kB activation was significantly\nreduced in both cell types, the basis for that inactivation was\ndifferent, since p65 nuclear levels were strongly attenuated in\nastrocytes, but less so in C6 cells. Findings that BG-12\nactivated Nrf2 in astrocytes, but not in C6 cells, help explain\nresults that GSH enzymes are induced and GSH levels only\nincreased in astrocytes. Although the basis for differences\nbetween astrocytes and C6 cells is not clear, the increased\nmetabolic demands of transformed cells likely plays a role.\nFinally, since increased GSH levels can reduce the effective\nconcentrations of BG-12 able to react with its protein targets\n(e.g. p65 and Keap1), our findings suggest a complex\nrelationship in which compensatory responses to BG-12,\ndesigned to maintain an anti-oxidative state, may limit its\nanti-inflammatory properties.\n"
