This article adds to this line of inquiry by examining gender differentials in the odds of having cognitive impairment\nat baseline and during follow-up among the Chinese oldest old, as well as the potential pathways linking gender and the\nlikelihood of having cognitive impairment.\nMethods. Using two waves (1998 and 2000) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, the researcher\nestimated logistic and multinomial regression models of cognitive impairment for a nationwide sample of people aged\nResults. Among the Chinese oldest old, women were at higher risk than men for having cognitive impairment both at\nbaseline and during 2-year follow-up, controlling for age, activities of daily living disability, and rural residence.\nWomen's disadvantages in socioeconomic status, social network, and participation in leisure activities partially accounted\nfor the gender differentials in cognitive impairment.\nDiscussion. The findings suggest that oldest old Chinese women are a vulnerable group at higher risk for cognitive\nimpairment than oldest old men. Closing gender disparities in formal education will significantly reduce the gender gap in\ncognitive impairment in old age.\nPOPULATION aging historically has been characterized as\na social problem faced by developed countries. Today, it is\nquickly becoming a major social issue in many developing\ncountries (Hayward & Zhang, 2001). For example, China, the\nmost populous developing country in the world, is aging at an\nunprecedented speed and in an extraordinary scale due to the\nrigorous family planning program in place during the past several\ndecades, a significant increase in life expectancy, and a\nlargest number of the oldest old (i.e., people aged 80 and\nolder) in the world, and researchers predict that the\nnumber will climb from 13 million to more than 100 million by\noldest old foretells a significant future burden of cognitive and\nfunctional disability in China and calls for more research into\nthe factors associated with health disadvantages in old age.\nGender is one factor that warrants a closer look in cultural\nsettings such as China where significant differences in gender\nroles, opportunities, and obligations have conditioned the\nexperiences of men and women throughout the life course.\nLike most women in developing countries, Chinese women\nhave historically lived in a patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal\nsociety in which they were structurally and systematically de-\nnied education in early life, mental stimulation through high-\nskilled occupations during adult life, and a large social\nnetwork--all of which are associated with cognitive develop-\nment and maintenance (National Research Council, 2000).\nThus theoretically older Chinese women may face higher risk\nof cognitive impairment than older men due to their lifetime of\nsocial and economic disadvantage.\nA growing body of research on cognitive impairment and\ndementia in China confirms that Chinese women are signifi-\ncantly disadvantaged in cognitive functioning in old age (Gu &\nseminal studies of cognitive impairment in China, Yu and\ncolleagues found large gender disparities in the prevalence of\nboth severe and mild cognitive impairment among those aged\n65 and older in the city of Shanghai. However, no studies have\nyet explored empirically the socioeconomic and cultural factors\nthat could account for the significant gender differences in\ncognitive impairment in China.\nThis study intends to fill this gap by addressing two questions:\n(a) Are there gender differentials in cognitive impairment among\nthe Chinese oldest old? and (b) Do socioeconomic status (SES),\nsocial network, leisure activities, and differential survival explain\nthe gender gap in cognitive impairment? This article expands\nupon the literature in several ways. First, previous studies in\ncognitive impairment have seldom used nationwide samples.\nMost studies were conducted in large cities such as Shanghai and\nBeijing, despite the fact that 75% of the Chinese population lives\nin rural areas (Liang et al., 2000). The current study used\na recently released data set whose survey areas covered 85% of\nthe total population in China. Second, the present study uses\nlongitudinal data to examine gender differences in the onset of\ncognitive impairment. The majority of previous research has only\nlooked at gender differentials in the prevalence of cognitive\nimpairment. Although prevalence is an important indicator of\nthe burden of cognitive impairment in the older population, it\ncan be influenced by incidence rates as well as the survival rates\nof those with cognitive impairment. Therefore, it is not easy to\ninterpret these results. Third, no previous study has examined in\ndepth the reasons behind the significant gender differences in\ncognitive impairment; most studies are largely limited to simple\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nGender Differences in Cognitive Impairment in China\nSeveral studies report unusually large gender differences in\ncognitive impairment in China. In one study in Shanghai (Yu\net al., 1989), the prevalence rate of severe cognitive impairment\namong women was 3.75 times as high as that among men. Zeng\nand Vaupel (2002) reported that the gender gap in cognitive\nfunctioning among the oldest old was extremely large. Whereas\nmany as 37% of women in the same age group suffered from\npoor cognitive functioning. Elderly women also had signifi-\ncantly higher prevalence and incidence rates of dementia than\na 3-year follow-up study of a cohort of Chinese elders aged\n70 and older in Hong Kong, women had a 2.5-fold increased\nrisk of having cognitive impairment compared with men (Ho,\nWoo, Sham, Chan, & Yu, 2001). In comparison, research in\ndeveloped countries has found no gender differences in the\nincidence of cognitive decline and dementia (Chodosh, Reuben,\nAlbert, & Seeman, 2002; Ruitenberg, Ott, van Swieten,\nHofman, & Breteler, 2001) but higher prevalence rates of\ncognitive impairment and dementia among women than among\nmen (Heeren, Lagaay, Hijmans, & Rooymans, 1991; Weissman\nReasons for Gender Differences in Cognitive Impairment\nin China\nThe recent rise of feminist gerontology as well as current\nknowledge about the risk factors of cognitive impairment and\ndementia can lend some insight into the gender differences in\ncognitive impairment in China. Feminist gerontology argues\nthat gender relations are ``constructed power relations embed-\nded in social processes and institutionalized in social arenas\nwith important consequences for life chances'' (Calasanti,\ntheir childhood and adulthood in a patriarchal society, these\npower relations privileged men and disadvantaged women with\nregard to nutrition intake (e.g., sons were often favored and\ngiven better food in the family, according to Watson [1991]),\neducational and occupational opportunities, the formation of\nlarge and diversified social networks, and participation in\nleisure activities. All of the gender inequalities experienced\nover the life course may put oldest old Chinese women at\nhigher risk for cognitive impairment compared with oldest old\nmen. This article examines four mechanisms potentially linking\ngender and cognitive impairment in China. The first three focus\non Chinese women's disadvantages in SES, social network, and\nleisure activities, which previous researchers have identified\nas important predictors of cognitive impairment in old age\n(Bassuk, Glass, & Berkman, 1999; National Research Council,\nmechanism is differential survival rates (Perls, Morris, Ooi, &\nSES. --According to the brain reserve capacity theory, ``lack\nof early education could lower brain reserve and allow for\nclinical symptoms of dementia to appear at an earlier date in the\nsuggests that formal education and adult occupation provide\ncognitive practice that is conducive to the development and\nmaintenance of cognitive abilities (National Research Council,\n2000). For both historical and cultural reasons, the current\ncohort of oldest old Chinese women was significantly\ndisadvantaged in both educational and occupational achieve-\nment compared with their male counterparts. Oldest old women\nwere born and raised in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal\nChinese society. Women's status was extremely low in this\npatriarchal society. For centuries, women were at the bottom of\nthe social hierarchy: ``Except for those few who worked in the\nfields, women were kept confined to their immediate living\nquarters, denied an education, and not permitted to own prop-\na result, the majority of oldest old Chinese women were\nilliterate and had little exposure to non-agricultural occupations.\nLack of education and work opportunities also meant that most\nof oldest old women were exposed to simple environments\n(e.g., their living quarters and the fields) throughout their lives.\nSchooler (1987) suggested that continued exposure to a simple\nenvironment may have a negative effect on cognitive func-\ntioning due to a lack of diverse stimuli. Thus, Chinese elderly\nwomen's low SES may play a significant role in the gender gap\nin cognitive impairment.\nSocial network. --In general, oldest old Chinese women have\nsmaller social networks compared with their male counterparts\nfor at least three reasons. First, due to women's longer\nlongevity, oldest old women are more likely than oldest old\nmen to be widowed. Whereas men were expected to remarry\nafter the loss of a spouse, women were often expected to remain\nchaste and unmarried (Walstedt, 1978). Second, marriage has\nhistorically been patrilocal. Due to the taboos against same-\nvillage marriages, women often left their village upon marriage,\nentered their husbands' families and communities as strangers,\nand had few opportunities to visit their own family, relatives,\nand friends. Therefore, women's social ties with their own\nfamily and friends were often weakened substantially after\nmarriage whereas men's social network remained stable\n(Watson, 1991). Third, many oldest old Chinese women have\nspent their whole lives staying at home and taking care of their\nhusbands and children; their social network might be relatively\nsmaller than that of older men who worked outside the home\nand had coworkers and friends. Recent research has shown that\nstructural features of social network (i.e., size and frequency of\ncontact) influence cognitive health in later life (Ho et al., 2001;\nZunzunegui, Alvarado, Del Ser, & Otero, 2003). The ``use it or\nlose it'' hypothesis suggests that mental stimulation can protect\nagainst cognitive decline. Because all social interactions require\nmobilization of cognitive faculties, people with larger social\nnetworks have more opportunities to use their cognitive\nfunctions and thus are less likely to lose them (Bassuk et al.,\nfrequent contact in larger social networks was associated with\nless cognitive decline 12 years later. In another study, Swedish\nresearchers reported that an extensive social network protected\nagainst dementia (Fratiglioni, Wang, Ericsson, Maytan, &\nLeisure activities. --Oldest old Chinese women are also less\nlikely than their male counterparts to participate in leisure activ-\nities such as reading, writing, and playing cards or mah-jong\nZHANG\ndue partly to their lack of education (Zeng et al., 2003)\nand partly to the centuries-old idea that women should be at\nhome serving their husbands and taking care of children rather\nthan pursuing their own hobbies. Recent literature shows that\ndifferent leisure activities--including social, physical, and\nintellectual activities--requires the use of different cognitive\ncomponents such as memory, planning, and time and space\norientation and thus could protect against cognitive decline in\nold age (Wang et al., 2002). Moreover, engaging in leisure\nactivities entailing high cognitive effort (such as playing games\nor cards and reading books or newspapers) was more strongly\nassociated with having cognitive ability than engaging in\nactivities low in cognitive effort (such as gardening and\nperforming household tasks; Singh-Manoux, Richards, &\nDifferential survival rates. --The higher prevalence of\ncognitive impairment among oldest old Chinese women com-\npared with men may be caused in part by differential mortality\nPerl and colleagues found that while mortality rates for men and\nwomen with normal cognitive function were similar, demented\nold) were more likely than demented men to survive. Pre-\nliminary research in Shanghai also suggests that mortality rates\nfor demented men may be slightly higher than for demented\nwomen. Nonetheless, the gender gap in the prevalence of\ncognitive impairment in China is so great that differential\nmortality is unlikely to be the major factor (Zhang et al., 1990).\nBased on previous research, this article hypothesizes that\namong the Chinese oldest old (a) women are at higher risk than\nmen for cognitive impairment, and (b) women's disadvantages\nin SES, social network, and leisure activities largely account for\ntheir higher risk of cognitive impairment compared with men.\nMETHODS\nData\nLongitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), I examined\ngender differentials in the risk of cognitive impairment among\nthe Chinese oldest old. The CLHLS was conducted in a\nrandomly selected one half of the counties and cities of China's\n22 provinces. The survey area covered 85% of the Chinese\npopulation. The target respondents were aged 80 and older in\nsurvey, 8,959 respondents aged 80 and older were interviewed;\ncompleted the interview. The richness of information collected\non cognitive functioning, SES, social network, and lifestyles\nmakes the CLHLS particularly suitable for research on gender\ndisparities in cognitive impairment among the Chinese\noldest old.\nyears old in 1998 (see Figure 1). I excluded those who reported\nbeing aged 106 or older due to insufficient information to\nvalidate their old age (Zeng & Vaupel, 2002). The analytic\nsample for the odds of having cognitive impairment at baseline\nwas restricted to 8,291 respondents, which reflects the\nelimination of 39 persons with missing data on key independent\nvariables and 475 respondents who did not participate in the\ncognitive test due to hearing or vision impairments, sickness,\nrefusal to participate, or other unspecified reasons. The analytic\nFigure 1. Diagram of sample design for analysis.\nsample for the onset of cognitive impairment from 1998 to\nconsidered normal in 1998 based on their scores in the\ncognitive test. Of these respondents, 774 (12%) experienced the\nonset of cognitive impairment during the two-year interval,\ncould not take the cognitive test due to various reasons.\nMeasures\nDependent variables. --I measured the cognitive functioning\nof the Chinese oldest old by using the Chinese version of Mini-\nMental State Examination (MMSE), which tests four aspects\nof cognitive functioning: orientation, calculation, recall, and\nlanguage (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). The Chinese\nversion of the MMSE (see Appendix) was culturally translated\nfrom the international standard of the MMSE questionnaire and\nwas carefully tested in pilot survey interviews. On the whole,\nmost items could be translated without modification. However,\nsome items were changed in order to adapt to the cultural and\nsocioeconomic conditions of the Chinese oldest old so that all\nquestions would be easily understandable and answerable if the\nrespondent had normal cognitive functioning. For example, the\nChinese MMSE asks respondents to name as many foods as\npossible instead of writing a sentence (which is an impossible\ntask to ask of this group of the oldest old, the majority of whom\nare illiterate). In calculation, the question was simplified\n(Zeng & Vaupel, 2002). Consistent with previous studies, the\nnumber of ``unable to answer'' answers was much higher for\nthe relatively difficult tasks compared with the relatively easy\ntasks. As has been recommended in the literature, I counted\nresponses of ``unable to answer'' as incorrect answers (Herzog\n& Wallace, 1997). The range of scores for the MMSE is 0 to\n30, with lower scores indicating poor cognitive ability. For the\ncurrent sample, the reliability of the MMSE scale was high\n(Cronbach's a\u00bc.94), and the weighted mean score was about 25.\nBecause there are no established guidelines for determining\ncognitive impairment in the Chinese oldest old, I followed the\ncriteria set by the international standard and by previous stud-\nies conducted in China. Respondents were defined as having\n``moderate-severe cognitive impairment'' (hereafter ``cognitive\nimpairment'') if their score of MMSE was less than 18 (Gu &\net al., 1989). The choice of using a very low cut-off point such\nas 18 reduced MMSE measurement error because those in-\ndividuals who scored less than 18 had a very high probability\nof being cognitively impaired, regardless of education (Folstein\nprovements have been made on the cognitive screening\ninstrument for illiterate and low education populations, it is\nunrealistic to expect the full elimination of the influence of\neducation on screening tests (Teng et al., 1994). For example,\nrespondents with no formal education were usually less familiar\nwith the test procedures and more nervous during the testing\nthan those who had some formal education (Zhang et al., 1998;\nZhang et al., 1990). Given that the overwhelming majority of\noldest old Chinese women are illiterate and that oldest old\nChinese men have very limited education, it is appropriate to\nuse a very low cut-off point to measure cognitive impairment.\nThe odds of having cognitive impairment were based on the\ncoded as 1, indicating the presence of cognitive impairment;\nscores equal to or higher than 18 were coded as 0, indicating\nno cognitive impairment. The onset of cognitive impairment\nbased on whether MMSE scores for respondents whose\ncognition was considered normal at baseline fell below 18 at\nfollow up. The dependent variable in the longitudinal model\nhas four outcomes: cognitively impaired, death, loss to follow\nup, and cognitively normal (the reference category).\nIndependent variables. --In this study, gender (female \u00bc 1)\nwas the focal independent variable. I examined three blocks of\nvariables that might mediate gender differentials in cognitive\nimpairment and measured each at baseline. The first block\nwas SES. Two indicators were created to reflect a respondent's\noverall SES: education and primary lifetime occupation.\nBecause educational attainment of the Chinese oldest old is\nextremely low, years of schooling were grouped into two\ncategories: 0 years (no formal education \u00bc 1) and one or more\nyears. Primary lifetime occupation was measured as a dummy\nvariable including non-agriculture and agriculture/housework\n(the reference category). Previous research in China has found\nthat people working in the fields as well as those without paid\njobs are at higher risk for cognitive impairment in late life than\nthose working in a non-agriculture sector (Gu & Qiu, 2003). The\nsecond block was social network, which included marital status\n(single \u00bc 1), the number of children who frequently visited (0\u00ad\n5), and whether the respondent had frequent sibling visits. The\nthird block was participation in leisure activities, including\nexercising, garden work/growing vegetables, reading news-\npapers or books, playing cards or mah-jong, watching TV or\nlistening to the radio. All were measured as dummy variables.\nThe control variables included age, activity of daily living\n(ADL) disability, and place of residence (rural \u00bc 1). Advancing\nage is associated with cognitive impairment (e.g., Zeng et al.,\nwith higher prevalence rates of cognitive impairment (Gu &\ncognitive decline (Black & Rush, 2002), although the specific\nmechanisms remain unclear. I indexed ADL disability by\ncounting the number of ADLs that a respondent could not\nperform independently. (The six ADLs items were bathing,\ndressing, eating, indoor transferring, toileting, and continence.)\nThe summated scale ranges from 0 to 6 (Cronbach's a \u00bc .86).\nIn China, there are large disparities in standards of living\nbetween rural and urban areas. Compared with their urban\ncounterparts, rural residents are disadvantaged in many aspects,\nincluding quality of education, access to good jobs, health care,\nand geographic mobility (Liang et al., 2000). Previous research\non China has found that the urban oldest old have better\ncognitive functioning compared with rural residents (Zeng &\nAnalytic Strategy\nI first examined the characteristics of the Chinese oldest old\nby gender (this article reports means for continuous variables\nand percentages for categorical variables). Then a series of\nnested logistic regression models were estimated to test the\nZHANG\ngender differentials in the odds of cognitive impairment among\nthe Chinese oldest old. The first model estimated the total effect\nof gender, controlling for age, ADL disability, and place of\nresidence. The second model incorporated socioeconomic\nfactors achieved earlier in life, which are most exogenous to\ncognitive impairment in advanced age. Then social network\nand leisure activities were entered sequentially to assess the\nchanges in the main effects of gender on cognitive impair-\nment. Reductions in the main effects after the introduction\nof these variables would point to the importance of SES, social\nnetwork, and leisure activities as mechanisms that contribute\nto gender differentials in cognitive impairment.\nI used multinomial logistic regression to examine the onset of\ncognitive impairment. The total effect of gender was estimated\nfirst, controlling for age, ADL disability, and rural residence;\nthen SES, social network, and leisure activities were entered\nsequentially to assess whether the main effects of gender on the\nincidence of cognitive impairment were reduced. Unless other-\nwise noted, this article presents results based on unweighted\ndata. As the sampling weights in the data set are solely a\nfunction of the major independent variables used in the analysis\n(i.e., age, gender, and rural residence), the unweighted\nestimates are preferable because they are unbiased, consistent,\nand have smaller standard errors than weighted estimates\nRESULTS\nThe descriptive profiles in Table 1 demonstrate substantial\ndifferences in the characteristics of oldest old men and women\nin China. As expected, oldest old women were older, less\neducated, and less likely to work in a non-agricultural sector\nthan oldest old men. As high as 81% of oldest old women had\nreceived no formal education, compared with 33% of oldest old\nmen. Only 18% of oldest old women had ever held a job in\na non-agricultural sector compared with 45% of their male\ncounterparts. Compared with oldest old men, oldest old women\nwere more likely to be single, less likely to have frequent visits\nby siblings, and had fewer children who visited frequently. In\naddition, oldest old women were less likely than oldest old men\nto participate in all five leisure activities. The prevalence of\ncognitive impairment for oldest old women was 2.2 times as\nhigh as that for oldest old men.\nTable 2 shows the results of logistic regression models,\nwhich examined the roles that SES, social network, and leisure\nactivities play in gender disparities in the odds of cognitive\nimpairment at baseline, net of age, ADL disability, and rural\nresidence. According to Model 1, the odds of having cognitive\nimpairment were 2.2 for oldest old women in relation to oldest\nold men, controlling for age, rural residence, and ADL dis-\nability. As expected, adding SES in Model 2 significantly\nreduced the gender effect on cognitive impairment. Model 3\nincorporated social network. The gender effect was reduced\nslightly but remained statistically significant. Model 4 incor-\nporated leisure activities, and the gender effect was further\nreduced but remained statistically significant. The odds of being\ncognitively impaired were 1.3 for oldest old women in relation\nto their male counterparts, controlling for all the covariates.\nConsistent with previous findings about correlates of\ncognitive impairment, results in Model 4 show that age and\nADL disability were positively associated with cognitive im-\npairment. Rural residents had slightly higher odds of cognitive\nimpairments than their urban counterparts ( p , .1). Respond-\nents with no formal education were at higher risk for cognitive\nimpairment than respondents with some education; respondents\nwho had worked in a non-agricultural sector had less risk of\ncognitive impairment than those who had worked in the\nagricultural sector or had no paying job. Being single was\nassociated with higher odds of cognitive impairment, whereas\nhaving children who frequently visited was associated with\nTable 1.

The effect of sibling visits was in the expected\ndirection but was not statistically significant. Consistent with\nprevious research, each leisure activity was associated with\nhaving lower odds of cognitive impairment.\nNext, I estimated multinomial logistic regression models to\nexamine (a) whether there were gender differences in the onset\nof cognitive impairment among the oldest old whose cognition\nwas normal at baseline, and (b) what factors contributed to\ngender differences in the risk of cognitive impairment. Table 3\nsummarizes the results from the series of nested models. Model\n1 shows that gender had a significant effect on the risk of\ncognitive impairment, controlling for age, ADL disability, and\nrural residence. Oldest old women were 66% more likely than\noldest old men to experience the onset of cognitive impairment.\nAge, ADL disability, and rural residence significantly increased\nthe risk of cognitive impairment. Adding SES to Model 1\nsubstantially reduced the gender effect, although it remained\nstrong and statistically significant. Model 2 suggests that the\ngender effect was partially mediated by gender differences in\neducation and primary lifetime occupation, both of which are\nrisk factors of cognitive impairment. Model 3 incorporated the\nsocial network variables. The gender effect was further reduced\nbut remained statistically significant. Model 3 shows that\nhaving children who frequently visit significantly reduced the\nrisk of cognitive impairment. However, sibling visits and\nmarital status did not have the same protective effects against\ncognitive impairment. In Model 4, the gender effect was\nreduced slightly and became statistically nonsignificant after\nthe introduction of the five leisure activities. Consistent with\nprevious studies in China and other countries, the present study\nfound that people who did garden work or grew vegetables,\nplayed cards or mah-jong, or watched TV or listened to the\nradio ( p , .1) were less likely than those who did not par-\nticipate in these activities to experience the onset of cogni-\ntive impairment.\nThe sixth column of Table 3 shows the risk of death relative\nder differences in mortality existed among those who were\ncognitively normal at baseline: Oldest old women were sig-\nnificantly less likely (odds ratio \u00bc 0.57) than their male\ncounterparts to die, controlling for all the covariates. Age and\nADL disability significantly increased the risk of death. On the\nother hand, being married, having children who frequently visit,\nexercising, gardening, and watching TV or listening to the radio\nsignificantly reduced the risk of death.\nThe last column of Table 3 shows the risk of loss to follow\nup relative to being cognitively normal. Those who lived in\nrural areas, did garden work or grew vegetables, or had siblings\nor children who frequently visited were less likely than those\nwho did not participate in these activities to drop out of the\nstudy. Those who had ADL disability or could read newspapers\nor books were more likely to drop out. These findings are\nconsistent with previous studies in China and Japan that showed\nthat people with higher SES were more likely than people with\nlower SES to drop out of research studies, partly due to greater\nmobility among those with higher SES (Gu, 2005).\nFinally, I performed an indirect test to examine whether the\ngender differential in the prevalence of cognitive impairment\nwas partly due to the differential mortality selection among men\nand women with cognitive impairment. Table 4 shows the\nresults of the logistic regression model that regresses the log\ncognitive impairment at baseline, being female, and the in-\nteraction terms of female and cognitive impairment at baseline.\nConsistent with previous findings, oldest old women with\ncognitive impairment were significantly less likely than their\nmale counterparts to die. The odds of death were 59% (0.75 3\nTable 3.

Results suggested few statistically sig-\nnificant gender interaction effects, with one exception. Having\nan occupation in a non-agricultural sector lowered women's\nodds of having cognitive impairment at baseline more than they\ndid men's.\nDISCUSSION\nGender may be an important risk factor of cognitive im-\npairment in developing countries such as China, where older\nwomen have been oppressed in a patriarchal and patrilineal\nsociety from early childhood to adulthood. Previous research in\nlarge Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Beijing report\nsubstantial gender inequalities in the prevalence of cogni-\ntive impairment.\nThis article added to this research by examining the gender\neffect in the likelihood of cognitive impairment in the oldest\nold. It is the first article that uses nationwide longitudinal data\nto study gender differentials in cognitive impairment in a\ndeveloping country as well as specific mechanisms leading to\nthose differentials. Results showed that gender has a significant\neffect on the risk of cognitive impairment in the Chinese oldest\nold, controlling for age, ADL disability, and rural residence.\nAdding SES substantially reduces the gender differentials in the\nrisk of cognitive impairment, suggesting that the low SES status\nof Chinese oldest old women contributes to their poor cognitive\nfunctioning in old age. As for the explanatory powers of the\nthree blocks of variables (SES, social network, and leisure\nactivities), SES appears to be the most powerful, accounting for\n42% of the gender differentials. Social network and participa-\ntion in leisure activities together explain about 24% of the\ngender differentials, net of SES. However, the remaining 34%\nof the gender differentials cannot be explained in the full\nmodel. Previous research as well as the indirect test of\ndifferential survival rates of oldest old men and women with\ncognitive impairment suggest that the survival advantages of\noldest old women with cognitive impairment compared with\ntheir male counterparts might play a role in the remaining\ngender gap in the prevalence of cognitive impairment.\nThe results from the multinomial logistic regression models\nshow that SES is also the most powerful mediating variable.\nThe SES block explains about 39% of the gender effect in the\nonset of cognitive impairment. Social network and participation\nin leisure activities also play important roles. Together they\nexplain about 24% of the gender effect, net of SES.\nA caveat in interpreting these results is that the life\nexperiences of the current cohort of Chinese oldest old are\nvastly different from those of future cohorts of older adults. The\ncohorts in this study experienced much political and social\noverthrew the Qing Dynasty, the 10-year civil war between the\nCommunist Party and Kuomingtang, the 8-year war against the\nJapanese invasion in the mid-1930s, the subsequent civil war\nthat led to the founding of the People's Republic of China in\npolitical persecution. In other words, the current cohort of the\noldest old are lucky survivors of wars, famines, and political\npersecution. The exceptionally good health of the Chinese oldest\nold, men in particular, may also reflect this selection effect.\nBecause each new cohort is exposed to distinct experiences that\nmay affect their cognitive functioning in their twilight years,\nmonitoring the gendered health pattern of the future cohorts of\nolder people is crucial in helping researchers understand the\nroles that aging, cohorts, and time periods play in cognitive\nimpairment (Alwin, McCammon, Rodgers, & Wray, 2004).\nThe present study has several strengths, including the use of\nlongitudinal data, the use of a large nationwide sample of the\noldest old, and the exploration of mediating roles of SES, social\nnetwork, and leisure activities in the gender differentials in\ncognitive impairment. However, researchers should consider\nseveral limitations when interpreting the results. First, a brief\nepidemiological screening instrument for dementia rather than\na comprehensive clinical evaluation was used to detect\nmoderate-severe cognitive impairment. Obviously, clinical eval-\nuations are more accurate; however, due to budget limitations,\nthe CLHLS did not conduct clinical tests. Nevertheless, the\neffects of the major independent variables on cognitive im-\npairment in the study are consistent with previous studies that\nused clinical tests to detect cognitive impairment. Second,\nalthough the CLHLS included self-reports of major diseases--\nsome of which are risk factors for cognitive impairment--this\ninformation was not included in the present analysis because\nthe data were inaccurate. Most Chinese oldest old, particularly\nthose in rural areas, do not have medical records and access to\nclinical diagnosis due to poor medical facilities.\nIn spite of these limitations, this article extends researchers'\nunderstanding of the excess gender differentials of cognitive\nimpairment among Chinese oldest old. Although oldest old\nwomen have significantly lower mortality rates than oldest old\nmen, they are at much higher risk for cognitive impairment due\nto their lifetime disadvantages in SES, social network, and\nleisure activities. Chinese oldest old women are a vulnerable\ngroup that needs much help. These findings also suggest that\nwomen in other developing countries may face the same\nproblems as Chinese women as life expectancy continues to\nimprove. This is because women in most developing countries\nare less educated, have fewer opportunities to develop their\ncognitive skills over their life course, and hold a lower social\nand economic status than men.\nTable 4. Estimated Odds Ratios from Logistic Regression Models of\nVariable Model 1 Model 2\nIn less than 50 years, China's oldest old population is\nprojected to reach 100 million. Most of the future cohorts of\nolder people will have only 1 or 2 children due to the one-child\npolicy. It will be increasingly difficult for elderly parents to rely\ntotally on adult children to take care of them. The increasing\nrate of cognitive impairment among women and other\neconomically disadvantaged groups poses significant problems\nnot only for the individuals and families but for Chinese society\nas a whole. Future research should focus on whether mod-\nifications of some predictors of cognitive decline in later life--\nsuch as life-long learning, volunteer work, participation in\nsocial and leisure activities either at home or in community\ncenters for elders, and strengthening intergenerational ties--\ncould delay the onset of cognitive impairment. Ultimately, this\narticle suggests that investment in girls' education will have\nlong-term payoffs, even to the oldest old age, and closing\ngender disparities in formal education will significantly reduce\nthe gender gap in cognitive impairment in old age.\n"
