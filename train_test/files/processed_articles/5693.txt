In particular, this study focuses on displacement and complementary effects\nand on devices for Internet access. Using representative data from Japan (N = 1,179), the results show that Internet use via\nmobile phone has complementary effects on information acquisition from traditional media, while Internet use via personal\ncomputers does not. In addition, the results show that Internet use via personal computers has a displacement effect on\ninformation acquisition from radio. These findings are discussed with regard to communication means, social contexts, and\nmedia interfaces.\n",

In consumer research, various\nstudies (Berger & Messerschmidt, 2009; Labuschagne, van\nZyl, van der Merwe, & Kruger, 2012; Rijnsoever, Castaldi,\n& Dijst, 2012) have been conducted on prepurchase informa-\ntion searching. News media consumption is one of the most\nimportant research themes in media research (cf.

There may be differences between Internet use via\nmobile phone and Internet use via personal computer in\nterms of how the mode of access affects the use of traditional\ninformation sources.\nThis study divides Internet use into Internet use via mobile\nphone and that via personal computer, and it examines the\neffects of Internet use via mobile phone and via personal\ncomputer on the use of traditional information sources, using\nJapanese national survey data from 2009. The results of this\nresearch show that Internet use via mobile phone has com-\nplementary effects on the use of traditional media, whereas\nInternet use via personal computer does not.\nInformation Acquisition\nBehaviors and the Internet\nbelong to a research field closely related to the use\n1Tokyo Keizai University, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nSatoshi Kitamura, Tokyo Keizai University, 1-7-34, Minami-cho,\nEmail: satkit@tku.ac.jp\nThe Relationship Between Use of the\nInternet and Traditional Information\nSources: An Empirical Study in Japan\nSatoshi Kitamura1\n Keywords\ninformation acquisition, Internet use, media exposure, mobile phone, personal computer\n2 SAGE Open\nof information sources. In Bettman's (1978) framework,\ninformation acquisition consists of search and being con-\nfronted. \"Being confronted\" refers to the acquisition of infor-\nmation in the form of accidental contact with the information\nwhile engaged in other acts. \"Search\" is divided into two\nparts: internal and external. Internal search refers to informa-\ntion acquisition from a person's own memory, while external\nsearch refers to information acquisition from external sources\nWhen sufficient information is not obtained internally, exter-\nnal search is performed (Blackwell et al., 2006).\nIn Bettman's (1978) framework, being confronted and\nexternal search are both closely related to the use of infor-\nmation sources. In the fields of consumer research and\nhealth communication research, a number of researchers\nhave studied external search; many of these have focused on\nthe Internet and the ways in which its use has spread (Huang\n& Hamm, 2012). The Internet has also attracted consider-\nable attention in the field of health communication research\nas a means to improve health and health care delivery (e.g.,\n2009). Indeed, because a lot of people search online for\ninformation about specific diseases or medical problems,\nweb queries can be used for syndromic surveillance (Hulth,\nRydevik, & Linde, 2009) or detecting influenza epidemics\nWhen addressing the usefulness of the Internet from the\nviewpoint of information acquisition behavior, the following\ntwo points may be mentioned. One is the Internet's useful-\nness as a source of low-cost access to information. Jepsen\n(2007) studied low costs and benefits as factors affecting\nconsumer use of the Internet for information searches. The\nresults of her analysis showed that perceived low search\ncosts positively affected the use of the Internet for prepur-\nchase information searches. The perceived low cost of using\nthe Internet for information searching is caused by the com-\nparison of the Internet with other information channels. In\nthis view, the superiority of the Internet to other channels is\nan important factor.\nThe other key point is that the Internet is a useful way to\nobtain information that cannot be obtained from traditional\nsources. The advances of the Internet have transcended the\ntraditional limitations of word-of-mouth (Duan, Gu, &\nWhinston, 2008). The Internet provides an opportunity for\nusers to share a variety of information (Chen & Xie, 2008;\nInternet and Other Media:\nDisplacement and Complementary Effects\nThe ways in which a new medium affects traditional media\nhas been a recurring topic for researchers studying mediated\ncommunication (e.g., Chyi, Yang, Lewis, & Zheng, 2010;\nhave specifically studied how the Internet affects traditional\ncommunication channels.\nConsistent results about the relationship between televi-\nsion viewing and Internet use have not yet been obtained.\nRobinson, Kestnbaum, Neustadtl, and Alvarez (2002) com-\npared the time-diaries of Internet users and nonusers in a com-\nshowed that there were consistent declines in television view-\ning and sleep times among Internet users, but no consistent\ndeclines in reading or other activities. Nie and Hillygus (2002)\nexamined the displacement theory of time utilization using\nthe 2002 Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of\nSociety (SIQSS) time-diary data. The results showed that\ntime spent on the Internet was negatively related to time spent\non social activities, hobbies, reading, and television viewing.\nHowever, some studies (Hashimoto, 2009; Saito,Takeshita,\nKawakami, & Midooka, 2004) do not support the decline of\ntelevision viewing as caused by Internet use. Using time-\ndiary data, Hashimoto (2009) compared the time-diaries of\nthe days in which Internet users accessed the Internet at\nhome and the days in which they did not. His results showed\nthat Internet users spent a longer time watching television on\nthe days when they accessed the Internet at home than on the\ndays when they did not. Saito et al. (2004) also found that use\nof the Internet did not decrease television viewing, using a\nsurvey conducted in Tokyo in November 2003. Outside of\nJapan, Kraut, Kiesler, Boneva, and Shklovski (2006) found\nthat people who used the Internet for entertainment watched\ntelevision more frequently than those who did not.\nThere are different views on how the use of the Internet to\nobtain news information affects traditional news media. For\ninstance, Ha and Fang (2012) found that the Internet had a\ndisplacement effect on traditional media, including televi-\nsion and newspapers, in the daily news domain. However,\nseveral researchers have argued that the use of the Internet\nfor news information has complementary effects on tradi-\ntional news media (e.g., Nguyen & Western, 2006). Dutta-\nBergman (2004a) reported that users of online news media\nwere more likely to seek out news from traditional media\noutlets. Althaus and Tewksbury (2000) suggested, based on a\nsurvey of undergraduate students, that the use of the Internet\nas a news source was positively related with the reading of\nnewspapers, but had no relationship with the viewing of\ntelevision.\nIn the domain of consumer information searches, research-\ners have discussed whether the Internet has complementary\nor displacement effects on traditional media. Ratchford, Lee,\nand Talukdar (2003) examined the effects of the Internet on\nconsumer information searches by comparing data from sur-\nnatural experiment setting. Their results indicated that the\nInternet had led to reduced searching for information on\nautomobiles. On the contrary, Tsao and Sibley (2004)\nKitamura 3\nsuggested that Internet advertising has complementary\neffects on billboards, direct mail, magazines, and television,\nbut displacement effects on free community papers and\nweekly paid papers as advertising sources. In addition, Klein\nand Ford (2003) investigated Internet users' information\nsearching behavior when buying an automobile, and they\nshowed that hours per week of Internet use are positively\nrelated to total hours spent searching for automobile infor-\nmation and the total number of sources used to obtain that\ninformation. The above examples indicate the findings of\nprevious research prove to be inconsistent.\nWhether the Internet has complementary effects or dis-\nplacement effects on traditional media can be discussed via\nthe concept of functional alternatives. For instance, Flanagin\nand Metzger (2001) showed that the Internet's information\nretrieval and information giving features are used in ways\nsimilar to mass media channels including newspapers, televi-\nsion, and books and magazines.\nSeveral studies (Ferguson & Perse, 2000; P. S. N. Lee &\ntional alternatives to media through the uses and gratifica-\ntions theory. Ferguson and Perse (2000) examined the world\nwide web as a functional alternative to television using this\ntheory. They suggested that the web might be functionally\nsimilar to television, especially in its use for diversion, but\nmight not be a similarly relaxing way to spend time. Lin and\nSalwen (2006) compared online and offline news access\nthrough the uses and gratifications theory. They pointed out\nthat Internet news websites serve a purpose for \"information\nseeking,\" while print news media, which serve a purpose for\n\"information scanning,\" have a different role.\nDutta-Bergman (2004b) argued that interpersonal com-\nmunication, print readership, and Internet communication\nare active communication channels, while television and\nradio are passive consumption channels. Based on 1999\nHealthStyles data, he demonstrated that active communica-\ntion channels serve as primary health information sources for\nhealth information\u00adoriented individuals, but passive con-\nsumption channels serve as primary health information\nresources for individuals who are not health-oriented. Based\non these previous studies (Dutta-Bergman, 2004b; Ferguson\n2006), it can be asserted that the Internet does not simply\ndisplace traditional media such as television and newspapers\nbut also complements them in various ways.\nInternet Use Via Personal\nComputers and Mobile Phones\nSince the advent of Japan's i-mode service (Ishii, 2004; Tee &\nGawer, 2009), accessing the Internet via mobile phone is a\ncommon activity in Japan. Japanese mobile phone users are\nforming a unique culture (Ito, Okabe, & Matsuda, 2005). With\nrespect to Internet access, several studies have found that there\nare sociocultural differences between Internet use via personal\ncomputer and via mobile phone (Boase & Kobayashi, 2008;\npersonal computer and about 40% of Internet users via\nmobile phone obtain information such as weather, traffic, or\nmovies. The Internet via mobile phone is less used for infor-\nmation seeking than the Internet via personal computer.\nIn addition, Internet use via mobile phone is a more time-\nenhancing activity, while Internet use via personal computer\nis a more time-displacing activity (Ishii, 2004). Owing to the\ntime-enhancing quality of Internet use via mobile phone, it\nhas no displacement effect on traditional media. We predict\nthat Internet use via mobile phone in fact has complementary\neffects on traditional media.\nIn Japan, the most important activity performed on the\nInternet via mobile phone is sending and receiving emails.\nThere appear to be sociocultural differences between emails\nsent via personal computer and via mobile phone: emails\nsent via mobile phone are typically used for communication\nwith one's close friends and family, whereas emails via per-\nsonal computer are used for communication with people\nwith whom one is less familiar (Ishii, 2006; Miyata &\nKobayashi, 2008). Thus, the Internet, a network of networks,\nis considered not only a mass medium but also a personal\ncommunication medium (Morris & Ogan, 1996).\nThe effects of the Internet on the use of information\nsources include effects on the use of other people as sources\nof information. Email via mobile phone is used for commu-\nLing, Bertel, & Sunds\u00f8y, 2012). Emailing via mobile phone\nsupports existing supportive relationships (Miyata, Boase, &\nWellman, 2008). These findings indicate that the use of\nemails via mobile phone can facilitate informational support\nfrom close relationships. We predict that Internet use via\nmobile phone has an effect on the use of interpersonal\nresources.\nIn this article, we operationally define \"complementary\neffect\" as a positive effect and \"displacement effect\" as a\nnegative effect of Internet use on information acquisition\nfrom traditional media. Based on the previous discussion, we\npropose the following hypotheses.\nHypothesis 1: Internet use via mobile phone will have\ncomplementary effects on the use of traditional media\nas information sources.\nHypothesis 2: Internet use via mobile phone will have\ncomplementary effects on the use of interpersonal\ncommunication channels as information sources.\nPrevious studies (e.g., Althaus & Tewksbury, 2000;\neffects of Internet use via personal computer on the use of\nother information channels for information seeking.\nHowever, there are no consistent results regarding the\n4 SAGE Open\ndisplacement and complementary effects in media use.\nBecause of media use as a sociocultural phenomenon,\nsociocultural factors affect the displacement and comple-\nmentary effects in media use.\nMatsuda, 2010) indicate that, in Japan, Internet access via\nmobile phones is used widely and quite differently from\nInternet access via personal computers. Therefore, the\neffects of Internet use via personal computer might be dif-\nferent from the effects of Internet use via mobile phone on\nthe use of traditional information sources. Regarding\nInternet use via personal computer, we form hypotheses that\nare the opposite of the hypotheses regarding Internet use via\nmobile phone.\nHypothesis 3: Internet use via personal computer will\nhave displacement effects on the use of traditional\nmedia as information sources.\nHypothesis 4: Internet use via personal computer will\nhave displacement effects on the use of interpersonal\ncommunication channels as information sources.\nMethod\nResearch Design\nTo examine the hypotheses, this study analyzes Japanese\nnational survey data. Based on the sampling survey data that is\nrepresentative, it is possible to show the effects of Internet use\non the use of traditional information sources in a society. This\nensures the external validity of the findings of this research.\nIn a representative national survey, respondents consist of\nseveral social groups. Because sociodemographic character-\nistics are key determinants of Internet use (Katz & Rice,\n2002), the characteristics may affect the correlations between\nInternet use and information acquisition. Therefore, it is nec-\nessary to examine not only the effects of Internet use but also\nthose of demographic factors. This study statistically con-\ntrolled the effects of demographic factors using regression\nanalysis and examined the effects of Internet use via mobile\nphone and via personal computer.\nSampling\nIn June 2009, our research group carried out a Japanese\nnational survey using a two-stage stratified random sampling\nmethod based on Japan's Basic Resident Register. At the first\nstage, 157 survey areas were selected by the stratified ran-\ndom sampling method. At the second stage, 14 to 17 people\naged 13 to 69 were randomly selected from each area. Self-\nadministered questionnaires and diary-style questionnaires\nwere distributed to the homes of the 2,500 respondents by a\nresearch company and were collected following completion.\nthe analyses included only the data of respondents with no\nmissing values in the dependent, independent, and control\nwere male.\nMeasurement: Dependent Variables\nThe respondents were asked what sources of information\nthey had used during the last month to acquire information\non nine topics: news, weather, travel or tourism, shopping or\nproducts, health or medicine, TV programs, music or con-\ncerts, food, and local businesses. Six information sources\nother than the Internet--television, radio, newspapers, mag-\nazines, flyers, and friends or family members--were pre-\nsented as options in multiple-choice questions.\nIn the analysis, the sums of the topics researched through\neach source of information were used as dependent variables\n(minimum = 0, maximum = 9). Table 1 shows the descriptive\nstatistics of these variables.\nMeasurement: Independent Variables\nIn this study, Internet use was divided into two types (com-\nputer use and mobile use) and the variables of Internet use\nwere weighted by the amount of Internet use. Using a diary-\nsurvey method, respondents recorded their use of media over\na designated 2-day period. The variables of Internet use via\npersonal computer and mobile phone were weighted by the\nnumber of days on which each respondent used the Internet\n(no use = 0, no access on either day = 1, access on one day =\n2, access on both days = 3). Figure 1 shows the distributions\nof the independent variables.\nMeasurement: Control Variables\nTo control the effects of demographic factors, the following\nvariables were included in the analyses: gender (male = 0,\nfemale = 1), age, age squared, education (junior high school\n= 1, high school = 2, junior or technical college = 3, univer-\nsity or graduate school = 4), work (full-time = 1, other = 0),\nstudent (student = 1, nonstudent = 0), and household income\n(8-point scale).\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics of Dependent Variables.\nPercentiles\nKitamura 5\nResults\nThe results are divided into two sections: correlation analysis\nfor dependent variables and independent or control variables,\nand regression analysis in testing hypotheses.\nCorrelations Between Dependent Variables and\nIndependent or Control Variables\nBefore performing a detailed analysis, we examined the cor-\nrelation between dependent variables and independent or\ncontrol variables. The dependent variables are count vari-\nables, so I used Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficients\n(see Table 2).\nInternet use via personal computer had a significantly\npositive correlation with information acquisition from maga-\nzines and negative correlations with information acquisition\nfrom radio and newspapers. On the other hand, Internet use\nvia mobile phone had significantly positive correlations with\ninformation acquisition from television, magazines, flyers,\nand friends and family, and negative correlations with infor-\nmation acquisition from newspapers.\nHypotheses\nTo examine Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, and 4, an analysis with\nregression models was conducted. In the analysis, demo-\ngraphic variables were added as control variables. As the\ndependent variables were count variables, negative bino-\nmial regression analysis was used for the estimation of\ncoefficients.\nIn the analysis, Internet use via personal computer and\nmobile phone, as well as the interaction of the two variables,\nwere used as independent variables. Gender, age, age\nsquared, level of education, household income per year,\nwork, and student were used as control variables. Table 3\nshows the results of this analysis.

These results almost\ncompletely support Hypothesis 1.\nFor Hypothesis 2, Internet use via mobile phone had\nsignificantly positive effects on the information acquisi-\ntion from friends and family members (b = .15, z = 4.14, p =\n.00). This result indicates the positive effects of Internet\nuse via mobile phone on the use of interpersonal commu-\nnication channels for information seeking, and supports\nHypothesis 2.\nThe results concerning the Hypotheses 3 and 4 were as\nfollows. The effects of Internet access via personal computer\non the use of information channels were different from the\neffects of mobile Internet access via those channels. Internet\naccess via personal computer had a significant negative\neffect on the use of radio as an information source (b = -.15,\nFigure 1. Distribution of Internet use via personal computer and\nmobile phone.\n6 SAGE Open\nz = -2.58, p = .01), while it had no significant effect on other\ninformation channels. The results indicate that Internet use\nvia personal computer has a displacement effect only on the\ninformation acquisition from radio. These results do not sup-\nport Hypotheses 3 and 4.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nFirst, this study examined the effects of Internet use via\nmobile phone on information acquisition behavior toward\ntraditional media and interpersonal communication chan-\nnels. The results almost completely supported Hypotheses 1\nand 2, demonstrating that people who use the Internet via\nmobile phone frequently acquire information from tradi-\ntional media and interpersonal communication channels as\nwell. These results indicate that Internet use via mobile\nphone has a complementary, not a displacement, effect on\ninformation acquisition from traditional media and interper-\nsonal communication channels.\nNext, this study examined the difference between the\neffects of Internet use via personal computers and via mobile\nphone on information acquisition behavior toward traditional\nmedia. The results demonstrate that Internet use via personal\ncomputer did not have positive effects on information acqui-\nsition behaviors from traditional media, unlike Internet use\nvia mobile phone. In addition, this study showed that Internet\nuse via personal computer had a displacement effect on\ninformation acquisition behavior toward one medium: radio.\nThese results are consistent with arguments that point to the\nsocial differences between Internet use via personal\nTable 3.

This might be related to the location\nwhere radio and Internet via personal computer are used.\nMany Japanese people who listen to radio programs are\nmobile listeners (Video Research, 2008). In contrast, many\nJapanese people who use the Internet via personal computer\nThe correlation coefficient between the information\nacquisition from newspapers and Internet use via mobile\nphone was negatively significant, but the results of regres-\nsion analysis showed that the regression coefficient of\nInternet use via mobile phone was not significant when\ndemographic variables were controlled. This result indicates\nthat, in recent times, the demographic factors mainly affect\nnewspaper reading in Japan.\nInternet access via mobile phone is not a sufficient\nsource of information and cannot replace the roles that tra-\nditional media have historically played. Rather, the results\nof this study indicate that people who frequently use the\nInternet via mobile phone are actually more likely to utilize\ntraditional media than those who do not. These results are\nconsistent with previous studies, one of which pointed out\nthat people use mobile phones to extend their active time\n(Ishii, 2004). Another previous study, performed from a\nsocial networking perspective, suggests that the number of\ntext messages sent via mobile phone increases with the\nexpansion of personal relationships (Miyata & Kobayashi,\n2008). These studies indicate that Internet use via mobile\nphone does not displace existing modes of communication,\nbut supplements or complements them. The results of the\npresent study support this theory. However, these same\nresults showed that Internet use via personal computer had\na displacement effect only on information acquisition from\nthe radio. With computers, television, and newspapers,\nmost information is transmitted by visual means, including\nletters or pictures; in contrast, radio is a communication\nmedium that uses sound only and has no means of visual\ncommunication. The results of this study may suggest that\nthe transmission of information by visual means plays a key\nrole in information circulation.\nOn the Internet, there is much information corresponding\nto various needs. If all Internet users could effectively use the\ninformation for their needs, the Internet could be the most\nuseful source of information, so that the Internet would have\ndisplacement effects on the traditional information sources.\nHowever, this study shows that the displacement effect of the\nInternet is not very significant.\nThe present study suggested that there are social differ-\nences between Internet use via personal computer and via\nmobile phone with regard to information acquisition behav-\nior. In future research, it will be necessary to consider the\nfactors that cause these differences. If sociocultural factors\nare to be considered, a social history approach (cf. Kortti,\n2010) could be an effective research method.\nThe differences of Internet use via personal computers\nand mobile phones include a difference of interfaces for\nInternet access. Therefore, it is also important to discuss\naccess to the Internet in the context of interface technology.\nIn recent years, the spread of smart phones such as iPhones\nand Androids has progressed worldwide. Most smart phones\nhave a touch-screen interface, an attribute that feature phones\ndo not have. This means that the use of mobile phones with\ninterfaces is advancing.\nIf the use of interfaces to access the Internet could cause a\ndifference in the social consequences of Internet use, it could\nalso cause a difference between the social consequences of\nthe uses of feature phones and smart phones. The smart\nphone market in Japan has grown rapidly since 2009\n(Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan,\n2012). In future research, it will be necessary to consider the\ndifferences between the social consequences of the use of\nfeature phones and smart phones.\nThis study has some limitations. First, this study found no\nevidence of causal relationships between the use of the\nInternet and traditional sources of information, although it\ndid find some significant cross-sectional associations. Thus,\nfuture research should examine these causal relationships.\nAnother limitation is the examination of cultural factors.\nThis study was not designed as a cross-cultural comparison.\nHowever, previous studies indicate that it is important to\nexamine whether cultural factors affect media usage (Donald\nings of this study should therefore be examined using cross-\ncultural survey data in future research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nsurvey for this study was carried out in Professor Hashimoto's labo-\nratory at the Interfaculty Initiative in Information Studies at the\nUniversity of Tokyo, as well as Dentsu Innovation Institute.
