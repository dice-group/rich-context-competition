This article adds to this line of inquiry by examining the relationship between religious\nparticipation and mortality, as well as the potential pathways linking these factors and subgroup variations among oldest\nold Chinese.\nMethods. Using two waves (1998 and 2000) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, I estimated Cox\nproportional hazards models for a nationwide sample of Chinese aged 80 to 105.\nResults. Controlling for a wide range of covariates, I found religious participation to be significantly associated with\nlower risk of mortality for oldest old women and for individuals in poor health. Engaging in leisure activities and exercises\npartially accounted for this association.\nDiscussion. Findings suggest that (a) religious participation, associated with other socially integrated and cognitively\nstimulating activities, predicts mortality risk among oldest old Chinese; and (b) religious participation offers psychosocial\nresources that are likely to compensate for the increased mortality risk associated with disadvantaged socioeconomic\nconditions of certain vulnerable groups such as women and individuals in poor health.\nKey Words: Religious participation--Mortality--Oldest old--China.\nCHINA, the most populous country in the world, is now\naging at a rapid speed. The number of the oldest old\npopulation aged 80 and older, currently the largest of any\nnation in the world, may increase by more than 100 million by\nprogram, the ``one-child policy'' introduced in 1980, worsened\nthe situation by reducing the size of the younger population.\nThis imbalance makes the care of older persons at both society\nand family levels increasingly difficult and calls for the\nrecognition of social factors responsible for the well-being of\nolder Chinese.\nReligious participation stands out as one of the important\nhealth-promoting social factors worthy of exploration. Despite\nthe recent decades of government constraint, China has\nhistorically been a country of multiple religious traditions, all\nof which have characteristics that are particularly relevant to\nbeliefs in China (Wu, 2007) disclosed that approximately one\nfourth of the Chinese population, or more than 300 million\nChinese, is involved in religious activities of one form or\nanother. This makes it feasible to explore the religion\u00adhealth\nassociation, a long neglected topic, in contemporary China. Spe-\ncifically, this article examines the religion\u00admortality associa-\ntion, as well as the potential mechanisms linking these factors\nand the subgroup variations.\nPrevious Research on Religion and Mortality in the\nUnited States\nThe past three decades have witnessed a growing body of\nU.S. research examining relationships between individual\nreligious involvement and health (for reviews, see Ellison &\ncreasing evidence suggests that multiple features of religious-\nness have beneficial effects on a wide range of health outcomes\n(Hummer, Ellison, Rogers, Moulton, & Romero, 2004; Koenig\net al., 2001). In particular, more frequent service attendance is\nassociated with a reduced risk of mortality (for reviews, see\nHummer et al., 2004; McCullough, Larson, Hoty, Koenig, &\nThoresen, 2000). Evidence comes from community-based epide-\nmiologic surveys (e.g., Koenig et al., 1999; Lutgendorf et al.,\nKaplan, 1997), nationwide surveys (Hummer, Rogers, Nam, &\nclinical samples (Oxman, Freeman, & Manheimer, 1995;\nPargament, Koenig, Tarakeshwar, & Hahn, 2001). Not\nsurprisingly, many of these studies have focused on older\nadults (e.g., Helm, Hays, Flint, Koenig, & Blazer, 2000; Hill,\n2004), among whom levels of religiousness tend to be high and\nfor whom religion is an arguably important social resource.\nDespite these recent advances in research on religion and\nmortality, investigators have only begun to examine this\nassociation among racial and ethnic minorities (Ellison,\nis evidence indicating that religious involvement is associated\nwith a reduction in the risk of mortality among African\nAmerican adults (Ellison et al., 2000) and older Hispanics (Hill\net al., 2005). However, little research has been done on the\nreligion\u00admortality association in a non-Western setting. In\nthis study, I hypothesized that participating in Eastern re-\nligions would also reduce the odds of death. This is the first\nhypothesis.\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2008 by The Gerontological Society of America\nReligious Participation and Mortality in China\nMost people in China practice a combination of folk religion,\nConfucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Different from Western\ncongregational religions, Chinese religious traditions have long-\nstanding and distinct psychosocial and behavioral functions on\nhealth and well-being. For instance, followers of Confucian\nteachings believe that virtues such as self-cultivation, chung\n(loyalty), shu (empathy), and jen (humaneness) are imperative to\ndeveloping and maintaining deep and profound relationships\nwith self, family, community, and state (Taylor, 1998). This\ngreatly facilitates the formation of secular social ties, on the basis\nof which coreligionists are likely to engage in various leisure\nactivities that are socially integrated or cognitively stimulating,\nsuch as collective exercises, playing cards, chase, or Mah-jongg\n(Ross & Zhang, 2008). Buddhism is more similar to Western\nreligion with respect to spiritual and ritual practices that are\nlikely to offer means to spiritual well-being, such as tolerance,\nself-control, harmony, inner peace, and wisdom (Ai, 2000).\nThese faith-based attitudes, along with rituals such as prayer,\nmay lead to positive expectations such as hope and optimism\n(Ai, Peterson, Tice, Bolling, & Koenig, 2004) that are likely to\nhelp vulnerable older Chinese such as women and individuals\nin bad health to cope effectively with traumatic life events. The\nspirit of Taoism underlines the mind\u00adbody connection and\npromotes holistic well-being through energy-based health\npractices and healing processes such as tai chi or qigong, which\ninvolve deep breath and meditation with movement (Ai, 2006).\nIn sum, Chinese religions have a potential impact on the\nhealth and well-being of older adults. They integrate essences\nfrom different religious traditions, build social as well as\nspiritual relationships, encourage an active lifestyle among\nparticipants, and create positive expectations. In this sense,\nChina is a nation of religion, not by a Western definition, but in\nits own way. Many aspects of Chinese religions are likely to be\nassociated with a reduction in the risk of mortality. This study\nhypothesized two sets of potential mediators linking Chinese\nreligions and mortality: psychological resources indicated by\noptimism and autonomy, and health behaviors indicated by\nengaging in collective exercises and other leisure activities.\nThis is the second hypothesis.\nReligion and Mortality: Subgroup Variations\nFindings on religion and mortality have become increasingly\nrobust, but studies have only begun to examine the contingent\neffects of religious involvement on mortality, and the available\nevidence is far from conclusive. Rogers, Hummer, and Nam\n(2000) suggested a stronger religion\u00admortality association for\nyounger adults, Ellison and colleagues (2000) showed gender\ndifferences in mechanisms underlying the religion\u00admortality\nlink, and Oman and Reed (1998) indicated that religious\nattendance amplified the effects of social support on mortality.\nWhereas some studies have shown stronger religion\u00admortality\nlinks among women, and especially among older women\ngeneral populations have not (Hummer et al., 1999; Musick\net al., 2004). Virtually no evidence suggests that the religion\u00ad\nmortality association differs by health status.\nTo explain how the influence of religiosity on health and\nwell-being conditioned on demographic factors, Schieman,\nNguyen, and Elliot (2003) proposed two competing theories.\nOne is called resource amplification theory: Religion is more\nvaluable in the context of other resources such as education,\nincome, and social activities. The other is called resource\ncompensation theory: Religion is more important in the absence\nof other types of advantage. Supporting the resource amplifi-\ncation view, Schieman and colleagues suggested that the\nnegative association between religiosity and mastery was\nstronger among those who were poorly educated. Their findings\non religion and mental health shed light on the religion\u00ad\nmortality association. Alternatively, Ellison (1991) indirectly\nsuggested the resource compensation view: The ``existential\ncertainty'' was associated more positively with life satisfaction\namong those who were less educated. Similarly, Ross and\nMirowsky (2006) disclosed the gender-conditioned association\nbetween education and psychological well-being: Women\nbenefit more from education than men because resources\nsubstitute for one another, and the presence of education makes\nthe absence of other resources less harmful.\nExtending resource compensation or substitution theory into\nthe religion\u00admortality scenario, one can reasonably argue that\nreligiousness, and the resources derived from it, benefit lon-\ngevity more for socioeconomically deprived groups such as\nwomen and individuals in poor health. For instance, Chinese\nwomen have historically lived in a patriarchal society where\nthey have structurally and systematically been denied education\nand mentally stimulating occupations (National Research\nnomic dependency and are more socioeconomically disadvan-\ntaged. In this study, I examined how participating in religious\nactivities may compensate for or amplify the disadvantaged\nsocioeconomic positions for women and for individuals in poor\nhealth. This is the third hypothesis of this article.\nMETHODS\nData\nChinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS).\nCLHLS was conducted by randomly selecting one half of the\ncities and counties of China's 22 provinces where Han Chinese\nare the ethnic majority. The survey area covered more than 85%\nof the Chinese population. The baseline sample included 9,093\nfor follow-up. This data set was ideal for testing the three pro-\nposed hypotheses because of its richness in variables tapping\ncharacteristics of religious participation, psychosocial resour-\nces, and a wide range of health behaviors. This study focused\nI excluded those aged 106 and older due to insufficient infor-\nmation to validate their old age (Zeng & Vaupel, 2002). After\nlistwise deletion of missing values, the analytic sample was\nMeasurement\nMortality. --Based on informant report, I recorded mortality\nZHANG\nI created a binary variable to distinguish the oldest old who had\nstill alive at the 2000 interview. I defined survival time as the\nnumber of days between the baseline interview and the date of\ndeath or final interview, at which point surviving participants\nrepresented censored observations. Roughly 37% of the\nparticipants died over the 2-year study period.\nReligious participation. --Respondents were asked how\noften they participated in religious activities (1 \u00bc every day,\n3 \u00bc never). I grouped participants indicating every day and\nsometimes were grouped into one category (1) and participants\nindicating never into another (0). More than 17% of the sample\nreported participating in religious activities at least sometimes.\nDemographics. --Demographic measures included age (in\nyears), ethnicity (Han: 0\u00bcminority, 1\u00bcHan), gender (female: 0\u00bc\nmale, 1 \u00bc female), marital status (married: 0 \u00bc not married, 1 \u00bc\nmarried), education (literate: 0 \u00bc illiterate, 1 \u00bc literate), urban/\nrural residence (urban: 0\u00bcrural residence, 1\u00bcurban residence),\nand east/west residence (east: 0 \u00bc west residence, 1 \u00bc east\nresidence). A majority of the sample was Han (93%), female\nBaseline health status. --Respondents were asked to evaluate\ntheir overall health status (1 \u00bc very bad, 5 \u00bc very good). The\nmean level of self-reported health was 3.64, roughly approach-\ning the ``good'' category.\nPsychological resources. --I used optimism and autonomy\nas the indicators of psychological resources. Respondents were\nasked the following: ``How often do you look on the bright side\nof things?'' and ``How often do you make your own\ndecisions?'' Responses to these two questions were coded in\nan increasing (1\u00ad5) manner such that higher scores reflected\nmore optimism and autonomy. A majority of the sample\nreported above average levels of optimism (M \u00bc 3.9) and of\nmaking their own decisions (M \u00bc 3.51).\nHealth behaviors. --I incorporated three health risk factors,\nsome of which have been used in previous studies (Hill,\nStrawbridge, Shema, Cohen, & Kaplan, 2001), and some of\nwhich were highly relevant in the Chinese cultural setting\n(Ross & Zhang, 2008). A four-item index on engagement in\nleisure activities gauged how often (1 \u00bc never, 3 \u00bc every day)\nrespondents (a) did gardening, (b) read newspapers or\nmagazines, (c) watched television or listened to the radio, and\n(d) played cards or Mah-jongg. I measured exercise in response\nto the question ``Do you exercise at present?'' I measured\nsmoking in response to the question ``Do you smoke at\npresent?'' The answers were coded into yes\u00bc1 and no\u00bc0. The\nmean level of leisure activity engagement was around 1.34.\nApproximately 30% of the sample reported that they exercised,\nand 19% of the respondents smoked.\nRESULTS\nI first examined the sample attrition pattern. A binary\nvariable marked those lost to the second interview and those\nwho either were available for the second interview or had died.\nI then applied logistic regression to regress this binary outcome\non the Wave 1 measures. Findings revealed that the sample\nattrition did not occur in a random manner: Participants who\nurban residents, and highly educated. However, religious\nparticipation and the proposed mediators did not predict the\nloss of sample. This kept enough variability in religious\nparticipation in the remaining sample and facilitated the follow-\nup analyses on the effects of religious participation on\nmortality.\nI then applied Cox proportional hazards models to estimate\nmortality risk depending on religious participation and control,\nmediating, and moderating factors. Model 1 tested the religion\u00ad\nmortality association, adjusting for demographics and health\nstatus when appropriate. In Models 2 through 4, I added\npsychosocial mediators to see how much they could account for\nthe religion\u00admortality association. I examined moderating\neffects by creating cross-product terms between religion and\ngender, and health status, with each cross-product term entering\nthe main effects model separately.\nUpon examination of the whole sample (N \u00bc 6,747; data not\nshown), the hazard ratio (HR) in the first model suggested that\nreligious participation was significantly related to a lower risk\nExercise and engagement were significant mediators, sub-\nstantially reducing the significance level of religion (HR\u00bc0.92,\np \u00bc .16). Adding the cross-product terms into the final model\n(Model 4) suggested that the interaction effects for gender\nwere moderately to strongly significant.\nTo provide more insight into the moderating effects,\nI divided the sample into four subgroups: women, men,\nindividuals in poor health, and individuals in good health. For\neach subgroup, I applied the same modeling strategies. Table 1\npresents the hazard rate ratios from the Cox proportional\nhazards models for women and for individuals in poor health.\nFor women, participating in religious activities significantly\nreduced the mortality risk over and above controls for\nof mediating effects suggested that respondents who engaged\nlittle in exercise or other leisure activities were at an increased\nrisk for mortality. By adding these mediators into Models 3 and\n4, I found that the effects of religion diminished somewhat\n(HR\u00bc0.87, p\u00bc.054). I found similar patterns for individuals in\npoor health (see the right-hand side of Table 1): Religious\nparticipation significantly reduced their mortality risk over and\ncontrast, religious participation had no significant effects for\nmen or for individuals in good health (data not shown). These\nresults suggest that religious participation in China has\nsignificant and sizeable direct and indirect effects on mortality\nfor women and for individuals in poor health.\nDISCUSSION\nFocusing on oldest old people in China, this study advances\nprior research by specifically examining the contingent effects\nof religion on mortality. I found that the impact of religious\nparticipation on the reduction of mortality was more salient for\nsocioeconomically disadvantaged groups such as women and\nindividuals in poor health who have fewer alternative resources.\nThis implies resource compensation rather than amplification:\nResources can substitute for one another to decrease the risk of\nmortality. The effect of having a specific resource is greater for\nthose who have fewer alternatives. Religion not only helps\npeople who are healthy to avoid illness but favorably alters the\ncourse of illness among those who are already ill.\nIn addition, the religion\u00admortality mediators exhibited\nunique features in China: A substantial portion of religious\neffect on mortality was mediated by health behaviors rather than\nby psychological resources such as optimism and autonomy.\nThis indicates the dialectic nature of Eastern religions, which\ndo not necessarily lead to positive psychological status as do\nWestern religions. These findings suggest that religious partic-\nipation in China might help older Chinese develop healthy\nlifestyles, stimulate social engagement, and thus reduce mortality\nrisk. Not only do individuals participate in religious activities,\nthey also help to produce them; by doing so, they greatly enhance\ntheir health and well-being (Musick et al., 2004).\nThe results of this investigation are intriguing; however,\nmuch remains to be explored. The first priority is measurement\nimprovement. Future research should examine the content of\nreligion and spirituality practice or beliefs rather than treat them\nas social or demographic components such as simple measures\nof education or income. For example, the measure of religious\nparticipation needs to be further decomposed to identify the\nprecise facet of religion that is responsible for the health-\nprotective effects. Does it reflect public attendance (similar to\norganizational participation in the United States) or private\nreligious practice (such as praying at home)? Although my\nfollow-up in-depth interviews in China suggested both, more\nwell-developed survey questions gauging multiple features\nof religiousness are greatly needed. In addition, more waves\nof data covering a longer period of time, as well as more com-\nprehensive samples covering younger generations, are likewise\nimperative. In this study, approximately 23% of the sample was\nlost due to item nonresponse. This high rate indicates the\ngeneral low levels of education among oldest old Chinese. By\nsampling younger generations with more years of schooling,\nfuture researchers will likely overcome this problem.\n"
