Introduction\nThe health of the brain and the health of the body are inextricably intertwined [1,2]. A growing\nnumber of studies have linked various aspects of cognitive functioning to behaviors that promote and\nmaintain physical health, including adequate physical exercise [1,3,4] and nutrition [2,5,6]. Research\nsuggests that aerobic exercise in particular facilitates the development of executive functions and\nlanguage abilities in children [4,7] and a host of other cognitive functions in young, middle-aged, and\nolder adults [3,8]. A sedentary lifestyle, on the contrary, increases the likelihood of verbal, motor, and\nintellectual impairment [9,10]. Nutritional factors seem to play an equally important role in neurocognitive\nhealth. A healthy diet, for instance, appears to optimize cognitive performance on verbal, visuospatial,\nand memory tasks among various age groups [11\u00ad13]. Individuals who are exposed to poor and/or\ninadequate nutrition, however, are at risk of exhibiting deficits in neurocognitive functioning [14,15].\nThus, it appears that efforts to sustain healthy eating and exercise behaviors correspond to enhanced\nbrain health across the lifespan.\nAlthough studies have linked nutritional and fitness factors to numerous cognitive functions,\nonly a small number of these studies have examined adolescent samples [11,16]. As Hoyland and\ncolleagues [17] noted in their review of the literature, research examining the influence of eating\nand exercise habits during adolescence on subsequent cognitive functioning is particularly sparse.\nThe literature has instead focused almost entirely on the benefits of physical activity and nutrition for\nbrain health during childhood [4,6,15] and late adulthood [1,18,19]. Nevertheless, recent research has\nsuggested healthy eating and exercise habits during the teenage years can improve concentration,\nas well as verbal and reasoning ability [20]. Scholars have also generally overlooked the possibility that\ngenetic factors might confound the link between health behaviors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity) and\nvarious cognitive functions. In an effort to address these limitations in the literature, the current study\nutilizes a sample of twins to explore whether: (a) nutritional and exercise factors during adolescence are\npredictive of verbal intelligence during early adulthood and (b) such effects remain significant after\naccounting for shared genetic and environmental factors.\n1.1. The Link between Nutrition and Verbal Intelligence\nBoth the sufficiency and the quality of nutrition can influence cognitive functioning at various\nlife stages [5,14,15,21]. A number of studies have indicated that foods rich in antioxidants, long-chain\nfatty acids, and other essential vitamins support brain functioning in multiple ways, including,\nbut not limited to, the synthesis of neurotransmitters [22], the reduction of metal ions [22],\nand the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor [2]. One aspect of neurocognitive functioning\nthat has been repeatedly emphasized in the literature is verbal intelligence [13,14].\nResearchers have paid particular attention to early childhood nutrition as a predictor of verbal\nintelligence [6,13,23], in large part due to the particular sensitivity of the brain during childhood [24].\nIn general, studies examining the influence of childhood nutrition on verbal intelligence reveal\na recent study by Liu and colleagues [25] indicated that kindergarten children who ate breakfast regularly\nscored higher on tests of verbal intelligence than children who only ate breakfast sporadically. Studies\nusing more comprehensive measures of diet quality appear to yield analogous results. For instance,\nresearch has found that toddlers with higher scores on a comprehensive eating assessment (i.e., toddlers\nwith healthier eating patterns) score higher on a picture vocabulary test\n(i.e., PPVT) at age 10 [13]. Similar results were garnered by Gale et al. [12], who reported that healthier\ndietary habits during the first year of life, including higher fruit and vegetable consumption, were\npredictive of verbal intelligence at age 4.\nDespite a general emphasis on infant and child nutrition, a number of studies employing adult samples\nhave also found significant associations between diet quality and verbal fluency/comprehension [21,27].\nFor instance, P\u00e9neau and colleagues [21] studied a sample of 2533 French adults, aged 45\u00ad60 at baseline,\nand found the regular intake of fruits and vegetables, especially those rich in vitamins C and E,\nto be significantly associated with verbal memory 13 years later. Another recent study found that,\neven after accounting for SES and child IQ, elderly subjects who consumed a \"Mediterranean\" diet (i.e.,\ngreater consumption of vegetables, beans, oil/vinegar dressings, fish, and poultry) were more likely to\nevince higher verbal intelligence than subjects with other dietary patterns [27].\nThus, it appears that nutritional factors can have long-lasting effects on various dimensions of\nverbal intelligence, including fluency and comprehension.\n1.2. The Link between Physical Activity and Verbal Intelligence\nIn addition to the literature linking nutrition and verbal intelligence, significant associations between\nindicators of physical activity and verbal intelligence have also been detected [1,3,4,8,10,19]. In general,\nthis body of research mirrors the findings of the nutrition literature: participation in regular exercise is\nassociated with greater verbal aptitude. Again, most of the research examines child or adult samples and\ngenerally neglects adolescents. To illustrate, a study by Scudder and colleagues [4] revealed that children\nat a higher physical fitness level exhibited heightened processing of semantic information and sensitivity\nto syntactic violations when reading sentences. The results suggest that adequate physical fitness can\nhave important implications for developing better language skills, including a more comprehensive\nvocabulary. A recent meta-analysis of 59 studies from 1947\u00ad2009 revealed that physical activity during\nchildhood has a significant, positive effect on various cognitive functions, including reading and\nlanguage ability [28].\nStudies exploring the link between physical activity and verbal intelligence during middle and late\nadulthood detect a similar pattern [1,3,10,19]. A number of these studies suggest that, even after a\nrelatively short intervention period, regular aerobic exercise can lead to improvements in verbal\nintelligence [3,19]. For example, a recent study found that, following a 12-week intervention involving\nregular participation in a \"Spinning\" exercise group, previously sedentary adults displayed significant\nimprovements in semantic verbal fluency relative to controls (15% vs. 2% increase) [3].\nLong-term exercise patterns also seem to influence verbal ability. A study by Benedict and colleagues [1]\nused brain imagining technology and self-report methodology to test the relationship between exercise\nhabits and various cognitive skills in older adults. The results indicate that adults who engaged in a\nhigher number of 30-min exercise sessions per week exhibited a larger brain volume, high white matter\ndensity, and greater verbal fluency. Despite the research highlighting the association between physical\nactivity and verbal intelligence, studies comparing the effects of exercise on verbal ability across adults\nof different ages are lacking. Still, a recent study of a large sample of adults explored the link between\nphysical activity and fluid cognitive ability across age groups and found that the youngest group (aged\n20\u00ad24) derived the most cognitive benefits from exercise [8]. When it comes to the link between adult\nexercise and cognition, therefore, it seems that earlier involvement in physical activity is preferable.\n1.3. The Current Study\nWhether examining physical activity or dietary patterns, very few researchers have studied the\ninfluence of adolescent health behaviors on verbal intelligence, but see [11,16,20]. The handful of studies\nthat have examined this relationship at this stage of the life course, however, suggest that nutrition and\nexercise still play a significant role in verbal capacity [11,16]. In addition to the paucity of literature\nusing adolescent samples, virtually all of the research to date that has examined the interconnections\nbetween diet, physical activity, and verbal intelligence has failed to use a research design that is\ngenetically informative, but see [29]. Although research by Luciano and colleagues [29] revealed that\ndiet, exercise and various components of intelligence are influenced by similar genetic factors,\nresearchers have yet to test the extent to which diet and physical exercise have an environmentally-\nmediated effects that are independent of genetic and familial/shared environmental factors. In an effort\nto expand upon the findings linking health behaviors to verbal ability, the current study employs a sample\nof adolescent twin pairs to test whether differences in their diet and exercise habits predict differences\nin their verbal intelligence during early adulthood, controlling for shared environmental and genetic\ninfluences.\nData for the current study come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health). The Add Health is a large, nationally representative study of American youth [30].\nThe first wave of data collection began in the 1994\u00ad1995 school year and the most recent wave of data\ncollection occurred in 2008. In total, four waves of data have been collected, covering approximately 14\nyears of development across adolescence and adulthood. At the first wave of data collection,\nover 90,000 youth participated in surveys that included questions about an array of behaviors as well as\nfamily and peer relationships. Additional details about a subsample of youth were garnered through\nparent and youth interviews, as well as through direct assessment of their cognitive abilities\n(e.g., language, memory). Specifically, 20,745 adolescents and 17,700 of their primary caregivers were\ninterviewed at wave 1.\nThe Add Health sample is particularly useful for the agenda of the current study, as it contains a large\nnumber of siblings. At the first wave of data collection, the interviewed subsample of youth were asked\nwhether they currently lived with co-twin, full siblings, half sibling, or cousin. If the youth answered in\nthe affirmative, and their sibling was between the ages of 11 and 20, then their sibling was recruited for\nthe study. Moreover, a probability sample of additional pairs of full siblings are also included within the\nAdd Health data [31], resulting in a total subsample of approximately 5500 siblings at wave 1. Research\nto date suggests that this subsample resembles the full adolescent sample on a number of behavioral and\ndemographic indicators [32,33], intimating the utility and generalizability of the sibling subsample. For\nreasons to be outlined, the current study utilizes a subsample of monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic\n(DZ) twins who participated in waves 2 and 3 of the data collection. Although 490 twin pairs (or 980\ntwins) were initially eligible for inclusion, some twin pairs were of undetermined zygosity and/or were\nmissing data, resulting in final analytical samples that ranged from N = 644 twins to N = 694 twins.\nVerbal Intelligence. At wave 3 of data collection, when the majority of respondents were between the\nages of 18 and 24, Add Health researchers measured the verbal abilities of each subject by employing\nan abridged version of the commonly used Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) known as the\nPicture Vocabulary Test (PVT). The assessment involved a process in which the interviewer would read\na word aloud while showing four distinct illustrations to the participant. Subjects were asked to select\nthe illustration that most accurately reflected the meaning of the word for additional information on the\nImportantly, the reliability and validity of the PPVT as a measure of verbal intelligence has been\nbuttressed by prior research [35]. Scores on the PPVT are also highly correlated with scores on other\ncognitive batteries [36,37], which bolsters the construct validity of the measure. Included in the\nAdd Health data are the wave 3 PVT percentile scores, which provide an indication of each subject's\nverbal intelligence by calculating the percentage of subjects in the full Add Health sample with lower\nscores on the PVT at wave 3. We chose to utilize these percentile scores in the current study,\nas they provide a clear indication, in intuitive measurement units, of the verbal intelligence of each\nparticipant at wave 3. Table 1 includes the descriptive statistics of the verbal intelligence measure as\nwell as all other variables and scales relevant to the analysis.\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics of the MZ and same-sex DZ twin subsample.\nVariable Mean Standard Deviation Range\nTable 1. Cont.\nVariable Mean Standard Deviation Range\nFast Food Consumption. We tapped both food quality and food sufficiency by creating three\nmeasures of nutritional inadequacy (i.e., nutritional risk factors) based on several items from the second\nwave of data collection, when the vast majority of subjects were still adolescents. The first of these items\nconcerns fast food consumption. We followed the lead of prior research [38] and created a measure of\nfast food consumption using an item from the second wave of data collection. This item inquired about\nthe frequency of fast food consumption during the previous week. Examples of fast food were given\nduring the interview, such as McDonald's, Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut, in order to avoid\nmisclassification. Response options for this item ranged from 0 (zero days during the previous week) to\n7 (every day during the previous week).\nLow Vegetable Consumption. In addition to our measure of fast food consumption, we created a\nsecond indicator of poor food quality that tapped infrequent vegetable consumption. During wave 2 of\ndata collection, respondents were asked a number of specific questions regarding their eating habits.\nIn particular, 12 questions were employed to determine whether respondents ate a number of different\nvegetables the day prior to the interview, including broccoli, carrots, kale, spinach, cabbage, squash, and\ngreen beans. We followed the lead of prior research [39] and utilized these questions in the creation of\nthis item. Response options for each item were binary, including 0 (did not eat yesterday) and 1 (ate\nyesterday). The final measure was created so that all respondents who indicated that they did not eat any of\nthe vegetables asked about in the questions were coded as a 1, whereas respondents who reported eating\nany of the vegetables during the previous day were coded as a 0.\nMeal Deprivation. In addition to two measures of poor food quality, we created a measure of meal\ndeprivation. In an effort to determine whether each subject was consuming an adequate amount of food,\nwe created an item that measured how frequently subjects were failing to eat regular meals during their\nadolescent years. At wave 2, participants were asked three questions about the number of days during\nthe past week in which they ate specific meals: one question about breakfast, one about lunch, and one\nabout dinner. Each question had response options ranging from 0 (zero days) to 7 (seven days). Scores\non these items were reverse coded so that higher scores indicated a greater tendency to skip that particular\nmeal (e.g., breakfast). A composite measure was created in order to determine the overall extent of meal\ndeprivation across all meals. This measure was created by summing together the scores on the\nreverse-coded items and then dividing by the total possible number of meals reported (i.e., 21) in order\nto yield the proportion of meals that were not eaten during the previous week. Scores closer to 1 on this\nitem indicate a greater degree of meal deprivation, whereas scores closer to zero indicate more regular\nconsumption of meals.\n2.2.3. Physical Activity Measures\nLow Sports Involvement. A number of questions regarding different kinds of physical fitness/activity\nwere asked of adolescent respondents at the second wave of data collection, including how frequently\nthe subject participated in an active sport during the week prior to the interview. Subjects were asked,\n\"During the past week, how many times did you play an active sport, such as baseball, softball,\nbasketball, soccer, swimming, or football\"? Response options included not at all (0), 1 to 2 times (1),\n3 to 4 times (2), and 5 or more times (3). The item was reverse-coded so that respondents who\nparticipated in sports less frequently received higher scores.\nLow Cycling/Skating. A wave 2, respondents were also asked how many times during the past week\nthey participated in roller-blading, roller-skating, skateboarding, or bicycling. Response options for this\nitem also ranged from 0 (not at all) to 3 (5 or more times). The item was reverse-coded in order to reflect\nlow levels of cycling/skating.\nLow General Exercise. Finally, subjects were also asked, \"During the past week, how many times did\nyou exercise, such as jogging, walking, doing karate, jump roping, doing gymnastics or dancing\"?\nResponses options were coded in the same manner as the previous physical activity measures.\nInsufficient Exercise. In an effort to identify those participants who failed to engage in an adequate\namount of exercise during the previous week, regardless of type, we created a general measure of\ninsufficient exercise using the three exercise measures listed above. Following the lead of Ornelas,\nPerreira, and Ayala [40], we created a binary measure of insufficient exercise in which respondents who\nparticipated in less than five bouts of physical activity a week, regardless of type, were assigned a value\nof 1, whereas respondents who participated in five or more bouts of physical exercise a week, regardless\nof type, were assigned a value of 0. The cut-off point was used in an effort to approximate the\nrecommended amount of exercise advocated by the American Heart Association as well as the Center\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, which is that individuals participate in five exercise sessions a week,\nlasting at least 30 min (a total of 150 min or more). Although we could not ascertain the actual number\nof minutes of exercise each participant engaged in, the number of exercise sessions gives us a close\napproximation as to whether or not the subject is engaging in a sufficient or insufficient amount of\nphysical activity.\n2.3. Plan of Analysis\nThe analysis for the current study will be carried out using a technique known as Defries-Fulker (DF)\nanalysis. DF analysis is a regression-based method that is capable of providing specific estimates of the\nrelative effects of genetic factors, shared environmental factors, and nonshared environmental factors.\nThese estimates are obtained by using samples of sibling pairs who differ in their degree of genetic\nsimilarity (e.g., MZ and same-sex DZ twins). DF analysis decomposes the variance in the outcome\nvariable into the proportions explained by genetic and environmental factors, while also allowing for the\nestimation of regression coefficients for specified nonshared environments (i.e., environments that are\nnot shared by siblings within a kinship pair). We chose to employ DF analysis in order to ensure that\nany associations between nutritional factors, fitness factors and verbal intelligence are not spurious due\nto genetic influences. The current genetically informed analysis is an effort to determine whether the\npurported link between diet, physical activity and verbal intelligence is environmentally transmitted or\nspurious due to unmeasured genetic influences.\nThe DF equation has been revised since it was originally postulated by DeFries and Fulker [41,42] in\norder to be fit for use among samples drawn from the general population [43]. The revised equation is\ndepicted as follows:\nIn this equation, K1\nrepresents the PVT percentile score (i.e., the outcome variable) for one of\nthe twins being analyzed, K2\nrepresents their co-twins PVT percentile score, R is an indicator of\nthe genetic similarity between the kinship pair (1 for MZ twin pairs and 0.5 for DZ twin pairs),\nand R \u00d7 K2\nis an interaction term that multiplies the co-twin's PVT percentile score by their degree of\ngenetic similarity with their twin. Moreover, b0\nrepresents the constant, b1\nrepresents the proportion of\nthe variance in verbal ability that is explained by shared environmental influences, b2\nis not interpreted\nin the DF model, and b3\nis the proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence that is explained by genetic\ninfluences. The error term (e) encompasses the effects of the nonshared environment on verbal\nintelligence and error.\nRecently, Rodgers and Kohler [44] proposed an improvement to Equation (1) that only slightly alters\nits form. The new equation is depicted as follows:\n\u00ad Km\n- Km\n)] + e (2)\nIn this equation, K1\n, R and e have the same significance as they do in Equation (1).\nHowever, this equation includes the term Km\n, which represents the mean value of K2\n(or, in this study,\nthe mean verbal intelligence score for the co-twins). Therefore, the parenthetical statement K2\n\u00ad Km\nsignifies that K2\nis mean-centered in this equation. Just as was the case in Equation (1), b0\nrepresents the\nconstant and b1\nrepresents the proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence that is explained by shared\nenvironmental influences. However, in this updated equation, b2\n(instead of b3\n) is interpreted as the\nproportion of the variance in verbal intelligence that is explained by genetic influences.\nThe coefficients in the above equation do not tell us the effect of any particular gene or shared\nenvironment on verbal intelligence precisely because the coefficients signify latent factors. Nevertheless,\nEquation (2) can be altered slightly to allow for the inclusion of specific nonshared environments of\ninterest. In the current study, we make use of the following equation in order to examine a number of\nnonshared environments related to nutrition and exercise, in an effort to determine whether these factors\nhave a significant influence on verbal intelligence, net of genetic and shared environmental factors.\nThe DF equation that allows researchers to include specific nonshared sources of variance is depicted\nas follows:\n\u00ad Km\n- Km\nENVDIF + e (3)\nEquation (3) is almost an exact replication of Equation (2). The only difference is the term ENVDIF.\nENVDIF represents the difference score that is created when one twin's score on a variable is subtracted\nfrom their co-twin's score on the same variable. In the current study, difference scores are calculated for\neach of the nutrition and physical activity variables in order to determine if sibling differences in these\nvariables predict differences in verbal intelligence, net of genetic and shared environmental influences.\nImportantly, b3\nin Equation (3) does not represent a latent factor, but instead represents a regression\ncoefficient, and needs to be interpreted as such (e.g., using critical t-values, p-values, etc.).\nA series of DF models were estimated in the present study. The first model employs the baseline DF\nequation (Equation (2)) in order to ascertain the proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence that is\ndue to genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental factors. Subsequent models employ\nthe formula displayed in Equation (3), which allows us to introduce the nutrition and exercise variables\nas nonshared sources of variance by including them as difference scores (ENVDIF) in the equation.\nThe goal of these analyses is to determine whether differences between the twins in diet and physical\nactivity significantly contribute to differences in their verbal scores, independent of genetic and shared\nenvironmental influences.\nIn order to maximize the information available on twin pairs in the Add Health, and in line with prior\nresearch [45\u00ad47], twins were double entered. Double-entering allows for each twin to be both the\nindependent and dependent variables in the DF analysis. Despite this advantage, double entering violates\nthe assumption of the independence of observations (since the same observations are repeated twice).\nViolation of this assumption results in deflated standard errors, which biases tests of statistical\nsignificance. We corrected for this in our study by employing Huber-White standard errors, which allows\nus to take account of the clustering of observations when estimating the statistical significance of\nthe results.\n3. Results\nTable 2 displays the results of the DF models examining the influence of the shared environment,\nheritability, and adolescent nutritional factors on verbal intelligence during early adulthood.\nModel 1 of Table 2 contains the results of the baseline model, which identifies no specific nonshared\nsources of variance and only estimates the proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence\ndue to heritability and the shared environment. The results of model 1 indicate that shared environmental\nfactors explain approximately 44% of the variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood, while\n27% of the variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood is due to genetic factors (in both cases,\np < 0.05). From these results, we can deduce that a combination of the nonshared environment and error\naccount for the remaining 29% of the variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood.\nAlthough model 1 allows us to estimate the relative influence of genes, the shared environment,\nand the nonshared environment, it does not estimate the effects of any specific genetic or environmental\nsource of variance. Models 2 through 5, however, extend model 1 by including one or more of the\nnutritional factors as nonshared sources of variance. Model 2 includes all three measures of\npoor/inadequate nutrition in the DF equation simultaneously, whereas Models 3 through 5 include only\none nonshared source of variance at a time. The results across models 2 through 5, however,\npaint a similar picture: twins who do not practice adequate nutrition during adolescence evince\nsignificantly poorer verbal intelligence during adulthood, net of shared environmental and genetic\ninfluences. Specifically, fast food consumption, low vegetable consumption, and meal deprivation\nduring adolescence all result in statistically significant reductions in verbal intelligence by adulthood,\neven after accounting for the effects of genes and the shared environment on verbal intelligence.\nTable 2. DF analysis of the shared environment, heritability, and adolescent nutritional factors\nas predictors of verbal intelligence during early adulthood verbal intelligence (wave 3).\nb SE b SE b SE b SE b SE\nDF Analysis Components\nShared\nEnvironment\nNonshared Sources of Variance\nFast Food\nConsumption\nLow Vegetable\nConsumption\n**\nMeal\nDeprivation\nThe coefficients for the nonshared sources of variance can be interpreted just as OLS regression\ncoefficients are interpreted, realizing, however, that the unit of analysis is twin pairs (not individuals).\nFor example, in the current analysis, the coefficients represent the average increase in verbal intelligence\n(measured as a percentile score) for every one-unit increase in the nonshared source of variance, relative\nto one's twin. In the case of low vegetable consumption, which is a binary variable, the results suggest\nthat, within twin pairs, the twin with lower vegetable consumption tends to score lower on verbal\nintelligence during early adulthood. More specifically, in cases where twins within a pair are discordant\nin terms of their vegetable consumption during adolescence, the twin with lower vegetable consumption\nwill, on average, score 4.34 percentile points lower on verbal intelligence during early adulthood relative\nto their co-twin, even after taking genes and the shared environment into account.\nSimilar results are obtained in the case of meal deprivation, where going from no meal deprivation to\nabsolute meal deprivation is predicted to result in a 7.46 to 8.10 percentile-point decrease in verbal\nintelligence, net of genetic and shared environmental factors. Furthermore, model 2 predicts that adding\nan additional day of fast food consumption per week relative to a co-twin will result in an almost full\npercentile point drop in relative verbal intelligence. Thus, when taken as a whole, the results of the\nmodels displayed in table two suggest a significant influence of adolescent nutritional factors on adult\nverbal intelligence.\nTable 3 is presented in the same format as Table 2, except for the inclusion of an additional model\ndue to a greater number of nonshared sources of variance being examined. Model 1 represents the\nbaseline model, whereas models 2 through 6 introduce nonshared sources of variance related to physical\nfitness during adolescence.\nTable 3.

To be precise, models 2 and 6\nsuggest that, even after accounting for genetic and shared sources of variance, twins who failed to engage\nin sufficient exercise during adolescence scored between 3.72 and 4.11 percentile points lower on adult\nverbal intelligence than co-twins who engaged in regular exercise during adolescence. Nevertheless,\nincremental reductions in particular forms of physical activity (e.g., sports, cycling) did not appear to\nresult in significantly lower verbal intelligence by early adulthood (A sensitivity analysis that included\nall nutrition and exercise variables in the same DF model was also conducted. The results revealed that\nboth high fast food consumption and low vegetable consumption significantly reduce verbal ability\nscores during early adulthood. However, in this full model, none of the exercise items predicted verbal\nability scores, suggesting that the effect of exercise on verbal ability does not remain once nutritional\nfactors are accounted for).\n4. Discussion\nBehavioral patterns relating to physical activity and diet have been shown to influence various\ncognitive functions, including verbal intelligence [1,3\u00ad6]. Research exploring the influence of adolescent\nnutritional and exercise habits on subsequent verbal intelligence, however, has been very limited, for\nexceptions, see [11,16,20]. Moreover, even fewer studies have accounted for the possibility that genetic\nfactors might explain, at least in part, the link between diet, exercise, and verbal skills, but see [29]. The\nmain objective of the current study was to address these voids in the literature by testing whether various\nnutritional and exercise differences between co-twins during their adolescent years predict differences\nin their verbal intelligence during early adulthood, net of genetic and shared environmental influences.\nThe results of our study revealed three key findings.\nFirst, our results indicated that both shared environmental factors and genetic factors explain a\nsignificant portion of the variance in verbal intelligence. To be precise, approximately 44% of the\nvariance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood was attributable to shared environmental factors,\nwhereas 27% of the variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood was attributable to genetic\nfactors. These results also inform us that the remaining portion of the variance (i.e., 29%) can be\nattributed to nonshared environmental influences and error. Prior research has often detected a higher\ndegree of genetic influence on verbal ability as one progress from childhood to early adolescence [48].\nIn young adult samples, heritability typically remains quite high, which differs from the relatively\nmodest estimate in the present study [49]. Nevertheless, the findings underscore the utility of genetically-\ninformed designs in highlighting the relative contribution of genes, the shared environment, and the\nnonshared environment. Furthermore, the inclusion of the heritability and shared environment\ncoefficients in subsequent models exploring the link between nutrition, physical activity, and verbal\nintelligence assures us that the significant associations detected are robust to both shared environmental\nand genetic influences.\nSecond, the results revealed that poor nutrition during adolescence corresponds to a significant\ndecrease in verbal intelligence during early adulthood, even after accounting for genetic and shared\nenvironmental factors. In particular, when twins were discordant in their eating habits, the average verbal\nintelligence score for twins with poorer nutrition was significant lower than the verbal intelligence score\nof their cotwins. These results held across multiple measures of nutrition, including fast food\nconsumption, low vegetable consumption, and meal deprivation.\nThird, we found that youth who did not engage in a sufficient amount of exercise were more likely\nto display lower verbal intelligence during early adulthood. Specifically, relative to their physically\nactive co-twins, twins who were more sedentary during adolescence showed inferior verbal intelligence\nduring early adulthood. We found no evidence, however, that small reductions in the frequency of\nspecific forms of physical activity (e.g., 3 days a week to 2 days a week) resulted in lower verbal\nintelligence during early adulthood. In the case of adolescent exercise, therefore, significant reductions\nin adult verbal intelligence do not seem to emerge until respondents drop below a particular threshold of\nphysical activity (i.e., five exercise sessions a week).\n5. Conclusions\nThe current study is, to our knowledge, the first to provide a genetically informed test of the\nrelationship between adolescent health behaviors (i.e., diet and physical activity) and verbal intelligence\nduring adulthood. Despite the unique contribution of the study, it is not without its limitations. First, we\nwould have preferred the operationalization of our key independent variables to be more precise. For\nexample, our measure of insufficient exercise identifies participants who failed to engage in five or more\nbouts of exercise per week. The exact content of each exercise session (e.g., intensity, length), however,\nis unknown. Such details would likely prove useful in determining the specific features of physical\nactivity during adolescence that are most likely to impact subsequent verbal intelligence. Despite this\nshortcoming, the simplicity of the measurement of some of our key independent variables results in\nresearch implications that are straightforward and practical. For example, our findings regarding low\nvegetable consumption highlight a nutritional change that would be quite easy to implement, as they\nsuggest that eating just one serving of vegetables a day during adolescence can lead to greater verbal\nintelligence during adulthood.\nSecond, a large body of research has linked diet and physical activity to a host of other cognitive\nfunctions apart from verbal intelligence, including perceptual organization, processing speed,\nmemory and visual-spatial skills [1,27]. We would have preferred to have had access to a more\ncomprehensive battery of cognitive assessments at wave 3 in order to test the robustness of our results.\nNevertheless, such data were not available in the Add Health. Finally, our use of a sample of same-sex\ntwin pairs may limit the generalizability of the results. We should note, however, that a recent study by\nBarnes and Boutwell [50] suggests that twin-based research may be more generalizable to the population\nof singletons than previously assumed.\nIn conclusion, while research has repeatedly demonstrated the impact of nutrition and physical\nactivity on the verbal capacity of children and older adults, it appears that specific aspects of brain\ndevelopment and functioning are impacted by diet and exercise choices during the teenage years.\nThe association between these health behaviors and verbal intelligence also seems to exist independent\nof genetic and shared environmental influences, suggesting that relatively simple changes to the diet and\nexercise regime during the adolescent years can have a significant influence on verbal intelligence during\nearly adulthood. Future studies should explore the generalizability of these results to other aspects of\ncognitive functioning. Furthermore, replication of Luciano and colleagues' [29] study is also needed to\nfurther elucidate the extent to which health behaviors and intelligence have shared genetic\nunderpinnings. Finally, scholars should seek to employ more specific measures of nutrition and exercise\n(e.g., vitamin content of food, intensity/duration of exercise session) in an effort to build upon the results\nof the current study. Additional research that seeks to identify the specific dietary and exercise habits of\nyouths that have the greatest impact on brain health will hopefully inform the practical behavioral changes\nduring the adolescent years that can improve life quality during adulthood.\nAuthor Contributions\nDylan B.
