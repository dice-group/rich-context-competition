The purpose of this study was to examine how gender, and ethnic differences in body satisfaction, perceived\nbody appearance and weight status change by age in a representative sample of U.S. adolescents 11\u00ad17 years old.\nMethods: We used the US Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) 2001 survey which assessed perceived\nbody appearance, body satisfaction, self-reported body mass index (BMI) and socio-demographic indicators. The\nassociations between age and perceived appearance, age and body satisfaction, and between z-transformed BMI and\nbody satisfaction were analyzed using separate non-parametric regression models for both genders and the three\nethnic groups.\nResults: Body satisfaction did not vary significantly by age except for an increase with age in the proportion of\nNon-Hispanic White girls who perceived themselves as too fat. Although boys did not report being too fat unless\ntheir BMI was above the age- and gender-specific median, one third of Non-Hispanic White girls felt too fat at or\nbelow the age- and gender-specific median. Compared to other ethnicities, African-American students' perceived\nappearance was significantly more positive and they were less likely to perceive themselves overweight at higher\nBMI scores. However, during adolescence, the positive self-reported perceived appearance of African-American\nboys dropped substantially while it remained relatively stable in African-American girls.\nConclusions: There were substantial differences in body satisfaction and perceived appearance across the three\nlargest ethnic groups of school-age children in the U.S. Stability across age indicates that these perceptions are\nmost likely established before the age of 10 and underline the importance of primary schools and parents in\nprevention. Special attention should be directed to the dramatic loss of positive perceived appearance among\nAfrican-American boys.\nBackground\nConcerns with body weight and physical appearance are\nprevalent among adolescents [1,2] and are part of the\nlarger phenomenon of body image perceptions, which\nrelate to how individuals feel about their bodies [3]. Poor\nbody image is often correlated with increasing body\nweight [4-6] and is linked to adverse outcomes such as\npsychological problems (including depression and low\nesteem) [4], perceived negative physical and mental health\n[7,8] and a higher likelihood of poor dieting and eating\ndisorders, which may be sustained in adulthood [9].\nPoor body image is also a potential mediator of the rela-\ntionship between obesity and psychological distress [4].\nWhile eating disorders generally tend to decline during\nthe transition to early adulthood, poor body image remains\na problem for a substantial segment of the adult popula-\nThere is a large body of evidence addressing the differ-\nences in weight, weight perceptions, satisfaction with weight\nand their links with perceived appearance and attractiveness\nacross ethnic groups in multiethnic populations like those\n* Correspondence: iannottr@mail.nih.gov\n2Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research, Eunice\nKennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,\nBethesda, USA\n3Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2012 Mikolajczyk et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

However, the genesis of these\ndifferences and their development across the age spectrum\nremain insufficiently understood. Large variations in indi-\nviduals' weight and weight perceptions occur throughout\nthe life course and are shaped by multiple factors. New-\nborns of different ethnic backgrounds can differ in their\nbirthweight, based on genetic and phenotypical parental\ndifferences [27,28]. Parental and children's own behaviors\njoin to influence weight and weight perceptions in early\nchildhood and kindergarten years. During the school years,\ninteractions with peers and comparisons with peers may\nbecome the dominating reference system for children's\nevaluations of their weight and their weight perceptions.\nChildren's media consumption also increases during this\nperiod and can contribute to perceptions of weight, appear-\nance and attractiveness [29]. However, the age at which\nperceptions become stable or change is understudied.\nIn this study, our goal was to examine ethnic, sex\nand age differences in body satisfaction and percep-\ntions of physical appearance versus body mass index\n(BMI) among a nationally representative sample of U.S.\nyouth aged 11 to 17 years. The original study over-\nsampled ethnic minorities, so we had a sufficient sample\nsize to examine these relationships among Non-Hispanic\nWhites, African-American and Hispanic youth separately.\nWe hypothesized that a) while body satisfaction and per-\nceptions of physical appearance can be already established\nbefore the bottom end of the here studied age range, there\nwill be substantial changes thereafter (conceptualized as\ndifferences by age), b) females will display stronger age\neffects, c) there will be particularly strong age effects\namong Non-Hispanic Whites.\nMethods\nSample\nThe 2001 Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC)\nwas a collaborative cross-sectional survey involving\n36 countries in coordination with the World Health\nOrganization [30]. The main goals of the survey were\nto assess the prevalence of health behaviors and to\ngain insight into the influence of the social context\non young people's well-being. The present paper ana-\nlyzed data from the HBSC anonymous survey of a\nrepresentative national sample of U.S. students in grades 6\nwas stratified by grade, with public, private and parochial\nschools selected to assure geographic representation and\nrandom selection of classrooms within grades. The sam-\nple was designed to provide estimates of prevalence\nwithin 3 percent at 95 percent confidence with sample\ndesign effects approximately 1.4 times greater than\nthat of a simple random sample. An over-sampling of\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students was included\nto provide better population estimates for these minor-\nities. Five hundred forty-eight schools were selected to\n18,593 eligible students. Parental consent and youth\nassent were required for participation in the survey. Of\nthe eligible students (after eliminating 637 absent on\nthe day of the survey, 600 not providing consent when\nrequired, 518 whose parents declined their child per-\nmission, and 1,620 students declining to participate),\nsample, 62 students who had missing data on a signifi-\ncant number of key items and 365 students who were\noutliers (< 1 percent ) for age in grade were dropped,\nleaving a sample of 14,818. Only those students in\nthree ethnic groups (African-American, Non-Hispanic\nWhites and Hispanics) and who had completed ques-\ntions about body satisfaction and perception of body\nappearance were included in the analysis resulting in\nthe final sample size of 13,267. The Institutional Review\nBoard at the Eunice Kenney Shriver National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development approved the\n2001 survey. Surveys were administered in classrooms\nby the class teacher. Questionnaires were completed an-\nonymously and placed in a sealed envelope to ensure\nconfidentiality.\nVariables\nPerceived appearance\nGeneral body appearance was measured with a single\nquestion: \"Do you think you are . . .?\" with a five-point\nresponse scale: very good looking, quite good looking,\nabout average, not very good looking, not at all good look-\ning. A dichotomous variable was created with `very good\nlooking' versus the four remaining categories.\nBody satisfaction\nBody satisfaction was measured with the question: \"Do\nyou think your body is. . .?\" with a five-point response\nscale: much too thin, a bit too thin, about the right size, a\nbit too fat, much too fat. For the analysis, the variable\nwas dichotomized into too fat (a bit too fat and much\ntoo fat) versus the three remaining categories.\nBody mass index (BMI)\nBMI was obtained from self-reported weight and height.\nBMI was converted into age- (in months) and gender-\nstandardized z-transformed values using values derived\nfrom the NHANES study [31]. Thus the unit of the new\nvariable (BMIZ) is one standard deviation of the BMI\ndistribution. Values within one standard deviation cor-\nrespond to 68% of the original distribution, while values\nwithin 2 units correspond to 95%, and those within 3\nunits to 99.7% of the original distribution. The advantage\nof this conversion is that values of the BMIZ variable can\nbe compared across age and gender.\nDemographic characteristics\nStudents provided demographic information about race/\nethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, Non-Hispanic Black, and Non-\nHispanic White) and date of birth. Age was calculated in\nyears from the date of birth and date of the completion of\nthe questionnaire and rounded to one decimal place. The\nhighest level of education of mother or father reported by\nthe child was used as an index of parent education. The\nFamily Affluence Scale (FAS) assessed the number of\nfamily cars, vacations in the past year, home computers,\nand whether the respondent had his or her own bed-\nroom. Studies indicate the scale has good content valid-\nity and external reliability [32]. Children also indicated\nwhether they lived in an \"urban area (city)\", \"suburban\narea (near a large city)\" or \"rural area (not near a large\ncity).\"\nStatistical analysis\nSample descriptive statistics (demographic characteris-\ntics) were compared across ethnic groups using chi-\nsquare tests. The association between age and perceived\nappearance was analyzed using separate non-parametric\nregression models for both genders and the three ethnic\ngroups. Age was treated as a continuous variable and\nlocally-weighted regression [33,34] was used to assess\nthe form of the association. Locally-weighted regression\nuses data points in the immediate neighborhood to de-\nrive the estimate of the given data point without making\nassumptions about the general form of the association.\nWe used the gam library in R to apply this model. Non-\nparametric regression models were also used to assess\nthe association between age and body satisfaction, and\nbetween z-transformed BMI and body satisfaction. Sig-\nnificance level was set at p < 0.05 for all analyses.\nResults\nDescription of the sample\nGender and age distributions were similar across the\nthree ethnic groups, but the proportion of children from\nhigh-affluent families was much higher in Non-Hispanic\nWhites (Table 1). Parental education was highest in\nNon-Hispanic Whites, followed by African-American and\n(substantially lower) Hispanics. More than half of Non-\nHispanic White adolescents lived in suburban and rural\nareas, while the majority of Hispanic and African-\nAmerican students lived in urban areas. As defined by\nthe 90th percentile of the national age- and gender-specific\nweight standard, Non-Hispanic White boys and girls had\nsubstantially less obesity than boys and girls in the other\ntwo racial/ethnic groups (Table 2). Body appearance\nwas rated highest by African-American boys and girls\n(Table 2). Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics rated\ntheir appearance similarly, but substantially lower than\nAfrican-Americans. Again, the results were similar for\nboth genders. Conversely, Non-Hispanic Whites and\nHispanics indicated dissatisfaction with their body weight\n(being \"too fat\") more often than African-Americans\n(Table 2).\nDifferences in perceived appearance and body satisfaction\nacross age\nThe proportion of children who consider themselves very\ngood looking decreased with age in both genders and all\nthree ethnic groups with the exception of African-American\ngirls (Figure 1). The patterns of change across age did not\ndiffer between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White youths,\nbut was significantly different in African-American youths.\nThere was also an important difference between African-\nAmerican girls and boys: while the proportion of African-\nAmerican girls considering themselves very good looking\nTable 1 Description of the sample by ethnic group (%)a\nVariables Hispanic African-American Non-Hispanic White\nAge\nGender\nFamily Affluence\nParental Education\nUrbanicity\na All comparisons across ethnic groups were significant (p < 0.05).\nfluctuated consistently at a higher level than the other\ngroups, African-American boys experienced a substantial\ndecrease from nearly 60% who considered themselves\ngood-looking at the age of 11 years to around 30% at the\nage of 17. By the age of 17, after this dramatic fall in the\npercent of African-American boys who considered them-\nselves good looking, no differences were observed between\nAfrican-American boys and those from the two other\nmale ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic\nolder adolescent girls displayed an overly pessimistic\nself-perception.\nIn contrast to the perception of appearance, body satis-\nfaction did not differ over the age range studied except\nfor Non-Hispanic White girls (Figure 2). The proportion\nof Non-Hispanic White girls considering themselves too\nfat nearly doubled between 11 and 15 years of age, but\nReported BMI and body satisfaction\nThe proportion of boys who perceive themselves as\ntoo fat started to increase gradually when the reported\nBMI corresponded to the mean value of the sample (0 on\nthe z-transformed scale) (Figure 3 ). At one standard devi-\nation above the mean (which corresponds to a BMI greater\nthan the 84th percentile of the population) approximately\none third of the boys considered themselves too fat. This\nincreased to 70% or more at two standard deviations (a\nBMI greater than approximately 98% of the population).\nNon-Hispanic White and Hispanic boys did not differ in\nthe relationships between weight perceptions and BMI,\nbut African-American boys were less likely to consider\nthemselves too fat at the same BMI percentiles. This ten-\ndency was even stronger among African-American girls;\nhowever among girls there was also a difference between\nNon-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics, with the former\nTable 2 Body perception and body mass index by gender and ethnic background (%)a\nBoys Girls\nVariables Hispanic African-American Non-Hispanic White Hispanic African-American Non-Hispanic White\nBMI\nBMIZ\nBMIZ\nBMIZ\nAppearance\nBody Satisfaction\na All comparisons across ethnic groups were significant (p < 0.05).\nstarting to label themselves as too fat at lower BMI per-\ncentiles. The curves also shifted towards lower BMI values\nfor Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White girls in comparison\nto boys, indicating more weight concerns among girls\nthan boys at the same age- and gender-adjusted BMI\npercentiles.\nThe results were qualitatively similar regarding the com-\nparison between ethnic groups for the `about the right size'\nweight perception category (data not shown). The propor-\ntion of children/adolescents who still considered their\nweight about right when their reported BMI was above the\n90th percentile was highest among African-American boys\nand girls but also substantial among other groups. In com-\nparison, at very low BMI values, large proportions of chil-\ndren in all groups considered themselves about right.\nDiscussion\nWe analyzed a representative sample of U.S. school-\nchildren with respect to body satisfaction and perceived\nappearance. All three assessed ethnic groups displayed\ndistinct characteristics. For Non-Hispanic Whites and\nHispanics, perceptions of body appearance were similar\nfor both genders and across the age spectrum, but\nAfrican-American youths differed substantially from both\nother groups. African-American youths had much better\nperceived body appearance at the youngest age. Perceived\nappearance remained high in African-American girls\nover the age range, but dropped dramatically in African-\nAmerican boys. There was also a non-negligible drop in\npositive perceived appearance among Non-Hispanic White\nand Hispanic girls towards the end of the analyzed age\nBoys\nAge [year]\nAge [year]\n'Very good looking'\nHispanic\nAfrican-American\nNon-Hispanic White\nGirls\nHispanic\nAfrican-American\nNon-Hispanic White\nFigure 1 Proportion of children and adolescents by gender, age and ethnic group who considered themselves to be very good looking\n(locally weighted regression with age treated as continuous variable, point-wise 95% confidence intervals are presented for Hispanics).\nNote: With the exception of the trend for African-American girls, there was a significant negative linear trend for all gender by ethnicity subgroups\nBoys\nAge [year]\n'Too fat'\nAge [year]\n'Too fat'\nHispanic\nAfrican-American\nNon-Hispanic White\nGirls\nHispanic\nAfrican-American\nNon-Hispanic White\nFigure 2 Proportion of children and adolescents by gender, age and ethnic group who considered themselves to be \"much too fat\" or\n\"a bit too fat\" (locally weighted regression with age treated as continuous variable, point-wise 95% confidence intervals are presented\nfor Hispanics).

Only Non-Hispanic White\ngirls exhibited an increase in the proportion considering\nthemselves too fat; the proportion doubled between 11\nand 15 years of age. (In this age group BMI scores also\nincreased among Non-Hispanic White girls.) Conversely,\nperceptions of weight remained stable for all other groups.\nNon-Hispanic White and Hispanic boys had similar per-\nceptions of body weight in relation to their BMI, com-\npared to African-American boys, who were less likely to\nperceive themselves as too fat at higher BMI percentiles.\nGirls in all three ethnic groups considered themselves\nas being too fat at substantially lower age- and gender-\nspecific percentiles of BMI than boys. However, there\nwas a substantial difference across all three ethnic groups,\nwith Non-Hispanic White girls substantially more likely to\nperceive themselves too fat at a given BMI percentile, fol-\nlowed by Hispanics and African-American.\nThe perceived positive appearance in African-American\nboys was exceptionally high at young ages (60% considered\nthemselves being very good looking), but the dramatic\ndrop between 11 to 17 years of age is nevertheless troub-\nling. A longitudinal study in Finland found that percep-\ntions regarding appearance are increasingly fixed with age\nand more stable in boys than girls [35], thus underscoring\nthe importance of the unusual process occurring in\nAfrican-American boys. The drop in perceived positive\nappearance in African-American boys may be associated\nwith increasing environmental awareness, which develops\nduring adolescence and may partially account for the de-\ncrease in self-perception [36]. McCabe and Ricciardelli\n[37] report that, as boys get older, \"they become more\naware of the sociocultural ideal for males, and they\nrecognize that there is pressure to strive not only for a lar-\nger body, but also for a body that demonstrates muscular\nstrength and tone\" (p.676). This could be especially true\nfor African-American boys since research shows that they\nare at greater risk for weight-related concerns and beha-\nviors, as compared to Non-Hispanic Whites [38]. Paradox-\nically, the excessive weight-related concerns among this\ngroup could stem from the disconnect between the larger\nideal body sizes that they strive for [39] and their percep-\ntion that they are not big enough.\nAfrican-American girls showed high self-perception at\nthe age of 11, and sustained it across all of the ages stud-\nied. In contrast, there was a substantial loss of positive\nself-perception among Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic\ngirls towards the end of the studied age spectrum. There is\nevidence that the negative relationship between BMI and\nperceived physical appearance is greater in Non-Hispanic\nWhite girls ages 9 to 14, compared to African American\ngirls [6]. There is also research indicating that body sizes\npresented in the media differ by ethnicity and thus media\ncan influence perceived appearance across ethnic groups\nin different intensity [40]. Therefore, the observed effects\namong girls could be either linked to the increase of BMI\nor to the increased exposure to the media.\nIn all but Non-Hispanic White girls, proportions of\nchildren perceiving themselves as too fat did not differ\nby age in the studied range (11 to 17 years). In earlier\nstudies, pre-adolescents have been excluded from stud-\nies on body image because it was thought that these\nissues mostly affect adolescents [41,42]. However, our\nfindings agree with more recent studies that challenge\nthis perspective and suggest that body image concerns\nare increasingly affecting pre-adolescents [43]. The percent-\nage of Non-Hispanic White girls who considered them-\nselves much too fat or a bit too fat increased between 11\nyears. This differential effect may be the result of different\nsocio-cultural factors such as the media, peers, and parents\nBoys\n'Too fat'\n'Too fat'\nHispanic\nAfrican-American\nNon-Hispanic White\nGirls\nFigure 3 Fraction of children or adolescents considering themselves \"too fat\" by reported BMI (z-transformed, see methods), gender\nand ethnic group (locally weighted regression with z-transformed BMI treated as continuous variable, point-wise 95% confidence\nintervals are presented for Hispanics as gray solid lines). Note: z-BMI is z-transformed BMI; y-axis indicates the proportion of those responding\n\"too fat\" among all children of the given BMI.\n[44]. These results are consistent with findings that\nAfrican-American and Hispanic females respond differ-\nently to Non-Hispanic White media images than their\nNon-Hispanic White counterparts, and possibly reject the\nimplicit beauty and social pressure to match this \"thin\"\nideal, which Non-Hispanic White girls internalize [45-47].\nAfrican-American and Hispanic girls may also perceive\nthat their peers and parents have less weight concerns and\nlarger ideal body sizes compared to their Non-Hispanic\nis needed to explain the stabilization of body perception\nfrom 15 to 17 years of age for Non-Hispanic White girls,\none possible explanation may be that social comparisons\nand cultural expectations have already been internalized\nby age 15 [36]. Our analysis also demonstrated that the\nproportion of boys with a perception of being much too\nfat or a bit too fat did not change with age, which corrobo-\nrates previous studies that socio-cultural factors perpetu-\nate the muscular body ideal for males [50].\nEarly research on body satisfaction problems focused\nmainly on girls [51]; recently more attention has been paid\ncate that while concerns regarding overweight are more\nfrequent among girls, a substantial proportion of boys also\nconsidered their weight as too high. In addition, our find-\nings indicate a higher proportion of boys considered them-\nselves to be too thin. This may be another reflection of the\nmuscular ideal which is more evident in boys [50]. Similar\nto women's internalization of the culturally ideal thin body,\nmen may be susceptible to internalizing a muscular ideal\nfrom the media [52].\nAlthough African-American girls had the highest age-\nand gender-specific BMI compared to other ethnic groups\nand African-American boys had substantially higher BMI\nthan Non-Hispanic White boys (and only slightly lower\nthan Hispanic boys), African-American boys and girls were\nmore tolerant than Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics\nregarding the BMI z-score at which they considered them-\nselves too fat. This finding is consistent with a large body of\nliterature indicating different ideals of body attractiveness\nness of overweight among African-Americans [5,33,55].\nThe finding is double-edged: On the one hand, there is\nsubstantial evidence that obesity increases multiple health\nrisks; greater weight concerns can support weight loss\nbehavior or the maintenance of a low body weight,\nthereby subsequently reducing health risks associated\nwith obesity. On the other hand, weight concerns can\naffect physical and psychological well-being or even mis-\ndirect weight-loss strategies [4,5,56]. These findings call\nfor balanced strategies to promote healthy weight per-\nception, with messages framed differently for each eth-\nnic group. While addressing media pressure can be of\nutmost importance for Non-Hispanic White girls [40],\nnutritional and physical activity interventions can be more\nimportant for other groups [15,57]. For Hispanic adoles-\ncents the issue of acculturation was also raised, which add-\nitionally complicates the relationship between body\nperception and appearance [58,59] Addressing the links\nbetween poor body image and eating disorders might re-\nquire psychosocial interventions as suggested by the re-\nLimitations\nThis study is based on cross-sectional data, while its main\ninterest is in changes across age. However, it is unlikely\nthat there are cohort effects across such a narrow age\nrange. Despite previous research on the stability of body\nimage perceptions, we do not know how stable these per-\nceptions are within individuals over shorter time periods.\nWhile one might think that body weight perceptions do\nnot change from day to day, perceived appearance could\nbe affected by concurrent social interactions. The mea-\nsures related to perception were subjective per se, but BMI\ncould have been objectively measured. Instead we had to\nrely on BMI calculated from self reported weight and\nheight. Previous research indicated the self-reported BMI\ncorrelates well with measured BMI, in a way which can be\nsufficient for studies of associations [60-63]. Nevertheless,\nself-reported BMI may be systematically biased not only\nfor the population, but even more within specific sub-\ngroups, but is an adequate measure if no other possibilities\nWith the exception of the three groups studied, our\nsample of other ethnic groups was too small for reliable\nestimates of effects. Furthermore, information about BMI\nwas missing for a substantial fraction of students. While\nmissing information might simply reflect that the child\ndoes not know his/her current weight, it could also indi-\ncate that he/she is not as occupied with the issue of body\nweight. Therefore, excluding children with missing self-\nreported BMI might have resulted in a sample of children\nmore concerned with their weight.\nWhen calculating standardized BMI values we used a\ncommon standard for all three ethnic groups and did not\nask what respondents considered the reference for their\nweight. This ignores the fact that the own ethnic group\ncan be the reference for body image and thus individual\nperceptions of overweight can be based on ethnic-specific\nstandards.\nWhile dichotomizing variables we had to accept some\nloss of information, but at the same time applying ANOVA\nwould violate assumptions of normal data distribution. We\nalso contrasted the highest values with the remaining\nvalues, in this way we focused on the upper end of the\nspectrum of responses and did not report the findings for\nthose with negative body appearance.\nConclusions\nThere are substantial differences in perceived appearance\nand body satisfaction across the three largest ethnic\ngroups of school-age children in the U.S.: While Non-\nHispanic Whites and Hispanics have similar perceptions\nabout body image, both groups differ from African-\nAmericans. For many adolescents perceived appearance\nand body satisfaction are most likely established before\nthe age of 10, with little change during adolescence. Since\nboth perceptions are potentially related to weight pro-\nblems and poor health, their early stability underlines the\nimportance of primary schools and parents in prevention.\nSpecial attention should be targeted to the dramatic loss of\npositive perceived appearance among African-American\nboys in the analyzed age spectrum. It is also important\nto note the rather negative self-perception among Non-\nHispanic White and Hispanic girls, especially towards\nthe upper end of the age spectrum.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by the intramural research program of the\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human\nDevelopment and by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health\nResources and Services Administration.\nAuthor details\n1Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Bremen Institute for Prevention\nResearch and Social Medicine, Bremen, Germany. 2Division of Epidemiology,\nStatistics and Prevention Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute\nof Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, USA. 3Eunice Kennedy\nShriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 6100\nAuthors' contributions\nConception and design of the study: RTM.
