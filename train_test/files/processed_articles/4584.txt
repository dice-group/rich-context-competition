The design of the study\nwas reviewed and approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of the Catholic\nUniversity of Korea, College of Medicine\nobtained from all patients according to the\nAct on Legal Codes for Biomedical Ethics\nand Safety and the Declaration of Helsinki.\nHuman gingiva-derived stem cells were\nisolated and cultivated in accordance with\nthe procedure described in a previous study\nby one of the authors.6 The gingival tissues\nwere collected and contained in sterile\nphosphate-buffered saline (Welgene, Inc.,\nGyeongsan-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea)\nthat included 100 U/mL penicillin and\n100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich\nCo., St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4C. The\ntissues were de-epithelialized, separated into\npore filter, and modified in alpha minimum\nessential medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher\nScientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) con-\ntaining dispase (1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich\nCo.) and collagenase type IV (2 mg/mL;\nThe cell suspension was filtered with a\n70-mm cell strainer (Falcon; BD\nBiosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA),\nand the cells were incubated at 37C in a\nhumidified incubator with 5% CO2\nhours, the nonadherent cells were washed\nwith phosphate-buffered saline and replaced\nwith fresh media every 3 to 4 days.\nCells were plated onto a 100-mm dish\nand cultured in a growth medium including\nalpha minimum essential medium (Gibco),\nascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), fetal\nbovine serum (Gibco), L-glutamine\n(Sigma-Aldrich Co.), penicillin, and strepto-\nmycin (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Dexamethasone\n(Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was dissolved in 95%\nethanol to a concentration of 2 \u00c2 10\u00c03 M\n(stock solution). The cells were then treated\nwith a final concentration of 10\u00c07 M dexa-\nmethasone and the same concentration of\nvehicle control (95% ethanol) for 2 and\n24 hours. The doses of dexamethasone and\nthe time points used in the present study\nwere based on those used in previously\nTotal RNA extraction\nThe human gingiva-derived stem cells were\nharvested at 2 and 24 hours.

Briefly, each 2 mg of total RNA\nwas prepared and incubated with magnetic\nbeads decorated with oligo-dT, and other\nRNAs (excluding mRNA) were then\nremoved with a washing solution. Library\nproduction was initiated by the random\nhybridization of starter/stopper heterodi-\nmers to the poly(A) RNA still bound to\nthe magnetic beads. These starter/stopper\nheterodimers contained linker sequences\ncompatible with Illumina (San Diego, CA,\nUSA). A single-tube reverse transcription\nand ligation reaction extends the starter to\nthe next hybridized heterodimer, where the\nnewly synthesized cDNA insert is ligated to\nthe stopper. Second-strand synthesis is per-\nformed to release the library from the beads,\nand the library is then amplified. Barcodes\nwere introduced when the library was\namplified. High-throughput sequencing\nwas performed as paired-end 100-base-pair\nRNA-Seq reads were mapped using the\nTop Hat software tool (Toronto, ON,\nCanada) to obtain the alignment file. The\nalignment file was used to assemble tran-\nscripts, estimate their abundances, and\ndetect differential expressions of genes or\nisoforms using cufflinks. Gene classification\nwas based on searches performed using the\nBioCarta (http://www.biocarta.com/),\nGenMAPP (http://www.genmapp.org/),\nDAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/),\nand Medline databases (http://www.ncbi.\nnlm.nih.gov/).\nGene ontology and pathway analysis\nGene ontology analysis was performed and\nincluded osteoblast differentiation, bone\nremodeling, and Wnt signaling. P values\nwere used to denote significance of gene\nontology term enrichment (P < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant).\nPathway analysis was also performed for\ndifferentially expressed genes based on the\nPATHWAY database of the Kyoto\nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.\nA fold change of 1.3 was applied in this\nstudy, and a log2 normalized read count of\n!4 was applied to minimize false counts.\nA P value of <0.05 was considered statis-\ntically significant.\nQuantification by real-time\npolymerase chain reaction\nTotal RNA was isolated from cultured cells\nusing GeneJET RNA Purification kit\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and\nreverse-transcribed. The sense and antisense\nprimers were designed based on GenBank.\nPrimer sequences were as follows: RUNX2\nGTG GGA TGT GG-30; b-catenin Forward\nGGA CCA GA-30; and b-actin Forward\nGAAGCA-30. b-actin served as a housekeep-\ning gene for normalization. The expression of\nmRNA was detected by real-time polymerase\nchain reaction (RT-PCR) using SYBR Green\nReal-Time PCR Master Mixes (Enzynomics,\nDaejeon, Korea) according to the manufac-\nturer's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR\nexperiments were repeated three times.\nWestern blot analysis\nCells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis and\nextraction buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nInc.) according to the manufacturer's proto-\ncols. Whole cell lysates were quantified using\nthe BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nInc.). Protein samples were loaded and then\ntransferred for immunoblotting. The mem-\nbranes were incubated with the following\nprimary antibodies overnight at 4C: anti-\nRUNX2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,\nUK), anti-b-catenin (BD Biosciences, San\nJose, CA, USA), or anti-GAPDH antibody\n(Abcam). After washing, membranes were\nincubated with secondary antibody (Abcam)\nfor 1 hour at room temperature.\nData analysis\nmRNA-Seq reads were mapped using Top\nHat software to obtain the alignment file.\nDifferentially expressed genes were deter-\nmined based on counts from unique and\nmultiple alignments using EdgeR within R\nversion 3.2.2 (R development Core Team,\n(Gentleman et al., 2004). The alignment file\nwas also used to assemble transcripts, esti-\nmate their abundances, and detect differen-\ntial expression of genes or isoforms using\ncufflinks. We calculated the fragments per\nkilobase of exon per million fragments to\ndetermine the expression level of the gene\nregions. Global normalization was used\nfor comparison between samples. Gene\nclassification was based on searches done\nby DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).\nThe data are represented as mean \u00c6 stand-\nard deviation of the experiments. Either\nStudent's t-test or a two-way analysis of\nvariance with a post-hoc test was performed\nto determine the differences between the\ngroups using a commercially available pro-\ngram (SPSS 12 for Windows; SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA).

We focused especially on\nosteoblast differentiation (fold change of\n1.3, log2 normalized read count of !4 to\nminimize false counts, P < 0.05) (Table 1\nand Figure 3). First, we assessed the effect of\nincubation time on the stem cells.\nComparison of the controls at 24 versus 2\nhours revealed that 16 mRNAs were upre-\ngulated and 26 were downregulated.\nComparison of the dexamethasone group\nat 24 versus 2 hours revealed that 9 mRNAs\nwere upregulated and 37 were downregu-\nlated. Comparison of the data in both\ngroups at 24 versus 2 hours showed that 4\ngenes were upregulated and 17 genes were\ndownregulated. The four genes that were\nupregulated were TWIST1, BMP4, BGLAP,\ndownregulated were FHL2, GTPBP4,\nSOX8. However, two genes (ESR1 and\nACHE) showed opposite trends.\nNext, we assessed the effect of dexa-\nmethasone. Comparison of the dexametha-\nsone and control groups at 2 hours showed\nthat 7 mRNAs were upregulated and\n25mRNAs were downregulated. Comparison\nof the dexamethasone and control groups\nat 24 hours revealed that 6 mRNAs\nwere upregulated and 31 mRNAs were\ndownregulated. In both groups, 1 gene\n(BGLAP) was upregulated and 11 genes\nWWOX, and SPP1) were downregulated.\nHowever, four genes (ESR1, IGFBP5,\nLGR4, and ACHE) showed opposite\ntrends. Expression of RUNX2 was decreased\nin the dexamethasone group at 24 hours.\nDecreased expression of CTNNB1 (for\nb-catenin expression) was also noted in\nthe dexamethasone group at 24 hours\n(Figure 4).\nValidation of mRNA expression\nQuantitative RT-PCR revealed that the\nmRNA levels of RUNX2 and b-catenin\nwere lower at 24 than at 2 hours (Figure 5).\nThis change was more significant in the\ndexamethasone group at 24 hours.\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blot analysis was performed to\ndetect protein expression following treat-\nment with dexamethasone at 2 and 24 hours\ncompared with the untreated group at 2 and\n24 hours.

The immediate\neffects of dexamethasone were evaluated\nusing the 2-hour results, and the more sus-\ntained effects were evaluated by using the\n24-hour results. More pronounced effects\nwere observed at 24 hours because of the\ncumulative effects of dexamethasone. Short-\nterm, high-dose dexamethasone reportedly\npredisposes patients to complicated fracture\nunion, especially patients with angle frac-\ntures.27 However, long-term physiologic\nconcentrations of dexamethasone resulted in\nmore intense staining for alkaline phosphat-\nase in human bone-derived cells.28\nFigure 2.

Previously, mRNA expression was\nmeasured by microarray methods or RT-\nPCR techniques.32 These techniques are\nlimited to the detection of known transcripts\nand have a limited capacity to differentiate\nbetween transcript variants.33 Although\nRNA sequencing is still a technology under\nactive development, it offers several advan-\ntages over existing technologies, including\ndetermination of all coding and non-coding\nregions; additionally, it is a popular method\nfor genome analysis.20,34 Notably, however,\ngenes with low expression abundance might\nWestern blot analysis was performed to\ndetect the protein expression of RUNX2\nand b-catenin and provide information\nregarding possible mechanisms. Canonical\nWnt/b-catenin signaling pathways are\nreportedly crucial for the osteoblastic lin-\neage.36 Wnt signaling suppresses mesenchy-\nmal stem cell commitment to the\nchondrogenic and adipogenic lineages and\nenhances the osteoblastic lineage, and both\nRUNX2 and b-catenin are major regulators\nof this signaling.37 RUNX2 regulates a\ncomplex gene-regulatory network during\nosteoblastogenesis and upregulates various\nosteoblast lineage-specific genes.38 One\nstudy revealed that RUNX2-targeting\nmiRNAs might be essential to ensure\nthat the RUNX2 level is attenuated at\nkey stages of osteoblast lineage progression\nto accommodate the biological functions\nof RUNX2 in mesenchymal cell-fate\nFigure 3.
