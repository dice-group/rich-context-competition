Too often, however, it\nis dismissed as benign, and other forms of child aggression,\nsuch as peer aggression, are considered more serious. Peer\naggression is linked to poorer mental health.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Using a national probability sample, we\nshow that the nature and severity of sibling aggression have\nnegative links to children's and adolescents' mental health. We\ndemonstrate that sibling and peer aggression are comparable\ntheir links to symptoms of distress.\nabstract\nOBJECTIVE: Sibling aggression is common but often dismissed as\nbenign. We examine whether being a victim of various forms of sibling\naggression is associated with children's and adolescents' mental\nhealth distress. We also contrast the consequences of sibling versus\npeer aggression for children's and adolescents' mental health.\nMETHODS: We analyzed a national probability sample (n = 3599) that\nincluded telephone interviews about past year victimizations con-\nducted with youth aged 10 to 17 or an adult caregiver concerning\nchildren aged 0 to 9.\nRESULTS: Children ages 0 to 9 and youth ages 10 to 17 who experienced\nsibling aggression in the past year (ie, psychological, property, mild or\nsevere physical assault), reported greater mental health distress. Chil-\ndren ages 0 to 9 showed greater mental health distress than did youth\naged 10 to 17 in the case of mild physical assault, but they did not differ\nfor the other types of sibling aggression. Comparison of sibling versus\npeer aggression generally showed that sibling and peer aggression\nindependently and uniquely predicted worsened mental health.\nCONCLUSIONS: The possible importance of sibling aggression for\nchildren's and adolescents' mental health should not be dismissed.\nThe mobilization to prevent and stop peer victimization and bullying\nshould expand to encompass sibling aggression as well.

Such a re-\nsponse reflects the historical accep-\ntance by researchers and the general\npublic of sibling aggression as benign\nand normal1 and even beneficial for\ntheir children's social development and\ntheir ability to handle aggression in\nother relationships.2 As such, sibling\naggression remains an unrecognized\nform of violence,3 even though similar\naggressive behavior among peers is\nperceived as problematic.4,5 Victims of\npeer aggression report poorer mental\nhealth, including greater depression\nand anxiety.6,7 Findings from the few\nsmall studies of sibling aggression,\nwhich are typically conducted with\nconvenience samples and limited to\nthe assessment of physical assault,\nalso show its occurrence is linked with\npoorer mental health.8,9\nIn the current study, using a national\nprobabilitysample,weexaminedwhether\nbeing a victim of sibling aggression is\nassociated with children's and adoles-\ncents' mental health. In doing so, we\nprovide a comprehensive picture of the\nlinks between sibling aggression and\nmental health through our examination\nof 3 subtypes of sibling aggression:\nphysical assault, property victimiza-\ntion, and psychological aggression by\na sibling. Our analyses also addressed\nthe importance of severity and fre-\nquency of sibling aggression for men-\ntal health. We compared levels of\ndistress symptoms for those who did\nor did not experience more mild forms\nof physical assault (without a weapon\nor resulting injury), as well as for those\nwho did and did not report being the\nvictim of more severe forms of physical\nassault: those involving a weapon or\ncausing injury. We also compared the\nmental health of children and adoles-\ncents who experienced either none, 1,\nor 2 or more types of sibling aggres-\nsion. We hypothesized that child and\nadolescent victims of each type of sib-\nling aggression would report greater\nmental distress than those who did not\nexperience sibling victimization. Also,\nwe expected that experiencing more\ntypes of sibling victimization would be\nlinked to greater mental health dis-\ntress.\nThe rate of sibling aggression is at\nthe severity of sibling aggression\npeaks in adolescence when the highest\nrates of injury and weapon use are\nif the linksbetween sibling aggression\nand mentalhealth differ for children\nversus adolescents despite variation in\nthe frequency and severity of sibling\naggression. Finally, to address the as-\nsumption that sibling aggression is less\nserious than peer aggression,13 we\ncompared sibling versus peer aggres-\nsion links to children's and adolescents'\nmental health, expecting that sibling\naggression would have unique and\nsimilar associations with mental health,\nbecause in both cases, the experience\ninvolves child-to-child aggression.12\nMETHODS\nThedataarefromTheNationalSurveyof\nChildren's Exposure to Violence, which\nwas designed to obtain incidence and\nprevalence estimates of a wide range\nof childhood victimizations.14 A nation-\nwide sampling frame of residential\ntelephone numbers from which a sam-\nple of telephone households was\ndrawn by random digit dialing was\ncreated. To ensure that the study in-\ncluded a sizeable proportion of mi-\nnorities and low-income respondents\nfor more accurate subgroup analyses,\nthere was an oversampling of US tele-\nphone exchanges that had a population\nof 70% or more of African American,\nHispanic, or low-income households.\nchildren aged 1 month to 17 years who\nhad at least 1 sibling younger than 18\nliving in the household at the time\nof the interview. The interviews with\nparents and youth were conducted\nover the phone by the employees of a\nsurvey research firm. Telephone inter-\nviews are commonly used to gather\ninformation about violence and vic-\ntimizations (eg, US Department of\nJustice's National Crime Victimization\nSurvey) and have been shown to be\ncomparably reliable and valid to in-\nperson interviews.15\nSample weights were applied to adjust\nfor differential probability of selection\nbecause of study design, demographic\nvariations in nonresponse, and varia-\ntions in within-household eligibility. The\nsample was approximately evenly di-\nvided across gender (51% male) and\nage. In terms of ethnicity, 63% of the\nchildren and youth were white and non-\nHispanic followed by 18% Hispanic, any\nrace; 13% black, non-Hispanic; and 6%\nother race, non-Hispanic. Most of the\nsample was from 2-parent households\nForty-six percent of parents had a\nbachelor's degree (versus 27% with\nsome college and 27% with a high\nschool degree or less).\nTheadultcaregiver(usuallyaparent)in\neach household provided family de-\nmographic information. One child was\nrandomly selected from all eligible chil-\ndren living in a household by selecting\nthe child with the most recent birthday.\ncompleted the telephone interview via\nself-report. For selected children youn-\nger than 10, the caregiver who \"is most\nfamiliar with the child's daily routine and\nexperiences\" completed the interview. A\nsafety protocol was implemented to en-\nsure confidentiality of responses and\nprivacy during the interview.\nRespondents were paid $20 for their\nparticipation. The interviews were\nconducted in both English and Spanish\nand averaged 45 minutes in length. Al-\nwere interviewed in English. Respond-\nents who disclosed a situation of seri-\nous threat or ongoing victimization\nwere recontacted by a research team\nclinical member trained in telephone\ncrisis counseling whose responsibility\nwas to stay in contact with the re-\nspondent until the situation was re-\nsolved. Respondents who refused to\nparticipate (or could not be reached),\nbut for whom parent screener in-\nformation was obtained, were not sys-\ntematically different from respondents\non victimization risk.\nSibling and Peer Aggression\nSibling and peer aggression were\nassessed via items from an enhanced\nversion of the Juvenile Victimization\nQuestionnaire (JVQ).16 The enhanced\nJVQ obtained reports on 48 types of\nyouth victimization covering 5 general\nareas of interest: conventional crime,\nmaltreatment, victimization by peers\nand siblings, sexual victimization, and\nwitnessing and indirect victimization.17\nFollow-up questions gathered addi-\ntional information about each victimi-\nzation, including characteristics of the\nperpetrator, whether the event oc-\ncurred in the past year, and whether\na weapon was used or injury resulted.\nReports by caregivers versus children\nyounger than 10 for this measure have\nshown to be comparable.16\nWe constructed measures to capture\nthe range and extent of sibling-\nperpetrated aggression. The constructed\nmeasures count only those experiences\nthat occurred in the past year and that\nwere perpetrated by a juvenile sibling\nresiding in the same household as\nthe interviewed child. Two of the di-\nchotomous measures pertain to physi-\ncal aggression by a sibling: physical\nassault with no object/weapon or injury\nand physical assault involving an object/\nweapon or causing injury. One dichot-\nomous measure assesses sibling prop-\nerty aggression (force used to take\nsomethingaway from childthat the child\nwas carrying or wearing; something\nstolen from child and never given back;\nand child's things broken or ruined on\npurpose). Another dichotomous mea-\nsure captured whether the child had\nexperienced psychological aggression\nby a sibling (child felt bad or scared\nbecause a sibling was \"calling him/her\nnames, saying mean things, or saying\nthey didn't want him/her around\"). The\nquestions for property and psychologi-\ncal victimization were asked only of\nchildren aged 2 years and older. Addi-\ntional variables were created based on\nthe combination of the above variables\nto assess the extent of experiencing\ndifferent types of sibling aggression. To\ndo so, we created variables based on\na count of the number of sibling victim-\nization types experienced by children\nand adolescents over the past year. Al-\nthough we were unable to assess the\nfrequency with which each type of sib-\nling victimization occurred over the\npast year with the available data, we\nbelieve our data are likely to provide\nunique and perhaps more reliable in-\nformation than the typical retrospective\nmeasures of frequency of episodes.12\nThese variables included (1) sibling\nphysical aggression (if the child or ad-\nolescent experienced either of the 2\nsubtypes of sibling physical aggression\n(a dichotomous variable); (2) total types\nof sibling aggression, which is summed\nacross the 4 types of sibling aggression\n(a continuous variable); (3) None versus\n1 experience of sibling aggression\nsummed across the 4 types (a di-\nchotomous variable); and (4) 1 versus 2\nor more experiences of sibling aggres-\nsion summed across the 4 types (a di-\nchotomous variable). Measures were\nalso constructed for past-year victim-\nizations perpetrated by nonsibling peers\nusing the same process and criteria: (1)\npeer physical aggression (includes\nwhether the child was hit, beaten, or\nattacked with or without an object and\nwhether injury resulted); (2) peer\nproperty aggression; (3) peer psycho-\nlogical aggression; and (4) total types of\npeer aggression.\nMental Health\nChildren's and adolescents' mental\nhealth was assessed by 2 closely re-\nlated measures: the Trauma Symptom\nChecklist for Young Children,18 which\nwas used in the caregiver interviews\nfor children 9 years and younger, and\nthe Trauma Symptoms Checklist for\nChildren,19 which was used with the\nreport interviews. Reporters indicated\nhow often they (or their children) ex-\nperienced items in the anger, depres-\nsion, and anxiety scales from each\nmeasure in the past month on a 4-point\nscale (0 = not at all to 4 = very often).\nCronbach's a for the Trauma Symptom\nChecklist for Young Children was 0.86\n(28 items) and for the Trauma Symp-\ntoms Checklist for Children was 0.93\n(25 items). Because these measures\nare often and generally used in their\nonly in global mental health, we cre-\nated a total mental health distress\nscore. The item wording, however, dif-\nfered for the 2 measures so the total\nscore for the sample was created by\nsumming the anger, depression, and\nanxiety scales of each measure and\nthen standardizing and merging the\nstandardized mental health scores for\neach age group. Higher scores indicate\ngreater mental health distress.\nDemographic Characteristics\nDemographic measures included in\nthese analyses were the following:\nchild's gender; child's age (coded into 2\nchild's race/ethnicity (coded into 4\ngroups: white non-Hispanic; Hispanic\nany race; black non-Hispanic; and other\nrace, non-Hispanic); and parent ed-\nucation for parent with the most edu-\ncation (high school or less, some\nARTICLE\ncollege, or college graduate). Finally,\na variable was constructed to indicate\nwhether the parent interview was\nconducted in Spanish (0 = no; 1 = yes).\nRESULTS\nAnalyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were\nconducted to assess whether there are\ndistress symptom score differences for\nchildren and adolescents who did ver-\nsus did not experience each type of\nsibling aggression in the past year. The\nANCOVAs controlled for parent educa-\ntion level, ethnicity, language of the in-\nterview, and child gender. Also, to limit\nany confounds because of the impact\nof other types of victimizations,24 we\ncontrolled for participants' past year\nexperiences of nonsibling assault, non-\nsibling property victimization, nonsib-\nling psychological victimization child\nmaltreatment,sexualvictimization,school\nand Internet victimization, and witness-\ning family and community violence\ncollected as part of the JVQ measure.\nBecause of developmental differences\nin the frequency of sibling aggression11\nand to test if there were age differ-\nences in the links between sibling\naggression and mental health, an in-\nteraction term between sibling aggres-\nsion type and age (childhood versus\nadolescence) was included in each of\nthe models.\nThe ANCOVA models for the 2 sibling\nphysical assault variables were signif-\nsibling physical assault with a weapon\n.001 for sibling physical assault with\nno weapon or resulting injury). Main\neffects in each model showed that\nchildren and adolescents who experi-\nenced a sibling assault of either type\n(with or without a weapon and/or\nresulting injury) reported higher dis-\ntress symptom scores (see Fig 1) than\nthose who did not experience any\nsibling assault. In the model that\nincluded physical assault with no\nweapon or resulting injury, the age in-\nP = 0.01), indicating that mental\nhealth differences between those who\nreported experiencing this type of sib-\nling aggression and those who did not\nwas greater in children than in ado-\nfor adolescents).

The results revealed that chil-\ndren and adolescent sibling victims\nreported greater distress than those\nchildren and adolescents who were not\nvictims of property or psychological\naggression (see Table 1). The inter-\naction terms with age were non-\nsignificant. In sum, all types of sibling\naggression, both mild and severe, were\nassociated with significantly higher\ndistress symptom scores for both chil-\ndren and adolescents.\nNext,weexploredwhetherexperiencing\nmultipletypesofsiblingaggressionwas\nassociated with increased distress\nscores.

Multiple re-\ngression was used to analyze total\ntypes of sibling aggression types and\ntotal types of peer aggression types as\npredictor variables. ANCOVAs and mul-\ntiple regression analyses controlled\nfor parent education level; ethnicity;\nlanguage of the interview; child age;\nchild gender; participants' past year\nexperiences of child maltreatment;\nsexual, school, and Internet victimiza-\ntion; and witnessing family and com-\nmunity violence, and included Sibling 3\nPeer interaction terms for each type of\naggression to test whether children's\nand adolescents' mental health varied\ndepending on whether they experi-\nenced sibling and peer aggression\nsingly or in combination. All 3 ANCOVA\nmodels were significant with sibling and\npeer aggression, making independent\nand unique contributions to children's\nand adolescents' mental health in 2 of\nthe models. The model for property\naggression was the 1 exception in\nwhich peer but not sibling aggression\nwas a significant predictor. Also, there\nwas a significant Sibling 3 Peer phys-\nical aggression interaction term, and\nfollow-up Tukey tests showed signifi-\ncant differences across all possible\ncombinations. This meant that children\nand adolescents who had experienced\nboth sibling and peer physical ag-\ngression in the past year reported\nhigher levels of distress than those\nwho experienced peer aggression or\nsibling aggression alone (see Table 2).\nThe interaction terms for the models\nexploring property and psychological\naggression were not significant. The\nregression model examining the rela-\ntive effects of total types of sibling ag-\ngression and total types of peer\n=\nrevealed that those children and ado-\nlescents who were the victims of\na greater number of sibling and peer\naggression types had greater mental\nhealth distress. The interaction term\nwas nonsignificant, suggesting that\nchildren's and adolescents' mental\nhealth did not differ depending on\nwhether they experienced total types of\nsibling and peeraggression singly or in\ncombination.\nDISCUSSION\nUsing a national probability sample, we\nshowed that past-year sibling aggres-\nsion was associated with significantly\nworse children's and adolescents'\nmental health. This connection was\nevident for both mild and severe forms\nof sibling aggression and for those who\nhad experienced just 1 as well as\nmultiple types of sibling aggression in\nthe past year. Although mental health\ndistress was greater for children than\nfor adolescents who experienced mild\nsibling physical assault, children and\nadolescents were similarly affected by\nother forms of sibling aggression. Al-\nthough peer aggression is generally\nperceived as being more serious than\nsibling aggression,13 our analyses\nshowed that sibling and peer physical\nand psychological aggression had in-\ndependent effects on mental health\nand that the mental health of those\nexperiencing sibling versus peer\nproperty and psychological aggression\ndid not differ. Our work adds to the\nlimited literature on sibling aggression\ngenerally characterized by small, non-\nrepresentative samples.8,9 Our nation-\nally representative study also removed\nthe confounding influence of other\nkinds of victimization exposure and to\nassess the effects of multiple types of\nsibling aggression. Thus, we were able\nTABLE 2 Multiple Regression Predicting\nChildren's and Adolescents' Mental\nHealth\nVariable b SE\nParent education (ref: high\nschool degree)\nEthnicity (ref: white)\nLanguage of interview\n(ref: English)\nChild age (ref: 0\u00ad9 y)\nChild gender (ref: female)\nTotal types of sibling\nvictimization\nTotal types of peer\nvictimization\nTotal sibling 3 peer\ntypes of victimization\nARTICLE\nto show the damaging effects of sev-\neral forms of sibling aggression,\nindependent of other co-occurring vic-\ntimizations. Another important strength\nof our study is that it included in-\nformation about sibling aggression\nfrom early childhood through late ad-\nolescence. Although many national\nstudies do not include young children\nbecause they may not be able to ef-\nfectively answer questions, our proxy\ninterviews with caregivers of children\nyounger than 10 years provide data\notherwise unattainable. A possible\nlimitation of such data, however, is that\nyounger children's information may be\nincomplete because caregivers may\nnot be able to provide a full inventory\nof sibling aggression exposures. How-\never, caregiver and children's reports\non our measure of victimization have\nbeen shown to be comparable.16 An-\nother limitation of our work is that we\nwere unable to determine the direction\nof effects between aggression and\nmental health.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTaken together, our study shows that\nsibling aggression is not benign for\nchildrenandadolescents,regardlessof\nhow severe or frequent. An implication\nof our work is that parents, pedia-\ntricians, and the public should treat\nsibling aggression as potentially\nharmful and something not to be\ndismissed as normal, minor, or even\nbeneficial. Besides communicating\nthis message directly to parents\nduring pediatric visits, another ave-\nnue to disseminate this message\nwould be to have popular parent ed-\nucation programs (eg, Triple P Posi-\ntive Parenting Program) to include\na greater focus on sibling aggression\nand successful mediation of sibling\nconflicts.25 An important next step is\nto gather longitudinal data to further\nexamine the implications of various\npatterns of sibling aggression experi-\nences for mental health and whether\nthese patterns vary by birth order and\ngender.\nREFERENCES\n1.
