We sought to identify the cir-\ncumstances and relationships that place children at in-\ncreased risk for violent death to support the develop-\nment of targeted violence prevention interventions. Our\nprimary hypotheses were that relationships of female ho-\nmicide victims to offenders are different than relation-\nships of male victims to offenders; victim and offender\nrelationships differ depending on victim age; victims in\nlarger cities and towns would more likely be killed by a\nstranger; and victims killed by strangers are more likely\nto be killed with handguns than other weapons.\nMETHODS\nThis study analyzed data from the Inter-University Consor-\ntium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, Mich. The\nspecific data set used was the Uniform Crime Reports (United\nStates): Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), 1976-\n1999.8 The Inter-University Consortium for Political and So-\ncial Research obtained the data from the Federal Bureau of In-\nvestigation.\nThe SHR contain data on every homicide within the juris-\ndiction of voluntarily participating police departments. Forms\nare completed monthly as part of the Uniform Crime Report-\ning Program.9 National coverage is approximately 92%,8 but the\nmissing 8% of data is not uniform over space and time.10 Ad-\nditionally, there is no updating of data to reflect subsequent\nThe SHR contain incident-level information on criminal ho-\nmicides8 including month and year of the offense, county, and\nmetropolitan statistical area (MSA) codes. The MSAs are areas\n\"containing a recognized population nucleus and adjacent com-\nmunities that have a high degree of integration with that\nAdditional variables collected include the population of the ho-\nmicide location; geographic regions; age, race, and sex of vic-\ntims and offenders; victim-offender relationships; weapons; and\nhomicide circumstances (other type of crime, if any, commit-\nted during the homicide).\nTwo data sets accompany the SHR. This study examined the\n1999, which contains information on the victim of the homi-\ncide and the first perpetrator listed in the SHR. (Even if there\nwere multiple offenders, only the first perpetrator is listed.) If\nthere are multiple victims of a homicide, all victims and their\nrelationships to offenders are listed.\nThis study included all intentional and nonnegligent ho-\nmicides. Negligent manslaughters and justifiable homicides (as\ndefined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation) were ex-\ncluded. The data set was narrowed to include victims younger\nthan 20 years. Next, data were recoded to simplify the rela-\ntionships between victims and offenders. Relationships char-\nacterized as intimate partners are spouse, ex-spouse, common-\nlaw spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend, and homosexual relationship.10\nThe SHR did not have a category for ex-boyfriend or ex-\ngirlfriend, who are characterized as intimate partners by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention,12 leading to an un-\nderreporting of intimate partners in the SHR where these re-\nlationships have been characterized as acquaintances. Family\nmembers are defined as mothers, fathers, stepmothers, stepfa-\nthers, in-laws, brothers, sisters, stepbrothers, stepsisters, sons,\ndaughters, stepsons, stepdaughters, and other family. \"Other\nknown\" encompasses neighbors, acquaintances, employees, em-\nployers, friends, and others known. All odds ratios are calcu-\nlated using strangers as the referent group.\nAnalysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social\nSciences for Windows, version 11.5.0.13 Bivariate analysis was\naccomplished using 2 for nominal variables, t tests for nor-\nmally distributed variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test for or-\ndinal variables or continuous variables with skewed distribu-\ntions.Becauseoftheobservationalnatureofthedata,multivariate\nmodels were used to adjust for potential confounders. Vari-\nables found to be significant in bivariate analysis and those be-\nlieved to be confounders a priori were included in the final mul-\ntinomial logistic regression models. The variables included year\nthe homicide occurred, season of the homicide, sex of the vic-\ntim, age of the victim, race of the victim, MSA, and census di-\nvision.Interactiontermswereexaminedand,ifsignificant,placed\nin these models. Final results are given as odds ratios with strang-\ners as the referent group.\nLimitations include some states' incomplete data due to non-\nadherence to Uniform Crime Reports definitions for crimes or\nthe hierarchy of crimes and other states' nonadherence to the\nNational Incident-Based Reporting Systems methodology.10\nThirty-seven victims had no sex recorded. Because of this small\nnumber, they were eliminated from the analysis. In addition,\nbecause negligent manslaughters and justifiable homicides are\nexcluded from the database, the actual numbers and rates of\nchildren killed by firearms cannot be inferred.\nThe variable most often missing was the victim-offender re-\nlationship. Reasons for this included: the crime was not wit-\nnessed and therefore a relationship could not be determined,\nor the homicide was not solved and therefore the relationship\nwas unknown. Data were first analyzed excluding all victims\nmissing offender data. Next, we examined the data imputing\nthe missing relationship using the methods described herein.\nRates were not calculated for this data set because of the large\namount of missing data, a lack of adherence to the Uniform\nCrime Reports definitions, and unreliability of intercensus popu-\nlation estimations.\nWhen a relatively large number of observations are miss-\ning information on 1 or more of the variables in the model, a\ncomplete data analysis in which these observations are dis-\ncarded can lead to bias. Imputation allows the creation of a com-\nplete data set by replacing missing values with values that are\nimputed from an initial set of assumptions. Multiple imputa-\ntion procedures account for the sampling variability in the im-\nputation procedure by using Monte Carlo methods to repeat-\nedly create imputed data sets.\nIn this study, the relationship was missing 29% of the time.\nVictims missing relationship data were compared with vic-\ntims who had relationship data. The peak in homicides oc-\ncurred in 1993 in both groups, and there were no differences\nin the seasonality of homicides in either group. Victims for whom\nthe relationship was not recorded were 1 year younger, killed\nin larger cities or towns, more likely to be African American,\nmore frequently killed by handguns, and had a slightly higher\nmale preponderance.\nBecause of these differences, multiple imputation tech-\nniques were used to reanalyze these data. A multinomial model\nwith a Dirichlet prior distribution to estimate the probability\nof observing each pattern of the study variables was used.14 We\nused an estimation-maximization algorithm for the saturated\nmultinomial model to estimate probabilities. Next we used data\naugmentation with 50 steps at each iteration to generate 10 im-\nputed complete data sets. The logistic regression analyses were\nrefitted using these 10 imputed data sets, and the method of\nRubin was used to combine the results to get parameter esti-\nmates and their corresponding odds ratios and confidence in-\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nTo achieve convergence in the estimation procedure, more\nparsimonious models were chosen. The number of predictor\nvariables in the models was reduced by choosing variables most\nstrongly related to the outcome. Two models were used. The\nfirst included the variables MSA, age of the victim, race of the\nvictim, sex of the victim, and year of the offense. To analyze\nthe relationship of handgun use to our outcome, a second model\nwas analyzed including handguns and all of the mentioned vari-\nables except age of the victim.\nAs per the Mount Sinai School of Medicine institutional re-\nview board, this study is institutional review board exempt.\nRESULTS\nThe number of homicides by year is shown in\nFigure 1. The SHR data demonstrate the same peak in\nhomicides in 1993 and then decline in homicides as seen\nin the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ho-\nmicide data.1 Minimal seasonality was observed. Over-\nall, 27.4% of childhood homicide victims were girls and\n72.6% were boys. The age distribution of the victims is\nshown in Figure 2. The median age of the victims was\n17 years while the mean age of the offenders was 22 years\nand 8 months. White individuals made up 48% of vic-\ntims, African American individuals 49%. The homicide\nvictims were killed in cities and towns with an average\npopulation of the homicide location based on the MSAs.\nThe most common circumstance reported in the com-\nmitting of a homicide was \"other argument,\" indicating\nthe interpersonal nature of these homicides. Childhood\nhomicide victims were killed with guns approximately\n60% of the time and with knives 12% of the time. The\nmajority of these victims (57.7%) were killed by some-\none known to them, 13% were killed by strangers, and\n29% of victim-offender relationships were unknown.\nThe differences in the relationships of victims to\noffenders by sex was significant at P.01, with girls who\nwere killed more likely to have been killed by someone\nknown to them. A multinomial logistic regression model\n(keeping strangers as the referent group) was used to\nadjust for the following potential confounders: year of\nthe homicide, MSA, weapon, age of the victim, race of\nthe victim, circumstances of the homicide, and census\ndivision where the homicide occurred. In addition, a\nmultiple imputation method (as previously described)\nwas used to account for the missing data. All data are\npresented with the results of the multinomial model first\nand the imputed model second (when applicable). After\nYear of Homicide\nNo. of Homicides\nFigure 1.

This analysis revealed significant differences\nbetween the victim's age and the relationship (P.01)\n(Table 1).\nBecause of the bimodal peaks of victims' ages\n(Figure 2), we analyzed the age of the victims as a di-\nchotomous variable, classifying those younger than 10\nyears as one group and those 10 years and older as an-\nother group. Since children younger than 10 years do not\nhave intimate partners, no analysis could be run exam-\nining this group. Controlling for potential confounders,\nmurdered children younger than 10 years were 23 times\nCI, 2.1-2.5) to have been killed by someone else known\nto them than murdered children aged 10 years and older.\nThese findings were similar to those from the bivariate\nanalyses.\nThe next analysis examined changes in the victim-\noffender relationship based on the population of the\ncity or town where the victim was killed. Victims killed\nby family members were more likely than those killed\nby strangers to have lived in smaller cities and towns,\nthan the cities and towns where those killed by strang-\ners lived. Children killed by intimate partners lived in\ndents (P.01) than the cities and towns where those\nwho were killed by someone else known to them lived\n(P.01) than the cities and towns where those killed by\ndifferences in the relationship of the homicide victim to\nthe offender based on differences in the MSA where the\nhomicide occurred.\nThe weapon used in committing the homicide was sig-\nnificantly associated with the relationship between the\nvictim and the offender (P.01). After adjusting for po-\ntential confounders, victims killed by strangers were more\nlikely to have been killed with a handgun, with similar\nresults in the bivariate model (Table 3).\nCONCLUSIONS\nYouth homicide remains a significant public health\nproblem. This report is one of the first to examine the\nrelationship between the victims of youth homicide and\ntheir offenders. We found marked differences in victim-\noffender relationships based on the sex of the victim,\nwith murdered girls more likely to have been killed by a\nfamily member, an intimate partner, or someone else\nknown to them. After controlling for potential con-\nfounders, and using multiple imputation models, the\ndirection and magnitude of the association between sex\nTable 1.

Further research is needed to\nelucidate the reasons for these findings.\nThe age of the victim was associated with the victim-\noffender relationship. Murdered children younger than\n10 years were much more likely to have been killed by a\nfamily member or someone else known to them. This\nrelationship persisted after adjusting for potential con-\nfounders. This may be because younger children are\nmore likely to be cared for by family members or others\nknown to them while older children and adolescents\ntend to have more friends and more varied relation-\nships. One striking finding is that, for those victims\naged 15 years and older, strangers were not the most\ncommon relationship (16%). These victims were mostly\nkilled by someone known to them (48.4%).\nThe victim-offender relationship was associated with\nthe population where the homicide occurred. Victims\nkilled by strangers were more likely to have lived in larger\ncities or towns while those killed by family members and\nintimate partners were more likely to have lived in smaller\ncities or towns. Once again, these relationships held when\nadjusting for potential confounders.\nFinally, the weapon used during the commission of\nthe homicide was associated with the victim-offender\nrelationship. Children killed by strangers were more\nlikely to have been killed with a handgun than those\nkilled by family members, intimate partners, or others\nknown to them. The direction and magnitude of these\nassociations remained similar in all models except for\nhandgun use in the murder of strangers vs family\nmembers. The direction of the association for this\ngroup remained the same, but the magnitude was\nsmaller after adjusting for potential confounders. This\nchange likely was due to the adjustment for age\nbecause in the imputed model with age removed the\nmagnitude was similar to that in the unadjusted\nmodel. Since a large proportion of children killed by\nfamily members were younger than 5 years and these\nchildren were the least likely to be killed with a hand-\ngun, there was a fairly large change in the OR for this\nsubset of children.\nUsing a data set such as the Uniform Crime Reports\nhas limitations. Only intentional and nonnegligent ho-\nmicides are included in this data set. Since negligent man-\nslaughters and justifiable homicides are excluded, no con-\nclusions can be reached regarding the total number of\nchildren killed with guns or other weapons, causing an\nunderestimation of the number of children killed with\nguns and other weapons. Therefore, rates cannot be cal-\nculated. In addition, this data set includes numerous un-\nsolved homicides and therefore offender data may be miss-\ning. While rates cannot be calculated, the sheer number\nof homicides included in this data set makes these data\nextremely compelling.\nThe National Violent Death Reporting System even-\ntually will be the ideal data set to study victim-offender\nrelationships for homicides. However, since the Na-\ntional Violent Death Reporting System is not yet used na-\ntionally, the SHR are the next best alternative.\nThe fact that 29% of the homicide victims did not\nhave a relationship reported is a known limitation of\nthe data set used. We attempted to eliminate bias by im-\nputing data. All of the associations and magnitudes re-\nmained quite similar in both analyses. This mimics re-\nsults found in other studies of large data sets, such as\nand strengthens our findings.\nThe associations of the victim-offender relationships\nwith the age of the victim, sex of the victim, population\nwhere the homicide took place, and usage of a handgun\nin committing the murder mirror and add to the find-\nings in smaller prior studies,2-7,20 in which the samples\nwere restricted by age, sex, or location.\nFocusing on the victim-offender relationships of\nhomicides can enhance current youth violence preven-\ntion strategies. Given that murdered girls are more\nlikely than murdered boys to have been killed by family\nmembers, further studies are needed to elucidate the\norigins of these findings. This may lead to new and\nunique sex-based primary prevention efforts aimed at\nfamilies during the newborn period and beyond. Addi-\ntionally, the knowledge that murdered older girls are\nmore likely to have been killed by intimate partners\nencourages the initiation of violence prevention coun-\nseling early on, which may reduce the number of inti-\nmate partner homicides. Finally, the finding that hand-\nguns are more likely to be used during homicides of\nchildren by strangers supports the vigorous enforce-\nment of gun control laws to reduce childhood homi-\ncides. Further studies are needed to develop and dem-\nonstrate the efficacy of the violence prevention efforts\ninitiated based on these findings.\nCorrespondence: Harry Moskowitz, MD, MS, Refuah\n(harry@refuahhealthcenter.com).\nPrevious Presentation: This study was presented in part\nat the Ambulatory Pediatrics Association National Meet-\nTable 3.
