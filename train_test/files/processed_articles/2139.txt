Recent\nanimal studies have suggested that BPA exposure may have a role in several mechanisms involved in\nthe development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including weight gain, insulin resistance, thyroid\ndysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. However, few human studies have exam-\nined the association between markers of BPA exposure and CVD. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\nis a subclinical measure of atherosclerotic vascular disease and a strong independent risk factor for\nCVD and mortality.\nObjective: We examined the association between urinary BPA levels and PAD in a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of U.S. adults.\nMethods: We analyzed data from 745 participants in the National Health and Nutritional\nExamination Survey 2003\u00ad2004. We estimated associations between urinary BPA levels (in tertiles)\nand PAD (ankle\u00adbrachial index < 0.9, n = 63) using logistic regression models adjusted for poten-\ntial confounders (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, body mass index, diabetes mellitus,\nhypertension, urinary creati\nnine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and serum cholesterol levels).\nResults: We observed a significant, positive association between increasing levels of urinary BPA\nand PAD before and after adjusting for confounders. The multi\nvariable-adjusted odds ratio for PAD\nassociated with the highest versus lowest tertile of urinary BPA was 2.69 (95% confidence interval:\nConclusions: Urinary BPA levels were significantly associated with PAD, independent of tradi-\ntional CVD risk factors.\nKey words: ankle\u00adbrachial index, bisphenol A, CVD, NHANES, peripheral arterial disease.\nShankar et al.\nthose who had smoked > 100 cigarettes in\ntheir lifetimes were considered former smok-\ners if they answered negatively to the question\n\"Do you smoke now?\" and current smokers if\nthey answered affirmatively.\nRigorous procedures with quality control\nchecks were used in blood collection, and\ndetails about these procedures are provided\nin the NHANES laboratory/medical tech-\nnologists procedures manual (NCHS 2010d).\nWe used the modified hexokinase method to\nmeasure serum glucose levels at the University\nof Missouri Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory\n(Columbia, MO, USA). Diabetes mellitus was\ndefined, based on the recent guidelines of the\nAmerican Diabetes Association (2011), as a\nserum glucose level of > 126 mg/dL after fast-\ning  8 hr or of > 200 mg/dL for those who\nfasted < 8 hr before their NHANES visit, a\nglycosylated hemoglobin value of > 6.5%, or a\nself-reported current use of oral hypo\nglycemic\nmedication or insulin. Seated SBP and DBP\nwere measured using a mercury sphygmoma-\nnometer according to the American Heart\nAssociation and Seventh Joint National\nCommittee recommendations (Chobanian\n2003), and up to three measurements were\naveraged. Patients were considered hyper\ntensive if they reported current use of blood\npressure\u00adreducing medication or had SBPs\nnine measurements were conducted at the\nCollaborative Laboratory Services (Ottumwa,\nIA, USA) using the Beckman Coulter\nSynchron LX20 chemistry analyzer (Beckman\nCoulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) using the\nJaffe rate method (kinetic alkaline picrate).\nCoefficients of variation ranged from 1.5% to\nstudy, serum creati\nnine assays were performed\non 190 stored specimens from NHANES\ntory (Cleveland, OH, USA) using the Roche\ncoupled enzymatic assay that was traceable to\ngold-standard refer\nence methods, including an\nisotope dilution mass spectrometric method\nfor serum creati\nnine using standard references\nmethods [NIST standard reference material\n(SRM) 967; National Institute of Standards\nand Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA]\nand confirmed by analysis of CAP LN-24\n(College of American Pathologists Creatinine\nAccuracy Calibration Verification/Linearity\nSurvey) linearity set based on NIST-assigned\nvalues (Selvin et al. 2007).

To achieve\nenhanced sensitivity and selectivity over pre-\nvious methods, in the current NHANES,\nmeasures of environmental phenols were\nderivatized to alkyl or acyl derivatives before\ngas chromatography\u00admass spectrometry analy-\nsis (NCHS 2010a). The lower limit of detec-\ntion for BPA concentrations was 0.36 ng/mL.\nMain outcome of interest: PAD. For study\nsubjects with at least one arm and weigh-\ning  400 lb, supine SBP was measured\nwith blood pressure cuffs on the right arm,\ncompressing the brachial artery and the two\nposterior tibial arteries (NCHS 2010a). For\nsubjects 40\u00ad59 years of age, two measure-\nments were taken at each site and averaged,\nand for patients  60 years of age, one measure\nwas taken at each site. For subjects with condi-\ntions precluding the measurement of the right\narm, left brachial artery SBP was taken. Left\nand right ABI values were calculated as the\nratio of left and right ankle SBP, respectively,\nto arm SBP. The smallest of the left and right\nABI measurements was used. Patients with\nABIs  1.5 (n = 3) are expected to have severe\narterial rigidity and were excluded from the\npresent analyses (Newman et al. 1993). For\nthese analyses, PAD was defined as ABI < 0.9\n(American Diabetes Association 2011; Selvin\nand Erlinger 2004). Because of the selection\ncriteria for ABI measurements in NHANES\n(subjects  40 years of age), subjects who had\nABI measurements taken were significantly\nolder than the general NHANES cohort but\nwere otherwise similar with respect to demo-\ngraphic factors (data not shown).\nStatistical analysis. Urinary BPA was\ncategorized into tertiles (< 1.4 ng/mL,\nsized that high BPA levels are associated with\nPAD. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) for PAD in association with\nBPA were calculated by taking the lowest\ntertile (tertile 1) as the referent, using multi\nvariable logistic regression models. We used\ntwo models: one adjusted only for age and sex,\nand a multi\nvariable model that also adjusted\nfor race/\nethnicity (non-Hispanic whites, non-\nHispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, others),\neducation (< high school, high school, > high\n(never, former, current), pack-years of smok-\ning, alcohol intake (non\ndrinker, moderate\ndrinker, heavy drinker), BMI (normal, over-\nweight, obese), hypertension (present, absent),\ndiabetes (present, absent), urinary creati\nnine\n(milligrams per deciliter), eGFR (milliliters\nper minute per 1.73 m2), and total cholesterol\n(milligrams per deciliter). Trends in the OR of\nPAD across increasing urinary BPA categories\nwere determined by modeling BPA as an ordi-\nnal variable. We examined effect modification\nby performing stratified analysis by categories\nof sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, diabetes mellitus,\nand hypertension. We also conducted formal\nstatistical tests for inter\naction by including\nmultiplicative cross-product interaction terms\nin the multi\nvariable logistic regression models;\np < 0.1 was interpreted as a statistically signifi-\ncant interaction. Sample weights that account\nfor the unequal probabilities of selection, over-\nsampling, and non-response were applied for all\nanalyses using SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN soft-\nware (version 10; RTI International,  \nTriangle Park, NC, USA); SEs were estimated\nusing the Taylor series linearization method.\nResults\nThe median (interquartile range) of uri-\nParticipants with higher levels of BPA were\nmore likely to be men, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand former or current smokers and had higher\nlevels of urinary creati\nnine.

Overall,\nwe observed a positive association between\nincreasing BPA levels and PAD on the basis\nof the age- and sex-adjusted model and the\nmulti\nvariable-adjusted model, with significant\n(p < 0.05) trend tests (Table 2). This positive\nassociation persisted when BPA was analyzed\nas a continuous variable (1-SD increase in log-\ntransformed BPA).\nIn a supplementary analysis, we examined\nthe association between BPA levels and PAD\nafter excluding n = 10 subjects with very high\nBPA values (levels > 30 ng/mL). The results\nwere found to be essentially simi\nlar.

(2006) showed that\nmice with long-term exposure to environ-\nmentally relevant levels of BPA developed\nhyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and\nglucose intolerance. Furthermore, in ani-\nmal models BPA has been shown to induce\nendothelial cell injury mediated through oxi-\ndative stress (Hennig et al. 2002; Ooe et al.\nlipids (Marmugi et al. 2012).
