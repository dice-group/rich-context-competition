The concept imagination has received\nlittle scholarly attention within the field of management, despite its potential to inform a number of lines of inquiry. At the\npresent time, much of the research literature on imagination is confined to the visual arts, literature, and education. Human\nresource (HR) professionals could play a part in aligning employees with organizational goals and bring about organizational\nchange if they developed their thinking in a more imaginative way. Developing managerial imagination can help solve the\ndilemmas and contradictions they face. A diagram is developed, which maps the development of the personnel function and\noffers four possibilities within a framework. They are biography, personal framing, history, and social structure. The outcome\nof this analysis provides a development of the personnel function one of which is a globally imaginative HR management.\nWithin such a framework, the concept of \"the imaginative performer\" is discussed. The implications of combining imagination\nwith management may provide a theoretical and practical way to understanding HR management.\n",

Instead, manage-\nment researchers have left imagination as largely the pre-\nserve of other disciplines, such as literature (Hughes, 1988),\n(1973) described the sociological imagination as an intellec-\ntual craft for scholarship conferring the ability to shift per-\nspectives and obtain a totality of view by connecting history,\nbiography, and social structure. He suggested that imagina-\ntion is the \"most fruitful\" and cultivatable form of self-con-\nsciousness in which \"men, whose mentalities have swept\nonly a series of limited orbits often come to feel as if sud-\ndenly awakened in a house with which they had only sup-\nOsborn (1953) was one of the earliest management writ-\ners to explicitly recognize the importance of imagination in\nbusiness. More recent forays into the field are those of Schon\nSchon by suggesting that the role of the imagination found in\nart could be applied to management, a subject area domi-\nnated by rationalist philosophy and the application of scien-\ntific method.\nIn this article, the author follows Spender's suggestion by\nbuilding on Mills's idea that social science deals with prob-\nlems of biography, history, and their intersection with social\nstructures. A fourth dimension also has been added, namely,\n\"personal problem farming\" (Schon, 1983) to capture the\nway individuals perceive problems and make sense of them\nessentially in a subjective manner. The article then goes on to\nsuggest that through the use of the managerial imagination, a\nmanager can develop into what is termed \"the imaginative\nperformer\" and apply this to the area of human resource\nmanagement (HRM). The human resource (HR) manager\n1Bristol University, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael Savvas, Bristol University, Priory Road Complex, Priory Road,\nBristol, BS8 1TU, UK.\nEmail: Michael.Savvas@bristol.ac.uk\nManagerial Imagination: HRM and \"The\nImaginative Performer\"\nMichael Savvas1\n Keywords\nimagination, managerial imagination, human resource management, imaginative performer, global human resources\n\"This history, my Friend! hath chiefly told\nOf intellectual power, from stage to stage.\nAdvancing, hand in hand with love and joy,\nAnd of imagination teaching truth ...\"\n(Wordsworth, 1805, The Prelude, Book Eleventh).\n2 SAGE Open\ncan use imagination to solve two particular dilemmas,\nnamely, a balancing act between a positive contribution to\norganizational success and acting as a guardian of fairness in\nthe treatment of employees, and coping with the tension per-\nsonnel professionals can experience between being manage-\nrialist and being professional (Pilbeam & Corbridge, 2002).\nThe article is structured in the following way. The concept\nof imagination is discussed in \"The Development of the\nMeaning of Imagination\" section of this article. The litera-\nture covering the managerial imagination is discussed in\n\"The Managerial Imagination\" section, whereas \"The\nManagerial Imagination and Its Application to Human\nResource Management\" section discusses the concept of the\nimaginative performer. A summary and conclusion follows\nin \"Summary and Conclusion\" section.\nThe Development of the Meaning of\nImagination\nVarious definitions and descriptions of imagination are sum-\nmarized in Table 1. From this, one can see why (Gaut, 2003)\ncalled it a slippery concept.\nOne of the problems identifiable in Table 1 is the variety\nof meanings of imagination inherent in the complex and mul-\ntifaceted nature of the concept, and the fact that imagination\nlies at the crux of those aspects of our lives that are less well\nunderstood (Egan, 1992). In describing the imagination,\nscholars \"refer to the capacity we have in common to hold\nimages in our minds of what may not be present or even\nexist, and sometimes to allow these images to affect us as\nthough they were present and real\" (Egan, 1992, p. 3). By\nnature, an internal and personal and subjective, and hence\nhard to describe, they are unlike other kinds of images we are\nfamiliar with in the \"external world.\" People also differ in\nthe quality of the experience associated with such images\nsome having a clear access to vivid quasi-pictorial images\n(e.g., Kekul\u00e9 in discovering the ring structure of the benzene\nmolecule in a reverie involving snakes swallowing their own\ntails), and other people only having such vague experiences\nas the word \"image\" seems almost inappropriate. However,\nin this study, the author is more inclined to perceive the\nimagination as having the inclination and ability to con-\nsciously conceive of the unusual and effective in particular\nFor example, through storytelling (Gabriel, 1997), we\nconceive of and interpret the unusual and effective in a par-\nticular way and thus trigger the imagination and insight. By\napplying the imagination, one can link one thought or object\nwith another and create a reason for the price or create value\nfor a product or service. In this case, a general story that pro-\nvides an example of imagination in use can illustrate the\npower of imagination and insight in developing a creative\nsolution to a problem. It involves a car journey in which a fan-\nbelt broke in a rather isolated country area on a Sunday after-\nnoon. The occupants had to return home reasonably quickly.\nThere were no garages in the vicinity. One solution was to\ncall the Automobile Association (AA) breakdown service.\nHowever, no one in the car was a member. An alternative\nsolution was put forward by one member of the group. He\nasked his wife to remove her tights so that they could be used\nas a temporary fan belt. The tights were then applied and the\nexcessive ends of the tights that might interfere with the\nengine were burnt off with a lighter. With the tights suffi-\nciently installed, the car was able to run and the car limped\nhome. This example could arguably be perceived as someone\nin the group using imagination by relating one thought or\nobject with another, using the tights as a fan belt and creating\na value for the product of service.\nAn example from business management is the way Mike\nLazaridis founder of Research in Motion (RIM) imagined\nwhat an executive's life would be like if you receive your\nemails on a handheld device. How compelling would a phone\nbe if you can have a BlackBerry attached to your belt? He\ncould not \"prove\" that this would be a good idea. There were\nno data on the demand patterns for smartphones, because\nsmartphones existed in his imagination. However, only 11\nyears after the launch of the product of his imagination, RIM\nled Motorola by an even greater margin in sales-market\nshares and profitability (Martin, 2010).\nThe Managerial Imagination\nThis article suggests that imagination involves imaginings of\nvarious types involving, but not equivalent to, the forming of\nimages and the capacity to think in novel and unusual ways.\nIt is not being argued here that imaginings should replace\nother forms of cognition such as deliberative and reasoned\nrational analysis. However, imaginative management would\ninvolve the disciplined and crafted use of the imagination as\nopposed to the idle and na\u00efve play of fancy. Managerial\nimaginings would acknowledge and accommodate the vital\nsignificance of history and biography as in Mills's (1973)\nsociological imagination. This use of history and biography\nand their intersection within social structure and the added\nconcept of personal problem framing would help to uncover\nthe turning points in individuals' lives that these create and\nreflect, and recognize the profound influences that these\nexert on past, current, and future ways of perceiving and\nknowing.\nMartin (2009) has perceived of imagination as a tool of\nthe design thinker. In Martin's view, the tools of the crafts-\nman are efficiency vehicles. \"Without a conceptual tool kit,\nyou would have to tackle every problem from first princi-\npossible to categorize problems, and apply tools to them that\nhave proved effective in similar circumstances in the past\nThe managerial imagination, therefore, consists of the use\nof the imagination as a tool to combine ideas that no one\nexpected were combinable. As Mills (1973) suggested,\n\"Imagination is often successfully invited by putting together\nhitherto isolated items, by finding unsuspected connexions\"\n(p. 221). Such a capacity cannot come from just mere tech-\nnique or expertise. A manager can be \"well trained\" but\ngiven that one can be educated or trained only in what is\nalready known (what Revans, 1983, referred to as \"pro-\ngrammed knowledge\"), training may incapacitate one from\nbeing able to learn new ways of seeing. These new ways may\nsometimes be loose and unclear, but it is necessary to cling to\nsuch vague images and notions, for it is in such forms that\noriginal ideas may first appear.\nTo stimulate the managerial imagination, a number of\npractices can be adopted and adapted from Mills' work with\nregard to \"intellectual craftsmanship.\" For the manager part\nof such a craft is learning to use one's life experiences in\none's work on the assumption that by continually examining,\nreflecting, and interpreting one's own reactions in certain\nsituations, they might better understand how they might react\nin similar situations.\nAfurther element of an intellectual craftsmanship inspired\nby Mills is the adoption of an attitude of playfulness toward\nphrases and words with which various issues are defined.\nOriginal thinkers in other disciplines have also highlighted\nthe importance of playfulness as being the key to scientific\noriginality (Ramachandran, 2011). Both believe this loosens\nthe imagination, and for Mills, this may involve looking up\nsynonyms for key terms in dictionaries, to know the full\nrange of their connotations. Playfulness toward words could\nimplicate the deliberate use of metaphor to stimulate the\nimagination or articulate intuitions (Vaughan, 1979). Such an\napproach has proved fruitful in developing understanding\nand conceptions of the complexities of organizational prob-\nlems by encouraging individuals to think and act in new\nways by extending horizons of insight and creating new pos-\nthat metaphor-making is a paradigm of the creative use of the\nimagination, because it mirrors some of the functioning of\nimagination and so supports a metacognitive understanding\nTable 1. Various Definitions and Descriptions of Imagination.\nVarious definitions of imagination\nBarrow (1988) To be imaginative is to have the inclination and ability to consciously conceive of the unusual and effective in\nparticular ways. (p. 84)\nBlackburn (2006) Imagination most directly, the faculty of reviving or especially creating images in the mind's eye. But more\ngenerally the ability to create and rehearse possible situations, to combine knowledge in unusual ways. (p. 180)\nEgan (1992) When people try to describe the imagination, most frequently they refer to the capacity we have in common\nto hold images in our minds of what may not be present or even exist, and sometimes to allow these\nimages to affect us as though they were present and real. (p. 3)\nEgan (1992) Imagination entails the ability to transcend the obstacles to thinking with which easy acceptance of\nconventional beliefs, ideas, interpretations, representations, and so on, confront us. (p. 47)\nHughes (1988) The imagination usually denotes not much more than the faculty of creating a picture of something in our\nheads and holding it there while we think about it. Since this is the basis of nearly everything we do, clearly\nit's very important that our imagination should be strong rather than weak. (p. 35)\nMills (1973) Imagination is the capacity to range from the most impersonal and remote transformations to the most\nintimate features of the human self and to see the relations between them. (p. 12)\nMock (1970) Imaginative understanding gives an extra dimension to our rational thinking and understanding, making us\ncapable of responding to imaginative truth which is embodied in the arts and cannot be expressed by any\nother means. (p. 32)\nRobinson (2009) Imagination is the power to bring to mind things that are not present in our senses. (p. 58)\nWarnock (1994) Coleridge divides the imagination itself into primary and the secondary. Primary imagination is that which we\ndeploy in all perception, by which in some inexplicable manner we create the real world, with which we\nare familiar. Secondary imagination is, Coleridge says, \"an echo\" of primary. It, unlike the primary, \"coexists\nwith the conscious will.\" It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate. It is the imagination at work\nin great works of art. (p. 41)\nWhite (1990) To imagine something is to think of it as possibly being so. (p. 184)\n4 SAGE Open\nof imagination, that is, metaphor-making is an instance of\ndeliberative creative imagining.\nAnother aspect of Mill's intellectual craftsmanship is the\nskill of making up ideal types, as opposed to stereotypes.\nIdeal types are abstractions that may be used to better under-\nstand reality. Weber (1949) gave us the example of the ideal\ntype of bureaucracy, but they could be charts, tables, dia-\ngrams, and so on. For Weber, ideal types were mental con-\nstructs that are ideal in the \"logical sense,\" that is, they state\na logical extreme, they \"distort\" and abstract from reality,\nthey can be used to formulate an abstract model of the gen-\neral form and interrelated causes and effects of a complex\nFinally, part of such craftsmanship may involve thinking in\nterms of extremes or taking polar opposites to what one is\ndirectly concerned with to achieve alternative insights. Taking\nextreme positions may help individuals to think from a variety of\nviewpoints, which enables the mind to become a moving prism,\ncatching light from as many angles as possible, hence \"release of\nthe imagination can sometimes be achieved by deliberately\nMethod\nThis article sets out a theoretical framework to encourage a\ndebate about the managerial imagination and its implications\nfor HRM. The article comes from reflections on my reading\nPaik, & Kindler, 2007) and experience as a researcher and\nteacher on this subject: It includes examples in which the author\nhas been involved in a formal setting and informal experience.\nThe author's interest has also been stimulated by finding\nthat the physical sciences imagination is also required. In his\nbiography of Einstein, Isaacson (2012) acknowledged the\nimportance of imagination in his work: \"Einstein had elusive\nqualities of genius, which included an intuition and imagina-\ntion that allowed him to think differently\" (p. 40).\nThis then is an introduction to ideas for a new way of\nthinking about HRM. It cannot be perceived as fully devel-\noped at this stage. The outline of imagination as one concep-\ntion of nonlinear thinking has a considerable history in many\ndisciplines such as fine art and literature. It now requires\ndevelopment both analytically and creatively in HRM and\nmanagement generally. Once greater clarity is achieved\nbetween imagination and HRM, further research and empiri-\ncal work are possible. The next section will therefore explore\nthe links between managerial imagination and HRM.\nThe Managerial Imagination and\nIts Application to Human Resource\nManagement\nthe status of theory and research in HRM, questioning \"where\nhave we been and where should we go from here?\"\nFrom time to time we believe that researchers need to pause and\nreflect on the status of theory and research in human resource\nmanagement. The reason is that this is the only way we can\ncontinue to make important contributions to theory, research and\nDipboye (2007) responded to some of these issues and\nargues that HRM falls short in three areas: first, cumulative\nprogress in theory development; second, rigorous methodol-\nogy; third, relevance to important stakeholders. Scholars of\nHRM need to reflect on these comments. Academic progress\nin particular is an issue of concern for advancing HRM.\nDipboye offers two further useful insights: First, HRM\nresearchers should be monogamous in their questions but\npromiscuous in their methods; second, they should simulta-\nneously embrace the simplicity of science and the complex-\nity and confusion of practice. Our response to these critiques\nis as follows: A reconceptualization of HRM as a craft\nthrough the engagement with and embracing of the manage-\nrial imagination can address some perceived shortcomings\nand support and facilitate the practices of imaginative\nperformance.\nMore recently, some senior HR professionals have\nreferred to \"insight\" as an important ingredient for future HR\nleaders (Orme, 2010), arguing that the next generation of HR\nleaders should have such an insight that she defines as the\nleader having business \"savvy,\" practical understanding of\ntheir organization, understanding the context of markets, and\nthe influence of technological changes. Orme argued for dif-\nferent types of insight, for example, insights into the strategic\nhealth of the organization, its organizational ability and\nadaptability in facing challenges in the future, insights into\npeople and culture, and insights into transactional enablers.\nThe development of such insight draws fundamentally,\nessentially, and necessarily on use of the managerial imagi-\nnation by HR leaders. If Orme is arguing for practical\n\"insights\" for future HR leaders, Martin (2009) is arguing for\ndesign thinking for leaders in which imagination is part of a\npersonal knowledge system, and is a further development\nwith regard to management.\nIn support of the argument, imagination is applied to\nHRM and personnel management. The framework depicted\nin Figure 1 is derived from but is not exclusively linked to\nMills (1973). It documents a transition from personnel man-\nagement into imaginative HR. In the pursuit of a pragmatic\nand even normative outcome, the concept of the Imaginative\nPerformer is introduced. In providing a framework that links\nthe imagination with HRM a challenge is posed to the func-\ntionalism (Watson, 2009), which has tended to dominate\nHRM. In drawing on Mills, this article offers an alternative\nconceptualization with implications for both theory and\npractice and builds on Watson's (2009) critical and prag-\nmatic account of the realities of HRM.\nThe dimensions of the framework are biography and\nsocial structure, and history and personal problem framing.\nThe development of the personnel function can be traced\nwithin the model, and different conceptions of HR as they\nhave evolved over time may be categorized in the frame-\nwork: retrospectively (a) traditional personnel management,\n(b) HRM, (c) international HRM, and prospectively toward\n(d) globally imaginative HR. The four elements of the frame-\nwork are discussed below.\nOriginally, biography, or life story, referred to the account\ngiven by an individual about his or her life. This personal\naccount (sometimes backed up by additional external\nsources, such as official records, letters, diaries) constitutes a\nlife history of substantive events in chronological order and\nis \"the account given by an individual, only with the empha-\nsis upon the ordering into themes or topics that the individual\nchooses to adopt or omit as s/he tells the story\" (Miller, 2007,\np. 19). Mills's (1973) position was that social science deals\nwith problems of biography, history, and their intersections\nwithin social structures: Biography applies to HRM in that it\nis associated with what Mills referred to as personal troubles,\nin this case of particular employees. It has to do with his or\nher self and those \"limited\" areas of social life of which they\nare directly and personally aware. Such troubles are private\nmatters. They may represent the values and norms of specific\nindividuals who perceive that these values and norms are\nthreatened by the organization in which they work.\nThe historical dimension or history provides a methodical\nrecord of past events. For historians, the goal has usually\nbeen the understanding and explanation of specific historical\nsituations (Jary & Jary, 1991). More recently, Jordanova\n(2006) argued that it is difficult to say what the defining\ncharacteristics of history are, although eclecticism and ana-\nlytical flexibility are major features: \"Integrating apparently\ndiverse sources and approaches to produce more holistic\naccounts is an important goal of the discipline\" (p. 4). History\nis important to HRM because without the use of history and\nwithout a historical sense of psychological matters, the HR\nspecialist cannot adequately state the kinds of problems that\nought now to be the central point of their studies. They can-\nnot easily identify what are the critical issues that need to be\naddressed in their own time and specific to their organiza-\ntion. A historical dimension provides a way in which HR\nmanagers can \"read\" the situation within the \"lesson\" of\nhistory.\nBoth biography and history are dimensions that can be\nlinked to the managerial imagination. Mills (1973) echoed\nThomas and Znaniechi in that \"social science deals with the\nproblems of biography, of history and of their intersection\nwith social structures--these three biography, history, and\nsociety are the points of the proper study of man\" (p. 159). It\nis an approach that features both breadth and process, which\ndistinguishes biographical and history methods, which argu-\nably cannot be captured by predetermined quantitative meth-\nods of research. Therefore, attempts to capture the future is\narguably a dimension of history that relies on the use of the\nimagination and not measurement. To imagine a future, one\nhas to look beyond the measurable variables, beyond what\ncan be proven with past data (Martin, 2010). This is what\nLazaridis was attempting at RIM in developing the\nsmartphone.\nPersonal Framing is concerned with how an individual\nsees a problem in his or her own way depending on prior\nevents and predispositions (e.g., experiences and personal-\nity). Pragmatically, one has to decide what the problem is (or\nframe it) before one can decide what to do about it, and dif-\nferent individuals may frame the same problem in different\nways, and may reframe the same problem differently in the\nlight of experience. Thus, they may transform it differen-\ntially. Problem framing is concerned with how an individual\nperceives, interprets, and makes sense of a personal problem,\nand which may not be shared with others. The personal fram-\ning can also be perceived as constructed and reconstructed\nwithin a sociohistorical network of associations. Networks\nsuch as nuclear and extended families, job history, and per-\nsonal life course can be compared and evaluated in relation\nto the wider societal and historical events that have taken\nplace during one's lifetime (Miller, 2007). Personal framing\ncan be associated with the shift from a positivist to an inter-\npretivist perspective in social analysis (Calhoun, Gerteis,\nMoody, Pfaff, Virk, 2007). Research in the interpretivist tra-\ndition is more often linked by researchers studying organiza-\ntions in the 21st century. It is also associated with cultures\nsuch as the United Kingdom, which emphasizes the value of\nindividualism as opposed to collectivism (Hofstede &\nHofstede, 2005). This suggests that HRM needs to take\naccount of how an employee interprets his or her personal\nunderstanding of organizational issues. Employees may\ninterpret their problems as a private matter. However, when\nsuch a \"problem\" is interpreted by many employees, it may\nbecome a public issue, which goes beyond the individual's\nunderstanding. This then becomes an issue that could be\nunderstood at a social structural level of analysis.\nSocial Structure is a complex concept on which there is\ndisagreement even among social scientists. Giddens defines\n\"structure as the `rules and resources' that act as common\ninterpretive schemes in a particular social system\" (Calhoun\nBiography Social structure\nHistory 1. Traditional personnel management 3. International human resource management\nPersonal framing 2. Human resource management 4. Globally imaginative human resources\nFigure 1. From traditional personnel management to globally imaginative HRM.\n6 SAGE Open\nroughly the same way that language is related to speech.\nStructures organize practices, but at the same time, structures\nare enacted and reproduced by practices (Calhoun et al.,\n2007). It should be further argued that although we can expe-\nrience structures as something external to us, they cannot be\nobserved except through their effects on practices. Finally,\nfor Giddens (1976), the notion of structure is important\nbecause it emphasizes that it is not just constraining, but it is\nalso enabling.\nIt could be argued that social structure is linked to HRM\nbecause to use an analogy from Mills, it is linked to public\nissues. Such public issues have to do with matters that tran-\nscend the \"local\" context of the individual and the range of\nhis or her inner life. An issue becomes a public matter and is\nnot exclusive to one individual. Thus, we will further argue\nthat issues that transcend the \"local\" are more associated\nwith international and globally imaginative HRM.\nTraditional personnel management lies at the intersection\nof biography and history. Much of traditional personnel man-\nagement deals with employees' well-being and needs and\nreactively resolves problems linked to the individual welfare\nof employees. Personnel professionals dealt with the per-\nsonal troubles of individual employees in a reactive way if\nthis affected individual and organizational performance. The\nbiography and history of employees thus become important\nto understand what Pilbeam and Corbridge (2002) called\nsensitive employment issues such as stress in the workplace\nand how this affects absentee rates.\nHRM lies at the intersection of biography and personal\nframing. For example, HRM came to prominence during the\n1980s when greater emphasis was given to an individualistic\nrather than collectivistic approach to employee relations.\nArguably, this shift from a collectivistic to a more individu-\nalistic approach to the relationship between an employer and\nemployee requires the HR manager to understand not only\nthe biography of employees but also their personal frame of\nreference. It could be argued that employees, given their\nincreasing individualistic approach to the workplace, framed\nand reframed their situation in the changing context of\nemployability and hence careers since the 1980s. Writers\nsuch as Kanter (1989) suggested that managers can no longer\nrely on the organization for their career development and\nmust learn to manage themselves and their work indepen-\ndently. Early HRM models offered the possibility that the\npersonnel function could not only meet the challenges cre-\nated by increasing competitive pressures and industrial\nrestructuring in many Western economies but also embody a\nstrategic role if it utilized its philosophies and practices\n(Guest, 1987). Employees are valued assets and a major\nsource of competitive advantage, and managers need to\nengender commitment and loyalty to ensure high levels of\nperformance. Through knowing each employee's biography\nand personal problem frame, the HR manager would be bet-\nter placed to perceive the turning points in the lives of such\nemployees with the possible implications for the organiza-\ntion. These turning points could be crucial in understanding\nindividual employees' ambitions, strengths, skills, and\nknowledge, and how best they can contribute to their\norganization.\nInternational HRM lies at the intersection of history and\nsocial structure. One variable that differentiates international\nfrom \"domestic\" HRM is complexity (Dowling, Festing, &\nEngle, 2008). This complexity is due to firms operating in\ndifferent countries with and across different cultures and\nemploying different categories of workers (Dowling et al.,\n2008). Such complexity can be attributed to a number of fac-\ntors including the need for a broader perspective. Thus, such\ncomplexity requires greater versatility in using both linear\nand nonlinear approaches in today's not only complex but\nalso uncertain and unpredictable global business environ-\nment. Such a business environment requires managers and\nHR professionals to reach beyond linear thinking involving\nrationality, analysis, logic, reason, and prediction based on\ncause and effect (Siggelkow & Rivkin, 2005). To comple-\nment such thinking, recent writers have advocated the impor-\ntance of nonlinear thinking (Vance et al., 2007), which\nincludes imagination.\nAs Warnock (1994) suggested, if we can educate a per-\nson's imagination, we will give him or her a place in time.\nWe will allow them to stretch the sense of the present back\ninto the past, both their own individual past, and that of the\nworld as a whole. One could argue that the education of man-\nagers and HR professionals has tended to be ahistorical and\nnot always emphasizing nonlinear thinking styles such as the\nimagination.\nA globally imaginative HRM lies at the intersection of\npersonal framing and social structure. The reason why per-\nsonal framing may be perceived as important is that an HR/\npersonnel manager needs to define and redefine his or her\ndefinition of the situation. It is argued that such a manager\nneeds to use his or her personal framing in a complex world.\nFor the globally imaginative HR manager, the capacity is to\nalso think in a particular way, thinking of the possible.\nEngaging the imagination is nurturing this capacity in one's\nself or in others. Some have argued that \"management may\nbe more about the exercise of the managerial imagination\nrather than a rigorous body of academic knowledge\"\n(Spender, 2007, p. 38). Imagination presents a means to pose\nchallenges to the taken-for-granted assumptions offering the\npotential to enable practitioners to stand outside their taken-\nfor-granted practice. If as Spencer argues, conceptualizing\nimaginative management as a process involving serious hard\nwork and commitment that pushes the limits of practice, then\none could argue that such an approach is what Mills referred\nto as \"craftsmanship.\" If the personal framing dimension of\nthe model requires a more imaginative and reflective practi-\ntioner, then the limits of his or her constraints would emerge\nat a structural level of analysis. This dimension will now be\ndiscussed.\nA central issue at a social structural level is the continued\nimpact of globalization, which reflects international eco-\nnomic integration arising from the revolution in communica-\ntion technologies, the growth and dominance of international\ncapital markets, labor migration, and the global reach and\ninfluence of multinational corporations (Bach, 2005).\nAccordingly, the volatility of employment due to globaliza-\ntion has promoted more contingent work, which has meant a\nshift in the management of the employment relationship\naway from a single employer, who has influence over HR\npractices and seeks employee commitment. It could be\nargued that there is a diversity of the employment relation-\nship that exists in multiemployer, networked organizations.\nThis can be seen in the ways staff are employed and whether\nthey are full-time, part-time, or temporary workers. If the\nsocial structural part of the model in this segment is about\nglobalization and its influence on the nature of work, the per-\nsonal problem framing is about the individual employee and\nhow he or she interprets and gives meaning to the nature of\nwork. If globalization provides the framework at a structural\nlevel, the individual employees' frame of reference makes\nsense by constructing and reconstructing the employment\nrelationship. However, this reconstruction takes place within\na framework created at a structural level. Thus, the commit-\nment-based approach at the heart of the early HRM models\nhas given way to an emphasis on ensuring that employees are\nengaged and gain emotional meaning from work. In such a\nscenario, a pragmatic approach toward HR entails engage-\nment with the managerial imagination to cope with complex-\nities and ambiguities of contemporary workplaces, and to\nimagine useful tools rather than pursue universal generalized\nThe next section of this article discusses the concept\nimaginative performer using a specific example from HRM,\nnamely, recruitment and selection.\nThe Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development\n(CIPD Professional Standards, 2009) has referred to the\nmodel of the \"Thinking Performer\" as someone who (a) con-\nsciously seeks to contribute to underlying organizational\npurposes, (b) when necessary reinforces compliance of the\nHR role but realizes that doing so is not sufficient of itself to\nadd value, (c) challenges the way things are done, and finds\nalternative solutions, and (d) keeps in touch with \"custom-\ners\" and reacts to feedback and proactively develops as an\nindividual.\nOne could argue that finding alternative solutions to an\nHR problem requires linear and nonlinear thinking. The form\nof nonlinear thinking emphasized in this article is\nimagination.\nTherefore, this article is putting forward the concept of\nthe imaginative HR performer by offering an example related\nto one aspect of the role, namely, that of recruitment and\nselection. This will be conducted at a number of levels of\nanalysis. At the individual level, the author's experience of\nteaching HRM practitioners observed that some were highly\nstructured, bureaucratic and conventional in their thinking\nand practice. They wanted highly structured situations and\nperceived as deviant or unimportant knowledge and practice,\nwhich did not contribute to a particular norm or frame of\nreference familiar to them. They appeared to be deductive/\ninductive thinkers. However, more recent business research\nhas focused on the importance of abductive thinking (Martin,\n2009). In abductive thinking, the goal is to posit what could\npossibly be true. It is usually associated with more nonlinear\nforms of thinking such as imagination and intuition. This is\nnot to suggest that all personnel practitioners should be\nabductive thinkers but that they should find a balance\nbetween deductive/inductive and abductive thinking. It is\nargued here that the imaginative performer should develop a\nbalance in their thinking.\nAs part of the role of the personnel practitioner, Brown\nand Hesketh (2004) highlighted the complexities of the\nrecruitment and selection process in their research on gradu-\nate employability. They found a range of techniques adopted\nby assessment centers on behalf of companies wishing to\nrecruit staff. Apart from a range of techniques associated\nwith deductive/inductive thinking, they also partially refer to\nconstructive imagination and intuitive originality under a\nchapter called a \"science of gut feeling.\" Clearly, they found\nin their research that assessors were considering not only\ndeductive/inductive but also abductive approaches. It could\nbe argued that the imaginative manager in his or her recruit-\nment and selection process needs to consider such a balance,\nand that part of such a process will be the importance of\nfuture scenarios; such scenario building requires imagination\nas well as deducing the past performance of candidates.\nAt a further level of analysis, we return to the dilemmas\nfacing personnel professionals highlighted earlier in this arti-\ncle, namely, the case of experiencing tension between being\nmanagerialist and being professional (Pilbeam & Corbridge,\n2002). An emphasis on competitive advantage and \"added-\nvalue\" may be perceived as threatening some aspects of pro-\nfessionalism, and the HR manager may take actions that are\nin conflict with his or her professional and ethical standards.\nThe professional demands require members to continuously\nupdate knowledge and expertise to ensure professional stan-\ndards are maintained. Thus, ambiguities and tensions can be\nreduced, but these first have to be recognized and clarified.\nThe personnel manager has to balance making a positive\ncontribution to organizational success and acting as a guard-\nian of fairness in the treatment of employees. One could\ndescribe such a balance as the manager oscillating between\nthese two positions. It is therefore argued that this requires\nboth linear and nonlinear thinking. Thus, such a balance\nrequires nonlinear thinking such as imagination.\nThe imaginative performer, through scenario planning,\nneeds to also demonstrate leadership and ability to facilitate\norganizational change. In the case of recruitment and selec-\ntion, the personnel professional oscillates between these ten-\nsions. For an international assignment, these tensions are\n8 SAGE Open\npotentially even greater. Some have argued that the key dif-\nference between international and domestic HRM is the\ngreater complexity of operating in different countries and\nusing different national categories (Dowling et al., 2008).\nThe lesson to be drawn about international recruitment and\nselection is that such a tension between the skills and\ncompetencies that organisations think they should be looking for\nwhen they recruit and on the other hand the skills that are\nactually needed to make a success of working abroad. (Sparrow,\nIt is argued in this article that the imaginative performer\nshould not only be aware of such tensions but also reduce\nthem by creating a reason and a value for the service. This\nrequires one's own personal knowledge system part of which\nis imagination (Martin, 2009). Such a personal knowledge\nsystem in an international setting requires certain leadership\ncharacteristics such as self-confidence, curiosity, communi-\ncation skills, care goals and expectations, and also imagina-\nThere are several possible future research directions relat-\ning to the concept of managerial imagination. One such\ndirection is concerned with the notion of a learning organiza-\ntion. Senge (1990) referred to identifying five vital dimen-\nsions in building organizations that learn. Two of these\ndimensions are mental models and team learning. In the for-\nmer, the managerial imagination can help HR managers\nredefine the deeply ingrained assumptions they may have\nabout the organization and their role as HR professionals.\nRothwell, Prescott, and Taylor (2008) argued that HR profes-\nsionals are being asked to transform their organizations bet-\nter, by playing an important role in aligning talent with\norganizational goals, and in bringing about organizational\nchange. They further argued the transformation of the HR\nfunction should begin by focusing on these future trends. The\ndiscipline of working with mental models starts with learn-\ning to unearth our internal pictures or images of the organiza-\ntion, to bring them to the surface and to scrutinize them. It\nalso includes the ability to reflect on various imaginative\noptions where people expose their own thinking effectively\nand make that thinking open to the influence of others. This\ncan be achieved in team learning. This starts with dialogue,\nwith the capacity of members of a team to suspend assump-\ntions and enter into a process of thinking together. This\nallows the group to discover insights that may arise.\nAnother research direction is the training and develop-\nment of future HR leaders. Some have argued that in terms of\nHR development, there is some element of personal imagina-\ntion and creativity involved (Gibb, 2004). This researcher\nargues that what makes the difference is not the possession of\nscientific knowledge but the use of imagination and creativ-\nity. As has been argued earlier, imagining means the capacity\nto think in a particular way, thinking of the possible. Enabling\nthe use of the imagination is helping to develop this learning\nin oneself and in others (Gibb, 2004). One writer has pro-\nvided a planning framework for imaginative learning and\ndevelopment (Egan, 1992). Admittedly, this was structured\nfor the development of the imagination in secondary school\nchildren. Nevertheless, Egan's comprehensive research into\nthe concept and specifically the planning framework can be\nadapted for the development and training of HR leaders and\npractitioners.\nSummary and Conclusion\nThis article has outlined how the managerial imagination can\nbe linked to HRM and is developed with a model to help bet-\nter understand such a link. In this process, it was necessary to\nalso outline and explore the concept of imagination as one\nform of nonlinear thinking. Imagination may be perceived as\nimportant to HR practitioners because it can help clarify orga-\nnizational problems, and as such, it can help individuals and\ntheir organizations help design policies and practices that will\nlead to better solutions. A further argument is that more imag-\ninative ways of solving problems and adding greater competi-\ntive advantage are neglected in the formal and informal\neducation, training, and development of HR managers.\nOne could conceive of HRM as a \"bridging culture\" in\nresolving two dilemmas with the use of imagination. First,\nthe HR manager can use imagination to solve the balancing\nact that is required between a positive contribution to organi-\nzational success and acting as a guardian of fairness in the\ntreatment of employees. Second is the tension HR profes-\nsionals can experience between being managerial and being\nprofessional. It is being suggested that to bridge these two\ndilemmas, it is worth returning to Mills (1973). Instead of the\nsociological imagination, one can talk about a managerial\nimagination. This can be conceived as an intellectual craft,\nwhich enables the ability to shift from the concrete to an\nabstract, from simplicity to complexity in understanding an\norganizational problem. It enables the HR manager to shift\nperspectives and obtain a totality of view connecting history,\nbiography, social structure, and personal framing.\nThe model provided in this article attempts to locate vari-\nous dimensions of the personnel function at various positions\nin the model from traditional personnel to a globally more\nimaginative HR. It is in the latter that arguably deeper think-\ning is required because of the greater complexity of the HR\nfunction. In this situation, the HR professional needs to\ndevelop approaches better suited to his or her organization,\nits business goals, culture, and its competitive context. This\nrequires more imaginative thinking at macro and micro lev-\nels when constructing HR policies and practices for cross-\ncultural people management and development.\nTo develop a managerial imagination in HR professionals\nboth at a domestic and international level, the ideas under\ndiscussion could be developed into a craft involving tools for\nimagination to help support changes in HRM. The research\nquestions that might be asked may include the following:\nIn what ways do you resolve an HR problem using a men-\ntal or visual image?\nIn what kind of situation is your imaginative decision pro-\ncess triggered?\nHow is it possible to debate about storytelling in a discus-\nsion on imagination?\nHow is it possible to use metaphors to better understand\norganizational problems?\nHow can we develop more unconventional, original, or\ninventive ways at work? Can you visually describe such a\nsituation in the past and future?\nIn conclusion, it appears that compared with other forms\nof nonlinear thinking such as creativity and intuition, imagi-\nnation has had less consideration and "
