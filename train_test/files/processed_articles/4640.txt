While some argued that later marriages reflected mod-\nern career women's more \"individualized\" attitudes (Beck &\nthis was caused by men's discrimination against high-achiev-\ning women who deviated from traditional domestic roles,\nthus rendering them \"leftover\" in the marriage market To,\nlater marriages, it would lead to the same consequence--the\nZhang & Sun, 2014). Given that marriage was a collective\naffair that came with the obligation of furthering one's fam-\nily lineage according to the Confucian tradition, parents still\nexpected their children to marry and to choose a high-status\nmarriage partner who could benefit the whole family and its\nfuture generations. While there had been many studies on the\n\"filial strategies\" performed by Chinese adult children in\nmore traditional areas of filial contention such as elderly care\n(Lan, 2002) and mother- and daughter-in-law relations (Shih\n& Pyke, 2010), there had been none that explored the \"mari-\ntal filial strategies\" of unmarried Chinese women.\nwho made more reflexive choices independent of external\nobligations would be able to enjoy more personal satisfac-\ntion compared with those whose choices were made to sat-\nisfy others. This theory of \"individualization\" incited much\ncontroversy among \"cultural pessimists\" in the West\ncerned that traditional values like social cohesion and filial\npiety would be lost. However, large-scale empirical studies\n1The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\nCorresponding Author:\nSandy To, Department of Sociology, The University of Hong Kong, Room\n913, 9/F, The Jockey Club Tower, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.\nEmail: sandyscto@hku.hk\n\"My Mother Wants Me to Jiaru-haomen\n(Marry Into a Rich and Powerful Family)!\":\nExploring the Pathways to \"Altruistic\nIndividualism\" in Chinese Professional\nWomen's Filial Strategies of Marital\nChoice\n Keywords\nintergenerational relations, filial piety, individualization, sheng n\u00fc (\"leftover women\"), marriage timing, partner choice,\nmatchmaking, grounded theory\n2 SAGE Open\nyounger generation of Chinese individuals actually exempli-\nfied equally strong, if not even stronger, proclivities toward\nfilial piety than older generations. Moreover, Hu and Scott\nfurther showed how Chinese women who enjoyed enhanced\neducational and career opportunities were only \"selectively\ndetraditionalized\" from their \"patrilineal beliefs\" but not\nfrom \"filial piety\" (p. 21). This concurred with To's (- 2013,\n2015) previous research that showed how sheng n\u00fc were\nunrelenting in their struggle against patriarchal constraints\nimposed by their male partners and suitors but were guilt rid-\nden and agonized over how their relationship choices affected\ntheir parents.\nIt is important to point out that having the noble intention\nto observe filial piety did not necessarily mean that one's\nchoices concurred with one's parents'. This could be due to\nintergenerational differences in values. The struggle and\nadjustment that were associated with asserting one's own\nindividual choices and fulfilling one's parents'demands con-\nstituted the core of all \"filial strategies.\" For instance, indi-\nviduals who had conflicting work-lifestyle habits and\nschedules with their parents' were found to hire domestic\nhelpers from their parents' hometowns who spoke the same\nlanguage to take care of them, which would bring about a\nhigher degree of compatibility (Lan, 2002). Or daughters-in-\nlaw who experienced conflicts with their mothers-in-law\nwould perform various filial strategies to alleviate their con-\nflicts, such as acting more docile in front of their mothers-in-\nlaw or asking their husbands to play the mediating role (Shih\nSuffice it to say that the main objective of all filial strate-\ngies was to find the most satisfactory balance between assert-\ning one's own choices and fulfilling filial obligations. Ulrich\nBeck and Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim (2002) proposed the\nconcept of \"altruistic individualism\" that was about\n\"combin(ing) personal freedom with engagement with oth-\ners\" (p. 162). The aim of this article would be to explore the\npathways or \"marital filial strategies\" performed by sheng n\u00fc\nthat could lead to this ideal balance and theoretical condition.\nBy providing an exploratory theoretical account of filial\nstrategies, this study would go beyond a mere descriptive\naccount of filial strategies that was found in previous qualita-\nbegin with a brief history of individualization in the context\nof contemporary China, followed by a discussion of the theo-\nretical framework, methodology, and empirical outcomes.\nIntergenerational Relations in China:\nFrom Familism to Individualism\nPre-modern imperial China had been governed by the\nConfucian philosophical thought for over a thousand years.\nUnder Confucian doctrine, human relations were under-\npinned by a distinct hierarchy, and there were five basic\ntypes of relations known as the \"five cardinal relations\" that\nincluded \"those between father and son, ruler and subject,\nhusband and wife, older and younger brother, and between\npriate behaviors, attitudes, and decorum that were associated\nwith one's position in the social hierarchy was essential for\nmaintaining the whole country's order (Whyte, 2004). The\npecking order of social relations was \"generation, age, and\nsex\" (Baker, 1979) that meant that men and the elderly had\nthe most power, and women and children were in positions\nof subordination. One of the core values in the Confucian\ndoctrine was hence \"filial piety,\" meaning \"children's uncon-\nditional obedience and respect for their parents\" (Yan, 2003,\np. 172). Besides providing physical care and financial sup-\nport to their parents in their old age, individuals were also\nexpected to obey their parents in all aspects of their personal\nlives, such as in their education, career, and marital choices\n(Stockman, 2000). Because parents gave children the \"gift of\nlife\" (Yan, 2003, p. 88), which was the biggest gift one could\never receive in one's lifetime, children were expected to\nspend their entire lives repaying their parents through mate-\nrial and non-material means, and failure to do so would ren-\nder one \"unfilial\" or \"immoral.\"\nHowever, in the late imperial era, educated scholars and\nurbanites became concerned that Confucian familistic values\nhad an insular effect and were a hindrance to China's mod-\nernization on the worldwide economic and political scale,\nand they initiated the May Fourth Movement to fight for\ntheir own rights to make free choices in marriage, education,\nand career (Stockman, 2000). This revolution was unstruc-\ntured and participated in by an intellectual few, but later on in\nthe Maoist socialist era of 1949, there was the New Marriage\nLaw of 1950 that officially abolished arranged marriages and\ngranted all individuals the right to choose their own marriage\npartners. The state also allocated jobs and accommodation to\nindividuals in various urban work units known as danwei,\nand this had greatly diminished their reliance on their parents\nfor economic support. The result was that youths were\nencouraged to live on their own and to make their own per-\nsonal lifestyle decisions independently from their parents at\na much earlier stage in life.\nThese acts of individualization that were set in motion in\nthe Maoist era continued to exert their influences in the\npost-Mao reform era, as individuals were still legally free\nto choose their own marriage partners. Owing to the relax-\nation of migration laws since 1981, it became the common\npractice for many youths to leave their homes and families\nin the countryside to pursue their education and careers in\nthe cities (Yan, 2009). Moreover, China's transition to a\ncapitalist market economy led to the termination of \"pater-\nnalistic\" socialist welfare benefits, and this, according to\nYunxiang Yan (2010), further propelled individuals to\ndevelop their own self-actualizing tendencies for personal\nsurvival and sustenance, albeit this being a more involun-\ntary kind of individualization compared with the \"first\nstage\" of individualization from parental rule that occurred\nin the Maoist era.\nThe Challenge of Pursuing Individual\nChoice and Fulfilling Parental Demands\nDespite past efforts of the Maoist regime to enhance indi-\nviduals'autonomy, and the capitalist economy's push toward\nmore individualized practices, Chinese individuals contin-\nued to observe the traditional virtue of filial piety (Hu &\nbound to be some individual cases of \"unfilial\" behavior\nexemplified by those who chose to pursue their own personal\ngoals at the expense of their parents'feelings and well-being.\nOne such example was where individuals who migrated from\nthe villages to the cities to pursue better educational and\nwork opportunities rarely went back to visit their parents\nNorthern China, he found a number of elderly villagers who\nwere abandoned by their children who left the village and\nnever returned. There were also those whose children did\nreturn, but it was for the utilitarian purpose of asking them\nfor financial support. In the most extreme cases, elderly par-\nents who did not have the means to support their adult chil-\ndren were even physically and emotionally abused (Yan,\nAnother controversial aspect of individualization had to\ndo with the One Child Policy in 1979 and how it produced\ngenerations of \"spoilt\" only children. It was believed that\nparents' excessive doting and concentration of material\nresources on their only children had led them to become self-\ncentered and \"unfilial\" (Fong, 2004). One extreme example\nfound in Fong's (2004) study on only children who came of\nage in the 1990s was when one boy in secondary school\nthreatened to abuse and abandon his mother in the future\nwhen she demanded that he study for his university entrance\nexams, as he was aware that he was his mother's \"only child\"\nand \"only hope.\" However, it was important to note that\nFong's study was conducted on only children who were in\nsecondary school at the time, and it was difficult to tell\nwhether they would grow up to become filial or not based on\ninterviews with them in their childhood. It may well be that\ntheir \"spoilt\" or \"unfilial\" behavior was only a vent for their\nexam frustration and did not reflect their actual behavior\ntoward their parents in their adulthood.\nOn the other side of the coin, there were parents who\nintervened too much in their children's lifestyle choices,\nthus depriving them of any autonomy in their own personal\nlives. One example was when parents sought to control\ntheir daughters' marital choices, which often led to devas-\non a poor Northeastern Chinese village, she found that it\nwas a common practice for parents to arrange for their\ndaughters to go work in a more prosperous city with the\nobjective of finding a man to marry there and consequently\nimproving their whole family's livelihood. Most of these\nattempts were unsuccessful given how low the probability\nrate of \"chancing on\" eligible men was, and thus these\ndaughters returned to their villages with tainted reputations\n(May, 2010). The most unfortunate ones were those who\nfound a village man to marry, but then found themselves\nunsuited to the rustic lifestyle after their stint in the city,\nand they would end up abandoning their husband and chil-\nAs illustrated in the above cases, neither the extremes of\nbeing \"too self-centered\" and \"unfilial\" nor being \"too\nacquiescent\" and \"unreflexive\" would lead to desirable out-\ncomes. This showed how finding the right balance between\nobserving filial obligations and asserting one's own choices\nwas crucial and necessary in modern intergenerational\nrelationships.\nAltruistic Individualism\nIn response to the moral dilemmas induced by individualiza-\ntion, Ulrich Beck and Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim (2002) pro-\nposed the theory of \"altruistic individualism\" that was about\n\"combin(ing) personal freedom with engagement with oth-\ners\" (p. 162). \"Individualization\" was deemed as a kind of\n\"institutionalized individualism\" by Beck and Beck-\nGernsheim, as they believed that it was an inevitable and\ninexorable process that was generated by the wider institu-\ntional changes in highly developed societies under global\ncapitalism. Due to the overdevelopment of late modern soci-\neties, a profusion of unintended consequences had emerged\nthat rendered many previous institutions such as welfare sys-\ntems, educational and occupational systems, and family sys-\ntems dysfunctional. Having lost their previous bearings,\nindividuals were forced to rely on their own \"reflexivity\" and\nself-actualizing spirit to resolve their own practical and exis-\ntential dilemmas. This individualizing process was consid-\nered to be a positive one by Beck and Beck-Gernsheim\n(2002) as they believed that heightened human reflexivity\ncould have the potential to rectify existing socioeconomic\nand ecological problems and improve the overall human\ncondition:\nThe decline of values which cultural pessimists are so fond of\ndecrying is in fact opening up the possibility of escaping from\nthe creed of \"bigger, better, more\" in a period that is living\nbeyond its means ecologically and economically. It is particularly\nthe apostles of the status quo who grumble that individualization\nmeans egocentrism . . . While in the old values systems the ego\nalways had to be subordinated to patterns of the collective (also\nalways designed by individuals), these new orientations towards\nthe \"we\" create something like a cooperative or altruistic\nindividualism. Thinking of oneself and living for others at the\nsame time, once considered a contradiction in terms, is revealed\nas an internal, substantive connection. Living alone means\nBeck and Beck-Gernsheim (2002) also equated individu-\nalization with \"detraditionalization,\" implying that departure\nfrom obsolete moral reference points was not negative as the\n4 SAGE Open\n\"cultural pessimists\" augured, as new values and reference\npoints were now needed to contend with new and ever-pres-\nent dilemmas. They believed that \"reflexivity\" could be\nunleashed when individuals were \"detraditionalized\" from\ntheir outmoded ways, and it was a crucial component that\nwas needed to create new modes of living and thinking. In\nother words, \"reflexive individualization\" was beneficial to\nindividuals on a personal level, as it could lead to heightened\nself-awareness and the resolution of personal and social\ndilemmas. Under the new ethics of \"altruistic individual-\nism,\" both the \"self\" and \"others\" would ultimately benefit,\nand cooperation between the two was the way toward sur-\nvival in the late modern era (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim,\nA Continuum of Individualization\nCarol Smart and Beccy Shipman (2004) conducted a study\non second-generation Indian, Pakistani, and Irish youths in\nBritain to gauge the extent to which they adhered to tradi-\ntional values while growing up in a Western society. Their\narea of inquiry was \"marriage partner choice\" given the\nprominence of marriage in South Asian and Irish cultures\nthat were more family oriented. They found that these youths\nenacted a range of different filial strategies that could be cat-\negorized into three different types on a \"continuum of\nindividualization.\"\nOn one end of the \"individualization continuum\" were the\nyouths who performed the strategy of \"compliance\" by hav-\ning their marriage partners arranged by their parents. When\nasked about his reason for entering into an arranged mar-\nriage, one Pakistani youth responded in a \"matter of fact\"\nway (Smart & Shipman, 2004, p. 9), implying that he never\nthought of what type of wife he wanted to have. It happened\nthat he glimpsed his wife in a family wedding video and mar-\nried her out of convenience (\"I didn't mind actually 'cos I\nactually saw her in my cousin's wedding film so when I was\nasked I said yes I would marry that girl\"; Smart & Shipman,\nchose arranged marriages to be the \"least individualized,\" as\narranged marriages were \"a long way away from the basic\ntenets of the individualization thesis where it (was) held that\npeople (sought) marriage partners who fulfil(ed) a psycho-\nlogical and emotional need or gap in the psyche of the single\nperson\" (p. 9).\nOn the other end of the individualization continuum were\nthe youths who performed the strategy of \"negotiation\" when\ntheir partner choices conflicted with their parents' expecta-\ntions. An Indian youth wanted to marry an Indian girl who\nwas from a different religion, but he knew his parents would\ndisapprove. He hence negotiated his future childrearing\nplans with his parents, which was to pass on his religion to\nhis children to prevent it from being lost. In this way, he\nhoped that he could preserve his relations with his parents\nand his choice of partner.\nAnother case of negotiation was a Pakistani girl who\ndecided that she was not interested in any of the men her\nparents introduced to her within her extended family, so she\nnegotiated with them by citing examples of her cousins who\nwere in love marriages with partners found on their own. By\nnegotiating her choice to have a love marriage with her par-\nents, she hoped to \"sustain good relations\" with them \"while\nembracing some degree of cultural shift\" (Smart & Shipman,\nwith their parents were seen as the \"most individualized,\" as\nthey had chosen partners who could fulfill their own \"psy-\nchological and emotional needs\" instead of the needs of their\nparents.\nIn the middle of the individualization continuum were\nthose youths whose choices \"agreed\" with their parents' by\ncoincidence. For instance, there was an Irish girl who chose\na husband on her own who was also Irish and Catholic, and\nhe happened to fit with her parents' traditional expectations.\nThese individuals were described as \"mildly individualized\"\nin that they demonstrated reflexivity in their partner choices,\nyet they did not have to face the challenge of defending their\nchoices to their parents.\nThe Study: Method and Data\nThe 14 informants of this study were derived from a wider\nstudy of 50 never-married Chinese professional women\ninterviewed in Shanghai from December 2008 to January\n2011. Highly educated unmarried women who were over the\nage of 27 were branded as sheng n\u00fc or \"leftover women\" in\nChina (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of\nChina, 2007), and their marital prospects were highly scruti-\nnized and speculated. The objective of the wider study was to\ninvestigate the marriage views and partner choices of 50\nunmarried professional women using a grounded theory and\nsymbolic interactionist approach ( To, 2013; Corbin &\ntions between the women and their male partners are dis-\ncussed in another article ( To, 2013). This article will discuss\nthe interactions between the women and their parents.\nthey were from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Nanjing, Harbin,\nJiangsu, and Henan. They were all managers and profession-\nals working in Shanghai in the fields of law, finance, adver-\ntising, information technology, media, retail, and\nmanufacturing. Six of them had master's degrees and three\nof them were educated in overseas institutions in the United\nKingdom and Australia. These women who had high educa-\ntional qualifications and professional statuses were represen-\ntative of the new group of upper middle-class elites who\nsuccessfully capitalized on the new opportunities of post-\nreform China (Hanser, 2002) and could afford to make indi-\nThe informants were gathered by snowballing from my\nown personal contacts in Shanghai, and then subsequently\nfrom several professional networking bodies such as the\nShanghai Oxford and Cambridge Society (SOCS; previously\n\"CamOx\"), the Overseas Chinese Network (OCN), which was\na professional networking group for expatriate professionals\nof ethnic Chinese descent, and a private finance professionals'\nnetworking group. The women were interviewed in their\noffices, homes, coffee shops, and restaurants, and their inter-\nviews lasted on average 50 min. All of the interviews were\nrecorded after gaining permission from the informants, and\nthey were transcribed verbatim by me. The informants were\ntold that they would be given pseudonyms to protect their con-\nfidentiality, and that the names of their companies and other\nidentifying information would not be disclosed.\nThe interview schedule was semi-structured, and new\nquestions were added onto it at each new stage according to\nthe evolving theoretical needs of the study (Charmaz, 2006).\nSampling and coding were conducted at four different stages\nin the wider study, and the first three pertained specifically to\ngauging the filial dynamics between the women and their\nparents. The first and last stages were aimed at gauging the\ngender dynamics between the women and their male part-\nners, and are described in detail in another article ( To, 2013).\nIn the pilot stage of sampling, a set of guiding questions\nwere devised to preliminarily gauge the women's marriage\nviews, to \"determine the dimensions and boundaries . . . of\n20 tertiary-educated women and men who were married,\nunmarried, divorced, and separated, and in the age range of\n27 to 59. On coding and analysis of their interviews using\nATLAS.ti (used in all four stages), I narrowed down the sam-\nple to include only never-married women who were in the\nage range of 28 to 33 because these informants had the most\ninteresting and relevant courtship experiences. I eliminated\nthe men from the sample because their views did not contrib-\nute much to the understanding of women's views toward\nmarriage, and I narrowed down the age range because the\ndisparities in marriage views had been too great between dif-\nferent cohorts, and exploring cohort differences was not my\nobjective. Eventually 9 of these 20 informants were retained\nin the final sample.\nThe codes that emerged from the analysis of the first set\nof interviews were found to contain many instances of par-\nents'demands and expectations when it came to the women's\nmarital choices. As a result, new filially related questions\nwere added onto the interview schedule in the second inter-\nviewing stage:\n1. Did their parents want them to get married?\n2. Did their parents ever introduce any partners to them?\nWhat criteria did these men possess?\n3. Did they ever have any conflicts with their parents\nregarding their partner choices?\nIn view of these filially related questions, new informants\nwho encountered parental interventions in the areas of\n\"marriage timing\" and \"partner choice\" were purposefully\nsourced in the manner of \"purposeful sampling\" (Morse,\nall of them were retained in the final sample.\nDeriving the Filial Strategies From the Codes\nEventually, the filial codes that emerged from the first two\nstages of coding were developed into more analytical \"con-\nceptual categories\" with the technique of \"constant compari-\nson\" that entailed comparing the codes and the data against\neach other, the data against data, and codes against codes\nThe main filial conceptual categories were \"parental influ-\nences on women's marriage timing\" and \"parents' emphasis\non the economic status of women's partners.\"2 To fill in the\ndimensions and properties of these two filial conceptual cat-\negories, \"theoretical sampling\" was performed in the third\nstage to \"seek participants who have had particular responses\nto experiences, or in whom particular concepts appear(ed)\nstage, 17 informants who had the more specific experience\nof \"matchmaking\" in which parents introduced partners to\nthem of similar family and economic background were inter-\nviewed, and all of them were retained in the final sample.\nThe fourth and final stage of theoretical sampling was\nconducted to fill in the properties and dimensions of the gen-\nder conceptual categories,3 and women who were at the top\nof their professions were sourced, as they were postulated to\nhave the most difficulties in bridging their economic gaps\nwith their male suitors and partners. Eight women were\ninterviewed in this final stage, and a total of 50 informants\nwere gathered in all four stages.\nFinally, all of the filial conceptual categories and remain-\ning filial concepts were integrated into the conditional/con-\nsequential matrix (Corbin & Strauss, 2008; Strauss & Corbin,\n1994) that elucidated their relationships and associations.\nThe two main filial conceptual categories of \"parental influ-\nences on women's marriage timing\" and \"parents' emphasis\non the economic status of women's partners\" were the \"filial\nconstraints\" against which the women made their marital\nchoices. In response, the women enacted various \"filial strat-\negies\" that could be broadly categorized into \"deference,\"\n\"negotiation,\" and \"coincidence.\" For instance, when in the\nface of the filial constraint of one's parents disagreeing with\none's choice of partner who had lower economic status, some\nwomen would heed their parents'demands and break up with\ntheir partner (\"deference\"), some would break up with their\npartner because they shared the same views as their parents\n(\"coincidence\"), or some would try to persuade their parents\nto accept their partner (\"negotiation\").\nAdopting Smart and Shipman's (2004) \"continuum of\nindividualization,\" the filial strategy of \"deference\" would\nbe found at the \"least individualized\" end; \"coincidence\"\nwould be found in the middle, representing \"neutrality\"; and\n6 SAGE Open\n\"negotiation\" would be found at the \"most individualized\"\nend (see Figure 1).\nGiven how this study's aim was to illustrate the process of\nfinding a balance between asserting one's individual choices\nand fulfilling parental demands, or achieving \"altruistic indi-\nvidualism,\" only those informants (14) who experienced\nsome form of filial contention in their marital choices in the\nareas of \"marriage timing\" and/or \"partner choice\" would be\nincluded, and their filial strategies of \"deference\" and/or\n\"negotiation\" (not \"coincidence\") would be discussed below.\nFindings\n\"I Went Matchmaking for My Parents' Sake!\"--\n\"Deference\" as a Filial Strategy\nActually I didn't really intend to find someone in the first place,\nbut my parents wanted me to get married very early. When I\ndidn't have a boyfriend, my mom would keep saying to me,\n\"You're getting older and it'll be very difficult to find someone!\"\nAnd that if I don't get married, I'll be very lonely for the rest of\nmy life. So she hoped that I could find someone very early on. I\nwent matchmaking for my parents' sake, so that they won't\nworry. I personally think that I'm happy being by myself. I have\na lot of friends and activities. I'm living a happy life. (Have you\nexplained to your mom that you're happy being alone?) It won't\nwork, she won't understand . . . We're from different generations\nso it's difficult to make her understand. (Vera, 30, technology\nanalyst)\nVera, a 30-year-old technology analyst in a multinational\nbeverage company, was found to have had the same \"mar-\nriage conversation\" with her parents as many of the unmar-\nried women. It could be seen how marriage was still\nconsidered to be a significant rite of passage that most\nChinese adult children were expected to follow in the eyes of\ntheir parents. Women were especially expected to marry, as\nthey traditionally belonged in the domestic sphere and were\nregarded as dependents of men. Hence, Vera's parents who\nwere more traditional would expect her to follow the tradi-\ntional path, and their biggest fear would be that she did not\nmarry and had no one to take care of her in the future.\nVera, who also planned to marry eventually, did not plan\nto do so that soon. But knowing how her parents felt worried\nabout her future, she was willing to \"defer\" to their expecta-\ntions to expedite her marriage timing. Vera's parents also\nworried that the longer she waited, the more difficult it would\nbe for her to find a man. Seeing how Vera was already 30\nyears old and without any marriage prospects, her parents\narranged for her to go to more than 10 matchmaking ses-\nsions. As it was, Vera did not manage to find a partner at\nmatchmaking, and she ended up finding someone on her own\non a matchmaking website. This greatly satisfied her parents,\nas they were relieved that their daughter's marital future\nwould soon be secured.\nGiselle, a Hong Konger based in Shanghai for the past 5\nyears running her family's retail business, had not been in a\nserious relationship since she moved there. Although she\neventually wanted to get married and have a family, she felt\nthat it was not the right time given how she had just achieved\nsome success in her career. It had taken her a long time to\nlearn the ropes of her family business since she moved to\nShanghai, and now was finally the time she could savor the\nfruits of her hard work and bask in the self-sufficiency that\ncame with it. But apparently, her father had a different opin-\nion, as he thought that a woman's career was nowhere near\nthe importance of her marriage. He felt tremendously guilty\nfor having \"jeopardized\" his daughter's marriage chances by\nasking her to devote herself to developing his business.\nGiselle took it as a sign that he wanted her to shift her priori-\nties, and she \"deferred\" to his wishes:\nMy dad usually doesn't talk about these things, but last year he\ntold me that he thinks he spoiled my chances by sending me to\nwork in Shanghai. I said no, because I like working here. I\nwasted a bit of time at the beginning but I was very satisfied\nwhen I saw the results. I've changed a lot. I know what I want\nmore and I won't wait for other people to give me happiness.\nI'm happy that I can do my own thing. That brings me happiness\ntoo. But after my dad talked to me about it--with tears in his\neyes--I started to seriously think about my love life, if I should\nreally start dating more.

I've been to matchmaking three to\nfour times. Men look at women's appearance first, to see if\nthey're pretty or not. For the women, they don't even have to ask\nabout the economic background of the men, as the introducer\nwould automatically tell them that this guy is very accomplished,\nhe's from what university, what education level, and if he has a\nhouse or a car. In matchmaking, you put all of each other's\ncriteria on the table. And if they fit your requirement, then you\ngo on to see if your personalities are compatible and if you can\ndevelop feelings for each other. I think it's too practical that way.\n(Winnie, 28, assistant brand manager)\nEven though Winnie was against the pragmatic nature of\nmatchmaking, and would rather find a partner on her own,\nshe still \"deferred\" to her mother's demand and went \"three\nto four times.\" However, Winnie's matchmaking episode did\nnot end here, as it would be revealed later on that she adopted\na different filial strategy when facing her mother's formida-\nble partner choice criteria.\nThe same could not be said for Nancy, a 28-year-old IT\nconsultant, as she \"deferred\" to her parents' choice of man\nwhom she did not find so agreeable:\nThey're really satisfied with him but I don't think we are the\nsame type of person. (Why?) Mainly because of work nature. He\nworks in a local company. His way of thinking and the situations\nhe has to handle are completely different. At my age I can't\nspare a lot of time and energy to try to understand what he's\nthinking about. I just think that he's very different from me in\nthe way he thinks and does things. (Do you see each other all the\ntime?) Not a lot. We talk a bit every day and see each other once\na week. (Only once a week?) Yes, because I think we both have\nthe same mentality; that we're not that compatible, but because\nour parents introduced . . .. (Nancy, 28, IT consultant)\nNancy confessed that she and her boyfriend both felt that\nthey were not that suitable for each other, and that they were\nonly together because their parents were good friends. It was\nobvious that Nancy would not choose someone like him if\nthey had met under normal circumstances:\nMy parents know his parents. They used to be my father's old\nschoolmates, and he knows that they are very good, kind people.\nThey think that if I marry into their family I will have very kind\nand honest mother and father-in-laws. Their way of thinking is\nvery simple. (Nancy, 28, IT consultant)\nNancy believed that obeying her parents in every aspect\nof her personal life was the best form of repayment for their\npainstaking upbringing. This was seen as a \"purest\" form of\nfilial piety where one considered it to be their lifelong objec-\ntive to repay their parents for their \"gift of life\" (cf. Yan,\n2003, p. 88). For the sake of her parents, Nancy was willing\nto sublimate her individual desires, but having made such\ncompromises for the collective good, she could not help but\nfeel ambivalent about her future marital happiness:\nI can give myself time but my parents would be under a lot of\npressure. (So you will put their wishes first?) Yes, because my\nparents sacrificed a lot for me and my sister. They've given us all\nthe money they have. I don't need to find someone who's\nextremely compatible with me, or someone who's exactly like\nmyself. I don't think that's necessary. I think that what my parents\nsay usually make a lot of sense. (Do you think you'll be happier\nmarried than you are now?) I don't know, it's very hard to say. It\nmay be better or it may be worse. I can't just run in one direction.\nI have to learn how to be a good partner, a good mother, and I\nhave to learn how to be accountable to my parents and society. I\nhave to consider these things. (Nancy, 28, IT consultant)\n\"Luckily My Family Wasn't Very Hard-Headed\nand I've Always Been Allowed to Express My\nViews\"--\"Negotiation\" as a Filial Strategy\nYes, my mother does want me to jiaru-haomen (marry into a\nrich and powerful family). Those families would usually want to\nmanage their daughters-in-law's life paths. They would tell them\nwhat to do, like where to go study and where to go to work. I\ncan't accept that. (Ingrid, 28, accountant)\nIngrid, a 28-year-old accountant with a law master's\ndegree, had a mother who had incredibly high expectations\nfor her partner's economic criteria. Ingrid would rather find\nsomeone who was from a more similar family and economic\nbackground, as she thought that they could find more affinity\nwith each other in terms of lifestyle and values, but her\nmother believed that hypergamy, or marrying up, could bet-\nter secure her daughter's future livelihood.\nIngrid's mother would hence \"sift through the candidates\nfirst\" to pick out only those who fulfilled the \"most basic\"\ncriteria of \"having a house and a car.\" Ingrid was against the\npragmatic nature of matchmaking, but she still went to sat-\nisfy her mother. Eventually, she did manage to meet a candi-\ndate whom she liked, but her mother was still not satisfied,\nand asked her to go meet even more well-off men:\nMy father is pleased because his daughter found someone she\nlikes. But my mother still thinks that I can find someone better.\nShe wants me to observe a bit longer and get to know him more.\nActually when we first met, my mother was still introducing\nmen with better criteria to me. There was one who liked me but\nI didn't like him, so I told my mother that I like the other one\nmore. But that guy was very accomplished. He had a house, a\ncar, and was a senior manager in a big company. (Ingrid, 28,\naccountant)\n8 SAGE Open\nEven though Ingrid eventually \"negotiated\" with her\nmother to retain her original partner choice, she still went to\nmeet the other well-off candidates on her mother's demand.\nShe could not help stressing the impressive economic criteria\nof one of the other candidates, not because she admired him,\nbut because she knew that choosing him would please her\nmother more. Nevertheless, after much struggle between\nretaining her own personal choice and satisfying her mother,\nIngrid decided that fulfilling her mother's \"most basic\" part-\nner choice criteria of \"having a house and a car\" (which her\nboyfriend had because he was \"sifted through\" by her mother)\nwas already good enough in terms of showing her filiality.\nIn the last section, Winnie was found to \"defer\" to her\nmother's demand for her to go matchmaking, even when it\nwas against her own preference. However, when it came\ndown to her actual partner choice, she refused to \"defer\" to\nher mother's choice of a nouveau riche candidate:\nI met this guy who was very accomplished. He had his own\nbusiness in Shanghai and had three to four houses, all luxury\napartments. He had many expensive cars . . . I went out with him\nfor a few times; three times in total, and then I said I can't do it\nanymore. (You had nothing to say?) Having nothing to say was\none thing . . . the feeling I got from him was that he thought that\na girl like me with rather good criteria would be looking for a\nrich man to marry, that I was after his money. He kept bragging\nabout how rich he was in front of me. He would tell me what\nbrands of clothes he bought; that it cost several tens of thousands\n(of yuan), and that he was the VIP of this brand, and he gave\nthem several hundreds of thousands (of yuan) in business. I\nwasn't very happy with all of that. He was quite inconsiderate.\nHe would ask me to go buy something with him. (Is it for you?)\nNo, not for me, but for himself. He'd take me to a brand name\nstore to go shopping for himself, like LV (Louis Vuitton) or\nBally. Even if he did buy things for me, I wouldn't dare accept\nas my mom would scold me. I'm not that greedy. Whenever\nwe'd go into a shop, those salespeople would give us weird\nlooks, like we're from different worlds. He'd act like a big boss,\ntelling people to get this and that for him . . . He took off his\nshoes. After that I really thought I couldn't do this anymore. He\nacted like he owned the shop. There were some chairs in the\nshop, and mannequins were sitting on it, with scarves and other\naccessories. He'd sit on top of them. There were sofas in the\nshop as well, he should've sat on those. It was so embarrassing.\nThe salespeople would stare at us. I'd ask him to sit on the sofa,\nbut he wouldn't listen to me. I really hated that. After that I told\nmy mom that I couldn't see him again. She said forget it, as it\nwas all too scary. (Winnie, 28, assistant brand manager)\nEventually, Winnie decided that she could no longer toler-\nate the vulgar and inconsiderate actions of her nouveau riche\nsuitor, and she \"negotiated\" with her mother to terminate her\ncourtship. She realized that her mother cared more about her\nfeelings than her being with someone who was extremely\nwealthy, and that her mother would never force her to go\nalong with something she felt so uncomfortable with, if only\nshe had told her earlier. However, the fact that it had taken as\nmuch as three whole dates for Winnie to decide to terminate\nher courtship with the insufferable man showed how she\nreally took her mother's wishes into account. In the end, after\nheartfelt communication, both Winnie and her mother came\nto the conclusion that someone like that would not be a good\nchoice for Winnie, no matter how superior his economic cri-\nteria were.\nThere were cases where women who met partners on their\nown did not satisfy their parents' partner choice criteria. One\nsuch case was Bernice, a 28-year-old telecommunications\nmanager who met her boyfriend at work. Unlike those who\nmet their partners at matchmaking, it was more difficult to\nguarantee that partners met on one's own would fulfill the\nspecific criteria that parents looked for. Bernice's boyfriend\nwas an accomplished software engineer, but her parents were\nlooking for someone who was from a more prominent family\nbackground, given how prestigious theirs was. The lacking\nof this criterion in Bernice's boyfriend caused many conflicts\nbetween her and her parents over the years:\nB: At first they didn't quite accept my boyfriend, so when\nthey heard we broke up, they were so happy and imme-\ndiately introduced other guys to me. But afterwards\nthey gave up because they knew we always got back\ntogether.\nS: They didn't like your boyfriend before?\nB: Yes, for a lot of reasons. They think he's a bit effemi-\nnate; also because our two families aren't very men-\ndang-hudui (of similar backgrounds).\nS: Yours is better?\nB: Yes, they want me to find someone who's from a simi-\nlar or better background.\nS: But he's capable himself, no?\nB: Yes, but my family looks at family background more. I\ndon't know if it's like this in other places, but over\nhere, marriage is an affair between two families. Even\nif they think this person is good, they want to know\nmore about his family, where they're from and what\nhis parents do.\nS: What do his parents do?\nB: His parents run a store.\nS: What do your parents do?\nB: My grandfather is deceased, but if he were here, we'd\nbe a typical \"government-business\" combination. My\ngrandfather was a government official and my grand-\nmother does business. We're still running the business\nnow. (Bernice, 28, telecommunications manager)\nOver the years, Bernice's parents had introduced many\nother candidates from more prominent family backgrounds\nto her, even during the course of her relationship with her\nboyfriend. However reluctant she was, Bernice still agreed to\nmeet these other men, which was a sign of \"giving face\"' to\nher parents and taking their wishes into account. But eventu-\nally, she mustered up the confidence to \"negotiate\" with her\nparents about their different values and to make them under-\nstand why she chose her boyfriend:\nI don't care that much about where they're from or what their\nfamily background is. I just look at that person himself, whether\nI like him or not. I never ask about what their family does or if\nthey're rich or not. My ex-boyfriend was even worse off than\nthis one! (Bernice, 28, telecommunications manager)\nBernice's \"negotiation\" strategy paid off, and she was\nfinally able to persuade her parents to stop introducing other\nmen to her. Admittedly, Bernice had to have had consider-\nably reasonable and open-minded parents who were willing\nto negotiate with her in the first place. If her parents ada-\nmantly insisted that she find a man from a more prominent\nfamily background, she would have had a much more diffi-\ncult time struggling to assert her own personal choice and\nfulfilling her filial obligations. Perhaps it could be surmised\nthat her parents' living far away in Jiangsu made them more\ntolerant and understanding of her situation, as they did not\nhave a chance to see her and her boyfriend that often. As it\nwas, their distance could be said to have played a large part\nin alleviating their filial conflict:\nActually I was the one who insisted in the first place. My family\nwas quite against it, they wanted to break us up. I was very\npersistent about it. Luckily my family wasn't very hard-headed\nand I've always been allowed to express my views.Anyway, I'm\nin Shanghai and they don't come to Shanghai that often.\n(Bernice, 28, telecommunications manager)\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe two main areas of filial contention faced by 14 sheng\nn\u00fc were \"marriage timing\" and \"partner choice.\" It was\nfound that their parents generally wanted them to marry\nearlier and to find a husband with high economic status, but\nthis may not cohere with their own life plans or partner\nchoice criteria. To resolve their filial contentions, the\nwomen performed the \"marital filial strategies\" of \"defer-\nence\" and/or \"negotiation.\"\nIt was interesting to note that filial contentions in \"mar-\nriage timing\" and \"partner choice\" elicited different filial\nstrategies. Most women who chose to \"defer\" to their parents'\nmatchmaking demands (to marry earlier or to find a high(er)\nstatus partner) would \"negotiate\" their actual partner choices\nin the end. For instance, Winnie who thought that the idea of\nmatchmaking was too pragmatic (like \"buying pork from the\nbutcher's\") still went to satisfy her mother, but she refused to\nyield to her mother's choice of a nouveau riche candidate,\nand negotiated with her mother to terminate her courtship.\nSimilarly, Bernice and Ingrid also went matchmaking at their\nparents'/mother's demand, but ended up negotiating with\nthem to retain their choices of less prominent or well-off men\nthan their parents/mother hoped for. These instances of\n\"deferring\" first and then going on to \"negotiate\" suggested\nhow filial obligations were observed to a certain extent to\nwhich the women felt were reasonable and acceptable, but\nthey would not go as far as to compromise their own inner-\nmost needs and wants. This satisfactory balance that was\nfound between filial obligations and personal choices exem-\nplified the ideal condition of \"altruistic individualism\" that\nentailed \"combin(ing) personal freedom with engagement\nshowing a high degree of individual reflexivity regarding\ntheir own partner choices, these women would be on the\n\"most individualized\" end of the \"integrated continuum of\nindividualization\" (see Figure 2).\nIn contrast, if \"deferring\" and then \"negotiating\" demon-\nstrated the merits of achieving \"altruistic individualism,\"\nthose who performed the filial strategy of \"deference\" in\nboth \"marriage timing\" and \"partner choice\" would be seen\ngested, they would not be postulated to achieve much indi-\nvidual satisfaction from choices that were made to satisfy\nothers instead of themselves.\nNancy was an example of one who \"deferred\" to her par-\nents' partner choice even when she knew he was \"not her\ntype.\" If given the choice, she would have chosen someone\nwho was more compatible with her in terms of personality\nand work interests. However, she chose to fulfill her parents'\nexpectations instead of her own as a form of repayment for\ntheir lifelong upbringing. Repaying parents for their \"gift of\nlife\" was deemed as a \"purest\" and most traditional form of\nfilial piety (Yan, 2003, p. 88). Nancy's abidance by this vir-\ntue was indeed invaluable and commendable, especially\nbeing someone from the \"individualized\" modern genera-\ntion. However, on the downside, she had effectively let her\n\"obligations to defer to parental wishes trump (her) own per-\ndeferring completely to her parents' partner choice, she\nCombinations of Deference-Deference Deference Deference-Negotiation\nMarital Filial Strategies:\nDegree of\nIndividualization lowest middle highest\nFigure 2. Integrated continuum of individualization.\nwould be on the \"least individualized\" end of the \"integrated\ncontinuum of individualization\" (see Figure 2).As Smart and\nShipman (2004) maintained that arranged marriages were \"a\nlong way away from the basic tenets of the individualization\nthesis where it (was) held that people (sought) marriage part-\nners who fulfil(ed) a psychological and emotional need or\ngap in the psyche of the single person\" (p. 9), it was under-\nstandable that Nancy would have serious doubts about her\nfuture marital happiness. (\"I don't know, it's very hard to say.\nIt may be better or it may be worse.\")\nThere were those who performed the filial strategy of\n\"deference\" (only), but did not exactly belong in the category\nof \"least individualized.\" Those were Vera and Giselle who\n\"deferred\" to their parents'/father's wishes to expedite their\nmarriage timing even when they felt unready to do so at their\nown pace. Vera went matchmaking for over 10 times on her\nparents' demand, and eventually found a partner on a match-\nmaking website on her own. This satisfied her parents all the\nsame, as they appreciated the idea of her getting married over\nany specific partner choice criteria. Giselle's father did not\nhave anyone to introduce to her, so she turned to her friends\nfor help. So far, it was not known whether Giselle would suc-\nceed in finding a partner through her friends' introductions.\nBecause Giselle had not reached the stage where she had\na partner for her parents to evaluate, she did not need to\n\"negotiate\" or \"defer\" in terms of \"partner choice,\" and\nwould therefore be deemed as \"mildly un-individualized\"\nbased on her strategy of \"deference\" in \"marriage timing\"\n(see Figure 2). However, if she did find a partner in the\nfuture, there would be possibilities of gravitating toward the\n\"most individualized\" end if her parents disagreed with her\npartner choice and she chose to \"negotiate\" with them, or\ntoward the \"least individualized\" end if she chose to \"defer\"\nto her parents' partner choice and compromise her own.\nThus, it could be seen how for some women who were in the\nbeginning stage of their marital trajectory (at \"marriage tim-\ning\"), their individualizing tendencies would be open to\nmuch variation. In other words, \"mildly un-individualized\"\nwould not necessarily be their final destination. But for those\nlike Vera who did reach the latter stage of her marital trajec-\ntory wherein she found a partner on a matchmaking website\nwho satisfied her parents, \"mildly un-individualized\" would\nin fact be her final destination, as she did not face filial con-\ntention in the area of \"partner choice\" and hence did not have\nthe option to further \"defer\" or \"negotiate.\"\nIt was interesting to note that not one of these women\nabove \"negotiated\" in the first stage of \"marriage timing,\"\nwhich could well suggest that all of them eventually wanted\nto get married, despite feeling \"not quite ready\" or being\nagainst the pragmatic nature of matchmaking. Hence, it did\nnot take much swaying by parents for one to decide to expe-\ndite one's marriage timing, and \"deferring\" would not be\nseen as conflicting too much with one's long-term marital\ngoals. However, when it came down to actual \"partner\nchoice,\" only the staunchest observers of filiality would\n\"defer\" to parental expectations and sacrifice their own need\nfor \"emotional and psychological\" fulfillment (Smart &\nIn the past, there had been many studies that investigated\nthe filial strategies of modern Chinese individuals in the\nareas of caring for elderly parents (Lan, 2002) or relating\nwith in-laws (Shih & Pyke, 2010), but there had been none\nthat investigated the filial strategies of unmarried Chinese\nprofessional women known as sheng n\u00fc or \"leftover women\"\nwho faced filial contentions in their marital choices. This\nstudy has provided both an empirical and theoretical account\nof the \"marital filial strategies\" performed by sheng n\u00fc and\ntheir pathways to achieving \"altruistic individualism,\" that\nis, finding the most satisfactory balance between their own\nindividual choices and fulfilling filial obligations. On a wider\nlevel, their experiences could serve as an exemplar for all\nmodern Chinese individuals who strove to conduct congenial\nfilial relationships without compromising their own ideals.\nNotes\n1. These questions were generated from a review of the literature\non the impact of women's economic status on their marriage\nchances, in line with the wider study's objective of explor-\ning single professional women's marriage views and partner\nchoice. These guiding questions were as follows: (a) Did the\nwomen want to get married in the first place? (b) If yes, then\nwhat obstacles did they face? (c) What types of partners were\nthey looking for?\n2. Other lesser filial conceptual categories were \"parents against\nWestern partner,\" \"parents against partner being too old,\" and\n\"parents against partner being divorced/having children from\nprevious marriage.\" In comparison, the categories related to\n\"partner's economic status,\" and the women's own \"marriage\ntiming\" far outweighed the others and were thus chosen for\nanalysis.\n3. The gender conceptual categories were \"men's discrimination\nagainst accomplished women\" and \"men's control over wom-\n"
