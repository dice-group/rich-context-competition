Frequency-domain analysis showed a significant decrease\nin oscillatory components attributable to sympathetic activity (LF%) and a significant decrease in\nlow frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio following etanercept therapy.\nConclusion: Treatment with etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis could\naffect cardiovascular autonomic regulation, and subsequently reduce cardiovascular risk.\n",

All patients\nprovided written informed consent, and the\nstudy was conducted in accordance with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.20 The requirement\nfor ethics committee approval was waived.\u00d5\nData collection\nData regarding clinical, cardiovascular and\ndermatological history, sex, age and waist\ncircumference were collected from each\npatient. Laboratory parameters including\nblood lipids and glucose were recorded,\nand body mass index and PASI calculated.\nHeart rate, blood pressure and a 5-min\ndigital electrocardiogram were obtained from\nall patients at baseline (1\u00ad7 days before initi-\nation of treatment) and at 24 weeks after\netanercept initiation. Etanercept was self-\nadministered at a dosage of 50 mg twice\nweekly for the first 12 weeks (induction\nperiod) and weekly thereafter.\nHRV analyses\nData generated from the 5-min digital elec-\ntrocardiogram were analysed with\nCardiolab\u00d5 CE pocket PC ECG\nsoftware (Xai-Medica, Kharkov, Ukraine).\nLinear methods including time-domain and\nfrequency-domain analyses were used for\ndirect estimation of HRV. For time-domain\nanalyses, statistical characteristics of\ndynamic row of cardiointervals included\nstandard deviation of all normal-to-normal\n[NN] intervals (SDNN) and root mean\nsquare successive difference between adja-\ncent NNs (RMSSD). Frequency-domain\nanalysis of HRV describes the periodic\noscillations of the heart rate signal at differ-\nent frequencies and amplitudes. The power\nspectrum can be classified into two principal\n44 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1S)\nbands: low frequency (LF) and high fre-\nquency (HF). The HF component is\ngenerally defined as a marker of vagal\nmodulation. The LF component is modu-\nlated by both the sympathetic and the\nparasympathetic nervous systems. The LF/\nHF ratio is considered as an index of\nsympatho\u00advagal balance.21\nStatistical analyses\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD or n (%).\nBetween-timepoint differences in quantita-\ntive variables were analysed using paired\nt-test. Statistical analyses were performed\nusing SigmaStat\u00d5 version 3.5 (Systat\nSoftware, Point Richmond, CA, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. P-values < 0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 19 patients (11 male/\nrange 18\u00ad32 years), all of whom completed\nthe 24-week treatment period.

To the best of our knowledge, there\nhave been no studies considering the role of\nthe autonomic cardiac regulation in this\nscenario.\nWe used HRV analyses to assess the\neffects of biological drugs on the cardiovas-\ncular system, and found that etanercept\nmodified autonomic cardiovascular regula-\ntion, and consequently CVD risk, in our\npatient population. Frequency-domain ana-\nlysis showed a significant decrease in oscil-\nlatory components attributable to\nsympathetic activity (LF%) and a significant\ndecrease in the LF/HF ratio, universally\nconsidered an index of sympatho\u00advagal\nIn conclusion, our preliminary data sug-\ngest that etanercept therapy could modify\nautonomic cardiovascular regulation in\npatients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.\nIt is possible that etanercept may influence\nthe cardiovascular risk associated with psor-\niasis. The close relationship between psoria-\nsis and CVD emphasises the importance of\ncardiovascular screening in patients with\npsoriasis, especially in the presence of risk\nfactors.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nEditorial assistance was provided by Gayle\nRobins on behalf of HPS\u00adHealth Publishing\nand Services Srl and funded by Pfizer Italia.\nReferences\n1.
