This\nstudy indicates the need for consideration of common causes of non-fatal injury, especially falls.\nThe high number of deaths from injury among US children\nhas been a major factor in prioritizing injury as a public\nhealth problem. While injuries are the leading cause of\ndeath among US children between 1 and 14 years of age,1\nthese deaths only represent a small fraction of those injured.2\nInjury accounts for one third of all emergency department\nvisits among children younger than 15 years, making injury\nthe leading cause of emergency department visits in this age\ngroup.3 The distribution by cause of non-fatal injuries has not\nreceived the same consideration as that of fatalities when set-\nting public health priorities for research and programs.\nCurrently available fatal and non-fatal injury data from\nnationally representative surveillance systems can now\nenhance our ability to consider both. This study compared the\nleading causes of fatal and non-fatal injury among children in\nthe US.\nMETHODS\nData were obtained from the Web based Injury Statistics and\nQuery System (WISQARS), a Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) web based interactive platform recently\nenhanced to include non-fatal injuries (http://www.cdc.gov/\nncipc/wisqars). WISQARS allows for querying by age,\nrace/ethnicity, sex, state (fatal data only), year, injury cause,\ninjury intent, and disposition at emergency department\ndischarge (non-fatal data only). National mortality data from\n1999 (the latest reporting year available) were based on the\nNational Vital Statistics System of the National Center for\nHealth Statistics, CDC.4 Annual non-fatal national estimates\nof hospital emergency department visits were based on the\nNational Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury\nProgram (NEISS-AIP), which is a probability sample rep-\nresentative of US emergency departments for the first 12\nNEISS-AIP is a collaborative effort between the National\nCenter for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC and the US\nConsumer Product Safety Commission.\nWe reviewed data for children younger than 15 years of age\nto determine the leading causes of fatal and non-fatal injury,\nregardless of intent. For each cause, we assessed cause specific\nlethality by computing the ratio of non-fatal injuries\n(expressed as injury related emergency department visits;\nIEDV) to the number of deaths (non-fatal to fatal ratio, NF:F).\nAge specific mortality rates were calculated using 1999 US\nCensus Bureau population estimates. Non-fatal injury rates\nwere calculated using the average US Census Bureau popula-\nspanned two calendar years. Coefficients of variations and\n95% confidence intervals around national estimates of\nnumbers and rates were calculated using a direct variance\nestimation procedure that accounts for sample weights and\nthe stratified sample design.7\nRESULTS\nThe 58.6 million US children younger than 15 years of age\naccounted for an estimated 7.1 million IEDV (95% confidence\nmonth period. This resulted in an overall NF:F of 966 IEDV:1\ndeath.\nThe leading causes of pediatric fatalities and non-fatal IEDV\ndiffered substantially (table 1). Among injury related fatali-\nties, those related to motor vehicle traffic occupant deaths,\ninhalation/suffocations, and drownings accounted for 50% of\nall deaths. The respective NF:F for motor vehicle traffic occu-\naccounted for 971 deaths and was the most lethal cause (NF:F\n= 6:1). Among non-fatal injuries, falls were the leading cause,\nwith more than 2.4 million IEDVs. This was almost 40% higher\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAbbreviations: CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; GES,\nNational Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System; ICD,\nInternational Classification of Diseases; IEDV, injury related emergency\ndepartment visits; NEISS-AIP, National Electronic Injury Surveillance\nSystem-All Injury Program; NF:F, non-fatal to fatal ratio; NHAMCS,\nNational Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey; WISQARS, Web\nbased Injury Statistics and Query System\nSee end of article for\nauthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Michael F Ballesteros,\nDivision of Unintentional\nInjury Prevention, National\nCenter for Injury Prevention\nand Control, Centers for\nDisease Control and\nHighway, NE, Mailstop\nmballesteros@cdc.gov\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nthan the second leading cause, struck by/against (1.8 million\nIEDVs); however, these two causes were substantially less\nexertion accounted for 448 000 IEDVs, but was not associated\nwith any deaths.\nTransportation related injuries, which included injuries to\nmotor vehicle traffic occupants, pedal cyclists (principally\nbicyclists), and pedestrians, were an important cause of pedi-\natric injury morbidity and mortality. In this age group,\nnon-fatal pedal cycle injuries resulted in about 25% more\nIEDV than motor vehicle occupant injuries. Pedestrian injuries\nwere the most lethal transportation cause (NF:F = 67:1).\nInjury mortality rates and IEDV rates varied by age and\ncause (tables 2 and 3). Motor vehicle traffic occupant mortality\nrates were highest for infants and 14 year olds. Infants\nyounger than 1 year and, to a lesser degree, children older than\n13 years had high suffocation fatality rates. Drowning and\npedestrian mortality rates were highest for children between 1\nand 2 years of age. IEDV rates for falls were highest among\nchildren between 1 and 2 years of age. Struck by/against IEDV\nrates were highest among children between 1 and 3 years old,\nand after 11 years of age, it was the leading cause of IEDV. In\ncontrast, overexertion IEDV rates generally increased with\nage. Among transportation related causes, motor vehicle\nTable 1 Leading cause of injury related emergency department visits (IEDV) and\ninjury related deaths, ages 0\u00ad14, US\nIEDV\nrank\nFatal\nrank Injury cause No of IEDV*\nNo of\nfatalities IEDV/1 death\n7 1 MV traffic occupant|\nBased on 1999 National Vital Statistics data.\nIn WISQARS fatal data are included with natural/environment.\n\u00a7Includes all pedal cylcists (traffic, non-traffic, unspecified).\n|\n|Non-fatals include only motor vehicle (MV) traffic occupants (excludes non-traffic and unknowns), fatals\ninclude MV traffic occupant and unspecified traffic fatalities, of which most were occupant related.12\n\u00b6In WISQARS fatal data are included with suffocation.\n**Includes motorcycle, railway, and air transport crashes.\nIncludes all pedestrians (traffic, non-traffic, unspecified).\nIncludes handgun, rifle, shotgun, BB gun, and airgun.\nTable 2 Annual injury related fatality rates* per 100000 population by cause,\nAge (years)\nMV traffic\noccupant\nInhalation/\nsuffocation Drowning Pedestrians Fire/burn Firearms\n*Rates calculated from 1999 National Vital Statistics data and 1999 population estimates.\nIncludes motor vehicle (MV) traffic occupants and unspecified traffic fatalities, of which most were occupant\nrelated.\nIncludes all pedestrians (traffic, non-traffic, unspecified).\n\u00a7Rate is unstable because of a sample size of fewer than 20 deaths.\n174 Ballesteros, Schieber, Gilchrist, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\noccupant IEDV rates increased with age, while the pedal cycle\nIEDV rate was highest in those between 9 and 12 years.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study indicated that for every pediatric injury related\ndeath approximately 1000 injured children received emer-\ngency department treatment. Stated in other terms, about\n0.1% of children died from their injuries. Rates of IEDV and\ninjury related mortality varied by cause of injury and age.\nThis study found that the large number of injuries caused\nby falls, struck by/against, and overexertion accounted for\nmore than 60% of all pediatric IEDV, yet were rarely fatal. Fall\ninjury rates were highest among infants who are vulnerable\nbecause of their limited coordination, exploratory nature, and\npotential home hazards, while struck by/against and overexer-\ntion injury rates were most pronounced in older children who\ntend to be more active and involved in sports.\nResults from this analysis were comparable to those gener-\nated by other databases. While NEISS-AIP estimated that\nchildren younger than 15 years of age account for 7.1 million\nIEDV, data from the 1999 National Hospital Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey (NHAMCS) estimated this as 8.2\nmillion,9 10 a 13% difference. The NHAMCS estimate would be\nexpected to be higher because it includes repeat emergency\ndepartment visits for the same injury incident and it includes\ncases where the reason for the visit was an injury as well as\nthose with injury diagnoses, while the NEISS-AIP estimate\nincludes only the initial emergency department visit for an\ninjury incident and only those cases with injury diagnoses as\ndetermined by an attending physician. The other major\nsurveillance systems available for comparing injuries and\ndeaths relate to traffic crashes. The National Highway Traffic\nSafety Administration tallies traffic related fatalities using the\nFatality Analysis Reporting System and estimates non-fatal\ntraffic related injuries using the National Automotive Sam-\npling System General Estimates System (GES). Compared\nwith our results, the NF:F ratios generated by these systems\nwere similar for motor vehicle traffic occupants, but substan-\ntially different for pedal cyclists and pedestrians. These differ-\nences are attributable to discrepancies in non-fatal injury\ndata. Fatality Analysis Reporting System results are similar to\nthe vital statistics fatality data11; however, the NEISS-AIP cap-\nture of non-fatal transportation injuries is more complete\nthan GES. GES is based on police incident reports and\nincludes only those crashes that occur in traffic and that are\nreported to the police. Compared with GES,12 NEISS-AIP\nrecords 7.1% more injured motor vehicle occupants, 60% more\ntraffic related pedestrians injured, and over four times more\ntraffic related pedal cyclists injured.\nThe fatal and non-fatal injury related databases used in our\nanalysis provide timely data for the injury pyramid. These\ndatabases can be used to indicate the annual incidence of the\ntop three levels of the injury pyramid, namely deaths,\nhospitalizations, and emergency department visits. These\ndatabases cannot be used to indicate the bottom level of the\npyramid: total episodes of injuries (including those un-\ntreated). Hospitalization estimates can be determined from\nthe emergency department disposition field; however, with\nthe 12 months of data for this analysis, we did not address the\nissue of hospitalizations because the estimates can be unstable\nfor less common injuries. A more detailed analyses of\nhospitalizations by external cause and intent of injury will be\npossible as more years of NEISS-AIP data become available.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the injuries\nincluded only those treated in hospital emergency depart-\nments; injuries that were treated in outpatient clinics or doc-\ntors' offices, or not medically treated were not included.\nSecond, the NEISS-AIP provides only national estimates and\ndoes not allow for estimates by region, state, or local jurisdic-\ntion. Third, non-fatal causes were based on International Classi-\nfication of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes,8 12 13 while fatal data were\nmore categories for all causes of death, and some of the rules\nfor coding and for selecting the underlying cause of death have\nbeen changed to favor case ascertainment of injury.15 However,\nwhen analyzing the ICD-9 based 1998 mortality data, there\nwere only minor differences in injury cause rankings and\nrates. Finally, these mortality and morbidity data were\ncompared for different time periods. However, given the mag-\nnitude of these findings, our results would not likely differ if\nthe same year of data had been available for both fatal and\nnon-fatal injuries.\nPublic health policy has been largely influenced by mortality\ndata. New nationally based interactive databases now permit\npublic health professionals to fully consider the importance of\nnon-fatal injuries in developing priorities.\nWhile our study indicated that falls constitute a large\nproportion of non-fatal injuries among children, causal factors\nTable 3 Annual non-fatal injury rates* per 100000 population of emergency department visits by cause, ages 0\u00ad14,\nAge\n(years) Falls\nStruck by/\nagainst Overexertion\nCut/\npierce\nBites/\nstings\nPedal\ncyclist\nMV traffic\noccupant\nForeign\nbody\nOther\ntransport Fire/burn\nIncludes all pedal cyclists (traffic, non-traffic, unspecified).\nIncludes only motor vehicle (MV) traffic occupants (excludes non-traffic and unknowns).\n\u00a7Rate is unstable because of a sample size <20 cases or coefficient of variation >30%.\nCauses of pediatric fatal and non-fatal injury 175\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nsuch as playgrounds, sports, falls from beds or furniture,\nstairs, or falls from heights could not be determined.
