In addition to being a convenient and cost-\neffective platform, webinars provide opportunities for real-time interaction between\nfacilitators and participants (De Gara and Boora, 2006). Managing these interactions,\nhowever, is not always a problem-free undertaking. In informational webinars for pro-\nspective grant applicants, for example, the foundation representative's agenda of dis-\nseminating `general interest' information may at times conflict with the prospective\napplicant's interest in seeking out recommendations on how to proceed with a particular\nproject in mind. As such, foundation representatives are placed in the somewhat difficult\nposition of giving advice vis-a-vis the individual projects while preserving the official\nstance of disseminating information for the wider audience. In this article, we describe\nhow representatives of a philanthropic foundation strike a delicate balance by engaging\nthe practice of what we have roughly glossed as going general (also see Waring, 2017)\nin response to yes/no questions that seek specificity, and we do so within a conversation\nanalytic framework (see `Data and method' below).\nBackground\nResponses to questions\nIn conversation analysis (CA), a growing body of studies has been dedicated to the vari-\nous issues involved in responding to questions (Enfield et al., 2010; Lee, 2013). One\nmajor finding is that not all responses are equal: some are `preferred' (i.e. occur with\ngreater frequency or treated as expected), and others `dispreferred'; preferred responses\nare typically produced without delay, mitigation, or accounts, while dispreferred\nresponses are produced with these features (Pomerantz, 1984).Answers, for example, are\npreferred over non-answers such as I don't know or silence (Stivers and Robinson, 2006).\nIn addition, responses to questions that embody aligning actions (e.g. granting of a\nrequest, acceptance of an invitation or offer) are preferred over those that convey non-\naligning actions (Schegloff, 2007). Finally, with regard to yes/no questions, yes responses\nare preferred over no responses (Sacks, 1987). Of particular relevance to the focus of our\nstudy, type-conforming responses (i.e. responses that contain yes, no or an equivalent\ntoken such as yeah or uh huh) are preferred over nonconforming responses (i.e. responses\nthat do not contain such tokens) (Raymond, 2003). Based on 325 instances of grammati-\ncally formed yes/no interrogatives (YNIs) from 10 large corpora of naturally occurring\nBritish and American conversations, Raymond (2003) found that type-conforming\nresponses are far more frequent than nonconforming responses, which indicate some\ntrouble with or resistance to the question (see below). The author also calls attention to\nthe notable restriction to type-conforming responses in certain institutional settings (e.g.\ncourtrooms, standardized surveys).\nAsecond major finding is that responses may be formatted in ways that display various\nstances toward, or degrees of resistance to, questions (e.g. Clayman and Heritage, 2002;\nDrew, 1992; also see Raymond, 2003 above). One can evade answering by engaging overt\npractices such as justifying the shift or covert practices such as using subversive word\nrepeats or operating on the question (Clayman, 2001). One can also treat a question as not\nhaving a straightforward answer by prefacing the response with well (Schegloff and\nLerner, 2009) or a response as motivated independently of a prior action (Clayman, 2013).\nOne can further push back on the underlying terms of the questions by prefacing a response\nwith oh (Heritage, 1998), providing repetitional rather than yes/no answers (Heritage and\nRaymond, 2012), producing a clausal versus a phrasal response to a specifying wh-ques-\ntion (Fox and Thompson, 2010), challenging the question's presuppositions (Ehrlich and\nSidnell, 2006), and responding in ways that retroactively transform the terms and/or the\nagenda of the question (Stivers and Hayashi, 2010). Based on data from English and\nJapanese everyday conversations, Stivers and Hayashi (2010) show that a response can be\ndesigned to resist (1) the question's terms through specifying or replacing an element in\nthe question or (2) the question's agenda by adjusting its focus, bias, or presupposition.\nSimilar responding practices for resisting the constraints of questions are found in lan-\nguages other than English and Japanese such as Russian (Bolden, 2009), Danish\nAs can be seen, the existing work on responding to questions has yielded important\ninsights into the preference structures of responses as well as the actions they implement,\nsuch as resisting a question's terms, agenda, and presuppositions. Our phenomenon of\ninterest also concerns to some degree the foundation representatives' resistance to ques-\ntions and, in particular, the specificity (or potential guidance/advice) sought by the audi-\nence's yes\u00adno questions. To some extent, this resistance to specificity has been\ndocumented in the advising literature.\nResistance to advice-giving\nA persistent theme in the advising literature has been the avoidance of overt advice-giv-\n1997; Vehvil\u00e4inen, 2012). By framing advice as general information for everyone (e.g.\nWe strongly recommend that people do X), for example, the ambiguity of giving advice\nand giving information can be exploited to manage advice resistance (Kinnell and\nAside from camouflaging advice as some other innocuous activity to manage advice\nresistance, participants may also resist advice-giving by maintaining a non-directive\nstance in certain institutional settings. Such a stance can be found in the context of risk\ncommunication in genetic counseling, driven by the counselor's particular domain of (in)\nexpertise as well as the principle of non-directiveness (Sarangi, 2010; Sarangi and\nClarke, 2002). In response to clients' requests such as We would like your advice, for\nexample, the counselors would avoid direct advice-giving by giving information on what\nothers normally do in similar situations (Sarangi, 2010). In their study on Down\nSyndrome screening in a Hong Kong prenatal hospital, Zayts and Schnurr (2012) found\nthat medical professionals respond to specific requests for advice such as Which is the\nbest for me? by complying with these requests implicitly through information-giving,\nthereby upholding the ideology of promoting patient-centered autonomy. Promoting `cli-\nent' autonomy also figures centrally in education, where such promotion tends to clash\nwith the need to provide guidance to students (Waring and Song, in press). Vehvil\u00e4inen\n(2003), for example, shows how counselors in labor market training at a Finnish adult\neducation center avoid providing solutions in response to student requests regarding mat-\nters that they should deal with themselves. The counselors do so by responding to the\nrequest but sanctioning it afterwards (e.g. You should not count on me for answers.) or by\nwithholding advice and shaping the interaction into a questioning sequence, after which\nadvice can be given as a reaction to the student's response. These practices are imple-\nmented, according to Vehvil\u00e4inen, with the aim of promoting students'self-directedness.\nThe institutional mandate to empower students'own decision-making that constrains the\nteacher's advice-giving is also found in Limberg's (2010) analyses of office hours at a\nGerman university. Similarly, resistance to advice-giving is revealed in He's (1994)\nstudy on academic counseling at an American university, where advisors withhold cer-\ntain information from students (e.g. personal opinions or expert judgment) for the pur-\npose of fostering the latter's ability to navigate the university system and make decisions\nfor themselves.\nSeveral studies have also explored how participants resist addressing a specific\nadvice-seeking individual for the benefit of informing a wider audience. In his study on\nexpert advising on call-in radio, for example, Hutchby (1995) shows how the expert\ntends to package his advice as general prescriptions and answers more than what the\nquestion asks. In an American Internet health column, the writer manages the public and\npersonal domains of advice-giving through broadening the scope of the responding letter\nand addressing the wider readership directly, among other strategies (Locher, 2006).\nClearly, resistance to advice-giving is part and parcel of navigating certain institution-\nspecific concerns and constraints (Drew and Heritage, 1992), such as promoting auton-\nomy and appealing to a wider audience. The foundation representatives in our data face\nsimilar issues, especially with regard to the goal of informing the wider audience listen-\ning in on the webinar. In addition, the representatives also have an obligation to be\ninformative without appearing to privilege or guarantee a particular outcome for a poten-\ntial applicant (i.e. avoiding the pitfall of leading someone down a `rabbit hole', as one\nfoundation officer put it). The current project continues to explore how this tension\nbetween generality and specificity is managed and does so with a focus on responses to\nyes\u00adno questions within a previously unexplored context \u00ad that of information webinars\ndesigned by foundation representatives for prospective grantees.\nData and method\nOur database consists of 17 publicly available audio-recordings of webinars conducted\nin English, and in which presenters on behalf of a major philanthropic foundation in the\nUnited States present information on funding opportunities and address questions from\nan audience of prospective applicants. Presenters typically include not only foundation\nofficers but also individuals from other non-profit organizations, government agencies,\nor academic institutions who may be grantees or in partnership with the foundation in\nadvancing its mission. As such, all presenters represent the foundations'interests to vari-\nous extents and are referred to as `foundation representatives' in our article.\nIn this study, we examine a collection of 138 yes/no question-response sequences in\nwhich an audience member asks a yes/no question potentially relevant to preparing a\nparticular proposal, and the response deploys the practice of going general. For each\nwebinar, the audience is invited to submit questions through an on-screen chat box\nthroughout the presentations. These questions are to be answered during the Q&A por-\ntion of the webinar after the presentations. There is routinely a brief delay before a ques-\ntion is responded to, which, according to one of the foundation officers, mainly involves\n`negotiating who is best equipped to reply'.\nThe Q&A portions were transcribed in their entirety using conversation analytic\nnotations (see Appendix 1) and analyzed within a conversation analytic framework.\nCA aims to uncover the tacit methods of social interaction, or how participants\nunderstand each other and make themselves understood. Analysis revolves around\n`consistently and insistently' asking a single question: why that now \u00ad that is, why\nsomething is said or done in that particular way at that particular time? (Heritage and\nAs noted earlier, our focus is on detailing how foundation representatives manage\nresponding to specific audience questions within the institutional requirement of\nproviding general information for the wider audience. The foundation's written\n`guiding principles' emphasize the importance of fair selection of grantees, respon-\nsiveness to grantees, and open and clear communication with the public. Although\nthese principles do not translate directly into instructions for how to handle specific\nquestions, one might argue that while responsiveness calls for individualized atten-\ntion, upholding the principle of fairness requires not privileging one potential project\nover another (or suggesting a favorable outcome if one does X or Y), and open and\nclear communication involves in part the consistent reiteration of the foundation's\nprimary objectives.\nThe fact that there is indeed a concern for `going general' oriented to by the partici-\npants themselves in interaction can be seen in the directives representatives give at the\nbeginning of the Q&A sessions, such as Please ask ONLY general interest questions. Not\nsurprisingly, the specific audience questions we examine are also produced in ways that at\nleast blur the boundary between the specific interest in any individual project and general\ninterest for the wider audience. One might argue, for example, that the X in Would the\nfoundation be interested in X? is potentially relevant to, not just the question asker, but\nothers in the audience as well. Our interest, however, is in showing how the responses are\nto various degrees designedly resistant to the individualized advice-giving trajectory \u00ad an\noption rendered possible and available by the questions. In responding to the question of\nWould the foundation be interested in X?, for example, a simple and definitive yes would\nbe hearable as potentially advising the questioner to pursue the project related to X. On the\nother hand, a less straightforward formulation such as What we are looking for is ... would\nconstitute information-giving vis-a-vis the yes/no question.\nAnalysis\nAs will be shown, while audience members routinely ask yes/no questions on specific topics\npresumably relevant to their own proposals, foundation representatives routinely orient to\ntheir institutional mandate to provide information that is useful to the audience as a whole\nand to avoid the appearance of offering specific advice on how to proceed with any one\nproject.Apractice that we have roughly glossed as going general (also see Waring, 2017) is\nmobilized to navigate this subtle tension between doing informing and doing advising.\nFor the purpose of this study, going general involves the foundation representatives'prac-\ntice of designing maximally informative responses to specific yes/no questions while resisting\nadvice-giving on the potential projects to which those questions are addressed. This practice of\ngoing general is implemented through three different multi-unit turn response formats:\n(a)yes/no+\n(b) clausal yes/no+\n(c)non-yes/no\nYes/no+ entails a clear yes/no (or equivalent lexical tokens such as sure, absolutely,\ncertainly) somewhere in the response, but mostly at or near the turn-beginning, plus\nfurther talk. Clausal yes/no+ includes a clause that implements a yes/no response with-\nout using the tokens yes or no (e.g. Program evaluation would not be appropriate) plus\nadditional talk. These clausal responses do not always repeat the exact wording of the\nquestions but are nevertheless inferable as a yes or no. For example, with the question\nWould the foundation be receptive to X?, a clausal yes response might be X is something\nwe would be open to evaluating. As will be shown in the following analysis, the plus (+)\nportions of (a) and (b) are not simple reiterations of confirmation or disconfirmation as\nin, for example, Yes, we are interested in X, but entail a great deal of interactional work.\nFinally, a non-yes/no response consists of a multi-unit turn that does not address the yes/\nno aspect of the question at all. Of the 138 yes/no question-response cases, 50 are yes/\nWith this range of responses, (a) would be considered type-conforming, while (b) and\n(c), although not a format distinction made by Raymond (2003), nonconforming. Contrary\nto their rare occurrences in Raymond's corpus, the nonconforming responses in our data are\nalmost twice as many \u00ad a stark contrast to the institutional settings of courtrooms and stand-\nardized surveys discussed in Raymond (2003). Most importantly, however, while Raymond\n(2003) shows that type-conforming responses accept the constraints of the questions, and\nnonconforming ones problematize the questions, the focus of our analysis is on how the\nthree response formats, regardless of their type-conformity, transcend to various degrees the\nconstraints of the questions in ways that are both responsive and sensitive to specific institu-\ntional concerns associated with delivering informational webinars for (grant) applicants.\nYes/no+ format\nIn this section, we show three exemplars of `yes/no+'responses deployed by the founda-\ntionrepresentativesinansweringaudiencequestionsthatseekspecificity.Type-conforming,\nunmitigated yes occurs on rare occasions; more often than not, the yes comes with some\nsort of hedging, as is the case in our first example. Immediately prior to the segment,\nDana has announced the commencement of the final Q&A session and that she will be\nreading through a couple of the chatted-in questions. As the segment begins, Dana reads\na question that concerns the composition of the leadership institute, to which she herself\nproceeds to respond in line 06:\n01 Dana: .HH the first one i:s (0.2) u:h ((reads))-should\n02 (.) the participants attending the leadership\n03 institute be representative of fi:ve different\n04organizations ideally.\n06  .hhh U:::M: Yes. \n08 we:: we- (0.2) um (.) expect to see diversity: in\n09 the five people that participate in the\n10 leadership institute, .hh u:h different\n11 organizations, (.) different secto:rs,\n12 (.) .hh um we have peop:le >you know<\n13on the teams that went through it back in the\n14fa:ll, (0.5) this year we ha:d .hh people from\n15 the nonprofit sector:,=from faith-based,\n16(.) .hh elected official:s, people\n17representing citie:s, (.) .hh um: people\n18>representing< educati:on, higher educati:on,\n19 so there was a good mix and- and- .hh what\n20these people learn in the institute (.) they're\n21 really um (0.5) learning (.) >tools and methods\n22 that they can< bring back and share with the\n23larger coalition.= so everybody will-\n24 will (.) um gain? from this institute?\n25 .hhh >but we do wanna see< diversity in\n28>and the< next question i:s: ((reads))\nAs can be seen, Dana's type-conforming and emphatically delivered yes is preceded by\nan inbreath and an elongated um as if a dispreferred response were forthcoming\n(Schegloff, 2010). This hedged delay may be alerting the audience to the fact that the\nensuing yes is perhaps not as unproblematic as it looks and that it is expandable. Indeed,\nafter a brief 0.2-second gap, Dana proceeds to state, not without some difficulty (see\nelongation, cut-off, pauses, and the repair initiating um), what we the foundation expect\nto see (line 08), thereby clearly marking what's coming up as officially upheld by the\nfoundation. In particular, she invokes diversity as the guiding principle for composing\nthe leadership institute. Note that although the audience's yes\u00adno question seeks confir-\nmation on the need to include five different organizations (lines 03\u00ad04), Dana's response,\nas headlined by the `banner' of diversity, lists a much wider range of configurations that\ninclude representatives from different sectors (lines 11\u00ad18). What gets highlighted is a\ngood mix (line 19) as opposed to the simple and straightforward five different organiza-\ntions (lines 03\u00ad04) suggested by the questioner. Dana's turn ends with a reiteration of we\ndo wanna to see diversity in that group (lines 25\u00ad26), again conveying the foundation's\nperspective through the institutional we.\nDana's yes response to the audience question is qualified by her own talk both preceding\nand following the yes. While the yes confirms the acceptability of five different organiza-\ntions, its preceding and subsequent qualifications caution the audience against a narrow\nunderstanding of eligibility by explicating and exemplifying the diversity principle. In the\nend, in addition to answering the question as framed by the audience member, the question\nDana ends up answering also concerns the broader issue of how to select participants for\nthe leadership institute \u00ad an issue applicable across contexts and relevant to the wider audi-\nence. In so doing, she traverses beyond the terms of the question and succeeds in maintain-\ning her mission as a foundation representative of effectively disseminating information.\nOur next case involves a no response to the audience's question. The segment begins\nwith Betty reading a question regarding whether a proposal should be aligned with one\nof the three hubs (lines 05\u00ad07), to which Joy responds in line 09:\n01 Betty: um the next question. ((reads))-in\n02 addition to explaining how our proposal fits\n03 with the objective of the CfP, and advances\n04 the culture of health, .hh should\n05 applicants try to align proposals with the\n06 work (.) of the ((university name)) team?=or one of\n09 Joy:  um ((clears throat)) no. (it) necessarily (.) does\n10 not have to align with one of us?=um (0.2) what\n11 we were- >speaking to earlier< was if you're\n12 going to work in an area (0.2) um that >one of\n13 the hubs< is already doing we would\n14 want you to make sure >that there's no\n15duplication.=but< .hh we're not asking you to\n16 only mimic what's going on at- at ((university name))\n17 >or one of the hubs.<\n19 Betty: $all r(h)ight$ hhuh heh heh ( ) um so\n20you're ((continues with a clarification question))\nJoy's response begins with a turn-initial um (Schegloff, 2010) that suggests a possible\ndispreferred second pair-part in the works, as materialized in the ensuing no (Sacks,\n1987). In keeping with the typical format of dispreferred responses that involves delay,\nmitigation, or accounts (Pomerantz, 1984), Joy's no is then expanded into a full clausal\nno that slightly mitigates the negative response with necessarily does not (lines 09\u00ad10).\nShe then rushes past the possible completion of the clausal turn-constructional unit\n(TCU) (Sacks et al., 1974) and stops at a point of maximal grammatical control (Schegloff,\n1996) (i.e. after the um which clearly projects more to come) (line 10). What follows is\na clarification of what they were speaking to earlier (line 11) \u00ad one that entails the no\nduplication principle that, again, the institutional `we' expects from a wide range of pro-\nposals (lines 13\u00ad15). Like the principle of diversity invoked in the prior extract, the\nprinciple of `no duplication' is what Joy resorts to as she resists catering exclusively to\nthe specificity pursued by the question. This resistance is further evidenced in the ending\nof her turn, where she conveys a negative stance toward that specificity by replacing the\nquestioner's positively framed align with the negatively intoned mimic as she empha-\nsizes what we're not asking you to do (lines 15\u00ad16)\nIn both segments, the foundation representative produces a response that transcends\nthe type-conforming yes/no to spotlight a certain guiding principle upheld by the founda-\ntion that is applicable, but not limited, to the specific matter being queried. In other words,\nbeyond answering the question of whether a specific X should be done, the `plus' portion\nof the representative's response shifts to answer a different sort of question \u00ad that of what\nthe driving principle behind decisions on X is (also see Stivers and Hayashi, 2010). In so\ndoing, the foundation representative resists the restraint projected by yes/no questions that\nseek specificity related to individual projects and chooses, instead, to use the opportunity\nto reiterate basic foundation principles for the wider audience that may in turn effectively\naddress a range of questions that no longer need to be asked. Stivers and Heritage (2001)\nalso show how in comprehensive history-taking during doctor\u00adpatient interaction, patients\nsometimes go beyond the yes/no by bringing in additional materials from their life world\nas a way of expressing their concerns. The plus portions of our foundation representatives'\nresponses, as has been shown, manifest a different set of institution-specific concerns.\nClausal yes/no+ format\nResponses to the audience's yes/no questions do not always include a type-conforming\nyes or no or their lexical equivalents. In some cases, foundation representatives offer a\nyes/no-equivalent response in clausal form. Instead of Yes, for example, in response to\nDo you fund qualitative research?, a yes-equivalent clausal response would be We do\nfund qualitative research or We're open to qualitative research. A clausal yes/no+\nresponse then includes the yes/no-equivalent clause plus additional components. In this\nsection, we consider two such cases, with the first involving a no-equivalent response\nand the second a yes-equivalent one. In the first segment below, the audience question\nconcerns whether there is a preference toward certain types of data sources and method-\nologies (lines 02\u00ad03). While foundation guidelines may stipulate which types of propos-\nals are appropriate, preference is a less definable matter. In other words, the question\ndoes not lend itself to an easy yes/no answer:\n01 Bonnie: .hh u::h here's a question, Mary for\n02you::. ((reads))-is there a preference\n03towards certain types (.) of data sources\n04and methodologies?\n06 Mary:  \u00b0so\u00b0 I wouldn't say there's a preference?\n07 um but we a::re looking for stro::ng\n08 empirica::l (.) research?=um >with\n09 reasonable and rigorous< me:thods.=and (.)\n10 .hh given the investigator initiated approach\n11 of this call for proposals? .h we:: leave this\n12 open?=to:: the:: applicants to determine the\n13 methods that are best suited to answer their\n14 research questio:ns.=as well as (.) .hh what\n15 data sources a::re available and\n18 Bonnie: <and here's another question? ((reads))\nNote that after Mary's turn-initial so, delivered in raised pitch and sotto voce and\nhearable as projecting a `long story', her no-equivalent clausal response is packaged\nwith the hedging I wouldn't say as well as rising intonation (line 06). While `there's\nno preference' would constitute a categorical denial, I wouldn't say frames the issue\nas a matter of wording and invites the recipient to search for what I would say.\nIndeed, as with the other cases we have observed, Mary does not stop at answering\nthe question as it is asked. Her denial of a preference is immediately followed by an\naccount, prefaced with um but, of what we are looking for (line 07). As can be seen,\nin lieu of certain types of data sources and methodologies in the audience question,\nMary emphasizes strong empirical research and reasonable and rigorous methods\n(lines 07\u00ad08). In so doing, she resists the question's agenda (Stivers and Hayashi,\n2010) that seeks clarity on the foundation's preference and appears to presuppose\nsuch a preference for certain data and methods (e.g. qualitative vs quantitative). She\nthen further resists offering a solution by highlighting the investigator initiated\napproach that invites the applicants to determine the suitability of their data sources\nand methods to answering their questions (lines 10\u00ad14). Mary, in other words, man-\nages to formulate a response to the question in such a way that foregrounds the\nfoundation's priorities of supporting strong and rigorous research for an audience\nwith a variety of potential data sources and methods suited to their individual\nprojects.\nIn the next segment, the audience queries whether X is considered research (lines\n05-07), and upon being selected by Ellen, Nora accepts with sure and proceeds to explic-\nitly frame her response as an answer to the question (line 10). As it turns out, however, the\nanswer is not a definitive one but a possible yes delivered in a clausal format (line 10):\n01 Ellen: the first question .hh i:s, (0.2)\n02 you indicated this program specifically\n03 targets funding research. yes? we did indicate\n04 that many times. HH and (.) program or policy\n05implementation is not eligible. .h so is\n06 evalua:tion of the implementation of a program\n07 or policy considered research. .hh Nora\n08 do you wanna elaborate on that a bit, .h\n10 Nora:  sure. u::m (.) tch the answer is that evaluation\n11 of uh program or policy (0.8) ca:n be research,\n12 but it depends on how well-framed it is .h and\n13 how (0.2) how uh rigorous and generalizable\n14 (.) the findings will be. so the research needs\n15 to really be a rigorous evaluation it needs to go\n16 beyond the simple .h .hh pre- post questionnaire,\n17 .hh and uh (0.5) the majority of fundings .h must\n18 be dedicated to the research related activities not\n19 to the- the progra:m .h uh itself. .h and uh finally\n20 we would wanna know how generalizable it would\n21 be to a large enough population that (it) would\n22actually .h move the needle on population health.\n24 Ellen: grea:t. I think that's- that's a helpful clarification.\n25.hh ((continues to next question))\nIn line 10, Nora's clausal response is prefaced with um followed by a micro-pause and\ntch, possibly adumbrating trouble of some sort (Schegloff, 2010). Thereafter, instead\nof producing a straightforward `yes' or `no', she places what follows in the frame of\nthe answer is that along with a partial repetition of the question's subject evaluation of\nuh program or policy, thereby further delaying the actual answer. The predicate or the\nactual answer is yet again delayed with the (0.8) second pause (line 11) before it is\nproduced with the stressed and elongated epistemic modal can, suggesting the possi-\nbility of such work being considered research \u00ad a possibility contingent upon a list of\ncriteria introduced by the phrase but it depends on (line 12). By appending the possibly\nyes-clausal response as such then, Nora manages to rise above the specificity of pro-\ngram or policy evaluation to espouse the foundation's interests in seeking and support-\ning rigorous and generalizable research (line 13, 15 and 20). At the same time, she is\nable to address the audience's specific concerns in the case of program evaluation by\noutlining what would not be considered rigorous (lines 15\u00ad16) and what should not\nreceive the majority of fundings (line 17).\nIn sum, the clausal format appears to be a useful resource for delivering more nuanced\nresponses to questions that do not clearly lend themselves to a straightforward yes/no. In\nboth cases above, while the clausal yes/no answers the specific questions, in the plus por-\ntion of the responses, the foundation representatives go general by underscoring the\nfoundation's priorities, the reasoning behind the priorities, and further interpretations of\nthose priorities. In so doing, they partially resist the constraints set forth by the questions\nwhile preserving their footing as ambassadors charged with the task of publicizing the\nfoundation's missions.\nNon-yes/no format\nSome clausal responses do not contain any yes/no answers to the questions. As will be\nshown, the foundation representatives choose instead to skirt the issues by reiterating\nwhat they are looking for, explicating why they are looking for X, and inviting potential\ngrantees to make their own decisions on the appropriateness of their projects in light of\nthe foundation's priorities. We consider two such cases in this section. In the first excerpt\nbelow, the audience's question of whether the foundation would give a grant to a certain\ntype of organization is responded to with neither a yes/no+ nor a clausal yes/no+:\n01 David: ((reads))-will the foundation consider\n02 granting an organization. that supplies\n03 durable medical equipment to\n04 under-served people with disabilities.\n06  we are looking for organizations that\n07 represent the four sectors. business,\n09 Cate: \u00b0faith-based\u00b0\n10 David: and faith-based.\n11 Cate: \u00b0>that's [right.<\u00b0]\n12 David: [if the- ] if the applying\n13 organization fits in those categories. (0.8)\n14 then the answer's yes.\n16 Cody: ((reads))-does nonprofit association ((continues))\nNotably, David restates what we are looking for \u00ad organizations that represent four sectors\n(lines 06\u00ad07) \u00ad information that is presumably included in the general call for proposals.\nThe listing of the four sectors is completed in collaboration with Cate (lines 07\u00ad11). He\nthen goes on to invite the audience to decide for themselves whether their specific organi-\nzation fits into these categories (lines 12\u00ad14). Note that although we see the yes token in\nline 14, it is certainly not a yes response to the audience question. Rather, it is a yes that\nthe audience has to arrive at on their own based on their own judgment. In so doing, David\noffers the resources for the audience to find answers without committing to an interest in\nany specific organization. In fact, shifting the responsibility of finding answers back to the\naudience (e.g. it's up to you) is a move foundation officers repeatedly deploy in our data\nset. In the meantime, David's listing of the four sectors serves as a useful reminder for the\nwider audience who may then check their own eligibility against these categories. In other\nwords, while responding to the question to some extent, David also resists specific advice-\ngiving by going general and maintaining the information-giving stance.\nWhile David's response provides the resources for audience autonomy, Claire's\nresponse in the next segment rejects the terms of the question entirely when the audi-\nence asks whether a particular citation format needs to be followed (lines 02\u00ad04):\n01 Claire:  u::m (1.5) o: ka:y next question we ha::ve?\n02\u00b0uh\u00b0 {((reads))-for the proposal are we\n03 required to provide references (0.2) that-\n04 same way they are cited >in the congenital-<}\n05   uh- you know (0.2) we are nO::T the sticklers\n06 for fo::rm as much as we are for substance.\n08so there's no:t (.)

((reads))\nClaire's resistance to the question's agenda can be observed as early as line 04 in the\nmidst of her reading of the question as she speeds up and abandons the reading entirely\nwith a cut-off. The ensuing assertion of we not being sticklers for form is preceded,\nnot surprisingly, by some trouble (uh- you know (0.2)), given its `(self)-interruptive'\nand dis-aligning stance toward the question. The contrastive nO:T being sticklers\nwith its prosodic emphasis is hearable as treating the question as pre-supposing that\nthe foundation are sticklers. The claim of the foundation's concern for substance (line\n06) is then further specified with what we're not looking at (lines 08\u00ad11). Similar to\nwhat we have observed in the prior segment, Claire then essentially invites the audi-\nence, beginning with the if clause that embeds the principle regarding the inclusion of\nreferences, to decide for themselves whether such inclusion would be appropriate\n(lines 14\u00ad18), at which point her response is presumably complete.\nWith a but followed by a brief pause and some quick speech perturbation, however,\nClaire continues with a reiteration of we're looking for substance (lines 19\u00ad20), which is\nexplicated with the importance of diving into a needy and worthy problem ... to change\nthe world (lines 21\u00ad23). She ends with a so-prefaced summative statement using the\nanaphoric that to highlight the rationale of the program (i.e. resources devoted to sub-\nstantive change in the world) (lines 24\u00ad26).\nIn the segment then, the foundation representative rejects the terms of the question\nentirely and responds with an alternative framing and reiteration (also see Stivers and\nHayashi, 2010), not just for the questioner, but the general audience, of the institutional\npriority on substance and what such substance entails. An advice-giving stance in this\ncase would perhaps involve further engagement with the specifics of which citations\nmay or may not qualify as `appropriate'. One might argue then that the direct reaching\nfor the general policy embodies a degree of resistance to advice-giving in part through\nsuggesting that the wrong question is being asked.\nIn the above two cases, the individual questions are not directly responded to. Rather,\nthe foundation representatives reject the terms of the question entirely or shift the deci-\nsion-making responsibility back to the questioner before returning to an explication of\nthe foundation's focus, priority, or mission. In so doing, they resist, or at least limit, the\npossibility of engaging with individual advising while fulfilling their responsibility of\nclearly and effectively disseminating information to an audience of potential grantees. At\nthe same time, audience questions that seek specificity are arguably addressed to varying\nextents as well, just not within the parameters within which they are raised.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nIn this article, we have shown that in responding to prospective grantees' yes/no ques-\ntions that seek specificity, foundation representatives routinely deliver `big package'\nresponses with multi-unit turns that do more than answer the question as posed. As such,\nthey leverage the three formats of yes/no+, clausal yes/no+, and non-yes/no to transcend\nthe specifics of the question and reiterate the foundation's principles and priorities, which\nare regularly introduced with linguistic routines such as again, as long as, and what\nwe're looking for is with the institutional we. While remaining responsive to audience\nquestions to various extents, this move to go general or reach for the bigger picture\nembodies various degrees of resistance to the terms dictated by the questions and to\nindividualized advice-giving. While yes/no+ provides (dis)confirmation of the issues\nraised by the questions, clausal yes/no+ does so with greater qualification or indirect-\nness, and non-yes/no represents the more extreme approach of not directly addressing the\nquestions at all.\nThe three different formats present different affordances for the foundation representa-\ntives to accomplish their professional work. While yes/no+ is fitted to the availability of a\nstraightforward response, clausal yes/no+ facilitates the delivery of a more nuanced yes/\nno, and non-yes/no is done to reject the terms of the question, handle rare exceptions, and\nfirmly shift the responsibility of assessing how specific projects fit with foundation priori-\nties back to the questioners. With this range of formats, the foundation representatives\nmanage the delicate balance between giving advice and giving information, which can be\nrepresented on a continuum with increasing emphasis on informing, or in other words,\nresistance to the appearance of doing individual advising (see Figure 1).\nIn sum, we started with an interest in the ways in which the multi-unit responses in\nour data appear to resist the specificity sought by the questions and aim instead to\naddress broader issues and principles related to funding opportunities. We propose that\nthis practice of going general is one way in which the foundation representatives navi-\ngate a tension between doing informing on general matters and doing advising on\nspecific matters related to particular projects. By going general, foundation representa-\ntives are able to provide potentially useful information on how to interpret application\ninstructions and requirements, and they can do so without appearing to be giving\nadvice on particular projects, or by extension, guaranteeing a favorable outcome for\nany particular proposal.\nWhile Steensig and Heinemann (2013) have shown how certain yes/no questions\n(e.g. expansion eliciting questions) are designed to elicit responses that expand upon\nthe type-conforming `yes' or `no' (also see Raymond, 2010), our focus has been not on\nthe questions, but on the `big package' responses and what these responses may look\nlike in the institutional context of informational webinars for (grant) applicants. As\nsuch, our findings contribute to the growing body of literature that documents the com-\nplexity, and in particular, resistance, involved in responding to questions. Similar to\nFox and Thompson's (2010) claim that clausal responses to specifying wh-questions\nmay indicate resistance to prior questions, we have shown that such resistance exists\nin the case of yes/no questions as well. Similar to Stivers and Hayashi's (2010) partici-\npants in ordinary conversation, the foundation representatives in our data also produce\ntransformative answers but do so not for the sole purpose of problematizing the terms\nand agenda of the questions. The transformation is leveraged here to manage being\nhelpful to the individual while remaining maximally informative to the wider audi-\nence, as in part evidenced in the yes/no+ format (absent in Stivers and Hayashi's data)\nthat includes a clear and straightforward response to the question. Compared to the\nscarcity of nonconforming questions in Raymond (2003), their prevalence in our data\nmay speak to the particular institutionality of informational applicant webinars where\nfoundation representatives face a complex set of interactional demands that defy the\nstraightforwardness embodied in type-conforming responses. We have also made a\nfurther distinction between two specific formats of nonconforming (clausal yes/no and\nnon-clausal) and demonstrated the interactional affordances of these formats. More\nimportantly, we have shown that even with what would be considered type-conforming\nresponses delivered in the yes/no+ format, the participants display some sort of resist-\nance to the constraints of the question through the plus (+) portion of the talk. In other\nwords, the three formats represent a nuanced set of resources, with increasing or\ndecreasing resistance to the question's agenda, for crafting complex responses sensi-\ntive to the needs of the individual, the audience, and the foundation \u00ad responses that\nFigure 1. Three response formats.\ncannot be easily categorized as conforming or nonconforming, or accepting or resist-\ning. While such degrees of question resistance are gauged in Stivers and Hayashi\n(2010) by whether the resistance targets only the question's terms or includes its\nagenda as well, we offer another lens for considering degrees of resistance \u00ad via a set\nof response formats in informational webinars.\nThese findings also contribute to the advising literature with regard to resistance to\nadvice-giving in particular. First, similar to the advice-givers in Hutchby (1995) and\nLocher (2006), who package their advice for a broader audience over the radio and the\nInternet, the foundation officers in our data also design their responses, especially in\nthe `plus' portions of yes/no+ and clausal yes/no+, for a wider audience that extends\nbeyond the individual questioner. Second, rather than exploiting the advice-informa-\ntion ambiguity to camouflage advice as information, thereby softening its edge as\ntargeting an advice recipient, in the context of applicant webinars, information-giving\nis deployed in a slightly different way \u00ad to move away from or to withhold advice-\ngiving. The issue, therefore, is less about giving advice diplomatically and more about\nstriving to maintain some distance from giving advice at all. Finally, this resistance to\nadvice-giving is reminiscent of that in education and medical contexts, where advice\nmay be withheld for the benefit of promoting autonomy (e.g. He, 1998) or upholding\na patient-centered ideology (e.g. Sarangi, 2010). In the context of informational webi-\nnars for grant applicants, while promoting autonomy is a palpable concern as mani-\nfested in such routine phrasings as it's up to you, there appear to be other constraints\nspecific to the setting as well. In addition to striving to frame discussions as relevant\nto the whole audience and doing so within a single response slot, without the benefit\nof the interactive back-and-forth featured in other types of advising encounters, the\nofficers also have an obligation, as noted earlier, to be informative without appearing\nto guarantee a particular outcome for a potential applicant.\nBy foregrounding how the institutional tension between `doing (general) inform-\ning' and `doing (individual) advising' may be navigated, our detailing of this profes-\nsional expertise may offer a useful basis for developing materials for training future\n`ambassadors' for the foundation's mission \u00ad a step toward identifying `best prac-\ntices' for webinar facilitation (Zoumenou et al., 2015) in a particular context. Aside\nfrom articulating and making available a range of strategies for handling such ques-\ntions, training sessions may be held where future ambassadors are invited to con-\nsider, for example, the specific cases as documented in the paper, brainstorming for\npotential responses to particular questions and examining actual responses for the\nspecific ways in which they are effective. While existing training is likely to involve\nthe delivery of monologic `stump' speeches, a focus on handling sometimes unfore-\nseen audience questions would fill an important gap in such training. Finally, while\nthe webinar format has the clear advantage of being efficient, the `one-shot' question\nand answer format necessarily incurs certain limitations. There is no way to gauge,\nfor example, whether a question has been adequately addressed from an audience's\nperspective as the moderator is the one who typically offers the sequence-closing\nthird (Schegloff, 2007). Reflecting on the profits and pitfalls of this particular format\nfor information dissemination may yield useful insights into maximizing its\naffordances and minimizing its constraints.\n"
