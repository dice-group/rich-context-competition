    "reduced_content": "Active Twitter users not only tweet more often than\nothers but they also tend to mention other users with\nhigher frequency and the set of time stamped global\npositioning system (GPS) locations in their tweets are\nmore complete. The time, location, and connection\ndata along with the text content in the active users'\ntweets render a more complete picture of their social\nconnections, preferences, attitudes, interests, and\nspatial mobility.\nHowever, the activity levels of users are heavily\nskewed; most Twitter content is produced by a small\nfraction of highly active users (measured by the number\nof followers, tweets, retweets, and mentions), while the\nvast majority of registered users are passive observers.\nFor example, there were only 302 million monthly\nactive users in the first quarter of 2015 among approxi-\nmately one billion registered users (Twitter, 2015).\nAccording to Twopcharts, a company monitoring\naccounts that had at least one tweet did not create a\nsingle tweet in the previous year (Murphy, 2014).\nIn terms of content, 50% of the URLs consumed on\nThis skewed distribution of overall activity poses\nchallenges for inferring unobserved user characteristics\n(e.g. the representative geographic location of each\nuser). In particular, the methods devised to infer user\ncharacteristics rely on and leverage central tendencies\nin the data, treating highly active users as outliers\nor aberrations. In effect, the users who emit the most\ninformation and who are expected, in principle, to\nbe summarized and categorized most accurately, are\nparadoxically the ones whose characteristics tend to\nbe discounted or misclassified.\nIn this study, we offer concrete examples to illustrate\nthis paradox and discuss how methods that do not\nproperly deal with the active users can increase\nclassification error and ultimately distort our under-\nstanding of online social relationships at the micro\nlevel and structural properties of the communication\nnetwork at the macro level.\nGeo-location inference\nInferring the representative geographic location of\nsocial media users is an actively developing area of\nresearch with wide applicability in both applied and\nbasic research endeavors that use social media data.\nSocial media-based early detection and prediction stu-\ndies of seasonal flu surveillance or the prediction of\ncommercial movie success require knowledge about\nusers' locations. Research in our lab also depends on\ninference of user location, as in the study of diurnal\nrhythms of affect using Twitter data (Golder and\nMacy, 2011) or our on-going cross-national compara-\ntive analysis of communication networks.\nThe state-of-the-art location inference method based\non label propagation has been shown to perform with\nhigh coverage (90% of users geotagged) and accuracy\nmethod relies on the fact that the majority of commu-\nnication partners, or network neighbors, in the Twitter\n@user mention network are geographically proximate.\nIf a user's Twitter neighbors turn on their GPS while\ntweeting, it is possible to estimate the focal user's lati-\ntude and longitude based on the distribution of those\nneighbors' locations. This estimated location could\nthen be used to further estimate the unknown locations\nof the focal user's other network neighbors who did not\nenable GPS tracking in their tweets, and so on. In tech-\nnical terms, the label-propagation algorithm attempts\nto infer a candidate location of a given user based on\nCornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA\nCorresponding author:\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-\nNonCommercial 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction\nand distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\none of her neighbors' locations that minimizes the sum\nof distances to the rest of her neighbors' locations\n(i.e. L1-median location). To ensure robust results,\nthe algorithm incorporates a dispersion threshold\n(e.g. 100 km) where the algorithm accepts the candidate\nL1-median location as its final estimate only if the\nmedian distance from that candidate location to all\nthe other known and inferred locations of the network\nneighbors does not exceed the dispersion threshold. If\nthe candidate location satisfies this condition, the algo-\nrithm assigns that location to the focal user as its best\nestimate and propagates it to estimate other network\nneighbors' locations. For example, if a user's candidate\nlocation inferred by the algorithm happens to be in\nNew York, but her network neighbors are geographic-\nally concentrated in both New York and San\nFrancisco, such that the median of the distances from\nthe candidate location in New York to all of her neigh-\nbors' locations exceeds 100 km, then the algorithm does\nnot assign that candidate location in New York as the\nestimated location but instead classifies the user's loca-\ntion as unidentifiable.\nDespite the impressive performance in both coverage\nand accuracy of this new method, we find that predic-\ntion error is a U-shaped function of both user activity\nlevel, measured as tweets per day (Compton et al.,\n2014), and network degree. Furthermore, the candidate\nlocations inferred for the highly active users tend to\nexceed the dispersion threshold, diminishing the pro-\nportion of inferable cases (i.e. classification coverage).\nThe paradox of lower coverage and low predictive\naccuracy of active high-degree users who provide dis-\nproportionately large amounts of information about\nthemselves stems from the assumption that there is a\nsingle geographical location that best characterizes a\nuser's location. Although this may be true in principle,\nthe network neighbors who are the source of inferring\nthis single location are constantly moving over time and\nthe time at which each of those neighbors coincided\nwith the focal user in space may be too long ago to\nbe relevant. The example of the user whose network\nneighbors are concentrated in both New York and\nSan Fransisco illustrates this case. This user may\nwork in New York but reside in San Fransisco and\nform geographically segregated personal and profes-\nsional networks. Alternatively, this user may have\ngrown up in San Fransisco but moved to New York\nfor work. If the focal user is active on Twitter, her\nwork/social or past/present relationships will each be\ngiven equal weight in the label-propagation algorithm.\nFor an active user who exhibits greater geographic\ndiversity in her network, the candidate location is less\nlikely to satisfy the dispersion threshold. The algorithm\nmight be improved by either assigning multiple plaus-\nible locations (i.e. assuming multiple representative\nlocations) or by adding more constraints to what con-\nstitutes a representative location (e.g. initializing the\nlabel-propagation algorithm to start from GPS loca-\ntions in tweets created exclusively at night).\nIndividual vs. group account\nclassification\nA broad range of prediction applications (Broniatowski\net al., 2013), behavioral modeling and social network\nanalyses using social media data of hundreds of mil-\nlions of users build models with implicit assumptions\nabout the users. An important source of heterogeneity\nof the users that is often neglected is whether a user is\nan individual or a group account (e.g. a company's offi-\ncial Twitter account). Often, multiple individuals such\nas a PR team manage a single group account, leaving\nquite different behavioral traces from individual\naccounts managed by single owners. For example,\ngroup accounts tend to possess more followers on\nTwitter and the followers are arguably less related to\nthe group accounts. The communication ties between\ngroup accounts and their followers are also not likely to\nbe ``social ties'' in the conventional sense. Furthermore,\nthe objectives, language, and topical interests of group\naccounts differ from those of individuals.\nResearchers who work primarily with traditional\nsurvey data with accurate and well-defined sampling\nframes do not have to deal with the distinction between\ngroups vs. individuals. However, computational social\nscientists and data scientists who use social media data\ninevitably face this problem. Failure to correctly clas-\nsify and filter out group accounts (or individual\naccounts, depending on the research objective) could\nlead to misleading characterizations and conclusions.\nImagine a network analysis that does not properly\nfilter out group accounts that tend to have higher con-\nnectivity than individuals. Virtually all network met-\nrics, from clustering and degree distribution to mean\ngeodesic, will be affected by the presence of group\naccounts in the data.\nThe method we developed to distinguish group\nand individual accounts is based on the cognitive\nconstraints of individuals in forming and maintaining\ncommunication ties, which arguably applies to a lesser\nextent to group accounts managed by multiple individ-\nuals (Park et al., 2015). These constraints are captured,\nfor example, in the ratio of in-degree to out-degree of\neach node's immediate neighbors in the communication\nnetwork as well as in the level of concentration of com-\nmunication volume across one's network neighbors\n(Sarama\nThis method shares with the methods for geo-\nlocation estimation the problem that highly active indi-\nviduals may be misclassified due to their behavioral and\n2 Big Data & Society\nstructural similarities to groups. By mistakenly over-\nfiltering central individuals (e.g. opinion leaders),\nthe network would appear to be less clustered, more\nfragmented, and with a longer mean geodesic.\nA potential solution is to leverage the temporal\nconstraints on tweeting which individuals, but not\norganizations, tend to exhibit (Tavares and Faisal,\n2013). Each user's inter-tweet delays and the temporal\ndistribution of tweets throughout the day can be used\nto enhance the overall discriminatory power between\norganizations and active individuals whose networks\nlook similar.\nSocial vs. coworker vs. acquaintance\ntie classification\nIn the absence of respondent surveys or ethnographic\nobservation the nature of a communication tie\n(e.g. professional vs. friendship vs. acquaintance)\ncould be inferred from time-location records of\nmobile phone logs (Eagle et al., 2009; Toole et al.,\n2015). The intuition behind this method is that\ncoworkers or professionals tend to be co-located\nduring work hours (e.g. in the same office building on\na weekday afternoon) while friends are more likely to\nbe co-located during off-work hours (e.g. in a bar on a\nFriday evening). Acquaintances are likely to have few\ncolocations regardless of time. This approach, which\nleverages time-location similarity (using cosine similar-\nity between hourly location occurrence vectors of two\nindividuals), yields accurate and convincing results with\nmobile phone data that contain detailed time-location\nrecords at regular time intervals for each individual\n(i.e. whenever a mobile device communicates with a\ncell-phone tower).\nNevertheless, blindly applying this method to\nTwitter users with GPS tweet data could potentially\nlead to biased results. Again, the active users will\nappear to have high mobility with hundreds of GPS\nlocations captured in the data whereas the low activity\nusers may appear relatively immobile. Therefore, a tie\ninvolving an active user is more likely to be classified as\neither professional or friend than acquaintance.\nConclusion\nIndividuals traverse multiple locations in both physical\nand network space. Twitter captures information about\nthese interactions and movements from which research-\ners can infer attributes of individuals and their social\nrelationships. In this essay, we considered three exam-\nples that are relevant to a broad range of academic and\npractical applications. These examples highlight the\nparadox of highly active users--those who generate\nmost Twitter content. Because they generate more\ndata points with which to measure their behavior,\nhighly active users are less vulnerable to random meas-\nurement error, yet they are more vulnerable to system-\natic mis-classification when researchers make naive\nassumptions about the distribution of user activity.\nThe paradox of highly active users can be addressed\nby developing methods that handle the complexities\nand multidimensionality of social life represented in\nthe data. The need to do so will intensify as an increas-\ning proportion of the population establishes their\nonline and social media presence with more complete\npictures of their lives painted in digital form.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publi-\ncation of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial sup-\nport for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: The authors would like to acknowledge the receipt of\nresearch funding from MINERVA Initiative, Department of\nReferences\nBroniatowski DA, Paul MJ and Dredze M (2013) National\nand local influenza surveillance through Twitter: An ana-\nCompton R, Jurgens D and Allen D (2014) Geotagging one\nhundred million twitter accounts with total variation mini-\nmization.
