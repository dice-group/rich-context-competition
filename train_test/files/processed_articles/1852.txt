We examined the\nassociation that kidney function, based on glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) estimated from serum creatinine, has\nwith serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and components\nof the metabolic syndrome among 14679 participants in the\nThird National Health and Nutrition  \n(NHANES III). In this analysis, adjusted mean serum\n25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly lower only in the\neGFR compared to those with normal kidney function (61.6\ninversely associated, independent of each other, with\nhomeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance\n(HOMA-IR), adjusting for confounders. Participants with\nhigh 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (481nmol/l) had lower\nHOMA-IR. We conclude that 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency\nis not as prevalent in the US general population with\ndecreased eGFR as previously reported in patients with CKD;\nand that vitamin D and kidney function have independent\ninverse associations with IR.\nKEYWORDS: 25-vitamin D; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome; kidney\nfunction; glomerular filtration rate; calcitriol\nSerum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are the measure of\nbody stores of vitamin D.1 A reduction of serum 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D levels, the substrate for the kidney and\nother tissues for the generation of calcitriol (1,25(OH)2\n),\nproduces secondary hyperparathyroidism,2\u00ad4 reduced bone\nmineral density,4 and increased rates of hip fracture5 in\nindividuals with normal kidney function. The parathyroid\nhormone\u00advitamin D axis plays a central role in calcium and\nphosphate homeostasis in patients with chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD).6 The recent Kidney Disease Outcomes\nQuality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Bone\nMineral Metabolism and Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease\nhave recommended the measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin\nD levels in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4|the rationale\nbeing that low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are likely to\nplay a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyr-\noidism by limiting the synthesis of calcitriol (1,25(OH)2\nVitamin D has also been recognized to have numerous\nnon-calcemic functions.8 Specifically, there is increasing\nevidence that vitamin D metabolism affects the risk of\ninsulin resistance (IR), diabetes, and of the metabolic\nsyndrome,9\u00ad11 although the underlying molecular mechanism\nof this association remains to be elucidated.\nRecently, human studies have shown diminished insulin-\nstimulated glucose uptake in uremic patients.12 IR in patients\nwith kidney disease is accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and\nglucose intolerance.13,14 Chen et al.15 identified a significant\nrelationship between IR, insulin levels, and risk of CKD\ndefined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\nThus, kidney dysfunction appears to be associated with a\nsyndrome of IR and several explanations have been proposed,\nincluding, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, or uremic tox-\nthat low vitamin D levels are associated with various\nmeasures of impaired glucose metabolism and diabetes risk\nin people with normal kidney function, it seems reasonable\nto propose that IR in patients with CKD may also be\nassociated with reduced levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.\nThere appear to be no reports on the association between\n25-hydroxivitamin D status and kidney function at the\noriginal article http://www.kidney-international.org\n& 2007 International Society of Nephrology\nCorrespondence: M Chonchol, Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension,\nUniversity of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado 80262.\nE-mail: Michel.Chonchol@uchsc.edu\npopulation level. Previous reports come from small clinic-\nbased samples6,18,19 and may not represent the true associa-\ntion between vitamin D status and kidney function in the\ngeneral population. However, the survey with the largest\nnumber of people with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nmeasurements (nearly 20 000) appears to be the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition  \n(NHANES III), a national cross-sectional survey representa-\nnumber of people with concurrent blood measurements of\n25-hydroxyvitamin D, fasting glucose, insulin, and kidney\nfunction provides an ideal opportunity to determine whether\nvitamin D status is related to IR in participants with CKD.\nRESULTS\nVariables associated with vitamin D\nMean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were\nhigher in males than females and declined with increasing\nage. There were significant ethnic variations in 25-hydro-\nxyvitamin D levels, reflected in means that were higher in\nnon-Hispanic whites, intermediate in Mexican Americans,\nand lower in non-Hispanic blacks (Table 1). Mean serum\nvitamin D levels decreased with increasing body mass index\n(BMI) quintile, and increased with increasing frequency\nin the last month of physical activity and of drinking milk\nor having milk on cereal, and with increasing daily dose\nof vitamin D supplements (Table 1).

Mean BMI and waist circumference, both measures\nof body fat, were raised in participants with mild, moderate,\nand severe kidney dysfunction compared to those with\nnormal kidney function. The fasting insulin concentration\nwas significantly higher in participants with mild, moderate,\nand severe kidney dysfunction, reflecting a state of hyper-\ninsulinemia. Concomitantly, there was an inverse relationship\nbetween eGFR and insulin sensitivity after adjusting for age,\nsex, ethnicity, and BMI (Table 2). Thus, HOMA-IR was\nsignificantly higher in participants with mild, moderate, and\nsevere decrease in kidney function, compared to those with\nnormal kidney function, independent of obesity level.\nFurthermore, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were\nhigher in participants with kidney dysfunction, whereas high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower only in\nparticipants with moderate and severely impaired kidney\nfunction, compared to those with normal function. Both\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly\nhigher in participants with moderate decrease in eGFR\ncompared to those with normal eGFR. Participants with and\nwithout antihypertensive treatment had significantly higher\nHOMA-IR and insulin levels at all stages of kidney\ndysfunction when compared to patients with normal kidney\nDecreased kidney function, vitamin D, and HOMA-IR\nTo further evaluate the relationship between eGFR, 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D levels, and IR, we stratified participants\naccording to level of kidney dysfunction and quartile of\nserum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Table 3). Stage of kidney\ndysfunction and quartile of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were each\ninversely associated with levels of HOMA-IR and fasting\ninsulin, adjusting for demographic variables and BMI,\nindicating that eGFR function and 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nhave independent associations with IR. No evidence of a\nstatistical significant interaction between these two variables\nDISCUSSION\nThere are several important findings in this study. In this\nanalysis, we have demonstrated in a large sample representa-\ntive of the adult US population that significant vitamin D\ninsufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D 40\u00ad75 nmol/l), as defined\nby the recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative\nClinical Practice Guidelines for Bone Mineral Metabolism\nand Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease, is only present in\nparticipants with severely decreased kidney function (GFR,\nfunction are not lower than levels in participants with normal\ndecreased serum vitamin D levels in people with severely\ndecreased kidney function is independent of age, gender,\nethnicity, and lifestyle variables known to affect vitamin D\nstatus, such as BMI, physical activity, and intake of milk and\nM Chonchol and R Scragg: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, insulin resistance, and CKD original article\nvitamin D supplements. In conjunction with previous\nstudies, this analysis highlights the direct relation-\nship between kidney disease, IR, and other components of\nthe metabolic syndrome. This analysis suggests that the\nassociation between kidney disease and IR is independent\nof vitamin D status.\nTo our knowledge, there are few reports of 25-hydro-\nxyvitamin D levels at varying degrees of decreased kidney\nTable 1 | Mean (s.e.) and mean difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (nmol/l) by level of demographic variables, lifestyle\nvariables influencing vitamin D status, and eGFR category\nVariable N Mean (s.e.)

Although no differences\nwere noted in fasting glucose levels between the eGFR groups,\ntriglycerides showed the same pattern as insulin, with levels\nincreasing as eGFR declined, after adjustment for BMI. The\npresence of IR in patients with kidney dysfunction is of\ninterest because it may contribute to preglomerular vaso-\ndilatation and glomerular hypertension.22,23 Moreover, the\nassociation of IR and hypertriglyceredemia in patients with\nkidney disease might also explain the excessive cardiovascular\nEpidemiological studies of the general population have\nindicated a close association between insulin sensitivity,\ndiabetes, and the metabolic syndrome with serum levels of\n25-hydrovitamin D.9\u00ad11 We have shown an inverse association\nbetween 25-hydroxyvitamn D levels and HOMA-IR in the\ngeneral population. The lack of interaction between 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D and degree of kidney dysfunction on level\nof IR suggests that both variables affect IR by independent\nmechanisms. HOMA-IR was only decreased in participants\nwith serum 25-hydrovitamin D 481 nmol/l. This cutpoint is\nwell above the 25-hydrovitamin D level recommended by the\nrecent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical\nPractice Guidelines for Bone Mineral Metabolism and\nDisease in Chronic Kidney Disease. Almost all tissues and\ncells in the body possess vitamin D receptors, including\nbrain, heart, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle cells, pancreas,\nactivated T and B lymphocytes, and monocytes.8,25,26\nPancreas and skeletal muscle,27 key components of the IR\nsyndrome might be a potential explanation of the association\nof IR and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency.\nThe current study has several strengths. First, NHANES III\nused uniform methods to collect data on 25-hydroxyvitamin\nD, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR. Second, the NHANES III\ndesign allows results to be extrapolated to the entire US\ncivilian non-institutionalized population of the early 1990s.\nDespite the comprehensive nature of the data set, there are\nlimitations inherent in cross-sectional design. We cannot be\ncertain that vitamin D status affected IR rather than vice\nversa. Further, there are no direct measures of GFR and\ninsulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose\nclamp) in this study. However, the measurement error from\nestimating these two variables is likely to have been non-\ndifferential, resulting in attenuation of associations with\nother variables observed in this report.28\nIn summary, our study has shown that significant 25-\nhydrodyvitamin D insufficiency, as defined by the recent\nKidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative mineral meta-\nbolism guidelines, is encountered in people with CKD stage\n4, and that 25-hydroxyvitamin D stores in early stages of\nkidney disease appear to be adequate. In addition, IR is\npresent in early stages of kidney dysfunction and has an\ninverse association with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. As IR is\na known cardiovascular risk factor, the correlation found in\nour study would suggest the hypotheisis that low serum levels\nof 25-hydroxyvitamin D is a potential cardiovascular risk\nfactor and that serum calcidiol levels higher than those\npresently reccomended for CKD patients might decrease the\nrisk for cardiovascular disease.29 Further studies are needed\nto confirm our findings and to determine possible mecha-\nmisms of any preventive effect from 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nagainst IR in patients with kidney dysfunction.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention carried out a cross-sectional survey\nrepresentative of the US civilian non-institutionalized population\nsampling design was used, with over-sampling of non-Hispanic\nblacks and Mexican-Americans. Participants were recruited from\nhousehold clusters, and initially interviewed at home, followed by an\nextensive physical examination carried out at mobile examination\ncenters. Full details of the survey methods, including sampling,\ninterview, examination, and laboratory measurement of blood\nsamples, have been published.30\nIn the home interview, information was collected on a wide\nrange of variables including: age, sex, ethnicity (self-assigned as\neither non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American,\nOther), past history of ever being told by a doctor or other health\nprofessional of having hypertension or diabetes, and whether\ncurrently taking antihypertensive medication.30 Information was\nalso collected at the home interview on the following covariates: the\nfrequency of intake of milk and supplements (including vitamin D)\nin the previous month; and the number of times a range of common\nphysical activities were undertaken during leisure time in the\nprevious month. Metabolic equivalents were assigned for each\nphysical activity, and participants classified as doing moderate or\nvigorous activity based on their age.31\nAt the mobile examination centers, participants were dressed in\nunderpants, disposable light clothing, and slippers while being\nweighed on electronic scales in kilograms, to two decimal places.\nHeight was measured with a fixed stadiometer to the nearest\nmillimeter. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of height in meters. Blood pressure was measured at the\nmobile examination centers by physicians with mercury sphygmo-\nmanometers using a standard protocol.30\nBlood samples collected during the examination were centri-\nfuged, aliquoted, and frozen to \u00c0701C on site, and shipped on dry\nice to central laboratories where they were stored at \u00c0701C until\nanalysis.30 Serum creatinine measurements were performed at a\ncentral laboratory (White Sands Research Center, Almogordo, NM,\nUSA) by means of the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction using a Hitachi\n737 analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN,\nUSA) and reported using conventional units (1 mg/dl \u00bc 88.4 mmol/\nl). The levels of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total\ncholesterol, and triglycerides were measured enzymatically with a\nHitachi 704 Analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indiana-\npolis, IN, USA). The serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nconcentration was calculated using the Friedewald equation (i.e.,\nlow-density lipoprotein \u00bc total cholesterol\u00c0high density cholesterol\u00c0\neGFR was estimated using the following equation from the\nModification of Diet in Kidney Dysfunction Study, after subtracting\n0.23 mmol/l from serum creatinine measured in NHANES III:32\noriginal article M Chonchol and R Scragg: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, insulin resistance, and CKD\nPlasma glucose was measured by a modified hexokinase\nenzymatic method, and separate radioimmunoassay methods used\nto measure serum insulin.30 HOMA-IR was calculated using fasting\nglucose and insulin measurements ((fasting insulin (mU/ml)*fasting\nsured by a radioimmunoassay after extraction with acetonitrile.30\nSerum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ranged from 8.7 to\n243.6 nmol/l not including one person with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D\ncenters.

The REGRESS procedure was used to estimate adjusted\nmeans of continuous outcome variables. For variables with skewed\ndistributions (triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR), the natural\nlogarithm was used in statistical analyses and tolerance factors (anti-\nloge\n(1.96 \u00c2 s.e.)) calculated in place of standard errors.
