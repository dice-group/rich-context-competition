EGF and PGE2 concentrations in serum\nand gastric juice from patients with LGIN were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nPresence of H. pylori infection was assessed in patients with LGIN and healthy controls.\nResults: Out of 5 638 patients and 548 controls, H. pylori infection in patients with chronic gastritis\nwas associated with disease type (endoscopic classification) and disease severity. Patients with H.\npylori-positive LGIN had significantly higher concentrations of serum EGF and lower concentra-\ntions of serum PGE2 versus patients with H. pylori-negative LGIN. Serum EGF and PGE2 levels in\npatients with LGIN were not significantly associated with disease type, but were significantly\nassociated with disease severity.\nConclusions: H. pylori infection was associated with chronic gastritis type (endoscopic\nclassification) and disease severity. Abnormal EGF and PGE2 levels may be associated with H.\npylori-positive LGIN in Han Chinese patients in central China.\n",

Thus, in the present\nstudy, prevalence of H. pylori infection, and\nthe relationship between H. pylori infection\nand type of chronic gastritis (assessed via\ngastroscope), and disease severity, were\nanalysed in Han Chinese patients with\nchronic gastritis in central China. Serum\nand gastric juice levels of EGF and PGE2\nin patients with LGIN were also\ndetermined.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nIn this prospective observational study,\nChinese patients with chronic gastritis\nbeing treated at the Central Hospital of\nWuhan, Wuhan, China were sequentially\nThere were no predefined exclusion criteria.\nGastric mucosal biopsy was performed\non consecutive patients with chronic gastri-\ntis undergoing diagnostic gastroscopy.\nEndoscopic classification of chronic gastritis\nwas categorized into superficial gastritis,\nerosive gastritis, haemorrhagic gastritis or\natrophic gastritis according to the Dalian\nAcademic Conference criteria of the Chinese\nSociety of Digestive Endoscopy.7 LGIN was\ndetermined according to the WHO\nClassification of Tumours of the Digestive\nSystem.1 The severity of chronic gastritis\nwas classified according to pathology (mild;\nmoderate; severe).8\nFor analysis of EGF and PGE2 concen-\ntrations in serum and gastric juice, a random\nsubgroup of patients with LGIN were\nselected from the patients with chronic\ngastritis. Pathological and endoscopic diag-\nnoses of all patients were performed by three\nindependent pathologists and three inde-\npendent endoscopists from The Central\nHospital of Wuhan.\nAge- and sex-matched healthy controls\nwere selected from medical staff of The\nCentral Hospital of Wuhan, and from\nhealthy volunteers in the same geographic\narea of Wuhan city. Healthy controls were\nethnically matched, had no symptoms\nsuggestive of chronic digestive tract disease\nand had no personal or family history of\ngastric cancer.\nThe study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of The Central Hospital of\nWuhan, and written informed consent was\nobtained from all study participants.\nDetection of H. pylori infection\nRapid urease and C14 breath tests were\nperformed in patients with chronic gastritis\nand healthy controls, to investigate the\npresence of H. pylori infection. Participants\nwere considered to be H. pylori-positive if\nboth tests gave a positive result.\nRapid urease tests were performed by\nplacing an endoscopic biopsy specimen into\na small amount of solution containing urea,\nphenol red and preservatives. In the\npresence of H. pylori, bacterial urease\nhydrolysed the urea and produced ammo-\nnia, resulting in a yellow-to-red colour\nchange. Results were read between 1 min\nand 24 h. C14 breath tests were performed as\nfollows: Each participant swallowed a cap-\nsule of urea labelled with 37 kBq (1 mCi) of\nC14 and after 10 min was asked to exhale\ninto a balloon (Heliprobe BreathCardTM,\nKibion, Stockhom, Sweden), to collect a\nbreath sample, until the indicator membrane\nchanged colour from orange to yellow. In\nthe presence of H. pylori in the stomach,\nurea would be converted into C14-labelled\ncarbon dioxide by urease enzyme. Samples\nwith values 25 counts per min (cpm) were\nconsidered negative for H. pylori; those with\nvalues !50 cpm were considered positive for\nH. pylori infection.\nDetermination of EGF and PGE2\nconcentrations\nA total of 4 ml venous blood from each\npatient with LGIN was collected into serum\nseparator tubes and allowed to clot for\n30 min at room temperature, followed by\ntemperature. All serum samples were stored\nGastric juice samples were collected from\npatients with LGIN into 4 ml centrifuge\ntubes, and with 20 min following collection,\nroom temperature. The supernatant was\nthen separated into a 2 ml RNase-free cen-\ntrifuge tube and stored at \u00c070C until use.\nThe EGF and PGE2 concentrations in\nserum and gastric juice of patients with LGIN\nwere measured by human EGF enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit\nMedsystems, Vienna, Austria) and prosta-\nglandin E2 high sensitivity ELISA Kit (Cat.\nMA, USA), respectively, according to the\nmanufacturer's protocols. Plates were read at\nfor EGF and PGE2, respectively, with detec-\ntion sensitivity for EGF and PGE2 of 0.26pg/\nml and 8.26pg/ml, respectively. Each sample\nwas tested in triplicate.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, USA). The sample size was esti-\nmated at the 0.05 level of significance with a\ntwo-sided test, and 88% statistical power to\ndetect an effect with a relative risk of 2.0.\nBetween-group comparisons of the H. pylori\ninfection rate were performed using 2-test.\nContinuous variables were presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD, and were statistically analysed\nusing two-tailed, Student's t-test and one-\nway analysis of variance. A P value < 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nResults\nand 548 age- and sex-matched healthy con-\nincluded in this study.

In patients with chronic gastritis,\nthe prevalence of H. pylori infection was\nhigher in patients with erosive gastritis\ncompared with superficial gastritis, higher in\npatients with severe inflammation than in\npatients with mild or moderate inflamma-\ntion, and higher in patients with LGIN\ncompared with non-LGIN.\nThe current results suggested that the\nprevalence of H. pylori infection may be\nassociated with the status of inflammation\nof chronic gastritis, and might present a risk\neffect for gastric precancerous lesions. A\nstudy of Romanian patients with chronic\ngastritis9 showed that all histological\nchanges were strongly related to H. pylori\ninfection and H. pylori infection was higher\nin patients with gastric intraepithelial neo-\nplasia versus those without gastric intrae-\npithelial neoplasia.\nIntestinal metaplasia is associated with\nH. pylori infection, smoking, bile reflux and\na high-salt diet.10 H. pylori infection might\nbe implicated in the pathogenesis of gastric\nmucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia\nby induction of the host inflammatory and\nimmune response, or by cytotoxins, such\nas vacuolating cytotoxin A or cytotoxin-\nassociated gene A.11 H. pylori infection has\nbeen suggested to cause an imbalance\nbetween apoptosis and proliferation in\nnormal gastric epithelial cells, which is revers-\nible after H. pylori eradication.12 In addition,\nintraepithelial neoplasia has been shown as\nan important step in the occurrence of gastric\ncancer induced by H. pylori infection.13 In\ngeneral, H. pylori infection is thought to\ncause gastric cancer in an indirect way.3\nThe current study provided evidence that\npatients with H. pylori-positive LGIN had\nsignificantly higher serum EGF and lower\nserum PGE2 concentrations than patients\nwith H. pylori-negative LGIN. Serum con-\ncentrations of EGF and PGE2 in patients\nwith LGIN were analysed following strati-\nfication by endoscopic classification and\ndisease severity. Serum EGF and PGE2\nconcentrations in patients with LGIN were\nnot significantly associated with endoscopic\ndisease classification, but there was a\nTable 3.

Therefore,\nfurther studies with a larger sample size are\nnecessary to explore the biological mechan-\nism and investigate the specific biomarkers\nof gastric precancerous lesions.\nIn conclusion, in this small-scale study,\nthe prevalence of H. pylori infection was\nhigher in Han Chinese patients from central\nChina who had chronic gastritis, compared\nwith healthy controls, in the current study.\nIn addition, H. pylori infection was asso-\nciated with chronic gastritis type (classified\nby endoscopy) and disease severity. In add-\nition, high levels of serum EGF and low\nlevels of serum PGE2 were observed in H.\npylori-positive patients with LGIN, and\nwere associated with disease severity.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis project was supported by grants from the\nNatural Science Foundation of China\nProgram of Higher Education of China\nReferences\n1.
