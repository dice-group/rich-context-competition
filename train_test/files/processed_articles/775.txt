Some of these inconsistencies may in part be\ndue to methodology, arising from the retrospective\nnature of previous research (Lachs, Berkman, Fulmer,\n& Horwitz, 1994). Besides the recall biases inherent in\nretrospective designs, the impact of changing risk\nfactors is poorly captured in these studies. For exam-\nple, it has been our clinical experience that the mere\npresence of cognitive or functional impairment is not\nnearly as compelling a risk factor for mistreatment as\nthe trajectory of the decline -- such as, the acute\nworsening of these impairments that can occur after\na prolonged hospitalization.\nIn this study we report on risk factors for reported\nand verified elder abuse and neglect in a cohort of\n2,812 community-dwelling older adults followed over\na 9-year period. Cases were identified through a state\nsocial service agency (the ombudsman's protective\nservices for the elderly program) charged with as-\nsessment and advocacy for frail or disenfranchised\nelderly persons, a subset of whom have experienced\nelder mistreatment. Risk factors for entering this so-\ncial welfare system for any reason have been re-\nported previously (Lachs et al., 1994; Lachs, Williams,\nMethods\nThe study was conducted by linking an estab-\nlished cohort of older adults with records from\nConnecticut's Ombudsman on Aging (the state en-\ntity responsible for investigating and adjudicating\ncases of elder abuse, neglect, self-neglect, exploita-\ntion, or abandonment occurring in the community\nor long-term care facilities). Detailed descriptions of\nthe cohort and the referral pathway for ombudsman\ninvestigation have been reported previously (Lachs\net al., 1994). Briefly, New Haven, Connecticut, is the\nsite of a National Institute on Aging EPESE cohort\n(Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies\nin the Elderly; National Institute on Aging, 1986).\nThis stratified probability sample of 2,812 adults\nover the age of 65 was assembled on the basis of\nhousing type and sex; nearly one in seven older\nadults living in the city in 1981 was enrolled. At co-\nhort inception the median age was 75 years; men\nwere oversampled so that the sample consisted of\nracial, and social backgrounds. In 1982 a detailed\nin-person baseline interview was performed cover-\ning several domains including demographics, func-\ntional and cognitive status, chronic diseases, self-\nperceived health, social networks, leisure activities,\nlife events, depression, and a number of other areas.\nStandardized instruments were used wherever possi-\nble, and periodic inter-rater reliability studies were\nconducted among interviewers to ensure data qual-\nity. After the inception interview, cohort members\ncontinue to have annual reinterviews by phone, and\nin-person interviews every third year.\nSince 1978, the State Ombudsman on Aging has\nhad responsibility for investigating cases of elder\nabuse and neglect in Connecticut. Reports come to\nthe office from a variety of sources including manda-\ntory reporters (health care professionals and para-\nprofessionals whose work puts them in regular con-\ntact with older adults), and non-mandatory reporters.\nSuspicion alone is grounds for reporting in Con-\nnecticut. Once a call is received, the ombudsman\nmust make an on-site visit within 5 days to investi-\ngate. This process involves contacting all parties able\nto provide information in addition to an interview\nwith the older adult and, if possible, the alleged per-\npetrators of the mistreatment. After completing the\nevaluation, the ombudsman deems the cases to be\neither substantiated or uncorroborated.\nConnecticut Definitions and Major Outcome\nof the Study\nIn Connecticut, elder abuse is defined as the will-\nful infliction of physical pain, injury, or mental an-\nguish, or the willful deprivation by a caretaker of\nservices necessary to maintain physical and mental\nhealth. Neglect is defined as inability by an elderly\nperson living alone to provide him- or herself the\nservices necessary to maintain physical and mental\nhealth, or failure by the responsible caretaker to\nprovide such services. Thus, under Connecticut def-\ninitions it is possible to be self-neglected. Exploita-\ntion is defined as taking advantage of an older adult\nfor monetary gain or profit.\nThe major outcome of this study was reported and\ncorroborated elder abuse and/or neglect, including\nexploitation, by a party other than the older adult\noccurring at any point during the 9-year follow-up\nperiod. Subjects who were investigated by the om-\nbudsman for \"self-neglect\" or who had abuse or\nneglect investigations that were not corroborated\nwere excluded from the analyses (i.e., from both the\nmistreated group and the comparison group of co-\nhort members not investigated by the ombudsman).\nIn several cases, cohort members had several om-\nbudsman investigations over the follow-up period,\nsometimes for different allegations; those individu-\nals were deemed to have experienced the outcome\nof any corroborated allegation in any investigation\nincluded abuse, neglect (exclusive of self-neglect),\nor exploitation.\nThe process whereby cohort members were iden-\ntified as ombudsman clients during the follow-up\nperiod has also been described previously. This in-\nvolved a manual \"matching\" of state and cohort\nrecords for all ombudsman clients whose demo-\ngraphic features corresponded to the initial eligibil-\nity criteria of the cohort. Extensive confidentiality\nsafeguards were devised to protect the identity of\nall subjects; the final merged data set contained no\ninformation that would permit the identification of\nany individual.\nStrategy of Analysis\nA crude and sampling-adjusted prevalence was\ncalculated for reported elder abuse and neglect over\nthe 9-year follow-up period. Subsequent analyses\ncompared the prevalence of risk factors in cohort\nmembers who experienced reported elder abuse\nand neglect with these risk factors in to those who\ndid not. These analyses were also weighted for the\nsampling mechanism of the cohort. Potential risk fac-\ntors were selected on the basis of (a) an extensive\ntheoretical literature review on the causes of elder\nmistreatment (Johnson, 1991), (b) risk factors found\nin a review of prior studies (Lachs & Pillemer, 1995),\nand (c) the principal investigator's (ML) clinical expe-\nrience in this area. Risk factors were broadly classi-\nfied into four domains -- sociodemographic, clinical,\nphysical function, and social network.\nWe were especially interested in the role of func-\ntional and cognitive impairment in the genesis of\nelder mistreatment; prior retrospective research has\nshown these variables to be inconsistent predictors\nof mistreatment. Specifically, we were interested in\nlooking at functional status as dynamic risk factors\nfor mistreatment [i.e., the development of new ac-\ntivity of daily living (ADD impairment or worsening\ncognitive ability rather than considering these vari-\nables cross-sectionally]. The longitudinal nature of\nthe E\nP\nE\nS\nE study permitted such analysis.\nPooled logistic regression analysis was used to ex-\namine the predictors of initial investigation for abuse\nor neglect (Cupples, D'Agostino, Anderson, & Kan-\nnel, 1988). This method was chosen to allow for up-\ndating of the predictor variables, which more fully\nutilizes the longitudinal nature of the study. Further,\nit permits individuals who are lost from the study\n(due to death or nursing home placement) to be in-\ncluded until the time they are lost. Because many of\nthe potential risk factors of interest (e.g., cognitive\nstatus and social networks) were assessed at only the\ntriennial face-to-face interviews, the 9-year follow-up\nwas divided into three 3-year intervals for this analy-\nsis. According to this strategy, each of three observa-\nwas included as a separate record for each subject in\na \"pooled sample.\" For each record, the risk factors\nwere updated using each subject's status at the be-\nginning of the interval; the outcome for each partici-\npant was whether mistreatment had been investi-\ngated and corroborated during that interval. The\nnumber of records each individual contributed to\nthis pooled sampled depended upon three factors,\nwhich determined when the subject was at risk for\nthe outcome. First, subjects who had experienced\nmistreatment during an interval were coded as\nhaving the outcome during that interval and were\ndropped from subsequent intervals. Second, individ-\nuals who died during an interval were dropped from\nsubsequent intervals. Finally, individuals who en-\ntered long-term care facilities were dropped from in-\ntervals subsequent to their placement, as they were\nno longer capable of experiencing the outcome of\ninterest (i.e., community elder mistreatment). Al-\nthough the ombudsman in Connecticut has respon-\nsibility for the investigation of abuse, neglect, and\nquality-of-care issues arising in nursing homes, insti-\ntutional abuse was not an outcome of the study.\nOnly 3% of cohort members interviewed in nursing\nhomes returned to the community; therefore, we felt\nthat treating nursing home admission as perma-\nnently removing a person from risk of community in-\nvestigation should not bias the results. Utilizing this\nhort were included in the study; they contributed a\ntotal of 6,222 observations to the pooled sample.\nEach potential risk factor was first evaluated in a\npooled model that included only that variable and a\nvariable indicating the observation interval. It was as-\nsumed that the odds ratio associated with a given\nrisk factor was the same across intervals. This as-\nsumption was tested by running another model for\neach variable that also included an interaction term\nbetween the risk factor and the interval. An alpha\nlevel of .01 was stipulated as the boundary for signifi-\ncant risk factor-by-interval interaction. Next, each risk\nfactor was included in a model that adjusted for age,\nsex, race, and household income as well as the inter-\nval. Finally, a model was constructed that included\nthe sociodemographic features and statistically sig-\nnificant risk factors from each domain; here an alpha\nlevel of 0.2 was the criterion for model inclusion.\nData management and preliminary analyses were\nconducted using SAS software (SAS Institute, 1989).\nAll hypothesis testing and multivariate analysis was\nconducted using SUDAAN in order to account for\nthe sampling design (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1995).\nResults\nbers of the cohort were seen by the ombudsman on\n267 separate occasions for any indication. Of those\ninvestigations, 81 (30%) were for elder abuse and ne-\nglect, and 57 (70%) of the investigations were sub-\nexperienced the outcome of reported elder abuse\nand neglect for a sampling-adjusted 9-year preva-\ncases were for abuse, 8 (17%) were for exploitation,\nand 30 (64%) were for neglect by another party. The\nmost common perpetrators of mistreatment were\nadult children (45%), followed by spouses (26%).\nOther perpetrators of mistreatment included grand-\nchildren and paid caregivers.\nTable 1 shows bivariate comparisons of selected\nTable 1.

Among sociodemographic features, non-\nWhite race, low income, and advanced age at in-\nterval inception were significantly associated with\nexperiencing reported elder abuse and neglect.\nWith respect to the functional status domain, the\npresence of any ADL impairment as well as the\nnumber of ADL impairments at interval inception\nwere both associated with the outcome. Mistreated\nsubjects also had nearly twice the prevalence of\nhigher impairments as measured by standardized\nsuch as doing housework, climbing stairs, and writ-\ning or handling small objects (p < .01).

Not surprisingly, the resulting picture of the\nolder adult at risk has varied considerably. At first\nthe \"typical\" elder abuse victim was reproducibly\nfrail, female, and cognitively and functionally im-\npaired. Subsequent studies found no relationship\nbetween gender, frailty, cognitive and functional\nstatus, and marital status. In pilot work we have ar-\ngued that the source of these divergent findings\nmay be methodologic (Lachs et al., 1994). In this first\nprospective, longitudinal study of elder mistreat-\nment based on a large, well characterized commu-\nnity-based sample, risk factor data were obtained\nrepeatedly using standardized instruments. Several\nrisk factors emerged as potent predictors of re-\nported elder mistreatment including poverty, race,\nfunctional and cognitive impairment, worsening\ncognitive impairment, and living with someone.\nOne limitation of our study is the mechanism of\nelder mistreatment case-finding, which is essentially a\nsocial welfare system (adult protective services). This\nprobably influences the finding of race and poverty\nas important risk factors, in all likelihood overestimat-\ning their contribution due to (a) reporting bias and (b)\nthe potential confounding of poverty and race. The\nmore developed literature on child abuse has exam-\nined the relationship between sociocultural factors\nand child abuse, and these have recently been re-\nviewed by Korbin (1995). With respect to reporting\nbias, sociodemographic features are believed to influ-\nence physician attribution of child abuse in suspected\ncases (O'Toole, Turbett, & Nalepka, 1983). In the hos-\npital setting, for example, almost half of cases meet-\ning criteria for child abuse were not reported to pro-\ntective service agencies in one study, and non-White\nrace was among the factors associated with preferen-\ntial reporting (Hampton & Newberger, 1985). Al-\nthough some studies have shown minority families to\nbe overrepresented in child abuse protective service\nregistries (Lauderdale, Valiunas, & Anderson, 1980),\nthe relative contribution of reporting biases has also\nbeen challenged (Jason, Andereck, Marks, & Tyler,\n1982). With respect to the potential confounding\nbetween race and poverty in the study of family vio-\nlence, at least one study of child abuse involving fami-\nlies receiving Aid to Dependent Families With Chil-\ndren (AFDC) found that Black families tended to be\nthe more materially deprived than White families\nparticipating in the program (Horowitz & Wolock,\n1981). This would suggest that in some settings,\npoverty is indeed a confounder with respect to race.\nOur results also suggest that there is some similar\neconomic confounding in elder mistreatment, but\npoverty and minority status remained significant\nwhen other sociodemographic features were in-\ncluded in multivariate models. The degree to which\nreporting and ascertainment bias additionally affect\nour results is unknown, but clearly a social welfare\nsystem that preferentially enrolls low-income minor-\nity cases will cause an overestimate of the influence\nof these features. With respect to other sociodemo-\ngraphic variables, age was an additional risk factor for\nmistreatment in this study, but gender conferred no\nadditional risk. This is consistent with more recent\ncase-control studies of elder abuse.\nIn addition to its influence on sociodemographic\nrisk factors, reporting bias is probably responsible\nfor the relatively low prevalence (1.6%) of mistreat-\nment in the cohort in comparison to community-\nbased prevalence studies that have used self-report\nas the basis for point prevalence calculations (3.2%\nin the most widely quoted study [Pillemer & Finkel-\nhor, 1988]). Adult protective service registries prob-\nably detect only a fraction of actual cases, as many\nmay not be reported to official agencies. The net ef-\nfect of this decreased sensitivity is to lower the\npower of the study to detect statistically significant\nodds ratios given the finite sample site of the co-\nhort. However, many odds ratios reached statistical\nsignificance in this research, which is likely to be\nthe largest cohort study of elder mistreatment of\nany conducted in the near future.\nFunctional status is perhaps the most controversial\nof elder abuse risk factors. This study found that the\nnumber of ADL impairments, higher functional im-\npairment, and cognitive impairment were risk factors\nfor mistreatment. Additionally, the development of\nworsening cognitive impairment was an especially\npotent predictor. As for the role that functional im-\npairments play in the genesis of mistreatment, some\nexperts have argued that they are directly causative,\nwhereas others contend that it permits the perpetua-\ntion of abuse as the victimized older adult with func-\ntional disability is incapable of defending him- or\nherself. Unlike sociodemographic features, we do\nnot believe reporting bias to substantially influence\nthese findings; if mistreated subjects exist within the\ngroup of cohort members currently identified as\n\"non-abused,\" the effect would be to underestimate\nthe magnitude of the risk conferred by predictors\nsuch as cognitive impairment.\nWith respect to social network factors, only living\nalone was significantly associated with protecting\nolder adults from mistreatment. Obviously, to be\nabused or neglected requires the presence of a per-\npetrator, but some have argued for the isolation\ntheory of mistreatment, wherein mistreatment is\nprompted by a dwindling social network that comes\nultimately to include only the abuser or neglecter.\nOur data provide some support for this theory as\nthe number of social ties (measured by standard-\nized social network instruments) was lower in mis-\ntreated subjects in bivariate analysis, yet 80% of mis-\ntreated subjects lived with another party.\nWe recognize other limitations of our study. First\nand foremost, this study considered only character-\nistics of the victims of mistreatment and not the\nperpetrators. Abuser-specific theories of mistreat-\nment abound, and there are certainly traits of\nabusers (e.g., alcohol and substance abuse, prior\nhistory of violence, prior history of family violence)\nthat should alert clinicians to high-risk situations\nbeyond the factors already identified. Unfortunately,\nwe do not have abuser data in the same detail as for\nvictims of mistreatment. Second, the outcome in\nthis study included abuse, neglect, and exploitation;\nit is conceivable that risk factors might be different\nfor each and that our study is measuring an \"aver-\nage\" effect. The relatively low event rate prevents\nus from looking at these outcomes individually, and\nalso causes many of the parameter estimates for in-\ndividual risk factors to be unstable. We also chose\nto exclude cases of \"self-neglect\" in our study, a\nlarge part of the work of adult protective service\nagencies in addition to elder abuse and neglect. We\ndid this based on our clinical experience with pro-\ntective service clients, as we believe self-neglect to\nbe a distinct entity with a likely different \"risk factor\nprofile\" (i.e., a higher prevalence of cognitive and\nfunctional impairment).\nIn summary, poverty, minority status, functional\ndisability, and worsening cognitive impairment\nwere risk factors for reported elder mistreatment in\nthis 9-year longitudinal study of elder mistreatment,\nand the influence of race and poverty were proba-\nbly overestimated by reporting bias. Clinicians\nshould be (Particularly aware of high-risk situations\nin which functional and/or cognitive impairment are\npresent, especially in circumstances where violent\nbehavior has been known to exist previously.1\nReferences\nCupples, L A., D'Agostino, R.
