Second, we present a population of scientists\nand provide a heuristic visualization--as \"paragliders\"--of their position in this multilevel structure. Third, we cluster these\nactors into groups of performance to better understand who is in a multilevel position to make progress with performance\nmeasurements over time. We use Ronald Burt's representation of the combined effect of brokerage beyond group and\nclosure within group to show that several of these performance groups do not follow his own principles very closely.\nFourth, we provide evidence, for one of these groups, of the usefulness of combining constraint in the personal network\nof its members with constraint in their \"extended\" network--that is, for looking at the relationship between performance\nand borrowing from \"dual alters\" in the extended network. This shows that, when it is present, network lift from three-\nlevel structural wings is provided by different levels for different actors. Hypotheses induced by the paraglider metaphor can\nthus be tested progressively to provide new understandings of the structural conditions under which the Matthew effect of\ncumulative advantage operates.

This\ndescriptive article contributes to the literature explaining and\nevaluating performance by emphasizing both individual and\norganizational contexts intertwined. It proposes a new three-\nlevel network approach to analyze cumulative advantage at\nthe individual, intra-organizational, and inter-organizational\nlevels. It uses a structural metaphor for this cumulative advan-\ntage, the superposed wings of a paraglider, and builds around\nthis metaphor to explore the usefulness of extended networks\nfor understanding performance data as measured at the indi-\nvidual level. It thus provides a new structural translation of\nthe kind of cumulative advantage that Merton (1968), in his\nfamous paper, called \"Matthew effect.\"\nThe complexity of conceptualizing and analyzing the\nMatthew effect has often been addressed by existing research.\nSince Merton's seminal paper on how advantage begets fur-\nther advantage in science, the Matthew effect has been stud-\nied in many social situations in which populations fall behind\nin terms of abilities (Rigney, 2010). A network analytical\nperspective was developed by Price (1976; see also Mullins\net al., 1977) in his article on networks of scientific papers,\nshowing a preferential attachment mechanism among aggre-\ngated journal\u00adjournal citation networks and expressing it as\na negatively exponential function, an approach further devel-\noped by statistical physicists following Barab\u00e1si and Albert\nexplain this effect as concentration of status on specific\nmembers: actors confer status on others when they perceive\nThe structural wings of Matthew effects:\nThe contribution of three-level network\ndata to the analysis of cumulative advantage\nEmmanuel Lazega1 and Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Jourda2\n Keywords\nMeso-level Matthew effect, cumulative advantage, multilevel networks, paraglider, productivity, performance, inequality,\nscientists, relational capital, borrowing\n1Sciences Po-Paris, CSO-CNRS, SPC, Paris, France\n2CEPEL-CNRS, Montpellier, France\nCorresponding author:\nEmmanuel Lazega, Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, CSO-CNRS, SPC,\nEmail: emmanuel.lazega@sciencespo.fr\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\nthat their peers do the same. Snijders (2011) provides meas-\nurements for this transitivity as an endogenous effect in his\nanalyses of relational turnover in longitudinal network data,\nbut defines the Matthew effect as self-reinforcing popularity\nin such networks, thus using centrality for prominence that\nincreases over time.\nThe social science literature on the link between networks\nand performance, however, is dominated by Burt's (1992,\ndense ties within their workgroup and high brokerage beyond\nthe group. Burt's work shows that members benefit from bro-\nkerage and structural holes unless they are in a highly depend-\nent situation. In the latter case, they can try to borrow someone\nelse's (a champion's, a mentor's) relational capital to reach\nthe same levels of performance as their average competitors.\nBorrowing social capital can be an efficient strategy for\nmembers who suffer from a lack of legitimacy (e.g. women in\na male-dominated organization): it consists of benefiting\nfrom a colleague's or a superior's support through a use of the\nlatter's network. Setting aside the case of such actors, who\nare considered to be socially illegitimate (\"not one of us\") by\nthe majority of mainstream members, neighbor networks are\npresented as relatively useless for performance (Burt, 2010).\nIn this article, our contribution is to propose an organiza-\ntion-based approach to Burt's \"borrowing\" for which one\nneeds three levels of network data to measure an additional\ndimension of the Matthew effect, that is, an effect based on\nwhat Lazega et al. (2013) call an extended opportunity\nstructure. Here we are inspired by Breiger's (1974) theory of\nduality, that is, of co-constitution of individuals and groups,\nto provide an extra determinant of Matthew effects that are\ninextricably individual and collective. We generalize Burt's\ntheory by assuming that all members (not only dominated\nmembers considered socially illegitimate) of an organiza-\ntion can borrow relational capital from other members\nthrough indirect and affiliation ties in a multilevel context.\nIn our view, this is equivalent to \"augmenting\" individual\nnetworks. Translated in Burt's terms, adding a third level of\nanalysis suggests that performance increases when an actor\nhas dense ties within group, high brokerage beyond the\ngroup, and the opportunity to access an organizationally\naugmented network.\nUsing this three-level approach to borrowing and perfor-\nmance, we therefore argue that borrowing can be much more\nwidespread than previously assumed. By looking at the inter-\norganizational context as well, via \"expanded\" or \"org-aug-\nmented\" networks, we show that sharing relational capital\nwithin one's organization and borrowing relational capital\nfrom outside one's organization (via colleagues and bosses\nor by using the name of one's organization) add to members'\nperformance. Because it brings into the picture \"dual alters\"\n(potential contact accessible by closing a multilevel four-\ncycle) and complementary resources, this three-level\napproach helps understand rather invisible dimensions of the\nMatthew effect. Indeed previous work has shown that when\nfocal actors' dual alters are rich in resources that are comple-\nmentary to the resources of these focal actors, including\nthese dual alters in the model improves explanations of the\nfocal actors' performances and returns on organizational\ninvestments. In other words, this inclusion of dual alters\nreshapes members' opportunity structure.\nHere, the analysis is carried out on a small population of\nelite scientists in public research, the French field of onco-\nedge is recognized as efficient.All individuals are \"sublime\"\nin terms of productivity, with four papers per semester pub-\nlished in internationally visible journals over five successive\nsemesters. Cumulative advantage mechanisms can be seen\nas a mix of economic and social mechanisms, in the sense\nthat scientists who participate in the production of a suc-\ncessful publication are rewarded by obtaining resources that\nhelp them carry on with research, such as funding, free time,\nstimulating laboratories, talented students (Allison et al.,\n1982) that, in turn, help them win \"scientific tournaments\"\nin which the winner (the first to publish a result) takes all.\nBut these scientists are also, as identified by Merton (1968,\n1973), recognized by colleagues in terms of citations and\nreputation that go to already well-known researchers who\ncan thus build a dominant position in their specialty and\nimpose their \"scientific orthodoxies\" (Mulkay, 1972)--\nwhereas unnoticed researchers accumulate obstacles and\noften end up exiting the system.\nThis gives a chance to combined individual and organi-\nzational network dimensions of productivity to become vis-\nible. Since Lotka (1926), productivity of scientists is known\nto have a very asymmetrical distribution with a minority of\nvery prolific scientists and a majority of scientists with a\nmuch smaller contribution to the publications in any single\ndomain. This asymmetry reflects a hierarchy in terms of\nproductivity and this hierarchy is known to be not only per-\nsistent over time but also self-reinforcing, with amplifica-\ntion of inequalities within a given generation of researchers.\nThis is especially the case when these patterns are com-\nbined with individual skills and strategies, and with organi-\nzational dimensions of scientific activities. For example,\nBellotti (2012) shows that being in a brokerage position is\nextremely important for getting funding. Lazega et al.\ntheir peer networks and the centrality and size of the labo-\nratories in which these researchers are affiliated can be\ncombined elements of a structural explanation of scientific\nperformance over time.\nThe \"paragliding\" visualization of cumulative advantage\nthat we propose for the superposed levels of collective\nagency is based on a complex combination of these three\nkinds of network measurements, which is how it captures\nsome of the multilevel relational processes producing\ntogether a meso-level Matthew effect. With the data structure\nrepresented by this paragliding metaphor, we account for\nvariance unexplained by Burt's model. The characteristics\nLazega and Jourda 3\nthat make the potential networks (i.e. top surface of the para-\nglider) ascending or crashing is the specific constraint that\nthey exercise on the individual researcher and the high or\nstrong complementarity of resources that researchers can\naccess through them (Lazega et al., 2013).\nThis three-level dataset includes and combines inter-labo-\nratory networks, inter-individual networks within a specific\nsubpopulation of scientists in that field, egocentric networks,\nand performance variations (impact factor (IF) scores associ-\nated with these researchers' publications) as measured at the\nindividual level. Thus, network paragliders allow sociolo-\ngists to measure the extent to which individual scientists'\nperformance depends on the characteristics of the adminis-\ntrative unit in which they belong, on their position in the sys-\ntem of collective action in which they both cooperate and\ncompete, and on the structure and composition of their per-\nsonalized ego-network of collaborators. This unexplored\ndimension of cumulative advantage is thus based on effects\nthat are a combination of individual, organization and `indus-\ntry level effects.\nThe article is structured as follows. We first present our\nthree-level dataset and the specificity of the data structure\nthat we use to explore cumulative advantage. Second, we\nprovide a heuristic visualization of the combination of levels\nas paragliders. Third, we cluster the scientists into groups of\nperformance to better understand who is in a multilevel posi-\ntion to make progress with performance measurements over\ntime. We use Burt's representation of the combined effect of\nbrokerage beyond group and closure within group to show\nthat several of these performance groups do not follow his\nown principles very closely. Fourth, we provide evidence,\nfor one of these groups, of the usefulness of combining con-\nstraint in the personal network of individuals and in their\nextended network, that is, for looking at the relationship\nbetween borrowing from dual alters and performance.\nFinally, we list current limitations of this three-level approach\nto the Matthew effect as examined here.\nA three-level network dataset\nThe following section briefly describes the manner in which\nwe selected the population, collected the data, and studied\nthis milieu.\nPopulation and data\nMembers of this population were identified by the number of\narticles published in scientific journals between 1996 and\n1998. The numbers are based on the Cancerlit database of the\nUS National Library of Medicine. The criterion used was a\nthreshold of 25 papers over the period of 2.5 years. The list\nof scientists selected based on this criterion includes differ-\nent types of actors: those who publish heavily, those who\nco-publish heavily, and those who are present in the list of\nauthors because they provide technical help, or because they\nrun the laboratory. Following \"Lotka's law\" (Lotka, 1926),\nthe vast majority of researchers working on a specific prob-\nlem only publish one article about the problem. A very small,\nbut more prolific minority of scientists publish the majority\nof their articles in a specific domain. In this list, we selected\nprecisely those who, while based in France, had published\nthe most (including in international journals) in cancer\nresearch during this period.\nSelecting these scientists who are already at the top of\ntheir field to study who becomes highly productive through\ncumulative advantage may seem paradoxical. A different\nsample including much less productive scientists would have\nprovided more variation in productivity. However, we found\nthat there was already enough variability in this population\nof \"sublime\" scientists to explore the issue of cumulative\nadvantage. Even the scientists and laboratories with lower\nperformance scores are still more elite than other French can-\ncer researchers at the time. This should not matter for the\ndevelopment of the method and its potential uses because the\nselection criterion and the list of names used in the study do\nnot eliminate differences between the most productive and\nsuccessful cancer researchers.\nThe sample was reduced to the first 168 researchers\nbecause this number represents all of the scientists who met\nthe 25+ publications criterion. The construction of the meas-\nure of actors' performance is based on the IF of the journals\nin which each researcher has published. IF scores are limited\nas measurements of performance and they have long been\ncriticized by information scientists and sociologists (Fox,\ntime. We therefore used them based on the year when a sci-\nentist published in the journal. All IF scores were computed\nusing the same database, that is, PubMed in which Cancerlit\nwas merged. The correlation between the number of publica-\ntions and the IF scores of the individual's publications is\n0.37. The score was calculated for publications with multiple\nco-authors in the following way. If a researcher published\nfour articles in a journal, the IF score of that journal was\nmultiplied by 4. IF scores of all publications were summed\nfor each individual. We did not take into account the fact that\na researcher was publishing alone or in a team: each person\nmentioned as a co-author received the same score. We could\nhave divided the score by the number of co-authors, but this\nprocedure seemed even more problematic than our proce-\ndure since we did not have any information about who did\nwhat for each paper. The researchers in the population\nreceived the full IF even if they were co-author #10 on a\nteam of 15, not a fraction based on their rank and the size of\nthe team.\nan interview. Few central names are missing from our net-\nwork. Most of the researchers who declined to be interviewed\nwere rarely, if ever, selected from the list of names that was\npresented to the participants who did agree to be interviewed.\n4 Methodological Innovations\nTheir indegree centralities were very low in the relational\nnetworks of their French colleagues. We determined that few\nimportant names were missing by showing the list of those\nmissing to several researchers who were reinterviewed after\nfieldwork, as well as to the cancerologists on the board of the\nnon-profit organization that funded this research. Despite\nmeeting the formal criterion to be included in the population,\nmost were at the periphery of this network.\nFollowing the strategy of structural linked design, we\ntried to interview all the directors of the laboratories to which\nthese researchers belonged. In total, we interviewed (face-to-\nface) 82 laboratory directors in the system of French cancer\nresearch. In 51 of the 128 cases, the selected researcher is\nalso the director of his/her laboratory; these persons agreed\nto two interviews (one as a researcher, one as a laboratory\ndirector) and responded to the two questionnaires. Insofar as,\nfor various reasons, some directors of laboratory were inter-\nviewed but not the researcher in their laboratory, or the\nresearcher but not the director, we are left with 93 researcher/\ndirector \"pairs.\" Thus, the number of researchers that we are\nable, thanks to the structural linked design, to position in the\ndual system of superposed interdependencies is finally 93.\nAll further network results at either level refer to the net-\nworks formed by these 93 pairs.\nData structure for network measurement and\nvisualization of cumulative advantage\nNext, the multilevel networks of interdependencies in France\nin 1999 were reconstituted. First, the inter-organizational\nnetworks between the majority of laboratories involved in\ncancer research; second, the advice networks constructed by\nthe members of the \"elite.\" This was done in the following\nmanner. At the individual level, each researcher is consid-\nered a \"scientific entrepreneur\" who needs resources that\nmay be social or financial. From the individual researcher's\npoint of view, research may be analytically broken down into\nfive steps: selecting a line of research, finding institutional\nsupport, finding sources of financing, recruiting personnel,\nand publishing articles. The five steps were identified based\non ethnographic work with the researchers and discussion of\nwhere they really thought they needed advice. At each step,\nthe researchers depend upon their relational capital and seek\nadvice from other members of the research community in\norder to handle these uncertainties. In this competitive envi-\nronment, access to advisors is an important resource because\ncarrying out these tasks is facilitated by access to advice\noffered by competent colleagues who agree to help.\nScientific work was thus reduced analytically to a\nsequence of five non-routine tasks, each one characterized\nby a strong degree of uncertainty. The assumption that\nresearchers follow five sequential steps, beginning with\nselecting a line of research and ending with publication,\nseems very simplified. This process is often not linear or\nrational. For example, researchers often choose their research\nquestions on the basis of available funding. While this is a\nsimplification, it provides quite a complex view of the pro-\ncess in terms of networks. A different advice network was\ncollected at each step, which was hard work for the inter-\nviewees. In addition, these steps are used here purely analyti-\ncally and we do not carry out any sequential analysis. Indeed,\nin the analyses below, we aggregate the five advice networks\nto derive our network variables.\nIn order to reconstitute the resulting system of interde-\npendencies among actors at the inter-individual level (within\nthe elite), we asked the actors to identify those from whom,\nin the list of the 168 cancer researchers presented to them,\nthey sought advice to handle these challenges at each step. It\nwas thus possible to reconstitute one advice network per\nstep: one network dealing with choices about the direction of\nprojects, one for helping to find institutional support, one for\nhandling financial resources, one helping with recruitment,\nand finally one network of colleagues to whom researchers\nsend their manuscripts for advice before submitting them to\njournals. Other data were also collected about the researchers\nthemselves: their attributes, their performances, and their\nopinions in several domains. Finally, each individual\nresearcher was asked about the composition of his/her imme-\ndiate workgroup, that is, collaboration ego-network, and\nabout ties among the members of this workgroup, as in Burt\nAt the inter-organizational level, we also collected sys-\ntematic data about inter-laboratory networks and about labo-\nratory characteristics. Whereas talent is everywhere, a\nlongstanding challenge for smaller laboratories and their\nresearchers has been poor access to various kinds of\nresources. All in this system, including researchers in small\nlaboratories, must rely on informal access through personal-\nized relationships, which does not help level the competitive\nfield. Some are shut out from the circuits of tacit knowledge,\nthe exchange of which is socially and strategically driven,\nwhich highly benefits the larger organizations.\nThe laboratory directors indicated with which other labo-\nratories, among those practicing cancer research in France,\ntheir laboratory exchanged different types of resources. The\nlist of reconstituted transfers and exchanges includes recruit-\nment of post-docs and researchers, development of programs\nof joint research, joint responses to tender offers, sharing of\ntechnical equipment, sharing of experimental material,\nmobility of administrative personnel, and invitations to con-\nferences and seminars. The complete inter-organizational\nnetwork examined here is the aggregated and dichotomized\nnetwork of all these flows. Dichotomization created a tie\nbetween two individuals or organizations if there was at least\none tie between them in one of the aggregated matrices.\nTo summarize, at the inter-individual level, five advice\nnetworks are aggregated and dichotomized to reconstitute a\ncomplete network density of 0.06 with average degree of\n8.8. In this network, the reciprocation rate is 0.36. Likewise,\nthe inter-organizational network reaches a density of 0.04\nLazega and Jourda 5\nwith average degree of 6; the reciprocation rate is 0.39. This\nshows strong relational activity in this system, at both\nlevels. Collaboration ego-networks, which can be considered\nto be intermediary-level relational infrastructures (Lazega,\nmeasurements (Burt, 1992).1 The reconstitution of this com-\nplex system of interdependencies at three levels of collec-\ntive agency provides a realistic specification of multilevel\nsources of productivity. It also provides a basis for a struc-\ntural explanation of cumulative advantage and performance\nmeasured at the individual level. Figure 1 represents the\nthree levels of network data in the same space.\nPerformance measured at the individual level, but pro-\nduced by the supporting organization in which the individual\nbelongs, makes obvious sense in the life of scientific\nresearchers. At each step of their work, laboratories provide\ntheir members with economic, social, and technical resources.\nFor example, when a new researcher arrives in a laboratory,\nhe or she benefits from established cooperative relationships\nbetween the laboratory and other laboratories, and also from\nthe reputation and sometimes the networks of its director.\nRegular institutional budgets and funds raised for specific\nscientific projects represent obvious causal factors for per-\nformance measured at the individual level and, in the end, for\nobtaining high IF scores. Therefore, performance may simul-\ntaneously depend on the characteristics of the laboratory,\nincluding its position in the network of exchanges between\nlaboratories, and on the characteristics of individuals, includ-\ning their positions in the network of exchanges between\nthem. Likewise, performance may depend on the combined\nstructural characteristics of the laboratory and the researcher\nbecause their interdependencies are based on the comple-\nmentary nature of resources provided by each level. In addi-\ntion, the composition and structure of teams working with\nthese researchers also matter in explaining performance\nmeasured at the individual level.\nFigure 1. Multilevel network data structure for visualization of cumulative advantage.\nBased on the data collected in this project, each researcher in the dataset has four types of networks. A first network of advisors composed of alters that\nare his/her own personal contacts among the other researchers in the observed population at the time of fieldwork. These contacts are represented as\nblue dots. A second network of alters that are both his/her contacts and that of his/her laboratory because they belong to laboratories with which his/her\nown laboratory has exchanges of several types of inter-organizational resources. These contacts, who are common to the researcher and his/her laboratory,\nare represented as blue dots above a pink rectangle. A third network of dual alters who can be reached by ego through inter-organizational ties between\nego's laboratory and alter's laboratory. These dual alters are accessible through the inter-organizational network but who are not yet accessed by ego.\nThey are represented as pink rectangles. Finally, each researcher has a team of close collaborators that is represented as an ego-network in green. There\nis no overlap in this dataset between this team and the direct contacts among the other members of this population of scientists.\n6 Methodological Innovations\nFinally, the combination of such levels can also have spe-\ncific cross-level effects. For example, a latent and expanded\nnetwork built on multiplex and multilevel ties can account\nfor part of performance measured at the individual level.\nThis is what we call organizational augmentation of individ-\nual performance based on his/her \"extended\" opportunity\nstructure (Lazega et al., 2013). This adds a multiplex dimen-\nsion to multilevel positioning through linked design,\nsuggesting the notion of a latent and expanded network in\nwhich both the nodes and the edges are nested within organi-\nzational units, but the ties can be among nodes of different\norganizational units. Actors have a complex inter-individual\nnetwork at the personal level combined with an inter-organi-\nzational network at the collective level. The latter is based on\naffiliation ties or personal ties with colleagues or managers\n(hierarchical superiors) who themselves have ties in other\nFigure 2. Tetradic substructure of organizational extension of social capital.\nRed star is a potential contact, a dual alter who is part of Researcher 1's potential relational capital accessible through direct tie with Lab Director 1 and\nindirect tie with Lab Director 2. Dotted edge represents a potential collaboration tie for Researcher 1. Other black nodes represent direct contacts of\nResearcher 1 as observed in his/her declared advice network.\nFigure 3. Ascending paraglider.\nLazega and Jourda 7\norganizations. We simply add the two networks and treat the\n\"augmented\" network as a latent structure mixing \"actual\"\nand \"potential\" relational capital. As shown in Figure 2, this\norganizationally augmented network is constructed by add-\ning to an observed network of actors i all the potential ties to\nactors k that i can access through their manager and through\nthe manager's ties to other managers at the inter-organiza-\ntional level. We assume that this potential can be more easily\nrealized by individual actors than creation of new ties, pro-\nvided that members and managers get along reasonably well\nin terms of cooperation in their organization.\nOf course, managers' ties do not represent all the rela-\ntional possibilities offered by the organization; peers can also\nbroker ties to new contacts. All researchers do not benefit in\nthe same way from potential ties. However, sharing rela-\ntional capital is part of a manager's job (at least in theory)\nand including this potential represents an additional dimen-\nsion of network measurements of status. It is equivalent to a\nmultilevel use of Burt's concept of \"borrowing\" social capi-\ntal. Lazega et al. (2013) provide a multilevel analysis where\nperformance at time 1 interacts with network variables to\ngenerate even greater performance in time 2.\nScientists as network paragliders and\nnetwork lift\nThis three-level structure based on the organizationally aug-\nmented latent network can be represented by a figure that looks\nlike a multilevel paraglider. In this figure, actors are character-\nized by the three superposed networks: a personal network at\nthe intra-organizational level is located at the bottom of the\nparachute; an observed inter-individual network at the inter-\norganizational level is located at the middle of the parachute;\nthe augmented or expanded inter-individual network at the\ninter-organizational level is located at the top of the parachute.\nThe paragliding metaphor points to variance unexplained by\nBurt's model of structural advantage based exclusively on bro-\nkerage and closure in the network of direct ties.\nWe distinguish two kinds of paragliders: ascending and\ncrashing. The characteristics that make the augmented net-\nworks (i.e. top surface of the paraglider) ascending or crash-\ning is the specific constraint that they exercise on the\nindividual researcher and the high or strong complementarity\nof resources that researchers can access through them\n(Lazega et al., 2013). In the first situation, as represented in\nFigure 3, the org-augmented network helps individual mem-\nbers increase their performance; in this situation, borrowing\nrelational capital helps when centrality provides resources,\nneighbors provide complementary resources, and the ego-\nnetwork is capable of collective action. In Figure 4, the org-\naugmented network has a negative effect on performance as\nmeasured at the individual level; borrowing relational capital\ndetracts from performance when a peripheral position\ndecreases access to resources, dual alters provide \"more of\nthe same\" resources, and one's ego-network is not capable of\ncollective action. In this situation, borrowing represents a\nhandicap in terms of performance and we therefore call this\na crashing paraglider.\nThis multilevel network visualization is a representation of\nposition and status as superposed structural wings. It is heu-\nristic because it shows the contribution of multiple and super-\nposed levels of collective agency to the very definition of\nstatus. Of course, hierarchy is one component of status in that\nrespect, but not the only one, as outlined in the introduction.\nThe superposition of forms of collective agency is also a mat-\nter of affiliation and membership, not only of hierarchy.\nExploring cumulative advantage in\ncomplex multilevel effects\nA simplified measurement of performance (increasing or\ndecreasing) provides insufficient responses to the question of\nwhat accounts for this performance when explanatory factors\ninclude dual positioning and strategy (Lazega et al., 2008).\nIn order to enrich these explanations, we cluster researchers\nin terms of specialties and in terms of performance levels\nover time.\nClustering researchers into performance groups\nAnalyzing performances at the individual level for all\nresearchers in the population provides six categories of such\nperformances over 10\nyears. In order to better explain\nFigure 4. \"Crashing\" paraglider.\n8 Methodological Innovations\nperformances, we calculated for each researcher: (1) his/her\nposition compared to the average annual performance of all\nresearchers, and (2) the evolution of this IF score compared to\nresearchers were clustered into one of the six \"IF career\"\ngroups. Figure 5 visualizes the evolution of performances for\neach performance group. Clustering was performed by group-\ning the researchers with similar trajectories. We looked at\nwhose performance was stable, increasing, or decreasing over\ntime and compared to the overall mean at each point in time.\nClustering researchers in groups of performance helps in\nunderstanding who is in a multilevel position to make pro-\ngress with IF scores over time. Figure 5 presents these evolu-\ntions for the six groups of performance identified by this\nanalysis. Group 1, the \"top of the top\" in terms of perfor-\nmance, are always above average and progressing towards\nthe top. Group 2 are also above average during the two peri-\nods, but they do not make much progress over time. Group 4's\nperformances decrease: they start above the mean in Period 1\nand are below in Period 2. Group 3 start below the mean in\nPeriod 1 but are in the amazing position of trying to catch up\nwith Group 1 in the second period. Group 5, although below\nthe mean in both periods, make progress during the second\nperiod. Group 6 performances are below the mean in Period 1\nand decrease even further during Period 2.\nAs already mentioned, Burt's (2005) theory argues that\nperformance increases when actors have dense ties within\ntheir workgroup and high brokerage beyond the group. This\nis represented in Figure 6.\nFigure 5. Moving means of Impact Factor scores (1996\u00ad2005): six groups of performance levels for 126 researchers in the population.\nNetwork measurements were carried out at Time 3, at the end of the first period.\nFigure 6. Burt's (2005) representation of combined effect\nof brokerage beyond group and closure within group on\nperformance.\nLazega and Jourda 9\nThis type of visualization focuses on the relation between\nconstraints and the evolution of performance. Stagnating\nperformances are located at the bottom; improving perfor-\nmances are located at the top, and in between evolutions in\nan intermediary position. Except for members who are often\nostracized as not being \"one of us\" and who are in a highly\ndependent situation,2 this picture suggests that performance\nshould reach a maximal value represented by the A letter\nwhen brokerage beyond group and closure within group are\nat their highest levels. Following this argument, we map\nthe two values for each of the six groups of performance\nobserved in this population of scientists based on the average\nconstraint in the ego-network of collaborators and the aver-\nage number of structural holes in the observed network. As\nexpected from Figures 5 and 6, cumulating the right values\nfor the two sources of performance produces cumulative\nadvantage akin to a meso-level Matthew effect only for two\ngroups (performance groups 1 and 3).\nIn Figure 7, we make these outcomes comparable, thus\nshowing how constraint along one dimension varies with\nconstraint along the other dimension. Adding this informa-\ntion on the 3D visualization, we can check the position of\neach performance group compared to Burt's A, B, C, and D\nperformance points in Figure 6. This shows that the two\ngroups that increase their performance the most during the\nsecond period are performance groups 1 and 3. Both are well\npositioned on Burt's graph, although far from the strongest\nperformances predicted by his theoretical platform. Group 2\nis closest to the lowest performances. Groups 4 (- -) and 5\n(+ +) would have intermediary performances on average.\nIn short, when averaged within groups of performance, sci-\nentific outcomes do not follow Burt's principles very closely\nat the beginning of Period 1 and based on the observed net-\nwork (i.e. without borrowing). But this nevertheless supports\nthe idea that the good position of Group 1 is caused by the\nconfigurations of both of these networks. The strong network\nconstraint within group and weak constraint beyond group for\nboth Groups 1 and 3 are stepping stones for future higher per-\nformance, that is, over time. The lowest position (intermediary\nin D) of researchers of Group 4 could be a cause for the strong\ndecrease in their performance during the second period (they\nstart above the overall mean during Period 1 and end up below\nthe mean during Period 2). The same is true for Group 5 except\nthat its modest increase remains below the mean. Groups 2\nand 6 stagnate the most, whether above or below the overall\nmean, and are closest to Burt's point C.\nFigure 7. Mapping the average effect of brokerage beyond group and closure within group on average performance for each of the six\ngroups at the end of Period 1.\n10 Methodological Innovations\nBased on averages computed for each performance group,\nGroup 3 is the closest to the point representing high perfor-\nmance in this type of visualization and Group 2 is closest to\nthe lowest, with Groups 4 and 5 displaying average perfor-\nmances. This visualization confirms the good position of the\ngroups that increase their performances over time, including\nthe catchers up, who are located close to the \"right\" places in\nBurt's terms. It is more difficult to provide a straightforward\nexplanation for the position of Group 4 in D and Group 5 in\nB. Is it an explanation for Group 4's important slump in the\nsecond period? Of the modest catching up by Group 5 in the\nsecond period given its low performances in the first? Groups\n2 and 6, being groups with stagnating performances, whether\nwith high performances or with low ones, are both located\nclose to point C.\nHaving identified members who both have constraining\nwork groups and who are brokers beyond their group, we\nrealize that, although Burt's approach is confirmed for some\nperformance groups, it is not confirmed for others. Constraint\nlevels in both networks seem to play a clear role for some\ngroups, facilitating cumulative advantage for Groups 1 and\n3, but not for the others. This is where we propose to add,\nbased on our paragliders' heuristic, another possible meas-\nurement of cumulative advantage: a measurement of inter-\norganizational network lift. The purpose of introducing this\nmeasurement is to show that what was left unexplained by\nBurt's approach can be explained by the same measurements\nbut in the extended network constructed on borrowing. In\neffect, we argued above that the position of the individual's\norganization in the inter-organizational context of this indus-\ntry can provide additional and different resources for cumu-\nlative advantage and performance. The inter-organizational\ncontext of the organization in which actors operate has been\nrecognized by the literature as an important context. Here,\nwe combine both approaches. We do so in two complemen-\ntary ways. We first show that brokerage beyond the group is\nimproved for most performance groups by its measurement\nin the extended network, that is, the network including poten-\ntial ties (dual alters) reached through tetradic substructures.\nSecond, we then focus on the nature of the resources that can\nbe reached through potential ties, in particular their relative\nutility and complementarity with respect to resources that\nactors already have in their observed network.\nRich-get-richer through borrowing\nfrom the organization and access to\ndual alters\nThis unexplored dimension of cumulative advantage is based\non effects that are a combination of individual and organiza-\ntional level effects. The interesting aspect of these results is\nthat they confirm Breiger's theory of duality, that is, of co-\nconstitution of individuals and groups, thus providing an\nextra determinant of Matthew effects that are unextricably\nindividual and collective.\nTwo groups of researchers are of particular interest for\nillustrating our point. Group 1 of top performers with an\nascending paraglider, and Group 4 of lower level performers\nwith a crashing paraglider. When comparing brokerage, con-\nstraints, and performances in the observed networks (as in\nBurt) with the same measurements in the expanded networks,\nwe obtain the following results.As represented in Figure 8(a)\nand (b), Group 1 comparison shows that borrowing increases\nbrokerage and helps with performance: this confirms the\nexistence of a Matthew effect but only for the haves. The\nmore the researchers who are already top performers borrow\ncomplementary resources from their neighbors, the higher\ntheir performance is likely to become. In contrast, as repre-\nsented in Figure 9(a) and (b), for members of Group 4, the\nhave-nots, whose performances decrease over time, borrow-\ning does not increase performance. The extended network\nhas a different effect here. Within this group, performances\nof researchers do not react positively to variations in con-\nstraint in both networks: the expanded advice network wors-\nens their performance.\nUsing structural wings for measurement of cumulative\nadvantage combining two levels of the paraglider (constraint\nin the personal network and in the observed network) seems\nto be a good method for understanding and explaining pro-\nductivity and status of some categories of actors in the social\nsetting. Combining two other levels (constraint in the per-\nsonal network and in the extended network) provides a good\nmethod for understanding and explaining productivity and\nstatus of other categories of actors. This suggests that differ-\nentiating the input (complementary vs. redundant resources)\nin observed networks from potential resources coming from\ndirect or dual neighbors provides a better understanding of\nvariations in cumulative advantage. When it is present, net-\nwork lift from three-level structural wings is provided by dif-\nferent levels for different actors. Hypotheses induced by the\nparaglider metaphor can thus be tested progressively to pro-\nvide new understandings of the structural conditions under\nwhich the Matthew effect of cumulative advantage operates.\n\"More of the same\" can be useful in this context. Burt was\nprimarily concerned with information and knowledge from\ndiverse ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage provides\na \"vision advantage\" that individuals can profit from. In\nBurt's case, closure, and by extension having \"more of the\nsame thing,\" is suboptimal because it insulates the focal\nactor from new ideas. Still, Burt argued that closure also has\nbenefits, such as helping to build trust and get things done.\nThere are some advantages to be gained from \"more of the\nsame\" in the advice networks in our population. The main\njustification for constructing advice networks is that they\nhelp scientists and directors make decisions in conditions of\nuncertainty at multiple stages of the research process.\nObviously there are benefits to having more information. But\nthe benefits of closure include trust, capacity of mobiliza-\ntion, and homogeneous advice, which makes it easier to act\ndecisively. Being in brokerage positions might maximize\nLazega and Jourda 11\nnew information, but it might also result in contradictory\nadvice and low levels of trust. This could have negative\ninfluences on performance in conditions of uncertainty.\nHowever, in our case, the specificity of our dataset\ntends to underscore the value of complementary resources.\nEmpirical results show precisely that the value of closure\nvaries with the kind of group, that is, with the level of perfor-\nmance. Thus, there is value in using three-level data and in\nlooking at how dual alters are likely to increase focal actors'\nperformance by modifying their opportunity structures.\nConclusion\nThis study examined the Matthew effect (the strong get\nstronger, the weak stay weak or become weaker) with a\nsample of highly productive cancer researchers from France\namong whom strong differences exist in terms of per-\nformance as measured at the individual level. We used\nmultilevel network data through linked design to further\nexplore the articulation of teams, inter-individual and inter-\norganizational networks of scientists. We proposed that a\nthree-level \"paragliding\" visualization of cumulative advan-\ntage based on a complex combination of different network\nmeasurements has heuristic value as the \"structural wings\"\nof cumulative advantage. Exploratory analyses of such\ndata show that this visualization captures some of the com-\nplex relational processes producing together a meso-level\nMatthew effect.\nWe outlined this three-level network approach to the\nMatthew effect as a multilevel complement to Burt's\napproach of the relationship between position in networks\nand performance. The specificity of the data structure (com-\nbination of levels) that we use to explore cumulative advan-\ntage was visualized as paragliders. We then clustered the\nscientists whom we interviewed into groups of performance\nto better understand who was in a multilevel position to make\nprogress with performance measurements over time. We\nused Burt's representation of the combined effect of broker-\nage beyond group and closure within group to show that sev-\neral of these performance groups do not follow his principles\nvery closely. We provided evidence, for one of these groups,\nof the usefulness of combining constraint in the personal net-\nwork of individuals and in their extended network, that is, for\nlooking at the relationship between borrowing relational\ncapital from the organization (and reaching dual alters in the\nexpanded network) and performance. This showed that,\nFigure 8. Borrowing through tetradic substructures for actors with an ascending paraglider: (a) constraint in observed network and\n(b) constraint in expanded network.\nIn Group 1, comparisons carried out at the end of Period 1 show that borrowing increases brokerage and will help with performance during Period 2.\n12 Methodological Innovations\nwhen it is present, network lift from three-level structural\nwings is provided by different levels for different actors.\nHypotheses induced by the paraglider metaphor can thus be\ntested progressively to provide new understandings of the\nstructural conditions under which the Matthew effect of\ncumulative advantage works.\nAs presented here, this three-level perspective on the\nMatthew effect has several limitations that should be dealt\nwith in further explorations of this approach to cumulative\nadvantage. Future studies will need a more inclusive and\ncomparative selection criteria for the population to test this\nmethod for a larger sample of researchers including research-\ners with lower productivity as measured at the individual\nlevel. Adjustments need also to be made for cases where an\nactor was both a researcher and a laboratory director, and\ntherefore belonged to two sets of actors. In addition, effects\nidentified here should be more systematically tested using\nmultilevel exponential random graph models (ERGMs)\n(Wang et al., 2013). In that respect, much remains to be done.\nProductivity and performance are strong preoccupations\nin the organizational society and in economies dominated by\nthe capacity of hierarchical superiors to expose subordinates\nand people below them in social stratification to increasingly\nopen competition. This multilevel approach to performance\nquestions in many ways the capacity of hierarchical superi-\nors to overcome vertical competition with their subordinates\nto improve these subordinates' performance by helping them\nin reaching the right dual alters. Our results suggest that\nmore research is needed on managerial behavior, responsi-\nbility, and contribution to collective performance that is less\nfocused on decision making (as it was during the past four\ngenerations), and more on relational abilities and strategies,\nfor example on help for subordinates to borrow from the\nsocial capital of the organization, even if this capital is in part\nthe managers' own relational capital.\n"
