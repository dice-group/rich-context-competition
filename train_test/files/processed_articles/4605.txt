Learning occurs intentionally in\nformalInstructionalsettingsandincidentallythroughexperience.\nLearning encompasses a multitude of competencies, from\nknowledge of simple facts to great skill in complex and difficult\nprocedures. Learning sometimes requires great effort and\nsometimes proceeds with relative ease. These are a few of the\nthings we know about learning. But learning is a complex affair.\nThe results of learning are often observable in human\nperformance, but the process of learning is much less obvious.\nAs a consequence, different theories have been developed to\nexplain learning. These theories represent different perspectives,\ndifferent assumptions, and different beliefs about learning.\"\n\"What exactly is a \"religious learning process\" . . . is, conversely,\nnot easy to define.\"\n[Translated from the original German text]\nIntroduction\nAs a practical theologian, specializing in the field of religious\neducation and religious pedagogy, I, and my international col-\nleagues, deal with the concept of learning. Our research on\nlearning is carried out in practical theological studies on the\npractices of religious education, whether in church communi-\nties or in schools or wherever these practices are located.\nIncreasingly, the primary focus is shifting from religious\neducation toward studying young people in certain faith\npractices, which emphasize the concept of learning in aca-\ndemic studies (see, for example, Sonnenberg & Barnard,\n2012). Although learning is becoming a common feature in\nmany practical theological studies on young people in faith\npractices, the way learning is conceptualized varies. This is\nmy observation in various research projects conducted by\nour Research Centre for Youth, Church & Culture (OJKC)1\nand has been my observation in the international field of aca-\ndemic studies on youth ministry and religious education.\nBecause learning is an important factor in the reflection\non young people in faith practices, I will argue in this article\nthat practical theological studies could profit from a clarifi-\ncation of the concept, including an explanation of different\nangles of use involved in current research and publications.\nLearning in general, for example, is often conceived of as a\npersisting change in performance or performance potential\n(Driscoll, 2000). Faith learning in particular, then, can be\nconceived as a particular change in how one performs in the\nreligious domain. However, sometimes we see faith learning\nexplained as a form of meaning-making process, whereas\n1Protestant Theological University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\nCorresponding Author:\nMC Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nEmail: adekock@pthu.nl\nWhat About Learning in Practical\nTheological Studies? Toward More\nConceptual Clarity\nA. (Jos) de Kock1\n Keywords\nlearning, practical theology, religious education, formation, children, adolescents\n2 SAGE Open\nother authors approach the concept of learning as part of\nsocialization processes, which is another angle of use.\nBy way of illustration of different angles of use of the con-\ncept, the article briefly describes current research projects car-\nried out at our OJKC (section \"Illustration: Current Research\nin the Dutch OJKC\"). This illustration, at the same time,\napplies preliminary perspectives on how the concept of learn-\ning might be clarified. Next, the article provides a clarification\nof the concept learning regarding practical theological studies\non young people in faith practices. This clarification, as will be\nconcluded, is helped by distinguishing among descriptions of\nlearning, interpretations of learning, normative positions\nregarding learning, and strategic considerations toward (the\npromotion of) learning. This argument is established based on\na discussion of educational literature on learning, including\nReligious Education literature on learning.\nThe context of learning studied in the current article is\nfaith practices. Practical theologians seek to understand reli-\ngion and faith as they are involved in church life and every-\nday life; we could say it is about the hermeneutics of lived\nreligion (Ganzevoort, 2009). Learning as part of the lived\nreligion of people is rightfully an object of practical theologi-\ncal studies. Because of the importance, we need clarity in our\nfocus on how learning is defined in child and youth studies.\nRecently, Schweitzer (2014), in his article \"Religion in\nChildhood and Adolescence: How Should It Be Studied? A\nCritical Review of Problems and Challenges in Methodology\nand Research,\" proposed criteria for empirical studies in reli-\ngion among children and adolescents. These criteria empha-\nsizetheimportanceofclarityabouttheuseofinterdisciplinary\nframeworks and religious and nonreligious interpretive per-\nspectives in these studies. This article aims at gaining such\nclarity, in particular on learning in practical theological\nreflections on youth and religion.\nDifferent aspects of learning are stressed in empirical\nstudies on learning (processes) regarding faith and/or reli-\nBurton, Paroschi, Habenicht, and Hollingsead (2006); and\nways of believing and learning based on an interview study\namong 21 students, of whom the youngest was 21 years and\nthe oldest 88 years, against the background of their theologi-\ncal educational contexts ranging from first-year theological\nstudies to postdoctoral studies. The typology is grounded in\na distinction between Christian faith content and day-to-day\nexperiences. This results in four types of learner-believers.\nThe first type is the discrete learners group, who largely hold\ntheir faith and their experience as two separate dimensions of\ntheir lives. The second type is the related learners group,\nwho integrate faith and experience. The third type is the\nassimilative learners group, who assimilate their faith in\ntheir experience. The fourth type is the interpretive learners\ngroup, who tend to interpret experience according to faith\nprinciples premises.\nBurton et al. (2006) report on a study of videotaped inter-\nviews with 12 five- to six-year-old children who attended\ntwo different Sabbath school classes at a U.S. Midwestern\nSeventh-Day Adventist church. The study concerned the\nimpact of the curriculum design (a traditional vs. a revised\ncurriculum) on children's learning. Learning was measured\nin terms of factual biblical learning and the ability to express\nmessages from Bible stories.\nNiemel\u00e4 (2006) reports on a questionnaire study among\nmore than 1,000 young people before and after they partici-\npated in confirmation classes in Finland. The main question\nposed is about the quality and effectiveness of the classes and\nthe outcome measures for meeting social expectations (such\nas attractive leisure time activities), meeting religious expec-\ntations (such as strengthening faith), meeting expectations\nregarding growing up (such as becoming independent), atti-\ntude toward Christianity, and belief in God.\nEach study stresses different aspects of learning: the rela-\ntionship between learning, faith, and experience (Le Cornu,\n2005); the outcomes of learning--among which are factual\nbiblical knowledge and the expression of biblical messages\n(Burton et al., 2006); and the relationship between or distinc-\ntion between \"general development,\" religious development,\nThis comparison shows different aspects or angles of use\nof learning. This raises the question if these aspects and\nangles of use of learning, in the context of the religious\ndomain, can be summarized or classified. This article strives,\nin the words of Driscoll (2000), as quoted at the very begin-\nning of this article, for an overview of various theories, per-\nspectives, assumptions, and beliefs about learning. This\noverview can advance the practical theological reflections\nand empirical research on youth and religion in which learn-\ning processes are debated.\nI first briefly describe current research projects carried out\nat the OJKC (section \"Illustration: Current Research in the\nDutch OJKC\"). Next, the way in which the concept of learn-\ning functions in projects such as those conducted by our\nresearch center is explained further focusing on definition\nand interpretation of learning, and on normative and strategic\nperspectives (section \"Analysis: Definition, Interpretation,\nand Normative and Strategic Perspectives on Learning\").2\nThis discussion is broadened by drawing into the debate\nadditional educational literature on learning, including\nReligious Education literature on learning. The article ends\nwith a conclusion and a discussion of the results (section\n\"Conclusion and Discussion\").\nIllustration: Current Research in the\nDutch OJKC\nTo illustrate various angles of the use of learning, I now\nbriefly describe current research projects carried out at the\nOJKC. This illustration is based on published articles as well\nas unpublished manuscripts produced by eight senior and\njunior researchers at the OJKC. This description aims at pro-\nviding preliminary perspectives on how learning might be\nclarified.3\nDefinitions and Interpretations of Learning\nWhen it comes to the concept of learning in the OJKC proj-\nects, faith learning in particular is often at stake. Only two\ntimes in the publications and manuscripts of the OJKC stud-\nies, however, is a definition of faith learning presented. An\nOJKC researcher, Meerveld (forthcoming), empirically stud-\nies how learning is strived for and the actual learning results\nof youth catechesis within different types of catechetical\npractices. In his study, he uses a broad definition of faith\nlearning. Meerveld defines faith learning as a form of learn-\ning in which what is strived for or in which the result of the\nlearning process is in the field of faith content, behavior\n(praxis), attitudes, experiences, or perceptions. Sonnenberg\nand Barnard (2012) present a definition of faith learning:\nThey see, following Roebben (2007), the learning of faith as\na \"discovery of meaning.\" Next, we observe several interpre-\ntative frameworks with which (faith) learning can be under-\nstood: learning as a socialization process, as an\nidentity-development process, as a physical process, and as a\nquality of youth worship.\nDe Kock, Roeland, and Vos (2011) position learning prac-\ntices in the framework of religious socialization and distin-\nguish three types of religious socialization. First, the theory\nof traditional socialization conceptualizes religious social-\nization as the transition of religious beliefs and values: pass-\ning on of the Christian faith to the next generation. Second,\naccording to the theory of modern socialization, adults raise\nchildren by supporting the youths'personal identity develop-\nment. In this socialization approach, learning practices are all\nabout coaching. The third theory of socialization, called\ntribal socialization, points to the experiential practice of\nfaith, which is felt and sensed rather than understood intel-\nlectually. In this approach, learning practices are directed\ntoward participation: learning by doing and experiencing.\nOJKC researcher Van Wijnen (Van Wijnen, forthcoming &\nVan Wijnen, submitted) empirically investigated small\ngroups of adolescents in youth ministry and based on that\nstudy states that faith needs tribalization, as a process beyond\nindividualization: \"There is a strong cohesion between the\n(communal) content of faith and the way faith tribes do expe-\nrience faith\" (Van Wijnen, submitted). Van Wijnen and\nBarnard (2014) conclude that faith happens, is practiced, and\nis lived out in the midst of the lives of the adolescents stud-\nied. The authors plead for a turning away from faith social-\nization based on an isolated cognitive basis and a faith\nlanguage as a logical framework to a more narrative approach\nin which adolescents' life stories are connected to narratives\nof the shared faith tradition of the local congregation.\nLearning can also be interpreted as an identity-development\nprocess. Following De Kock (2014b), one of the goal catego-\nries for religious learning processes is goals in terms of iden-\ntity development. In our research project on the religious\nidentity development of highly religious Christian and\nMuslim adolescents, we carried out an in-depth interview\nstudy among 10 young Christian adults and 10 young Muslim\nadults. The framework for the project was reported in\nReligious Education by Visser-Vogel, Westerink, De Kock,\nBarnard, and Bakker (2012). The research contributes to the\ndevelopment theories formulated by Erikson (1968), Marcia\nVentura (2008). Identity in general, and religious identity in\nparticular, is a process in which individuals explore and com-\nmit to a set of religious beliefs and practices that are con-\nstructed in relation to the context (including the societal\ncontext), situation, and reaction of others (Visser-Vogel, De\nKock, Barnard, & Bakker, submitted-a, submitted-b). Van\nWijnen and Barnard (submitted) in a study of small groups of\nadolescents stress the importance of the social context and\nthe collective identity of different relationships for identity\ndevelopment. Themes such as relationships, sexuality, going\nout, and dress codes function as identity markers for ortho-\ndox Christian youngsters. For Muslim orthopraxy young-\nsters, acquiring knowledge (general knowledge, knowledge\nabout Islam, and knowledge about underlying values), obey-\ning Allah, and participating in and being involved with their\ncommunity appear to be important themes in their religious\nidentity construction (Visser-Vogel et al., submitted-b).\nVisser-Vogel, De Kock, Barnard, and Bakker (submitted-c;\n2015) discuss the complexity and multifaceted character of\nthe exploration processes of Muslim youngsters and discuss\nvarious sources for the religious identity development of\northoprax Muslim adolescents.\nDe Kock and Sonnenberg (2012) reflect on learning in\nterms of a physical process when they address the question\nof how embodiment can conceptually be related to religious\nlearning processes in youth ministry. The background for\nthis question is the observation that youth worship events can\nerase religious learning (as suggested by, among others,\nAstley, 1984), resulting in the increasing attention paid to a\nbodily and physical approach in youth ministry.\n\"Religious knowledge is embodied knowledge because it is\nconstructed by personal and social acts, experiences,\nperformances and gatherings in the religious community. At the\nvery heart of religious learning is learning by doing and social\ninteraction, observing and experiencing the religious life of\nothers and of oneself. This is in congruence with growing\nattention in religious pedagogy to learning goals in terms of\nemotions and experiences in addition to merely cognitive goals.\nAs an implication, religious education should not only\nfocus on mediation of the Word through speaking and read-\ning but also through doing, feeling, and partaking of the\nsacraments.\nOne other interpretive framework for learning observed in\nthe OJKC projects is learning as a quality of faith practices,\n4 SAGE Open\nparticularly in worship practices. Barnard and Wepener\n(2012) see worship as a spiritual implicit learning environ-\nment in which \"more explicit cognitive knowledge\" can be\ncommunicated. \"Worship has a formative power in shaping\nbelievers, more specifically Christian believers, because it\nevokes and expresses basic attitudes that enable faith.\nWorship is the learning environment in which we become\nChristians through the power of ritual\" (Barnard & Wepener,\n2012, p. 7). These insights are further elaborated in OJKC\nresearcher Ronelle Sonnenberg's PhD project on the partici-\npation of adolescents in local youth worship services and\nnational youth worship events in Protestant contexts\n(Sonnenberg, 2015). A key finding was that \"learning faith\"\nis one of the qualities of adolescents' participation in youth\nworship. Based on empirical findings (collected by participa-\ntive observation and interviews), Sonnenberg and Barnard\n(2012) distinguish learning impulses from learning products.\nImportant impulses in youth worship events are discussions,\nsermons, speeches, and song texts. Learning products\nappeared to be information and support, knowledge about\nand insight into God, religious and social-ethical applica-\ntions, relevance of tradition, and rules and freedom.\nFurthermore, the educational function of worship appeared\nto be apparent through its dialogical dimensions: One voice\nis not authoritative; the dialogue between voices matters.\nNormative Considerations in Relationship to\nLearning\nThe OJKC research projects show various normative consid-\nerations regarding learning, all of which have implications for\nimproving learning processes in faith practices. Starting from\nthe vision of the church as a learning community, De Kock,\nElhorst, and Barnard (2015) point at four characteristics of\nfaith learning in the church as a learning community, which\ngenerational learning, (b) faith learning as learning in relation\n(religious experience is there in encounters with Jesus Christ\nand with each other in His spirit), (c) faith learning as learning\nin (everyday) life, and (d) faith learning as emancipatory\nlearning (learning is directed toward durable change).\nIn another article, De Kock (2015) raises the question how\nreligious learning processes found in the missionary context\nof youth work and the guidance of these learning processes\ncan be understood religiously pedagogically. To find answers\nto this question, the article presents the results of fieldwork\ninto a case of Christian youth work outside the church and the\nreligious pedagogical reflection in this fieldwork. In field-\nwork, De Kock (2015) has detected five main themes regard-\ning religious learning at the street level: (a) vision of God,\nman, and the street; (b) the message; (c) the means; (d) the\ndidactical model; and (e) the relationship with the church.\nThe main conclusion of this particular study is that religious\nlearning processes are situated in the encounter. This can be\nunderstood in various ways: as an encounter between young-\nster and youth worker, as an encounter by living and acting\ntogether, and as an encounter involved in discussing and\nthinking together about personal, societal, and religious\nquestions. The concept of encounter or meeting is inspired\nby the concept of narthical religious learning introduced by\nvarious tendencies, the function of church communities serv-\ning as places for learning increasingly is displaced by con-\ntexts outside the physical boundaries of the church and even\nexisting outside the institutional boundaries of the church,\nthat is, at the \"street level.\"\nSetting goals for learning practices is another normative\nconsideration observed in OJKC research. De Kock (2014b)\ndelineates (a) learning goals in terms of cognition and affec-\ntion, (b) learning goals in terms of emotions and experiences,\n(c) learning goals in terms of the formation of one's own\nopinion and social interaction, and (d) learning goals in terms\nof identity development. An interview study by De Kock\n(2014a), however, reveals that many formulations of goals\nthat catechists devise for themselves do not fit in these prede-\nsigned theoretical categories: for example, \"`learning to\nknow Jesus,' `to talk about something,' `to find truth' and\n`being served pastorally'\" (p. 66). The author discusses the\ntheological and biblical normativity in a reflection on reli-\ngious learning. Differing orientations toward faith learning\ngoals hark back to differences in the personal theologies held\nby catechists. \"What specific biblical-theological concepts\ncan probably be considered foundational to a catechist's\narrangement of catechetical learning environments?\" (De\nreflection observed in the OJKC material: the implications of\nhow learning is conceptualized for improving learning pro-\ncesses in faith practices.\nIn De Kock's (2012) work, three models of religious or\ncatechetical education are elaborated: a behavioral model, a\ndevelopmental model, and an apprenticeship model. De\nKock and Sonnenberg (2012) indicate that within the last\nfew decades, a change can be observed--from using behav-\nioral models of religious education to adopting developmen-\ntal and apprenticeship models. De Kock (2012) elaborates\nthat in religious learning environments set up according to a\nbehavioral model, the teacher directs the content of the les-\nsons. This requires the learners to acquire the content and the\nteachers to conduct assignments and to check whether the\ncontent is mastered. Whereas, in religious learning environ-\nments that follow a developmental model, learners learn\nfrom observing the teacher's performance: He or she ques-\ntions, contradicts, and challenges the learners'personal theo-\nries. The content of what should be learned depends on what\nthe learners want to learn and the ideal of independent criti-\ncal thinking. In religious learning environments set up\naccording to an apprenticeship model, the person of the\nteacher--who he or she is and does--directs the learning\nprocess. Religious content and the learners' specific interests\nare embedded in the personal relationship between teacher\nand learner and embedded in the tradition of a particular reli-\ngious practice.\nIn \"a typology of catechetical learning environments,\" De\nKock (2014b) elaborates further on the three models of reli-\ngious learning environments. Based on a literature review of\nstudies about catechetical learning environments and learn-\ning processes, De Kock develops a typology of catechetical\nlearning environments in which the author distinguishes\nbetween the roles of catechist and catechumens and high-\nlights the learning goals of religious learning processes. The\nrole division follows the distinction among behavioral,\ndevelopmental, and apprenticeship models of learning envi-\nronments presented earlier by De Kock (2012): In a behav-\nioral model, the role of the catechist is instructing the\ncatechumen; in a developmental model, the role of the cate-\nchist is questioning, contradicting, and challenging the cate-\nchumen's personal theories; and in an apprenticeship model,\nthe catechist and the catechumen participate in a shared\nworld, the faith community.\nAnalysis: Definition, Interpretation, and\nNormative and Strategic Perspectives\non Learning\nThe different ways in which the concept of learning appears\nto be discussed, as shown in the previous illustration of the\nOJKC research projects, is now elaborated on in terms of\ndefinitions, interpretations, and normative and strategic per-\nspectives. This discussion is broadened by including addi-\ntional educational literature on learning and Religious\nEducation literature on learning.\nDefinitions of Learning and Descriptions of\nLearning\nThe illustration of the OJKC research reveals a few straight-\nforward definitions of learning in general, of faith learning in\nparticular, and of religious learning. Meerveld (forthcoming)\ndefines faith learning as a form of learning that leads in the\nfield of faith content to results in terms of behavior (praxis),\nattitudes, experiences, and perceptions. Sonnenberg and\nBarnard (2012) compress the field of faith learning into a\ndiscovery of meaning.\n\"Learning is discovering meanings that are presented in liturgy,\nthe Bible, tradition, culture and by peers and adults and so we\nname this process of acquiring theological knowledge a\n\"discovery of meaning\" in its own right . . . we do not consider\nthe discovery of meaning as the final learning product, for the\nfinal discovery is the existential relationship between God and\nthe individual . . . This meaning can be considered as theological\nknowledge because it can be located in the relation between God\nand the worshipper.\" (Sonnenberg & Barnard, 2012, p. 3)\nThese two definitions of faith learning treat it as a general\nprocess of learning in a particular domain, namely, the\ndomain of religion or faith. In this respect, the definitions\nlean on a general definition of learning, as for instance pro-\nvided by Driscoll (2000): \"Learning is a persisting change in\nperformance or performance potential that results from expe-\nrience and interaction with the world\" (p. 3). Or in the words\n\"We claim that someone learns or has learned something when\nwe detect a relatively subtle change in his or her behaviour or\ncan determine changes in behavioural dispositions when these\nare results of learning activities and have a certain degree of\nagility . . .. Learning as such we generally cannot observe. We\nconclude on the basis of changes in behaviour that people have\nlearned or we hear from people that they regard themselves as\nhaving learned\" [translated from Dutch]. (p. 3)\nAnd again, in the words of Van der Veen and Van der Wal\n\"Learning is realizing mental processes by way of selecting,\nabsorbing, processing, integrating, establishing, utilizing of and\nattributingmeaningtovariousformsofinformation(experiences,\nhappenings and phenomenon in reality), which lead to\nsustainable changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes, motives and/\nor the ability to learn\" [translated from Dutch]. (p. 30)\nBoekaerts and Simons do not regard learning itself as\nobservable because we can speak of realized learning based\nonly on its observed outcomes. This contrasts with consider-\nable reflections in the literature that try to grasp the essence\nof what transpires in learning. This also holds for the OJKC\nresearch projects. If, for example, one considers learning\nsynonymous with identity development, then what transpires\nas religious learning might be observable as a process of reli-\ngious exploration and making commitments to a set of reli-\ngious beliefs and practices (see Visser-Vogel et al.,\nsubmitted-a, submitted-b). It raises the question whether\nconcepts can be used to depict what transpires during learn-\ning itself, in particular in the realm of faith learning. At least\nfour types of descriptions of learning can be distinguished,\nregarding the essence of learning, termed approaches to\nlearning.\nThe first type of learning description concentrates on the\nrelational basis: (Faith) learning is a relational process\nbecause the religious experience is derived from the encoun-\nter with God or Jesus Christ and from an encounter with\nother people (in His spirit), both inter- and intragenerational.\nThe second type concentrates on the process of acquiring\nprinciples of faith and mainly cognitive religious/faith con-\ntent (as supplied by leaders or the tradition). The third type\nconcentrates on the process of the individual believer\nengaged in subjectively constructing the (religious) self and\ndoing this based on independent critical thinking. The fourth\n6 SAGE Open\ntype concentrates on the process of faith in action: doing and\nexperiencing social interaction in faith practices (whether\nformal practices or practices in everyday life).\nThese four approaches complement the three approaches\nto (faith) learning distinguished by Alii (2009):\n- Learning by doing, based on the principle of trial-and-error\n- Learning with and by heart, a form of cognitive learning\n-\nLearning as an intersubjective activity: reflecting together on\nRegarding the first approach to faith learning, this corre-\nsponds with what Nipkow (1982) claims in his \"Grundfragen\nder Religionsp\u00e4dagogik\" where he points at the intergenera-\ntional heart of the process of learning: In his view, Christian\nformation means \"living together and faith learning in\nbetween the generations [translated from the original German\ntext]\" (Nipkow, 1982, p. 33). Regarding the second aspect of\nfaith learning (acquiring principles and content), we refer-\nence the work of Sfard (1998), who identifies two metaphors\nfor learning: the acquisition metaphor and the participation\nmetaphor. I will explain in terms of OJKC research how the\nsecond type of learning description (acquiring principles and\ncontent) fits the acquisition metaphor and the fourth (faith in\naction) fits the participation metaphor.\nThe acquisition metaphor characterizes learning as\n\"acquisition of something\" directed toward the goal of indi-\nvidual enrichment. In this metaphor, the \"student\" is a recipi-\nent and (re-)constructer, while the \"teacher\" is a provider,\nfacilitator, or mediator. Knowing in the acquisition metaphor\nis conceptualized as \"having\" or \"possessing,\" and thus,\nknowledge is an individual or public property, as a posses-\nsion or commodity.\nWhen it comes to the participation metaphor for learning,\nSfard demarcates learning as \"becoming a participant\" and\ndirected toward the goal of community building. The \"stu-\ndent\" is an apprentice or peripheral participant, while the\n\"teacher\" preserves practice and discourse or acts as an\nexpert participant. Knowing in the participation metaphor is\nconceptualized as \"belonging,\" \"participating,\" or \"commu-\nnicating,\" and thus, knowledge is an aspect of practice, a dis-\ncourse, or activity.\nAdding to the model of acquisition and the participation\nmetaphors, Paavola and Hakkarainen (2005) advance a third\nmetaphor for learning: the knowledge-creation metaphor,\nwhich they present as an emergent epistemological approach to\nlearning. Important background for introducing a knowledge-\ncreation metaphor is the current rise of knowledge societies.\nThe authors hark back to, among others, Sfard (1998), when\nthey characterize the acquisition metaphor as \"monological\"\nwithin the mind approach to learning and the participation met-\naphor as a \"dialogical\" interaction approach (Paavola &\nmetaphor \"appears to be sufficient when addressing pro-\ncesses of deliberately creating and advancing knowledge\"\n(p. 538). The knowledge-creation metaphor covers a \"tria-\nlogical\" approach: \"developing collaborative shared objects\nThe first type of learning description (with a focus on the\nrelational basis of learning) and the third type (with a focus\non the individual construction basis of learning) conceptu-\nally combine into what is suggested by the knowledge-cre-\nation metaphor of learning. The knowledge-creation\nmetaphor sees learning as individuals and groups creating\nsocial structures and collaborative processes that support the\ngrowth of knowledge and innovation, generating new ideas,\nconceptual knowledge, new practices, and new social struc-\ntures. In the religious domain, this trialogical learning\napproach results in the creation of new faith practices, in\nterms of structures and theologies. Thus, we see the four\ntypes of descriptions cover the various concentrations in\nexisting metaphors for learning.\nInterpretation of the Process of Learning\nThis discussion tells us that learning has multiple aspects and\nis embedded in practices. The OJKC research shows various\nattempts to interpret what happens when faith learning pro-\ncesses occur. First, we acknowledge four general interpreta-\ntions of learning, which are not strictly theological, derived\nfrom various disciplines such as Sociology (of religion),\nPsychology (of learning), Developmental Psychology,\nAnthropology, and Educational Sciences. After discussing\nthese nontheological interpretations, I will consider theologi-\ncal interpretations in particular.\nWe can distinguish four general interpretations of the\nlearning process. First, learning is understood as a cognitive\nprocess of exploring ideas, convictions, and beliefs and mak-\ning commitments to one or the other. Second, learning is\nunderstood as a process of action where practices, behavior,\nand actions are explored and commitments to one or the\nother are made. The latter interpretation of learning is also\nrelated to the interpretation of learning rooted in flesh and\nblood bodies in which not only the cognitive aspect but also\nthe physical aspect of learning processes is addressed. Third,\nlearning is understood as a social process: Learning is rela-\ntional and intergenerational, and thus, it is a product of (a\nfluid combination of) socialization strategies and individual\nchoices. Fourth, learning is understood as a communal qual-\nity: Learning is embedded in the daily life contexts of com-\nmunities, and thus, it is not an individual but a collective\nprocess.\nThese four broad interpretations partly mirror the attempts\nmade in the educational literature to interpret what happens\nwhen learning processes occur. In the educational sciences,\nthese interpretation attempts are classified in six families of\neducational theories (based on the elaborations by\n& Sonnenberg, 2012): (a) behaviorist theories, (b) cognitiv-\nist theories, (c) developmental theories, (d) motivational\ntheories, (e) constructivist theories, and (f) biological theo-\nries. It is partly mirrored because our four broad interpreta-\ntions of learning form another kind of categorization\nframework compared with the summary of the six families of\neducational theories.\nThus, what theological interpretations can be observed in\nparticular? First, as illustrated, for example, by the OJKC\nresearch, several learning impulses, elements that evoke\nlearning, are put forward. These impulses are the external\nchecking of acquired faith content, attention to learners' per-\nsonal interests, learner participation in religious practices\n(e.g., worship), and the encounter between (personal) long-\nings and (representatives of) religious perspectives, discus-\nsions, sermons, speeches, and song texts.\nSecond, it can be determined that various elements are\nadvanced, which are expected to have impact on and steer\n(faith) learning processes. A type of element concerns setting\nparticular goals: for example, cognitive goals; affective\ngoals, goals such as learning to know Jesus or finding truth,\nrealizing durable change, or being initiated into a faith com-\nmunity, having an existential relationship with God, and so\nforth. Another type of element is that religious authority can\nbe found (regarding what should be learned and how and\nwhat is true and worthwhile), leading to a question such as,\n\"Is the authority located externally in the tradition, or in the\nreligious leader, or in the learner himself or herself, or is it\nembedded in the debate within the religious community?\"\nAn additional element concerns how learning processes can\nbe understood as a result of theological and denominational\npositions, including beliefs about the role and function of the\nBible, the church itself (and in relationship to society), the\ntradition, and the actuality.\nNormativity Regarding Learning\nLet us now turn to normative considerations regarding learn-\ning. What (theological) normativity can be observed in the\ndescription of the OJKC projects? First, learning (and teach-\ning) is presented as following one of the basic functions of\nthe church or congregational life. The vision of the church\nshould be one in which it sees itself as a learning community.\nThus, learning in itself is a core quality of the Christian\n(faith) community. Second, light is shed on biblical-theolog-\nical concepts that might be foundational to (faith) learning\nand the guidance of (faith) learning. Discipleship is an exam-\nple. Another example is the encounter of a Christian with\nJesus Christ as foundational for learning. This points toward\nthe phenomenon of relational learning, understood as learn-\ning situated in the encounter with God and each other.\nFurthermore, different concentrations can be laid on learn-\ning, which should result from mediation of the Word by\nspeaking and reading or result from the sacraments by doing\nand feeling.\nNormative orientations, such as the encounter with Christ\nand following Christ as disciples, are often observed in the\npractical theological literature on learning. For example,\nDingemans (1991) stresses the centrality of the person of\nChrist: Faith learning is not about a set of dogmas but about\na Person. Theologically, Dingemans translates faith learning\ninto \"following Christ\": \"Our choice for the term `following'\nis because it represents all elements of the cognitive, affec-\ntive and attitudinal learning [translated from Dutch]\"\nholistic approach of learning (cognitive, affective, and attitu-\ndinal) to the theological concept of \"following Christ,\" De\nKock and Verboom (2011) legitimate a similar holistic\napproach by referring to the biblical vision of humankind in\nwhich the heart (Hebrew: leb) is central when it comes to\nlearning: \"(A) notion of learning from the heart (Hebrew:\nleb) forming the core of our humanity moves towards head,\naffection and the attitudinal [translated from Dutch]\" (De\nDe Kock and Sonnenberg (2012) argue that the six fami-\nlies of educational learning theories (see \"Interpretation of\nthe Process of Learning\" above) function as not only inter-\npretation frameworks but also normative frameworks: Each\nfamily of theories mirrors certain ideals when it comes to\nlearning processes, including faith practices:\n\"It should be emphasized that distinguishing one family of\neducational learning theories does not in all aspects exclude\nother families of theories. Although often in practice one or two\nfamilies are prominent, we note that characteristics from\ndifferent families can be simultaneously observed. However, the\ndistinction between the six families can help us to analyse what\nkind of ideals are at stake in different religious pedagogical\napproaches and in different religious learning practices.\" (De\nIdeals are not necessarily fixed. Sfard (1998), for example,\npresents a \"patchwork\" regarding education and learning in\ngeneral. She concludes that one should not have too great a\ndevotion to one particular metaphor for learning. Instead,\n\"It seems that the sooner we accept the thought that our work is\nbound to produce a patchwork of metaphors rather than a\nunified, homogeneous theory of learning, the better for us and\nfor those whose lives are likely to be affected by our work.\"\nNormative positions have consequences for strategic con-\nsiderations followed in practices of (faith) learning. The next\nsection will discuss some of these strategic issues. One\nshould, however, keep in mind that often normative positions\nand strategic choices (in terms of developing learning envi-\nronments for [faith] learning) cannot be clearly separated\nfrom each other. This can be observed, for example, in the\nwork of Osmer (2005), who elaborates on the formation and\neducation task of congregations by describing three core\n8 SAGE Open\ntasks in Paul's teaching ministry as he observes in his\nletters:\n\"(1) catechesis: i.e. handing over Israel's Scripture and early\nChristian tradition; (2) exhortation: i.e. moral formation and\neducation; and (3) discernment: i.e. teaching congregations how\nto understand the circumstances of their everyday life and world\nin terms of God's promised future for creation.\" (pp. 26-27)\nThese three core tasks can be read as normative positions\ntaken from Paul, but at the same time, they can be read as\nstrategic landmarks. Faith communities should develop\nlearning environments in which Scripture and tradition are\nhanded over, in which moral formation and education take\nplace, and in which current life is interpreted in terms of\nGod's promises.\nAnother example of the interconnectedness of normative\npositions and strategic considerations is in the work of White\n(1988), who stresses the intergenerational character of reli-\ngious learning processes. White explains that education has\nto do with Learning/Growing/Living:\n\"Each word needs the other because \"learning\" alone too often\nsuggests strictly the cognitive acquisition of information . . .\n\"Growing\" conveys a fuller development of persons, especially\nin terms of one's inner or subjective side, having to do with the\naffections but also to do with the psycho-motor or physical\naspects of the self. Together \"learning\" and \"growing\" have to\ndo with life \"living\" which . . . relates to faith lifestyle\ndevelopment.\" (p. 26)\nIntergenerational religious education thus contains cogni-\ntive, affective, and lifestyle developments that according to\nWhite (1988) are supported by four \"patterns of relationship:\n(1) In-Common-Experiences, (2) Parallel-Learning, (3)\nContributive-Occasions, and (4) Interactive-Sharing\"\nStrategic Considerations Regarding Learning\nIn the OJKC research described in the section \"Illustration:\nCurrent Research in the Dutch OJKC,\" various strategic con-\nsiderations regarding (the promotion of) faith learning can be\nobserved. Educational or didactical models for stimulating\nlearning processes are presented, involving a focus on trans-\nmission, clarification, or communication. Narrative, sacra-\nmental, and proclamation approaches are examined. The\nmost pronounced strategic contribution is the recently pre-\nsented typology of 12 catechetical learning environments\n(De Kock, 2014b). This typology combines strategic choices\nregarding four types of learning goals to be strived for and\nthree models of religious or catechetical education (De Kock,\n2012): a behavioral model, a developmental model, and an\napprenticeship model. The latter distinction harks back to\nfollowing particular instructional paradigms. We can distin-\nguish between three instructional paradigms (based on a\nclassification scheme of Farnham-Diggory, 1994), further\nexpanded by De Kock, Sleegers, and Voeten (2004) and De\n\"(a) a behavioural paradigm reflecting a social system in which\nthe expert has a high status and the novice has a low status but is\nexpected to acquire more of the expert's expertise; (b) a\ndevelopmental paradigm reflecting a social system in which the\nnovice learns by developing his or her own personal theories\nwith the support of the expert, who may question, contradict,\nand challenge those theories; and (c) an apprenticeship paradigm\nreflecting a social system in which the learner must clearly\nparticipate in the expert's world to learn (through acculturation).\"\nThese instructional paradigms shed light on an important\nstrategic consideration: What role does the teacher (whether\na pastor, a youth worker, a parent, or a peer) have in the\nlearning process? Is he or she directing the content of lessons\nand checking acquisitions? Is he or she questioning and chal-\nlenging learners' personal theories? Or is he or she modeling\na Christian life?\nConclusion and Discussion\nThis article aimed at gaining clarity regarding the concept of\nlearning in practical theological reflections on youth and reli-\ngion. How might the variety of aspects and angles of use of\nlearning, in the context of the religious domain, be summa-\nrized or classified? The conclusion might follow the quote by\nSchweitzer (2006): \"What exactly is a `religious learning pro-\ncess'. . . is, conversely, not easy to define [translated from the\noriginal German text]\" (p. 115). Although it is not easy, the\ndescriptions and reflections in this article provide clarifica-\ntions, which are helpful for future practical theological stud-\nies on learning in faith practices. To clarify, it appears helpful\nto distinguish between descriptions of learning, interpreta-\ntions of learning, normative positions regarding learning, and\nstrategic considerations toward (the promotion of) learning.\nThis brings us to the first conclusion: The concept of\nlearning as present in practical theological reflections on\nyouth and religion cannot be clarified by giving a univocal,\nuniversal or undivided, sharp definition. The analysis in the\ncurrent article shows the many ways in which the concept of\nlearning might function in practical theological accounts. In\nthe first place, the concept functions on different levels: on\nthe level of definition/description or on the level of norma-\ntive approaches, for example. In the second place, within\neach level, various approaches can be observed. For exam-\nple, there are multiple interpretations of what is going on if\nlearning occurs, and there is not a single Bible-based norma-\ntive approach toward the enhancement of faith learning, for\nexample; there are multiple approaches. Thus, it can be con-\ncluded that clarification of the concept of learning in practi-\ncal theological reflections on youth and religion is helped by\nshowing learning is multilayered. Therefore, learning can be\nclarified from the angle of different levels. This is what the\nanalysis in the current article shows.\nA second conclusion, then, is that four types of descrip-\ntions or approaches to learning can be distinguished. The\nfirst type concentrates on the relational basis: Faith learning\nis a relational process, a process embedded in the encounter\nwith God and other people, both inter- and intragenerational.\nThe second type concentrates on the process of acquiring\nprinciples of faith and mainly cognitive religious/faith con-\ntent as supplied by leaders or the tradition. The third type\nconcentrates on the process of the individual believer subjec-\ntively constructing the (religious) self, based on independent\ncritical thinking. The fourth type concentrates on the process\nof \"faith in action,\" involving doing, experiencing, and inter-\nacting socially in faith practices, including the lives of one-\nself and others.\nThe third conclusion is that four general interpretations of\nthe process of learning can be distinguished. First, learning is\nunderstood as a cognitive process of exploring ideas, convic-\ntions, and beliefs and making commitments to one or the\nother. Second, learning is understood as a process of action\nin which practices, behavior, and actions are explored and\ncommitments to one or the other are made. Third, learning is\nunderstood as a social process: Learning is relational and\nintergenerational, and thus a product of (a fluid combination\nof) socialization strategies and individual choices. Fourth,\nlearning is understood as a communal quality: Learning is\nembedded in the daily life contexts of communities, and thus\nnot an individual but a collective process.\nThe fourth conclusion is that at least three theological\ninterpretations in particular can be distinguished: Learning\nprocesses are shaped by (a) goal setting, (b) the place of reli-\ngious authority, and (c) theological and denominational\npositions.\nThe fifth conclusion is that in addition to normative ideals\nstemming from different educational learning theories, differ-\nent biblical-theological concepts appear to be (theologically)\nfoundational to learning and the guidance of learning. I\nshowed examples of a discipleship approach and the theology\nof Paul. Two approaches can be observed: One might opt for\none core biblical-theological approach to lead; one might also\nchoose to follow a patchwork approach in which ideals and\ntheological normative approaches are context dependent.\nIn addition, the sixth conclusion is that different strategic\nconsiderations are to be dealt with. Special attention, then,\nshould be given to the role of the teacher, whether he or she\nis the pastor, parent, youth leader, or peer. These teachers as\npractical theologians are not simply applying normative\nstandpoints or putting definitions of learning into practice.\nThey are, instead, involved in a creative process with \"rules\nof art\" (Osmer, 2005, p. xvi) that arise contextually in a con-\nfrontation between observations, interpretations, and norma-\ntive positions. And this brings us back to the first conclusion\nthat showed learning was a multilayered concept, to be clari-\nfied and dealt with from the angle of different levels. This is\na creative process for academics and practitioners in the field\nof faith practices of young people.\nGaining clarity on descriptions, interpretations, normative\npositions, and strategic considerations regarding learning\ncan advance practical theological reflections and empirical\nresearch on youth and religion in which learning processes\nare debated. The same is true for practitioners in the field of\nreligious education that involves all kinds of contexts: The\ndifferent definitions, approaches, and ideals regarding learn-\ning as presented in the article can be used to reflect on our\nown professional practices and can be of help when we\ndevelop learning environments for (faith) learning. Dealing\nwith descriptions, interpretations, normative positions, and\nstrategic considerations is in line with the four main tasks for\nthe practical theologian, whether he or she is an academic\ninvolved in research or a practitioner in a particular profes-\ndescriptive-empirical task, (b), the interpretative task, (c) the\nnormative task, and (d) the pragmatic task. Of special impor-\ntance for the practical theologian is of course to bring into\ndiscussion the theological (biblical, systematic, or springing\nfrom lived religion) considerations with the educational/\npedagogical, psychological, and sociological reflections on\nlearning, in the interpretative task and in the normative task.\nThe latter brings us to the final (seventh) conclusion that\ncan be based in the analysis in the current article thus far:\nClarification of the concept of learning should be seen in\nlight of an epistemological perspective, a perspective that is\npart of what Osmer (2011) calls \"meta-theoretical consider-\nations\" of the practical theologian. This is important because\na particular epistemological approach functions implicitly or\nexplicitly as a set of assumptions, grounded in either philoso-\nphy, psychology, and/or theology, that shape theories on\n(faith) learning. Criticizing a description of learning or an\neducational model for enhancing learning is sometimes a cri-\ntique on the level of assumptions: The assumptions are\nwrong, and therefore, as a result, the description of learning\nor the proposed educational model is wrong.\nEpistemological approaches can focus on the nature of\nknowledge or on how knowledge is acquired (Driscoll,\nHakkarainen (2005), we already distinguished three meta-\nphors or epistemological approaches to learning: (a) the\nacquisition metaphor, which characterizes learning as\n\"acquisition of something\" directed toward the goal of indi-\nvidual enrichment; (b) the participation metaphor, which\ncharacterizes learning as \"becoming a participant\" and\ndirected toward the goal of community building; and (c) the\nknowledge-creation metaphor, which characterizes learning\nas a process of deliberately creating and advancing knowl-\nedge directed toward developing collaborative shared objects\nand artifacts.\nDriscoll (2000), for example, distinguishes three main\nepistemological traditions, each giving distinct orientations on\nhow to understand learning: objectivism, pragmatism,\nand interpretivism. Is \"reality\" out there, and if it is, is it to be\nconsidered as external to and separate from the knower, is it\nknowable directly or indirectly, or is it a construction of indi-\nvidual knowers? Such questions are, in the words of Osmer\n(2011), questions on the \"meta-theoretical\" level, answers to\nwhich shape the way in which the descriptive, interpretative,\nnormative, and pragmatic tasks of practical theologians are\nperformed.\nAssumptions about the nature of learning and how knowl-\nedge is acquired influence the views one has about learning.\nFurthermore, the assumptions religious educators, pastors,\nyouth workers, or parents have also affect how likely they\nare motivated to take certain strategic considerations seri-\nously. Professionals or volunteers who hold objectivist\nassumptions on learning hold reality as external and objec-\ntive and believe knowledge can be acquired through experi-\nence. Those who hold a pragmatist position hold reality as\ninterpreted through signs, both internal and external, in\nwhich knowledge is negotiated from experience and reason.\nThe interpretivists among all those involved in (faith) learn-\ning see reality as an internal thing, relative to a frame of ref-\nerence where knowledge is constructed. Epistemological\napproaches that guide individuals in dealing with learning\nand the enhancement of learning are often rooted in broader\ndevelopments in cultures, societies, or church denomina-\ntional subcultures. For example, a knowledge-creation meta-\nphor or interpretivism is observed in innovative missionary\nchurch contexts where new faith practices are constructed, in\nterms of structures and theologies. The (cultural) develop-\nment here is one of secularization and the decline of partici-\npation in institutional church practices. As a counterreaction,\nreligious professionals and volunteers critique the dominant\nvoice of the acquisition of church dogmas when it comes to\nchurch education and replace this voice by stressing the indi-\nvidual construction of religious truth based on their own\ninterpretations of experiences.\nI suggest that further practical theological research on\nlearning of young people in faith practices can be helped\nwith explicit clarifications from the outset of what is meant\nby \"learning\" or what can be observed about \"learning\" in\nterms of descriptions, interpretations, and normative posi-\ntions and strategy, as well as from a broader epistemological\nperspective. In particular, I suggest more empirical research\ninto the experiences of young people in faith practices and to\ngain more understanding of the concept of learning based on\ntheir experiences, using concepts and language from the\nyoung people themselves. Reflections on learning in the dif-\nferent OJKC studies, for example, appeared to be based on a\nmix of theoretical considerations and visions of educators\n(e.g., catechists), and only partly on direct interactions with\nyoung people themselves. I ask for more empirical studies on\nlearning in faith practices in which the voice of young people\nthemselves is the foundation.\nThis plea is in line with Schweitzer (2014) who recently\npresented six criteria for gaining additional understanding of\nreligion. These criteria are also relevant for understanding\nthe learning of young people in faith practices. One crite-\nrion is that the understanding of religion must \"be open for\nthe special experiences of children and adolescents and\nshould not make the religion its tacit model (`adultocen-\nfrom Schweitzer is that the understanding of religion must\n\"combine non-religious interpretive perspectives with the\nopenness for the religious self-understandings of believers,\nparticularly of children and adolescents\" (p. 32). The plea\nis also in line with Faix's (2014) observation that \"more\nresearch needs to be undertaken in the future with regard to\nthe methodological approach of using mixed methods and\nalso in relation to adolescents' ability to speak about and\nunderstand their own faith constructs\" (p. 51). Especially\nin societies where predefined frameworks of faith, reli-\ngion, and faith institutions are losing ground, young peo-\nple's self-understanding of faith and faith learning becomes\nmore important to describe and interpret the essence of\nwhat learning is about. The special role of the practical\ntheologian is to observe and listen intensely, and to bring\nthese empirical data, which are the experiences and voices\nof young people themselves, in debate with both tradi-\ntional and new, both theological and nontheological inter-\npretative and normative frameworks, with the goal of\nstrategically serving the learning function of current faith\ncommunities.\n"
