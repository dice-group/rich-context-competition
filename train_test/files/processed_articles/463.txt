Osteoporosis was diagnosed in less than 1% of the participants at inclusion. Using Danish and NHANES III ref-\nerence data, 10.2 and 11.5% of the study population had osteoporosis, respectively. In all, 6.3% participants had at least one\nVFx. BMD was significantly lower in participants with vertebral deformities, but only 24% of these cases had osteoporosis.\nConclusions: osteoporosis and VFxs are prevalent in men aged 60\u00ad74 years. Although the majority of deformities were\npresent in individuals without osteoporosis, BMD was lower in patients with VFxs at all sites investigated.

The\nlifetime risk of fractures in men older than 50 years has\nbeen estimated to be 20% [2]. The worldwide distribution\nof fractures is uneven as the prevalence of osteoporotic\nfractures is higher in Scandinavian countries [3]. Since\nosteoporotic fractures decrease quality of life [4] and in-\ncrease mortality [5], data on the epidemiology of osteopor-\nosis are important for the planning of preventive efforts.\nPopulation-based information on the prevalence of osteo-\nporosis and vertebral fracture (VFx) in men from high-risk\npopulations is, however, limited.\nBone mineral density (BMD) and VFxs are predictive of\nfuture VFx as well as non-spine fractures independently of\nother risk factors in men [6]. The lifetime risk of a clinical VFx\nhas been estimated to be 8.6% in Swedish men [2]. Because\nonly 25\u00ad33% of VFxs are diagnosed clinically [7], this fracture\ntype is commonly a missed opportunity for treatment.\nIn a large prospective study on VFxs in men, 87% of\nthe incident VFxs occurred in participants with T-scores >\n-2.5 [6]. This questions the use of DXA to detect indivi-\nduals at high risk of prevalent and future VFxs.\nVFx assessment (VFA) is based on lateral images\nobtained from a bone densitometer, and the method allows\nfor evaluation of prevalent fractures without the radiation\ndose of conventional radiography [8]. Although fractures\nobserved by use of VFA predict future spine fractures in\nwomen independently of age and BMI [9], information on\nthe ability of VFA to detect incident fractures is limited.\nNevertheless, low radiation exposure, the possibility of\ncombining DXA and an assessment of VFx and the high\nsensitivity of VFA to detect moderate and severe fractures\nsuggest that the method is useful as an addition to assess-\nThe aims of the present study were to evaluate the\nprevalence of osteoporosis as defined by a T-score of less\nthan or equal to -2.5 at the total hip, femoral neck or\nlumbar spine in a population-based sample of elderly men,\nto determine the prevalence of VFxs using VFA and the\nimpact of applying Danish reference values as opposed to\nSubjects and methods\nSubjects\nParticipants in the study were recruited from a random\nsample of the background population issued by the Danish\nCivil Registration System. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the\nquestionnaire by mail. A second letter was issued to non-\nrespondents. Second, a subgroup of 1845 participants was\ndrawn as an age-stratified randomised sample (15 strata,\n123 individuals in each) from the group of participants\nwho completed the questionnaire. These participants were\nasked to take part in further study procedures, which was\naccepted by 946.

The study was performed in accord-\nance with the Helsinki declaration.\nM. Frost et al.\nBody composition and bone mineral density\nBody weight was measured in light clothing (SECA,\nGermany) to the nearest 0.1 kg, while height was deter-\nmined to the nearest 0.1 cm (Harpenden, Holtain, UK).\nBMI was calculated as weight divided by height squared\n(kg/m2). BMD of the total hip, femoral neck and lumbar\nspine were measured by use of dual X-ray absorptiometry\n(H4500, Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).

Diagram of inclusion of participants.\nOsteoporosis and vertebral fractures\nand caudal endplates were marked by 6 points at the anter-\nior, middle and posterior part of the vertebrae. The\nMcCloskey algorithm [9] was used for the classification of\nfractures. Although primarily validated in radiographs, the\nalgorithm has been shown to be operational in DXA as\nwell [9]. A vertebral fracture was defined by (i) a 3 SD\nreduction in the ratio of vertebral heights compared\nwith reference values, either the anterior-posterior,\nmiddle-posterior or between adjacent posterior ratios or\n(ii) a 3 SD reduction in the posterior height as predicted\non the basis of the adjacent vertebrae [11]. Kappa values\nfor intra- and inter-observer agreement were 0.9 and\nStatistical methods\nResults are presented as mean (SD) or median (25\u00ad75%\npercentiles). The study population was compared with\nthe non-respondents using Pearson's Chi-square test or\nStudent's t-test.\nOsteoporotic and non-osteoporotic as well as VFx and\nnon-VFx participants were compared by the use of\nChi-square test, Student's t-test or Mann\u00adWhitney's U test.\nThe ability of osteoporosis to detect VFxs was evaluated by\ncalculation of the area under the curve, and kappa statistics\nwas used to evaluate the level of agreement between the\nVFA interpretations.\nAll computations were performed using STATA v10\n(STATA, College Station, TX, USA), and P-values less than\n5% were considered significant.\nThis study was supported by the World-Anti Doping\nAgency, Danish Ministry of Culture and Institute of Clinical\nResearch, University of Southern Denmark.\nResults\nThe study population and those not included in the study\nwere comparable with regard to BMI and self-reported\nchronic illnesses, though smoking and pulmonary disease\nwere observed less frequently among respondents, and a\nhigher proportion of the study population reported that\nthey were living with a partner, participating in sports or\nhad a higher education (Table 1). In all, two participants\nreported a diagnosis of osteoporosis at inclusion.\nBMD was assessed in 585 participants corresponding to\n98% of the study population (not technically possible in\n15).

In all, 35 (6.3%) participants had at least one\nVFx comprising a total of 42 fractures consisting of 26\nthoracic and 16 lumbar fractures.

Twenty-four per cent of those with a VFx had\nosteoporosis, whereas 1.5% had osteoporosis and a VFx.\nThe diagnostic utility of BMD measurements for detec-\ntion of co-existing VFxs was independent of the reference\nively). The sensitivity of DXA using Danish and\nNHANESIII reference values and a T-score of -2.5 to\ndetect the presence of a concomitant VFx was the same\n(24%), whereas the specificity was 91 and 90%, respectively.\nPositive and negative predictive values for BMD using\nDanish reference values were 14 and 95% and the corre-\nsponding results for NHANESIII were 13 and 95%.\nDiscussion\nThis study provided for the first time observational data on\nthe prevalence of osteoporosis as determined by DXA on a\nrandom sample of elderly Danish men. On the basis of\nhad osteoporosis. Using NHANES III hip and Hologic\nlumbar spine reference values provided clinically similar\nestimates of osteoporosis in the study population. In con-\ntrast, there appeared to be substantial differences in the\nprevalence of osteoporosis if only one region was evaluated,\nwhich may be explained by differences in genetics and the\ndistribution of lifestyle factors.\nBased on normal Danish values for BMD, the preva-\nlence of osteoporosis in Danish men has previously been\nestimated to be 17.7% in those aged more than 50 years\n[13]. Our observations are not in accordance with these\nresults, which is probably due to the limited range of age\ncovered in our study. BMD has been shown to decrease and\nthe prevalence of VFxs as depicted on radiographs increase\nwith age in men [7, 19], therefore, the age of the participants\nis likely to have considerable impact on the prevalence of\nboth osteoporosis and VFxs. Our data do not support such\nage-related differences, but this may be due to the limited\nnumber of participants, the relative low prevalence of VFxs\nor selection bias, e.g. lower prevalence of smoking and pul-\nmonary disease among those included in the study.\nSix per cent of our participants had a VFx on the basis\nof VFA, and most of the VFxs were observed in the thor-\nacic spine, which is in accordance with previous studies\n[14]. The prevalence of fractures in our study was lower\nyears. In contrast, the result is higher compared with a\nFinnish study [16], showing a prevalence of 2.8% in men\naged 75+ years. These differences are likely explained by\nthe method used for the evaluation of fractures, differences\nin the diagnostic cut-off and in the recruitment of study\nparticipants.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nTable 3.

Previous studies reported that the ma-\njority of VFxs are due to low-energy trauma or of\nunknown origin, whereas only 18\u00ad26% of the fractures\nwere caused by high-energy trauma [6, 17]. The lower levels\nof BMD observed in study participants with a VFx indicate\nthat these fractures are associated with bone health and not\nmerely due to high-energy trauma. Even if the latter was\nthe case, high-energy trauma fractures have been associated\nwith increased risk of further fractures [6], suggesting that\nthe observed fractures confer significant risk of future\nfractures.\nThe prevalence of VFxs was 10\u00ad13% in the US MrOS,\nwhich included community-dwelling men of significantly\nhigher age than those in our study [18]. Information on in-\ncident VFxs is limited. In the US MrOS, the incidence was\nnificantly more prevalent in those experiencing a VFx (13\nversus 2%), but the majority of fractures occurred in indivi-\nduals without osteoporosis [6].\nOwing to the cross-sectional design of our study, we\nwere unable to interpret the sensitivity of osteoporosis as\ndefined by a T-score equal to or less than -2.5 to identify\nfuture VFxs. Using DXA for detection of concomitant VFx\nin the study population resulted in a sensitivity of 24%. In\nthe Rotterdam study [19], the sensitivity of DXA, i.e. osteo-\nporosis as defined on the basis of DXA, to identify\npersons who would experience an incident non-VFx was\nestimated to be 44 and 21% in women and men, respect-\nively. These results suggest that T-score alone provides an\ninadequate evaluation of fracture risk.\nVFA rather than X-ray was used to detect VFxs in the\npresent study. Compared with radiographs, VFA appears to\nbe less reliable in detecting grade 1 fractures in the upper\nthoracic spine; however, conventional X-ray evaluations are\nalso less precise in this region [20]. We used the McCloskey\nalgorithm for the evaluation of the VFA. This algorithm\nhas been shown to predict incident fractures as identified\nby radiographs in both men and women [21, 22]. This algo-\nrithm has also been applied to VFA and results in women\nshowed that the McCloskey algorithm was able to predict\nincident fractures independent of several factors including\nBMD [9]. Although fractures are less common in men,\nthere are no indications suggesting that the method is in-\nappropriate in men.\nOur results on VFA may have been influenced by pro-\nblems of detecting grade I fractures, and it is likely that\nradiographs would have allowed evaluation of a larger pro-\nportion of vertebrae. Although most fractures occur\nbetween T7 and L3 [23], our estimate of the prevalence of\nVFx's is probably conservative. The present study is also\nweakened by the infrequency of osteoporosis in the study\npopulation due to the age of the study population, and the\nresults may only be valid to Danish men aged 60\u00ad74 years.\nOur study has some strengths. The use of a population-\nbased sample of men limited the risk of selection bias.\nAcquisition of data by questionnaire in non-participants\nallowed us to demonstrate that the study population with\nthe exception of certain lifestyle and social factors was\ncomparable with the general population of age- and sex-\nmatched men. Nevertheless, we believe the result provide a\nreasonable estimate of osteoporosis in elderly, Danish men.\nCurrently, the International Society of Clinical\nDensitometry currently recommends the use of VFA in men\nwith a low T-score and one of several risk factors [24]. Our\ndata suggest that VFA should be used in all men evaluated\nwith DXA.\nIn conclusion, very few reported osteoporosis at inclu-\nsion but 10% had osteoporosis and 6% had at least one\nVFx. There was no overall substantial difference between\nresults derived from using Danish and NHANES-III refer-\nence values but there were significant differences with\nregard to the prevalence of osteoporosis in specific regions.\nOur data demonstrate that VFA adds important informa-\ntion on bone status not captured by T-scores derived from\nKey points\n\u00b7 Osteoporosis and vertebral fractures common in elderly\nmen.\n\u00b7 Osteoporosis markedly underdiagnosed in men.\n\u00b7 No overall difference in the prevalence of osteoporosis\nbetween Danish and NHANESIII reference values.\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data mentioned in the text is available to\nsubscribers in Age and Ageing online.\nConflicts of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1.
