Adolescence is a time for identity for-\nmation or individuation away from family of origin while\nmoving toward increased conformity with peers (Erikson,\n1968). These two phenomena, individuation and conformity\nwith peers, often contribute to the confusion associated with\nadolescence, a phenomenon conceptualized by Erikson as\n\"Identity Versus Role Confusion.\" On one hand, the adoles-\ncent wants to establish himself or herself as an independent\nentity from his or her parents, often pushing against family,\ncommunity, and religious rules and norms. Changes in\nappearance, style of dress, music preference, and choice of\nfriends characterize this individuation. On the other hand,\nthese same changes become the basis for seeking acceptance\nfrom and conformity with the adolescent's peer group.\nConformity or \"fitting in\" with peers, sometimes termed\ncollective identity, takes on enormous significance at ado-\nlescence; being different or standing out in any way is seen\nas problematic. \"Fitting in\" can also have an effect on aca-\ndemic achievement; peer acceptance typically translates\ninto average academic performance at best. According to\nForham and Ogbu (1986), academic success, especially for\nracial and ethnic minority students, may be viewed as\n\"selling out\" to the dominant racial or cultural group. In\nother words, being smart as an adolescent may \"not be\ncool,\" and for racial and ethnic minority children, may be\nseen as trying to gain acceptance by the dominant race or\ncultural group.\nAchievement gap data between White and minority stu-\ndents have been well documented, and these gaps have per-\nsistedandwidenedovertime(NationalCenterforEducational\npercentage of 12th-grade students who were proficient in\nreading was 37% and for math was 25%. In reading, the gap\nin proficiency was 34% between White and Black students\nand 11% between White and Hispanic students. In math, the\ngap in proficiency was 25% between White and Black stu-\ndents and 20% between White and Hispanic students. These\npersistent gaps in academic achievement between Whites\nand racial and ethnic minorities evident nationally across all\n12th-grade students have significant implications for post\u00ad\nhigh school study and vocational training. Many of these stu-\ndents who apply to 2- and 4-year colleges often find\nthemselves taking remedial courses during their first year of\ncollege attendance, needing to demonstrate proficiency\nbefore being permitted to take credit-bearing courses. Poor\nproficiency in reading and math may derail college dreams,\n1Kean University, Union, New Jersey, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSusan Polirstok, Professor of Special Education, Kean University, Union,\nEmail: polirsts@kean.edu\nStrategies to Improve Academic\nAchievement in Secondary School\nStudents: Perspectives on Grit and\nMindset\nSusan Polirstok1\n Keywords\ngrit, mindset, persistence, resilience, peer acceptance, self-efficacy\n2 SAGE Open\nand can result in students having to pay loans for college\ncosts without moving beyond the \"remediation phase\" and\nnever having earned a degree. Similarly, these students will\nbe challenged as well when enrolling in vocational training\nprograms, which require competence in reading and mathe-\nmatics. Have you ever met an auto mechanic who cannot\nread the manual or a carpenter who cannot measure precisely\nor convert fractions as needed?\nIn looking at factors contributing to poor student perfor-\nmance at the secondary level, achievement data from fourth\ngrade and eighth grade are significant data points. As reported\nby National Center for Educational Statistics (2015), the per-\ncentage of students proficient in reading at the fourth-grade\nlevel was 36% and at the eighth-grade level was 34%.\nSimilarly, the percentage of students proficient in math at the\nfourth-grade level was 40% and at the eighth-grade level was\n33%. In both, reading and math, student performance at the\nfourth- and eighth-grade levels was not significantly different\nfrom scores previously demonstrated in 2013. This is consis-\ntent with the findings of Rockoff and Lockwood (2010) on the\ndecline in performance from early grades (K-5) to later grades\n(6-8) and the persistence of these gaps through eighth grade.\nThere is a convergence of several events when adolescents\ntransition to middle school during sixth grade. These events,\nwhich include psychological and physiological changes as well\nas normative declines in motivation and academic achievement,\nmake sixth grade an exceptionally important year for the future\nsuccess of at-risk students. (Saunders, 2014, p. 4)\nDuring the period of young adolescence when it may be \"not\ncool to be smart,\" students who are bright and have strong\nskills already developed, may choose to be passive learners,\nnot demonstrating their abilities and often concealing their\nacademic strengths for fear of garnering recognition.\nIn high school, many of these adolescents are able to rede-\nfine the group to which they want to belong, choosing a more\nproacademic identity. Because high schools are typically\nlarger and have students drawn from a wider catchment area,\nthese students have an opportunity to redefine themselves in\nhigh school by making new friends and joining many new\nclubs and activities. For them, they have been able to negoti-\nate the early adolescent years with little lasting negative out-\ncomes. They seem to have matured sufficiently and are more\nable to accept academic challenges as part of the overall\nlearning experience. However, for the group of young ado-\nlescent middle school students who are typically close to\nfailing, the \"not cool to be smart\" style of operation may\nhave a significant negative effect on academic performance\nand opportunities over time. \"Much less attention has been\npaid to understanding the magnitude of student disengage-\nment in high-poverty middle-grades schools, its impact on\nstudent achievement, and ultimately the role it plays in driv-\ning the nations' graduation rate crisis\" (Balfanz, Herzog, &\nGrit and Mindset\nCarol Dweck's (2007) work on mindset offers good insight\ninto understanding students who seem relatively closed as\nlearners, unwilling to take on academic challenges, in com-\nparison with others who are open to learning new concepts\nand willing to take risks, even as the academic content\nincreases in complexity. Students who are willing to struggle\nwith new ideas and concepts are those who Dweck refers to\nas having a \"growth mindset.\" These are the students who are\nready to challenge the \"not cool to be smart\" perspective and\nare ready to let people see that they may have to struggle to\nlearn a new concept or task. What is important to this group\nof students is the belief that, through hard work, they will\nultimately be able to master what seems so difficult for them\nto learn at any given point. In the face of academic chal-\nlenges, they persevere, embodying an implicit theory\n(Dweck, 1996) that they will eventually master the new\nmaterial. Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews and Kelly (2007)\ncall this persistence in the face of challenge \"grit.\" Students\nwho are successful, able to sustain their effort, and ultimately\nreach their targeted goal over time are gritty. According to\nHochanadel and Finamore (2015), \"It appears that when\nteachers teach students how to persist, a growth mindset\ndevelops, thus improving grit to overcome any challenges\"\n(p. 49). Whether a growth mindset is a function of grit, or\nwhether grit is a function of growth mindset remains open to\ndebate, but clearly these ideas are closely intertwined and\ncan offer a valuable lens into how adolescents may operate\nwhen challenged academically.\nFor those adolescents who are not willing to take on aca-\ndemic challenges and who choose instead to be among those\nwho believe \"smart is not cool,\" Dweck (2007) refers to\nthem as having a fixed mindset. The fixed mindset is best\nviewed as an implicit theory about oneself that is defensive,\nnot wanting anyone to see into one's real academic abilities\nor lack thereof. It may always be better to be viewed as prob-\nlematic in terms of one's behavior, rather than to be seen as a\nstruggling learner. These students, unlike their counterparts\nwith growth mindsets, do not see intelligence as a factor that\ncan grow and change in relation to hard work. Instead, they\nbelieve that that intelligence is static:\nThey have reached the end of their ability or smarts and there is\nnothing they can do about it; for such students, avoidance might\nbe a more rational option, because if they don't try to do\nsomething they feel is beyond them, they can kid themselves\nAccording to Saunders (2014), \"at-risk students who adopt a\nfixed mindset may become trapped in a recursive pattern of\nlow achievement, low motivation, and low effort\" (p. 4). The\nlong-term impact of having a fixed mindset can be damaging\nto future opportunities after high school. So, the real question\nfor teachers is, how do we develop gritty students who can\nPolirstok 3\napproach tasks with growth mindsets? What strategies can\nfacilitate persistence, resilience, increased academic achieve-\nment, and foster a sense of self-efficacy that goes beyond the\nlimits of conformity?\nTeaching Strategies That Can Help\nDevelop a Growth Mindset\nLearning Stories\nSimply telling a student that he or she is bright and can surely\nlearn what is being presented is not a successful strategy;\nbelief in oneself as a learner must come from within. One\nstrategy related to the development of self-efficacy involves\nthe use of \"learning stories\" that capture the narratives of stu-\ndents who are empowered as learners and who yearn for\nmeaningful learning experiences (Pride, 2014). Learning sto-\nries typically include (a) a discussion of a problem or project,\n(b) the learning challenges and the degree of difficulty the\nproblem/project presents, (c) the actions the student chose that\nkept him or her engaged and working in the face of difficulty,\n(d) the way success with this problem/project was assessed,\nand (e) the extent to which the student was successful (Carr,\nMay, & Podmore, 1998). Creating these learning stories over\ntime, from students who are diverse by race, gender, ethnicity,\nand academic background, can serve as an excellent resource\nto help adolescents relate to others like themselves who have\nbeen able to embrace a growth mindset. The digital learning\nstories approach has been successfully employed at the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin for incoming freshman about to\nenroll in rigorous science courses (Tough, 2014). In this arti-\ncle, written by Paul Tough, a case example is provided that\ninvolved minority students discussing how they felt when they\nfirst entered these rigorous science courses, how they had little\nconfidence, and what strategies they used to help them be suc-\ncessful in their studies. The stories that were most effective\neither had a \"belonging\" message or a \"mindset\" message. In\nthe \"belonging\" message, students talked about their fears at\nfirst of not fitting in, of not being smart enough to succeed, and\nwhat things they did that made them feel more like they\nbelonged. In the stories that focused on \"mindset,\" students\nread and discussed an article that focused on how the brain\nwas changeable and, through practice, could foster increased\nconnections, challenging the conscious or unconscious belief\nthat intelligence is static. The outcome of this work at\nUniversity ofTexas atAustin, was that these messages worked;\nmore disadvantaged first-year freshmen students were retained\nand completed more credits after viewing these digital stories\nthan did their comparison students.\nWhat was unique here is the emphasis on developing self-\nefficacy in freshmen by using digital learning stories told by\nupper classmen who were representative of the same back-\ngrounds and neighborhoods where many of the incoming\nfreshmen lived. The connections that were made by the new\nincoming freshmen to these \"belonging\" stories gave them\nthe courage to face the academic challenges presented by the\nrigorous STEM (science, technology, engineering and math-\nematics) curriculum and to embrace a core belief, an implicit\ntheory, that they too could be successful. Relating to stories\nfrom individuals of similar backgrounds helped to strengthen\na growth mindset in these new freshmen and fostered a sense\nof belonging and perseverance that could be what Duckworth\nThis article, written by Tough about the program at the\nUniversity ofTexas atAustin, connects with a book he authored\nin 2012, titled How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity and the\nHidden Power of Character, and to a more recent book\nauthored in 2016, titled Helping Children Succeed: What Works\nand Why? In both these texts, Tough argues that overcoming\nthe problems associated with growing up poor requires that stu-\ndents learn the skills associated with character including grit,\ncuriosity, and an embrace of challenges that are linked with\nopportunities. In essence, developing grit and mindset can lead\nto success and increased opportunities; teachers need to create\nclassroom environments that provide children with chances to\nsee themselves differently as learners who can be successful.\nAdolescent Literature\nLike digital learning stories that contribute to students develop-\ning self-efficacy with respect to themselves as learners, charac-\nters from adolescent literature can effectively help students to\nbegin to challenge and change their mindsets from fixed to\ngrowth and to begin to see themselves as resilient (Elish-Piper,\nand young adults can become \"a vehicle for imagining other\nworlds . . . to inhabit other subject's positions and experiences,\ncircumstances and emotions other than their own\" (p. 33). In\nparticular, the use of biographies can offer some insight into\n\"gritty\" characters that struggle, persist, demonstrate resilience,\nand ultimately succeed. \"Salt in His Shoes: Michael Jordan in\nPursuit of a Dream (Jordan & Jordan, 2003) highlights the\nchallenges Michael Jordan faced and how he developed\npatience, determination, and a commitment to hard work\"\n(Elish-Piper, 2014, p. 62). Biographies of individuals who have\novercome significant challenges may be very impactful for\nyoung adolescents, especially if the highlighted individual is\nsomeone who comes from a similar circumstance and back-\nground. Kaufman and Libby (2012) provide evidence that\nbeliefs and behaviors can be changed through an imaginative\n\"experience taking\" process based on fictional narratives and\nfirst-person stories. Similarly, Tough (2012) discusses the\n\"power of character\" and both digital learning stories and biog-\nraphies of individuals who have succeeded in the face of con-\nsiderable challenges are good illustrations of this concept.\nThe Choice Map\nEmbedded in the journeys that characters take in adoles-\ncent literature are the \"moment by moment\" choices they\n4 SAGE Open\nmake along the ongoing paths of the narrative. Adolescents\nneed to understand that these same kinds of choices are\nmade every day by themselves and others in their world,\nand that these very choices can have profound effects on\nthe outcomes of their lives. Making choices and under-\nstanding the resultant outcomes of those choices is a big\npart of helping students to \"grow up.\" According to Marilee\nAdams (2013), these choices emanate from either a\n\"learner mindset\" or a \"judger mindset,\" and can be\ndepicted graphically in the \"Choice Map.\" In Adams' para-\ndigm, the \"learner mindset\" path is typically filled with\nchoices, whereas the \"judger mindset\" path is typically\nfilled with self-deprecating comments. Adams notes the\nimportance of the \"switch\" where a person can change his\nor her path, or mindset, from judger to learner. The \"Choice\nMap\" provides a graphic approach to following decisions\nand feelings that students themselves, or people they know,\nor characters they have read about, may experience. This\napproach helps students to understand the consequences\nthat result from decisions, and the actions that can be taken\nto \"switch\" from one path to another, from a mindset that\nis limiting to another that provides many options.\nRecognizing that one can overcome the judgmental, nega-\ntive, and self-deprecating comments that often compete\nwith positive feelings and actions can be life altering! How\noften do students with fixed mindsets experience the nega-\ntive and self-deprecating thoughts that Adams' map depicts\nand how can teachers help these students literally find the\nswitch to a growth (learner) mindset?\nThe Brainology Program\nA software program geared for students in fifth grade to\nninth grade, developed by Mindset Works, Inc. (2017)\n(https://www.mindsetworks.com/kid/programDescription) is\ndesigned specifically to increase academic performance by\nhelping students to develop the self-efficacy or mindset nec-\nessary for success. Underlying this self-efficacy or mindset\nis a belief that intelligence can be developed in the same way\na muscle of the body can be developed through hard work\nand practice. \"Brainology makes this happen by teaching\nstudents how the brain functions, learns and remembers, and\nhow it changes in a physical way when we exercise it\"\n(mindsetworks.com). This software program applies the\nphysical exercise metaphor to understanding specific skills\nand strategies for addressing learning tasks and concepts. To\nimplement the program requires anywhere from 7 to 12 hr\nand the training can be done over a 5- to 16-week period. The\nprogram consists of an online training module that addresses\nfour instructional units and is followed by up to 10 hr of\nclassroom activities.\nOne research study (Saunders, 2014) was conducted to\nassess the impact of Brainology on the reading performance\nof low-achieving sixth graders on the cusp of failing.\nWhereas this study did not find a treatment effect for changes\nin the target behavior, focus group interviews did find that\nstudents believed the Brainology program (n.d.) had affected\ntheir understanding of intelligence.Another study by Wilkins\n(2014) examined the impact of the Brainology program on\nyoung adolescents and found no difference in academic or\nself-efficacy measures, but noted improvement in the content\nengagement and increased motivation. Clearly, more studies\nneed to be conducted to determine the efficacy of this pro-\ngram on developing both grit and growth mindsets, but fos-\ntering increased engagement, motivation, and a better\nunderstanding of intelligence may be valuable in helping to\nchange a student's implicit theory about himself or herself as\na learner.\nThe 7 Mindsets: Ultimate Life Summit Program\nThis program developed by Shickler and Waller (2011),\nbased on their book titled The 7 Mindsets, provides direct\ninstruction in mindsets and highlights the importance of\ngrit and resilience for students in Grades 5 to 9 during a\n7-day summer camp experience. The seven mindsets that\nthis program focuses on include \"Everything is Possible,\nPassion First, We Are Connected, 100% Accountable,\nAttitude of Gratitude, Live to Give, and The Time is Now\"\nognize that success in the future begins within themselves,\nin the big dreams they create that grow out of a passion or\na talent they possess. Moreover, the program teaches that\nstudents are accountable for their actions and choices; they\nare the makers of their own fates and create their own hap-\npiness. Connectedness is another focus of this program;\nstudents are asked to explore what they give and what they\nget from relationships, how relationships are often untapped\nresources, and the importance of making positive connec-\ntions with, and contributions to, the community and the\nlarger world. Finally, the last mindset, \"the Time is Now\"\naddresses seizing the moment to begin to make changes in\none's life that can enhance one's current path or lead to a\nnew path, giving life purpose and direction. In this last\nmindset, taking action and possibly changing one's path,\nnot only with respect to school success but also more\nbroadly to success as a person in the world, help students\nlearn about empowerment.\nGamel (2014) employed this model as a means of study-\ning grit and resilience building in 45 predominantly older\nadolescents drawn from an international sample of students.\nAs a consequence of training, the sampled students were bet-\nter able to understand resilience in themselves and had a bet-\nter appreciation of openness to possibilities, passions, and\naccountability in the future. Students were asked to develop\na life plan for their future as part of the training. Having stu-\ndents focus on how they might shape their own future\nrequires a growth mindset, goal setting, and lots of resilience\nto plan how to address roadblocks and pitfalls that have the\npotential to derail meeting their goals in the future.\nPolirstok 5\nBehavioral and Cognitive Approaches\nThere are several behavioral and cognitive approaches that\ncan be employed in the classroom that will contribute to the\ndevelopment of a growth mindset for adolescents who lack\nthe resilience and the grit to persevere in completing tasks\nthat are getting progressively more challenging. These\napproaches include peer tutoring, self-evaluation, and verbal\nself-instruction. Even though all these approaches employ\ncontingent reinforcement, they do so in the context of learn-\ning to meet academic challenges, monitoring one's own per-\nformance, and learning how to persist in the face of\nself-defeating thoughts and behaviors. As Yeager and Dweck\n(2012) point out, \"we should not praise children for being\n`smart' when they do well, but rather, to promote resilience,\npraise them for the process they engaged in--their effort,\ntheir strategies, their focus, or their persistence\" (p. 311).\nPeer tutoring. Peer tutoring is a well-documented technique\nthat has been used over 30 years to increase the academic\nperformance and sometimes the social/behavioral perfor-\nmance of both tutors and tutees alike. Peer tutoring has been\nimplemented in various formats including reciprocal peer\ntutoring, cross-age and cross-grade peer tutoring, and class-\nwide peer tutoring.\nWexler, Reed, Pyle, Mitchell and Barton (2015) synthesized the\nmediated reading and math interventions for secondary\nstruggling learners and found that it was a moderately to highly\neffective intervention for struggling learners at the secondary\n\"The success of peer tutoring for both tutors and tutees is\nlikely from incorporated instructional features such as fre-\nquent opportunities to respond, increased time on-task, and\nregular and immediate feedback\" (Bowman-Perrott et al.,\nStudents who have a fixed mindset and diminished confi-\ndence in themselves as learners can be specifically selected\nand trained to be tutors, to either work with younger students\nwho have weaker skill sets or to work with same-age peers,\nand dispense verbal praise to tutees who are on-task and\nmaking progress toward successful completion of assign-\nments. In other words, students do not have to tutor academic\nskills; students can be trained to tutor on-task behaviors\nrather than academic content. The act of serving as a tutor\ncan result in enhancement of one's social status with peers,\nwhile garnering reinforcement from the teacher or teachers\nwho have established the tutoring program for their effec-\ntiveness in dispensing praise to tutees for remaining on-task\nto complete assignment requirements. By engaging in this\nprocess, the tutors themselves learn the rules of persistence\nto task completion and this learning can generalize to the\ntutor's own performance in his or her academic classes\ntures of verbal praise is that it is reciprocal; the recipient of\nthe praise typically acknowledges its receipt, either by com-\nmenting verbally or by using head nods, smiles, and so forth.\nAs a consequence of dispensing verbal approval, the tutors\nare likely to receive increased reinforcement from the tutees\nvia their verbal and nonverbal "
