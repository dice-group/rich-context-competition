Therefore,\nthe role of Ang (1\u00ad7) in Ang I and Ang II contraction was evaluated in aortas from Wistar rats after 48-hour coronary\nocclusion treated with captopril or losartan.\nMethods: Concentration-response curves to Ang I or Ang II were conducted in the absence or presence of Ang (1\u00ad7)\nand A779: a) sham group; b) 48-hour coronary occlusion; c) treated with captopril or d) losartan (3.1 mg/kg, i.m.).\nResults: Captopril caused a significant increase in the contractile effect of Ang I and Ang II, while losartan reduced it.\nThe presence of Ang (1\u00ad7) in the captopril group showed a reduction of the contraction compared to the sham group,\nwhile the treatment with losartan did not show a significant difference. Ang (1\u00ad7) presents effects different from Ang I\nor Ang II.\nConclusion: Ang (1\u00ad7) showed a modulatory role, suggesting Ang I did as well after treatment with an ACE inhibitor\nbut not with an AT1\nreceptor antagonist.\n",

Also, the hepta-\npeptide potentiates the vasodilator effect of bradykinin in\nthe conscious rat.11 Additionally, it has been described that\nAng (1\u00ad7) plasma levels are increased in rats, dogs and\nAng (1\u00ad7) is a modulator of the\nvasoconstrictor actions of\nAng I and Ang II\nJazm\u00edn Flores-Monroy1,2, Ignacio Valencia-Hern\u00e1ndez2\nand Luisa Mart\u00ednez-Aguilar1\n Keywords\nAngiotensin (1\u00ad7), angiotensin I, myocardial infarction\nLaboratorio de Farmacolog\u00eda del Miocardio, Facultad de Estudios\nSuperiores Cuautitl\u00e1n, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3nioma de M\u00e9xico,\nMexico\nLaboratorio de Farmacodinamia, Escuela Superior de Medicina,\nInstituto Politecnico Nacional, Mexico\nCorresponding author:\nLuisa Martinez-Aguilar, Facultad de Estudios Superiores Cuautitl\u00e1n,\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3nioma de M\u00e9xico, Cuautitlan Izcalli, Estado\nde M\u00e9xico, Av. 1\u00ba de Mayo s/n Col, Santa Mar\u00eda las Torres, Cuautitl\u00e1n\nOriginal Article\nhumans treated with captopril or losartan.12 To date it is\nunknown whetherAng (1\u00ad7) has a role in the vascular con-\ntractility of Ang I and Ang II in the aorta of infarcted\nWistar rats previously treated with an ACEi or ARB.\nTherefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the\nrole of the Ang (1\u00ad7) on the vasoconstrictor effect induced\nby Ang I or Ang II in aorta from rats treated with an ACE\ninhibitor or an Ang antagonist after 48 hours of coronary\nocclusion.\nMethods\nAnimals\nCINVESTAV-IPN (Sede Sur). Rats were placed in indi-\nvidual boxes with light-dark cycles of 12 \u00d7 12 hours with\nfree access to food and water. Rats were grouped as fol-\nlows: a) sham group with vehicle; b) 48-hour coronary\nocclusion with vehicle; c) treated with captopril; d) treated\nwith losartan. Animals were euthanized 48 hours after cor-\nonary occlusion, and aortic rings of all experimental\ngroups were incubated in the absence or presence of Ang\nwere administered at a dose of 3.1 mg/kg intramuscularly\n(i.m.) 30 minutes before the occlusion and 24 hours after.\nThe experimental protocols were designed according to\nthe Federal Regulation for Animals Experimentation and\nReagents\nCaptopril, losartan, Ang I, Ang II, Ang (1\u00ad7), ketamine\nand xylaxine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.\nPhysiological saline solution (0.1 ml) was administered as\nvehicle. Ang I, Ang II and Ang (1\u00ad7) were dissolved in\nKrebs-Heinselet solution.\nInduction of MI\nTo induce MI, the left anterior descending coronary\nartery was ligated between the pulmonary outflow tract\nand the left atrium using 5-0 silk suture under aseptic\nconditions in anesthetized rats (ketamine HCl/xylazine,\ncillin subcutaneously (s.c.)). Onset of ventricular arrhyth-\nmias and the presence of myocardial blanching distal to\nthe occlusion confirmed successful ligation of the artery.\nOrgans were returned to the thorax cavity and sutured\nusing 2-0 silk suture. Sham-operated animals were inter-\nvened in the same manner but suture was not placed\naround the coronary artery. The infarcted area was deter-\nmined using blue tetrazolium, which stains healthy tissue\nblue. The staining made it possible to measure the\ninfarcted area by planimetry.\nIsolated organ bath experiments.The thoracic aorta was\nexcised and placed in fresh Krebs-Henseleit solution con-\n,\nenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) aerated with 95%\nat 37\u00b0C. The aortas were cleaned of surround-\ning tissue and cut into rings that were 4\u00ad5 mm long. The\naortic rings were mounted in 10 ml chamber tissue baths\nfilled with Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37\u00b0C (pH 7.4) and\nthey were continuously aerated with 95% O2\n. To\nrecord the semi-isometric force development, the rings\nwere suspended on two wire hooks (NUBRYTE wire) and\nfixed to the bottom of the chamber and a force transducer\nsystem (from BIOPAC Systems Inc, Santa Barbara, CA,\nUSA). The ring segments were adjusted to a tension of 3 g.\nThe integrity of the endothelium was evaluated by the vas-\nodilator response after the administration of 10-5 M acetyl-\ncholine to aortic rings that had been pre-treated with 10-6\nM phenylephrine.\nThe vasoconstrictor effect of Ang I and Ang II.Concentra-\nwere obtained using rat aortic rings with endothelium\nfrom the sham group and the infarcted previously\ntreated with the vehicle, losartan or captopril (1 mg/kg\ni.m.) 30 minutes before occlusion was made and 24\nhours later.\nAng (1\u00ad7) antagonism.Concentration-response curves to\n10 minutes before generating the curves10 were obtained\nusing rat aortic rings with endothelium from the sham\ngroup and the infarcted previously treated with the vehicle,\nlosartan or captopril (1 mg/kg i.m.) 30 minutes before\nocclusion was made and 24 hours later.\nCalculation of maximal response and ED50. The calculation\nof both parameters was made by WinNonlin professional\n2.1 software from raw data of each curve (n = 9) for all\nexperimental groups.\nStatistical analysis\nThe concentration-response graphs were developed with\nthe GraphPadPrism5 software. To compare the infarcted\narea, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was car-\nried out. The data obtained in the concentration-response\ncurves were analyzed through a two-way ANOVA, estab-\nlishing a value less than p < 0.05 to report a significant\ndifference.\n256 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\nResults\nDetermination of the percentage of the\ninfarcted area\nTable 1 shows the results of the infarcted area 48 hours\nafter the coronary occlusion was performed in all experi-\nmental groups.

The figure shows that both angiotensins induced a\nconcentration-dependent contraction and, compared with\nthe sham group, the contractile effect in the aortic rings\nwith 48-hour coronary occlusion shows no significant dif-\nference, while those obtained under captopril treatment\nprovoked a significant increase in the contractility (p < 0.01\nin both angiotensins). Such an increase is related to an aug-\nment in the maximal effect (Emax\nbut not in the EC50 values (Table 3). The presence of Ang\n(1-7) in the aortic rings from rats treated with captopril sig-\nnificantly reduced the Ang II contractile effect to control\nvalues but not in the case of Ang I (Figure 1(a) and (b));\nsuch a reduction is related to an Emax\nvalue reduction\n(Table 2). The Ang (1\u00ad7) induced an increased PD2 value\nTable 1.

The values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 9). Figure (a)\nand (c) show that Ang (1\u00ad7) generates a modulator effect that leads to vasoconstriction related with captopril treatment and when\nlosartan is administered it does not participate.

On the other hand, the treatment with losartan\nprovoked a significant reduction of the contraction and Emax\nvalue and an increase in the EC50 generated by Ang I and\nAng II compared with the sham group (p < 0.05 for all\ncases). However, the incubation with Ang (1\u00ad7) did not\nshow a significant change (Figure 1(c) and (d)). The pres-\nence of A779 and Ang (1\u00ad7) generated an increase in the\nvasoconstrictor effect of Ang II with both treatments. In the\ncase of Ang I, the presence of A779 and Ang (1\u00ad7) showed\na vasodilator effect with captopril treatment and no effect\nwith treatment of an AT1\nantagonist.\nDiscussion\nThe present work demonstrated that Ang (1\u00ad7) showed a\nbiphasic role in the contractility induced by Ang I and Ang\nII in the aortic rings of infarcted rats treated with captopril\nor losartan. Although Ang (1\u00ad7) showed a modulatory\neffect present when the ACE is inhibited, possibly by a\nsynergistic effect between the ACE inhibitor and Ang\n(1\u00ad7), in the case of losartan it does not. Also, we found\nthat Ang I generates contractile effects different from Ang\nII with captopril or losartan treatments.\nThe result of the infarcted area by the treatment with\ncaptopril or losartan agrees with other studies14\u00ad16 that\nfound that ACEis do not reduce the infarcted area; it par-\nticipates in a process that limits the growth of the necrosed\narea due to the interaction of bradykinin with B2\nrecep-\ntors. This effect disappears with the administration of the\nantagonist of these receptors, HOE140.15 Regarding the\nreduction caused by losartan, it was published that ARBs\nstop the ischemia process owing to the activation of AT2\nreceptors, bradykinin and prostaglandins in pigs (like-\nwise, the effect is reversed by the administration of\nEven when the sham and MI groups showed no statistical\ndifferences to both angiotensins, the MI group generated\nbigger maximal effect values. This can be explained by\nthe fact that the ability of nitric oxide (NO) to relax the\nvascular tone is altered during MI. This effect is the result\nof the reduction in the vascular response to NO, more\nthan the reduction of the liberation of NO.18 It is also\nknown that during MI the levels of Ang II are increased\nwith a vasoconstrictive effect, and that this is the most\nimportant determinant for the generation of cardiac\nremodeling.19 As observed with captopril treatment, the\ncontractile effect to both angiotensins increased, which\nshows that the drug does not inhibit the enzyme com-\npletely.20 It also might exacerbate the activity of other\nenzymes present in the system we know of: Chymase,\nelastase and cathepsin G hydrolyze Ang I to Ang II5,21\nand to act under hypoxic conditions as in MI or even in\nAng (1\u00ad12) discovered by Nagata.22 Therefore the grad-\nual increased in the contraction is due to the hydrolysis of\nAng I to become Ang II.\nIn contrast, the treatment with losartan generates a\nreduction in the contractile effects after 48 hours, suggest-\ning it can be due to the blockade of theAT1\nreceptors. It has\nalso been reported that AT1\nreceptor blockade stimulates\nthe production of Ang (1\u00ad7) due to the increase in the con-\ncentration of Ang II (main precursor).23,24 It is important to\nmention that Ang (1\u00ad7) generated a reduction in the vaso-\nconstriction of Ang II with the captopril treatment. Several\nresearchers have suggested that Ang (1\u00ad7) might act as an\nendogenous ACEi and obtain a synergic effect with capto-\npril,25,26 preventing bradykinin hydrolysis in addition that\nAng (1\u00ad7) increases the vasodilating actions of it.8,9 Other\nresults obtained from our laboratory support it because,\nwhen the rings were incubated with L-arginine methyl\nester (L-NAME), the vasodilating effect were reversed,\nproving that this is due to the liberation of NO (not\nreported).

We propose Ang I to be this\nmodulator because depending on the presence of an ACE\ninhibitor or an ARB, it leads Ang (1\u00ad7) to generate vaso-\nconstriction or vasodilation, possibly by the participation\nof unknown peptides or enzymes. Even though it is\nreported that Ang I has no effects by itself because it just\nprovides the substrate for the vasoactive peptides Ang II\nand Ang (1\u00ad7), we might be mistaken.\n"
