Experimen-\ntal and epidemiological studies have demonstrated a\nstrong association of IR with many diseases or metabolic\nabnormalities, including coronary heart disease, stroke,\ntype 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, systemic\ninflammation, and atherogenesis (1, 2).\nIt is estimated that approximately 20.6 million adults\naged 20 years or older in the US have diabetes, with the\nprevalence of hyperinsulinemia has increased by 35%\namong nondiabetic adults in the US in the past decade (4).\nIt is believed that IR and subsequently compensatory\nhyperinsulinemia develop much earlier than -cell dys-\nfunction and may exist and progress years before even\nprediabetes would be diagnosed by the detection of\n1 Department of Family Medicine, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta,\n2 Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic\nDisease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, GA.\n3 Clinical Research Center and 4 Cardiovascular Research Institute, More-\nhouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.\n* Address correspondence to this author at: Yuan-Xiang Meng, Depart-\nment of Family Medicine, Morehouse School of Medicine, 1513 East Cleveland\nymeng@msm.edu.\nThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do\nnot necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\n5 Nonstandard abbreviations: IR, insulin resistance; CRP, C-reactive pro-\ntein; TG, triglyceride; HDL-C, HDL cholesterol; BMI, body mass index;\nHOMA, homeostasis model assessment; SBP, systolic blood pressure; LDL-C,\nLDL cholesterol.\nMetabolism\nimpaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that early interven-\ntions, including lifestyle modification and pharmacologi-\ncal treatment, can effectively delay the onset of diabetes\nin prediabetic individuals and therefore decrease the\nincidence of cardiovascular disease and other diabetes-\nrelated chronic illnesses (5, 6). Thus, early identification\nof individuals who have developed IR is particularly\nimportant in clinical practice, but diagnosis is challenging.\nAlthough IR can be determined by a variety of meth-\nods, they are difficult to apply in daily clinical practice,\nparticularly in outpatient care settings. Evidence indi-\ncates that compensatory hyperinsulinemia is highly cor-\nrelated with IR (7) and may offer a more useful way to\nidentify insulin-resistant patients than measurements of\nglucose intolerance. However, analytic methods for insu-\nlin measurements are not standardized, and it is difficult\nto relate absolute values of plasma insulin concentrations\nfrom one laboratory to another (8).\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker for systemic subclin-\nical inflammation and may have prognostic value in identi-\nfying persons who are at an increased risk of developing\ntype 2 diabetes and subsequent cardiovascular complica-\ntions (9). Given its ease of measurement, biological stability,\nand improved high-sensitivity method, CRP may be useful\nas a clinical measure for identifying individuals at risk for IR\n(10). CRP has been associated with increased adiposity (11),\nbut only a few studies have demonstrated that CRP is\nassociated with IR independent of obesity (12).\nBecause it is not feasible to directly measure IR in\nlarge epidemiologic studies, surrogate measures using\nfasting insulin or the combination of fasting insulin\nwith fasting glucose or triglyceride (TG) have been\nproposed (13\u00ad21). Little is known, however, about the\nassociation of CRP with different surrogate measures of\nIR. In this study, we used data from the National Health\nto examine the association of CRP with a series of surrogate\nmeasures of IR.\nMaterials and Methods\nstudy design and participants\nsample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population.\nTrained interviewers, using a computer-assisted personal\nsurvey system, spoke to participants at home. Respon-\ndents were then asked to attend a mobile examination\ncenter, where they completed additional questionnaires,\nunderwent various examinations, and provided blood\nbe found elsewhere (22, 23). This analysis was limited to\nmen and nonpregnant women who were 20 years old,\nwere non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexi-\ncan-American Hispanics, did not use hormone therapy,\nhad no diagnosed diabetes or hypoglycemia medications\nor fasting glucose 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), had morn-\ning blood drawn with fasting time 8 h, and had CRP\nprocedures\nDetailed descriptions of blood collection and processing\nhave been previously provided (24). In brief, serum\nspecimens were frozen at 70 \u00b0C, shipped on dry ice,\nand stored at 70 \u00b0C until analysis. CRP concentrations\nwere quantified at the University of Washington Medical\nCenter, Seattle, WA, by latex-enhanced nephelometry, a\nhigh-sensitivity assay, on a BN II nephelometer (Dade\nBehring). Control materials of 2 concentrations from Bio-\nRad Laboratories were used for QC purposes, and CVs\nSerum insulin concentration was measured using an\nRIA reagent set from Pharmacia Diagnostics. The cross-\nreactivity of Pharmacia insulin antibody with proinsulin\nis approximately 40%. All insulin assays for NHANES\nUniversity of Missouri-Columbia. Identical laboratory\nprocedures for insulin assays and their QC were per-\nformed. The overall CVs were 3.3%\u00ad5.4% in NHANES\nusing an enzymatic reaction. Serum TG concentration\nwas measured enzymatically after hydrolyzation to glyc-\nerol, and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) was measured after\nthe precipitation of other lipoproteins with a heparin-\nmanganese chloride mixture.\nUp to 4 blood pressure readings were obtained in\nthe mobile examination center. The mean of the last 2\nmeasurements for participants who had 3 or 4 mea-\nsurements, the last measurement for participants with\n2 measurements, and the single measurement for par-\nticipants who had only 1 measurement were used to\nestablish blood pressure status. Body mass index\n[BMI  weight (kg)/height (m)2] was calculated using\nmeasured weight and height, and BMIs were catego-\naccording to WHO criteria (25). Waist circumference\nwas measured with a steel measuring tape to the\nnearest 0.1 cm at the high point of the iliac crest at\nminimal respiration.\nsurrogate measures of ir\nA total of 10 surrogate measures of IR were used in this\nstudy, including fasting insulin, homeostasis model as-\nsessment (HOMA) of IR, log (1/HOMA), empirical fast-\ning IR index, fasting insulin:fasting glucose ratio,\nRaynaud index, Bennetts index, quantitative insulin sen-\nsitivity check index, Avignon index, and McAuley index\n(see Appendix). Nine indices were derived from the\nmeasures of fasting insulin and fasting glucose or TG.\nThe formulas for calculating these indices are provided\nin the Appendix. In addition, we included the C-peptide\nconcentrations as a marker of insulin secretion because it\nis cosecreted with insulin in equimolar amounts but is not\nsubject to hepatic clearance (26).\nstatistical analysis\nWe assessed continuous variables for gaussian distribu-\ntion and performed logarithm transformation for fasting\ninsulin, CRP, and C-peptide to approximate a gaussian\ndistribution. Means and Pearson correlation coefficients\nwere calculated for all surrogate measures of IR and\nCRP. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed\nto assess the association of CRP with IR surrogate mea-\nsures, adjusting for potential confounders including age,\nsex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, systolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP), and concentrations of HDL-C, LDL cholesterol\n(LDL-C), and TG. Additional adjustment for waist cir-\ncumference was made to examine the role of central\nobesity in the association. Using the standardized score of\ndependent and independent variables, a standardized\nregression coefficient of CRP for each IR measure was\ncalculated to facilitate the comparisons of association\nbetween CRP and the IR surrogate measures with differ-\nent units.\nBecause no standardization of insulin assay is avail-\nable, a universal cutoff value of fasting insulin or HOMA\nto define IR is not available. Therefore, we defined the\nHOMA-IR using the 75th percentile of HOMA generated\namong nondiabetic adults in NHANES III as a cutoff\nvalue according to the suggestion of the European Group\nfor the Study of Insulin Resistance (27). In addition, we\ncategorized CRP into 3 groups (1, 1 to 3, and 3 mg/L)\n(28). To examine the role of obesity for the association of\nCRP with IR surrogate measures, odds ratios and 95% CI\nof CRP for HOMA-IR were estimated in multiple logistic\nregression models stratified by the 3 BMI categories. An \nof 0.05 was used to define statistical significance for\n2-sided tests. All analyses were conducted using SAS\n(version 8.2) and SUDAAN software (Release 9.0, Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute), to account for the complex\nsampling design.\nResults\nAmong participants who met inclusion criteria for our\nanalyses (n  4040), we further excluded those with\nmissing data for fasting insulin, glucose, C-peptide, TG,\nHDL-C, or LDL-C (n  1392), and for smoking, SBP,\nweight, height, or waist circumference (n  134).

The associations were attenu-\nated after further adjustment for waist circumference\n(model 2; Table 3).

There was a marginally significant interaction\nbetween CRP and BMI on HOMA-IR (P  0.07).\nDiscussion\nUsing the recent nationally representative sample, we\nfound that CRP was significantly associated with all 10\nsurrogate measures of IR among nondiabetic US adults.\nThis association appeared to be consistent across the 3\nracial or ethnic groups. Approximately 60%\u00ad75% of the\nvariance for the association of CRP with IR was explained\nby central obesity status as measured by waist circumfer-\nence. Among obese participants with a high concentration\nof CRP (3 mg/L), approximately 76% had IR as defined\nusing the 75th percentile of HOMA. More importantly,\nour data showed that CRP was significantly associated\nwith surrogate measures of IR among people with a BMI\nThe unique results of our study are the consistent\nsignificant associations of CRP with all 10 surrogate IR\nmeasures and across the 3 racial or ethnic groups. Among\nthe 10 surrogate measures of IR, CRP appeared to be more\nstrongly associated with fasting insulin, Raynaud index,\nquantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and McAuley\nindex. The common feature of these 4 IR indices is that\nthey involve only fasting insulin or an addition of fasting\nglucose or TG, suggesting that the fasting glucose concen-\ntration does not always correctly reflect the status of IR or\ninsulin action. Previous studies have shown that fasting\ninsulin alone may be a simple and effective surrogate\nmeasure of IR (29). Our results are consistent with these\nstudies in that fasting insulin was at least as good as other\ncomplex indices of IR in relation to CRP.\nOur results were consistent with previous studies that\nhave examined associations of some measures of IR, such\nTable 1.

It is interesting\nthat although measurements of fasting glucose concentra-\ntions are necessary for the diagnosis of prediabetes and\ndiabetes according to the current clinical guidelines, in\nnondiabetic individuals these measurements may not be\nnecessary for identifying IR, whereas measurements of\nfasting insulin can be quite useful. Commercial laborato-\nries should consider reporting not only the absolute\ninsulin concentration but also information as to where the\nvalue falls within the laboratory's frequency distribution\nof nondiabetic individuals.\nAs shown in our study, approximately 60%\u00ad75% of the\nvariance for the association between CRP and IR can be\nexplained by waist circumference, suggesting that central\nobesity plays an important role in the association of CRP\nwith IR. Numerous studies have shown that both CRP\nwhether obesity plays a role as a moderator or mediator\nfor the association of CRP with IR is still elusive. Recent\nstudies have demonstrated that obesity was a major\ndeterminant for the association of CRP with metabolic\nsyndrome among patients with type 2 diabetes (35) and in\nthe general adult population (36). Our results add further\nsupport for the notion that central obesity as measured by\nwaist circumference or overall obesity as measured by\nBMI could be a mediator for the association of CRP with\nIR among nondiabetic adults.\nIn addition, consistent with recent studies (34), we\nfound that this relationship was also significant among\npeople who had normal weight (BMI 25 kg/m2). Al-\nthough the mechanism for the association between CRP\nTable 2.

This and other previous studies (34)\nreporting the association of CRP with IR independent of\nobesity suggest that another pathway linking inflamma-\ntion and IR among nonobese individuals is also plausible.\nIn the high IR tertile, about 1 in 6 people was of normal\nweight (37); thus the search for clinically useful biomar-\nkers of IR among this subpopulation is necessary. Al-\nthough BMI, a less expensive and convenient measure,\nmay serve as an indicator for IR among people with\nexcessive weight, CRP could be 1 of the novel biomarkers\nfor IR among people with normal weight.\nOne of the interesting findings in our study was the\nlack of association between CRP and surrogate measures\nof IR among people who were overweight (i.e., BMI\nbiochemical mechanisms for this observation are un-\nknown, but this finding might be attributable to the poor\ndiscriminatory power of BMI for body fat and lean mass.\nA recent study demonstrated that a BMI 30 kg/m2\nhad good specificity but poor sensitivity, whereas a BMI\n25 kg/m2 had good sensitivity but poor specificity to\ndetect obesity as defined by body fat 25% in men and\n35% in women (38). Small increases of BMI as seen in\noverweight people could be due to increases in body fat\nor increments in lean mass or both. Preserved and in-\ncreased lean mass have been associated with better fitness\nand exercise capacity, whereas excessive body fatness has\nbeen associated with adverse metabolic profiles (39).\nFurther studies are warranted to examine the mechanisms\nfor the interrelations of CRP, IR, and body composition.\nAlternative methods might be needed to accurately char-\nacterize people who truly have excessive body fat vs those\nwho have increased muscle mass, especially when their\nBMI is mildly increased.\nOur study has several strengths. First, we used 10\nsurrogate measures of IR and C-peptide as a measure-\nment of -cell function (26) to examine the association of\nCRP with IR and insulin secretion. Our results showed\nthat the association appeared to be consistent using any of\nthese measures. Second, we used a large representative\nsample of US adults; therefore, we were able to conduct\nanalyses stratified by race or ethnicity or body weight\nstatus. Our results indicated that the association of CRP\nwith IR is potentially generalizable across different racial\nor ethnic groups because the association between CRP\nand some surrogate measures of IR (e.g., fasting insulin\nand HOMA) appeared to be similar by race/ethnicity.\nTable 4.

Age-adjusted prevalence of insulin resistance by the categories\nof CRP and body mass index.\nInsulin resistance was defined using the 75th percentile of HOMA among\nnondiabetic adults in NHANES III.\nThere are several limitations in the present study. First,\nwe used a cross-sectional design; therefore the observed\nassociation between CRP and surrogate measures of IR\nmay not be assumed causal. It is likely that IR could\ncontribute to the increase of CRP (33). Second, we did not\nhave a direct measure of IR in our data; thus, we were\nunable to validate the surrogate measures. Previous eval-\nuation studies have shown that simple indices, particu-\nlarly fasting insulin, are valid and reliable surrogate\nmeasures of IR in large epidemiologic studies. The 3rd\nlimitation was related to the use of a single insulin assay\nmeasured with the Pharmacia Insulin RIA reagent set.\nBecause no standardization of insulin assays is available\nthus far, caution may be needed when comparing our\nresults with other assays. The cross-reactivity of Pharma-\ncia insulin antibody with proinsulin (approximately 40%)\nmay overestimate the true insulin concentrations in the\npopulation. However, because proinsulin concentration is\nrelatively low among people without diabetes (40), the\nimpact of cross-reactivity between insulin and proinsulin\non our results could be minimal.\nIn conclusion, because we are unable to routinely measure\nIR in clinical practice, efforts to find simple measures for\nIR are ongoing. One of the clinical challenges of identify-\ning individuals with IR is the cumbersome nature of the\nassays. Obesity, particularly central obesity, plays an\nimportant role for the association between CRP and IR;\nhowever, it is conceivable that the use of CRP in clinical\nsettings could facilitate an earlier identification of IR\namong people who may not achieve certain clinical\nthresholds for measures of adiposity or fasting glucose. In\naddition, by providing a simple and cost-effective way to\nidentify high-risk individuals with IR, the measurement\nof CRP concentration might facilitate preventive interven-\ntions in patients who are at greatest risk of developing\ndiabetes, the metabolic syndrome, or cardiovascular\ncomplications.\nGrant/funding support: Y.-X.M. was a Clinical Research Edu-\ncation and Career Development fellow partially supported by\nFinancial disclosures: None declared.\n"
