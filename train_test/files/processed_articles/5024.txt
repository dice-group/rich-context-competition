The article proposes that the subordinate position and related\neducational experiences of peasantry students since the year 2000 are exploitative and to the advantage of the elite to\nsuch an extent that peasants are an internal colony. The analysis is informed by critical anti-colonial perspectives that\nobserve the hegemonic tendencies of global and local capital in collusion with dictatorial elite nationalists. By use of a critical\ninterpretive case study of purposefully sampled students and other relevant members of the university community from\none public university, disturbing student experiences were excavated. Student narratives and experiences were analyzed\nusing the constant comparative method and led to the conclusion that there is internal colonialism in Zimbabwe where\nan alliance of the state and the local and global corporate world are colluding to maintain their economic and political\ndominance. The article challenges those in education and academics that there is need for the decolonization of education\nby first identifying contemporary hegemonic forces and recognizing students from the peasantry as victims of the emerging\nkleptocratic capitalism.\n",

Summative national examinations at Grade 7,\nForm 4 (equivalent to Grade 11) and Form 6 (which could be\nthe equivalent of Grade 13/university entrance level) consis-\ntently indicate that students from rural schools struggle and\nunderperform (Mbanje, 2012) and consequently affecting\nthose who get access into university education and what\ndegree programs one enrolls into.

The analysis in this article is therefore in the con-\ntext of research sensibilities that critique the structures of\nelite nationalist capitalism and neo-colonial Western racial\nwith the explicit objective of contributing toward what\nQuijano (2007) terms \"epistemological decolonization or\ndecoloniality\" (p. 177) or \"decolonization/deconstruction as\na critic of Western hegemonic constructions\" (Mignolo,\ninternal colonial nature of the peasant situation by address-\ning the immizerating conditions of their children in\nuniversities.\nIt is widely shared that \"internal colonialism\" (Blauner,\n\"components of the normal imperial-colonial relations are to\nbe found within the borders of a single state\" (Wolpe, 1975,\np. 229) and is characterized by \"the use of state power by one\nsection of society (the Control Centre) to impose unfavour-\nable rates of exchange on another part of society (the subor-\nrelationship of domination and subordination is established\nor maintained to serve the interests of all or part of the domi-\nnisation, the analogue of the colonial power is an elite and\nnot a country\" (Calvert, 2001, p. 54) and this elite or \"core is\nseen to dominate the periphery politically and to exploit it\nmaterially\" (Hechter, 1975, p. 9). These internal or domestic\ncolonial relationships have been observed and analyzed\nalong race/ethnic perspectives in the New World, with\nGuti\u00e9rrez (2004) labeling it an American theory of race,\nwidely employed by many to explain and understand the\nperennial under-class status of Afro-Americans in the United\nHind, 1984).Asimilar framework has been utilized to expose\nthe continued existence of underdevelopment among indig-\nenous groups in settler nations such as Australia, Canada,\ntique of the racist separate development of apartheid South\nReview of Literature: The Peasantry as\nan Internal Colony\nAny definition of peasants generally should be according to\ntheir form of production. Peasants are traditionally defined\nas people involved in agriculture and have direct access to\nthe production of their means of subsistence (Araghi, 1995).\nThis may or may not involve direct ownership, although for\nMarx it was ownership that fundamentally separated peas-\nants from the proletariat (Archetti & Aass, 1978). What is\ndefinitive about the peasant form of production is that,\nregardless of ownership, the logic of production is subsis-\nduction is distinguished from capitalism because there is no\nappropriation and realization of surplus value or accumula-\ntion of capital. The object is the satisfaction of family needs,\nnot profit (Araghi, 1995). It is different from proletariat pro-\nduction because the individual retains some control.\nTherefore, the notion of subsistence and the maintenance of\nsome control over the means of production are the two cen-\ntralcomponentsmarkingpeasantryproduction.InZimbabwe,\nthe land distribution program since the year 2000 has created\ndifferent classes of rural dwellers. Some have become capital\nproducers and are therefore not the focus of the discussions\nin this article.\nMemmi's (1967) portrait of the colonized vividly reveals a\nhuman being denied human dignity and subdued by force and\nviolence. Following Calderon-Zaks's (2006) analysis, colo-\nnialism is not narrowly defined as a relationship between\n\"nations,\" or at least the colonizing power being a \"nation\" . .\n. but is concerned with a colonized people rather than a colo-\ninternal colonialism is identifiable by the presence of features\nof \"subordination and oppression, not on majority/minority\nnumbers ratios, geographic distance, capital export, foreign-\nness, and legal distinctions\" (p. 236) and by analogy the cur-\nrent socio-economic and political conditions of peasants in\nZimbabwe are colonial. They are characterized by massive\neducational inequalities between urban and rural areas\nUnion [ZINASU], 2010), state and ruling party suppression,\n2011), systematic economic subjugation and infrastructural\nMoore, 2008), and profound health disparities (Ministry of\nHealth Organization, 2010; United Nations Development\nProgram(UNDP), 2000;Zimbabwe National Statistics\nAgency & ICF International, 2012). Access to paved roads,\nelectrified schools, and hospitals, and consumer goods vary\ndirectly with proximity to a town. Rural schools are poorly\nequipped compared with urban schools and summative Grade\n7, Ordinary and Advanced levels results are consistently bet-\nter in urban schools than in rural areas (Gregson, Terceira,\nand there is a restriction in terms of disciplines rural students\ncan study as most schools do not have necessary facilities\nespecially access to power/electricity.\nThese processes have witnessed with policy consistency\nelite nationalists of predominantly urban domicile and party\nleaders fortifying themselves in the towns and cities against\nrural poverty and diseases. One observes since the demise of\nBritish colonial administration a heightened differentiation\nof town and country, urban-centered power elite that has\nfirmly set out to dominate a largely rural society to which\nthey relate as an alien power. Sadomba (2011) posits that\nsince the year 2000 \"the elite grabbed the opportunity for\nheightened primitive accumulation\" (p. 215) by hijacking the\nBlack empowerment and indigenization programs, particu-\nlarly land reforms that were spearheaded by war veterans\nwith the mass support of the peasants. Traditional leaders,\nsuch as chiefs, have been given administrative authority to\ndiscipline their people and in the process paving way for\nunopposed state/corporate penetrations into their traditional\nlands for mining and dam construction (Hawkins, 2009;\nMadebwe, Madebwe, & Mavusa, 2011; Manyanhaire,\nRusinga, Murwendo, & Zinhiva, 2012; Zimbabwe\nEnvironmental Lawyers Association, 2012), programs that\nhave led to displacement of the peasants to give way for irri-\ngation and mining adventures whose benefits have not been\nobserved by the affected people.\nIt is in this sense that the term internal colonization is\nused here to designate the processes by which large parts and\nsections of Zimbabwe are being colonized by their own rul-\ning elite (across the political divide) for both political and\neconomic reasons. Internal colonialism is associated with the\nmanner in which certain sections of society exercise their\nhegemony (Hind, 1984). In the eyes of the ruling Zimbabwe\nAfrican National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) and\nother elite groups in the country, including opposition par-\nties, they are simply making use of the power the interna-\ntional market affords to consolidate their own position as an\nurbanized elite. The indigenization and Black empowerment\nprograms, driven by the elite and accompanied by economic\nand political exploitation of the peasants, and gradually\ntransforming the whole peasantry into a legally feudal (con-\ntrolled by traditional leaders most of them with no knowl-\nedge of a fair justice system especially in relation to gender\nrights and other facets of modern minority inequalities) and\nfactually discriminated class, the lowest in the social ladder,\nis precisely what this article terms internal colonialism.\nIt should be acknowledged that critics have pointed out\nthat there is no attempt in the theory of internal colonialism\nto identify the specific mode of exploitation and domination\nthat differentiates it from class or race exploitation and domi-\nnation (Wolpe, 1975). They have seized on the idea that cer-\ntain individuals in identified under-classes have made it to\nsuccess; for example, the rich Afro-American, the successful\nfrom indigenous First-Nations and from peasant back-\ngrounds. However, by viewing colonial as wider and encom-\npassing \"anything imposed and dominating\" (Dei &\nof poverty, geographical underdevelopment, political and\neconomic domination, gender inequalities among many oth-\ners, one can appreciate the utility of the concept or theory of\ninternal colonialism in gaining an understanding of the sub-\nordinate status of some groups in modern societies.\nMethod\nThis was a critical interpretive case study of a public univer-\nsity in Zimbabwe. Critical interpretivism involves critiquing\npower. In education it considers the politics of education and\nwhen used together with postcolonial perspectives as was\ndone in this study, it develops an activist prong on behalf of\nhistorically colonized people, who continue to be neo-colo-\nnized and oppressed (Apple, 2009). Issues to do with neo-\ncolonized peasants should be approached utilizing critical\ninquiry methods that challenge neoliberalism and national-\nism, simultaneously. Consequently, the goal of this case\nstudy was to develop a holistic picture of the educational\nexperiences of selected students from rural peasantry back-\nof a case study allows the researcher to investigate and report\non complex, dynamic, and unfolding interactions of events,\nhuman relationships, and other factors in a unique instance\n(Creswell, 2007). The researcher had the opportunity to iden-\ntify living conditions, learning conditions, and academic\nexperiences and pursued opportunities for in-depth analysis\nof the phenomenon as they unfolded. Yin (2009) describes a\ncase study \"as an examination of specific phenomenon such\nas a program, an event, a person, an institution or a social\ngroup\" (p. 25). Case study is particularly useful in studies\nthat seek to uncover observable patterns in organizations,\ninstitutions, and countries. Case studies are also heuristic in\nthe sense that they \"illustrate the readers' understanding of\nthe phenomenon under study . . . they can bring about dis-\ncovery of new meaning, extend the reader's experience or\nhowever, several limitations to case study design, a major\none being lack of generalization and time-consuming nature\nof the analysis. Patton (2002) argues, however, that general-\nizations can take several forums, from the features of a single\ncase to many others with similar features or from part of a\ncase to the whole of that case is possible. Therefore, the\nemerging findings can be applied to other students of similar\npeasantry background throughout the country.\nSources of Data\nThe study adopted purposeful sampling techniques, selecting\nparticipants from peasantry background. Utilizing official\nuniversity records from the assistant registrar's office, 50\nparticipants were surveyed or interviewed from a public uni-\nversity in Zimbabwe. No other variables were considered\nimportant. For ethical reasons, the name of the university\nwill not be mentioned. Initial contacts were made at the insti-\n4 SAGE Open\ntution where face-to-face interviews were conducted\n(n = 20). This was followed by questionnaires sent to indi-\nviduals suggested by those previously interviewed (n = 30).\nThe interview was developed following the suggestions of\nMouton (2001), namely, design, construction, and piloting.\nThe final interview instrument combined different kinds of\nquestions dealing with family background, university living\nand learning conditions, academic performance, and partici-\npants' level of awareness of their circumstances. Questions\nwere both semi-structured and unstructured giving room for\ngreater latitude in asking broad questions in ways that the\ninterviewer deemed appropriate and probing for clarification\nand deeper understanding of interviewees.\nDocument analysis as a research method involved the\nprocess of examining and understanding contents in docu-\nments from sources internal and external to the research, in\nthis case official university publications, student and faculty\nunion newsletters, and government policy documents. The\nstudy tried to minimize the pitfalls of document review as a\nnon-interview strategy which are accuracy, relevance,\nauthenticity, and outdated information (McMillan &\nagainst these challenges through a thorough evaluation of the\nauthenticity and relevance of the documents in terms of the\nsources, dates, and accuracy. Miles and Huberman's (1994)\nmethodological approach was used to analyze and interpret\nthe data for the study. According to Miles and Huberman,\ndata reduction is the first step in the process of data analysis,\nand . . . \"it refers to the process of selecting, focusing, simpli-\nfying, abstracting, and transforming the data that appear in\nwriting of field notes or transcriptions\" (p. 16). This advice\ninformed the research.\nEmerging Themes (Findings)\nThe underdeveloped and difficult living conditions of the\npeasants in rural areas were inherited from British colonial\nadministration and are continuing in post-independent\nZimbabwe. Two strong hegemonic forces, namely, elite\nnationalism and neoliberalism, appear to be the dominant\npolicy frameworks. The victims of the consequent system\nare the peasant communities that are integrated and subjected\nto the logic of imperialist expansion (Amin, 2011b). The\nineffective and backward nature of social services is clearly\nmanifested in the education system. Statistics from the\nnational examination board, the Zimbabwe School\nExamination Council (ZIMSEC) consistently show that bet-\nter results come from urban and boarding schools compared\nwith rural day schools (Mbanje, 2012). This is mainly\nexplained by the poor resources found in most rural schools\nthat have resulted in experienced and qualified teachers\nshunning serving in such schools. Most rural areas do not\nhave access to electricity and students attending rural sec-\nondary schools do not study disciplines such as physics,\nchemistry, and biology, and consequently cannot take up\nuniversity courses/programs that require a natural science\nbackground. Rural students are therefore found restricted in\nthe humanities and in a way leading them to low-paying\ncareers.\nIt has also been observed that in internal colonialism, \"the\nunderdeveloped condition is reproduced and maintained by\nthe same mechanisms of cultural domination, political\noppression and economic exploitation\" (Wolpe, 1975, p.\n229). One approach of cultural domination has been the con-\ntinued use of English as the language of instruction and the\nassociated requirement of a pass in English at Ordinary level\nif one is to proceed to post-secondary education. The urban\nare generally better in understanding the English language\ncompared with the rural people and this gives them a clear\nadvantage. Furthermore, under internal colonialism the\nnature of education is governed by authorities outside the\nthere is a blatant bias toward a mono-narrative of nation\nbuilding that reifies nationalist historiography under what is\nPatriotic history is compulsory throughout the education sys-\ntem in various forms. It stresses political history and does not\ntolerate \"disloyal\" issues raised by historians of nationalism\n(Ranger, 2004). Not only does it destroy critical thinking\namong students; it also constructs a picture of sovereignty\nand independence that is largely partisan and not national.\nPeasant Education as Internal Colonialism:\nStudents' Living Conditions\nThe colonial conditions of students from peasant background\ncan further be demonstrated by their living and learning con-\nditions that make meaningful education difficult to attain. As\nall universities are in urban areas, the living conditions of\nmost students with no relatives in cities were found to be\nchallenging. According to a recent study on the University of\nZimbabwe:\nThe halls of residence have been shut, students eat from informal\nroadside caterers and students'vocational loans are not available.\nIt emerged early this year that 28% of students had dropped out\nof the UZ. Students have been struggling to raise fees of between\nless than US$300 per month and unemployment is pegged at\nStudents who endure such conditions do not have rela-\ntives who can provide them with accommodation in the cities\nin which universities are located. These observations are cor-\nroborated by sentiments from university students that were\ninterviewed.\nThe conditions outside campus are pathetic. I am staying in a\ngarage and we are 13 in that room. We now have slums\ndeveloping within the Mount Pleasant area. Those staying\noutside Mount Pleasant have to board two buses to get to\ncampus. That is expensive. We pay $US25 a head. (Interview\nSimilar observations were highlighted by a politically\ncharged study commissioned by the national student body.\nAt the University of Zimbabwe over 5000 students squat in\ngarages in and around Mt Pleasant while their hostels have\nbecome safe havens for rats and bats. The closure was ruled\nillegal by Justice Hlatshwayo at the High court in July 2007 in\ncase the of Trevor Marai & Anr vs Director of Accommodation\n& Catering Services University of Zimbabwe & 3 Ors HC\nadministration. It is clear that the closure is a blatant political\nmove aimed at demobilizing the students of Zimbabwe by some\nuncouth politicians fearing to lose their positions to a student led\nSuch administrative policies and actions negatively affect\nstudents from rural areas more than any other groups and\ntend to drive them into anti-social behavior, risky political\nactivity, or passive compliance to authority or views incon-\ngruent with university culture (Hwami, 2014). Internal colo-\nnialisminvolvesthesubordinationandcontinuingdomination\nof the peasantry in Zimbabwe. As was noted by Welch\n(1988), education often serves as an instrument of internal\ncolonialism by socializing the colonized into an acceptance\nof inferior status, power, and wealth. The higher education\nfinance support mechanism known as the cadetship system\nhas been exposed as a political instrument to pressurize stu-\ndents to support the ruling ZANU PF party.\nThe Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology\nsaid a probe it conducted recently found that the country's\nso-called cadetship programme was highly politicised,\nbenefiting mainly Mugabe sympathisers. Parliament said the\ncadetship programme's criteria for selection were discriminatory,\nranging from political affiliation to faculty preference. It said\nthat proof of the partisanship of the cadet scheme was the recent\nwithdrawal of the funding of 12 students, on the grounds that\nthey supported the Movement for Democratic Change, a rival\nparty to Mugabe's ZANU PF. (Mushininga, 2011)\nEarlier, the largely opposition aligned national student\nbody had made similar observations.\nIt remains the state's responsibility to provide quality and\naffordable education to all its citizens; the cadetship scheme\nmust be revisited, particularly its conditions of bonding, it must\nbe administered by an independent body, which is non-\ndiscriminatory, no-partisan . . . (ZINASU, 2009)\nIt is therefore evident that the university education system\nis unfriendly to children from peasantry background. The\neducational experience from rural schools up to public uni-\nversities appear to develop an inferior graduate who ends up\nunemployed, in low-paying public service career job or a\n\"border jumper\" (people who leave the country, mostly by\nillegal methods, to South Africa, Botswana, and other neigh-\nboring countries). A contrast should be made with children\nfrom dominant classes, mainly from urban areas who attend\nwell-established and resourced schools, boarding schools\nwith highly qualified teachers, and the rich whose children\nattend exclusive private schools with almost all modern edu-\ncational facilities. Students from the latter category are found\ndominating hard sciences faculties that generally lead to\nassured and better-paying careers and some go abroad for\nuniversity studies. What is being observed is \"the existence\nand persistence of an academic underclass\" (DiGiacomo,\n1997, p. 96) that serves the political and economic objectives\nof the elite.\nPeasant Education as Internal Colonialism:\nStudents' Learning Conditions\nThe learning conditions of students from peasantry back-\nground have equally been deteriorating and challenging. It is\ncommon knowledge that most students from rural areas are\npoor and cannot afford to pay university fees without gov-\nernment support. According to one study,\nIn February 2005, the government scrapped off the loan system\nfor students and introduced payment of fees directly. This plus\nthe dollarization of the economy (use of the United States dollar\nas the official currency after the Zimbabwean dollar became\nuseless in 2009) mean education has become fully privatised.\nThis scenario has left many students stranded with no options\nbut to drop out of college or to quit education and go abroad to\nexplore other options. (Students Solidarity Trust, 2011, p. 12)\nOne student told me that\nIn the past you could be allowed to sit for examinations before\npaying up fees, but now we have security guards stationed at\nexamination venues to bar those who have not paid up.\n(Interview notes, Student leader, July 2010)\nA university administrator further confirmed these dis-\nturbing observations:\nI can tell you that we are facing a lot of challenges. What quickly\ncomes to mind is the scenario where students cannot afford\npaying for tuition and government is also not in a position to\nsupport students. So the greatest dilemma is to carry on with\nuniversity education with no one funding it. Students are asked\nto apply for loans/cadetship funds, which they do, but the\ngovernment does not have the money, does not release the\nmoney but expect university education to continue. (Interview\nnotes, University administrator, August 2010)\nAll these processes have culminated in some students\ncompletely failing to complete their studies. These narratives\nand experiences portray the difficult educational conditions\n6 SAGE Open\nbeing experienced by mostly peasant children. Some stu-\ndents have joined student and national politics mainly under\nthe auspices of the ZINASU, but the response of the state has\nbeen vicious. Student activists have been arrested, beaten,\nand many suspended or expelled (see Hwami & Kapoor,\nthat the contemporary suppression of student activism\nresembles the Rhodesian system and corroborates the con-\nclusion that in some post-independent nations, \"a version of\ncolonialism is being reproduced and duplicated from within\"\nDiscussion of Emerging Themes\nThe challenges peasants'children are experiencing should be\nunderstood within the wider context of crises emerging from\nattempts by governments in the periphery to catch up with\nthe modern or developed (north) capitalist world. Modernity\nis viewed by many as Westernization. It is \"exclusively a\n(Un)fortunately, it is also equated to development. The drive\ntoward modernity is seen going against the cultural and tra-\nditional living styles of the peasant and government policies\nare seen as largely informed by the functionalist sociology of\nmodernization-culture affects the character and logic of eco-\nnomic operation. According to Amin (2011a),\nThe second intuition is that economics or more precisely\neconomic (and social) changes, induces the phenomena of\nacculturation and deculturation, namely changes the culture.\nThe relationship between culture and economics is dialectic\nrather than functionalist or structural. (p. 144)\nThe level of opposition the government has encountered\nsince the introduction of modernity inspired policies from\nuniversity students has increased (Hwami & Kapoor, 2012)\nand the consequent heavy-handed reaction from the govern-\nment constitute an important aspect of the political crisis in\nnomic policy frameworks such as privatization and com-\nmodification of education as they are being implemented in\nshould be understood as government's role in spreading cap-\nitalism and attempts to change the cultures of the peasants in\nline with modernity demands. This further implies that the\ninternal colonial system developing in Zimbabwe and its\nattended devastation of the education prospects of peasantry\nchildren should be analyzed within the context of contempo-\nrary global coloniality. This implies the reproduction of colo-\nniality (relations of subordination and exploitation) at a\nglobal scale under neoliberal values and principles of educa-\nelites. The emergence and rise of the \"black bourgeoisie\"\nadoption and implementation of market reforms in all sectors\nof the country including social services shows that they are\nin collaboration with global capital. Across societies bour-\ngeois thought is viewed as modern thought (Amin, 1997, p.\n134). He further observed that\nGoverning classes generally formulate the visions and\naspirations within the perspective of really existing capitalism;\nwillingly or not, they subject their strategies to the constraints of\nglobal capitalist expansion. The state is the unilateral mouthpiece\nof the interests of transnational capital, or its subaltern comprador\nAs student narratives have illustrated, the implementation\nof modernity principles have had deleterious consequences\non their university careers and their responses have included\ndemonstrations and joining political activity with opposition\nresponse, the government has been ruthless as seen by stu-\ndent arrests and beatings, and hence widespread accusations\nthat it has become dictatorial (Raftopoulos & Mlambo; 2009;\nTendi, 2010). The authorities in Zimbabwe are aiding the\nspread of market values by use of force, further giving cre-\ndence to the internal colonial explanation of contemporary\nZimbabwe.\nBy enforcing neoliberal policies in universities, as was\nillustrated above, the biggest losers have been students from\nrural (peasant) areas who find adapting to life in the urban\nareas very difficult. Besides their concentration in disciplines\nthat will make it very difficult for them to be gainfully\nemployed, access and completion rates continue to drop\n(Students Solidarity Trust, 2009). Such cases then join the\nunemployed in cities and rural areas or the popular trend of\nexiting to neighboring countries. This system of peasant edu-\ncation and the general living conditions of the peasantry can\nsufficiently be conceptualized by utilizing internal colonial\nanalytics. It is colonial as its achievement to date is the con-\nsistent subordination of the peasantry as they are demanded\nto provide cheap labor and political support.\nConcluding Remarks\nColonialism imposed its control of the social production of\nwealth through military conquest and subsequent political\ndictatorship. But its most important area of domination was the\nmental universe of the colonised, the control through culture, of\nhow people perceived themselves and their relationship to the\nworld. Economic and political control can never be complete or\neffective without mental control. To control a people's culture is\nto control their tools of self-definition in relationship to others.\nAccording to the thesis of this article, the existence of\ncolonialism (internal) explains the unfavorable educational\ncircumstances students from the peasantry are experiencing.\nAgainst such an observation, there is need for education that\nchallenges the hegemonizing systems. In line with Ngugi wa\nThiong'o intelligent analysis captured above, the university\nor the academic community must realize the existence of\ncolonial relations in \"independent\" Zimbabwe. This has\nproved to be a daunting task for elite and mostly Western\neducated academic members. Contemporary education cur-\nriculum in Zimbabwe largely espouse a Euro-American cul-\nture, and the more educated (formal schooling) one is, the\nmore one is associated with European style of living and dis-\ntances oneself from Zimbabwean way of living (largely\npeasantry). It is therefore an established fact that higher edu-\ncation institutions are more European than African/\nZimbabwean in cultural outlook (language, official norms,\nfor example, office manners, classroom behaviors, etc.). This\nhas largely been analyzed as neo-colonial or colonial hang-\nover that was expected to end. Along this observation, A.\nPostcolonial studies are slow to come to education, in part\nbecause postcolonial studies threaten to undo education, to\nunravel the passionately held-onto thought and knowledge of\nthe modern Western-educated student and scholar. (p. 195)\nIt is disturbing to ignore the plight of the poor, that is the\npeasants, and to view the education of this group as normal,\nis equally pathetic. There is need for the academe to identify\nwith struggling peoples and hence focus research and schol-\narship toward ameliorating the suffering of ordinary citizens.\nThere should be a realization that \"that the iniquitous phe-\nnomenon of exploitation can assume a black face\" (Fanon,\n1963, p. 94). Student arrests and beatings exemplify exploi-\ntation and as Fanon further noted, \"people must learn to give\nup their simplistic perception of the oppressor\" (p. 94).\nFanon (1963) argues that there can be no authentic libera-\ntion without decolonization, whereas Dei (2010) suggests\nthat \"decolonization must be complete and must overcome\nexploitation, alienation and oppression, and dehumaniza-\ntion\" (p. xvii). This is the call the academic community is\nbeing called on to confront and further highlights the need\nfor decolonizing education, that is one that\nBrings to the fore questions of power relations among actors and\ndifferent players in the school system while at the same time\nupholding the agency, resistance and local cultural resource\nknowledge of all learners . . . is about change, it is about a\nparticular way of knowing that emerged through bodies of\ndifference, it is about embodied knowledge, it is a particular\nprocess that encounters the foreign and the local of imposition. It\nis about resistance and the fight for social justice. (Dei, 2010, p. 6)\nProgressive scholars throughout the world have been\nadvocating the use of homegrown indigenous solutions to\nmodern challenges. This article corroborates the search for\nsolutions to the crisis students from poor rural backgrounds\nare facing. The concept of unhu is a traditional Zimbabwean\nphilosophy of living in harmony with other people (Battle,\nembodies the spirit of sharing (Shizha, 2009). It is the same\nas what Scott (1976) calls the moral economy that is based\non reciprocal relationships and the right to subsistence. The\nvalues in this traditional philosophy clearly stand in opposi-\ntion to the hegemonic tenets inherent in local and global cor-\nporatism as being practiced in higher education. Thinking\nand advocating from unhu would be in line with what\nMignolo (2000) describes as \"intellectual decolonization\"\n(p. 64). The higher education community, including students\nfrom peasantry background, are failing to think beyond capi-\ntalism and intellectually, they are not thinking outside\nWestern modernity.
