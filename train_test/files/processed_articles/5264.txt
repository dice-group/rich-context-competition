The present\nstudy evaluated the association between range in blood pressure and first care-needs certification\nin the Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) system or death in community-dwelling older subjects\nwith or without CKD.\nMethods: CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or\ndipstick proteinuria of \u00fe or greater. Our study was conducted in 1078 older subjects aged 65\u00ad94\nyears. Associations were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nResults: During 5 years of follow-up, 135 first certifications and 53 deaths occurred. Among\npatients with CKD, moderate SBP (130\u00ad159 mmHg) was associated with a significantly lower\nadjusted risk of subsequent total certification (hazard ratio [HR] \u00bc 0.44) and subsequent certi-\nfication owing to dementia (HR \u00bc 0.17) compared with SBP < 130 mmHg. These relationships\nwere not observed in non-CKD subjects.\nConclusion: Lower SBP of <130 mmHg may predict a higher risk for subsequent first care-\nneeds certification in LTCI, especially for dementia, in community-dwelling patients with CKD.\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Kanazawa Medical\nUniversity, Ishikawa, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nShigeto Morimoto, Department of Geriatric Medicine,\nKanazawa Medical University, 1-1 Daigaku, Uchinada,\nEmail: shigeto@kanazawa-med.ac.jp\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\nwhich permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original\nwork is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

This is because the preva-\nlence of CKD increases with age according\nto an age-dependent decline in estimated glo-\nmerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the general\npopulation.1 The prevalence of CKD in the\nadult Japanese population was estimated to\nincrease with aging of the Japanese popula-\ntion.2 Blood pressure (BP) is often elevated\nin people with CKD, and higher BP is asso-\nciated with an increased risk of cardiovascu-\nlar events, especially in older patients\nwith CKD.3 The Japanese Society of\nHypertension Guidelines for the\nrecommend a target BP with antihyperten-\nsive treatment for older hypertensive\nThese guidelines recommend attempting to\nand for hypertensive patients with CKD, a\nattempted. These guidelines also recommend\nwhen accompanied by diabetes mellitus5,6 or\nclinical proteinuria.7 However, recent obser-\nvational cohort studies have suggested that\nthe risk of cardiovascular morbidity/mortal-\nity in patients with CKD may be increased in\nthose with systolic BP (SBP) in the lower\nrange. This relationship with increased car-\ndiovascular morbidity/mortality,8 all-cause\nlow range of SBP, including\nwith CKD. However, this pattern has not\nbeen observed in the general population.\nCKD in older people is closely related to a\ndecline in physical function14 and cognitive\nfunction.15,16 Moreover, CKD was reported\nto be an independent risk factor for care-\nneeds certification in the Long-term Care\nInsurance (LTCI) system in older Japanese\nadults.17 However, the association of a range\nin BP with care-needs certification in LTCI\nhas not been examined in community-\ndwelling older patients with CKD.\nTherefore, this study aimed to determine\nwhether a lower range in BP of <130/\n80 mmHg is a risk factor for care-needs cer-\ntification in LTCI or death among\ncommunity-dwelling older subjects by com-\nparing risk factors between those with CKD\nand without CKD (non-CKD).\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\nWe analysed cohort data of a town with a\nApril 2008, the local government provided\npublic health centre-based annual health\ncheck-ups to community-dwelling uncerti-\nfied older people aged !65 years.\nAmong 4050 older people, complete infor-\nmation from the health check-up was\nof the town during 5 years, and a total of\n1078 subjects were included in our study.\nBaseline examinations\nCKD was defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/min/\nfined as a dipstick result of \u00fe or greater for\nspot urine, corresponding to a urinary pro-\ntein level > 30 mg/dl.19 Major risk factors\nfor CKD were defined based on current na-\ntional guidelines. Hypertension was defined\ntensive agents. Diabetes mellitus was defined\nas fasting blood glucose ! 126 mg/dl, non-\nor use of hypoglycaemic agents or insulin.\nHyperuricaemia was defined as serum uric\nacid levels !7.0 mg/dl in males and\n!6.0 mg/dl in females. Dyslipidaemia was de-\nfined as fasting serum total cholesterol levels\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels\n<40 mg/dl, or use of lipid-lowering agents.\nHypoalbuminemia was defined as serum al-\nbumin levels <4 g/dl as previously reported.20\nBaseline BP was measured according to JSH\nOutcome measures\nOutcome measures were first care-needs\ncertification in LTCI by the Regional\nComprehensive Support Centre (RCSC) of\nthe local government, or death during\n5 years. The services of the LTCI program\nare provided to frail or disabled older\nadults who are certified as requiring sup-\nport or care, according to their care needs\nand the nationally standardized certifica-\ntion assessment system in Japan.17 We\nalso recorded the first disorder that required\ncertification in the primary care physician's\nstatement, and classified the causative\ndisorders into four categories of arthral-\ngia/fractures, dementia, stroke, and other\ndiseases.\nStatistical analysis\nThe study population was first divided into\nCKD and non-CKD subjects. The popula-\ntion was further classified into three groups\nof CKD and range of BP with first care-\nneeds certification in LTCI or death were\nanalysed using Kaplan\u00adMeier analysis and\nthe log-rank test. Multivariate Cox propor-\ntional hazards regression analysis was used\nto evaluate the association between the\nrange in BP and care-needs certification in\nLTCI or death. Using Cox proportional re-\ngression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio\n(HR) for each baseline BP (SBP: 130\u00ad\nCKD subjects and the 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) were estimated. Variables for\nCox regression hazard analysis were select-\ned according to the results of v2 analysis (or\nFisher's exact test when needed) for cate-\ngorical variables and Mann\u00adWhitney U\nanalysis with Bonferroni's correction for or-\ndinal variables in baseline clinical charac-\nteristics. A value of P < 0.20 was used as a\ncutoff in this analysis. Analysis was per-\nformed in all subjects, and then in sub-\ngroups of subjects stratified by age !75\nyears, male sex, receiving antihypertensive\ntreatment, diabetes mellitus, and clinical\nproteinuria. We also examined models\nusing the four classes of causative diseases\nfor care-needs certification in LTCI as out-\ncomes. Data were analysed using SPSS\n(version 22.0, Chicago, IL, USA).\nEthical considerations\nThis study was conducted in accordance\nwith the guidelines of the Declaration of\nHelsinki, and was formally approved by the\nClinical Research Ethics Committee of\nKanazawa Medical University (receipt no.\n48). We received baseline data and informa-\ntion on new care-needs certification in\nLTCI or death during the follow-up\nperiod. These data were anonymised from\nthe RCSC of the local government.\nResults\nStudy population\nsubjects, 135 were first certified as needing\nsupport/care. Fifteen subjects died after\ncare-needs certification in LTCI and 38\ndied without certification. A total of 53 sub-\njects died during the 5-year period. Subjects\nwith first care-needs certification in LTCI or\ndeath showed a significantly higher mean\nage and higher female ratio compared with\nolder residents with certification-free\nsurvival (Table 1). Age, sex, living alone, hy-\npertension, diabetes mellitus, CKD, hyper-\nuricaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, prior history\nof stroke, and prior history of heart disease\nwere associated with the risk of first care-\nneeds certification in LTCI, in total or by\nany cause, or death in univariate analyses\n(Table 1). Accordingly, these variables\nwere included as confounders in the final\nCox hazards regression model. Among the\nthese, 380 were diagnosed with CKD be-\ncause of their eGFR (range in eGFR: 22 to\nnosed with CKD because of clinical protein-\nuria, despite having an eGFR ! 60 mL/min/\n1.73 m2. Patients with CKD were associated\nwith a more advanced age, a higher BMI, a\nhigher rate of diabetes mellitus, receiving an-\ntihypertensive treatment, hyperuricaemia,\nand a history of heart disease compared\nwith non-CKD subjects (Table 2). In the\nCKD group, a lower range of SBP\nrelated to a lower rate of receiving antihy-\npertensive treatment and a higher rate of\nhistory of heart disease (Table 2).\nCare-needs certification in LTCI and death\nKaplan\u00adMeier analysis showed that the cu-\nmulative incidence of care-needs certifica-\ntion in LTCI in subjects with SBP\n<130 mmHg tended to be lower compared\ntest), but this incidence was higher in the\n(Figure 1(a)).

This finding indicates\nthat CKD is common in this population.\nSeveral previous studies have demonstrated\nan association of lower SBP with increased\ncardiovascular morbidity/mortality in\npatients with CKD.8\u00ad13 The present study\nadds evidence that comorbidity of CKD is\none of the main factors associated with an\nincrease in HR at a lower SBP of\n<130 mmHg for subsequent care-needs cer-\ntification in LTCI in Japanese older subjects.\nPrevious studies have shown that a lower\nrange in SBP is associated with an increased\nrisk of mortality, which varies with a more\nadvanced mean age in patients with CKD.\nIndeed, the risk of cardiovascular mortality\nwas increased in patients with CKD and\nSBP <110 mmHg in relatively younger\nCKD populations in the Gonryo study,\nwith a mean age of 60.0 years.8 All-cause\nmortality was increased in patients (mean\nage, 68.1 years) with CKD and SBP\n<133 mmHg in the Salem Veterans Affairs\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 2. Relation between baseline blood pressure and hazard ratio for first support/care-need certifi-\ncation (a, c) and death (b, d). Data are shown with adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals\nwith reference to subjects without chronic kidney disease with baseline systolic blood pressure of\nMedical Centre study, 9 in those (mean age,\nIndianapolis Veterans Affairs Hospital\nyears) with SBP <130 mmHg in US veter-\nans.11 Moreover, Weiss et al.12 showed a\nJ-shaped relation for a higher risk of mor-\ntality with a stepwise increase in the lower\nrange of SBP according to more advanced\nage in a cohort of older patients with CKD.\nThey found a higher risk of mortality with\naged > 80 years. The mean age of patients\nwith CKD in the present study was 74.3\nyears. Therefore, the range in SBP of\n<130 mmHg, which was associated with\nan increased risk for first care-needs certifi-\ncation in LTCI, appears to be partially\ncompatible with these previous studies.9\u00ad11\nThe Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention\nTrial (SPRINT) was a randomized, con-\ntrolled trial in subjects aged !50 years\nthat excluded those with diabetes mellitus\nor a history of stroke.21 This trial recently\ndemonstrated more beneficial effects of\nlowering SBP to a target of <120 mmHg\n(intensive treatment) on cardiovascular\nmorbidity/mortality compared with those\nwith a target of <140 mm Hg (standard\ntreatment). One of the reasons for the dis-\ncrepancy between the present study results\nand SPRINT results could be a difference in\noutcome measures. The support/care-need\ncertification is assessed based on a decline\nFigure 3. Sensitivity analysis of the association of lower baseline systolic blood pressure (<130 mmHg) and\nmoderate baseline systolic blood pressure (130\u00ad159 mmHg), or lower baseline diastolic blood pressure\n(<80 mmHg) and moderate baseline diastolic blood pressure (80\u00ad89 mmHg) with hazard ratio for first\nsupport/care-need certification, stratified by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease, in\ncommunity-dwelling older subjects aged !65 years\nData are presented with adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.\nin physical and mental functions of individ-\nual older people. Therefore, not only new\nonset of causative disorders, but also occur-\nrence of harmful adverse events by hyperten-\nsion treatment would affect the outcome. In\nfact, rates of serious adverse events, includ-\ning hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnor-\nmalities, and acute kidney injury or failure,\nwere higher in the intensive-treatment group\nthan in the standard-treatment group in the\nSPRINT.21 Findings in these previous stud-\nies and in our study suggest the importance\nof avoiding BP that is too low because a\nlower BP may relate to unexpected appear-\nance of a J-shaped relationship in high-risk\nolder populations, including older patients\nThe present study showed that the disad-\nvantageous effect of a low range in SBP of\n<130 mmHg on subsequent care-needs cer-\ntification in LTCI in patients with CKD\nwas maintained in those aged !75 years,\nand it was more prominent in men\n(Figure 4). Moreover, stratified analysis\nshowed that a low range in SBP was asso-\nciated with an increased risk of subsequent\ncertification because of dementia (Figure 3).\nThe mechanism(s) that might contribute to\nthe association of the low range of SBP and\nincreased risk of dementia in older patients\nwith CKD remains unclear. Okumiya\net al.23 reported a relationship with a signif-\nicant decline in cognitive function during\n3-year follow-up when SBP was\n<125 mmHg in community-dwelling older\nJapanese subjects. CKD is an independent\npotential risk for small vessel disease.24\nTherefore, a possible explanation for this\nFigure 4. Sensitivity analysis of the association of lower baseline systolic blood pressure (<130 mmHg)\nand moderate baseline systolic blood pressure (130\u00ad159 mmHg) with adjusted hazard ratio for first total\nsupport/care-need certification, stratified by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease in various\nsubgroups of confounding factors for cardiovascular diseases.\nassociation may be that hypoperfusion\ncaused by low BP could increase the risk\nof cerebral small vessel disease with conse-\nquent worsening of cognitive impairment.25\nIndeed, patients with vascular cognitive im-\npairment25 or vascular dementia26 are older\nand more frequently male. Another expla-\nnation for this association may be that\nolder patients with CKD and baseline SBP\n<130 mmHg might be originally at high\nrisk of Alzheimer dementia. This is because\nSBP has been reported to decline in the\nyears before the onset of Alzheimer demen-\ntia, but not vascular dementia, in\ncommunity-dwelling older subjects.27\nRecent evidence has also showed an associ-\nation of mild CKD with an increased risk of\nAlzheimer dementia, as well as an associa-\ntion of moderate to severe CKD with vas-\ncular dementia.28 The precise mechanism(s)\nresponsible for onset of dementia in the low\nrange of SBP remains to be determined.\nPrevious studies have shown an advanta-\ngeous effect of a low range in SBP of\n<130 mmHg in patients with hypertension\nand diabetes mellitus for a reduction in risk\nof stroke based on a meta-analysis of 31\nintervention trials29 and for renoprotective\noutcomes.5,6 However, the ONTARGET\nsive treatment showed a J-shaped relation-\nship for the risk of cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality, except for\nstroke.30 This study showed nadirs in SBP\nat the J-shaped relationship of 129 and\n130 mmHg in non-diabetic and diabetic hy-\npertensive patients, respectively. Our find-\nings of a J-shaped association of SBP of\n<130 mmHg for an increased risk for sub-\nsequent care-needs certification in LTCI in\nnon-diabetic CKD subjects and in patients\nCKD with and without antihypertensive\ntreatment (Figure 4) may be partly compat-\nible with the findings of the ONTARGET\nstudy.30 Kovesdy et al.9 found a J-shaped\nassociation between SBP and all-cause mor-\ntality, and the outcome was associated with\nolder age and lower proteinuria after mul-\ntivariate adjustments in veterans with\nCKD. Agarwal10 also demonstrated that\nthe J-shaped association between SBP and\nall-cause mortality was especially pro-\nnounced in patients with CKD and an\nolder age or the absence of clinical protein-\nuria. In the present study, a J-shaped asso-\nciation between the lowest range in SBP\nand an increase in risk of subsequent certi-\nfication was observed in patients with CKD\nwith and without clinical proteinuria\n(Figure 4). The reason(s) for this difference\nbetween studies should be evaluated in the\nfuture. Nevertheless, our findings suggest\nthat introduction of antihypertensive\ndrugs and treatment goals should be indi-\nvidually evaluated in older fragile patients\nwith CKD, especially in those aged !75\nyears.\nThis study has several limitations.\nFirst, we conducted a single community\nstudy. Second, we could not consider\nCKD data in the majority of\ncommunity-dwelling older people who\ndid not undergo an annual health check-\nup, and who might have a higher preva-\nlence and different subclass patterns of\nCKD and BP because of less concern\nabout their health. Third, our study had\nrelatively small numbers of patients with\nCKD and non-CKD subjects, especially\nthose with a higher SBP of !160 mmHg.\nFinally, the analyses performed in our\nstudy do not imply causation between an-\ntihypertensive drug overtreatment and an\nincreased risk of care-needs certification in\nLTCI. This is because a J-shaped relation-\nship was observed in patients with CKD\nwith and without antihypertensive treat-\nment (Figure 4). The risk of an excess\nreduction in BP on frailty or dementia\nin older hypertensive patients with CKD\nshould be examined in future, randomized\nstudies.\nIn conclusion, in older patients with\nCKD, the lower range in SBP of\n<130 mmHg may be a useful prognostic\nmarker for subsequent care-needs certifica-\ntion in LTCI, especially for dementia.\nContributors\nAll authors have reviewed the final version\nof this manuscript and approved its submis-\nsion for publication.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was partly supported by Research\nFunding for Longevity Sciences (20 A-02) from\nthe National Center for Geriatrics and\nGerontology (NCGG) Japan.\nReferences\n1.
