To achieve this, we conducted a case study of a translational research team (n = 16). Through the case\ndescription and then discussing case-based themes with community of practice theory, themes such as \"Being Open\" and\n\"Working as a Group\" found that this team's mutual respect, cooperation, and their sharing of knowledge uncovered an\nalternative way that professionals organize themselves for translational research projects. In conjunction to this finding, our\nanalysis showed that the team has qualities of a community of practice.\n",

Translational Research, through its mul-\ntidisciplinary, collaborative approach, has emerged as a way\nto speed up this process ultimately improving patient care.\nAs a result, some governments with advanced economies\nhave responded by implementing what could be described as\na translational research paradigm, a means of organizing\npeople and resources to achieve such an outcome.1 For\nexample, after much planning and negotiations, a pan-Euro-\npean consortium of 70 academic research centers of excel-\nlence have been created for translational research projects\nwith their headquarters opened in 2013, Amsterdam\n2006 translational research initiatives and opened the\nNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences\nCollaboration is fundamental to the success of transla-\ntional research, yet many professionals acknowledge there\nare difficulties. For \"collaborating with those outside the\nwalls of an institution may be more than culturally frowned\nupon, it may even be illegal [e.g., patented processes]\" and\n\"even within an institution . . . the subunits of the institution:\nits departments, its divisions, its components produce col-\nlaboration `walls'of varying substantiality\" (Bingham, 2011,\npp. xi-xii). In effect, even though translational researchers\nrealize collaboration is essential, there are problems in\nachieving this goal. We propose that this might be better\naddressed by investigating the group work that occurs in the\nfield, as collaboration is essentially about people working\njointly on a project.\nLiterature Review\nThere is a growing literature about translational researchers,\nalthough group work requires more investigation. Studies\ndraw attention to how translational research incorporates an\narray of professionals working together and across the nor-\nmative or epistemic cultures of science and medicine (Lander\n&Atkinson-Grosjean, 2011; Wainwright, Williams, Michael,\nFarsides, & Cribb, 2006).2 For example, the sociological\nresearch carried out by Wainwright et al. (2006) drew on the\nexperiences of basic scientists working on human stem cell\nresearch for diabetes in a UK research facility.They described\nhow these basic scientists maintained a wider discourse of\n1University of South Australia, Magill, Australia\n2The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville South, Australia\n3The University of Adelaide, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Campus,\nWoodville South, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nVictor J.

Porter found\nthat collaboration was a means of increasing publication out-\nputs as well as quickening the pace of the translational\nresearch process. Yet, selecting people to collaborate with\nwas at times problematic given various inconsistencies in\nbehavior, such as a researcher wanting a colleague's research\nresults, but then not reciprocating. Porter also focused on\nhow the physical space and management's best intentions of\nfacilitating collaboration may not have the desired effect on\nthe professional staff.\nResearchers have also noted and discussed the important\nroles that clinician-scientists (or physician-scientists) have to\nplay in translational research (Lander & Atkinson-Grosjean,\nand Hauskeller's (2012) research was one of the first to focus\non clinician-scientists and the role they play in the transla-\ntional research process, bringing the knowledge of both basic\nscience and medicine, which is perceived to better facilitate\nthe process.\nAn interesting study by Lander and Atkinson-Grosjean\n(2011) from an innovation system perspective theorized and\ndocumented the hidden noncommercial organizational\narrangements between hospital and university institutions,\nwhich facilitated a successful translational research process.\nThe research traced the development of a clinical application\nfrom when a sick child was presented to a pediatric clinician-\nscientist, and how professionals in both the hospital and uni-\nversity laboratories worked together to create a diagnostic\ntest.\nMorgan and colleagues (2011) conducted a pilot study\ninstigated by the United Kingdom's Medical Research\nCouncil, where a Research Translator was employed to stim-\nulate a translational research culture between professionals\nat a teaching and research hospital. Much of the study cen-\ntered on how basic scientists and clinician-scientists\nresponded to the translational research change agent. The\nstudy also provided details about the understandings of trans-\nlational research by particular actors, namely, the Research\nTranslator, basic scientists, and clinician-scientists, along\nwith details about how a panel assessed the translatability of\nresearch.\nSocial research has made inroads into understanding\ntranslational research. However, few studies investigate the\ninteractions between professionals working in translational\nresearch groups, particularly at the stage of their develop-\nment. For the most part, there is a technocratic mood to cur-\nrent research, where there is a limited sustained description\non the collective lived experience of being in translational\nresearch teams.\nResearch Aim and Question\nA novel way of investigating the collective lived experience\nof translational research teams is to return to thinking about\nthe importance of collaboration as tied to learning in prac-\ntice. Collaboration, particularly when professionals identify\nas coming from different professional cultures and/or disci-\nplines, means that professionals need to learn in practice\nfrom one another to achieve their common goals (cf. Oborn\n& Dawson, 2011, on multidisciplinary health teams learning\nto work together). This type of learning is not entirely an\napprenticeship of sorts (see Lave & Wenger, 1991) but a\nmode of learning that happens within some type of \"organi-\nzational imagination\"-- whether participants are fully cog-\ntranslational research is only possible in highly sophisti-\ncated and globally connected organizational spheres, the\ntype of learning being discussed here is the Wengerian con-\nception of \"communities of practice.\" This is a social theory\nof learning that is grounded in organizational life, even\nthough it may stretch beyond the immediate organizational\nenvironment.\nIt has been found that in translational research work, \"the\nscientific and the clinical are embodied in different commu-\nnities of practice with distinct cultures and practices\" (Cribb,\nwhich suggests that collaboration is a challenging process\nbetween professionals located on different sides of this\ndivide. Yet, usage of the term communities of practice in\nCribb et al. (2008) is more akin to viewing different profes-\nsional identities in translational research as belonging to\nrespective communities of practice. A similar idea can also\nbe found in Oborn and Dawson's (2011) work albeit about\nprofessional identities in health care. We are now asking\nwhether a self-identified translational research team (com-\nposed of people from both the scientific and medical spheres)\nconstitutes a community of practice within an organization\nthat intended to foster translational research. Our research\ndirective is enveloped within the overarching aim of describ-\ning the collective lived experience of being in a translational\nresearch team in a specific organizational context.\nWe believe that such an approach is warranted as much\nopinion and policy, along with social and organizational the-\nory deployed on translational researchers, is designed to\nenhance organizational performance in terms of outputs,\nwhich treats the humans who work in this field as a mere\n(albeit important) resource. We borrow the critical manage-\nment studies seminal concept of \"(non) performative intent\"\nas a means of counteracting \"the intent to develop and cele-\nbrate knowledge which contributes to the production of max-\nimum output for minimum input; it involves inscribing\nknowledge with a means-ends calculation\" (Fournier &\ndescribing the collaboration between the professionals and\npresenting their voices--particularly at the group develop-\nment stage--to simply discover what can be found there.\nKrawczyk et al. 3\nDesign\nTheoretical Perspective and Method\nAn interpretive perspective was used in this research, as\nthere was a focus on describing the collective lived experi-\nences of the members of the team in their organizational con-\ntext. This was realized by way of an intrinsic case study\nbecause \"we are interested in it [the case], not because by\nstudying it we learn about other cases or about some general\nproblem, but because we need to learn about a particular\nFirst, we describe and contextualize the team members\nand case study sample, within their organizational setting,\nthat is, the biomedical research team working in anAustralian\nmedical research institute. Such context is articulated through\na Case Description that is intended to state the \"facts\" in a\nnarrative-like manner (Creswell, 2007). Against this back-\nground, the Case-Based Themes (Creswell, 2007) are then\npresented with a discussion on whether the group could be\nconsidered a community of practice. Table 1 provides a sum-\nmary of the case-based themes with their respective sub-\nthemes. The article ends with a final conclusion and\nsuggestions for further research.\nCase Sample Selection\nThe main reason this research team was selected is that they\nhad only recently formed a group, so there was an opportu-\nnity to research how they organized themselves. Another rea-\nson in selecting this particular case was that translational\nresearch was not yet a governmental priority in Australia at\nthe time. In 2009, the federal government issued Powering\nIdeas: An Innovation Agenda for the 21st Century. It outlines\nthe 10-year reform agenda for Australia's knowledge-based\nindustries to address \"the country's long-term weakness in\nbusiness innovation, and in collaboration between research\nand industry\" (Commonwealth of Australia, 2009, p. 4).\nThere is no specific mention about translational research,\nalthough collaboration is emphasized. In 2011, as this project\nconcluded, the government established the Therapeutic\nInnovation Australia organization, designed in part to better\ncoordinate translational infrastructure and provide support to\ntranslational researchers by integrating the academic, indus-\ntry, and public spheres (McKinnon, 2011).3 Our case then\nprovided us with an opportunity to view the emergence of a\ntranslational research team within an organization without\nthe comparable government support found in other advanced\neconomies.\nMethod\nFollowing university and hospital ethics approval, 16\nresearchers of an initially 22-member translational research\nteam (referred to in this article as The Team), agreed to share\ntheir experiences of working together on a translational\nresearch project.\nMultiple methods of data collection were deployed by\nthe primary researcher (first author), including participant\nobservation between May and August 2009; document col-\nlection, which related to The Team, such as their successful\nfunding application; and general documents broadly circu-\nlated within the organization such a newsletters and emails.\nNear the end of the participant observation phase, two focus\ngroups were also conducted with many questions themed by\nthe idea of collaboration. The first lasted an hour with six\nparticipants and the second ran for 45 min with five partici-\npants. A list of data sets collected from the methods is pro-\nvided in Table 2.\nData Analysis, Co-Researchers, and Participant\nChecks\nAll data collected were instrumental in developing the case\ndescription through categorical aggregation and direct\nTable 1.

Transcriptions of focus groups\n4 SAGE Open\ninterpretation (Stake, 1995). The transcripts from the focus\ngroups were considered to be a significant data set of the\ncorpus, as there was much discussion on the group work of\nThe Team. The transcripts from the focus groups were\ntherefore subjected to further analysis that sought to iden-\ntify salient case-based themes through the process of tem-\nplate analysis (King, 2006). Confidentiality of participants\nwas ensured with interviewee talk de-identified from each\nparticipant in the transcripts. The process of template anal-\nysis was conducted by the primary researcher and a co-\nresearcher (second author), who was also a participant in\nthe study. She was able to draw on her considerable practi-\ntioner knowledge as a medical scientist (see Benington &\nHartley, 2006, on co-research methodology in organiza-\ntions). This was balanced with wider input through a vali-\ndation meeting held in February 2010, where five members\nof The Team came together to assess whether the case-\nbased themes generated during data analysis reflected what\nThe Team had intended to convey (see Shenton, 2004, on\nmember checks for research credibility). Then, a full write-\nup of the research by the primary researcher (first author),\nusing pseudonyms for each participant to ensure their ano-\nnymity, was read by a clinician-scientist (third author) as\nanother participant check. He too was a participant in the\nstudy and another co-researcher. Given his extensive expe-\nrience in clinical medicine, along with medical, basic sci-\nence, and translational research, he was asked to provide\nfeedback on whether the primary researcher (first author)\nwas able to effectively describe the lived experience of\nbeing in The Team within this specific organizational\ncontext.\nCase Description\nOrganizational Milieu\nThe Team was located within a biomedical research insti-\ntute in Australia that, among other things, investigates the\ncauses and prevention of health conditions for humans,\nincluding diseases such as cancer, arthritis, and stroke. As\nthe institute's promotional material explained, the organi-\nzation is the \"productive research arm\" of a public teaching\nhospital and aims to create a \"dynamic environment in\nwhich research and research training opportunities are\npursued.\"\nIn 2009, the research institute relocated its staff to a new\npurposely built building and rebranded itself as a transla-\ntional research facility, as this expression was believed to\ncapture the core work. Many researchers were aware of the\ndevelopments of translational research across the world and\nsought to implement it within their projects and various\ndepartments. However, not all researchers were convinced\nthat translational research was anything new, believing that\nthey and others in the scientific community had been carry-\ning out such collaborative work for years.4\nKey Facts About the Research Team\nIt was within this organizational milieu that The Team started\nwork on their projects with funding for 3 years. However, the\ncatalyst for their interactions came in 2008 when a benevo-\nlent foundation, with a strong history of supporting the\nresearch institute, offered to fund projects that were designed\nto encourage professionals from different research special-\nties and conventional research groupings to collaborate\nwithin the new facility. The Team was formed with profes-\nsionals from four established public teaching hospital depart-\nments that also have a presence in the research institute: the\nDepartment of Otolaryngology/ENT (Ears, Nose, and\nThroat), the Discipline of Medicine, the Rheumatology Unit\nand the Neurology Unit.\nDuring group formation, The Team believed it was impor-\ntant to establish a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" between\nits members. The document was intended to set up an ethical\ncollaboration, as some members felt they had not been\ntreated respectfully in previous research teams in which they\nhad worked.5 For example, some members believed their\ncontributions to previous projects were not recognized in\nterms of authorship. Another member said they had been irri-\ntated previously by certain researchers in the mind of \"using\nother people to just get what you want.\" This meant people\nhad contributed their knowledge and skills on a project with\nlittle "
