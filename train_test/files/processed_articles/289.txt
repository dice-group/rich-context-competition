    "abstract": "Abstract: Weighted survey data with missing data for some covariates\npresents a substantial challenge for analysis. We addressed this problem\nby using a reweighting technique in a logistic regression model to\nestimate parameters. Each survey weight was adjusted by the inverse of\nthe probability that the possibly missing covariate was observed. The\nreweighted estimating equations procedure was compared with a com-\nplete case analysis (after discarding any subjects with missing data) in\na simulation study to assess bias reduction. The method was also\napplied to data obtained from a national health survey (National Health\nand Nutritional Examination Survey or NHANES). Adjusting the sam-\npling weights by the inverse probability of being completely observed\nappears to be effective in accounting for missing data and reducing the bias\nof the complete case estimate of the regression coefficients.\nComplex survey sampling is widely used for estimation of\npopulation characteristics. Because of their complex sam-\npling frame, analyses should be design based and incorporate\nweighting, stratification, and clustering variables. Here, we con-\nsider missing data on a covariate in complex surveys, and describe\na reweighting technique for estimating logistic regression parame-\nters. We illustrate the technique on weight loss data from a complex\nsurvey, and assess potential bias reduction via a simulation study.\nMotivating Example\nThe motivating example is from the third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics1,2 to provide national\nestimates of the health and nutritional status of the US popula-\ntion. NHANES III used stratified, multistage sampling, in which\nstudy participants have different probabilities of being sampled.\nSpecifically, the United States was stratified into 47 geographic\nregions (mainly states) and within each strata, 2 counties were\nsampled with probability proportional to the size of the county.\nWithin each county, households were randomly selected and an\naverage of 1.6 household members was chosen. Young children,\nolder persons (65 years and older), Blacks, and Hispanics (Mex-\nican origin) were all oversampled. For generalizability to the\npopulation, both the design and the probability of being selected\ninto the sample must be incorporated into the analysis.\nWhen analyzing data from NHANES III, each partici-\npant is given a weight proportional to the inverse of the\nprobability of being selected into the sample (the \"weight\"\nequals the inverse probability of being selected multiplied by\na constant so that the sum of the weights equals the size of the\npopulation). For example, the sample survey weights of the\nthe US population at the time.\nMissing data occur often in sample surveys and arise in 2\nforms: unit nonresponse, in which the whole survey is left\nunanswered, and item nonresponse, in which an individual does\nnot answer a specific item on a questionnaire. In NHANES III,\n14% of the households did not respond to the survey interview.\nAn adjustment to the weights for this household unit nonresponse\nwas provided in the NHANES III database. As described by\nMohadjer et al,3 households that respond are reweighted so that\ntheir weights sum to the total weights of the respondents and\nnonrespondents in that county.4 We focused on item nonresponse,\nwhere the possibly missing \"item\" was a covariate of interest.\nMETHODS\nTo illustrate the bias resulting from item nonresponse\nand evaluate a technique to reduce such bias, we analyzed\nFrom the aDepartment of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA;\nbDivision of General Internal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital,\nBoston, MA; cDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Norman J.\nArnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia,\nSC; and dDivision of General Internal Medicine, New York University\nSchool of Medicine, New York, NY.\nSupported by the following grants from the US National Institutes of Health:\nfrom the US Department of Veterans Affairs.\nEditors' Note: A commentary on this article appears on page 391.\nCorrespondence: Sundar Natarajan, New York University School of Medicine, 423\nE 23rd Street, New York, NY 10010.

The binary\noutcome of interest is the study participant's response to:\nHave you tried to lose weight in past 12 months? The\ncovariates of interest are age, sex, ethnicity, education, body\nmass index, poverty income ratio, healthcare visit within the\nlast 2 years (yes or no), family history of heart disease, health-\ncare visit in the last 2 years (yes or no), and self-reported\ncholesterol (high or normal). All 16,686 participants had the\noutcome and all covariate information fully recorded, except\n\"self-reported cholesterol.\" The 8002 subjects (48%) with miss-\ning self-reported cholesterol data represent 42% of the total\npopulation. With such a large fraction of missing data, a com-\nplete case logistic regression analysis (using only the subjects\nwith no missing data) could give highly biased estimates.\nWe consider 2 possible missing data processes. The\nfirst, referred to as missing completely at random (MCAR),\nmeans that the probability the covariate (self-reported cho-\nlesterol) is missing does not depend on any data values,\nincluding the possibly missing value of the covariate, the\noutcome value, or the values of the other covariates. The\nsecond process, referred to as missing at random (MAR),\nmeans that the probability that the covariate is missing can\ndepend on the observed value of the outcome or the values of\nother covariates, but cannot depend on the possibly missing\nvalue of the covariate itself. Under MAR, subjects who report\nthat they have not tried to lose weight during the last 12\nmonths may be less health conscious, and thus less likely to\nknow their cholesterol level. Furthermore, under MAR, we\nmight expect subjects above the poverty threshold, with more\neducation, with a healthcare visit within the last 2 years, and\nwith a family history of heart disease, to be more likely to\nhave cholesterol recorded. Although not considered here, the\nmissing data process is sometimes \"nonignorable,\" implying\nthat the probability that the covariate is missing depends on\nthe possibly missing value of the covariate, even after adjust-\ning for the observed values of the outcome and other covari-\nates. In general, a complete case regression analysis can give\nbiased estimates unless the missing data are MCAR.\nIn simple random sampling from an infinite population,\nweighted estimating equations5 have been proposed to ana-\nlyze data with missing covariate values. With weighted esti-\nmating equations, the contribution to the estimating equation\nfrom a complete case is weighted by the inverse probability\nof being observed. In simple random sampling, weighted\nestimating equations are applicable to regression analyses\nwhen missing covariates are either MAR or MCAR.6 To use\nweighted estimating equations, one must estimate a binary\n(eg, logistic) regression model for the probability of a covari-\nate value being observed as a function of the outcome and\nother covariates, and then weight each subject by the inverse\nof this estimated probability. Note that when estimating\nregression coefficients with sample survey data without any\nmissingness, one also uses weighted estimating equations,7\nweighted by the sample survey weight. To reduce the poten-\ntial bias of the complete case logistic regression estimator, we\napply the weighted estimating equations approach to complex\nsample survey data.\nWe propose a reweighted estimating equation in which\nthe contribution to the estimating equation from the complete\ncases is weighted by the inverse of the joint probability of\nbeing selected into the sample survey and having no covariate\ndata missing. These weights are the product of the original\nfixed sampling weights and the inverse of the predicted\nprobability of having the covariate value observed. Because\nthe NHANES III \"weights\" have already been reweighted for\nunit (household) nonresponse, applying the Robins et al5\napproach to handle item nonresponse is, in some sense, an\nextension of methods already widely used in the sample\nsurvey literature. Below, we apply the weighted estimating\nequations approach to the 2 sampling scenarios.\nSample Surveys With No Missing Data\nSuppose the finite population consists of i  1, . . ., N\nsubjects. We choose n subjects from this population with the\nsampling design being multistage, and each subject having a\ndifferent probability (or weight) of being selected into the\nsample.\nWe are interested in estimating the population regression\nof the outcome variable Yi\nversus the covariate vector xi\n,\n, . . . ., xiK\n) and another covariate zi\n(the possibly missing\ncovariate). We consider Yi\nas a random observation from the\npopulation, and let \ni\n EYi\nxi\n, zi\n denote the mean of Yi\ngiven\n(Xi\n, Zi\n). We want to estimate the regression coefficients  \n(\n, \nx\n, \nz\n) from the regression model \ni\n\n \nx\nxi\n \nz\nzi\n\n g\n \nx\nxi\n \nz\nzi\n, where \nand \nz\nare scalars, \nx\nis a (Kx1)\nvector, and g(.) is a known function. For logistic regression,\n\ni\n\n \nx\nxi\n \nz\nzi\n \nexp\n \nx\nxi\n \nz\nzi\n\n \nx\nxi\n \nz\nzi\n.\nTo indicate which n subjects are sampled from the pop-\nulation of N subjects, we define the indicator random variable\n\ni\n\n{1 if selected into the sample\n0 if not selected into the sample\nfor i  1, . . ., N, where \nil\nN\n\ni\nn. Depending on the sampling\ndesign, some of the \ni\ns could be correlated (eg, for 2 subjects\nwithin the same cluster). Further, we define pi\n pr(\ni\n,\nxi\n, zi\n, si\n) as the probability of being selected, where si\nare\nadditional variables (in addition to the outcome and covari-\nates of interest) used in the sampling scheme. In general, the\nselection probability (pi\n) may depend on the outcome (yi\n), the\npredictor variables (xi\n), or additional variables si\n(eg, screen-\ning variables) that would not ordinarily be included in the\nregression model. In NHANES III, subjects were selected\nbased on age and race, both covariates of interest (contained\nin xi\n); however, subjects were also over- or undersampled\nEpidemiology \u00b7 Volume 20, Number 3, May 2009 Logistic Regression With Incomplete Covariate Data\nbased on characteristics of the county of residence (subjects\nin counties in which census data showed a higher proportion\nof Blacks, Hispanics, or older residents were oversampled).\nThese county characteristics are the variables in si\n. However,\nfor many NCHS complex sample surveys (including the\nNational Health Interview Survey, Medical Expenditure\nPanel Survey, Health Examination Survey), si\nis not con-\ntained in the downloadable dataset.\nWhen estimating regression parameters with sample\nsurvey data, one must consider the sampling design. In\nparticular, Shah7 proposed weighting each subject by the\ninverse probability of being selected. With no missing data,\none can use the following weighted logistic regression equa-\ntions8 to estimate   \n, \nx\n , \nz\n:\n\nil\nN \ni\npi\nxi\nzi\nyi\n \ni\n\n \nx\n xi\n \nz\nzi\nwhere \ni\n \ni\n\n \nx\n xi\n \nz\nzi\n is the probability that\nyi\n 1. Note that each subject is weighted by wi\n\n\ni\npi\n(the\ninverse probability of being selected  the sampling indica-\ntor). Subjects who are oversampled (eg, larger pi\n) are down-\nweighted in (1), so that the resulting estimator of  is\nreflective of the population from which the sample was\ndrawn. Using this line of reasoning, Binder9 showed that the\nestimate of  from (1) has an approximate normal distribution\nwith mean  and covariance matrix.\n\nil\nN \ni\npi\nxi\nzi\nxi\nzi\n\n\ni\ni\n\n\n\nN\nE\n\ni\npi\nxi\nzi\nxi\nzi\n\nyi\n \ni\n\n\nN\n\ni\npi\nxi\nzi\nxi\nzi\n\n\ni\ni\n\n\nwhere the expectation depends on the sampling scheme. One\ncan estimate (2) by replacing \ni\nwith \n^ i\nto obtain the\nso-called sandwich variance estimate for sample survey data,\nsuch as that given in SUDAAN7 or SAS Proc SurveyLogistic.\nIf subjects are over- or undersampled based solely on\nthe values of the covariates xi\nin the model, then the un-\nweighted logistic regression equations (giving all individuals\nthe same weight wi\nalthough (2) is needed to estimate the variance if the design\nis multistage. Further, if the sampling depended on additional\nvariables si\n, these additional variables can be added to the\nlogistic regression model, say\n\ni\n\n*  \nx\n*xi\n \nz\n*zi\n \ns\nsi\n\n\nexp(\n*  \nx\n*xi\n \nz\n*zi\n  \ns\nsi\n)\n*  \nx\n*xi\n \nz\n*zi\n  \ns\nsi\n)\n.\nUnfortunately, the estimate of * from this model will\nbe biased for the  of interest if si\nis a confounder for the\nassociation between Yi\nand covariates (xi\n, zi\n). Further, the\nadditional variables si\nare often not available, as with\nthe NHANES III dataset.\nSample Surveys With Missing Covariate Data\nNext, we apply the weighted estimating equations ap-\nproach to complex sample surveys with missing covariate\ndata. Recall that zi\nis the covariate that can be missing. An\nintegral part of the Robins et al5 approach is formulating a\nlogistic regression model for the probability that zi\nis ob-\nserved as a function of Yi\n, the observed covariates xi\nand the\npossibly missing covariate zi\n. In particular, we define a binary\nrandom variable Ri\n, where Ri\nis observed, and Ri\n\nis not observed, i  1, . . ., N. Then, we formulate a\nlogistic regression model for \ni\n Pr(Ri\n, xi\n, zi\n). This\nprobability \ni\nis often called the missing data mechanism. In\nterms of logistic regression models, with parameters , we\ncan write the 2 missing data mechanisms as shown below\n(assuming all effects are additive):\nMCAR: logitpr(Ri\n, xi\n, zi\n)  \nMAR: logitpr(Ri\n, xi\n, zi\n)  \n \ny\nyi\n \nx\nxi\nWe focus on MAR mechanisms for missing data, and\nnote that a more general MAR model can include interactions\namong the elements of (yi\n, xi\n), as well as powers of the\nelements of (yi\n, xi\n).\nFor the discussion in this paragraph, suppose the pa-\nrameters (\n, \ny\n, \nx\n) in\nlogitpr(Ri\n, xi\n, zi\n)  logit(\ni\n)  \n \ny\nyi\n \nx\nxi\nare known. In our proposed reweighted estimating equation,\nwe replace\n\ni\npi\nin (1) with\nRi\n\ni\n\ni\npi\n. In particular, subjects who are\nselected in the original sample (\ni\n 1) and selected thro-\nugh the missing data mechanism to have zi\nobserved\n(Ri\n 1) are weighted by the inverse probability (pi\n) of being\nselected in the original sample  the inverse probability (\ni\n)\nof having zi\nobserved:\n\nN Ri\n\ni\n\ni\npi\nxi\nzi\nyi\n \ni\n\n \nx\n xi\n \nz\nzi\nHere, subjects who are oversampled (eg, larger pi\n) and\nwho are more likely to have zi\nobserved (eg, larger \ni\n) are\ndown-weighted, so that the resulting estimator of  is reflec-\ntive of both the population from which the sample was drawn\nand the missing data mechanism. The results of Binder9 can\nagain be used to show that the estimate of  from setting (3)\nto 0 has an approximate normal distribution with mean  and\ncovariance matrix similar to (2), except that\n\ni\npi\nis replaced\nwith\nRi\n\ni\n\ni\npi\n. Note that the denominator of Ri\n\ni\nin (3) is the joint\nprobability that Ri\ni\n 1, given the values of (xi\n, yi\n,\nzi\n, si\n) under the assumption\npr\ni\n, yi\n, zi\n, si\n\n pr\ni\n, yi\n, zi\n, si\nRi\n, xi\n, zi\n, si\n\n pr\ni\n, yi\n, zi\n, si\nprRi\n, xi\n  pi\n\ni\n.\nThe latter line results from the fact that the probability\nof being selected in the original sample (\ni\n 1) is only a\nfunction of (xi\n, yi\n, zi\n, si\n) and not the missingness indicator Ri\n.\nFurther, we assume that the missing data mechanism pr(Ri\n\n, xi\n, zi\n, si\n) does not depend on the possibly missing zi\n(the\nMAR assumption), nor si\n(the additional variables used in the\nsampling scheme). If the si\nwere available, one could also\ninclude them as covariates in the model for \ni\n.\nThe default estimate in any complex sample survey\npackage, the complete case analysis, is obtained by discard-\ning all information of any subjects with missing zi\n. The\ncomplete case estimate is obtained by using weighted esti-\nmating equations similar to (3), except that \ni\nis removed\nfrom the denominator of the weights,\n\nN Ri\n\ni\npi\nxi\nzi\nyi\n \ni\n\n \nx\n xi\n \nz\nzi\n.\nUnder MAR, the weights are no longer correct because\nwe are not down-weighting subjects who are more likely to\nhave zi\nobserved (eg, larger \ni\n); the resulting estimator of \ncould be biased.\nIn practice, the parameters  in the model for \ni\nare\nrarely known. However, if we replace  with a consistent\nestimate, the resulting estimator of  will still be consistent\n(Zhao and Lipsitz6). Suppose, we pose the following MAR\nmissing data model\nlogitpr(Ri\n, xi\n, zi\n)  logit(\ni\n)  \n \ny\nyi\n \nx\nxi\n.\nWe note here that \ni\nis the population probability that\nzi\nis observed, given (xi\n, yi\n). We estimate the population\nprobability \ni\nby using weighted logistic regression, estimat-\ning equations with outcome Ri\nand covariates (xi\n, yi\n) and\nweights\n\ni\npi\n. In particular, even though Ri\nand the covariates\n(xi\n, yi\n) contain no missing components, they were obtained\nfrom the complex survey design, which must be accounted\nfor when estimating the population probability \ni\n. The\nweighted estimating equations for  are similar to (1), with\nthe estimate \n^ obtained by setting the below equation to 0.\n\nN \ni\npi\nxi\nzi\nri\n \ni\nOnce \n^ is obtained from (4), \n^ i\nis calculated and placed\nin the weights\nRi\n\ni\n\n^ i\npi\nin (3); (3) is then solved for \n^. To\nestimate the variance of \n^, one uses (2) after replacing\n\ni\npi\nwith\nRi\n\ni\n\n^ i\npi\n. Note that, even though \n^ i\nis an estimate, and not the true\nvalue, Robins et al12 show that it is valid to use the estimate\nin both the estimating equations for , as well as the sand-\nwich estimate of its variance. However, \n^ i\nmust be obtained\nfrom a correctly specified model for \ni\n. In particular, a\ncorrectly specified regression model for \ni\nis crucial for the\nresulting estimator of  from (3) to have minimal bias. As\nTABLE 1.

Thus, we\nsuggest keeping any parameter in the model for \ni\nthat is\nsignificant at P  0.20. We regarded the main effects model\nin xi\nand yi\nas the baseline model for \ni\n, and considered\npairwise interactions in a step-up approach; no interactions\nwere significant at the 0.20 level. The best fitting model for \ni\ncontained yi\n, age, sex, race, education, healthcare visit, body\nmass index, poverty income ratio, and history of heart dis-\nease. The results are shown in Table 1.\nTable 2 gives estimates and standard errors for the\nregression coefficients based on reweighted estimating equa-\ntions and complete case estimation (Table 3 gives the SAS\nprogramming commands to obtain the estimates in Table 2).\nFrom Table 2 we see striking differences between complete\ncase and reweighted estimating equations for 2 covariates.\nFor the effect in the age group of 50\u00ad64 years, complete case\nis significant at   0.05 level, whereas reweighted estimat-\ning equations is not. Hispanic race effect is not significant\nusing complete case, but is significant at   0.05 level,\nusing reweighted estimating equations. To explore the differ-\nences between the 2 methods, in the following section, we\nconducted a simulation study comparing the 2 approaches.\nSimulation Study\nWe conducted a simulation study to investigate the\nperformance of RWEE procedures compared with complete\ncase analysis in the presence of complex survey sampling and\nmissing covariate data. Data were generated using stratified\nrandom sampling as the type of complex survey sampling.\nFor each scenario, a finite population consisting of 3 strata is\n500. One thousand data sets were sampled from the finite\npopulation. Each sampled data set contained observations\ndrawn independently from the finite population strata with\noutcome Yi\n, the fully observed covariate Xi\n, and the possibly\nmissing covariate Zi\n, all be binary. We formulated the true\nmodel by specifying each probability on the right side of\nprri\n, yi\n, xi\n,zi\n)  pr(ri\nyi\n, xi\n, zi\n)pr(zi\nxi\n)pr(xi\n).\nFirst, we specified pr(xi\n) by letting the prevalence of Xi\n,\npr(Xi\nBecause Yi\n, Zi\n, and Ri\nare all binary, 3 logistic models were\nused to generate the simulated data:\n1) logitpr(Yi\n, zi\n)  \n \nx\nxi\n \nz\nzi\n;\n2) logitpr(zi\n)  \n \nx\nxi\n;\n3) logitpr(Ri\n, xi\n, zi\n)  \n \ny\nyi\n \nx\nxi\n \nxy\nxi\nyi\n.\nData were originally generated from 27 configurations,\ncorresponding to different values of s, s, and s.

For each,\n2 missingness models were explored; the first with \ni\n, de-\npending on X and Y and the second with \ni\ndepending\nadditionally on X and Y and their interaction. The correspond-\nmissing covariate information is about 30% in both scenarios.\nThese 2 missingness mechanisms allowed us to explore\noverspecification, underspecification, and correct specifica-\nTABLE 3.

For the true model for \ni\ncontaining only X and Y, we fit the models containing (1) X\nand Y, (2) X, Y, and the interaction, (3) X only, and (4) Y only.\nFor the situations in which the true missing data mechanism\ncontains X and Y and their interaction, we fit 2 models (1) X\nand Y, (2) X, Y, and X  Y.

With 1000 replications, these estimated coverage\nprobabilities should be contained in the interval (0.937\u00ad\nTables 4 and 5 present the true and fitted models for R\ngiven its predictors are denoted by (Rpredictors). In Tables 4\nand 5, when correctly specifying or overspecifying the miss-\ningness mechanism, the reweighted estimating equations\nmethod is unbiased and shows good coverage probabilities\nfor \n,\nx\n, and \nz\n. For all missing data models, there was very\nlittle bias in the complete case estimate of \nz\n, but the\ncomplete case estimates of \nand \nx\nwas generally biased.\nWhen the true missing data model is RX, Y (with no inter-\naction), the complete case estimates of \nx\nare underestimating\nthe true parameter. When the true missing data model is RX,\nY, but we underspecify by fitting RX or RY, the results using\nreweighted estimating equations are similar to complete case\nfor \nand \nx\n. Using reweighted estimating equations, under-\nspecification of the missing data model when the true model\nis RX, Y, X  Y can also lead to bias for estimation of \nand\n\nx\n, but not \nz\n. In general, with respect to bias, it appears that\nthe reweighted estimating equations perform similar to com-\nplete case when the missingness model is underspecified, but\noutperforms complete case when the missingness model is\ncorrectly specified or overspecified.\nDISCUSSION\nWe compared a complete case analysis to an analysis\nthat used reweighted estimating equations with complex sur-\nvey data. Our empirical example and simulation study both\nused logistic regression. In the NHANES example, with 9\ncovariates, 1 of which is missing for 48% of the subjects, we\nfound striking differences between complete case and re-\nweighted estimating equations for 2 covariates. In the simu-\nlations, adjusting the sampling weights with the inverse\nprobability of zi\nbeing observed appears to be effective for\nobtaining unbiased estimates of the regression coefficients\nwhen we correctly specified the missing-data model.\nTABLE 4. Simulation Results for Moderate Association for ZX\nTrue Missingness Model Fit Missingness Model \nx\nz\nAverage of estimates\nCoverage probability\nThe simulation study also showed the importance of\ncorrectly specifying the missing-data model when using re-\nweighted estimating equations. In particular, a correctly spec-\nified logistic regression model for \ni\nis crucial for the re-\nweighted estimating equations of  to have minimal bias. As\nsuch, we suggest being liberal when including variables to\npredict the probability of observing zi\n.\nWe note that Robins et al5 have proposed ways to modify\ntheir weighted estimating equations to gain more efficiency.\nHowever, the type of sample surveys we discuss here are\ntypically so large that efficiency is not of that great concern as it\nmight be in other settings. The main issue here is to obtain\nestimates with missing data that have minimal bias. Robins and\nRitov14 have also proposed weighted estimating equations that\nare more robust to misspecification of the missing data model,\nthe so-called doubly robust estimating equations, which could be\nmodified for use with sample survey data. We note that doubly\nrobust estimates require much additional programming, whereas\nthe method we have proposed can easily be implemented in any\nsample survey package such as SAS Proc SurveyLogistic, as\nshown in Table 3.\nWith a single covariate subject to missingness, the idea\nof reweighted estimating equations is a simple one and\nmodifying the sampling weights does not complicate the\nmethod considerably. However, even in simple random sam-\npling, the weights and standard errors can become complex if\nmore than 1 covariate is missing.15 The extension of the\nweighted estimating equations to arbitrary missing covariate\ndata patterns entails creating missing data indicators for each\ncovariate, and becomes much more cumbersome. However,\nin this case, one can combine our approach with that of\nRotnitzky et al16 for arbitrary missing covariate data patterns\nin simple random sample. In particular, we would replace \ni\nwith \ni\nmultiplied by each missing data indicator and pi\nwith\npi\nmultiplied by each missing data probability.\nREFERENCES\n1.
