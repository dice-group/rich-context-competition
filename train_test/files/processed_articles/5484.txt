We conducted a content analysis of a statewide database of CIPH\nperpetrators. The most frequently reported CIPH decedent was the focal victim's new partner (30%); 45% of focal victims\nwere themselves killed. News reports framed CIPH as the unexpected result of interpersonal conflict, despite evidence of a\nsystematic pattern of coercion and violence that capitulated in murder.\n",

Intimate partner homicide\n(IPH) is regarded as the most severe outcome of IPV (Garcia,\nSoria, & Hurwitz, 2007); however, there is a paucity of\nresearch exploring cases of IPH in which persons other than\nthe primary intimate partner, or focal victim, are killed.\nFor the purposes of this study, collateral intimate partner\nhomicide (CIPH) is defined as the killing of individuals\nexogenous to an intimate dyad--including one's children,\nparents, siblings, friends, or new intimate partner. Previous\nresearch has indicated the risk of death for child witnesses of\nIPV (Jaffe & Juodis, 2006), but CIPH is broader in nature.\nCollateral victims may include individuals not biologically\nrelated to the focal victim or perpetrator.\nTo better understand this phenomenon, we extracted a\nsubset of CIPH news reports from a larger database of IPHs\nand conducted an analysis of characteristics associated with\nthe crime. The goals of this study are twofold: (a) to identify\ncommon perpetrator and victim characteristics and (b) to\nsituate journalistic explanations for CIPH in extant violence\nagainst women (VAW) theory, namely, feminist and family\nviolence theoretical frameworks. Next we review the litera-\nture on the utility of newspaper stories for social research,\nexplain the concept of news frames, and highlight deficien-\ncies in news media coverage of IPV and IPH.\nLiterature Review:\nNews Media Framing\nNews frames provide a structure for crime reporting and\nserve as a consistent social construction template for audi-\nences (Surette, 2010). Frames \"organize the world for both\njournalists who report it and, in some important degree, for\nus who rely on their reports\" (Gitlin, 1980, p. 7). Framing is\noften described as the way in which media content is shaped\nand contextualized according to some familiar point of refer-\nence or latent structure of meaning, which in turn simplifies\nthe world by organizing experiences according to categories\nand labels (Surette, 2010). It is the typical manner in which\njournalists shape news content, and subsequently, how the\naudience adopts these frames and sees the world in a way\nsimilar to journalists and their informants (McQuail, 2005;\nframe organizes everyday reality, and the news frame is a\nparcel of everyday reality . . .

Therefore, framing\nconsists of selection and salience in that frames \"define prob-\nlems,\" \"diagnose causes,\" \"make moral judgments,\" and\n\"suggest remedies.\" This particular conceptualization is\nespecially useful in assessing the reporting of crimes as it\noverlaps with the phases involved in the criminal justice pro-\ncess (i.e., arrest, judicial proceedings, and sentencing).\nFrames can take on an episodic or a thematic format.\nEpisodic frames treat a story as a discrete event--a crime is\ndescribed and a case is followed. These frames typically\nencourage the audience to place responsibility for a social\nproblem on individuals and ignore possible societal contribu-\ntions. Thematic frames are less frequently used; however, they\nilluminate trends, chronic problems, or other systemic consid-\nerations of an entire criminal justice issue or specific crime\nthat is explored in detail (Surette, 2010). Specific factors that\ninfluence journalistic framing include (a) social norms and\nvalues, (b) organizational pressures and constraints, (c) influ-\nence of interest groups, (d) journalistic routines, and (e) ideo-\nlogical or political orientations of journalists (Shoemaker &\ntional factors, including ignorance, pressure from the editor, or\nword space limitations (Shoemaker & Reese, 1996).\nLiterature Review: News Media Frames\nof IPV\nNews media reports of homicide are produced daily in the\nUnited States. While murder is not the most frequently occur-\nring violent crime, it receives the most regular news coverage\n(Graber, 1980). Crime reporting relies heavily on official\nsources (Ferrand-Bullock, 2008) and is a durable news com-\nmodity (e.g., Garofalo, 1981). As a result, newspaper articles\nserve as an excellent data source for researchers interested in\ninvestigating the trends and characteristics associated with\nIPV and IPH (e.g., Ferrand-Bullock & Cubert, 2002; Taylor &\nSorenson, 2002). To date, police records, death certificates,\nand surveys have been the primary sources used to capture\nhomicide data. But newspaper articles may be more useful in\nproviding additional information about the phenomenon, as\nnews coverage \"provides a map of the world of criminal events\nthat differs in many ways from the one provided by official\ntural, social, geographical, and temporal contexts of the act.\nStudies on the framing of IPV indicate that journalists\nprovide a distorted view of the crime (Berns, 1999; Consalvo,\nage of domestic violence is typically framed to support the\nstatus quo--coverage blames the victim while relieving soci-\nety of any obligation to the incident. Similarly, Maxwell,\nHuxford, Borum, and Hornik (2000) determined that articles\ncover specific incidents only and tend to place blame or solu-\ntions with individual victims and perpetrators. Berns (2004)\nreported that newspaper stories primarily focus on victims,\neither celebrating their courage for leaving a violent relation-\nship or blaming them for letting the abuse continue. Frames\nfrequently utilize accusations by holding the victim respon-\nsible for instigating his or her own abuse, and then failing to\nexit given the opportunity. Berns (2004) warned that as a\nresult of these episodic frames, IPV is not seen as a social\nproblem originating within a context of male violence; con-\nsequently the violence perpetrated by abusers is lost.\nDeficiencies have also been noted regarding news media\ncoverage of IPH. Ferrand-Bullock and Cubert (2002) analyzed\nnewspaper coverage of domestic violence fatalities in a\nWashington state sample, focusing on the accuracy of victim\nportrayals and attention to the broader social issue of IPV.\nThey determined that coverage was often inaccurate and sup-\nported common stereotypes/misconceptions of IPV. Likewise,\nTaylor and Sorenson (2002) completed a content analysis of\nResults suggested that coverage of homicide was episodic. By\ninvestigating gender issues in the reporting patterns of IPH,\nmedia attempt to sensationalize the news by highlighting the\nworthiness (or lack thereof) of the victim. Wozniak found that\nthe broader issue of IPV was not mentioned in 99% of the\nsampled articles, further confirming the episodic, noncontex-\ntual reporting assumption found in other studies.\nWith little prior knowledge of news media framing of\nCIPH, however, it leads to a rationale for doing the present\nstudy. To situate victim and perpetrator characteristics as\nwell as types of media frames within established social sci-\nence theory, we turn to a long-standing debate as to whether\nIPV is gender symmetric or asymmetric. Next we review two\ncompeting points of view that informed our research, namely,\nthe family violence and feminist perspectives.\nTheoretical Rationale\nFamily violence and feminist theories represent two mark-\nedly different perspectives on the causes and consequences\nof IPV. Of specific interest is the concept of gender symme-\n1987). There is a well-established literature on this debate,\nwith feminist formulations indicating that it is disproportion-\nately a problem of men assaulting women (R. E. Dobash &\nMeyer and Post 3\ntheorists contend that men and women are equally likely to\nperpetrate IPV. While each theory agrees that both sexes\nhave the potential to be violent (e.g., Johnson, 2006; Straus,\n1999), the fundamental differences come down to the context\nin which the violence occurs (Bouffard, Wright, Muftic, &\ncifically, how IPV is defined (e.g., DeKeseredy, 2000) and\nhow the data are captured (e.g., DeKeseredy, 2000; Kimmel,\nFamily Violence Perspective\nHow the research community defines IPV plays an important\nrole in how data are captured and the resultant prevalence\nand incidence rates. The use of broad versus narrow defini-\ntions of IPV impacts the perceived causes and motivations\nfor this crime and frequently leads to conflicting reports of\nperpetrator/victim sex ratios. For example, general crime\nsurveys that use narrow, legal definitions of physical and\nsexual violence frequently find low incidence rates of IPV\nNational Family Violence Survey (NFVS) define violence as\nthe frequency with which cohabiting partners use various\nconflict tactics during an argument. The Conflict Tactics\nScales (CTS) are often used by family violence theorists\n(Straus, 1979) and routinely identify high rates of IPV, low\nrates of injury, stable levels of severity, and gender symmetry\nStudies that identify gender symmetry in IPV frequently\nconceptualize the phenomenon as \"common couple violence\"\nor \"situational couple violence,\" both of which occur when\npartners use physical violence against each other within the\nOther conceptualizations that lend support to sex-symmetric\nIPV include \"situational couple violence\" and \"mutual vio-\nlent control.\" Situational couple violence occurs when violent\nacts are perpetrated by either intimate partner but are not\nrooted in the desire to control the other. Mutual violent con-\ntrol, however, occurs when both partners are violent and con-\ntrolling toward the other person (Johnson, 2006).\nFeminist Perspective\nFeminist researchers, however, use broader definitions of\nIPV that include psychological, verbal, economic, and emo-\ntional violence (DeKeseredy, 2000). The National Violence\nAgainst Women Survey (NVAWS; Tjaden & Thoennes,\n2000) utilized this broader definition and included measures\nof physical violence, sexual assault, stalking, and emotion-\nally abusive and controlling behaviors. Not only was there a\nlarger proportion of female victims, but study results also\nindicated that 81% of female victims were stalked by a for-\nmer or current partner, and of those women, 31% were sexu-\nally assaulted as well (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000). These are\nmuch higher rates than those detected in family violence\nsurveys.\nFeminist scholars contend that narrow definitions of IPV\nignore \"the context, meanings, and motives of both men's\nand women's violence\" (DeKeseredy & Dragiewicz, 2007,\np. 875). Such scholars argue that lethal and nonlethal vio-\nlence is overwhelmingly perpetrated by men against women\n(R. P. Dobash & Dobash, 2004) and the abuse is situated\nwithin an environment of coercion and control (Stark, 2007).\nJohnson (2006) termed this type of violence \"intimate terror-\nism,\" as it encompasses nonphysical forms of abuse that are\nrooted in the desire to control another. Tactics associated\nwith intimate terrorism include threats, economic control,\nthe use of privilege and punishment, using children, isola-\ntion, emotional abuse, and sexual control.\nExtending the pioneering work of DeKeseredy and\nbuilds upon the feminist perspective of IPV by more clearly\ndefining coercion in intimate relationships. Coercion is\ndefined as the use of force or threats to either compel or dispel\na certain response in another human being. This theory\nimplies the systematic subjugation and methodical action per-\npetrated by an abuser, and is among the first to place the con-\ncept at the forefront of theoretical development. Stark noted\nthat if men want to maintain their structural-hierarchical\nsuperiority they \"must do so directly and personally in each\nrelationship\" (pp. 199-200). The killing of a current or former\nintimate partner's children or other loved one, as is the case\nwith CIPH, is reflective of the most extreme form of coercive\ncontrol as in the aforementioned case study. A man was mad\nat his wife, so he murdered their four children as a means to\npunish and control his wife. Is it possible that taking the life\nof a collateral individual is a more extreme form of coercion\nthan killing the victim herself?\nMethod\nThis study used newspapers to describe the occurrence of\nCIPH in Michigan by demographic and other variables dur-\nhomicide archives maintained by law enforcement agencies,\nsurveillance that includes newspaper reports of murders has\nproven to be an innovative and efficient way to monitor\nstatewide intimate partner-related homicides. This particular\ndata collection approach was also used by Michigan's health\ndepartment for IPH surveillance due to incomplete records\nmaintained by prosecutors, police, medical examiners, and\nregistrars (Biroscak, Smith, & Post, 2006).\nWe conducted a quantitative content analysis of articles\nextracted from a larger database assembled by the Michigan\nReading Press Service (MRPS), a clipping service that\nreviews all daily and weekly newspapers. Articles that cov-\nered IPH as well as CIPH were collected by MRPS and\narchived at the Michigan Domestic Violence Prevention\nBoard. We reviewed all newspaper articles about violent\n4 SAGE Open\ndeaths occurring within domestic relationships (murder or\nhomicide of men or women involved in an intimate relation-\nship). Articles were also reviewed if a death occurred during\na sexual assault by an intimate partner.\nThe full database contained approximately 1,200 stories.\nThis study included homicides that occurred within the context\nof a current or former intimate partner relationship--that is,\nthere was a clearly identified intimate partner \"focal victim\"\nidentified by the journalist as having a past or present romantic\nrelationship with the homicide perpetrator. A collateral victim\nwas any individual outside that primary intimate relationship.\nThis study excluded stories where the homicide victim did not\nhave a familial, romantic, or social connection with either the\nfocal victim or perpetrator (e.g., strangers/bystanders).\nAnalysis of Key Story Characteristics\nWe had two units of analysis in this study: (a) the individual\nCIPH incident and (b) individual news reports. Incidents\nwere identified according to perpetrator and/or focal victim\nname, and news reports consisted of individual articles col-\nlected by MRPS. In addition to recording characteristics of\nCIPH perpetrators, focal victims, and CIPH victims, trained\ncoders documented the following: (a) the phases of crime\ncovered in each news report and (b) specific homicide char-\nacteristics. Coders documented how frequently the homi-\ncides were framed as accidental, the result of a mutual fight\nbetween focal victim and perpetrator, or premeditated with\nmalice aforethought. Last, homicide portrayal (i.e., whether\nit was shocking or expected) was captured.\nIn addition to documenting victim and perpetrator charac-\nteristics of CIPH, a major goal of this study was to assess how\nthe media portray and explain the crime. For the purposes of\nthe present analysis, \"homicide portrayal\" is defined as the\njournalistic framework for presenting the CIPH. This variable\nassessed the frequency with which shock or expectation was\nused to portray the killings. Shock occurred when the journal-\nist discussed the unexpected nature of the crime, while expec-\ntation occurred when the journalist discussed how the crime\nwas a logical outcome of escalating violence or psychological\ndeficiencies. Explanation for the CIPH is defined as the pri-\nmary reason for committing the killing(s). Homicide expla-\nnations were categorized as incident-specific/episodic or\nthematic. Incident-specific explanations focus on a single\ntriggering event; a thematic explanation focuses on back-\nground factors or contexts prior to the CIPH that may have\ncontributed to the killings.\nIntercoder Reliability Analysis\nA reliability analysis was conducted prior to study initiation.\nTwo independent coders were trained in data collection and\nunderwent three rounds of testing that included all potential\nstudy variables on which they could disagree. Stories were\nrandomly selected from all available articles, as stratification\nwas not a viable option due to small number of cases. The\nvariables were tested using simple percentage of agreement\nand Scott's pi () to correct for chance agreement. Scott's pi\nis the standard measurement of interrater reliability for nom-\ninal variables in the communication sciences (Schiff &\nAll variables that obtained 100% agreement were excluded\nfrom further reliability analysis. The remaining study vari-\nables were expected to obtain high levels of agreement, spe-\ncifically 0.85 and above. If they failed to meet this threshold,\nthey were retested in subsequent analyses. The sample size\nfor Rounds 2 and 3 was n = 15, so there were instances in\nwhich coders disagreed only once but failed to reach 0.85.\nInstead of throwing the variables out, we met with coders to\nreview them and only moved forward when percentage of\nagreement was deemed acceptable.\nResults\nVictim and Perpetrator Characteristics\nrecorded in the MRPS database, representing 84 CIPH inci-\ndents.

A majority of\nAs reported above, most victims were either current/ex-\nwives or girlfriends of CIPH perpetrators.\nThe 84 CIPH incidents resulted in 110 homicide victims\n(Table 3). Nearly 30% of CIPH victims were the new intimate\npartners of the focal victim, encompassing current boyfriends\nor husbands, perceived romantic interests, and those engaging\nin a sexual relationship with the focal victim. Children of the\nfocal victim only (no biological ties to the perpetrator; 16.5%)\nand those shared by the focal victim and perpetrator (biologi-\ncal connection was established; 12.1%) were prevalent. The\nfocal victim's parent was killed in 18.7% of the cases.\nMedia Portrayal and Explanation of CIPH\nHomicide Portrayals.As many articles only contained basic\nfacts about the crime, 60% provided no journalistic\nMeyer and Post 5\nTable 1.

In our study, all CIPH perpetrators were male, with\nnearly half identified as ex-/estranged husbands or ex-boy-\nfriends of the focal victims. Perpetrators primarily targeted\nfocal victims'new intimate partners and their children. While\n81% of CIPH cases reported one collateral victim, the maxi-\nmum number killed in a single event was four. These data\npaint an interesting picture of a male-dominated crime in\nwhich collateral victims are limited to female partners'\nfriends or family members. The only cases in which the per-\npetrator injured his children occurred when they were bio-\nlogically related to the female partner/ex-partner. Focal\nvictims, who were all female, were also injured in about a\nquarter of reported cases and nearly half were killed.\nOur content analysis revealed that CIPH is primarily\nframed as incident-specific or episodic (83%), with no men-\ntion of contextual issues beyond the immediate homicide\nevent. This finding is in line with previous IPH research. The\ncrime is overwhelmingly depicted as shocking and unex-\npected, with less than 10% of news reports making note of a\nhistory of abuse or violence in the primary intimate dyad.\nHowever, when journalistic explanations were offered, more\nthan half attributed the CIPH to an interpersonal conflict\nbetween the focal victim and perpetrator. Based on the homi-\ncide explanation definitions used in this study, when conflict\nwas used as a reason for CIPH, both the focal victim and\nperpetrator were framed as contributing to the death(s). As a\nresult, it appears as though a social breakdown frame\ndominates--that is, CIPH is the result of a family problem\nHowever, when considering the theoretical implications\nof the aforementioned findings, we must turn to the drastic\ngender differences in perpetration and victimization. In no\nprior study on IPV-related crimes has such a gendered pat-\ntern emerged. Previous studies of IPH have reported both\nmale and female perpetrators/victims (Biroscak et al., 2006;\nRennison, 2003), albeit disproportionately leaning toward\nmale perpetrators and female victims. Still, this finding lends\nsupport to the feminist perspective of IPV in that power and\ncontrol over the woman is a likely goal of the violence. Many\nCIPH perpetrators were no longer in a relationship with the\nfocal victim, but their actions appear to be driven by a desire\nto hurt their estranged/ex-partner. Taking away a child or a\nnew intimate partner in her life is a powerful control tactic\nthat lends credence to the coercive control perspective of\nStark (2007) and other feminist scholars. Despite this con-\ntrast in sex ratios and relationship status of the perpetrators/\nvictims, the news media framed the crime in an episodic\nfashion, using a family violence perspective to describe the\ncrime. This framework has the potential to sway audiences to\nbelieve that severe outcomes of IPV, including CIPH, are the\nresult of a triggering incident rooted in the intimate dyad.\nPotential Limitations\nA major limitation of this study is that collateral victims who\nsurvived an altercation were not included because the inclusion\ncriterion was restricted to homicides. The exclusion of those\nwho were not killed allowed us to focus on CIPH specifically;\nhowever, generalizations cannot be made about the nature and\ncharacteristics of the crime in cases where collateral victims\nsurvive an attack. It is possible that a different reporting pattern\ncould emerge in this particular context. Moreover, while we\ntook steps to ensure interrater reliability of collected data, we\ndid not assess measurement validity. However, given the\nextreme nature of homicide events, it seems unlikely that many\nfalse positives would occupy our database.\nIt is also important to note the challenges associated with\nusing the news to study crime. The news media are more\nlikely to report newsworthy crimes and provide filtered,\nmolded pieces of information to the public. News producers\nlargely determine a crime's newsworthiness by choosing\nwhich stories to report out of all known events, leaving those\nthat are not bizarre, spectacular, or extreme on the desk\n(Surette, 2010). In addition, journalists and other news media\npersonnel are under tremendous organizational constraints,\nwhich may impede their ability to produce an objective\nimage of reality (Cohen & Young, 1981). Unfortunately, this\ncoupled with the economic landscape of traditional media\nleads to decreased support for gathering additional informa-\ntion. Journalists are likely processing news releases, official\nrecords, or press conferences instead of conducting their own\ninvestigations (Mason, 2007). This lack of investigation and\njournalistic specialization has negative ramifications on the\nreporting of complex situations such as CIPH.\nFinally, although newspaper articles are a good data source\nand we have an exhaustive collection of CIPH coverage, all\nTable 5.

What is considered newsworthy in Detroit is\ngoing to be different from rural newsrooms in northern\nMichigan. Crimes are more likely to be deemed newsworthy\nif they are unusual, different, out of the ordinary, or affect\nindividuals of higher social status or celebrity (Chermak,\nTuchman, 1978). Although CIPH is a unique, relatively rare\ncrime, murders are perceived as less newsworthy by journal-\nists in urban areas and when murder victims are dispropor-\nAs a result, not all homicides are going to make the news.\nNotwithstanding limitations such as these, our findings are\nnovel and help further our understanding of IPV.\nConclusion\nThis study has several implications, the most immediate of\nwhich are its contributions to the IPH literature. Through an\nintensive content analysis of reported incidents of CIPH, we\nnow have a better understanding of the dynamics and nature\nof CIPH. Our findings suggest that members of focal vic-\ntims' social and familial networks are also at risk for injury\nor death. As such, court systems, law enforcement officials,\nand Child Protective Services (CPS) professionals should\nbroaden their definitions of IPV victims and IPH to include\npersons outside of the immediate dyad.\nThe next step in this particular line of research is to con-\nduct a qualitative analysis of CIPH news reports. This will\nproduce a more detailed understanding of the crime and sup-\nplement the quantitative findings presented in this article. As\nwe have assessed newspaper articles in Michigan, we recom-\nmend examining CIPH across the United States. We also\nsuggest primary data collection with members of the media\nindustry, including both journalists and editors. The more we\nlearn about this phenomenon, the better we can train journal-\nists to consider CIPH through a more critical lens and within\nthe broader context of IPV. In addition, this information sup-\nport tailoring prevention and intervention efforts for indi-\nviduals outside of, yet still connected to, the intimate dyad.\nIn conclusion, this is the first study to investigate media\nreporting of CIPH. Our analysis of all reported cases suggests\nthat a feminist theoretical model of IPV better explains the\ncrime, despite a preponderance of family-conflict-oriented\nnews frames. While CIPH is frequently presented as the result\nof interpersonal conflict, the striking gender asymmetry in\nperpetration and victimization positions it as a gender-based\ncrime.
