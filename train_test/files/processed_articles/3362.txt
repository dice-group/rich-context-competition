Even within a particular culture different subgroups may vary greatly in their typical\nchildrearing practices. Although socialization has always aimed to mold children to fit a\nparticular society at a certain time in history, the fundamental needs of a young infant,\nespecially during the first few months of life, are universally the same: adequate nutrition,\nsufficient sleep, and fulfillment of basic emotional needs. This leads to the question of\nNatural Parenting\nwhether any of the known child-caring approaches succeeds better than the others in\nproviding the young infant with an optimal environment for physical and psychological\ngrowth. Or to phrase the question differently: What is the ideal way to care for infants?\nAn increasing number of parents and child-care experts in the industrialized West\nhave come to view the prevalent Western approach to infant care as not sensitive enough to\nan infant's innate needs. Instead, they have turned to a childrearing approach that considers\nthe children themselves to be the best experts in defining their own needs (Frissell-Deppe,\ncommunicative signs and by sensitively responding to their expressed needs, adherents of this\nparenting style believe they are laying the foundation for most favorable human development.\nWithin this childrearing style, crying is always interpreted as a clear communication of a\nlegitimate need, and the emotional demands of children are considered to be as valid as\nphysiological ones. A further characteristic of this parenting approach is the belief that\nparents have an innate sensitivity to their child's cues and an instinctive knowledge of the\nrequired responses.\nOn a practical level this results in the infants being kept in close physical contact to\ntheir mothers for most of the day until the children start to become mobile, after which\nphysical closeness gradually lessens. During the day the infants are carried on the caregivers'\nbodies, in the front, back, or on the hip, frequently with the help of a carrying device, and at\nnight they sleep next to their parents. The children are breastfed on demand for at least 2\u00ad4\nyears and the process of weaning is child-led. Cosleeping of parents and children may\ncontinue for years.\nThis approach to parenting has been given many names: empathic parenting (Hunt,\n1999; Sears and Sears, 2001), natural nurturing (Natural Nurturing Network, n.d.), natural\nparenting, parenting from the heart (Hunt, 2001). Rather than advocating the application of a\nrigid set of guidelines, it calls for a parenting style geared to the individual child's unique\npersonality, which is thought to result in the best possible care for the infant. Although many\naspects of natural parenting are already currently implemented by many Western parents in\nvarying degrees, approaches that combine all of its elements are nonetheless rare in the\ncontemporary West.\nThe following account will describe the intricately related nature of mother\u00adinfant\ndyads that adhere to the principles of natural parenting, covering the age range from infancy\nto early childhood, with a focus on the first year of life. Different aspects of this dyad's\nfunctioning will be elucidated, and benefits associated with this age-old approach to\nparenting will be examined. This paper is organized in such a way that arguments have been\ngrouped together under four main headings, starting with information pertaining to our\nevolutionary past, then proceeding to discuss physiological data, and finally turning to issues\nof a mainly psychological nature, followed by a cross-cultural and historical overview of\nparenting practices. A \"summary and conclusion\" section at the end of the paper ties up all\narguments and concludes the review. For an outline of the article's structure and for an\noverview of the topics to be discussed, see Table 1. The approach taken in this work is\nmultidisciplinary in nature and integrates a wide range of data from the fields of\ndevelopmental psychology, evolutionary psychology, anthropology, pediatric medicine,\nphysiology, and neuroscience. This paper further draws on data from both human and animal\nresearch, and both healthy and clinical populations, in order to use the broadest knowledge\nbase possible for a comprehensive description of the current state of knowledge pertaining to\noptimal infant care in accordance with the innate needs of the human infant.\nNatural Parenting\nOverview of Topics Discussed in This Paper\n___________________________________________________________________________\n Evolutionary Context\n Evolutionary Function of Crying\n Human Infants as \"Carried Young\"\n Cosleeping\n Breastfeeding\n Exterogestation\n Heartbeat and Uterine Sounds\n Movement Stimulation\n Swaddling\n Continuous and Multi-Sensory Stimulation\n Health Aspects of Natural Parenting\n Physiological Correlates of Crying\n Skin-to-Skin Care for Preterm Infants\n Touch Effects on Physiology\n Physical Growth\n Immunological Processes\n Psychosocial Dwarfism\n Thermal Regulation\n Orthopedic and Other Health Aspects of Infant Carrying\n Spinal Health\n Hip Development\n Characteristics of a Good Carrying Device\n Microenvironment Inside a Carrier\n Gastroesophageal Reflux and Otitis Media\n Infant Toilet TrainingElimination Communication\n Bed Sharing and SIDS\n Breastfeeding\n Benefits for the Child\n Benefits for the Mother\n On-Demand Feeding\n Weaning\n Psychological Correlates of Natural Parenting\n Mother\u00adInfant Interaction and Attachment\n Sensitive Parenting and Secure Attachment\n Parental Responsiveness and Infant Crying\n The Role of Physical Proximity\n Natural Parenting, Sensitive Parenting, and Mother\u00adInfant Attachment\n DependenceIndependence\n Brain DevelopmentPhysiology Meets Psychology\n Prevalence of Natural Parenting\n Infant Carrying\n Climatic Influences\n Specifics of Infant Carrying: Who, How, and With What?\n CosleepingBed Sharing and Room Sharing\n Bed Sharing Across the Globe\n Bed Sharing in the Contemporary West\n Room Sharing Across the Globe\n Room Sharing in the Contemporary West\n Infant Feeding\n Wet Nursing\n Artificial Feeding\n The Industrial RevolutionDecline of Breastfeeding\n Feeding Practices Reassessed\n Current Situation\n Specifics of Breastfeeding\nNatural Parenting\nBefore moving on to the substance of this paper, the reader should be made aware that\nthe position presented in this paper, although drawing upon evolutionary information in\ndiscussing infant care, is distinct from many other evolutionary approaches to parenting (e.g.,\npsychological and physiological wellbeing of the individual infant, whereas traditional\nevolutionary approaches to infant care have typically examined the topic at the level of the\ngene and been concerned with issues such as reproductive success, parent\u00adoffspring conflict,\nparental investment decisions, and the role of various infant behaviors (e.g., crying) as means\nto increase the infant's reproductive fitness. The subjective wellbeing of the infant has not\nbeen a major focus of the latter approaches, unless related to increased survival chances and\nfuture reproductive success. The present review, on the other hand, only uses evolutionary\ninformation to provide a description of what could be called an ideal-case scenario of infant\ncare unconstrained by other competing demands. It thus presents only one side of the coin,\nwith the central questions framed in terms of infant wellbeing rather than reproductive\nsuccess.\nThe current perspective is also distinct from attachment theory (Ainsworth, Blehar,\nWaters, and Wall, 1978; Bowlby, 1982), although there is overlap between the two positions.\nBoth stress caregiver sensitivity to infant needs and acknowledge the evolutionary roots of\ninfant behavior. However, attachment theory in its focus on the infant's psychological\nrelationship with the caregiver has a narrower scope, excluding aspects of physiological\nwellbeing (except when referring to the survival function of caregiver attachment), and\nfurther gives the evolutionary context of caregiving mainly explanatory value, so that the\ndominant parenting paradigm of the modern West has remained relatively unchallenged\nwithin this research tradition. As a result, inherent infant needs are partly defined in different\nFinally, the current analysis acknowledges that cross-cultural differences in parenting\nare evolved adaptations to different contextual demands (e.g., climatic and geographical\ncircumstances, environmental hazards, forms of subsistence, cultural values, and\nsocioeconomic conditions; Kaplan and Dove, 1987; Keller, H., Borke, Yovsi, Lohaus, and\nand that different survival strategies have also evolved in the child to meet different\ncircumstances (cf. adaptiveness of different attachment strategies; Main, 1990; see also\npaper is that not all of these adaptations have produced optimal outcomes for the infant, and it\nis thus argued that in situations where parents have some leeway as to how to parent,\nknowledge about the limits of optimal caregiving can be of invaluable assistance in the\nprocess of weighing different caregiving options.\nEvolutionary Context\nEvolutionary Function of Crying\nWhen taking the stance that young infants signal genuine needs by crying (Zeifman,\n2001), then the message infants convey to their environment is unmistakable: Extensive close\ncontact with their caregiver is a necessary prerequisite for their wellbeing. However, the\noutdated advice that parents should not give in to their infant's calls for closeness to prevent\nthe child from learning \"that crying will get him what he wants, sufficient to make a spoiled,\nfussy baby, and a household tyrant whose continual demands make a slave of the\nmother\"as recommended by the U.S. Children's Bureau (U.S. Department of Labor,\nNatural Parenting\n175)is surprisingly persistent in making mothers even today mistrust and resist their natural\nimpulse to tend to their crying infant. Yet, theories on the evolutionary function of crying and\nresulting inferences pertaining to modern life, as summarized by Bell and Ainsworth (1972;\nBeginning with our first human ancestors who roamed the savannas of Africa about 2\nmillion years ago, the evolutionary environment of the human infant during most of human\nhistory is best described as that of small hunter-gatherer groups moving about in the country\nwith an ever-present danger of predators (Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby, 1992, p. 5; Fagan,\n2002). To ensure the survival of the offspring, born in a neurologically immature state as a\nresult of the female's narrowed birth canal brought about by bipedalism, continuous\nprotection and care by the caregiver was a necessity. In a species where the progeny is as\nhelpless as that of the human, attachment behavior on the infant's part alone is not sufficient\nto ensure continued existence; only in combination with reciprocal maternal behaviors is its\nprotective function maximized. A strong emotional bond between infant and mother, as well\nas a feedback system that was activated if the contact was for some reason interrupted, were\nthe mechanisms that maintained the mother's extensive involvement with her offspring. In\nthis context, crying was a powerful trigger that alerted the mother when her offspring was\nhungry, otherwise unwell, or separated from her protecting influence. As predators might also\nbe attracted by the crying infant, it was, however, an obvious advantage if the vocal signal\nwas terminated as soon as mother and infant were reunited, or if the source of the distress was\nremoved. On the other hand, it made sense to continue and possibly intensify the signal if\nthere was no response from the caregiver. Under such circumstances it would also seem\nadvantageous for an infant to cry only in the most alarming situations and to employ other,\nless dramatic, means of communication in all other cases.\nAs these conditions prevailed during most of our evolutionary history, survival-\npromoting behavior patterns associated with this evolutionary context, such as crying in\ninfants, became a natural part of the human genetic makeup. Physically, modern human\ninfants have changed very little since these times. Therefore, newborns today will insist on\ncontinuous care as vehemently as they did hundreds of thousand years ago when life was still\na daily battle for survival. If some caregivers assume that constant physical contact is no\nlonger necessary for an infant's smooth development, this may well be true in terms of\npresent-day living conditions, but it is nonetheless in conflict with what infants have been\nbiologically adapted for.\nHuman Infants as \"Carried Young\"\nModern notions in biology have also led to the human infant being classified as\nbelonging to the \"carried type of young\" (i.e., infants that are typically carried on the bodies\nof their mothers), in contrast to the offspring of other mammals that are generally left in a\nhidden place (i.e., nested or cached), or to those that are physically developed enough to\nindependently follow their mothers soon after birth (review: Kirkilionis, 1997a, 1997b). This\nview is based on evolutionary, particularly anatomical, considerations, and is substantiated by\nyoung infants' typical reactions when parted from their caregivers. Even though human\ninfants no longer possess feet specifically designed for clinging, and despite the fact that their\nmothers are no longer covered by dense body hair, as is the case among our closest relatives\nin the animal world, human infants still display many striking characteristics of a carried\nyoung. Like a gorilla baby, the human infant, when lying on the back, frequently assumes a\nposition where both legs are flexed and abducted (Figure 1). This position is also adopted\nNatural Parenting\nwhen the lying or sitting child is lifted up (Figure 2) and allows the child to be placed astride\nthe caregiver's hip, nestled against the carrier's body (Figure 3). In addition, a newborn's\nspine, unlike the adult S-shaped spine, is slightly rounded and so restricts thigh movements to\nthe front of the body. When lying on their backs, newborn are therefore incapable of bringing\ntheir thighs completely down to touch the surface underneath. This anatomical feature does\nnot support upright walking, but is ideal for lateral sitting on the caregiver's hip, which was\nthe most suitable infant carrying position following the emergence of bipedalism and the loss\nof body hair in the evolving human species. As a result, support of the infant's back by the\ncaregiver became necessary, which, however, is also still observed among the grand apes,\nparticularly during early infancy. Human infants also actively contribute to sustained carrying\nby pressing their legs against the carrier's body in reaction to unexpected or brisk\nmovements. If the evolution of primates has progressed from non-infant-carrying to infant-\ncarrying, as assumed by Kappeler (1998) and Ross (2001), then it is further noteworthy that\nof all primates the lineage leading to modern-time (Western) Homo sapiens is the only one\nwhere habitual infant carrying has been lost once it had evolved during an earlier stage of\nFigure 1: An infant gorilla and a 3-month-old girl, both with their legs in a position of\nflexion and abduction.

The photos are courtesy of E. Kirkilionis.\nFigure 3: A 3-week-old infant straddling the mother's hip. The photo is courtesy of E.\nKirkilionis.\nAlso, when examining a newborn's grasping and Moro (startle or embracing)\nreflexes, not in isolation from each other but as a pair, it becomes clear that when the startle\nresponse is elicited while the palmar grasp is active, and while a mild traction is applied on\nthe arms, the result is strengthened clinging (Prechtl, 1965)a useful response if considered\nin the context of an infant holding on to a caregiver who may have made an unexpected\nmove, decreasing the infant's chance of falling from the caregiver's body.\nInterspecies comparisons provide further clues regarding the human infant's preferred\nlocation. The composition of a species' breast milk (Ben Shaul, 1962) and the sucking speed\nof the offspring (Wolff, 1968) can be used as indicators of the ideal caretaking mode as well\nas the typical spacing of feeds (Ben Shaul, 1962; Blurton Jones, 1974). Mammals can be\nroughly divided into two groups. First, there are animals with a very high protein and fat\ncontent in their milk (e.g., rabbits) that nurse their young infrequentlyevery few hours or\nNatural Parenting\nonly once a day. Between feedings the young are left in a secluded place while the mother\nspends extended periods of time away from them. Sucking rate tends to be high. In contrast,\nspecies whose milk is low in fat and protein feed their progeny at short intervals, or almost\ncontinuously. Further characteristic features of the latter group are extensive contact between\nthe mother and her young (the infants follow the mother, are carried by her, or hibernate with\nher) and a comparatively lower sucking rate of the infants. Higher primates, who carry their\noffspring on their bodies and feed on demand, are typical representatives of this group.\nHuman breast milk is low in fat and very low in protein (Lawrence, 1994), implying that\nhuman infants, too, are fairly continuous feeders adapted to extensive maternal contact.\nFurther evidence that human infants are of the carried rather than the nested or cached\ntype of young is provided by known facts on other typical behaviors of mammals with\nintermittent vs. extensive maternal contact. For instance, young animals that are typically left\nalone for much of the day often do not defecate or urinate readily without assistance,\nprobably in order to avoid attracting predators by scent (Ben Shaul et al., 1962; Blurton\nJones, 1974, p. 313). Neither do they cry spontaneously during the absence of their mother\ninfant.\nIn addition, it has been inferred from human infants' distribution of body fat that\ncontinuous ventral contact between infant and caregiver is the caretaking mode most\nsupportive of the child's immature temperature regulation system (Als, 1977). As the dark\nlipid cells that insulate the body are much more densely distributed on the infant's back than\non the ventral side, continuous frontal contact was an excellent guard against loss of body\nheat during most of human history. The same still appears to hold true today (Christensson et\nCosleeping\nA natural extension of infant carrying during the day is bed sharing at night. The\npractice of infant\u00admother cosleeping in the same bed is the predominant form of nighttime\ncare in most cultures today (McKenna, 1993). It is further assumed to have been the context\nof evolutionary history in which child sleep physiology was shaped into its present state\nsharing is therefore also believed to be the sleep environment to which the neurologically\nvulnerable human newborn and young child is best adapted. Taking the inference one step\nMcKenna et al., 1993) hypothesize that, if practiced safely, cosleeping may even reduce a\nchild's risk of dying from at least some forms of sudden infant death syndrome.\nBreastfeeding\nIt can be assumed that no effective alternative to breast milk existed before the\ndomestication of animals and before humans had acquired the ability to make vessels that\ncould hold liquids (Small, 1998, p. 183). Therefore, during the more than 99% of our human\nexistence when hunting and gathering was the main form of subsistence (Fagan, 2002, e.g., p.\n122) all infants would have been breastfed. Moreover, as the composition of mammalian milk\nis species-specific (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2005a; Ben Shaul, 1962), the milk of\nhuman mothers has evolved to uniquely complement the nutritional needs of their own\noffspring. Indeed, human milk is an exceptionally complex biological fluid with thousands of\nconstituents (Picciano, 2001), the exact composition and dynamic quality of which artificial\nbreast milk substitutes are unable to replicate (Rodriguez-Palmero, Koletzko, Kunz, and\nNatural Parenting\nJensen, 1999). In this connection, it is noteworthy that in a study on odor preferences, 2-\nweek-old newborns who had never been breastfed were found to exhibit an apparently inborn\npreference for the breast odor of a lactating, unfamiliar woman over the scent of their familiar\nformula (Porter, Makin, Davis, and Christensen, 1991).\nRegarding the particulars of nursing to which human infants adapted over the course\nof evolution, their inherent need for shortly spaced feedings has already been discussed. The\nquestion of weaning age can also be answered by comparative analyses. According to\nDettwyler (1995) who studied weaning patterns in nonhuman primates, a primate species'\ntypical age of weaning can be inferred from a number of factors such as eruption of the first\npermanent molar, birth weight, adult body weight, and length of gestation. When applying\nthese calculations to humans, our natural weaning age is estimated to fall between 2\u00bd and 7\nyears (Dettwyler, 1995). In cultures where no artificial infant formulas are used and in\nsocieties where child-led weaning is the norm, children have been observed to nurse for 2\u00ad6\nNelson, Schiefenhoevel, and Haimerl, 2000; Stuart-Macadam, 1995), thus lending support to\nDettwyler's inferences. A comparison of weaning ages in different primate species further\nindicates that those primates who habitually carry their infants on their bodies have later\nweaning ages than primates who cache their offspring in nests or on trees while foraging\nExterogestation\nA caretaking style that encourages continued contact between mother and child for the\nfirst few months after birth also presents the infant with an environment approximating that\nprior to birth, therefore making the transition and adaptation to extrauterine life as free from\nabrupt changes as possible. It has in fact been proposed that the exceptionally immature state\nin which human infants are born indicates that gestation is not complete with birth but needs\nto be completed outside the womb as a form of exterogestationin contrast to\nuterogestation, the development that takes place inside the mother's uterus (Bostock, 1958a,\ngestation should be considered complete at around the age of nine months when effective\ncrawling commences. In Montagu's (1986) view, the environmental conditions during this\nperiod of exterogestation should mimic those within the womb as much as possiblethat is,\nthe child should be kept in close contact with the mother's body in a tight and warm\nembracein order for the infant to feel most comfortable. Other researchers have also\nexpressed the view that continued stimulation of a kind similar to that during the fetal period\nwould facilitate neonates' adjustment to their new environment (Gatts, Fernbach, Wallace,\nMontagu (1986) based his inferences on comparative data concerning mammalian\nspecies in general and the grand apes in particular. Humans are in a more immature state at\nbirth, and continue to be dependent on their parents' care for a longer period than practically\nany other mammal. Moreover, compared with apes, each of the developmental periods such\nas infancy, adolescence, and old age last considerably longer in humans, with the exception\nof gestation. It therefore appears that the only reason humans are born at such an early stage\nof development is that the fast-growing head and large body size of the human fetus makes\npassage through the narrow birth canal at a later stage impossible, a disadvantage resulting\nfrom the erect posture of humans that necessitated a tightening of the pelvic outlet. Montagu\n(1986) describes human neonates as almost as immature as newborn kangaroos or opossums,\nwhich after birth continue their gestation in their mother's pouch until sufficiently matured.\nIn the human case, no such external womb is available, despite the fact that the human infant\nNatural Parenting\nremains in an immature state for much longer than the marsupial infant. However, the close\nbond and intricate connection between mother and child can be viewed as the emotional\nframe that also drives the human mother to provide her infant with the equivalent of the\nkangaroo mother's pouch (Montagu, 1986).\nHeartbeat and uterine sounds\nResearch data support the notion that young infants feel most comfortable in an\nenvironment approximating that before birth. One dominant stimulus in the prenatal\nenvironment is the constant rhythmical beat of the mother's heart (Lecanuet, 1998), perceived\nby the fetus from the beginning of the third trimester when functional hearing commences\n(Birnholz and Benacerraf, 1983). Research has shown that the heartbeat sound continues to\ninfluence infants even after birth. In a classical study conducted in the U.S., Salk (1973)\ncompared two groups of more than a hundred neonates during their first four days of life in\nthe hospital nursery, one being exposed to the recorded sound of an adult's heartbeat 24 hr a\nday, the other receiving no particular treatment. After 4 days more newborns in the\nexperimental group showed a weight gain relative to the control group, despite equal food\nintake. The control infants experienced a median loss of 20 g, compared to a median gain of\n40 g for the treated group. The experimental group also cried less during these days, pointing\nto a soothing influence of the heartbeat. Yet, other research on 2- to 4-day-old-newborns has\nfound no pacifying effect of the heart beat stimulus (Detterman, 1978a), and Salk's study\nHowever, 5-day-old Japanese neonates who were presented with heartbeat sounds or white\nnoise during a painful heelstick procedure also showed less intense behavioral responses and\nlower stress hormone (cortisol) levels than a control group presented with no sounds\n(Kawakami, Takai-Kawakami, Kurihara, Shimizu, and Yanaihara, 1996).\nIt further appears that the soothing effect is restricted to the heartbeat sound with all\nits typical properties, and is not applicable to an altered heartbeat. Salk (1973), for example,\nnoticed that a heartbeat sound at 128 beats per minutecompared to the regular adult\nheartrate of 72 beats per minuteresulted in increased distress among the infants.\nComparable reactions were observed when an accidental, constant hissing noise appeared in\nconjunction with the regular heartbeat sound. A possible reason why the white noise in the\nheelstick study (Kawakami et al., 1996) did not cause similar upset, but instead soothed the\ninfants, could be that it resembled the steady background noise that is constantly present in\nthe womba mixture of cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal, respiratory and other physiological\nsounds as well as movements of the mother and fetus (Lecanuet, 1998). Research has found\nthat these sounds have a calming effect on neonates as well (Murooka et al., 1975; Murooka,\nIt has also been found that mothers have a strong tendency to hold their infants on the\nleft side of their bodies, close to their hearts, regardless of whether they are right- or left-\nof mothers consistently position their children to the left of their chest, a number much\ngreater than expected by chance. The same lateral bias applies to holding dolls (Bundy,\n1979), but not to carrying other baby-sized objects of a neutral nature such as shopping\npackages (Weiland, 1964). The phenomenon has been observed in children as young as three\nyears (de Ch\u00e2teau and Andersson, 1976; Souza-Godeli, 1996) and, to some degree, also in\nbe stronger in new fathers and fathers with children over the age of one than in men without\nchildren of their own (de Ch\u00e2teau, 1983), and is also more pronounced in girls than in boys\n(de Ch\u00e2teau and Andersson, 1976). Bundy (1979) further reported it to be most marked\namong people having the greatest experience with infants.\nNatural Parenting\nAn extensive review of pieces of art from various cultures such as paintings,\nphotographs, and sculptures that depict adult\u00adinfant pairs largely confirms the universality of\nsome observations of infant carrying and cradling patterns in nonhuman primates (Hatta and\nMaestripieri, and Hopkins, 1998). In addition, rhesus monkey infants have been found to\nexhibit a significant preference for their mother's left nipple during the first few weeks of life\n(Tomaszycki et al., 1998). An instinctive knowledge of the beneficial effects of the heartbeat\non infants is one possible, and frequent, explanation for the universal cradling preference\nobserved. However, it has also been suggested that the described pattern may be attributable\nto the lateralization of brain functioning, particularly to the dominance of the right\nhemisphere in affective communication (Sieratzki and Woll, 1996). Others have linked the\ncradling bias to the right-side head-turning preference of most newborns (Ginsburg, Fling,\nMovement stimulation\nAnother pervasive feature of the prenatal environment is the stimulation provided by\nthe movements of the mother. A number of studies have investigated the effects of movement\nstimulation on young infants after birth. As in the case of presenting heartbeat sounds, the\nresults indicate that rocking a distressed infant has a pacifying effect (Birns, Blank, and\nBridger, 1966; Byrne and Horowitz, 1981), a finding that many caregivers will confirm. The\neffectiveness of rocking increases with increasing amplitude and frequency of the rocking\ncycles/min being the lower- and uppermost limits that were tested in experiments by\nPederson (1975) and Pederson and Ter Vrugt (1973). Rocking of the child's cot has further\nbeen shown to delay the onset of crying in content newborns cared for in the hospital nursery\n(Gordon and Foss, 1966). It should be pointed out that many studies in this field have used\nartificial stimulation sources such as moving cradles rather than human bodies, thus\nexcluding the tactile component that is frequently present when the caregiver rocks the child\non his or her body. It can therefore be concluded that rocking an infant in one's arms has a\ncalming effect not just because it is a form of physical contact, but also because it involves\nthe additional component of movement (see also conclusion by Korner and Thoman, 1972).\nByrne and Horowitz (1981) specifically compared the effectiveness of these two types of\nstimulation in soothing distressed newborns, and found that different forms of rocking while\nholding the child in an upright position on the experimenter's body, quieted the 24- to 72-\nhour-old subjects more quickly than just picking them up and holding them at the\nexperimenter's shoulder. In another U.S. sample of 2- to 5-day-old newborns it was further\nfound that changing the infant's body position was a more powerful soothing method than\nphysical contact alone (Korner and Thoman, 1972). Also, in an experiment on infant\nmonkeys, some of the negative effects of isolation and maternal deprivation, especially the\ntypical stereotyped body-rocking, could be prevented by providing the mother-deprived\nmonkeys with a moving artificial mother surrogate, thus attesting to the central role of\nmovement stimulation in healthy development (Mason and Berkson, 1975).\nSwaddling\nThe fact that infant swaddling has been popular in many cultures and is generally well\naccepted by infants (Lipton, Steinschneider, and Richmond, 1965), is most likely because it\nprovides a feeling of containment similar to that experienced in utero. Giacoman (1971)\nfound that swaddling 5- to 6-week-old American infants significantly reduced their overall\narousal level, including crying, whereas satiation did not have the same effect. These results\nNatural Parenting\nare similar to those of Harlow's (1958) classical studies on isolated infant monkies whereby\ncontact comfort was found to be a more attractive stimulus than food. Lipton, Steinschneider,\nand Richmond (1960), in their study of 2- to 5-day-old neonates, also observed lower activity\nlevels, less crying, and lower heart rates in their subjects during a swaddling condition. These\nfindings provide further support for the view that early postnatal experiences akin to the\nprenatal environment are perceived as comforting by the newborn. It should, however, be\npointed out that, from the current orthopedic viewpoint, tightly swaddling an infant in a\nposition where the legs are fully extended and adducted is considered detrimental to healthy\nContinuous and multi-sensory stimulation\nIn reviewing infant sleep research, Schmidt (1975) concluded that continuous\nstimulation is particularly effective in inducing sleep in infants. The observed effect does not\nseem to be restricted to any particular kind of stimulus, but has, among others, been found to\napply to different auditory stimuli such as heartbeat sounds, metronomes or white noise, as\nwell as rocking movements. Intermittent stimuli, on the other hand, frequently have the\nopposite effect. Brackbill (1971), too, reported that continual auditory stimulation in the form\nof a tape-recorded heartbeat sound, as well as swaddling, pacified 1-month-old infants, and\nthat the soothing effect of continuous stimulation was cumulative across different sensory\nmodalities. For the latter conclusion, Brackbill had also included illumination levels of 400\nW and raised room temperature as other possible forms of \"continuous stimulation\".\nFurthermore, Gatts et al. (1995) tested the effects of a multi-sensory cradle that imitated the\nprenatal environment with a U.S. sample of infants aged 0\u00ad16 weeks. The cradle produced\nintrauterine sounds and random motion, offered tactile containment, and reduced the amount\nof light reaching the child. The intensity of the prenatal-like stimulation as generated by the\nanimated cradle was gradually decreased over the 16-week study period until it finally\nreached zero. Compared to infants placed in regular cribs, infants exposed to the animated\ncradle cried significantly less throughout the time of the study, slept for longer periods at\nnight, and showed more mature responses on parts of the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral\nAssessment Scale at the age of 24 days. All in all, there is much evidence to support the view\nthat young infants, whether awake or asleep, feel comfortable in a milieu that includes fairly\nconstant auditory stimulation, movement and firm tactile contact, especially when the\nproperties of the stimuli resemble characteristics of the prenatal environment.\nHealth Aspects of Natural Parenting\nPhysiological Correlates of Crying\nSupport for the view that crying is not a necessary part of an infant's behavioral\nexpressions in everyday situations but rather an alarm signal reserved for critical\ncircumstances is provided by an examination of the physiological correlates of crying in both\nthe infant and the caregiver exposed to the signal. To begin with, crying is an activity that\nrequires considerable physiological effort. It is an intense state of bodily arousal involving\nincreased heart and lung activity as well as muscle movement and is associated with\nBlass, Brignol, Marino, and Glass, 1993). During crying episodes the child's heart rate rises\n(Pillai and James, 1990; Walsh and Gyulai, 1973) and augmented levels of plasma cortisol\nare observed (Anders, Sachar, Kream, Roffwarg, and Hellman, 1970), while at the same time\nblood oxygen level decreases (Huch and Huch, 1976; Levesque, Pollack, Griffin, and\nNielsen, 2000; Treloar, 1994). During the first few days of life crying can even reestablish a\nNatural Parenting\nfetal pattern of blood flow in the heart, leading to poorly oxygenated blood being returned to\nsystemic circulation rather than flowing to the lungs, with additional negative side-effects on\n1974). On the whole, crying is a taxing experience for the child that is counterproductive to\ngeneral wellbeing and potentially harmful to the organism (see also review: Ludington-Hoe,\nSimilar reactions take place in the person hearing the crying sound. Exposure to an\ninfant's cry generally triggers a response of increased blood pressure and changes in heart\nrate in adults and children of both sexes (Bleichfeld and Moely, 1984; Frodi and Lamb, 1978;\nIn addition, increased skin conductance is observed in the human physiological reaction to a\ncrying infant, a further index of autonomic arousal (Frodi et al., 1978, 1981). For first-time\nparents of young infants, the autonomic response is particularly pronounced (Boukydis and\nBurgess, 1982). Also, the crying of one's own infant evokes more intense arousal than that of\nan unfamiliar child (Wiesenfeld and Klorman, 1978; Wiesenfeld, Malatesta, and DeLoach,\n1981). This complex bodily activation can be interpreted as a general distress reaction, by\nwhich the individual concerned is alerted to take some critical action. Hearing an infant cry\nhas further been found to activate brain areas assumed to be involved in nonhuman\nmammalian parenting behavior (Lorberbaum et al., 2002). Physiological data therefore\nprovide further evidence for the view that the crying stimulus emitted by an infant is meant to\ntrigger immediate action in the caregiveran action that should restore physical contact\nbetween caregiver and infant.\nSkin-to-Skin Care for Preterm Infants\nFor prematurely born infants, the beneficial effects of a postnatal milieu that closely\nresembles the womb experience have already been recognized. Kangaroo mother care, as this\nform of care has been termed, is characterized by extended periods of skin-to-skin contact\nbetween newborn preterm infants and their mothers or fathers (Anderson, G. C., 1991, 1995;\nWHO, 2003). The infant is usually held by the mother in an upright position beneath her\nclothing, between her breasts, and is clad with only a diaper and a hat. Kangaroo care can be\npracticed as soon as the neonate is medically stable enough to be temporarily taken out of the\nincubator, has been used on infants weighing less than 1500 g, and may last for anywhere\nbetween 1 and virtually 24 hours per day. The child's self-regulatory access to breastfeeding\nis encouraged. Research provides clear evidence that premature infants who have received\nkangaroo care in addition to regular hospital care, are advantaged with respect to many\naspects of development (reviews: Anderson, G. C., 1991; Feldman, 2004). For instance, when\nheld skin-to-skin their heart rate and respiration are more stable. In addition, they cry less,\nexperience more deep sleep and alert inactivity, show greater weight gain and are discharged\nearlier from hospital. Kangaroo care further appears to accelerate neuromaturation. Lactation\nis also more successful and lasts longer. Equally important, parents practicing kangaroo care\nseem to bond more easily with their infants and to be more confident in their ability to care\nfor them. Treatments which include only certain aspects of kangaroo care or a combination of\nthese, such as 30\u00ad90 min of daily body stroking and passive movements of the limbs, rocking\nof the premature infant's bed, or the presentation of recorded heartbeat sounds or tapes of the\nmother's voice, administered over variable periods of time, have resulted in similar benefits\nand advances in development (Field et al., 1986; review: Harrison, 1985; review: Ottenbacher\nfull-term neonates derive similar benefits from skin-to-skin contact as preterm infants\nNatural Parenting\nTouch Effects on Physiology\nPhysical growth\nAs already seen in the case of kangaroo care, physical contact is not only reassuring\nfor infants, but also has distinct effects on physiological measures. Both human and animal\nresearch provide convincing evidence that tactile stimulation is also one of the factors\nregulating physical growth in the developing infant. Studies investigating the impact of\nmassage on premature infants have repeatedly reported enhanced growth in infants that have\nreceived extra tactile stimulation (e.g., Field, 2001; Phillips and Moses, 1996; Scafidi et al.,\n1990). According to Field (1995), a certain amount of pressure, however, appears to be\nnecessary for weight gain to take place. Similarly, research regarding the effects of handling\non rats has found that gentled animals are more advanced in skeletal as well as body growth\nWeininger, McClelland, and Arima, 1954). Yet, there has usually been no difference in food\nintake between the experimental and control groups in both human and animal studies.\nThe observed difference in weight gain between handled and unhandled individuals is\nalso reflected in growth hormone levels. As described by Schanberg and Field (review: 1987;\nsee also Evoniuk, Kuhn, and Schanberg, 1979), rat pups that are removed from their mother\nshow a marked decrease in growth hormone secretion, which returns to normal after reunion\nwith the mother. However, firmly stroking the pups with a moist paint brush during maternal\nseparation, thus mimicking the mother's typical caretaking behavior (i.e., licking), has the\nsame effect. Lighter stroking or stimulation of the vestibular or kinesthetic system, on the\nother hand, does not restore hormone values to their usual level, thus clearly attributing the\ngrowth-promoting effect of maternal presence to its tactually stimulating nature.\nA number of other physiological processes in the rat pup are also affected by short-\nterm maternal deprivation (reviews: Schanberg, 1995; Schanberg and Field, 1987). As in the\ncase of altered growth hormone levels, these physiological changes are reversible by reunion\nof the pup with the mother or by heavy tactile stimulation of the pup's skin. For instance,\nseparation from the mother's tactile influence has been found to lead to an immediate\ndecrease in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme involved in the process of\nprotein synthesis and a good indicator of tissue growth and differentiation. The observed\nchange is not attributable to possible variations in body temperature or to the effects of\nexposure to a new environment resulting from maternal separation. Interruption of normal\nfeeding patterns, and lack of olfactory, auditory, and visual maternal cues could be excluded\nas possible mediating factors as well. Further effects of tactual deprivation on rat pups\ninclude selective unresponsiveness of tissue to exogenous growth promoting hormones,\ndecline in the synthesis of DNA in most organ tissues, slowing of insulin catabolism, and\nincreases in corticosterone productionan indicator of stress level. Raised cortisol levels\nduring mother\u00adinfant separation have also been observed in infant squirrel and rhesus\nmonkeys (review: Coe, Wiener, Rosenberg, and Levine, 1985), and lowered levels in\nmassaged human infants (Acolet et al., 1993; Field et al., 1996). However, all of these\nphysiological changes in the rat pups are observed only when maternal separation takes place\nbefore the pups are weaned (Schanberg, 1995). After they reach adulthood it no longer affects\ntheir physiology. Schanberg (1995) describes the observed phenomenon as a switch to\nsurvival mode, a physiological state that aims to conserve energy and water to ensure the\nsurvival of the young in the absence of their mothera reaction that makes perfect sense\nwhen considering that the pups are totally dependent on their mother as a food supplier.\nNatural Parenting\nSchanberg and colleagues (Schanberg, 1995) have also accumulated evidence that -\nendorphin release in the brain is one of the central mechanisms mediating the touch\ndeprivation syndrome, with alterations in gene expression being probable consequences in the\nresulting chain of reactions.\nOther mechanisms underlying the growth-enhancing effect of touch have also been\nproposed. There is, for example, indication that tactile stimulation has an effect on the\ndigestive process, as outlined by Field (2001). Massage is known to increase activity of the\nvagus. Parasympathetic vagal activity in turn facilitates gastric activity and stimulates the\nrelease of hormones responsible for food absorption such as gastrin and insulin (see also\nmight therefore foster growth by making digestion more efficient (see also Uvn\u00e4s-Moberg,\n1997, on the possible mediating effect of oxytocin linking sensory stimulation and increased\nsecretion of vagally-controlled gastrointestinal hormones). Research assessing digestive\nfunctioning in massaged infants provides support for this view. For instance, blood samples\nof massaged preterm cocaine-exposed infants revealed significantly elevated insulin levels\n(unpublished data, T. Field, personal communication, 2003). Similarly, de R\u00f3iste and\nBushnell (1995) found physiological evidence of enhanced digestive functioning in\npremature newborn infants undergoing a tactile stimulation program during their first month\nof life. Field (2001) has further reported preliminary results regarding significantly increased\noxytocin levels in massaged preterm infants.\nIn addition, vagal activity is known to lower physiological arousal and stress hormone\nlevels, and reduced cortisol levels have been observed in diverse groups of subjects following\nmassage (Field, 1998). Decreased cortisol concentrations, in turn, are usually associated with\naugmented levels of oxytocin (Field, 2001), which appears to play a central role in the\ngeneralized relaxation and growth response, a psycho-physiological antistress pattern, the\nexistence of which has been suggested by Uvn\u00e4s-Moberg (1997), as an antipode to the stress\nreaction of the fight-flight response. Uvn\u00e4s-Moberg speculates that the touch involved in\nhuman relationships as well as more general social support, might be important factors in\nincreasing oxytocin release in humans, thus providing one explanation for the health-\npromoting effects of social networks. In the context of mother\u00adinfant interactions, the\nproposed antistress response, possibly activated by pleasant interpersonal experiences\ninvolving close physical contact, can thus be seen as the direct opposite of the survival mode\nof functioning, the physiological response pattern that is observed in mother-deprived (and\ntherefore touch-deprived) rat pups.\nImmunological processes\nImmunological processes are also affected by touch. The outermost layer of the\nhuman skin, the epidermis, has been found to contain a substance akin to the thymus gland\nhormone involved in the process of T-cell differentiation, producing different types of T-cells\nwith a variety of specific immune functions (Chu et al., 1983). A further possible link\nbetween touch and the immune system is cortisol secretion, as decreased cortisol levels,\nwhich have been associated with tactile stimulation, lead to enhanced immune function\n(Field, 1998). Direct investigations into the immunological competence of massaged\nindividuals have confirmed this link. In a study on HIV positive and HIV negative men by\nIronson et al. (1996), a daily massage program of one month's duration was associated with\nsignificantly improved immune function as well as reduced cortisol levels.\nPsychosocial dwarfism\nAlthough much of the research on the physiological effects of touch has been\nconducted on animals, it is conceivable that similar mechanisms operate in humans. For\nNatural Parenting\nexample, the stunted growth and generally retarded development of apparently emotionally\ndeprived children in the absence of any detectable organic disorder and in spite of adequate\nnutrition  often referred to as nonorganic failure to thrive or psychosocial dwarfism\n(Green, W. H., Campbell, and David, 1984; Money, 1992)  may be partly explained by\nthese findings (Schanberg and Field, 1987; Schanberg and Kuhn, 1980). The biochemical\nabnormalities found in these children markedly parallel the physiological consequences of\nmaternal deprivation in rat pups. Not only do these children usually exhibit abnormally low\nlevels of growth hormone and a disturbance in evoked growth hormone secretion, both of\nwhich return to normal when the children are placed in a psychosocially more adequate\nenvironment, which also restores normal growth patterns, but they also frequently show a\npoor response to exogenous growth hormone (Albanese et al., 1994; D'Ercole, Underwood,\nWhile these studies do not allow us to infer how much touch human infants need for\noptimal growth, they do draw attention to the tremendous influence tactile stimulation has on\nmany aspects of early development. Apart from the assumed direct effects of cutaneous\nstimulation on physiology, close contact between caregiver and infant also affects the infant's\nphysiology on many other levels and via other pathways, which shall now be described.\nThermal Regulation\nAs already mentioned, the distribution of body fat of human infants suggests that\nparticularly ventral contact with the caregiver helps to guard young infants against excessive\nloss of body heat (Als, 1977). This has been confirmed by research on preterm (Ludington-\nHoe, Hadeed, and Anderson, 1991) and full-term (Bystrova et al., 2003; Christensson et al.,\nnewborns that those who were transferred to a radiant-heated crib immediately after birth had\nan up to 1.7 \u00b0F (0.9 \u00b0C) lower mean skin temperature than newborns experiencing direct skin-\nto-skin contact on their mothers' stomachs, while ambient temperatures were equal in both\nconditions. Christensson et al. (1992) contrasted direct ventral contact between Spanish\nmothers and their newly born children with an arrangement where the child was kept in a cot\nnext to the mother, observing higher temperatures in the skin-to-skin group, particularly\ntowards the end of the monitored time period of one and a half hours.\nIn addition to serving as a convenient energy source, there are indications that a\nmother's body can even adjust its own temperature according to the infant's thermal needs.\nBauer, K., Pasel and Versmold (1996) compared the chest skin temperature of mothers of\nnewborns on days 1\u00ad5 postbirth to that of men, and of women without newborn children.\nThey found that the new mothers' temperatures showed a steady increase over the examined\nperiod, so that from day 2 they were significantly higher than those of the two other groups.\nMoreover, it is known that a mother's skin temperature increases during breastfeeding, with\noxytocin being one possible mediator of this effect (Marshall, W. M., Cumming, and\nFitzsimmons, 1992). Preliminary analysis of simultaneous temperature recordings of mother\u00ad\ninfant dyads during kangaroo care further suggested the presence of a phenomenon that\nLudington, Anderson, and Hadeed (1989; see also Anderson, G. C., 1995) termed thermal\nsynchrony. At the beginning of a contact period, a rise in skin temperature of both mother and\ninfant was typically observed, with the mother's temperature increasing first, followed by that\nof the infant. For the child, the rise continued slowly and steadily for the first hour of skin-to-\nskin contact. When the child's temperature reached its optimum range, the mother's\ntemperature would decrease again, returning to her own baseline levelunless there was a\nNatural Parenting\ndrop in the infant's temperature, whereupon the mother's temperature would again rise, very\nmuch like a thermostat.\nOrthopedic and Other Health Aspects of Infant Carrying\nSpinal health\nA commonly raised question in the context of infant carrying with the help of a\ncarrying device is whether the practice has been associated with any detrimental effects on\nthe child's health, particularly spinal development. Recommended age at the onset of\ncarrying, daily carrying duration, and optimal carrying positions are frequent topics of\ninquiry. A survey by Kirkilionis (1989) of 190 infants who had been regularly carried\nthroughout their first year of life, and often longer, found no relationship between infant\ncarrying in an upright position and increased spinal problems. The proportion of children in\nthe sample with problems during childhood was in fact considerably lower than that in the\ngeneral population at the time of entry into school. During the child's first year of life, the\nmajority of parents had carried their infants 1\u00ad3\u00bd hours daily in a carrying device, with many\nof them having started the practice during the child's first month of life. A subgroup of\ninfants, however, had been carried for considerably longer periods of time, 5\u00ad8 hours a day,\nin most cases from the first month onward. Even in this group no connection between\nprolonged carrying and increased spinal problems was found.\nHip development\nAs discussed earlier, anatomical details of human infants indicate that infants are best\nadapted to a lateral straddling position on the caregiver's hip (Kirkilionis, 1997a, 1997b). A\ndetailed investigation into the specifics of this mode of infant transport among under-1-year-\nolds has further revealed that the angle between the child's thighs is on average 90\u00b0,\nirrespective of the body proportions of the carrying person and regardless of the child's age\n(Kirkilionis, 1992). 1 The measured values ranged between 35\u00b0 and 58\u00b0 for half the angle (see\nFootnote 1). The flexion of the legs generally reached about 90\u00b0 or somewhat more (when the\nlegs are totally extended the angle is 0\u00b0). It was further found that most children were not\nheld exactly at the side of the caregiver's body, but were slightly displaced to the front. The\nfarther away from the side they were held, the greater the average angle of abduction became\n(e.g., 41.5\u00b0 at the side; 46\u00b0 when displaced up to 30\u00b0). The position of the infant's legs while\nlying unconstrained on the back was similar to that in the straddling position. Abduction\nangles tended to be somewhat lower, particularly after the third month, but the flexion of the\nan ideal position for the optimal development of an infant's hip joints, a position where the\nstrain of the ball-shaped head of the thigh bone is evenly distributed in the cup-shaped hip\nto treat developmental dysplasia of the hip, a condition of an unstable hip where the head of\nthe thigh bone has either slipped from, or is in the danger of slipping from its socket (Ihme,\nSchmidt-Rohlfing, Lorani, and Niethard, 2003). In these cases the thigh bones are secured in\nthe correct position by holding the infant's legs in a flexed and abducted position, usually\nmaintained by the wearing of a splint, harness or cast for prolonged periods of time. An\nincreased incidence of hip dysplasia has been observed in cultures where infants' legs are\nkept in an unphysiological position of extension and adduction for extended periods of time,\n1 In a medically correct way this angle would be represented as 45\u00b0, half of the actual angle, the angle between\none of the thighs and an imagined plane that cuts the body vertically at its midline.\nNatural Parenting\nas occurs when a child is swaddled or constrained in a cradleboard (review: Kirkilionis,\nchildren are carried on their caregivers' bodies with their legs in flexion and abduction, hip\ndysplasia is rarely encountered (Bower, Stanley, and Kricker, 1987; Kirkilionis, 1997b;\nTachdjian, 1990, p. 306). A further advantage of this form of infant transportation,\nparticularly where the child is positioned on the adult's hip, is that impulses from the motion\nof the caregiver's body and from the child's own movements are continuously transmitted to\nthe cartilaginous structure of the infantile hip joints, thus increasing local blood circulation\nand providing stimulation that is beneficial for the development of the hip (Kirkilionis, 2001).\nIn sum, the carrying of an infant in the pictured way can be ascribed therapeutic as well as\nprophylactic qualities.\nCharacteristics of a good carrying device (Figure 4)\nAccording to Kirkilionis (1998, 1999) one important criterion when assessing the\nsuitability of a carrying device is thus whether it supports the anatomically healthy posture of\nflexion and abduction in the child's legs. While infants are able to sustain such a posture\nwithout assistance for a short while, particularly when sitting astride the caregiver's hip, they\nneed support if the position is to be maintained for a longer period of time, or if they are\ncarried face-to-face or on the caregiver's back. Many carrying devices on the market today do\nnot fulfill this crucial feature. Front carriers in particular are often designed in such a way that\nthe infant's legs hang straight down. Furthermore, when a child carried in this type of\ncarrying device is positioned face-to-face and fairly low on the adult's body, then each step of\nthe carrying person presses the child's legs backward, a movement totally counter to an\ninfant's natural range of movements, which is restricted to the front of the body. The infant\nmay try to accommodate to this unphysiological movement by tilting the pelvis forward,\nresulting in a slight \"swayback\" appearance, whereby the shoulders and head fall back, as\nwell. The second important characteristic of a good carrying device is its ability to support\nthe child's back in a sufficient way. When carried upright, the infant's upper body needs to be\nkept straight; this is achieved only when the fabric of the carrier holds the child tightly\nagainst the body of the carrying person. If the carrier leaves too much space between the two\nbodies, the child will assume an undesirable slouching position. Thirdly, the carrier should\nprovide support for the child's head, which is important for young infants, and also when an\nolder child falls asleep while being carried. While young children are usually carried upright,\ninfants may also be carried in a horizontal cradling position.\nNatural Parenting\nFigure 4: An infant in a carrying device that fulfills the three key requirements of a good\ncarrier: correct leg position and sufficient support of the child's back and head.\nMicroenvironment inside a carrier\nIn a German study, Stening, Nitsch, Wassmer, and Roth (2002) investigated the\neffects of carrying infants in a carrying device on their oxygen saturation and heart rate. The\nresearchers compared the cardiorespiratory measures of term and preterm infants of 6\u00ad113\ndays postnatal age under three conditions: carried vertically or horizontally in an infant\ncarrier, or placed laterally in a pram. They found that the use of the carrying device was not\nassociated with any clinically relevant changes in the recorded measures.\nGastroesophageal reflux and otitis media\nTasker et al. (2002a, 2002b) have established that reflux of gastric contents into the\nmiddle ear can be a major factor in the development of otitis media with effusion in young\nchildren. Gastroesophageal reflux is common in young infants (Orenstein and Shalaby,\n1996). As infants are frequently placed lying in the supine position, the immaturity and angle\nof the eustachian tube make possible further reflux of gastric juice from the nasopharynx into\nthe middle ear (Tasker et al., 2002b). Damage to the eustachian tube and the mucosa of the\nmiddle ear are likely consequences, causing inflammation, and thus facilitating secondary\nbacterial colonization, finally leading to so-called glue ear (Tasker et al., 2002a, 2002b).\nInfant carrying on the body of the caregiver, which favors a nonhorizontal position in the\nchild, can therefore be viewed as a potential preventive measure against such a condition.\nInfant Toilet TrainingElimination Communication\nExtended physical closeness between caregiver and child also facilitates a natural\napproach to toilet training that is still commonly used in many non-industrial societies\n(Bauer, I., 2001; Boucke, 2002; Rugolotto, Ball, Boucke, Sun, and deVries, in press).\nNatural Parenting\nContrary to common belief, infants have been found to be aware of their elimination\nfunctions from birth, and to have some degree of control over their sphincter muscles from\nvery early on. Most infants signal in some way immediately prior to, during, or right after\nurinating and defecating. Some cues are very obvious whereas others may be more subtle.\nPossible signals include different facial expressions, flushing, tightening of abdominal\nmuscles, shivering, changes in breathing, behavioral changes such as momentary quieting or\nrestlessness, and vocal cues such as grunting, crying, squealing, sighing, or uttering a special\ntoilet sound. By being sensitive to the infant's elimination cues, and by becoming aware of\nthe child's elimination patterns over the course of a day, it is possible for the caregiver to\nidentify and respond to the infant's elimination needs. The response takes the form of\nsupporting the child in a suitable position over a container while possibly giving the child an\nadditional vocal or verbal cue, for instance, a \"ssssss\"-sound or a short sentence such as \"Do\nyou have to pee?\" (see Figure 5 for different possible elimination locations and positions).\nWithin a short time, the child will learn to associate the particular position, location, or sound\nwith toilet activity and start to eliminate on cue. Over time, the child will also communicate\nto the caregiver with increasing clarity his or her need for voiding and defecation in advance.\nAfter caregiver and child have learned to tune in with each other regarding toilet\nmatters, this mutual process of reading and responding to each other's clues will result in\nmost eliminations taking place at the desired location or over the chosen receptacle.\n\"Accidents\" can be expected in the early training phase, but will decrease in frequency over\ntime. In this context, many caregivers choose to use diapers as a backup in case they miss\ntheir infant's signals, during the night, or in situations where soiling or wetting would be\ntroublesome, as during travel, or when they know that they will not be able to attend to their\ninfant's toilet needs. Many parents using this approach, however, have their child go\ndiaperless at least part of the time.\nChildren toilet-trained in this way complete toilet training anywhere between the age\nof 6 months and 2 years. Western parents practicing elimination communication commonly\nreport reasonable daytime continence before the age of 18 months (L. Boucke, personal\ncommunication, 2006). In many non-industrialized societies where infants are frequently\nbare-bottomed and where suitable locations for evacuation are not as narrowly defined as in\nindustrialized societies, many mothers will report toilet training to be completed at 6\u00ad12\nmonths (see also deVries and deVries, 1977). Daytime dryness is usually accomplished\nbefore nighttime dryness. Even after the achievement of reasonable dryness, very young\nchildren obviously still need assistance from their caregiver with undressing and re-dressing,\nwith transportation to the toilet place in time, and with positioning during elimination.\nThe approach in question can be implemented from birth, and should ideally be\nstarted during the first few months of life for its full benefits to be derived. When infants are\ninstead allowed to eliminate into diapers as a rule, they gradually lose sensitivity to their\nelimination functions, thus rendering conventional toilet training later in toddlerhood more\nchallenging. However, part-time toilet training in infancy on a fairly consistent basis is a\npossible alternative.\nElimination communication is a gentle and respectful way of dealing with one of the\nbasic bodily needs of an infant, and is based on a team effort of mutual trust, intimacy, and\ncontinued communication. It asks for a committed and patient caregiver with a relaxed\nattitude towards the occasional slips that are an inevitable part of the process. It is pointed out\nthat the described approach should not be confused with the harsh and rigid early toilet\ntraining method of the early 20th century informed by behaviorist psychology (as reviewed by\ndeVries and deVries, 1977). Although toilet training in infancy is time consuming, it should\nbe borne in mind that toilet training will take time whatever the approach. An advantage of\nstarting early is that infants are well aware of their toilet needs, cooperative, and willing to be\nNatural Parenting\npart of the process, whereas toddlers typically show only little interest in complying with\ntoilet training. Moreover, conventional toilet training can be confusing for the child: What\nused to be acceptable behavior (soiling diapers) suddenly becomes unacceptable after a\ncertain age.\nHow gentle, early toilet training can be implemented within the context of Western\nindustrialized societies has been described in detail in two recent popular books (Bauer, I.,\n2001; Boucke, 2002). In the professional literature regarding infant care, however, infant as\nopposed to toddler elimination training has, except for sporadic mentioning (e.g., Ainsworth,\nattention until recently. In those instances where the topic has been discussed, the authors\nhave usually referred to parenting practices in non-Western cultures. Many of the reports\nhave been anecdotal. However, contributions discussing infant toilet training in a Western\ncontext are now starting to appear (Rugolotto et al., in press; Sun and Rugolotto, 2004), and\nwith the first large-scale study of infant toilet training based on a predominantly Western\nsample now completed (L. Boucke, personal communication, 2006), data is finally available\nto confirm many of the propositions made by earlier, less systematic reports. At the same\ntime, these findings also challenge the current pediatric viewpoint that children are not ready\nfor toilet training until the age of 18\u00ad24 months (American Academy of Pediatrics, 1998;\nFigure 5: Elimination communication/infant toilet training: different possible elimination\nlocations and positions for supporting an infant during urination or defecation.

In one study, cosleeping children spent 28\u00ad99% of the night in physical contact with\ntheir mothers, compared to only 2\u00ad14% when spending the night alone in a separate room\n(McKenna et al., 1994). Furthermore, bed sharing infants breastfeed about twice as often as\nregular solitary sleepers, with the total duration of nightly nursing episodes amounting to\nalmost three times of what is observed in lone sleep conditions (McKenna, Mosko, and\nRichard, 1997). Cosleeping infants are also less likely to be placed in the prone position, and\nlie most of the night facing their mothers, commonly near breast level, which may be\nattributable to the facilitation of breastfeeding in such positions (Richard, Mosko, McKenna,\nand Drummond, 1996). Mothers, too, face their cosleeping infants about 74% of the time, and\nwhen lying face-to-face, the bed sharing partners are most typically at a distance of 11\u00ad30 cm\nfrom each other (Richard et al., 1996). In addition, mothers inspect and adjust their infants'\nsleep environment by actions such as repositioning or reblanketing considerably more often\nduring bed sharing than when sleeping separately from their infants, and frequently display\naffectional behaviors such as hugging, rocking, kissing, patting, whispering, speaking or\nsinging that are rarely exhibited when mother and child sleep in separate rooms. The great\nmajority of these behaviors take place in reaction to infant movements or sounds (McKenna,\nMosko, and Richard, 1999). Bed sharing is also associated with more frequent arousals\nduring stages of deep sleep in the infant (Mosko, Richard, and McKenna, 1997a). While\nmothers also experience a greater number of arousals during bed sharing, these are shorter in\nduration than those occurring during solitary sleep (Mosko, Richard, and McKenna, 1997b).\nTherefore, mothers who cosleep with their children get as much sleep as non-cosleeping\nmothers (Mosko et al., 1997b). A substantial temporal overlap of maternal and infant\nepisodes of arousal is also observed during cosleeping (Mosko et al., 1997a, 1997b). A\nfurther effect of bed sharing on the infant is an increase in light sleep and a decrease in deep\nsleep, and particularly a decrease in the mean duration of episodes of deep sleep (Mosko,\nRichard, McKenna, and Drummond, 1996). Lastly, cosleeping children have been found to\nhave a higher incidence of central apnea and periodic breathing (Richard, Mosko, and\nMcKenna, 1998), which seems to constitute the only potential disadvantage of mother\u00adinfant\ncosleeping. However, fewer obstructive apneas have been observed for routinely solitary\nsleeping infants during a night of bed sharing (Richard et al., 1998).\nEven though the phenomenon of the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is not yet\nfully understood, the major perceived causal deficit appears to be a delayed maturation, or\nmaldevelopment, of the brainstem neural network responsible for cardiorespiratory control\nand functions regulating arousal (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000, 2005b; see also\nLipsitt, 2003). When the physiological equilibrium of infants with such a condition becomes\ncompromised during sleep, these children may not be able to arouse sufficiently to survive a\nnoxious insult to their system. Rebreathing of their own exhaled CO2\nand associated\nhypercarbia and hypoxia, as well as overheating, have been suggested as possible precursors\nto the fatal condition in these individuals. Within this context, the sensory-rich sleep\nenvironment of bed sharing, which leads to more frequent arousals during deep sleep and\nmore light sleep, from which it is easier for the infant to arouse, appears to confer a survival\nMcKenna et al., 1993). In addition, cosleeping mothers usually place their infants in a\nnonprone position, a practice that has been associated with a decreased risk of SIDS\n(American Academy of Pediatrics, 2005b). While the reported higher frequency of central\napnea and periodic breathing among bed sharing infants may seem a possible drawback of\nthis type of sleeping arrangement, the evidence linking these events to an increased SIDS risk\nis far from conclusive. In a large-scale study of 757 SIDS cases and 1514 controls, for\nNatural Parenting\ninstance, apnea did not emerge as a particularly strong risk factor (Hoffman, Damus,\nHillman, and Krongrad, 1988). Findings from research on infant breathing and mechanisms\nof thermoregulation further suggest that periodic breathing is related to temperature control\nand is in fact normal and common in healthy infants (Johnson and Andrews, 1992).\nCross-cultural comparisons (review: Davies, D. P., 1994; Gantley, Davies, and\nMurcott, 1993; review: McKenna and Mosko, 1990) support McKenna's theory. Societies or\nparts of societies in which mother\u00adinfant cosleeping is widely practiced, generally have a\nrelatively low incidence of SIDS compared to cultures that encourage solitary infant sleep.\nThis is the case despite the fact that these people often live in suboptimal conditions, which\nwould be expected to predispose them to increased infant mortality (Davies, D. P., 1994).\nDiscrepancies regarding the way incidents of SIDS are defined and recorded in different\ncountries, however, may also account for some of the differences in the reported rates\nIn instances where regular cosleeping has been linked to a heightened occurrence of\nSIDS, other known risk factors such as maternal smoking during or after pregnancy, or poor\nprenatal care were concurrently present or likely to be present and may thus have overridden\nthe potential benefits of bed sharing (Blair et al., 1999; Carpenter et al., 2004; Fleming et al.,\nof overlying by the parent in a bed sharing environment is not unheard of, unsafe conditions\nsuch as parental intoxication with drugs or alcohol, parental disease, extreme parental fatigue,\nor marked parental obesity have been found to be present in many of these cases (Bass,\nGessner, Ives, and Perham-Hester, 2001). There is therefore no reason to indiscriminately\nadvise against bed sharing (McKenna and Gartner, 2000). All in all, when general safety\nrecommendations are followed (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000, 2005b), most of\nwhich apply equally to solitary as well as social sleep conditions (i.e., supine sleep position;\nuse of a firm mattress in a tight-fitting frame, at a distance from the wall or other furniture to\navoid entrapment; no waterbed, see also Gilbert-Barness et al., 1991; avoidance of loose\nbedding, pillows, stuffed toys, and other soft materials in the sleeping environment;\navoidance of overheating; avoidance of smoking by the bed sharing parent who needs to\nensure that her/his ability to arouse from sleep is not impaired; strict avoidance of cosleeping\non a couch or an armchair), it seems that bed sharing can confer a number of benefits to the\ninfant, including the emotional benefits of enhanced closeness, particularly when practiced in\ntandem with breastfeeding.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), while stating in the year 2000 (p. 654)\nthat \"there are insufficient data to conclude that bed sharing under carefully controlled\nconditions is clearly hazardous or clearly safe\", after having considered new evidence, now\nrecommends against bed sharing in its latest policy statement on SIDS (American Academy\nof Pediatrics, 2005b). The AAP acknowledges that bed sharing facilitates breastfeeding and\nenhances mother\u00adinfant bonding, but refers to two studies in particular (Carpenter et al.,\n2004; Tappin, Ecob, and Brooke, 2005) showing that bed sharing remains a risk factor for\nSIDS even among nonsmoking mothers. In Carpenter et al.'s sample this association held\ntrue only for infant up to the age of 8 weeks, and in Tappin et al.'s study for infants aged 11\nweeks or younger (in the latter case, the three examined age groups of <6 weeks, 6\u00ad11 weeks,\nand >11 weeks were chosen arbitrarily). Furthermore, data on all known factors involved in\nhazardous bed sharing were not available for inclusion in the analyses of either study. In\naddition to maternal smoking, Carpenter et al. included maternal alcohol and illegal drug use,\nbut for instance mentioned that they had no data on maternal fatigue. Tappin et al.\nspecifically stated that they had not collected data on alcohol consumption because of the\ndifficulty of obtaining reliable information on this variable. This statement demonstrates a\nNatural Parenting\nfundamental problem inherent in investigations of SIDS cases: Information most critical for\nfull understanding of the phenomenon is most difficult to obtain and is thus missing from\nmany studies, thus rendering the results of such studies of limited use. Carpenter et al.'s study\nhas further been criticized for assessing maternal smoking based on smoking status during\npregnancy rather than at time of death, yet postpartum relapse to smoking is common among\nwomen who quit smoking when pregnant (UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative, 2004b).\nNeither did Carpenter et al. distinguish between bed sharing in an adult bed and cosleeping\non a couch or other sleep surfaces that are known to be hazardous (UNICEF UK Baby\nFriendly Initiative, 2004a). In sum, these two recent studies have raised as many questions as\nthey have answered and have thus not been able to contribute much new information to\nadvance our understanding of SIDS. See also McKenna and McDade (2005) for an excellent\ndiscussion of the cosleeping controversy.\nAlthough the AAP recommends against parent\u00adinfant bed sharing, they do state that\nmothers may temporarily bring their infants into their bed for comforting or nursing until they\nare ready to go back to sleep. They also point to increasing evidence that infants who sleep\nalone in a separate room have an increased SIDS risk, and therefore advise parents to keep\nthe infant's crib or bassinet in their own bedroom, close to the parental bed if desired,\nallowing for more convenient contact and breastfeeding. For those having reservations about\nbed sharing, keeping the infant outside the parental bed but within close proximity is thus a\npossible compromise that still allows parents to sensitively tend to their children's nighttime\nneeds.\nBreastfeeding\nBenefits for the child\nProponents of natural parenting place great emphasis on the value of extended\nbreastfeeding, and much scientific evidence has accumulated to support this view. Overall,\nthere is general agreement that breast milk provides the ideal nutrition for a nursling, and is\npreferable to any kind of artificial formula (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2005a;\nRodriguez-Palmero et al., 1999). Also, breast milk is not a uniform fluid its composition\nchanges according to the time of the day, within a feeding session, and as lactation proceeds\n(Lawrence, 1994). Changes in milk composition with stage of lactation appear to correspond\nto the changing nutritional needs of the growing child (Kunz, Rodriguez-Palmero, Koletzko,\nBreast milk further forms easily digestible curds (Lawrence, 1994, p. 112) and is\ncomposed in such a way that its nutrients can be very well utilized by the body (L\u00f6nnerdal,\n2003). It also protects the infant's intestines from infections by promoting a microflora of\nbeneficial bacteria and by inhibiting the growth of potentially pathogenic organisms\n(Kleessen, Bunke, Tovar, Noack, and Sawatzki, 1995; Liepke et al., 2002). Moreover, breast\nmilk provides the infant with a host of immunoactive substances that support the child's\nimmature immune system and protect against infections (Garofalo and Goldman, 1999;\nGoldman, Chheda, and Garofalo, 1998). As mother and infant typically share a common\nmilieu, the mother's milk is perfectly suited to offer protection against precisely those\nmicroorganisms that occupy the child's immediate environment. Even if the child is exposed\nto a germ the mother has not been exposed to, the intimate contact with the mother is likely to\ntransfer the pathogen to the mother, who, as a result, will produce the correct antibodies and\ndeliver them to her child via her milk (Goldman et al., 1998; Tronick, Winn, and Morelli,\n1985). The protective nature of breast milk is also reflected in the fact that breastfed infants\nhave repeatedly been shown to have reduced morbidity from a wide range of diseases\n(Beaudry, Dufour, and Marcoux, 1995; Cunningham, 1977; review: Cunningham, Jelliffe,\nNatural Parenting\nand Jelliffe, 1991; review: Heinig and Dewey, 1996). Sucking at the mother's breast also\nencourages proper development of facial structures, as reflected in its beneficial effects on\ndental development (Davis and Bell, 1991; Labbok and Hendershot, 1987). Finally, traces of\nbenzodiazepine2-like compounds have been detected in human breast milk, thus pointing to a\nrelaxation effect in the infant following the ingestion of breast milk (Dencker, Johansson, and\nBenefits for the mother\nThe mother also benefits from nursing her infant. Women who breastfeed appear less\nlikely to develop ovarian cancer (Gwinn, Lee, Rhodes, Layde, and Rubin, 1990; John,\nWhittemore, Harris, Itnyre, and Collaborative Ovarian Cancer Group, 1993) and breast\nNewcomb et al., 1994). Moreover, the newborn's sucking at the mother's breast soon after\nbirth causes the uterus to contract, decreases blood flow (Chua, Arulkumaran, Lim, Selamat,\nand Ratnam, 1994; Matthiesen, Ransj\u00f6-Arvidson, Nissen, and Uvn\u00e4s-Moberg, 2001) and thus\nspeeds the mother's recovery. Extended, frequent breastfeeding also delays the onset of\nKonner and Worthman, 1980; McNeilly, Tay, and Glasier, 1994; Stern, Konner, Herman, and\nReichlin, 1986; World Health Organization Task Force on Methods for the Natural\nRegulation of Fertility, 1998), thereby decreasing the likelihood of a new pregnancy, and thus\nhelping to ensure the mother's maximum attention for her youngest child. Breastfeeding\nfurther appears to have a relaxing effect on the mother (Altemus, Deuster, Galliven, Carter,\nUvn\u00e4s-Moberg, 1996) and as a result helps her to cope with the increased demands inherent\nin infant care. Even though the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are not yet fully\nunderstood, the beneficial effects of breastfeeding on maternal mood can most likely be\nattributed to prolactin, oxytocin, and cholecystokinin (Amico et al., 1994; Legros, Chiodera,\nduring breastfeeding (McNeilly, Robinson, Houston, and Howie, 1983; Uvn\u00e4s-Moberg, 1987;\nUvn\u00e4s-Moberg, Widstr\u00f6m, Werner, Matthiesen, and Winberg, 1990; Weitzman, Leake,\nOn-demand feeding\nIn addition to its physiological advantages, breastfeeding has the added benefit of\nbeing cost-free and instantly available. At the same time, a mother's milk supply is generally\nable to fully meet her infant's nutritional needs, as long as the child is allowed to nurse on\ndemand, because milk production is regulated by how much and how often the infant feeds\nPrentice, and Peaker, 1995; Woolridge, Phil, and Baum, 1993). The more the child nurses,\nthe more milk is produced. Also, the storage capacity of the mother's breasts, which is related\nto her breast size, plays an important role in determining the optimal frequency of breastfeeds\nnecessary to fulfill her infant's nutritional needs (Daly et al., 1993). Thus, restricting either\nthe duration or the frequency of breastfeeds is likely to disturb the delicate balance of this\nself-regulatory system and can lead to problems such as breast engorgement or insufficient\nfeeding length, in particular, may also lead to the infant receiving less of the fat-rich\nhindmilk, an important source of energy (Woolridge and Fisher, 1988). Keeping the child\n2 A class of drugs also known as tranquilizers\nNatural Parenting\nphysically close during both day and night naturally facilitates the interactive process of\nfeeding on cue.\nThe value of unrestricted feeding and the supporting role of close maternal\u00adinfant\ncontact has been recognized by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United\nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In a joint statement they recommend on-demand\nbreastfeeding and rooming-in around the clock as the desired form of care for all healthy\nneonates on maternity wards as a means of optimally supporting lactation (WHO, 1989).\nRecommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2005a) for the neonatal period\nare along the same lines. The latter organization further states that crying is a late sign of\nhunger, and that behavioral indicators such as increased activity and alertness, rooting, or\nmouthing that precede it should be sufficient to alert the mother to the nutritional needs of her\nnewborn.\nFinally, nursing on cue leads on average to more frequent feedings than does feeding\na child by schedule every 3\u00ad4 hr, with 10 or more nursing episodes a day being common\nduring the first few months of life (Barr and Elias, 1988; D\u00edaz et al., 1995; Elias, Nicholson,\np. 317) on the possible relationship between widely-spaced feedings of relatively large\nquantities and the frequent vomiting of milk that is typically observed in young human\ninfants also suggest that a pattern of shorter, but more frequent feeds may come closer to the\ninnate feeding style of the human infant. The clinical recommendation to offer frequent\nfeedings of relatively small size as a measure to reduce excessive gastroesophageal reflux in\nchildren (Herbst, 1981) supports Blurton Jones' view. See also Gussler and Briesemeister\n(1980) for a comprehensive treatise of the complexities involved in successful breastfeeding\nand the possible pitfalls of a deviation from natural breastfeeding patterns.\nWeaning\nAs to the optimum duration of breastfeeding, an investigation into the role of breast\nmilk in the diet of children aged 2 years or younger has concluded that human milk can make\na valuable contribution to the infant's nutrition well beyond the age of 12 months (Dewey,\n2001). It is further known that it takes a few years before the child's own immune system\nachieves full maturity (Buckley, R. H., 2000; Davies, E. G., 1998), so that breastfeeding can\nbe assumed to provide distinct health benefits to the breastfed child well into early childhood\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics' (2005a) official policy statement on\n\"Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk\" concludes that breast milk is ideal and sufficient\nnutrition for approximately the child's first 6 months of life. It further recommends\n\"breastfeeding ... [to] be continued for at least the first year of life and beyond for as long as\nmutually desired by mother and child\" (p. 499). The American Academy of Pediatrics also\ntakes a clear position regarding toddler nursing by stating that \"there is no upper limit to the\nduration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychologic or developmental harm from\nWorld Health Assembly, 2001, 2002) advises the cessation of exclusive breastfeeding and the\nintroduction of appropriate complementary foods at the age of 6 months, while continuing\nbreastfeeding until the age of 2 years or beyond.\nPsychological Correlates of Natural Parenting\nMother\u00adInfant Interaction and Attachment\nSensitive parenting and secure attachment\nNatural Parenting\nThere is broad agreement that the quality of care a child receives early in life\ninfluences the child's chances of developing a secure attachment relationship to the caregiver\nattachment relationships in infancy, in turn, have been linked to different aspects of adaptive\nfunctioning later in life, particularly if parenting behaviors conducive to secure attachment\ncontinue to prevail during later stages of development (reviews: Thompson, 1999; Weinfield,\nSroufe, Egeland, and Carlson, 1999; see also Carlson, Sroufe, and Egeland, 2004).\nAinsworth, Bell, and Stayton (1971, 1974) identified the mother's sensitivity to her child's\nsignals, as well as her acceptance, cooperation, and accessibility, as central factors in the\ndevelopment of attachment security, with maternal sensitivity playing a particularly\nimportant role. Ainsworth et al. (1974, p. 127) originally defined maternal sensitivity as \"the\nmother's ability to perceive and to interpret accurately the signals and communications\nimplicit in her infant's behaviour, and given this understanding, to respond to them\nappropriately and promptly\". Ainsworth et al. (1974) further specified that the mother's\nsensitivity appeared to be a key indicator of the quality of maternal interactive behavior, in\nthe sense that caregivers who were highly sensitive were also, without exceptions, rated high\nin the three other dimensions, whereas caregivers with low ratings in any of the three other\ndimensions also received a low rating in sensitivity. Studies among infant populations from\ndifferent cultures have generally provided evidence for the universality of the sensitivity\u00ad\nsecurity link, although the great majority of research has been conducted in Western\nindustrialized societies and data from other cultural contexts are very limited (for overviews,\nsee De Wolff and van IJzendoorn, 1997; Posada et al., 2002). Yet, experimental evidence\nfrom intervention studies aimed at enhancing maternal sensitivity also supports the causal\nlink between sensitivity and attachment security (review: Bakermans-Kranenburg, van\nThe results of De Wolff and van IJzendoorn's (1997) meta-analysis on antecedents of\ninfant attachment security, however, led the investigators to conclude that maternal\nsensitivity as originally defined by Ainsworth et al. (1974, p. 127) cannot be considered the\nonly important factor influencing the development of secure infant attachment. Other related\naspects of maternal interactive behavior such as synchrony, mutuality, emotional support,\npositive attitude, and stimulation were also identified as making significant contributions. De\nWolff and van IJzendoorn further pointed out that the wider context of parenting needs to be\ntaken into account as well.\nMaternal sensitivity has indeed been operationalized in myriad ways in the wave of\nresearch that has followed the initial Baltimore study by Ainsworth et al. (1978), and has led\nto numerous interrelated caregiving attributes being associated with the concept (Nicholls and\nKirkland, 1996). Critical voices in the field now call for a reassessment of its definition,\nurging a departure from a narrow conceptualization of maternal sensitivity and instead\nfavoring a more holistic approach that views maternal sensitivity as a multifaceted dyadic\nconcept that unfolds in the interaction between mother and child, manifesting itself in\ndifferent ways depending on the developmental level of the child and on the exact nature of\nthe situation in question (Nicholls and Kirkland, 1996; Thompson, 1997; van den Boom,\n1997). More specifically, van den Boom views sensitivity as being relevant to all interactive\nbehavior (i.e., play, instruction, stimulation, etc.) rather than as a parenting dimension\nexisting apart from other dimensions. She describes appropriateness, promptness, and\nconsistency of maternal behavior as the main constituent parts of sensitivity across all aspects\nof parenting. If defined in this broad way, maternal sensitivity would also encompass many,\nif not all, of the other significant maternal attributes identified in De Wolff and van\nIJzendoorn's (1997) research. In this sense, maternal sensitivity can still be seen as a key\ndetermining factor of an infant's attachment security. Confirming evidence comes from a\nNatural Parenting\nrecent large-scale investigation (of more than 1,000 infants) that operationalized maternal\nsensitivity in exactly such a broad way and also found that sensitivity was the pre-eminent\npredictor of attachment security (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997).\nWhereas infants with secure attachment relationships (as assessed by the traditional\nStrange Situation procedure developed by Ainsworth et al., 1978, where infants are observed\nduring a short separation from their caregiver and their subsequent reunion) are able to rely\non their caregivers as available sources of protection and comfort whenever needed, thus\nfreeing energy for their expanding explorations of the surrounding world and encouraging a\nconfident stance vis-\u00e0-vis the world (Bowlby, 1973, 1982), children with relatively\ninsensitive mothers have quite different early experiences. Their attachment relationships are\ndescribed as insecure, and their developing patterns of behavior can be viewed as adaptations\nto the deficient parenting strategies of their caregivers (Main, 1990). In normative\npopulations, two basic forms of insecurity have been discerned on the basis of the Strange\nSituation assessment procedure.\nAvoidant attachment develops in an atmosphere of relatively cold and rejecting\ncaregiving (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Mothers of avoidantly attached infants have been\nportrayed as having an aversion to close bodily contact, as often showing a lack of emotional\nexpressivity, as being insensitive to their infants' signals, as vocalizing frequently, but\nnoncontingently, and as being fairly rigid, compulsive, interfering, and overstimulating in\ntheir interactions with their infants (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Belsky, Rovine, and Taylor,\nResistant attachment, in turn, is associated with inconsistent and unpredictable\ninteractive behavior, apparent underinvolvement of the caregiver, and interference with infant\nAccording to Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) investigation, mothers of resistant infants are also\nrelatively insensitive to their infants' signals (see also Belsky et al., 1984), but clearly less\nrejecting than mothers of avoindantly attached infants. Mothers of resistant infants have no\naversion to close physical contact, but are inept in holding their infants, and manifest only\nlittle affectionate behavior during bodily contact (Ainsworth et al., 1978). In response to their\ninconsistently or minimally responsive parents, resistantly attached infants are found to apply\na strategy of increased display of dependence on the caregiver, exaggerated signaling, and\nhypervigilance (Cassidy and Berlin, 1994; Main, 1990). More specifically, heightened\nmonitoring of the mother as well as fearfulness and inhibition in exploration with both peers\nand toys are typical features of these children (Cassidy and Berlin, 1994). During the Strange\nSituation procedure, interaction- and contact-resisting behavior mixed with contact-seeking\nbehavior, and angry, or conspicuously passive behavior have also been observed (Ainsworth\nFinally, a category of disorganized attachment (added later to complement the\nclassical three-category classification; Main and Solomon, 1990) describes infant\u00adcaregiver\nrelationships that are highly dysfunctional, with the children being at risk for later\npsychopathology (Carlson, 1998; van IJzendoorn, Schuengel, and Bakermans-Kranenburg,\n1999). Infants with a disorganized pattern of behavior lack a coherent attachment strategy and\ndisplay odd and chaotic behavior during the Strange Situation procedure (Main and Solomon,\n1990). Disoriented, frightened, frightening, or extremely insensitive, disrupted parental\nbehavior appears to lie at the roots of disorganized attachment (Carlson, 1998; Lyons-Ruth,\nBronfman, and Parsons, 1999; Madigan, Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, Moran,\nAs infants with insecure attachment relationships have a less consistent experience of\na reliably available caregiver who provides comfort in the face of possible threats, an\nNatural Parenting\nunderlying anxiousness about the availability of their caregiver is thought to be the result,\nkeeping them from exploring their environment without worry and thus preventing them from\nachieving the same mastery of their surrounding world and confidence in themselves that\nproposed that these early experiences of different degrees of insensitive or sensitive care\ncontribute to the development of internal working models of relationships and the self, that is,\ninternalized expectations regarding the responsiveness and accessability of the caregiver and,\nultimately, people in general, as well as beliefs concerning one's deservingness of such\ntreatment. These mental representations are presumed to guide interpretations of one's social\nenvironment as well as social behavior, with the resulting interactions further consolidating\none's assumptions about oneself and others, thus easily leading to a self-perpetuating\nfeedback cycle (see also Thompson, 1999).\nParental responsiveness and infant crying\nOne aspect of sensitive caregiving, namely promptness of parental response to infant\nsignals, has been researched in some detail. More specifically, there has been some debate in\nthe field as to whether prompt responsiveness to infant distress would lead to a decrease or an\nincrease in infant distress vocalizations. Overall, amount of crying is highest during the early\nweeks and decreases with increasing age (Bell and Ainsworth, 1972; van IJzendoorn and\nHubbard, 2000). The position of researchers informed by a behavior analytical perspective\nhas been that consistent and prompt responding should in fact increase crying by providing\nreinforcement for the behavior (e.g., Etzel and Gewirtz, 1967; Gewirtz and Boyd, 1977).\nCorrespondingly, ignoring crying should result in a decrease in the amount of crying\nobserved. Two basic types of crying have been identified in children: crying caused by\nphysical distress, and so-called nondistress crying in the absence of any apparent physical\nconcern (Gewirtz and Boyd, 1977). The latter type is frequently assumed to be easily\namenable to parental reinforcement (i.e., consistent parental response), supposedly leading to\nincreased crying and a \"spoiled\" child. The distinction made is problematic in that it\ndiscounts emotional causes for distress, such as an inherent need for physical contact with the\ncaregiver for emotional security (Bowlby, 1982). In their experimental analysis of infant\ncrying, Etzel and Gewirtz (1967) focused on nondistress or operant crying, and found that\ncrying duration could indeed be changed by behavioral modification. However, their study\nwas restricted to two institutionalized infants, and the extinction of crying had been coupled\nwith the reinforcement of smiling.\nIn one of the first naturalistic, longitudinal studies exploring the connection between\nsensitive parental responsiveness and infant crying, Bell and Ainsworth (1972) conducted in-\ndepth home observations of 26 mother\u00adinfant dyads spanning the children's first year of life.\nTheir finding was that consistent and prompt maternal response to infant distress earlier on\nwas associated with both a relatively low frequency and a relatively short duration of crying\nand fussing in subsequent months. However, the study has been criticized on methodological\nIn a replication of Bell and Ainsworth's seminal Baltimore study with a larger sample\nof 50 Dutch families, van IJzendoorn and Hubbard (2000) were able to use more reliable and\npowerful statistical methods in their analyses and were further able to control for possible\nconfounding variables. Contrary to expectations, they observed that more frequent ignoring\nof the infants' crying by their mothers during the first 9 weeks of life was related to less\nfrequent crying in the following 9 weeks. In general, however, throughout the first 9 months,\nearlier crying was the best predictor of later crying. Only during the first 18 weeks was\nmaternal unresponsiveness able to explain an additional 10% of the observed variance in\ncrying. Moreover, van IJzendoorn and Hubbard's study revealed that crying behavior at home\nNatural Parenting\nwas not significantly related to attachment status at 15 months, whereas Ainsworth et al.\n(1978) as well as Belsky et al. (1984) had found that securely attached infants cried less at\nhome than insecurely attached infants. Finally, van IJzendoorn and Hubbard also reported\nthat mothers of infants classified as avoidant were most prompt in responding to their infants'\ncrying.\nIn a number of other studies, prompt parental response to infant distress (in terms of\nboth an attitude and explicitly measured behavior) has been associated with relatively lower\nfrequencies and shorter durations of concurrently measured fussing and crying in the infant\nand Ainsworth (1972) of the quality of infant\u00admother communication in their Baltimore\nsample further indicated that high maternal responsiveness not only reduced crying but was\nalso associated with maternal sensitivity to other social signals of the child, thus resulting in\nmore varied ways of communication. This result is congruent with the findings of a study on\nnewborns 1\u00ad2 hr postbirth showing that the infants displayed many cues and signs of distress\nover a time span of 4\u00ad71 min (M = 31 min) before resorting to full-blown crying to\ncommunicate their needs (Gill, White, and Anderson, 1984).\nIf crying is viewed as an honest indicator of infant distress (either emotional or\nphysical in nature), it appears plausible that prompt responding to a child's needs by a mother\nwho does her best to correctly interpret her infant's signals should, over time, lead to\nincreasingly refined communication between the two parties, and to only minimal crying and\nsecure attachment in the child. Why, then, do some findings depart from the observed overall\npattern? A few possible explanations are introduced in the following.\nFirst, it should be considered that the absence of crying in an infant may mean\ndifferent things under different circumstances. Whereas relatively little crying in a sensitively\nmothered infant would be interpreted as reflecting emotional security, nobody would argue\nthat the apathetic appearance and minimal crying in socioemotionally deprived infants in\ninstitutional care (Provence and Lipton, 1962) is a positive outcome. In the latter case, the\nabsence of overt distress signals can be attributed to resignation in the face of repeatedly\nignored signaling behavior rather than emotional wellbeing. There is some indication that a\nsimilar mechanism could possibly also account for the relatively little crying in home-reared\ninfants with a history of maternal unresponsiveness as observed in some cases. In a study\nassessing infants' cortisol levels after the Strange Situation (SS) procedure, infants with\nattachment classifications associated with intense separation distress during the SS had\ncortisol values that were not significantly different from those of infants with attachment\nclassifications associated with little overt distress during the SS (Spangler and Grossmann,\n1993). Moreover, despite their low levels of behavioral distress during separation from their\nmothers, avoidantly attached infants in this sample showed significant heart rate increases\nduring the separation, indicating emotional arousal or activation. The level of overt\nbehavioral distress, in the absence of other relevant information, may therefore not be\nsufficient to make a reliable conclusion about the child's underlying emotional state.\nThis assumption is supported by data from research on the behavioral and hormonal\ncorrelates of mother\u00adinfant separation in squirrel monkeys (Levine, Wiener, and Coe, 1993).\nInfant vocalizations typically decreased with increasing duration of separation, which can be\ninterpreted as an adaptation to the ineffectiveness of the calling to reestablish contact with the\nmother. At the same time, however, cortisol levels kept increasing. Also, separated infant\nmonkeys vocalized more when auditory and olfactory communication with the mother was\npermitted during the separation, compared to complete isolation from the mother, thus again\nconfirming the assumed function of the distress vocalizations as a means of signaling to the\nNatural Parenting\nmother, as long as a rescue from the distressing situation is still perceived as potentially\npossible.\nSecond, it is worth noting that Grossmann et al. (1985) noticed in their home\nobservations of German mother\u00adinfant dyads that the mothers of the 10-month-old infants\ndealt in diverse ways with distress in their infants. Observed reactions ranged from picking\nup the child, offering a pacifier or toy, talking to the child, offering food, and changing the\ndiapers, to ignoring and even annoyed or angry responses. Similar observations were also\nmade by Bell and Ainsworth (1972). According to both studies these different behaviors were\nvariably effective in soothing the children, so that many mothers had to employ more than\none intervention to calm their child. Interestingly, a subgroup of mothers in Grossmann et\nal.'s study who never ignored their infant's crying during the observation period had to resort\nto significantly fewer attempts at calming their infant than the rest of the samplein other\nwords, they were more effective in calming their child. Also, their children cried significantly\nless frequently and for shorter periods of time. Thus, given these observations that mothers\ncan vary greatly in their ability to calm their distressed child, it may be too simplistic to\nassume that an infant's crying behavior could be exhaustively explained by promptness of\nmaternal response alone. Bearing in mind that maternal sensitivity is defined as\nencompassing both promptness and appropriateness of response (Ainsworth et al., 1974, p.\n127), it may be necessary to assess both aspects of maternal response for inferences about\ninfant crying behavior to be valid.\nIn Grossmann et al.'s (1985) sample, promptness and effectiveness of maternal\nresponse were closely linked, and associated with less crying in the infant. It could therefore\nbe presumed that only promptness and effectiveness of response in combination, that is,\nsensitive responsiveness, leads to relatively little crying, expanded modes of communication,\nand secure attachment. Apart from the body of research linking maternal sensitivity and\nsecure attachment, a Dutch intervention study that also included measures of infant crying\nprovides support for this assumption. In that study, mothers of irritable infants, preselected on\nlow social class where fairly high rates of maternal insensitivity are known to predominate\nat increasing maternal sensitive responsiveness to the child's signals (van den Boom, 1994).\nThe intervention proved effective in that mothers in the experimental group were indeed\nmore responsive than mothers in the nonintervention control group immediately after the\nintervention when the children were 9 months old. Moreover, relative to the control infants,\ninfants in the intervention group cried and fussed less and exhibited more positive social\nbehavior at 9 months, and further showed significantly more secure attachment at 12 months\nof age. If the above hypothesis is correct, the fact that most studies into this question have\nshown a link between prompt response to infant distress and reduced crying (with the\nappropriateness of the response often not being assessed) may, in effect, indicate that, in\nmany cases, prompt maternal response and an ability to quickly soothe the infant go hand in\nhand. The latter may be largely dependent on the mother's ability to choose an appropriate\nresponse, although infants who have been crying for relatively longer periods of time before\ntheir mother intervenes may naturally be more difficult to soothe than infants who have cried\nfor only little time. Findings where promptness of maternal response and infant cry behavior\nare not associated in the expected way, may consequently be indicative of samples where the\ntwo aspects of maternal sensitivity are not highly correlated. This explanation is likely to\napply to van IJzendoorn and Hubbard's (2000) sample, because they found mothers of\navoidant infants to show most prompt responses to their infants' distress, and mothers of\navoidantly attached infants have been described as insensitive, interfering and intrusive in\nNatural Parenting\nYet, some inconclusiveness still persists. Bell and Ainsworth (1972) reported that\nmaternal effectiveness in terminating her infant's crying was a less important determinant of\ncrying behavior than promptness of maternal response. However, Bell and Ainsworth\nexamined the association between effectiveness of response and frequency of crying clusters\n(series of distinct cries, separated by less than 2 min) rather than duration of crying (clusters),\nwhich is more likely to be affected by appropriateness of response. In any case, more\nresearch is certainly needed to clarify the relative contributions of promptness and\nappropriateness of maternal response to infant cry behavior.\nFinally, an interaction between infant temperament and caregiving style during the\nfirst months of life may make predictive patterns regarding infant cry behavior during early\nlife less likely, at least if infant temperament is not included in the equation. If degree of\nmaternal sensitive responsiveness is an important determining factor of infant cry behavior,\nand in common with maternal responsiveness, is a fairly stable maternal characteristic (Bell\nand Ainsworth, 1972; van IJzendoorn and Hubbard, 2000), then it may not be surprising to\nfind that individual differences in infant cry behavior also show moderate to high stability\nover the first year of life (Baildam et al., 1995; van IJzendoorn and Hubbard, 2000). The fact\nthat infant cry behavior appears somewhat less stable than maternal caregiving\ncharacteristics, and, according to Bell and Ainsworth (1972), is not related to maternal\nunresponsiveness during the first quarter and only stabilizes during the second half of the first\nyear of life, could consequently be attributed to an initial period of adaptation to the\ncaregiving environment. For instance, irritable infants cry comparatively much (Blum,\nTaubman, Tretina, and Heyward, 2002; van den Boom, 1991), but when raised by a sensitive\nmother show a decrease in crying over time (Belsky, Fish, and Isabella, 1991; van den Boom,\n1994), whereas infants with an easy temperament raised by insensitive mothers show a\nrelative increase in crying (Fish, Stifter, and Belsky, 1991), until after some months a balance\nbetween influences from temperament and caregiving interventions is likely to be achieved.\nIn general, insensitive mothering appears to be a greater causal factor of infant\nfussiness or irritability than vice versa (Bell and Ainsworth, 1972; Belsky et al., 1984;\nCrockenberg and Smith, 1982; van den Boom, 1994), although persistent crying in the infant\nhas been shown to make mothers more reluctant to promptly attend to their infants in the\nsecond half of the child's first year of life (Bell and Ainsworth, 1972). In combination with\nthe findings of many workers that unresponsiveness leads to higher levels of infant crying,\nthis suggests that a vicious circle can develop if high levels of crying persist beyond the first\nfew months (Bell and Ainsworth, 1972). Dyads most at risk for such a development would be\nirritable infants with insensitive mothers. In such cases, anything that might reduce infant\ndistress and increase maternal sensitivity may help to prevent the negative cycle from\ndeveloping.\nAll in all, the conclusion emerging from this discussion appears to be that sensitive\nmaternal responsiveness is as important in dealing with infant distress signals as it is in\nmother\u00adinfant interactions in general, forming a good starting point for a trusting relationship\nand supporting healthy emotional development in the child.\nThe role of physical proximity\nAs outlined by Bowlby (1982), the biological function of infants' attachment to their\ncaregivers is assumed to be the attainment or maintenance of physical proximity with their\nprimary care providers, which during the time when humans were evolving increased an\ninfant's chances of survival by offering protection from predators. Attachment behaviors such\nas crying, smiling, following, and clinging are therefore viewed as infants' innate equipment\ndesigned to maintain or reestablish closeness with their caregivers. These behaviors are\ncomplemented by parental behaviors with the same goal (e.g., calling, following, retrieval,\nNatural Parenting\nholding). Activation of proximity seeking in the child is most likely under conditions of stress\nor potential danger, such as hunger, fatigue, illness, pain, absence or impending departure of\nthe mother, maternal discouragement of proximity, or the presence of fear-provoking, natural\nclues to danger (see also Bowlby, 1973; e.g., loud noise, aloneness, darkness, anything\nstrange/unfamiliar). The attachment system is counterbalanced by an exploratory system, that\nis, an inborn curiosity concerning the outside world and a concomitant desire to examine\none's surroundings that provides the child with important learning experiences about his or\nher environment. Optimally, these systems are flexibly balanced, that is, the child is able to\nuse the mother as a secure base in his expanding explorations of the surrounding world (see\nmore potentially threatening a situation is, the greater is the child's need for direct contact\nwith the caregiver. Lack of confidence on the child's part in the caregiver's accessability and\nresponsiveness, based on a history of inconsistent caregiving, can also lead to a hightened\ndisplay of attachment behaviors, at the expense of exploratory behavior, wheras a history of\nconsistent caregiver availability engenders confidence in the accessability and responsiveness\nof the attachment figure whenever needed and thus encourages exploration (Bowlby, 1973,\n1982). Consequently, answering an infant's need for proximity and care in early life is\nviewed as decreasing a child's need for close proximity later on, wheras resisting a child's\ndependency needs is likely to have the opposite result. Empirical evidence overwhelmingly\nconfirms the central role of physical proximity between infant and caregiver in early infancy.\nContact comfort is universally perceived as reassuring by both human infants (e.g.,\nWolff, 1969) and infants of nonhuman primates (e.g., Harlow, 1958). This is also reflected in\nthe observation that the first instinctive reaction of a mother to her infant's distress is to\nembrace, rock or pat, and, often, to hum or talk soothingly to the infant (Dzik, 1979). All over\nthe world, mothers implicitly know that a combination of touch, movement, and speech calms\nan upset child. Newborns separated from their mothers, in particular, immediately stop crying\nupon reunion during the first hour after birth (Christensson, Cabrera, Christensson, Uvn\u00e4s-\nMoberg, and Winberg, 1995). In other studies the close presence of another person during the\nfirst few hours of life has also been associated with only minimal crying, whereas neonates\nwho are isolated from direct physical contact and cared for in a hospital nursery show\nconsiderably higher levels of distress (Lambesis, Vidyasagar, and Anderson, 1979; Malecki,\nBell and Ainsworth (1972), too, found that during the first three months of life the\ninfants in their longitudinal study had a tendency to cry more often when the mother was out\nof auditory, visual, and physical range. Throughout the whole first year of life, the most\neffective means of soothing the crying infants, and also the most frequently employed\nintervention by the mothers, was close physical contact. Exactly the same was also reported\nby Grossmann et al. (1985) for their Northern Germany sample of 10-month-old infants. Bell\nand Ainsworth further pointed out that very young infants usually required holding to be\nsoothed, whereas infants close to the age of one were more likely than earlier to be calmed by\nmaternal responses such as entering the room, or approaching or touching the child, that\nsimply decreased the distance between mother and infant but did not lead to close bodily\ncontact. Grossmann et al., on the other hand, mentioned that verbal empathy was ineffective\nas a soothing strategy with their 10-month-old subjects, unless combined with close physical\ncontact.\nIn a Canadian intervention study by Hunziker and Barr (1986), the amount of crying\nand fussing in infants during their second and third months of life was directly linked to the\namount of time the children spent in close contact with their caregivers. Children of parents\nwho had been instructed to carry their children for at least 3 hr a day in addition to routine\ncontact, and who on average carried their infants 4 hr 25 min per day, were found to cry and\nNatural Parenting\nfuss significantly less than infants in a control group experiencing an average of 2 hr 40 min\nof bodily contact, with the greatest observed reduction being 43% at the time of peak crying\n(i.e., 6 weeks of age). Another study with a very similar design, however, did not find any\nsignificant differences in the amount of daily fussing and crying between the carrying\nintervention and control group (St. James-Roberts, Hurry, Bowyer, and Barr, 1995).\nHowever, high attrition rates, especially in the control group, were a problem in this study.\nThree further studies also failed to replicate Hunziker and Barr's results, with one of them,\nhowever, investigating a clinical sample of infants presenting with crying problems (\"colic\")\n(Barr, McMullan, et al., 1991), and with the remaining two suffering from a number of\nshortcomings leading to uninterpretable findings (Elliott, Reilly, Drummond, and Letourneau,\n2002; Walker and Menahem, 1994). More specifically, neither of the two latter papers\nreported exact amounts of carrying in their experimental and control groups, thus failing to\nprovide evidence for significant group differences on this key variable. Elliott et al. further\nstated that 43% of the parents in the supplemental carrying group had carried their infants at\ntimes less than the recommended three extra hours. Walker and Menahem had instructed\nparticipants in the intervention group to carry their infants for at least 2 hr daily, which may\nnot have been considerably different from the carrying behavior of control group parents.\nWalker and Menahem's results were further contaminated by the presence of multiple\nconfounding variables.\nAnisfeld, Casper, Nozyce, and Cunningham (1990) investigated the effects of\nincreased physical contact, as achieved through the regular use of a soft infant carrier, on the\ninfant\u00admother relationship in a sample of Hispanic and Black mothers from a low-income\npopulation. They found that the experimental intervention significantly increased the\nmothers' responsiveness to their infants' vocalizations when the children were 3\u00bd months old\nand further promoted the establishment of secure attachment at 13 months. Maternal\nsensitivity at 3\u00bd months was also rated higher in the experimental group compared to a\ncontrol group, with the difference being marginally significant. The researchers hypothesized\nthat the extended physical closeness may have made it easier for the mothers to become\naware of their infants' needs and to consequently act on these perceptions. This proposition is\nin line with the recognition by Ainsworth et al. (1974) that a necessary precondition for\nsensitive responding is exposure to the child's signals in the first place. Other research has\nalso provided support for the link between maternal distance, insensitivity, and insecure\nFurthermore, a study evaluating the effects on the whole family system of 2 weeks of\ndaily skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care) between mothers and their premature infants,\nfound significant interactional benefits associated with the intervention when the infants were\n3 months old (corrected age), weeks after completion of the intervention (Feldman, Weller,\nSirota, and Eidelman, 2003). More specifically, both the mothers, the actual providers of\nkangaroo care, and the fathers showed greater sensitivity, less intrusiveness, and higher levels\nof dyadic reciprocity in interactions with their infants compared to a control group that had\nreceived conventional care in the neonatal nursery. At the same time, infants in the\nexperimental group showed less negative emotionality during interactions with their parents,\nand the parent\u00adinfant triads were judged to display higher cohesiveness. In the intervention\ngroup, both parents also provided their infants with more affectionate touch than control\nparents. The apparent spill-over effect of positive interactional patterns from the mother\u00ad\ninfant dyad extending to the whole family is in line with assumptions from family systems\ntheory, where changes in part of the system always impact the larger system. Follow-ups at 6\nmonths and 2 years indicated continued higher levels of maternal sensitivity in the kangaroo\nNatural Parenting\nNatural parenting, sensitive parenting, and mother\u00adinfant attachment\nAs a final step in the examination of issues related to mother\u00adinfant interaction and\nattachment, we will now consider how natural parenting practices relate to the discussed\nfindings. Sensitivity to the child's emotional and physical needs is a core principle of natural\nparenting, and crying in the infant is always interpreted as a clear sign of distress that needs\nto be taken seriously and responded to. This parental attitude coupled with the high levels of\nphysical contact characteristic of these mother\u00adinfant dyads usually ensures prompt maternal\nresponse to infant distress. Extensive exposure to cues from the child further facilitates\ninterpreting these cues, so that mothers with this parenting strategy can be assumed to react\nappropriately as well as promptly to signals from their infants. In this context, maternal\nresponsiveness can be presumed to extend to precry signals and nondistress signals as well,\nthus leading to more refined and richer modes of communication between mother and infant.\nThe fulfilment of the infant's innate need for close physical proximity to the caregiver should\nalso eliminate at least one source of distress in the infant. Consequently, the frequency of\ncrying episodes would be expected to be relatively low and the duration of individual crying\nepisodes fairly short in infants raised according to natural parenting principles. Yet, as infants\nhave been shown to cry not only as a means to request some action from the caregiver but\nalso to protest against certain caregiving behaviors (e.g., wiping the nose) or prohibitions\n(e.g., removal of a forbidden object) (Chen, X., and Gustafson, 2004), a certain amount of\ncrying should still be expected even in infants who have their basic needs continuously\nfulfilled.\nParental responsiveness to infant distress in the context of natural parenting practices\nmay, however, differ from the kind of responsiveness observed in a conventional Western\nchildrearing context and discussed in studies on Western samples. Direct extrapolations from\nthese studies to natural parenting environments should thus be considered with caution. The\nextended physical contact between caregiver and infant in the former case permits prompter\ncaregiver responses than is possible under the circumstances prevalent in most Western\nfamilies. Responsiveness to precry signals is also more easily accomplished under conditions\nof close proximity. This reality is also reflected in the following statement by Ainsworth and\nBell (1977, p. 1214): \"Under conditions of infant care in our society it is not feasible for a\nmother to be so constantly close to her baby that she can consistently avert cries by\nresponding to signals that she has learned to interpret as precursors to crying.\"\nAn investigation by Barr, Konner, Bakeman, and Adamson (1991), conducted among\nthe !Kung San hunter-gatherers in North-Western Botswana, offers some insight into the\ncrying patterns of infants raised in a natural parenting context. !Kung San infants are in\nvirtually continuous physical contact with their caregivers and are very frequently fed, and\ncaregivers respond immediately to infant signals (with under-3-month-olds, 92% of the\ninfants' cry/fret signals are responded to within 15 s; the corresponding rate during the\nsecond year of life is 82%; Barr, Bakeman, Konner, and Adamson, 1987). For comparison,\nWestern mothers have been reported to deliberately ignore on average 26\u00ad47% of their\ninfants' distress signals (Bell and Ainsworth, 1972; Grossmann et al., 1985; van IJzendoorn\nand Hubbard, 2000). However, individual variability in responsiveness was high in the\nWestern samples. Whereas the overall frequency of combined crying and fretting events in\nthe !Kung San sample appeared to be similar to that observed in samples of Western infants,\nit is noteworthy that more than 60% of the infants' distress signals lasted 5 s or less, and only\n5\u00ad10% lasted more than 30 s during the first two years of life (Barr, Konner, et al., 1991).\nMoreover, crying represented only about 5% of total cry/fret duration throughout the first\nyear of life. Overall duration of crying and fretting was only about half of that of Dutch\ninfants. A comparison of two neighboring, but culturally distinct Central African peoples\nwith different styles of infant care yielded similar results (Hewlett, Lamb, Shannon,\nNatural Parenting\nLeyendecker, and Sch\u00f6lmerich, 1998). The foraging Aka closely resemble the !Kung San in\ntheir caregiving practices, whereas the Ngandu farmers provide their infants with only about\nhalf as much physical contact, feed them less frequently than the Aka, and are also more\ninclined to let their infants fuss or cry. In line with Barr, Konner, et al.'s (1991) findings, Aka\ninfants were found to fuss or cry less than half as much as Ngandu infants at the ages of 3\u00ad4\nmonths and 9\u00ad10 months. Observations conducted among the Zinacanteco Indians of\nSouthern Mexico draw a very similar picture (Brazelton, Robey, and Collier, 1969). All in\nall, intense and prolonged infant crying is a rare event in societies that follow natural\ncaregiving practices.\nIt should be emphasized that infant care practices in these cultures are characterized\nnot only by prompt reaction to infant distress and close physical proximity, but also by\nconsiderably more frequent feedings than what is typically observed in industrialized\nsocieties. As shortly spaced feedings are a biological need of the human infant, this feature\nmay further increase the level of appropriateness of caregiver response to infant signals in\nthis caregiving context compared to a conventional Western childrearing environment, and\nmay thus also influence crying behavior. Indeed, in a U.S. study specifically investigating the\nrelative contribution of these two variables on infant expressions of distress, both promptness\nof maternal response and feeding frequency emerged as important determinants of fussing\nand crying behavior in infants, at least at an early age (Barr and Elias, 1988). More\nspecifically, Barr and Elias found that 2-month-old infants with a promptly responding\nmother, coupled with short interfeeding intervals, cried and fretted less often when compared\nto infants whose mothers only fed them at short intervals or only responded quickly, and\nparticularly when compared to children whose mothers did neither. At 4 months, however,\nsignificant relationships between the variables were no longer evident.\nAlthough natural parenting practices in a Western context may predominantly appeal\nto parents who would parent sensitively in any case, Anisfeld et al.'s (1990) study\ndemonstrated that a simple intervention increasing the amount of physical contact between\nmother and infant can significantly improve the quality of the mother\u00adchild relationship, as\nreflected in more secure attachment in the infant. A study conducted among the Dogon of\nMali, West Africa, provides rare data on attachment security of infants raised according to\nnatural parenting principles (True, Pisani, and Oumar, 2001). As constant physical proximity\nbetween caregiver and infant, immediate response to infant distress, and frequent\nbreastfeeding on demand are the norm in the Dogon culture, the studied sample is free from a\npossible bias towards a specific maternal personality type that feels particularly drawn to a\nnatural approach to parenting, as could be the case in a Western sample. Despite the fact that\na significant portion of the infants in the sample had their grandmother as the primary\ncaregiver during the day, mothers still remained closely involved with their infants in these\ncases through frequent breastfeedings and cosleeping during the night. Hence, attachment\nclassifications were also found to be uninfluenced by type of primary caregiver.\nUsing the Ainsworthian three-category classification system, 87% of the Dogon\ninfants were classified as secure, none as avoidant, and 13% as resistant at the age of 1 year\n(True et al., 2001). This distribution differed significantly from that of an aggregated sample\nof 1990 children from 8 countries, mainly the U.S. and Western Europe, representing 32\ndifferent studies, where 65% of the children were securely attached, 21% avoidant, and 14%\nresistant (van IJzendoorn and Kroonenberg, 1988). Compared to the predominantly Western\nsample, Dogon infants were significantly more often securely attached and also showed\nsignificant differences regarding the prevalence of avoidant attachment. When the results\nwere examined using the more recent four-category system, Dogon infants were classified as\nfollows: 67% secure, 0% avoidant, 8% resistant, and 25% disorganized. Compared to four\nNorth American samples comprising a total of 306 children, where 55% of the children had\nNatural Parenting\nreceived a secure attachment classification, 23% an avoidant, 8% a resistant, and 15% a\ndisorganized classification (van IJzendoorn, Goldberg, Kroonenberg, and Frenkel, 1992), the\nonly statistically significant difference between these two distributions was the total absence\nof avoidant attachment among the Dogon infants. This particular feature was explained by the\nauthors in terms of the incompatibility of Dogon caregiving practices with conditions\ntypically associated with avoidant attachment in Western samples, that is, maternal rejection\nof attachment bids, intrusion, and lack of physical contact and tender holding. The authors\nfurther point out that the distribution of attachment classifications among the Dogon is also\nremarkable given their high infant mortality (25\u00ad45% of infants have been reported to die\nbefore the age of 5), as a connection between unresolved loss in the mother and disorganized\nattachment in the child has been reported given certain conditions (e.g., Hughes, Turton,\nMcGauley, and Fonagy, 2006; Schuengel, Bakermans-Kranenburg, and van IJzendoorn,\n1999). Yet, the proportion of disorganized infants in the Dogon sample was not significantly\ndifferent from the rate in the aggregated Western sample. Dogon maternal sensitivity as\nassessed with Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scale was found to be modestly correlated\nwith infant security ratings, with the correlation approaching statistical significance.\nTwo other studies conducted in cultures where responsive, close contact parenting is\ncommon practice draw a similar picture. One study examined a Black South African sample\nliving in extreme poverty (Tomlinson, Cooper, and Murray, 2005) and found the following\ndistribution of attachment classifications: 62% secure, 4% avoidant, 8% resistant, and 26%\ndisorganized (three-way classification: 72% secure, 17% avoidant, and 11% resistant). The\nother study investigated Indonesian mother\u00adchild dyads of low and lower-middle\nsocioeconomic status (Zevalkink, Riksen-Walraven, and Van Lieshout, 1999) that displayed\nthe following distribution: 52% secure, 7% avoidant, 20% resistant, 20% disorganized, and\n2% other (three-way classification: 59% secure, 7% avoidant, and 34% resistant). Compared\nto the aggregated global distributions, the Indonesian dyads demonstrated lower levels of\navoidant and higher levels of resistant attachment. In both samples, attachment security was\nsignificantly associated with either maternal sensitivity or high quality of maternal support.\nOn the whole, the two samples demonstrated similar rates of attachment security as those\nfound in Western samples, and lower rates of avoidant attachment. In the Indonesian case, a\nrelatively higher rate of resistant attachment was observed. The high levels of secure\nattachment are noteworthy, as both investigated groups were exposed to economic and social\nstress, the South African sample probably more so than the Indonesian sample. Both groups\nof investigators argued that such life stresses may negatively impact the quality of parenting.\nIn the South African community living in pervasive socioeconomic adversity, for instance,\nlevels of family violence and abuse were likely to be high, 35% of the mothers had been\ndiagnosed with postpartum depression, and HIV/AIDS was a common source of concern. For\ncomparison, aggregated data from samples characterized by maltreated mothers (9.1%\nsecure, 20.6% avoidant, 17.4% resistant, 20.9% disorganized) show significantly lower levels\nof attachment security in such circumstances (van IJzendoorn et al., 1999).\nThe limited data available to date thus suggests that naturally parented infants show a\ntrend towards greater attachment security, and specifically an absence of avoidant\nattachment, relative to infants parented in the prevalent Western way. However, data on\nWestern samples of naturally parented infants is not yet available, and will need to be\ncollected before conclusive inferences can be made. Yet, if anything, rates of secure\nattachment in Western samples of naturally parented infants could be expected to be higher\nrather than lower than those in nonindustrialized societies, because factors such as high infant\nmortality or general hardship may bias the results in developing countries towards lower rates\nof secure attachment than what would be observed in the absence of these factors. Also,\nNatural Parenting\ndifferences in the early social experiences of infants with different backgrounds (i.e.,\ndifferences in infant care practices) may significantly affect how infants experience the\nStrange Situation procedure, so that the resulting classifications may reveal as much about the\ninfants' familiarity with situations similar to the test situation as it reveals about the quality of\nthe dyads' relationships (LeVine and Miller, 1990). This equally applies to comparisons\nbetween cultures as to comparisons between different subgroups within the same culture,\nsuch as naturally parented and conventionally raised infants. Consequently, infants not used\nto playing in unfamiliar places outside the home, and unfamiliar with physical separation\nfrom the mother, meeting strangers, and being left alone by the mother, could be wrongly\nclassified as insecurely attached when in fact they are merely reacting to an entirely novel,\npossibly great anxiety inducing situation (LeVine and Miller, 1990). Therefore, although\nassessments of the attachment security of naturally parented infants in the West would be\nimportant to conduct, there is justified doubt as to how valid a measure the Strange Situation\nis for this purpose. Additionally, results could possibly be confounded by maternal\npersonality in the sense that women with certain characteristics (e.g., maternal sensitivity)\nmay be more likely to choose natural parenting than others.\nDependenceIndependence\nCritics of natural parenting are frequently concerned that a mother's continuous\ninvolvement with her infant will cause the child to become overly dependent on her, and thus\nprevent the child from growing into an independent human being. Apart from the fact that\nearly independence in a child as a developmental goal is mainly a feature of Western\nindustrialized societies and is by no means shared by all cultures (Keller, H., 2003), there are\nclear indications that quite the opposite is true. The earlier discussion on the role of physical\nproximity in early life and on the link between sensitive caregiving, attachment security, and\nexploratory behavior has already introduced the issue.\nMore specifically, Ainsworth and colleagues (Ainsworth, Bell, and Stayton, 1972,\n1974; Stayton and Ainsworth, 1973) made a number of detailed observations relevant to this\ntopic in their comprehensive longitudinal study of mother\u00adinfant dyads covering the infants'\nfirst year of life. For instance, they reported that mothers who had given their infants\nrelatively much affectionate, tender, and unhurried bodily contact during their early months,\nhad infants who towards the end of the first year of life enjoyed affectional interaction during\nphysical closeness with their mothers, but at the same time also were happy to be put down\nagain, whereupon they would turn cheerfully to exploratory behavior and play activities,\ndemanding relatively little contact under normal circumstances. In contrast, infants who had\nexperienced only relatively brief episodes of holding, particularly if the contact was abrupt\nand inadequate, tended to protest against being put down and did not readily turn to\nindependent play. They also showed great ambivalence about physical contact, sometimes\nseeking it, but not really enjoying it when getting it. Moreover, during the second half of the\nfirst year of life, infants with sensitively responsive mothers did not necessarily protest\nagainst brief absences of their mothers in a familiar home environment, such as when she left\nthe room for a moment. It was more likely that the infants followed her rather than that they\ncried. These infants' behavior seemed to imply that they were confident that their mother\nwould be available to them should they need her, and that she would be back soon in any\ncase. Again, it was those infants who had experienced comparatively insensitive mothering\nwho were more upset by everyday separations from their mothers. They were unwilling to let\ntheir mothers out of sight and were more often distressed by their departures. This behavior\nwas described as a logical consequence of living with an inconsistently and unpredictably\nbehaving attachment figure whom the child had not learned to trust, resulting in constant\nNatural Parenting\nmonitoring of the mother's movements by the child and an immediate distress reaction\nwhenever the mother moved out of sight.\nOther research has also shown a clear link between insecure attachment in infancy\nand overly dependent behavior in preschool (Sroufe, Fox, and Pancake, 1983) and at age ten\n(Urban, Carlson, Egeland, and Sroufe, 1991). Moreover, routinely sharing the parents' bed in\ninfancy has been associated with greater self-reliance and social independence at preschool\nage than a history of solitary sleeping (Keller, M. A., and Goldberg, 2004).\nComparisons between different cultures provide similar evidence. One study on\ntoddlers, for example, found that Malaysian infants easily separated from their mothers at an\nearlier age than children in a U.S. sample (at the median age of 21 months vs. 36 months)\n(Chen, S. T., 1989). Malaysian infants are known to be carried a lot during their waking\nhours, and usually live in an extended family setting, while North-American infants spend\nsignificantly more time on their own. Furthermore, an examination of contemporary hunter-\ngatherer societies, whose approach to infant care is typically characterized by extensive and\naffectionate maternal involvement and a lot of physical contact, generally revealed early and\ngradually increasing autonomy and independence in the children, who by the age of 2\u00ad4\nyears spent more than 50% of the day in the company of their peers, away from their mothers\n(Lozoff and Brittenham, 1979). Konner (1976), who compared the behavior of English\nchildren aged 2\u00ad5 years to that of !Kung San hunter-gatherer children of the same age, also\nreported greater independence in the !Kung children. Reynolds' (1997) observations of\nchildren in different indigenous cultures for which close and extended maternal-infant contact\nis typical, are along the same lines.\nIn sum, the presented findings provide support for the assertion that a caring and\naffectionate approach to infant care that is sensitive to the child's needs and provides physical\ncloseness is more likely to produce secure and ultimately independent children, than a\nparenting style that overemphasizes independence by limiting physical closeness, at an age\nwhen dependency needs are most natural and in fact a sign of healthy psychological\ndevelopment.\nBrain DevelopmentPhysiology Meets Psychology\nHuman infants are born with a brain about 25% of its final adult size. By the first\nbirthday the infant's brain has more than doubled in weight, and when the child turns three,\nhas reached about 80% of its final weight (Caviness, Kennedy, Bates, and Makris, 1996).\nGrowth continues until the middle of the second decade of life when full adult brain size is\nfinally achieved. The fast rate of brain growth observed during the first year of life is thus\nunique to early development and will not be reached again during any later stage.\nWhile the neurological development of the brain follows a genetically\npreprogrammed path that provides a crude framework for the process, it is at the same time\nalso heavily influenced by experience (Anderson, V., Northam, Hendy, and Wrennall, 2001;\nPerry, 2002; Siegel, 1999). The number of neurons present at birth decreases somewhat\nduring the months following birth, but it is mainly the structure and the activity of the\ndeveloping brain that undergo profound transformations. Connectivity within the brain\nincreases considerably during the first six months through augmented dendritic branching;\nnew synaptic connections are generated, first unspecified in nature and greater in number\nthan ultimately needed, then reducing to those utilized within the system in a process of\nelimination of redundant synapses which commences after the age of one. Myelination of\naxons, which peaks during the first eight months of life and continues well into early\nadulthood, finally substantially increases nerve conduction velocity. Experience enters the\nequation by stimulating different pathways in the brain, reinforcing existing connections by\nNatural Parenting\nrepeated activation, as well as creating new ones, while unused circuits die away. Toxic\nconditions, such as those resulting from chronic stress, can also lead to the regression of\nsynaptic contacts and neuronal cell death. Most importantly, by changing the very structure\nand the patterns of activity within the brain, experiences in early life also influence how\nsubsequent information will be processed, thus affecting future functioning. Even though this\nshaping process continues throughout life, its effects are particularly critical during these\nearly stages of development when the foundations for the brain's basic structure are laid.\nFor infants, their relationships with their main caregivers constitute the primary\nenvironment for their early development. In recent years, interdisciplinary approaches\ncombining findings in neuroscience, biochemistry, developmental psychology, particularly\nattachment research, mental health, and related fields have provided increasing evidence for\nthe crucial role of these early interactions in affecting early brain growth and subsequent\nSiegel, 1999). These approaches bring together a vast amount of research ranging from\ninvestigations at a microscopic physiological level to the analysis of emotions and overt\nbehavior, including animal research and findings from clinical as well as normal populations.\nMany hypotheses generated from animal models are now increasingly confirmed in human\nresearch. Within this complex framework, affectionate and responsive caregiving during\ninfancy is clearly emerging as an important prerequisite for healthy brain development and\nlater emotional wellbeing.\nMost obvious examples of the link between adverse early social experiences and\nresulting deficits in brain and overall functioning can be found in clinical samples. For\ninstance, former Romanian orphans, who had experienced severe early social deprivation,\nstill showed long-term deficits in their cognitive and behavioral functioning after being\nadopted into U.S. families, with concomitant dysfunction in a group of limbic brain areas\ntypically activated by stress and known to be damaged by prolonged stress (Chugani et al.,\n2001). In an Australian sample of extremely low birth weight infants, a history of childhood\nneglect was further associated with a smaller head circumference at ages 2 and 4, and with\nincreasingly delayed cognitive development over the first four years of life compared to\nchildren who had not experienced neglect (Strathearn, Gray, O'Callaghan, and Wood, 2001).\nAnother U.S. study on children and adolescents with past experience of maltreatment, and\ncontinued posttraumatic stress disorder, also found significantly decreased cerebral and\nintracranial brain volumes in the maltreated subjects when compared to matched controls (De\nBellis et al., 1999). In addition, intracranial brain volume correlated positively with child's\nage at the time of abuse onset, and negatively with duration of abuse.\nMilder forms of relational deficits in parenting have also been shown to produce\ndistinct findings. In a study conducted by Dawson, Frey, Panagiotides, et al. (1999) in the\nU.S., 13- to 15-month-old infants of depressed mothers, when compared to infants of\nnondepressed mothers, showed a persistent atypical pattern of lowered activity in the left\nfrontal brain area relative to the right frontal region. In typically developing children,\nincreased left versus right frontal activity is usually observed. The abnormal condition also\npersisted during positive interactions with a nondepressed adult. The left frontal area is\nassumed to mediate positive affective expression and social approach behaviors. On a\nbehavioral level, these children touched their mothers less than their age-matched controls,\ndisplayed less affection towards her, and with increasing duration of maternal depression\nwere also more likely to behave in a hostile and aggressive manner (Dawson, Frey, Self, et\nal., 1999). A long-term prospective investigation into the activity of the hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) system involved in the stress response, further demonstrated that\nexperiencing maternal stress, and particularly maternal depression, in infancy appears to\nincrease the vulnerability of the child's HPA system to future stressors, resulting in elevated\nNatural Parenting\ncortisol levels at the age of 4\u00bd when exposed to concurrent maternal stress (Essex, Klein,\nCho, and Kalin, 2002). Exposure to only high levels of early or concurrent stress, on the other\nhand, did not result in elevated cortisol levels at the age of 4\u00bd years. High cortisol levels at\npreschool-age were also predictive of dysregulated behavior more than two years later.\nMore research is still needed into the effects of subtle differences in caregiving\nbehaviors within the normally accepted range of parenting practices to determine whether\nvariations in these practices differentially affect neural development. A close examination of\nthe developing stress response system is likely to yield particularly valuable information for\nthis branch of inquiry. A review of research on neuroendocrine stress reactions in early life\nby Gunnar (1998), for instance, outlines how secure, sensitive, and responsive caregiving\nseems to play an important role in blocking, or at least buffering, increases in cortisol activity\nfor infants and young children in potentially stressful situations, thus preventing possible\nadverse consequences of elevated cortisol levels on the developing brain (see also Gunnar\nand Donzella, 2002). Moreover, temperamentally vulnerable infants appear to show\nespecially high cortisol reactivity to nonoptimal care, thus benefiting the most from this\nprotective effect of warm and sensitive caregiving. Interestingly, rat pups that as part of\nnaturally occurring variations in maternal care are licked and groomed relatively more by\ntheir mothers, have been found to show significantly reduced neuroendocrine reactivity to\nstress as adults, relative to control pups that are licked and groomed less (Liu et al., 1997).\nThere is also evidence that the cortisol stress response stabilizes around the age of six\nmonths, after which individual differences appear to remain fairly constant (Lewis and\nRamsay, 1995). Future research in this field combined with an increasing synthesis of already\nexisting information from the different research traditions involved will hopefully help to\nclarify the kinds of experiences in early infancy that are likely to produce below-optimal\noutcomes in later life and identify children at greatest risk for negative outcomes.\nPrevalence of Natural Parenting\nThis section concludes the overview of supportive evidence for the benefits of natural\nparenting by presenting numbers on the actual prevalence of the recommended practices from\na historical and cross-cultural perspective. The reader should be aware that while many of the\nvaried cultural practices that will be reported were true at the time when the observations\nwere recorded, they may no longer be an accurate reflection of current practices. Yet, from an\nevolutionary perspective, even a hundred years represent only a blink of an eye, and the\nincreasing contamination of many indigenous cultures with Western practices during the past\nfew decades cannot mask the fact that at least until very recently, if not up till the present,\nnatural parenting practices have been prevalent worldwide.\nIt is generally assumed that infant care during most of human history followed the\nprinciples of an approach based on constant contact and continuous care, which was most\nadaptive in the context of hunting and gathering, the mode of subsistence that prevailed\nthe few remaining contemporary hunter-gatherer societies in the tropics provides details of\nthe used approach. All of the 10 tropical foraging groups examined by Lozoff and Brittenham\n(1979) carried or held their infants more than 50% of the day before the onset of crawling,\nand mother and child slept in the same bed or room in all cases. The mother was the principal\ncaregiver, and weaning did usually not take place before the child's second birthday or well\nafter (true for 86% of the societies). Furthermore, immediate response to infant crying was\nthe rule, and care was generally affectionate. Similar infant-care patterns were also found\namong the 176 other nonindustrial societies reviewed by Lozoff and Brittenham (1979).\nNatural Parenting\nThese were not hunter-gatherer societies, as they engaged in subsistence activities such as\nagriculture, fishing, or herding, which are more recent developments, having been used\nduring less than 1% of our species' history. Cosleeping of mother and child in the same bed\nor room, extended nursing, and highly responsive care were also typical in the majority of\nthese cultures. However, what distinguished this subsample from the nomadic hunter-\ngatherers is that only 56% of them (vs. 100% of the hunter-gatherers) provided their children\nwith close physical contact for more than half of the time during early infancy.\nIn modern-day industrialized countries these practices have been mostly abandoned or\nat least greatly attenuated. They have been replaced by a more detached approach to infant\ncare, characterized by less maternal involvement and an apparent concern about issues such\nas overindulging and spoiling the infant or encouraging too great a dependence of the child\non the caregiver. While child-rearing practices during most of preindustrial European history\nwere still much in accordance with natural parenting principles, societal changes in attitude\nthat began in the 18th century and were accelerated by the industrial revolution led to a\nprofound transformation in parenting attitudes by the early 20th century (review presented in\nThevenin, 1987, pp. 51\u00ad63). The intimate connection between the lives of extended family\nmembers sharing small living quarters, which was characteristic during earlier times, had\nbecome more and more replaced by the nuclear family, and early independence of children\nhad become an increasingly important concept in all aspects of child-rearing. Also, the\nemergence of parenting educators prescribing the \"do's and don'ts\" of infant care, as well as\nadvances in science and medicine, had made infant care a strongly regulated discipline and\ngiven it a distinctly sterile touch. Mothers were advised to refrain from picking up their\ncrying child unless there was a \"good reason\", and excessive displays of physical affection\nwere strongly disapproved. Further aspects of this mindset were the increased popularity of\nbottle-feeding and the medicalized treatment of childbirth. Separate sleeping arrangements\nhad already been recommended since the 1700s and the invention of the modern baby\ncarriage, suitable for outdoor use, in the early 19th century in England (Fontanel and\nThe past few decades, however, have seen a return to more natural values in parenting\nas well as a change towards a more child-led form of care at all levels of Western society\n(Thevenin, 1987, pp. 61\u00ad63). This has also been reflected in an increasing number of parents\nadopting natural parenting as their parenting style of choice. Commercially manufactured\ncarrying devices have become widely available (already noted in 1975 by Jelliffe), and an\ninternational network of associations and support groups for like-minded parents has formed.\nPopular literature and publications on natural parenting are available for actively interested\nparents, and professional circles have also started reevaluating their standpoints. Yet, this\nalternative parenting movement is still fairly small in scale, and the exact number of Western\nparents practicing natural parenting is unknown.\nIn order to gain a more detailed picture of the past as well as current worldwide\ndistribution of natural parenting practices, the prevalence of each of the central elements of\nnatural parenting will now be examined across different populations.\nInfant Carrying\nGreat variations in the extent of close physical contact between caregiver and child\nduring early infancy exist between cultures, with differences in lifestyle, modes of\nsubsistence, economic conditions, and climatic factors playing a central role in determining\nhow and where an infant typically spends the day. While all hunter-gatherer societies, and\nover half of the other nonindustrial societies that were inspected by Lozoff and Brittenham\n(1979), carried or held their offspring for more than 50% of the day during early infancy,\nNatural Parenting\nphysical contact rates close to these numbers are still rare in industrialized nations. Japan is\none exception, where physical closeness traditionally has played an important role in infant\ncare (Latz, Wolf, and Lozoff, 1999; Miyake, Chen, and Campos, 1985; Rothbaum, Pott,\nMore typical of industrialized countries, infants in a Canadian sample were found to\nbe carried by their caregivers for about 2 hr 40 min daily between the age of 3 weeks and 3\nmonths (Hunziker and Barr, 1986). Two British studies collected data on the typical daily\nexperiences of infants and also provide some insight into the extent of physical contact in\nearly infancy in the industrialized West. Baildam et al. (2000), for instance, reported that the\nmothers in their sample spent on average 61 min per 24 hr holding their sleeping or crying\ninfant of 6 weeks' age, with the figure decreasing to 17 min when the child turned one.\nHowever, considerable bodily contact also occurs during feedings, at least during early life,\nan activity that was included as part of the category of physical care, which also comprised\nactivities such as bathing and changing. Mothers of 6-week-old infants spent a mean time of\n3 hr 27 min on their infants' physical care, while mothers of 1-year-olds did so for only 2 hr\n23 min daily. Two other categories that were assessed were play and interaction, distinct from\nany elements included in the two previously mentioned classes, on the one hand, and outings,\non the other hand, both of which may or may not have included some physical contact.\nMother and child spent approximately one hour daily in either activity throughout the child's\nfirst year of life. The same four activities involving fathers and other, non-parental, caregivers\nwere also assessed, but comprised only a small part of the children's daily experiences.\nVariability of daily durations of the different activities at selected points during the child's\nfirst year of life between individual families was high. St. James-Roberts et al. (1995)\nassessed similar measures in their control group when the infants were 2 and 6 weeks old.\nMean daily amounts of bodily contact between parents and infant appear to be higher in this\nstudy than in the two others. At the age of 2 weeks, infants were held or carried on average\nfor 1 hr 57 min daily, and an additional 4 hr 12 min were spent feeding. At 6 weeks, daily\nduration of holding and carrying amounted to 2 hr 11 min, and that of feeding to 3 hr 38 min.\nThe two other classes of typical interactions that were assessed included social stimulation\n(playing and talking) and basic care (bathing, dressing, changing). For infants raised in the\nUnited States, Ainsworth et al. (1972) reported close bodily contact for approximately 35%\nof the infants' waking time during the first quarter of their first year of life, decreasing to less\nthan 10% in the fourth quarter.\nClimatic influences\nTo investigate the relationship between customary methods of infant care and features\nof the natural environment across the globe, J. W. M. Whiting (1981) examined a cross-\ncultural sample of 250 societies, including the sample on which Lozoff and Brittenham\n(1979) had based their inferences. All data had been compiled before 1960 and covered all\nmajor ethnographic regions of the world. J. W. M. Whiting's analysis yielded a clear\nrelationship between climatic region and type of infant carrying device used, which is a good\nindex of the degree of physical closeness experienced by the child. He concluded that infants\nin cold climates tended to be transported in a cradle or cradleboard, which was also generally\nused as a sleeping place at night and as a resting device during the day. Use of heavy clothing\nfor the infant, or swaddling, was common in these cultures. Close physical contact between\npreambulatory infants and their caregivers was infrequent and notably less extensive than\namong people living in warm climates, defined as regions with mean winter temperatures\nInfants in warm climates were typically carried in a shawl or sling on their caregiver's\nbody for most of the day, wearing little or no clothing. Close body contact was frequently\nNatural Parenting\nmaintained during naps and most often continued throughout the night when child and\nmother slept next to each other in the same bed. Carrying devices were not necessarily used\nin all instances, and at times the caregiver's arms were likely the only support when holding\nthe child. Some societies used no carrying aids at all, and typically fell somewhere between\ncradle and sling cultures in terms of total contact time between caregiver and infant.\nA few exceptions to this general pattern exist, the Eskimo and other native tribal\ngroups of Northern America and Siberia being one (see also Reynolds, 1997). Despite their\nharsh living conditions Eskimos do not use transportable cradles or cradleboards when\ntraveling with their infants. Instead young Inuit children are carried on their mothers' backs,\ninside a parka that is belted at waist-level, thus supporting the child under the buttocks and\npreventing slippage from the protective pouch formed by the mother's garment. However, the\npractice of swaddling and the use of shawls to carry infants, especially in summer or indoors,\nhave also been observed among some Eskimo tribes (Honigmann and Honigmann, 1953).\nThe traditional Greek method of combining heavy swaddling with the use of a sling was\nanother observed variation (Mead, 1953, pp. 97\u00ad98). Some use of slings has also been\nreported for the medieval Western civilization, however, mainly for transportation rather than\nas a means of keeping the child close to the caregiver for extended periods of time (Fontanel\nCultures where extensive physical contact occurs between infants and caregivers and\nfor which exact measures are available, typically show mean body contact rates ranging\nbetween 70% and 95% of the time for young infants. The hunting and gathering !Kung San\nof the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, for example, hold or carry their infants about 80\u00ad90% of\nthe time during the first few months of life (Konner, 1976). The Central African Aka, also a\nforaging people, hold their infants about 96% of the time at the age of 3\u00ad4 months, and 87%\nof the time at 9\u00ad10 months (Hewlett et al., 1998). Like the !Kung, Aka carry their infants on\ntheir hips, using slings. When sitting, they place their infants between their legs or on their\nlaps. Data on Kenyan Gusii infants, collected in the mid-1970s, shows close physical contact\nrates of about 80% of daytime for the first 6 months of life, that is, all the time the infants are\nawake (LeVine et al., 1996, p. 160). For the Kipsigis, an African society where infants are\ncarried in shawls on the caregivers' backs, the corresponding figure is 70% for infants under\nthe age of 1 year (Super, C., unpublished fieldnotes, n. d., as cited in Whiting, J. W. M.,\n1981). Furthermore, in only 4% of the cases were these same infants ever found out of the\nreach of their caregiver (beyond 1 m). Similar results were reported for the East African\nKikuyu, whose under-1-year-olds experience close bodily contact with their mother or\nanother caregiver 68% of the observed time (Leiderman and Leiderman, 1973, as cited in\nWhiting, J. W. M., 1981). At the other end of the continuum are findings for cultures\ncharacterized by the widespread use of cradles. A review of relevant ethnographic data on\nEurasian cradle cultures, where available, led J. W. M. Whiting (1981) to conclude that\ninfants in all examined societies spent less than half the time in bodily contact with their\nmother or other caregiver.\nSpecifics of infant carrying: Who, how, and with what?\nWhile infant carrying is a widespread practice among many cultures of the world, the\nspecifics of how and by whom the infant is carried may vary considerably from one region to\nanother. The mother, being the main caregiver in most cases, frequently has the main\nresponsibility for carrying the child. However, other people such as other members of the\nfamily may share this task with her to varying degrees. Rather than attempting an exhaustive\noverview of worldwide practices, just a few illustrative examples will be mentioned here.\nFor the African continent, J. W. M. Whiting (1981) reported that, while it is usually\nthe mother's task, an older sister may also sometimes carry her younger sibling. The\nNatural Parenting\nseminomadic Ef\u00e9 pygmies of the Ituri Forest of Za\u00efre, in contrast, present a very different\npicture (Tronick et al., 1985). In their society multiple caretaking is the rule, and women of\nthe same band frequently hold, carry, and comfort each other's children, even when the\ninfant's own mother is present. This exchange of caretaking responsibilities also extends to\ntasks such as breastfeeding other women's children. More intense involvement of siblings\nwas reported by Firth in a description of the Tikopia of the Solomon Islands in 1936 (p. 141),\nwhere girls and boys as young as four years old carrying their younger brothers and sisters on\ntheir backs was said to be a common sight in the villages. Brazelton et al. (1969) reported\nsimilar participation of siblings in infant care for the Zinacanteco Indians in southern Mexico.\nIn addition, women other than the mother were also mentioned sharing the task of infant\ncarrying in this region of the world. Among the Dogon of Mali, firstborn sons are\ntraditionally cared for by the maternal grandmother (True et al., 2001). Finally, the account\nby Mead and Macgregor (1951, p. 42) of child care practices in Bali included reference to the\ndiverse interpersonal experiences of Balinese infants who in the course of their first year of\nlife were carried by many different people of both sexes and all ages. Overall, such varied\ntactile experiences are not atypical for infants growing up in highly tactile cultures, as\nmembers of the extended family and wider community in these societies are frequently eager\nto interact with the newest family additions (see, for example, Geber, 1958, on Ugandan and\nRegarding the carrying positions used in different cultures, the back position seems\nmost widespread in Africa, even though carrying cloths may also be tied in a way that makes\nit possible to bring the child around to the side, for example for nursing (Whiting, J. W. M.,\n1981). This is the case among the !Kung San, where children are preferably carried astride\nthe mother's hip (Konner, 1976). In societies on the islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans\nthe side position is more common than the back carry position (Whiting, J. W. M., 1981). In\nthese cultures it is also more common than in Africa to use no carrying device at all.\nFurthermore, the carrying of older children in a pick-a-back fashion was mentioned by Firth\n(1936, p. 141) in his account of infant care in Polynesian Tikopia. The front position, while\nbeing less popular in combination with a carrier, is obviously a common choice when\ncarrying a child in one's arms or as a temporary position during breastfeeding.\nIn most cases the carrying device is a simple piece of clothsome kind of sling or\nshawlthat is hung or tied around the carrier's body, thus forming a pouch to contain the\nchild. According to J. W. M. Whiting (1981), the material of the carrier may in some cultures\nalso be an animal skin, as used by the !Kung (Marshall, L., 1976, p. 315), or a net bag as in\nNew Guinea (see also Mead, 1963, p. 40). J. W. M. Whiting also mentions that many\ncultures, particularly back-carrying cultures, avoid the use of a carrying aid during the child's\nfirst months of life due to the belief that stretching apart the infants' legs to the degree that is\nnecessary to carry them in the back position is harmful to the very young infant. While there\nis usually skin-to-skin contact between carried infant and caregiver in warm climates,\nchildren in cradle cultures, even when held or carried, are typically separated from their\nmother or other caregiver by layers of clothing (Whiting, J. W. M., 1981).\nCosleepingBed Sharing and Room Sharing\nBed sharing across the globe\nThe amount of physical contact experienced by infants during sleep at night is\ncorrelated with the extent of bodily contact they experience during the day. In cultures that\npractice extensive infant carrying, most typically mother and child also share the same bed at\nnight (Lozoff and Brittenham, 1979; Whiting, J. W. M., 1981). Consequently, regional\nNatural Parenting\nvariations in customary sleeping arrangements show a similar distribution across the globe as\nthat presented for infant-carrying practices, with a close link to climatic features of the\nimmediate environment. In a review of a worldwide sample of 136 cultures, 85% of societies\nin hot or mild winter climates were found to practice mother\u00adinfant cosleeping in the same\nbed, while the same was true for only 29% of cultures in cool or cold climatic zones\n(Whiting, J. W. M., 1964). When considering the sample as a whole, bed sharing with one or\nboth parents was typical for young children in 66% of the examined cultures.\nWhile the child's main bed sharing partner is usually the mother, with the father being\nvariably present, it has not been uncommon in some cultures or during certain times in\nhistory for children to have shared a bed with individuals other than their parents, such as\ngrandparents, servants, wet nurses, or siblings (Fildes, 1986, p. 195; Morelli, Rogoff,\n1988, p. 43). Such practices may stand or have stood as independent customs or, more\ncommonly, may have followed at a later age after an initial period of cosleeping in the\nparental bed. Also, bed sharing appears to be a more persistent cultural habit than infant\ncarrying, as it is, or used to be, common in a number of societies that did not necessarily\nprovide their infants with extensive bodily contact during the day (Fontanel and d'Harcourt,\ninfant\u00adparent bed sharing has been the norm in virtually all cultures prior to the 18th to19th\ncentury, with the vast majority of the world population today continuing the practice\nBed sharing in the contemporary West\nSleeping habits in contemporary industrialized countries have changed considerably\nfrom the traditional pattern. Parents and children sharing the same bed during the night is\nnowadays considered the exception rather than the rule in most parts of Western society.\nConcerns about disruption of the parental relationship, poorer quality of sleep, increased\nlikelihood of sexual child abuse, infant suffocation, and the cultivation of \"unhealthy\"\ndependency needs in the child are frequently mentioned reasons for the general disapproval\nof parent\u00adinfant bed sharing (McKenna, 1993; Medoff and Schaefer, 1993; Shweder, Jensen,\nand Goldstein, 1995). An 18-year longitudinal study investigating possible effects of bed\nsharing in infancy and early childhood on later outcomes, however, found no indication of\nany strong associations of bed sharing with either negative or positive outcomes at ages 6 and\nJapan is one of the few industrialized nations where cosleeping is still widely\npracticed (Hobara, 2003; Latz et al., 1999). Yet, occasional bed sharing is not as uncommon\namong Western families as public opinion might lead one to believe. Defining cosleeping as\nparents and children sharing the same bed for all or part of the night, at frequencies from once\na month to every night, different studies on the sleeping habits of Western families have\nreported cosleeping rates of up to 65% for children aged three years or younger (Arnestad,\nAndersen, Vege, and Rognum, 2001; Ball, 2002; Crowell, Keener, Ginsburg, and Anders,\nKo, Hoffman, Kessler, and Corwin, 2003). Equivalent rates for 4- to 10-year-olds and 11- to\nWhen considering customary all night bed sharing only, the prevalence rate for\n(Willinger et al., 2003). The corresponding rate for 2- to 3-year-olds in Massachusetts in the\n1998 have shown a similar rising trend (Arnestad et al., 2001). The prevalence of regular bed\nsharing in an urban Italian sample rose with increasing age of the child, with the respective\nNatural Parenting\nand Ottaviano, 1996). Another recent Italian study reported decreasing rates after the age of\nolds in the sample still regularly cosleeping with their parents (Cortesi, Giannotti, Sebastiani,\nand Vagnoni, 2004). In a British study, habitual parent\u00adinfant bed sharing was reported for\n3.2% of the families during the child's first month of life, and for 2% during the third month\n(Ball, 2002). Hanks and Rebelsky (1977) conducted an inquiry into the views of a small\nsample of middle- to upper-middle-class mothers in suburban Boston who practiced\ncosleeping with their children with varying regularity. Most of the mothers considered the\ncustom a cultural taboo, but generally felt it had positive effects on their children. However,\nsome concerns about negative or mixed effects were voiced, too.\nDifferences in sleeping habits are also found between cultural subgroups within\nWestern societies. In the United States, for instance, cosleeping is considerably more\ncommon in African American, Asian American, and Hispanic families than among\nCaucasians (Brenner et al., 2003; Lozoff, Askew, and Wolf, 1996; Madansky and Edelbrock,\nand Paludetto, 1996), and the same is true of families of Asian origin living in the United\nKingdom (Farooqi, 1994; Gantley et al., 1993) and of Pacific and Maori people in New\nZealand (Abel, Park, Tipene-Leach, Finau, and Lennan, 2001; Tuohy and Smale, 1998). In\nthe United States cosleeping has been found to occur more frequently in lower\nvariable that is closely related to ethnic background. However, Lozoff et al. (1996) found that\nthis tendency held true only for Whites, but not for Blacks, who collectively had a higher\nproportion of habitual cosleepers, irrespective of income level. Together with the findings of\nWillinger et al. (2003), this suggests that sleeping habits are more strongly determined by\nethnicity and culture than by social status.\nSome studies have reported a connection between cosleeping and sleep problems in\nthe child or family stress in general (Lozoff et al., 1996; Lozoff, Wolf, and Davis, 1984,\n1985; Madansky and Edelbrock, 1990). However, these are only correlational findings, which\ndo not permit any conclusions regarding causal relationships. Furthermore, while such an\nassociation seems characteristic of White American families, it is less so for Blacks.\nConsequently, rather than indicating that customary cosleeping of parents and infants is likely\nto lead to sleep or any other problems in the child, these results may instead be a reflection of\nthe differing attitudes towards cosleeping of the two investigated subcultures. In other words,\nbed sharing in the typically anticosleeping-oriented White American culture frequently may\nbe the result of or the parental solution to an infant's sleeping problems, whereas the same\npractice in the Black population is more likely to represent a widely accepted subcultural\ncustom that is routinely practiced from very early in a child's life (see also Young, 1970, p.\n276) and is not specifically associated with sleep-related difficulties (Lozoff et al., 1984,\ncosleeping coined by Madansky and Edelbrock, 1990). A study investigating the prevalence\nof sleep problems in cosleeping children in a sample of 6- to 48-month-old U.S. and Japanese\nchildren attested to the same asymmetrical distribution of sleep-related difficulties in the two\nexamined cultures, which differ greatly in their customary sleeping practices (Latz et al.,\nA recent study has confirmed the existence of two distinct subtypes of\ncosleepingearly cosleeping and reactive cosleepingin a U.S. sample of middle- to upper-\nmiddle-class families with preschool-aged children (Keller, M. A., and Goldberg, 2004).\nBoth early cosleepers (children who started bed sharing in early infancy) and reactive\nNatural Parenting\ncosleepers (children who started bed sharing in their second or third year of life) had more\nfrequent night wakings than solitary sleeping children. However, only mothers of reactive\ncosleepers found these night wakings problematic. There was also a tendency for mothers\nwith reactive cosleeping toddlers to report a greater frequency of bedtime struggles than\nmothers in the two other groups. In addition, mothers of early cosleeping toddlers had the\nmost positive attitudes towards bed sharing, mothers of solitary sleepers were most favorable\ntowards solitary sleep, with mothers of reactive cosleepers falling in between these two\ngroups.\nRoom sharing across the globe\nWhen extending the examination of worldwide sleeping customs to include the\npractice of room sharing, the industrialized West still holds an exceptional position among all\ncultures of the world. In 1961, Burton and Whiting reported that U.S. middle class families\nwere the only ones in a cross-cultural sample of more than 100 societies who put their young\ninfants to sleep in a separate room. Barry and Paxson (1971) further presented data on the\nsleeping habits of 171 societies out of a representative cross-cultural sample of 186 societies\ncompiled by Murdock and White (1969), showing that in every society, children slept in the\nsame room with either one or both of their parents. More specifically, bed sharing was\nassuredly practiced in at least 76 of the 171 societies, room sharing with possible bed sharing\noccurred in 55 of the examined societies, and in the remaining 40 societies, children typically\nslept in their mother's or parents' room, but on a separate sleeping surface.\nRoom sharing in the contemporary West\nRegarding the prevalence of nightly room sharing in Western industrialized countries,\na study conducted in the U.S. found that 12% of the 2-year-old children in the studied sample\nslept in their parents' bedroom, while 40% of the children shared a room with a sibling\ninfant\u00adparent room sharing for a sample of 18- to 36-month-old American infants. Results\nfrom a number of other studies provide similar evidence of the American preference for\nseparate sleeping quarters. For instance, even though 15 out of 18 couples studied by Morelli\net al. (1992) decided to share a room with their newborn child, only 42% of these children\nwere still in the parents' bedroom by the age of 3 months, with the figure falling to 20% at 6\nmonths. Upon moving out of the parental bedroom most second- and laterborn children were,\nhowever, located in a room with a sibling. A similar account given by Hong and Townes in\n1976 reported room sharing rates of 45% for under-2-month-olds, decreasing to 25% after the\nage of 3 months, and further decreasing to 2% at the age of 6 months. Most of the room\nsharing rates as cited above are rates of sole room sharing that do not include any instances of\nbed sharing. Generally speaking, most middle-class U.S. infants have a sleeping place outside\ntheir parents' bedroom by the age of 6 months (see also Keener, Zeanah, and Anders, 1988;\nLatz et al., 1999; Richman, Miller, and Solomon, 1988). A similar trend was noticed in a\nsample of Australian families (Buckley, P., Rigda, Mundy, and McMillen, 2002), and parent\u00ad\ninfant room sharing rates in a Swiss study also showed a decline from 20% at 1 month to 4%\nat age 1 (Jenni, Zinggeler Fuhrer, Iglowstein, Molinari, and Largo, 2003). In a White British\nsample, 61% of the children slept in the parents' bedroom during their first year of life\n(Farooqi, 1994). Regarding parent\u00adinfant room sharing rates in families with 3-month-old\ninfants, an international study on typical sleeping arrangements in 17 countries reported high\nfigures for most industrialized nations included in the investigation, with the reported values\nranging between 46% (New Zealand) and 95% (Sweden) (Nelson et al., 2001). Again, room\nsharing rates for certain subcultures or rates in certain geographical regions in the\nNatural Parenting\nindustrialized West can be considerably higher than the averages (see, for instance, Brenner\nInfant Feeding\nThe following account of past and present approaches to infant feeding mainly draws\ntogether provide a comprehensive historical overview of the changing trends in infant feeding\npractices in different parts of the world. When additional sources are used to fill in details,\nthese are indicated.\nWet nursing\nBreast milk, either that of an infant's own mother or of another woman, can with great\ncertainty be assumed to have been the sole source of nourishment for human infants during\nmost of our history. However in antiquity, the custom arose of specifically employing other\nwomenso-called wet nursesto nurse and care for one's children. In Egypt, wives of\npharaohs are known to have delegated the task of nursing their infants to other women, and\nparents in ancient Rome could hire suitable young women at the market for this purpose. First\nrestricted to the upper class, the practice slowly spread over the centuries, and finally also\nincluded the middle class. By the 18th century, wet nurses were common in much of Europe.\nnursed by their mothers; all others were cared for by wet nurses. Yet, the wet-nursing\nbusiness was largely limited to families in urban centers, where the practice survived until the\nearly 20th century. Also, given that Europe was mainly rural up to this point in history, the\nmajority of infants were still breast-fed by their own mothers throughout these times.\nArtificial feeding\nFrom very early in history, ways had to be found to feed infants who for some reason\ncould not be nursed by their mothers or wet nurses. When a mother was ill or too weak to\nnurse her child or when she had died in childbirth, for infants with a contagious illness such\nas syphilis and those in orphanages, substitute feeding was a necessity. Cow's milk, goat's\nmilk, and donkey's milk were used, sometimes by feeding the infants directly from the\nanimal's teats. More frequently, bottles manufactured of diverse materials such as glass,\nceramics, porcelain, animal horns, leather, wood, and metal were utilized. To slow down the\nmilk flow to a manageable rate, openings that were too big were partly obstructed with a\npiece of cloth or leather, or a sponge. The artificial nipple was only invented in the late 16th\ncentury in Sweden.\nSome mothers also chose bottle-feeding voluntarily, depending on the sociocultural\ntrend of the day. Others merely supplemented breast milk with animal's milk. Due to long-\nstanding customs, infants in some areas of preindustrial Europe (e.g., parts of Germany,\nAustria, Northern Italy, Russia, and Scandinavia), for instance, were rarely or never\nbreastfed, neither by their mothers nor by wet nurses. In some of these regions, the practice of\nartificial feeding from birth dated back to at least the 15th century. A common denominator of\nthese areas was the cold, dry climate, which made the storage of substitute foods easier and\nthus made the foods less susceptible to spoiling. Throughout history, many cultures have also\nheld that colostrum, a mother's first milk, is unsuitable for a newborn and have instead\nrecommended another woman's more mature breast milk, various medicinal or ritual\nsubstances, or a purge such as the popular concoction of oil or butter of sweet almonds mixed\nwith honey, sugar or syrup.\nNatural Parenting\nAt the end of the 17th century in England bottle-feeding was considered best and was\nendorsed by the royal doctors. It also became increasingly popular in France, but the majority\nof the medical profession still mistrusted artificial feeding practices, as they undeniably led to\nhigher infant mortality rates. This was attributable to the unsanitary conditions under which\nbreast-milk substitutes were stored, prepared and offered, frequently leading to severe\ngastrointestinal infections and, ultimately, death. Nonetheless, bottle-feeding again became\ncommon in the late 19th century, and the first artificial formula was invented in 1867 by a\nGerman chemist.\nIn the Middle Ages, it was also popular to give infants, from their earliest days, a\nthick, soft cereal, pap, made of bread or flour cooked in milk or water, with the occasional\naddition of wine or beer, and sometimes honey. However, by the 18th century pap suffered\nmounting criticism from doctors who blamed it for increasing infants' risk of death. And\nindeed, the mortality of infants who were not breastfed was considerably higher than that of\nchildren who received breast milk, with figures over 50%, and up to 90%, being commonly\nreported. Yet, supplemental foods of the kind mentioned continued to be used until the first\ndecades of the 20th century.\nThe industrial revolutiondecline of breastfeeding\nWith the advent of the industrial revolution the incidence of breastfeeding declined\nmost sharply in the urban centers, as many women left their children in the care of others in\norder to take paid work. In most of rural Europe, however, many women continued to follow\nthe traditional pattern of nursing their infants, just as their own mothers had done. Data on\ninfant feeding practices from the 1890s show that in many urban areas four out of five\nmothers still breastfed their infants, wholly or partially, particularly during the child's first\nthree months of life, although rates for highly industrialized areas were lower. In some of\nEngland's centers of the textile industry, for instance, 40\u00ad50% of infants were totally weaned\nfrom the breast by the age of six months. In less industrialized towns, on the other hand, only\n30% of the children had been totally switched to other foods during the second half of their\nfirst year. The situation in North America was comparable. Similarly, in the years 1907\u00ad1910\nFrench infants in the more industrialized parts of the country were breastfed in less than 40%\nof the cases compared to more than 60% in rural areas.\nIt was, however, the development of evaporated and condensed milk, as well as the\nintroduction of pasteurization and the increasing sterilization of feeding bottles, that finally\nmade artificial feeding a relatively safe alternative to breast milk. The rapid\ncommercialization of artificial baby food that followed contributed to the wide acceptance\nthat infant formula soon found among the general public, reflected in the hundred varieties of\nsubstitute milk already available for sale in 1911. Doctors, too, endorsed the use of infant\nformulas, and within a relatively short time, bottle-feeding became the norm, and breast-\nfeeding unfashionable. Also, the use of artificial milk was in many cases considered more\nconvenient than breastfeeding.\nThe medicalization of the birth process at the beginning of the 20th century, increasing\nmother\u00adinfant separation, and the introduction of widely-spaced and scheduled feedings\nfurther tipped the scales in favor of artificial feeding, as these forms of interference seriously\nhamper the natural interplay between mother and newborn that is necessary to get\nbreastfeeding off to a good start. Perceived milk insufficiency is a frequent consequence,\nresulting in the early termination of breastfeeding (Gussler and Briesemeister, 1980). In the\n1940s, for example, only 20\u00ad30% of American infants were still breastfed by their mothers.\nIn comparison, surveys in the United States, Great Britain, and Australia during the first two\ndecades of the 20th century had reported overall breastfeeding rates of about 75\u00ad90% for\ninfants less than one month old.\nNatural Parenting\nBreastfeeding rates in the industrialized West remained low during the following\ndecades. The percentage of women in the U.S. who initiated breastfeeding after giving birth\nthe world were also affected by the expanding infant formula business. In developing\ncountries the marketing of breast milk substitutes resulted in a substantial decrease in\nbreastfeeding rates, which had traditionally been high. As hygiene and medical care are often\npoor in these countries, the introduction of artificial feeding has had devastating effects on\ninfant mortality rates, continuing to this day.\nFeeding practices reassessed\nStarting in the 1960s and -70s, however, an increasingly strong counter-movement\nbegan to bring about noticeable change in the general attitude towards breastfeeding. The\nnatural childbirth movement, which also emphasized the importance of nursing and early\nmother\u00adchild contact, a mounting body of knowledge about the benefits of breastfeeding,\ngreater awareness among health professionals, as well as more recent changes at the level of\npublic health policies all played a part. The 1970s saw major international efforts to restrict\nthe marketing of breast milk substitutes in developing countries, culminating in 1981 in the\nWHO/UNICEF International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes (WHO). The\nCode's ultimate goal is to contribute to the provision of adequate and safe infant nutrition\nworldwide. It aims to protect and promote breastfeeding by underscoring its benefits and\nfurther suggests appropriate ways of handling the marketing and distribution of breast milk\nsubstitutes, where necessary, in order to ensure their proper and safe use. The work has\nshown results. In some less-developed countries, for example, a doctor's prescription is now\nneeded to buy infant formula. Breastfeeding initiation rates in Western industrialized nations\nwere also affected by the change in attitude, and the historically low figures of the mid-20th\ncentury were followed by a clear upward trend. In the U.S., after reaching their lowest point\nnot reach the levels of earlier years, but the mid-1990s showed a return to the relatively high\nCurrent situation\nIn 2001, in the U.S., the rate of children who were breastfed in the hospital after birth\nwas 69.5%, but only 32.5% of mothers were still breastfeeding their infants at the age of six\nmonths (Ryan, Wenjun, and Acosta, 2002). A smaller-scale survey in the same year that had\nrevealed somewhat lower figures for the immediate postpartum period and for the age of six\nmonths, reported that the rate dropped to 12.3% by the time the children reached their first\nbirthday (Li, Zhao, Mokdad, Barker, and Grummer-Strawn, 2003). In this same survey, the\nexclusive breastfeeding rate at six months was 7.9%. For comparison, a study of Danish\nbreastfeeding, and continued breastfeeding at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months was still observed\nrespectively in 71%, 52%, 33%, and 19% of the cases (Michaelsen, Larsen, Thomsen, and\nSamuelson, 1994). The percentage of children exclusively breastfed at the age of six months\nwas 9.7%. Overall, as data from the continuously updated WHO Global Data Bank on\nBreastfeeding and Complementary Feeding (WHO, n.d.) indicate, breastfeeding initiation\nrates in most of Europe are high at the turn of the 21st century. The ever-breastfed rate for\nunder-1-year-olds in much of Northern Europe as well as in Austria, Romania, Croatia, and\nSlovenia ranges from 93% to 98%. Somewhat lower figures are reported for Luxembourg,\nGermany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom: 88%, 86%, 75%, and 69%, respectively,\nwhile the corresponding rate for France is 49%. Canada's rate (79%) is similar to the average\nNatural Parenting\nEuropean figures. Even though rates of continued breastfeeding at later ages are available for\nonly part of Europe, a consistent decline throughout the child's first year of life is noticeable.\nThe average duration of breastfeeding in Croatia, Germany, Luxembourg, and Romania is 4,\n6, 6, and 8 months, respectively. The respective proportions of 12 to 15-month-old children in\nCroatia, Iceland, the United Kingdom, and Norway that are still breastfed are 2%, 13%, 25%,\nand 40%. Exclusive breastfeeding rates for under-4-month-olds in those countries for which\ndata are reported are as follows: 29% in the United Kingdom, 37% in the Netherlands, 51%\nin Poland, 54% in Luxembourg, 66% in Denmark, and 70% in Iceland.\nWorldwide, it is estimated that about 35% of all infants under the age of four months\nare exclusively breastfed today, with the median duration of breastfeeding being around one\nand a half years (WHO, 1996). These estimates are based on information from nationally\nrepresentative surveys that cover 58% of the world's infant population, with industrialized\nnations being heavily underrepresented in this sample. Local variations are great (WHO,\n1996), with, for example, Niger having a 1% exclusive breastfeeding rate for under-4-month-\nSpecifics of breastfeeding\nRegarding breastfeeding duration during most of human history, bone analyses of\nprehistoric skeletons, historical evidence dating back to antiquity, more recent ethnographic\ndata from traditional societies, as well as research into the age at onset of lactose intolerance\nin various ethnic groups (a probable indicator of weaning age in ancient times) all point to the\nage range of two to three years as the most likely weaning age in prehistoric times. It is\nfurther assumed that weaning has usually been a gradual process during which breast milk\nwas increasingly substituted by other foods. As far as feeding style is concerned, feeding on\ndemand seems to have been the norm, during both day and night. Observations among\nmodern hunter-gatherer societies confirm the commonness of this approach. The !Kung San\nin Botswana and Namibia and the Aka in Central Africa, for instance, suckle their infants on\nFor the time period from the Middle Ages up till the 19th century, most infants in\nEurope were typically weaned between the age of one and two years, with some variation\nacross regions and times. Up till the mid-18th century, demand feeding was still the most\ncommon approach to breastfeeding. After that, however, the idea of nursing according to a\nschedule was introduced and practiced to varying degrees. All in all, the present pattern in\nmany industrialized countries of widely spaced and scheduled feedings, early elimination of\nnight feedings, use of supplementation with artificial formula, and weaning before the child's\nfirst birthday, is a historically very recent development that is in conflict with the\nevolutionary environment in which the human infant's nutritional system was shaped into its\npresent form.\nSummary and Conclusion\nThe concluding historical and cross-cultural overview of the prevalence of (aspects\nof) natural parenting demonstrates how, in the course of history, Western societies have\ndrifted away from what used to be the intuitive approach to taking care of our young.\nAlthough the most basic aspects of parenting are hardwired into the human caregiving system\nand have thus been preserved to the present day, many other facets of traditional caregiving\nhave been overlaid by various cultural beliefs and customs. Yet, when considering all the\nevidence presented, natural parenting seems to provide the human infant with an ideal\nenvironment for optimal growth both psychologically and physiologically. For about a\ndecade, the new discipline of ethnopediatrics, an evolutionary and cross-culturally informed\nNatural Parenting\nscience, has been drawing attention to the interplay of biological and cultural influences on\ncaregiving traditions and resulting consequences on the wellbeing of the child, and has been\ncalling for a broader view of parenting and a reexamination of established Western\nchildrearing beliefs (overview: Small, 1998). This paper represents one contribution to this\ndeveloping field of science.\nAs in every new field of investigation, there are naturally still many gaps in\nknowledge to be filled. For some of the presented topics, data on humans is still scarce, and\nresults from animal research relevant to the human case have been presented instead. In other\ninstances, in the absence of data from healthy populations, data from clinical populations\nwere used to illuminate general processes assumed to be largely unaffected by clinical status.\nOn the positive side, extreme cases can also serve as a magnifying-glass, revealing\nconnections between phenomena that may otherwise go unnoticed. Moreover, some of the\nreported findings have not yet been replicated, and contradictory results exist in a few of the\ndiscussed areas. However, in its entirety the large body of knowledge generated by\nindependent studies from diverse disciplines, designed with many different, frequently\nunrelated, research questions in mind, conveys a strong message. Most importantly, the\nindividual findings in combination reveal an intricately interwoven whole, where one aspect\nfeeds into the other, and where all parts are connected.\nPhysical proximity between caregiver and infant embedded in a caregiving\nenvironment characterized by sensitivity to the child's needs is the substratum that allows the\ncaregiver\u00adinfant relationship to blossom and is the central link to many other aspects of\nsensitive caregiving. By providing the newborn with an extended womb experience that\ngradually transforms into increasing independence one acknowledges the immaturity of\nhuman newborns due to evolutionary pressure and their innate need for continuous care\nduring the early months of life. Close contact with the infant permits the mother to perceive\nand promptly respond to the infant's subtle signals and to get acquainted with the child's\nidiosyncratic preferences, thus fostering sensitive mothering. Frequent breastfeeding on\ndemand is facilitated, therefore ensuring optimal nutrition for the child according to a natural\nschedule most suited to the dyad in question. Flexible breastfeeding on cue further ensures an\nadequate milk supply for extended breastfeeding and can prevent many potential\nbreastfeeding problems. At the same time, breastfeeding is associated with emotional and\nhealth benefits for the mother and decreased morbidity in the child. Mother\u00adinfant cosleeping\noffers the child continuity of care around the clock, supports the breastfeeding process, and if\npracticed safely, possibly even decreases the infant's SIDS risk. Continuous proximity with\nthe child also allows the caregiver to be aware of the child's elimination functions and to\nrespectfully attend to these needs. Moreover, touch and skin-to-skin contact have been\nassociated with many important physiological processes such as thermal regulation, physical\ngrowth, decreased stress hormone levels, and enhanced immune function.\nWhen further considering that bodily touch, movement stimulation, and familiar\nsounds signal safety to a newborn, and given the fact that physical contact is often the only\nintervention in early life that can calm a distressed infant, then the development of basic trust\nin one's world (Erikson, 1963) and thus the formation of a secure attachment to one's\ncaregiver can be concluded to be greatly facilitated by the provision of an immediate\npostnatal environment that recreates the familiar atmosphere of the womb. By offering the\nchild such a tangibly secure and predictable environment for early growth, parents tailor their\ncaregiving behaviors to match the emotional needs and the limited cognitive and perceptual\nabilities of their newborn. Over time, as close physical proximity as a sign of secure parental\npresence slowly decreases in importance and as distal interactions become more meaningful\nto the child, caregiving practices can be adjusted accordingly, with the whole process\nreflecting a secure and smooth transition from pre- to postnatal life. In that way, backed up by\nNatural Parenting\nsuch a history of emotional security, the child gradually grows and is released into increasing\nindependence rather than being pushed to that stage abruptly and prematurely right after\nbirth. Increasing knowledge regarding the decisive early stages of brain development further\nsuggests that repeated positive experiences in early life leave distinct traces in the initially\nhighly plastic physiological matrix that forms the basis for all subsequent development.\nAt its best, natural parenting is truly sensitive parenting in a narrow (Ainsworthian) as\nwell as in a broader sense. Not surprisingly, then, there is also some indication that natural\nparenting indeed fosters secure attachment in the child. However, more research is needed\nbefore any definite statement on this subject is possible. The issue is further complicated by\nthe possibility that parents with high levels of caregiving sensitivity may feel particularly\ndrawn to a natural approach to parenting. Assessments of attachment security in cultures for\nwhich this approach is common practice may help to shed light on the possible interaction of\nparental characteristics and caregiving style in determining security of attachment. Although\nit is known that the quality of infants' attachment relationships with their parents is to a large\npart influenced by the parents' mental representations of their own childhood attachment\nexperiences, which in turn are associated with parental responsiveness to the infants' signals\n(review: van IJzendoorn, 1995), a significant number of studies have shown that it is also\npossible to change parental caregiving behavior and thus influence infants' attachment\nsecurity with specific interventions (review: Bakermans-Kranenburg et al., 2003). More\nspecifically, interventions that were able to increase maternal sensitivity were usually also\naccompanied by a positive change in attachment security. It is therefore an interesting\nquestion how successful natural parenting could be as a preventive intervention starting at\nbirth and aimed at enhancing parental sensitivity and fostering secure infant\u00adparent\nattachment relationships in samples at risk for insensitive parenting and insecure attachment.\nIn Anisfeld et al.'s (1990) study, the regular use of an infant carrier, in the absence of explicit\nteaching of other natural parenting strategies, already had significant beneficial effects on\nmaternal behavior and infant attachment security in a sample of low-SES mothers and their\ninfants.\nThere may be critical voices arguing that no single caregiving approach can possibly\nbe adaptive in the wide variety of circumstances characterizing current human living. This\nview may seemingly receive support from the fact that human infants are astonishingly\nresilient beings that have adapted to and survived in diverse conditions of care (Small, 1998).\nThere is no question that the details of caregiving will always reflect the particularities of the\nmicro- and macroculture in which the child is raised. However, natural parenting is not a\nnarrow prescription for parenting without room for individual variation. As examples from\ndifferent societies demonstrate, there are many varied ways in which natural parenting\nprinciples can be put into practice. Whether multiple caregiving, including breastfeeding,\namong the Ef\u00e9 in Za\u00efre (Tronick et al., 1985), extensive involvement of maternal\ngrandmothers in the care of firstborn sons among the Dogon in Mali (True et al., 2001), the\ndelegation of a substantial portion of infant care to child caregivers among the Gusii people\nin Kenya (LeVine et al., 1996), or primarily mother-based care during the first year among\nthe !Kung San (Konner, 1976), they all reflect different possible solutions to the task of\nreconciling natural infant care with other parental duties. The common denominator,\nhowever, is the "
