The sample proportion is then a\nbiased estimator of the true proportion. The standard\nstatistical approach to adjustment for this potential\nbias is to estimate the probability of each respondent's\nparticipating in the survey and to assign each obser-\nvation a weight inversely proportional to that proba-\nbility (1). This form of weighting is quite different\nfrom weighting in inverse proportion to variance in\nregression analysis, where the objective is variance\nreduction rather than reduction of bias from differen-\ntial inclusion probabilities.\nAlthough the use of survey weights for analytic\ninferences such as regression is still debated (1-6),\nmost statisticians advocate the use of weights for es-\ntimates of prevalence and other descriptive means and\ntotals. A common disadvantage of weighting is an\nincrease in the variance of the estimator.

Little, University of Michigan,\nassumptions, the added variance can be expressed as\nVw\n= VB\n(see Kish (1) and Potter (7), for example), where Vu\nis\nthe variance of the unweighted prevalence estimate,\nVw\nis the variance of the weighted prevalence, and\nsi, is the sample variance of the weights, assumed to be\nscaled to average unity. This formula does not apply\nexactly to stratified multistage surveys involving post-\nstratification but has proven to be a useful rule of\nthumb in some surveys (for example, see Verma et al.\n(8)). Since weighting is questionable when added vari-\nance dominates bias reduction (1), modifications of\nthe weights to reduce variance, such as trimming (7),\nare common in practice.\nDoes weighting improve inferences in practice?\nThis depends on the nature of the weighting adjust-\nments in particular surveys and how they relate to the\nsurvey outcomes. Korn and Graubard (12, 13) studied\nthe effects of weighting in large health surveys. Here,\nwe study weighting adjustments for the National Co-\nmorbidity Survey (NCS), a major epidemiologic in-\nvestigation of the prevalence, risk factors, and conse-\nquences of psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity in\nthe United States (14). Specific questions addressed\ninclude: How much bias is incurred from ignoring the\nweights? How much variance is added from weight-\ning, and is it justified by reduced bias? How well is the\nadded variance predicted using equation 1? How suc-\ncessful are weight trimming methods in reducing the\nincrease in variance while at the same time adjusting\nfor bias? Weight components are considered individ-\nually as well as in combination in addressing these\nquestions. Implications of our answers for other men-\ntal health surveys are discussed.\nThe scope of this paper is limited to estimators of\nthe prevalences of psychiatric disorders, nationally\nand in one population subgroup. We describe four\n\"participation factors\" that affect the probability that a\ngiven subject is sampled and participates in the NCS.\nWe describe how these probabilities and the corre-\nsponding weights are estimated, poststratified, and\ntrimmed. We then examine the effect of the weights,\nindividually and in combination, on the bias, variance,\nand mean squared error of our estimates.\nThe National Comorbidity Survey\nThe NCS was a general population survey carried\nfactors, and consequences associated with various psy-\nchiatric disorders (14). It was based on a stratified,\nmultistage area probability sample of persons aged\n15-54 years in the noninstitutionalized civilian popu-\nrespondents participated in the survey, resulting in a\nresponse rate of 82.4 percent. Our analysis focused on\nestimates of prevalence of the 14 main psychiatric\ndisorders diagnosed for the full sample: alcohol abuse\nor dependency, depression, social phobia, conduct dis-\norder, drug abuse, simple phobia, agoraphobia, dys-\nthymia, antisocial behavior, anxiety disorder, panic\ndisorder, antisocial personality, mania, and hypoma-\nnia. Each disorder was treated as a dichotomous vari-\nable. Diagnoses were based on the diagnostic system\nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R) (15),\ngenerated from a modified version of the Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview (16), a structured\ninterview designed to be used by trained interviewers\nwho are not clinicians.\nWeighting methodology for the NCS\nThe NCS was designed to yield an equal probability\nsample of households. However, the probability of\nparticipation varied because of four main factors: a\nwithin-household factor, a hold-back factor, a new\nconstruction factor, and a unit nonresponse factor. For\neach respondent, weights were estimated for each of\nthese factors and were multiplied together to obtain the\noverall weight, which was inversely proportional to\nthe estimated probability of participation.\nAs is common in surveys of this kind, the weights in\nthis process were modified in an attempt to improve\ntheir statistical properties. The highest values of indi-\nvidual and final weights were trimmed back to reduce\nvariance. The trimmed final weight was poststratified\nto adjust for differences between our sample and na-\ntional data available from a larger survey. Finally, the\nresulting poststratified weights were again trimmed.\nOur goal was to examine the impact of this complex\nweighting process on prevalence estimates.\nWithin-household weight. Interviewers were in-\nstructed to select at random one person aged 15-54\nyears from each selected household for interview, and\nonly these target respondents were interviewed. Thus,\nindividuals in large households had a smaller chance\nof selection. Specifically, if a target respondent was\nsuccessfully interviewed in a household containing k\npeople between the ages of 15 and 54 years, the\nrespondent had a Ilk probability of being selected as\nthe target from that household and therefore received\na within-household weight proportional to k. Two ad-\njustments were made to this basic procedure. First,\npeople aged 15-24 years tend to live in large house-\nholds; to increase the sample size for this group, each\nhousehold member aged 15-24 was double-listed prior\nto selection for a random one third of all targeted\nhouseholds. The within-household weight for these\nrespondents was adjusted to account for this double\nrespondents had within-household weights greater\nthan 6. These respondents had their weights trimmed\nto a value of 6. The final distribution of the within-\nhousehold weights is shown in figure 1. Scaled to\nHold-back weight The survey was conducted in\nsix phases, or rotations, each in itself a nationally\nrepresentative random sample. For completion of as\nmuch of the final rotation as possible, near the close of\nfieldwork targeted individuals in the final rotation who\nhad not yet been successfully interviewed were ran-\ndomly divided into two halves. One half was \"held\nback,\" and interviewers focused their efforts on the\nother half. Each interviewed subject in the half not\nheld back was then assigned a hold-back weight pro-\nportional to 2, whereas all other respondents received\na hold-back weight proportional to 1. Only 3.3 percent\nof respondents received the larger of the two hold-\nback weights, so the impact of the hold-back weight\non variance was expected to be minor. Scaled to\nwith a standard deviation of 0.17.\nWeighting for the National Comorbidity Survey 441\nWeight range\nFIGURE 1. Frequency distribution of within-household weights in\nare the actual histogram frequencies.\nNew construction weight. As in many multistage\nhousehold surveys, the primary sampling units and\nsecondary sampling units were selected with probabil-\nity proportional to 1980 US Census household totals.\nThe number of sample households from a secondary\nsampling unit thus varied according to the ratio of the\ncurrent number of households to the 1980 Census\nmeasure of size. Excessive interviewer workloads re-\nsulted in 34 secondary sampling units, mainly because\nof large-scale housing construction undertaken since\nthe 1980 Census. To reduce interviewer burden in\nthese secondary sampling units, households were ran-\ndomly subsampled with rates from one half to one fifth\nbefore the sample was released to the field. Respon-\ndents then received new construction weights ranging\ninitially from 2 to 5, compared with 1 for other re-\nspondents. Less than 1 percent of the 8,098 observa-\ntions with new construction weights greater than 3\nwere later trimmed to a value of 3. Since less than 4\npercent of the sample had new construction weights\nmore than 1, the impact of this weighting adjustment\nwas expected to be minor. Scaled to average unity,\nNonresponse weight. Previous research has shown\nthat nonrespondents in mental health surveys have\nhigher rates of psychiatric disorders than respondents\n(17, 18). To assess this issue in the NCS, a nonrespon-\ndent survey was carried out, consisting of a brief\n(20-minute) screening interview administered to a\nprobability sample of nonrespondents. The interview\nincluded screening questions selected from the larger\ninterview for the main DSM-HI-R disorders, as well as\nquestions on basic demographic data. Of the 831 non-\ncontacted (mainly because they had moved and could\nnot be traced), and 350 refused to participate. The\nrelatively high interview rate (50 percent) among the\ncontacted participants was achieved by the low burden\ncoupled with a substantial financial incentive ($50).\nParticipants in the nonrespondent study did, in fact,\nreport higher prevalences of most DSM-ITf-R disor-\nders than respondents (19). The bias was adjusted by\nmeans of a two-step weighting process. First, the 353\nparticipants in the nonrespondent survey were\nweighted using the method of propensity score adjust-\nment (20) to match the distribution of all NCS nonre-\nspondents on 1) household characteristics recorded at\nfirst attempted contact (for example, whether there\nwere \"No Trespassing\" signs posted) and 2) block-\nlevel characteristics from the 1990 Census (for exam-\nple, percentage of block residents living in poverty and\npercentage living alone). Second, the respondents\nwere weighted using a second propensity-score adjust-\nment to match the combined distribution of respon-\ndents and nonrespondents on variables appearing in\nboth the full and nonrespondent interviews. The final\ndistribution of nonresponse weights is shown in figure\n2. Scaled to average unity, they ranged from 0.81 to\nPoststratification and posttrimming. The weighted\ndistribution of NCS participants across demographic\ngroups was compared with the distribution estimated\nWeight range\nFIGURE 2. Frequency distribution of nonresponse weights in the\nthe actual histogram frequencies.\nfrom the 1989 National Health Interview Survey\n(NfflS) (21). The NHIS measured this distribution\nmore precisely, since it was based on a much larger\nsample with a very high response rate. Poststratifica-\ntion was applied to adjust the NCS distribution across\ndemographic groups to match the NHIS distribution.\nTo the extent that the prevalence of a given psychiatric\ndisorder is correlated with these demographic vari-\nables, poststratification improves the NCS estimate of\nthe national prevalence of this disorder (10, 22). A\ndemographic variable was included in the poststratifi-\ncation if 1) reliable NHIS data were available, 2) its\ndata distribution in the NHIS differed from the distri-\nbution in the NCS, and 3) the variable was signifi-\ncantly related to the DSM-III-R disorders. The number\nof poststrata was limited to eight to avoid excess\nvariance that arose when the NCS respondents were\ntoo sparsely distributed across the categories. The final\npoststrata were:\n1. High school education or less, lives with others.\n2. High school education or less, lives alone.\n3. More than high school education, lives alone,\npie.\n4.

In order to\nminimize seasonality effects, poststratification was\napplied separately to each of the 12 monthly sam-\nples in a year. The resulting poststratification\nweights were then multiplied by the product of the\nfour weights described above to yield poststratified\nweights. A final trimming reduced all weights fall-\ning into the highest 1.5th percentile to the 98.5th\npercentile. The distribution of the final weights after\npoststratification and trimming is shown in figure 3.\nWeight range\nFIGURE 3. Frequency distribution of final weights in the National\nhistogram frequencies.\nVariance estimation\nThe variance of estimates was estimated using the\njackknife repeated replications method, which ac-\ncounts for the complex sample design (2, 23). The\nreplications were 2H = 84 sampling error computation\nunits, consisting of 46 primary sampling units sampled\nwith a probability less than 1 and 38 random groupings\nof secondary sampling units within primary sampling\nunits selected with a probability of 1. These 84 sam-\npling error computation units were classified into H =\n42 relatively homogeneous randomly ordered pairs\naccording to geography and urbanicity. For example,\none replicate contained two urban northeastern pri-\nmary sampling units, another contained two farm belt\nrural primary sampling units, and so on.\nLet Qw\nbe the estimate of a prevalence 0 for some\nweighting scheme w. For j -- 1, ..., H, let 0jj be the\nestimate computed like Qw\n(including poststratifica-\ntion if Qw\nis poststratified), but with the weight for the\nfirst of the two randomly ordered primary sampling\nunits in theyth replicate doubled and the weight of the\nsecond primary sampling unit in theyth replicate set to\nzero. The estimated variance of 9U\n, is then\nK, =\nWeighting for the National Comorbidity Survey 443\nMethodology for assessment of weighting\nadjustments\nVariance comparisons. For a prevalence 0 of\nthe population, let Qu\nbe an unweighted estimate from\nthe sample and let 0^ be an estimate for some weight-\ning scheme. Let Vu\nand Vw\ndenote the variances of Qu\nand Qw\n, and Vu\nand Vw\nestimates of these quantities\nobtained from jackknifing the replicates. These esti-\nmates are compared directly to assess precision. The\ndirect estimate Vw\nis also compared with the rule-of-\nthumb estimate from substituting Vu\nfor Vu\nin equation\n1, to assess the utility of that formula.\nBias and mean squared error comparisons. To es-\ntimate bias and mean squared^ error, it is necessary to\nassume that one estimator--0O\n, for example--is un-\nbiased. For our analyses, we take as 0O\nthe estimator\nwith all of the design and nonresponse weights in-\ncluded, and a poststratification adjustment to improve\nprecision and reduce bias from limitations in the sam-\npling frame. Let 0 , be an estimator of 0 for some\nother weighting scheme--the unweighted estimator,\nfor example--with unknown bias 5,. Let Vo\nand V{\ndenote the variances of 0O\nand 0,, respectively, and\nand MSE, denote the mean squared errors;\nthus, by definition, MSE[ = B\\ + Vu\nand by as-\nsumption MSE0\n= Vo\n. In addition, f ( 0 , - 0O\n) = Bx\nis the vari-\n. Let Vo\n, Vx\nbe jackknife\nrepeated replications estimates of Vo\n, Vx\n.\nis a consistent estimator of the\nbias of 0,, MSEg = Vo\n, and\nis a consistent estimate of the mean squared error of\n0,. Equation 2 is a refinement of the mean squared\nerror estimates presented by Kish (1) in that the sub-\ntraction of Vo\n, in the last term corrects for upward bias\nof B\\ as an estimate of the squared bias. The last term\nin equation 2 is constrained to be nonnegative, since it\nis estimating a nonnegative quantity. This adjustment\nseems justified, although it destroys exact unbiased-\nness. Results with regard to bias and mean squared\nerror should be interpreted cautiously, since they de-\npend on the choice of estimator 0O\n, and the bias may\nnot be very precisely determined.\nRESULTS\nCombined weighting adjustments\nTable 1 summarizes estimated overall prevalences\nof the 14 disorders for four weighting options, namely\n1) unweighted, 2) weighted without poststratification\nor trimming, 3) poststratified, weighted with no trim-\nI\nI\nJ\na\n\u00b7a\n5 in o> <y w i n r - c o COCM J W Q N\nO p *~m\n^ C w ^ CO I-^T\"; CO O5 CO C\nM\nd ^ T^ T^ d do\" do do dodd\n(Dinins m ^t-1- oo co C\nM oi N- co co o\ni n i n o q c q \u00bb-; CM CM CM CO CM *\u00b7; , -fcj^ T-\nr^r^T^r1 O O O OO* O O O\nO\nO\nO\n^u ^~ (\nM ^^ oo co ^r co co in ^^ oo co co ^f\nN 1 - t J r; r^ C\\j CO CO tt ^S ^M *7 \u00b0. ^ ^\nco-^ co co d d o d o d o \u00a9 ^ d \u00a9\nSISgin\nm co m m\nO) O> C\ni-- r\n-- r\u00ab* r^\nCD m co in\n*t & m pi\nOJ\no\nS\no\no o\ncoS\no o\nC\nD\nin ^i\no o\nen m\nS> r-\no o\no o\n^ r^ co\nO i- O O\nt- CD in op\nOOOO\nming, and 4) the final weight, with poststratification\nand trimming. The disorders are listed in the order of\ndecreasing prevalence, as estimated by option 4 above.\nEstimated standard errors are shown, together with\npredicted standard errors for the weighted methods\nbased on equation 1. Root mean squared errors are\nalso tabulated according to the methods presented\nabove, with method 3 assumed to be unbiased. If this\nassumption is incorrect, root mean squared error re-\nsults are biased in favor of method 3.\nOther things being equal, variance increases as a\nfraction of mean squared error as the sample size is\nreduced. Since weighting tends to reduce bias and\nincrease variance, one would expect it to be more\nuseful for estimates based on the entire sample than for\nestimates based on a subdomain. The impact of\nweighting on subdomain estimates was examined by\nrepeating the analysis of table 1 for subjects aged\n15-24 years, a restriction that reduced the sample size\nBelow, we discuss the results presented in tables 1 and\n2 with reference to our original research questions.\nHow much bias is incurred from ignoring the\nweights? Weighting has a modest effect on the esti-\nmated prevalences, from a substantive viewpoint. Un-\nweighted estimates are generally within 10 percent of\nthe final weighted estimates, and differences are minor\ncompared with other potential effects relating to how\na disorder is measured. For example, estimates of\ndepression can vary greatly depending on how the\ncondition is operationalized (24). Nevertheless,\nweighting adjustments for some disorders--for exam-\nple, depression and dysthymia--are quite large when\ncompared with the standard errors of the estimates, so\nweighting may still be useful for reducing bias and\nmean squared error. The differences in weighted and\nunweighted estimates are significantly different from\nzero for depression and dysthymia (P = 0.005 and\nHow much added variance is incurred from weight-\ning? Weighting without poststratification or trim-\nming results in marked increases in estimated standard\nerrors for all disorders except drug use, simple phobia,\nagoraphobia, and dysthymia. The most extreme case is\nthe estimate for hypomania, which has an estimated\nstandard error 9.9 times that of the unweighted esti-\nmate. We initially thought that these large increases\nmight be attributable to instability in the jackknife\nrepeated replications method for estimating variance,\nbut standard errors based on jackknifing of individual\ncases yielded similar results. The high estimated vari-\nances are caused by a few cases with these disorders\nreceiving abnormally high weights.\nfl\nd do oo\noggg\nT - V- T - T -\no\n_\no\no\no o\nas\no o\n* \u00b7 p*.\no o\nOJ h.\no o\ncoi?\nd d\no o\nin w\no o\no o\no o \u00b7- o\no o o o\nddoo\ni- o co cn m co*- OJ CM CJ\nr- O) U) O) O CO i\n-\nCDin \u00ab ^ ' r\n-\n\" r^ r^ i\n-\n' ^ T\n-\n' O\ncqeocnr^ e\nq ^ ^ \"* w ^ T\ntr)(Oin'u> d \u00bb-\u00bb- T - T - \u00bb - T -\ninincMt\n<qu>c\\i<\n\u00b7\nWeighting for the National Comorbidity Survey 445\nHow well is the added variance from weighting\npredicted using equation 1? For the entire sample,\nthe predicted standard error of the final weighted es-\ntimate from equation 1 is close to the observed stan-\ndard error for four disorders, but it overestimates the\nobserved standard error for the other disorders. This\noverestimation is approximately halved when post-\nstratification is not used. Results for the subclass are\nmore variable, but equation 1 still has a tendency to\noverpredict the standard error. Without trimming, the\nlarge estimated standard errors for some disorders\n(caused by outlying weights) are not reflected in the\npredicted standard errors from equation 1, resulting in\na tendency for the formula to underpredict the standard\nerror.\nHow successful are methods for trimming the\nweights in limiting the increase in variance while at the\nsame time adjusting for bias? For the entire sample,\npoststratification without trimming tends to reduce the\nvariance of the raw weighted estimator. Nevertheless,\nin terms of estimated root mean squared error, this\nestimator still appears to be worse than the unweighted\nestimator for nine disorders; it is about the same for\nthree disorders and appears to be better for only two\ndisorders. In the age 15-24 subgroup, poststratifica-\ntion without trimming reduces estimated root mean\nsquared error for four of the 14 disorders and increases\nthe estimated root mean squared error for 10. Thus,\npoststratification does not appear to be very useful for\nthese estimates.\nThe final weighted estimator after poststratification\nand trimming has smaller estimated standard errors\nthan the other weighted estimators, suggesting that\ntrimming has been effective. For the entire sample,\nthis estimator appears to be best in terms of estimated\nroot mean squared error, with an average estimated\nroot mean squared error over all disorders of 0.44\ncompared with 0.51 for the unweighted estimator.\nHowever, gains over the unweighted estimator are not\nuniform across disorders.\nThe data in table 2 support the idea that weighting is\nless useful for estimates in subdomains; root mean\nsquared errors after poststratification and trimming are\nsimilar to those from the unweighted estimates. One\npossible reaction would be to restrict the role of\nweighting to estimates made for the entire sample,\nalthough this could introduce undesirable inconsisten-\ncies between estimates for the whole sample and for\nsubdomains.\nIndividual weight components\nTables 3-6 focus respectively on the household,\nhold-back, new construction, and nonresponse weight-\ning adjustments.

Changes\nfrom scheme 1 to scheme 2 and from scheme 3 to\nscheme 4 show the effects of the component weight,\nwithout and with the other weights included; scheme 5\nallows comparisons with the final estimators.\nOf the four component weights, the nonresponse\nweight has the largest impact on estimated preva-\nlences, raising them by nearly 1 percentage point, on\naverage. The impact of weighting for nonresponse is\nquite significant for some of the rare disorders that\nmight be associated with higher rates of nonre-\nsponse--antisocial behavior, anxiety disorder, panic\ndisorder, antisocial personality--and the estimated\nprevalence of hypomania is doubled from 0.9 percent\nto 1.9 percent. However, the estimated variances of\nestimates weighted for nonresponse are much higher\nthan the estimated variances of the unweighted or\ntrimmed estimates. In addition, the effects of the non-\nresponse weights on final estimated prevalences are\nreduced considerably by trimming.\nThe within-household weight places more weight\non sampled individuals in large households. The effect\nof the weight is to reduce the estimated prevalences\nof alcoholism, depression, and drug use by approx-\nimately 1 percent. Effects on other disorders are\nmore minor. There is some evidence that the within-\nhousehold weight operates in the opposite direction\nfrom the nonresponse weight, so the two weighting\nadjustments tend to cancel each other out. For exam-\nple, adding the household weight to the unweighted\nestimates increases the variance of the prevalences by\napproximately 10 percent, on average. However, add-\ning the within-household weight after all of the other\nweights are included has the effect of reducing the\nvariances by approximately 40 percent, on average,\nreflecting a reduction in the weight variability from\ninclusion of this component.\nThe other two weighting components, the new con-\nstruction weight and the hold-back weight, have much\nmore minor effects on the estimates and their standard\nerrors, presumably because these weights apply only\nto small proportions of the sample.\nDISCUSSION\nThe effects of weighting on the point estimates were\nmodest from a substantive point of view; the un-\nweighted estimates were far from disastrous. How-\never, it would be dangerous to conclude from this\nsingle application that weights can always be ignored\nin surveys of mental disorders. Bias has a more insid-\nious effect on inferences than does variance, since it is\noften left unmeasured, and in general we prefer an\napproach that corrects for bias provided that the im-\npact on variance is not too great. From this perspec-\ntive, our general conclusion is that the overall weight-\ning strategy, with poststratification and trimming, was\nquite successful, resulting in reduced root mean\nsquared error for the estimates made for the entire\nsample and root mean squared errors comparable with\nthose for the unweighted estimates in the age 15-24\nsubdomain. In the latter case, the superior theoretical\nproperties of the weighted estimates seem to justify\nweighting, even though useful reductions in root mean\nsquared error were not found empirically.\nAn important limitation of this study is that it re-\nports results for a single survey, albeit an important\none. Other surveys may have different sample sizes,\nweighting characteristics, and weight trimming strate-\ngies, so it is hard to generalize the findings of the\npresent study. However, some tentative comments can\nbe made. The raw weights without adjustment added\nmuch too much variance in the effort to limit bias.\nThis finding suggests that the increased variance from\nweighting should be carefully monitored. This is eas-\nily achieved by directly computing the variances with\nand without the weights, using a method such as\njackknife repeated replications that takes into account\nother features of the sample design, and checking that\nthe increase in variance is not excessive. The alterna-\ntive approach of using equation 1 to predict the in-\ncrease in variance does not appear reliable, based on\nour empirical evidence.\nMethods for reducing added variance from weight-\ning were clearly needed, and the trimming adjustments\nwere effective. However, from a theoretical perspec-\ntive, trimming is ad hoc, and alternative approaches to\nvariance reduction may yield improved estimates.\nThese alternatives include weight smoothing based on\nrandom-effects models (6, 19) or estimation based on\npredictions from a model that includes the weight as a\ncovariate (25, 26). Our future work will focus on these\nalternative variance reduction methods.\nAnother limitation of this study is that it examined\nestimated rates for the entire sample and for one sub-\ndomain. Thus, we did not consider measures of asso-\nciation, such as differences in mean values or regres-\nsion coefficients. Theory suggests that weighting may\nbe less important for bias reduction in such analyses,\nsince biases in comparisons tend to cancel out. Given\nthe modest support for weighting our study provides\nfor estimated rates, we would not expect weighting of\nanalyses of associations to have much payoff in the\nsetting of the NCS, although that is an empirical\nquestion worthy of further exploration.\nIn this study, the most important components of the\nweighting adjustments were the nonrespondent and\nwithin-household weights. The new construction and\nhold-back weights had a limited impact on root mean\nsquared error, presumably because they affected a\nrelatively small fraction of the sample. Since weights\nfor new construction generally affect only a small\nfraction of the sample, we expect our findings on that\nweight to generalize to other studies. The impact of the\nhold-back weight would be greater if the strategy of\nsubsampling hard-to-reach cases were applied to the\nentire sample, rather than to a subset, as was the case\nin the NCS. More widespread subsampling of hard-to-\nreach persons has the potential of substantially reduc-\ning survey costs, and we are currently studying the\nrelative efficiency of variants of such a design in the\ncontext of the NCS.\n"
