From a theoretical point of view, FDI decisions have been\nanalyzed based on the eclectic paradigm (Dunning 1977), which distinguishes ownership,\nlocation, and internalization advantages of foreign investments.1 The new trade theory, which\nessentially focuses on the ownership and location advantages, provides a more formal\nframework for analyzing FDI decisions. Part of this literature uses game theoretical\napproaches to explain the presence of multinationals by the existence of economies of scale\nand oligopolistic market structures (Horstmann and Markusen 1992, Brainard 1993, Raff and\nSrinivasan 1998, Raff and Kim 1999). Activities of multinationals have also been modeled\nendogenously in general equilibrium models in which the activities of multinationals are\ndriven by country size, relative endowments, firm- and plant-level costs, and trade costs\nmodels are based on the decision of companies, which are all symmetric. This symmetry\nassumption allows analyzing a representative firm in each country in order to derive\nimplications for aggregate FDI.\nOne way to test these models empirically has been to derive gravity models, which have\nproven very useful in explaining patterns of international investments (see, e.g. Carr et al.\naggregated data even though theoretical work has focused on explanations of international\ninvestments that use microeconomic approaches and that stress aspects of industrial\norganization. However, analyzing foreign direct investment decisions on the basis of\naggregated data does not allow a number of interesting aspects to be studied. It is not possible,\n* This paper has partly been written while the authors visited the Research Centre of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nThe hospitality of the Bundesbank and access to the micro-database \"International Capital Links\" are\ngratefully acknowledged. This project has benefited from financial support by the Thyssen Foundation. The\nauthors would like to thank Heinz Herrmann, Joerg Doepke, Alexander Lipponer, Fred Ramb, Horst Raff,\nHarald Stahl as well as participants of seminars given at the Deutsche Bundesbank and at the University of\nKiel for their support and for most helpful discussions. Roland Bodenstein, Marco Oestmann, and Anne\nRichter have provided efficient research assistance. All errors and inaccuracies are solely in our own\nresponsibility.\n1 For a survey of the literature see Markusen (1995).\nfor instance, to distinguish between firm-level and country-specific determinants of FDI, or to\nanalyze the behavior of small versus large foreign affiliates.\nIn this sense, there has been a widening gap between the empirical and the theoretical\nliterature on the internationalization of firms. There are only few studies on FDI that use firm-\nlevel data (Andersson and Fredrikson 2000, Head and Ries 2001). For reasons of data\navailability, these papers mostly use Swedish or Japanese data. Firm-level data on the foreign\ndirect investment activities of firms recently made available by the Deutsche Bundesbank can\nthus contribute to closing the gap in the literature. (See Lipponer (2002a) for a detailed\ndescription of the database.)\nThis paper uses this database and provides regression-based descriptive statistics. We proceed\nin three main steps. The following second part describes the database and our set of\nexplanatory variables. Part three gives our own empirical results from panel and cross-section\nregressions. The empirical model underlying our estimations is a gravity-type equation. Inter\nalia, our results allow drawing inference with regard to sectoral differences in the importance\nof distance and to differences in the determinants of foreign investment for the size of foreign\naffiliates and the number of firms investing in a given host country. One main finding is that\nsome determinants of FDI have a different impact on aggregated FDI than on the size of the\nforeign affiliate. Small foreign affiliates, for instance, are located in geographically close and\nbordering regions while the reverse holds true for larger foreign affiliates. The number of\nforeign affiliates being established in nearby regions is larger than that of distant regions,\nwhich explains the negative link between distance and aggregated FDI. Part four summarizes\nthe results and maps the future research agenda.\n2 The Data\nIn this section, we describe both the FDI database that we use in this paper as well as the set\nof explanatory variables, and we provide stylized facts on the regional and sectoral structure\nof German outward FDI.\n2.1 Foreign Direct Investment\nThe dependent variables used in the regression analysis of Section 3 are drawn from the\nmicro-database International Capital Links of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The database\nprovides a detailed breakdown of the foreign assets and liabilities of German firms. For the\npurpose of the present paper, we focus on direct and indirect foreign direct investment (pbum1\n= Mittelbare und unmittelbare \u00fcber Holding gehaltene Direktinvestitionen) of German firms'\nabroad. This variable gives the sum of equity capital of the foreign affiliate, capital reserves,\nand retained earnings which is hold by a German company. The data are end-of-period stocks.\nWe use this variable at two different levels of aggregation and as count variable:\n- First, we aggregate the data at the country and at the sectoral level. We run regressions\nboth pooled across sectors as well as for each sector separately.\n- Second, we explicitly use the firm-level evidence that the database provides. The firm-\nlevel evidence allows studying the size of an individual affiliate in a given host country,\nrather than FDI of a given sector in a given country.\n- Finally, we use the number of foreign affiliates in a country, i.e. a count variable, as the\ndependent variable. This allows distinguishing to what extent effects found in\naggregated data are driven by the size of affiliates and to what extent by the number of\naffiliates abroad.\nAggregating our dependent variable at different levels is not problematic even in cases where\nseveral companies report on the same foreign investment object. This is because our\nendogenous variable gives the investment of a specific German company in a foreign affiliate.\nIn most of the cases, one German company holds the entire (\"German\") equity capital of an\naffiliate, but about 5% of the foreign affiliates in the database are held by more than one\nGerman company. However, since, in some affiliates, a foreign (non-German) investor might\nhold an equity share, it is difficult to interpret pbum as the equity capital of an affiliate.\nRather, it should be interpreted as the investment of a German company. This might be a\ndisadvantage if the object under study is the affiliate. However, it has the advantage that there\nis no double counting when the data are aggregated.\nGenerally, the dataset allows analyzing different measures of foreign activities of German\ncompanies. FDI is often used as proxy for the internationalization of production because of its\nrelative broad availability. Data on foreign affiliates' sales or employment are usually more\ndifficult to obtain. The Bundesbank database enables us to use different measures of firms'\nforeign activities.\nThe database furthermore allows aggregating the data by sector of the reporting firm and by\nthe host country of its foreign affiliate. Generally, sectors and countries are defined as in\nLipponer (2002b). There are two exceptions. First, banks are defined as an additional sector\nand are not combined with other financial institutions. Second, some smaller financial centers\nsuch as Gibraltar have not been included in the data for the U.K. but have rather been entered\nas individual countries. Overall, the dataset includes 238 host countries and 38 sectors.\nHowever, due to missing explanatory variables or small sector sizes, we do not use the full\ncross-sectional dimension of the dataset.\nTable 1 gives some aggregated descriptive statistics for our dependent variable for the most\nrecent year (2000). The data are sliced both according to the geographical distribution of\nGerman firms' FDI (Panel a) and the sectoral structure (Panel b). The Table shows, first of all,\nthe dominance of German firms' FDI held in other industrialized countries, which account for\na share of 79-90% of all foreign direct investments. This distribution is also relatively\nconsistent across sectors.\nPerhaps somewhat surprisingly, the share of the EU countries in all industrialized countries is\nonly about one half, and it is sometimes even smaller than the share of the United States. The\nimportance of the U.S. relative to intra-European FDI is particularly striking for the\nautomobiles sector (72 versus 14%) and the financial services sector (51 versus 36%). For\nmost other sectors, the U.S. is of smaller importance as a destination of FDI than Europe.2\nPanel b of Table 1 shows the importance of each sector by region. For most regions covered,\nmanufacturing accounts for around 40% of total FDI. The exception is China, where the\nmanufacturing sector has a share of 74% of the total, which clearly exceeds the average for\nother emerging markets. Within the manufacturing sector, automobiles are the most important\nsector, accounting for almost one half of the total. Interestingly, this sector has a below-\naverage share of less than 6% of its FDI in EU countries. Table 1 also reveals a short-coming\nof the sectoral classification of our data: About one third of German firms' FDI is classified as\nholding companies. Hence, these investments cannot be allocated to any specific sector with\nregard to the investing company.\n2.2 Explanatory Variables\nWith regard to explanatory variables, our analysis is restricted mainly to macroeconomic\ndeterminants of FDI. (For similar approaches see Wheeler and Mody (1992), Barrell and Pain\n(1996), or Lipsey (1999).) While the reporting requirements of the Bundesbank are quite\nencompassing with regard to the specifics of the foreign affiliate, little information is provided\non the reporting firm itself. Essentially, the information on the reporting firm is restricted to\nthe sector in which it is active. Moreover, most of the information that we have on the foreign\naffiliates is highly correlated with our dependent variable.\n2 FDI of private households is an exception. However, this sector accounts for only 1% of German FDI.\nGenerally, FDI can be expected to respond to variables such as market size and market\ndevelopment, geographical, cultural and economic distance between countries, the degree of\nmacroeconomic stability, and the degree of regulations of countries. We capture these factors\nas follows:\n(i) Market size and development:\n- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) controls for market size, and it is measured in current\nUSD. GDP data have been obtained from the 2002 CD-rom Global Development\nIndicators of the World Bank. We expect this variable to influence positively German\nFDI outward stocks.\n- Income dummies are included to control for the state of development of the host country.\nLow-income countries are defined as those with a per-capita GDP below 760 USD,\nlower-middle income countries as those with a per-capita GDP between 761 and 3000\nthose with a per-capita GDP above 9300 USD. Since these groups do not overlap, we\nexclude the low income dummy in the regression. All coefficients must therefore be\ninterpreted as effect relative to the benchmark of the group of countries with a per-capita\n- Bilateral trade is included as an alternative measure for the size of the foreign market.\nOne problem with including trade as a regressor in a gravity equation explaining FDI is\nthe potential multicollinearity between trade and the remaining explanatory variables.\nHence, we use the residual of a regression of trade on a border dummy, log distance, an\nEU dummy, log GDP, and log risk instead.3 The expected coefficient is positive\n(negative) if FDI and trade are complements (substitutes). Both effects are conceivable\nfrom a theoretical point of view. Brainard (1993) and Markusen and Venables (1998)\nargue that trade and FDI are substitutes. Conditions under which trade and FDI are\ncomplements are discussed in Helpman (1984) and Kleinert (2003). The bilateral trade\ndata have been obtained from the Deutsche Bundesbank in D-mark or euro (after 1999)\nand have been converted into USD.\n3 We also instrumented trade through lagged foreign trade to account for its potential endogeneity. Results\nwere qualitatively unchanged.\n(ii) Geographic, cultural, and economic distance:\n- Greater distance as measured by geographical distance in km is expected to lead to\nlower stocks of FDI abroad. Larger distance could be an impediment to FDI because it\nleads to higher communication and information costs and restricts face-to-face\ncommunication and networking. Moreover, a greater distance also reflects differences in\nculture, language, and institutions, which is also likely to decrease FDI.4\n- Tariffs are average tariff rates taken from the World Bank.5 High tariffs increase the\ncosts of bilateral trade and may thus make FDI as a mode of entry into a foreign market\nrelatively more attractive if exports and production abroad are substitutes. Hence, we\nwould expect a positive relationship between tariffs and FDI if trade and FDI are\nsubstitutes. If, in contrast, trade and FDI are complements, the expected impact of tariffs\non FDI would be negative.\n- The presence of a common border is included as one proxy for distance costs. The\nexpected coefficient of this 0/1-dummy is positive since foreign activities are generally\nhigher in neighboring countries to which economic, political, cultural and personal\nrelations are much more intense.\n- A 0/1-dummy for countries in which German is an official language is likewise\nexpected to have a positive impact on FDI since speaking a common language eases\ncommunication and also captures cultural similarity in a broader sense.\n- We also include a 0/1-dummy variable EU which is set equal to one for countries that\nare members of the European Union. The expected sign is positive, since the creation of\na Single Market should have promoted cross-border entry.\n(iii) Stability and regulations:\n- Risk as a composite index of country risk, is the political risk index taken from various\nissues of Euromoney. It is defined as the risk of non-payment or non-servicing payments\n4 The data have been taken from http://www.wcrl.ars.usda.gov/cec/java/capitals.htm. Distances are calculated\nwith the following formula where lat i and long iare respectively latitude and longitude of Berlin and lat j and\nlong j those of the main economic center of country j (usually its capital).\n-\nlong i\n) , ABS ( long j\n- long i\n5 These data can be obtained from: http://www1.worldbank.org/wbiep/trade/data/TR_Data.html\nfor goods or services, loans, trade-related finance and dividends and the non-repatriation\nof capital. This variable takes values from 10 (no risk of non-payment) to 0 (no\nrepayment expected). This risk index has a higher score when country risk is small.\nSince lower risk should encourage FDI, the expected coefficient is positive.\n- Freedom is an index running from 1 through 7, whereby a value of 1 indicates the\nhighest degree of political freedom and liberty. The data have been obtained from\nFreedom House (www.freedomhouse.org). As companies are expected to be drawn to\ncountries with a more liberal environment, we expect to find a negative link between\nfreedom and FDI.\n- Two variables are included to capture the severity of regulations on cross-border capital\nflows. Capital control is a 0/1-dummy, which is set equal to one if countries impose\ncontrols on cross-border financial credits. In addition, we control for the presence of\nregimes of multiple exchange rates. Both dummy variables are expected to enter with a\nnegative sign. The data are based on the IMF's Annual Survey of Exchange Rate\nRestrictions. Data prior to 1996 have kindly been provided by Gian-Maria Milesi-\nFerretti, data after 1996 have been obtained from the IMF publications.\n3 Empirical Results\nWe use different empirical models to analyze the determinants of German firms' foreign\ndirect investment abroad. In a first step, we estimate quasi-panel regressions using data which\nhave been sectorally aggregated across all firms being active in a given host country in a given\nyear. In a second step, we study the sectoral dimension of the data estimating these quasi-\npanels separately for each sector. Hence, we are able to analyze whether determinants of FDI\ndiffer across sectors. Finally, we use micro-data. In addition, we use the number of German\nfirms that are active in a given country as the dependent variable in order to explain possible\ndifferences in the determinants of aggregated FDI, on the one hand, and the size of foreign\naffiliates, on the other hand.\n3.1 What Determines German FDI?\nThis section presents new evidence from gravity equations for the stocks of foreign direct\ninvestments of German firms. Using data that have been aggregated across individual firms\nfor each year, host country, and sector, we estimate a quasi-panel of the following form:\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\nijt\njt\nj\njt\nijt\nvariables\ncontrol\ndist\nGDP\n\n\n\n +\n+\n+\n+\n=\nlog\nlog\nwhere subscripts i, j and t denote the sector, the host country, and the year respectively. Time\nfixed effects are included to capture possible trends. We also include a set of sectoral fixed\neffects. The dependent variable (FDI) as well as GDP, GDP per capita, distance and risk are\nentered in logs6. Hence, the resulting coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities. Before\nestimating a full-fledged panel model, we use a quasi-panel, because in standard fixed effects\nmodels, the impact of time invariant variables such as distance cannot be measured.\nIn addition to quasi-panel OLS results, we also present a fixed effects panel estimation which\naccounts for the clustered structure of the data. The cluster option implemented in STATA\nallows controlling for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of the residuals while exploiting\nthe panel dimension of our data. It computes a robust variance estimator based on a specific\ncluster structure and a calculated covariance matrix. The routine produces an estimator for\nclustered data (data are assumed not to be independent within groups, but independent across\ngroups). The resulting coefficients of the regression are unbiased.\nTable 2 presents results for the entire dataset, using eight different OLS specifications. We\nvary the set of explanatory variables that we include. In all specifications with the exception\nof specification 2, we include sectoral dummies. In the second and third column, we report\nregressions that include country-specific sectoral dummy variables. In the fourth and in the\nfixed effects specification (column 9), we include dummies for low-to-middle, middle-\nincome, and high-income countries. Cut-off values for the income levels have been taken\nfrom the World Bank's Global Development Indicators database. In columns 5 and 7, the\ntrade residual is included to control for the size of the foreign market. We use the residual of a\nregression of trade on the other exogenous variables to avoid the problem of multicollinearity.\nColumns 6 and 7 include a tariff variable as additional variable measuring economic distance\nof the foreign market for German companies. Due to missing observations for the tariff\nvariable, however, our sample size drops to two-thirds for this specification. Column 8 gives\nthe results of a regression in which we control for labor productivity.7 The last specification\nshows the results of a fixed effects regression which takes the panel dimension of our dataset\ninto account.\n6 We believe that the effect of distance on FDI is better modeled by constant eleasticities given by the\nlogarithmic form than by a constant change of FDI in Euro per km as implied by a linear regression in levels.\nThe logarithmic form implies a decreasing effect of an additional km on FDI measured in Euro. That might\nstem from fixed costs. Moreover, the logarithmic form fits the data better.\n7 We compute labor productivity as annual turn-over (pk04), converted into real USD, over the number of\nemployees (pk05) in the given sector.\nThere are a couple of results which are fairly robust across different specifications. GDP is\npositive and significant with an elasticity of around 0.7. As usual in gravity equations, GDP as\nproxy for the size of the foreign market has a significant positive effect on German FDI.\nThe proxies for risk, regulations, economic and cultural distance mostly have the expected\nsigns and are also significant: a common border and a common language increase FDI, low\ncountry risk and a high degree of freedom increase FDI (note that the two variables are\ndefined in an opposite way), and capital controls discourage FDI. The EU dummy, for\ninstance, is positive and significant. It is only for one variable that we find insignificant\ncoefficients or unexpected signs: Regimes of multiple exchange rates seem to encourage\nrather than deter foreign direct investment. One explanation would be that FDI is used as a\nmeans to overcome barriers that multiple exchange rate regimes create.\nTrade has, on average, a positive effect of German FDI in foreign countries. The coefficient is\nlarge and significant. A 10% increase in bilateral trade increases the FDI stock of German\ncompanies by about 7.5%. The specifications suggests a positive (i.e. complementary)\nrelationship between (aggregated) trade and FDI. The result is also robust with regard to the\nuse of foreign sales (not reported) as the dependent variable. The complementary relationship\nis also supported by the negative coefficient we obtain for the impact of tariffs on FDI.\nGenerally, our RHS variables are able to explain a little over 50% percent of the variation of\nGerman foreign direct investment stocks across countries. The explanatory power drops\nconsiderably though if sectoral dummies are not included. In this case, the adjusted R\u00b2 does\nreach a value of only 0.33. This can be taken as a first indication that sectoral differences\nmatter. Results are relatively insensitive, in contrast, with regard to including dummies for\ncountries from different income groups.\nWith regard to the effect of distance on German FDI, we obtain a statistically and\neconomically significant coefficient of \u00ad0.2 to \u00ad0.35, depending on the specification chosen.\nThese estimates are somewhat at the lower bound of the findings of the earlier literature on\nforeign trade. (Frankel (1997) and Leamer and Levinsohn (1995) review the literature on\ngravity-type equations for foreign trade which finds a coefficient of around \u00ad0.6.) Our results\nindicate that FDI declines by about 25% if distance doubles. The negative effect of distance\non German FDI in foreign countries is completely picked up by the trade variable if trade is\nincluded (Column 7).\n3.2 Do Determinants of FDI Differ Across Sectors?\nThe results of Table 2 point to sectoral differences in the data since the sectoral dummies that\nwe have included are typically significant. Hence, one obvious question to ask is whether the\neffect of some of the exogenous variables of interest, notably of the distance coefficient,\ndiffers among sectors. In other words, we are interested in the question to what extent\naggregation over the different sectors might be influencing our results.\nEssentially, our sample contains information on almost 30 economic sectors, covering\nmanufacturing, services, and agriculture. However, for some of these sectors, sample sizes are\nrelatively small if, in addition, we are interested in the regional and the time pattern of their\ninternational expansion. Therefore, rather than estimating individual cross-section regressions\nat a sectoral level, this section looks at quasi-panel estimates for the entire time period.\nResults for the entire sample are reported in Table 3. We present results for the largest\n12 sectors. In addition to the results reported here, we have tested the robustness of these\nresults also by including interaction terms between distance and the time dummies and by\nincluding tariffs and a proxy for labor productivity. Generally, results were fairly insensitive to\nthese changes.\nThe sectoral results show, first of all, that there is quite some heterogeneity in the\ndeterminants of FDI at a sectoral level. Market size (GDP), for instance, has a relatively large\nimpact on the chemicals industry, the automobiles industry, machinery, and the information\ntechnology sector (elasticity of around 0.90 with respect to GDP). The high costs of setting up\na foreign affiliate in those sectors can explain this high elasticity. For other sectors such as\nfinancial services, construction, or textiles, the coefficient on GDP is only about half that size.\nSectors also seem to differ in their sensitivity to regulations and cultural proxies. It is difficult,\nhowever, to trace a clear pattern in the data since many coefficients become insignificant or\neven switch signs as we run different specifications of our baseline model. Interestingly, the\nEU dummy is often significant and also carries a positive sign, suggesting that the Single\nMarket Program has stimulated German FDI. The only exception is the construction sector,\nwhere the EU dummy has a negative impact.\nIt is interesting to note that the impact of distance differs quite significantly among sectors.\nGraph 1 plots the distance coefficients we obtain for 25 sectors for which we had a reasonable\nnumber of observations. The number of observations varies considerably across sectors, hence\nresults should be taken as being indicative of trends rather than being precise point estimates.\nA couple of results are interesting. On average, the marginal effect of distance for the whole\nsample is around \u00ad0.3. Distance has a negative impact on German FDI in most sectors. It has\nan above-average importance (in absolute terms) for the electricity sector, glass and ceramics,\nplastic products, retail trade, manufacturing of coke and refined petroleum products, and paper\nproducts. However, multinationals in the chemicals industry and hotels and restaurant are\nparticularly attracted to distant markets. Finally, there is a group of sectors for which distance\ndoes not seem to be important (e.g. construction, financial services, information technology,\nhousing, wood processing, agriculture).\n3.3 What Determines the Size of Foreign Affiliates?\nFinally, we explicitly use the microstructure of the database. Although we lack information on\nthe balance sheets and income statements of the reporting firms, this exercise can provide us\nwith additional information on the determinants of FDI. Results are reported in Table 4.\nTechnically, we estimate equation (2) but the dependent variable is not aggregated across\nsectors but rather captures each individual investment into a foreign affiliate.8 We indirectly\naccount for the size of the reporting company by including the number of its foreign affiliates\nworldwide as an explanatory variable. This variable size is always positive and significant\n(Table 4, panel b), which implies that companies that maintain more foreign affiliates also\nhave foreign affiliates which are of above-average size.\nTable 4 reports two sets of regressions. In a first specification (panel a), we regress the size of\nthe foreign affiliate on the set of regressors used above. In a second specification (panel b), we\nadditionally include the number of foreign affiliates of the reporting company to control for\nfirm size, and we include aggregated trade between Germany and the recipient country. In all\nregressions, we include sectoral dummies as well as dummies for the income level of the\nrecipient country. In addition, we have run a number of robustness checks (results not\nreported), on which we will comment below. We run the two different specifications\nchanges in the determinants of FDI over time. The main reason why we do not estimate a full-\nfledged panel model is that the codes of the companies have been changed in 1996. Hence, we\ncannot trace a particular reporting company through the 10 years under study. The number of\nforeign affiliates on which we have information has doubled during the observation period\n8 We equate the size of the foreign affiliate with the share in equity capital hold by one German company. The\ninterpretation of our results might be biased if German companies hold smaller shares of total equity in those\nforeign affiliates which are located in nearby markets.\nRunning the same regressions for the micro-data as those presented in Section 3.2 for the\nsectorally aggregated data gives a much poorer statistical fit. In terms of explanatory power,\nour regressions explain at most 16% of the cross-country variation in the size of firms' foreign\ndirect investment. The main reason is that we have generally not included any firm-specific\nexplanatory variables. The adjusted R\u00b2 even increases to over 30% if we additionally include\ninteraction terms between the explanatory variables and a dummy for the size of the German\nmultinational company (results not reported). For this purpose, small multinational companies\nhave been defined as companies which total number of affiliates is smaller than three.\nWhen comparing the results for the regressions using micro-data to those using aggregated\ndata (i.e. comparing Tables 2 and 4), there is only one variable for which we obtain a result\nwhich is robust across specifications: GDP has a positive and significant impact on FDI across\nthe different specifications that we use.\nFor some variables, we do obtain results that are similar across specifications although the\npicture is more mixed. For these variables, we also obtained quite a few insignificant\ncoefficient estimates. Risk and freedom, for instance, tend to have a positive and negative\nimpact on the size of foreign affiliates, respectively. Also, the dummies for current and capital\naccount restrictions have relatively consistent signs, i.e. the presence of capital controls\nlowers FDI while the presence of multiple exchange rates increases FDI. While, if significant,\nthe common language dummy is positive, it is significant in only a few of the specifications.\nThe EU dummy tends to be negative in contrast, suggesting that relatively small affiliates are\nset up in these countries.\nThe variable for which we obtain the largest differences between the quasi-panel regressions\n(Table 2) and the regressions using the micro-data (Table 4, Panel a) is the distance variable.\nWhile we obtain a statistically significant negative link between distance and FDI for the\naggregated data, the effect of distance is often positive for the micro-data. Our second proxy\nfor proximity, the common border dummy, also has a different effect. In contrast to the\naggregated equations (Table 2), where we generally obtain a positive effect, we often obtain a\nnegative sign in the micro-data regressions (Table 4).\nThe positive effect of distance even survives in some cases if we additionally control for the\nlevel of total foreign trade between Germany and the recipient country (Table 4, Panel b). At\nthe same time, the effect of trade is negative and not, as for the aggregated data, positive. This\nresult could partly be seen as a mirror-image of the different results obtained for distance.\nSince gravity models for trade overwhelmingly find that aggregated trade and distance are\nnegative correlated, a negative link between a given variable and trade should be associated\nwith a positive link between this variable and distance. The negative border effect remains\neven if we control for the level of foreign trade. The interpretation of this result is that it is the\nsmaller foreign affiliates which are set up in neighboring countries, as has also been suggested\nby the negative EU dummy.\nSince, for most other variables, we obtain results that are relatively consistent in sign when\ncomparing regressions for aggregated and disaggregated data, the differential effect of trade\nand \"proximity\" obviously warrants an explanation. Two explanations, which are not\nmutually exclusive, are conceivable:\nThe first explanation for the negative link between trade and the size of foreign affiliates is\nthat, in countries with which Germany conducts a lot of foreign trade, the average size of the\nforeign affiliate is smaller. One interpretation would be that these affiliates are set up to\nfacilitate trade and not as foreign production units. Even if they are production units, the share\nof imported inputs might be higher than in affiliates which are far away from Germany. Thus,\nthe value added in these affiliates might be low, which requires less capital. To explore this\nrelationship is beyond the scope of this paper but an interesting task for further research.\nThe second explanation for the positive link between distance and the size of foreign affiliates\nis that firms set up smaller foreign affiliates on average in nearby countries, because it is\nprofitable to do so even for smaller units. Set-up costs of establishments in remote countries,\nin contrast might be too high for small affiliates. If this explanation was correct, then the\nnegative effect of distance on FDI found in aggregated data must be due to a decline in the\nnumber of affiliates as distance increases which overcompensates the size effect of the\naverage single affiliate.\nWe test whether this explanation is confirmed by the data by running regressions, using the\nnumber of German firms' foreign affiliates as the dependent variable. Results are reported in\nTables 5a and 5b. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that proximity (measured\nthrough the presence of a common border or through distance) has a different effect on the\nsize of the foreign affiliate than on the number of firms abroad. As for the aggregated data, the\nnumber of firms is relative negatively (positively) to distance (common border). The mirror-\nimage of this finding is that the effect of trade differs. Hence, nearby countries, with which\nGermany conducts a lot of trade, attract many small foreign affiliates whereby remote\ncountries, with which Germany conducts little foreign trade, attract few large foreign\naffiliates. Since the impact of proximity and trade on the number of foreign affiliates\ndominates, we obtain the aggregated effect of a negative (positive) link between total FDI and\ndistance (trade).\nGraph 2 shows descriptive statistics which confirm that affiliates located in bordering and\nnearby countries are smaller on average than affiliates located in more remote countries.\nGraph 2 shows the means of employment, sales, and FDI of affiliates in bordering countries\nover time. Overall, affiliates in bordering countries are smaller in terms of employment, sales,\nand the sum of equity capital invested than affiliates in more remote regions. These\ndifferences have remained relatively stable over time. While all affiliates have grown in the\npast ten years on average, the gap between the size of affiliates in the two regions considered\nhas remained almost unchanged.\nThe regression analysis reported above has also shown that smaller foreign affiliates are set up\nin countries with which Germany conducts a lot of foreign trade. This results can be\ninterpreted as smaller affiliates being used for distribution rather than production. Since our\ndataset provides us with information on the sector of the foreign affiliate, we can check\nwhether this hypothesis is confirmed by the data. Table 6 shows differences in the importance\nof wholesale trade for firms of different size in terms of employment and in different regions.\nThe most important individual sector of the foreign affiliates is wholesale trade, which\naccounts for more than one third of all foreign establishments of German firms.\nWith regard to the importance of wholesale trade activity, the size of employment in the\nforeign affiliates matters most. Whereas wholesale trade is the main line of business for 36%\nof the firms in the sample, it accounts for 43% of the activities of affiliates with less than 50\nemployees and only 18% for those with more than 50 employees. This difference also remains\nif we break up the sample into bordering and nearby countries, on the one hand, and more\ndistant countries, on the other hand. Hence, less employees are needed ceteris paribus in\naffiliates being engaged in distribution as opposed to production abroad. Breaking up the\nsample into reporting companies that have only 1 or 2 foreign affiliates and those that have\nmore than 2 foreign affiliates shows that wholesale trade and thus distribution is somewhat\nmore important for those having more affiliates abroad. Looking at differences between\nnearby and remote countries also shows that wholesale trade is somewhat more important in\nthe nearby regions.\n4 Avenues for Future Research\nThis paper has provided a first assessment of the determinants of German firms' foreign direct\ninvestment activities, using a comprehensive firm-level dataset. We have looked at the data at\ndifferent levels of aggregation. In a first step, we have aggregated the data by country and\nsector. In a second step, we have focused the analysis on the sectoral differences in the\ndeterminants of FDI. In a final step, we have used the size of foreign affiliates and thus firm-\nlevel data as the dependent variable.\nInterestingly, there are only two results which are fairly robust against changes in the\nspecification. As shown by the positive impact of GDP and the negative impact of risk on\nFDI, German firms are drawn to large and safe markets. Other traditional determinants of FDI\nhave more heterogenous effects, and their impact differs according to the sector and the size\nof the foreign affiliate under study.\nOne interesting result of this study has been that regional and cultural proximity have a\ndifferential effect on the size of the foreign affiliate and the number of firms being present in a\ngiven host country. More specifically, many small affiliates tend to be set up in nearby\nmarkets whereas few but, on average, larger affiliates tend to be set up in distant markets. This\nis shown by the negative (positive) link that we find between the border dummy (distance) and\nthe size of the foreign affiliate. Opposite effects of these variables are found for the total\nnumber of affiliates. For aggregate FDI, the effect of proximity on the number of firms\ndominates. Hence, we find that there is more FDI in geographically close countries with\nwhich Germany shares a common border.\nDifferent effects of distance on the number and the size of foreign affiliates are a mirror-image\nof the differential effect of aggregated bilateral trade on these two measures of German firms'\nFDI. Whereas there is a positive link between aggregated FDI (and the number of German\naffiliates in a given market) and trade, the link is negative for the size of the affiliate. One\ninterpretation of this result is that affiliates which are production units and therefore substitute\ntrade are larger in size. An affiliate set up for distribution can be smaller (with regard to the\nequity investment it requires) than a production unit.\nThis interpretation of the link between trade and FDI also shows one potentially interesting\ndirection for future research. It would be of interest to test in more detail to what extent\nforeign affiliates are set up to facilitate trade or production abroad. The sector classifications\nof the foreign affiliate and the parent company might help to distinguish sales units from\nproduction units. Another way of discriminating between the two purposes might be to\ncompare equity-sales-ratios or employment-sales-ratios for the affiliates. In general, sales\nunits show lower ratios than production units.\nA second extension of this work would be to try and explain the differences in the\ndeterminants of FDI for different sectors. Controlling for sector-specific factors such as the\ndegree of competition, the intensity of regulations, or the relative importance of fixed versus\nvariable costs of entry would be one step into this direction.\nFinally, it would be of interest to shed more light on the question to what extent FDI and other\nmodes of integration are linked. Results of this study suggest that aggregated FDI and trade\nare complements. In addition, it would be of interest to analyze links between FDI and other\nfactors flows. For instance, business services, as an important intermediary input in affiliates'\nproduction might be interesting to analyze. A study on the relationship of business services\nand FDI can shed light on the choice between licensing and FDI, because intra-firm\ninformation flows are one likely candidate for the internalization decision of MNEs.\nOur results also hold some interesting implications for future theoretical work on the\ndeterminants of FDI. Typically, theoretical models assume the existence of firms that do not\ndiffer in size. This helps to derive implications on aggregate FDI on the basis of the analysis\nof a representative firm. This approach has the disadvantage, however, that differences in the\nsize of affiliates cannot be analyzed. The number of affiliates, in turn, is endogenous in these\nmodels and depends only on the size of the country. However, our results show that these\nassumptions may not reflect reality sufficiently. Rather, proximity seems to have an impact\nboth on the size of the affiliate and on the number of affiliates being set up abroad. Proximity\nmay have differential effects on aggregate FDI. Moreover, modeling differences in the foreign\ninvestment behavior of different sectors seems promising (see, e.g., Helpman et al. (2003) for\na recent contribution). All this is left to future research.\nReferences\nAndersson, T., and T. Fredriksson (2000). Distinction Between Intermediate and Finished\nProducts in Intra-Firm Trade.
