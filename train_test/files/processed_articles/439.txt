We aim to investigate whether centenarians are significantly more resilient than younger elders and whether resilience\nsignificantly contributes to exceptional longevity. Data. We use a unique dataset from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity\nSurvey with the largest sample to date of centenarians, nonagenarians, octogenarians, and a compatible group of young old\naged 65\u00ad79. Methods and Results. Logistic regressions based on the cross-sectional sample show that after controlling for various\nconfounders, including physical health and cognitive status, centenarians are significantly more resilient than any other old-age\ngroup. Logistic regression analyses based on the longitudinal data show that nonagenarians aged 94\u00ad98 with better resilience have\na 43.1% higher likelihood of becoming a centenarian compared to nonagenarians with lower resilience. Conclusions. Resilience\nsignificantly contributes to longevity at all ages, and it becomes even more profound at very advanced ages. These findings indicate\nthat policies and programs to promote resilience would have long-term and positive effects on the well-being and longevity for\nsenior citizens and their families.\n1. Introduction\nExtant literature has highlighted the particular relevance\nof centenarians for healthy longevity research, given that\nthey have outlived most of their cohort peers by several\ndecades, and they represent a highly selected group. For\nexample, according to recent life-table data, the probability\nfor Chinese men and women, respectively, which is slightly\nless than one-fifth of that in the U.S. As shown by Flachsbart\nolds in Germany are likely to reach the age of 100. A study\nby Yi and Vaupel [2] showed that about 3.4% of 90-year-olds\nand 14.9% of 95-year-olds in China are likely to survive to the\nage of 100. These figures indicate that centenarians are highly\nselected long-lived individuals, even among those who have\nreached 90\u00ad95 years old. A focus on extreme cases is often\na good way to gain research leverage at reasonable expense;\nthus, investigating centenarians (some of whom are healthy\nand demonstrate successful aging) and comparing them with\nother younger age groups is an efficient way to learn what\nfactors may contribute to healthy longevity.\nResilience, a psychological construct, has been defined\ndifferently in extant literatures. In this paper, we adopt\nthe simplified and straightforward definition specified by\nLamond et al. [3]; namely, resilience connotes the ability to\nadapt positively to adversity. Previous studies have demon-\nstrated that resilience is generally positively correlated with\ncognitive function, physical health and self-reported health\namong the elderly [4\u00ad6], as well as with self-rated successful\naging [3] in developed countries. Poon [7] discovered that\nthe common characteristics of the Georgia centenarians\nsample are optimism and flexibility, which are documented\nto be associated with resilience [8]. Based on a Swedish\nsample, Nygren [9] found that mean resilience scores are\nhigher in their oldest old sample (over age 85) compared\nto the scores of the younger adults. Selim [10] discovered\nthat U.S. centenarian veterans are psychologically resilient\ndespite their poor physical health. Jopp and Rott [11] also\ndemonstrated that psychological resilience is well preserved\n2  \nAge group\nUrban Rural Rural-urban combined\nMen Women Total Men Women Total Men Women Total\nat the very end of the life span based on the Heidelberg\nCentenarian Study.\nHowever, there are three major limitations in the pre-\nvious research on centenarians and resilience. First, most\nof the prior studies were based on small samples with\nlimited numbers of centenarians and nonagenarians, which\nrestricted estimation efficiency [11, 12]. After a careful lit-\nerature search, we have discovered that among all published\nstudies concerning the characteristics and effects of resilience\namong centenarians with a comparison to other age groups,\nthe largest sample was 272 Japanese centenarians by Yukie et\nSecond, though some studies compared resilience bet-\nprior research (to our knowledge) has explored whether\nresilience contributes to exceptional longevity at very adva-\nThird, almost all previously published studies in this\nfield dealt with developed countries; we found very few\nstudies on centenarians and resilience from developing\npositive association between resilience and survival among\nthe Chinese elderly aged 65+, but they did not investigate\nwhether the association still held at extremely advanced\nages, for example, age 95 and older. As Ju and Jones [16]\nnoted, in high-mortality populations, the oldest old are\nthose highly selected individuals who have survived dangers\nwhen being born, risks in infancy and childhood, and\nhunger, sickness, and accidents at middle- and young-old\nages. As evidence of the high-mortality selection in China,\nthere were about five centenarians per million in China\nEurope [17]. Another important factor is that facilities to\nassist oldest old persons in their daily life are less likely\nto be available in developing countries than in industrial\ncountries. This may force the oldest old in developing\ncountries to perform daily activities by themselves, and\nthe frequent exercise may enable them to maintain their\nphysical capacities for a longer time than their counterparts\nin developed countries. These factors may help to explain\nwhy the elderly in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,\nSingapore, and Thailand have, in some comparative studies,\nfound to be more active than the elderly in developed\ncountries [16, 18]. Similarly, the functional capacity of\ncentenarians in the three cities of Beijing, Hangzhou, and\nChengdu in China has also been reported to be significantly\nbetter than that of Danish centenarians [19]. Thus, research\non centenarians from developing countries including China,\nwhere the oldest old individuals are highly selected from poor\nearly-life conditions and severe adversities, may be useful for\nidentifying what factors may affect exceptional longevity.\nof the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey\ncentenarians and 4,596 nonagenarians, as well as the follow-\nup data from the exceptionally long-lived individuals in\nfollowing hypotheses.\nH1 after controlling for various potential confounders\nincluding physical health and cognitive status, cen-\ntenarians are significantly more resilient than the\nyounger elderly.\nH2 better resilience significantly contributes to excep-\ntional longevity at very advanced ages.\n2. Data, Measurements, and Methods\n2.1. Data Source. The datasets used in this paper are from\ncounties/cities in 22 Chinese provinces, covering 85% of the\n2000 followup surveys interviewed the oldest old aged 80 and\nabove only; since the 2002 wave, younger-old respondents\naged 65\u00ad79 were also included in the sample. Careful and\nsystematic evaluations (such as reliability coefficients and\nfactor analysis, etc.) have shown that the data quality of the\nCLHLS surveys is reasonably good [21].\nCross-sectional data from the newest CLHLS wave\nwave by urban-rural residence, age groups, and gender.\nComparative analysis on the resilience scores between\ncentenarians and the other age groups may only reveal\nthe \"de facto\" differences in resilience scores between the\ncentenarians and the younger elders. Such cross-sectional\nanalysis may not be suitable to examine the impact of\nresilience on attaining exceptional longevity as proposed by\nhypothesis H2. Thus, we conduct another set of multivariate\n  3\nanalyses based on the follow-up data including those aged\nsurvey (we include the nonagenarians who were interviewed\nand 2000 wave of CLHLS, because two of the seven resilience\nwave). The rationale for these analyses is that we wish\nto investigate whether resilience significantly contributes\ninterview among the nonagenarians who are the potential\ncandidates and need to survive for at least two more years\nbecoming a centenarian).\nResilience. As the datasets used in this paper are derived\nfrom the CLHLS which is a typical demographic study on\ndeterminants of healthy longevity rather than a detailed\npsychological investigation, we use a simplified resilience\nscore (abbreviated as SRS hereafter) emphasizing coping\nand adjustment among the elderly. Our SRS is theoretically\nguided by the general framework of, but different from,\nthe Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) [22]. The\nSRS is based on the available data collected through seven\nquestions related to resilience in the CLHLS (See Table 2). In\ngeneral, the seven items reflect personal tenacity, optimism,\ncoping with negative mood, secure relationship, and self-\ncontrol, which are deemed as important factors of resilience\n[22]. These items have their own counterparts in CD-RISC\nwhich deliver similar meanings. For example, item 1 of SRS\ncorresponds to the item \"Think of self as strong person\" in\nCD-RISC; item 2 corresponds to the item \"See the humorous\nside of things\"; items 3 and 4 correspond to the item \"Can\nhandle unpleasant feelings\". In fact, some previous studies\nhave also proposed resilience scales with very limited number\nof items focusing on one or two specific aspects of resilience.\nFor example, Smith [23] proposed a Brief Resilience Scale\n(BRS), which included 6 items and focused on the ability\nto bounce back or recover from stress. Sinclair and Wallston\n[24] constructed a Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) with\n4 items, emphasizing on the resilient coping process.\nItems 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 of SRS in the CLHLS carry a\nfive-point (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) range of the responses (see\nTable 2). We dichotomize the scores of items 5 and 6, because\nthe rather detailed multiple choices of the answers for these\ntwo items only allow us to do so. With such scores which\ncontain the maximum information, we can obtain from the\nsurvey the total SRS ranges from 0 to 22, with higher scores\nreflecting greater resilience.\nThe internal consistency of SRS measured by Cronbach's\nalpha coefficient is 0.69, indicating its reliability is reason-\nTable 2: Measures of resilience: questions of the seven items asked\nin the CLHLS interviews.\nItems\nItem statements\nquestions\nScores based on answers\nDo you feel the older\nyou get, the more useless\nyou are?\nsometimes; 3. seldom; 4. never\nDo you always look on\nthe bright side of things?\nsometimes; 1.seldom; 0. never\nDo you often feel fearful\nor anxious?\nsometimes; 3. seldom; 4. never\nDo you often feel lonely\nand isolated?\nsometimes; 3. seldom; 4. never\nTo whom do you usually\ntalk most frequently in\ndaily life?\n1.

Principle component analysis generates\nthree factors with eigenvalues >1, explaining 78.5% of the\ntotal variance. These basic indicators of the psychometric\nproperties show that the SRS based on the CLHLS data are\nreasonably acceptable.\nIf the respondents are able to answer the questions 5\nand 6 regarding social support, they do so; otherwise, proxy\nresponses are allowed because spouses and close relatives\ntypically know respondents' sources of social support (proxy\nresponses are widely used in interviews with elderly [26].\nThe proportions of proxy answers for question 5 and 6 in\nconducted regression analyses excluding the cases with proxy\nresponses, and found very similar results between excluding\nand including the proxy responses). Questions concerning\nresilience items 1\u00ad4 and item 7 (see Table 2) relate to the self-\nfeelings of the elderly and may not be judged accurately by\nothers; thus, they are required to be answered by the elderly\nrespondent him/herself in the survey. As a result, 17.1% of\nthe respondents are unable to answer these questions due\nto poor cognitive ability. Simply, excluding these cases with\nthe missing values might lead to sampling bias. Thus, we\nconduct multiple imputations for the missing values of these\nfive resilience items based on the respondents' age, gender,\nrace, education, physical health measured by Activities of\nDaily Living (ADL), and cognitive status measured by Mini\nMental State Examination (MMSE) [27].\n2.2.2. Potential Confounding Factors\nAge Group. We categorize the continuous age variable into 4\n4  \nDemographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics. We include\ngender (male or female), race (Han ethnicity or minority),\nresidential place (urban or rural), marital status (currently\nmarried or unmarried including widowed, divorced, and\nnever married), education (literate or illiterate), and pension\nstatus (with or without pension) as demographic and\nsocioeconomic controls. Each control variable is measured\nas a dummy variable.\nHealth Status. Health status is measured by ADL and MMSE,\nwhich are based on international standards and adapted\nto the Chinese culture and social context with carefully\nconducted pilot study tests. More specifically, ADL is based\non Katz's ADL index, representing the physical health of\nthe elderly [28]. If a person needs help to perform any of\nthe six daily tasks of bathing, dressing, indoor transferring,\ngoing to the toilet and cleaning oneself afterwards, eating,\nand continence, he/she is considered to be ADL dependent;\notherwise, he/she is regarded as ADL independent. MMSE\nhas been widely used for assessing cognitive mental status\nboth in clinical practice and in research [29, 30]. The MMSE\nquestionnaire includes 24 items with a total possible score\nof 30. We define those who have a score of less than 24 as\ncognitively impaired [30].\nResilience might have an indirect impact on survival\nthrough health status of the elderly. Thus, we control\nfor health status in the models so that we can examine\nwhether resilience has a direct impact on survival among\nthe elderly. A similar design has been used in previous\nstudies. For example, to examine the effect of religious\nattendance on mortality, Hill et al. [31] first ran the\nregression without controlling for health status and then\nincluded ADL, cognitive function, and other health measures\nin the model to see whether the effect of religious attendance\non survival persisted and whether part of the effect of\nreligious attendance was mediated through health status.\n2.3. Methods. In the empirical analyses, the original SRS\nvariable (ranging from score 0 to 22) is dichotomized into\ntwo categories according to the mean of resilience scores:\nhigher resilience (with a resilience score 16) and lower\nresilience (with a resilience score <16).

We also\nadjust for the year of the interview and for dummy variables\nindicating province.\n3. Results\n3.1. Descriptive Analysis. As shown by the descriptive statis-\ntics based on the cross-sectional data presented in Table 3,\nthe mean SRS are the highest for the young-old aged 65\u00ad79\nwithout controlling for other covariates, while there are very\nlittle differences among the octogenarians, nonagenarians,\nand centenarians. Men have better SRS than women. A\nmuch larger proportion of the older men are literate and\nenjoy pension compared to the older women, due to the\nsocial background of gender inequality in China in the past.\nAdditionally, men are more advantaged in ADL and MMSE\nthan women in each of the age groups.\nFigure 1 depicts the weighted average SRS by 5-year\nage groups, gender, and urban-rural residence. Elderly men\nare always more resilient than their female counterparts in\neach of the age groups depicted in the figure. In general,\nthe average SRS in urban and rural among the young old\naged 65\u00ad69 is the highest and then decline as age increases.\nHowever, the SRS remains relatively stable after age 85. The\nChinese elderly residing in urban area have higher resilience\nscores than their rural counterparts (see Figure 1).\n3.2. Centenarians Are Significantly More Resilient than Any\nOther Elderly Adults, After Controlling for Various Con-\nfounders Including Health. Table 3 and Figure 1 have shown\nthat the average SRS of centenarians is lower than that of\nthe younger respondents aged below 85 (except the average\nSRS of the female rural centenarians which is slightly higher\nthan that of female rural elderly aged 80\u00ad84). Table 4 presents\nestimates of the odds ratios regarding the associations of\nage-group dummy variables with better resilience among\n  5\nTable 3: Descriptive statistics of the variables investigated in this study.\nMen Women Men Women Men Women Men Women\nNote: the mean SRS among the elderly aged 65\u00ad79, 80\u00ad89, and 90\u00ad99, presented in this table and in Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are weighted averages, using the\n2000 census rural-urban-sex-age distributions and the corresponding CLHLS 2008-2009 sample distributions to compute the weights. The mean resilience\nscores of the centenarians are unweighted as the CLHLS study tried to interview all of the centenarians in the sampled areas.\nthe elderly population. The results of model 1 indicate that\nwithout adjusting for any confounders, the likelihoods of\nenjoying better resilience for the octogenarians, nonagenari-\nlower than that for the young old aged 65\u00ad79. After adding\ndemographic and socioeconomic characteristics into model\n2, the odds ratios for the octogenarians, nonagenarians, and\ncentenarians (as compared to the young old aged 65\u00ad79)\nincrease substantially, but are still significantly less than 1.0,\nindicating that the age difference is largely reduced with\nthe addition of these controls. Model 3 further adjusts for\nphysical health and cognitive mental status measured by ADL\nand MMSE; once these health variables are controlled for,\ncentenarians are in fact, significantly more resilient than the\nyoung old by a margin of 26.1% (P < .01), nonagenarians\nalso marginally enjoy better resilience than the young old by\na margin of 10.9% (P < .1), while there is no significant\ndifference in resilience between octogenarians and the young\nold (we also ran ordinary least square regressions using the\noriginal SRS scores (ranging from 0 to 22) as the continuous\ndependent variable, and the results (data not shown due\nto space limitations) support the same conclusion as the\nlogistic regressions do shown in Table 4). These results\nshow that centenarians are a highly selected and special\nsubpopulation with the best resilience after controlling for\nvarious confounders including health.\nWe further estimate the odds ratios separately for men\nand women in Model 4 and Model 5. We find that after\nadjusting for all potential confounders including ADL and\nMMSE, male and female centenarians are significantly\nmore resilient than the young old, and the difference is\nsubstantially larger among men than among women.\nThe age pattern of resilience presented in Table 4 is, in\ngeneral, similar to the findings from the study by Nygren and\ncolleagues [9] on a Swedish oldest old sample aged 85 and\nolder and the research by Lamond and colleagues [3] on the\nAmerican elderly aged 65 and older, though both of these two\nstudies did not provide explicit estimates for centenarians.\nWe discover that centenarians' average SRS without adjusting\nfor confounders is lower than that of the young-old due to\ntheir poorer objective health. After the health status variables\nare controlled for, the centenarians are much more resilient\nthan the young old.\nRegarding the confounding variables, we find that after\nadjusting for various other confounders, men are signifi-\ncantly more resilient than women; the elderly residing in\nurban areas, having at least one year of schooling, and\nenjoying pension benefits have significantly better resilience.\nMarriage has a very strong positive impact on resilience.\nBetter physical health and cognitive status significantly\nimprove resilience (see Table 4).\n3.3. Better Resilience Significantly Contributes to Exceptional\nLongevity at Very Advanced Ages. As shown in Table 5, the\nlikelihood of surviving to age 100 for the elderly aged 94\u00ad\nscore was 74.6% (P < .01) higher than the likelihood of\ntheir counterparts with lower resilience scores in Model 1\nwith no controls. After the demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics are adjusted for in Model 2, the odds ratio\nfor high resilience slightly increase to 1.877, which indicates\nthat the nonagenarians aged 94\u00ad97 with a higher resilience\nscore have a 87.7% (P < .01) higher chance of becoming\na centenarian as compared to their peers with similar\ndemographic and socioeconomic characteristics but a lower\nresilience score. After further adjusting for health outcomes,\nbut remains highly significant (P < .01). This indicates\nthat resilience has a direct effect on achieving exceptional\nlongevity, while part of its total effect operates indirectly\nthrough the pathway of health. We also further estimate\nthe odds ratios separately for men and women in Models\n4 and 5, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics and health outcomes. It turns out that the\nmale and female nonagenarians with higher resilience scores\nchances to become a centenarian, respectively.\n6  \nTable 4: Estimates of odds ratios of higher simplified resilience scores (SRS) based on logistic regression.\nDependent variable:\nhigher resilience score\nTotal sample Total sample Total sample Men Women\nAge group\nDemographic\ncharacteristics\nMarried (Notmarried\nincluding widowed,\ndivorced, and single)\nWith pension (No\npension)\nHealthstatus\nADL independent\n(Impaired)\nNormal cognition\n(Impaired)\nWhether the province\ndummy is controlled for\nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNotes: (1) the categories in the parenthesis are reference groups.

However, the findings\nof our present study can be explained by the general\nliterature on resilience as the ability to adapt positively to\nadversity among old adults [3]. When individuals reach\nvery advanced ages, accumulated negative conditions such\nas health deterioration and bereavement of loved family\nmembers represent serious challenges. Thus, nonagenari-\nans who are more resilient may have stronger capacities\nand potentials for dealing successfully with these serious\nchallenges, constraints, and adversities [11] to subsequently\n4. Discussions and Conclusion\nBased on a cross-sectional dataset with the largest sample size\nto date of centenarians, nonagenarians, and octogenarians\nplus a compatible group of young-old aged 65\u00ad79, the\ndescriptive statistics show that the average resilience score\namong centenarians is lower than that of the other elderly\nage groups. However, our multivariate logistic analyses\nbased on the same dataset have confirmed the hypothesis\nthat after controlling for various potential confounders\nincluding physical health and cognitive status, centenarians\nare significantly more resilient than any other age group of\nthe elders.\nWe also investigate the role resilience played in con-\ntributing to exceptional longevity based on the follow-up\nbetter resilience contributes significantly to the likelihood of\nbecoming a centenarian (i.e., exceptional longevity) among\nthe nonagenarians.\nA previous study based on CLHLS longitudinal data\nshowed that on average, better resilience reduced mortality\nrisk by about 15.5% among all elderly adults aged 65+,\nadjusted for various confounding factors including physical\nand mental health [15]. Our present multivariate analysis\nfocuses on centenarians and nonagenarians. We have shown\n  7\nTable 5: Odds ratios of the impact of the resilience on nonagenarians' likelihood to become a centenarian based on multivariate logistic\nregressions.\nDependent variable: whether\nTotal sample Total sample Total sample Men Women\nDemographic\ncharacteristic\nMarried (Notmarried\nincluding widowed, divorced,\nand single)\nHealthstatus\nWhether the province dummy\nis controlled for\nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nWhether the year dummy is\ncontrolled for\nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNotes: the same as in Table 4.\nthat the positive effect of the resilience on enhancing the like-\nlihood of surviving to the age of 100 among nonagenarians\nseems that the positive effects of the resilience on survival at\nvery advanced ages may be more profound.\nWhy is resilience positively associated with survival at\nvery advanced ages in China? One possible explanation is\nthat resilience is correlated with improved physical and psy-\nchological health, and better health increases the probability\nof survival. As shown in our logistic regression analyses,\nthe effect of resilience on the likelihood of becoming a\ncentenarian shrinks substantially after variables of initial\nhealth status are included in the model. Prior investigations\nalso lend support to this explanation. For instance, Wagnild\n[5] and Lamond [3] indicated that resilience was positively\nassociated with physical and cognitive function. Ong [32]\ndemonstrated that resilient individuals were more likely to\nhold positive emotions, which promoted both resistance to\nand recovery from stress and thus contributed to better\nhealth and longevity.\nWhile the study presented in this paper is unique in terms\nof its largest sample size of centenarians and nonagenarians\nand interesting findings about the remarkable and significant\neffect of resilience on exceptional longevity at very advanced\nages in a developing country, it should be interpreted with\ncaution due to its inherent limitations. First, because the\nCLHLS is a demographic survey focusing on the determi-\nnants of healthy longevity such as demographic characteris-\ntics, socioeconomic status, life style, and health status of the\nelderly, we cannot assess as many resilience indicators as with\nother specific psychological surveys. Future research that\ncollects more sophisticated psychological data could deepen\nour understanding of the impacts of resilience on healthy\nlongevity in China. Second, we only examine the impact\nof resilience on exceptional longevity at advanced ages,\nrather than the mechanisms of how resilience works. Perhaps\nresilience strengthens the positive function of the immune\nsystem and certain gene(s) or ameliorates the negative\nimpacts of some other gene(s). More detailed phenotypic\nand genotypic data and advanced interdisciplinary research\nacross social and biomedical sciences are called for to explore\nthe mechanisms.\nIn conclusion, the present study provides strong evi-\ndence to support the hypotheses that after adjusting for\nvarious confounders including current health, centenarians\nare significantly more resilient than any other age group of\nthe elderly population and that better resilience contributes\nsignificantly to exceptional longevity even at very advanced\nages. These findings are not only scientifically meaningful\n8  \nbut also have policy relevance, indicating that policies and\nprograms aiming at the promotion of resilience among old\ncitizens ought to be put on the agenda. We may learn\nfrom the successful practices in other countries, such as\nresilience-promotion interventions conducted in Norway,\nwhich involve promoting expression of feeling and encourag-\ning participants' attempts to make meaningful connections\nbetween their past, present, and future lives [33]. Such efforts\nwould have long-term and positive effects on the well-being\nand healthy longevity for elderly citizens and their families.\n"
