OGIB is defined as bleeding of unknown\norigin that persists or recurs after esophagogas-\ntroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, or the radiological\nevaluation of the small bowel.3 OGIB accounts for\n5% of all cases of gastrointestinal bleeding, and is\noften caused by small bowel lesions.4 In patients\npresenting with OGIB, the diagnostic yield of\nvideo capsule endoscopy (VCE) ranges from 38%\nto 93%,5,6 and is superior to other diagnostic\nmodalities, including push enteroscopy, computed\ntomography, and angiography.7 Thus, VCE is\nClinical outcome of patients with\nobscure gastrointestinal bleeding during\nantithrombotic drug therapy\nYoshiyasu Kono, Seiji Kawano, Yuki Okamoto, Yuka Obayashi, Yuki Baba,\nHiroyuki Sakae, Makoto Abe, Tatsuhiro Gotoda, Toshihiro Inokuchi,\nHiromitsu Kanzaki, Masaya Iwamuro, Yoshiro Kawahara and Hiroyuki Okada\n Keywords: antithrombotic drug, capsule endoscopy, obscure gastrointestinal bleeding\nCorrespondence to:\nYoshiyasu Kono\nDepartment of\nGastroenterology and\nHepatology, Okayama\nUniversity Graduate School\nof Medicine, Dentistry and\nPharmaceutical Sciences,\nJapan\nSeiji Kawano\nYuki Okamoto\nYuka Obayashi\nYuki Baba\nHiroyuki Sakae\nMakoto Abe\nTatsuhiro Gotoda\nToshihiro Inokuchi\nHiromitsu Kanzaki\nMasaya Iwamuro\nHiroyuki Okada\nDepartment of\nGastroenterology and\nHepatology, Okayama\nUniversity Graduate School\nof Medicine, Dentistry and\nPharmaceutical Sciences,\nOkayama, Japan\nYoshiro Kawahara\nDepartment of Endoscopy,\nOkayama University\nHospital, Okayama, Japan\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11\n2 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nrecommended as the initial investigation to detect\nsources of bleeding.6,8\nThere have been some reports on the clinical out-\ncomes or risk factors for rebleeding in patients\nwith OGIB.9\u00ad11 Additionally, some authors have\ndescribed an increased relative risk of recurrent\nOGIB in patients under anticoagulant ther-\napy.12\u00ad14 However, the clinical outcome of patients\nwith OGIB during antithrombotic drug therapy\nhas not been investigated in detail.\nThe aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical\noutcome of patients with OGIB according to their\nantithrombotic drug use.\nMethods\nStudy design and patients\nThis was a single center, retrospective, observa-\ntional study. Patients who underwent VCE for\nthe investigation of OGIB at Okayama University\nenrolled. Patients in whom the source of bleeding\nwas proven to be outside the small intestine were\nexcluded. All patients underwent upper and lower\ngastrointestinal endoscopy before VCE, and it\nwas confirmed that the examinations were nega-\ntive or insufficient to explain the bleeding.\nBalloon-assisted endoscopy (BAE) was carried\nout as a therapeutic intervention, or diagnostic\nbiopsy was performed, as necessary. In patients\nwho underwent VCE two or more times, only the\nfirst examination was included in the present\nstudy. Written informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients for inclusion in the study. This\nstudy protocol was approved by the Okayama\nUniversity Hospital Ethics Committee in April\nVariables\nThe clinical parameters of the patients including\nage, sex, comorbidities (hypertension, chronic\nkidney disease, liver cirrhosis, ischemic heart dis-\nease, and hematologic disease), antithrombotic\ndrug use (antiplatelet or anticoagulant), concomi-\ntant drug use [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs (NSAIDs), proton-pump inhibitor (PPI),\nhistamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2-RA), and\nmucoprotective agent], VCE findings, patterns of\nOGIB (overt bleeding or occult bleeding), treat-\nment methods, and rebleeding rate within 1 year\nwere analyzed. OGIB is often further subclassi-\nfied into two types: obscure\u00adoccult, characterized\nby recurrent iron-deficiency anemia or positive\nfecal occult blood testing, and obscure\u00adovert,\ncharacterized by the passage of visible blood,\nWe classified the enrolled patients into the\nantithrombotic drug user and antithrombotic\ndrug nonuser groups, and compared their clinical\noutcomes. First, we evaluated the rates of VCE\npositivity according to the patterns of OGIB.\nSecond, we evaluated the rebleeding rates accord-\ning to the VCE findings among the overt bleeding\ncases and the occult bleeding cases. Third, we\nevaluated the rebleeding rates among patients\nwho received no therapeutic intervention.\nVideo capsule endoscopy\nVCE was later performed with a video capsule\nendoscopy device (PillCam SB2, Given Imaging\nLtd., Yokneam, Israel). The capsule was swal-\nlowed with a solution of dimethicone after over-\nnight fasting, without any other preparation. At\n2 h) and 4 h after swallowing the capsule, the\npatients were allowed to drink clear liquids and to\neat a light meal, respectively; at 8 h after swallow-\ning the capsule, the sensor array and recording\ndevice were removed. The images were analyzed\non a RAPID 6.5 workstation using with the Rapid\nReader 6 software program (software and work-\nstation from Given Imaging Ltd.). Two experi-\nenced endoscopists made the diagnoses after\nreaching an agreement with each other.\nThe definition of the video capsule endoscopy\nfindings and rebleeding\nThe VCE findings were classified according to the\nP0-P2 system,16 where P0 are less-relevant lesions\nthat are definitive but not likely to be the cause of\nOGIB; P2 lesions are highly relevant lesions con-\nsidered to be the cause of OGIB, such as angioec-\ntasia, varix, the presence of active bleeding,\nulceration, multiple (3) erosions, diverticulum\nand tumor. Examinations that revealed one or\nmore P2 lesions were recorded as VCE positive.\nAn episode of rebleeding was defined as evidence\nof bleeding within 1 year after the index bleeding\nin cases of obscure\u00adovert bleeding, or within 1\nyear after VCE in the patients with obscure\u00adoccult\nbleeding.17 Bleeding was defined as a documented\nY Kono, S Kawano et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3\nfall in the Hb level of 2 g/dl from the baseline level,\nthe need for transfusion, or evidence of melena or\nStatistical analysis\nThe sequential data were expressed as the median\nand interquartile range (IQR).

One patient received\ninterventional radiology, and four patients under-\nwent surgery for hemostasis; they all had good\nbotic drug users ceased taking antithrombotic\ndrugs after the bleeding event; however, there\nwere no thrombotic complications.\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrated the risk of rebleeding in\nOGIB patients according to their use of antithrom-\nbotic drugs. Among the antithrombotic drug\nusers, the rate of VCE positivity was significantly\nhigher among the patients with overt OGIB than\nit was among those with occult OGIB, and the\nrate of rebleeding in the patients with overt OGIB\nwho were VCE positive was significantly higher in\ncomparison with that in the patients who were\nVCE negative. Patients with overt OGIB who\nwere VCE positive and who used antithrombotic\ndrugs had a greater risk of rebleeding; these fac-\ntors are a good indication for a VCE survey and\ntherapeutic intervention. Among the patients\nwith occult OGIB who were antithrombotic drug\nnonusers, the risk of rebleeding was quite low\nregardless of the VCE findings, and no therapeu-\ntic intervention was required.\nBased on the results of this study, we suggest that\npatients with OGIB should be managed accord-\ning to the pattern of OGIB and their use of\nantithrombotic drugs (Figure 7). We recommend\ntherapeutic intervention for patients with overt\nOGIB who are VCE positive because of their\nhigh risk of rebleeding, especially if they use\nantithrombotic drugs. On the other hand, no\ntherapeutic intervention is needed among\npatients with occult OGIB who are VCE negative\nand who do not use antithrombotic drugs because\nrebleeding rarely occurs in such cases. Although\nthe difference was not statistically significant, the\nrate of rebleeding was relatively high among\npatients with overt OGIB who were VCE positive\nand antithrombotic drug nonusers, and among\npatients with occult OGIB who were VCE posi-\ntive and antithrombotic drug users. Careful fol-\nlow up should be needed for such cases. We\npropose following these patients every 2 or 3\nmonths with a blood test, and by performing an\nendoscopic examination such as VCE or BAE if\nFigure 5.

They may have a simi-\nlar risk of rebleeding, and may require careful fol-\nlow up or therapeutic intervention. However, the\nnumber of cases was small, and further study will\nbe needed to clarify this issue.\nThere have been few studies on the clinical charac-\nteristics of OGIB patients during antithrombotic\ndrug therapy. Shiotani and colleagues reported\nthat the incidence of erosion and ulcers was signifi-\ncantly higher among patients with OGIB whose\ncombination treatment included aspirin.19 Our\nstudy showed that the incidence of erosive lesions\nin antithrombotic drug users and antithrombotic\ndrug nonusers did not differ to a statistically sig-\nnificant extent. One reason for this was that not all\nof the patients in our study received aspirin, which\nmay induce small intestinal injuries.\nSeveral studies have suggested that the diagnos-\ntic yield in patients with overt OGIB is signifi-\ncantly higher in comparison with that in patients\nwith occult OGIB;20,21 others have suggested\nthat there were no significant differences\nbetween the two groups.22,23 In our study, the\nincidence of VCE positivity in patients with\novert OGIB and occult OGIB did not differ to a\nstatistically significant extent (32% versus 21%\np = 0.13). The controversy resulted from the\ndifferent definitions of VCE positivity in these\nstudies. As for the diagnostic yield of VCE in\nthe patients with OGIB during antithrombotic\ndrug therapy, Boal Carvalho and colleagues\nreported that anticoagulants, but not antiplate-\nlets, were associated with a significantly higher\nprevalence of P2 lesions in the small bowel.24\nOur study indicated different results, in that\nduring antithrombotic drug therapy, the diag-\nnostic yield of VCE in patients with OGIB\ndepended on the pattern of OGIB.\nFigure 6.

Koh and\ncolleagues recently reported that there was a sig-\nnificant risk increase of rebleeding in patients who\nunderwent VCE for OGIB while receiving antico-\nagulant therapy;5 Kim and colleagues analyzed\nthe risk factors for rebleeding in VCE-negative\npatients and identified warfarin use as an inde-\npendent risk factor.13 Our study did not show that\nthe use of antithrombotic drugs was a risk factor\nfor rebleeding, but demonstrated that patients\nwith overt OGIB who were VCE positive and\nwho used antithrombotic drugs had a greater risk\nof rebleeding, especially if they received no thera-\npeutic intervention. This was an innovative\ninsight in comparison with previous reports.\nThe present study is associated with some limita-\ntions. First, it was a retrospective, single-center\nstudy, and the sample size was not sufficient, espe-\ncially with regard to the population of antithrom-\nbotic drug users. Second, some patients who were\nVCE positive did not undergo a specific treatment\nbecause of spontaneous hemostasis. They could\nhave been at risk of rebleeding; thus, this might\nhave influenced the rate of rebleeding. Third,\nsome patients were followed up at other hospitals\nafter finishing the survey in our hospital.\nIn conclusion, the clinical features of OGIB\npatients differed according to their antithrom-\nbotic drug use. Since overt OGIB patients who\nwere VCE positive and who used antithrombotic\ndrugs had a greater risk of rebleeding, therapeutic\nintervention should be considered. The patterns\nof OGIB and the use of antithrombotic drugs are\nimportant for treatment strategies to manage\npatients with OGIB.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nConflict of interest statement\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nReferences\n1.
