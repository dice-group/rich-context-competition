    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe perception of object properties, such as size and weight, can be subject to illusions. Could a\nvisual size illusion influence perceived weight? Here, we tested whether the size-weight illusion\noccurs when lifting two physically identical but perceptually different objects, by using an illusion of\nsize. Participants judged the weight and length of 11 to 17 cm brass bars with equal density to\nwhich cardboard arrowheads were attached to create a Mu\n\u00a8ller\u00adLyer illusion. We found that these\nstimuli induced an illusion in which the bar that was visually perceived as being shorter was also\nperceived as feeling heavier. In fact, a 5-mm increase in illusory length corresponded to a decrease\nin illusory weight of 15 g.\n",

Smeets and Myrthe A. Plaisier\nVrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n Keywords\nheaviness perception, size-weight illusion, Mu\n\u00a8ller\u00adLyer illusion, multisensory perception\nCould an illusion in one sensory modality cause a chain of subsequent illusions in other\nsensory modalities? Here, we show that an illusory visual size difference can trigger an\nillusory haptic weight difference.\nIn the size-weight illusion, a small object is perceived to be heavier than a larger object of\nthe same mass (Charpentier, 1891). Would this illusion occur for identically sized objects\nwhen the perceived size is manipulated using a visual illusion? To answer this question, we\nused the well-known Mu\n\u00a8 ller\u00adLyer illusion. In this visual illusion, a line appears shorter or\nlonger, depending on the direction of the arrowheads flanking the ends of the line.\nPrevious research has shown that the size of an object is used to estimate the mass of the\nobject and scale lift forces (Gordon, Forssberg, Johansson, & Westling, 1991). Brenner and\nSmeets (1996) have shown that when lifting a disk in the Ponzo illusion, the lift forces are\nscaled according to the illusory size of the object. This suggests that a visual size illusion\ninfluences the anticipated mass of an object, which might induce a size-weight illusion.\nCorresponding author:\nMyrthe A.

Each stimulus\nconsisted of a black brass bar (1.4 \u00c2 1.4 cm thick) to which black cardboard arrowheads\nwere attached, so that the arrowheads moved with the bar when lifted. Participants were\nseating at a table and were presented with two Mu\n\u00a8 ller\u00adLyer stimuli at a time (Figure 1): a\nstandard stimulus (14 cm, 231 g) with inward or outward pointing arrowheads, and a test\nparticipants verbally indicated which of the two stimuli felt heavier after sequentially\nlifting the stimuli. In the length condition, participants indicated which of the two stimuli\nappeared longer by looking at the two stimuli. We used bars of equal density (8.4 g/cm3), so\nthe weights of the stimuli co-varied naturally with the lengths. The test stimulus that\nphysically matched the standard in size (i.e., the 14 cm bar) also matched the standard in\nweight. The same stimuli were used in the length and weight condition. To reduce possible\ninterference of the length condition on the weight condition, the conditions were performed\nin separate sessions, with the weight condition being performed first.\nFor both conditions, we measured a psychometric curve for each standard stimulus\n(``short'' and ``long''). We used a method of constant stimuli in which each combination\nof standard stimulus and test stimulus (n \u00bc 22) was presented nine times. Psychometric curves\nwere fitted using maximum likelihood estimation (Wichmann & Hill, 2001) to obtain the\npoint of subjective equality (PSE) for each participant and condition. The shift in PSE was\ncalculated as the PSE for the ``long'' standard stimulus minus the PSE for the ``short''\nstandard stimulus and divided by two (note that participants were always comparing two\nillusions). The illusion effect is the PSE shift expressed as a percentage of the length or weight\nFigure 1. The two configurations of the stimuli. Top-right: ``short,'' bottom-left: ``long.'' The position and\nconfiguration of the standard stimulus were counterbalanced over the top-bottom and left-right position.\nIn the length condition, participants only viewed the stimuli. In the weight condition, participants were\ninstructed to grasp and lift each bar at its center as indicated by the small line.\nof the standard stimulus. One participant was excluded because the PSE for the weight\nsession was outside of the stimulus range.\nFigure 2(a) shows that the psychometric curves, and thus the PSEs, were shifted with\nrespect to each other. On average, the ``short'' stimulus had to be 5 mm (4%) longer than\nthe ``long'' stimulus (one-sample t test: t(11) \u00bc 3.86, p \u00bc 0.003) to be perceived as having the\nsame length (Figure 2(b)). Furthermore, the ``short'' stimulus had to be 9 mm shorter (i.e.,\nperceived as having the same weight, reflecting a size-weight illusion. This means that the\nsame object that was perceived to be 5 mm longer in the length condition was perceived to be\n15 g lighter in the weight condition.\nWe tested whether a size-weight illusion would occur for objects of identical physical size\nand weight, but different perceptual sizes due to the Mu\n\u00a8 ller\u00adLyer illusion. Our results show\nthat we were able to induce a visual illusion by adding arrowheads to three-dimensional bars.\nWhen lifting these bars, these arrowheads induced a change in the perceived weight:\nperceptually longer stimuli were perceived as lighter than perceptually shorter stimuli.\nSince we did not alter the natural size-weight relationship of the test stimuli, this weight\nillusion can only be the result of the arrowheads inducing a visual length illusion.\nSurprisingly, the decrease in perceived weight did not match the decrease in weight that\nwould be expected given the visual perceived length difference. In a previous study, we found\nthat a physical size increase of 20% caused a perceived weight reduction of 5.5% (Plaisier &\nSmeets, 2015). Here, we found a much larger effect: a 4% increase in illusory length\nLength Weight\nIllusion effect (%)\nTest - standard length (cm)\nTest - standard weight (g)\nP (test heavier)\nP (test longer)\n(a) (b)\nStandard\nFigure 2.

A possible explanation for this\ndiscrepancy is that participant's sensitivity to the Mu\n\u00a8 ller\u00adLyer illusion and size-weight\nillusion might be different (Kawai, Henigman, MacKenzie, Kuang, & Faust, 2007).\nAnother possibility is that participants use different size estimates when judging length\nthen when judging weight (Smeets, Brenner, de Grave, & Cuijpers, 2002). For example, we\nhave shown that in the size-weight illusion, size can influence the weight percept independent\nof the volume of material (Plaisier & Smeets, 2015). Thus, perceived weight might, for\ninstance, also be influenced by the fact that total length of the stimulus, including the fins,\nis much larger in the visually long illusion than in the short illusion.\nSummarizing, we show that the same visual illusion that caused a 5-mm illusory length\nincrease caused an illusory weight decrease of about 15 g.\n"
