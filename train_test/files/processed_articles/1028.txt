Consistent with\nborhood or school has been offered as a primary reason\nwhy youth carry concealed firearms. In addition, behav-\niors associated with carrying such as drug and alcohol\nviolent victimization25 are known to be influenced by com-\nmunity factors.\nLevels of social and physical disorder are 2 features\nof urban neighborhoods associated with fear of victimiza-\ntion. When strangers behave in public spaces in ways that\nare considered threatening, these behaviors constitute so-\ncial disorder.26 Examples include interactions such as drug\ndealing, prostitution, loitering, or public intoxication. In\ncontrast, physical disorder describes the environmental de-\nterioration of urban landscapes, such as abandoned prop-\nerties, graffiti, and discarded drug paraphernalia and con-\ndoms. In addition to making people fearful of being\nvictimized, observation of disorder can influence the at-\ntributions that are made about a neighborhood and may\naffect real estate prices, investors, and community resi-\ndents' pride or willingness to actively contribute to its im-\nprovement.\nCollectiveefficacy,ontheotherhand,isaneighborhood-\nlevel construct that has been linked to reduced levels and\nperceptions of violence.

To our\nknowledge, this study represents the first attempt to as-\nsess the independent effects of individual-, family-, and\nneighborhood-levelcharacteristicsontheprobabilitythat\na youth has carried a concealed firearm.\nMETHODS\nData come from the Project on Human Development in Chi-\ncago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a multidisciplinary study of\nfamilies and neighborhoods. Study families are residents of\nChicago, Ill, and are of diverse races and ethnicities, socioeco-\nnomic status, and family structures. The PHDCN includes a\ncomprehensive community design as well as a longitudinal\ncohort study embedded within the community design. Data\nused in this study are cross-sectional and come from 4 sources:\n(1) wave 2 of the longitudinal cohort study; (2) systematic\nsocial observation of study neighborhoods; (3) an independent\ncommunity survey of Chicago residents; and (4) 1990 US cen-\nsus data. A detailed description of the PHDCN's design and\nmethods is available elsewhere.27 The institutional review\nboards of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of\nPublic Health (Boston, Mass) approved all procedures.\nInformed consent was obtained from both caregivers and\nyouth prior to each interview.\nSAMPLING\nSampling was accomplished in 2 stages. First, using 1990 US\ncensus data, 343 neighborhood clusters that were geographi-\ncally compact as well as similar in ethnic composition, socio-\neconomic status, housing density, and family structure were\nidentified and grouped into 7 strata of race and ethnic compo-\nsition according to tertiles of socioeconomic level. Each neigh-\nborhood cluster contained approximately 8000 residents. Among\nthese 21 strata were 3 empty cells; no neighborhood clusters\nwere more than 75% Hispanic with high socioeconomic sta-\ntus, more than 75% white with low socioeconomic status, or\nof mixed Hispanic and African American race with high socio-\neconomic status. Eighty neighborhood clusters were chosen for\nintensive study from the remaining 18 cells using stratified ran-\ndom sampling, except for 3 cells with fewer than 5 neighbor-\nhood clusters that were sampled with certainty.\nThe second goal of sampling was to select families resid-\ning within each of the 80 selected neighborhood clusters to com-\npose the longitudinal cohort study sample. Households were\nscreened for eligible children and adolescents within 6 months\nof 7 target cohort ages (0 [in utero through age 6 months], 3,\nvited to participate along with at least 1 primary caregiver for\nthose younger than 18 years.\nData used in our investigation were obtained from youth in the\n9-, 12-, and 15-year-old cohorts for whom the response rate\nwas 74%. For these cohorts, baseline assessments were con-\nand follow-up interviews were done with 1921 youth approxi-\nThe analytic sample for this investigation consisted of every-\none in this follow-up group who completed a questionnaire on\nfirearm carrying (n=1842). For the multilevel analyses\nside the city limits of Chicago between baseline and follow-up\nfor whom we no longer had neighborhood data. Mean values\nof the neighborhood variables calculated for this analytic sample\nwere the same (to the first decimal place) as those for the en-\ntire baseline sample. The analytic sample had approximately\nthe same demographic composition as the baseline one.\nCommunity Survey\nA random sample of adults were surveyed in 1995 to charac-\nterize residents' perceptions of Chicago neighborhoods, with\noversampling done in the selected 80 neighborhood clusters.\nticipants representing all 343 neighborhood clusters. The sur-\nvey focused on the social and organizational characteristics of\nneighborhoods, including assessments of violence and percep-\ntions of neighborhood danger. This sample was independent\nof the longitudinal cohort sample of families.\nSystematic Social Observation\nFor a description of natural social phenomena occurring in\nneighborhood environments, a systematic social observation\nstudy28 was conducted using block-by-block videotaping and\ntrained observers rating their observations as they were driven\ndown city streets at approximately 5 mph. This study was con-\nducted in 1995 and covered all 80 sampled neighborhood clus-\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nters, recording data from 23816 face blocks (the left and right\nsides of a street when one is in the middle of the road) for a\nmean of 298 per neighborhood cluster. A random sample of\n15141 videotaped face blocks was selected for coding owing\nto budgetary constraints. Detailed information on physical con-\nditions, housing characteristics, types of businesses, and nega-\ntive social interactions was coded.\nIn this study, models that included measures from the sys-\ntematic social observation study had a smaller sample size\n(n=1606) than those including data from the community sur-\nvey because 236 participants had moved away from the 80 ini-\ntial study neighborhoods before the follow-up interview. As de-\nscribed earlier, the 1995 community survey covered the entire\ncity of Chicago; thus, participants who moved to other Chi-\ncago neighborhoods were able to be kept in their particular mod-\nels using data from the community survey. This increased the\nneighborhood sample size (n=218).\nMEASURES\nItems regarding gun use were administered in the individual-\nlevel cohort study. Youth were asked (1) whether they had ever\ncarried a concealed or hidden gun anywhere; (2) whether any-\none in their home kept a gun; and (3) whether any family mem-\nbers had ever been shot or killed by a gun.\nA composite measure of family socioeconomic status was\ncreated based on principal components analysis29 of 3 variables--\nparental income, parental education, and parental occupational\ncode--taking the maximum value for each if there were 2 par-\nents in the household. A neighborhood-level index of concen-\ntrated poverty was derived from 1990 US census data for the pro-\nportion of residents who had an income lower than the poverty\nline, were unemployed, or were receiving public assistance.\nIndividual-level exposure to violence was measured by ask-\ning youths about their experiences during the past year.30 Con-\nfirmatory factor analysis31 showed that 3 separate constructs\nwere present. Hierarchical item response theory models32 con-\nfirmed which items fit within each construct, and 3 scales were\ndeveloped: (1) victimization, (2) witnessing violence, and (3)\nhearing about violence. These scales showed good reliability\nand validity (R. T. Brennan, EdD, B.E.M., and F. Earls, MD,\nunpublished data, 2004). Respondents were categorized as hav-\ning been victimized by violence if they reported being at-\ntacked with a weapon, beaten up, chased, shot at, or seriously\nthreatened. If they had witnessed these same acts perpetrated\non somebody else and/or saw someone being shot or killed, they\nwere categorized as having witnessed violence. They were cat-\negorized as having heard about violence if they reported hear-\ning about someone they knew being sexually assaulted, shot,\nor killed. Because the vast majority of the youth who carried\nconcealed firearms were in the highest quartile of exposure to\nviolence, dichotomous variables were also constructed for which\n1 represented the highest quartile and 0 constituted the re-\nmainder of the sample.\nSubjects were also administered a reduced version of the\nYouth Self-Report33 externalizing behavior problems scale, which\nassesses delinquent and aggressive behaviors in the past 6\nmonths. The scale scores are a sum of 21 items for which 0=not\ntrue, 1=somewhat true, and 2=very true. To lessen response\nburden in the follow-up interviews, a reduced version of the\nYouth Self-Report scale was created with factor analysis using\nthe sample's full-scale data from baseline interviews. Factor load-\nings for individual items contributing to the various subscales\nwere examined, and items that loaded least strongly on the scale\nwere dropped. The Cronbach  was calculated before and af-\nter dropping these items to ensure that the reliability of the scale\nmeasurement was not dramatically reduced. This was based both\non published values for the Youth Self-Report scale normative\nsamples33 and on the baseline results. The reduced instrument\nincluded 8 of 13 items for the delinquent behavior subscale and\n13 of 20 items for the aggressive behavior subscale.\nNeighborhood conditions related to fear of victimization\nwere measured on 4 scales with established psychometric prop-\nerties. Individual items in each of the scales are listed in Table 1.\nThe unsafe-to-play scale reflects residents' perceptions of the\nsafety of neighborhood clusters based on the 1995 commu-\nnity survey. Collective efficacy, a summary measure of infor-\nmal social control and social cohesion, was also derived from\nthe community survey.25 Each scale was formed by finding the\nmean for the item responses. Although most respondents in the\ncommunity survey answered all of the items, anyone respond-\ning to at least 1 item on a scale provided data for the analysis.\nUsing an unconditional 3-level hierarchical linear item-\nresponse model that took into account the number and diffi-\nculty of the answered items, a person-specific standard error\nwas calculated and was used to adjust for missing responses.25\nScales of social disorder and physical disorder were derived from\nthe systematic social observation study; descriptions of the meth-\nods and psychometric properties of these scales have been pub-\nlished previously.26,34 Ranges of values for each scale are pre-\nsented in Table 1. Prior to using these scales in the models\ndescribed as follows, they were all standardized to have a mean\nof 0 and an SD of 1.\nFor variables that were categorical, the 2 test of proportions\nwas used to assess bivariate relationships between risk factors\nand the carrying of concealed weapons. Spearman correlation\ncoefficients were used to test for bivariate relationships be-\ntween carrying firearms and risk factors that were continuous,\nincluding the 4 neighborhood-level scales in the study. Spear-\nman correlation coefficients were chosen because the dichoto-\nmous outcome variable is not normally distributed, requiring\na nonparametric test.\nBecause of the multilevel design, hierarchical nonlinear\nmodeling35 was used to estimate the relationship between\nindividual- and neighborhood-level independent variables and\nyouth gun carrying. The outcome was dichotomous, so the\nanalysis involved a standard hierarchical linear model with the\nintroduction of special weighting to linearize the outcome at\nlevel 1. After convergence, the weights were recalculated. This\nmethod resembles logistic regression, but by using multilevel\nmethods to account for clustering by neighborhoods, the re-\nsult is a proper estimation of standard errors. It also makes it\npossible to estimate contextual factors that may influence be-\nhavior independent of individual characteristics. Datasets were\nprepared for analysis using SAS version 8.0 statistical software\n(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and were analyzed with the sta-\nThe goal of the data analysis was to estimate the magni-\ntude of the association between 4 central neighborhood-level\nconstructs and youth firearm carrying, controlling for estab-\nlished individual- and family-level risk factors. Initial models\nincluded the neighborhood-level constructs, a fixed set of\nindividual-level variables (sex, age, race and ethnicity, and fam-\nily socioeconomic status), and neighborhood-level concen-\ntrated poverty. Theoretically, we considered the 4 neighborhood-\nlevel constructs to measure distinct but overlapping aspects of\nthe environment. Because of high correlations between them,\nthey were not able to be modeled simultaneously. Instead, the\nmodels that contained multilevel potential confounders were\nused 4 times with each of the primary neighborhood expo-\nsures added one at a time. Finally, individual-level risk factors\npreviously identified in the literature were added to each model:\nwhether the youth knew that a gun was kept at home, whether\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association.

In the bivariate analyses in Table 2,\nwhereas only half (50%) of the sample were male, they\nrepresented 82% of those carrying a concealed firearm.\nMore firearms were carried by older youth, with 71% of\nthe firearm carriers aged 16 to 19 years. There were no\nsignificant differences in concealed firearm carrying by\nrace or ethnicity or between families of different socio-\neconomic status.\nAlthough 10% of respondents reported living in a\nhousehold with a firearm, they accounted for 19% of those\nwho carried a firearm themselves. One third (32%) of re-\nspondents reported that they had a family member who\nhad been shot with a gun, and these accounted for 76%\nof participants who carried concealed firearms.\nOf the 56 youth who reported having carried a con-\ncealed gun, most had been exposed to high levels of vio-\nlence: 93% were in the highest quartile on the scale of\nwitnessing violence in the past year, 63% were in the high-\nest quartile of having heard about violent victimization\nof acquaintances during the past year, and 91% were in\nthe highest quartile reporting victimization by violence\nin the previous year. Similarly, most firearm carriers (63%)\nwere in the highest quartile on the scale of delinquent\nand aggressive behaviors.\nAt the neighborhood level, there were significantly\nhigher rates of concealed firearm carrying by youth in\nneighborhoods that were less safe and in those charac-\nterized by greater social disorder, physical disorder, and\nconcentrated poverty. Youth living in neighborhoods with\nhigher levels of collective efficacy reported less firearm\ncarrying (Table 2). In multilevel multivariate models, all\nof the neighborhood characteristics included in this study\nwere significantly associated with youth carrying con-\ncealed firearms when controlling for economic condi-\ntions at both family and neighborhood levels as well as\nfor age, sex, and race and ethnicity.\nThe primary focus of this investigation was whether\nthese neighborhood characteristics were associated with\nconcealed firearm carrying above and beyond indi-\nvidual and family correlates. The final step was to in-\nclude previously identified risk factors at the level of the\nindividual.

Youth in these neigh-\nborhoods may feel that the community provides a mea-\nsure of vigilance and protection as well as a level of over-\nsight that makes the act of carrying a firearm no longer\nnecessary or attractive. Many of the youth who lived in\nneighborhoods with higher collective efficacy were still\nexposed to violence; the correlation between collective\nefficacy and witnessing violence was low at 0.11. Infor-\nmal social control of children, a component of collec-\ntive efficacy, was associated with reduced delinquent be-\nhavior of adolescents in Chicago in a previous study.37\nPerhaps the social forces and norms found in these neigh-\nborhoods protected youth from taking the extreme step\nof arming themselves with guns even if they were ex-\nposed to violence.\nPrevious studies have shown that most adults (91%)\nwho carry concealed firearms obtain them from their\nhome.6 Given that handgun ownership is illegal in Chi-\ncago,1 youth who report guns kept at home may come\nfrom families with a greater propensity for illegal behav-\nior. However, only 2 (4%) of 56 firearm-carrying youth\nin our sample reported carrying a gun from home. In con-\ntrast, 64% had received or borrowed their gun from friends\nor family, 4% had stolen or traded for the gun, 5% had\nacquired the gun through unspecified means, and 23%\nhad bought the gun themselves, consistent with similar\nfindings by other investigators.38\nSeveral individual-level risk factors previously re-\nported to predict concealed firearm carrying among youth\nappear to predict carrying among Chicago youth, includ-\nber who has been shot,6 and other delinquent or aggres-\nsivebehaviors.4,7,8,18 Wefoundastrongassociationbetween\nindividual exposure to violence and carrying a con-\ncealed firearm, a relationship that held whether the youth\nhad experienced, witnessed, or heard about violence.\nThese results are consistent with literature that found that\nthe primary reason youth carry concealed firearms is for\nvey overwhelmingly reported that they carry guns for self-\nprotection, some gun carrying may be by youth who are\nengaged in a variety of criminal and antisocial activities.\nWe found an association between carrying a concealed\nfirearm and individual delinquency and aggression.\nIn this study, 4.9% of males and 1.1% of females be-\ntween the ages of 9 and 19 years reported having carried\na concealed firearm.

The sample size was 1745 total and 1606 for models 3 and 4. Unsafe-to-play, social disorder,\nphysical disorder, and collective efficacy scales are highly intercorrelated, necessitating separate models to estimate the association between each of them and\ngun carrying; concentrated poverty is included in all models. Social and physical disorder were measured only in the original 80 Chicago neighborhoods under\nintensive study, so youth who moved beyond those 80 neighborhoods between the first and second interviews could not be included in these models.

Thus, the prevalence in this study is still\nlower than the YRBS estimates. One possible explana-\ntion may be social desirability bias due to the differ-\nences in study methods. Carrying a concealed gun is a\nrare and extreme activity; the YRBS is self-administered\nand anonymous, whereas our study was interviewer ad-\nministered in subjects' homes. Therefore, the preva-\nlence of firearm carrying measured in this study may be\nan underestimate.\nOur study has several limitations. These data come\nfrom Chicago, a large city that is heavily segregated and\nhas particular laws that make handguns illegal to own.\nThe results may not be generalizable either to other ur-\nban areas without similar gun laws or segregation or to\nnonurban areas. To the extent that youth who carry guns\ncontribute to adults' perceptions of the social impover-\nishment of their neighborhoods, it is possible that the re-\nlationship between gun carrying and neighborhood is bi-\ndirectional (predominantly the reverse of what we\ndescribe) or not causally related. We were unable to evalu-\nate this possibility because we used cross-sectional data\nand could not estimate neighborhood-level gun carry-\ning using data from our sample, having only 56 gun car-\nriers distributed across 218 neighborhoods. A bidirec-\ntional, causal relationship between gun carrying and\nneighborhood safety offers the hope that an interven-\ntion targeted at either firearm carrying or neighborhood\ndisorder might break or at least mitigate a seemingly vi-\ncious cycle. In addition, we asked only whether youth\nin our survey had ever carried a gun, not how often or\nhow recently. As a result, we are unable to determine\nwhether there is a relationship between the frequency of\ngun carrying and our neighborhood scales. Finally, we\ndid not assess whether peers of the youths in the study\ncarried guns, a potentially important determinant of\nwhether a youth carries a firearm, although we did con-\ntrol for other delinquent and aggressive behaviors by the\nrespondents.\nDespite these limitations, an important strength of\nthis study is the large, multilevel design that allows us to\nexamine the association between neighborhood social\nprocesses and a rare outcome such as concealed firearm\ncarrying among adolescents. An additional advantage is\nthat our questions about firearm carrying and our mea-\nsures of neighborhood characteristics were obtained\nfrom separate samples. Because these data on neighbor-\nhood features do not come from the youth participants\nthemselves, they provide an independent source of\ninformation about perceived and observed levels of dis-\norder, safety, and collective efficacy that exist across\nneighborhoods.\nEach of these neighborhood characteristics is po-\ntentially modifiable and thus important when consider-\ning both primary and secondary prevention of youth vio-\nlence. The neighborhood-level constructs identified as\nstrongly associated with gun carrying by youth in this\ncohort have not previously been described and repre-\nsent potential targets for public health interventions. De-\ncreasing the degree to which a community is burdened\nby threatening or hostile behavior by adults, reclaiming\nthe number of public spaces available for children to play\nin, and supporting adults who are willing to intervene\nin the lives of their community's children may posi-\ntively alter the social dynamics that currently contrib-\nute to concealed firearm carrying by youth.\nfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (At-\nlanta, Ga) to the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.\nFunding for the PHDCN was provided by the John D. and\nCatherine T.

Previous research has\nidentified individual-level risk factors for youth carry-\ning firearms, especially concerns regarding personal safety\nin their communities. However, to our knowledge, no\nstudies have used a multilevel approach to identify pro-\ncesses in those communities that may increase or de-\ncrease the risk of carrying firearms. This study uses a mul-\ntilevel approach to identify potentially modifiable\nneighborhood-level correlates of firearm carrying by ado-\nlescents. Neighborhood social disorder, physical disor-\nder, and the rating of neighborhoods as unsafe for chil-\ndren to play in were each independently associated with\nincreased firearm carrying by youth. In addition, a posi-\ntive social process, collective efficacy, was found to be\nindependently associated with decreased firearm carry-\ning. All of these neighborhood-level correlates re-\nmained significant when individual-level risk factors were\nincluded in the models, demonstrating that reducing so-\ncial and physical disorder, increasing safety, and pro-\nmoting collective efficacy among neighbors have the po-\ntential to decrease the prevalence of youth carrying\nconcealed firearms and to reduce gun-related injuries.\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association.
