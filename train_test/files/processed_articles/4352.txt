Brown1* on behalf of the CAVATAS Investigators\nBackground The anatomy of carotid stenosis may influence\nthe outcome of endovascular treatment or carotid endarterec-\ntomy. Whether anatomy favors one treatment over the other\nin terms of safety or efficacy has not been investigated in\nrandomized trials.\nMethods In 414 patients with mostly symptomatic carotid\nstenosis randomized to endovascular treatment (angioplasty\nor stenting; n = 213) or carotid endarterectomy (n = 211) in the\nCarotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Study\n(CAVATAS), the degree and length of stenosis and plaque\nsurface irregularity were assessed on baseline intraarterial\nangiography. Outcome measures were stroke or death occur-\nring between randomization and 30 days after treatment, and\nipsilateral stroke and restenosis 50% during follow-up.\nResults Carotid stenosis longer than 0\u00b765 times the common\ncarotid artery diameter was associated with increased risk\nof peri-procedural stroke or death after both endovascular\nlong-term risk of restenosis in endovascular treatment [hazard\nendovascular treatment compared with carotid endarterec-\ntomy was significantly greater in patients with long stenosis\nthan with short stenosis at baseline (interaction P = 0\u00b7003).\nResults remained significant after multivariate adjustment. No\nassociations were found for degree of stenosis and plaque\nsurface.\nConclusions Increasing stenosis length is an independent risk\nfactor for peri-procedural stroke or death in endovascular treat-\nment and carotid endarterectomy, without favoring one treat-\nment over the other. However, the excess restenosis rate after\nendovascular treatment compared with carotid endarterec-\ntomy increases with longer stenosis at baseline. Stenosis length\nmerits further investigation in carotid revascularisation trials.\nKey words: carotid stenosis, endovascular treatment, endarterectomy,\nrestenosis, atherosclerosis, plaque length\nIntroduction\nEndovascular treatment (EVT) of carotid stenosis by percutane-\nous transluminal balloon angioplasty or insertion of a stent has\nemerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Ran-\ndomized controlled trials have shown an increased risk of peri-\nprocedural stroke associated with EVT compared with CEA, but\nthe excess in stroke risk was largely restricted to patients above the\nage of 70 (1,2).Besides demographic and clinical factors,anatomi-\ncal features of carotid stenosis may also contribute to differences\nin treatment risk. In previous research, plaque ulceration was\nassociated with peri-procedural complications in CEA, but not in\nEVT (3\u00ad6). The length of stenosis has been identified as a predic-\ntor of peri-procedural stroke in EVT (3,6,7). However, neither\nplaque irregularity nor length of stenosis has been included in\nsubgroup analyses of randomized trials comparing EVT versus\nCEA, and their impact on long-term outcome remains unknown.\nAims\nWe therefore analyzed all intraarterial carotid angiographies\nobtained at baseline in the Carotid and Vertebral Artery Translu-\nminal Angioplasty Study (CAVATAS) to answer the following\nquestions: (1) Do degree of carotid stenosis, length of stenosis, or\nirregular plaque surface predict procedural risks of EVT or CEA?;\n(2) Do these factors have an impact on the long-term durability of\nEVT or CEA in terms of recurrent ipsilateral stroke or carotid\nrestenosis?; and (3) Is one treatment superior to the other in terms\nof safety or efficacy depending on anatomy of stenosis?\nMethods\nPatients, randomization, treatment, and follow-up\nCAVATAS was a group of randomized, open, multicenter trials\ndesigned to evaluate risks and benefits of EVT in carotid and\nvertebral artery disease.

Trial methodology and initial results, as well as out-\ncomes up to 11 years after treatment, have been previously\nreported (8\u00ad10). In the initial phase of the study, EVT was per-\nformed by balloon angioplasty alone. Stents became available\nduring the trial and were used in 26% of patients in the EVT\ngroup, at the discretion of collaborating interventionists.\nApproved cerebral protection devices were not available at the\ntime of recruitment in CAVATAS. Collaborating surgeons used\ntheir preferred techniques for endarterectomy, either with\nprimary closure of the arteriotomy or closure with surgical\npatches. Patients in CAVATAS were examined by an independent\nneurologist at baseline and followed up 1, 6, and 12 months after\ntreatment and yearly thereafter. There was no predefined length of\nfollow-up, but centers were encouraged to follow up patients for\nas long as the center and individual patients were willing to do so.\nFollow-up ended in November 2007, 10 years after the last patient\nhad been recruited. For the present analysis, we included patients\nrandomized to EVT or CEA with available digital subtraction\nangiography (DSA) at baseline. CAVATAS is a registered trial\nCarotid imaging at baseline and during follow-up\nSelective DSA in at least two views was specified as the carotid\nimaging method of choice before randomization, in order to\nestablish the suitability of the lesion for either EVT or CEA.\nAlternatively, centers were allowed to randomize patients on the\nbasis of consistent findings in noninvasive magnetic resonance or\ncomputed tomography-based angiography (MRA and CTA) and\ncarotid duplex ultrasound (CDU). Due to limited image resolu-\ntion of films obtained from MRA and CTA at the time of recruit-\nment into CAVATAS, only patients examined with DSA were\nincluded in the present analysis.\nCDU of the carotid arteries was carried out one-year after\ntreatment as a minimum and at yearly intervals thereafter. In\nmany centers, additional examinations were performed one- and\nsix-months after treatment, if possible. If cerebrovascular events\noccurred during follow-up, additional CDU and angiography\n(MRA, CTA, or DSA) was performed at the discretion of the local\ninvestigators. As previously described, degree of stenosis on CDU\nwas determined by one investigator (L. H. B.) who was blinded to\ntreatment, based on standardized flow velocity criteria at the\ncentral study office (9), and expressed equivalent to NASCET\nangiography measures (11).\nAnatomical parameters of carotid stenosis\nA single, experienced investigator (L. H. B.) measured all DSA\nfilms obtained at baseline. The following parameters were\nassessed: Degree of stenosis was calculated according to the method\nused in NASCET (11). Length of stenosis was measured in two\nways (Fig. 1): Length 1 was defined as the distance between the\nproximal and the distal shoulder of the stenotic plaque, in the\nprojection that best elongated the stenosis (12). Length 2 was\ndefined as the distance between the proximal and distal points\nwhere the degree of stenosis decreased to 80% of its maximum,\nregardless of whether definite lesion shoulders were present or\nnot. To account for differences in scaling of DSA films, lengths 1\nand 2 were expressed as a fraction of the diameter of the distal\ncommon carotid artery (CCA), which was measured. The dis-\ntance between measurement of the CCA reference diameter and\ncarotid bifurcation had to equate at least 2\u00b75 times the CCA diam-\neter, because previous research has shown that the diameter of the\nCCA stabilizes proximal to this point (13). We evaluated two\ndefinitions of length of stenosis: first, using length 1 whenever two\ndefinite lesion shoulders were present, and using length 2 if the\nplaque did not have two definite shoulders; and second, using\nalways length 2. Plaque surface was classified as irregular or\nsmooth (14). Irregular surface comprised ulceration (seen in\nprofile as a crater extending from the lumen into a stenotic\nplaque, or on face view as a double density), or plaques with\nsurface irregularity or presence of multiple small craters not clas-\nsifying as ulcer niches (15).\nFig. 1 Measurement of length of stenosis. Stenosis length 1 (red line): distance between the two definite shoulders of the lesion. Stenosis length 2 (blue\nline): distance between the proximal and distal points where the degree of stenosis decreases to 80% of its maximum. Stenosis length is expressed as\na fraction of the diameter (D) of the undiseased CCA. Examples a\u00adc show length 1 and length 2 in different situations.

Outcome\nevents were independently adjudicated in the central trial office\nby two investigators (J. E., LHB), blinded to the treatment. In case\nof disagreement, the principal investigator (M. M. B.) made the\nfinal adjudication.\nStatistical analysis\nPatients were compared by the randomly allocated treatment\n(intention to treat). Receiver operator curves (ROC) were used to\nselect the definition of length of stenosis (see above) which best\npredicted the safety end-point, and to define threshold values to\ndichotomize length and degree of stenosis for further analysis, at\nthe point where sensitivity equalled specificity.\nWithin each treatment arm, the associations of degree and\nlength of stenosis and plaque irregularity with the safety end-\npoint were assessed on the univariate level with chi-square statis-\ntics; and on the multivariate level using binary logistic regression\nmodels. Cox regression was used to investigate the association\nbetween the three anatomical parameters and recurrent ipsilateral\nstroke. Impact on restenosis was tested using interval-censored\ngeneralized nonlinear models, as detailed previously (9). Formal\ntesting for subgroup-treatment effect interactions was performed\nfor each anatomical parameter and each end-point, by including\na multiplicative interaction term in the binary logistic regression\nand the Cox regression models. Significant associations on the\nunivariate level and interactions were adjusted for all anatomical\nparameters as well as age, sex, and baseline vascular risk factors\n(diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, history\nof peripheral artery, and coronary heart disease).

The study protocol defined\nDSA as the method of choice for baseline carotid imaging, allow-\ning for a detailed analysis of anatomical aspects of carotid stenosis\nprior to randomization. In more recent trials, only patients\nundergoing endovascular treatment had DSA examination of\ncarotid stenosis as part of the stent procedure. Furthermore,\nfollow-up was performed for up to 11 years after treatment and\nincluded regular examination by carotid ultrasound for the first\ntime in a large trial of symptomatic carotid stenosis. This enabled\nus to investigate the relationship between anatomical parameters\nof carotid stenosis and long-term durability of EVT and CEA in\nterms of prevention of recurrent stroke and restenosis.\nThe length of stenosis was first identified as a risk factor in\ncoronary artery stenting (12). Subsequently, two open cohort\nstudies identified length of stenosis as a predictor of stroke in\ncarotid artery stenting (3,7). In an analysis of preprocedural DSA\nin the stenting arm of the Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in\nPatients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis trial, the asso-\nciation between length of stenosis, dichotomized at 10 mm, and\nrisk of peri-procedural death or stroke was not significant (6).\nLength of stenosis in these studies was defined as the distance\nbetween the proximal and the distal shoulder of the atheromatous\nlesion. In the present study, we propose a new definition for\nmeasuring length of stenosis which is independent from the pres-\nence of definite lesion shoulders and which might be better suited\nto assess lesion length in the carotid bifurcation. In addition, we\ndid an ROC analysis to determine the ideal threshold length of\nstenosis to predict complications. Our findings confirmed length\nof stenosis as a strong and independent risk factor for peri-\nprocedural stroke or death in EVT. Patients with long stenosis\nmay be at increased risk of embolism during EVT because of an\nincreased likelihood of dislodging atherosclerotic debris or\nthrombus with larger plaque surface.\nTo date, research on anatomical risk factors in endarterectomy\nhas focused on degree of carotid stenosis and plaque irregularity\nbut did not investigate the significance of length of stenosis. The\npresent study demonstrated for the first time that increasing\nlength of stenosis leads to a very similar increase in treatment risk\nin CEA as in EVT. The mechanism for this increase in surgical risk\nremains unclear; it is conceivable that the larger carotid incision\nrequired in patients with long stenosis leads to increased activa-\ntion of the coagulation system and thus a higher risk for thrombo-\nembolic stroke. As the risk increase for peri-procedural stroke or\ndeath is very similar in both treatments, length of stenosis is\nunlikely to help decide between the endovascular and the surgical\napproach in a patient in whom invasive revascularization is\ndeemed necessary. However, length of stenosis \u00ad unlike degree of\nstenosis \u00ad appears to be a strong determinant of treatment risk and\nmay thus help decide between invasive and conservative treatment\nin patients in whom the benefit of revascularization is uncertain.\nThis question needs to be investigated in trials comparing conser-\nvative treatment versus revascularization by stenting or surgery in\npatients with low-to-intermediate risk carotid stenosis,such as the\n2nd European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST-2).\nWe previously reported a higher long-term risk of restenosis\nafter EVT compared with CEA in CAVATAS (9). In the present\nanalysis, increased length of stenosis at baseline independently\npredicted residual or recurrent carotid stenosis after EVT. A pos-\nsible explanation for this finding is that mechanisms leading to\nresidual or recurrent stenosis in EVT, such as elastic recoil of the\nartery wall, wall hematoma following injury of the intima, and\nneointimal hyperplasia, may be more pronounced if a longer\nlesion is treated endovascularly. In contrast, length of stenosis did\nnot predict restenosis in patients treated with CEA. Length of\nstenosis thus helps identify patients at increased risk of restenosis\nwith EVT who may benefit from prolonged ultrasound follow-up.\nHowever, the results warrant confirmation in modern trials using\nprimary carotid stenting, where rates of severe restenosis have\nbeen reported to be much lower than in CAVATAS (16,17).\nOur findings that the degree of stenosis was not associated with\nprocedural risk of EVT or CEA were in accordance with previous\ncase series and clinical trials (3\u00ad7,18). A meta-analysis of CEA\ntrials identified plaque irregularity as an independent risk factor\nfor surgical complications (5), a finding which we could not\nconfirm.\nOur study has important limitations. First, the majority of\npatients in the EVT arm were treated with balloon angioplasty\nalone, without use of stents. Since the time of recruitment in\nCAVATAS, primary stenting has replaced balloon angioplasty as\nthe endovascular treatment technique of choice, potentially lim-\niting the external validity of our findings. The limited number of\npatients in whom stents were inserted in CAVATAS (n = 51 were\nincluded in the present analysis) did not allow for investigation of\nthe influence of the assessed anatomical parameters in carotid\nartery stenting. However, the observed association of length of\nstenosis and risk of EVT was consistent with findings from open\nregistries of primary stenting. Our results need confirmation in\nrecent and ongoing trials of carotid revascularization including\ncarotid stenting. Second, the study may have been underpowered\nto detect interactions of stenosis morphology with treatment\nregarding recurrent stroke. Third, a single rater reviewed all films,\nand we therefore cannot provide data on interrater reliability of\nthe measurements. However, because determination of length of\nstenosis is based on objective measurement, we would expect the\nresults to be reproducible. Nevertheless, in order to generalize our\nfindings to current clinical practice, the method needs validation\nespecially in noninvasive angiography, which has now largely\nreplaced intraarterial angiography in the diagnostic workup of\ncarotid stenosis.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated for the first time that\nincreasing length of stenosis increased the procedural risk of both\nEVT and CEA, to a similar degree. Patients with longer stenosis\nwere at higher risk of restenosis after EVT, but length of stenosis\nwas not associated with recurrent ipsilateral stroke. The results of\nour study therefore do not favor one treatment as a better choice\nover the other in patients with long carotid stenosis. Further\nresearch is warranted to investigate whether improved anti-\nResearch\nL. H.

To confirm\nour findings, and to examine whether the results can be repro-\nduced with noninvasive magnetic resonance or computed\ntomography-based imaging techniques, the association between\nlength of stenosis and procedural risk, recurrent stroke, and res-\ntenosis should be investigated in recent and ongoing trials of\ncarotid revascularization.\n"
