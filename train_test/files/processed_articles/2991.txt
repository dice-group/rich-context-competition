National\ndata on how the mix of patients and services differ across sites are needed.\nObjective To develop and contrast national profiles of patient and service mix for\nprimary care.\nDesign, Setting, and Patients Comparative analyses of 3 national surveys of pri-\nmary care visits occurring in 1994: for data on physician's office visits, the National\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS); for hospital outpatient department data,\nthe National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survery (NHAMCS); and for data on\ncommunity health centers, the Bureau of Primary Health Care's 1994 Survey of Visits\nto Community Health Centers. A time trend analysis also was conducted using the\nMain Outcome Measures National estimates of primary care visit rates, types of\npatient presentation, patient case-mix, disposition of patients, and management in-\nResults The US population made 1.3 primary care visits per person in 1994, which ac-\ncounted for 43.5% of all ambulatory visits to physicians' offices, community health cen-\nters, and hospital outpatient departments. Primary care visits per person were 20% lower\nfor Hispanics and 33% lower for black, non-Hispanic persons compared with white, non-\nHispanic persons. Visits to community health centers were more likely to be made by eth-\nnic minorities, patients with Medicaid or no insurance, and rural dwellers than visits made\nto the other delivery sites. Visits at hospital outpatient departments were made by sicker\npopulations and were characterized by less continuity than the other delivery sites. Con-\ntrolling for patient mix, visits made to hospital outpatient departments were more com-\nmonly associated with imaging studies, minor surgery, and specialty referrals than those\nmade to physicians' offices. In 1998, the US population made an estimated 3.4 visits per\nperson, 45.6% of which were primary care visits. National estimates of primary care visit\nrates and patient mix and practice pattern comparisons between hospital outpatient de-\nConclusions Expanding community health centers will likely improve access to pri-\nmary care for vulnerable US populations. However, enhancing access to of physicians'\noffices is also needed to bolster the safety net. The greater service intensity and poorer\ncontinuity for primary care visits in hospital outpatient departments that we observed\nraises concern about the suitability of these clinics as primary care delivery sites.\ntrast national profiles of patient and ser-\nvice mix for primary care visits made to\ncommunityhealthcenters,hospitalout-\npatient departments, and physicians'\nNationalCenterforHealthStatisticssur-\nveys,8,9 wealsoassesshowtheseprofiles\nhave changed over time.\nMETHODS\nData Sources\nVisit data from physicians' offices were\nobtained from the National Ambula-\ntory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS).5\nThis survey's target universe included\nvisits made to nonfederally employed,\noffice-based physicians in the United\nStates; hospital outpatient depart-\nments were excluded. Selected physi-\ncians completed questionnaires for a\nsystematic sample of patient visits made\nduring 1 week.\nlatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)\nwas used for visits to hospital outpa-\ntient departments.6 This survey's target\nuniverse included visits made to outpa-\ntient departments of nonfederal, short-\nstay hospitals. Using patient records,\nhospital staff completed question-\nnaires for a random sample of visits that\noccurred during a randomly assigned\n4-week reporting period. We excluded\nvisits made to emergency departments\nfrom the sample.\nNHAMCS survey method (as described\nabove) for a probability sample of visits\nmadetocommunityhealthcenters.7 The\ntarget universe included visits to com-\nmunity health centers, including all of\ntheir delivery sites that received funds\nthrough the BPHC grant program un-\nder Section 330 of the Public Health Ser-\nters in operation fewer than 2 years were\nexcluded from the sampling frame.\nAdditional details of the surveys'\nmethods are available elsewhere.5-7 The\nresponse rates for in-scope physicians or\nclinics were 95% for hospital outpa-\ntient departments, 100% for commu-\nnity health centers, and 70% for physi-\ncians' offices. For the items in this study,\nthe survey instruments from all 3 data\nsources used the same questions, which\nwere listed in the same order.\ntrend analysis. Because physicians prac-\nticingincommunityhealthcenterswere\nin-scope for the NAMCS, these 2 data\nsources provided similar national esti-\nsponse rates for in-scope physicians or\ncians' offices and 98% for hospital out-\npatient departments.\nPrimary Care Visit Samples\nSeveral exclusion criteria were ap-\nplied to the data sets to obtain samples\nof primary care visits. In the NAMCS\ndata sets, we selected visits made to gen-\neral pediatricians, family physicians,\ngeneral internists, and obstetricians/\ngynecologists; in the NHAMCS data\nsets, visits to medical, obstetric, and pe-\ndiatric clinics were selected; and in the\nBPHC data set, we selected all visits\nbecause community health centers are\norganized to deliver primary care.\nWe removed visits made to special-\nists or specialized clinics falsely identi-\nfied as generalists or general clinics\nbecause self-designated specialty infor-\nmation can overestimate the number\nof generalist physicians.10 Physicians\nin the NAMCS data set who did not\nprovide any preventive care (defined\nby reasons for encounter and diagno-\nsis codes) were excluded; similarly,\nclinics in the NHAMCS data set that\ndid not provide preventive care during\nat least 10% of their visits were\nexcluded. Physicians and clinics that\nrecorded at least 20 visits and gave\ndiagnosis codes in the same clinical\narea (cardiology, endocrinology, etc)\nfor greater than 50% of these visits\nalso were excluded from the sample.\nApplying these exclusion criteria\nyielded unweighted sample sizes for\ntotal) primary care visits made to 48\ntotal) made to 162 hospital outpatient\ndepartments.

Specific items\nfrom each survey allowed further clas-\nsification of patient presentation by new\nvs established patients; among new pa-\ntients, those referred by another phy-\nsician; and among established pa-\ntients, those presenting with new health\nproblems. (These items were not avail-\ncentages of established patients pre-\nsenting with new problems suggest\nbetter continuity of care.11\nThe case-mix index was based on the\nJohns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical\nGroups (ACG) Case-Mix system.12 The\nACG system assigns all International\nClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-\nsion, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-\ngroups, or diagnostic groups called\nADGs. In all surveys, up to 3 ICD-\n9-CM codes were recorded for each\nvisit; thus, each visit could be as-\nsigned up to 3 unique ADGs. The case-\nmix index was the sum of ADG-\nspecific resource intensity weights. The\nweights were obtained from ADG  co-\nefficients derived from regression analy-\nses done for 4 large commercial health\nplans in which total patient charges\nwere regressed on the 32 ADGs. (De-\ntails of this method, including the spe-\ncific weights used, are available from the\nauthors.) To simplify interpretation of\nthe case-mix index, raw scores were\nfor the combined sample. Higher case-\nmix index scores indicate greater medi-\ncal complexity, sicker patients, and\nhigher expected resource use.\nTo assess visit intensity, we pre-\ndicted the duration of each visit based\non the age and sex of the patient, type\nof patient presentation, case-mix in-\ndex, and diagnosis codes.

Among established pa-\ntients, the odds that primary care vis-\nits were for new health problems were\nsignificantly higher in community\nhealth centers compared with physi-\ncians' offices and hospital outpatient de-\npartments. A greater proportion of pri-\nmary care visits made to hospital\noutpatient departments were for new\npatients, many of whom were physi-\ncian-referred, than those made to phy-\nsicians' offices.\nThecase-mixindexofpatientvisitswas\n2.8% higher, suggesting a sicker patient\npopulation,inhospitaloutpatientdepart-\nments than physicians' offices and was\nsimilarbetweencommunityhealthcen-\ntersandphysicians'offices(Table3).The\ncase-mix of primary care visits made by\nthe elderly population to the 3 types of\ndelivery sites was similar, whereas the\ncase-mix index for primary care visits\nmade by children and adolescents was\n1.7% higher in community health cen-\nters and 4.7% higher in hospital outpa-\ntientdepartmentsthanphysicians'offices.\nVisit intensity is a measure of the pre-\ndicteddurationofthevisitbasedonclini-\ncal characteristics of the patient and the\ntype of patient presentation.

However, about 40% of\nprimary care visits for ethnic minori-\nties with either no insurance or Medic-\naid were made to traditional safety-net\ndelivery sites, suchas communityhealth\ncenters and hospital outpatient depart-\nments. This finding demonstrates the\nimportance of examining the impact of\nmultiple vulnerable characteristics in\nstudies on access and service use.\nSeveral caveats should be considered\nwhen interpreting this study's data on\nprimary care visit rates. Some safety-\nnet delivery sites were not included. The\nVeterans Affairs and Indian Health Ser-\nvicenetworkofprimarycareclinicswere\nnot part of our combined database. Ex-\nclusion of these federal delivery sites is\nlikelytohaveasmallimpactonvisitrates\nestimates: it has been estimated that Vet-\nerans Affairs clinics provide services to\nabout 1.7 million low-income veter-\nans.17 Althoughlocallyfundedhealthde-\npartments were not explicitly evaluated\nin this study, physicians in these deliv-\nery sites were in the sampling frame of\nthe NAMCS, and visits to them were cat-\negorized in the physicians' offices group.\nSecond, the sampling frame of the\nNAMCS survey of physicians' offices ex-\ncluded nurse practitioners and physi-\ncian assistants, who are becoming in-\ncreasingly important in the provision of\nprimary care.18 Third, we used algo-\nrithms to identify primary care provid-\ners in the 3 surveys and then classified\nall visits to these physicians and clinics\nas primary care. Our methods may have\noverestimated the number of primary\ncare visits to the extent that generalist\nphysicians and obstetrician/gynecolo-\ngists deliver some specialty care ser-\nvices.

Fourth, dif-\nferences in survey administration be-\ntween the NAMCS (physicians com-\npleted the questionnaires) vs the other\n2 surveys (medical record abstraction)\ncould affect the diagnosis coding and\nthus the morbidity assessments. Analy-\nsis of the ICD codes recorded for each\nvisit revealed no significant differences\nin the mean numbers or the percent-\nages with more than 1 code among the\n3 delivery sites.\nPrimary Care Visits\nin Community Health Centers\nContinuity of care, one of the hallmark\nfeatures of primary care,11 was better in\ncommunityhealthcentersthanotherde-\nlivery sites. Established patients at com-\nmunity health centers were more likely\nto present with new health problems\ncompared with the other delivery sites.\nBetter continuity of care allows practi-\ntionerstousemorewatchfulwaitingand\nemploy health care resources more ju-\ndiciously, an association that helps ex-\nplain the lower likelihood of pre-\nscribedmedicationsduringprimarycare\nvisits to community health centers.\nThe medical complexity and patient\nmanagement of primary care visits in\ncommunity health centers compared fa-\nvorably with physicians' offices. None\nof the measures in this study, however,\nassessed the social complexity of pa-\ntients, which should be greater in com-\nmunity health centers because of their\nhigher burden of low-income patients.\nThe impact of patients' social risk on the\noverall complexity and resultant re-\nsource intensity of primary care visits is\nlikely to have a positive effect.\nPhysicians working in community\nhealthcentersweretheoreticallyin-scope\nintheNAMCS.Tocalculateprimarycare\nvisitrates,wesubtractedthecountofvis-\nitstocommunityhealthcentersfromthe\ncount of visits for physicians' offices.\nHowever, for the comparative analyses\nof patient mix and service use, no such\nadjustmentwasmade.Thebiasthatmay\nresult from this overlap in sampling\nframesislikelytobenegligiblebecause\nthe number of community health cen-\nter visits possibly included in the phy-\nsicians' office sample was very small.\nPrimary Care Visits in Hospital\nOutpatient Departments\nThe medical complexity of patient vis-\nits in hospital outpatient departments\nwas greater than those made to other\ndelivery sites.

Hospi-\ntal outpatient department visits were\nmore likely than visits to physicians' of-\nfices to be associated with a specialty\nreferral, minor surgery, and imaging\nstudies.

Furthermore, the poorer\ncontinuity of care among visits to hos-\npital outpatient departments may con-\ntribute to a more aggressive practice\nstyle, because of less familiarity with pa-\ntients' health histories. Greater ser-\nvice intensity and poorer continuity of\ncare in hospital outpatient clinics com-\npared with other delivery sites also raise\nthe concern over the suitability of these\nclinics as primary care delivery sites.\nHowever, until studies are done that\ncompare health outcomes across deliv-\nery sites, we can make no conclusions\nabout which service use rate is best.\nPolicy Implications\nThe main findings from this study are\napplicability of these data for current\npolicy decisions, we conducted sensitiv-\nfindings showed remarkable similarity\ngesting that our primary care visit analy-\nses are applicable to current health care\npolicy.

An important implication of these\nfindings is that federal policy that af-\nfects the financing or organization of\ncommunity health centers will have its\ngreatest impact on access for these vul-\nnerable subpopulations.\nThis study documented large in-\nequalities between ethnic minorities\nand whites in primary care visit rates.\nCompared with the white population,\nthe Hispanic population made 20%\nfewer primary care visits per person and\nthe black, non-Hispanic population\nmade 33% fewer primary care visits per\nperson.
