For instance, in Canada, obese individuals make up\n23% of the adult population3 whereas 54% of the knee\nreplacement procedures are performed in obese individuals.4\nCurrent obesity evaluation guidelines are that a combina-\ntion of BMI and waist circumference (WC) be used to\ndetermine obesity-associated health risk.5,6 That is, for a\ngiven BMI category (normal weight, overweight or obese),\nindividuals with a high WC (X102 cm in men; X88 cm in\nwomen) are considered to have a greater relative health risk\nthan individuals with a normal WC. These guidelines are\nbased on a growing body of evidence indicating that\nabdominal obesity, as determined by WC, provides addi-\ntional information on the risk for metabolic-related diseases\n(type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, etc.) than is\nobtained from BMI alone. In fact, research indicates that\nWC is a stronger marker of metabolic health risk than BMI.7,8\nFurther research is required to determine if WC has a similar\neffect on the vast array of other obesity-related health\nproblems, such as osteoarthritis.\nA limited number of studies have considered the relation\nbetween overall and abdominal obesity with osteoarthritis,\nand the results of these studies are conflicting. In a study\nof 1003 middle-aged women, Hart and Spector9 found that\nCorrespondence: Dr I Janssen, School of Physical and Health Education,\nQueen's University, 69 Union Street, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6.\nE-mail: janssen@post.queensu.ca\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nBMI was a powerful predictor of osteoarthritis in a number of\njoints, but that WC did not increase the predictive ability of\nosteoarthritis after accounting for BMI. Similarly, in a sample\nreported a strong association of both BMI and WC with\nknee osteoarthritis; however, WC was no longer a significant\npredictor of knee osteoarthritis after adjusting for BMI.\nConversely, in another study based on the same cohort of\nwomen, Hochberg et al.11 reported that although waist-to-\nhip circumference ratio was a significant predictor of hand\nosteoarthritis, BMI was not, suggesting that WC is a better\nmarker of osteoarthritis risk than BMI. To add even more\nconfusion, Davis et al.12 reported that neither BMI nor WC\nwas associated with osteoarthritis in the hands and feet in a\nrepresentative sample of American men and women from\nassociated with hand osteoarthritis. More studies are needed\nto clarify the independent and combined effects of BMI and\nWC on arthritis and osteoarthritis risk.\nThe aim of the current study was to examine the relation\nbetween BMI and WC with arthritis in a large representative\npopulation of men and women. Our specific objective was to\ndetermine if the combination of WC and BMI explains an\nadditional component of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis risk\nthan is predicted by either anthropometric measure alone.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nNHANES III was conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics in the United States to estimate the\nprevalence of major diseases, nutritional disorders and risk\nfactors for these diseases.13 NHANES III was a nationally\nrepresentative, two-phase, 6-year cross-sectional survey\nstratified, multistage, probability cluster design. The total\nindividuals were adults who completed both the home and\nmobile examination center components of the survey that\nwere required for our analysis. Full details of the study design\nand procedures are available elsewhere.13 Informed consent\nwas obtained from all the participants, and the protocol was\napproved by the National Center for Health Statistics.\nAlthough more recent NHANES surveys have been con-\nosteoarthritis measurements that were required for the\npresent study.\nWe excluded those who were o20 years of age, pregnant\nwomen and subjects without height, weight, WC or arthritis\nfor analyses of arthritis in the current study. Because the\nknee osteoarthritis measurements were obtained only in the\nyears and above, the knee osteoarthritis outcome was limited\nStudy methods\nBody mass index and waist circumference. Body weight and\nheight were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm,\nrespectively, using standardized equipment and proce-\ndures.13,14 Body mass index was subsequently determined\nas weight/height2 (kg/m2). The WC measurement was made\nto the nearest 0.1 cm at minimal respiration at the level of\nthe iliac crest.13 Categories of BMI and WC were created\nusing gender-specific tertiles.\nArthritis. Presence of arthritis was determined by a positive\nresponse to the question `Has your doctor ever told you that\nyou have arthritis?' Analysis by arthritis type (osteoarthritis,\nrheumatoid arthritis) could not be performed because a large\npercentage (57%) of the subjects with arthritis did not know\nor did not report what type of arthritis they had. Of those\nwho reported the type of arthritis, 56% had osteoarthritis.\nKnee osteoarthritis. Knee osteoarthritis was diagnosed by\nknee radiographs performed in the mobile examination\ncenter. Trained radiologists examined each of the non-\nweight-bearing anteroposterior knee radiographs (knee in\nextended position) for evidence of knee osteoarthritis. The\nKellgren\u00adLawrence atlas for knee osteoarthritis was used to\ndetermine the presence of osteoarthritis in the joint.15 A\nscore of grade 2 or higher on Kellgren\u00adLawrence scale, which\nis defined as definite presence of osteophytes, confirmed the\npresence of osteoarthritis in the knee.15,16\nStatistical analysis\nIn the initial set of analyses, logistic regression was used to\nexamine the independent and combined influence of\ncontinuous BMI and WC measures on arthritis and knee\nosteoarthritis. For this analysis, the odds ratios (OR) were\ncomputed for each gender-specific standard deviation\nchange in BMI and WC.\nThe next set of analyses considered the association of BMI\nalone and WC alone with arthritis and knee osteoarthritis\nusing a categorical approach for BMI and WC. This\ncategorical approach was employed because BMI and WC\nare not used as continuous variables in the clinical setting. In\nthese analyses, logistic regression models were used to\nexamine the associations of BMI tertiles and WC tertiles\nwith arthritis and knee osteoarthritis. The lowest BMI tertile\nand lowest WC tertile were used as the reference groups.\nThe final set of analyses considered the combined\ninfluence of BMI and WC on arthritis and knee osteoarthritis\nusing a categorical approach for BMI and WC. Subjects were\ninitially divided into the three BMI tertiles. Within each BMI\ntertile, logistic regression analysis was used to examine the\nassociation of WC tertiles (which were specific for each BMI\ntertile) with arthritis and knee osteoarthritis. Subjects were\nthen divided into the three WC tertiles, and within each WC\ntertile logistic regression analysis was used to examine the\nBMI, waist circumference and arthritis\nI Janssen and AE Mark\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nassociation of BMI tertiles (which were specific for each WC\ntertile) with arthritis and knee osteoarthritis.\nAll OR were adjusted for age, race and sex (except sex-\nspecific models). The Intercooled Stata 7 program (Stata\nCorporation, College Station, TX, USA) was used to weight\nthe sample to be representative of the population, and to\ntake into account the NHANES III sampling strategy.\nResults\nThe descriptive characteristics are shown in Table 1. Fourteen\npercent of the men and 22% of the women included in the\nsurvey reported having arthritis. Of the older men and\nwomen who underwent the radiograph exam, approxi-\nmately 43 and 50%, respectively, were diagnosed as having\nknee osteoarthritis.\nThe results of the logistic regression analyses in which BMI\nalone, WC alone or both BMI and WC were used as\ncontinuous variables to predict arthritis and knee osteo-\narthritis are shown in Table 2. The OR were computed for\neach sex-specific 1-SD change in the BMI and WC values. For\nexample, for each 1-SD increase in BMI in women, the odds\nof knee osteoarthritis increased by 2.62-fold, whereas for\neach 1-SD increase in WC, the odds of knee osteoarthritis\nincreased by 2.23-fold. Without exception, when BMI and\nWC were examined individually, they were strong positive\npredictors of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis, and the OR for\nBMI and WC were comparable in magnitude. When both\nBMI and WC were included in the same regression mode,\nWC alone was an independent predictor of arthritis, whereas\nBMI alone was an independent predictor of knee osteo-\narthritis.\nResults of the logistic regression showing the OR for\narthritis and knee osteoarthritis, according to BMI tertiles,\nare shown in Table 3. The corresponding OR for the WC\ntertiles are shown in Table 4. Independent of sex, the\nlikelihood of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis increased in a\ngraded fashion when moving from the lowest to highest BMI\ntertile. Similarly, the likelihood of arthritis and knee\nosteoarthritis increased in a graded fashion when moving\nfrom the lowest to highest WC tertile within both men and\nwomen. For example, in men, the highest BMI tertile was\n3.13 times more likely to have knee osteoarthritis compared\nto the lowest BMI tertile, whereas the highest WC tertile was\n2.91 times more likely to have knee osteoarthritis compared\nto the lowest WC tertile.\nIn the next phase of analysis, subjects were divided into\nWC tertiles within each of the BMI tertiles (Table 5). Owing to\nsmaller number of subjects within these BMI \u00c2 WC groups,\nsex-specific analysis could not be performed. Within the\nlowest BMI tertile, the odds of arthritis and knee osteo-\narthritis were not different in the lowest, middle and highest\nWC tertiles. Within the middle BMI tertile, the middle and\nhigh WC tertiles were more likely to have arthritis and knee\nosteoarthritis compared to the lowest WC tertile (P \u00bc 0.06 for\narthritis in high WC tertile). Within the highest BMI tertile,\nTable 1 Descriptive characteristics\nAll Men Women\nData for age, body mass index and waist circumference presented as\nmean7standard deviation.\nTable 2 Odds ratios for arthritis and knee osteoarthritis according to continuous measures of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), considered\neither alone or in the same regression model\nBMI alone WC alone BMI and WC\nBMI (controlled for WC) WC (controlled for BMI)\nAll\nMen\nWomen\nData are presented as odds ratios (95% confidence intervals).

When both BMI and WC were used as continuous\nvariables to predict arthritis and knee osteoarthritis, BMI and\nWC did not have independent effects on either arthritis or\nknee osteoarthritis (Table 2). That is, when both of these\nanthropometric variables were included in the same regres-\nsion model, either one or the other predicted arthritis, and\nonce one of the variables entered into the regression model\nthe other fell out of the model and no longer predicted\narthritis or knee osteoarthritis. This finding is consistent\nwith that of previous studies, which found that WC did not\nadd to the predictive ability of continuous BMI measures\nwhen predicting osteoarthritis risk.9,10\nIn the clinical setting, BMI and WC are categorized using a\nthreshold approach. The correlation between continuous\nBMI and WC values is quite high; however, when BMI and\nWC are categorized, the strength of the relation between\nthem is reduced.17 Therefore, BMI and WC are more likely\nto have independent effects on arthritis when a clinical\napproach is used because of the reduced covariance. Indeed,\nwhen a classification system (tertiles) was used in this study,\nBMI and WC were independent predictors of arthritis and\nknee osteoarthritis. That is, within the middle- and high-BMI\ncategories, individuals in the higher WC category were more\nlikely to have arthritis and/or knee osteoarthritis than\nindividuals in the lowest WC category. Similarly, BMI had\neffects beyond that of WC alone. Thus, within the middle\nand highest WC categories, individuals in the highest BMI\ncategory were more likely to have arthritis and/or knee\nosteoarthritis than individuals in the lowest BMI category. It\nis noteworthy that these associations were significant after\nadjusting for the potential confounding effect of age, race\nand sex. These observations indicate that BMI and WC have\nindependent effects on arthritis when they are categorized,\nas in the clinical setting, and thus it is important for\nclinicians and health-care practitioners to obtain measures of\nboth BMI and WC.\nThe finding that adults with high WC values are at\nincreased arthritis and osteoarthritis risk, independent of\nBMI category, is entirely consistent with a large body of\nevidence that has examined the combined influence of BMI\nand WC on metabolic health risk and disease. Previously,\nwithin the NHANES III cohort, it was demonstrated that\nwithin normal weight, overweight and obese BMI categories,\nthose with high WC values are more likely to have\nhypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and the metabolic\nsyndrome, compared to those with normal WC values.18\nSimilar findings have been reported in a large and represen-\ntative sample of Canadians.19 In addition to metabolic\ndisorders, Wonnamethee et al.20 recently reported that the\nnegative relationship between WC and measures of lung\nfunction remained significant after adjustment for BMI in a\nreported that the influence of WC on functional limitation\nand disability risk in older adults remains significant after\nadjustment for BMI. When combined, these results support\nthe recommendation that measures of WC be added to\nmeasures of BMI in the clinical evaluation of overweight and\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that causes ex-\ncessive breakdown, loss of articular cartilage and destruction\nof the periarticular bone. The etiology of osteoarthritis\ninvolves local biomechanical factors, systemic biochemical\nfactors, as well as susceptibility that is related to age and\ngenetics.1,22 Excessive weight places a higher than normal\nbiomechanical load on the hip and knee joint during\nactivity, which is a likely mechanism by which total and\nabdominal obesity is related to osteoarthritis.1 Obesity may\nalso be related to osteoarthritis via the increased release of\nhormones, growth factors and cytokines from adipose tissue\nthat may play a subtle role in osteoarthritis.2 The weak\nassociation between obesity and osteoarthritis of non-\nweight-bearing joints in the hands and fingers is evidence\nof this pathway.11 It has been shown that BMI and WC are\nrelated to total fat mass in a similar order of magnitude, and\nthat for a given BMI category, total fat mass is higher in those\nwith a high WC than in those with a low WC.23 This finding\nis consistent with the observation of the present study that\nTable 6 Odds ratios for arthritis and knee osteoarthritis according to tertiles of body mass index (BMI) within waist circumference (WC) tertiles\nWC tertile BMI tertiles (within WC tertiles)\nData presented as odds ratios (95% confidence intervals). Adjusted for age, race and sex. aSignificantly higher than tertile 1 (Po0.05).\nBMI, waist circumference and arthritis\nI Janssen and AE Mark\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nBMI and WC were related to osteoarthritis in a similar order\nof magnitude, and that osteoarthritis risk was higher in those\nwith a high WC than in those with a low WC for a given BMI\ntertile. Taken together, these results suggest that overall\nadiposity, rather than a specific fat depot, is the mechanistic\nlink between BMI, WC and osteoarthritis.\nThis study has notable strengths, specifically the large and\nrepresentative sample that was examined and the considera-\ntion of both arthritis (questionnaire) and knee osteoarthritis\n(radiograph) as study outcomes. However, because this was a\ncross-sectional study, we cannot infer causality about the\ntemporal nature of the relation between BMI, WC and\narthritis. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the\nfindings reported here. Further, there is likely a long lag\nperiod between the onset of a high BMI and/or WC and the\nonset of arthritis. For example, one study reported that BMI\nmeasurements at age 20\u00ad29 years were strongly associated\nwith knee osteoarthritis 36 years later.24 This suggests the\nstrength of relationships between BMI, WC and arthritis may\nhave been underestimated in the present cross-sectional\nstudy.\nIn conclusion, both BMI and WC were strong predictors of\narthritis and knee osteoarthritis in this large representative\nsample of American adults. When both BMI and WC were\nused as continuous variables to predict arthritis and knee\nosteoarthritis, they did not have independent effects on\neither arthritis or knee osteoarthritis. However, when a\ncategorical approach was used for BMI and WC, similar to that\nin the clinical setting, independent effects of these anthro-\npometric exposure variables were observed on the arthritis\noutcomes. In the light of these findings and previous\nfindings based on other obesity-related outcomes, we\nrecommend that health-care practitioners measure WC in\nconjunction with BMI.\n"
