This is interesting in the\ncontext of the literature on the transmission of technical/managerial knowledge and productivity\n\"spillovers\" between countries and whether trade or investment is a more important channel of\nIn the latter vein of literature, several different ideas for the micro-foundations of the\ntransmission mechanism have been proposed or modeled. Theoretical models have looked at\nlinkages as a source of productivity spillover, so that upstream and/or downstream firms benefit\nfrom the arrival of multinationals (Markusen and Venables, 1999). This has generally been in\nthe form of variety effects from supporting an increased number of intermediate or final goods.\nA second stream of theoretical analysis looks at workers or local firms learning from watching or\nworking for foreign firms with a resulting increase in their productivity (Fosfuri, Motta, and\nwork in search of spillovers to local firms include Blomstr\u00f6m and Kokko (1998), Blomstr\u00f6m and\nand Spatareanu (2003). Other empirical literature has documented that local firms and their\nmanagers often get their start as employees of multinational firms (Katz 1987, Hobday 1995,\nVery little in this literature is directed at modeling the precise micro-mechanism of how\nforeign skilled workers impart those skills to domestic workers. That then is the purpose of this\npaper. We focus on direct imports of the services of foreign experts as a method of both\nproviding an important good or service and for training domestic workers faster and/or cheaper\nthan they can learn on their own. We depart from the tradition of comparative steady-state\nanalysis used in new growth theory, since we want to explicitly consider timing issues rather\nthan merely steady-state levels and growth rates. For this reason, we use a very simple\ncompetitive constant-returns model with no spillovers, externalities, or other bells-and-whistles.\nThe economy lasts three periods and initially has no skilled workers who are needed to\nproduce a non-traded good X. Unskilled workers can withdraw from production (of good Y) for\ntwo periods and learn to be skilled workers through a self-learning process (\"reinventing the\nwheel) and become skilled workers in period three.\nInstead of relying on learning by studying (LBS), the economy may import foreign\nexperts who have accumulated expertise from previous activities. Foreign experts can produce\ngood X working alone in any period. Alternatively, foreign experts can produce X in the\nfirst/second period and domestic unskilled labor working with them become skilled in the\nsecond/third period. We refer to this as learning by watching (LBW). In the latter event, in the\nsecond period these newly skilled domestic workers can produce X and can train additional\ndomestic workers for period 3. As in the case of foreign experts, domestic skilled workers may\nalso produce alone without training additional workers.\nWe solve for a perfect-foresight, competitive equilibrium, initially with the economy\nallowed to borrow subject to three-period trade balance constraint. A period-by-period trade-\nbalance constraint is considered in an appendix. There are nine possible training/production\nactivities, and the set of activities operating in equilibrium is referred to as the regime.\nAn important parameter in the model is the cost of foreign experts in terms of the\ncomposite other good Y produced by the economy. When this cost is very high, domestic\nworkers engage in LBS and no skilled workers and no X are available until period 3. At a\nsomewhat lower cost, foreign experts are used in period one only and then more domestic skilled\nworkers are trained in period 2 by the domestic workers trained by foreign experts in period 1.\nAt a yet lower cost, all training is by foreign experts. Finally, at a very low cost, it doesn't pay\nto train any one, and all production in all periods is done by the foreigners working alone.\nGains from trade are a combination of: more X, getting X earlier, cheaper training of\ndomestic workers, and getting domestic skilled workers earlier. X is available in period 1, and\ndomestic skilled workers are available in period 2 instead of both of these things occurring first\nin period 3 when experts are very costly.\nA second important parameter is the learning or \"absorptive\" capacity of the unskilled\nworkers. When this capacity is very low (and experts are moderately priced), experts do all the\nX production and no domestic workers engage in LBS or LBW. As this capacity grows, foreign\nexperts are used for fewer periods and switch from production only to production plus training.\nAt high levels of learning capacity, the economy also engages in LBS and no foreign experts are\nused past the first period.\nThe model and these results may be interesting in several empirical and policy contexts.\nFrom an empirical point of view, it may help interpret a number of findings including the fact\nthat managers of local firms in developing countries often get their start working for\nmultinationals. From a policy point of view, it suggests that foreigners are not substitutes for\nlocal skilled labor unless the former are very cheap and/or the latter rather stupid , and that\nbarriers to foreign firms and workers (e.g., visa, residence restrictions) may be costly.\n2 The three-period model\n(a) There are three time periods, t = 1,2,3\n(b) There are two goods, X and Y; both sectors competitive, constant returns to scale\n(c) There are four factors of production, R, L, F, and S\n(d) Y is produced from a sector-specific factor R, and unskilled labor L.\n(e) X is produced from imported experts F and/or skilled labor S and is non-traded.\n(f) The stock of R and the initial stock of L are fixed. Initially there are no S.\nLet subscript t denote time period. Yt\nis produced from Rt\n, and Lt\n:\nThe role of R is to add convexity to the model: unskilled workers going to train must be drawn\nfrom the Y sector at increasing cost in terms of Y.\nLet Lt\ndenote the stock of unskilled workers at t, and let Lst\ngive the unskilled workers\nentering training at t. There is one equation for the intra-period allocation of the unskilled\nworker stock and a second equation for the inter-period change in that stock.\nLet St\ndenote the stock of skilled workers at t, and let NSt\ndenote the newly skilled at t.\nSkilled workers are produced from unskilled workers L. There are two ways skilled workers can\nbe produced. First, an unskilled worker can go off and study for two period on his/her own and\nbecome skilled. Thus unskilled workers who withdraw from the labor force at t = 1, are skilled\nSelf-learning activity (4)\nThe second is to work with existing skilled workers. An unskilled worker who works alongside\na skilled worker in producing X becomes skilled in one time period rather than two. LBW is\nmore efficient than LBS.\nWhen permitted, foreign skilled workers, called foreign experts (or just experts), can also\nbe hired from abroad and paid for at a fixed rental price in terms of Y. When the economy is\nopen, foreign experts can be hired at t = 1,2,3. They can produce X working alone (as can\ndomestic skilled workers) or a domestic unskilled worker can work along side the expert (or\ndomestic skilled worker) and become skilled in one period. Thus trade offers both X\nconsumption earlier at t = 1 and allows domestic skilled workers to be produced more cheaply\nand earlier at t = 2. Both are only available at t = 3 in autarky.\nProduction only activities (5)\nProduction/training activities (foreigners) (6)\nProduction/training activities (domestic) (7)\nWe assume no skills depreciation and so the equation of motion for S is\nThere are nine activities relating to X and/or training over the three period (several\nactivities may be active at the same time). Codes to denote X production and/or training activity\nare give by a three-digit index: IJT.\nI = D, F D denotes a domestic activity using no foreign experts\nF is an activity involving foreign experts\n1Note that DS2 and DN2 can only be positive if FS1 is positive.\nJ = S, N S denotes an activity involving training skilled workers\nN denotes an activity without no training\nAll activities involve production of X except DT1, where domestic workers begin self-study for\ntwo period, and produce no X until T = 3.\n(A) domestic unskilled workers study alone, no production DS1\n(B) foreign experts working with unskilled\ndomestics who become skilled at t = 2.

When hiring foreigners is permitted, Y produced in any period\ncan be exchanged for consultants in any period at a fixed price. This gives an intertemporal\nbudget constrained allowing borrowing in early periods. Alternatively, the economy must pay\nfor the consultants with Y produced in the period in which the consultants are used.\nNotation is as follows:\n2Analogous to the price of a unit of capital, pli\nis the present value at t = i of a unit of unskilled\nlabor. pui\n, following line, is the single period rental price of unskilled labor at t = i.\nYi\n, pyi\nquantity and price of good Y at time t = i\nRi\n, pri\nquantity and price of Y-sector-specific factor R at time t = i\nLi\n, pli\nquantity and asset price (not rental price) of unskilled labor L at time t = i2\nUi\n, pui\nquantity and (rental) price of unskilled labor U at time t = i\nSi\n, psi\nquantity and (rental) price of skilled labor S at time t = i\nFi\n, pfi\nquantity and price of foreign experts F at time t = i\nEi\n, pei\nquantity and price of \"foreign exchange\" at time t = i\nXi\n, pxi\nquantity and price of good X at time t = i\nFactors Ri\nare fixed quantities. L2\nare variables, since labor available for\nunskilled work is reduced by the number of workers entering training. E is an artificial good: Y\ncan be exchanged (exported) for E and E can then be exchanged for imported foreign experts F.\nWith borrowing and lending allowed, E carries no subscript and thus exports of Y in any period\ncan be exchanged for foreign experts in any period (zero interest rate). With no borrowing or\nlending, Yi\nis exchanged for Ei\nwhich is exchanged for Fi\n.\nA key parameter in the model is cost, which is the number of units of Y that must be\nexchanged for one for expert. A second parameter is ac (\"absorptive capacity\"), which give the\nefficiency units of skilled labor resulting from the training of one unskilled worker. Higher\nlevels of cost are bad, higher levels of ac are good. The parameter cost will impact primarily on\nthe substitution between LBS and LBW, while the parameter ac will impact primarily on the\nsubstitution between using experts solely for production and using them (and the LBS activity)\n3cost and ac are exogenous to the economy. ac is reflecting an inherent ability to learn. Some of\nthe empirical articles referenced above essentially suggested that absorptive capacity is endogenous and\ndepends on existing skills and education. Endogenizing ac is beyond the scope of this paper, but we can\ncertainly think of it as being inherited from past choices in, for example, educational infrastructure.\nfor training as well.3\nConvexity in the model comes from the fixed factor R in the Y sector, which is assumed\nCobb-Douglas in the simulations: labor is drawn into training and X production at increasing\ncost in terms of Y, with cyi\n(pui\n, pri\n) denoting the unit cost function for Yi\n. In the X sector, units\nare chosen such that one domestic or foreign skilled worker produces one unit of X and, when\ntraining is involved, one unskilled worker works with one skilled worker (fixed coefficients) and\nthat unskilled worker becomes one skilled worker for all future time periods (no skills\ndepreciation).\nUtility or welfare is treated as a produced good. The flow of utility in period i and the\nprice of obtaining a unit of utility is\nWi\n, pwi\nquantity and price of welfare at t = i\nW, pw\nquantity and price of intertemporal utility\nThe price of utility in period i and overall are given by standard cost or unit expenditure\nfunctions, denoted cwi\n(pyi\n, pxi\n) and cw\n) respectively. A CES with an elasticity of\nsubstitution greater than one is assumed in these functions to ensure a solution with X1\nin autarky (a value of 3 is used in the simulations within and between periods).\nOne final assumption before presenting the equations of the model. The model has an\nimplicit contracting assumption in training/production activities, but it is incorrect to say that\nforeign experts capture rents. In competitive equilibrium, foreign experts earn their opportunity\ncost which is the constant, exogenous value of working at home. Workers going into self\n4Economic historian Ann Carlos tells us that the consensus in the apprenticeship literature is that\nthe apprentices were a losing proposition in early years but that the apprenticeship period ran about two\nlearning or training earn their opportunity cost which is being an unskilled worker for three\nperiods. \"Rents\" (gains from trade) from lower foreign experts' cost accrue to the domestic\nrepresentative consumer (all workers receive the three-period unskilled real wage, but that rises\nwith access to the foreign experts).\nAs defined earlier, pl1\ndenote the \"asset\" price of an unskilled worker in the first period;\nthat is, the three-period unskilled wage. Suppose that FS1 is active in equilibrium, earning zero\nprofits while FN1 (production only) is inactive in equilibrium, implying negative profits if it\nwere operated. The dual of (6) gives us that the costs of FS1 (unskilled worker price plus\nexpert's wage) equals revenue (second and third period unskilled wages plus the price of X),\nwhile the dual of (5) is unprofitable:\nTogether, these imply that\npositive rents from training, equals (10)\nexcess of foreign expert's wage over value of X output (11)\nThis can only be supported as an equilibrium if the competitive firms and workers can write\nbinding contracts at t = 1 which pays the worker the three-period unskilled wage, or by some\nother institutional arrangement such as bonding. To interpret it slightly differently, the unskilled\nworker could make a payment for training that leaves him with his opportunity costs, and this\npayment (when positive) allows an otherwise unprofitable production activity (X production\nonly, no training) to operate.4\nyears after the master broke even, during which time he recouped his loss. Often families paid masters to\ntake their sons, and legal institutions were developed to enforce the contract and return runaways to their\nmasters.\nThe general-equilibrium model is a non-linear complementarity problem in mathematical\nprogramming language: a set of inequalities each with an associated non-negative variable. If an\ninequality holds as an equation the complementary variable is generally positive, and the\ncomplementary variable is zero if the associated inequality holds as a strict inequality in\nequilibrium.\nThere are three classes of inequalities in the model. First, there is a zero-profit inequality\nfor each activity: unit cost must be greater than or equal to the price of the complementary good\nor factor. The complementary variables are activity levels, include production/training activities,\nlabor supply activities, and trading activities. Second, there is a set of market clearing conditions\nfor each good/factor, with prices as complementary variables. Third, there is an income balance\nor trade balance condition for the economy. For completeness, we present the entire list of\ninequalities and complementary variables in the next section. This can probably be skipped by\nreaders interested in going to the simulation results in sections 4 and 5.\n5Activities Ui\naccount for change in the unskilled labor stock as workers move into training and\nproduction.

The model is coded in Rutherford's\nMPS/GE, a subsystem of GAMS and solve using the non-linear complementarity solver in\n4 Results 1: varying the cost of foreign experts\nFigures 1-4 consider different levels of cost, solving the general-equilibrium model for\neach level. Figure 1 gives qualitative information on the equilibrium regime for differing levels\nof cost. That is, each row of the Figure gives a the general-equilibrium solution to the model for\nthe range of cost shown in the first column.\nThe first row of Figure 1 is autarky, cost so high that the economy uses no foreigners. In\nthis case, the self-training activity is the only one that operates and no skilled workers and no X\nare available until t = 3. At a somewhat lower, but still high, level of cost, activity FS1 becomes\nactive, so foreign experts are used sparingly for only period only in the production/training\nactivity (so this corresponds to (9)-(11) above). The newly-skilled domestic workers at t = 2\ntrain more domestic workers at t= 2: DS2 is active.\nAs we go to progressively lower levels of cost, self-training is not used, and then\nadditional domestic training in period 2 stops. Foreign workers begin to be used for production\nonly, and when they get very cheap, there is no training at all and foreigners do all the\nproduction: the regime is FN1, FN2, FN3.\nIn order to show quantitative results, we rotate Figure 1, showing the cost of foreign\nexperts, the exogenous variable, on the horizontal axis of Figure 2-4. Each column of Figures 2-\n4 represents an independent general-equilibrium solution to the model. Moving to the right\nrepresents solution to successive runs of the model, not moving through time. On the left of the\nhorizontal axis, cost is prohibitively high, while on the right-hand edge foreign experts are cheap.\nThus moving left to right corresponds to moving from economies facing a very high cost of\nexperts toward economies facing a low-cost situation (cost is a trade cost variable, not a tariff, so\nthere is no income effect of tariff revenue, and its value is exogenous to the government).\nFigure 2 shows the number of domestic workers who are skilled by period 3, dividing\nthem into self trained, trained by foreign experts in period 1 (FS1) and those trained by foreign-\ntrained domestic workers in period 2 (DS2). As the cost of foreign experts falls, we see that self\ntraining falls to zero. Over regimes 2 and 3 (vertical dotted lines separate regimes), FS1 = DS2\nsince every domestic worker foreign trained at t = 1 trains another domestic worker at t = 2. But\nin regime 4, not all workers foreign-trained at t = 1 train an addition worker and instead an\nincreasing number produce without training (DN2). In regime 5, training of additional workers\nat t = 2 ceases entirely. In regime 6, training by experts declines toward zero.\nThis last regime shift, in which all training ceases, can be thought of in terms of equation\n(9) above. Skilled wages are driven down relative to the unskilled wage in periods 2 and 3\nsufficiently that the zero-profit condition for FS1 becomes slack and that for FN1 holds with\nequality.\nUp to regime 6, the number of skilled workers trained and the number working are the\nsame, since skilled workers at t = 3 are all domestic trained in activities DS1, FS1 and/or DS2.\nBut again, once foreign experts are sufficiently cheap, training declines toward zero as foreigners\nare used for production only, training becoming unprofitable. Taken together, these results\nimply that, over a substantial range, the use of foreign experts and the training of domestic\nskilled workers are complements, but that they become substitutes as foreign experts become\nvery cheap.\nFigure 3 graphs the total number of domestic workers who are trained by t = 3, and the\ncumulative number of domestic skilled-worker years. This illustrates that the advantages offered\nby increasingly cheaper foreigners are taken in the form of getting skilled workers earlier, rather\nthan having more skilled workers at t = 3, until the foreign experts are truly cheap.\nIn spite of the complicated regime shifting as foreign experts become cheaper, our\nintuition would suggest that two things ought to rise monotonically with lower cost of experts.\nFirst, cumulative X production ought to rise continuously and so should intertemporal welfare.\nBoth suspicions are correct. Cumulative X production which does indeed rise monotonically.\nFigure 4 shows welfare and X production/consumption in each time period as a function\nof the cost of experts. Welfare rises steadily as cost falls as intuition would suggest. However, it\nis interesting to note that the gains from trade are taken over a large range of costs in the form of\nearlier consumption of X; indeed, there is a range over which X3\ndeclines. Perfect smoothing is\nachieved after the shift to regime 5, where additional training of workers at t = 2 ceases (DS2\nbecomes inactive). At this point and over all of regime 5, there is an equal number of skilled\nworkers in all time periods (n experts at t= 1 produce n domestic skilled workers for periods 2\nand 3 using FT1), and so an equal X output in all time periods.\nThe appendix to the paper illustrates the effects of imposing a period-by-period trade-\nbalance constraint.\n6This simulation uses a value of cost = 8. ac was set at 1 in Figure 1-4; here we concentrate on\nlower values to illustrate the region of interesting action.\n5 Results 2: varying learning capacity\nNow consider a different experiment. Suppose that foreign experts are available at a\nconstant moderate cost, but we vary the parameter ac (absorptive capacity) which gives the\nnumber of efficiency units of skilled labor produced when an unskilled laborer is trained. We\nassume that this applied to both the self-training activity and production/training activities.\nProduction functions are given as follows.\nWe begin with this value very low, so that initially all production is done by foreign\nexperts and no training is done whether by LBS or LBW. An economy with low capacity is\nstagnant, consuming the same amount every period.6\nRegimes are shown in Figure 5, using the same format as Figure 1. Each row is a\nsolution to the general-equilibrium model, with capacity or capability rising as we move down\nthe vertical axis. Initially, all production is done by foreign experts and there is no training as\njust noted. For economies with a higher capacity, we see that activity FS1 becomes active, and\nsome domestic workers are trained for periods 2 and 3, but non-training production activities by\nforeigners FN2 and FN3 continue to be used in regimes 2 and 3. In regime 4, production-only\nactivities FN2 and DN2 cease and DS2 becomes active: some workers trained by foreigners in\nperiod 1 train additional domestic workers in period 2. In regime 5, FN3 becomes inactive, so\n7With reference to the previous footnote, DS1 (LBS) would never be active at lower values of\ncost, one reason we chose a moderately high value in this simulation.\nfrom this point on foreign experts are only used in activities with training. In regime 6, DS1\nbecomes active, as it now pays some workers to begin LBS in period 1.7 Finally, use of foreign\nexperts after t = 1 ceases in regime 7. Foreign experts are only used to train some workers at t =\n1, who then train additional workers at t = 2, the latter joining LBS workers as skilled workers in\nFigure 6 presents the same information as Figure 2. Again, each column is a general\nequilibrium solution, with movements to the right being movements to higher-capacity\neconomies, not a movement through time. In the present case, there is no training/learning\ninitially. All production is by foreign experts working alone. Then we have a region in which all\ntraining is done by foreign experts. Then some of those trained undertake additional training in\nperiod 2 (DS2). The \"experts\" and \"domestic\" curves come together when additional training by\nexperts at t = 2 ceases (FS2 = 0) and each domestic worker train by a foreign expert at t = 1 trains\nan additional worker at t = 2 (FS1 = DS2). Then the self-training activity becomes active (DS1 >\n0). Thus as capacity improves, an increasingly large share of domestic skilled workers are self or\ndomestic trained.\nFigure 7 shows the use of foreign experts by period. While the total number of foreign\nexperts continues to rise for economies of successively higher capacities, it is clear that the use of\nforeigners moves earlier in time. Their role is to help \"jump start\" the process, allowing X to be\nconsumed in period 1 and domestic skilled workers to be produced for period 2.\nFigure 8 presents this information another way, showing the number of foreigners used in\nproduction-only activities versus training activities. The number of domestic workers in self-\n8Activity FS1 continues to increase with even higher values of ac; it never goes to zero since it is\nvital to getting X output at t = 1 and t = 2, and for producing skilled workers for t = 2.\nis higher than X2\nover the middle range becauseX1\nis important for generating skilled\nworkers for t = 2. That is, activity FS1 is run at a high level because of the valuable joint outputs of S2\n.\nstudy and being trained by other skilled domestic workers is also shown. Economies with low\ncapacity rely on foreigners to produce X in all periods, but production-only activities are\nreplaced by those with training at higher capacities. Eventually, the use of foreigners for training\nis overtaken by self-study and training by skilled domestic workers.\nTaken together, Figures 6-8 show that economies with successively higher capacities (a)\nrely proportionately less on foreigner experts, (b) use foreign experts for a shorter period of time,\n(c) decease and then eliminate the use of foreigners in production-only activities. For low\ncapacity economies, foreign experts substitute for domestic skilled workers. But for higher\ncapacity economies, foreign experts become complements to domestic skilled workers in that the\nformer cease production-only activities and engage in production-training activities. But for very\nhigh-capacity economies, the LBS activity DS1 increasingly substitutes for foreign production-\ntraining at t = 2 (FS2) and the use of foreigners is confined to period 1.8\nFinally, Figure 9 shows welfare and X production in the three periods. Here we have a\nsituation quite different from the cost results of the previous section. There we started with an\nuneven consumption pattern and achieved consumption smoothing as things improved. Here the\nlow-capacity economies are stagnant and characterized by smooth (and low) consumption.\nUneven consumption and growth occurs for high-capacity economies.9\nWe can now summarize the results of our three-period model.\n(1) Importing foreign experts allows the economy to produce skilled workers earlier and\nat a lower cost than through learning from scratch: reinventing the wheel. This in turn allows\nearlier and large consumption of the good produced using skilled labor.\n(2) As the cost of foreign experts falls from an initially prohibitive level, they are used\nsparingly for one period only, with the newly-skilled domestic workers training additional\ndomestic workers in period 2. As foreign experts become cheaper, all training is done by\nforeigners, and when they are very cheap it does not pay to train anyone, and all production of X\nis done by the foreigners.\n(3) As the cost of foreign experts falls from an initially prohibitive level, gains from trade\nare initially taken in the form of having skilled workers earlier rather than in having more skilled\nworkers by t = 3, and in having X consumption earlier rather than (significantly) more X over\nthree periods.\n(4) Taken together, (2) and (3) imply that foreign experts and domestic skilled workers\nare complements up to the point where the former are very cheap. They are complements in the\nsense that a fall in the price of foreign experts induces the creation of domestic skilled workers\nearlier, and a large cumulative number of domestic skilled-worker years, although not\nnecessarily a larger total of domestic skilled workers at t = 3. When foreigners are very cheap,\nforeign experts and domestic skilled workers are substitutes in the sense that further falls in the\ncost of experts reduces and eventually eliminates domestic training.\n(5) Our second experiment involved changing the economy's learning or \"absorptive\"\ncapacity: the efficiency with which unskilled workers are transformed into skilled workers in\nboth LBS and LBW acitivities. Results show that economies with successively higher capacities\n(a) rely proportionately less on foreigner experts, (b) use foreign experts for a shorter period of\ntime, (c) decease and then eliminate the use of foreigners in production-only activities.\n(6) For low capacity economies, foreign experts substitute for domestic skilled workers.\nBut for higher capacity economies, foreign experts become complements to domestic skilled\nworkers in that the former cease production-only activities and engage in production-training\nactivities. But for very high-capacity economies, the LBS activity DS1 increasingly substitutes\nfor foreign production-training at t = 2 (FS2) and the use of foreigners is confined to period 1.\n(7) We also did an experiment constraining international borrowing to pay for experts in\nearly years by imposing a period-by-period balance-of-trade constraint. Results here are\ngenerally intuitive in comparison to the case with borrowing permitted, so they are reported in an\nappendix for the cost experiment. Self-study persists at lower values of experts' costs than with\nborrowing. The use of foreign experts to train domestic workers is both reduced and spread out\nover time relative to the case with borrowing. There is less consumption smoothing, and\nconsumption of X in period 1 in particular lags behind what is achieved in the case with\nborrowing.\n(8) Borrowing supports more total domestic workers trained and more cumulative\nskilled-worker years than without, and in that sense we can say that access to foreign experts and\nto foreign borrowing are complements.\nReferences\nBlomstrom, Magnus, and Ari Kokko 1998.

World Bank working\nppendix: No international borrowing\nThe assumption in the model that foreign borrowing is allowed to pay for foreign experts\nin early years may not be realistic for many developing economies. Thus in this section we\nbriefly consider the extreme opposite assumption that there is no international borrowing\nallowed. Obviously, this makes no difference in autarky. In addition, we have calibrated the\nmodel so that at a price for foreign experts of one (right-hand end of our figures), there is perfect\nconsumption smoothing and so again the ability to borrow or not makes no difference. The\nability to borrow thus matters between autarky and the price of one.\nThe model is now modified to have three foreign-exchange \"goods\" instead of one.\nExperts can only be imported in period 1 in exchange for Y1\nand similarly for experts in periods\n2 and 3. Thus trade balances within each period.\nFigure A1 shows the regimes in the same manner as Figure 1 and Figure 5 for decreasing\ncosts of consultants top to bottom. Results are rather intuitive, and so let us just list them in\ncomparison to the case of Figure 1 with borrowing allowed.\n(1) The self-study/training activity DS1 continues to be active at lower experts' cost than\nwith borrowing.\n(2) The activity DS2, in which domestic skilled workers trained by foreign experts in\nperiod 1 train more domestic workers in period 2 continues to be active at lower experts' cost\nthan with borrowing.\n(3) Activity FS2, in which foreign experts are employed to train a second-generation of\ndomestic workers in period 2 is now active for an intermediate range of costs. This activity is\nnever active with borrowing allowed.\n(4) The use of foreign experts to simply produce and not train (FN1, FN2, FN3) now\noccurs at higher costs than with borrowing allowed.\nThus the international borrowing constraint implies that self-study/training persists at\nlower experts' costs, but conversely experts are use to produce without training any domestic\nworkers at higher experts' costs. Somewhat loosely, we could say that the use of foreign experts\nfor training is both reduced and is shifted later in time (or spread out over time).\nFigure A2 shows the equivalent of Figure 2, and differs from the latter by the fact that the\nactivity FS2 (foreigners training more domestics at t = 2) is now used at intermediate experts'\ncost. Figure A2 shows that there is more reliance on self-study (DS1) and training by domestic\nskilled workers (DS2) at moderate costs and, when all training is done by experts when costs are\nlow, fewer domestic workers are trained. For all levels of experts' cost except the two\nendpoints, fewer domestic workers are trained and the total cumulative skilled-worker years is\nless when borrowing is not allowed (results not shown).\nLastly, Figure A3 reveals again that the welfare benefits of access to foreign experts are\ntaken in the form of earlier X consumption up to the point where experts' cost are moderate.\nThere is less consumption smoothing, and complete smoothing is not achieved until the price of\nexperts falls to one. Between autarky and a price of one, welfare is somewhat lower (but not\ndramatically so) with borrowing constrained.\nFOREIGN\ncost of self training\nforeign foreign experts for production and training 1st period only, domestic 2nd period training\nexperts foreign experts for production and training 1st period only (all training by foreigners)\nforeign experts for production only, no training\nFigure 1: Production and training regimes - cost of foreign experts\nFigures 2: Total self/domestic trained and trained by foreign\nexperts by t = 3\nCost of foreign experts\nS/D trained, trained by foreigners\nSelf trained (DT1) Trained by for (FS1 + FS2) Domestic trained (DS2)\nself trained\nexperts\ndomestic\nFigures 3: Total trained, total skilled-worker years\nCost of foreign experts\nTotal trained, cummulative years\nTotal trained by t = 3 Cummulative domestic skilled worker years\ntotal trained by t = 3\ncummulative years\nFigure 4: X production by period, welfare\nCost of foreign experts\nWelfare, X production and consumption\nwelfare\nLEARNING\n* * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * *\n* * * * *\n* * * *\n* * * * *\n* * * *\ncost of foreign experts for production only, no training\nforeign foreign experts for production and training 1st period, production only t = 2,3\nexperts foreign experts for production and training 1st and 2nd period, domestic training t = 2\nforeign experts for production and training 1st period, self learning, domestic training t = 2\nFigure 5: Production and training regimes - learning capacity\nFigure 6: Total self/domestic trained and trained by foreign\nexperts by t = 3\nLearning capacity\nS/D trained, trained by foreigners\nSelf trained (DS1) Trained by for (FS1+FS2) Domestic trained (DS2)\nself trained\nexperts\ndomestic\nFigure 7: Use of foreign experts by period\nLearning capacity\nUse of foreign experts by period\nFigure 8: Use of foreign experts for training versus\nproduction only over three periods\nLearning capacity\nUse of foreign experts\nFigure 9: X production by period, welfare\nLearning capacity\nX production\nWelfare\nwelfare\nFOREIGN\n* *\n* * * *\n* * * * *\n* * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * *\ncost of self training\nforeign foreign experts for production and training 1st period only, domestic 2nd period training\nexperts foreign experts for production and training 1st-2nd period, domestic 2nd period training\nforeign experts for production and training 1st period only (all training by foreigners)\nforeign experts for production only, no training\nFigure A1: Production and training regimes with no international\nborrowing allowed - cost of foreign experts\nFigures A2: Total self/domestic trained and trained by\nforeign experts by t = 3 (no international borrowing)\nCost of foreign experts\nS/D trained, trained by foreigners\nSelf trained Trained by foreign experts Domestic trained\nself trained foreigners\ndomestic\nFigures A3: Welfare, X consumption (no international\nborrowing)\nCost of foreign experts\nWelfare, X production and consumption\nwelfare\nThe following Discussion Papers have been published since 2004:\nSeries 1: Economic Studies\n1 2004 Foreign Bank Entry into Emerging Economies:\nAn Empirical Assessment of the Determinants\nand Risks Predicated on German FDI Data Torsten Wezel\n2 2004 Does Co-Financing by Multilateral Development\nBanks Increase \"Risky\" Direct Investment in\nEmerging Markets? \u00ad\nEvidence for German Banking FDI Torsten Wezel\n3 2004 Policy Instrument Choice and Non-Coordinated Giovanni Lombardo\nMonetary Policy in Interdependent Economies Alan Sutherland\nin an Asymmetric Currency Area Giovanni Lombardo\n5 2004 FDI versus cross-border financial services: Claudia M.
