Gonococcal susceptibility to\nFlavored Tobacco Product Use Among US Youth\nMost tobacco use begins during youth and young adulthood.1\nRecent declines in prevalence of cigarette smoking among\nyouth have coincided with increased use of e-cigarettes and\nhookahs.2 Although flavors\nother than menthol are pro-\nhibited in cigarettes in the\nUnited States,3 flavored non-\ncigarettetobaccoproductsare\nwidely available and may appeal to youth. We examined fla-\nvored tobacco use among a nationally representative sample\nof US youth.\nMethods | The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health\n(PATH) Study is a household-based, nationally representa-\ntive, longitudinal cohort study of 45 971 adults and\nyouth (12-17 years) in the United States. We analyzed youth\ndata from wave 1, collected September 2013 through\nDecember 2014 (the survey is available in the eAppendix\nin the Supplement). Among youth within participating\nhouseholds (weighted household screener rate, 54%), 78.4%\nparticipated in an audio computer-assisted interview.\nNonresponse analysis showed few differences with re-\nferent national surveys.4 Survey weights were adjusted for\nnonresponse.\nParents and emancipated youth provided written in-\nformed consent, whereas youth assented to participate. Fur-\nther details regarding the study methods are available.4 The\nstudy was conducted by Westat and approved by the Westat\ninstitutional review board.\nYouth responded to questions about ever and past\n30-day use of tobacco products including cigarettes,\ne-cigarettes, hookahs, cigars (traditional cigars, cigarillos, fil-\ntered cigars), pipe tobacco, all types of smokeless tobacco,\ndissolvable tobacco, bidis, and kreteks. For each product ever\nused, youth endorsed whether the first product they used\nwas flavored (eg, \"Was the first e-cigarette you used flavored\nto taste like menthol, mint, clove, spice, candy, fruit, choco-\nlate, alcohol [such as wine or cognac], or other sweets?\").\nUsers of noncigarette products reported any past 30-day use\nof a flavored product. Past 30-day noncigarette tobacco users\nalso reported reasons for product use, including \"(It) comes\nin flavors I like,\" for each product. Past 30-day cigarette\nsmokers reported smoking cigarettes flavored to taste like\nmenthol or mint.\nWe used SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) survey pro-\ncedures to account for weighting and calculated proportions\nwith 95% confidence intervals for all measures. Estimates\nfrom denominators of fewer than 50 users are suppressed;\nestimates with relative standard errors greater than 30%\nare flagged.\nResults | Of the 13 651 youth enrolled and included in this\nnon-Hispanic black, and 22.5% Hispanic. Mean respondent\npast 30-day use of flavored tobacco products. The majority of\nyouth ever-users reported that the first product they had\nused was flavored, including 88.7% of ever hookah users,\ncigar type, and 50.1% of ever cigarette smokers. For past\n30-day youth tobacco use, the overall proportion of flavored\namong e-cigarette users, 71.7% among users of any cigar\ntype, and 59.5% among cigarette smokers.\nTable 2 presents leading reasons for use among past\n30-day noncigarette tobacco users. Youth consistently\nreported product flavoring as a reason for use across all\nproduct types, including e-cigarettes (81.5%), hookahs\nDiscussion | Among a survey of youth aged 12 to 17 years, the\nmajority who self-reported ever experimenting with tobacco\nstarted with a flavored product, and most current youth\ntobacco users reported use of flavored products. This study\nextends a recent national report5 on youth use of flavored\ntobacco products by examining first use of flavored product\namong ever users by products and flavorings as a reason for\nSupplemental content at\njama.com\nLetters\n \nDownloaded From: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

In addition to\ncontinued proven tobacco control and prevention strategies,\nefforts to decrease use of flavored tobacco products among\nyouth should be considered.1\nStudy limitations include potential difficulty with recall\nbecause youth often experiment with many products. This\ncross-sectional analysis does not allow direct estimation of\nflavoring's role in initiation of tobacco use among youth. In\naddition, there are mode differences in household- vs school-\nbased youth tobacco surveys.6 Data from future PATH Study\nwaves can provide information on tobacco use trajectories\nfollowing experimentation with flavored compared with\nnonflavored products.\nBridget K.
