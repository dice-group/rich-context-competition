Positive involvement by the fa-\nther was inversely associated with child problem behav-\nior trajectories. The effects of maternal depressive symp-\ntoms on child problem behaviors varied by the level of\nthe father's positive involvement.\nConclusion: When the father actively compensates for\nlimitations in the depressed mother's functioning, the\nchild's risk of problem behaviors may be reduced.\nmaternal depression and\nchild problem behavior has\nbeen widely documented.1\nChildren of depressed par-\nents display problems such as difficult tem-\nperament, aggression, poor self-esteem,\npoor peer relations, depressed mood, in-\nsecure attachment patterns, and atten-\ntion deficits.1-3 Children's behavior prob-\nlems may be indicators of the beginning\nof mental health problems.4\nMost research on the effects of mater-\nnal depression on offspring has focused on\nearly childhood development and is lim-\nited by various methodological problems,\nincluding small sample sizes, cross-\nsectionaldesign,imprecisemeasuresofma-\nternal depression and child outcomes, and\nincorrect statistical modeling for data with\nclusterstructures.5-7 Longitudinalstudiesex-\namining the adverse effects of maternal de-\npression have begun to emerge in the past\ndecade. However, the few studies with lon-\ngitudinal designs have usually covered only\nlimited periods of child development (ie,\nchildhoodoradolescencebutnotboth)and\noften have included child outcome mea-\nexample, Radke-Yarrow et al9 assessed the\nchange in problem behaviors over 3 years\namong young children of depressed moth-\ners. They found that children of depressed\nmothers had more disruptive and depres-\nsive problems than those of nondepressed\nmothers. Furthermore, children's problem\nbehaviors increased over time, and the con-\ntinuity of problems was greater among chil-\ndren of depressed mothers compared with\nchildren of nondepressed mothers.9 The\nfindings from this study enhanced our un-\nderstanding of children of a depressed par-\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartment of Community\nHealth in Epidemiology, School\nof Public Health, Saint Louis\nUniversity, St Louis, Missouri\n(Dr Chang); and Departments\nof Maternal and Child Health\n(Drs Chang and Halpern) and\nEpidemiology (Dr Kaufman),\nSchool of Public Health,\nUniversity of North Carolina,\nChapel Hill.\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

Longer-term longitudinal analyses spanning dif-\nferent developmental stages are needed to gain a better un-\nderstanding of the effects of maternal depression on change\nin child problem behaviors over time.\nDespite the adversity of having a depressed mother,\nmany children exhibit competent adaptation to their ad-\nverse environment.19 Little is known about protective fac-\ntors associated with better outcomes for children of de-\npressed parents,20 but one factor is the availability of a\nsupport system for a child,21 such as a good relationship\nwith at least 1 parent.22 The father's role has tradition-\nally been neglected in the child development litera-\nhave a positive effect on children's well-being, whereas\nothers28-30 have reported that fathers are peripheral to\ncertain child and adolescent outcomes. These mixed\nfindings may be attributed to the differences in the mea-\nsurement of the father's involvement, with some studies\nreporting the frequency of paternal contacts and others\nassessing the quality of the father's involvement.31\nThe present study examines the effects of maternal de-\npressive symptoms on the trajectories of offspring prob-\nlem behaviors in childhood and early adolescence over\n10 years. The study also evaluates the extent to which\nthe effect of maternal depressive symptoms on child prob-\nlem behaviors varies by the level of the father's positive\ninvolvement. This study was approved by the institu-\ntional review board at the University of North Carolina\nat Chapel Hill.\nMETHODS\nThis study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of\nhome interviews with a nationally representative household\nsample of men and women to trace their labor market experi-\nences. Since 1986, detailed information about their biological\nchildren, including each child's behavioral and social function-\ning, has been collected biennially. Each mother can be matched\nwith more than 1 biological child.32\nThe present investigation spans from January 1, 1992 (when\ndepressive symptoms were first included), to December 31, 2002.\nChildren eligible for the analysis sample were 0 to 10 years old\nin 1992, were living with their biological mother, and must have\nbeen interviewed at least once during the study period. Moth-\ners must have complete maternal depression data to be eli-\nNLSY79 mothers. The NLSY79 children are representative of\nchildren born to women in the United States who were 21\nMEASURES\nMaternal Depressive Symptoms\nMaternal self-reported depressive symptoms were measured in\n1992 using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies\u00adDepression\n(CES-D) scale. The CES-D scale is a 20-item self-report instru-\nment designed to assess the frequency of depressive symp-\ntoms experienced in the previous week.33 A higher score indi-\ncates more depressive symptoms. The CES-D scale score was\ndichotomized using the previously reported standard cutoff score\nof 15 or higher to identify cases of depressive symptoms.34,35\nThe CES-D scale has been widely used as a measure of depres-\nsive symptoms in epidemiologic research and as an initial screen-\ning tool for clinical depression in community-based samples.36,37\nBehavior Problems\nThe behavior problems of children aged 4 to 14 years were as-\nsessed biennially using the Behavioral Problems Index (BPI),\nmodeled after the Child Behavior Checklist.38 This instrument\nis a listing of 28 specific childhood problem behaviors or symp-\ntoms designed to be administered relatively efficiently in the\ncontext of a survey.32 The BPI has been used in many studies\nof children's behavior problems.39 Mothers indicate whether the\nsymptom in question was typically exhibited by their child in\nthe past 3 months. Responses were summed into scales. Higher\nscores indicate a higher level of behavior problems. Reliability\nestimates of the total problem score range from 0.86 to 0.89.\nPast research39 has shown that the BPI factors consist of 2 broad\nconstructs: internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depres-\nsion, and externalizing problems, such as antisocial behavior,\npeer problems, and hyperactivity. The Center for Human Re-\nsource Research has standardized BPI scores by age and sex based\non cross-sectional data of general population samples (mean\nFather's Positive Involvement\nThis measure applied to resident and nonresident fathers. The\nfather's involvement was based on 7 questions in the self-\nadministered supplement for children 10 years or older. Par-\nticipants were asked about how often their father talks over im-\nportant decisions with the child, listens to the child's side of\nan argument, knows who the child is with when not at home,\nmisses events or activities that are important to the child, whether\nthe child thinks the father spends enough time with him or her,\nhow well the father and child share ideas or talk about things\nthat really matter, and how close the child feels to the father.\nEach question has 4 or 5 Likert-type response categories. Fac-\ntor analysis indicated a 1-factor dimension for the 7 father in-\nvolvement items (=.95). Therefore, responses were summed\ninto a scale. Higher scores reflect higher levels of positive pa-\nternal involvement. The mean of the individual items was used\nfor the indicator of the father's involvement to include chil-\ndren who did not have answers to all 7 corresponding ques-\ntions in the analysis. To reflect the father's involvement over\ntime, this measure was coded as time varying from multiple\nassessments.\nCovariates\nChild's sex was a 0/1 dummy variable, with a value of 1 being\nmale. Race/ethnicity was captured by two 0/1 dummy vari-\nables, one for black and the other for Hispanic, with 1 repre-\nsenting minority status. Maternal age at child birth was a con-\ntinuous variable and was mean centered for easier variable\nestimate interpretation.40 Mother's educational level was also\na mean-centered continuous variable reflecting the number of\nyears of schooling mothers reported as of January 1, 1992. Num-\nber of children was used to indicate how many minors were\nliving in the household. Most NLSY79 women were of child-\nbearing age during the study. Family size may change over time.\nMultiple assessments of number of children were used to cre-\nate a time-varying measure.\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nFamilial poverty status compared the respondent's income\nwith the corresponding poverty threshold for the respon-\ndent's family size and the year in which the interview was con-\nducted.32 Respondents whose income was below this thresh-\nold were classified as being in poverty. Because family income\nmay fluctuate over time, poverty status was treated as a time-\nvarying measure with multiple assessments. Urban residency\nwas a 0/1 dummy variable. This measure was also coded as time\nvarying with multiple assessments. A time-varying binary resi-\ndent father status indicator was constructed based on self-\nreported data from children aged 10 to 14 years. The presence\nof a resident father was indicated if a child reported living with\neither a biological father or a stepfather.\nTo accommodate the nested structure of the data and to ob-\ntain unbiased estimates, growth curve analysis of hierarchical\nlinear modeling was performed.41 The growth curve models si-\nmultaneously estimate intra-individual time-based trajecto-\nries and test whether interindividual differences in the para-\nmeters of these trajectories are a function of time-invariant and\ntime-variant predictors.42 A general form of the full linear growth\ncurve model is as follows:\nYijt\n=\n\nTime\nAjt\n\nXit\n\nXjt\n\n\u00b5i\n\n\u00b5j\n\nijt\n.\nThe variable Ajt\nrepresents the maternal depressive symp-\ntoms measure. The vectors Xi\nand Xj\ninclude observed child-\nand mother-specific factors, respectively, which may affect the\ntrajectories of child problem behaviors. The vectors \u00b5i\nand \u00b5j\nrepresent the time-invariant, unobserved child (i) and mater-\nnal (j) factors that affect child behavior outcomes.\nAt each wave of NLSY79 data, the distributions of internal-\nizing and externalizing scores were positively skewed. This vio-\nlates the assumption of normality of the dependent variable for\nlinear growth curve modeling. Several transformations of out-\ncome measures were attempted. Among all, a log-transfor-\nmation of the outcome subtracted by a constant yielded an ap-\nproximately normal distribution of outcomes. Hence, this article\nreports results based on the log-transformed outcome data.\nRESULTS\n(Table 1). The proportions of boys and girls were ap-\nproximatelythesame(50.1%wereboys).Thereweremore\nchildren. The mean (SD) child internalizing and exter-\nmaternal age was 30.7 years. Most mothers had at least\na high school education (87.0%), reported living in an\nurban area (81.5%), and had a mean of 2 children. The\nmean maternal age at child birth was 27.6 years. Ap-\nproximately 24% of the mothers lived in poverty, and\n23.4% of women in the study sample reported having de-\npressive symptoms. Most children (67.4%) reported liv-\ning with either their biological father or stepfather. The\ndegree of the father's involvement ranged from 0 to 3.5,\nwith a mean of 2.2. A mean of 2.2 reflects moderate lev-\nels of positive involvement by the father (eg, sometimes\ntalking over important decisions with the child, listen-\ning to the child's side of an argument, and the child re-\nporting feeling fairly close to the father).\nFirst, 2 unconditional growth curve models were es-\ntimated for internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The\nunconditional growth model estimated that the mean tra-\njectories for child internalizing and externalizing behav-\niors have a nonzero intercept and a nonzero slope (in-\nternalizing: Pintercept\nPintercept\n.001) (data not shown). The vari-\nances around the mean intercept and slope were also sig-\nnificant (P.001), indicating that there is notable diver-\nsity in children's individual trajectories of problem\nbehaviors. The slope is the rate of change in problem be-\nhaviors over time represented by child age at each wave\ncentered at 4.\nNext, separate conditional growth models were con-\nstructed to examine whether individual changes in child\nproblem behaviors over time differ by maternal depres-\nsive symptoms. A multiplicative interaction term of ma-\nternal depressive symptoms and rate of change was tested.\nCovariates such as child's sex, race/ethnicity, maternal\neducation, maternal age at child birth, number of chil-\ndren, poverty status, urban residency, and resident fa-\nther status were included to control for potential con-\nfounding. The conditional growth curve models estimated\na statistically significant effect of maternal depressive\nMother-Child Dyads From the National Longitudinal\nCharacteristic Value\nChild age, y\nChild race/ethnicity\nChild standardized BPI score, mean (SD)\nMother's educational level (n = 3197), y\nNo. of children of mother in the household,\nmean (SD)\nAge of mother at childbirth, mean (SD), y 27.6 (5.1)\nFather's involvement\nResident fatherb\nAbbreviation: BPI, Behavioral Problems Index.\naData are given as number (unweighted percentage) except where\notherwise indicated.\nbFather's resident status was first assessed in 1994 for children aged 10 to\n14 years in the self-administered questionnaire.\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

Table 2 displays the\nmeans and variances of each parameter estimate from\nthis analysis. For internalizing behavior, a significant\nnegative rate of change was obtained (P.001), indicat-\ning that internalizing behaviors decreased during the\nstudy. In contrast, externalizing behaviors remained\nstable over time as the rate of change was not statisti-\ncally significant. After controlling for the father's posi-\ntive involvement and other covariates, maternal depres-\nsive symptoms were not associated with the trajectories\nof child problem behaviors. A statistically significant in-\ndependent effect of the father's positive involvement on\nthe trajectories of child problem behaviors was found\n(Pinternalizing\npositive involvement by the father were negatively asso-\nciated with child problem behaviors over time. In addi-\ntion, the father's positive involvement significantly\nmodified the association between maternal depressive\nsymptoms and trajectories of child problem behaviors\n(Pinternalizing\n=.02, Pexternalizing\n=.008). The Figure illustrates\nthese findings. The protective effect of the father's posi-\ntive involvement was statistically significant for chil-\ndren of depressed and nondepressed mothers, and the\neffects seem larger for the nondepressed group.\nCOMMENT\nThe present study shows that the adverse effects of ma-\nternal depressive symptoms on the trajectories of child\nproblem behaviors across childhood and early adoles-\ncence are negligible after the role of positive paternal in-\nvolvement is considered. We observed that higher lev-\nels of positive involvement by the father were negatively\nassociated with trajectories of child problem behaviors.\nHigher levels of positive involvement by the father also\nattenuated the adverse effect of maternal depressive symp-\ntoms on trajectories of child problem behaviors.\nRadke-Yarrow and associates9 reported increases in dis-\nruptive and depressive problems in young children of af-\nfectively ill mothers compared with children of control\nmothers, but their analysis did not include the father's in-\nvolvementanddidnotextendbeyond2timepoints,incon-\ntrasttothemultipleassessmentsofthepresentstudy.When\none parent is depressed, the other parent may attempt to\ncompensate for the impaired functioning of the depressed\nparent,14,20 possibly resulting in better parenting practices\nTable 2.

Previous research43,44 on 2-parent families generally\nhave found that feelings of closeness between fathers and\nchildrenwereassociatedwithpositivechildoutcomes,such\naslowlevelsofpsychologicaldistressanddelinquency.Con-\nsistent with previous research, we observed that higher lev-\nels of positive involvement by the father were associated\nwith lower levels of child problem behaviors. We also ob-\nserved that the protective effect of the father's positive in-\nvolvement was larger for the nondepressed group than for\nthe depressed group (Figure 1). Having a depressed par-\nent is a marker of risk of living in a family context charac-\nterized by considerable disadvantage.45 Children with a de-\npressed parent are at higher risk for chronic stress, family\ncrises, parental marital conflict, family violence, and pos-\nsibly a disturbed second parent.45 This adversity in fami-\nlies with a depressed parent may explain the difference in\nthe protective effect of the father's involvement experi-\nenced by the depressed and nondepressed groups in the\npresent study. Results of the present study have impor-\ntantimplicationsforintervention.Promotingincreasedlev-\nels of positive involvement from a father may be another\navenue for reducing negative effects on child develop-\nment when a mother displays depressive symptoms.\nPrevious research46 suggests that childhood problem\nbehaviors frequently endure over time. The present study\nshows stability in externalizing behaviors from child-\nhood to earlier adolescence but a decline in internaliz-\ning behaviors. The decline in internalizing behaviors may\nreflect true change over time, or it may be a result of pos-\nsible measurement error in maternal self-reported child\nproblem behavior data. This study observed significant\nwithin-subject effects from the growth curve models, im-\nplying that levels of problem behavior varied over time\nand that the individual trajectory differed from one child\nto another. This confirms the need to study individual\nchange over time when the child is exposed to maternal\ndepressive symptoms. The conventional population-\naverage approach assumes the same population mean and\nslope in predicting child problem behaviors for all chil-\ndren. Present within-individual effects suggest that in-\ntervention programs tailored to individuals' specific needs\nand backgrounds may be warranted for children with\nproblem behaviors who are living with a depressed\nmother.\nSome methodological limitations of this study need\nto be considered in interpreting the study findings. The\nCES-D scale used in the NLSY79 is not a diagnostic cri-\nteria\u00adbased assessment tool for clinical depression. More-\nover, maternal depressive symptoms were considered only\nat baseline. Depressive symptoms often wax and wane\nduring an individual's lifetime.\nMultiple assessments of this exposure are needed to\nbetter understand the effect of maternal depression on\nchild behaviors over time. The BPI scores used in this\nstudy are not comparable with a Diagnostic and Statisti-\ncal Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)47 clini-\ncal diagnosis. However, there is evidence that young chil-\ndren with higher scores on the behavior scales are more\nlikely than other children to have persistent behavior prob-\nlems, to have Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (Third Edition)48 diagnoses of externalizing dis-\norders in later childhood, and to use mental health ser-\nvices later in childhood.49 The present study was also lim-\nited by no independent (beyond the mothers') report of\nchildren's behavior problems. Nonetheless, previous stud-\nies50,51 have found that mothers' reports on emotional and\nbehavior problems in children were consistent with the\nreports of others, including teachers and mental health\nprofessionals.\nPast research52 has suggested that depressed moth-\ners' impaired cognition and perceptions may bias their\nreport and result in higher rates of child problem behav-\niors. Hence, measurement error in child problem behav-\nior is possible. In general, the older the child at expo-\nsure, the more likely the child will be resilient to the\nadversity of maternal depression because the child will\nhave developed competencies that prepare him or her for\nsuccessful coping.53 The inclusion of children at vary-\ning ages of exposure at baseline may have resulted in an\nunderestimation of the effect of maternal depression on\nchild problem behaviors. This investigation was also lim-\nited by a lack of information on potential confounders,\nChild Age, y\nChild Externalizing Behavior\nB\nChild Age, y\nChild Internalizing Behavior\nA\nfa=Low\nfa=Low fa=Medium\nfa=Medium fa=High\nfa=High\nfa=None\nfa=None\nDepressed mothers Nondepressed mothers\nFigure.

To our\nknowledge, this is the first longitudinal study that in-\ncorporates multiple assessments of family environment\nin studying child problem behaviors. Most previous stud-\nies of child development measured family characteris-\ntics at only 1 point in time, assuming that the life cir-\ncumstances a child experiences remain constant over time.\nIn addition, the literature about depressed mothers rarely\nconsiders the fathers' involvement.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study show that\nhigher levels of positive involvement by the father\nwere inversely associated with child problem behav-\niors over time and that the effects of maternal depres-\nsive symptoms on child behaviors vary by the level of\nthe father's positive involvement. Poor maternal men-\ntal health has serious implications for the health of\nwomen and for their children. Increased recognition\nand treatment of maternal depression is needed. The\nprotective effect of a father's positive involvement\ndocumented in this study suggests that health care\nprofessionals should encourage the father's increased\npositive involvement with his children. When the\nfather readily compensates for the limitations on the\ndepressed mother's functioning, the child's risk of\nproblem behaviors may be reduced.14\nCorrespondence: Jen Jen Chang, PhD, Department of\nCommunity Health in Epidemiology, Saint Louis Uni-\nversity School of Public Health, 3545 Lafayette Ave, Suite\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Chang had full access to all\nthe data in the study and takes responsibility for the in-\ntegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nStudyconceptanddesign:Chang.Acquisitionofdata:Chang.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Chang, Halpern, and\nKaufman.
