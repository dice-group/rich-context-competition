The studio pitched\nthe prospective title as a `stealth survival'action game to be designed specifically for Apple\niPad, iPhone and iPod Touch hardware, incorporating a control scheme that would uniquely\nutilise these devices' touch-screen inputs (Camouflaj, 2012). The Kickstarter community's\nresponse to the project was initially mixed, with many users voicing disappointment con-\ncerning the absence of a proposed desktop version of the title (Payton, 2012). At around the\nmidway point of its campaign to raise US$500,000, Camouflaj significantly altered its pitch,\npromising PC and Mac incarnations of R\u00e9publique, in addition to the already proposed iOS\nversions. `We have heard you guys. We have adjusted our strategy', Camouflaj co-founder\nRyan Payton (Berghammer, 2012) announced via a Kickstarter campaign video update. As\npart of this change in strategy, Camouflaj pledged not to merely port over to desktop com-\nputers a game intended primarily for Apple's portable touch-screen devices; instead, it set\nout to deliver a unique version of R\u00e9publique specifically designed for PC and Mac `featur-\ning new gameplay and story elements that speak to the strengths of the platform'\nThe example of R\u00e9publique, which went on to successfully meet its funding goal and\nwhich was released in iOS form in 2013, indicates two distinct routes by which crowdfund-\ning communities can influence video game development processes. First, the example\nclearly suggests that project backers influenced R\u00e9publique through providing Camouflaj\nwith the financial resources necessary for development to proceed; simply put, without\nKickstarter support, this is a game which might not have otherwise been made.1 But, second,\nthe example of R\u00e9publique also suggests that interaction between developers and crowd-\nfunding communities has the capacity to inform in highly specific ways the creative direc-\ntions that a development project takes. In the case of R\u00e9publique, Kickstarter users'requests\nfor PC and Mac versions of the game led not only to Camouflaj acceding to these requests;\nthey further motivated the studio to rethink a design concept tailored for touch-screen mobile\ndevices with the aim of ensuring that PC and Mac versions complement the technological\nThis article explores in particular this second route by which crowdfunding communi-\nties determine video game production; that is, through the interactions that typically\noccur between studios and prospective players as part of crowdfunded development pro-\ncesses. As we shall see, such interactions typify video game development within the\ncrowdfunding sphere. The economic model of crowdfunding indeed appears to necessi-\ntate developers of a given project to frequently interact with actual or prospective project\nbackers, if only so as to either appeal to the latter or satisfy the former. Developers are\ngenerally expected to provide crowdfunding communities with deep, regular insight into\nthe development process, while absorbing and responding to their feedback.\nThe seemingly transparent production processes that crowdfunding entails can be\nconsidered as distinct from those that often accompany the conventional publisher-\nfunded model; this being a model that continues to underpin development of many of the\nvideo game industry's largest-selling titles. Via this model, major publishers such as\nSony, Nintendo, Activision and Electronic Arts limit interaction between the develop-\nment process and prospective players. Instead of facilitating an ongoing open dialogue\nbetween studios and players, publishers will usually communicate selected information\nregarding a forthcoming title via carefully timed trailers, screen-shots, press releases,\njournalistic interviews with development teams and so on. Publishers furthermore tend\nto mediate activities designed to procure feedback from prospective players, such as\nfocus group research. While there are useful studies that connect the prevalent publisher\nmodel to development practices (De Peuter and Dyer Witheford, 2005; Dovey and\nKennedy, 2006: 43\u00ad62), an investigation into the links between video game development\nand the industry's burgeoning crowdfunding model is so far absent.\nThrough its examination of how relationships between studios and crowdfunding\ncommunities impact upon video game development, this article aims to provide an origi-\nnal perspective on the links between production practices and economic models. To meet\nthis aim, the article explores a sample of Kickstarter-funded video game development\nprojects. This sample incorporates R\u00e9publique, The Long Dark (in development), The\nMighty No. 9 (in development), Godus (in development), Star Citizen (in development),\nElite: Dangerous (in development), Shadowrun Online (in development) and Sir, You\nAre Being Hunted (2014). These particular games have been selected so as to ensure that\nthe sample represents a diverse range of video game genres and project sizes. In terms of\ngenre, for example, the titles range from strategy (Godus) to stealth (R\u00e9publique, Sir, You\nAre Being Hunted) and from space simulator (Star Citizen, Elite: Dangerous) to side-\nscrolling action (The Mighty No. 9). In terms of project scale, the amount of crowdfund-\ning that each project has received ranges from the relatively modest (\u00a392,551 for Sir, You\nAre Being Hunted [Farokhmanesh, 2012]) to the record-breaking (Star Citizen has, at\nthis time of writing, received more than US$48m [ConsoleTuner, 2014]).\nDrawing from evidence of production concerning these projects \u00ad in the form of existing\npromotional and journalistic material, as well as three original interviews conducted with\ndevelopment-studio bosses \u00ad the article traces the influence that Kickstarter backers (and\nprospective backers) exert upon development.2 Via this case study, it ultimately argues that\nthe crowdfunding model enables project backers to significantly influence the creative deci-\nsions that studios make within development processes, thus distinguishing the crowdfund-\ning production mode from that of traditional publisher funding. Prior to this case study,\nhowever, the following section situates this article within broader scholarship regarding the\nrole of players in video game production so as to appropriately contextualise discussion\nconcerning the role that crowdfunding communities serve within development.\nContexts: players, production and participation\nupon the ways in which players engage with video games; key examples of this approach\ninclude studies into the myriad social and professional player practices that develop around\nseen a related interest emerge concerning the ways in which players interact with video\ngame development processes. Such scholarship includes John Banks' (2013) wide-ranging\nstudy of collaborative activity \u00ad or what he refers to as `co-creative' processes \u00ad between\nplayers and developers. This scholarship also incorporates literature more tightly focused on\nspecific player practices linked to production.Anotable example would be the body of work\nconcerning the activity of modding (i.e. modifying) published video game content\non players' interaction with production furthermore connects to broader discussions con-\ncerning audience creativity within the contemporary media industries (Burgess and Green,\nA key debate within scholarship regarding media users' involvement in media produc-\ntion, including such involvement as players' interactions with video game companies, con-\ncerns the implications of these practices for media users. As Lin Zhang and Anthony Y.H.\nFung (2013) observe, academic discourses on this topic have largely revolved around two\ncontrasting perspectives. On one hand, scholars highlight the exploitative aspect of co-crea-\ntive processes whereby users serve as `free labour' (Terranova, 2000) for media companies\nand therefore submit, albeit often willingly, to an unequal power structure. Companies profit\nfrom users' productive activities via this structure, while co-creators receive little to no\nfinancial reimbursement for their efforts and no claims on intellectual property rights for the\nthe other hand, scholars emphasise the (non-monetary) rewards that users earn via co-crea-\ntive activity such as the feelings of gratification resulting from their creativity and the pleas-\nures of feeling part of a user community (Poor, 2013; Postigo, 2003). This perspective\nfurthermore draws attention to the agency that users are often able to exert and enjoy as part\nof their relationships with media companies (Banks and Humphreys, 2008; Banks and Potts,\n2010; Green and Jenkins, 2011). While this article is primarily concerned with how interac-\ntions between crowdfunding communities and development studios shape video game con-\ntent, it nevertheless considers, in addition, the ways in which these interactions relate to\nthese differing perspectives.\nA further significant feature of scholarship centred on players' involvement with\nvideo game production is its dominant focus on the relationships between players and\nstudios that transpire following the commercial release of a title. The body of work there-\nfore speaks to the increasingly persistent nature of video game production. As Aphra\nKerr (2013) observes, `Production does not stop when a product is launched in the mar-\nketplace ... We need to see production as an ongoing process' (pp. 25\u00ad26), which typi-\ncally includes some form of player input. This input could take the form of data\nconcerning gaming behaviour, for instance, which might result in a studio updating a\ngame.3 Or it could take the form of players' social media protests influencing changes to\na published title.4 Or it could take the form of in-game user-generated content, or key\nparatextual material such as wikis, walkthroughs and `let's play' videos. As a conse-\nquence of these and other player practices, video games are thus, observes Kerr (2013),\n`technical artefacts' that `change over time', with this change in part `induced or pro-\nduced by users and/or their knowledge, or knowledge about them, and their labour' (p.\n27).5 Scholarly focus on these relationships between players and developers following a\ngame's release is most welcome; yet comparatively little attention has so far been given\nto the interactions between studios and prospective players prior to a game's launch. By\nexploring, in particular, the interactions between developers and crowdfunding commu-\nnities that occur prior to release, this article thus establishes a useful vantage on relation-\nships between players and studios at early stages of production.\nThe fact that there has so far been relatively little discussion concerning player interac-\ntion within production prior to a game's release likely reflects the traditionally limited nature\nof such interaction within development. This separation between player and studio is evi-\ndent in, for example, Kerr's (2002) research into the investor-funded development of an\nonline strategy game. In this case (Kerr, 2002), developers had little engagement with users\nprior to beta testing; they appeared instead `to have reached their target market by designing\nfor themselves and relying upon implicit and intuitive representations of players' (p. 291).6\nThere are, certainly, various counter examples to this practice. The development studio\nAuran, for instance, engaged strongly with a community of online rail enthusiasts prior to\nlaunching its investor-funded train simulator title (Banks, 2013: 66\u00ad77); this dedicated\ngroup, observes Banks (2013), provided `useful feedback' that helped `guide and define\nongoing development' (p. 72). A further example would be the production of LucasArts'\nStar Wars Galaxies, during which the project's creative director, Ralph Koster, founded a\nco-creative relationship with the large online community that formed around the develop-\nthat is operated by large publishers and video game console manufacturers, publishers medi-\nate interaction between developers and prospective players (Kerr, 2013: 26). Via this model,\npublishers and developers furthermore restrict the public dissemination of information con-\ncerning production. While, with Star Wars Galaxies, Koster (2006) endeavoured to operate\na transparent and inclusive production process, he observes that his approach is atypical:\n`These days', he says, `it's accepted wisdom that you don't reveal a [game] feature until it's\ndone, so as to guarantee that you never let the players down'. Yosuke Matsuda (Williams,\n2013), senior executive managing director of the publisher Square Enix, concurs with this\nview that standard publisher practice restricts developers' communication with prospective\nplayers. Via this approach, he notes, `Customers wait for years with little to no\ninformation'.\nDevelopment processes within the crowdfunding space, which are typified by an ongo-\ning dialogue between developers and players, thus operate in contrast to traditional produc-\ntion practices. Developers furthermore discursively frame these opportunities for backer\nengagement in highly positive terms. According to many developers, one of the benefits of\nthis increased connection between studios and player communities is the constructive influ-\nence the latter can exert on development. For example, on the day his studio secured\nKickstarter financing for its sci-fi role-playing game Consortium, Interdimensional Games\nCEO Gregory MacMartin (Zellmer, 2013) suggested that contributor participation could\nenhance production. `We now have a community of gamers that are eager to join us in these\nfinal months of development to help us shape this interactive experience', he said. Hinterland\nGames creative director Raphael van Lierop (2013, personal communication) similarly sug-\ngests that the process of `ongoing dialogue' between developer and backer as part of the\ncrowdfunding process can positively influence development. Concerning the creation of his\nstudio's Kickstarter-backed first-person survival adventure The Long Dark, van Lierop\n(2013, personal communication) claims that direct interaction with the backer community\nwill enable the developer to `make a better game'.Veteran developer Keiji Inafune (Comcept\nUSA, 2013), whose studio achieved Kickstarter funding for its two-dimensional (2D)\naction-platformer Mighty No. 9, also views the participatory culture that the crowdfunding\nsphere facilitates as a boon to production. `I think Kickstarter is an amazing system allowing\ngame creators and fans to connect, communicate and create things \u00ad together', he says.\nDevelopers often use such enthusiastic discourses regarding crowdfunded co-creative\nprocesses as a way to promote their projects through the promise of participation, and so\ntheir celebratory tone should be considered with some degree of scepticism. Nevertheless,\nthese claims do raise a particular question; namely, how does this co-creativity operate\nwithin crowdfunded video game production? Or, to put it another way, precisely how\ndoes the involvement of crowdfunding communities within development contribute, as\nclaimed, to the `making', `shaping' and `creating' of video games? Through its examina-\ntion of the ways in which relationships between studios and players inform development\nprocesses, these are questions that the following case study aims to directly address. The\nstudy is organised into two distinct sections, with each section concerned with a separate\ndistinct phase of interaction between a given studio and a Kickstarter community. These\ntwo phases are the campaign phase and the post-campaign phase. The following section\nfocuses on the campaign phase specifically, which relates to that period in which a\nKickstarter campaign is occurring.\nBacker\u00addeveloper interaction: Campaign phase\nHaving revealed initial details of its proposed project, and having set a funding target that\nmust be met in order for any monies to be received, the development studio in the cam-\npaign phase is typically engaged in sustained communication with the Kickstarter com-\nmunity. The length of this phase is variable and determined by the studio, but 30-day\ndurations or similar are common. As part of a campaign, a studio will usually provide an\nin-depth outline regarding details of the proposed game on its Kickstarter project page.\nIt will also likely drip-feed additional project details via updates on this page, thus poten-\ntially sustaining the community's interest, while also possibly extending the coverage\nthat the project will receive within the online gaming press. Such updates might include\nthe reveal of new concept art or an announcement regarding the recruitment to the devel-\nopment team of a popular creative talent, such as a cult composer or voice artist. But the\nstudio is also likely to respond to queries and feedback from the community via the com-\nments section attached to its project page, as well as via email and social media.\nAs part of a campaign, a community is also able to communicate directly to a studio\nvia these same electronic means, voicing support, queries and/or concerns. Often this\nwill lead to a studio responding in turn with clarification or elaboration concerning its\npreviously established development strategy. However, community feedback can also\nresult in a studio course-correcting its outlined plans. This is evident in the aforemen-\ntioned case of R\u00e9publique. It was community pressure that contributed to Camouflaj\nopting to develop the title for PC and Mac, in addition to iOS touch-screen devices; it\nwas this pressure in turn that ultimately led to the studio rethinking aspects of design so\nas to take into account the specific hardware specifications of desktop platforms. One\nkey example of the way in which Camouflaj has looked to exploit the specificities of PC\nand Mac computers relates to how the player interacts within the fiction of R\u00e9publique,\nthe premise of which concerns the fate of Hope \u00ad a character trapped within a totalitarian\nstate. Within the iOS version of the game, the player is charged with hacking and manip-\nulating surveillance devices within the game world, such as security cameras, so as to\nguide Hope. Following the decision to develop the title for desktop computers, the studio\nbegan to consider the unique ways in which PC and Mac versions might permit the\nplayer to utilise the game world surveillance devices. The studio, for example, envisaged\nthe player of the PC and Mac version being able to have multiple windows simultane-\nously open on a single screen, with each window providing the perspective of a particu-\nlar game world security camera or map, which is a design feature that would be untenable\non an iOS small screen device (Berghammer, 2012).7 In this case, Kickstarter community\ninput during the campaign phase ultimately led to Camouflaj deliberating design features\nconcerning platforms for which it had previously no intention to develop.\nThis case of Kickstarter community feedback leading to a studio changing direction\nwithin the campaign phase is not an isolated one. A further example would be Cliffhanger\nProductions' Kickstarter-funded Shadowrun Online, a massively multiplayer online role-\nplaying game (MMORPG) set within a cyberpunk fictional universe. While, with\nR\u00e9publique, Camouflaj altered its platform release strategy, in the case of Shadowrun\nOnline's campaign phase, Cliffhanger Productions transformed the game's proposed reve-\nnue model. Shadowrun Online had originally been conceived as a `free-to-play'(F2P) game.\nVia this model, which has become increasingly popular for MMORPGs in recent years,\nplayers do not pay money up front so as to play a given MMO; instead, the player is usually\nable to purchase with real money fictional in-game items (such as weapons and outfits),\nwhich might enable the player to progress more easily within the game. But many members\nof the Kickstarter community responded negatively to Cliffhanger Productions' proposed\nadoption of this model, suggesting the scheme imbued a `pay-to-win'component within the\ndesign; in other words, the community members feared that those players who spent the\nmost money on in-game items might have an advantage during player versus player (PvP)\ncombat encounters (Cliffhanger Productions, 2012). Following the community's voicing of\nthis concern, the developer altered its business plan 6days into Shadowrun Online's cam-\npaign launch, proposing a so-called campaign revenue model designed to operate alongside\nthe free-to-play model. Via the proposed campaign model, players can pay a one-time fee of\nUS$39.99, allowing them to purchase any in-game items via an in-game currency (to be\nearned through the playing of the game). The introduction of the campaign model to the\nShadowrun Online project, then, altered the design of the proposed multiplayer experience\nby reducing the potential for players to purchase their way to victory as part of mismatched\nPvP encounters. This shift in economic model was furthermore apparently a direct response\nto Kickstarter community disquiet. As Cliffhanger Productions (2012) stated when it\nrevealed the campaign model via Kickstarter update, `We had the game originally planned\nwith the free-to-play model ... but if you think differently \u00ad we adapt'.\nThese two cases provide some indication concerning the ways in which interaction\nbetween developers and crowdfunding communities during a Kickstarter campaign can\ninfluence studio strategy and more specifically approaches to game design. Such\ninstances of studios disrupting carefully conceived plans in response to such interactions\nmight be seen as reflective of producers having embraced the ethos of co-creativity that\nmuch of the video game industry prohibits, yet which crowdfunding processes enable.\nBut developers'modifications of development strategy during the campaign phase might\nbe simultaneously understood as pragmatically serving studios' economic interests. On\none hand, such changes permit studios to discursively position themselves during cam-\npaigns as being highly responsive to Kickstarter community feedback (`we adapt'; `We\nheard you guys'); such activity in turn has the potential to increase the attractiveness of\na studio to those many community members desiring a degree of involvement in a given\ndevelopment process. As Hinterland Games' van Lierop (2013, personal communica-\ntion) suggests, the promise of co-creation appears to be a key factor motivating financial\ncontributions to video game projects; `Backers are ... pledging to feel like they are part\nof the process of creating the game', he observes. By taking clear actions in response to\nfeedback received during a campaign phase, studios clearly signal their openness to co-\ncreative activities. On the other hand, it is \u00ad in certain circumstances \u00ad the nature of the\nparticular change in development strategy itself that can serve a key economic purpose\nduring the campaign phase. In the case of R\u00e9publique, for example, Camouflaj's specific\ndecision to develop for desktop computers, in addition to iOS devices, appears to have\nbeen integral to the project reaching its funding target. The Kickstarter campaign had\nstruggled throughout much of its duration, but, according to Payton (2012), it was the\npromise of desktop versions that reversed the campaign's fortunes `and pushed us over\nthe line'.8 At least in some cases, then, studios might regard specific alterations to devel-\nopment plans \u00ad in response to the demands of a crowdfunding community \u00ad as steps\nhighly necessary to achieving funding goals.\nThe case of R\u00e9publique, together with that of Shadowrun Online, furthermore indi-\ncates the potential for crowdfunding communities to exert a high level of control over a\nproject's direction within a given campaign phase; this appears to be especially the case\nif a campaign is struggling to meet its funding target. Via the conventional publisher\nmodel, prospective players typically have no direct input regarding decisions related to\nintended hardware platform or revenue model. Publishers will instead typically form\ntheir decisions on the basis of sales data. Yet, in the crowdfunding space, prospective\nplayers have been able to induce fundamental changes in studio strategy with regard to\nthese issues, essentially establishing a project's boundaries for the post-campaign phase.\nThis high degree of agency whereby backers or potential backers can dictate the fun-\ndamental directions a project takes should not be considered typical within co-creative\npractices. With regard to the production of user-generated content, for example, both\nKerr (2013) and Andrew Mactavish (2008) observe the tight control that publishers are\nable to exert over the creative agency of its consumers (for instance, through publishers'\nownership and modification of such content). However, as John Banks and Jason Potts\n(2010) argue, player agency as part of co-creative processes is not always constrained\nwithin a rigid publisher-imposed framework. There are instead, they observe (Banks and\nPotts, 2010), circumstances in which the `consumer is an agent, able to make a deal' (p.\n257). R\u00e9publique and Shadowrun Online's respective campaign phases provide exam-\nples of agency being exerted in such circumstances.\nThe cycle of communication between studio and crowdfunding community that typi-\nfies the campaign phase usually carries over into the post-campaign phase. Studios of\nKickstarter-funded projects will likely issue written and video updates to their backers\nvia emails, social media and project page posts. Studios are indeed often obliged to do\nso, as many Kickstarter projects during a campaign phase promise exclusive updates to\nbackers as reward for their patronage. Backers of successful Kickstarter campaigns, in\nturn, often continue to offer ideas, opinions and criticisms to the studio via the same\nchannels of communication. But, as the following section discusses, the post-campaign\nphase sees some studios and crowdfunding communities engage in different types of\ninteraction, as the former often looks to increase the latter's level of involvement with the\ndevelopment process in various structured ways.\nBacker\u00addeveloper interaction: Post\u00adcampaign phase\nIn the post-campaign phase, developers often seek to harness feedback on a large scale,\nwith this often being achieved through the online polling of backers regarding aspects of\ndesign. For example, the studio Comcept, as part of the Mighty No. 9 development,\ninvited its backer community to select from a number of options the costume design and\nphysical appearance of a particular in-game character (Karam et al., 2013). In other\ncases, however, studios'polling of backers can be a far more in-depth process. In the case\nof Frontier's Kickstarter-funded development of the space-travel simulator Elite:\nDangerous, for example, the studio solicited feedback concerning a wide range of fine\ndetails, such as fuel consumption rates and the speed levels of particular flight modes, via\nIn some instances, the practice of polling and surveying the community has resulted in\ndevelopers significantly shifting their approaches to content creation. This occurred, for\nexample, early in Cloud Imperium Games' development of its Kickstarter-funded space\ntrading and combat simulator Star Citizen.As part of a poll, the studio asked backers to each\nselect their preferred role within the `open-world'game, so as to discern the type of in-game\nactivities that players would gravitate towards. The category `explorer' topped the poll,\nwhich motivated a change of approach within development. The studio had previously\nassumed that players would prioritise combat-related gameplay, such as spaceship battles,\nand so had been focussed on developing content that would be appropriate for such a prefer-\nence (Nutt, 2013). However, due to this poll result, the studio turned its attention to develop-\ning a greater amount of content for those players who wanted to explore the galaxies of the\ngame's fictional universe. According to Cloud Imperium Games' founder Chris Roberts\n(Nutt, 2013), who worked previously at Microsoft and Electronic Arts, such significant\ninformation regarding player preference would not have been known to the development\nteam had the studio been working via the conventional publisher model.\nDespite Roberts' claim here regarding the deficiencies of the conventional model, pub-\nlishers nevertheless do typically carry out various activities that bear similarity to these post-\ncampaign interactions that play out between backers and crowdfunded studios. Publishers,\nfor example, will often carry out in-house market research, as well as recruit specialist third-\nparty companies to conduct polls, surveys and focus groups (Kline et al., 2003: 202). But,\nfrom Roberts'point of view, due to the often-large size of a given backer community and its\nhigh engagement with a project, community feedback has the potential to be more useful\nthan that emerging from publisher-commissioned research. According to Roberts (Nutt,\n2013), the Star Citizen community, for example, serves as a far superior focus group than\none that a publisher would traditionally put together. `Normally, at a publisher, you get a\nrecruited focus group and it's got 30 people in it', says Roberts (Nutt, 2013):\nAnd who the hell knows if that's a good focus group for your game? But when you've got\nready, you've probably got a good focus group.\nIn addition to polling and surveying its community, using its feedback as a `barometer'\nas Roberts (Bertz, 2013) puts it, crowdfunded studios sometimes involve backers in the\npost-campaign phase by providing access to test builds. These `alpha'and `beta'versions of\na game are assembled prior to release, but studios will often grant backers access to them as\n`reward' for their pledges. Backers are furthermore encouraged to feed back opinions to\ndevelopers formed on the basis of their own experiences with the test builds, which can lead\nto developers reworking aspects of design. The post-campaign phase of development studio\nBig Robot's first-person stealth game Sir, You Are Being Hunted serves as an example of\nsuch processes.According to Big Robot's founder Jim Rossignol (2013, personal communi-\ncation), backer feedback concerning the game's alpha code influenced changes regarding\n`user experience elements'. One such change relates to how the game signals to players the\nlocation and artificial intelligence state of enemy non-playing characters (NPCs). As part of\nthe game's fiction, enemy NPCs take the form of robot hunters that track the player-charac-\nter across a rural landscape. Within the initial alpha build, players were only able to identify\nthe presence and AI behavioural state of those robots out of view by way of audio cues.\nHowever, following concern from some backers that this aspect of design led to a game that\nwas perhaps too challenging, as well as one prohibitive towards the hard of hearing, Bad\nRobot added optional `visual indicators' to the user interface. These indicators signal to\nplayers the location of robots that might be obscured by buildings or hills, as well as alert\nplayers via symbols to changes in robot AI states, such as when a robot spots a player and\napproaches them. Rossignol (2013, personal communication) confirms that such usability\nchanges were dependent on backer input gleaned via players' engagement with Sir's alpha\nbuild. `Decisions such as these would never have been made it if had been left to us', he said\n(2013, personal communication), `and we've had to be told by a number of players that such\nchanges were required'.\nThe practice of providing backers with access to alpha and beta versions furthermore\nassists the development studio's quality assurance (QA) testing procedure, which aims to\nresolve any in-game bugs or glitches. For larger publisher-funded projects, it is often a com-\nbination of a publisher's QAdepartment, a developer's dedicated QAteam, as well as groups\nof temporary freelance testers, that carries out this process (Kline et al., 2003: 203). However,\nfor small independent development studios, of which many have recently turned to\nKickstarter for project financing, such dedicated personnel are often absent from the pro-\ncess. Therefore, developers sometimes rely on those backers engaged with alpha and beta\nbuilds to report any programming errors.9 Because of the nature of certain game design\nconcepts, such player input can be invaluable, as has been the case, for example, with the\ndevelopment of Sir You Are Being Hunted. One of the title's core design features is its pro-\ncedurally generated game world, which ensures that each play through of the game gener-\nates a unique version of the landscape. This variability of game world made it extremely\ndifficult for Big Robot's small team to track bugs across myriad variations in level design.\nAs Rossignol observes (2013, personal communication), `An issue might appear one in a\nthousand generations, and if only three of us are generating levels, we'll never see it'.\nHowever, the project's large community of backers essentially provided a QA solution to\nthis challenge. Notes Rossignol (2013, personal communication):\nIf five thousand people are generating levels then the chances of spotting serious issues are\nincreased, and in that way the backers getting early access and examining the game as it's being\nworked on ends up improving the end result.\nIn the post-campaign phase, then, backers often continue to serve a role in develop-\nment, taking on dual roles as volunteer playtesters and sounding boards for studio ideas.\nIn these cases, Kickstarter backers have not only fully or part financed development but\nthey are also freely performing particular and necessary production tasks, which \u00ad via the\nconventional publisher model \u00ad would typically require payment. For some developers,\nit is this arrangement whereby a community of backers can contribute en masse to devel-\nopment within the post-campaign phase that makes crowdfunding an especially attrac-\ntive source of financing. This is the view of veteran video game developer Peter\nMolyneux, for example, whose studio 22Cans received Kickstarter backing for its `god\ngame'Godus. According to Molyneux, the Kickstarter process represents an opportunity\nto not only gain funding but also harness the input capacity of a community of backers in\nthe post-campaign phase. Molyneux (nofi, 2012) indeed suggests that the developer con-\nfigured its campaign with this aim in mind, ensuring that all but the lowest value cam-\npaign pledge tiers provided backers with access to the Godus alpha and beta builds.\nThe real secret to making games is simple: you get as many people you can to play the game\nfor as long as possible as you develop ... Kickstarter is not just about getting money it's about\ntruly involving people in a structured way to make the best experience.\nSuch examples of interaction between backers and studios during the post-campaign\nphase do not, however, characterise all Kickstarter-funded development projects. In\nsome cases, studios are less inclined to firmly integrate backers into the development\nprocess, as was the case with Camouflaj during the post-campaign development phase of\nR\u00e9publique, for example. As Payton (2013, personal communication) acknowledges,\n`Our communication with our backers is most often one-way. We reply to all the mes-\nsages that come in, but we haven't put a lot of focus on creating a forum for back-and-\nforth with the community'. The studio's decision not to rely on backer input during this\nperiod appears to have been down to two related reasons. First, the studio did not view\nR\u00e9publique, which was in part conceived as a carefully structured narrative experience,\nas being a type of game that would especially benefit from a co-creative process; second,\nthe studio did not regard the co-creative process as being compatible with the studio aim\nof maintaining a strong degree of institutional authorship over this narrative experience.\nSays Payton (2013, personal communication):\nIt's not that we don't care what the community has to say, but rather, I think it's because of\nthe type of project we're developing. For a strategy or multiplayer game like Godus, I think\nit makes a lot of sense to have a constant stream of dialogue between the development team\nand the backers ... Due to the narrative-focus of R\u00e9publique and our team's desire (from the\nvery beginning) to break away from large companies and just make the game we've always\nwanted to make, we haven't reached out to the community for design feedback as much as\nother projects.\nPayton (Reynolds, 2013) further stresses that key design challenges Camouflaj faced\nduring development, which related to R\u00e9publique's unique touch-screen gameplay, were\nnot challenges that the game's backers were well equipped to assist with. He observes,\n`We knew we couldn't rely on [backers] to help us solve complex design problems that\neven our veteran crew was fighting to solve'.\nThe case of R\u00e9publique is instructive in considering the relationship between backers\nand studios as part of the post-campaign phase. It indicates that the variability of project\ntype, as well as developers' particular attitudes towards the creative process, can inform\nthe extent to which these two groups interact. More generally, the other cases featured\nwithin this section suggest that backer input within this phase can be highly structured.\nIn various crowdfunded development processes discussed here, backers furthermore\nserved roles that have analogues within more conventional development practice. The\nStar Citizen backer community was utilised as a superior focus group within the game's\ndevelopment (but as a focus group nonetheless). The Sir You Are Being Hunted backer\ncommunity, meanwhile, has performed a role comparable to that of a QA department.\nThe top-down structures imposed in the post-campaign phase thus contrast with the\nbacker\u00addeveloper power dynamic of the campaign phase, whereby crowdfunding com-\nmunities have the potential to insist on significant changes in development (as in the\ncases of R\u00e9publique and Shadowrun Online). By setting the terms by which co-creativity\noccurs within the post-campaign phase, developers ensure that backer input becomes\npart of the wider co-creative practice of what Mactavish (2008) labels `authorized pro-\nduction'. But while developers'control over the nature of backer input might weaken the\nagency of crowdfunding communities, it does not necessarily lessen the impact that their\ninput has on a project's creative direction. The case of Star Citizen community poll-\nresults motivating Cloud Imperium Games to generate a raft of new in-game content, for\nexample, indeed indicates that the potential for backer influence persists within the post-\ncampaign phase.\nConclusion\nThis article reveals how co-creativity within video game development plays out\nwithin the crowdfunding space. It highlights ways in which these processes depart\nfrom conventional practices carried out in publisher-funded production. While direct\ncommunication between studios and prospective players during development is,\nunder the purview of publishers, often limited, interaction between these two social\ngroups is ongoing from the early stages of development in the crowdfunding sphere.\nThis article shows how communications between studios and prospective players dur-\ning crowdfunding campaigns can instigate significant shifts concerning proposed pro-\nject details, as was the case with the R\u00e9publique and Shadowrun Online campaigns.\nThe campaign phase is thus not only a period in which a studio looks to secure fund-\ning for its development project and form a community around it; this is also a period\nin which developers and prospective players can negotiate and contest the parameters\nof a project. In the post-campaign phase, as the article further indicates, studios often\norganise their production so as to channel backer communities' input in highly struc-\ntured ways. Soliciting feedback from backers via polls, and recruiting backers as test-\ners, studios often ensure that crowdfunding communities serve important roles\nthroughout the development process.\nWhile this study reveals a range of insights concerning the relationship between\ndevelopment studios and backer communities, further scholarship is necessary regarding\nvideo game development in the crowdfunding space. Gaining perspectives on additional\naspects of this industrial process \u00ad including social groups other than studios and backers\n\u00ad would be a useful next step. Research into how studios balance the need of backers\nwith, for example, those of the professional investors that are increasingly contributing\nadditional funding to crowdfunded projects might be advantageous.10 Attention might\nalso be given to the strategies studios deploy so as to ensure that their content will be\nappropriate for a wider gaming audience on release, while simultaneously satisfying\ntheir core crowdfunding community. Such lines of enquiry would help establish a more\ndetailed understanding concerning the specificities of the crowdfunding model and its\nimplications to video game production.\nTaking a wider perspective on the rise of digital crowdfunding, further research is also\nrequired to understand the implications of crowdfunding processes for backers \u00ad academic\nwork that would benefit from the interviewing of crowdfunding community members. As\nthis article acknowledges, the interactions between development studios and backer com-\nmunities form part of a far larger field of co-creativity involving media companies and\nmedia users. Yet the requirement for backers to contribute money directly to development\ndistinguishes crowdfunded processes from many other examples of co-creativity. While a\nmodder or a fan fiction writer or message board user might willingly enable media compa-\nnies to profit from their activities without receiving any payment in return, crowdfunding\ncommunities are in addition often paying for the opportunity to function as free labour.\nDespite serving as the financial impetus for many development projects, backers are further-\nmore not only without ownership of content they have helped finance, but they are also\nwithout monetary protection should a funded video game project go on to be cancelled\n(Gera, 2012). Detailed consideration of the specificities of digital crowdfunding, and the\nimplications of these specific features for crowdfunding communities, is thus necessary to\nfurther inform wider debates concerning the role of users in media production.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\n 1. Payton (Reynolds, 2013) speculates that, without financial backing from the Kickstarter com-\nmunity, the game `would never have seen the light of day'.\n 2. The three original interviews were conducted via email Q&A. The three interviewees were\nRyan Payton, co-founder of Camouflaj, which developed R\u00e9publique (interview conducted,\n29 October 2013); Jim Rossignol, founder of Big Robot, which developed Sir, You Are Being\nHunted (interview conducted, 7 January 2014); and Raphael van Lierop, creative director of\nHinterland Games, which is currently developing The Long Dark (interview conducted, 21\n 3. The developer Rockstar North, for example, carried out maintenance on the online compo-\nnent of Grand Theft Auto V so as to curb the player practice of creating and disseminating\ncounterfeit in-game money (Makuch, 2014).\n 4. For example, online player protests regarding the narrative conclusion of Mass Effect 3 led\nto its developer BioWare producing downloadable content that augments the original ending\n 5. This line of thinking regarding video game production parallels theoretical moves within the field\nto understand video games not as permanent objects but rather as continual processes (Malaby,\n2007) or as changeable cultural facilities (Consalvo, 2009) that alter via player engagement.\n 6. Philippe Ross (2014) considers in depth the theoretical implications of this practice whereby\nmedia producers conceptualise an intended audience absent from production processes.\n 7. Whether or not this and other discussed features are ultimately implemented within the desktop\nversions of R\u00e9publique remains to be seen. At the time of writing, while the iOS version of the\ngame has been released, the PC and Mac versions are still in development, with the Camouflaj\nteam yet to determine the precise direction that the project will take (Crecente, 2014).\n 8. Data bear this view out, with approximately half of the project backers signalling their inten-\ntion to play the game on desktop versions (Payton, 2012).\n 9. The use of player communities as unpaid testers is not, however, a practice restricted to crowd-\nfunded projects. In the case of online multiplayer games, developers often recruit user communi-\n10. Warhorse studios' Kingdom Come: Deliverance (in development) is one such example of a\nproject being funded by a combination of crowdfunding and private investment (Hart, 2014).\nReferences\nAndrejevic M (2008) Watching television without pity: the productivity of online fans.
