We speak\nlanguage, routinely cooperate with others to reach complex shared goals, engage in abstract\nreasoning and scientific inquiry, and learn a rich set of sophisticated cultural behaviors\nfrom others. Why do we possess such abilities while other species do not? How do we\nacquire these abilities? One approach in answering these core questions has been to\nexamine the roots of human cognitive systems. The field of developmental psychology\nComparative developmental psychology\ninvestigates the origins of adult cognition through the study of infants and children,\nassessing how cognitive capacities emerge across ontogeny. This research has revealed that\nhuman cognitive development is shaped by capacities thought to be derived in our species,\nsuch as language and shared intentionality (Hermer-Vazquez, Moffet, and Munkholm,\nTomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, and Moll, 2005). The field of comparative psychology,\nin contrast, investigates the evolutionary origins of human cognition via research with\nhumans' closest living relatives, non-human primates, as well as other species of\nevolutionary interest. This field has shown that many primate species exhibit an array of\ncomplex abilities previously thought to be unique to humans, including reasoning about\nothers' perceptions and knowledge, episodic memory and planning, and the ability to use\nand create complex tools (Call, 2008; Flombaum and Santos, 2005; Humle and Matsuzawa,\nBoth developmental and comparative approaches have therefore been critical in\ngenerating and testing hypotheses regarding the origins of human-unique cognition. Yet\nlittle attention has been paid to the intersection of developmental and comparative inquiry:\nstudies of cognitive development across species. Though several researchers have\nhighlighted the importance of a comparative developmental perspective (Gomez, 2005;\n2006), this integrative comparative-developmental approach has not been widely applied in\nempirical work. Therefore, our current aim is to highlight the types of advances that\ncomparative developmental research can provide. In particular, we aim to show that\ncomparative developmental studies can contribute important insights into the origins of\nhuman cognition by illuminating the pace and pattern of cognitive development across\nspecies. We begin by examining theoretical models of how cognition can change across\nspecies via changes in the pace and pattern of development. We then outline how studies of\ncomparative cognitive development can bear on current open questions in both psychology\nand biology. Subsequently, we review empirical work incorporating comparative\ndevelopmental data in three cognitive domains: 1) reasoning about objects, 2) cognitive\nskills used in foraging contexts, and 3) social cognition. Finally, we conclude by\nidentifying unsolved questions that can be addressed using a comparative developmental\nframework. Overall, we argue that a comparative developmental approach is necessary to\nunderstand the origins of human cognition, including features of development that are\nunique to our species.\nChanges in the pace and pattern of development\nWe propose that evolutionary changes in development can alter cognitive abilities\nacross species via two main mechanisms: differences in the pace or timing of cognitive\ndevelopment, and differences in the pattern or structure of cognitive development. In terms\nof change in pace, much research in developmental psychology is concerned with the\ntiming of skill emergence across human ontogeny. Methodological advances over the past\n30 years have allowed scientists to probe the minds of even the youngest babies, showing\nthat infants have a sophisticated set of abilities for perceiving, categorizing, and reasoning\nComparative developmental psychology\nabout social agents (Gergely, Bekkering, and Kiraly, 2002; Gergely, Nadasdy, Csibra, and\nworld (Newcombe and Huttenlocher, 2005; Spelke, Breinlinger, Macomber, and Jacobson,\n(Feigenson, Dehaene, and Spelke, 2004; Wynn, 1998). Yet whereas some skills emerge\nearly in development, others have a much longer developmental trajectory. For example,\nwhereas younger children rely primarily on geometric information to reorient in an\nenvironment, older children construct novel, flexible representations of space that combine\nboth geometric and spatial information (Hermer and Spelke, 1994; Hermer-Vazquez et al.,\nLee and Spelke, 2010; Wang, Hermer, and Spelke, 1999). That is, different cognitive skills\ncan develop at different paces over ontogeny.\nFigure 1: Differences in pace of development across species\nNotes: In (a), Species X and Species Y initiate development with the same level of cognitive skill, but the\nfaster rate of skill acquisition in Species X results in a higher mature level of the cognitive skill compared\nto Species Y. In (b), both species exhibit similar cognitive developmental trajectories, but because the onset\nof development is delayed for Species Y, its mature cognitive skill level is lower than Species X. A similar\noutcome results if the temporal onset of development occurs at a similar age, but the initial skill level at\nthat onset differs between species. Finally, in (c) both species begin development at a similar age and\nexhibit similar trajectories, but because the developmental period is longer for Species X than Species Y,\nSpecies X exhibits a higher level of the skill.\nDespite extensive studies documenting the timing of cognitive development in\nhumans, little is known about how human pacing compares to that of other animals.\nUnderstanding developmental pacing across species can illuminate differences in\ndevelopmental start-points, or the earliest-emerging skills, as well as differences in the\nmeans by which later-emerging skills arise over development. Studies of evolutionary\nchanges in developmental timing, or heterochrony, suggest that there are three broad\ncategories of change in developmental pacing that can impact the expression of cognitive\nskills in mature individuals (Gould, 1977; Lieberman, Carlo, Leon, and Zollikofer, 2007;\nWobber, Wrangham, and Hare, 2010a). First, two species could differ in their rate of skill\nacquisition (Figure 1a), developing a skill for a comparable period of time across the\nlifespan, but at differing speeds. Second, two species could differ in their start point of\ndevelopment (Figure 1b), either because one species exhibits developmental changes in a\nskill at an earlier age than the other, or because one species already possesses a higher level\nof skill at the time when developmental change begins. Finally, two species could differ in\nComparative developmental psychology\nthe age or life stage at which cognitive development concludes (Figure 1c). That is, one\nspecies could exhibit a longer period of development compared to another. It is important\nto note that these possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, two species could\ndiffer across all of these features, or none of them.\nThe second major mechanism by which developmental changes could impact\ncognitive skills across species concerns the pattern of development, or differences in how\ndevelopment unfolds. In particular, a number of theories in psychology propose that\nspecific skills are essential prerequisites for the acquisition of other skills, therefore\nrequiring a specific pattern of development to acquire the mature adult skill level. For\nexample, in the area of theory of mind, young children have been found to exhibit a\nrelatively consistent pattern of success across different types of problems: children first\nbegin to understand that other people can have conflicting desires, then distinguish between\nothers' knowledge states, and finally understand that others may have different (or even\nfalse) beliefs about the world (Wellman and Liu, 2004, although see Onishi and\nBaillargeon, 2005). Similarly, in the physical domain, human children's capacities to track\nobjects have been found to progress in a consistent pattern as well: infants first represent\nhidden objects, then overcome the A-not-B error, and finally master more complex\nrelationships such as invisible displacement (Piaget, 1954). Some of these theories suggest\nthat earlier-emegring abilities provide a developmental scaffold for later-emerging abilities.\nHowever, it is currently unclear if these same patterns of development are shared across\nother species.\nFigure 2: Differences in the patterns of development across species\nNotes: In (a), Species X and Species Y differ in their developmental sequence. Although both species\nacquire the same set of skills, skill B is a prerequisite for C in Species X, whereas the reverse is true in\nSpecies Y. In (b), the two species exhibit different causal structures of the development of skills that\nemerge in the same order. In species X, skills B and C are dependent on the acquisition of skill A,\nwhereas in Species Y, skills B and C develop independently from skill A. Finally, in (c), Species Y\nexhibits a terminal addition: The acquisition of a later-emerging skill (D) is dependent on the emergence\nof skills A through C. However, this final skill does not emerge in Species X.\nThere are three broad categories in which patterns of cognitive development could\ndiffer across species. First, two species could differ in their order of skill acquisition\nComparative developmental psychology\n(Figure 2a). Here, early-emerging skills in one species could differ from the early-emerging\nskills in another. Second, two species could differ in the causal structure of skill\nacquisition, even if the general order of skills remains similar (Figure 2b). That is, later-\nemerging skills could be causally dependent on the acquisition of earlier-emerging skills in\none species, whereas these causal links could be missing in the comparison species. Finally,\nsome species could have terminal additions to their development, acquiring skills that are\nnot seen in other species (Figure 2c). Even if developmental patterns are similar in earlier\nphases of development, one species might acquire skills that never arise in other species.\nInsights from comparative development for psychology\nThe models described above indicate that studies of comparative development can\ntest psychological theories of human development. For example, some nativist theories of\nhuman development suggest that young infants possess a core set of fundamental, evolved\ncognitive capacities very early in life (e.g., Kinzler and Spelke, 2007). Others take a more\nconstructivist stance towards conceptual change, emphasizing the importance of learning-\nbased changes (Carey, 1985; Gopnik and Meltzoff, 1997; Tenenbaum, Griffiths, and Kemp,\n2006; Wellman and Gelman, 1992). Finally, developmental systems theories focus more on\nthe developmental process itself--that is, how the mechanisms supporting development\nhuman cognitive development make divergent predictions concerning the pace and pattern\nof development in non-human species.\nThe core knowledge theory, for example, suggests that some of the earliest-\nemerging skills in human infants reflect cognitive abilities that do not change significantly\nacross development (Kinzler and Spelke, 2007). This view argues that a small set of\ndomain-specific, experience-independent capacities forms the basis of our earliest\nunderstanding of the world, providing a scaffold on which later learning can build. Later in\ndevelopment, language may allow children to integrate old information in new ways\nframework, early similarities in core knowledge across species would predict that human\nand non-human infants should possess a similar set of domain-specific precocious\ncapacities in the first few months of life, exhibiting comparable pace and pattern in\ndevelopment during this period. Later in development, however, there should be more\nmarked divergences between the human and non-human pace and pattern of development\n(coinciding with emerging language skills). These language-dependent shifts in human\ncognitive development could occur via a prolonged developmental time course following\nlanguage emergence, or the terminal addition of novel skills (see Figures 1c and 2c).\nStudies of non-linguistic species can therefore target the degree to which language is\nnecessary for certain ontogenetic changes to occur, versus whether language facilitates the\nemergence of some skills without being strictly necessary, by examining if or when non-\nhumans acquire those skills.\nComparative developmental data can also test constructivist views of cognitive\ndevelopment, which hypothesize that cognitive skills may be fundamentally transformed\nacross ontogeny. These types of views suggest that infants undergo a process of conceptual\nchange throughout development such that their \"theories\" about the world are reorganized,\nComparative developmental psychology\nsuggest that these changes may occur via Bayesian learning, whereby infants update their\nprobability estimates for a hypothesis as they acquire additional evidence (Tenenbaum et\nal., 2006). Since Bayesian mechanisms support some types of learning across many species\n(Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Ma, Beck, Latham, and Pouget, 2006), the constructivist view\nwould imply that species differences in cognition might arise from differences in initial\nstart points (see Figure 1b) or in the total length of the developmental process (see Figure\n1c), rather than via differences in the rate or pattern of learning throughout development, as\nsuggested by nativist or core knowledge theories.\nInsights from comparative development for biology\nStudies of comparative cognitive development can also provide important insights\nfor biology. The comparative method has long been one of the most important tools in\nevolutionary biology for reconstructing historical processes that often cannot be directly\nobserved, such as evolution (Harvey and Purvis, 1991; Mayr, 1982). This method contrasts\ntraits across species (including cognitive abilities; MacLean et al., 2012) that have faced\ndiffering ecological or social pressures in order to understand how natural selection\ninfluenced the manifestation of those traits (Harvey and Purvis, 1991; Mayr, 1982). As\nsuch, comparative biology can address not just what differences exist between species (e.g.,\nthe phylogeny of traits), but also why those differences arose (the evolutionary function of\nStudies of comparative development have become increasingly important in the\nfield of evolutionary developmental biology, which has revealed that species differences in\nmature traits frequently arise through alterations in developmental trajectories (Gould,\n1977). In particular, novel traits are not typically created de novo. Rather, evolutionary\nshifts in the pattern and pace of developmental timing can generate variation among\nindividuals and, ultimately, between species. One example of this process is the origin of\nvariation in beak morphology across finch species living in the Galapagos Islands. As\ninitially documented by Charles Darwin (1854), finches in this archipelago possess beaks\nof differing length and breadth, allowing different species to feed on different types of\nfood. Recent research has revealed that these differences stem from variation in the\nexpression over development of a gene controlling calcium production during beak growth\n(Abzhanov et al., 2006). That is, changes in the developmental timing of this (shared) gene\ngenerate diversity in adult beak morphology.\nImportantly, this same approach used to examine morphological differences can be\napplied to cognitive or behavioral capacities. The human intellect has long been recognized\nas one of our species' most striking characteristics, creating an evolutionary puzzle for\ntheorists since Darwin (1871). Comparative developmental studies provide a novel means\nto understand how the human mind emerged, and in particular to assess whether differences\nin human cognition stem from evolutionary changes in our species' developmental\ntrajectories. More broadly, comparative studies of cognitive development allow complex\nbehavioral patterns to be broken down into their constituent cognitive processes, which\nmay be dissociable in terms of their differing developmental patterns. Thus, this approach\nfacilitates evolutionary analyses of cognition as an important biological trait that also\nComparative developmental psychology\nexhibits variation across species, much like morphological traits that have been the focus of\nprevious developmental work.\nEmpirical Approaches to Comparative Developmental Psychology\nThe previous sections highlighted how the comparative developmental approach\ncan address outstanding questions in psychology and biology, and proposed theoretical\nmodels of how variation in the pace and pattern of development can produce variation in\ncognitive abilities across species--including humans. In the current section, we apply these\nmodels to three empirical domains that have been the focus of recent research on\ncomparative development: 1) reasoning about objects, 2) foraging cognition, and 3) social\ncognition.\nDevelopment of object reasoning in primates\nSince Piaget's (1954) early work examining how human children come to\nunderstand that objects continue to exist when they are out of sight (e.g., object\npermanence), children's development of physical concepts has been an area of active\nresearch and debate. Some researchers claim that infants only acquire rich representations\nof objects by interacting with the physical world (Smith and Gasser, 2005), whereas others\nsuggest that, in the absence of direct evidence, even very young infants are equipped with\nsophisticated abilities to represent objects (Feigenson et al., 2004; Spelke et al., 1992).\nComparative developmental studies with other animals--whose interactions with the\nphysical world have both similarities and differences from those seen in humans--can\ntherefore address the role of experience in generating children's mature abilities to reason\nabout objects.\nOne of the first developmental studies of physical reasoning examined object\nclassification (Langer, 1980, 1986). This work identified a basic developmental pattern\nunderlying infants' object classification in spontaneous play behavior. During their first\nyear, infants play at creating sets of objects, and eventually form sets that share similar\nproperties. In the second year of life, children construct object sets with complex\nproperties, and in the third year they begin to relate objects physically--for example, by\nmaking buildings and bridges. Finally, in their fourth year, children play with multiple\nobject sets simultaneously and show mutability of sets, such as first sorting by color and\nthen later by material (Langer, 1980, 1986). These studies indicate that spontaneous play in\nhumans appears to have a relatively fixed pattern of development, with certain skills (such\nas sorting sets) emerging reliably before other skills (such as encoding multiple sets).\nDoes object play reflect a human-specific developmental trajectory, or do these\npatterns reflect a deeply rooted cognitive structure that other primates share? Studies of\nobject play in several species, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), capuchins (Cebus\napella), and longtailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), in fact suggest that their basic\norder of skill acquisition in object play is similar to that of human infants, even though\nthese species lack much of the experience with objects that human infants have (Hayashi\nSpinozzi and Natale, 1989). However, there are also important differences from humans.\nComparative developmental psychology\nFor example, monkeys of all ages played with set creation, but did not consistently create\nsimilarity sets until 2 to 3 years of age. Development was quicker in chimpanzees, but still\nslower than in humans, and the apes never showed the most complex forms of object\nconstructions. Overall, these results suggest that apes (including humans) exhibit a faster\npace of development than do monkeys in skills of object manipulation (as in Figure 1a).\nNonetheless, the most complex skills that humans exhibit may be terminal additions in\nhuman development (as in Figure 2c).\nAnother important skill for reasoning about the physical world involves tracking the\nlocations of objects as they move through space. In humans, object-tracking skills emerge\nin a distinct order. First, infants first begin to retrieve hidden objects (before 10 months of\nage), and then begin to comprehend visible displacements, solving the \"A not B\" error,\naround their second birthday (Call, 2001; Piaget, 1954). Soon after, they solve invisible\ndisplacements, but it is not until relatively late in development (3 to 4 years) that children\nunderstand complex invisible displacements such as transpositions (changing the location\nof an object's container) and rotational displacements (where the support is moved; Piaget,\n2008; Sophian, 1984). One hypothesis for this consistent pattern of emergence is that all\nobject-tracking skills rely on the same set of cognitive capacities. As these capacities\ndevelop, children can complete more complex tasks, such as those involving out-of-sight\nmovements or larger numbers of items (Barth and Call, 2006; Call, 2003). If this is the\ncase, then non-human primates should exhibit similar developmental patterns.\nAlternatively, these behaviors may rely on a set of independent skills, in which case the\npatterns of emergence might differ across species.\nSome data from adult primates support the claim that these diverse object-tracking\nbehaviors rely on the same cognitive capacities. In particular, both monkeys and apes are\nsuccessful at \"easier\" tasks involving visible displacements, but generally only apes are\ncapable of the full range of object-tracking skills, including those with invisible movements\n(Albiach-Serrano, Call, and Barth, 2010; Barth and Call, 2006; Beran, Beran, and Menzel,\nHowever, other evidence from adult primates does not accord with the patterns seen in\nhumans. For example, even though adult monkeys are not successful at reasoning about\ninvisible displacement tasks, they can understand rotational displacements, which is\nsurprising because this requires mental reconstruction of the movements of hidden objects\nadult apes show similar levels of errors on tasks that seem to differ in their difficulty for\nhuman children, such as rotational displacements and translocations (Albiach-Serrano et\nal., 2010) or transpositions and invisible displacements (Barth and Call, 2006). These\nfindings therefore cast doubt on the hypothesis that the same core skill set underlies\nperformance across these tasks in non-human primates.\nComparative developmental studies also suggest that object-tracking tasks tap into a\nrange of abilities that differ in their time and pattern of emergence. The pattern of success\nacross development by non-human primates in object-tracking tasks broadly mirrors that\nComparative developmental psychology\nseen in humans, but appears to proceed at a faster pace at early stages (as in Figure 1a; see\nalso Gomez, 2005). However, for a few select tasks, non-humans show different patterns\nfrom those seen in humans, both in terms of the order of emergence (as in Figure 2a) and\nthe causal structure of skills (as in Figure 2b). In particular, the ability to follow\ntranslocations develops at a later life-stage in non-human primates than in humans. For\nexample, gorillas first solve invisible displacements by 12 months (Dore and Goulet, 1998),\nyet they learn to solve translocations sometime after 17 months (Visalberghi, 1986)--the\nopposite order than that observed in children. Similarly, although human children tend to\nsolve \"single\" and \"double\" displacement tasks (which differ in the number of objects that\nmove) around the same time (Call, 2001; Piaget, 1954), double displacements appear to be\nmarkedly more difficult for young non-human primates (Antinucci, 1990). Indeed, one\nyoung gorilla solved invisible displacements many months before he was able to\nunderstand a double visible displacement (Antinucci, Spinozzi, and Natale, 1986; Dore and\nGoulet, 1998). Overall, these developmental data indicate that object-tracking abilities do\nnot develop in a uniformly consistent manner across species. Consequently, object tracking\nmay indeed depend on multiple underlying cognitive capacities in human development.\nComparative developmental inquiry, therefore, provided a key test for theories that could\nnot be fully evaluated with human developmental data alone.\nDevelopment of foraging skills in chimpanzees and bonobos\nA second area where comparative developmental research has recently addressed\nthe origins of human cognition concerns cognitive skills used in foraging contexts. Wild\nprimates face a myriad of complex spatial problems when foraging, including recalling the\nlocation of resources and determining the best route to navigate between these different\nlocations. Despite the ubiquity of such spatial problems, psychological theories suggest that\nhumans are uniquely equipped to solve spatial problems with a degree of flexibility and\naccuracy not seen in other species. In particular, language is thought to play an important\nrole in human spatial cognitive development (Haun, Rapold, Call, Janzen, and Levinson,\nand Rasch, 2002; Pyers et al., 2010). In terms of spatial memory, children exhibit\ndevelopmental shifts around 2 years of age in many skills, including recall of the locations\nof hidden targets, recall of multiple locations, and recall of locations over longer temporal\nNewcombe, Huttenlocher, Drummey, and Wiley, 1998; Sluzenski, Newcombe, and Satlow,\n2004). Some aspects of these changes may be related to language. For example, when\nchildren are asked to search for hidden objects in a large space after they have been\ndisoriented, their proficiency with spatial language predicts the success of their searches\n(Balcomb et al., 2011). However, the relationship between language and the emergence of\na given cognitive ability could be causal (language is required for a skill to emerge),\nfacultative (language speeds up a process that could occur otherwise), or only correlated.\nStudies of comparative development in apes can therefore be an important tool in\ndifferentiating these possibilities, as apes share an extended juvenile period of post-natal\nbrain development with humans but lack language (Matsuzawa, 2007; Matsuzawa et al.,\nComparative developmental psychology\nIncreasingly, research indicates that apes have quite sophisticated spatial abilities\n(Kuhlmeier and Boysen, 2002; Mendes and Call, 2008; Menzel, Savage-Rumbaugh, and\nMenzel, 2002; Menzel, 1973). Studies tracking the emergence of spatial skills over\ndevelopment further suggest that apes can show human-like changes in spatial abilities in\nthe absence of language. For example, one study examined how chimpanzees and bonobos\nperformed in a naturalistic foraging task where they could search for food they had seen\nhidden previously in a large outdoor enclosure (Rosati and Hare, 2012b). Whereas infant\napes found few pieces of food, older chimpanzees were more successful at recalling\nmultiple locations. Thus, although there are improvements in place memory associated with\nthe acquisition of spatial prepositions in humans (Balcomb et al., 2011), chimpanzees\nexhibit similar developmental changes without any concurrent language acquisition. This\nsuggests that at least some types of ontogenetic shifts in place-based searching may be due\nto intrinsic, maturational changes in spatial abilities. In addition, although language may be\na developmental prerequisite for the origins of some spatial skills in humans (Hermer-\nVazquez et al., 2001), this causal link is not present in apes (following Figure 2b).\nComparative developmental studies also make it possible to address why such\ndifferences in developmental trajectories arise, by linking developmental data with\ninformation about different species' natural histories. For example, in the foraging task\ndescribed previously (Rosati and Hare, 2012b), chimpanzees and bonobos exhibited similar\nskills in infancy, but chimpanzees exhibited a faster rate of improvement than bonobos\n(following Figure 1a). Why might this be the case from an evolutionary perspective?\nImportantly, even though chimpanzees and bonobos diverged less than 1mya (Won and\nHey, 2005), they show a suite of differences in their behavior and morphology.\nChimpanzees exhibit more pronounced sexual dimorphism, increased escalated aggression,\nand higher rates of extractive foraging and hunting, whereas bonobos exhibit increased\nsociosexual behavior and an increased importance of female bonds (Hare, Wobber, and\nPilbeam, 2001). One hypothesis for this pattern is that chimpanzees and bonobos differ in\ntheir wild feeding ecology (Kano, 1992; Wrangham and Peterson, 1996). In particular,\nchimpanzees are thought to live in environments where they face higher costs to acquire\nfood, including more seasonal variation (White, 1998), more competition for smaller, less-\nabundant food patches (White and Wrangham, 1988), and have less access to important\nfallback foods (Malenky and Wrangham, 1993)--a set of differences that is thought to\nimpact the tenor of social interactions in this species. This ecological hypothesis further\nsuggests that chimpanzees develop more accurate spatial memory over ontogeny due to\ntheir greater dependence on patchily-distributed resources as adults.\nComparisons of chimpanzees and bonobos therefore provide a test case for the role\nof comparative developmental psychology in illuminating the functional relevance of\ncognitive capacities. Increasing evidence suggests that adult chimpanzees and bonobos\nactually differ in a set of cognitive traits related to foraging, including levels of feeding\ntolerance (Hare, Melis, Woods, Hastings, and Wrangham, 2007; Wobber, Wrangham, and\nHare, 2010b), tool use abilities (Herrmann, Hare, Call, and Tomasello, 2010), spatial\nmemory (Rosati and Hare, 2012b), and patterns of value-based decision-making\nComparative developmental psychology\nStevens, Hare, and Hauser, 2007). One potential evolutionary mechanism to generate these\ndifferences is heterochronic changes in dvelopmental timing. Indeed, developmental\ncomparisons have revealed that even though patterns of cognitive development are broadly\nsimilar for both species, bonobos appear to exhibit delayed development specifically in this\nset of skills relevant to the ecology hypothesis, such as in inhibitory control and memory\nbonobos exhibit targeted differences in development only for a specific set of ecologically-\nrelevant skills.\nComparative developmental studies of closely related species (like chimpanzees\nand bonobos) can allow researchers to integrate hypotheses about the mechanisms\nsupporting cognition with hypotheses about the functional importance of those cognitive\nskills in natural behavior. Studies that further include both humans and non-human apes\ncan therefore provide critical insights into the evolutionary function of uniquely-human\ncognitive skills. For example, human feeding ecology differs from that of other great apes\nin several ways. Hunter-gatherers have larger home ranges than other apes, and exhibit a\nunique pattern of central place foraging where individuals return to a centralized location\nwith food (Hill, Barton, and Hurtado, 2009; Marlowe, 2005). Consequently, humans are\nmore reliant on distant food sources than are other apes, which poses new problems\nconcerning locating food and navigating between resources. The results from chimpanzees\nand bonobos predict that humans may also exhibit targeted developmental differences in\nevolutionarily-relevant skills. For example, over development, children form increasing\nflexible representation of space integrating multiple cues (Hermer-Vazquez et al., 1999,\n2001; Newcombe and Huttenlocher, 2005), which may be related to the new ecological\nproblems that humans must solve. Comparative developmental studies can potentially\nilluminate the function of these human cognitive abilities.\nDevelopment of social cognition in apes and humans\nA final area where recent comparative developmental work has advanced our\nknowledge is that of social cognition. Humans and non-human primates differ not only in\nhow they reason about the physical world, but also in their reasoning about the social\nworld. Humans possess a sophisticated belief-desire psychology that we use to reason\nabout the (unobservable) thoughts, intentions, and beliefs of other people. Other primates\nshare some of the same capacities, such as reasoning about other's perceptions, but they\nalso differ in important ways (Call, 2008; Rosati, Santos, and Hare, 2010; Wobber and\nHare, in press). In fact, one influential hypothesis suggests that social cognition represents\nthe most profound difference between us and other animals (Tomasello, 1999; Tomasello\nand Carpenter, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005). Recent studies have begun to disentangle\nhow these differences emerge.\nFirst, humans and other primates exhibit many striking similarities in their social\ncognition in the first few months of life. Chimpanzee and rhesus macaque neonates, for\nexample, both imitate the facial expressions of a human demonstrator in their first few days\nof life (Ferrari et al., 2006; Myowa-Yamakoshi, Tomonaga, Tanaka, and Matsuzawa,\n2004), much like babies (Meltzoff and Moore, 1983). In addition, infant chimpanzees and\nComparative developmental psychology\nan infant gibbon were found to prefer faces with direct gaze over averted-gaze faces by the\nage of 2 months (Myowa-Yamakoshi and Tomonaga, 2001b; Myowa-Yamakoshi,\nTomonaga, Tanaka, and Matsuzawa, 2003), paralleling the \"2-month revolution\" when\nhumans infants begin to actively engage with other's gaze (Rochat, 2001). Finally, infant\nchimpanzees and an infant gibbon recognize and prefer the face of their mother or human\ncaregiver over less familiar faces at 1 month of age (Myowa-Yamakoshi and Tomonaga,\n2001a; Tomonaga et al., 2004), much like human infants (Pascalis, Deschonen, Morton,\nDeruelle, and Fabregrenet, 1995). Taken together, these results show that humans and apes\nexhibit similar developmental trajectories in early infancy, suggesting that human patterns\nhave deep biological roots.\nHowever, human and non-human primate social development diverges at older\nages. For example, human infants reliably follow other's gaze to targets by 6 months\n(Butterworth and Jarrett, 1991) and begin to follow gaze in more complex situations, where\nbarriers make it difficult to gauge another's line of sight, by 12 months (Moll and\nTomasello, 2004). In contrast, a longitudinal study of a chimpanzee's gaze-following skills\nindicates that he did not follow a human experimenter's gaze until 13 months (Okamoto et\nal., 2002). Other studies find that chimpanzees are not proficient in geometric gaze-\nfollowing or following gaze around barriers until 2 to 3 years old (Okamoto-Barth,\nTomonaga, Tanaka, and Matsuzawa, 2008; Tomasello and Carpenter, 2005; Wobber et al.,\n2013). These results indicate that humans show an accelerated pace of social-cognitive\ndevelopment in this period of late infancy (following Figure 1a). Macaques also develop\ngaze-following skills at a slower rate than humans (Ferrari, Coude, Gallese, and Fogassi,\n2008; Ferrari, Kohler, Fogassi, and Gallese, 2000; Teufel, Gutmann, Pirow, and Fischer,\n2010), leading to the proposal that non-human gaze-following is spurred by experience\nwith relevant social interactions over a long critical period. This proposal would therefore\nsuggest a difference between humans and other primates, both in the rate of development\n(see Figure 1a) as well as a difference in the underlying causal structure of gaze-following\nskills (see Figure 2b). Indeed, mechanisms supporting gaze-following in adult chimpanzees\nand humans may differ as well. Eye-tracking studies show that although humans are most\ninterested in looking at eyes, chimpanzees are as interested (or even more interested) in\nviewing the bodies or mouths of conspecifics (Kano and Tomanaga, 2009; Myowa-\nAnother area of divergence in human and non-human social cognitive development\nconcerns the perception of goal-directed action. Human infants rapidly gain proficiency in\nunderstanding goal-directed actions: They interpret the acquisition of desirable objects as\nbeing the goal of a reaching gesture by 6 months, and reason about the rationality of an\nIn contrast, chimpanzees only first begin to reason about others' actions in terms of their\nunderlying goals around 2 to 3 years of age, even when reared by humans (Bering,\nboth gaze following and goal understanding appear to emerge relatively late in\nchimpanzees compared to humans. This again supports the claim that there are differences\nin both the pace (see Figure 1a) and pattern (see Figure 2b) of human social cognitive\ndevelopment, suggesting that behavioral skills that quickly come online in relatively young\nComparative developmental psychology\nhumans may depend on additional social experience in non-humans.\nEarlier differences in human and primate social cognition may have further\ncascading effects over development. Human infants typically rely on mechanisms of joint\nattention to comprehend and direct others' attention and behavior following the \"9-month\nrevolution.\" At this point, infants first begin to move beyond simple dyadic interactions\n(self and other) to engage triadic interactions (self, other, and referent; Carpenter, Nagell,\nand Tomasello, 1998; Tomasello, 1999). In contrast, chimpanzee infants do not seem to\nexhibit joint attention, even though they can understand and even direct others' behavior at\nfindings indicate that although joint attention may be a causal precursor of other skills in\nhumans (such as more complex forms of gaze following, as described previously), this\ncausal structure is lacking in apes (as in Figure 2b). These results highlight that even\nthough certain capacities may be prerequisites for later-developing abilities in humans,\nthese same capacities may not be tightly linked in other species.\nIndeed, even enculturated apes--who have been reared in a human-like social and\ncommunicative environment--do not exhibit capacities for joint attention. Enculturation\nstudies can assess the degree to which ape developmental trajectories are plastic in\nresponse to human-like social inputs. Enculturated apes can use some symbolic language,\nemploy referential signals outside of the linguistic domain (Premack and Premack, 1983;\nTerrrace, 1979), imitate others (Bjorklund, Bering, and Ragan, 2000; Call and Tomasello,\n1996), and even reason about novel tools like humans (Furlong, Boose, and Boysen, 2008).\nHowever, they do not develop human-like joint attention (Carpenter, Tomasello, and\nconflicting definitions of joint attention). These findings suggest that important differences\nbetween human and ape social cognition persist even when apes are reared in more human-\ntypical environments.\nFinally, the importance of these early differences in social-cognitive development\nmay increase in later ontogeny. Tomasello and colleagues hypothesized that the early\nemergence of social cognitive skills like joint attention and goal understanding allows\nhumans to rapidly acquire a diverse array of skills across domains (Herrmann, Call,\nHernadez-Lloreda, Hare, and Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello and Carpenter, 2007; Tomasello\net al., 2005). In particular, skills emerging during the \"9-month revolution\" (Tomasello,\n1999), such as the ability to engage in triadic interactions, appear to enable human infants\nto learn proficiently from other individuals--including social knowledge such as novel\nword labels (Baldwin and Moses, 2001; Vaish, Demir, and Baldwin, 2011), as well as non-\nsocial knowledge about how to correctly utilize novel tools (Birch, Vauthier, and Bloom,\n2008; Casler and Kelemen, 2005). This hypothesis predicts that because non-humans do\nnot acquire this earlier set of social skills, they will begin to exhibit divergences in both\nsocial and non-social skills in later ontogeny.\nA recent comparison of cognitive development in 2- to 4-year-old humans,\nchimpanzees, and bonobos assessed this hypothesis by comparing the performance of these\nspecies across a diverse array of cognitive tasks. This comparison found that in the social\ndomain (in tasks assessing goal understanding, gaze-following, and imitation, among other\ncapacities), human 2-year-olds were more proficient than same-age non-human apes.\nComparative developmental psychology\nHowever, humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos had comparable performance at this age in\ntasks measuring cognitive skills in the physical domain (such as assessing comprehension\nof space, number, and causality). The critical test of the hypothesis was thus to examine\nhumans' and apes' relative change in skills as they aged. In support of the claim that early\nsocial differences have cascading effects, humans showed greater improvement in their\nperformance on both social and physical tasks compared to apes (Wobber et al., 2013).\nThese results suggest that children's early competency in social cognitive skills such as\ngoal understanding and imitation might enable them to learn more rapidly across domains,\nwhereas young apes must rely to a greater degree on individual and trial-and-error learning,\nacquiring knowledge about the world at a slower rate. That is, the causal relationships\nbetween the acquisition of different types of skills differs between apes and humans (as in\nFigure 2b) may in turn facilitate differences in the rate of development later in ontogeny (as\nin Figure 1a). Concordant with this suggestion, a study of individual differences in\nperformance across a similar battery of tasks found that children possess a distinct social\ncognition \"factor\" predictive of their success in tasks across that domain, whereas\nchimpanzees' success on different social cognition tasks was not interrelated (Herrmann,\nHern\u00e1ndez-Lloreda, Call, Hare, and Tomasello, 2010). Taken together, these results\nindicate that human social-cognitive development differs from that of our closest relatives\nin both pace and pattern. Moreover, these early differences in social abilities may underpin\nmajor differences in the adult cognition of these species.\nConclusions: The Future of Comparative Developmental Psychology\nWe have argued that comparative developmental research can provide new insights\ninto human cognition that cannot be identified via developmental or comparative research\nalone. Although this approach is not commonly used, recent research has already begun to\nidentify similarities and differences in the pace and pattern of human development relative\nto other primates in domains as diverse as reasoning about objects, spatial memory, and\nsocial cognition. Yet this empirical work represents a small sample of the open questions in\npsychology and biology that the comparative developmental approach can address. Indeed,\nthere are some cognitive domains where it is already clear that comparative developmental\nstudies can distinguish between alternative accounts of cognitive development and move\ntheoretical debates forward.\nFor example, one current debate concerns the development of different capacities\nsupporting mature theory of mind. As mentioned previously, results from theory of mind\ntasks suggest that these skills emerge in a strict order, with children first understanding\nothers' desires, then their knowledge, and finally their beliefs (Wellman and Liu, 2004).\nHowever, recent work using looking-time measures to test younger children find that\nbabies may understand something about false beliefs within the second year of life\n(Baillargeon, Scott, and He, 2010; Kov\u00e1cs, T\u00e9gl\u00e1s, and Endress, 2010; Onishi and\nComparative studies of non-human primates further indicate that species such as\nchimpanzees and rhesus macaques exhibit a number of theory of mind skills (see Rosati et\nal., 2010 for a review). These skills include visual and auditory perspective-taking\nComparative developmental psychology\n(Braeuer, Call, and Tomasello, 2007; Flombaum and Santos, 2005; Hare, Call, Agnetta,\nSantos, Nissen, and Ferrugia, 2006), reasoning about others' knowledge states (Hare, Call,\nand Tomasello, 2001; Kaminski, Call, and Tomasello, 2009; Marticorena, Ruiz, Mukerji,\nGoddu, and Santos, 2011), and desire comprehension (Buttelmann, Call, and Tomasello,\n2009). Critically, however, non-human primates do not appear to represent the beliefs of\nothers when tested in false belief tasks (Call and Tomasello, 1999; Kaminski et al., 2009;\nKrachun, Carpenter, Call, and Tomasello, 2009; Marticorena et al., 2011), and may instead\nrepresent situations in which an individual has a false belief merely in terms of that\nindividual's ignorance (Kaminski et al., 2009; Marticorena et al., 2011). Comparative\ndevelopmental studies can thus assess whether the patterns of emergence of different theory\nof mind capacities in non-human primates are in fact causally dependent on one another,\nand illuminate why young infants might be successful on non-verbal false-belief tasks\nwhereas non-humans are not. Alternatively, non-human primates' capacities may emerge\nthrough different developmental mechanisms, suggesting that their abilities are supported\nby different representations about social agents.\nA second debate that comparative developmental studies can address concerns the\ndevelopment of our capacity to individuate objects. Over the past decade, developmental\nresearchers have examined how infants develop the ability to distinguish objects of\ndifferent categories. Classic work by Xu and colleagues suggested that emerging language\ncapacities--specifically, learning the labels of different objects--may be necessary for\nconceptually individuating different kinds of objects (Xu, 2002; Xu and Carey, 1996; Xu,\nCarey, and Quint, 2004; Xu, Carey, and Welch, 1999). Indeed, Xu and colleagues observed\nthat infants are unable to individuate two different objects in a looking-time task before\nthey know the words for those objects (Xu and Carey, 1996). To test the role of language,\nprimate researchers have begun to examine whether adult non-human primates can succeed\non similar individuation tasks. Surprisingly, this work revealed that adult primates are able\nto individuate objects, even though they lack their linguistic labels (Munakata, Santos,\nSpelke, Hauser, and O'Reilly, 2001; Phillips and Santos, 2007; Santos, Sulkowski,\nSpaepen, and Hauser, 2002). How then do non-human primates learn to solve individuation\nproblems that human infants solve with language? Comparative developmental studies can\naddress this topic by focusing on the emergence of these mechanisms in non-human\nprimate ontogeny. For example, monkeys may acquire object individuation skills at a\nslower pace than humans, suggesting that language may play a facultative role in\naccelerating human development of these skills. Comparative developmental studies can\nalso identify whether primates' individuation capacities depend on another form of\nexperience that operates similarly to the way human language facilitates individuation in\nour own species.\nFinally, a major question in biology that comparative developmental studies can\naddress concerns the evolutionary significance of differences in human life history traits\n(i.e., the timing and patterning of key life events such as age of sexual maturity and\nreproduction). Whereas all primates exhibit a long juvenile period relative to other\nmammals (Charnov and Berrigan, 1993), the human juvenile period is markedly longer\nthan expected relative to other primates (Bogin and Smith, 1996; Walker, Burger, Wagner,\nComparative developmental psychology\nand Von Rueden, 2006). One hypothesis for the evolutionary function of this prolonged\njuvenile period is that it enables more complex skill acquisition and, therefore, greater\nbehavioral flexibility in human adulthood (Bjorklund and Green, 1992; Bogin, 2010;\nKaplan, Hill, Lancaster, and Hurtado, 2000). Yet although there is morphological and\nphysiological evidence indicating that human growth and reproduction is slowed relative to\nthat of other primates, there are little data on comparative cognitive development\nexamining whether humans actually exhibit longer periods of skill acquisition. Indeed,\nsome evidence comparing rates of cognitive development in humans and apes suggests that\nhuman cognitive development may in fact be accelerated in comparison to that of non-\nhuman primates during early childhood, rather than prolonged (Wobber et al., 2013).\nComparative developmental studies of apes and humans at older ages--such as during\nadolescence, when humans are learning some of their most complex, culturally-acquired\nskills--can further test this hypothesis.\nOverall, we emphasize that studies of comparative cognitive development can\naddress outstanding questions in both psychology and biology. Research using this\napproach has already made important contributions to our understanding of the human\nmind. Indeed, the results discussed here highlight that models of human cognitive evolution\nmust integrate data on cognitive development in other species in order to draw strong\ninferences about what traits are unique to our lineage. Thus, the comparative developmental\napproach represents an untapped line of evidence that will advance theoretical ideas\nconcerning what cognitive abilities are unique to humans, as well as the ultimate\nevolutionary function of these abilities in human evolutionary history.\n"
