Design and Methods: Drawn\nfrom the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology\nSurveys (CPES), blacks (n = 1,008) and whites\nanalysis. Logistic regression analyses were con-\nducted. Results: Results showed significant\nracial disparities in mental health service use in the\noverall sample, as well as significant variation by\nregion. Although no racial differences were observed\nin the Northeast, West, or Midwest regions, black\nelders in the South were significantly less likely than\nwhites to use mental health services (odds ratios\n3.23). Implications: The findings suggest that\nimproving the access to mental health care in certain\nregions, the South in particular, may be essential to\nreduce racial disparities at the national level. Policy\nimplications are discussed.\nKey Words:Racial disparities, Geography, Mental\nhealth, Service use, Regional variation\nThis study addressed the national priority of\nreducing or eliminating disparities in health and\nhealth care between racial/ethnic minority and\nnonminority older adults. Despite inconsistent\nfindings on racial/ethnic differences in mental health\nracial and ethnic minorities--especially blacks and\nLatinos--continue to utilize mental health services\nat only half the rate of non-Hispanic whites, even\nafter accounting for their mental health status\nof Health and Human Services, 2001; Wang et al.,\n2005). It is especially alarming in the field of\ngerontology that older adults in general are less\nlikely to use mental health services than younger\nadults (Mackenzie, Pagura, & Sareen, 2010).\nStudies investigating factors associated with use\nof mental health services often rely on Andersen's\nutilization, a theoretical framework employed in\nthe present study. Many studies have focused on\nindividual-level factors to explain mental health\nThe Gerontologist \u00a9 The Author 2012.

However, Andersen's model implic-\nitly emphasizes the importance of geographic\n(area-level) factors that affect service use in addi-\ntion to the individual-level factors.\nAn emerging body of literature suggests that geog-\nraphy influences mental health (Curtis, 2004; Joe,\nBaser, Breeden, Neighbors, & Jackson, 2006; Philo,\ngeographic areas that have stressful environments\nare associated with mental illness. Curtis (2004)\nalso noted in her study conducted in urban areas in\nthe United Kingdom that mental health problems in\ncertain areas are exacerbated by geographic char-\nacteristics such as \"physical and biological risks,\nmaterial deprivation, and social fragmentation or\nanomie.\" Joe and colleagues (2006) reported that\nblacks in the Midwest had a significantly higher risk\nfor suicidal attempt than those in the South. This\nline of research underscores that geographical con-\ntext is crucial in understanding variations in mental\nhealth and access to mental health care.\nDespite its importance, little is known about the\nrole of geography in racial and ethnic disparities in\nmental health care. There are, however, some recent\nstudies on geographic differences in physical health\ncare relating to racial/ethnic disparities. Baicker,\nChandra, and Skinvner (2005) demonstrated the con-\ntribution of geography to black\u00adwhite disparities in\nhealth care by exploring care for diabetic Medicare\nbeneficiaries in 306 hospital referral regions of the\nUnited States.The authors found that areas with large\nracial disparities in monitoring of hemoglobin A1c\noften had overall rates of monitoring that were higher\nthan average and, conversely, that areas with small\ndisparities had lower-than-average overall rates. This\nimplies that to reduce disparities at the national level,\nimproving the overall quality of care in low-quality\nregions may be more effective than attempting to\nachieve equal rates of care across racial/ethnic groups\nwithin regions.Semrad,Tancredi,Baldwin,and Green\n(2011) also documented racial/ethnic disparities in\ncolorectal cancer screening across geographic regions.\nThese studies consistently emphasize the importance\nof considering geography when racial and ethnic dis-\nparities are examined.\nTo our knowledge, there is no published research\non geographic variations in mental health service\nuse among racially/ethnically diverse older adults.\nTherefore,thepresentstudyexaminedwhetherracial\ndifferences in mental health service use among older\nadults varied across geographic regions. Specifically,\nwe examined the use of mental health services as a\nfunction of geographic region in a national sample\nof black and white elders. Given the lack of previ-\nous research on this topic in the United States and\nthe exploratory nature of the present analyses, we\ndid not present specific hypotheses regarding which\ngeographic regions might differ.\nMethods\nSample\nThe present study was based on nationally\nrepresentative samples from the Collaborative\nPsychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES, 2001\u00ad\n2003). Funded by the National Institute of Mental\nHealth (NIMH), the CPES consists of three national\nsurveys: (a) the National Comorbidity Survey\nReplication (NCS-R), (b) the National Survey of\nAmerican Life (NSAL), and (c) the National Latino\nand Asian American Study (NLAAS). Face-to-face\ninterviews were conducted unless the respondent\nspecifically requested a telephone interview or if a\nface-to-face interview was not feasible. The CPES\nprovides a unique opportunity to understand mental\nhealth disparities because it is the first nationally\nrepresentative data set with sufficient power to\nallow investigation of cultural influences on mental\ndisorders and utilization of mental health care, with\nspecial emphasis on racial/ethnic minority groups.\nThe CPES sample frame was based on a four-stage\nnational area probability sample conducted in a\ntotal of 252 geographic areas or primary sampling\nunits (PSUs) across the United States. More detailed\ninformationonsamplingdesignisavailableelsewhere\nFor the present study, we selected adults aged 60\nand older who are blacks (n = 1,008) and non-His-\npanic whites (n = 1,870).As displayed in Table 1, our\nties. Thirteen states were not sampled. The South has\nthe largest number of study participants as well as the\nhighest percentage of counties represented (46.8%).\nOur use of the general data set along with the unique\ngeographicidentifiers(FederalInformationProcessing\nStandard [FIPS] codes) included in a restricted data\nset has been approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard (IRB) at the University of Alabama.\nMeasures\nMental Health Service Use.--The CPES assessed\nuse of the following mental health services to repre-\nsent three service sectors: (a) specialty mental health\nsector (psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and\nsocial workers seen in mental health settings, other\nmental health professionals, and mental health hot-\nlines), (b) general medical sector (general practition-\ners, family doctors, nurses, occupational therapists,\nand other health professionals seen for mental health\nproblems), and (c) any other service sector (religious\nor spiritual advisors, counselors, social workers seen\nin nonmedical settings, or any alternative services).\nRespondents were asked to report whether or not\nthey used these services during the past 12 months.\nTheir answers were dichotomized to indicate\nwhether they had used any mental health services\nlisted earlier (coded as 1) or not (coded as 0).\nGeographic Areas.--The CPES provides\ncounty-level FIPS codes, which are unique geo-\ngraphic identifiers, that can provide geographi-\ncal units (e.g., states and counties) in the United\nStates, where each participant may reside. Using\nthese FIPS codes, we were able to classify individu-\nals living in four main regions of the United States\n(Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) as defined\nby the U.S. Census Bureau. Although state-level\nanalyses were conducted for descriptive purposes\nin the present study, county-level analyses were not\nconducted due to the small sample sizes of older\nblacks and whites in many counties.\nCovariates.--Participants' background charac-\nteristics were employed as covariates. The variables\nincludedintheanalyseswereage(years),sex(women/\nmen),marital status (married or cohabiting/divorced,\nseparated, widowed, or never married), educational\nmore years), annual household income (less than\nand diagnosis of any Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) psychiat-\nric disorder in the past year (yes/no).\nData Analysis\nPearson's chi-square tests of proportional differ-\nences and independent sample t tests were used to\ndescribe sample characteristics and the use of men-\ntal health services and to note statistical differences\nbetween blacks and non-Hispanic whites. In order\nto examine the likelihood of using mental health\nservices, logistic regression analyses were con-\nducted for the entire United States and stratified\nby region after adjusting for covariates. The pro-\nposed model included all covariates and did not\nuse an incremental approach. This approach was\nchosen due to the relevance of all covariates in the\nstudy and there was no violation of Hosmer and\nLemeshow's goodness of fit. The logistic regres-\nsion procedure for the entire United States was\nTable 1.

Again, having any DSM-IV\npsychiatric disorder within the last 12 months was the\nstrongest predictor of using mental health services in\nthe overall sample.\nWhen examining disparities within each region,\nsignificant racial differences were found only in the\nSouth, with the odds of whites' using mental health\nservices being 2.08 times greater than that of blacks.\nWithoutcontrollingforcovariates,resultsweresimilar\nexcept for the Northeast.Although the significance of\nthe race effect remained the same for the South with\nsome minor changes in OR, the race effect for the\n2.61; not presented in tables). When controlling for\ncovariates, older adults residing in the South showed\nmore disparities in using mental health services than\nthe other regions. There were sex differences in both\nthe South and the West, with women more likely to\nuse services than men. Educational differences existed\nin the Northeast and the South with those having\nthe highest levels of education utilizing service more\nthan those in the lowest category. The West was\nthe only region to show income as a predictor of\nmental health service use; the odds of using mental\nhealth services for those with greater than or equal to\nthose for individuals with less than $20,000 annual\nincome. Having any DSM-IV psychiatric disorders in\nthe past 12 months was predictive across all regions,\nwith those having disorders being more likely to use\nmental health services.\nSouthern states included in the present study\nwere analyzed to explore the states that specifi-\ncally contribute to black\u00adwhite disparities at the\nnational level. Among 15 southern states included\nin the study, we were able to conduct additional\nanalyses for four states having at least five par-\nticipants in each cell (black vs white/yes vs no on\nservice use in the past year) of the state-level con-\ntingency table. All four states (Florida, Georgia,\nTexas, and Virginia) consistently showed lower uti-\nlization rates among older blacks compared with\ntheir white counterparts. The black\u00adwhite gaps\nin utilization rates were most apparent in Florida\nDiscussion\nRacial differences in mental health service use\ndiffer substantially by region. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first study reporting the interactive role\nof race and geography in mental health service use\namong older adults. Using a nationally representa-\ntive sample, we found clear evidence that black\u00ad\nwhite disparities in mental health service use at the\nnational level were largely due to racial disparities\nin the South. Older whites in the South were much\nmore likely to use mental health services than their\nblack counterparts, but there were no significant\nracial differences in the rest of the country. The\nfindings suggest that to reduce black\u00adwhite gaps\nin mental health service use at the national level,\nspecial attention should be paid to improve access\nto mental health care in the South.\nPotential reasons for the black\u00adwhite disparities\nin mental health service use in the South deserve\nfurther discussion. Regional differences in race\nand culture may influence attitudes toward men-\ntal health service use. Previous research suggests\nthat culture is an important predictor of receiving\npreventive care among racial and ethnic minori-\nties (Goel et al., 2003; Kandula, Wen, Jacobs, &\nLauderdale, 2006). Thus, older blacks and whites\nmay have different attitudes toward mental health\nservice use, which may in turn affect willingness to\nseek professional help for mental health problems.\nDistrust and poor information regarding general\nhealth care procedures (Ibrahim, Siminoff, Burant,\n& Kwoh, 2002) may contribute to racial disparities\nin mental health care. Regional variations of racial\ndisparities across the United States may also reflect\nproblems with access to mental health care and\nlimits on the availability of mental health services\nin communities with large proportions of blacks.\nOur additional analyses on the four southern\nstates (Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia) con-\nsistently showed lower utilization rates among\nolder blacks compared with their white counter-\nparts. This clearly suggests that we need to inves-\ntigate local- or area-level barriers that impair\nmental health service utilization rates among older\nblacks in the South more so than in other areas.\nIt should be also noted that we were not able to\ntest these potential causal factors in the present\nstudy because CPES did not measure such vari-\nables. Future research should elucidate reasons for\nthe lower mental health service use among older\nblacks in the South.\nThe present study has policy implications. In\norder to reduce racial disparities in the mental\nhealth service use across the United States, policy\ninterventions targeting certain geographic areas are\nneeded. Given that racial/ethnic minorities live dis-\nproportionately in areas with low quality of care\n(Baicker et al., 2005), racial disparities in mental\nhealth service use across the United States could\nbe reduced by addressing the problem of regional\nvariations in the utilization of services. Therefore,\npolicymakers should target reducing disparities in\nmental health care arising from geographic areas,\nwhich may in turn improve mental health care\nreceived by all U.S. older adults and by minor-\nity older adults in particular. Further research is\nrequired to provide more information about how\ngeographic and regional factors relate to disparities\nin mental health service use. More detailed analyses\nat the county or local level would be desirable to\nsupport development of policy interventions.\nSome limitations should be noted. First, the\nlowest level of geography analyzed was the state.\nAlthough the CPES provides county-level FIPS\ncodes, sample sizes for older blacks and whites\nin some areas were not adequate for meaningful\ncomparisons. Second, subgroup differences among\nolder blacks were not examined in the present\nanalysis. Previous research suggests the importance\nof examining subgroups in health disparities\nresearch, reporting evidence of cultural differences\nbetween Caribbean blacks and African Americans\nin the United States (Joe et al., 2006). Future\nresearch should consider examining potential\nsubgroup differences. Third, other racial/ethnic\ngroups were not considered in the present study.\nFuture research should examine how geography\ninfluences mental health service use in other racial/\nethnic groups, such as Latinos/Hispanics and\nAsians. Fourth, future studies might benefit from\nanalyzing larger numbers of individuals who have\nDSM-IV diagnoses to allow sufficient statistical\npower to examine how his might relate to mental\nhealth disparities. Our logistic regression model\nsuggested that use of mental health services by\nthose with DSM-IV diagnoses might be affected\nby different factors compared with those without\ndiagnoses. However, given that the sample is\nsmall (n = 134), we did not have enough power to\ndetect an association if one exists. Fifth, although\nthe CPES is a nationally representative data, 13\nstates were not included in our analyzed sample.\nFinally, the present study did not control for the\neffects of other important covariates such as\nreligiosity, cultural factors, and local area\u00adlevel\ncharacteristics (e.g., availability of mental health\nservices such as mental health specialists and\ncommunity mental health centers, rural vs urban\ndifferences, percentage of insured populations) that\nmight affect service utilization for mental health\nproblems. A related limitation is that the present\nstudy did not include any variables on regional\nstructure of African American and non-Hispanic\nwhites in the United States, for example, more than\n50% of all African Americans in the United States\nresided in the South region in the 2000 census (the\nclosest one to the data used in the present study;\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Future research should\nexamine whether these factors are responsible for\nobserved regional differences.\nIn sum, we found clear evidence that regional\nvariations in mental health service use among\nolder blacks contribute to the black\u00adwhite dis-\nparities in service use at the national level. Future\nresearch should examine local and regional bar-\nriers that affect mental health service use among\nolder blacks in geographic areas where greater dis-\nparities exist. Given that racial disparities existed\nonly in the South across the four regions in the\nUnited States, future research should focus on the\nsouthern states to conduct more detailed analyses\nat the state-level to elucidate potential reasons for\ndisparities.\nFunding\nThis study is supported by a pilot research grant (PI, Giyeon Kim)\nfrom the Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research\nInstitute on Aging.\nReferences\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).
