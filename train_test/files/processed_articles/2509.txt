Harris2,5 and Penny Gordon-Larsen2,6\n Keywords: Adolescence, Obesity, Smoking, Gene-environment interaction\nBackground\nAdolescence is a sensitive period for weight gain and\nhealth risk behaviors, such as smoking [1, 2]. Obese\nsmokers suffer 2.8\u00ad3.7 times greater mortality than\nthose who are not obese and do not smoke [3]. In the\nUS, nearly 90 % of adult daily smokers begin smoking in\nsmokers every year [5]. Many adolescents, particularly\nfemales, use smoking as an appetite control strategy [6, 7].\nFemales with greater body dissatisfaction are more likely\nto smoke [8], and obesity increases the likelihood of being\nhighly addicted to nicotine during adolescence [9]. The ef-\nfects of smoking differ by gender, in that smoking has a re-\nported antiestrogenic effect in females, which may\ninfluence fat deposition [10, 11]. Adolescent smoking also\nvaries by ethnicity, with Hispanic teens that have\nexpressed concern about their weight being more likely to\n* Correspondence: kristin.young@unc.edu\n1Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health,\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA\n2Carolina Population Center, Gillings School of Global Public Health,\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2015 Young et al.

While it has been\ndemonstrated that weight is generally lower among adult\nsmokers (ages 25\u00ad44 years), and higher among former\nadult smokers, this trend has not been observed in some\nweight control effects of smoking may dissipate over\ntime, as long-term smokers (20+ years) are heavier than\nnever or former smokers, and heavy smokers are more\nlikely to be obese than both other smokers and non-\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identi-\nfied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribut-\ning to variation in adult body mass index (BMI) [16\u00ad21],\nand evidence suggests these loci may have the greatest\ninfluence on adolescent BMI [22\u00ad28]. While many stud-\nies of obesity control for smoking status [29\u00ad32], few\nhave examined the interaction between smoking and\nobesity susceptibility loci on BMI [33\u00ad36]. However,\nsmoking has been implicated in appetite suppression\nthrough the POMC neural pathway [37], and loci in this\npathway (POMC and MC4R) increase obesity risk [18, 38].\nOur study examines the interaction between current smok-\ning and 40 GWAS-identified and replicated SNPs associ-\non adolescent BMI in a multiethnic nationally-\nrepresentative cohort.\nResults\nSample size, gender, mean age, percent median BMI\n(%MBMI), smoking status and other descriptives are pre-\nsented by ancestry in Table 1. In the full sample, 11 % of\nile), while a further 17 % were overweight (BMI  85th per-\ncentile). African Americans (AA) had the highest percent\nobese (15.8 %), while Hispanic Americans (HA) had the\nhighest percent overweight (21.9 %). Two-sample t-tests\nshowed significantly higher BMI and %MBMI in female,\nbut not male, smokers than their non-smoking counter-\nparts (Additional file 1: Table S1).\nIn main effects analyses of SNPs on %MBMI among\nEuropean Americans (EA), 33 of the established 39 BMI\nSNPs were directionally consistent with previous results\n[18], and 19 of those showed nominally significant asso-\nciation with %MBMI (Additional file 2: Table S2). In\nAA, 12 out of 17 generalizable SNPs had effects on\n%MBMI that were directionally consistent with the pub-\nlished literature, and 5 of these were nominally associ-\nated with %MBMI (Additional file 3: Table S3). In our\nHA sample, 22 out of 31 established BMI loci in HA\nwere directionally consistent with effects reported for\nBMI in EA adults, and 3 of these were nominally associ-\nated with %MBMI (Additional file 4: Table S4). Inter-\naction analyses were subsequently performed for these\nand HA, respectively.\nTwo SNPs showed nominal (p < 0.05) evidence for\ninteraction with smoking on %MBMI in EA adolescents\nOne SNP had a significant interaction effect after the\nmost stringent multiple test correction for 67 SNPs\nfile 3: Tables S3 and Additional file 4: Tables S4). Fig. 1 il-\nlustrates results from stratified analyses of these SNPs on\n%MBMI by smoking status. In all cases, the estimated\neffect of the BMI-increasing allele was more pro-\nnounced in smokers (Fig. 1 and Table 2). None of\nthese SNPs showed a main effect on smoking status\n(Additional file 2: Table S2, and Additional file 4:\nTable S4).\nExamination of three-way interactions (SNP x smoking\nstatus \u00d7 sex) for these three SNPs revealed only MC4R\nhad a nominally significant interaction effect [ = 5.44\nit is not unexpected that statistical evidence supporting\na three-way interaction would be difficult to detect.\nWhen we investigated SNP \u00d7 smoking status interaction\nfor MC4R in EA stratified by sex, we found a nominally\n0.50]. In addition, when we stratified the effect of the\nobesity-risk genotype by sex and smoking status, we\nnoted differential association with %MBMI (Table 2).\nNone of the three loci that showed nominal significance\nfor interaction were associated (p < 0.05) with %MBMI\nin female nonsmokers, while only MC4R was nominally\nsignificant in male nonsmokers. Both TNNI3K [ = 6.41\np = 0.01] were nominally significant in HA and EA\nfemale smokers, respectively. MC4R was significant\nafter correction for multiple testing in EA female\nDiscussion\nWhile previous research has shown that some smoking-\nassociated loci influence BMI in smokers but not never\nsmokers [39], and some established BMI loci are associ-\nated with smoking [40], few studies have examined the\ninteraction between smoking and genetic risk for obesity\non adolescent BMI. In this nationally representative\nstudy of adolescents, we identify two nominally signifi-\nwhich showed a comparatively stronger association in\nTable 1 Sex, age, BMI, %MBMI and smoking status by ethnicity in the Add Health analytic sample\nRegion of US\nAfrican Americans\nHispanic Americans\nAncestry\nImmigrant status\nsmokers vs. nonsmokers. Sex-stratified analyses revealed\nthat, in general, smoking had a greater estimated effect\non %MBMI in adolescent females. In particular, EA fe-\nmale smokers who carry the MC4R obesity susceptibility\nallele had a %MBMI that was 5.48 % higher than non-\nsmokers that carry the allele (p = 8.4E\u00ad06).\nOur results are consistent with previous literature, in that\nnot all obesity susceptibility loci showed a greater estimated\npositive effect in smokers (data not shown). Among EA, 20\nof 33 BMI loci (61 %) had a larger estimated effect in\n22 BMI loci (55 %) had a larger estimated effect in smokers\nversus nonsmokers among AA and HA, respectively. In\naddition, the interaction effects we observed were generally\nmore pronounced in women than in men. Previous ana-\nlysis of 14 established BMI loci in EA and AA adults\nfound no significant interaction (p < 0.05) between BMI\nSNPs and smoking [33]. However, the authors noted a\n3x increase in the estimated effect of the FTO\na suggestive stronger estimated effect of the TMEM18\nrisk allele in AA female former/never smokers. No dif-\nferential effects were reported for men. In our analysis,\nEA female smokers had a 1.22x increase in the esti-\nmated effect of the FTO risk allele, while EA male\nsmokers had a 1.17 increased estimated effect of the\nFTO risk allele, compared to nonsmokers. We did not\nexamine the effect of TMEM18 on BMI in AA, as that\nSNP did not generalize in the recent AA GWAS.\nIn our study, HA adolescent smokers carrying the\n8.46 %MBMI units larger than their non-smoking\npeers (p = 5.9E\u00ad05).

In mouse models,\nTNNI3K expression has been linked to cardiac function\nand cardiac oxidative stress following myocardial infarc-\ntion [44, 45]. Both smoking and obesity increase systemic\noxidative stress [46] and risk of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD), and the influence of TNNI3K on cardiac function\nsuggests a possible biological pathway for this interaction.\nTwo loci showed nominally significant effects for\ninteraction in EA adolescents, POC5 and MC4R.

This variant does\nlie, however, within 500 kb of HMGCR, a gene involved\nin lipid metabolism. Cigarette smoking increases dyslip-\nidemia by inducing lipolysis in adipose tissue [50, 51],\noffering a promising avenue for future studies.\ngest influence on %MBMI in EA female smokers [ = 5.48\nVariants in MC4R are associated with monogenic obesity\nand show differential effects on BMI by sex and age, with\na greater influence on adolescent females [22, 52].

Variants in and near MC4R have been linked\neating behavior [59], higher fat intake [60], and lower en-\nergy expenditure [61, 62]. In animal and some human\nmodels, variants near MC4R have been shown to dispro-\nportionally affect adiposity in females [63\u00ad69]. While\nnicotine has been implicated in animal models as having a\nhypophagic effect on the leptin-melanocortin pathway in-\nfluencing feeding behavior [37, 70], other research has\nshown a 2.9 fold increased risk of metabolic syndrome\namong smokers who carry a risk variant at a SNP\nalso been associated with a gender and temporal-specific\neffect on BMI, as well as smoking behavior [72]. Our re-\nsults suggest MC4R obesity risk variants might mitigate\nthe appetite suppressant effect of nicotine in adolescent\nfemale smokers.\nAdd Health represents a unique sample during a sensi-\ntive developmental period, when risky health behaviors\nare being established. Add Health is a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of US adolescents who are being\nfollowed into adulthood. As such, our results can be\nconsidered generalizable to American adolescents enter-\nare not generalizable to adolescents at other time pe-\nriods or in other countries. While we are fortunate to\nhave measured heights and weights for the majority of\nour sample, current smoking was self-reported, though\nthe questions used to assess smoking status in Add\nHealth have been validated among adolescents. Our\nstudy was also limited by the lack of established BMI\nloci in all ancestries, particularly HA. We also recognize\nthat we were possibly underpowered to detect effects\ndue to small sample size [73], and that our approach\ncannot account for SNPs with an interaction effect but\nno measurable marginal effect on %MBMI. Given our\nsample size (N = 5075) and other model parameters in\nEA, we have between 47 and 52 % power to detect nom-\ninally significant interaction effects as large as those seen\nWhile our power is limited, pointing to the need to rep-\nlicate our results in larger future studies, our results do\nsuggest potential SNPs for further interrogation of the\ninfluence of smoking on BMI, particularly in adolescent\nfemales.\nConclusions\nOur study highlights potentially important sex differ-\nences in obesity risk by smoking status in adolescents,\nwith those who may be most likely to initiate smoking\n(i.e., adolescent females), being at greatest risk for poor\nhealth outcomes (exacerbating genetic obesity risk).\nSmoking influences central body fat distribution, and re-\nsearch suggests this effect could be particularly pro-\nnounced among women [74]. In addition, smokers have\na greater risk of metabolic syndrome [71, 75] and dyslip-\nidemia [76], as well as a much greater risk of mortality,\nparticularly for CVD deaths among obese women under\nage 65 [3], highlighting the importance of targeting\nsmoking early in adolescence to prevent poorer health in\nadulthood.\nMethods\nStudy sample\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult\nHealth (Add Health) is a nationally-representative, pro-\nspective cohort of adolescents from the US school-based\nhood (Table 2). Add Health selected a systematic ran-\ndom sample of 80 high schools and 52 feeder middle\nschools, representative of US schools with respect to re-\ngion, urbanicity, school type and size, and student demo-\ngraphics. Written informed consent was obtained from\nparticipants or a parent/guardian if the participant was a\nminor at the time of recruitment. Respondents were\nwhen respondents provided written informed consent\nfor participation in genetic studies (n = 12,234). Add\nHealth included a core sample plus subsamples of se-\nlected groups, including African American students with\nat least one parent with a college degree, collected under\nprotocols approved by the Institutional Review Board at\nthe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill covering\nrecruitment at all sites. The survey design and sampling\nframe have been described previously [77-79].\nRace/ethnicity\nAncestry informative genetic markers were not available, so\na self-reported race/ethnicity variable was constructed\nbased on survey responses regarding ancestral background\nand family relationship status from both participants and\ntheir parents at Wave I. We used a three-category classifi-\ncation: non-Hispanic European American (EA), non-\nHispanic African American (AA), and Hispanic American\n(HA). Within HA, we generated additional variables to ac-\ncount for subpopulation (Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/\nSouth American, Mexican, or Other Hispanic), as well as\nforeign-born status (first generation immigrants versus\nthose born in the US).\nSibling relatedness\nAdd Health oversampled related adolescents, resulting in\nholds [80]. Familial relatedness was classified according to\nparticipant and parental self-report. Twin zygosity was\nconfirmed by 11 molecular genetic markers [81].\nGenetic characterization\nThe 40 SNPs genotyped in the current study were identi-\nfied in published GWAS from the Genetic Investigation of\nAnthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium for BMI in\nusing TaqMan assays and the ABI Prism 7900R Sequence\nDetection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,\nUSA). Primer sequences and TaqMan probes are avail-\nable upon request. The genotype call rate ranged\nblind duplicates was 0.3 %. SNPs that failed tests for\nHardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) (p < 0.001)\nresulting in 39 SNPs for this analysis, as listed in\nAdditional file 5: Table S5.\nCriteria for generalizability\nAcross all groups, to the extent possible, generalizability\nwas defined as similar direction of effect as reported in the\nliterature and nominal statistical significance (p < 0.05) [24].\nThese criteria make generalization in the EA subpopulation\nstraightforward, since these associations were defined in EA\nadults. A recent large AA GWAS [82], however, suggests\nthat some SNPs fail to generalize, either due to limited\npower or because of linkage disequilibrium differences that\nfail to capture the signal of the functional variant. We thus\nexcluded 15 SNPs in AA that have not shown evidence for\ngeneralization (i.e., SNP effect estimates were directionally\ninconsistent and evidence for association was p > 0.20 in\nthe recent AA GWAS) [82]. Similar results were reported\nin a recent HA GWAS of postmenopausal women, where\nonly 9 of 32 established BMI loci showed evidence for asso-\nciation. As this analysis was conducted in a limited sample,\nhowever, we chose to retain all directionally consistent loci\nin our HA analysis [42]. In addition, SNPs with insufficient\ncell size for analysis (n < 10 individuals per genotype) were\nSNPs in HA for the interaction analyses (included SNPs\nhighlighted in bold in Additional file 5: Table S5).\nAnalytic sample\nrespondents provided samples, with consent, from\nwhich DNA was extracted and genotyped (n = 12,066).\nTo be eligible our study, individuals had to have at\nand be between the ages of 12 and 21 years at either\nadolescents, we excluded: the monozygotic twin with\nfewer genotyped loci (n = 139), individuals of Native\nAmerican (n = 57), Asian (n = 436) or unclassified (n\n47), and those missing data for geographic region (n\n= 67), BMI (n = 2), or current smoking (n = 46). The\nanalytic sample was selected from waves II or III to\ncapture the age range of 12\u00ad21 years, and all covari-\nates match the wave at which BMI was measured.\nBody mass index (BMI)\nWeight and height were measured during in-home\nsurveys using standardized procedures. BMI (kg/m2)\nwas calculated using measured height and weight\nassessed at Waves II or III when participants were\nbetween the age of 12 and 21 years, with priority for\nyounger age at measurement (Wave II: n = 7681), unless\nthe respondent was not seen at Wave II and was still be-\nreported heights and weights, which have been previously\nvalidated in Add Health, were substituted for those who\nrefused measurement and/or weighed more than the scale\nchanges in weight and height with growth and develop-\nment, BMI varies by age and sex, which necessitates using\nage- and sex-specific BMI Z-scores relative to a reference\nHowever, these growth curves do not represent the tails of\nthe distribution well, which is a particular issue in a cohort\nwith considerable upward skew in distribution relative to\nthe CDC/NCHS 2000 healthy reference. A strategy to\ndeal with this is to use percent of the CDC/NCHS 2000\nmedian [85], which also has the benefit of ease in inter-\npretation relative to the Z-score. Accordingly, our out-\ncome for all analyses was the percent of the CDC/\nCurrent smoking\nCurrent smoking was based on self-report, which has\nbeen previously validated among adolescents [86], and\nwas defined as smoking at least 1 day in the last 30 days.\n[2, 87, 88] Current smoking status was queried at Waves\nII (Ncurrent_smokers\nto match the wave at which BMI was measured. To meas-\nure the effect of BMI-related SNPs on current smoking,\nwe performed main effects logistic regression using smok-\ning status as the outcome and SNP as predictor, stratified\nby ancestry (Additional file 2: Tables S2, Additional file 3:\nTables S3 and Additional file 4: Tables S4).\nStatistical analysis\nIn ancestry-stratified, multivariable interaction (SNPxsmok-\ning) models with %MBMI as the outcome, we controlled\nfor age, sex, geographic region, and self-reported heights\nand weights using Stata (v13.1, Stata Corp, College Station,\nTexas). In non-EA populations, we also controlled for over-\nsampling of adolescents from highly-educated African\nAmerican families (n = 355), and Hispanic subpopulation:\n(n = 102), as well as an indicator for foreign-born status\n(n = 267). Sample design effects and familial relatedness\nwere accounted for by including separate random effects\nfor school and family. When a nominally significant inter-\naction (p < 0.05) was detected, we ran additional inter-\naction models (SNP x smoking status, stratified by sex;\nand SNP x smoking status x sex), and examined SNP ef-\nfects in models stratified by smoking status and sex, to fa-\ncilitate interpretation. To correct for multiple testing, we\napplied a Bonferroni correction equal to 0.05/number of\nAvailability of data and materials\nAdd Health adheres to the NIH policy on data sharing,\nbut due to the sensitive nature of Add Health data, ac-\ncess is limited and governed by the Add Health data\nmanagement security plan to ensure respondent confi-\ndentiality.
