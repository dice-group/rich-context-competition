The purpose of this study is to adopt a different approach to define market area and\nmeasure the level of competition to examine whether hospital competition has a positive effect on hospital behavior, taking\nquality indicator projects participation as an example. A total of 238 hospitals located in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung were\nrecruited in this study. Competition index was used as the independent variable, and participation lists of Taiwan Clinical\nPerformance Indicator and Taiwan Healthcare Indicator Series in 2012 were used as dependent variables. All data used in this\nstudy were retrieved from the 2012 national hospital profiles and the participation list of the 2 quality indicator projects in\n2012; these profiles are issued by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare annually. Geopolitical boundaries and 4 kinds of\nfixed radiuses were used to define market area. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and hospital density were used to measure the\nlevel of competition. A total of 12 competition indices were produced in this study by employing the geographic information\nsystem, while max-rescaled R2 was used to evaluate and compare the models on goodness of fit. The results show that the\neffects of hospital competition on quality indicator projects participation were varied, which mean different indicators for\nmarket competition might reveal different conclusions. Furthermore, this study also found the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index\nat 5-km radius was the optimum competition index.\n",

It is no longer the preserve of enthusiastic volunteers\nbut instead a part of the daily routine of all those involved in\ndelivering health care. It has also become a statutory obliga-\ntion in many countries.1 In response to the growing demands\nfor quality transparency, costs control, and reduced varia-\ntions in clinical practices, assessing the quality of health care\nhas become increasingly important for different stakehold-\ners, including health care providers, decision makers, and\npurchasers of health care services.2 However, quality cannot\nbe improved without a measurement baseline. The Quality-\nof-Care Framework (Structure-Process-Outcome) proposed\nby Donabedian is the most important model for assessing the\nquality of care.3 To assess the quality of care and to develop\nthe measurement instruments, researchers have used this\nmodel along with quality indicators.\nThe Taiwan National Health Insurance Scheme was\nlaunched in 1995. Since then, it has not only increased the\naccessibility of health care for Taiwanese citizens but also\nincreased the level of competition among hospitals. Hospitals\nare looking for any means to achieve an advantage, such as\npurchasing high-tech and expensive equipment, or imple-\nmenting new quality improvement activities, such as partici-\npating in quality indicator projects.4 The quality indicator has\nbeen used in Taiwan since the 1980s. It was an innovative\ntopic, and only a few hospitals adopted it at that time2;\n1National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taiwan\n2National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan\n3Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nChung-Jen Wei, Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, Fu Jen\nCatholic University, No. 510, Zhongzheng Road, Xinzhuang Dist., New\nnowadays, however, it has become one of the most commonly\nseen quality improvement activities in Taiwan.5 Besides,\nquality indicator is a major tool for assessing hospital perfor-\nmance. It has been used extensively in the medical industry\nsince the last decade; not only was it used for internal organi-\nzation improvement but it has also been used for payment,6,7\nreport cards,8,9 accreditation schemes,10 and other external\napplications.\nMany studies have discussed the effects of hospital com-\npetition on quality improvement activities adoption,11-13 but\nthese studies have demonstrated inconclusive and sometimes\ncontradictory findings on the effects of hospital competi-\ntion.14 For example, Sethi et al15 found hospitals located in a\nhigher competitive environment were prone to adopt new\ntechnology for endovascular aneurysm repair treatment.\nHowever, Weiner et al16 found that market competition is\nnegatively associated with quality improvement implemen-\ntation scope. In addition to the difference of contextual fac-\ntors and organizational characteristics, most existing studies\nhave usually adopted a single approach and definition to\nmeasure hospital market competition. The variations in indi-\ncator measurement methods might lead to different results,\nwhich included the approaches to define market area and to\nmeasure level of competition.17,18 According to the review by\nWong et al,19 there are 6 approaches to define market area,\nincluding geopolitical boundaries, fixed radius, variable\nradius, patient flow, cross elasticity of demand, and Elzinga-\nHogarty. Regarding level of competition, there are 3 indica-\ntors for measuring the level of competition, including the\nnumber of hospitals, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI),\nand concentration ratio. Wong et al also found geopolitical\nboundaries, fixed radius, variable radius, and patient flow are\nmost commonly used for defining market area, and the num-\nber of hospitals and the HHI are most frequently used for\nmeasuring hospital competition within market areas.\nA brief summary of the most common approaches to\ndefine market area and to measure level of competition is as\nfollows: Geopolitical boundary is the most common\napproach to define the market area because of its ease of\nimplementation, but this approach might not be consistent\nwith daily life operations in practice. For example, for 2\nhospitals located on both sides of a boundary, they would be\nproviding service to the same community and population,\nbut each belongs to different market areas. Although a fixed\nand variable radius approach can overcome this disadvan-\ntage of geopolitical boundary approach, defining the opti-\nmal radius is still a major challenge.20,21 Patient flow is the\nmost sophisticated approach to depict market area, and it is\nalso the most difficult approach to employ. As for measuring\nthe level of competition, the number of hospitals has the\nadvantages of being intuitive and easy to implement.\nHowever, the disadvantage of this measure is that it does not\nreflect differences in market share. The HHI was the sum of\nsquared market shares for all the hospitals in the market. In\nthe context of hospital competition, a hospital's market\nshare is frequently calculated as the number of discharges\nfrom that hospital divided by the total number of discharges\nfrom all hospitals in the market.22\nAlthough the lack of consensus to measure the level of\nmarket competition might be a problem, comparative studies\non the effect of hospital competition indicators are limited.\nTherefore, the purpose of this study is to adopt a different\napproach to define the market area and measure the level of\ncompetition, to examine whether hospital competition has a\npositive effect on quality indicator project participation or\notherwise. Due to the characteristics of the data, we only\nused geopolitical boundaries and fixed radius to define mar-\nket areas, and adopted the number of hospitals and the HHI\nfor measuring hospital competition within market areas in\nthis study.\nMethods\nData Source\nThere were 2 data sources used in this study. The first was the\n2012 national hospital profile issued by the Taiwan Ministry\nof Health and Welfare annually. It includes information on\nvariables relevant to medical services, such as hospital size,\nnumber of all kinds of medical staff, inpatient and outpatient\nservices, and patients' length of stay. We used these data to\nobtain the characteristics of hospitals and the calculation of\nthe hospital competition index. The second data source was\nthe quality indicator project participant list in 2012, which\nincludes the 2 major quality indicator projects in Taiwan,\nnamely, Taiwan Clinical Performance Indicator (TCPI) and\nTaiwan Healthcare Indicator Series (THIS).23\nIn 1999, the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital\nAccreditation introduced the International Quality Indicator\nProject (IQIP), named Taiwan Quality Indicator Project\n(TQIP). After a 10-year cooperation with IQIP, the Taiwan\nJoint Commission on Hospital Accreditation used this expe-\nrience to develop TCPI that can further meet hospitals'\ndemand. Unlike TQIP, the THIS was developed by local\nexperts, the Taiwan College of Healthcare Executives,\nquality indicator projects. Hospitals submit their data regu-\nlarly, where either Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital\nAccreditation or Taiwan College of Healthcare Executives\nwill provide feedback periodically. Besides, both of them\nare the largest and most important quality indicator projects\nin Taiwan. Most hospitals select either TCPI or THIS to\nparticipate.\nIn addition, we selected the 3 major cities Taipei, Taichung,\nand Kaohsiung as our study area. Taiwan is a mountainous\nisland shaped like a leaf that is narrow at both ends. The ter-\nrain in Taiwan is divided into 2 parts: the flat to gently rolling\nplains in the west and the mostly rugged forest-covered\nmountains in the east. Around 90% of the population in\nTaiwan lives in the west coastal plain, which is also where\nYu et al 3\nmost hospitals are located, especially in Taipei, Taichung, and\nKaohsiung. For homogeneity, hospitals located in these cities\nwere included in our study.\nIndependent Variable: Competition Index\nWe adopted geopolitical boundaries and the fixed radius\napproach to define the market area. The geopolitical bound-\naries were set from both the town and county boundaries and\nabsence of sufficient data from local studies, the chosen dis-\ntances were based on the results of expert panel meeting. The\nlevel of market competition was measured by hospital den-\nsity and the HHI. We used hospital density to reflect the\nnumber of hospitals in an area because it was easier to inter-\npret than the number of hospitals per se. The HHI values\nranged from 1/N to 1, where N is the number of hospitals in\nthe market. A high HHI value means high market concentra-\ntion. The advantage of the HHI is that it reflects both the\nnumber of hospitals and their relative market share. We\nemployed the geographic information system (ArcGIS 9.3)\nto describe the market and calculate the hospital density and\nHHI within an area. A total of 12 competition indices were\nproduced in this study.\nDependent Variable: Quality Indicator Project\nParticipation\nThe quality indicator project participation was used as the\ndependent variable. If a hospital participated in TCPI or\nTHIS and updated data routinely (at least twice per year),\nthen it would be identified as a participating hospital, other-\nwise a nonparticipating hospital.\nControl Variables\nIn addition to competition index and quality indicator project\nparticipation, this study also collected ownership, size, and\nratio of discharge to number of health care professionals (i.e.,\nphysicians, nurses, administrative staff). In some capacity, it\nis necessary to input resources when implementing quality\nimprovement activities; sufficient manpower/workload is\none of the key successful factors in literature.24 Therefore,\nwe used these 3 variables to represent the proxy of workload,\nand these 3 professional indexes are usually highly participa-\ntive in quality improvement activities. Besides, these 3 work-\nload variables were categorized into 3 groups, using the first\nand third quartiles (Q1 and Q3) as cutoff points.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version\n9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). In statistical\ntesting, frequency and percentage were used to present\nthe hospital characteristics. In bivariate analysis, potential\npredictors of quality indicator projects were examined by\nusing the chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to\nassess project participation, and max-rescaled R2 was used to\nevaluate and compare the models on goodness of fit.25\nResults\nThe descriptive analysis of sample hospitals, and comparison\namong participating hospitals and nonparticipating hospitals\nis demonstrated in Table 1. A total of 238 hospitals were\nincluded in this study, most of which are medium-sized hos-\npitals (50-300 beds); two-thirds of the sample were private\nhospitals, while the percentage of public and not-for-profit\nhospitals were 16% and 18%, respectively. In terms of com-\nparison of participating hospitals and nonparticipating hospi-\ntals, larger sized hospitals, nonprivate hospitals, and higher\nratio of discharge to the number of health care professionals\nwere prone to participate in quality indicator projects.\nTable 2 shows the results of model comparison, where\nmodel 0 represents the base model, which only included all\ncontrol variables. Twelve competition indices were then\nplaced into the baseline model respectively. The results\nshowed the effects of hospital competition on quality indica-\ntor projects participation were varied, which means different\ndefinitions of market competition indicator might lead to dif-\nferent conclusions.\nFurthermore, the results also revealed the model fit of\ndistance-based market area models (models 5-12) was better\nthan geopolitical boundary models (models 1-4), and the\neffect of competition index in models 1 to 4 was not signifi-\ncant. The results of this study also demonstrated the competi-\ntion indices that used geopolitical boundaries to define\nmarket area could only improve the model fit slightly, and\nmost of them were not significant. Finally, we also found\nmodel 10 had the best-fitting model among all models, which\nmeant a 5-km radius with HHI was the best competition\nindex to examine the effects on quality indicator projects\nparticipation.\nDiscussion\nCompetition drives the quality of care in many health care\nsystems, in addition to the more altruistic motivations that\nhealth care workers often report. This is true not only in\nTaiwan but also in many developed countries, including the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom, as health care organi-\nzations worldwide urgently search for ways to improve both\nquality and cost-effectiveness.26 Such competition shapes\nhospital strategies implemented to adapt to the market envi-\nronment and needs, which can lead to a medical arms race.27\nIn this study, we examined the effect of competition on qual-\nity indicator projects participation by using geopolitical\nboundaries and fixed radius to define market area, and hospi-\ntal density and HHI to measure the level of competition. The\nresults show that the effects of hospital competition on quality\nindicator projects participation were varied, meaning the vari-\nations in competition indicator measurement methods may\nlead to different results. And this study also found 5 km was\nthe optimum radius to define the market area.\nFurthermore, 3 issues merit further discussion. First of all,\nwhich approach is appropriate for defining market area?\nPrevious researchers usually used geopolitical boundaries to\ndefine hospital market areas. Although measures of these\nboundaries are easy to calculate and are linked to demo-\ngraphic data, they do not take account of hospitals' competi-\ntiveness or how they are affected by the so-called\nneighborhood factors that are geographical rather than geo-\npolitical. For example, 2 nearby hospitals that happen to be\non different sides of a geopolitical boundary may compete\nwith each other fiercely. The results of this study demon-\nstrated the competition indices that were using geopolitical\nboundary to define market area could only improve the\nmodel fit slightly, and most of them were not significant.\nAlong with computer technology development, defining the\nmarket area has become easier today. For instance, GPS can\nbe employed to implement the radius-based approach, which\nwe adopted in the present study. However, the selection of an\noptimal radius is another challenge.According to the original\ndefinition of this approach, a radius is determined by the\ncatchment area in which 75% to 90% of a hospital's patients\nreside.28 Nevertheless, this study could not obtain such infor-\nmation; therefore, we modified the fixed radius approach by\nreplacing the standard coverage rate with 4 different radii\nwhich were determined by an expert panel.\nSecond, which approach is appropriate to measure the\nlevel of competition? Both hospital density and the HHI are\nmost commonly used in hospital competition studies; the pros\nand cons of these are described above. Which one is better in\nmeasuring the level of hospital competition? According to the\ndefinition, the HHI should better represent the level of hospi-\ntal competition; however, our findings did not support this. In\nterms of improving model fit, 2 models showed that hospital\ndensity was better than the HHI (models 3 and 11 vs models\n1 and 12), which used the same market area. In contrast, there\nwere also 4 models that showed the HHI was better than hos-\nThe findings were not consistent; therefore, we are unable to\ndetermine which one is better. The phenomenon might be\nexplained by the fact that hospital behavior is affected not\nonly by hospital competition but also by internal factors such\nas leaders' values, attitudes, and educational background14,29\nand resource availability.12,24 This information was not avail-\nable in this study and is therefore also a major limitation.\nFinally, regarding the relationship between hospital\ncompetition and quality indicator project participation.\nTable 1.

Q = quartile.\nTable 2. The Comparison Among Odds Ratio and Competition Model Fitting.\nCompetition measures\nNote. All models are adjusted for ownership, size, and ratio of discharge to number of health care professionals. HHI = Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.\nAlthough the findings of this study were varied, at least,\nthere was no negative effect of hospital competition on\nquality indicator project participation. However, why does\nhospital competition drive hospitals to take the same\naction? The adoption of similar actions within a given insti-\ntutional environment can be explained by organizational\nisomorphism30 and institutional theory.31 These theories\nillustrate that organizations experience pressure to conform\nto their institutional environment because of the operation\nof coercive pressures from political institutions, normative\npressures from occupational and professional constituen-\ncies, and mimetic pressures from other organizations with\nwhich they compare themselves with.\nIn summary, the results of this study have several contri-\nbutions. In terms of theoretical contribution, except the rela-\ntionship between hospital competition and quality indicator\nprojects participation were varied, our findings also showed\nthere was no negative relationship between hospital competi-\ntion and quality indicator projects participation when various\nhospital competition indicators were used. Therefore, our\nfindings might prove that hospitals would change their\nbehavior due to mimetic pressures or normal pressures,\nwhich are components of the institutional theory. Regarding\npractical management/policy implications, the results also\nimply that health authorities should pay more attention on\ndefining market area and, for hospitals located in low com-\npetition areas, for example, providing incentives to encour-\nage the more adoption of quality improvement activities. For\nfuture research, selecting an appropriate approach and defi-\nnition to define market area and to measure the level of com-\npetition is an important issue for future study. Nowadays,\nresearchers define market area more precisely by employing\ngeographic information systems. The appropriateness of\nusing geopolitical boundary to define market area should be\nconsidered in future studies.\nAltogether, this study applied a geopolitical boundary and\nfixed radius approach to define market area, and also adopted\nHHI and hospital density to measure the level of competi-\ntion. A total of 12 hospital competition indices were pro-\nduced in this study and were also used to examine whether\nhospital competition had positive effect on quality indicator\nprojects participation. However, even with these advantages,\nthe study was still subject to 2 major limitations as described\nbelow:\n1. The information of patients' residences is not avail-\nable. It is not possible for our study to adopt the\npatient flow approach to define market area.\nFurthermore, a variable radius approach is also inap-\nplicable because of the lack of data mentioned above.\nThe expert meeting which we held in this study\nattempted to alleviate this limitation.\n2. Across-sectional study design might hinder the expla-\nnation of the results. This study demonstrated vari-\nous approaches and definitions to measure hospital\ncompetition that could lead to inconsistent results.\nHowever, the causal effects between hospital compe-\ntition and quality indicator project participation\nshould be explored by a longitudinal study instead of\na cross-sectional study.\nConclusions\nIn summary, our study adopted the geopolitical boundaries\nand fixed radius to define market area, while the HHI and\nhospital density were used for measuring the level of compe-\ntition. A total of 12 competition indicators were produced in\nthis study. After applying them to examine the relationship\nbetween hospital competition and quality indicator project\nparticipation, we found the results varied by different com-\npetition indicators. Our findings demonstrated that the incon-\nsistent findings of existing hospital competition studies\nmight be caused by various measurement methods of compe-\ntition. Policy makers and further studies should take this\nissue into account.\n"
