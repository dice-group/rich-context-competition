    "abstract": "Abstract\nTeam-based care is a foundation of health care redesign models like the patient-centered medical home (PCMH). Yet few\npractices rigorously examine how the implementation of PCMH relates to teamwork. We identified factors associated with\nthe perception of a practice operating as a real team. An online workforce survey was conducted with all staff of 12 primary\ncare sites of Cambridge Health Alliance at different stages of PCMH transformation. Bivariate and multivariate analyses\nof factors associated with teamwork perceptions were conducted. In multivariate models, having effective leadership was\nthe main factor associated with practice teamwork perceptions (odds ratio [OR], 10.49; 95% confidence interval [CI],\n5.39-20.43); in addition, practicing at a site in an intermediate stage of PCMH transformation was also associated with\nenhanced team perceptions (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.28-4.64). In a model excluding effective leadership, respondents at sites in\nan intermediate stage of PCMH transformation (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4) and who had higher care team behaviors (such\nand higher job satisfaction (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.02-3.92) had higher practice teamwork perceptions. This study highlights the\nstrong association between effective leadership, care team behaviors and perceptions, and job satisfaction with perceptions\nthat practices operate as real teams. Although we cannot infer causality with these cross-sectional data, this study raises the\npossibility that providing attention to these factors may be important in augmenting practice teamwork perceptions.\n",

To provide the recommended acute,\nchronic, and preventive care for panels of 2500 patients, pri-\nmary care physicians would need to spend 21.7 hours daily,\nwhich they cannot.1-4 It is estimated that half of the tasks that\nprimary care physicians currently do can be completed by\nother team members.5 Thus, central to PCMH transformation\nis the development of high-functioning practice-based teams.\nUnderstanding primary care teams is essential given evi-\ndence that high-functioning teams and PCMHs support\nachievement of the quadruple aim6 of enhanced patient\nand improved joy in work.

Indeed, PCMH implementation\nis associated with increased physician burnout in some\ncases.14 It is imperative, therefore, to identify factors associ-\nated with primary care teams.\nStudies of health care teams have identified factors asso-\nciated with high-functioning teams, including care team\nbehaviors (such as huddles)15 and effective leadership.16\nHowever, these factors were identified through qualitative\nmethods and do not allow examination of the association\nbetween these factors and perceptions of practices operating\nas real teams. As primary care sites transform to team-based\ncare, they will benefit from understanding elements associ-\nated with perceptions of practices operating as real teams.\nThe objective of this study was to identify factors associ-\nated with the perception of a practice operating as a real team\nin a health care setting. We examined the relationship\nbetween the perception that practice operates as a real team\nand other key factors identified in literature as being associ-\nated with teams, including effective leadership, care team\nsupportive structures, care team behaviors, and job satisfac-\nMethods\nSetting\nCambridge Health Alliance (CHA), an integrated delivery\nand public health system, cares for 140\nEastern Massachusetts.

In groups of 2 to 3, these prac-\ntices entered into national and state learning PCMH col-\nlaboratives. The central administration at CHA selected\nwhich sites and when they should join these collaboratives,\nand provided central support to sites to help them through\nthe process of transformation. Throughout the process, the\ncentral administration at CHA placed a strong emphasis on\nteams and team-based care. At the time of this study, 2 sites\nwere considered advanced PCMHs based on years spent in\ntransformation (>2 years, received National Committee for\nQuality Assurance [NCQA] level 3 PCMH recognition in\n(had yet to begin).\nSurvey Development\nWe developed an online 55-item survey with questions\ndrawn from validated instruments, including the Dartmouth\nTeamwork Survey17 and the Safety Net Medical Home\nInitiative Workforce Survey,14 as well as questions modified\nfrom other surveys (such as the National Health Service\nInnovation Survey18). Domains included (1) practice\nteamwork perceptions, (2) care team behaviors (eg, huddle\nfrequency) and care team perceptions (eg, care team operates\nas real team), (3) perception of job satisfaction and burnout,\nand (4) perceptions of effective leadership (please see appen-\ndix for source of items). Practice teamwork perceptions\ninquired about perceptions of the practice operating as a real\nteam; practices are commonly understood to be particular\nclinical site. Within practices, participants worked on inter-\ndisciplinary care teams with a subset of providers, medical\nassistant, nurses, and patient access representatives. Thus,\ncare team behavior and perceptions questions addressed the\nfrequency of particular behaviors and participants' percep-\ntions of those care teams. Perceptions of effective leadership\nwere assessed by agreement with the statement \"Leadership\ncreates an environment where things can be accomplished,\"\na question used in the Safety Net Medical Home Initiative\nWorkforce Survey.14 Responses generally included Likert\nscales ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\"\nWe pilot tested the survey with 2 sites. The study was\napproved by the CHA institutional review board.\nData Collection\nWe sent the anonymous and voluntary online survey to all\n609 staff members at 12 primary care sites 3 times via e-mail\nVariables\nPractice teamwork perceptions. The primary outcome, team-\nwork perception, was derived from agreement to the state-\nment \"People in the practice operate as a real team.\"\nResponses were dichotomized into high (agree or strongly\nagree) and low practice teamwork perceptions (strongly dis-\nagree, disagree, neither disagree nor agree).\nCare team behavior and care team perception scale scores.We\nconstructed a care team behavior scale score from 4 ques-\ntions assessing the frequency of care team behaviors in a\ngiven month including the number of times a team talked\nabout high-risk patients, planned care patients, and how to\nimprove the practice, as well as huddling. We assigned the\nfollowing number of points per response: 1: less than once\nper month, 2: once per month, 3: several times per month, 4:\nonce a week, 5: several times a week, and 6: daily or more\noften. We calculated average responses and dichotomized\nresponses into higher (4 points, representing the upper 15%\nof respondents) and lower (<4 points, representing the lower\n85% of respondents) care team behavior categories.\nWe constructed a care team perception scale score from\n5 questions asking respondents how much they agreed with\nthe following statements: \"People in my care team operate\nas a real team\"; \"When we experience a problem in my care\nteam, we make a serious effort to figure out what's really\ngoing on\"; \"Candid and open communication exists\nStout et al 3\nbetween physicians and other practice staff on my care\nteam\"; \"I know what the priority goals are in my team\"; and\n\"Employees in my care team report a strong sense of con-\nnection to their work.\" We assigned the following number\nof points per response: 1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3:\nneither agree nor disagree, 4: agree, and 5: strongly agree.\nWe calculated average response across the items and\ndichotomized responses into higher (4.75 points, repre-\nsenting the upper 15% of respondents) and lower (<4.75\npoints, representing the lower 85% of respondents) care\nteam perception categories.\nFor both scales, we dichotomized the responses for ease\nof interpretation, and to ensure sufficient sample sizes in\neach group. We selected the particular cutoffs to ensure\nmeaningful high groups. For example, because most of the\ncare team behaviors are more appropriately completed more\nthan several times per month, we set the cutoff at this point\nto create a meaningful high category. Internal consistency of\nscale scores was high (Cronbach alpha values of 0.79 for\ncare team behaviors and 0.90 for care team perception).\nOther variables.Other independent variables included job\nsatisfaction, length of employment at CHA, symptoms of job\nburnout, and effective leadership. Those agreeing or strongly\nagreeing with the statement \"Overall, I am satisfied with my\ncurrent job\" were considered to have high job satisfaction.\nRespondents agreeing or strongly agreeing with the state-\nment \"Leadership in the practice creates an environment\nwhere things can be accomplished\" were considered to have\neffective leadership. Respondents were categorized as hav-\ning no symptoms of burnout, mild burnout (1 symptom), or\nsevere burnout (symptoms that would not go away or feeling\ncompletely burned out). Respondents' primary roles were\ncollapsed into the following categories: provider (primary\ncare MD/NP/PA, OB/Gyn, mental health LICSW/MD/PhD/\nother, specialist, resident), administrator, clinical RN, front\ndesk/reception, medical assistant, and other patient care\n(navigator, nutritionist, etc).\nSite-specific measures included stage of PCMH transfor-\nmation (advanced, intermediate, or early), total primary care\npanel size, and proportion of patients >65 years old.\nData Analysis\nWe conducted bivariate analyses comparing respondents'\npractice teamwork perception (high vs low) using chi-\nsquare or independent samples t tests. Because we sought\nto understand the relationship of care team behaviors and\nperceptions with practice teamwork perceptions, we lim-\nited our analysis to those participants who reported they\nwere on a care team. To better understand the independent\nrelationship between practice teamwork perception and\nother variables, we conducted multivariable logistic regres-\nsion analyses. We excluded respondents due to missing data\non 1 or more variables in both models (N = 12). We also\nconducted secondary analyses excluding effective leader-\nship to better understand other factors associated with team\nperception. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4\n(SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). P values <.05 were\nconsidered to be statistically significant.\nResults\nSurveys were completed by 428 employees (70% response\nrate). We excluded participants reporting they were not on a\ncare team (n = 72), who did not answer the question on care\nteam (n = 26), or who did not answer the primary outcome\nquestion (n = 33), yielding a final sample size of 297 (see\nTable 1). Nonresponders and responders who were excluded\nbecause they reported they were not on a care team were\nfound across all stages of PCMH transition. Participants not\nanswering the primary outcome question did not differ from\nparticipants answering the question on the basis of role, ten-\nure, site-specific measures, satisfaction, burnout, and care\nteam perceptions but were more likely to have higher care\nRespondents held various roles with 41% providers, 16%\nclinical RNs, 20% medical assistants, and 22% other (front\ndesk/reception, administrators, and other).

In\nall, 62% reported having effective leadership.\nFactors Associated With Practice Teamwork\nPerception\nOverall, 56% of respondents reported high and 46% reported\nlow practice teamwork perceptions (Table 2). In bivariate\nanalyses (Table 3), stage of PCMH transformation, job satis-\nfaction, symptoms of burnout, care team behaviors, care\nteam perception, and effective leadership were associated\nwith practice teamwork perceptions. Among those practicing\nat early PCMH transformation stage sites, 46% had high\npractice teamwork perceptions, as compared with 54%\namong those practicing advanced PCMH transformation\nstage sites (P = .004).

Working intermediate PCMH transformation stage\n4.64) was the only other factor associated high practice\nteamwork perception. While no other variables achieved sta-\ntistical significance, the ORs for higher care team behaviors\nand higher care team perception were greater than 2.0, sug-\ngesting that these factors contributed to practice teamwork\nperceptions.\nGiven the strength of effective leadership, we conducted\nsecondary analyses excluding leadership to identify other\nfactors influencing team-based perceptions (model 2). In\nmodel 2, respondents with higher care team behaviors (OR,\npractice teamwork perceptions.

Another key factor was stage of PCMH\ntransformation; respondents at intermediate PCMH transfor-\nmation stage sites were more than twice as likely to report\nhigh practice teamwork perceptions than those in early\nstages. In models excluding effective leadership, working at\nintermediate PCMH transformation stage sites, having high\ncare team behaviors, high care team perceptions, and high\njob satisfaction were associated with high practice teamwork\nperceptions; for each of these, respondents were 2 to 3 times\nas likely to have high practice teamwork perceptions.\nWhile the importance of leadership engagement in PCMH\ntransformation has previously been examined qualitatively,16\nthis is the first time that the strong association between effec-\ntive leadership and practice teamwork perceptions has been\ndemonstrated in a health care setting. This finding may pro-\nvide further evidence for the concept that coaching leaders\nTable 2. Responses to Key Questions.\nAll respondents\n n (%)\nJob satisfaction\nSymptoms of burnout\nEffective leadership\nCare team behaviors\nCare team perception\nStout et al 5\non how to support teams is a critical strategy for the emer-\ngence of a team-based model of care. Alternatively, it may\nsuggest that when practice teamwork exists, leaders may\nthen be able to facilitate operations more effectively.\nAt the same time, our finding that staff who reported\nhigh care team behaviors (such as huddles) and care team\nperceptions had higher practice teamwork perceptions\npoints to these factors as potential enabling factors of team\ndevelopment. While the cross-sectional nature of this study\ndoes not allow assessment of whether care team behaviors\nand perceptions lead to practice teamwork perception or\nvice versa, the association nonetheless provides insight\ninto areas of focus for team building. That is, fostering care\nteam behaviors, encouraging care teams operating as a real\nteam, and fostering practice teamwork perceptions are\ninterrelated; processes to encourage one aspect (eg, care\nteam behaviors) may support others (eg, practice team-\nwork perceptions).\nOur finding that PCMH transformation stage was associ-\nated with practice teamwork perceptions adds to the PCMH\ndevelopment literature. A key goal of PCMHs is to develop\nteam-based care. While substantial efforts have centered on\nthe impact of PCMHs on quality, costs, and patient experi-\nence,7-12 fewer resources are dedicated to examining and\nTable 3.

In our study, intermediate PCMH transformation stage\nwas significantly associated with higher practice teamwork\nperceptions; while participants at advanced PCMH transfor-\nmation stage sites had higher practice teamwork perceptions,\nthe lack of significance for this factor may be due to the\nsmaller number (n = 52). Thus, our finding may suggest that\nthe current wave toward PCMH transformation may lead to\nhigher practice teamwork perceptions.Alternatively, because\nteam formation is an early step of PCMH transformation, it\nmay be that practices at the intermediate and advanced stages\nwere at equivalent levels of team formation.\nThe significant association between higher practice team-\nwork perceptions and higher job satisfaction needs to be\nunderscored in the context of the current primary care work-\nforce crisis. The creation of PCMH teams in health care has\nbeen associated with greater job satisfaction in some but not\nall settings.19,20 However, the elements of PCMHs that are\nassociated with increased job satisfaction have not yet been\nelucidated. This study adds to the literature by raising the\npossibility that structures enabling high practice teamwork\nperceptions may help foster increased job satisfaction. An\nalternative interpretation is that higher job satisfaction may\nbe a prerequisite for practices to then operate as real teams.\nTable 4.

This study adds to the growing litera-\nture21-23 highlighting the need for primary care redesign\nmodels and payment methods to account for enabling team\nactivities, such as huddles and team meetings, to achieve\neffective practice teamwork. While other enabling struc-\ntures such as collocation and coscheduling may also pro-\nmote team effectiveness, further evaluation of the\nrelationship between these elements and team effectiveness\nis required. In fact, rigorous measurement and monitoring\nof team effectiveness and enabling structures, as well as\nrigorous application of improvement frameworks, may be a\ncore metric of primary care transformation.\nThe current political climate, with the uncertainly about\nthe future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), raises concerns\nfor safety net hospitals. While further research is needed, this\nstudy raises the possibility that focusing on effective leader-\nship and PCMH transformation may lead to high practice\nteamwork perceptions. Because team-based care has been\nassociated with improved patient experience,7,8 improved\npopulation health,9 and reduced costs,7,10,11 focus on these\nfactors may help improve these outcomes, many of which\nsafety net hospitals strive to achieve.\nThis study should be interpreted in the context of several\nlimitations. It was conducted at 12 primary care practices of\na single institution, and therefore, findings may not be gener-\nalizable to other settings. In addition, the primary care sites\nwere not randomly assigned to PCMH development; thus,\nthe \"early sites\" likely have nonmeasured variables that the\norganization thought would increase the odds of success at\nPCMH. The associations are derived from cross-sectional\ndata, and causality cannot be inferred. Due to the complexity\nof objectively measuring team performance,24,25 as other\nstudies of team functioning have done,26,27 we examined the\nsubjective measure of practice teamwork perception. While\nour measures of care team behaviors and perceptions had\ngood internal consistency, we lack other measures of validity\nand reliability of these measures (such as test-retest).\nSimilarly, due to the anonymous nature of the survey and our\nresulting lack of information on team membership, we were\nunable to assess interrater agreement on the care team mea-\nsures. For some respondents, the substitution principle and\nhalo effects may have led to high levels of correlations\namong items. That is, if a respondent encountered a question\nthat was hard to answer quickly, they may have replaced that\nquestion with one that was easier to answer (substitution\nprinciple).28 At the same time, the strong emphasis placed by\nthe central administration on teams and team-based care\nraises the possibility of a halo effect. The halo effect suggests\nthat when we rate individuals, and likely teams and institu-\ntions, we often do this globally and generally with the halo of\nsome overall feeling about the object of the questions.29 Our\nexamination of practice teamwork perceptions and effective\nleadership were single questions, which may limit their reli-\nability and validity.\nConcluding Comments\nThis study highlights the strong association between effec-\ntive leadership, PCMH transformation, care team behaviors\nand perceptions, and job satisfaction with perceptions that\npractices operate as real teams. It may therefore suggest that\nattention to supporting and monitoring these structures may\nbe critical for team development, or that facilitating practices\noperating as real teams may lead to some of these elements.\nFor example, as primary care systems transform to team-\nbased models of care, providing resources for and focusing\non the development of effective leadership and enabling\nteam structures may augment practice teamwork perception,\na critical element of high-functioning team development.\nAppendix\nSource of Questions.\nPractice perception\n People in this practice operate as a real team Adapted from (Lewis et al14)\nCare team perception\n Please state how much you agree with the following statements about your CARE TEAM\n People on my care team operate as a real team Adapted from (Lewis et al14)\n When we experience a problem in my care team, we make a serious effort to figure out what's\nreally going on\n Candid and open communication exists between physicians and other practice staff (Lewis et al14)\n I know what the priority goals are in my team Created by authors\n Employees in my team report a strong sense of connection to their work Created by authors\nCare team behaviors\n In a given month, how often does your care team:\n Huddle before patient care sessions?
