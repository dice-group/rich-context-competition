Doppler ultrasound was used to\nmonitor cerebral blood flow, vascular resistance, and heart rate. In vitro evaluations of protein\nbinding, hepatocyte uptake and intrinsic clearance of liver microsomes at different temperatures\nwere also conducted.\nResults: Plasma concentrations of nimodipine were significantly higher in hypothermia than in\nnormothermia. Nimodipine improved cerebral blood flow under both conditions, but had a longer\neffective duration during the hypothermic period. Low temperature decreased the intrinsic\nclearance of liver microsomes, with no change in protein binding or hepatocyte uptake of\nnimodipine.\nConclusion: Nimodipine is eliminated at a slower rate during hypothermia than during\nnormothermia, mainly due to the decreased activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. This results\nin elevated system exposure with little enhancement in pharmacological effect.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/imr\n1Department of Cardiology, Navy General Hospital of\nPLA, Beijing, PR China\n2Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Academy of\nMilitary Medical Sciences, Beijing, PR China\n3Department of Pharmacy, Navy General Hospital of PLA,\nBeijing, PR China\n4Department of Ultrasound, Navy General Hospital of\nPLA, Beijing, PR China\n5Department of Neurosurgery, Navy General Hospital of\nPLA, Beijing, PR China\n6Grade 2013, Clinical Medical College, Capital Medical\nUniversity, Beijing, PR China\nCorresponding author:\nYi Zhang, Department of Pharmacy, Navy General\nHospital of PLA, 6# Fucheng Road, Haidian, Beijing, PR\nChina.\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCreative Commons CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.\nsagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Whether accidental or\nintentional, hypothermia can be induced by\na variety of chemical or physical interven-\ntions, such as sustained low temperature,\nsevere trauma, shock, anesthesia, and infu-\nsion of a large amount of fluid.1,2 Reduction\nof body temperature suppresses a broad\nrange of pathological and physiological\nprocesses, especially those involving energy\nconsumption. Negative effects include low-\nering oxygen and glucose demands, inter-\nruption of apoptotic pathways, inhibition of\npro-inflammatory cytokines, and blocking\nof neuroexcitatory cascades.3 As a result,\nhypothermia is neuroprotective and can be\nused to treat focal and global ischemic brain\ninjury.4 Indeed, intentional hypothermia,\noften referred to as ``therapeutic hypother-\nmia'', has been translated into clinical prac-\ntice to improve neurological outcomes in\nmany hypoxic\u00adischemic diseases including\ncardiac arrest, neonatal encephalopathy,\ntraumatic brain injury, convulsive status\nepilepticus, myocardial ischemia, spinal\ncord injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage.5,6\nCertain physiological processes that\nmediate drug metabolism, disposition and\nresponse also need energy, and are vul-\nnerable to theoretically unavoidable\ntemperature-induced changes in drug\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,\nwhich may increase the occurrence of\nunanticipated adverse drug effects.7 In prac-\ntice, there is a large body of preclinical and\nclinical evidence for altered drug disposition\nduring hypothermia. For example, the\nexpression and activity of a variety of meta-\nbolic enzymes and transporters such as\nglycoprotein (P-gp) may change at a low\ntemperature.8 Hypothermia can reduce the\nelimination of a number of xenobiotics and\nendogenous substances, such as ethanol,\ngeneral anesthetics (rocuronium and\natracurium), macrolide antibiotics (genta-\nmycin), antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin),\nantidepressant drugs (phenobarbitone),\nglycine and glutamate.9 Hypothermia also\nleads to changes in the pharmacodynamic\nprofile of drugs such as phenobarbitone,\npancuronium bromide and furosemide.10\nCoupled with therapeutic hypothermia,\ncritically ill patients are often subjected to a\nwide variety of medications. Many of these\ndrugs have narrow therapeutic windows and\nhave not been thoroughly studied under\nhypothermic conditions.11 As a result, the\nsuccess or failure of this promising interven-\ntion depends largely on rational drug dose\nadjustments by clinicians based on evidence\nand on an intimate knowledge of drug\ninteractions.\nNimodipine is a dihydropyridine-like cal-\ncium channel antagonist that selectively\ndilates cerebral arteries and increases cere-\nbral blood flow in animals and humans.12 Its\nmajor therapeutic indication is the preven-\ntion and treatment of delayed ischemic\nneurological disorders that often occur in\npatients with subarachnoid hemorrhages.13\nMatsumoto et al.14 have demonstrated that\nnimodipine combined with therapeutic\nhypothermia increases the beneficial effects\nin neurological outcomes. However, no\ninformation is currently available regarding\neither the possible changes of in vivo expos-\nure and response to nimodipine under\nconditions of therapeutic hypothermia, or\nthe specific mechanisms underlying these\nchanges. The objectives of the present\nstudy, therefore, were a) to investigate the\neffects of hypothermia on the pharmacokin-\netics and pharmacodynamics of nimodipine\nin rabbits; and b) to identify the mechanisms\nunderlying alterations in systemic clearance\nby in vitro evaluation of the effects of\nhypothermia on nimodipine protein bind-\ning, hepatocyte uptake and intrinsic clear-\nance (CLint) of rabbit liver microsomes.\nMaterials and methods\nDrugs and reagents\nThe following drugs/reagents were used\nin the study: nimodipine for injection\n(batch no. EXG2G31; Bayer HealthCare\nCorporation, Beijing, China), nimodipine\nNational Institute for the Control of\nPharmaceutical and Biological Products,\nBeijing, China), aconitine (Sigma\u00adAldrich,\nSt Louis, MO, USA), 1-aminobenzotriazole\n(Sigma\u00adAldrich), methanol, acetonitrile\n(chromatography grade; SK chemicals,\nSeoul, Korea); all other reagents and\nsolvents were analytical grade.\nAnimal experiments\nFive male New Zealand rabbits weighing\nfrom Vital River Ltd.

All rabbits were raised in an\natmosphere where the temperature was\nstudy was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of the Navy General Hospital\nand conducted in accordance with Chinese\nGLP standards. Rabbits were fasted for 12 h\nbefore surgery with free access to water.\nIn the first period of studies at normal\nbody temperature, rabbits were placed on\nthe operating table in the prone position.\nSkin preparation and sterilization were con-\nducted in the parietal region of the skull.\nAfter anesthesia, a vertical incision of about\n5 cm was made. The skin was retracted, and\na rounded bone window about 0.8 cm in\ndiameter was made in the parietal region of\nthe skull using a hand drill. The periosteum\nwas then carefully removed with tweezers,\nand the wound was waxed to stop bleeding.\nThe cerebral dura was kept intact, while a\nDoppler ultrasound probe (Acuson Sequoia\n512, Siemens America, Malvern, PA, USA)\nwas placed in the rounded bone window to\nrecord the cerebral blood flow image and the\nquantitative pharmacodynamic data includ-\ning the velocity of the cerebral arterial blood\nflow, vascular resistance, and heart rate. The\nrectal temperature of each rabbit was\nmonitored throughout the experiment with\na mercury thermometer.\nAfter a 2-week ``washout'' period, rabbits\nunderwent the second study period, with\nlowered body temperature. Rabbits were\ncooled physically with ice packs placed on\nthe head, neck, abdomen, and limbs to\ninduce hypothermia. The same operations\nwere conducted in this period as in the first\nperiod. Rectal temperature data for both\nperiods are listed in Table 1.\nDrug administration\nDuring each hypothermic period, a single\ndose (0.5 mg/kg) of nimodipine was injected\nintravenously into the inner ear vein 20 min\nafter rectal temperature stabilization.\nA blood sample (1 mL) was collected from\nthe contralateral ear vein before and 0.167,\nistration. The sample was placed in a hep-\narin tube, and centrifuged at 3500 \u00c2 g for\n10 min. The plasma was carefully drawn and\nNimodipine analysis\nAn LC\u00adMS/MS spectrometer (Xevo TQ MS\nsystem, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was\nused to measure the plasma concentration of\nnimodipine. Aconitine was added as an\ninternal standard and an aliquot of 0.2 mL\nplasma was subjected to extraction with 1 mL\nextraction liquid (n-hexane: ether\u00bc 1:1) for\n3 min. The supernatant was collected and\nplaced into another centrifuge tube, while the\nresidue was extracted again using the method\ndescribed above. The mixed extraction liquid\nwas then evaporated with nitrogen at 40C.\nThe residue was dissolved with 200 mL mobile\nwas injected into the LC\u00adMS/MS system\nfor quantitative analysis.\nChromatographic conditions were as\nfollows: ACQUITY BEHC18 column\nture, 35C; sample room temperature,\n35,v/v); flow rate, 0.3 mL/min. The main\nworking parameters for the mass spectrum\nwere set as follows: ion source, electrospray\nionization; capillary voltage, 3.0 kV; cone\nhole voltage, 18 V; atomization flow rate,\ntemperature, 400C. Quantification was per-\nformed using the MRM method in a positive\nion mode with transitions of m/z\nTable 1.

The buffer chamber was filled with\n7.4). The samples (n \u00bc 4 per temperature\nor 28C using a shaking water bath. The\nnimodipine concentrations in both chambers\nwere determined using the method described\nabove.

Preliminary experi-\nments showed that the nimodipine concen-\ntration decreased linearly for 5 min at each\ntemperature (data not shown). The reaction\nwas quenched by adding 200 mL acetonitrile\ncontaining internal standard.

The rate of\nnimodipine uptake in rabbit hepatocytes\nincreased linearly at concentrations below\n50mM (Figure 5) and neither the uptake rate\nat different concentrations nor the slope of\nthe curve (k) (Table 3) differed significantly\nbetween the two temperature groups.\nDiscussion\nNimodipine is mainly eliminated by the\nliver. After administration, it is widely\ndistributed throughout the body and under-\ngoes extensive hepatic metabolism. Most of\nthe metabolic steps involve phase 1 reactions\ncatalyzed by CYP enzymes, mainly\nCYP3A4.18 Orally administered nimodipine\nis subject to extensive first-pass metabolism\nfrom the portal circulation, resulting in low\nsystemic bioavailability.13 Therefore, in the\npresent study, the intravenous route was\nselected to exclude the bioavailability factor.\nFigure 2.

(a, c) Cerebral blood flow in normothermia (a) and hypothermia (c) before intravenous\nadministration of nimodipine. (b, d) Cerebral blood flow in normothermia (b) and hypothermia (d) 10 min\nafter administration of intravenous nimodipine.\nClearance is the most useful parameter\nfor evaluating the efficiency and mechanism\nof drug elimination, defined as the hypo-\nthetical volume of biological fluids irrevers-\nibly cleared of the drug per unit time. The\nsystemic clearance of a drug is the sum of the\nclearance values from all the organs, mainly\nthe kidney and liver. For nimodipine, only the\nparent compound is active and the hepatic\nclearance approximates the systemic clear-\nance,19 therefore hepatic clearance, which is\nthe focus of the present study, may play the\nmost important role in plasma exposure and\nresponse. According to the equation\nFigure 3.

The average\nhepatic blood flow (Qh) was estimated\nFigure 4. Michaelis\u00adMenten plot for the metabolism rate of nimodipine in rabbit liver microsomes at 28, 32\nand 37C.

Each value is the mean \u00c6 SD of three experiments.\nhepatocyte assay showed the uptake rate of\nnimodipine in rabbit hepatocytes was high,\nincreased linearly with concentration, and\nremained unchanged by temperature, indicat-\ning that uptake clearance was not a limited\nprocess of hepatic elimination and no active\nuptake was involved. The extrapolated CLint\ninvivo obtained from our studies was therefore\napplied to the function. The results of the\ncalculated hepatic clearance values for nimo-\nrespectively. Compared with in vivo observed\nhepatic clearance values were comparable\nduring normothermia, but overestimated\nduring hypothermia. The reason for this\noverestimation might have been due to reduc-\ntions in hepatic blood flow during hypother-\nmia being ignored in the course of calculating.\nThe results from the animal studies\nshowed that systemic clearance of nimodi-\npine during hypothermia was reduced by\n75.2% compared with normothermia.\nAccording to the function CLs \u00bc Ke \u00c2 Vd,\nchanges in systemic clearance (CLs) are\ncontributed to equally by the reduction in\nthe volume of distribution (Vd) and the\nelimination rate constant (Ke), resulting in\nhigher plasma concentration and t1/2\n. The\nlower Vd during hypothermia might have\nresulted from reduced systemic blood flow,\nincluding in the brain. However, nimodipine\nsignificantly improved cerebral blood flow\nat low temperatures, consistent with previ-\nous reports.22 We also found that the mag-\nnitude of the improvement of cerebral blood\nflow was not significant in either period with\nadministration of the same dose of nimodi-\npine, although the system exposure was\nsignificantly higher in hypothermia than\nthat in normothermia. This phenomenon\nmight have arisen from the saturation of the\ndrug effect with higher exposure or the\nreduced activity of the nimodipine receptor\nduring hypothermia.\nThe time it took TAMX and RI to return\nto baseline levels in rabbits with hypother-\nmia was significantly longer than that under\nFigure 5. Uptake rate of nimodipine in rabbit hepatocytes at 28, 32 and 37C. Values are the mean \u00c6 SD of\nnormothermia (TAMX: 4 h vs. 1 h; RI: 6 h\nvs. 2 h respectively). As the parent com-\npound alone was active, the prolonged\neffective duration of nimodipine could be\nattributed to the lower rate of elimination in\nhypothermia.\nIn summary, it is possible that hypother-\nmia can decrease hepatic CLint for nimodi-\npine, contributing to a reduction in systemic\nclearance. As a result, a routine dose of\nnimodipine results in an elevated system\nexposure with little enhancement in pharma-\ncological effect. The higher risk of adverse\nreactions with greater exposure makes it\nnecessary to optimize pharmacotherapeutic\nregimens when nimodipine is clinically used\nduring therapeutic hypothermia; this can be\nachieved by decreasing the routine dose by\n25%. Follow-up studies that focus on hep-\natic blood flow and the exposure\u00adresponse\nrelationship of nimodipine at different body\ntemperatures are needed to fully elucidate\nthe mechanism underlying the changes in\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China (grant\nReferences\n1.
