This study examined AOD use by\nnewly arrived women, identifying issues of concern to them. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted with 268 migrant\nwomen who had arrived in Perth, Western Australia, within the previous 5 years. Almost half were humanitarian entrants.\nMost women (76%) reported they did not drink alcohol. Of those who did, 10 were drinking at harmful levels and over\nhalf reported changes to their drinking patterns since arrival. One fifth of participants (20%) described distressing incidents\nrelated to alcohol or drug use by others. Migrant women are concerned by alcoholand drug-related problems, even if they\ndo not drink themselves. Domestic violence and abuse by strangers were concerns that were aggravated by alcohol and drug\nuse. As new migrants often lack strategies to prevent, or deal with alcohol-related misuse, provision of additional information\nand support is recommended.\n",

In the Perth\nmetropolitan area, almost 29% of residents migrated from\nGovernment, 2012). One non-government agency in Western\nAustralia that works with migrant and refugee women is\nWomen's Health and Family Services (WHFS). WHFS pro-\nvides medical services, counseling, information, community\ntalks and workshops, advocacy, referral, and outreach to\nwomen from over 80 different ethnic groups. WHFS also has\na women's Alcohol and other Drug (AOD) service to meet\nthe needs of women who are using AOD, as well as provid-\ning services to support their families. Although migrant and\nrefugee women access a wide range of WHFS programs, at\nthe time of this study few culturally and linguistically diverse\n(CALD) women attended the AOD service. To explore the\nreasons for this, a needs assessment was undertaken to better\nunderstand the barriers that prevented women from access-\ning AOD services and to explore the types of services and\nprograms desired by newly arrived women, the findings of\nwhich are reported elsewhere (Lee, Sulaiman-Hill, &\nThompson, 2013). This article reports on information col-\nlected as part of the larger study regarding women's own\nAOD use and issues related to the impact of AOD use by\nothers on these women. This information was used by WHFS\nto help design better services for CALD women experienc-\ning AOD issues.\nBackground\nAOD use, for both men and women, are influenced by a\nnumber of environmental factors. These can include physical\naccess, socio-demographic characteristics such as occupa-\ntion, family-related factors, peer group and cultural norms,\nmotivation, attitudes and expectations for drug use, as well\nas physical health, and the impact of life events such as trau-\nmatic experiences (Jonas, Dobson, & Brown, 2000; Marsh,\nTowers, & O'Toole, 2012). However, a number of gender\ndifferences have been reported particularly with respect to\nmental health issues associated with problematic alcohol use.\nWomen who use alcohol hazardously are more likely to\nexperience depression and anxiety compared with men,\nwhile alcohol-related suicide attempts and fatalities are also\n1Women's Health and Family Services, Perth, Western Australia, Australia\n2Combined Universities Centre for Rural Health, University of Western\nAustralia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nSusan K.

Even for women who are not\npregnant, their role as mothers and caregivers can mean that\nwomen who drink or use drugs experience more shame,\nguilt, and stigma than men. The barriers of stigma, depres-\nsion, and fear of removal of children in a woman's care, can\nresult in their reluctance to seek help; consequently women\nenter treatment programs at half the rate that men do (Dale &\nMarsh, 2000; National Centre for Education Training on\nHistorically, AOD service delivery in Western countries\nwas largely developed on the basis of research with Caucasian\nmales (Sterk, 1999; Whiteside-Mansell, Crone, & Conners,\n1999). As the original model of service delivery has often\nbeen applied with little specific research, consultation, or\nadaptation to reflect the particular needs of other popula-\ntions, services are not necessarily entirely appropriate for\nwomen and/or other ethnic populations (Sterk, 1999;\nWomen, Drug Use, and the Influence\nof Culture\nAlthough statistics (Australian Institute of Health and\nWelfare, 2012) show that migrant and refugee women are\nunder-represented among users of AOD treatment services\n(Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research & North\nRichmond Community Health Centre, 2000), this is not nec-\nessarily an indication that the use of AOD among this group\nof women should be of less concern (De Jong, Valentine, &\nAOD services by CALD women may have more to do with\nlanguage difficulties, lack of awareness of services, stigma\nattached to drug use, and cultural issues regarding discussing\nprivate issues with \"outsiders,\" than with lack of need\n(Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research & North\nRichmond Community Health Centre, 2000; Ng, Bartu, &\nSang, 1999; Working Women's Health & Women's Health in\nthe North, 2000). Research conducted with such groups\nneeds to take into consideration the heterogeneity of cultural\ngroups and the interaction of a range of personal and group\nfactors, which can impact on personal and family AOD con-\nsumption patterns (Ames & Rebhun, 1996). Although there\nhas been Australian research on migrant and refugee groups\nand their issues and concerns regarding alcohol use\n(Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research & North\nWorking Women's Health & Women's Health in the North,\n2000), this area of research remains underexplored. Similarly,\nresearch on gender differences with relation to AOD use are\nuncommon, especially in Australia, and specific studies\nreporting on issues for CALD women are rare (Working\nWomen's Health & Women's Health in the North, 2000).\nExisting studies illustrate a complex interaction of gen-\nder, culture, and attitudes toward drug use (Chen et al.,\nBauman, & Tang, 2001; Sargent, Maher, Higgs, & Crofts,\n2001). Some interactions are protective, especially for\nwomen, with strong ethno-cultural, parental, and religious\nproscriptions against the use of illegal and even legal drugs\nsuch as alcohol, in some cases. However, with accultura-\ntion, women's drug use patterns more closely approximate\nmainstream patterns of consumption (Ames & Rebhun,\n1996), but the impact of acculturation on drug use is rarely\nmeasured in AOD studies with participants from CALD\nbackgrounds as there is considerable debate as to what con-\nstitutes a valid measure of acculturation (Alegria, 2009;\nusers, their families, and the community groups to which\nthey belong may demonstrate a wide range of reactions to\nwomen's drug use. Such responses can include shame, loss\nof face, denial, stigma, embarrassment, and even a per-\nceived loss of honor (Bradby & Williams, 2006; Roarty &\nSaggers, 2009) and these may place drug users at even\ngreater risk by introducing significant cultural barriers\naround accessing services.\nMethod\nOther projects involving consumer participation with ethnic\ncommunities have found a reference group useful as a forum\nfor discussion, debate, decision making, and action\n(Karantzas-Savva & Kirwan, 2004). Therefore, as part of\nthis study, a Consumer Reference Group was established to\nguide the project and to help better understand the barriers to\nservice access (Lee, Thompson, & Amorin-Woods, 2009).\nWomen were invited to participate based upon their capabil-\nity and interest, rather than as an appointed representative of\nan association or an ethnic group, with the focus being on\ngaining consumer perspectives from a wide range of women.\nThe group consisted of women from multicultural back-\ngrounds who were interested in AOD issues as well as gen-\neral women's health concerns and they volunteered their\ntime to meet regularly with staff facilitators. The purpose of\nthe group was to assist WHFS examine the appropriateness\nof WHFS AOD services for CALD women, and plan educa-\ntion and prevention programs for migrant and refugee women\nand their families around smoking, alcohol, medication, and\nother drug issues.\nThe consumer reference group provided background\ninformation about the communities under study, as well as\nproviding a forum to facilitate discussion of issues arising\nduring the study and for validation of key research findings.\nInterviews with service providers from government and non-\ngovernmental agencies who worked extensively with newly\narrived migrant and refugee women, as well as a number of\nfocus group meetings and interviews with migrant women\nhelped to guide development of the survey protocol and\nquestionnaire format.\nLee et al. 3\nFor the quantitative survey, 268 migrant and refugee\nwomen were recruited between October and December 2006.\nWomen aged 18 years or older, who had arrived in Perth\nwithin the previous 5 years, were invited to participate. A\npurposive snowball sampling technique was adopted to\nrecruit participants, using multiple starting points to limit\nbias. The heterogeneity in snowball samples can be improved\nby choosing a broad range of snowball initiation points and\nlimiting each chain to a small number of links (Atkinson &\nso respondents were recruited through English classes, com-\nmunity organizations, workplaces, community-based clubs,\nand groups run through WHFS.\nThe survey was administered using face-to-face inter-\nviews, and women with limited English language skills were\ninterviewed using bilingual workers or through interpreters.\nSix participants chose to self-administer the survey to com-\nplete it. The questionnaire was not translated from English,\nas more than 40 different language groups were represented\namong the women interviewed and translation costs would\nhave been prohibitive. Extensive piloting of the question-\nnaire ensured that the wording used in the questionnaire was\nunderstood by a broad range of women from a variety of\ncultural and educational backgrounds, either in English or\nwith the help of an interpreter or bilingual worker.\nIn addition to a range of demographic variables, questions\nwere included which focused on smoking, alcohol consump-\ntion, alcohol-related verbal and physical abuse, access to\nmedical and social services, herbal and prescription medica-\ntion, and illegal drugs. There was a filter question regarding\nalcohol so women who drank less than one standard drink of\nalcohol in a month did not answer the alcohol-related ques-\ntions. Risk of harm from drinking was ascertained by asking\nparticipants who did drink, \"Since coming to Australia, on\naverage how often do you have an alcoholic drink of any\nkind?\" Response choices were as follows: every day, 5 to 6\ndays a week, 3 to 4 days a week, 1 to 2 days a week, less\noften, and no answer. These questions were based on those\nused in the National Drug Household Survey (The Australian\nInstitute of Health and Welfare, 2005), to allow comparison\nwith Australian population data. Consumption patterns were\nthen explored by asking \"On a day that you have an alcoholic\ndrink, how many standard drinks do you usually have?\"\nParticipants could refer to a pictorial guide as to what a stan-\ndard drink looked like to assist them in answering the ques-\ntion based on the Australian Alcohol Guidelines current at\nthe time (National Health and Medical Research Council,\nQuestions related to barriers to accessing services, the\ntype of information women would like and the types of ser-\nvices and programs they would find helpful were also\nincluded based on previous focus group feedback. Although\nthe majority of survey questions were in multiple choice or\nshort answer format, one section used index cards with pic-\ntures to depict the types of services and information that\nwomen were interested in. Women were asked to select and\nrank their topics of most importance (Bauer, 1995), a process\nthey described as \"voting\" for the various options, a tech-\nnique that proved to be an effective and enjoyable method of\ncommunicating ideas to women from a wide range of cul-\ntural and socio-economic backgrounds.\nAnalysis of quantitative survey data was performed using\nSPSS statistical software. Descriptive and frequency distri-\nbutions were calculated for each variable, with cross-tabula-\ntions (2) providing a summary of relationships between\ncategorical variables.\nThe project received ethics approval from the Human\nResearch Ethics Committee at Curtin University.\nResults\nThe age, time in Australia and visa categories of the 268\nwomen survey respondents is described in Table 1. Women\nwere born in 50 different countries and spoke 48 different\nprimary languages. Just under half (43%) were humanitarian\narrivals (refugees).\nthey had not drunk more than one standard drink of alcohol\nper month during the previous 12 months. Following further\nquestions, three women described alcohol use other than that\nreported in the original filter question based on a standard\ndrink diagram, \"In the last 12 months have you drunk more\nTable 1.

In total, 65 women\nreported drinking some alcohol.\nHarmful Drinking Patterns\nThree women were assessed as drinking at risky levels for\nshort-term harm (5-6 standard drinks on 1-2 days a week),\nand one woman was at high risk for short-term harm (7-10\nstandard drinks on 3-4 days per week) based on theAustralian\nAlcohol Guidelines current at the time (National Health and\nSeven women were drinking at levels consistent with risk\nfor long-term harm. Five women reported drinking 3 to 4\nstandard drinks 3 to 4 days a week, one woman was drinking\n3 to 4 standard drinks every day, and one woman drank 7 to\n10 standard drinks 3 to 4 days each week. Five of these\nwomen reported drinking more alcohol since coming to\nAustralia. Six requested information and support for depres-\nsion, and five wanted information and support around family\nviolence.\nChanges in Drinking Habits\nFor those who drank alcohol, changes in alcohol use were\nalso explored. Women were asked to compare their current\ndrinking habits with their drinking habits in their home coun-\ntry. Participants were asked, \"Compared to when you drank\nalcohol in your own country, since coming to Australia are\nyou drinking: about the same amount of alcohol, drinking\nless alcohol, drinking more alcohol or refused.\" Participants\nwere asked about possible reasons for any changes in their\ndrinking patterns. Of those drinking alcohol, 38.3% (n = 23)\nreported drinking about the same amount, 28.3% (n = 17)\nreported drinking less, and 31.7% (n = 19) described\nincreased alcohol consumption. Reasons for drinking more\nalcohol included alcohol being cheaper than back home,\nsocializing with Australians who drank alcohol, and as a way\nof coping with stress. Health concerns, wishing to be a good\nrole model for their children and having fewer occasions to\nsocialize since arrival were reasons given for drinking less.\nAlcohol Use by Others\nAll women were asked if,\nSince coming to Australia, has anyone who has been drinking\nalcohol or taking drugs ever: Verbally abused you (insulted you,\nyelled or sworn at you); Physically abused you (hit you, pushed\nyou); Put you in fear (made you scared); Made you feel\nuncomfortable; or Made you have sex when you didn't want to?\nHer relationship to that person was also assessed. These\nresults are described in Table 2.\nSurvey data were then compared with findings from the\nmost recent National Drug Strategy Household Survey at the\ntime (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2005).\nAlthough the phrasing of some questions was slightly differ-\nent, making direct comparison difficult, some general obser-\nvations were noted. CALD women surveyed in this project\nwere significantly less likely to report verbal abuse than\nwomen in the National Drug Survey, but were significantly\nmore likely to have felt fearful. In the study group, there was\nno significant difference between refugee and non-refugee\nnew arrivals regarding verbal abuse experienced by strang-\ners; however, migrant women were more likely to experience\nbeing put in fear by a stranger than refugee women (2 =\nlikely to have felt uncomfortable or embarrassed by someone\nwho had been drinking alcohol or taking drugs (2 = 9.99, df\n= 2, p = .007) and more likely to report having been made to\nhave sex when they didn't want to by someone who had been\nStrangers accounted for the overwhelming majority of cases\nwhere women were verbally abused, fearful, or embarrassed,\nwhile partners were more likely to be the people who physi-\ncally abused them.\nIncidents by a Stranger\nThe 46 women who had experienced one or more incidents\nby a stranger of verbal abuse, physical abuse, being put in\nfear or forced to have sex when they didn't want to, were\nfrom 19 different countries. They had a range of English lan-\nguage abilities, religious affiliations and migration visa cat-\negories. Women in their twenties and thirties were\nsignificantly more likely to have experienced these incidents\nParticipants were asked if they had been drinking and/or\ntaking drugs at the time of any of these incidents. Of the 80\nreported that they had been drinking alcohol when the inci-\ndent took place.\nIncidents by a Partner\nCurrent or ex-intimate partners also accounted for a substan-\ntial number of incidents, with 20 women reporting concerns\nLee et al. 5\nin this area. These women were aged 21 to 48 years, were\nfrom 13 different countries with varying English language\nabilities and religious beliefs. More women entering\nAustralia under spousal or fianc\u00e9 visas experienced these\nincidents (n = 9) but there was no significant difference\nbetween the different migration categories. Eight women\n(42.1%) reported drinking alcohol before the incident(s) took\nplace.\nFamily Drinking Concerns\nAs one of the larger study aims was to explore topics of con-\ncern to migrant women, all 268 survey participants were\nasked to rank their priority issues and concerns. Responses\nincluded requests for information on illegal drugs, and for\nfamilies affected by family violence and alcohol abuse.\nThese results are presented in Table 3.\nOf 40 women (14.9%) who requested support for family\nmembers drinking too much alcohol in their top five choices,\nsix ranked this as their first or second priority. Among par-\nticipants, there were indications of intimate partner vio-\nlence--verbal abuse by their current partner (mentioned by\n5), physical abuse by their partner (3), put in fear by their\npartner (5), and being forced to have sex when they didn't\nwant to (5), for whom two reported this as being by a former\npartner).\nSeven women, from a range of demographic backgrounds,\nreported concerns or arguments with family or friends about\na family member or friend's alcohol and drug use. Two of the\nwomen who wanted support for a family member were\ndrinking at levels considered risky or at high risk for long-\nterm health consequences themselves.\nDiscussion\nThe majority of women in our survey (76%) did not drink\nalcohol. Other studies of migrant alcohol use have also\nreported abstinence or low drinking levels among women\ncompared with the mainstream population and subsequent\ngenerations (Ames & Rebhun, 1996; Bradby & Williams,\nHowever, our findings do suggest that some newly arrived\nwomen may be acculturating to Australian alcohol use\npatterns much more quickly than previously anticipated as a\nresult of prevailing host society attitudes. New arrivals to\nany country come with their own traditions and values about\nalcohol. Some beliefs and customs will be similar to those of\nthe host country, while others will be quite different and\nnecessitate ongoing negotiation of the host country's drink-\ning culture (Allan, Clifford, Ball, Alston, & Meister, 2012).\nThe adoption of behavior patterns, attitudes, beliefs, and cus-\ntoms of the host population by newcomers has been theo-\nrized to take place over decades, or even generations\nhabits of the group remained the same or even decreased in\nsome cases, one third of participants reported drinking more\nand this was primarily due to social interaction with\nAustralians, availability of alcohol, and related acculturative\npressures as highlighted elsewhere (Arfken, Arnetz,\nFakhouri, Ventimiglia, & Jamil, 2011; Szaflarski, Cubbins,\n& Ying, 2011). However, unlike some countries, drinking is\nseen as a positive or even essential social practice and an\nintegral component of Australian culture (Allan et al., 2012)\nand there is considerable pressure for non-drinkers to con-\nform. Several non-drinking women in the study encountered\npressure to drink, or drink more, due to these expectations.\nThe interaction between acculturation and drinking patterns\ncould be explored in future studies. Four women in the sur-\nvey did report drinking more alcohol as a way of coping with\nstress. Although an increase in alcohol use has been linked to\nstressful conditions (Szaflarski et al., 2011) and trauma\n(Arfken et al., 2011), in many situations this may be under-\nreported or not publicly acknowledged. Although population\ndata and risk group behaviors are known in some cases, rela-\ntively little information has been reported on new arrivals\nand this is another area for future study.\nAlthough for the majority of participants, their current\ndrinking levels posed no short- or long-term risk to health, a\nsmall number of women were drinking at harmful levels.\nWhile an increase in alcohol consumption and problematic\nuse by a few does not imply a serious problem for the group\noverall, as the total alcohol consumption of a given popula-\ntion increases, the risk for a concurrent increase in problem-\natic drinking will also increase (Ames & Rebhun, 1996).\nCultural and religious beliefs may offer some protection\nagainst alcohol problems, but these factors do not provide\ntotal protection against problematic alcohol use, as risk fac-\ntors such as poverty, discrimination, targeted alcohol adver-\ntising, and alcohol availability may prove more powerful\nthan such protective beliefs (Ames & Rebhun, 1996). High\ndrinking frequency has been associated with high host cul-\nture competence and social interaction in other studies\n(Amundsen, 2012), so as new arrivals acculturate the risk of\nalcohol-related issues is likely to increase over time. All new\nCALD arrivals should therefore be provided with appropri-\nate information regarding alcohol consumption and how to\naccess information or services if needed. Forty women\n(14.9%) requested support and information for family mem-\nbers drinking too much alcohol as a priority topic. Although\nTable 3.

This also concurs with\nnaire respondents reported incidents of either verbal abuse or\nbeing put in fear by a family member drinking alcohol or\ntaking drugs since their arrival in Australia. Although inci-\ndents of physical abuse (4.3%) and sexual assault (5.2%)\nwere less common, members of the project's Consumer\nReference Group felt that there may have been a tendency to\nunderreport such incidents, based on their own experiences\nand anecdotal reports within their communities. While the\nquestionnaire gave examples of verbal abuse (being insulted,\nyelled, or sworn at) and physical abuse (being hit or pushed),\ncultural and individual differences in what is regarded as\nabuse could potentially account for some discrepancies\n(Allimant & Ostapiej-Piatkowski, 2011). The impact of\nsocial desirability bias certainly needs to be considered when\ndiscussing sensitive issues such as domestic violence.\nAlthough the majority of surveys were completed by inter-\nview, six respondents asked to self-complete the survey\nform. During this process, several of these women disclosed\ninformation about family violence and alcohol abuse by a\npartner, details that may have been less forthcoming if dis-\ncussed during interview.\nIssues related to AOD use by others impacting on the\nsafety of ethnic women in public places are not often reported\nin the literature, although twoAustralian projects with CALD\nwomen in Victoria (Working Women's Health & Women's\nHealth in the North, 2000) and the Vietnamese community in\nPerth (Ng et al., 1999) have reported findings consistent with\nthe present study. Just under half of our study participants\nreported one or more abusive incidents by a stranger, often\nciting traumatic events that may well have been reported to\nthe police by other people had they experienced the same\nabuse. Refugee women did not experience more abuse, sex-\nual assault, or fear than other migrants, or in comparison\nwith women in the National Drug survey (Australian Institute\nof Health and Welfare, 2005), although refugees have been\nidentified as a vulnerable subgroup for alcohol misuse\n(Arfken et al., 2011). Given their often traumatic histories\nand because they may lack strategies to deal with such inci-\ndents in the early period after settlement, they are potentially\nat higher risk for re-traumatization, posttraumatic stress dis-\norder (PTSD), and other mental health problems (Sowey,\nsible that insults and abuse may sometimes go unheeded due\nto language barriers, it is also likely that the problem may be\nunderreported due to a lack of trust in authorities or unfamil-\niarity of the system in Australia. Women described incidents\nthat impacted on their confidence and feelings of safety and\nthey appeared to lack strategies to deal with these either at\nthe time or afterward. Sometimes this is due to uncertainty\nregarding what they should do or where to seek assistance,\nrevealing a need to discuss prevention strategies and provide\nall new arrivals with the tools and knowledge to deal with\nsuch incidents.\nLimitations\nThe sample size of this study is relatively small (268 migrant\nand refugee women) in comparison with population surveys\nbut these often fail to adequately identify and provide facili-\nties for collecting and reporting data for CALD women who\nmay have challenges with the English language.\nNotwithstanding, the study provides evidence that alcohol-\nrelated problems among newly arrived women may be of\ngreater concern than the literature suggests. More research in\nthis area is needed.\nAlthough it was assumed that limiting the research to\nwomen who had been in Australia 5 years or less would\nreduce the effects of acculturation, an acculturation scale\ncould have clarified whether reported changes in behavior\nwere due to women acculturating faster than previously\nassumed, or to other factors.\nAnother limitation of the study was that the question-\nnaires were not translated but instead administered by bilin-\ngual/bicultural workers or by the principle researcher with\nthe assistance of an interpreter. It is possible that measure-\nment errors may have occurred during the data collection and\nmay have affected the findings, although supervision and\ndebriefing of interviewers occurred frequently during data\ncollection. While in a perfect research environment validated\ntranslations would have been used, this was impractical for\nlogistical and financial reasons. Moreover, at the time of the\nresearch there was a lack of accredited translators and inter-\npreters for some of the languages spoken by participants. The\nprocesses, advantages, and disadvantages of using bilingual\nworkers, interpreters, and translated instruments in this study\nwill be explored in detail elsewhere (article currently under\nreview).\nSome notable differences were also observed between\nself-reported and interviewer data, revealing the impact of\nsocial desirability factors. It is likely that some sensitive\nmaterial around family violence and physical abuse may\nhave been withheld from interviewers due to embarrassment\nor shame. Measurement limitations such as recall bias of pre-\nmigration drinking patterns combined with the transitional\nnature of the migration process also need to be considered. In\naddition, although participants had the opportunity to have\nthe questionnaire administered using an interpreter or bilin-\ngual worker, the questionnaire format was in English. It is\nLee et al. 7\npossible that inconsistencies in interpretation, especially for\nwomen with little or no understanding of English, could have\nimpacted on some results. Using a validated, translated\ninstrument could have overcome some of these issues.\nAt the time of the study, WHFS was only funded for\nwomen clients, so the focus of the research was AOD issues\nspecifically relating to women. The questionnaire did not\nexpressly investigate the drinking habits of partners or chil-\ndren of the women respondents, or how these had changed\nsince coming to Australia and this would be an important\nfocus for future research.\nConclusion\nAlthough cultural and religious imperatives underpin the\ndrinking habits of many migrant women resulting in low lev-\nels of alcohol use or abstinence, this study has highlighted\nthe vicarious impact of alcohol use by others on newly\narrived women in Australia, an issue not well documented in\nthe literature. Concerns related to alcohol and drug use by\nothers include domestic violence and verbal and physical\nabuse by strangers, which impact on CALD women's feel-\nings of safety in public places. Many migrant women lack\nstrategies to prevent or deal with the consequences of family\nor stranger alcohol misuse, so health and settlement service\nproviders are encouraged to provide new arrivals with appro-\npriate information and support.\nAuthors' Note\nThe project was a joint endeavor between Women's Health and\nFamily Services and Curtin University.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: Susan Lee received\nsupport of an Australian Postgraduate Award administered through\nCurtin University, the Office Multicultural of Interests to assist with\ncosts associated with focus groups, interviews and the survey; the\nWest Australian Network of Alcohol and Other Drug Agencies to\npay for interpreters used during the project; and Women's Health\nand Family Services for time to undertake and report on this\nresearch.
