This study was approved\nby the institutional review boards of all\nparticipating institutions.\nAnthropometricdataatage15yearswere\nhad at least 1 life event measure, and 848\nhad complete data for gender, race/\nethnicity, maternal education, and ma-\nternalweightstatus.The848participants\n(82% non-Hispanic white) included in the\nanalyses, compared with the excluded,\nincomplete sample, were less likely to be\nwas no difference in race/ethnicity.\nMain Predictor: Life Events\nMothers completed an adapted version\noftheLifeExperiencesSurvey16 whenthe\nreported whether each of 71 events had\noccurred in the last year, and if it oc-\ncurred, rated the impact on a 7-point\nLikert scale, from \u00ad3 (extremely nega-\ntive) to 0 (no impact) to 3 (extremely\npositive). Number of negative life events\nwas defined as the sum of all events\nendorsed thatwere also ratedas having\na negative impact (\u00ad1 to \u00ad3). The num-\nber of negative life events at each age\nwas then averaged across ages.

Total num-\nber of life events, regardless of whether\nthe impact rating was positive, negative,\nor neutral, was summed at each age and\nthen averaged across ages, with the top\nquartile defined as \"many life events.\"\nWe created 4 categories of negative life\nevents according to author consensus:\nparent or family physical or mental\nhealth and well-being (ie, family health;\n\"serious illness or injury of close family\nmember,\" \"took prescription drugs for\nat least 1 month to help with mental\nproblems\"]; parental work, school, or\nfinancial stability (ie, family finances;\n15 items [eg, \"foreclosure on mortgage\nor loan,\" \"fired or laid off from job,\"\n\"return to work\"); emotional aspects of\nrelationships (ie, family relationships;\n14 items [eg, \"trouble with in-laws,\"\n\"argument or conflict with husband/\npartner,\" \"divorce\"); and family struc-\nture, routine, and caregiving (10 items;\neg, \"birth or adoption of a child,\" \"child\nARTICLE\nstarted school,\" \"change in child cus-\ntody arrangements,\" \"need to care for\naging family member\"). The number of\nevents in each category was averaged\nacross ages, and the top quartile for\neach category was defined as \"many.\"\nOutcome: Overweight at Age 15\nYears\nHeight and weight were measured by\nusing a standardized protocol at age 15\nyears. Overweight was defined as a BMI\n$85th percentile for age and gender\nbased on the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention growth charts.17\nCovariates\nChildgender,race/ethnicity(non-Hispanic\nwhite versus not), and maternal edu-\ncation (continuous [in years]) were in-\ncluded as covariates. The data set\nincludes only maternal BMI by self-\nreport when the child is age 15 years.\nMothers' images on videotape at child\nassigned a weight status ranging from\n1 (thinnest) to 9 (heaviest) by using a\nstandard pictorial rating scale,18 an\napproach with demonstrated validity,19\nand ratings were then averaged. The\nmean maternal weight status rating\ncorrelated with maternal BMI when the\nDelay of gratification at age 4 years was\nassessed by using the Mischel and\nEbbesen self-imposed waiting task.20\nThe child was told that the examiner\nwas going to leave the room, and if the\nchild could wait until the examiner\nreturned, he or she would be allowed to\neat a large quantity of a preferred food\n(candy, animal crackers, or pretzels). If\nthe child could not wait, he or she would\nbe allowed to eat only a small quantity.\nChildren who waited were considered\nto have delayed gratification.\nParenting sensitivity was defined as the\nmean sensitivity z score coded from video-\ntaped structured mother\u00adchild play inter-\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted by\nusing SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc,\nCary,NC).For the9.7%ofthesamplethat\nwas missing the number of negative life\nevents(totalorineachcategory),impact\nrating score, or total number of life\nevents at 1 or 2 of the 3 age points, these\nvalues were imputed. Descriptive sta-\ntistics were used to characterize the\nsample, and x2 and t tests were used to\nevaluate the association of each covar-\niate with overweight at age 15 years. We\nused multiple logistic regression anal-\nysis to evaluate the association of mean\nnegative life events in childhood with\nbeing overweight at age 15 years, con-\ntrolling for child race/ethnicity, child\ngender, maternal education, and ma-\nternal weight status. We next reran this\nmodel using as the predictor our cre-\nated categorical variable \"many nega-\ntive life events.\" Four new models were\nthen retested, rerunning this fully ad-\njusted model and replacing the many\nnegative life events variable individually\nwith each of the following variables: (1)\nchronicity of negative life events; (2)\ntiming of negative life events; (3) impact\nof negative life events; and (4) many life\nevents (of positive, negative, or neutral\nvalence). To test the independent effect\nof each type of negative life event, we\nincluded the 4 different types of nega-\ntive life events (family health, family\nfinances, family relationships, and fam-\nily structure, routine, and caregiving),\neach coded categorically as \"many\" ver-\nsus \"not\" simultaneously in the model.\nFour additional models were tested, in-\ndividually including interactions of the\ncategorical many negative life events\nvariable with child gender, maternal\neducation, maternal weight status, the\nchild's ability to delay gratification, and\nparenting sensitivity. Adjusted odds ra-\ntios (ORs) and their corresponding 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs) were calcu-\nlated from all models.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 displays characteristics of the\nsample and bivariate associations with\noverweight.

Our finding that the association\ndid not differ based on the timing of\nexposure to negative life events is\nvious studies, suggesting that there\ndoes not seem to be a developmental\nwindow in childhood during which the\nassociation of negative life events or\nstressors with overweight is more ro-\nbust. Our finding that the maternal-\nreported impact of negative life events\nwas not associated with overweight\nrisk may be consistent with a previous\nstudy demonstrating that the objective\nreport of stressors in the home was\npredictive of child obesity, whereas the\nparent's self-reported perceived stress\nwas not.8 These results suggest that\nnegative life events may have an impact\non overweight risk even if they are not\nperceived as intensely stressful by the\nparent. This finding may occur either\nbecause the parent does not recognize\nthe effect of the life events on the child\nor because the life events affect the\nchild's stress physiology but not the\nobservable behavior.23 To our knowl-\nedge, our findings that the valence of\nevents is important, and that some\ntypes of negative life events are more\nrobustly associated with adolescent\noverweight, have not previously been\nreported.\nWedidnotdetectmoderationaccording\ntogender,unlike2previousstudiesthat\nexamined moderation and found more\nrobust associations in girls.4,5 Given\nthat eating in response to stress is re-\npotential gender differences deserve\nadditional consideration.

They may also share the\nsame neurobiology with their child that\npromotes excessive eating in response\nto stressors (eg, hypothalamic-pituitary-\nadrenal axis functioning,14 differences\nin neural circuitry related to food re-\nward,26 genetic variants associated\nwith eating behaviors [including both\nemotional eating and cognitive re-\nThe finding that the association was\nmorerobustamongchildrenwhowaited\nforalargerquantityoffoodwascontrary\nto our expectations, as well as contrary\nto a recent study which found that the\nabilitytodelaygratificationmediatedthe\nassociation of psychosocial risk with\nchild BMI.28 We hypothesize that the\nchild's delay of gratificationforfoodmay\nreflect not just a general capacity for\nself-regulation but also how much the\nchild desires the food or finds the food\nto be a motivator. Several studies have\nfound that the reduced ability to delay\ngratification for food,29\u00ad31 as well as for\nnonfood items (toys),29 is associated\nwith more rapid rates of weight gain\nand future obesity risk. This classic be-\nhavioral task using food may be tapping\ninto more than just self-regulatory ca-\npacity but also interindividual differ-\nences in children's motivation to attain\na larger quantity of a palatable food or\nsensitivity to reward.32 The effect of\nnegative life events on the development\nof overweight may occur through in-\ncreased appetitive drive, as opposed to\nreduced self-regulatory capacity. In\naddition, not all children who experi-\nence significant stress respond with\ngreater impulsivity; rather, some use\nmore positive coping strategies.33\nUnderstanding these pathways should\nbe a focus of future work.\nThere are several mechanisms through\nwhich negative life events may be as-\nsociated with future overweight. Neg-\native life events may lead to increased\ncomfort foods, which contribute to re-\nlieving stress at a neurobiological\nlevel.14 Negative life events may also\nlead to poor sleep or disruption of\nhousehold routines, which have been\nNegative life events may also contrib-\nute to child behavioral or mental health\nproblems, which have each been linked\nto childhood obesity.41,42 Previous work\nhas also shown that under conditions\nof stress, the brain triggers changes in\nmetabolism that can lead to excessive\nStrengths of our study include its rela-\ntively large, prospective, and socioeco-\nnomically and geographically diverse\nsample.

Our study, like\ners to describe events or stressors in\nthe home but did not ask children di-\nrectly about their experience of these\nevents or stressors.\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly school-aged children experienc-\ning many negative life events are at\nhigher risk of being overweight by age\n15 years. At present, clinicians might\nconsider attending to the possibility of\nincreases in overweight risk among\nchildren experiencing a substantial\nnumber of negative life events con-\ncurrently at any point in childhood, as\nwell as children living in households in\nwhich adults or family members are\nexperiencing life events related to their\nown physical ormental health and well-\nbeing. As the mechanism becomes\nbetter understood, interventions could\nbe developed to better target the\nmechanism of association to prevent\nobesity. Investment in parenting and\nearly childhood education programs,\nwhichcanmitigateearlylifeadversity,44\nmay be a valuable focus for policies\ntargeting childhood obesity.\nREFERENCES\n1. McEwen BS.
