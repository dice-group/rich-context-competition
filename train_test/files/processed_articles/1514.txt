In boys, ASB was defined by three\nclasses (Exclusive Covert, Mixed Covert and Overt, and No\nProblems) whereas in girls, ASB was defined by two\nclasses (Exclusive Covert, No Problems). In boys, 5-\nHTTLPR and maltreatment were not significantly related\nto ASB. However, in girls, maltreatment, but not 5-\nHTTLPR, was significantly associated with ASB. A\nsignificant interaction between 5-HTTLPR and maltreat-\nment was also observed, where maltreated girls homozy-\ngous for the short allele were 12 times more likely to be\nclassified in the Exclusive Covert group than in the No\nProblems group. Structural differences in the latent struc-\nture of ASB at Wave 2 and Wave 3 prevented repeat LCA\nmodeling. However, using counts of ASB, 5-HTTLPR,\nmaltreatment, and its interaction were unrelated to overt\nand covert ASB at Wave 2 and only maltreatment was\nrelated to covert ASB at Wave 3.

Gene-environment interaction\nAntisocial behavior (ASB) is defined by acts that violate\nestablished norms/rules (e.g., truancy, curfew), aggression\nresulting in interpersonal harm (e.g., violence, assault), or\nproperty damage (e.g., fire setting) (Dishion and Patterson\n2006). ASB is one of the most common referrals for youth\nmental health services in the United States (Kazdin et al.\n2006). Disruptive behavior disorders, including oppositional\ndefiant disorder (ODD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), were the most prevalent disorders in an\nepidemiological sample of 4 year-old children (Lavigne et al.\n2009). Externalizing behavior is clinically significant be-\ncause it strongly predicts academic failure and adult\npsychopathology (e.g., antisocial personality disorder) and\nit is highly persistent over time (Farrington 1995). In fact,\nstability estimates for aggression and ASB are comparable to\nIQ, which has long been considered as one of the most stable\nindividual attributes (Olweus 1979). ASB is also responsible\nfor significant economic consequences. In the United States,\nthe cost of health care, academic support, and juvenile justice\nwas approximately $70,000 more for youths with conduct\ndisorder (CD) than youth without CD over a seven year\nperiod (Foster and Jones 2005). Thus, ASB is an important\nconstellation of problems with clinical and public health\nsignificance.\nExisting models have differentiated dimensions of ASB\nbased on separable risk factors, underlying mechanisms,\nand divergent patterns of association, including overt (e.g.,\nfighting, bullying) and covert (e.g., lying, stealing) ASB\nof 391 preschool children, overt ASB was more strongly\nassociated with hyperactivity, conduct problems, and\nThis work was supported by the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric\nJ.

In two separate samples of boys and girls with and\nwithout ADHD, a laboratory measure of childhood covert\nASB prospectively predicted adolescent delinquency sever-\nity 4\u00ad5 years later, controlling for initial ADHD, overt\naggression, and noncompliance (Lee and Hinshaw 2004,\n2006). A recent meta-analysis also suggests that genetic\ninfluences are substantially stronger for overt ASB than for\nASB also shows divergent patterns of association based\non its age of onset. Moffitt (1993) proposed two distinct\ntypes of antisocial youth: life-course-persistent (LCP) and\nadolescent-limited (AL). The LCP pathway is significantly\nheritable, frequently comorbid with ADHD, and correlated\nwith physical aggression, neuropsychological deficits, and\nparent psychopathology (Aguilar et al. 2000; Moffitt and\nCaspi 2001). There is also evidence that LCP children have\nhigher levels of callous and unemotional traits (e.g., low\nguilt, lack of empathy, less sensitive to punishment), which\nis also predictive of aggression and delinquency (Frick et\nal. 2003). In contrast, the AL pathway is associated with a\npost-pubertal onset of ASB, desistance by late adolescence,\nrelatively few child and family risk factors, and a\npredominance of non-aggressive offending (e.g., status\noffenses). This pathway is driven predominantly by social\nprocesses (e.g., deviant peer influences) and personality\nfactors (e.g., sensation seeking) (Moffitt 1993). Evidence of\na third subtype of ASB has also emerged (Moffitt et al.\n2008). Compared to LCP and AL youth, Odgers et al.\n(2008) found that the childhood-limited group had more\nchild conduct problems, but that these behaviors declined\nby mid-adolescence. The prognosis for this group is poorly\nunderstood, however (Odgers et al. 2007).\nSex Differences in ASB\nAlthough some theories of ASB converge with patterns of\nASB observed in girls (Keenan et al. 1999), most studies\nhave focused on boys (Lahey et al. 1999), despite important\nsex differences (Loeber and Stouthamer-Loeber 1998;\nSilverthorn and Frick 1999). For example, girls are less\nphysically aggressive than boys (Silverthorn and Frick\n1999) and CD is two- to four-times more common in boys\nthan in girls (Cohen et al. 1993). However, sex differences\nin ASB narrow significantly by early adolescence with\ngirls, whose ASB begins in adolescence, showing worse\noutcomes than boys with a similar onset (Fergusson et al.\n2005). This convergence is largely explained by girls\nengaging in non-aggressive ASB, including relational\nASB (i.e., spreading rumors, gossip, ostracizing peers) that\nare comparable to boys. For example, in the Dunedin birth\ncohort, rates of non-aggressive ASB were equivalent in\nboys and girls at age 15, but boys were 3\u00ad4 times more\nphysically aggressive than girls (Moffitt et al. 2001). In\nboys were equal in physical aggression at age 5, but by age\n11, female aggression decreased whereas aggression in\nboys remained stable (Lee et al. 2007). Hipwell et al.\n(2002) found that older girls showed higher rates of\noppositional/defiant behaviors and relational aggression\nthan younger girls in a community sample of 2,451 girls\n(aged 5 to 8), suggesting that non-aggressive ASB increases\nwith age in girls. Overall, the literature suggests that age of\nonset and the type of ASB are central to understanding\nASB across development.\nLatent Class Analysis\nEmpirically-derived approaches that identify subgroups of\nantisocial youth are heuristic for several reasons, including\nthe value of person-centered strategies (Bergman and\nMagnusson 1997). Taxonomies traditionally assume homo-\ngeneity within a group, although thresholds may be\narbitrary or inaccurate (Schwartz et al. 2001). For example,\nchildren who fall just short of diagnostic criteria for CD and\nODD are equally impaired as children who meet full\ncriteria (Levin 2008). Similarly, frequent comorbidity\nchallenges the assumption of homogeneity within a single\ndisorder, as evidenced by the fact that adolescents with CD\nfrequently have comorbid ADHD, anxiety, and substance\ndisorders (Loeber and Keenan 1994). Compared to single-\ndisorder and non-disordered cases, individuals with comor-\nbidity have worse health outcomes, are more treatment\nresistant, and more functionally impaired (Newman et al.\n1998). Thus, single-disorder contrasts (e.g., CD vs. con-\ntrols) may exaggerate effect sizes because of high comor-\nbidity and they may arbitrarily define groups based on\ntheory and clinical observation. However, empirically-\ndriven approaches have identified groups based on ASB\nseverity and clinical presentation that are not reflected in\ncurrent diagnostic approaches (Lee et al. 2007; De Nijs et\nTo complement traditional group-based approaches,\nlatent class analysis (LCA) creates a taxonomy based on\nsimilar patterns of responses (McCutcheon 1987). Individ-\nuals within the same latent class are homogenous and\ndistinct from other classes, provided the indicator variables\nare locally independent (Magidson and Vermunt 2004).\nLCA is a relatively anonymous approach where the number\nof classes is determined through an iterative process where\nthe best fitting model determines the number of indepen-\ndent classes (Magidson and Vermunt 2004). LCA is a more\n\"person-centered\" approach, where groups of individuals\nare prioritized rather than traditional approaches that\nprioritize variable-centered models (e.g., regression). In\naddition, LCA allows modeling predictors of class mem-\nbership and the use of covariates (Walrath et al. 2004).\nDespite these benefits, there are few published LCA studies\nof ASB. De Nijs et al. (2007) conducted LCA of the\nAttention Problems, Aggression, and Rule-Breaking\nBehaviors scales of the Child Behavior Checklist on\nuniversity clinics and mental health agencies. Six distinct\nclasses emerged with support for ADHD subtypes, but not\nfor separate aggressive or rule-breaking subtypes. The\nfailure to identify distinct aggressive and rule-breaking\ndimensions may have been due to referral bias (e.g., clinic-\nreferred youth have an earlier age of onset of problems,\nmore severe psychopathology and impairment) that ulti-\nmately obscured these two classes (Goodman et al. 1997).\nAfrican-American children and found that boys were best\ncharacterized by 4 unique classes (Academic Problems,\nBehavior Problems, Academic and Behavior Problems,\nand No Problems). Girls were similarly characterized,\nonly without the Behavior Problems group. Girls and\nboys in the combined group of academic and behavior\nproblems had significantly higher rates of social impair-\nment, suggesting that the groups derived demonstrated\nexpected patterns of association with other domains.\nHowever, none of these studies tested specific predictors\nof group membership.\nSerotonin Transporter Gene (5-HTTLPR)\nGenes that regulate serotonin (5-HT) are implicated in\naggression across diverse experimental methods and\nmodel systems. Although 5-HT functioning has been\nextensively studied, the precise relationship between 5-\nHT levels and aggression remains unclear (Carrillo et al.\n2009). Some studies of 5-HT transporter knockout mice\nsuggest that lower levels of 5-HT in limbic and hypotha-\nlamic regions increase aggression (Gibbons et al. 1997;\nHolmes et al. 2002). Low cerebrospinal spinal fluid of\n5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which metabolizes\n5-HT, has also been associated with aggression in non-\nhuman primates (Higley et al. 1996), children with ODD\nand CD (Van Goozen et al. 1999), and adults with a\nhistory of violence (Brown et al. 1979). Conversely, other\nstudies have found that increased 5-HT transmission\nincreases aggression and violent suicidal ideation among\ndepressed, anxious, bipolar, and psychotic patients (Car-\nrillo et al. 2009). Whereas most studies reported an\ninhibitory effect of 5-HT on aggression (Carrillo et al.\n2009), this effect is influenced by the type of aggression\nassayed as well as other neural and psychosocial factors.\nFor example, in animal models, 5-HT neurotransmission\nincreased aggression if it was induced by social isolation\nor stress (i.e., reactive-retaliatory aggression), but it\ninhibited aggression if the animal was predatory (i.e.,\nproactive-instrumental aggression) (Carrillo et al. 2009).\nOther neural mechanisms may also be crucial in the\ncontext of 5-HT and aggression; for instance, immediately\nfollowing an attack, mice responded with an increase\nin prefrontal dopaminergic neurotransmission and a\ncorresponding decrease in 5-HT functioning (Van Erp\nThe serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) is of\nparticular interest to ASB because it transcribes proteins\nwhich regulate the availability of 5-HT in the brain. In\nhumans, 5-HTTLPR is located on chromosome 17q12 and\nconsists of a 44 base pair (bp) polymorphism, resulting in\nshort (S) and long (L) alleles (Lesch et al. 1996). 5-\nHTTLPR is particularly important to the amygdala, a\nstructure critical to emotion regulation and fear processes\n(LeDoux 2000), with a recent meta-analysis estimating that\n5-HTTLPR accounted for as much as 10% of the variance\nin amygdala activation (Munaf\u00f2 et al. 2008). Neuroimaging\nstudies have consistently reported that the S allele is\nassociated with hyper-reactivity of the amygdala, which is\nassociated with decreased 5-HT transporter functionality\n(Hariri et al. 2002). Individuals with CD, aggressive traits,\nand histories of violence are more likely to carry the S\nfindings have also been reported (Patkar et al. 2002; Sakai\net al. 2006). These discrepancies may be due to phenotypic\ndifferences in these studies that included sample specific\ncriterion (Sakai et al. 2006), parent and teacher rating scales\n(Haberstick et al. 2006), and DSM-IV criteria (Liao et al.\n2004). Moreover, few studies of 5-HTTLPR have differen-\ntiated aggressive and non-aggressive subtypes of ASB. A\nrecent study of 872 male twins found that specific forms of\novert and deceptive (e.g., steals, lies, cheats) ASB shared\nsimilar risk genes, and that unmeasured environmental\nfactors differentiated their expression (Barker et al. 2009).\nFor example, in addition to genetic factors, negative affect\nand hostile perception of others were related to aggressive,\nbut not rule breaking, ASB (Burt et al. 2009). A recent\nmeta-analysis of 34 studies found that overt and covert\naggression show significant heritability differences (as\nevidenced by non-overlapping ranges on the 95% confi-\ndence interval) (Burt 2009). This finding is particularly\nrelevant given that most individual studies of heritability of\novert and covert ASB were likely under-powered. In light\nof the different conclusions suggested by the Burt (2009)\nmeta-analysis and the recent large study of twins by Barker\net al. (2009), it appears that the precise nature of genetic\nand environmental influences on different forms of ASB is\nunknown.\nGene-Environment Interaction\nEnvironmental influences on ASB are evident by virtue of\nthe imperfect concordance between monozygotic twins and\nbecause environmental conditions influence gene expres-\nsion (Moffitt 2005). There is replicated evidence that\nchildhood maltreatment is a robust risk factor for conduct\nproblems, ASB, and violence (see review by Glaser 2000).\nNot only is maltreatment associated with disruptions of the\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, hippocampus,\namygdala, cerebellum and left neocortex (Teicher et al.\n2003), animal models suggest that early adversity may\ninfluence transcription (Champagne and Curley 2005),\nmaking it a strong candidate for gene-environment interac-\nexamined 184 adult males and found a significant associ-\nation between 5-HTTLPR genotype and violence, but only\namong adults that experienced childhood adversity. Similar\nresults have been reported in other serotonin-related\nsystems, including the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)\nGiven concerns over statistical power in genetic associ-\nation studies (i.e., small sample size, small genetic effects,\nincorrectly assigning a case to a control group, or vice\nversa) (Hirschhorn et al. 2002), the use of traditional\nmethods to model the probability of group membership\nmay unduly reflect scaling artifacts or extreme samples\n(Uher and McGuffin 2008). Thus, LCA is superior to\ntraditional categorical methods because LCA classes are\nunidimensional and they afford greater statistical power,\nalthough sample size remains important to LCA (Rindskopf\n2009). We are currently unaware of any study that\nincorporates molecular genetic assays with latent class\nanalysis of ASB. Todd et al. (2005) analyzed a pooled\nsample of three ADHD studies; two community-based\ntwin samples and a third clinic- and advertisement-based\nnon-twin sibling sample. Using LCA, there was evidence\nfor eight distinct groups based on hyperactive\u00adimpulsive,\ntalkative, inattentive and combined symptoms. Significant\nassociations between the 9-repeat allele of the dopamine\ntransporter gene (DAT1) and the 7-repeat allele of the\ndopamine receptor gene (DRD4) for the severe combined\nsubtype of ADHD were found, suggesting that LCA-\nderived phenotypes were sensitive to genetic effects.\nCrucially, these genetic effects were not evident when\ntraditional phenotypic definitions were used (e.g., diag-\nnostic groups). Using a large sample of adolescents and\nyoung adults who self-reported ASB, we had the follow-\ning aims: (1) To characterize the latent structure of\nantisocial youth, separately for boys and girls, using latent\nclass analysis (LCA) and (2) To test the association of 5-\nHTTLPR genotype and maltreatment on latent class\nmembership.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth Harris et al. 2008) ascertained a stratified random\nsample of youth from U.S. high schools. Details of the study\ndesign can be obtained at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/\nyear; 47.5% male). Genetic data were obtained five years later\nfrom full siblings and twins only. We analyzed the genetic\nsubsample in Wave 1, which consisted of 2,488 adolescents\nwith genetic data were slightly younger (15.7 years vs.\nadolescents without genetic data, they did not differ signifi-\nthe genetic subsample was ethnically diverse (57.5% Cauca-\n1.7% Native American, and 0.9% \"Other\"), we emphasize\nthat it is not a nationally representative sample.\nMeasures\nASB was ascertained during an in-home interview con-\nducted at Wave 1. Respondents reported the frequency or\npresence of seven ASB items, including assault with a\nweapon, vandalism, selling marijuana, breaking and enter-\ning, and theft. Because the scaling of items was inconsistent\n(e.g., frequency counts, categorical), all items were con-\nverted to dichotomous data.\nMaltreatment was assessed retrospectively during an in-\nhome interview at Wave 3 when subjects were 18\u00ad26 years\nold. Subjects reported the frequency of each of the following\nevents prior to age 12: (1) parents or adult-caregivers not\ntaking care of the respondent's basic needs (e.g., hygiene,\nfood/clothing), (2) been slapped, hit or kicked by parents or\nadult care-givers, and (3) been touched in a sexual way,\nforced to touch someone else in a sexual way, or forced to\nhave sexual relations with a parent or adult caregiver.\nFollowing expert recommendations (Haberstick et al.\n2005), if an event occurred at least once, it was scored as\npositive. 64.8% of youth reported no maltreatment history\nand 35.2% reported at least one episode. Individuals with\ngenotype data did not differ in maltreatment from individuals\nGenotyping\nGenomic DNA was isolated from buccal cells using\nstandard methods. The primer sequences were: forward,\n5-GGCGTTGCCGCTCTGAATGC-3 (fluorescently la-\nbeled), and reverse, 5- 46 GAGGGACTGAGCTGGA\nCAACCAC-3. These primer sequences yield products of\nhas approximately three times the basal activity of the\nshorter promoter (484 bp) with the deletion (Lesch et al.\n1996). We followed previous strategies (Cicchetti et al.\n2007) by comparing three genotypes with the following\nStatistical Analyses\nLCA was conducted in Mplus 4.0 (Muthen and Muthen\n2006) using the mixture analysis command. To construct\nthe best fitting LCA model, we started with a single class\nsolution and fit successive models with an additional class\nuntil the best fitting model was indicated. We report the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value given that it is\nmore robust than other statistical indices (Nylund et al.\n2007), as well as the adjusted BIC. To identify the best\nmodel fit, we selected the model with the smallest BIC\nvalue (Collins et al. 1993). We then added covariates (age,\nrace-ethnicity, family income) and predictors (5-HTTLPR,\nmaltreatment, and their interaction). Models were con-\nstructed separately for boys and girls based on the\nsignificant difference between sex and latent class mem-\n1, p<0.01). In addition, because the architecture of ASB in\ngirls is not well known (Eley et al. 1999), we used log-\nlinear regression in SAS PROC GENMOD (specifying\nPoisson distributions) to analyze separate counts of overt\nand covert ASB to supplement LCA. Finally, to capitalize on\nthe repeated measures design and to identify the latent\nstructure of ASB at different points in development, we\nutilized the identical data analytic strategies described above\nat Wave 1 (LCA and log-linear regression of overt and\ncovert ASB separately in boys and girls) again for Wave 2\n(1 year follow-up) and Wave 3 (6\u00ad7 year follow-up).\nResults\nPopulation Stratification\nWe tested the association of genotype and race-ethnicity\nbecause allele frequencies for 5-HTTLPR are known to\nvary by race-ethnicity (Gelernter et al. 1999). 5-HTTLPR\ngenotypes were non-randomly distributed by race-ethnicity\nwere not significantly associated with LCA class member-\npossibility of population stratification (Hutchison et al.\n2004). However, because race-ethnicity is associated with\nASB (Petras et al. 2004), we included this as a covariate in\nall models.\nLatent Class Models for Girls and Boys\nLCA fit indices for latent class solutions of girls and boys\nare summarized in Table 1. For girls, a 2-class solution was\nBIC and adjusted BIC increased, suggesting a worse model\nfit. For boys, the 3-class solution was the best fit to the data\nincrease in BIC suggested that the stability of the classes\ndecreased relative to the original 3-class model.\nFigure 1 shows the prevalence of group membership and\nprobabilities for girls. Class 1, which accounted for 91% of\ngirls, was characterized by low probabilities for ASB (No\nProblems). However, 8.8% of girls fell into Class 2\n(Exclusive Covert), characterized by significantly higher\nprobabilities for endorsing covert forms of ASB [vandalism\n(0.28)] but low probabilities for overt ASB [pulling a knife\nor gun on someone (0.10) and shooting or stabbing\nsomeone (0.04)]. Unlike boys, there was no evidence of a\nthird class for girls (e.g., mixed covert and overt).\nFigure 2 shows the prevalence of class membership and\nthe probability of positively endorsing an item in boys.\nNearly 85% of boys fell into Class 1, characterized by\nminor ASB (No Problems). These individuals had low\nprobabilities for endorsing vandalism (0.18), stealing\nand pulling a knife or gun on someone (<0.01). Class 2\n(Exclusive Covert) consisted of 10.6% of boys with higher\nprobabilities for covert ASB [vandalism (0.79), stealing\nfor overt ASB [pull a knife a gun on someone (<0.01),\nshoot or stab someone (<0.01)]. 4.5% of boys fell into\nClass 3, who had high probabilities for covert and overt\nASB (Mixed ASB group): stealing (0.65), selling marijuana\npulling a knife or gun on someone (0.89).\nPredicting Latent Class Membership\nWe then modeled the probability of class membership using\nlatent class multinomial regression (Table 2). We first\ncompared the probability of membership in the Exclusive\nCovert group vs. No Problems group in girls. Although 5-\nHTTLPR genotype was not significantly related to class\np=0.02) and its interaction with 5-HTTLPR genotype (=\nExclusive Covert group. Among maltreated girls with the\nSS genotype, the odds of being in the Exclusive Covert\ngroup were 12 times higher than the odds of being in the\nNo Problems group. In contrast, the odd ratios (Exclusive\nCovert vs. No Problems) for the SL (1.67) and LL groups\n(2.77) were both not significantly related to the probability\nof being in the Exclusive Covert group. There were also\nno significant genotype effects for girls that were not\nmaltreated.\nUsing a parallel analytic strategy for boys, we first\ncompared the Mixed ASB to the No Problems group\ncantly related to class membership. Next, comparing the\nExclusive Covert to the No Problems group, there were no\nsignificant effects for maltreatment, 5-HTTLPR genotype,\nrespectively). In addition, we note that when the interaction\nterms were not included in the models, the effects for 5-\nHTTLPR and maltreatment were not significant for boys or\ngirls (data available upon request).\nFinally, because passive gene-environment correlation\n(rGE) can complicate the interpretation of G x E (Jaffee and\nPrice 2007), we explored whether genotype was signifi-\ncantly associated with maltreatment. After controlling for\nage, race-ethnicity, family income and sex, maltreatment\nwas unrelated with 5-HTTLPR genotype (r=-0.007, df=\nrGE confounded the observed interaction.\nPredicting Counts of ASB\nTo provide an additional characterization of variability in\nASB, we analyzed counts of overt and covert ASB at\nWave 1 (i.e., sum of positive endorsements for each item)\nusing log-linear regression (SAS PROC GENMOD) based\nNumber of Classes BIC Adjusted BIC Free Parameters\nTable 1 Fit Indices for LCA\nModels with 1\u00ad6 Classes\nBold indicates best fitting model\nBIC = Bayesian information\ncriterion\nVandalism Steal > $50 Break in Sell Marijuana Threaten Weapon Pull Knife/Gun Shoot/Stab\nProbabilities\nExclusive Covert (8.8%)\nFig. 1 Latent class membership\nprobabilities for girls\non 5-HTTLPR genotype, maltreatment, and their interaction\n(controlling for age, race-ethnicity and family income).\nAmong boys, genotype and maltreatment were not signif-\np=0.84, respectively).

At Wave 3, only a single latent class was detected\nfor boys and girls.\nDiscussion\nTo improve traction on the underlying structure of ASB, we\nused latent class analysis (LCA) to empirically derive\ngroups of adolescents based on their self-reported ASB.\nOur analyses yielded several key findings: (1) Boys and\ngirls differed in the number of empirically distinct groups,\nwith boys being optimally characterized by three classes\n(No Problems, Exclusive Covert, and Mixed Covert and\nOvert) whereas girls consisted of two classes (No Problems,\nExclusive Covert); (2) Maltreatment was significantly\nrelated to the likelihood of Exclusive Covert ASB class\nmembership for girls, but not for boys; and (3) In girls, the\ninfluence of maltreatment and Exclusive Covert ASB status\nwas moderated by 5-HTTLPR genotype. Among maltreated\ngirls, the SS genotype conferred a 12 times increase in the\nodds of being in the Exclusive Covert group than in the No\nProblems group. No significant interaction was found for\nboys. Furthermore, genotype and maltreatment were not\nsignificantly related with age, sex, family income, and race-\nethnicity controlled, thereby reducing the likelihood of\npassive rGE. Finally, when ASB was assessed separately at\neach wave across 6\u00ad7 years of development, we found that\nthe number of ASB classes derived decreased over time for\ngirls and boys. At Wave 2, boys and girls were similarly\ncharacterized by two latent classes: for boys, Exclusive\nCovert was no longer identified by LCA whereas the\nstructure of ASB in girls was similar to Wave 1. However,\nby Wave 3, a single class solution characterized ASB in\nboys and girls. The results suggest that overt and covert\nforms of ASB are distinct in boys, but covert ASB prevails\nin girls. These findings extend earlier factor-analytic studies\ndemonstrating that covert and overt forms of ASB are not\nmutually exclusive, as overtly aggressive youth often\ncommit more non-violent offenses than exclusively non-\nviolent offenders (Farrington 1998). Specifically for boys,\nviolent offenders were more likely to participate in covert\nASB whereas covert offenders showed more specificity in\ntheir offending. This pattern may be due to stronger genetic\ninfluences for overt/aggressive ASB than covert/non-ag-\ngressive ASB (Burt 2009). Moreover, there is considerable\ngenetic and phenotypic overlap between overt and covert\nASB (Willoughby et al. 2001), although there are also\nunique genetic influences. Some genes may be specific to\novert ASB, although these investigations are still in their\ninfancy (Burt 2009). Our findings on the structural changes\nTable 3 Latent Class Multinomial Logistic Regression Models for Boys\nVariables Mixed ASB vs. No Problems Exclusive Covert vs. No Problems\nCovariates = age, race-ethnicity, and family income; 5-HTTLPR = serotonin transporter genotype (SS, SL, or LL); B = parameter estimate (in\nlogits); SE = standard error; OR = odds ratio\nin ASB from adolescence to adulthood reflect prevailing\ntheories about the reliable decrease in the frequency of ASB\nand the number of offenders from adolescence to early\nadulthood (Moffitt 1993). Alternatively, the processes\nunderlying adolescent ASB may be expressed in different\nbehaviors not captured by this particular assessment. For\nexample, substance use disorders may be more prominent\nin early adulthood relative to developmentally-sensitive\nforms of ASB and delinquency (Glantz et al. 2009).\nFor girls, ASB was exclusively covert in nature, with no\nempirically-derived group of overt offenders. In this large\nsample of girls, the absence of an overt class of ASB is\nconsistent with previous reviews (Keenan et al. 1999; Eley\nengage disproportionately in non-aggressive ASB (Crick\nand Zahn-Wexler 2003). Unfortunately, data on indirect\naggression were unavailable in this sample. Relational\naggression may be crucial to understand ASB in girls.\nwould not have been classified as \"aggressive\" without\nincluding indirect aggression. Sex differences in empathy\nmay also contribute to the salience of covert ASB in girls\ngirls express more empathy, guilt, and rumination than boys\nfollowing a conflict and may be less likely to use physical\naggression (Keenan et al. 1999). However, despite being\nless overtly aggressive than boys, antisocial girls still\nexperience severe long-term consequences in adulthood,\nincluding significant mental health, physical health, and\neconomic problems (Odgers et al. 2008), reflecting a\ngreater need to understand mediators of outcome among\ncovertly aggressive girls.\nImportantly, we found a significant interaction between\nmaltreatment and 5-HTTLPR genotype in predicting\nmembership in the Exclusive Covert ASB group for girls,\nbut not for boys. In the presence of maltreatment, the SS\ngenotype was robustly related to ASB, with a 12 fold\nincrease in the odds of being in the Exclusive Covert group\nthan in the No Problems group. The S allele has been\nconsistently implicated in previous studies of ASB (Uher\n2004), given its association with decreased 5-HT transport-\ner functioning (Hariri et al. 2002). However, the effect of\ndecreased 5-HT transporter functioning on cortical 5-HT\nand subsequent ASB is not well understood (Beitchman et\nmay be a strong risk factor for ASB in girls and 5-HTTLPR\ngenotype may differentially increase susceptibility to\nmaltreatment in girls than in boys. This may reflect\nheightened sensitivity to environmental stressors. For\nexample, relative to boys, girls react more negatively to\nfamily disruptions, peer problems, and stress perception\nKeenan et al. 1999). In the context of peer problems, for\nexample, girls gain less from engaging in overt ASB,\nrelative to boys, because girls who engage in overtly\naggressive behaviors are often more rejected than their male\ncounterparts. Instead, they are more likely to gain peer\nsupport by spreading rumors or lies, ostracizing others, and\nengaging in other covert ASB (Keenan et al. 1999).\nEmerging work also suggests that the S allele enhances\nsensitivity to environmental conditions, both in the pres-\nence of environmentally negative and nurturing conditions\nexample, SS homozygotes had the highest risk for\ndepression in combination with early childhood adversity,\nbut they also had the fewest symptoms of depression when\nthey were exposed to a positive rearing environment\n(Taylor et al. 2006). Thus, putative risk genotypes may\nsimultaneously increase responsiveness to enriching envi-\nronments and perhaps to intervention as well. This theory\nhas yet to be thoroughly interrogated for ASB and other\nphenotypes. Consequently, we await further tests that genes\nconcurrently influence responsiveness to environmental\nadversity and nurturance.\nAlthough our LCA uncovered distinct latent classes for\nASB in boys and girls, we supplemented the LCA approach\nwith log-linear regression models using counts of overt and\ncovert ASB. Notably, even when count data were used to\ncharacterize ASB in girls at Wave 1, there was a significant\nmain effect for 5-HTTLPR genotype for covert ASB and a\nsignificant interaction between 5-HTTLPR genotype and\nmaltreatment for both overt and covert ASB. Crucially,\nLCA and log-linear models both indicated that genotype\nand covert ASB at Wave 1 was associated only in\nmaltreated girls. However, to more thoroughly assess\npotential for G x E effects across development, we\nconstructed identical log-linear models of overt and covert\nASB at Wave 2 and Wave 3 using maltreatment, genotype,\nand their interaction. Unlike Wave 1, there was no effect of\nmaltreatment, genotype, or their interaction on overt and\ncovert ASB at Wave 2. Similarly, at Wave 3, there was only\nevidence of maltreatment effects on covert ASB in boys\nand girls, but no evidence of genotype or G x E effects.\nThus, the G x E effects on ASB was limited to Wave 1\nwhen participants were 12\u00ad20 years. Finally, our LCA at\nWave 3 revealed no distinguishable latent classes for ASB\nfor either sex, suggesting that a distinction between covert\nand overt ASB may not be empirically warranted later in\ndevelopment (e.g., adulthood).\nWe emphasize several important limitations to our study.\nFirst, ASB was ascertained through self-report, which may\nunderestimate ASB (Huizinga and Elliot 1986). Youth with\nsevere ASB are known to be elusive in some studies\nbecause they are uncooperative and absent from school/\nhome (Farrington 1998). Additional informants and sources\nof ASB (e.g., official records) may improve measurement\nchildhood maltreatment was assessed retrospectively, which\nmay be influenced by mood states or psychopathology,\ninaccurate recall, and/or lack of trust. However, Smith et al.\n(2008) compared self-reported maltreatment with official\nstate records of maltreatment and found that both methods\npredicted antisocial outcomes in adolescence/adulthood, but\ncombining the measures did not improve predictive\nvalidity. Second, to correct discrepancies in item response\ntypes (e.g., count vs. dichotomous), we dichotomized all\nresponses. This may have reduced variance and statistical\npower. However, Farrington and Loeber (2000) contend\nthat dichotomization does not greatly affect the strength of\nassociations. Third, recent findings suggest that the Lg\nallele may be transcriptionally similar to the S allele and\nthat both \"low expressing variants\" are related to childhood\naggression (Beitchman et al. 2006). However, the Lg allele\nwas not genotyped in this sample. Fourth, our analysis of\nsex differences in the G x E effect for ASB was not\nformally indicated by a significant interaction. We con-\nducted a priori analyses separately in boys and girls based\non the number of different classes (3 and 2, respectively)\nindicated by LCA and a significant difference in the\ndistribution of sex in the best fitting 2-class model. Fifth,\nalthough latent transition analysis (LTA) is appropriate for\nASB trajectories, LTA necessitates that items and classes\nare factorially invariant across each assessment (Cumsille et\nal. 2002). One option to achieve factorial invariance is to\nconstrain responses probabilities to specific items at each\nwave (Reboussin et al. 2007), thereby ensuring class\nstability. However, given the strong effect of age on ASB\n(overall and in this study) and the factorial variability\nacross the three waves in boys and girls, this approach was\nprohibitive. Nevertheless, we cannot address whether an\ninteraction between maltreatment and 5-HTTLPR genotype\ninfluences class membership trajectories. Finally, we\nemphasize that the G x E effects on ASB were specific to\nWave 1, suggesting that G x E may be developmentally-\nspecific. For example, age moderated genetic and environ-\nmental influences in a meta-analysis of ASB (Rhee and\nWaldman 2002). Thus, given the centrality of environmen-\ntal influences on gene expression, G x E effects must be\ninterpreted in the context of ongoing developmental\ninfluences.\nIn summary, LCA derived distinct groups of ASB\noffenders in boys and girls (three and two classes,\nrespectively). Consistent with previous studies (Loeber\nwere best characterized by a No Problem, Exclusive\nCovert, and Mixed Overt and Covert group of offenders.\nHowever, among girls, a 2-class model was indicated,\nconsisting of No Problem and Exclusive Covert groups\nonly. We also uncovered evidence of G x E between\nmaltreatment and 5-HTTLPR, but only for girls. Specifi-\ncally, maltreated girls with the SS genotype of the 5-\nHTTLPR gene were more likely to be in the Exclusive\nCovert group than girls with different genotypes. We\nanticipate that integrated models of risk, incorporating\ngenetic and environmental constructs with empirically-\nderived groups of youth, will facilitate the development\nand implementation of targeted interventions to reduce the\nconsiderable burden associated with significant ASB.\n"
