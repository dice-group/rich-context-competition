Studies often fail to adequately test the causal relationship between volunteering and well-being. Yet the\nmedia and empirical research have focused attention on the impact of volunteering on the well-being of elderly persons.\nThis study addresses two questions: First, does volunteering improve the psychological and physical well-being of el-\nderly persons? Second, do elderly volunteers experience different benefits than younger adults?\nMethods. Using nationally representative panel data, I assessed the long-term impact of volunteering on the life sat-\nisfaction and perceived health of persons aged 60 and over. I then compared ordinary least squares regression results for\nseniors with those for younger adults.\nResults. I found that older volunteers experienced greater increases in life satisfaction over time as a result of their\nvolunteer hours than did younger adult volunteers, especially at high rates of volunteering. Older adults experienced\ngreater positive changes in their perceived health than did younger adult volunteers.\nDiscussion. The type of volunteer work in which older and younger adults engage may be part of the reason for these\ndifferential effects. But the context in which older and younger adults volunteer and the meaning of their voluntarism are\nmore likely explanations. Researchers should take into account volunteer commitment when studying volunteering's ef-\nfect on well-being, not simply volunteer role.\nHE media are replete with representations of volunteer-\ning as critical to the well-being of the nation as a\nwhole, and as beneficial to the individual volunteer. Particu-\nlar attention has been paid in both the popular press and ac-\nademic outlets to the potential contributions of volunteering\nto the well-being of elderly persons. In fact, past research\nhas suggested that volunteering does improve the physical\nand psychological well-being of elderly persons by maintain-\ning self-esteem, life satisfaction, access to support systems,\nand activity level (e.g., Bond, 1982; Duncan & Whitney,\ngow 1998). However, although suggestive, there are a\nnumber of ways in which previous studies have failed to\nadequately address the question of whether voluntarism in-\ncreases well-being among elderly persons. Some studies of\nvolunteering have focused on perceived benefits rather than\nactual outcomes (e.g., Hodgkinson, 1995; Hodgkinson &\nsamples and/or failed to include a control group of nonvol-\ncluded data at more than one time point (but see Moen et\nMcMahon, 1999); therefore, it is not known whether volun-\nteering is the cause of improved well-being among seniors or\na consequence of a higher level of well-being to begin with.\nAs Altergott (1988) has pointed out, gerontological stud-\nies often focus solely on older persons either by limiting the\nsurvey sample to older ages or by choosing older respon-\ndents from a broader dataset for secondary analysis. This\nhas been the case with much of the research on volunteering\nand its benefits. This focused attention on volunteering\namong elderly persons begs the question of whether volun-\nteering among elderly persons is in any way unique in its\nbenefits. Are the benefits of volunteering to elderly persons\nany different from those experienced by younger volunteers?\nIn this article, I examine the impact of volunteering on\nphysical and psychological well-being among elderly per-\nsons and contrast these benefits with those experienced by\nyounger volunteers. Drawing from several theoretical per-\nspectives, I propose and test alternative hypotheses as to the\nmagnitude of volunteering's impacts on the well-being of\nelderly persons versus younger adults. I address the weak-\nnesses of much previous research by using nationally represen-\ntative panel data from the Americans' Changing Lives 1986\nand 1989 surveys. I conclude by discussing gaps in the current\nknowledge about volunteering and, therefore, its effects.\nVolunteering and Well-Being Across the Life Course\nAt any given time, approximately 50% of Americans engage\nin volunteer work (Hodgkinson & Weitzman, 1990; Sundeen,\npoint in their lifetime (Hodgkinson, 1995). In its broadest con-\nceptualization, volunteer work is generally understood to be\nunpaid work on the part of an individual or a group of individu-\nals with the intent of benefitting others (Loeser, 1974; Scheier,\ntinguish volunteer work as unpaid work on behalf of those with\nwhom one has no contractual, familial, or friendship obligation.\nT\nEvidence of age differences in volunteering suggests that\nparticipation may be more normative at various points in the\nlife course. Although voluntary work increases with age\nKnoke & Thompson, 1977; Umberson, Chan, House, Hop-\nkins, & Slaten, 1996), the probability of being engaged in\nvolunteer work drops off at the older ages, making it most\nlikely in middle age (Fischer & Schaffer, 1993; Hayghe,\ndo volunteer invest more hours into their volunteer work\nthan do younger volunteers (Gallagher, 1994), probably at\nleast in part because they have more uncommitted time.\nIn addition to the age differences in time spent volunteer-\ning, elderly volunteers donate their time to different types of\norganizations than do younger volunteers. Younger volun-\nteers often engage in volunteering as an extension of their\nother roles, participating in their local Parents and Teachers\nAssociation, for example (Sundeen, 1990; Wilson & Mu-\nsick, 1997). By contrast, a recent study by the Independent\nwork with an educational institution. In Sundeen's (1990)\nstudy of predictors of volunteer participation, elderly adults\nwere also less likely to donate time to a political organiza-\ntion than were their younger counterparts. Religious-based\nvolunteering is an especially popular choice among elderly\npersons; 65% donate time to their church or synagogue (In-\ndependent Sector, 1998). Younger volunteers are most\nlikely to focus their efforts on religious organizations when\nthey are married and have dependent, especially preschool\nThus, volunteer activity varies across the life course in\nterms of who takes on the volunteer role, how much time is\ncommitted, and the types of organizations that benefit from\nvolunteers' efforts. Most research on the impact of volun-\nteering has measured the simple absence or presence of the\nvolunteer role (e.g., Krause, Herzog, & Baker, 1992; McIn-\ntosh & Danigelis, 1995), failing to take into account the fact\nthat volunteers may be more or less active. The handful of\nstudies that have considered the impact of volunteer com-\nmitment include hours volunteered with the volunteer role\nmeasure in multivariate analyses. These studies have found\nno significant association between volunteer hours and\nwell-being (e.g., Musick et al., 1999). On the other hand,\nrange of types of organizations to which a volunteer donates\ntime is related to well-being. There is no consensus on how\nvolunteering should be measured in analyses of its relation-\nship with individual well-being.\nMost studies have inferred that volunteering improves\nwell-being, while not testing causal order directly by using\nlongitudinal data collected from representative community\nsamples. In only a handful of published studies is the ques-\ntion of cause and effect addressed directly. Phyllis Moen\nvoluntary associations has a significant positive effect on\nphysical health and longevity in their longitudinal analyses\nof the impact of multiple role involvement among their\ncommunity sample of women. In fact, of all the social roles\nthey included in their analyses, membership in voluntary as-\nsociations has the single largest effect on both physical\nhealth and longevity. However, Moen and colleagues could\nnot disentangle what kind of activities occur in these organi-\nzations; therefore, the impact of membership may not be\nrepresentative of the effects of volunteer work. Further-\nmore, their study did not include men.\nTwo studies found that volunteering is negatively related\nto mortality. Oman and colleagues (1999) reported that el-\nder volunteers in a community sample experienced 44%\nlower mortality rates over a 5-year period than those who\ndid not volunteer. This difference was only partially ex-\nplained by health habits, physical functioning, religious at-\ntendance, and social support. Musick and colleagues (1999)\nfound that volunteering is negatively associated with mor-\ntality among elderly persons in a national sample. Both stud-\nies took into account time spent in volunteer work and the\nrange of organizations for which individuals volunteered.\nHowever, as they limited their sample to persons over 65,\ntheir results cannot be generalized to younger adults. Fur-\nthermore, they focused on only one measure of well-being.\nYet, despite their focused analyses, these studies provided\nstrong evidence that volunteering does in fact have an im-\npact on physical health. Perhaps if volunteering affects mor-\ntality, it also affects physical and psychological well-being.\nTheoretical Perspectives and Hypotheses\nThere are reasons to expect that it would. Beginning with\nDurkheim (1951), who emphasized the importance of pri-\nmary group ties, sociologists have argued that some posi-\ntions in society foster a subjective sense of alienation, or\ndisconnection with self and society, whereas others promote\na sense of attachment or integration (Mirowsky & Ross,\nfive major types of alienation that lead to psychological dis-\ntress: powerlessness, isolation, self-estrangement, meaning-\nlessness, and normlessness. In other words, the extent to\nwhich individuals feel they control the outcomes of their\nlives, believe they are part of a supportive community, find\ntheir daily work rewarding, have a sense of purpose to their\nlives, and expect that rewards can be achieved through so-\ncially normative means affects their psychological well-\nbeing. If volunteer work facilitates the development of these\n\"psychosocial resources\" among participants, the volunteer\nrole should have a positive effect on individual well-being\nfor both older and younger adults. Furthermore, the more\ntime one commits to volunteer work, the more access one\nshould have to these benefits. How the range of volunteer\nwork performed should relate to its benefits is less clear. On\nthe one hand, volunteering for a broad range of types of or-\nganizations should expose the volunteer to greater social\nnetworks and reinforce the belief that ends can be achieved\nthrough socially acceptable means. On the other hand, vol-\nunteers may feel pulled by their commitments to multiple\norganizations and, therefore, less in control of their lives. In\nsum, no matter how volunteering is measured it should be\npositively related to well-being.\nHerzog & House, 1991) suggests that elderly people who\nremain productive and maintain or create new social net-\nworks do better than do those who disengage from society\nand social commitments (Erikson, Erikson, & Kivnick,\n1972). There is ample evidence for the activity theory per-\nspective in social gerontology (see, e.g., Dorfman, Kohout, &\nsenior citizens occupy is negatively related to their level of\ndepression and positively related to physical health. If the\npredictions of activity theory hold, volunteering among el-\nderly persons should have a positive effect on psychological\nand physical well-being over time. Furthermore, the more\ntime they commit, the greater the impact of volunteering on\nwell-being should be. Because the range of commitments is\ncorrelated with time committed (Musick et al., 1999), the\nbroader the range, the greater the benefits should be.\nAs the literature review suggests, there are several rea-\nsons to expect that elderly adults may experience different\neffects as a result of their volunteerism than do younger\nadults. First, elderly adults are more active volunteers than\nare younger adults. If the predictions of activity theory hold,\ntherefore, being a volunteer should be more positively asso-\nciated with well-being among elderly persons than among\nyounger adults because elderly volunteers are more active\nthan younger volunteers. Second, elderly persons are less\nlikely to be involved in other activities, such as employment\nand child rearing, and therefore their volunteer work may\nhave a greater effect on their well-being.\nRole theory.--However, Herzog, House, and Morgan\n(1990) found that it is not only the roles individuals hold but\nalso the congruity between those role sets and individual\npreferences that determine individual well-being. Herzog\nand House (1991) went on to argue that it may therefore be\nthe discretionary nature of the activities, like voluntarism, in\nwhich seniors engage that make their activities particularly\nbeneficial. As discussed above, younger adults are more\nlikely to engage in volunteering that is an extension of their\nwork and child-care responsibilities (Sundeen, 1990; Wil-\nson & Musick, 1997)--and therefore may experience vol-\nunteering as less discretionary. Although controlling for\nfamily responsibilities and employment should take into ac-\ncount some of this difference in the contexts in which el-\nderly and younger adults volunteer, it cannot account for the\nfact that the nature of the activities is different. Whereas\nyoung adults may be more likely to experience the role\nstrain that results with conflicts between responsibilities\nspective argues that even in the absence of conflicts the\nmeaning of volunteering is different for elderly persons than\nfor younger adult volunteers. As a result, the effect of the\nvolunteer role and volunteer commitment on well-being\namong elderly persons should be greater than its effect on\nyounger adults. Range of types of organizations should also\nbe more strongly associated with well-being among older\nadults than among younger adults.\nData\nThis research used the first two waves of data from the\nAmericans' Changing Lives (ACL) survey, face-to-face in-\nbe preferable, the third wave of the data is not yet publicly\navailable. The original sample consisted of 3,617 adults\naged 25 years or older. Black people and people over age 60\nwere sampled at twice the rate of non-Blacks and people un-\nder 60. A 21% attrition rate at Time 2 led to a final sample\nof 2,867 respondents who were successfully interviewed at\nboth time points and not missing data on the measures of\nwell-being, volunteering, or age.\nMEASURES\nDependent Variables\nIn this research, I used two measures of well-being. First,\nI assessed the effect of volunteering on life satisfaction, one\nof the most commonly measured outcomes in research on\nthe benefits of volunteering and in research on psychologi-\ncal well-being. Second, I measured physical well-being by\nusing perceived health. Previous studies have shown that\nself-reported health is highly correlated with physicians' as-\nsessments and with measures of morbidity and mortality\nfore a valid and reliable measure of physical well-being\nthough psychological and physical well-being are recipro-\ncally related (Gove & Hughes, 1979), they are different\nconstructs and therefore not perfectly correlated.\nLife satisfaction.--Respondents were asked, \"Now\nplease think about your life as a whole. How satisfied are\nyou with it--are you . . . ?\" Response categories ranged\nfrom not at all satisfied (1) to completely satisfied (5).\nPerceived health.--Respondents were asked, \"How\nwould you rate your health at the present time?\" Responses\nwere coded from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).\nIndependent Variables\nMost studies have examined the impact of the presence or\nabsence of the volunteer role on well-being. In this study, I\ncompared and contrasted the presence or absence of the vol-\nunteer role with the extent of individuals' involvement in\nvoluntarism.\nVolunteer role.--Respondents were first asked if, in the\npast 12 months, they had done any volunteer work for \"1) a\nchurch, synagogue or other religious organization; 2) a\nschool or educational organization; 3) a political group or\nlabor union; 4) a senior citizen group or related organiza-\ntion; and/or 5) any other national or local organization, in-\ncluding United Fund, hospitals, and the like.\" A dummy\nvariable was created for the volunteer role, coded 1 if the re-\nspondent reported performing volunteer work for any orga-\nnization and 0 if the respondent performed no volunteer\nwork.\nVolunteer hours.--After having identified the type of\norganization for which they had performed volunteer work,\nif any, respondents were asked to report the number of\nhours they spent on volunteer work during the past 12\nmonths. Original response categories included (0) none, (1)\nrecoded to the midpoint of each response category. Cate-\nthe regression analyses, the measure was centered around the\nmean in order to avoid problems of multicollinearity when\ntesting curvilinear relationships and interaction effects (Aiken\nRange of volunteering.--Two dummy variables were\ncomputed for range of types of organizations for which the\nrespondent performed volunteer work in the past 12 months.\nOne organization was coded 1 if the respondent reported\nperforming volunteer work for just one organization, 0 if\nnot. More than one organization was coded 1 if the respon-\ndent performed volunteer work for more than one organiza-\ntion, 0 if not. Rietschlin (1998) found that the benefits of\nparticipation in increasing numbers of types of organiza-\ntions drops off significantly after two.\nAge.--Age was coded in years. A recent study by Gen-\ndell and Siegel (1996) documented that retirement is begin-\nning younger today than at any other time in the latter half\nof this century for both men and women, Blacks and\nWhites. The median age at retirement for men and women\ntween 61% and 75% of White and Black men and women in\n1993 had received social security retirement benefits by 62\u00ad\n64 years. Therefore, the sample was stratified into older\nadults (age 60 and older) and younger adults (under 60) in\norder to compare adults of retirement age with younger\nadults who face greater expectations to participate in the la-\nbor force. The interval measure of age was also included in\nthe analyses to control for variations in age within each age\ngroup.\nControl Variables\nSocial roles.--Living as Married was coded 1 for those\nwho were married or living together with someone as mar-\nried and 0 for those who were not married or cohabiting.\nParent was coded 1 for those with children aged 17 or\nyounger in the household versus 0 for those with no depen-\ndent children in the home. Employed contrasted those em-\nployed full or part time (1) with those who were not em-\nployed (0).\nSocioeconomic status.--Education was coded intervally\nto represent the highest year of schooling completed and\nranged from 0 to 17. Missing values were coded to the\nmean. Family income was the total gross income of the re-\nspondent and spouse. Income was originally coded in cate-\nI used the imputed income measure calculated by the ACL\nstaff, which assigns income values to the midpoint of each cat-\negory. Economic strain was a measure of how difficult it was\nfor respondents and/or their family to meet the monthly pay-\nments on their bills. Response categories ranged from (0)\nnot difficult at all to (4) extremely difficult. Missing values\nwere recoded to the mean.\nFunctional impairment.--Respondents were asked if\nthey had any difficulties, and if so how much, in performing\na variety of daily tasks, including bathing by themselves,\nclimbing a few flights of stairs, walking several blocks, and\ndoing heavy work around the house such as shoveling snow\nor washing walls. Response categories included (0) no diffi-\nculty, (1) a little, (2) some, (3) a lot, and (4) cannot do. I\nused the imputed version of functional impairment com-\nputed by the ACL staff, which is an index ranging from 0 to\n4, with 4 representing a great deal of functional difficulty.\nSocial integration.--This was measured in two ways.\nTo measure informal social integration, respondents were\nasked how often they talked with friends and family mem-\nbers by phone and how often they visited with friends and\nfamily. Responses included (1) never, (2) less than once a\nweek, (3) 2\u00ad3 times a week, (4) once a day, and (5) more\nthan once a day. The two questions were averaged. Formal\nsocial integration was measured by the respondent's re-\nported attendance at religious services. Responses included\n(1) never, (2) less than once a week, (3) two to three times a\nweek, (4) once a day, and (5) more than once a day.\nSocial support.--Respondents were asked, \"On the whole,\nhow much do your friends and relatives make you feel loved\nand cared for?\" and \"How much are these friends and rela-\ntives willing to listen when you need to talk about your wor-\nries or problems?\" Response categories included (1) a great\ndeal, (2) quite a bit, (3) some, (4) a little, and (5) not at all.\nResponses were reverse-coded, and the two questions were\naveraged.\nMastery.--Respondents were asked whether they (1)\nstrongly agree, (2) somewhat agree, (3) somewhat disagree,\nor (4) strongly disagree with each of the following state-\nments: \"Sometimes I feel that I am being pushed around in\nlife\" and \"There is really no way that I can solve the prob-\nlems I have.\" The two questions were averaged.\nSociodemographic characteristics.--Sex was coded 1\nfor women and 0 for men. Race was coded 1 for Blacks and\n0 for Whites and others. Members of other racial/ethnic\ngroups made up only 5.8% of the sample; each group made\nup no more than 2.2% of the sample.\nFirst, I present descriptive statistics to illustrate differ-\nences between volunteers and nonvolunteers aged 60 and\nolder and under 60. To test the effects of volunteering on the\nwell-being of older versus younger adults, I present net ef-\nfects models, estimating life satisfaction and perceived\nhealth in 1989, controlling for each measure of well-being\nat Time 1. Previous studies have found no significant effect\nof volunteer time when time is included in the same model\nas the volunteer role. I estimated models with each measure\nseparately because the vast majority of volunteers commit a\nsmall amount of time to their volunteer work. Therefore,\nmulticollinearity is a potential problem and may explain\nprevious insignificant findings. Although the sample is\nstratified by age, I included the interval measure of age to\ncontrol for variations in age within each group. Because or-\ndinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses can be prob-\nlematic with ordinal-level outcomes (Long, 1997), the re-\nsults presented here were replicated by using Stata to\nestimate ordered logit models. As the results did not vary, I\npresent the OLS results here. The significance of differ-\nences in the effects of volunteering across the two age\ngroups were tested with a t statistic (Jaccard, Turrisi, &\nWan, 1990). To test for the effects of sample attrition on the\nobserved relationships, I replicated the analyses presented\nhere by using Heckman's probit-based lambda procedure\nout of the sample calculated separately for individuals over\nthe age of 60 and those under 60 (available from me on re-\nquest).\nRESULTS\nForty-seven percent of the respondents had engaged in\nsome type of volunteer work during the past year when in-\nadults and 39% of older adults volunteered (see Table 1).\nOlder adults were, however, more likely to be active volun-\nteers. Thirty-one percent of older volunteers reported per-\nforming 80 or more volunteer hours in the past 12 months,\nin contrast to 24% of younger volunteers. Thirty-four per-\ncent of younger volunteers and 29% of older volunteers re-\nported performing fewer than 20 hours of volunteer work\nover the course of the year. In 1986, older volunteers per-\nformed approximately 72 hours of volunteer work, whereas\nyounger volunteers donated about 63 hours (p  .05). In\nother words, elderly persons worked 45 minutes more per\nmonth on average. The difference was even greater in 1989,\nwhen the average hours for younger adults dropped to ap-\nAlthough there were no significant differences between\nelder volunteers and younger volunteers in range of volun-\nteering, there were significant differences in the types of or-\nganizations for which older and younger adults volunteered.\nAs previous studies have documented, religion-based vol-\nunteering was the most common, especially among elderly\npersons. Sixty-six percent of older adults participated in\nvolunteer work at their church or synagogue in contrast to\napproximately half of younger adults (p  .001). Seniors\nwere also more likely to volunteer at senior centers (p \n.001), whereas younger adults were significantly more\nlikely to volunteer for a school or other educational institu-\ntion (p  .001). A large proportion of adults in each age\ngroup stated that they volunteer for another type of organi-\nzation, like the United Way.\nTests of the relationships between volunteering and the\ncontrol variables confirmed most previous findings. How-\never, in contrast to some previous studies I found that\nBlacks in both age groups were significantly less likely to\nof Blacks over age 60 volunteered as compared with 40% of\nWhites and others; similarly, 42% of Blacks under age 60\nvolunteered compared with 49% of non-Blacks (p  .05).\nThese findings are likely the result of differences in mea-\nsurement of volunteering; previous studies examining racial\ndifferences have focused on membership in voluntary asso-\nciations that are service oriented but may not engage solely\nin volunteer work (e.g., Cohen & Kapsis, 1978; Florin,\nJones, & Wandersman, 1986; Williams, Babchuck, &\nJohnson, 1973). In fact, many of the organizations included\nin these studies engage in community organizing and politi-\ncal activism, which may explain why Blacks in these studies\nreported higher levels of involvement. Further research is\nneeded to clarify the relationship between race and volun-\nteer work. As have previous studies (e.g., Curtis et al., 1992;\nfound mixed results among men and women. Women over\nage 60 were no more likely to volunteer than their male\ncounterparts and reported no greater commitments of volun-\nteer time. Conversely, although women under age 60 were\nmore likely to volunteer (p  .05), men in this age group\ncontributed significantly more volunteer time when they did\nvolunteer than their female counterparts (70 hours vs 57\nhours, p  .001). All other relationships were consistent\nwith the findings of previous studies. Volunteers in both age\ngroups were younger and had fewer functional impairments,\nwere more likely to be married and to be employed, had\nhigher levels of education and family income, reported less\neconomic strain, were more socially integrated with family\nand friends, attended religious services more often, and had\nhigher perceived levels of social support and mastery (see\nTable 1). Among young adults, volunteers were more likely\nto have children than were nonvolunteers.\nThe Effect of Volunteering on Elderly Persons\nOlder adults who did not volunteer reported significantly\nworse health than did their volunteering counterparts in\nalso reported higher levels of life satisfaction than nonvol-\nunteers at both time points, although the difference was only\nsignificant at Time 2 (p  .05). Why did elderly volunteers\nexperience higher levels of well-being than nonvolunteers?\nWas it a result of their volunteer activities, or was it simply\nthat volunteers have fewer functional impairments, are more\nsocially integrated, and have higher levels of socioeconomic\nstatus than nonvolunteers, all factors that are positively as-\nsociated with well-being? To answer these questions, I used\nOLS regression analysis to estimate the net effect of volun-\nteering and volunteer commitment in 1986 on life satisfac-\ntion and perceived health, respectively, in 1989.\nNo matter how volunteering was measured, it was posi-\ntively associated with life satisfaction and perceived health\namong older adults (see Tables 2 and 3). It was not simply\nthe case that volunteers are the kind of people who are more\nsatisfied with their lives and healthier in the first place. In\nfact, additional analyses tested whether well-being increased\nvolunteering at Time 2; the results were insignificant (results\navailable from me), although functional impairment was an\nimportant predictor of volunteer commitment in all the mod-\nels. Thus, although physical limitations may restrict volun-\nteer activity, physical and psychological well-being do not\npredict volunteering.\nThere are some differences in the findings for each mea-\nsure of volunteering. The volunteer role is positively associ-\nteering for more than one type of organization resulted in a\n26% greater increase in life satisfaction and a 63% greater\nincrease in perceived health than the benefits experienced\nfrom volunteering for just one type of organization. The re-\nlationship between volunteer hours and satisfaction with life\nwas positive and significant; satisfaction increased with\never, the relationship between volunteer commitment and\nperceived health was not linear (see Table 3). The physical\nbenefits of volunteering began to decrease after 100 hours\nper year, and if the pattern continues, volunteering would\nbegin to negatively affect health at 140 hours per year--or\nthe equivalent of 2.7 hours per week. Because the analysis\ncontrolled for age, it is not the case that this nonlinear effect\nis the result of grouping young elderly persons with older\nelderly persons, who are more likely to be in failing health.\nAlthough the imprecision of the response categories for vol-\nunteer hours in the data did not allow an accurate estimate\nof how many seniors in this sample experienced these nega-\ntive effects of volunteer work, only 7.5% of seniors donated\nniors, volunteering had positive health implications.\nThe majority of the volunteer work in which seniors en-\ngage occurs in the context of a religious organization, and\nattendance at religious services is positively associated with\nlife satisfaction (Ellison, 1991) and negatively associated\nwith mortality (Hummer, Rogers, Nam, & Ellison, 1999;\nStrawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1997). To test whether\nthe impact of volunteer work was simply a benefit of associ-\nation with a religious group, I included attendance at reli-\ngious services in the analyses as a control variable. The im-\npact of the volunteer role on life satisfaction decreased by\nTable 1.

Volunteering's impact on perceived health increased\n14% with the addition of religious attendance. Like Musick\nand colleagues (1999), I found that volunteering is not a\nproxy for participation in religious activities.\nChambr\u00e9 (1987) argued that it may simply be physical\nactivity that makes involvement in social roles important to\nthe well-being of elderly persons. However, in additional\nanalyses controlling for how physically active seniors are--\nhow often they take walks, garden, and/or play sports--\nactivity level did not explain the impact of the volunteer\nrole on life satisfaction or perceived health. Activity level\nexplained less than 2% of the impact of volunteering on sat-\nisfaction and on health. Volunteering had benefits beyond\nsimple physical exertion. In sum, these results provide sup-\nport for the first set of expectations. Volunteering does have\npositive effects on elderly adults' physical and psychologi-\ncal well-being, and the more active volunteers are, the\ngreater the benefits.\nLife Course Comparisons\nHow does the impact of volunteering on elderly persons\ncompare with its benefits for younger adults? In comparing\nresults across the two groups, I used the unstandardized co-\nefficients because standardized coefficients are sensitive to\nunequal variances between the two groups (Pedhazur,\nTable 2.

The results of these analyses are graphed in Figures 1\nand 2 to allow for comparison. The equations represented in\nTables 2 and 3 were solved at mean levels of the control\nvariables for each age group.\nAs the figures illustrate, the analyses for each age group\nsuggest differences in the benefits of volunteering, and the\nresults for the two measures of well-being tell very different\nstories. Although the volunteer role was more positively as-\nsociated with life satisfaction among older adults than their\nyounger counterparts, it was only marginally so, and the dif-\ngests that volunteering has the same impact on the life satis-\nfaction of older and younger adults. However, when the\nimpacts of range of volunteering and volunteer hours were\ncompared across the two age groups, the relationship be-\ntween volunteering and life satisfaction was revealed to be\nquite different across the two groups. Although the differ-\nences in the impact of volunteering for one or more types of\norganizations were not significant across the two age groups,\nyounger adults experienced only a decrease in benefits from\nvolunteering for more than one type of organization instead\nof just one, whereas older adults experienced a 26% in-\ncrease in benefits. Furthermore, volunteer hours was curvi-\nlinearly associated with satisfaction among younger adults\nand linearly associated with satisfaction among seniors. Al-\nthough older adults gained additional benefits from increas-\ning levels of commitment, younger adults began to experi-\nence declining returns from their commitment after 100\nhours and experienced negative effects from their volunteer\nwork after 140 hours per year, or 2.7 hours per week.\nA comparison of the results for physical well-being also\nrevealed very different results for the role measure versus\nthe measure of commitment. The volunteer role's effect on\nperceived health was more than 2.5 times greater for elderly\nas discussed above, the relationship between volunteer\nhours and perceived health was curvilinear for seniors,\nwhereas young adults continued to accrue benefits as their\nlevel of commitment increased. Furthermore, older adults\nexperienced greater benefits from volunteering for either\none or more than one organization than did younger adults,\nalthough not significantly so, and younger adults who vol-\nunteered for more than one organization did not experience\nphysical benefits from their volunteer work.\nTests of interaction terms between the sociodemographic,\nsocioeconomic, social role, and social resource variables\nsuggest only a few, inconsistent differences in the impact of\nvolunteer work on well-being across members of different\nsocial groups. For example, Blacks under age 60 experi-\nenced smaller improvements in perceived health for every\nhour of volunteer work they performed than did non-Blacks\n(b  .002, p  .05). Race does not mediate the impact of\nthe volunteer role or volunteer hours on perceived health for\nolder adults or on life satisfaction for either age group. Vol-\nunteers under age 60 experiencing economic strain experi-\nenced fewer benefits in terms of life satisfaction for their vol-\nunteer hours than did those with less economic strain (b \n.001, p  .05). The volunteer role has less of an impact on\nthe life satisfaction of young adults with functional impair-\nments than of those without (b  .240, p  .10). Younger\nFigure 1.

Figure 1 was determined by solving the equation in Ta-\nble 2 at mean levels for control variables for each age group.\nvolunteers with high levels of social integration experienced\ngreater increases in their perceived health than those who\nspent less time with family and friends (b  .137, p  .01).\nFinally, the results of interactions indicate that younger adults\ndo not experience role strain as a result of combining volun-\nteering with being married, parenting children, or working\noutside the home. However, older adults who combined vol-\nunteering with marriage reported higher levels of perceived\nhealth than those who were not married or did not volunteer\n(b  .352, p  .01), and older adults who worked outside\nthe home reported higher life satisfaction when they volun-\nteer than did those who do not (b  .524, p  .05). Younger\nadults did not experience these benefits from combining\nroles.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study addressed two primary questions. First, does\nvolunteer work improve the psychological and physical\nwell-being of elderly persons? Second, do elderly volun-\nteers experience different benefits from their efforts than do\ntheir younger counterparts? These analyses confirm the\nlong-term impact of volunteer work on the well-being of\nelderly persons, using a representative sample of partici-\npants and non-participants and relying on actual versus ex-\npected outcomes.\nMuch of the research on the benefits of voluntarism has\nfocused on elderly volunteers. In this study, I also compared\nand contrasted the benefits experienced by older versus\nyounger adult volunteers. My results suggest that the atten-\ntion to senior volunteers has been warranted, not only be-\ncause seniors are less likely to have other social roles to\nkeep them active, socially integrated, and feeling productive,\nbut because they experience the greatest benefits. Further-\nmore, these greater benefits are not simply because seniors are\nmore active volunteers; older volunteers experience greater\npsychological benefits for each hour that they contribute than\ndo younger volunteers. And older volunteers experience\nsomewhat greater benefits for becoming active with multiple\ntypes of organizations than do younger adults. The different\nrelationships between volunteer commitment and the two\nmeasures of well-being across the two age groups suggest\nthat different mechanisms may mediate the impact of volun-\nteer work at high levels of commitment for each group.\nYoung adults who are heavily committed may be particu-\nlarly likely to have high levels of responsibility, including\nsupervising other volunteers, which may lead to stress,\nwhereas particularly high levels of volunteer commitment\nmay be physically taxing for some senior adults. However,\nthese questions cannot be addressed with these data.\nWhy older adults experience different benefits from their\nactivity than do younger volunteers may be in part related to\nthe types of activities in which they are involved. Unfortu-\nnately, the hours individuals reported volunteering were not\ndifferentiated by type of organization for which they volun-\nteered their time; therefore, these data cannot be used to\nfully investigate the role of patterns of volunteer activities\nin the age differential in benefits. However, in additional\nanalyses not shown, multivariate analyses were conducted\nfor the total sample, replacing the volunteer role with indi-\nvidual dummy variables for participation in volunteer work\nFigure 2. The effect of volunteer work on perceived health for\nolder and younger adults, controlling for perceived health at Time 1\nand control variables. Figure 2 was determined by solving the equa-\ntion in Table 3 at mean levels for control variables for each age group.\nfor each of the five types of organizations. As 46% of vol-\nunteers offered their services to more than one type of orga-\nnization, each of these dummy variables had to be entered\nindividually to avoid problems of multicollinearity. Consis-\ntent with the finding that older volunteers benefit more, the\nmost psychologically beneficial type of volunteer work,\nchurch-based voluntarism (b  .135, p  .05), was most\ncommon among older volunteers. Yet, the evidence is\nmixed. Younger adults were more likely to volunteer in\nschools, the second most beneficial activity in terms of life\nsatisfaction (b  .108, p  .05), than were older adults. Se-\nnior center voluntarism was the most physically beneficial\nand the second most common type of voluntarism among\nolder adults (b  .117, p  .05). It is followed by volunteer-\ning for a political organization and volunteering in a school\ning for different types of organizations yields varying bene-\nfits, and elder volunteers are more likely to volunteer for\nthose types of organizations that have the greatest impact on\nwell-being.\nAnother interpretation of the greater benefits experienced\nby older adult volunteers comes from a life course perspec-\ntive. The roles that individuals take on have different mean-\nings and occur in different contexts at various points in the\nlife course. Volunteering in old age may be a welcome alter-\nnative to hours spent at home, whereas volunteering in mid-\ndle age often happens as an off-shoot of other roles and,\ntherefore, may be perceived of as yet another obligatory\ntask to fulfill in order to be a good parent, worker, and so\nforth. Furthermore, the vast majority of adults over 60 be-\nlieve that older people should contribute to society through\ncommunity service after they have stopped working (Her-\nzog & House, 1991). Recent research by Robin Simon\n(1997) has suggested that the meanings individuals attach to\nparticular role identities may mediate the effect of these\nroles on their psychological well-being. Further research is\nneeded to test this explanation for the differential benefits\nexperienced across the life course. However, these analyses\nsuggest that efforts to encourage senior citizens to volunteer\nand to make volunteering more possible for elderly persons\nshould continue.\nMore detailed nationally representative data are needed to\nexplore how volunteers commit their time, what their volun-\nteering means to them, what kinds of activities they engage in\nwhen they do volunteer, and, therefore, what explains differ-\nential impacts on well-being. Furthermore, researchers should\nbe cautious when choosing a measure of volunteering. Past re-\nsearch has erroneously concluded that volunteer commit-\nment does not significantly affect the impact of the volun-\nteer role because including commitment in the same models\nas the volunteer role leads to multicollinearity. Yet most\ntheoretical arguments suggest that time spent in volunteer\nwork should affect its benefits. As these analyses indicate,\nchoice of measurement can greatly affect the results and\nconclusions drawn.\n"
