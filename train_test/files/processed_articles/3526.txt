Neither all psychopaths are criminal nor all\ncriminals are psychopaths. Individuals with psychopathic\ntraits are found in every walk of life. There is a significant\nrepresentation of the psychopaths in rapists, beaters, crimi-\nnals, unlicensed practitioners, child abusers, sexual offend-\ners, mass murderer, serial killers, and cunning leaders\nIn the past few decades, Pakistan has witnessed a rise in\ncrime rate. The number of crimes committed by Pakistanis\nsuch as robbery, car theft, snatching valuable items, rapes,\ngang rapes, and mass murders has been increased. It is\nwere gang raped. (Assadi, 2011). According to a report, most\ncrimes committed in Pakistan are car theft and mobile snatch-\ning. Most of these crimes are committed by young unedu-\ncated individuals aged 16 to 24. Most of the young offenders\nsoon become recidivists and hardened criminals (\"Youth in\nwere reported as most of the cases were reported from Punjab\nchild sexual abuse were reported with an increase of 17% in\nAccording to Daniel (2010), nearly all psychopaths find\nthemselves in trouble with the law because of their impul-\nsiveness and inflated sense of self-worth, without consider-\ning the consequences of the crimes they commit. Crimes\nsuch as murders, fraud, forgery, and theft are most common\nthat are committed by the psychopaths. According to Copley\n(2008a), psychopathic children have the habit of stealing,\nhaving sex, taking drug, and being cruel to animals and other\nchildren, and have no fear of punishment.\nPsychopaths have been characterized as having superfi-\ncial charm and adequate intelligence, also exhibiting features\nof poor adjustment such as deviant behavior. Psychopaths act\non impulse; have poor judgment, showing lack of empathy,\nremorse, shame; and are insincere. They have poorly moti-\nvatedantisocialbehaviorshowingegocentricity.Psychopaths\nfail to learn from experience, including punishing experience\nPsychopathy is said to have been associated with delin-\nquency, crimes, or aggressive behavior. It is observed that\npsychopaths have early criminal careers, commit more vio-\nlent and varied types of crimes, and show high rates of recid-\nivism (Hart & Hare, as cited in Sullivan, 1996).\nAccording to Edens, Campbell, and Weir (2007), psycho-\npaths display less fear of negative stimulus and a heartless\nmisuse of others especially for personal benefits, exhibit\nsevere antisocial behavior that is violent in nature as well,\nand show a high rate of recidivism (see also Frick & Dickens,\n1Hazara University, Mansehra, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nSher Dil, Department of Psychology, Hazara University, Mansehra 21110,\nPakistan.\nEmail: sherdilkhanjadoon@gmail.com\nPsychopathic Inclination Among\nIncarcerated Youth of Hazara\nDivision Pakistan\nSher Dil1 and Farhana Kazmi1\n Keywords\npsychopathy, gender differences, criminals\n2 SAGE Open\nIt is found in National Comorbidity Survey that 5.8% of\nmen and 1.2% of women population have lifetime risk of\ndeveloping psychopathy. The prevalence rate of serious\ncriminals stands at 75%. Males score higher as compared\nwith females and present a larger proportion (Port, 2007).\nIn the sample used by Harris, Rice, Hilton, Lalumi\u00e9re,\nyears, and their age significantly related to the psychopathy\nscores. Coid et al. (2009) measured the prevalence rate of\nprevalence rate of imprisoned females is 26% as compared\nwith 30% of males imprisoned.\nincarcerated male samples are psychopaths. Salekin, Rogers,\nUstad, and Sewell (1998) pointed out that female psychopa-\nmales are psychopaths.\nPsychopathy has been reported higher in adult as well as\njuvenile offenders, serial killers, mass murderers. Vaughn,\nNewhill, DeLisi, Beaver, and Howard (2008) investigated\nthe psychopathic features among female delinquents, and\nfound that interpersonal and affective facets of psychopathy\nrelated with violence and theft.\nPsychopathy has also generally been found associated\nwith recidivism and violence. Hemphill, Hare, and Wong\n(1998) reported that there is strong relationship among psy-\nchopathy, recidivism, including violent recidivism and sex-\nual recidivism. They found that there is 3 times more risk\ninvolved in committing a crime again.\nBuffington-Vollum, Edens, Johnson, and Johnson (2002)\nreported that psychopathy is associated with committing vio-\nlent offenses within institutions. Similar findings were\nreported by Hicks, Rogers, and Cashel (2000) that there was\na high rate of committing a violent infraction among psycho-\npaths as compared with non-psychopaths.\nPorter, Birt, and Boer (2001) studied the relationship\nbetween commencing violent crimes and psychopathy, and\nfound that high psychopathic individuals commit more\ncrimes and carry on doing so after adolescence.\nThe construct of psychopathy has shifted from adults to\nthe assessment of juvenile offenders, and its predictive\npower of aggressive behavior and violent acts among ado-\nlescents (Edens, Skeem, Cruise, & Cauffman, 2001).\nUnder Juvenile Justice Ordinance 2000, the juvenile was\ndefined as a child aged between 15 and 18. Pakistan is one\nof the countries where juvenile laws are not fully imple-\nmented. It is argued that juvenile delinquency has reached\nits epic proportion, and both law and society are unwilling\nto understand the danger related to it. Most of the children\nare kept with adults, which also increases the risk of abuse\ninvestigated the relationship between juvenile delin-\nquency and personality types of delinquents. They studied\nboth delinquent and non-delinquent youth aged between\n16 and 18 years, and found that delinquent youth scored\nhigher on the psychopathic measure of Minnesota\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Fakhar (2014)\nargued that Pakistan is one of the countries with higher\nrates of juvenile delinquency. She put forward a number\nof reasons for the delinquent behavior of youth such as\npoor socioeconomic status, parenting styles, and peer\ngroup affiliations. She suggested that the juvenile justice\nsystem should incorporate better policies to address the\nneed of delinquents. In a study by Gadit, Vahidy, and\nKhalid (1997), it was found that 9% of the child offenders\nmet the criteria for the psychopathy, and there is a poten-\ntial risk of continuing it in later adulthood. According to\nCauffman and Skeem (n.d.), juvenile acts sometimes are a\nreflection of psychopathic personality rather than simple\nacts of immaturity.\nIt has been argued that adolescence is the period where\nchanges in developmental maturity have negative relation-\nship with psychopathy (Cauffman & Skeem, n.d.).\nAccording to Rubio, Krieger, Finney, and Coker (2014),\ndetermining juvenile psychopathy has both clinical and\ncriminal justice applications, and finding out the underly-\ning causes might be helpful in understanding the phenom-\nenon. The current study focused on the assessment of\npsychopathy among Pakistani-imprisoned youth. The fol-\nlowing hypotheses were proposed on the basis of literature\nreview.\nObjective\nTo measure the level of psychopathic tendencies among\nyouth\nTo measure the difference between criminal and non-\ncriminal youth with reference to psychopathy\nTo measure the difference in level of psychopathic ten-\ndencies on the basis of gender\nHypotheses\nHypothesis 1: Criminals have high inclination for psy-\nchopathic tendencies as compared with non-criminals.\nHypothesis 2: Males have higher levels of psychopathic\ntendencies as compared with females.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants for the current study were taken from three dis-\ntricts of Pakistan: Abbottabad, Mansehra, and Haripur. The\nsample comprised two groups: adolescent criminals and non-\ncriminals. A total sample of 200 individuals was taken from\nthree districts. Criminals were taken from the prisons and\npolice stations present in Haripur and Mansehra districts,\nwith the individuals between 17 and 24 years of age and hav-\ning been convicted for crimes.\nDil and Kazmi 3\nInstrument\nAn indigenously developed scale in Urdu language compris-\ning 70 items was used. The items were rated on a 5-point\nLikert-type scale, with responses ranging from strongly\nagree to strongly disagree. Items were rated 5 for strongly\nagree, 4 for agree, 3 for uncertain, 2 for disagree, and 1 for\nstrongly disagree and so forth.\nAn item pool was generated based on the available con-\nstruct definitions of the psychopathy (see, for example,\nDecuyper, De Pauw, De Fruyt, De Bolle, & De Clercq, 2009;\nProcedure\nThe 70-item scale was constructed based on the available lit-\nerature. Scale items were assessed by a panel of experts, two\nPhD and a PhD scholar for face validity. The scale was pilot\ntested on a sample of 20.\nThe main study was conducted on a sample of 180 indi-\nviduals. To conduct the study in prison, permission was\nobtained from the respective authorities prior to study.\nParticipants were approached individually, and after a brief\nintroduction of the research, their verbal consent was\nobtained for the study. After obtaining informed consent,\nthey were given questionnaires to complete. Filled question-\nnaires were collected the same day, and participants were\nthanked for their participation.\nResults\nThe collected data were statistically analyzed to test the\nhypothesis. Alpha reliability of the scale was determined to\ncheck the internal consistency of the scores ( = .90). The t\ntest was used to check the differences among gender and\ncriminal status.\nTable 2 reveals that there is a significant difference in the\nlevel of psychopathy among criminals and non-criminals.\nThe results in Table 3 show that there is a significant dif-\nference in the psychopathy level of males and females, indi-\ncating that males scored significantly higher as compared\nwith the females.\nDiscussion\nRecent interest in the study of the psychopathic profile of\nincarcerated and normal individuals, implications of the\nassessment procedures to criminal justice systems, and\nscreening individuals for their violent acts has gained\nmomentum. The present study is aimed at assessing the\npresence of psychopathic inclination among youth. Major\nobjective of the research was to check the difference in the\nlevel of psychopathy among criminal and non-criminal\nyouth. The demographic characteristics of the participants\nare shown in table 1. It was hypothesized that criminals\nwould score higher on psychopathy questionnaire. The result\nconfirmed the hypothesis, and criminal youth significantly\ndiffered from youth who were never convicted or accused of\nany crime. The results of the study are consistent with those\nof the previous studies. Porter et al. (2001) found that indi-\nviduals scoring high on psychopathic measures committed\nmore crimes as compared with low scoring individuals.\nHemphill et al. (1998) reported that psychopaths are at\nincreased risk of committing crimes. Salekin, Rogers, and\nSewell (1996) stated that imprisoned individuals have higher\nrates of psychopathy and are more likely to commit criminal\nviolence and recidivism. They also stated that both criminal\nviolence and recidivism can be predicted by psychopathic\nscores. de P\u00e1dua Serafim, de Barros, Bonini Castellana, and\nGorenstein (2014) investigated the differences among psy-\nchopathic scores of the psychopathic murderers, non-psy-\nchopathic murderers, and non-criminals. The results showed\nthat non-criminals scored lower as compared with both\ngroups of criminals.\nThe present study was also aimed at finding the difference\nin the level of psychopathy across gender. The results show\nthat males scored significantly higher as compared with the\nfemales; that is, the score for males on psychopathic measure\nThe present research findings are consistent with those of pre-\nvious research. Essau, Sasagawa, and Frick (2006) reported\nthat females score less on dimensions of psychopathy as com-\npared with males. Similar findings were reported by Frick\net al. (2003). According to them, boys had a higher score on\ncallous unemotional dimension of psychopathy as compared\nwith the girls having committed more delinquent acts.\nTable 1. Demographic Characteristics of the Sample.\nCharacteristic f (%)\nGender\nCrime record\nGender-wise crime\nSES\nNote. SES = socioeconomic status.\n4 SAGE Open\nFrick, Bodin, and Barry (2000) also studied the impul-\nsiveness and unemotional dimension of psychopathy, and\nfound that girls scored significantly lower as compared with\nfemales. The results of the present study are also similar to\nthose of Cale and Lilienfeld (2002) who found that the mean\nlevel of psychopathy in men is higher as compared with the\nwomen. Vitale and Newman (2001) pointed out that females'\nscores on psychopathic measure were significantly different\nfrom males'. They tend to score lower as compared with\nmales. According to Dotterer (2014) males scored higher on\ntotal psychopathy and sub facet scores as compared with\nfemales.\nThe present study is among few indigenous studies that\nfocused on the psychopathic traits among Pakistani (see, for\nexample, Jhatial, Jariko, Tahrani, & Jam, 2013; Kausar et al.,\n2012). The importance of assessing psychopathy and its\nearly identification is really vital.As research evidences have\nshown that interventions used at earlier age such as using\ndecompression model or using increased relationship bond\nwith peers and parents, are helpful in treating psychopathy\n(e.g., Edwards, 2015). Developing such an approach in\nPakistan especially in juvenile justice system and introduc-\ning it in facilities such as Remand Homes, Industrial and\nReform Schools can assist the society in a more productive\nway.\nLimitations\nLike other research, this research has some limitations.Afew\nof them are identified during the course of research:\n1. The study is conducted on a smaller area, and only\nthree cities of Pakistan, Abbottabad, Haripur, and\nMansehra were taken.\n2. It was observed that the public view of the crimes\ndiffers. Focus group studies are needed to assess\nwhat individuals think about committing crimes and\nbeing criminals. What indices of psychopathy may be\nused to assess the level among masses?\n3. The data were mainly collected from youth. A more\nvaried sample is needed to assess the level of psy-\nchopathy among normal population.\nImplications of Study\nThe study was conducted to investigate the difference in the\npsychopathic level of criminal and non-criminal youth. The\nconstruct of psychopathy is so important that various crimi-\nnal offenses and use of instrumental aggression by psycho-\npaths demand attention. Psychopaths among normal\nindividuals are also needed to be assessed and treated. The\nstudy has implications in the criminal justice system and psy-\nchoeducation, providing an insight to clinicians and educa-\ntionists about the construct.\nConclusion\nThe aim of the study was to assess the level of psychopathy\namong youth. The study focused on measuring the difference\nin the level of psychopathy among criminal and non-criminal\nyouth. It also focused on the gender differences with refer-\nence to psychopathy. The sample was taken from three dis-\ntricts of the Hazara division. The total sample was 200 youth\nindigenously developed Urdu Psychopathy scale. The scale\nconsisted of 70 items, and the reliability for the scale was\n.90. The results confirmed our hypothesis that criminals\nshowed higher rates of psychopathy. Similarly, males exhib-\nited more psychopathic traits as compared with females.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnjum, S.
