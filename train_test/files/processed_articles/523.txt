We examined data from primary care visits in\nvey (NAMCS), a nationally representative survey of non-\nhospital-based ambulatory visits administered by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).4 In a recent\narticle, we examined visits to NAMCS physicians who\nanswered questions about EHRs and electronic guideline-\nbased reminders.2 Primary care visits for patients older\nthan 20 years with a recorded systolic and diastolic BP\nwere included, regardless of whether hypertension was\nindicated as a diagnosis code, reason for visit, or chronic\ncondition. We used the race/ethnicity categories and im-\nputed values provided by the NCHS.4 In the prior analy-\nsis, we controlled for race/ethnicity but did not examine\nwhether the effect of EHR and/or CDS on BP control dif-\nfered across racial/ethnic groups.2\nWe report herein disparities in BP control as weighted\npercentages of visits with BP lower than 140/90 mm Hg.\nWe stratified visits according to patient race/ethnicity and\nphysician use of EHRs and/or CDS. We compared BP con-\ntrol rates for minority patients and white patients whose\nphysicians were using similar technology. We fit a lo-\ngistic regression within each strata, controlling for pa-\ntient age, sex, diabetes, insurance type, and practice\nownership. We conducted a secondary analysis for the\none-third of patients with a known diagnosis of hyper-\ntension. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS-\ncallable SUDAAN software (SAS version 9.2 [SAS Insti-\ntute Inc] and SUDAAN version 10.0 [RTI International]).\nResults. We based our analyses on 17 016 visits, repre-\nsenting (weighted) 682 million visits nationally. Pa-\nhad diabetes, 34% had hypertension, 64% were non-\nHispanic white, 14% were non-Hispanic black, and 15%\nwere Hispanic. Overall, 71% of non-Hispanic black pa-\ntients had BP control compared with 76% for both His-\npanic and non-Hispanic white patients (P.001) after\ncontrolling for patient characteristics and practice own-\nership. Adjusted analyses limited to the known hyper-\ntensive subgroup showed similar differences in rates of\nBP control between non-Hispanic black (53% of visits)\nand non-Hispanic white patients (60% of visits) (P=.004).\nFifteen percent of visits were made to physicians using\nonly EHRs, 27% to physicians using both EHRs and CDS,\nand48%tophysiciansusingneither.Infullyadjustedanaly-\nses stratified by EHR and CDS use, we found improved\nBP control for all racial/ethnic groups among patients re-\nceiving care from health care providers using both EHRs\nand CDS (Figure). Significant differences in rates of BP\ncontrol between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic\nwhite patients persisted in only 1 category, the visits where\nphysicians used neither EHRs nor CDS (69% vs 75%;\nP.001). However, among patients receiving care from\nphysicians using both EHRs and CDS, Hispanic patients\nwere significantly more likely to have BP control (85%)\ncompared with non-Hispanic whites (78%) (P=.001). In\nananalysislimitedtopatientswithhypertension,thesepat-\nterns persisted; however, the Hispanic vs non-Hispanic\nwhite difference was not statistically significant.\nComment.

However, there is no\ndisparity between white and black patients whose physi-\nciansuseEHRswithCDS.Furthermore,wefoundthatHis-\npanic patients had the greatest change in BP control rates\nwhen their physicians use EHRs with CDS.\nOur findings are subject to type II error because we are\ninterpreting the lack of a statistical difference between\ngroups as evidence that there is no disparity in BP control\natapopulationlevel.However,ouranalysisisbasedonthou-\nsands of sampled visits in each EHR use category.

We used data from DocStyles, a Web-based survey\nof health care providers. Participants included health care\nproviders who practiced in the United States; worked in\nan individual, group, or hospital setting; and had prac-\nticed medicine for a minimum of 3 years. In 2010, family/\ngeneral practitioners (FGPs), internists, and nurse prac-\ntitioners were asked questions on sodium. Response rates\nfor nurse practitioners.\nThe sodium intake component of this survey con-\nsisted of 6 questions assessing health care providers' opin-\nions and perceived counseling behaviors related to\nreducing dietary sodium intake. The survey also in-\ncluded questions about health care provider character-\nistics, including sociodemographic (age, sex, and race/\nethnicity), medical practice (type of practitioner, practice\nsetting, years of practice, whether they practice at a teach-\ning hospital, and the financial situation of the majority\nof their patients), and health-related behavior (self-\nPredicted Proportion, %\nWhite\nAA\nHispanic\nWithout EHR\nor CDS\nWith EHR\nBut No CDS\nBoth EHR\nand CDS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nFigure.
