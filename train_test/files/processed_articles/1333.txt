Heart disease is also the most\nfrequent cause of death among persons with diabetes (3, 4).\nA national study, however, found that heart disease mortality\namong men declined 36 percent among those without\ndiabetes and only 13 percent among those who had diabetes\n(5). For women without diabetes, there was a decline in heart\ndisease mortality of 27 percent, while for those with diabetes\na nonsignificant increase of 23 percent was reported (5).\nIn the general population, reductions in serum cholesterol,\nblood pressure, and cigarette smoking may partly explain the\ndecline in heart disease mortality (1, 6, 7). Among persons\nwith diabetes, however, data on the national prevalence of\nthese major risk factors for cardiovascular disease are scarce.\nThus, we assembled data from the National Health and\nallowing us to examine whether cardiovascular disease risk\nfactors have improved in people with diabetes.\nReprint requests to Dr. Giuseppina Imperatore, Division of Diabetes Translation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford\nDesign and data collection\nThe NHANES is a nationally representative survey using\na stratified multistage probability design to sample the US\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population. Weights are\nassigned to reflect the probability of being sampled, adjusted\nfor oversampling, noncoverage, and nonresponse (8\u00ad13).\nThe study received human subject approval, and the partici-\npants were asked to sign an informed consent form.\nMeasures\nEach NHANES consists of a detailed standardized\nmedical examination in a mobile examination center and an\ninterview to obtain information on sociodemographic vari-\nables. Weight and height are measured with standardized\ntechniques and equipment in the mobile examination center\nand used to compute body mass index (kg/m2). For this anal-\nysis, participants were categorized as White or Black for\nNHANES I and NHANES II and as non-Hispanic White,\nnon-Hispanic Black, or Mexican American for NHANES III\nincluded in the White category. We excluded persons aged\nmore than 74 years because persons in that age group were\nnot sampled in the first two surveys. The response rates\npercent, respectively.\nDiagnosed diabetes was defined as a positive response to\nthe question, \"Have you ever been told by a doctor that you\nhave diabetes or sugar diabetes?\" In the NHANES III and\nnosed only during pregnancy were not considered to have\ndiabetes; this information was not available for the earlier\ntwo surveys. Three cardiovascular disease risk factors were\nanalyzed: serum total cholesterol concentration, systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure, and smoking status.\nCholesterol measurement\nFor the first three surveys, a detailed description of the\nprocedures used for blood sample collection and measure-\nment of total cholesterol has been published (14). For\nmeasurement of total cholesterol is provided in the NHANES\nLaboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (12).\nThe samples were frozen at \u00ad20\u00b0C and shipped weekly on\ndry ice to the laboratory conducting the lipid analyses. The\nNHANES I measurements were made in the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention lipid standardization labora-\ntory (15). The NHANES II, NHANES III, and NHANES\ntories of lipid research clinics that were standardized for\ncholesterol measurements using the criteria of the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention-National Heart, Lung,\nand Blood Institute Lipid Standardization Program (16\u00ad20).\nIn all surveys, serum total cholesterol was measured regard-\nless of fasting status. Missing data for total cholesterol\nranged from 11 percent to 1 percent. We defined high total\ncholesterol concentrations as serum total cholesterol of 5.17\nmmol/liter or more (200 mg/dl), regardless of use of lipid-\nlowering medications.\nBlood pressure measurement\nAs described previously (21), differences in protocol\nacross the four surveys included the number of blood pres-\nsure measurements, the temporal sequence of blood pressure\nmeasurements within the entire examination, types of staff\nwho performed the measurements, whether blood pressure\nwas measured in both the seated and supine positions, and\nwhether blood pressure measurements were performed in the\nhome in addition to the mobile examination center. In our\nanalysis, we used only blood pressure measurements\nconducted in the mobile examination center with subjects in\na seated position. When more than one blood pressure\nmeasurement was available, we calculated a mean blood\npressure. Our estimates of mean blood pressure are based on\nup to two blood pressure measurements for NHANES I and\nNHANES II, up to three blood pressure measurements in\nNHANES III, and up to four blood pressure measurements in\nhigh blood pressure changed across the years of the surveys\nlevels as a mean systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or\nmore and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more\nregardless of self-reported history of hypertension and use of\nantihypertensive drugs.\nSmoking behaviors\nTo determine current cigarette smoking, we asked respon-\ndents the questions, \"Have you smoked at least 100 ciga-\nrettes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you smoke cigarettes\nnow?\". Current smoking was defined by a positive answer to\nboth questions. In NHANES I, data on smoking behaviors\nwere collected for a sample of adults aged 25\u00ad74 years. For\nthis reason, we restricted the analysis of smoking to the\ngroup aged 25\u00ad74 years for all four surveys. Missing data\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses used SAS for Windows software (25)\nfor data management, SUDAAN software (26) to obtain\npoint estimates and standard errors, and WinBUGS software\n(27) to fit models. Sampling weights were used to produce\nnational estimates that accounted for the complex survey\ndesign. For comparisons across surveys, data were age\nadjusted by the direct method to population totals from the\nTrends in the age-adjusted estimates of cardiovascular\ndisease risk factors were assessed using a normal hierar-\nchical Bayesian model with noninformative prior distribu-\ntions on model hyperparameters (28). A Bayesian approach\nto modeling was preferred because inference does not\ndepend on asymptotic assumptions. In addition to\naccounting for variability within survey measurements,\nBayesian hierarchical models account for variability\nCardiovascular Risk Factor Trends in Adults with Diabetes 533\nbetween surveys. Variability between surveys, such as meth-\nodological changes, is accounted for by incorporating\nrandom effect parameters into the model.\nOur model has two levels. At the first level, we specify a\nprobability distribution for the observed data. Letting\ndenote the estimate for a cardiovascular disease risk factor\ndetermined from survey i and \ni\n2 denote the variance for\nestimated from SUDAAN software, we assume\nThe survey means \ni\nare assumed to arise from a linear\nmodel\n\ni\n=  + (ti\n) + Zi\n,\nwhere ti\nrepresents the midpoint year of survey i,  repre-\nsents the mean value of the risk factor from the first survey\n(intercept), and  represents the annual change in the risk\nfactor over time. The random effect Zi\nrepresents the vari-\nability in \ni\nremaining after accounting for the linear trend,\nand it is assumed to be distributed N(0, 2).\nAt the second level of our model, we assign probability\ndistributions to each hyperparameter (, , ). Normal priors\nprobabilities specified at the second level with the proba-\nbility distribution for the observed data specified at the first\nlevel, we express knowledge about model parameters\nthrough the posterior distribution derived using Bayes'\ntheorem. Random draws from this posterior distribution are\ngenerated through an iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo\nsimulation known as the Gibbs sampler.\nWe simultaneously ran three Gibbs samplers and saved\ngence was assessed visually by inspecting trace plots of\nsampled values versus iteration number and inspecting the\nGelman-Rubin statistic for each iteration. We used the mean\nof the posterior distribution of  as our point estimate.\nSignificant decreases in cardiovascular disease risk factors\nwere defined by 95 percent Bayesian credible intervals for \nthat did not contain zero. In addition, we estimated the prob-\nability that  is negative. A significant decrease was defined\nas a probability greater than 97.5 percent. Because there is\nparticular interest in recent declines in the prevalence of\ncardiovascular disease risk factors, we also obtained the\nBayesian estimate for the probability of a decrease between\nthe two most recent surveys (NHANES III and NHANES\nfit for the overall population, men, women, and persons aged\nRESULTS\nThe characteristics of adults with diabetes are presented in\ntable 1.

Taken as a whole, these findings are\nencouraging, as successful control of these risk factors has\nbeen associated with considerable reductions in the cardio-\nvascular and microvascular complications of diabetes (3,\nRecent data for the US general population have indicated a\nreduction in the temporal declines in mean cholesterol\nconcentrations for both men and women (32, 33).

The overall improvement in recent years may\nreflect the aggressive promotion of lipid control in persons\nwith diabetes, following the results of clinical trials of lipid-\nlowering drugs published in the 1990s and the effort of the\nTABLE 4.

Our results underscore the need to\nenforce current recommendations to consider diabetes a risk\nfactor for heart disease and to aggressively treat lipid abnor-\nmalities in people who have diabetes. We note that, even if\nthe decline in the proportion of adults with diabetes having\nhigh total cholesterol levels would continue at 0.6\npercentage point per year (the annual decrease we found for\nthe entire study period), 49 percent of people with diabetes\nwill still have high cholesterol levels in 2010.\nFindings from randomized trials have demonstrated the\nbenefits of tight blood pressure control to protect against\nrenal disease and cardiovascular events in patients with\ndiabetes (30, 39, 40). For this reason, more stringent criteria\nfor blood pressure control have been suggested for this group\n(24, 41). Even so, we found that the proportion of persons\nwith blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg did not decrease\nsubstantial proportion of US adults with diabetes still had a\nblood pressure measurement above 140/90 mmHg. More\nrecently, the recommended blood pressure for people with\nbasis of this new criterion, an even greater proportion of\npersons with diabetes will be candidates for intervention.\nThe favorable changes in the major cardiovascular disease\nrisk factors among adults with diabetes have occurred along-\nside a dramatic increase in mean body mass index. Like\ndiabetes, obesity is associated with insulin resistance, hyper-\ntension, lipid abnormalities (42), and cardiovascular disease\nmortality (43). Thus, one would have expected results the\nopposite of what we obtained. It is possible that the shift in\nbody mass index reflects an increase in detecting undiag-\nnosed diabetes, because people are at an earlier stage and\nhave less severe disease. Similarly, changes in the diagnostic\ncriteria for diabetes in the most recent years and increased\nscreening may help to identify individuals with a less severe\nform of the disease, who would likely have a better cardio-\nvascular disease risk profile. If true, this could in part explain\nthe downward trend in risk factors.\nDespite the favorable trends in the three major risk factors\nfor cardiovascular disease, a national study found that heart\ndisease mortality had declined to a lesser degree among\nadults with diabetes than in the US general population (5).\nThere are a few potential explanations for this. First, many\nrisk factors other than the three we studied are associated\nwith cardiovascular disease mortality in people with\ndiabetes. For example, low high-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol, high triglycerides, abnormal low density lipoprotein\nparticle size, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, coagu-\nlation abnormalities, inflammation, and physical inactivity\nall can increase susceptibility to atherosclerosis in diabetes\n(44). Second, it may require additional time before a decline\nin cardiovascular disease risk factors is reflected in changes\nin cardiovascular disease mortality. Finally, people with\ndiabetes may derive less benefit from the medical treatment\nof cardiovascular disease. For example, they experience\nworse outcomes of coronary revascularization than do\npersons without diabetes (45) and have an adverse long-term\nprognosis after myocardial infarction (46). Moreover,\namong patients with coronary artery disease, those with\ndiabetes are less often tested or treated for dislipidemia (47).\nOur study had some limitations. First, the sample size of\npeople with diabetes, especially in the most recent survey,\nlimited the number of stratified subgroup analyses that we\ncould conduct. Second, differences in participation rates by\nrace/ethnicity may have varied over time, which may have\ninfluenced the findings. We were unable to examine this in\nour analyses, because of the fact that the number of people\nwith diabetes and non-White race was too small to provide\nreliable or meaningful inferences and because information\non race/ethnicity was not collected uniformly across the four\nsurveys. However, we conducted follow-up sensitivity anal-\nyses in which we estimated cardiovascular disease risk factor\nlevels across the four surveys only in non-White partici-\npants. We found that trends among non-Whites were of\nsimilar magnitude to that observed in the overall sample, but\nthe standard errors were very large because of the small\nsample size. Third, given the lack of data from the earliest\nsurvey, we could not assess temporal trends in high density\nlipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol,\nand triglycerides. Fourth, some of the methodological\nchanges that occurred across the four surveys may have\ninfluenced our estimates, especially for blood pressure\nlevels. Our choice of analytical approach reduces the effect\nof these changes on our estimates; thus, we believe that most\nof the observed decline in cardiovascular disease risk factors\nis real.\ndisease risk factors among people with diabetes declined.\nThe biggest declines were among men and older people.\nAlthough we have strong evidence that control of blood\npressure, lipids, and smoking can reduce cardiovascular\ndisease mortality among people with diabetes, one of two\npeople with diabetes still has a total cholesterol concentra-\ntion above the recommended targets, one of three has high\nblood pressure, and one of six is a smoker. Considerable\nopportunity to tackle cardiovascular disease risk in people\nwith diabetes still exists.\nREFERENCES\n1. Kuulasmaa K, Tunstall-Pedoe H, Dobson A, et al.
