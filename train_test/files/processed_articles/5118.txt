We\nmeasured this ``spinner'' effect with radial sinusoidal gratings, using a 2AFC procedure where\nparticipants selected the faster one between two briefly presented gratings of different spatial\nfrequencies (SFs) rotating at various angular speeds. Compared with the reference stimulus with\n4 c/rev (0.64 c/rad), participants consistently overestimated the angular speed for test stimuli of\nhigher radial SFs but underestimated that for a test stimulus of lower radial SFs. The spinner effect\nincreased in magnitude but saturated rapidly as the test radial SF increased. Similar effects were\nobserved with translating linear sinusoidal gratings of different SFs. Our results support the idea\nthat human speed perception is biased by temporal frequency, which physically goes up as SF\nincreases when the speed is held constant. Hence, the more dots or lines, the greater the\nperceived speed when they are moving coherently in a defined area.\n",

One possible factor limiting\nour understanding of speed perception and vision in general is the inverse projection problem\n(Palmer, 1999). This problem arises because an infinite number of distal environmental\nobjects with different shapes and sizes seen in the three-dimensional (3D) world can cast\nthe same two-dimensional (2D) optical image onto the retina, introducing ambiguities\ndifficult to solve. A moving distal environmental object further extends the inverse\nprojection problem into the time domain and possibly introduces more uncertainty and\ninaccuracy for the visual system in processing visual motion information. Since the claims\nthat the human visual system analyses complex visual images by their spatial frequency (SF)\ncontent like a Fourier analyzer (Campbell & Robson, 1968; Sachs, Nachmias, & Robson,\n1971), researchers have been using sinusoidal gratings extensively to study human vision. The\nspeed of a moving stimulus used in researches is consequently expressed in terms of its spatial\nand temporal frequencies, and is susceptible to biases from other stimulus properties such as\nits luminance contrast (Thompson, Brooks, & Hammett, 2006; Thompson, 1982) and colour\nA counterintuitive bias in speed perception was recently demonstrated by Ho and Anstis\n(2013) in the 2013 Best Illusion of the Year contest. They later redesigned it as ``the spinner\nillusion'' using simpler disk elements, as shown in Figure 1 (see also Appendix Movie 1). The\nfour yellow dots on the left and the eight yellow dots on the right were both set to revolve at\nthe same rate, yet all observers consistently reported seeing the dots on the right as rotating\nfaster than those on the left. In the demonstration video, the number of dots on the right\nincreases from 4 to 8 and then 12, with the rotation seeming faster with each increase.\nThe spinner illusion is interesting because there is no obvious reason in physics why\nincreasing the number of dots should increase their apparent speed, assuming that all the\ndots are clearly visible. Ho and Anstis (2013) originally suggested that the greater retinal blur\ncaused by more dots might make them look faster. While it is known that motion streaks can\nenhance motion perception (Apthorp et al., 2013; Geisler, 1999), their influence on speed\nFigure 1. The spinner illusion. The four and eight yellow dots revolve around the blue disks at the same\nphysical speed (top), but the perceived speed appears to be faster with eight dots than with four dots\n(bottom). Arrow lengths symbolize speeds. The blue disks were not included in the original illusion work, but\nare shown here for illustration purposes.\n2 i-Perception\nperception has not been established. We therefore measured the spinner effect with sine wave\ngrating stimuli that are smooth and less susceptible to smearing.\nAn alternative account would treat this illusion as a partial failure to compute speed from\nthe temporal frequency (TF) and SF of the stimulus. While local speed is obtained by local\nTF divided by SF in theory, this computation might be performed only in an approximate\nway. It has been reported that perceived speed of translating one-dimensional (1D) sinusoidal\ngratings depends on their SF. Campbell and Maffei (1981) studied rotating 1D gratings and\nfound that their perceived speed followed an inverted-U function of spatial frequency.\nDiener, Wist, Dichgans, and Brandt (1976) reported increased perceived speed at higher\nSFs measured by magnitude estimation, a finding that was later echoed by Chen, Bedell,\nresults that both perceived speed and TF decreased as the SF increased, but they pointed out\nthat the results may depend on the range of SFs used.\nIn the spinner illusion (Figure 1), SF along the circular path of motion increases as the\nnumber, and thus density, of dots increases. Possibly this illusion directly reflects the\nspatiotemporal characteristics of the visual system as described earlier. If so, one extreme\npossibility would be that speed judgments of rotating stimuli are made on the basis of local\nTF, ignoring the SF. Or they might be made as a compromise between the speed and TF of a\nrotating stimulus. The results in the literature are not conclusive. One problem is that it is not\nstraightforward to apply results from the linear gratings to the configuration of a rotating\nspinner illusion. We first need to confirm that simple sinusoidal patterns give similar illusions,\nand then to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of the illusion parametrically.\nWe therefore investigated the effect of SF on the spinner illusion in radial gratings\n(Figure 2). First, we confirmed that the spinner illusion occurs with simple radial\nsinusoidal gratings for nai\u00a8ve participants (Experiment 1). Sinusoidal modulation is also\neffective in minimizing the effect of blur, as image blur does not yield motion streaks but\nonly reduces the effective contrast. Second, we examined whether the illusion depends more\non speed itself or TF, by taking more detailed measurements from trained participants\n(Experiment 2). Finally, we confirmed that a similar illusion occurs for translational\nmotion of one-dimensional gratings (Experiment 3). We will then discuss the cause of this\nillusion in terms of general spatiotemporal integration.\nExperiment 1\nThe point of subjective equality (PSE) in perceived speed for two simultaneously presented\nrotating radial sinusoidal gratings of different radial spatial frequencies (RSFs) was assessed\npsychophysically using a method of constant stimuli. Specifically, the rotating speed of the\nmatching stimulus (RSF of 4 c/rev: cycle per revolution1) was varied randomly between trials\nand was compared with that of the test stimulus (RSF of either 8, 10, or 12 c/rev; used\nuniquely in separate experimental blocks) that was kept constant at 0.33 rev/s, in order to\nobtain psychometric functions for the estimation of their PSEs. We expected the resulting\nPSE to be higher than the veridical speed of the test stimuli (0.33 rev/s) if the spinner effect\noccurred.\nMethods\nParticipants. Eight psychology undergraduate students (6 females and 2 males, aged 19\u00ad22)\nin Kyoto University participated to fulfill partial requirement of a course. They were nai\u00a8ve\nAshida et al. 3\nas to the specific purpose of the experiment, although they had seen a demonstration\nof the spinner illusion prior to the experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nApparatus and stimuli. Stimuli were generated and presented by using PsychToolBox 3\nThey were presented on one of the three monitors: two 24-inch (BenQ XL2411) and\nrate, driven by PCs running Microsoft Windows 7. Participants rested their heads\ncomfortably on a chin rest during experiment with a viewing distance at 50 cm. The\nmean luminance was 40 cd/m2 for one BenQ and 100 cd/m2 for the others. The\nluminance profile of each screen was measured and was linearized using a photometer\n(Minolta LM1).\nThe basic stimulus configuration is shown in Figure 2 (see also Appendix Movie 2). Two\nradial gratings, each presented inside a ring-shaped window subtending a visual angle of 8.8,\nwere centered 5.5 laterally on each side of the central red fixation mark. The width of the\nrings was 2.2. The two yoked stimuli always appeared and disappeared on the screen\nsimultaneously. They had a sluggish temporal envelope: Their luminance contrast was\ndecreased linearly back to 0% in 0.25 s. The two stimuli rotated in the same direction in\neach trial, and both directions were tested within each block of trials.\nThe RSF for the matching stimulus was 4 c/rev (0.64 c/rad), while the RSF of the test\nand stayed constant within each block of trials.\nFigure 2. The basic stimulus configuration. Left: matching stimulus of 4 c/rev, Right: test stimulus of 12 c/rev\nas an example. Both stimuli rotated in the same direction. The test and matching sides as well as their yoked\ndirection of rotation were randomized and balanced across trials. In Experiment 1: a \u00bc 2.2, b \u00bc 8.8, and\n4 i-Perception\nThe speed for the test stimulus was fixed at 0.33 rev/s (2.09 rad/s) and the speed for the\nmatching stimulus was picked randomly from seven preset values between 0.17 and 0.67 rev/s\nProcedure\nThe method of constant stimuli was used to present a yoked test-matching stimulus pair on\neach trial. The participants judged whether the radial grating inside the left or the right\nannulus window appeared faster in a 2AFC procedure and responded by pressing one of\ntwo designated computer keys.\nTrials were organized in blocks by the three test RSFs. One block consisted of 28 trials\n(7 manipulated speeds \u00c2 2 sides \u00c2 2 rotation directions), and each block was repeated four\ntimes in a pseudorandom order, resulting in 16 measurements per manipulated matching\nspeed. The computer programme randomized the manipulated speed variations, direction of\nstimulus-pair rotation, and the presentation sides of test-matching stimuli.\nResults and Discussion\nProbit analysis (Finney, 1971; with the scripts by Johnson, Dahlgren, Siegfried, & Ellis, 2013)\nwas used to estimate each participant's PSE in perceived speed for each test RSF. The results\nwere collapsed across presentation sides of stimuli and their rotation directions. Figure 3(a)\nshows the averaged psychometric functions from all participants, and Figure 3(b) shows\nestimated PSE values for all test-matching paired stimuli. It is evident from the data that\nMatched Speed (rev/s)\nRadial Spatial Frequency (c/rev)\nmain\nmirrored\n(a) (b)\n% Matching stimulus was faster\nMatching Speed (rev/s)\nFigure 3. The results of experiment 1: (a) pooled psychometric functions from all the participants. The\nspeed of the 4 c/rev matching stimuli needed to be increased from 0.33 rev/s to match the speed of 8 to\n16 c/rev test stimuli (arrow). (b) The averaged PSE values (matched speeds) across participants, plotted as a\nfunction of RSF with 95% confidence intervals. The dashed straight line in each panel shows the actual speed\nof the test stimuli. (b) The filled symbols represent the main results, while the open symbols represent the\nauxiliary results with the speed of the higher SF stimuli manipulated; they are above and below the actual\nspeed line in about the same distances in the log scale, so the two results agree quantitatively as to the\namount of speed overestimation. The shifts of the psychometric functions (a) and thus the shifts of the\nmatching speed (b) are all consistent with speed overestimation for higher RSFs.\nAshida et al. 5\nthe speed of the matching stimulus needed to be turned up beyond the test speed of 0.33 rev/s\nto match the perceived speeds of the test stimuli. In other words, the speed of a higher RSF\ntest stimulus was consistently overestimated by the participants, which agreed with the\noriginal spinner illusion observation.\nSpecifically, the participants required the 4 c/rev matching stimulus to rotate 32% to 36%\nfaster than the actual speed of the high-RSF test stimuli in order to match the perceived\nspeeds. There was no significant difference in the matched speeds among the test stimuli of 8,\nThe speed overestimation of the test stimuli (>30%) here is similar to the report of 33%\nfor 8 versus 16 dot condition of the original spinner illusion (Anstis & Ho, 2014). It is,\nhowever, not consistent that our data from Experiment 1 did not reveal differences among\nthe three high-RSF tests. A possible factor might be compression of perceived speed in a\nhigher RSF range; tiny differences for higher RSFs may be buried in noise under the ceiling\neffect.\nWe therefore ran an auxiliary experiment with a different speed manipulation in a mirrored\nfashion where the speeds of the higher RSF stimuli (8, 12, 16 c/rev) were manipulated\nto match the apparent speed of the 4 c/rev reference stimulus. The reference speed used\nhere was the same as the test speed in the main experiment (0.33 rev/s \u00bc 2.09 rad/s).\nWe used the same set of apparatus, but used PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007) for\nstimulus generation and experimental control. The manipulated speed for the test\nstimulus was picked randomly from seven preset values between 0.17 and 0.47 rev/s\n(1.05\u00ad2.96 rad/s). Nine different nai\u00a8ve participants (2 females and 7 male psychology\nstudents, aged 19\u00ad22) participated to fulfill partial requirement of a course. Their results\nare shown in Figure 3(b) by open symbols. Similar to the findings from the main\nexperiment, no significant difference in the estimated PSE values was observed among the 8,\nParticipants required the speed of higher RSF test stimuli to be decreased to 72% to 76%\nof the actual 4 c/rev reference stimulus speed to perceptually match the perceived rotational\nspeed of the yoked stimulus pair. By taking the reciprocals of these PSE values, the\nresult corresponded to a speed overestimation of higher RSF stimuli by 31% to 39%, an\nobserved spinner effect which is quantitatively consistent with the main results of 33% to\n36% obtained in the main experiment. Thus, the results here mirrored those of the main\nexperiment, indicating that the flat results among the test RSFs is not an artefact of the\nceiling effect.\nWe then reasoned that the insignificant differences observed could possibly be due to a\nhigh level of internal noise from our nai\u00a8ve participants, lack of regression precision due to\nrough sampling of test speeds, or possible dependence of the effects upon the test speed. In\nExperiment 2, we therefore further assessed the spinner effect more extensively using trained\nparticipants with a staircase method while adopting a wider range of test RSFs in\ncombination with multiple test speeds as manipulated variables.\nExperiment 2\nParticipants\nOne of the authors and two psychophysically trained participants were tested (one female and\ntwo males, aged 22\u00ad47). The two participants other than the author were nai\u00a8ve as to the\nspecific purpose of this experiment, and were paid for their time at the university standard\nrate. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\n6 i-Perception\nApparatus and Stimuli\nThe stimuli were generated by using PsychoPy 1.82 (Peirce, 2007), running on an Apple\nresolution and 75 Hz refresh rate. The screen was viewed from the distance of 45 cm with\nthe aid of a chin rest. Luminance profile of the screen was measured and linearized with a\nphotometer (Photo Research PR-655).\nThe basic stimulus configuration was the same as in Experiment 1 but 25% larger in size;\nthe ring-shaped windows subtended 11, with the annulus subtending 2.75 in width\n(Figure 2). These two stimulus windows were centered laterally at an eccentricity of 6.9\non both sides of the central fixation mark. The time course of stimulus presentation was\nthe same, too: linear increase for 0.25 s, staying at 50% for 0.5 s, and linear decrease to zero\nThe RSF of the matching stimulus used here was again 4 c/rev (0.64 c/rad) as used in\nProcedure\nParticipants were given the same 2AFC discrimination task as described in Experiment 1,\njudging the faster stimulus. All participants were tested with 15 different test stimulus\nconditions (i.e., the five test RSFs \u00c2 three test speeds as stated earlier) to complete this\nexperiment. A staircase method (1-up and 1-down) with smaller preset step sizes was used\nfor capturing more precise changes in participants' responses around the PSE for each test\nstimulus.\nEach condition was tested in separate blocks of randomly interleaved double staircases\n(one staircase for one direction of motion). Each staircase was terminated after 28 trials\n(i.e., 56 trials per run with double staircases). Each block was repeated three times,\nbringing a grand total of 168 trials per stimulus condition.\nResults\nResponses were pooled for each test stimulus condition within individual participant. The\nperceived matched speed (PSE) for each test stimulus condition was estimated with 95%\nconfidence intervals using probit analysis (Finney, 1971; Johnson et al., 2013).\nFigure 4 shows the results for all three participants. Matched speeds (PSEs) of the\nmatching stimulus to the test stimuli are plotted as a function of RSF for each participant\nin separate panels. Since the 4 c/rev stimulus was used as the matching stimulus, we assumed\nthe veridical speed to be its perceived speed for each test speed level (marked by larger\nsymbols in Figure 4). The results look very similar across all three participants. Most of\nthe test stimuli of 8 c/rev RSF or greater required the matching speed to be set above the\ncorresponding actual test speed, demonstrating overestimated perceived speed of higher RSF\ntest stimuli as found in Experiment 1. On the other hand, the matching speeds for the 2 c/rev\ntest stimulus all fell below their veridical speed lines, revealing an underestimation of\nperceived speed for the lower RSF stimulus.\nAll the PSE curves fell within an area between the constant-TF and veridical test speed\nlines, and tended toward horizontal as the RSF of the test stimuli increased. These data reveal\nAshida et al. 7\nthat the participants made a compromise between the actual speed and the TF of the moving\nstimuli in making their speed judgments on the revolving stimuli. The response functions are\nalso very similar in trend across the three tested speed levels for all tested RSFs, with PSE\nvalues increasing as the RSF and the test speed increase. To compare the results across test\nspeeds, each participant's PSE data are normalized with the test speeds (i.e., divided by\ncorresponding test speed) and replotted in a log-log scale as presented in Figure 5(a). Note\nthat this normalized plot shows quadratic trends for all three test speeds; log-quadratic\nfunctions were fitted well to the averaged data across participants (r2 > .99). The three\ncurves nearly superimposed on each other except for the one obtained at the lowest test\nspeed (0.17 rev/s), where PSEs for the lowest and highest RSFs were much lower than\nthose for the faster test speeds. It is also noticed from the other two fitted curves that\nparticipants' overestimation on perceived speeds for the higher RSF test stimuli started to\nlevel off at 8 c/rev. There are only subtle differences in speed overestimation among the\nstimuli of 8 to 16 c/rev, confirming our earlier finding in Experiment 1. We also noticed\nthat the results from the three participants were quantitatively consistent except for data\npoints at either end of RSFs examined.\nFurthermore, from Figure 5(a), we see that perceived speed on the 2 c/rev stimulus lies\nmuch closer to the oblique TF line than the horizontal line, a characteristic that is opposite\nfor the higher RSF stimuli. This means that speed perception is more heavily weighted by TF\nat low RSFs but more by the actual stimulus speed at high RSFs. To quantify such changes in\nweighing on speed perception by the TF characteristics of a revolving stimulus, we evaluated\nthe contribution of TF by the following equation that can account for the matched speed as a\nweighted sum of the constant-TF speed and the stimulus' actual angular speed:\nm \u00bc b \u00c3 STF \u00fe 1 \u00c0 b\n\u00f0 \u00deS\nMatched Speed (rev/s)\nRadial Spatial Frequency (c/rev)\nconst.\nTF\nconst.\nspeed\nresults\nFigure 4. Results of Experiment 2 for all three participants in linear scales. PSE speeds are plotted as\na function of the test RSF for each test speed. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals. The larger data\nsymbols at 4 c/rev denote the matching stimulus itself where its own PSEs were not measured. Pale solid\nhorizontal lines depict the physical speeds of the three test stimuli, and the pale dashed lines depict the\nphysical speeds that give constant TFs (i.e., hypothetical lines of matched speeds if the perceived speeds\nof test stimuli were determined solely by the local TF characteristics.).\n8 i-Perception\nwhere m is the matched speed for a revolving stimulus, b is the TF-bias weighing factor, STF\nis\nthe constant-TF speed at each spatial frequency, and S is the veridical stimulus speed. TF\nwould have no effect with b \u00bc 0 and the strongest effect with b \u00bc 1. Figure 5(b) shows b (solid\nlines) and 1 \u00c0 b (dotted lines) as a function of the RSF, which were obtained by solving this\nequation for the averaged results in Figure 5(a) as m for each test speed. This plot reveals that\nthe TF weighting on speed perception falls almost linearly in a log scale as the RSF of a\nstimulus increases. Even though the speed overestimation effect increases for stimuli of higher\nRSFs, the effect of TF on speed perception is actually stronger for stimuli of lower RSFs.\nThis plot also indicates that the effect of TF is larger for a slower speed at the lowest RSF\ntested; the reason is not clear, but it could be an artefact of showing very thick stripes in\nnarrow rings.\nThe curves may be subject to change by the choice of the matching stimulus. An auxiliary\nexperiment performed by S1, however, suggested that such a nonlinear effect, if any, might\nnot be substantial at least for our stimulus set; the speed of the 8 c/rev stimulus was matched\nto that of the 16 c/rev stimulus by the same procedure, and the speed of 16 c/rev stimulus was\nS1 in Figure 4 increased by 11.5% from 8 c/rev to 16 c/rev, which falls within this confidence\ninterval.\nIn short, the spinner effect is observed with radial sinusoidal stimuli. Perceived speed\nof a test stimulus does increase with the RSF of the stimulus, weighted concomitantly\nby an increasing TF. But the magnitude of the spinner effect reaches a plateau relatively\nquickly at higher RSFs, indicating that the bias toward TF is actually smaller for\nhigher RSFs. Therefore, possible difference among 8 to 16 c/rev stimuli could be\n(a) (b)\nNormalised Speed\nRadial Spatial Frequency (c/rev)\nRadial Spatial Frequency (c/rev)\nconst. speed\nconst.

We can actually experience an analogous speed illusion in the\ndemonstration movie with translating linear gratings (Appendix Movie 3), as also predicted\nfrom previous reports (Chen et al., 1998; Diener et al., 1976). In Experiment 3, we therefore\nassessed if analogous characteristics of the spinner illusion would be found in drifting vertical\nsine wave gratings. The SFs of the 1D gratings used here were roughly matched to the SF of\nthe radial stimuli in Experiment 2.\nMethods\nParticipants. The same three participants as in Experiment 2 were tested.\nApparatus and stimuli. The apparatus was the same as in Experiment 2, also controlled with\nPsychoPy 1.82 (Peirce, 2007). The layout of the paired matching-test stimulus was similar to\nthat used in Experiment 2. Here, two 1D vertical sinusoidal grating of different SFs, always\ndrifting in the same direction, were presented inside two separate, 11 diameter circular\nwindows on both sides of the central fixation point. Their maximum luminance contrast\nwas 50%, presented to participants using the same trapezoidal time envelope as before.\nThe SFs were approximately matched to those of the radial gratings as follows;\nluminances were modulated horizontally in the frequencies of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 cycles per\nthe circumference of the middle point of the ring in Experiment 2 (i.e., along the circle of\nmatching stimulus was 0.15 c/deg, and that of the test stimulus was one of the other four SFs.\nA single standard speed of 8.64 deg/s (corresponding to 0.33 rev/s \u00bc 2.09 rad/s of the radial\ngrating at the middle radius of the ring) was tested.\nProcedure. The task and the design was the same as in Experiment 2; each test SF was tested\nseparately in a double-random-staircase run of 28 trials for each direction, and each run was\nrepeated three times in a random order.\nResults\nProbit analysis (Finney, 1971; Johnson et al., 2013) was used to estimate the matched speed at\n95% confidence intervals. Figure 6(a) shows the matched speed as a function of the test SF.\nAgain, the PSE values fell between the area bounded by speed with constant TF and the\nveridical base speed of the test stimuli as shown in Figure 5(a), indicating overestimations and\nunderestimations of perceived speed in higher and lower test SFs, respectively, when\ncompared with the 0.15 c/deg matching stimulus.\nCorresponding data from Experiment 2 were converted in the way as described in the\nApparatus and Stimuli section and were plotted together in Figure 6(a). The pattern of results\nis very similar to that of the radial stimuli, as the fitted log-quadratic function (r2 > .99) is\ncomparable to the adapted curve from Figure 5(a). While the overestimation was somewhat\nlarger for the linear gratings, this difference is surprisingly small, given many possible\nconfounds such as imperfect matching of SFs, different stimulus windows, or larger SF\nartefacts at the stimulus edges of linear gratings, which are inevitable for the different kinds of\nstimuli. This result suggests that the spinner illusion is a consequence of general speed\ncomputation from spatiotemporal frequencies, rather than manifestation of some\nidiosyncratic rotation-specific effects.\nFigure 6(b) depicts the TF weighting on perceived speeds of drifting gratings in the same\nway as in Figure 5(b) but as a function of linear SF. The data for the corresponding condition\nin Experiment 2 with radial gratings (standard speed of 0.33 rev/s) are adapted from\nFigure 5(b) and are plotted along in this figure. The decline of TF weighting is very\nsimilar for the two types of stimuli. The small difference in the slopes may be due to\nseveral factors as noted earlier.\nWe should also note that the shape of the curve is similar to that of speed matching by\nJogan and Stocker (2015; their Figure 5(b), test stimuli of A\u00adD), although they did not\ndiscuss this ``single-channel'' response in detail, because their focus was on integration of\nsuch responses in compound SF stimuli.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe spinner illusion demonstrates that perceived speed is affected by the number of dots even\nwhen they move at a constant speed. We have confirmed that this effect generalizes to radial\nand linear forms of sinusoidal gratings. The spinner illusion therefore is considered to reflect\na general speed overestimation for high SFs that has been reported in the literature. The effect\nof motion blur, if any, is not a necessary condition.\n(a) (b)\nMatched Speed (deg/s)\nSpatial Frequency (c/deg)\nconst.

TF should increase along with increasing SF in order to keep the\nspeed constant, and this higher TF could bias speed coding. Although we can make speed and\nTF judgments independently (Smith & Edgar, 1990, p. 1469), nai\u00a8ve judgments may be\nerroneously contaminated by the TF. This, however, does not seem to explain our\ncompelling perception of speed difference in the spinner illusion demonstrations. Also, the\nresults were consistent across nai\u00a8ve and trained participants in our experiments. The TF bias\ntherefore could be an innate property in speed perception.\nIt is conceived that the visual system initially takes separate measures in space and time\n(i.e., SF and TF), and then integrates these measures into the metric of speed at the level\nof V1 complex cells to the area MT/V5 both in macaques (Priebe, Cassanello, &\nLisberger, 2003; Priebe, Lisberger, & Movshon, 2006) and also in humans (Lingnau,\nAshida, Wall, & Smith, 2009). Integration across space and time is then required for\nperceiving global pattern of linear or circular motion (e.g., Morrone, Burr, & Vaina,\n1995). While the TF bias may arise at any of these stages, the results of similar spinner\neffects on circular and translating motions might suggest that it occurs before the stage of\nglobal integration.\nThe exact mechanism of the TF bias in speed perception is yet to be investigated, but our\nresults of stronger TF bias for lower SFs might be explained by hypothetical receptive fields\nthat are not large enough for the low-SF stimuli. The nominal SF of our stimuli extends\ndown to 0.08 c/deg, that is, 12.5 deg/c. This is larger than the human population receptive\nfield sizes, measured by using fMRI, in most visual areas including putative human MT and\nMST up to the eccentricity of 10 in the periphery (Amano, Wandell, & Dumoulin, 2009).\nAppendix Movie 4 shows a hypothetical receptive field that covers less than one cycle of a\nlow-SF drifting grating, which is therefore seen as mostly flickering with very little motion\nsignal. On the other hand, the same receptive field can register several moving bars of a high-\nSF grating, so the direction of motion is now unambiguous--and also looks fast. This simple\nmodel explains both the basic spinner effect, that fine bars appear to move faster than coarse\nbars, and also the fact that speed judgments of coarse moving bars are more strongly\nweighted by TF than by actual velocity.\nNote that the illusion could be understood in accordance with the gradient-based models\nUllman, 1981). In the case of sinusoidal modulation, because d/dt[sin(ft)] \u00bc fcos(ft),\nmaximum temporal gradient is proportional to TF. Speed perception could be understood\nas biased toward temporal gradient instead of TF.\nEcological Interpretations\nFor periodic grating patterns, SF (or RSF) is a reciprocal of the size of each bar. The spinner\neffect therefore parallels the classic report of Brown (1931) that ``other things being equal\nlarger figures are phenomenally slower'' (p. 222). It is, however, not fully understood why\nspeed perception depends on size. A possible account could refer to speed constancy across\ndistances; as an object comes closer, the retinal size and speed increase when the physical\nspeed is constant. While Brown (1931) argued that constancy of velocity (i.e., speed) is not\nfully deducible from size constancy, Rock, Hill, and Fineman (1968) concluded that size\nconstancy and speed constancy are indeed related, from the results of experiments without\nvisible frames of references.\nThe rotating spinner illusion is not readily explained by speed constancy because\nRSF does not change across distances. On the other hand, the two-dimensional SF\ncomponents along the x-y coordinates do change with distance for both linear or radial\ngratings, while TF remains constant. TF is therefore a more invariant measure than SF\nacross distances, which may be one reason for more dependence on TF in speed\ncomputations.\nOther possible explanations might refer to the statistical tendency that lower SFs are likely\nmore stable than higher SFs in the scene. This is related to the hypothesis of Bayesian prior\nfor slow motion (Jogan & Stocker, 2015; Vintch & Gardner, 2014; Weiss, Simoncelli, &\nAdelson, 2002), reflecting the fact that the world is mostly stable while smaller objects can\nmove around, although this might not always hold (Hammett, Champion, Thompson,\nLimitations\nThere remains a question: Why does the speed appear to get faster steadily whenever the\nnumber of discs increase in the original spinner illusion, while the perceived speed saturated\nrapidly in our experiments? A potential cause for the discrepancy might be the high-SF\nharmonic components in the dot stimuli, as Brooks et al. (2011) showed that a complex\ngrating of 1f \u00fe 2f SF components yielded less asymptotic curves of speed overestimation\nfor higher SFs than a simple grating. Smith and Edgar (1991) also revealed nonlinear ways\nof combining element speeds in various complex gratings, but how this is related to the\nspinner illusion remains open for further investigation. Another factor could be the retinal\nblur due to sharp edges that might add to the effect, as Ho and Anstis (2013) originally\npostulated.\nThe physical contrast was always held constant at 50% in our experiments, and there\ncould have been a confound of perceived contrast across SFs, since perceived speed depends\non contrast (Thompson, 1982). We do not, however, consider that this effect is crucial in our\ncase, because the effect of contrast is less clear for high-contrast stimuli. While Stone\nand Thompson (1992) showed that the effect does not saturate up to 70% contrast, Smith\nand Edgar (1990) informally noted that the perceived speed was independent of contrast\nAnother remaining question is the generality of the spinner effect for second-order stimuli\nthat cannot be computed from spatial and temporal frequencies, which is currently under\ninvestigation by one of the authors (A. H.).\nAuthor Note\nPreliminary results were presented at ECVP 2014 by H. A. and A.
