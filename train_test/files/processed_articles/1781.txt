The Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) first authorized folic acid for-\ntification of all enriched cereal-grain products in the US\nin March 1996 with the primary purpose of decreasing\nthe number of pregnancies affected by neural tube\ndefects, and the policy became mandatory by January\n1998.3 This article examines racial/ethnic and income\ndisparities in folate status in the US before and after\nenactment of mandatory fortification.\n* Corresponding author.

For\nexample, non-Hispanic whites were found to have\nsignificantly higher levels of serum and red blood cell\n(RBC) folate compared with non-Hispanic blacks for\nbetween education and serum and RBC folate.15 Addi-\ntional work has documented an increase in the levels of\nserum folate and RBC folate concentrations, since the\nimplementation of the FDA folic acid fortification policy\nacross race/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the\nUS.16\u00ad19 Overall, mean RBC folate concentrations were\nmean folate intake increased 28%.19 The prevalence of\nover this time period.17 While these studies described\ngeneral trends by certain subgroups, to our knowledge\nno study has explicitly examined the magnitude of\nrelative and absolute disparities in folate status by\nincome and race/ethnicity before and after fortification.\nGiven the large reduction in the prevalence of low\nfolate status for all groups following fortification, we\nexpected that paying attention to changes in both\nabsolute and relative differences across groups would\nbe important in evaluating the impact of fortification on\ndisparities in low RBC folate status. In this study, we\nexamined both the absolute and relative prevalence\nratios of low RBC folate status by race/ethnicity and\nincome quartile before and after implementation of the\nFDA's national fortification policy. As other countries\ncontinue to debate mandatory fortification,20,21 this\nanalysis can shed light on the ability of such a far-\nreaching policy to reach the highest risk groups in a\npopulation.\nMethods\nStudy population\nData for this study come from three waves of\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys (NHANES), which were conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics and the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention to assess the\nhealth, dietary practices and nutritional status of the\ncivilian, non-institutionalized population of the US\n2 months and older. Details on the survey design and\nsampling methods of the NHANES III and NHANES\nelsewhere.22,23 The NHANES III survey was con-\nducted in two phases, each individually designed to\nbe nationally representative.

We\nlimit our sample to adults aged 25 and older in order to\nreduce the measurement error associated with income\nin early adulthood. Of the 8699 individuals participat-\ning in the physical examination in NHANES III, 357\n(4%) are missing values for RBC folate. Those missing\nwere more likely to be non-Hispanic Black or Mexican-\nAmerican, but do not significantly differ by age, income\nwere missing data for income.

Of the remaining 7990\nrespondents, 804 (10%) were missing data on income,\nbut those missing did not differ significantly in RBC\nfolate status. Our final samples consists of 7671 indi-\nsurveys.\nMeasures\nRBC, also known as erythrocyte, folate is a marker\nof long-term folate status. RBC folate concentrations\nwere assessed in NHANES III using two different\nmethods. Prior to November 1993, RBC concentra-\ntions were assayed using the Quanta Phase I Folate\nRadioassay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,\nUSA), while from December 1993 onward the Quanta\nPhase II Folate Radioassay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nHercules, CA, USA) that was also used by NHANES\na correction factor to the earlier NHANES III assays\nto account for incorrect calibration, and detailed\nlaboratory procedures for the two surveys are avail-\nWe used a dichotomous measure for whether the\nindividual has low RBC folate using a previously estab-\nuous values of RBC folate were used to examine\ndistributions of RBC folate before and after fortifica-\ntion. Income was divided into quartiles based on the\npoverty income ratio (PIR), defined as the ratio of a\nfamily's income to their appropriate threshold income\nbased on household size. Since the NHANES surveys do\nnot disclose the year in which an individual was inter-\nviewed within a wave, using the PIR ensures compa-\nrable inflation-adjusted measures across survey years.\nRace\u00adethnicity was represented in three categories:\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black and Mexican-\nAmerican.\nStatistical analysis\nWe calculated crude absolute differences in prevalence\nand relative prevalence ratios directly from tabulation\nof prevalence rates across income quartiles and sepa-\nrately for race/ethnic groups. We used a multivariable\npoisson regression model to calculate the prevalence\nratio and adjusted absolute differences for low RBC\nfolate status by income quartile and race/ethnicity,\nadjusting for age and sex. Income and race/ethnicity\nare simultaneously adjusted in the poisson models.\nSince robust error variance is not compatible with\nadjustment for complex survey design, we used the\nmore conservative (wider) confidence intervals pro-\nvided by STATA's survey commands. Kernel density\nestimates were used to examine smoothed distribu-\ntions of continuous RBC folate by income groups and\nrace/ethnicity before and after fortification. Relative\nand absolute concentration curves and indices for\nincome were created by plotting the cumulative\nproportion of the sample ranked by income quartile\non the X-axis against the cumulative proportion\nof cases of low RBC folate status on the Y-axis.\nAll analyses were carried out using STATA statistical\nsoftware version 10.0 adjusting for complex survey\ndesign (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nFigure 1 displays the changes in the continuous\ndistribution of RBC folate in different groups before\nand after fortification. Here, we see a significant\npopulation shift in exposure following folic acid forti-\nfication. While the distributions for RBC folate have\nuniversally shifted to the right, it is clear that income and\nracial/ethnic differentials in low folate status still remain\nfollowing fortification. Figure 2 shows relative and\nabsolute concentration curves for income and low RBC\nfolate status before and after fortification. Similarly,\nthese calculations show that low RBC folate status\nbecame relatively more concentrated among the poor\nfollowing fortification, reflected by a 179% increase in the\nFigure 1 Distributions of RBC folate by income quartile (left) and race/ethncity (right) before (1991\u00ad94) and after\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, United States\nRelative Concentration Index (RCI). The Absolute\nConcentration Index (ACI), on the other hand, declined\nby 53.9%, reflecting the dramatic decreases in low RBC\nfolate status for all income groups.\nTable 1 shows both the crude relative and absolute\ninequalities in low folate status by income and race/\nethnicity before and after fortification.

Mean levels of RBC folate increased dramatically\nin all groups, with a consequent drop in the percentage\nof individuals classified as having low RBC folate. This\nlarge overall improvement lead to a dramatic decline in\nabsolute income and racial inequalities in low RBC\nfolate status following fortification. Nonetheless, those\nindividuals remaining with low RBC folate status fol-\nlowing fortification were more concentrated in groups\nwith lower income and non-Hispanic black race.\nLynch et al.29 have recently highlighted the impor-\ntance of examining social disparities based on absolute\nrisk measures such as the excess risk difference, since\nrelative measures can emphasize differences in risk\nacross groups that do not necessarily account for the\nmajority of cases of the outcome of interest. This can\noccur when the risk factor accounting for a majority of\ncases of a particular outcome does not vary significantly\nby subgroup. When the major risk factor is eliminated\nor greatly reduced, any remaining group differences in\nrisk may appear large on the relative scale, even though\nthose risk factors account for very few total cases in\nthe populations.29 This scenario parallels our pre- and\npost-fortification population, where the fortification\nintervention has broadly reduced the largest risk of\nlow RBC folate status, namely low dietary intake of\nfolic acid. Because risk has dropped so precipitously for\nall groups, remaining risk differences across income or\nrace can look large on the relative scale even when the\ntotal number of cases has been greatly reduced.\nRecent work by Keppel employed a relative measure\nof disparity to identify the 10 largest racial and ethnic\nhealth disparities in the US.30 Keppel acknowledges\nthe limitations of such a relative approach, since the\nabsolute differences and thus the true public health\nimpact are not revealed from such a perspective. While\nrelative measures such as those used by Keppel are\nnecessary to compare inequalities in outcomes mea-\nsured on different scales, our study further highlights\nthe risk in assuming that the size of a relative associa-\ntion provides information on the public health signif-\nicance. The strength of a relative measure depends upon\nthe distribution of complementary causal components\nin a population and is population dependent, therefore.\nDespite the large improvements in overall levels of\nfolate following fortification, disparities, whether mea-\nsured by an absolute or relative metric, still persist.\nWhat factors might account for the remaining racial/\nethnic and income differences in folate status? Apart\nfrom enriched grains, legumes and vegetables (espe-\ncially leafy greens) are important dietary sources\nfolate.19 There is some evidence of socioeconomic\ndifferences in diet and nutrition. Lower income, lower\neducational attainment and non-Hispanic black ethni-\ncity are associated with lower intake of fruits, vege-\ntables and essential nutrients, and higher intake of total\nfat in the US.31\u00ad34 Similar patterns have been found\nin other developed countries such as Britain, Australia,\nDenmark, Switzerland and The Netherlands.35\u00ad41\nA growing literature is examining the role that neigh-\nbourhoods and access to healthy foods might play\ndifferences in folate intake from different sources\nsuggests that differences in folic acid supplement\nintake account for a majority of racial/ethnic disparities\nin folate levels in the US. These studies show that food\nfolate intake means and medians are quite similar\nacross racial/ethnic groups both before and after forti-\nfication, while intake from supplements is dramatically\nRecent work has shown that despite fortification,\nmost women still do not consume enough folic acid to\nmeet the Institute of Medicine's recommendation of\n400 mg/day to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and\nthese rates vary significantly by race/ethnicity.44 Since\nclinically relevant disparities in folic acid and folate\nlevels still persist, should public health researchers push\nfor fortification levels to be increased? There is evidence\nthat many products may contain higher levels of folic\nacid than required by FDA regulation, leading to a\nhigher increase in folic acid intake from fortified foods\nthan was expected by the FDA.19,45 This has contributed\nto concern that fortification could raise intake above\nsafe limits for some individuals, which can mask B12\ndeficiency and lead to irreversible neurological dam-\nage, especially in the elderly.46,47 Currently, no database\nexists in the US that contains information on the\namount of folic acid contained in foods, and manu-\nfacturer food labels have been found to be unreli-\nable.19,45 This makes estimating the potential effects of\nhigher fortification levels difficult, and higher levels\nof mandated fortification would likely be controversial.\nRemaining income and racial/ethnic disparities will\nlikely need to be addressed by health care professionals\nand public health approaches that encourage targeted\nconsumption of folic acid supplements, especially for\nwomen of child-bearing ages and those in high risk\nsocioeconomic and race/ethnic groups.\nThere are several considerations regarding the inter-\npretation of our study findings. First, our analysis does\nnot examine changes in other trends such as dietary\nor supplement intake by subgroup that might also have\ncontributed to changes in folate disparities over the\ntime period examined. Nevertheless, our goal was to\nexamine the potential for a far-reaching policy such\nas folic acid fortification to reduce disparities in folate\nstatus above and beyond the influence of other con-\ncurrent changes in behaviours or other risk factors\nover this period. Recent work has examined specific\nsources of racial/ethnic differences in folate intake such\nas supplement use before and after fortification, and\nfuture work could do the same for income differences.\nAnother limitation is that a one-time measurement of\neconomic status, such as income, may be measured\nwith error and/or not reflect broader dimensions of SES\nsuch as wealth, thus underestimating the relationship\nbetween SES and folate status both before and after\nfortification.\nThe 1998 FDA folic acid fortification policy was a\nsuccessful example of Geoffrey Rose's goal of improv-\ning population health by shifting the entire distribu-\ntion of a health risk rather than exclusively targeting\nhigh risk individuals.48 Nonetheless, it is notable that\neven with an intervention as aggressive as fortifying\nthe food supply, neither absolute levels of popula-\ntion prevalence or disparities in the prevalence of\nlow folate status have been completely eliminated.\nGiven the difficulty in reducing disparities to zero\neven with such a large-scale intervention, it is impor-\ntant for public health officials to track absolute as\nwell as relative disparities when prioritizing the health\ndisparities that should receive the greatest attention\nand resources.\n"
