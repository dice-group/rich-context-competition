    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhat, if anything, does opera tell us about leadership, leaders and followers, that social research\nor indeed other art forms do not tell us? This is the question I address here. I argue that opera is a\nhighly political genre, able to depict political events involving leaders and followers in sharply\nilluminating ways. In particular, through the device of the chorus it is able to represent the political\nactions and sentiments of large multitudes of people in their complexity and ambiguity. It is also\ncapable of portraying many of the contradictions of leadership in a critical light. In particular, I\nargue that opera offers powerful insights into the psychology of leaders confronted by crisis and\nstrife. It highlights the sacrifices they make, the distance and isolation that frequently afflicts them,\nthe different ways in which they wield power and handle conflicts and the tensions between their\nprivate and public lives. In showing them meting out favours and punishments, opera warns of\nrulers' perennial temptation to abuse their power and highlights some of the dark sides of\nleadership.\n",

In this way, the\nemotional and political impact of a text can be greatly augmented or elaborated by the music\nto which it is set, something that opens up valuable opportunities of illuminating the political\npsychology of leaders and followers.\nOpera is a stage genre, combining words and music, a sung drama. It exists in many\nforms, including tragic and comic, serious and popular (Williams, 2006). Today, it arguably\nincludes other genres like musicals and operettas. The earliest operas date from Italy in the\nearly 17th century, although the genre spread to most European countries, spawning many\nworks in French, German, Russian and other languages. The bulk of the so called ``reper-\ntoire'' can be roughly dated from the middle of 18th century to the early 20th century, but\nnew operas continue to be composed today with varying degrees of success.\nOf the thousands of operas, about twenty or thirty works are today regularly performed\nin some 400 theatres throughout the world (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_opera_\nhouses) and a further thirty to fifty get occasional airings. In addition to being performed\nin opera houses, opera spawns numerous video and audio recordings; performances from the\nworld's great opera houses are now regularly broadcast live in cinemas and theatres through-\nout the globe; YouTube is packed with operatic recordings.\nIn the last forty years or so, the introduction of surtitles or subtitles with translations of\nthe lyrics has enabled audiences to follow more closely the action on stage. It has also\nenabled opera producers to engage in ever more daring stagings, with the drama being\ntransposed to different settings and times from those envisaged by their original creators.\nIt is not unusual today to see an opera originally set in 18th century Seville transposed to a\n20th century concentration camp or a 21st century brothel in New York, a trend that has\nsometimes got out of control, leading to rancorous media debates and controversies.\nOpera today is widely seen as an `elitist' art form. It was not always like this. Starting with\nthe first private theatre built in Venice in 1637, opera was aimed at different social classes.\nMozart's Magic Flute was composed for a public that resembled more the audience of a\ncontemporary pop concert than a group of snobbish cognoscenti. During the golden era of\nItalian melodrama it was not uncommon to hear a recently premiered opera's best tunes\nplayed by street organ grinders. Even more so, there was a time when opera was capable of\nlaunching revolutions. In 1830, following a performance of Auber's grand opera La Muette\nde Portici in the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels, a crowd stormed the local courthouse\nsetting off the revolution that led to Belgian political independence. The opera that so stirred\nthe passions of Belgian patriots was about a failed revolution in Naples in 1647. In it, the\nrebel leader Masaniello becomes horrified by the brutality of the mob, is denounced as a\ntraitor, and is finally murdered by his own followers.\nRevolution is not an uncommon theme for opera, nor indeed are wars with victories and\ndefeats, enslavement and liberation, peace treaties, state marriages, exiles and public execu-\ntions, conspiracies, political assassinations, state visits, succession struggles, dictatorship,\ndemocracy and many other political phenomena. Over its history of nearly four hundred\nyears, from Claudio Monteverdi's Incoronazione di Poppea (1643) to John Adams's Nixon in\nChina (1987), opera has regularly sought to depict, criticize and comment on power and\nsubjugation in every conceivable context. Opera has shown a considerable versatility in\nengaging with the great public issues of different eras \u00ad from the rise of the bourgeoisie in\nMozart's Nozze di Figaro (1786) to Mark-Anthony Turnage's treatment of media fed celeb-\nrity culture in Anna Nicole (2011), a dramatization of the life of the American model and\ntelevision personality. State politics, family feuds, class politics, racial politics, religious\npolitics and, of course, gender politics have never been out of its sites.\nThe subjects chosen by opera composers reflect the political realities and anxieties of their\ntime. Written before the failure of the 1848 revolutionary efforts in Italy, Verdi's early operas\nwith their rousing choruses and great exaltations of patriotism expressed the ideals of Italian\nunification and independence; the slogan ``Viva Verdi'' came to stand for ``Viva Vittorio\nEmanuele Re D'Italia'' (Long Live Victor Emmanuel, King of (unified) Italy). Verdi himself,\n`the voice of the Risorgimento' served in Italy's first national parliament and his funeral\nWagner actively supported the unsuccessful Dresden Revolution in 1849 and was forced to\nlive for eleven years in exile. Long after his death, his music dramas with their powerful\nevocation of a heroic Nordic past provided a vibrant ingredient of Nazi ideology. The\nconnection between Wagner's music and Nazi politics still arouses great passions. Wagner\nwas a notorious anti-Semite and racist and his operas are not performed in Israel to this day.\nThe political power of opera was recognized early by various censors who sought to\ncontrol and tame it. Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, probably the three greatest operatic com-\nposers, repeatedly fell foul of censors as did virtually every major composer of the 19th\ncentury. Many famous operas exist in different versions as a result of their composers'\nattempts to meet, to evade or even to resist the demands of censorship. Dmitri\nShostakovitch's opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District prompted a denunciation by\nthe Communist Party newspaper Pravda in 1936, possibly written by Stalin himself, as ``an\nugly flood of confusing sound . . . a pandemonium of creaking, shrieking and crashes'' warn-\ning that ``it might end very badly'' for the composer. The work was banished for some thirty\nyears and left Shostakovich living in fear of arrest and execution for the rest of his life.\nOpera is a political phenomenon, not merely in its content but in the passions that it\narouses and the political processes it sets in motion. This is true even today when it is no\nlonger capable of launching revolutions but can be the topic of acrimonious debates.\nIndividual opera productions are constantly sparking bitter disputes over whether they\ninsult public mores or artistic tastes. Even more significantly, the question of whether the\nstate should be subsidizing an `elitist' art form in which the huge majority of the population\nhas no interest is never far from the public agenda.\nThe staging of an opera is itself a political process involving many competing interests,\nincluding those of the composer, the producer, the conductor, the theatre director to say\nnothing of various temperamental singers and the multitudes of support workers \u00ad chorus\nmembers, orchestral players, technicians and stage-hands. Indeed there have been several\noperas, including by Mozart and Strauss, about the staging of an opera and associated\nconflicts and complications. For all the accusations of operatic elitism or maybe because\nof them, the BBC series The House documenting Jeremy Isaacs' leadership of London's\nRoyal Opera House in 1995 attracted more than four million viewers. They were drawn\nto it largely by what seemed like the political shenanigans and intrigues of overstretched\nleadership, financial mismanagement, constant technical and human problems, embittered\nstaff and capricious prima donnas.\nLeadership and relations between leaders and their followers are central ingredients in\nmany operas, as indeed they are in many types of drama and art. Operatic rulers range far\nand wide \u00ad heroic, tyrannical, benevolent, flippant, wise, guilt-ridden, magnanimous, puni-\ntive, loving, deranged, enlightened, ambitious, depressed, narcissistic, paranoid, illegitimate\nand so forth. They can be terrifying or merely ridiculous \u00ad Mustafa in Rossini's L'Italiana in\nAlgeri being a good example of the latter spiced with ill-hidden racist prejudices and xeno-\nphobia. They can be male or female: and in fact among the most villainous characters in all\ntime operas one finds queens or princesses, like the Queen of the Night in Mozart's Magic\nFlute, the lead female characters in Verdi's Nabucco and Macbeth and the title roles in\nRossini's Semiramide, Strauss's Salome and Puccini's Turandot. They can be triumphant\nor punished by their karma: and usually, in opera, cruel and unjust leaders pay with their\nlife with some remarkable exceptions such as Nero and Poppea in Monteverdi's\nIncoronazione. Moreover, as with all drama, the same leader, say Verdi's Otello, can be\nportrayed in many different ways by different interpreters in different productions \u00ad as\nnoble warrior, jealous husband, deracinated alien, innocent child and so forth.\nThe chorus and the psychology of collective followership\nDue to its ability to give collective voice to numerous individuals, opera can offer psycho-\nlogically rich and complex portraits of human multitudes. Operatic choruses can show\ngroups of people acting as rebellious mobs, disciplined fighting units, confused and needy\nsubjects, patriotic crowds thirsting for freedom, merrymaking gatherings, debating assem-\nblies, religious congregations and many others besides. Indeed, there are several major\noperas in which the chorus is a major character in the storyline or even the protagonist.\n``It is an opera not of heroes and heroines, but of crowds and armies'' Bernard Shaw wrote\nastutely about Rossini's William Tell (Arblaster, 1992: 76), something that can be said about\nseveral other works as well.\nOperatic composers were not, of course, the first ones to use a chorus in giving voice to\nshared feelings and attitudes. The chorus in Greek tragedy was usually a group of men or\nwomen witnessing events and actions on the stage and offering a critical commentary on the\ncharacters, the situations they faced and their actions. Singing choirs are a central part of\nWestern ecclesiastical tradition where polyphonic music with its dissonances and chromati-\ncisms was reluctantly accepted by the Church as a means of praising God, reaching its own\napotheosis in the great oratorios of Bach and Handel. The chorus also plays a major part in\nsome large symphonic works, starting with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. It is in opera,\nhowever, where it demonstrates its full dramatic potential by actually driving the drama\nforward and inviting the audience to share its own predicament and judge its actions.\nConsider for example the famous chorus Va, Pensiero from Verdi's Nabucco, the music\nspontaneously sung by the crowd that followed his funeral cortege more than half a century\nlater. Exiled from their home to Babylon, oppressed and exploited, the Hebrew slaves are\nlamenting their fate in verses like ``Oh, my fatherland, so beautiful and lost! Oh, remem-\nbrance, so dear and so ill-fated''. What gives these mundane words their great power and\nmakes them utterly unforgettable is, of course, the music. They are sung in hushed unison by\nthe chorus to one of Verdi's sweeping melodies that carries everything along. The music's\nalmost unbearable nostalgia and yearning transcend individual differences to become part of\na shared experience and a shared ideal, one that immediately reaches out to the audience.\nBetween the world of Biblical Jews and the Italians' messy political struggles for independ-\nence the gap is huge \u00ad and yet, ``the choral texture becomes a musical metaphor of the\nVa Pensiero was the first of many patriotic choruses that established Verdi as a significant\npolitical figure of his age (another example from a year later is the chorus ``O Signore dal\ntetto natio'' from I Lombardi alla prima Crociata). It is worth noting that in turning Macbeth\ninto an opera, Verdi sought to compensate for the omission of several dramatic episodes in\nShakespeare's drama, by composing substantial choral parts, including the chorus ``Patria\nOppressa'' sung by Scottish exiles, echoing the sentiments of the Hebrew slaves and if any-\nthing bleaker and more desolate. This chorus was substantially enhanced in the revisions\nthat Verdi carried out for the Paris production of the opera in 1865, where he also concluded\nthe drama with a victory chorus celebrating the death of the tyrant and the end of oppres-\nsion. It is the presence of the chorus throughout the opera that highlights the political\nveys the political message that tyrants do not last forever. The last word belongs neither to\nthe dying tyrant nor to the new leaders; it belongs to the people.\nIt is notable that in several of Verdi's early operas, the chorus acts as a leaderless mass,\neven if a leader (like the priest Zaccaria in Nabucco and Macduff and Malcolm in Macbeth)\nat some stage steps in to lead them. In contrast to the tyrants they oppose, these figures are\ndwarfed by crowds of followers that they lead \u00ad it is not the leaders but rather the followers\nwho eventually ensure that good will prevail against evil and that the mass of humanity will\nhold tyrants to account. In his early works which were as much an expression of political\naspiration as of purely musical values, Verdi offered an idealized view of the crowd driving\nhistorical events that may be seen as one-dimensional or simplistic. It is worth remembering,\nhowever, that in the aftermath of the French Revolution, when many intellectuals, such as\nEdmund Burke and Hippolyte Taine, had come to view revolutionary crowds as ``band[s] of\ncruel ruffians and assassins, reeking with . . . blood'' (cited in Rude, 1959: 2) or at least as\nrabble (a view which can be found in some operas, including in La Muette de Portici that\nlaunched the Belgian Revolution and even more in Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes), Verdi's\nidealization stands as an important corrective.\nA different depiction of the masses is presented in Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov.\nThe work is a sprawling political panorama of events in Russia during the doomed reign of\nBoris Godunov from 1598 to 1605, the tsar who assumed power following the death (pos-\nsibly by assassination) of the legitimate heir, the ten-year-old Dmitry, who had been placed\nunder his protection. The opera exists in several versions involving a number of scenes, some\npublic and grand, some private and intimate, and a huge cast of characters including the\nTsar and his children, monks, chroniclers, a pretender to the throne, a variety of boyars and\nnoblemen, a Jesuit priest and a Polish princess, various policemen and frontier guards, a\nsimpleton or Holy Fool and, above all, the people. The chorus is a vital part of this drama.\nAs it frequently does for Verdi, here too the chorus represents above all the suffering people,\nin this instance the people of Russia during the period referred to as the ``time of troubles''.\nUnlike Verdi's choruses, however, the chorus, in this work assumes many different and\nhighly differentiated forms, now as a rent-a-mob pleading with Boris to become their\nking, now as hungry and desperate crowd, now as a gang of unruly and callous street\nchildren, now as a riotous throng quarrelling among themselves, now as a mob thirsting\nfor blood, now as an enduring and noble mass of humanity praying for a better future.\nA particularly brilliant portrait of the people emerges in the opera's final scene in the\nrevised version, widely known as the Revolution scene. It starts in the pandemonium of a\nrevolution, depicting an anarchic mob, including men, women and children, who have\ncaptured a local nobleman. They are baiting him, beating him and are about to torture\nand kill him. They are interrupted by the arrival of two itinerant vagabonds/monks who\nannounce the coming of a new Tsar, the False Dmitry, and denounce the crimes of Boris\nGodunov. They, in turn, are followed by two Jesuits; they are captured by the mob who are\npreparing to hang them. At the crucial moment, the Pretender and his predominantly foreign\nretinue arrive on the stage. Urged by the vagabond monks, the mob immediately acknow-\nledge him as their new Tsar. He, in turn, frees the captive nobleman and asks the crowd to\nfollow him onto Moscow to seize power. They all exit the stage, leaving the Holy Fool alone\nto lament the sufferings of the people \u00ad they have now embarked on another ill-fated adven-\nture under a different doomed leader.\nIn the course of the barely 20 minutes that this scene lasts, we see the crowd first as an\nanarchic but differentiated mob lusting for revenge \u00ad all energy and no direction or plan.\nIt then comes under the influence of two opportunists who egg them on, only to embrace\ntheir new ruler, even though his first action is to deprive them of their prey. Their cries of\n`Glory, Glory' are almost identical to those with which they had greeted his predecessor\nbringing the plot full circle to the earlier scene when the same people were celebrating Boris's\ncoronation.\nOpera and leaders\nAlong with many other operas, Boris Godunov does not celebrate or support the view of\nrulers as transforming or charismatic leaders. Rulers in opera, even idealistic ones, suffer\nand, usually, fail in their missions. To be sure, most operatic rulers are kings and potentates,\ntyrants and occasionally democratically elected politicians rather than princes or conven-\ntional heroes, roles which are generally assigned to even more doomed characters. In few\noccasions when opera places an ostensibly charismatic leader like Joan of Arc, Moses or\nAlexander the Great centre-stage, the result scarcely highlights the character's charisma, in\nthe way, for example, that Bach does so successfully in his portrayal of Christ in his two\nsettings of the passion. Instead, charismatic leaders, when they feature in opera, tend to\nemerge either as conflicted and tormented beings or as rather monochromatic characters on\nauto-pilot with destiny.\nAt its best, what opera, with its ability to invest words with conscious and unconscious\nsignificance afforded by music, can do is to open windows into the psychology of leaders. It\ncan explore and expose in detail their ambivalence, confusion, doubts, regrets, disappoint-\nments, hopes, despair and many other emotions. It can reveal inconsistencies between desires\nand actions and discontinuities between intentions and outcomes. More specifically, opera\ncan reveal sharply the leader's inner conflicts and torments that are rarely discussed in\npublic, and also the distance between a leader's inner state of mind and his or her public\npronouncements and displays. In this section, we will discuss three such operatic portraits of\nleaders, all dating from the latter part of the 19th century and all dealing with real historical\npersonages from several centuries earlier. All three leaders in question lived in times of strife,\nwar and rebellion and their operatic portraits display considerable psychological but also\npolitical complexity and depth.\nVerdi's Simon Boccanegra\nIn Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, the eponymous character, a former pirate, aided by two cor-\nrupt conspirators is elected Doge of Genoa in a successful attempt by the plebeians to seize\npower from the aristocracy. The opera's tortuous plot is rife with conspiracies, conflicts,\nalliances and betrayals, at the political, family and personal levels. But behind the various\nmachinations, deaths, curses, reunions and reconciliations, we have a magisterial portrait of\na leader, whose legitimacy at the start of the drama is questionable but who, in the course of\nit, rises to considerable stature and authority as he strives to maintain the unity and harmony\nof the state in the face of rebellion and strife. The political motivations of the Doge are\nclosely intertwined with his most private feelings: in the course of the opera we see him\nregularly deflected from his political goals because of his love for his daughter.\nAt the heart of the opera is a uniquely powerful scene, added by Verdi some 24 years after\nthe work's premiere, in which Boccanegra stands up to a rebellious crowd invading the\nCouncil Chamber. Plebeians and patricians throw a variety of accusations and recrimin-\nations at each other and intermittent fighting erupts which Boccanegra effectively quells with\na message of peace inspired by Petrarch. Throughout the opera Boccanegra is portrayed as\nsomeone who seeks to heal class divisions in the light of conspiracies and betrayals (which\nalso afflicted the historical Boccanegra throughout the two periods of his dogeship). At the\nopera's desolate end, Boccanegra, reconciled with his patrician foe, dies, poisoned by the\nman who had orchestrated his ascent to the throne. Before he dies, and as the crowd is\nalready mourning his demise, he anoints a young patrician (one who had earlier sought to\nkill him) as his successor. The omens for his successor are clearly bleak.\nAnger and intimidation are in this leader's repertoire as he is portrayed in the opera. His\nanger is indeed terrifying and it has to be terrifying if it is to control the forces of chaos and\nanarchy that he faces, in the manner of a true Machiavellian ruler (Machiavelli, 1513/1961)\nfor whom maintaining the cohesion of his state is a supreme responsibility. But this is also a\nleader capable of displaying great generosity, magnanimity and love, aware that neither\npeace nor harmony can be built through tortures and executions. This ecumenical empathy\nis vastly amplified by Verdi's magnificent music: it is surely not a coincidence that Simone's\nmost memorable musical utterance (the famous ``Plebe, patrizi, popolo!'' (Plebeians, patri-\ncians, people!) during the abovementioned Council Chamber scene) leads to a majestic\nensemble in which the Doge's passionate appeal for brotherhood enables the other charac-\nters, patricians and plebeians, allies and enemies, to, at least publicly, join him in expressing\nsimilar feelings, even if not sincerely held.\nVerdi's Don Carlos\nMaintaining the cohesion of the state in the face of religious war and rebellion is also\nessential to understanding another major leader as portrayed in opera, Philip II of Spain.\nHe is a central character in Verdi's Don Carlos which was inspired by Friedrich Schiller's\neponymous drama. Philip is a less sympathetic character than Boccanegra, willing to send\nrebels and heretics to their death in defence of his realm, to abandon his only friend and ally\nto the Inquisition, to cheat, spy and bully his wife and her retinue and eventually to sacrifice\nhis rebellious son in the interest of the state. In the hands of a lesser composer or a less\npolitically shrewd composer, Philip would emerge as a mere brute of a man or just a melo-\ndramatic villain, as indeed such characters feature in many other operas. What makes\nVerdi's portrait of Philip so compelling and instructive is, firstly, the dramatic situations\nin which the composer places him (and these owe a lot to Schiller) but more importantly the\nmusic that Verdi composed for Philip's deep and authoritative bass voice.\nUnlike Boccanegra, Philip has no direct problems with his legitimacy. He is the rightful\nmonarch, the son of Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, and in addition to the Iberian\npeninsula he rules many parts of Italy, central Europe and, of course, Flanders where he\nfaces a bitter religious war and rebellion. He does not appear until a good hour into the\nopera and thereafter assumes centre stage. We first encounter him brutally dismissing the\nQueen's lady-in-attendance for disobeying his orders. We then see him in a heated political\nargument with the idealistic Marquis de Posa on the value of freedom and peace in which\nPhilip defends the use of naked force in defence of the realm. At this point, the orchestra\nbursts in a cacophonous explosion of sound, indicating both the ferocity of the force and the\ncomposer's questioning its legitimacy. Yet, the argument closes mysteriously with the king\ntaking his opponent into his confidence with the words:\nYour proud gaze has penetrated deep into the heart of my throne;\nLearn then the anguish and grief inside a head\nWeighed down by the crown;\nLook now at the royal palace\nAnd the anxiety that pervades it.\nUnhappy father, husband unhappier still.\nIn the next act, we see Philip dismissing the pleas for mercy of Flemish deputies, confronting\nCarlos, his son, who draws a sword against him, and ``celebrating'' the public burning of\nheretics. We then meet Philip in his royal study, after a sleepless night, lamenting a loveless\nmarriage, a palace full of traitors and conspirators with eyes on the throne and a life that will\nonly find rest in the black vault of the Escorial. This soliloquy, which in many performances\nends with the monarch weeping privately, is rendered to the greatest music that Verdi\ncomposed for the bass voice (and possibly for any voice) and is followed by another political\nencounter. This time Philip meets the indomitable figure of the Grand Inquisitor who\ndemands the death of Posa, the only man that Philip can trust or for whom he has any\naffection. The encounter between state and Church, vocally depicted through the struggle\nbetween two bass voices, can only be described as terrifying. The king's final words, music-\nally diving from the highest note of his voice to the lowest, leave no doubt as to the outcome\nof the struggle:\nThus, the throne will always\nBow in front of the altar!\nIn the rest of the opera, united, the throne and the altar bring about the death of the idealist\nPosa, quell another crowd rebellion led by Carlos and, in the final scene, preside over the\ndemise of Carlos himself (although Verdi and his librettist departed from Schiller here\nallowing for some ambiguity concerning the hero's actual end).\nAs potent piece of political music drama, Don Carlos offers a portrait of a leader who is\nlonely, suspicious to the point of paranoia, brutal and autocratic. He is strongly reminiscent\nof Plato's (1993: 324ff) depiction of tyrants whose need to dominate stops them tasting ``true\nfreedom or friendship.'' Philip's isolation, a feature that generally goes unnoticed by lead-\nership theorists, is near total, but so too is his courage in the face of opposition and adver-\nsity. Although never a sympathetic character, Philip emerges as a believable, three\ndimensional person with a single mission \u00ad to maintain the unity of his empire at all\ncosts. To this end, he is willing to sacrifice his son, his only friend and, of course, any\nclaim to personal happiness. Sacrifice is a key aspect of leadership, one which features in\ncountless operas, from Mozart's Idomeneo to Wagner's Walku\u00a8ren and in innumerable reli-\ngious texts, not least the Christian New Testament, yet it is rarely discussed by leadership\nGrint (2010) who has provided by far the most convincing account regarding sacrifice as the\nsine qua non of leadership, views sacrifice as underpinning the leader's isolation by creating a\ngulf between the leader who can make sacrifices and the followers who regard them as\nlegitimate. Sacrifice is also the hallmark of the leader's power, a power whose failure\nmakes the leader him/herself a sacrificial victim.\nLeaders . . . have a Faustian pact with their followers, in which the leaders accumulate privileges\nof power or wealth or whatever is deemed appropriate at the expense of the followers \u00ad some of\nwhom may be sacrificed for the collective good. In return the leaders legitimate and secure the\ngoals of followers, but if and when the leaders fail then they must become the sacrificial victims\nIf leaders making sacrifices or being sacrificed themselves are not rare in opera, the image of\na supreme leader weeping away from the public eye is a rare and very powerful one. It is\ncertainly an image that haunts Thomas Mann's (1968) young Tonio Kro\n\u00a8 ger and when a\npublic figure of considerable authority (including a politician, a judge or even a teacher or a\nlecturer) is seen crying, the effect can be overwhelming and unpredictable, as demonstrated\nby Margaret Thatcher when leaving office or George W Bush when awarding a posthumous\nmedal to a dead serviceman. To see a person in authority cry and if the tears are seen to be\ngenuine rather than manufactured for effect destroys the leadership mystique and lays bare\nthe unconscious fantasy of the leader as someone above others, one who is not affected by\nthe same afflictions as ordinary mortals.\nMussorgsky's Boris Godunov\nUnlike Philip II, in most modern productions we do not see Boris Godunov crying. We do,\nhowever, see him psychologically collapse twice in the course of Mussorgsky's great opera.\nThe first time, he is undone by his courtier Vasiliy Shuisky's description of the death of the\nlegitimate heir to the throne. Later, and as the drama approaches its denouement, he meets\nthe elderly chronicler Pimen who describes a dream of the murdered child and a subsequent\npilgrimage to his grave, something that precipitates Boris's final collapse and death. What we\nwitness in these two scenes is a ruler in the grip of utter terror leading to his physical,\nspiritual and psychological unhinging. Witnessing such terror has a mesmeric effect on the\naudience and destabilizes another aspect of the leadership mystique, the fantasy of the leader\nas all-powerful and fearless in the face of extreme adversity. The effect is augmented by the\nbreakdown of the musical line and the performer lapsing into something more akin to talk,\nas if the musical language has reached its limit in the face of abject horror, overpowering\nguilt and blind panic, emotions that we rarely witness in a ruler and are even hard to\nimagine.\nIn another memorable scene we see Boris meeting the Holy Idiot or Simpleton (yuro\n\u00b4 divi\u00a8y)\noutside the Saint Basil's Cathedral. The last to remain in front of the Tsar when a desolate\ncrowd has melted away, the idiot accuses him of having blood on his hands, a charge that\ngoes unanswered. This scene brings the supreme leader face to face with the lowest of his\nsubjects and destabilizes another facet of the leader mystique by reversing the archetypal\nscene of meeting God on the day of Judgement (Gabriel, 1997) \u00ad here it is the lowly subject\nwho passes judgement on the figure of authority, drawing the leader outside the rehearsed\nroutines of protocol and ceremony and inviting us to judge him in a more authentic light.\nWhereas elsewhere in the drama, the people when confronted with overbearing power stay\nsilent, here it is the monarch who stays silent in the face of the most extreme accusation that\nprecipitates yet another crisis to his claim to legitimacy. Like Boccanegra and Philip II, Boris\nfinds himself in total isolation; but unlike them, the outer crisis that he faces unleashes an\ninner crisis from which he will not recover.\nAll three leadership portraits discussed here present rulers who are isolated, who face\nchallenges to their legitimacy, who are constantly preoccupied with conspirators and traitors\nundermining their rule and are governing countries torn by social strife, war and divisions.\nThey all are greatly preoccupied with maintaining the unity of their state and, to different\nextents, they care for the welfare of their subjects. They are all prepared to make sacrifices\nand are willing to sacrifice their peace of mind in the interest of the state. They wield con-\nsiderable power and, yet, they discover that this power is regularly foiled by religious and\nother institutions and is certainly insufficient in attaining their objectives. They all find\nthat between their actions and the outcomes of these actions there is an insurmountable\ngulf. All three carry heavy burdens and suffer.\nWhat makes these portraits particularly compelling is that, in addition to their public\nroles, we meet all three of them in intimate family situations. Boccanegra is reunited with a\nlong lost daughter after many years of separation, Philip is engaged in a long-standing battle\nwith his idealistic son and heir, while Boris is a loving father of two young children whose\nhappiness or even survival he cannot secure. These intimate aspects of leadership, in all their\ncomplexity and ambivalence, are ones that we rarely glimpse in scholarly literature. In opera,\non the other hand, they provide a powerful counter-weight to the leader's public duties.\nFamily life, far from being an irrelevant distraction turns out to be every bit as political as\nthe public arenas. It is a conjugal dispute with his wife (whom he believes unfaithful) that\nleads Philip to a paroxysm of anger, prompting Posa to tell him:\nSire, half of the world is in your power\nIn such a vast empire,\nAre you the only person you cannot rule over?\nA notable difference between Philip's behaviour as King and the leadership style displayed\nby Boccanegra concerns the extent to which each of these leaders allow their private feelings\nto dictate their political decisions. While Boccanegra's public choices are affected by his\npaternal love for his daughter, he stops short of allowing this love to jeopardize the safety\nof his kingdom; even in moments of acute anger, he holds back from behaving impulsively or\nrecklessly. Philip II, on the other hand, allows personal feelings prompted by jealousy for his\nwife and antagonism for his son to dictate his actions; his anger leads to all kinds of\nirrational acts as he seeks to bolster his authority (that unlike Boccanegra's in not being\nquestioned) by arbitrary and excessive displays of power, lapsing into the familiar pattern of\ntortured authoritarianism. The one political act that would resolve all of his conflicts,\nhanding his rebellious son to the Grand Inquisitor, is precisely the one that he constantly\nevades, not due to love for his son, but due to his consistent tendency to displace his anger\nonto innocent scapegoats.\nOperatic leaders: Ambition, legitimacy and abuse of power\nLike other art forms, opera can offer different portraits of leadership, some more insightful\nthan others. At its worst, it offers caricatures of power wielders, flattering or grotesque\ndepending on the occasion. At its best, like other art forms, opera can provide unique\ninsights into the process of leadership, the minds of the leaders and the needs of the fol-\nlowers. We can now return to our opening question, What, if anything, does opera tell\nus about leadership, leaders and followers, that social research or indeed other art forms do\nnot tell us?\nOur earlier discussion would suggest that, when addressing the complexities of leadership,\nopera in the first instance highlights the importance of leaders themselves as human agents\nwith needs of their own, strengths and vulnerabilities. Current debates on leadership have\ntended to shift the emphasis away from the leaders towards the processes and functions of\nleadership that may be diffused throughout an organization, an institution or a state. Heroic\nleadership which once dominated leadership scholarship is currently being (rightly) con-\ntested by conceptualisations of leadership as process and relation. Opera, at its best, acknow-\nledges that leadership may be a terrain of strife and contestation. Yet, it is a terrain that is\nclaimed ultimately by women and men of ambition and power. The political requirements of\na state, a community or an organization as well as the psychological needs of followers\ndictate that leadership cannot simply be diffused among many different actors: it must be\nexercised by particular individuals, men and women, who may perform better or less well\nand are judged by their record. Leadership cannot, in operatic terms, be distributed\n2003) in a bureaucratic hierarchy (although opera is not unable to portray bureaucracy) \u00ad\nit has to be identified with specific individuals who occupy leadership positions not only in\nrelation to the events on stage but also in the minds of those on stage and, maybe more\nimportantly, in the minds of the audience.\nThe legitimacy of the leaders is problematic, as we saw in all the earlier examples. In\nmaintaining their legitimacy, leaders must in the first place uphold the unity of their realm\nand, secondarily, ensure the welfare of their followers and communities, as Machiavelli\nclearly recognized. In doing so, leaders must endure hardships, political and personal, and\nmust make numerous sacrifices affecting themselves and their families. They must be pre-\npared and willing to sacrifice others and suffer the consequences when such sacrifices are\nchallenged or resisted. They may crave popular approval but must often endure disappro-\nbation and vilification \u00ad hence leadership calls for courage and doggedness but, also, para-\ndoxically, for flexibility and versatility.\nOpera thrives in presenting leaders in situations of crisis, strife and conflict. The\nnotion that leaders may enjoy a quiet and peaceful time is instantly dispelled by a\ncasual look at any operatic text, even before one listens to the music to which it is\nset. Leaders are called to face conflict. Sometimes this may not be of their own creation\nbut it often is \u00ad their actions knowingly or unknowingly unleash conflicts without which\nthere is no drama. One aspect of conflict starkly revealed by opera is how easily inter-\npersonal and family conflicts turn into political conflicts and vice-versa. Consequently,\nthe fiction that long dominated management theorizing, that of the unitary concept of an\norganization in which all interests are aligned together and from which all conflict can be\nbanished has no place whatever in operatic settings. Conflict is of the essence in leader-\nship and, even when passionately and sincerely pursuing peace like Boccanegra, a leader\nis someone willing to fight and struggle for his or her beliefs and interests \u00ad a leader\nconstantly lives with conflict and its unpredictable consequences. Opera, then, amply\nconfirms Burns' statement that ``leaders, whatever their professions of harmony, do\nnot shun conflict; they confront it, exploit it, ultimately embody it'' (Burns, 1978: 39)\nThus, if in making and enduring sacrifices, a leader comes close to a sacral figure (Grint,\n2010; Hatch et al., 2005), in taking on opponents, winning and losing battles, a leader is\nnever far from the figure of a warrior or a general (Alvesson and Spicer, 2011).\nTwo elements of leadership that are greatly highlighted by opera are the leader's pro-\npensity to punish disobedience (Cunha et al., 2013) and to reward loyalty \u00ad both of these are\nliable to abuse. Punishments meted out by leaders can be unduly harsh (as in the case of\nPhilip II) while rewards for loyalty easily turn into recipes for nepotism and flattery. Thus,\nwhile emphatically focusing the stage lights on the faces of leaders, opera does not neces-\nsarily seek to idealize them. On the contrary, with the exception of celebratory or syco-\nphantic works, opera is suspicious of the idea of charismatic leaders who, through force of\npersonality or gift of grace, can sweep all obstacles aside and lead their followers to a\npromised land. Works about monolithic and tetragonal leaders rapidly become boring\nand implausible with limited aesthetic and expressive potential.\nOpera is also quite short of examples of transforming leadership, where leaders and\nfollowers relate in such a way as to advance to a higher level of morality and motivation,\nreaching new heights of achievement and common purpose (Burns, 1978). Even in the\nreduced sense proposed by Bass (1990, 1999), transformational leadership is more likely\nto be lapse into cultism and authoritarianism (Tourish and Pinnington, 2002).\nTransforming leaders in opera are liable to be depicted as opportunists, like the Pretender\nDmitry, rousing the populace for personal aggrandizement in the Revolution Scene of Boris\nGodunov than as interacting with their followers for ``mutual stimulation and elevation''\n(Burns, 1978: 4). Even when a leader in opera experiences a moment of personal transform-\nation, realizes the responsibilities and burdens of leadership and determines to dedicate his/\nher life to the common good, the result can be surprisingly disappointing, as if such an\noccurrence is so contrived that no amount of effort from the librettist and composer makes it\nplausible. This is demonstrated by Don Carlo in Verdi's Ernani who, craving to be elected\nEmperor (as Charles V), needs only a few seconds (and a few bars of music) to transform\nhim from unscrupulous and quite villainous womanizer into idealistic statesman concerned\nwith leaving a benign legacy to posterity.\nOperatic leadership is ineffably linked to ambition, even when a leader assumes power\nreluctantly (as in the cases of Boccanegra and Boris). Ambition can make leaders attractive\nto followers, yet, it quickly becomes a double edged sword \u00ad it can help leaders assume great\npower and make them hugely popular with followers; it can also enable them to endure\nunpopularity and adversity. In the majority of cases, it also leads to their downfall, some-\nthing that can be observed daily in our times with leaders of business organizations, inter-\nnational bodies, public sector organizations and, of course, political parties, as\ndemonstrated by the tribulations that afflicted several of the UK's recent Prime Ministers.\nOpera, therefore, consistently highlights the dark side of leadership (Tourish, 2013). It\npoignantly and pointedly demonstrates that the same qualities that raise leaders to great\nheights, their ambition, self-confidence, eloquence, decisiveness and so forth also account\nfor their shortcomings. This, maybe, is the most important lesson from opera, as it is from\ntragic drama \u00ad the same qualities that account for a leader's triumphs also account for his or\nher downfall.\nThis then may be the most important lesson that opera affords us on the topic of\nleadership. Great figures make for powerful drama, especially if we can observe them and\ncompare their actions on the large political stage as well as in intimate contact with their\nclose associates and their families. Opera can highlight the needs of the people as fol-\nlowers through powerful choruses and large multitudes acting and singing in concert on\nstage, emphasizing their propensity to come turn to a `strong man' especially in times of\nstress and uncertainty. In most such cases, leaders, successful at first, are more liable to\ndisappoint than meet the exaggerated expectations and hopes of their followers. Early\nmiracles and triumphs are generally preambles to calamities and misfortunes.\nFortunately, most organizations, like hospitals, businesses and government departments,\nuniversities and international organizations, in spite of their rhetoric neither seek miracles\nnor demand them of their leaders. Leaders do not have to be superhuman and, as opera\nwarns, seeking to appear as such usually proves fatal. Delivering a sound service to their\nconstituents, respecting their communities and the environment, conducting their business in\nan ethical manner and supporting their own staff are much more important goals than\nchimeric ambitions of being Number 1 in this or World Leader in that (Thanem, 2013).\nIn most organizational contexts, realistic, down to earth, accountable and pluralistic lead-\nership is far more likely to produce enduring and socially meaningful results than leadership\nthat, lapsing to hype and hubris (Claxton et al., 2015), casts itself as transformational or\ncharismatic.\nIn conclusion\nOpera thrives in depicting the motives, actions and emotions of large multitudes of people\nand their rulers, especially in moments of strife, uncertainty and crisis. At its best, opera can\nprovoke, annoy, challenge and inspire us, offering insights into the predicaments and emo-\ntions of followers and their leaders. It is particularly effective at portraying the followers'\npotent and conflicting needs for protection, certainty and freedom and also the leaders'\nambition, uncertainty and isolation. Opera highlights the anxieties of leaders facing chal-\nlenges to their legitimacy, often surrounded by conspirators and sycophants and often\nresorting to inappropriate punishments, sacrifices and favours in seeking to quell these\nanxieties. It illustrates powerfully how some of the leaders' qualities turn into vices when\ncircumstances change, unleashing abuses of power and legitimizing other ethical transgres-\nsions. Finally, opera reminds us that maintaining the cohesion of a state, an empire or even\nan organization is not a simple matter and cannot be taken for granted. This is a lesson that\nleaders ignore at their own peril as many of Europe's political leaders are discovering to their\ncost as this article is going to press.\n"
