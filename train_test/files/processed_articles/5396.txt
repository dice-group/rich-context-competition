For example, the new\nvariable, \"patient activation,\" and the somewhat older vari-\nable of \"self-efficacy\" have both been explored recently in\nrelation to hospital and emergency department (ED) utiliza-\ntion patterns (Begum et al., 2011; Greene and Hibbard,\n2011). Health locus of control (LOC), defined as an indi-\nvidual's belief system about control over health outcomes\n(Wallston et al., 1976), is one variable which has been\nexamined in this context (Bazargan et al., 1998; Chambers\net al., 2013). While the evidence for a relationship between\nhealth LOC and health outcomes or utilization is mixed,\nthere have been many studies examining the construct of\nhealth LOC in general and the Multidimensional Health\nLocus of Control (MHLC) scale (Wallston, 2005) in par-\nticular. Health LOC has been measured using the MHLC\nscale for the past 40\nDespite this long history of use, some questions regarding\nthe underlying structure of the MHLC tool remain, and\nthere is a need for testing structure across racial, ethnic,\nand/or cultural groups. Since application of a valid meas-\nurement device is imperative for studies identifying predic-\ntor variables in relation to health, further investigation of\nthe proper application and interpretation of the MHLC is\nneeded.\nIn this article, we review the published literature on\nexploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor\nConfirmatory factor analysis and\ninvariance testing between Blacks\nand Whites of the Multidimensional\nHealth Locus of Control scale\nMarianna LaNoue1, Abby Harvey*, Dawn Mautner1,\nBon Ku2 and Kevin Scott1\n Keywords\nconfirmatory factor analysis, health locus of control, invariance testing, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control\nDepartment of Family and Community Medicine, Thomas Jefferson\nUniversity, USA\n2Department of Emergency Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, USA\n*Dr. Harvey is currently not affiliated to any university.\nCorresponding author:\nMarianna LaNoue, Department of Family & Community Medicine,\nSidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University,\nEmail: Marianna.lanoue@jefferson.edu\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nanalysis (CFA) of the MHLC scale and then present a CFA\nof the scale performed on data collected in a large urban\nsample. We also provide evidence bearing on the factor\nstructure and mean differences between Black and White\nrespondents in our sample.\nThe MHLC scale focuses on the individual difference\nvariable LOC specifically as it pertains to health conditions\nand/or health-related behaviors (Wallston et al., 1976). It\ncomprises three subscales: the Internal subscale represents\nthe degree to which a person believes he or she is in control\nof his or her own health. The Powerful Others subscale\n(External) indicates the extent to which a person perceives\nthat others (e.g. doctors and important others) control his or\nher health, while the Chance subscale represents the degree\nto which one views fate and luck as controlling one's health\noutcomes. While not without debate, the construct validity\nof the MHLC appears to hold for some health behaviors,\nunder certain conditions. For example, those who have a\nhigh Chance health LOC orientation are likely to be less\nengaged in positive health behaviors, whereas those high\non the Internal dimension are more likely to have a health-\noriented approach (Ludenia and Donham, 1983; Norman\nand Bennett, 1996). Researchers have demonstrated a rela-\ntionship between health LOC and patients' healthcare utili-\nzation in specific contexts (Bazargan et al., 1998; Chambers\nhigher on the Powerful Others and/or Chance dimensions\nwere likely to have higher utilization rates, while those who\nscored higher on the Internal construct were likely to have\nfewer visits to the ED, fewer hospital admissions, and\nfewer ambulatory physician visits (Bazargan et al., 1998;\nalso reported that patients with more of a Powerful Others\nlocus of control (PLOC) and/or Chance locus of control\n(CLOC) were likely to have a higher incidence of hospitali-\nzations and physician visits. Additionally, patients' PLOC\nhas been shown to positively correlate with trust in physi-\nThe MHLC scale\nWe conducted a thorough review of the literature, including\nunpublished studies, of EFA and CFA of the MHLC scale;\nhowever, this should not be construed as a systematic\nreview.\nThe MHLC scale has two equivalent versions--Form A\nhas typically been used with samples of generally healthy\nindividuals, while Form B has historically been used with\nparticipants faced with chronic illness(es) (Chaplin et al.,\nnearly equivalent based on strong correlations between the\nsubscales across forms (Wallston et al., 1978) and across\nstudies; thus, the research reviewed below concerning the\nfactor structure of the scale will be limited to only those\nstudies in which Form A and/or Form B was administered.\nWe omit discussion here of the more recent Form C,\ndesigned to be used with patients who have an existing\nmedical condition and assesses health LOC specific to\none's illness or disease (Wallston et al., 1994). We also omit\ndiscussion here of the final member of the family of MHLC\ninstruments, the God Locus of Health Control (Wallston\nFactor structure\nThe current three-subscale structure implies that there are\nthree underlying dimensions being measured with the 18\nitems, and many studies have supported this structure.\nHowever, there is also support for a two-factor structure,\nwhich generally suggests that items comprising the\nPowerful Others external and Chance external LOC sub-\nscales arise from the same underlying latent variable. Our\nliterature review did not unequivocally support either a\ntwo- or a three-factor model structure. We found 15 EFA\nstudies, 8 CFA studies, and 2 studies that presented both\nEFA and CFA of the scale. These studies are reviewed\nbelow and summarized in Table 1. Of note in this review is\nthat of the eight CFA studies we found, six used sample\nTwo-factor model structure: EFA\nmembers at a psychiatric hospital and reported high item-\nfactor loadings for the Internal subscale (for both Forms A\nand B), but a less clear distinction between the item-factor\nloadings for the Chance and Powerful Others latent varia-\ninvestigated the factor structure of the MHLC (Form A\nonly), among 146 chronic cigarette smokers (53 men) and\n107 inpatients staying at a rehabilitation unit. Based on\ntheir results, Coelho concluded that there was a lack of sup-\nport for the MHLC as a three-dimensional construct; rather,\na two-dimensional construct consisted of an Internal factor\nand a Powerful Others factor provided a better fit.

(Continued)\n6 Health Psychology Open \noriginally extracted three factors with eigenvalues above 1,\nalthough the third factor explained only 6.9\npercent of the\nvariance; in addition, the Powerful Others and Chance sub-\nscales were highly correlated, and the factor structure sug-\ngested a great deal of overlap between these dimensions.\nThus, the authors forced a two-factor solution that explained\n41percent of the total variance: Powerful Others and Chance\nloaded on Factor 1 and Internal loaded on Factor 2. They\nconcluded support for a two-factor model where Powerful\nOthers and Chance represented an external health LOC.\nAn EFA performed on data collected from 152 first-year\nmedical and dental students who had completed Form A\nalso produced a two-factor structure with evidence for an\nInternal factor and a Powerful Others factor; a Chance fac-\ntor was less evident (Winefield, 1982). As a second study,\nWinefield (1982) compared the responses on Form A of the\nMHLC from 53 patients who had recently suffered myocar-\ndial infarction (MI) to 52 participants serving as controls.\nAlthough a factor model was not analyzed, Winefield's\nfindings were still informative as he found that MI patients,\nwho were both older and of lower average social status,\nscored higher on the Powerful Others domain, but not the\nInternal or Chance domains, compared to the control par-\nticipants. Furthermore, when Winefield followed up with\nmonths after their discharge from\nthe hospital, test\u00adretest scores indicated that the Internal\nand Powerful Others dimensions remained stable over\ntime, whereas the Chance dimension did not.\nFinally, in a longitudinal study (Stanton et al., 1995)\nconducted with adolescents from New Zealand, a principal\ncomponent factor analysis provided support for a two-fac-\ntor model solution when participants were both aged 13 and\n15years. However, the composition of the two-factor model\nsolutions at the two different time points varied. At age 13,\nthe majority of Internal and Powerful Others items loaded\non Factor 1, and Chance items along with two Powerful\nOthers items loaded on Factor 2. At the age of 15\nyears,\nInternal and Chance items loaded on Factor 1, and Powerful\nOthers items loaded on Factor 2. Based on their results, the\nauthors contended that there was some support for a three-\nfactor solution with a model structure similar to the MHLC\nscale (Wallston et al., 1978). We did not find any CFAs that\nsupported a two-factor model structure. Therefore, despite\nthe findings of the studies reviewed above, a clear rationale\nfor either rejecting or confirming a two-factor model struc-\nture was not demonstrated.\nThree-factor model structure: EFA\nOther researchers have continued to find support for the\nmore generally accepted three-factor model solution. An\nEFA principal component analysis conducted (with Form\nfound three factors which corresponded to the three-factor\nstructure proposed by Wallston et al. (1978). Similarly,\nMarshall et al. (1990) examined the factor structure of\nForm A of the MHLC using 181 Veterans Administration\nmedical outpatients. Results from the principal component\nanalysis with orthogonal rotation largely supported a three-\nfactor structure. Five factors with eigenvalues greater than\n1.0 were identified, although a scree plot indicated that\nthree factors should be extracted, consistent with Wallston\net al.'s (1978) proposed structure. In another study,\nBuckelew et al. (1990) found support for a three-factor\nmodel structure of the MHLC using EFA with oblique rota-\ntion performed on data from 160 participants referred to a\npain management center.\nAn EFA was also performed by Casey et al. (1993) using\nprincipal component analysis with varimax rotation on 678\nparticipants who completed Form A. Three factors were\nextracted which provided support for Wallston et al.'s\n(1978) proposed three-factor model. Similarly, Hartke and\nport for a three-factor structure using a principal axis factor\nanalysis with oblimin rotation. Gala et al.(1995) reported\nsupport for the three-factor model structure with a non-clin-\nical sample of 524 participants who completed both Forms\nA and B, approximately 4\u00ad6\ndays apart. Their EFA with\nvarimax rotation was able to account for 42percent of the\ntotal variance. Paine et al. (1994) also conducted a principal\naxis factor analysis with oblimin rotation which produced\na three-factor structure similar to the one proposed by\nWallston et al. (1978). These results were produced in a\nsample of 280 middle-class Brazilians who completed an\nadapted version of Forms A and B combined. Russell and\nThey administered both Forms A and B and then combined\nthe scales for a total of 36 items in order to have higher reli-\nabilities for each subscale. Using the principal axis method,\nthree factors were extracted that corresponded with Internal,\nPowerful Others, and Chance.\nThree-factor model structure: CFA\nHewson and Charlton (2005) conducted a CFA for both an\nInternet administration (N\n=\ntion (N\n=\n200) separately. Given previous findings that a\ntwo-factor structure may be a better fit for the MHLC\n(Chaplin et al., 2001), both a two-factor and a three-factor\nCFAs were specified for the Internet sample and paper sam-\nple separately. Results illustrated that the three-factor struc-\nture model provided the best fit for both the Internet and\npaper data, although neither CFA produced good model fit,\nand both analyses had a significant chi-square, despite the\nrelatively small sample sizes.\nRobinson-Whelen and Storandt (1992) performed a\nhad completed Form B. The CFA on the non-diabetic sam-\nple provided adequate support for a three-factor model,\nalthough they suggested that four items be eliminated to\nfrom analyses, and the models were refit to the remaining\nLaNoue et al. 7\n14 of the original 18 items from the MHLC; a fairly good\nfit to the three-factor model was found for both the diabetic\nand the non-diabetic samples. Similar to Robinson-Whelen\nand Storandt, Kelly et al. (2006) reported reasonable sup-\nport for the three-factor model structure among individuals\nwith osteoarthritis, after Items 7 and 8 were removed from\nthe analyses. Moreover, they detected no differences in\nmodel structure between men and women. Also, Fasol et al.\nthree-factor model once Items 7 and 15 were omitted from\nthe model structure. Gehlert and Chang (1998) conducted a\nCFA with 143 epileptic patients who completed Form A\nand found an acceptable fit for the model in which all items\non the scale loaded onto their a priori subscale.\nMore recently, Hubley and Wagner (2004) conducted a\nCFA with 245 non-clinical participants using both Forms A\nand B. The CFA using a three-factor model for Form A pro-\nduced a marginal fit; however, the CFA for Form B did not\nshow adequate fit.\nNone of the reviewed CFAstudies support an unambigu-\nous model structure for the MHLC. Additionally, no sub-\nstantive studies of measurement invariance with the MHLC\nhave been published, with the exception of the study\ndescribed below, and the study conducted by Malcarne\net al. (2005), described in the next section. Neither of these\ndefinitively supports a three-factor model.\nTalbot et al. (1996) conducted two CFAs in order to\ncompare the three-factor structure to a two-factor structure\nwhich has been supported by research (Coelho, 1985;\nWinefield, 1982). These investigators used a non-clinical\ngroup of college students (N\n=\ngroup of diabetics (N=132), and all participants completed\nForm A. Results from the CFAs demonstrated that neither\nthe two-factor model nor the three-factor model provided a\ngood fit to the data, although the fit of the three-factor\nmodel was better. Moreover, with invariance testing, Talbot\net al. concluded that there were differences in the structure\nof the MHLC between the two samples.\nThree-factor model structure: multiple analyses\nWall et al. (1989) performed both an EFA and a CFA on\nForms A and B averaged together using 60 psychiatric\npatients. The EFA component of the analysis suggested three\nfactors--Internal, Chance, and Powerful Others, with all\nitems loaded on their a priori subscales. The CFA found \"rea-\nsonable support\" for a three-factor structure of the MHLC.\nMalcarne et al. (2005) also conducted a CFA and an\nEFA. Importantly, despite the growing size of the non-\nWhite population in the United States, Malcarne et al. were\nthe first--and we believe to date the only--investigators to\nconduct a CFA separately for individuals (college students)\nfrom different racial and ethnic groups (1122 Caucasian\nAmericans) who completed Form A of the MHLC. In this\nstudy, fit indicators did not demonstrate a good fit to the\nthree-factor model in any of the three ethnic groups. Next,\nMalcarne et al. conducted EFAs using varimax rotation and\nfound evidence for the three dimensions of the MHLC\nscale across all three ethnic groups. However, each dimen-\nsion was represented with only three items, rather than the\nmost commonly used six-item format.\nPurpose of this research\nAs reviewed above, CFA studies of the MHLC have not been\nconsistent in their support of a specific factor structure. Also,\nwith the exception of Malcarne et al. (2005) and the Kelly\net al. (2006), sample sizes for the CFA studies have tended to\nbe small and within specialized samples (e.g. college students\nonly or inpatients). Importantly, we note a dearth of studies\ninvestigating factorial invariance of the MHLC across ethnic/\nracial groups, with the exceptions noted above, despite a\nrecent call for more cultural sensitivity in the MHLC scale\n(Luszczynska and Schwarzer, 2005) and despite the existence\nof an extensive and growing body of literature documenting\nracial and ethnic differences in health beliefs (Ayalon and\nwhich, although it is a CFA, we excluded from our review as\nit was based on the MHLC Form C.\nThe literature further demonstrates that differences in\nhealth beliefs are associated with differences in health\nbehaviors. For example, racial differences in cancer screen-\ning behavior relative to mammography have been docu-\nmented (Harmon et al., 2014), as have differences in colon\ncancer and prostate screening (Harmon et al., 2014), mental\nhealth screening and treatment preferences (Jimenez et al.,\nBlacks and Whites, differences which have implicated\nhealth beliefs explicitly.\nGiven the lack of definitive findings in the literature, we\nsought to confirm a three-item latent variable structure for\nthe MHLC in a large sample. Our analysis sought to investi-\ngate between-group differences in the MHLC scale struc-\nture within a larger and more general population of Black\nand White participants--adult visitors to two urban EDs. As\npart of examining differences in the scale across Black and\nWhite respondents, we tested for differences in the means\nbetween groups, as well. This research is the first of its kind\nto explore variations in the MHLC factor structure and\nscores specifically as a function of Black and White race.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe collected data from 863 adults in two urban EDs over a\nperiod of 5months. \"All-comers\" who presented in the ED\n8 Health Psychology Open \nwere approached during their visit and asked to take part in\na short paper-and-pencil survey. The refusal rate was\npercent. Participants were predominantly White\n\"other ethnicity.\" Additionally, 8.2\npercent self-identified\nas Hispanic (not mutually exclusive with race). A total of\n55percent of respondents were females. They ranged from\nyears, with a mean age of 48.8\nyears (standard\ndeviation (SD)=17.2years). For the purposes of this study,\nwe removed cases where respondents identified a race or\nethnicity other than \"White\" or \"Black\" (n=99). The sur-\nvey was conducted anonymously, and therefore compari-\nsons could not be made between demographics of those\nwho elected to participate and those who refused.\nPatients were approached in ED examination rooms by\nresearch assistants trained to collect data for ED studies.\nWritten consent was obtained, and no compensation was\noffered. Inclusion criteria were adult (aged >17years) and\nEnglish speaking. We excluded patients with high acuity as\ndetermined by the Emergency Severity Index. This study\nreceived approval from the Thomas Jefferson University\nInstitutional Review Board.\nMeasures\nAge and race were collected from all participants in the\nstudy. The MHLC scale\u00adForm B was administered. In this\nsample, the scale showed moderate internal consistency:\nCronbach's alpha for the total scale was .70; Cronbach's\nalpha for the individual subscales was .64 (Internal), .57\n(Chance), and .67 (Powerful Others).\nDesign and analysis\nDescriptive analyses and data cleaning were performed in\nIBM SPSS, version 22. We compared our samples' sub-\nscale means to published normative MHLC data and com-\npared the Black and White samples to each other, using\nindependent-samples t-tests. CFA and invariance testing\nwere performed in the IBM SPSS AMOS software, version\nData screening\nA total of 23 cases were removed for missing data. We\nexamined the distributions of each item individually\nthrough visual inspection of box-and-whisker plots for out-\nliers, and through calculation of each item's skew/standard\nerror and kurtosis/standard error ratios; 28 cases with ratios\n>2 were removed this way. We also examined the subscale\ndistributions for normality for the evaluation of the assump-\ntions of the t-test; all subscales met this assumption.\nItems within each subscale of the three-factor model\nwere examined for multicollinearity through a series of\nregressions, using a single item as the criterion variable,\nand all the other items from that subscale as predictors. The\nR2 for these models was used for evidence of multicolline-\narity, with a cut-off value of >.80. No models exceeded this\nthreshold (no model had an R2 value >.30). We also calcu-\nlated Mardia's coefficient for multivariate normality and\nused a rule of thumb of -3 to +3 for skew and -7 to +7 for\nkurtosis. We removed an additional 52 cases to correct for\nsignificant skew or kurtosis. The final analyzed N was 691.\nCFA\nWe used structural equation modeling (SEM) to perform\nthe CFA of the MHLC, beginning by specifying an a priori\nmodel. We specified the three-factor model of the instru-\nment corresponding to the latent variables Internal locus\nof control (ILOC), PLOC, and CLOC, with the six model-\nbased items (specified in each subscale) forced to load on\neach of these latent variables. We allowed all item vari-\nances, and latent variable covariances, to be freely esti-\nmated from the data. Although the original conception of\nthe MHLC was that the Internal and Powerful Others sub-\nscales were orthogonal (Wallston et al., 1976), we made\nthe decision to allow the latent variables to be correlated\nbased on the reviewed literature (Paine et al., 1994;\nRussell and Ludenia, 1983) and the theoretical rationale\nthat these three types of loci of control are unlikely to\ndemonstrate complete orthogonality (Luszczynska and\nThis produced the a priori model shown in Figure 1 and\npresented as Model 1 in Table 2. The fit of this model was\nevaluated (as described below), and it was also compared to\nan \"independence model,\" which specifies all item indica-\ntors to load on one latent variable (Model 0 in Table 2).\nBecause any a priori model must fit better than a single-\nfactor model, the independence model was compared to the\na priori structural model as a first test in order to provide a\nbasis for testing more complex models.\nModel fit for the CFA\nWe used several commonly accepted measures to evaluate\nmodel fit. First, the 2 test for the model was reviewed,\nwhere desired values are non-significant. However, since 2\nis sensitive to large sample size, it is possible to obtain a\nlarge and significant value even when the fit of the model to\nthe data is acceptable. To address this, a widely used \"rule\nof thumb\" was also evaluated, the ratio of the 2 to its\ndegrees of freedom, which is suggested to reflect \"good fit\"\nat values <4.0 (Joreskog, 1993) and \"excellent fit\" at values\nWe also evaluated the adjusted \"goodness of fit\" index\n(AGFI), which provides a fit index by comparing the pro-\nportion of the observed covariance matrix that is explained\nby the model-implied covariance matrix (Kline, 2011). The\nTucker\u00adLewis index (TLI), which penalizes complexity,\nLaNoue et al. 9\nwas also used. Hu and Bentler (1999) recommend values\n>.95. The root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA) for each model was also evaluated. Hu and\nindicates good model fit.\nLogic of invariance testing\nIn this research, our goal for invariance testing was to\nexamine potential structural and measurement differences\nin the MHLC scale across two groups of participants--\nBlack and White respondents. In order to accomplish this,\nwe used a multigroup CFA (MGCFA) approach and fol-\nlowed guidance from Vandenburg and Lance (2000) and\nKline (2011). We took a \"model trimming\" approach to\ninvariance testing, where the baseline model for invariance\ntesting was specified as a fully unconstrained model (Model\n2 in Table 2), with all parameters allowed to vary freely\nwithin the two groups separately, thereby estimating two\ncomplete sets of parameter estimates from two sets of\nFigure 1.

This model reflects the extent to which\nthe a priori model structure fits the data when the groups\nare allowed to have their own parameter estimates. This\nmodel provides a test of configural invariance because\nwhen there are differences between groups in any parame-\nter estimates, this model should fit significantly better than\na model where all parameters are forced to equality in the\ncombined groups.\nAdequate fit was found for Model 2, indicating that the\nform of the structural model (item to latent variable rela-\ntionships) was invariant between Blacks and Whites.\nTherefore, increasingly restrictive nested models were fit-\nted to the data in steps, and change in fit was evaluated.\nThis nested model approach compares competing models\nagainst each other, where the nested model is obtained by\nfixing (to a specific value) or eliminating parameters from\nthe original model, thereby resulting in a simpler model\nwith more degrees of freedom (Joreskog, 1993). The spe-\ncific hierarchical nested model comparisons we evaluated\nare shown in Table 2.\nWe examined sets of parameter estimates separately to\ninvestigate which parameter estimates, if any, differed\nbetween the groups. We began by constraining all of the\nregression path coefficients from each item to its latent\nvariable to be equal across the groups, but freely estimating\nthe other parameters (the \"Measurement Weights\" model--\nModel 3 in Table 2). A finding that this model does not\nchange the fit compared to the first model, or improves it,\nsuggests that the regression path coefficient estimates are\nthe same between the groups.\nNext, we constrained the latent variable covariances to\nbe equal between the groups but allowed for beta coeffi-\ncients and item variances to be freely estimated within the\ngroups. If this model (Model 4 in Table 2) is a worse fit to\nthe data, the inference would be made that the groups likely\ndiffer in these coefficients.\nAt each step, a null hypothesis is tested that the more\nconstrained model (a \"smaller\" model with fewer estimated\nparameters) is a better fit to the data (Bollen, 1989). The\nchi-square difference test, \nD\n, was used at each step to\nevaluate changes in fit where\n \n\nD\n2 (more restrictive model)\n(less restrictive model), with\n= -\nd\ndf\ndf\n(more restrictive model)\n(less restrictive model)\n-\nResults\nComparisons to normative data\nOur combined sample had mean loci of control as follows:\nMInternal\nMChance\n=\n6.67). We compared these mean val-\nues to published normative data, specifically to Wallston\nand Wallston's (1981) original validation results and also to\nthe combined sample of 1206 osteoarthritis patients in the\nKelly et al. (2006) study, which we feel most closely resem-\nbles our sample. The results of the six independent groups'\nt-tests we performed are presented in Table 3 and indicated\nthat our sample scored significantly higher on both the\nChance and Powerful Others subscales than both compari-\nson samples (p<.001). Additionally, within our own sam-\nple, Black respondents scored significantly higher than\nWhite respondents on the CLOC subscale.\nCFA\nIn this sample, the CFA failed to confirm a three-factor\nstructure. Model fit was poor to marginal, with\nTable 3.

A Bonferroni-adjusted =.0042 was used to\nestablish statistical significance for each pairwise comparison.\n12 Health Psychology Open \n\"Constrained Model,\" Table 2). In addition to the fit, of\nnote in this model is the finding that the squared multiple\ncorrelation coefficients (R2s) describing the variance\nexplained in each item indicator by the presumed latent\nvariable to which it is specified to load ranged from a low\nof .08 (Item I1) to a high of .45 (Item C4), indicating that\nthe underlying latent variables are generally inadequate at\ncapturing item variance (Figure 1). All unstandardized path\ncoefficients were significant and in the predicted direc-\ntions, and the model converged using full maximum likeli-\nhood estimation.\nInvariance testing\nBecause the CFA of Model 1 suggested marginal fit, we\nused this information as a starting point in invariance test-\ning. One-way poor fit may result in misspecification of the\nstructural model as identical in the two groups, so we next\nestimated a model which allowed for all parameter esti-\nmates to be estimated freely within the groups separately in\na MGCFA (Model 2). The fit of this model was evaluated\nAGFI=.896. Finding that this model is adequate fit to the\ndata suggests configural invariance, that is, the patterns of\nlatent variables, covariances, and item loadings are the\nsame across groups. Additionally, finding that this model is\na better fit than one which constrains all model coefficients\nto be equal across groups suggests that some estimates are\nlikely not the same between the groups and provides the\nrationale for further invariance testing.\nNext, we investigated a model in which all unstandard-\nized regression weights (indicator to latent paths) were con-\nstrained to be equal between the groups, while the other\nmodel parameters were estimated individually, commonly\ncalled a \"measurement weights\" model (Model 3) and com-\npared it to Model 2 as a test of metric invariance. This com-\nequality of regression coefficients between the groups.\nNext, we evaluated a model that constrained the latent\nvariable covariances to be equal but allowed the other\nparameter estimates to differ between the groups. Model 4\nwas compared to Model 2, and that comparison was sig-\n<\n.001, indicating that the latent\nvariable covariances differ between the groups. In these\ndata, all the covariances were significantly different\nacross the groups; for relationships between the CLOC\nand PLOC latent variables, Z=3.92, p<.01; between the\nCLOC and ILOC latent variables, Z=3.48, p<.01; and\nBlack respondents, the correlations between the latent\nvariables were CLOC\u00adILOC=-.20, CLOC\u00adPLOC=.31,\nand ILOC\u00adPLOC=.27. In White participants, the correla-\ntions were CLOC\u00adILOC=.10, CLOC\u00adPLOC=.53, and\n=\n.52. See Figure 2 for all coefficients in\nboth groups separately.\nBecause of the evidence for invariance in latent variable\ncovariances, we did not proceed to a test of variance/covar-\niance invariance because it is a more restrictive model.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we (1) reviewed the published literature on\nthe factor structure of the MHLC scale, (2) analyzed MHLC\ndata collected from \"all comers\" in two urban EDs to com-\npare means across studies and between Black and White\nrespondents in our sample, (3) conducted a CFA for a three-\nfactor model structure, and (4) performed invariance test-\ning of the instrument across Black and White respondents.\nOur analyses found significant mean differences\nbetween Black and White respondents in the CLOC sub-\nscale, consistent with other published research. It is a rela-\ntively common finding in the literature that Black\nrespondents hold higher \"chance\" control beliefs about\ntheir health. For example, racial differences in cancer\nscreening behavior relative to mammography are well doc-\numented (Harmon et al., 2014), which are associated with\nAfrican-American women's higher CLOC about breast\ncancer (Barroso et al., 2000). A large study focused on\nhealth beliefs among African-American participants spe-\ncifically showed that 30\npercent of respondents indicated\nthat their health was primarily based on fate or destiny\n(Lewis and Green, 2000). There are also documented dif-\nferences in colon cancer and prostate screening (Harmon\net al., 2014), mental health screening and treatment prefer-\nences (Jimenez et al., 2013), and diabetes self-care (Johnson\net al., 2014) between African-Americans and Caucasians,\ndifferences which have implicated health beliefs particu-\nlarly. Also of note in the comparison of our sample to two\nnormative samples are the significantly higher Chance\nexternality and Powerful Others externality loci of control\nin our sample. We reason that this reflects the fact that our\ndata were collected in ED settings, which may bias the\nsample toward those individuals with a greater likelihood\nof holding these control beliefs.\nOn the basis of the literature review and our analyses,\nwe conclude that the latent variable structure of the MHLC\nscale remains in question. One possibility for this may be\nsmall sample sizes in many of both the EFA and the CFA\nstudies (see Table 1). A low item-to-person ratio is undesir-\nable in factor analysis and can produce sample specific and\nungeneralizable results. Another potential reason for differ-\ning findings across the studies with respect to model fit for\nlatent variable structure may be differences in latent varia-\nble structure or item functioning across groups, a possibil-\nity which can be addressed with invariance testing. We\nconfirmed in our data that models which permitted differ-\nences in factor loadings based on respondent race (Models\n2\u00ad4 in Table 2) were a better fit than a more constrained\nmodel (Model 1 in Table 2), indicating differences in model\ncoefficients between groups.\nOur CFA results failed to confirm a three-factor model.\nThe three-factor model yielded only marginal-to-poor fit of\nthe data to the model. Because we were moving forward\nwith invariance testing, we did not attempt to re-specify\nthis model to improve fit, although examination of the\nmodification indices suggested that the residual terms for\nthe items are highly correlated with each other, and with the\nlatent variables, consistent with our finding that the total\nproportions of variance accounted for in the items by their\nlatent variables is low overall.\nThe results of invariance testing demonstrated that\nallowing parameter estimates to vary between Black and\nWhite participants produces a better fitting model than\nconstraining them to be equal across the groups, providing\nevidence for differences in model coefficients between\ngroups. To follow up, we first established that a model con-\nstraining the regression coefficients to be equal between\ngroups does not worsen model fit relative to the model\nwhere all parameters are freely estimated, although this dif-\nference in model fit was marginally significant (p=.072).\nWe interpreted this as evidence of metric invariance despite\nthe marginally significant 2 difference test for two reasons:\nfirst, the individual pairwise comparisons of beta coeffi-\ncient parameter estimates were themselves all non-signifi-\ncant, and the 2 difference test between Models 2 and 3 was\nnon-significant. This result allows for the inference that the\nFigure 2. Results of the multigroup CFA analysis showing all coefficients estimated within the groups separately. Bolded\ncoefficients were estimated within the sample of Black respondents.\n14 Health Psychology Open \nitems are interpreted the same between the racial groups\ninvestigated in our study.\nNext, we constrained the latent variable covariances to\nbe equal across groups but allowed all other parameters to\nbe freely estimated. This model was a significantly worse\nfit to the data than the model allowing all parameters to be\nfreely estimated. Pairwise comparisons of estimates\nrevealed that all the covariances were significantly differ-\nent between groups, and in fact, for the CLOC\u00adILOC latent\nvariable relationship, these coefficients were in the oppo-\nsite directions. Indeed, our data indicate that for White\nrespondents, these constructs are significantly inversely\nrelated, while for Black respondents, they are positively\nrelated. This is a striking finding, indicating that the rela-\ntionships among these constructs should be investigated\nfurther and in particular investigated with potential\nbetween-group differences made explicit. This finding par-\ntially explains the apparent orthogonality of the latent vari-\nables when race is not accounted for, as in Figure 1 which\nshows a near zero correlation and which is a common\nassumption in the literature. Furthermore, this finding is\nconsistent with some of the published literature which finds\na chance external orientation associated with an internal\norientation, such as O'Looney and Barrett (1983) which\nfound a Chance\u00adInternal factor in males only. Also, O'Hea\net al. (2009) reported that a Powerful Others\u00addoctors factor\nand an internal factor are not only positively related in their\nall low-socioeconomic status (SES) African-American\npatients but in fact form the same factor (with the caveat\nthat their factor solution included the \"god\" LOC subscale\nand so was different from the typical three-factor solution).\nThey interpret this to mean that in their sample, internal\ncontrol beliefs are confounded with control beliefs about\nthe healthcare system, an interesting suggestion worthy of\nfuture research.\nDifferences in item functioning (i.e. metric invariance)\nare potentially difficult to address when using the scale in\npractice, as they imply different meanings of the underlying\ndimensions between groups--a threat to construct validity.\nIn our study, this hypothesis could not be ruled out defini-\ntively and so we recommend that Black/White comparisons\nof mean scores on the MHLC be interpreted with caution\nand when possible be accompanied with item mean com-\nparisons as well. Studies using MHLC mean scores should\nalso consider race as an analytic covariate and should con-\nsider adding interaction terms into statistical models. Of\nnote, although we do not present the data here, these data\nwere derived from a larger study of the associations between\nMHLC subscales and ED visits and hospital admissions\n(Mautner et al., 2015). In that study, we did use race as a\ncovariate for analyses because of the finding that the race\nwas significantly associated with both ILOC and CLOC and\nwith both outcome variables. Finding that the subscales are\ndifferentially related to outcomes between groups provides\nadditional evidence of potential problems with construct\nvalidity with the MHLC. Further invariance testing should\ninclude a test of the hypothesis of strong scalar invariance\nwhich we did not test here. This test would speak more\ndirectly to analyses which attempt to directly compare\nBlack/White mean scores on MHLC subscales.\nThe issue of the non-equivalency of latent variable\ncovariances is less of a problem for the use of the scale in\npractice, but does imply that more work is needed on the\ntheory of health LOC and health LOC differences between\nBlack and White populations, empirical work which appears\nto be underway, as we review above. Factor analytic studies\nshould begin with a non-orthogonal rotation of the factors.\nAdditionally, the God LOC subscale could be considered in\nstudies with Black participants to potentially attribute cor-\nrectly the overlap between the Chance/Powerful Others ori-\nentation and the Internal orientation. Finally, although we\nonly undertook confirmatory analyses here, EFA studies\nshould be undertaken to confirm the dimensional invariance\nof the MHLC between Black and White respondents.\nThe results of this study are limited in generalizability to\nurban settings. Furthermore, there is a suggestion in these\ndata that our sample overrepresented those with a high\nCLOC and high PLOC, not surprising given that these data\nwas collected in an ED. Therefore, caution should be used\ninterpreting these results beyond this setting.\n"
