Schwartz, H. Gilbert Welch\nBackground To make sense of the disease risks they face, people need basic facts about the magnitude of a particular\nrisk and how one risk compares with other risks. Unfortunately, this fundamental information is not read-\nily available to patients or physicians. We created simple one-page charts that present the 10-year chance\nof dying from various causes according to age, sex, and smoking status.\nMethods We used the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death Public Use File for 2004 and\ndata from the 2004 US Census to calculate age- and sex-specific death rates for various causes of death.\nWe then combined data on smoking prevalence (from the National Health Interview Survey) and the rela-\ntive risks of death from various causes for smokers vs never smokers (from the American Cancer Society's\nCancer Prevention Study-II) to determine age-, sex-, and smoking-specific death rates. Finally, we accumu-\nlated these risks for various starting ages in a series of 10-year life tables. The charts present the 10-year\nrisks of dying from heart disease; stroke; lung, colon, breast, cervical, ovarian, and prostate cancer; pneu-\nmonia; influenza; AIDS; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; accidents; and all causes.\nResults At all ages, the 10-year risk of death from all causes combined is higher for men than women. The effect\nof smoking on the chance of dying is similar to the effect of adding 5 to 10 years of age: for example, a\n55-year-old man who smokes has about the same 10-year risk of death from all causes as a 65-year-old\nman who never smoked (ie, 178 vs 176 of 1000 men, respectively). For men who never smoked, heart dis-\nease death represents the single largest cause of death from age 50 on and the chance of dying from\nheart disease exceeds the chances of dying from lung, colon, and prostate cancers combined at every age.\nFor men who currently smoke, the chance of dying from lung cancer is of the same order of magnitude\nas the chance dying from heart disease and after age 50 it is about 10 times greater than the chance of\ndying from prostate or colon cancer. For women who have never smoked, the magnitudes of the 10-year\nrisks of death from breast cancer and heart disease are similar until age 60; from this age on, heart disease\nrepresents the single largest cause of death. For women who currently smoke, the chance of dying from\nheart disease or lung cancer exceeds the chance of dying from breast cancer from age 40 on (and does so\nby at least a factor of 5 after age 55).\nConclusion The availability of simple charts with consistent data presentations of important causes of death may\nfacilitate discussion about disease risk between physicians and their patients and help highlight the dan-\ngers of smoking.\nthe reader's attention--neither provided a complete statement of\nrisk, that is, one that addresses the probability of dying from the\nspecific cancer over a defined time period. And neither message\nput this risk in the context of other important health risks, such as\nthe risk of dying from heart disease or lung cancer (the risks of both\nare substantially higher than those for cervical or prostate cancer).\nThe point of presenting these examples is not to minimize the\ntragedies of cervical or prostate cancer deaths but rather to high-\nlight the importance of providing the information needed to make\nrisk messages useful.\nUseful messages about health risks should address two ques-\ntions: how big is my risk and how does this risk compare with other\nrisks? Approximately 5 years ago, we published a set of risk charts\nthat were intended to address both of these questions (3). The\ncharts presented estimates of an individual's chance of dying within\nthe next 10 years from a variety of causes according to his or her\nage, sex, and smoking status--arguably the three characteristics\nthat have the most important influence on mortality. The charts\nprovided context by allowing people to compare their chances of\ndying at different ages across disease categories and in the context\nof all-cause mortality. These charts have been posted on the Web\nsite of a major association of primary care physicians for point-of-\ncare use by physicians (4), and they were published by a national\nnewspaper (which reported that the charts inspired an editor of a\nmajor medical journal to quit smoking) (5). We now update these\ncharts with a revised algorithm that takes into account a valid\nmethodologic concern about our original calculations (6) and\nincorporates the most recent national mortality data available.\nMethods\nOverview\nOur goal was to create simple one-page charts that put disease risk\nin context by placing the 10-year chance of dying from various\ncauses side by side. To account for the influence of sex, we created\nseparate charts for men and women. To account for the influence\nof age on mortality, the charts provide separate estimates for 5-year\nincrements of age. To account for the influence of smoking, the\ncharts provide separate estimates for people who currently smoke,\npeople who used to smoke, and people who never smoked.\nChart Design\nTo make the charts easy to understand, we limited the amount of\ndata presented and paid particular attention to their format. The\ncharts present data on the 10-year chance of dying to provide a\nreasonable window into the future; to avoid data overload and to\nlimit each chart to a single page, the charts present the starting age\non up to age 75 years) rather than every year of age. We repre-\nsented the mortality data as counts with a stable denominator (eg,\nsome evidence (7\u00ad10) suggests that this format is easiest to under-\nstand. To further simplify the appearance of the charts, we\nrounded the number of deaths to the nearest whole number and\nshaded cells in which the death rate was less than 1 per 1000.\nFinally, to help clarify the contribution of each individual cause of\ndeath, the charts include the chance of dying from all causes\ncombined.\nSelected Causes of Death\nThe risk charts include the most common causes of death (eg, heart\ndisease, lung cancer) as well as causes of death that have received\nparticular attention in the media (eg, AIDS, ovarian cancer). The\ncharts present 10 causes of death for men and 12 for women. Nine\nof the causes of death apply to both sexes: heart disease, stroke, lung\ncancer, colon cancer, pneumonia, flu, AIDS, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD), and accidents. The sex-specific causes\nare prostate cancer (for men) and breast, cervical, and ovarian can-\ncer (for women).\nWe grouped individual causes of death into disease categories\nusing standard National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)\ngroupings [ie, based on the list of the 358 most common causes\nPrior knowledge\nThe information that people receive about their risk of disease is\noften incomplete because it does not address the probability of\ndying from the specific disease over a defined time period, nor does\nit put the risk into the context of other important health risks.\nStudy design\nNational census and health data for 2004 were used to create sim-\nple one-page charts that present the 10-year chance of dying,\naccording to age, sex, and smoking status, from heart disease;\nstroke; lung, colon, breast, cervical, ovarian, and prostate cancer;\npneumonia; influenza; AIDS; chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-\nease; accidents; and all causes.\nContribution\nAt all ages, the 10-year risk of death from all causes combined is\nhigher for men than women. The effect of smoking on the chance\nof dying is similar to the effect of adding 5 to 10 years of age. For\nmen who never smoked, heart disease death represents the single\nlargest cause of death from age 50 on. For men who currently\nsmoke, the chance of dying from lung cancer is of the same order\nof magnitude as the chance of dying from heart disease from age\n60 on, and after age 50, it is 10 times greater than the chance of\ndying from prostate or colon cancer. For women who never\nsmoked, the 10-year risks of death from breast cancer and heart\ndisease are similar until age 60; from this age on, heart disease\nrepresents the single largest cause of death. For women who cur-\nrently smoke, the chance of dying from heart disease or lung cancer\nexceeds the chance of dying from breast cancer from age 40 on.\nImplications\nThe availability of simple charts with consistent data presentations\nof important causes of death may facilitate discussion about dis-\nease risk between physicians and their patients and help highlight\nthe dangers of smoking.\nLimitations\nThe mortality data that were used to calculate cause-specific death\nrates were derived from death certificates and are only as good as the\ndeath certificates. Relative risks of death from various causes were\nfrom the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study-II, which\nrepresent a single--albeit very large--cohort study. Risk estimates\nwere not personalized beyond age, sex, and smoking status.\njnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 847\nof death (11); see Appendix 1]. Our only departure from the\nNCHS groupings was the creation of the category \"heart dis-\nease,\" which includes deaths from acute and chronic ischemic\nheart disease and associated complications (eg, congestive heart\nfailure and arrhythmia); the heart disease category does not\ninclude other heart disease deaths (eg, endocarditis, valvular dis-\nease, and pericarditis).\nData Sources and Calculations\nFigure 1 summarizes our data sources and the four calculation steps\nwe used to produce the risk charts.\nStep 1: Calculate Age-, Sex-, and Cause-Specific Death\nRates. We calculated death rates for each sex, for each year of life\n(from age 35 through age 84), for all causes combined, and for each\nselected cause (ie, more than 1200 age-, sex-, and cause-specific\nrates). These age-, sex-, and cause-specific annual death rates for\n2004 were calculated using the following equation:\nAge-, sex-, cause-specific death rate\n= Deaths\nTOTAL\n/N\nTOTAL\n= Age- and sex-specific number of deaths from cause X in 2004/\nAge- and sex-specific population in 2004.\nWe used the NCHS Multiple Cause of Death Public Use File for\n2004 to obtain the numerator, that is, the number of deaths from\neach selected cause (and from all causes combined) among indi-\nviduals of a specific age and sex (12). The file contains informa-\ntion on all deaths in the United States and is based on death\ncertificates completed by each state [all states require the report-\ning of all deaths, and it is believed that more than 99% of all\ndeaths in the United States are registered by the states (13)]. A\ndeath certificate may list multiple causes of death; these causes\nare translated at NCHS into codes that are enumerated in the\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (available at\nhttp://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/). A computer pro-\ngram at NCHS assigns the underlying cause of death from the\nmultiple causes listed on each certificate. The risk charts are\nbased on the underlying cause of death. We used data from the\n2004 US Census to obtain the denominator, that is, the esti-\nmated midyear ( July 1, 2004) US resident population for each\nyear of age and sex (14).\nStep 2: Determine Age-, Sex-, and Cause-Specific Death Rates\nfor Never Smokers. The most challenging task of our analysis\nwas to apportion these death rates according to smoking status. As\nrecommended by Bach and Schrag (6), we modified our original\napproach for estimating risks by considering current smokers, for-\nmer smokers, and never smokers as distinct groups. We reasoned\nthat each age-, sex-, and cause-specific death rate is the weighted\naverage of the age-, sex-, and cause-specific death rates for never\nsmokers (NS), former smokers (FS), and current smokers (CS),\nwhere the weights reflect the proportion of the population in each\ngroup:\nAge-, sex-, cause-specific death rate\n= (% NS \u00d7 rate\nNS\n) + (% FS \u00d7 rate\nFS\n) + (% CS \u00d7 rate\nCS\n).\nThe death rates in the two smoking groups--that is, current smok-\ners and former smokers--were derived by multiplying the never\nsmokers death rate by the relative risks (RRs) associated with for-\nmer (RR\n) and current (RR\n):\nAge-, sex-, cause-specific death rate\n= (% NS \u00d7 rate\nNS\n) + % FS \u00d7 (rate\nNS\n\u00d7 RR\n) + % CS \u00d7 (rate\nNS\n\u00d7\nRR\n).\nFigure 1. Data sources and steps used to create the risk charts.\nWe then used an algebraic transformation (see Appendix 2) to solve\nthe following equation for the age-, sex-, and cause-specific death\nrates in never smokers:\nAge-, sex-, cause-specific death rate\nNS\n= Deaths\nTOTAL\n/{N\nTOTAL\n\u00d7 [% NS + (% FS x RR\n) + (% CS x\nRR\n)]}.\nTo solve this equation, we needed to know the prevalence of smok-\ning and the relative risk of death according to smoking status. We\nobtained the prevalence of smoking by sex and age (age categories:\nDisease Control and Prevention's definitions of smoking status\n(16): never smokers are people who have smoked fewer than 100\ncigarettes in their lifetime, former smokers are people who do not\nsmoke now but smoked at least 100 cigarettes in the past, and cur-\nrent smokers are people who smoke now and have smoked at least\n100 cigarettes in their lifetime.\nThe second input for the calculation was the relative risk of death\naccording to smoking status. We sought sex-specific relative risks of\ndeath for former and current smokers (vs never smokers) dying\nfrom diseases with well-established associations with smoking (heart\ndisease, stroke, COPD, lung cancer, pneumonia, and influenza) and\nfrom all causes combined. These were obtained from the American\nCancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II), a prospective\ncohort study of more than 1.2 million US adults aged 30 years or older\nthat began in 1982 (17). Because these relative risks were provided for\nonly very broad age categories, we requested and obtained further\nrefined, age-specific relative risks (in 5-year age categories beginning\nat age 35) from CPS-II (M. Thun, MD, personal communication).\nStep 3: Calculate Age-, Sex-, and Cause-Specific Death Rates\nfor Former and Current Smokers. We calculated age-specific\nannual death rates for former smokers by multiplying the age-spe-\ncific risk for never smokers by the relative risk of death for former\nvs never smokers. Similarly, we calculated age-specific annual\ndeath rates for current smokers using the relative risk of death for\ncurrent vs never smokers.\nStep 4: Accumulate the 10-Year Risks of Death for Each Cause\nfor Age-, Sex-, and Smoking-Specific Groups. We used previ-\nously described methods (18) to create separate 10-year life tables\nfor each specific cause of death and all causes combined for male\nand female never, former, and current smokers in each of the nine\nage categories, for a total of 648 life tables (ie, each of the 648\nnumbers displayed in the four charts reflect a unique life table).\nFor each year of age, we multiplied the number of people who\nwere alive at the beginning of the age interval by the disease-spe-\ncific death rate to obtain the number of disease-specific deaths.\nLikewise, we calculated the number of deaths from all causes in the\nage interval by using the all-cause death rates. We subtracted\ndeaths from all causes from the number of people who were alive\nat the beginning of the interval to obtain the number of people\nalive at the beginning of the next age interval. We then summed\nthe number of deaths over 10 years to obtain the 10-year probabil-\nity of death for each age in the risk chart:\nCause-specific 10-year risk of death\nage-, sex-, smoking-specific group\n= [\n\u00e5 (Alive\n\u00ad All Death\n) \u00d7 Disease death rate\ni\n] / Starting popu-\nFor example, we applied the all-cause death rate for a 70-year-old\nman who never smoked to calculate the total number of deaths\ndeaths). We then subtracted this number from 100000 to obtain\nthe population at risk for death in the subsequent year. We then\napplied the all-cause death rate calculated for 71-year-old men to\ndetermine the number of deaths over the next year and repeated\nthe process through the 10th year. In this way, we defined the\npopulation at risk for death at the beginning of each of 10 years.\nWe then applied the age-specific death rate for each individual\ncause of death to the population at risk at the beginning of each\nyear to get the number of disease-specific deaths. We obtained the\n10-year chance of dying from each cause by adding the number of\ndeaths in each of the 10 years divided by the starting population\npleted example for a current smoker's risk of lung cancer death and\ndeath from all causes combined is shown in Appendix 2.)\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe relative risks from CPS-II have been criticized--most notably\nby the tobacco industry--because they were not adjusted for\npotentially confounding socioeconomic characteristics. In res-\nponse to these criticisms, Thun et al. (19) pointed out that CPS-II\nparticipants, regardless of their smoking history, were fairly homo-\ngeneous, and they showed that adjusting for behavioral and other\ndemographic factors only minimally attenuated the relative risks\nfor smoking. To avoid overestimating the association between\nsmoking and death, we \"adjusted\" our age-specific relative risks by\napplying the average attenuation effect noted in the Thun et al.\n(19) analysis (on average, the association between current smoking\nand the various causes of mortality was reduced by 10%, eg, from\nrelative risk of 2.0 to a relative risk of 1.8). We assessed the effect\nof even greater adjustment (to allow for the possibility of substan-\ntial residual confounding) by conducting a sensitivity analysis.\nResults\nRisk Charts for Men\nFigure 2 is the risk chart for men who have never smoked and men\nwho currently smoke. In each age category, the top row shows risks\nfor never smokers and the bottom row shows risks for current smok-\ners. For men who have never smoked, accidents are the single largest\ncause of death until age 45, at which age accidents tie with heart dis-\nease as the largest cause of death; from age 50 on, the single largest\ncause of death is heart disease. Within each age group of never smok-\ners, the chances of dying in the next 10 years from lung, colon, and\nprostate cancer are of a similar order of magnitude until about age 70\nand do not exceed that for accidental deaths until after age 65.\nFor men who currently smoke, the chance of dying from heart\ndisease exceeds the chance of dying from each of the other causes\nuntil age 60, when it is surpassed by the chance of dying from lung\njnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 849\nFigure 2.

After age 50, the chance of dying from lung cancer exceeds\nthe chance of dying from colon or prostate cancer by a factor of\nabout 10. The chance of dying in the next 10 years from COPD is\nsimilar to the combined chances of dying from colon and prostate\ncancer until age 50 but then increases precipitously; by age 70, cur-\nrent smokers have a 45 in 1000 chance of dying from COPD in the\nnext 10 years--more than twice the combined chance of dying\nfrom colon and prostate cancer. The effect of smoking on the\nchance of dying is similar to the effect of adding 10 years of age: for\nexample, a 55-year-old man who smokes has about the same 10-\nyear risk of death from all causes as a 65-year-old man who never\nThe large increase in the chance of dying from all causes at\nolder ages among smokers makes it appear that smoking lowers\nthe risk of death for conditions that have no known relationship\nto cigarette smoking (ie, those for which the relative risk of\ndeath for current smokers vs never smokers is 1). For example,\nthe 10-year chance of dying from prostate cancer--a disease\nthat is not associated with cigarette smoking--is higher for a\n75-year-old man who never smoked than for one who currently\nThis finding should not be interpreted as suggesting that smok-\ning protects against prostate cancer or other causes of death in\nwhich the same phenomenon occurs (ie, colon cancer or acci-\ndents); instead, it simply reflects the impact of smoking on\ncompeting risks of death (20). That is, as more current smokers\ndie from smoking-related diseases, fewer current smokers\nremain who could die of non\u00adsmoking-related causes.\nFigure 3 is the risk chart for men who are former smokers. For\ncauses of death related to smoking, risks of death for former smok-\ners are intermediate between those of current smokers and those\nof never smokers.\nRisk Charts for Women\nFigure 4 displays the risk chart for women who have never smoked\nand women who currently smoke. At all ages, the chance of dying\nfrom all causes combined is lower for women than men with the\nsame smoking status. For women who have never smoked, the\nmagnitudes of the 10-year risks of death from breast cancer and\nheart disease are similar until age 60; from this age on, heart disease\nrepresents the single largest cause of death. Breast cancer is the\nleading cause of cancer death throughout the lifetimes of women\nwho never smoked.\nFor women who currently smoke, the chance of dying\nfrom heart disease or lung cancer exceeds the chance of dying from\nbreast cancer from age 40 on (and does so by at least a factor of 5\nafter age 55). By age 50, the chance of dying from lung cancer\nwomen will die in the next 10 years). The effect of smoking on the\nchance of dying is similar to the effect of adding 5 to 10 years of\nage: the 10-year chance of dying from all causes combined for a\n55-year-old woman who smokes is somewhere between that of a\n60-year-old woman who never smoked and a 65-year-old woman\ntively, will die in the next 10 years).\nThe spurious \"protective\" effect of smoking at older ages that\nis present in men is also present in women but is less dramatic.\nBecause of large competing risks of death from smoking-related\ndiseases at age 65 or older, women who smoke generally appear to\nhave a slightly lower chance of dying from breast, colon, or ovarian\ncancer than women who have never smoked, despite the lack of\nany known associations between smoking and these cancers.\nFigure 5 is the risk chart for women who are former smokers.\nFor causes of death related to smoking, risks of death for former\nsmokers are intermediate between those of current smokers and\nthose of never smokers.\nSensitivity Analysis\nIn analyses to address potential confounding of the smoking-\nassociated relative risks from CPS-II by socioeconomic status, we\nfound that reducing the relative risks by as much as 25% (eg, from\n2.0 to 1.5) had little effect on our results. On average, the calculated\n10-year chance of death was reduced by less than 10% for both men\nand women smokers.\nDiscussion\nWe created simple charts with age-, sex-, and smoking-specific\ndata about the chance of dying from various common causes in the\nnext 10 years. The charts are designed to put the chance of dying\nfrom a given disease in the context of the chances of dying from\nother diseases and of dying from all causes. The current risk charts\nrepresent a substantial improvement over the risk charts that we\npreviously published (3). The new risk charts use more recent data\nand age-specific relative risks and employ a different method to\naccount for smoking status (the earlier method combined former\nand never smokers, which distorted some risks; the new algorithm\ntreats never, former, and current smokers as separate groups).\nWe want to acknowledge three methodologic limitations of the\ncharts. First, cause-specific death rates require accurate attribution\nof death. Although we used the 2004 Multiple Cause of Death\nPublic Use File from the NCHS, the best available (and most\nrecent) national source of mortality data, these data are derived from\ndeath certificates. Death certificates are not always accurate nor is\nthe determination of the underlying cause of death (13). Nonetheless,\ndeath certificates are the standard source of mortality data in the\nUnited States (21). Second, our charts depend on the accuracy of the\nrelative risks from CPS-II. Concerns have been raised about residual\nconfounding by socioeconomic factors (19). However, our sensitiv-\nity analyses showed that reducing these relative risks by as much as\n25% (ie, moving the relative risks toward 1) had only a small effect\non the chance of death. Moreover, the CPS-II relative risks are the\ninputs used by the Centers for Disease Control (22) and the US\nSurgeon General (16) to estimate \"smoking attributable deaths.\"\nThird, we did not attempt to provide more personalized risk\nestimates. More personalized estimates, that is, estimates that\naccount for important disease risk factors, such as a strong family\nhistory of a certain disease or various behaviors or exposures,\nwould be useful if they generated reliable predictions (23).\nHowever, good mortality-specific risk prediction models are not\navailable for most diseases [lung cancer mortality being a notable\nexception (24)]. Furthermore, personalized estimates add practical\ncomplexities to implementation. For example, personalized\nAppendix 2.

This is done by rearranging the terms in the relative risk\nformula:\nRR\n= rate\nCS\n/rate\nNS\n; rate\nCS\n= RR\n\u00d7 rate\nNS\n.\nSubstituting values for lung cancer among 70-year-old men:\nrate\nCS\nAccumulate 10-year risk of death for age-, sex-, and cause-specific groups\nusing life tables. Here is the life table for 70-year-old men who currently smoke\n(to get former smokers, repeat step 3, but use relative risk for former smokers vs\nnever smokers).\nestimates would probably require a computer interface that allows\nusers to enter the requisite information; alternatively, users would\nhave to navigate multiple complex tables to find the right esti-\nmates. In fact, we believe that the simplicity of our charts represents\na distinct advantage over interactive computer applications: the\ncharts are inexpensive, can be used anywhere, and require no spe-\ncial hardware or trained personnel. Moreover, our charts account\nfor what are arguably the three most important risk factors for\ndeath: age, sex, and smoking.\nThe risk charts provide two basic elements that people need if\nthey are to make sense of the health threats they face: the magni-\ntude of the risk and some context. We hope that the availability of\nthese simple charts will facilitate physician\u00adpatient discussion\nabout disease risk and help people understand where to focus risk\nreduction efforts. The charts are posted electronically in a variety\nof formats (ie, as presented in this paper, as separate charts for\neach smoking category, and as single-page charts presenting all\nthe data in one place for men and women; see Supplementary\nFigures 1\u00ad10, available online). We encourage physicians (and\nothers) to post the charts in clinic offices or distribute them to\npatients for easy reference when decisions (such as cancer screen-\ning) are being made.\nFinally, the charts provide a compelling demonstration of the\nharms of cigarette smoking--the effect of smoking on mortality\nrisk is like adding 5 to 10 years of age. After publication of the first\nset of charts, we received many messages from patients, providers,\nand colleagues suggesting that the charts may be especially useful\nin smoking prevention and cessation efforts. Regardless of how the\ncharts are used, we believe that they will provide a much-needed\nperspective on health risks.\nAppendix 1.
