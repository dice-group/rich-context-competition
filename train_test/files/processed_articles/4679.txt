With reference toAntuchevicien\n(2005), it can be stated that the main reasons why the aban-\ndoned buildings and areas emerge are the changes in the\npolitical, social, and economic systems that are usually fol-\nlowed by the decline of the usual economic activities, the\ndecline in the number of jobs, and the consequent degrada-\ntion of the entire areas. Lithuania and other postcommunist\ncountries in Central and Eastern Europe are the relevant\nexamples of this case.\nThis article concentrates on the relicts of the Soviet rural\nlandscape, especially the agricultural areas with the extant\nfarm buildings (as far as the residential buildings related with\nthe collective farms usually maintain their original function,\nespecially in the proximity to the urban centers), in the areas\nof rural\u00adurban interface in Lithuania. The aim of the research\nwas to highlight the sociocultural, economic, ecological, and\naesthetic problems related with the relicts of the Soviet rural\nlandscapes in the areas of rural\u00adurban interface and to dem-\nonstrate their redevelopment potential by formulating the\nscenarios for integrating these areas and buildings into urban\ndevelopment using the case of Lithuania.\nThe methodologies applied for research include the review\nof literature, the preliminary surveys on site and recording in\nphotographs of the landscapes in the areas of rural\u00adurban\ninterface surrounding the largest cities and particularly the\ncity of Kaunas in Lithuania, and construction of the hypo-\nthetical scenarios. To understand better the sociocultural,\nsocioeconomic, and ecoaesthetic aspects related with aban-\ndoned agricultural properties of the Soviet era in Lithuania,\nthe sociological research was necessary. To our knowledge,\nno sociological research had fully addressed this sociocultural\naspect regarding Lithuanian landscape. To provide the pre-\nliminary answers to relevant questions, here we use the results\nof the pilot surveys of the farmers and general society of\nLithuania regarding the possibilities of reuse of agricultural\ncomplexes carried out by Rubikait (2013) in the frame of\nthis research. Fifty farmers and 100 respondents reflecting\ngeneral sociodemographic composition of the society were\nsurveyed using written questionnaires.\nThe contributions to new knowledge of this research con-\nsist in the following:\n1Kaunas University of Technology, Lithuania\n2UAB \"Betonika,\" Kaunas, Lithuania\nCorresponding Author:\nErika Zaleskiene, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture,\nDepartment of Architecture and Urbanism, Kaunas University of\nEmail: erika.zaleskiene@gmail.com\nUrbanization Influence on the Relicts of\nSoviet Rural Landscape: Case of Lithuania\nIndre Grazuleviciute-Vileniske1, Erika Zaleskiene1,\nGintare Baltrusaityte2, and Lauryna Rubikaite1\n Keywords\nrelicts of Soviet rural landscape, abandoned buildings, urbanization, rural\u00adurban interface, Lithuania\n2 SAGE Open\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 the focus on the relicts of the Soviet rural landscapes\n(territories and buildings) located in the \"marginal\"\n(Kavaliauskas, 2011) complex landscapes at the urban\nfringe;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 analysis of the interaction of urbanization with the\nspecific type of rural landscape, addressing the prob-\nlems of the relicts of the Soviet rural landscapes in the\nareas of rural\u00adurban interface comprehensively: from\nsocial, cultural, economic, aesthetic, and ecological\npoints of view;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 formulating the spectrum of hypothetical scenarios\nthat demonstrate the potentials of reuse of the areas\nand buildings under consideration systematically,\nwhich is rarely done in the postcommunist space.\nThe research outcomes, though mainly related with the\nLithuanian case, can be useful for other postcommunist\nstates and especially for the Central and Eastern European\ncountries.\nRural Landscape of the Soviet Period\nand Its Contemporary Relicts in\nLithuania\nIn the Central and Eastern European region, in general, and\nin Lithuania, in particular, the rural landscapes and the marks\nof different transformations in them play an important part in\net al., 2006). For example, today rural landscapes of different\nqualities embodying different historical transformations con-\nstitute the largest part of the territory of Lithuania (Bukantis\net al., 2008). As a contrast to landscapes shaped by the coher-\nent evolution, these landscapes still bear the significant\nmarks of countryside transformations caused by the subse-\nquent land reforms and the collective efforts of the popula-\ntion. According to the researchers, this type of landscape\ncharacter causes the landscape perception difficulties and\ncreates specific management and planning challenges. For\nexample, Palang et al. (2006) in their research on \"The\nForgotten Rural Landscapes of Central and Eastern Europe\"\nconcluded that\nquickly changing socioeconomic formations have encouraged\nalienation, as people are not able to identify themselves with\ntoo-rapidly-changing postmodern landscapes. The time barriers\nbetween the formations are so thick that people do not understand\nthe context of the former formations; meanwhile, the time layers\nare also so thin that new landscapes (both material and mental)\nhave had no time to become traditional. (p. 355)\nThis is particularly true with the Lithuanian rural land-\nscapes, especially those that are the object of our research:\nrelated with the complex and ambiguous Soviet period and\ncurrently experiencing the pressure of urbanization and the\nrapid change.\nFor the better understanding of the dynamics in the of\nLithuanian rural landscape, based on the analysis of develop-\nment of Lithuanian rural landscape and the crucial points of\ntoric Lithuanian rural landscape types, the relicts of which\ncan be seen in the country's landscape of today (Figure 1):\nikivalakinis (landscape developed before the land reform of\nthe 16th century), valakinis (landscape developed after the\nland reform of the 16th century), vienkieminis (landscape of\nthe interwar period), and kolukinis (landscape of the Soviet\nperiod). He notes that although ikivalakinis, valakinis, and\nvienkieminis landscapes have taken over and integrated\nmany features of preexisting landscape types and simultane-\nously acquired new features depending on the circumstances\nof the era, during the Soviet period, when the land was\nnationalized and large collective farms were created, the\nmost drastic landscape changes took place, and the landscape\ncharacter and functioning were strongly altered.\nTo understand better the reasons and the nature of the\nchanges of rural landscape and the peculiarities of the rural\u00ad\nurban interface of the Soviet period, it is necessary to look at\nthe ideological, economic, and social transformations of that\nera and the value system and historical conditions underlying\nthe radical changes in lifestyle and in the construction and\nfarming practices in the Soviet era. The still traditional soci-\nety with the continuous agricultural practices and the eco-\nnomics of the early capitalism of the pre\u00adWorld War II\nLithuania were drastically replaced with the society shaped\nby the ideology of socialism, where the collective values\nwere given the priority at the expense of individualism with\nthe attempt to create the just and classless society (Gentile,\nTammaru, & van Kempen, 2012) and with the centrally\nplanned economy and the fast modernization of agriculture\nand production and rapid industrialization and urbanization\nof the country.\nfunctional, aesthetic, and sociocultural features of the rural\nlandscape of the Soviet period. Based on his analysis, here\nwe distinguish the main aspects important to this research:\nIndustrial Scale\nThe Soviet period was characterized by the intensive devel-\nopment of industrial agricultural production in the rural\nareas. Growing crop and livestock on the industrial scale\nrequired building the large agricultural complexes and the\nspecialized farms with corresponding infrastructure.\nRadical Reorganization of the Settlements System\nThe structure and network of residential settlements in rural\nareas were altered accordingly: The functions of the settle-\nments have been changed; part of the existing historic settle-\nments were strongly modified and expanded, thus loosing\nauthenticity; the others were declared as nonperspective, and\nGrazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 3\ntheir development was not encouraged; many historic home-\nsteads strongly interconnected with the landscape were sim-\nply eliminated; and new concentrated settlements emerged.\nInterrupted Buildings and Planting Traditions\nNew building materials, such as silicate bricks, sharply con-\ntrasted both with traditional architecture and the green struc-\ntures.Numerousorchardsandnaturalgreeneryweredestroyed.\nEven if development of new rural settlements included parks\nand other public greenery, there were many cases when settle-\nments were built in the open fields without any green areas\nwith trees and shrubs. New settlements were not created in\nharmony with the existing landscape forms, but on the con-\ntrary, based on the Soviet ideology, expressed the efficiency\nand standardization of the living environment.\nRadical Change in the Landscape's Structure and\nCharacter\nAfter cutting down trees and shrubs and implementing the\nlarge melioration projects, the large, regular, and uniform open\nareas with sparsely located tracts of wood were created. Even\nif economically and technically effective, these spaces were\nboth disorientating for the observer and aesthetically unat-\ntractive and ecologically unsustainable, creating monocultural\nfields and causing land degradation. The industrial agricultural\nproduction complexes of unusual shapes, materials and large\nvolumes, engineering infrastructure (roads, electricity trans-\nmission lines), melioration and irrigation equipment, and\nother interventions had radically transformed Lithuanian land-\nscape into the plain agricultural and industrial environments.\nRestructuring of the landscapes and the settlement system\ncaused the decline of regional ethnographic identities and\ndistinctiveness.\nSome features of urbanization and the transformations of\nrural\u00adurban interface of the Soviet era have to be mentioned as\nwell. The gradual, compact, and moderate in size and pace\nurban growth and the insignificant or moderate visual rural\u00ad\nurban interface and clear visual, social, cultural, and economic\nlimits between the urban settlements and the countryside of\nthe interwar Lithuania were replaced with the rapid and large\nscale, centrally planned and nondemocratic urban growth,\nbased on the industrialization of the construction sector, the\nstrict functional zoning, and \"standardized housing estates,\nwhose ubiquitousness is one of the most striking visual fea-\ntures of the Central and Eastern European city\" (Gentile et al.,\nthe city, characterized by the strict lines and brutal aesthetics\nof the concrete blocks of flats and the industrial areas, and the\nopen agricultural areas or natural landscape had emerged at\nthat time in the country's landscape.\nThe interventions of the Soviet period failed to harmonize\nthe economic, cultural, and aesthetic needs of the society and\nto achieve the environmental sustainability. Moreover, the\nrestoration of country's independence in 1990 and the related\nFigure 1. Territorial fragments of historic types of rural landscapes in the contemporary territory of Lithuania.\nNote. The relicts of the Soviet rural landscape, predominant in the large part of country's territory and in the surrounding areas of large cities, justify the\nrelevance of this research.\n4 SAGE Open\npolitical and economic reforms had again strongly altered\nthe situation. Similar changes had occurred in many coun-\ntries that were a part of the former Soviet bloc: The socialism\nwith its relative equality and the centrally planned economy\nwere rapidly replaced with capitalism, the ideology of neo-\nliberalism, and the subsequent social stratification (Gentile\net al., 2012). The influence of these changes on landscape\nwas not envisaged or even considered (Bucas, 2001). Some\neffects of this shift on the rural areas can be mentioned: the\nreturn of land to the owners, the privatization of property, the\nabandonment of surplus farmland, the expansion of forests,\nthe migration of young people to the cities, the aging popula-\ntion, the collapse of the rural infrastructure, and the decay of\nold houses and rural buildings (Bell, Penze, Nikodemus, &\nFor example, in Lithuania in the initial years of indepen-\nurban reality and the expression of rural\u00adurban interface have\nchanged considerably as well. Contemporary trends can be\ndescribed as the demographically shrinking and territorially\nexpanding cities (Cereskevicius, 2012) and the suburbaniza-\ntion or the urban sprawl (Gentile et al., 2012), resulting in\nvirtually unregulated spot-like urban expansion to the coun-\ntryside and natural areas. The research carried out by the\nInstitute of Geology and Geography (\"Krastovaizdzio,\" 2008)\nidentified landscape changes in the territory of the country\nbased on the selected landscape monitoring areas at the local\nresults reflect the above-mentioned trends (Figure 2): the\ndecline of the agrarian areas, the processes of landscape\nrenaturalization reflected in the increase of the scrubby areas\nin almost all the territory of the country, and the intensifica-\ntion of the construction activities. The landscape change\nanalysis of land cover (Aplinkos apsaugos agentra, 2014)\ndemonstrates: the decrease of pastures, mainly due to renatu-\nralization and the expansion of construction activities at the\nexpense of agricultural areas.\nThis research mainly focuses on the relicts of the Soviet\nrural landscape in the zones of influence of the largest\nLithuanian cities as demonstrated in Figure 1. As the territories\naccording to the data of the Institute of Geology and Geography from the landscape monitoring (local level) areas.\nSource. Adapted from \"Krastovaizdzio\" (2008).\nNote. The negative percentage value indicates the decrease, and the positive indicates the increase of the areas under consideration.\nGrazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 5\nof these cities had expanded due to the recent real estate boom\n(Pakalnis & Bardauskien, 2012) and continue to grow, the\nincreasing number of the relicts of historic rural landscapes,\nincluding landscapes shaped during the Soviet period, will\nexperience the pressure for urbanization. The abandonment\nand renaturalization of these areas also take place simultane-\nously. Figure 3 shows the main factors influencing the relicts of\nthe Soviet rural landscapes. This paradoxical situation of simul-\ntaneous abandonment and pressure for development and the\nthree of four major Lithuanian cities located in the landscapes\nwith predominant relicts of the Soviet rural landscapes demon-\nstrate the relevance of this research.\nThe Significance and Possible\nTransformations of the Relicts of Soviet\nRural Landscape Under Influence of\nUrbanization\nThe landscape itself has a multifunctional character; it per-\nforms ecological function, aesthetic function, cultural\u00adhistori-\ncal function, functions of tourism and information, and\nfunctions of resources and land use (Rasa & Nikodemus,\nlandscape in society's life: residential (sociobiological space\nfor human existence), production (area and resources for agri-\ncultural production), and recreational (areas for rest of rural and\nurban residents). Thus, analyzing the possibilities of develop-\nment of the relicts of the Soviet rural landscape in the areas of\nrural\u00adurban interface, all these functional and perceptual\naspects--sociocultural, economic, ecological, and aesthetic--\nshould be considered and none of them treated in isolation.\nSociocultural Aspects\nFrom the ecological point of view, the cause of degradation of\nthe landscapes under consideration is the removal of wood-\nlots and traditional green structures, the industrial farming\ntechniques, and the soil loss during the Soviet era. The agri-\ncultural buildings may be seen as the secondary issue in this\nproblem. However, the buildings of the collective farms and\nother agricultural complexes (piggeries, cowsheds, hatcher-\nies, silo storages, agrotechnical garage buildings, grain, fertil-\nizer and pesticide storage buildings, grain elevators,\nadministrational buildings, etc.) are the most characteristic\nobjects that allow recognizing the relicts of the rural land-\nscape of the Soviet period and cause different reactions of\nprofessionals and society. The abandoned, derelict buildings\nshape the image of such landscapes and may cause cultural\nbiases against such environments. Moreover, the Program of\nLiquidation of Abandoned Buildings (State Protected Areas\nService Under the Ministry of the Environment, 2008) pre-\npared under the commission of the State Protected Areas\nService under the Ministry of the Environment of the Republic\nof Lithuania indicates that inappropriately maintained or\nabandoned buildings increase the social tensions and shape\nthe opinion that the authorities fail to properly manage the\ncountry.\nIn the areas of rural\u00adurban interface, where the density\nof residents and the prices of land are higher than in the\naverage rural areas (Aleknavicius & Valciukien, 2011),\nthese buildings present particular functional and aesthetic\nchallenge. It is generally considered that the historic rural\nbuildings, such as the manor houses or homesteads, can be\nused for tourism or adapted to the needs of communities.\nHowever, the relicts of the Soviet period farming are the\nambiguous and contradictory legacy, which may be valued\nmore negatively than positively by the society both from\naesthetic and cultural\u00adhistorical points of view. For exam-\nple, the survey carried out in Latvia has demonstrated that\nthe majority of the respondents saw the changes of coun-\ntry's landscape of the Soviet period and the subsequent\ntransformations as negative (Bell et al., 2008). The ques-\ntions may be asked: Can contemporary society appreciate\nthe relics of the Soviet rural landscape with corresponding\nbuildings as cultural legacy, and how society would view\nthe reuse of abandoned farm buildings to other needs than\nthe agricultural production?\nIn the sociological survey (Rubikait, 2013), the members\nof the society were asked to express their opinions about the\nbenefits of adaptive reuse, about cultural value of historic\nagricultural buildings and the need to preserve them, and\nabout the emotional effects of abandoned farm buildings and\nthe possibilities to adapt them to the residential, commercial,\neducational needs, and even to the function of public cater-\ning. Farmers were also asked about the possibilities of recon-\nstruction and reuse of such buildings.\nThe results show that the surveyed individuals seem to\nview farm building reconstruction positively: 88% of the\nrespondents see the adaptive reuse as positive in general, and\n62% of them agree that the abandoned agricultural com-\nplexes in Lithuania can be successfully converted to different\nnonagricultural functions. The answers concerning the\nheritage value were much more ambiguous and reveal more\nFigure 3. The factors influencing the relicts of the Soviet rural\nlandscapes.\n6 SAGE Open\nskeptical attitude toward the Soviet farm buildings: 65% of\nthe respondents agree that farm buildings of different histori-\ncal periods may have historical, cultural, and aesthetic value;\nhowever, 55% of the surveyed individuals agree that there\nare many agricultural buildings that are not worth preserv-\ning. Only 18% of the respondents agreed that the agricultural\nbuildings of the Soviet period are worthy to preserve as cul-\ntural heritage. The emotional impact of the abandoned agri-\ncultural complexes on the respondents is mainly negative:\n75% of the respondents stated that these buildings cause\nnegative emotions, 43% of the respondents noted that these\nbuildings negatively affect landscapes, and 32% noted that\nthe abandoned agricultural buildings negatively affect gen-\neral image of the country. The respondents were presented\nwith several examples of farm building adaptive reuse in dif-\nferent European countries. The answers show that the respon-\ndents value positively different conversion possibilities:\nconversion into residential building (59% view very posi-\ntively, 25% view positively), conversion into hotel (45%\nview very positively, 41% view positively), and conversion\ninto children and youth center (88% view positively). Eighty-\nfour percent of the respondents would use themselves and\nrecommend to other the children and youth center instituted\nin the converted farm building. Twenty-two percent of the\nrespondents would consider living in a house or flat in a\nreconstructed farm building, and 58 percent of the respon-\ndents would consider this possibility only if the residential\nunit would perfectly correspond to their needs. Seventy-two\npercent of the respondents positively view the possibility to\nadapt the abandoned farm buildings to leisure and entertain-\nment functions including catering. Ninety-one percent of the\nrespondents view reconstructed farm buildings as their pos-\nsible working environment.\nThe surveyed farmers also do not reject the idea of\nreconstruction of the existing abandoned agricultural\nbuildings; however, they view the idea of building reuse\nfor nonfarming purposes more skeptically. Only 12% of\nthem agreed that in cases when farming is impossible, the\nagricultural buildings should be adapted to other functions.\nThe most appropriate nonagricultural functions for such\nbuildings according to the farmers would be commercial,\nservices, sports, administrative, and other special needs.\nThe surveys show that although the heritage value of agri-\ncultural complexes raises the doubts in the society, their\nreuse possibilities are viewed positively and a wide spec-\ntrum of socially acceptable new functions can be seen. The\nlack of social infrastructure in peri-urban areas, the lack of\njobs, the lack of public spaces, the lack of identity, and the\nlack of visual distinctiveness, on one hand, and the histori-\ncal significance of the relicts of rural landscape of the\nSoviet period, the higher density of residents in the influ-\nence zone of the city, and the higher potential for various\nkinds of uses (Figure 4), on the other hand, demonstrate\nthe feasibility of both agricultural and nonagricultural uses\nof these landscape relicts.\nEconomic Aspects\nIt is generally acknowledged that the adaptive reuse of aban-\ndoned buildings and territories can have a positive economic\ninfluence as it diminishes the demolition costs, creates new\njobs in building reconstruction and repair and in other\ndirectly and indirectly related sectors, and increases tax rev-\nenue; recreated landscape complexes can be adapted to tour-\nism (Baltrusaityt, 2013). However, both the relicts of the\nrural landscape of the Soviet period, especially buildings,\nand the areas of rural\u00adurban interface surrounding the largest\ncities in Lithuania, including Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipeda,\nhave certain peculiarities that should be addressed in the con-\ntext of building and territory reuse.\nThe economic pressures for development in the zone of\ninfluence of the city should be mentioned. For example, the\nresearch byAleknavicius and Valciukien (2011) has demon-\nstrated the higher density of population and the higher prices\nof agricultural land in the influence zone of Vilnius. They\nhad determined the radius of urban influence of 25 kilome-\nters. They have founded that in this territory surrounding\nVilnius, the density of residents is 10 times higher than in\naverage in the rural areas in Lithuania. The territories in this\nzone are attractive for the real estate market, especially for\nbuilding individual houses and small residential quarters, for\ncommercial and logistics development. Thus, the research of\nAleknavicius and Valciukien demonstrates that the average\nmarket price of agricultural land amounts to the average\nprice of residential land in the influence zone of Vilnius. The\nanalysis of land cover changes also demonstrates the con-\nstant change in the zones of influence of large cities (Aplinkos\nThe administrational boundaries of Lithuanian cities also\ncomprise the open areas, natural, agricultural land, and the\nfragments of historic rural landscape. The current territorial\nplanning documents--the city master plans and city district\nmaster plans--do not envision the sustainable development\nof peri-urban areas. According to Cirtautas (2012), these\nmunicipalities often perceive the territory planning process\nFigure 4. Spontaneous reuse of the buildings of the former\nfarming complex of the Soviet period at the fringe of Kaunas\n(Lithuania) demonstrates the potential of such derelict objects.\nGrazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 7\nas the routine survey of the existing situation and the meeting\nof the private interests instead of the complex decision mak-\ning having the long-term consequences. As it was mentioned\nabove, the relicts of the rural landscape of the Soviet period\nare characterized by the vast open agricultural fields and\nlarge building complexes. The open agricultural areas with-\nout characteristic natural features are convenient and eco-\nnomically efficient for planning and building the suburban\nmiddle class housing. Thus, during the second decade of the\ncountry's independence (Cirtautas, 2012), large parcels of\nagricultural land surrounding the major cities were turned\ninto the territories for housing development. However, as the\npresent economic slowdown and general sociodemographic\ntrends of the country (Cereskevicius, 2012) suggest, the\ndevelopment of housing in the peri-urban areas based solely\non the short-term economic interests may be detrimental not\nonly from ecological, social, and aesthetic but also from the\neconomic points of view.\nThe uniform houses monotonously arranged in the open\nfields without any greenery or other distinctive features\ntogether with the relatively large commuting distances and\nthe dependence on the automobile may not be so attractive\nand affordable in the future. Meanwhile, the derelict farm\nbuildings and other equipment of the Soviet period constitute\nan eyesore near newly developed residential areas (Figure 6).\nThus, not only the sociocultural but also the economic argu-\nment encourages thinking of the sustainable planning of the\nareas of rural\u00adurban interface and sustainable reuse of the\nrelicts of the Soviet rural landscapes.\nAgriculture in the peri-urban zone. The pressures for develop-\nment of housing in the areas of rural\u00adurban interface should\nnot overshadow the importance of agriculture in these areas.\nAccording to Aleknavicius and Valciukien (2011), in the\nzone of influence of the city of Vilnius, agricultural land con-\nsimilar to the average in the rural areas of the country, which\nis 53.8%. According to them, in the zone of influence of\nKaunas city, residents keep even more livestock for 1 hectare\nof agricultural land and more intensively cultivate horticul-\nture, potatoes, and vegetables than in the rest of the rural\nSource.

The uncomfortable neighborship of suburban housing\nand farm ruins at the fringe of Kaunas (Lithuania).\n8 SAGE Open\nareas of the Kaunas district. Aleknavicius and Valciukien\nunderlined the possibilities to develop agriculture in the\nzones of influence of the large Lithuanian cities and to spe-\ncialize farms for producing the agricultural goods for the city\nincluding fruits, berries, vegetables, milk, and poultry.\nAccording to Aleknavicius and Valciukien (2011), the\npercentage of the agricultural land in the zones of influence\nof large cities will decrease because of urbanization and\nafforestation and spontaneous renaturalization of agricultural\nland; thus, the rest of agricultural land will be used more\nrationally and intensively. This shows that some structural\nelements of agricultural landscapes created during the Soviet\nperiod can be maintained in the areas of rural\u00adurban inter-\nface simultaneously continuing their agricultural function\n(Figure 7).\nThe results of the sociological survey of farmers carried\nout by Rubikait (2013) also confirm this possibility. Forty-\none of 50 surveyed farmers still use the agricultural com-\nplexes that were built during the Soviet period. The majority\nof the surveyed farmers agreed that although new agricul-\ntural complexes better correspond with animal welfare\nrequirements, provide better working environment, and look\nmore attractive, the reuse and reconstruction of agricultural\ncomplexes of the Soviet period requite much less invest-\nments. Farmers value not only the buildings but also other\ninfrastructure including foundations and roads. The proxim-\nity of the city and contemporary trends of sustainability and\necological lifestyles may also influence the agriculture in the\nareas of rural\u00adurban interface with the relicts of the Soviet\nrural landscape. The trend of sustainable farming aimed at\nproducing locally for the city and minimizing the transporta-\ntion costs, sometimes referred to as \"bioregionalism\" as a\npart of much broader movement of \"reconnecting the\nsocially-just human cultures in a sustainable manner to the\nregion-scale ecosystems in which they are irrevocably\npopular. Moreover, the large farm buildings of the Soviet\nperiod can be reused for unusual farming activities: mush-\nroom growing, snails, earthworms'farms, harvesting of solar\nenergy on the rooftops. Peri-urban farms can also be visited\nby the urban population for the educational purposes. A joint\nform of peri-urban farming and agricultural tourism can be\ndeveloped.\nBuildings. The state of the agricultural buildings of the Soviet\nperiod is an important economic factor influencing the reuse\nof the relicts of rural landscapes of this era. The common\ncharacteristics of these buildings--simple utilitarian, func-\ntional architectural form, large volumes, mundane white sili-\ncate bricks and concrete, asbestos slate roof covers, rapid and\noften hasty construction quality, and so on (Figures 8-10)--\ndetermine that the buildings themselves have no particular\narchitectural or aesthetic values. Hypothetically, they can be\nvalued from the cultural point of view only as the parts of\ntheir context--landscape--and as the reminders, witnesses\nof the particular historical period. This means that the most\nprobably derelict and damaged agricultural buildings of the\nSoviet period would not be restored or reconstructed because\nof their cultural value. Consequently, the fate of these build-\nings is much more often determined by their economic value,\nrequired expenditures and investments, usability (a way out\nlooking for affordable space for various commercial, manu-\nfacturing activities), and so on, than by the cultural aspects.\nThus, the physical state and function of these buildings are\nvery important for their future especially in the areas of\nrural\u00adurban interface. According to these, three categories of\nthe agricultural buildings of the Soviet period can be\ndistinguished:\nBuildings with continuous agricultural use,visually and functionally\nlinked with the surrounding agricultural landscape.With con-\ntinuous maintenance, repair, and minimal investments, the\nphysical state of these buildings can be maintained from sat-\nisfactory to good (Figure 8). The maintenance costs of priva-\ntized buildings usually fall on the shoulders of their owners.\nBuildings reused for other purposes (sawmills,garages,small-scale\nmanufacturing, storage). The spontaneous processes of reuse\nof the agricultural buildings of the Soviet period are espe-\ncially visible in the zones of influence of the larger cities\nwith the greater concentration of economic activities. These\nnew functions do not mean the rapid improvement of the\nFigure 7. Contemporary large-scale agricultural practices in the\nagricultural landscape of the Soviet period at the fringe of Kaunas\n(Lithuania).\nFigure 8. Continuous agricultural use and maintenance of the\nbuildings of the Soviet period at the fringe of Kaunas (Lithuania).\nGrazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 9\nphysical state or aesthetic quality of these buildings and their\nsurroundings; reuse conditions only minimal repair and\nmaintenance of satisfactory physical state as these buildings\nare viewed as an opportunity of cheap space not as valuable\nobjects themselves (Figure 9).\nAbandoned buildings. As the Program of Liquidation of Aban-\ndoned Buildings indicates, the problem of abandoned build-\nings was raised only a decade ago in Lithuania, when it\nbecame clear that many inappropriately privatized buildings\nwill not be used according to their function, their technical\nstate deteriorates rapidly (Figure 10), and derelict building\ncomplexes raise the threats to country's residents and envi-\nronment. According to the data of the Informational System\nof Derelict Buildings, 9,312 such buildings exist in the terri-\ntory of the country (Figure 11), although this number is not\nexact or final. The majority of these abandoned buildings\naccording to the Program are nonresidential buildings of the\nSoviet period mainly related with the former collective\nfarms. These abandoned buildings can be classified accord-\ning to their physical state: the buildings of emergency state,\nthe buildings of satisfactory physical state, and the buildings\nin good conditions.\nThe poor quality and absence of maintenance mean rapid\ndecay for the agricultural buildings of the Soviet period, and\nmany of those abandoned after the restoration of the inde-\npendence of the country are already in ruins. According to\nthe data of the Informational System of Derelict Buildings,\nabout 60% of the registered abandoned buildings should be\ndemolished, the others can be repaired or reused. The liqui-\ndation of these buildings also involves the economic costs\ncalculated in the Program of Liquidation of Abandoned\nBuildings (State Protected Areas Service Under the Ministry\nof the Environment, 2008). Thus, this group of the agricul-\ntural buildings of the Soviet period constitutes the major\nchallenge: The specific ways of their liquidation or reuse in\nthe context of rural\u00adurban interface should be developed.\nEcological and Aesthetic Aspects\nAesthetics and ecology are strongly interlined in landscapes\nand should not be dealt with separately. The interdisciplinary\nattempts to analyze the links between the ecology, aesthetics,\nand even artistic creation engendered the discipline of eco-\naesthetics (Araeen, 2009). At the first glance, the ecological\nand aesthetic states of landscapes directly correlate. For\nexample, maintaining the valuable plants would have the\nFigure 9. Reuse of agricultural buildings of the Soviet period at\nthe fringe of Kaunas (Lithuania): (a) garages reused as a car repair\nworkshops and (b) garages and workshop reconstructed into a\nbakery and the house with small orchard and terrace.\nFigure 10. Remains of the abandoned agricultural buildings of\nthe Soviet era at the fringe of Kaunas (Lithuania).\nhigh aesthetical potential, not only the ecological one\n(Jankevica, 2012); the less ecologically viable and diverse\nlandscape should be less aesthetically pleasing as well. Many\npractical examples of direct links between the ecology and\naesthetics can be seen in the Lithuanian landscape. For\nexample, analyzing the aesthetic potential of Lithuanian\nlandscape, Kavaliauskas (2011) indicated that the agricul-\ntural plains, which constitute more than a half (51.3%) of the\ncountry's landscape, were acknowledged by the Lithuanian\nlandscape researchers Budrinas and ringis as having the\nlowest aesthetic value. The harmony between the high aes-\nthetic quality of environment and its ecological health is\ndesirable for cultural landscapes. Nevertheless, the ecologi-\ncal health and balance are not always associated with the\nhigh aesthetic quality: The ecologically healthy landscapes\nmaynotbeaestheticallypleasingandviceversa(Kucinskien,\n2009). The close interrelations in landscapes between the\nanthropogenic elements, such as architectural and urban\nstructures, which require constant maintenance, and the nat-\nural elements, which flourish undisturbed by the human\nactivities, create the ecoaesthetic complexities, which can be\nseen in the former Soviet rural landscapes. The two main\ndirections of changes of the rural landscape of Soviet period\nafter the restoration of the independence can be distin-\nguished: In the less fertile and difficult to access marshy or\nhilly terrains, the process of renaturalization is leading to the\nformation of woody and scrubby areas, and abandoned farm\nbuildings (Figure 12) negatively affect the local identity; in\nthe fertile plains, the large and strong farms are intensively\nexploiting the territorial resources, thus diminishing the bio-\ndiversity and recreational potential.\nIn the areas of the rural\u00adurban interface, the links between\nthe aesthetics and ecology related to the relicts of the Soviet\nrural landscape become even more complicated: These\nlandscapes are affected by such contradictory trends as\nabandonment, the decline of buildings of rural origination,\nthe renaturalization of the abandoned agricultural areas, the\nfragmentation of natural and agricultural land, the intensive\ncultivation, the new construction, the radical changes of\nfunctions, and the advent of suburban and urban aesthetics.\nThe ecological\u00adaesthetic congruencies and contradictions in\nthe relicts of the Soviet rural landscape under the influence\nof urbanization are shortly described below:\nEcological priority.As the nature reclaims the abandoned agri-\ncultural land, the ecological viability and diversity increase.\nThe natural ecosystems in urbanized, densely inhabited\nenvironment though are desirable from the point of view of\nenvironmental sustainability (Jorgensen, 2011); however,\naccording to the opinion of some researchers (Nassauer, 1995),\nthey create the sense of abandonment and unsafety. According\nto Nassauer (1995), many natural ecosystems do not corre-\nspond to the aesthetic norms prevalent in the society. In the\ncase of the former Soviet agricultural landscape, this abandon-\nment happens on the large scale. Large derelict farm buildings\nalso contribute to the negative image of these areas in the vicin-\nity of the city. However, as the contemporary research on the\nlinks of ecology and aesthetics demonstrates, these abandoned\nsuccession landscapes at the urban fringe or even in the inner\nurban areas can have the specific aesthetic value and some-\ntimes can even be the desirable elements of environment and\nthe sites of discovery and experimentation (Gandy, 2013; Nohl,\n2001). These landscapes can be viewed as a part of the process\nof the increasing heteropolitanization--transition toward the\nsocially, economically, culturally, and spatially more heteroge-\nneous and complex environments (Gentile et al., 2012)--of\npostcommunist urban environment.\nAgricultural priority.The features of the former Soviet rural\nlandscape provide the possibilities for the intensive large-\nscale agriculture. Intensively cultivated productive agricul-\ntural landscapes have certain aesthetics (Nohl, 2001),\nalthough land cultivation and especially monoculture cause\nthe ecological decline and the contrasts of the features of the\nurban, suburban, and agricultural aesthetics in the areas of\nrural\u00adurban interface (Figure 13).\nFigure 11. The distribution of abandoned buildings in the\nterritory of Lithuania according to counties.\nSource. Adapted and modified from Apskritis (2009) and State Protected\nAreas Service Under the Ministry of the Environment (2008).\nFigure 12. Renaturalization and abandonment at the fringe of\nKaunas (Lithuania).\nGrazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 11\nAesthetic fragmentation and chaotic diversity. Due to the eco-\nnomic pressures and the intensive development, the features\nof agricultural landscape are being increasingly erased in the\nareas, where the urban influence is mostly felt (Figure 14).\nThe large regular open areas of the former Soviet rural land-\nscape provide the possibilities for the unrestrained develop-\nment of residential, commercial, logistics structures and the\nnecessary infrastructure. With the lack of coordination of this\nprocess, the dissonant, fragmented landscapes having both\nrural and urban features, which became a stereotype of sub-\nurban landscape, emerge. Here, many processes happen in\nthe close proximity and create the aesthetic confusion. This\ntype of rural\u00adurban interface landscape also requires the spe-\ncific attention.\nIntegration Scenarios\nThe landscape as the dynamic holistic phenomenon (Antrop,\n2008) and the sociocultural, economic, ecological, and aes-\nthetic aspects related to the reuse of the relicts of the Soviet\nrural landscape in the areas of rural\u00adurban interface imply the\nsystematic, integrated approach to this problem. The Soviet\nutilitarian planning and management of the rural landscapes\nhad made the landscapes unattractive for numerous modern\nuses related with the urban development--residential, cul-\ntural, recreation, small business development, and so on. The\nquestion may be raised how these landscapes can be adapted\nto more economically and ecologically sustainable life in the\ndeveloping rural\u00adurban interface areas and how it is possible\navoiding further visual and ecological degradation of these\nlandscapes. According to Bucas (2001), such cultural land-\nscapes should be aesthetically attractive, ergonomic, ecologi-\ncally sustainable, and spiritually meaningful. Historical rural\nlandscapes usually were and are the organically evolved cul-\ntural landscapes (Bucas, 2001; United Nations Educational,\nScientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], World\nHeritage Center, 2013). These landscapes had resulted from\nan initial social, economic, administrative, and/or religious\nimperative and developed their present form by association\nwith and in response to natural environment; such landscapes\nreflect that process of evolution in their form and component\nfeatures (UNESCO, World Heritage Center, 2013). The agri-\ncultural reform of the Soviet period, the urban expansion, and\nits influence on the rural landscapes afterward had disrupted\nthe continuous evolution of these landscapes under analysis.\nWith the increasing pressures for development, the urban\ninfluence, numerous stakeholders, and the conflicting inter-\nests and functions, the organic evolution of landscapes in the\nareas of rural\u00adurban interface is hardly possible. However,\nthe holistic, integrated planning and design process encom-\npassing the different scales of landscape from garden to\nregion, from small neighborhood to the entire metropolitan\narea (Spirn, 2000), viewing the landscape design as a tool for\nsustainability, viewing the landscape architecture as the\ninstrument of environmentalism (McHarg, 1969), taking into\naccount the social, economic, ecological, aesthetic dimen-\nsions, and the overall image of the landscapes all these men-\ntioned aspects could foster the conscious development of\ncultural landscapes. Insightful planning and artistic thinking\ncan be used to stimulate the organic landscape evolution pro-\ncess and to transfer it to a new level as well (Araeen, 2009).\nThe idea of McHarg that landscape design is a tool for human\nevolution (Spirn, 2000) can be integrated here as well.\nAccording to Antrop (2008), the landscape research\nshould focus more on prognosis and scenarios. He notes that\nmuch landscape research is descriptive; it contributes mainly\nto knowledge but rarely serves as the basis for planning the\nfuture development. Thus, the scenario approach was\nselected as a tool to coordinate all the above-mentioned\naspects and create desirable landscape quality and image.\nTable 1 demonstrates seven scenarios of treatment of the rel-\nicts of Soviet rural landscape in the areas of rural\u00adurban\ninterface.

We find the contribution\nof Nohl particularly interesting and relevant for this\nresearch. His holistic approach toward aesthetics in\nthe context of landscape sustainability and the look at\nthe future landscapes as the aesthetical objects and his\nfour aesthetic perceptual categories under the sustain-\nable landscape conditions can be successfully applied\nin the development of the relicts of Soviet rural land-\nscapes under the pressures of urbanization. These four\nlandscape types or the aesthetic perceptual categories\nunder sustainable landscape conditions include \"the\nbeautiful\" (areas similar to traditional cultural land-\nscapes), \"the new sublime\" (areas where nature can\ndevelop freely and spontaneously, such parts of land-\nscape simultaneously can be disharmonic, unordered,\nfragmented, unstable, not easy to read, mysterious,\nand very informative and aesthetically appealing),\n\"the interesting\" (areas where the multiplicity of land\nuses generate confusing, incoherent, labyrinthine,\nchaotic environments and events; however, the inter-\nesting in the right place affects us positively even if it\nincludes ugly things), and \"the plain\" (areas of eco-\nlogically sound intensive agricultural production--\nrural functional landscapes).\nScenario 1--Renaturalized Landscapes\nThe scenario involves the demolition of abandoned agricul-\ntural buildings of the Soviet era and related infrastructure,\nthe renaturalization of derelict agricultural areas, and the rec-\nreation of the image of natural landscape. The term \"renatu-\nralization\" here implies the naturalness of landscape, the\nreturn to its primeval state (Balevicit & Veteikis, 2013).\nThis scenario would apply to the areas unsuitable for any\nkind of intensive development and even more to the ecologi-\ncally valuable and vulnerable areas that could be left unde-\nveloped for renaturalization, eco-compensation, increase of\nbiodiversity, acting as carbon sinks, as an integral part of\necological corridors, and so on. The proximity of urban envi-\nronment would also give the educational and recreational\ndimension to these landscapes: They can stimulate the sensi-\nbility toward nature, willingness to explore.\nScenario 2--Succession Landscapes\nThis scenario involves leaving the landscapes with the relicts\nof the Soviet era for spontaneous renaturalization. Only the\nhazardous buildings and structures can be dismantled, while\ncovering other abandoned buildings and their ruins with rap-\nidly growing trees and shrubs or using vertical planting. The\nrelicts of agricultural buildings can be adapted to the envi-\nronmental protection needs (for bat hibernation, etc.) as well.\nThis scenario involves \"the design with nature\" (McHarg,\n1969) and always with the minimum possible interventions\nand the minimum envisioned further maintenance costs bear-\ning in mind the disputed values of the relicts of the Soviet\nrural landscape and buildings and their scale and the scarcity\nof funds. As this scenario--leaving landscape to succes-\nsional processes--requires the least cost, it could be applied\nboth in the larger as smaller scales: in the areas unsuitable for\nany kind of intensive development or in some segments of\nagricultural, recreational, or other kind of peri-urban areas.\nEven if this kind of landscape does not generate any kind of\ndirect economic use, it may provide numerous indirect ben-\nefits for urban ecology (eco-compensation, increase of biodi-\nversity, acting as carbon sinks, serving as a part of ecological\ncorridors, etc.) and society (an engagement with the indepen-\ndent agency of nature, according to Gandy, 2013; demonstra-\ntion of succession landscape to urban society; specific form\nof recreation). Even if such \"derelict\" landscapes may seem\nunsuitable in the close proximity of urban areas or even in\nthe inner urban areas, contemporary researchers increasingly\nunderline its importance. For example, Gandy (2013) speak-\ning on aesthetics, ecology, and urban wastelands used such\nconcepts as \"urban nature\" and \"urban biodiversity\" relevant\nfor the analysis of rural\u00adurban interface; he noted that\nthe marginal spaces of Berlin, London, Montreal, and other\ncities were becoming a significant focus for cultural and\nscientific attention that reflected a series of developments such\nas the emergence of new art practices, increasing levels of\necological awareness, and the changing characteristics of cities\nNohl (2001) distinguished such kind of landscapes for the\n\"self-dynamics, self-productivity, and self-regulation of\nnature\" as the \"landscape areas, which are taken away from\nthe control of man, at least temporarily.\" In this case, the\necology can be not only a science, a moral obligation, but the\nScenario 3--Unusual Landscapes\nThis scenario aims at creating new types of rural\u00adurban\ninterface landscapes, unusual, interesting (Nohl, 2001) land-\nscapes, and involves the renaturalization or leaving to suc-\ncessional processes of derelict agricultural areas. It involves\nthe reconstruction and adaptation of agricultural buildings of\nthe Soviet era to nontraditional agricultural (growing snails,\nGrazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 15\nearthworms, mushrooms, etc.) or nonagricultural (sun-\nharvesting, small businesses, manufacturing) uses as well.\nThe basic conditions for development of such unusual land-\nscapes in the areas of rural\u00adurban interface would involve\ndifficult accessibility, high ecological importance of the area\nunder consideration or its unsuitability for agriculture, and\ngood or satisfactory state of the existing buildings. The\ndevelopment of such landscapes can involve not only utili-\ntarian and ecological developments but also the artistic cre-\nations. The idea of landscape as a collective work of art by\nAraeen (2009) could be useful in this regard. Araeen\nexpanded the concept of the land art, which could be seen not\nmerely as a conceptual art object, but can become an ongoing\nand self-sustaining dynamic process, a movement generated\nwithin it. The role of artistic imagination in this case is\nto think, initiate and create not what is self-consumed by the ego\nfrom which the idea emerges, but what can transcend and\ntransgress the narcissistic ego and become part of the collective\nenergy of the earth. It can then transform it in ways that enhance\nnot only the natural potential of the earth itself but also the\ncollective creativity of the life of all its inhabitants. (p. 684)\nIf realized successfully, such landscapes of unexpected\ncombinations (Figure 15) can attract considerable public\ninterest as well, and the concept of \"interesting\" by Nohl\n(2001) can be applied here as in these landscapes, \"the aes-\nthetic need for information may be satisfied quickly and\nScenario 4--Agricultural Functional Landscapes\nThe scenario involves the sustainable agricultural use of the\nterritories of the relicts of Soviet rural landscape, renovation\nif necessary, and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure\nfor agricultural use. This scenario is the most feasible in the\nareas more distant from the city and the main transport\nroutes, where the majority of population still works in agri-\ncultural sector and where the conditions are favorable for\nfarming. However, with the rise of local produce and the\ntrend of bioregionalism (Aberley, 1999), farming and the\nproximity of urban environment may not be mutually exclu-\nsive and can even constitute an advantage. Moreover, accord-\nsustainably cultivated and ecologically improved, can have\ntheir own aesthetics called \"the plain\" and \"able to arouse\nfeelings of contentment and gratitude in the beholder,\" \"to\nshow how nature and the man-made could be reconciled.\"\nScenario 5--Recreational Landscapes\nThis scenario involves the transformation of the relicts of\nabandoned agricultural territories of the Soviet period into the\nrecreational areas. It also involves the reconstruction of aban-\ndoned buildings, and their adaptation to social, cultural, or\nother uses of local communities. One of the significant factors\ndetermining the reuse possibilities of the relicts of Soviet\nrural landscapes is their accessibility. The relics of the Soviet\nrural landscape and the extant buildings of good or satisfac-\ntory physical state located in the zones of strong urban influ-\nence and near the main transport routes can be converted to\nother nonagricultural functions. In the peri-urban areas with\nhigher population density, these buildings and areas can be\nadapted for the social, cultural needs and recreation bearing in\nmind the current lack of cultural function and public spaces in\nthe developing zones of rural\u00adurban interface in Lithuania. In\nthe cases when the areas are easily accessible and not favor-\nable for cultivation, peri-urban recreation complexes serving\nfor the urban population could be developed. Development of\nsuch recreational landscapes could be based both on the\npreviously mentioned concept \"the interesting\"--creating\nunusual landscapes for rest and exploration--and \"the beauti-\nful\" distinguished by Nohl (2001) or their combinations.\n\"The beautiful\" in the case of contemporary landscape devel-\nopment refers to the areas where \"all the elements are more or\nless known and in which they are arranged in a balanced and\nThis concept could be well applicable in the cases when the\nFigure 15. Unexpected combinations of tidy peri-urban\naesthetics and renaturalization at the fringe of Kaunas (Lithuania).\nFigure 16. The relicts of rural landscape of different historic\nperiods and different values at the fringe of Kaunas (Lithuania).\nrelicts of other, more sustainable and harmonic types of his-\ntoric rural landscape--ikivalakinis, valakinis, or vienkiemi-\nnis--and/or the distinctive features of natural environment\nare present in the territory (Figure 16).\nScenario 6--Urban Fringe Landscapes\nThis scenario involves the urbanization of abandoned agri-\ncultural territories and adaptation of abandoned agricultural\nbuildings of the Soviet period to cultural, social, or economic\nneeds. According to I. McHarg (1969), the uncontrolled\ngrowth is inevitably destructive, and the planned growth is\nmore desirable and as profitable as the uncontrolled growth.\nThis assertion is especially relevant to the areas of rural\u00ad\nurban interface. Multifunctionality and the polycentric\ndevelopment become increasingly important in the areas of\nrural\u00adurban interface as a means to reduce the dependency\non automobile by creating jobs and providing services and\nsocial infrastructure locally and to enhance local identity\nand to strengthen communities. The abandoned buildings\nand territories could be used for the social needs and services\nof local communities and for commerce and production, thus\ndiversifying local economies and reducing the need to com-\nmute.According toAntuchevicien (2005), the buildings and\nterritories near densely inhabited areas could be adapted to\nthe businesses and industries, which require more work-\nforces. The structural and aesthetic features of farm build-\nings of the Soviet period strongly limit the possibility to\nadapt them to residential purposes; however, not only the\nforeign experience (Lunkevicius, 2001) but also the survey\nresults (Rubikait, 2013) demonstrate that this possibility\nshould not be rejected totally. This scenario can as well\ninvolve the combinations of \"the beautiful\" and \"the interest-\ning\" according to Nohl (2001), where the development of\nperi-urban residential areas could be based on the balance\nand harmony characteristic to the traditional cultural land-\nscapes, and the reused agricultural buildings of the Soviet era\nmay constitute \"the interesting\" element and contribute to\nthe specific identity and legibility of the local landscape.\nScenario 7--Urban Landscapes\nThe last scenario involves the complete redevelopment of\nthe territory, without leaving any explicit signs of its past: the\nurbanization of abandoned agricultural territories and the\ndemolition of abandoned agricultural buildings. This sce-\nnario would be feasible in the case, when the territory under\nconsideration is easily accessible or it has the high economic\nand social importance, and the state of extant buildings and\nother structures of the Soviet era is bad or emergency. In such\ncases, the large spaces provided by the rural landscapes of\nthe Soviet period provide the possibilities for unrestricted\ndevelopment of urban environment, where different aesthetic\nconcepts (\"the beautiful,\" \"the interesting\"; Nohl, 2001) and\nurban solutions can be selected. However, it is important that\nthese new landscapes would correspond to the characteristics\nof cultural landscapes--aesthetical attractiveness, ergonom-\nics, ecological sustainability, and spiritual meaningfulness\n(Bucas, 2001)--and would provide real home for peri-urban\nresidents.\nConclusion\nThis research has focused on the landscapes in the rapidly\nchanging social and economic conditions and particularly on\nthe features, development, and redevelopment possibilities\nof the relicts of Soviet rural landscapes in the areas of rural\u00ad\nurban interface in postcommunist Lithuania.\nThe short review of history and the peculiarities of these\nlandscapes have demonstrated that the reforms of the Soviet\nperiod had strongly altered the Lithuanian landscape. As a\nconsequence of these changes, the specific type of rural land-\nscapes, which can be characterized by the industrial scale of\ninterventions and production, the restructured and rational-\nized rural settlement system, the radically new building and\nplanting practices and with the large, regular, and uniform\nspaces and agricultural production complexes of unusual\nshapes, materials, and large volumes, and the related infra-\nstructure, had emerged. After the restoration of the indepen-\ndence of the country, the following restructuring of\nagricultural economy affected not only the country's society\nbut also the landscape: Numerous agricultural areas with cor-\nresponding building complexes and other structures mainly\nof the Soviet period lay abandoned, the decline of the build-\nings is accompanied by the processes of renaturalization of\nagricultural land, simultaneously new small farms and large\nagricultural enterprises emerge causing further landscape\ntransformations, and rapid and extensive urban expansion in\nthe zone of influence of large cities into natural and rural ter-\nritories alter the face of the Lithuanian rural areas and their\nlinks with urban environment.\nThis paradoxical combination of the rapid new develop-\nments and renaturalization and successional processes in\nlandscape deserves a special attention and the analysis of\ntheir social, cultural, economic, ecological, and aesthetic\ndimensions. The literature review and survey results reveal\nthe sociocultural and economic premises for the different\nuses of the relics of the rural landscape of Soviet period in\nthe areas of rural\u00adurban interface ranging from the restora-\ntion of natural landscape to continuity of agricultural prac-\ntices and the use for recreational and social purposes. The\nrelicts of the rural landscapes of the Soviet period affected by\nthe contemporary urbanization present the particular chal-\nlenge from the point of view of interaction of ecology and\naesthetics as well. These landscapes exhibit such contradic-\ntory trends as abandonment, decline of buildings, renatural-\nization, intensive urbanization, fragmentation, contrasts of\nrural and urban aesthetics, and so on, and simultaneously\nhold the potential of realization of new aesthetic concepts of\n\"urban nature\" (Gandy, 2013). This complexity demonstrates\nGrazuleviciute-Vileniske et al. 17\nthe need of new approaches toward the development of cul-\ntural landscapes.\nThe approach of landscape development scenarios with\nthe specific landscape aesthetic expressions based mainly on\nthe findings of Nohl (2001) and with reference to Gandy\n(2013) was selected. We argue that such approach would be\nhelpful for development of the sustainable landscapes in the\nareas of rural\u00adurban interface--the new aesthetically attrac-\ntive, ergonomic, ecologically sustainable, and spiritually\nmeaningful (Bucas, 2001) cultural landscapes. This contribu-\ntion demonstrates the applicability of the Nohl's ideas to spe-\ncific contexts as well. Seven scenarios of treatment of these\nlandscape relicts in the areas of rural\u00adurban interface under\ndifferent conditions and reflecting the gradual transition from\nthe natural and rural to the urban were developed: renatural-\nized landscapes (recreation of the image of natural landscape),\nsuccession landscapes (leaving landscapes for spontaneous\nrenaturalization simultaneously maintaining some signs of\ntheir previous use), unusual landscapes (creating interesting,\nunusual, new types of landscape in the vicinity of the city),\nagricultural functional landscapes (developing/maintaining\nagricultural landscapes in the vicinity of the city), recreational\nlandscapes (development of unusual recreational settings for\nurban population), urban fringe landscapes (developing inter-\nesting and humane peri-urban environment with focal points\nfor communities, specific characters, and the reminders of the\nplace's history), and urban landscapes (developing high-qual-\nity urban environment).
