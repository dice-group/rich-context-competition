This is a retrospective cohort study of patients\nwith CKD stage 2 or greater. We used the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\n18 years or older. Our primary variable of interest is\nSAI. Each component of SAI (employment status, educa-\ntion, marital status, and substance abuse) has been graded\non the scale of 0\u00ad3, income has been graded on the scale\n0\u00ad1. Age, sex, race, diabetes, co-morbidity index, body\nmass index (BMI), geographic location, haemoglobin, se-\nrum creatinine, serum albumin, serum cholesterol and\nHba1c were used as covariates in multivariate analysis.\nThe outcome of the study is patient's mortality. The time\nto death was calculated as time between the first inter-\nview by NHANES and death.\nResults. We analysed 13 400 subjects with mean age of\nAmerican and 22.1% Mexican American--with 8.5% hav-\ning diabetes, with an average number of co-morbid condi-\ntions of 2.7 \u00b1 1.1. Lower SAI is associated with greater\nstage of CKD. Higher SAI was associated with decreased\nanalysed, we demonstrated a `dose-dependent' association\nbetween SAI and survival. Subgroup analysis showed that\nthis association of SAI and survival was present in all\nstudied subgroups.

There are\nan estimated 8 million people in the USA with stage 3\nCKD [2]. CKD is associated with increased risk of adverse\nclinical outcome, including all-cause and cardiovascular\nmortality, hypertension and other co-morbidities [3].\nThere have been numerous studies documenting the ef-\nfect of belonging to specific demographic groups on med-\nical outcomes. In particular, inferior outcomes have been\nassociated with minority ethnic groups [4,5]. In a recent\nstudy, the prevalence of CKD among African Americans\nhas been shown to be high [6] (much higher than the white\npopulation [7]), while awareness of it was relatively low\n[6]. Similarly, other populations, which are traditionally\nconsidered underprivileged such as women [8], and people\nliving in rural areas [9] have been associated with inferior\noutcomes. It is not clear, however, what specific factors ac-\ncount for these differences, as the causes may be related to a\nbiologic effect, or alternatively a social phenomenon based\non differences in access to medical care, health literacy and\ncompliance. To support the latter, it has been shown by us\nand other groups that employment status [10], education\nincome [15] and substance abuse [16] are significantly as-\nsociated with clinical outcomes. Medicaid beneficiaries are\nless likely to receive optimal treatment, and their medical\noutcome is worse compared with privately insured patients\nfor common conditions such as myocardial infarction and\nbronchial asthma [17,18]. To separate between biologic\nand socioeconomic factors, and identify the population\nmost at risk for poor medical outcome based on socioeco-\nnomic factors, we proposed a new cumulative indicator,\nthe Social Adaptability Index (SAI). The goal of this proj-\nect was to evaluate the role of this new indicator, SAI, in\npredicting the survival of subjects with CKD. In this proj-\nect, we hypothesized that CKD population with underpriv-\nileged status (defined by lower SAI) may have association\nwith inferior patient survival.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nWe used the data from the NHANES III cohort, which includes >30 000\ninformation available through 31 December 2000. Data collection for\nthe NHANES III was based on a substantial oversampling of young chil-\ndren, females, older persons, black persons and Mexican Americans in\norder to identify those most at risk for poor nutrition for the purpose of\nthe NHANES study. Only adults (18 years old or older) with stage 2 CKD\nor worse were included in our analysis (no subjects were excluded based\non their dialysis status). Records with missing outcome were deleted. Fol-\nlow-up was censored at death, loss to follow-up or study completion,\nwhichever occurred first.\nPrimary variables of interest\nThe primary variable of interest is the SAI, calculated as a sum of five\nscores related to employment status, education level, marital status, sub-\nstance abuse and income. To eliminate the problem of scalability, each\ncomponent was graded on a scale of 0\u00ad3 (except income was graded\non the scale of 0\u00ad1) without additional weighting, so that each individual\ncomponent contributed equally (from 0 to 3 points) to the final index. The\ngrading system we used is as follows:\nEmployment status: 0 = unemployed, not working due to medical con-\nditions, not working by choice; 1 = retired; 2 = working part time; 3 =\nworking full time.\nEducation level: 0 = did not complete high school; 1 = high school\ngraduate; 2 = college graduate; 3 = post-college education or doctorate\ndegree.\nMarital status: 0 = not married (including never been married and wi-\ndowed); 1 = divorced or separated; 2 = married without children; 3 = mar-\nried with children. The married category includes those married with\nspouse in household, married with spouse not in household, living as mar-\nried and living with a partner. If a subject was married and the number of\npeople in the household was >2, we considered that individual married\nwith children (marital status = 3); otherwise, we considered the individual\nmarried without children (marital status = 2).\nSubstance abuse: 0 = abusing drugs, alcohol and tobacco; 1 = abusing\ntwo of three substances; 2 = abusing one of three substances; 3 = none.\nAlcohol addiction was defined as positive if any of the following criteria\nwere true: (i) number of days subjects used more than nine drinks over the\nlast 12 months was >24; (ii) number of days subjects used more than five\ndrinks over the last 12 months was >48; (iii) number of days subject drank\nalcohol in past 12 months was >240. Drug addiction was defined based\non marijuana or cocaine use history available in the dataset. In particular,\ndrug addiction was defined as positive if the subject used marijuana or\nSocial adaptability index and mortality 3673\ncocaine at least once over the last month. Finally, tobacco addiction was\ndefined as positive if any of the following factors were true: (i) subjects\ndescribed himself/herself as a smoker at the time of interview; (ii) subject\nsmoked cigarettes immediately prior to interview (within 30 min); (iii)\nnumber of cigarettes/cigars/pipes/chewing tobacco containers used in\nthe past 5 days was greater than four.\nhousehold; 2 = $50K/year per household. NHANES III did not include\nincome categories >$50K/year.\nCovariates\nWe used the following covariates in multivariate analysis: age, sex, race,\nhistory of diabetes, co-morbidity index (described below), body mass in-\ndex, geographic location (urban/rural), haemoglobin, serum creatinine, se-\nrum albumin, serum cholesterol and glycated haemoglobin levels. The\nstage of CKD was determined based on estimated GFR (eGFR). eGFR\nwas calculated using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) for-\nmula [19]. Stages of CKD were defined using standard criteria of eGFR\nRace and ethnicity were combined to yield four race\u00adethnic groups:\nNon-Hispanic white, Non-Hispanic black, Mexican American and Other.\nCo-morbid conditions were analysed as a co-morbidity coefficient similar\nto the Charlson co-morbidity index [20], where each of the co-morbid\nconditions available in the dataset contributed one point to the composite\nindex with additional points given for older age. Geographic location is\ndefined by NHANES as binary variable, where 1 = central or fringe\ncounties of metropolitan areas of 1 million population or more, and 2 =\nother.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used non-weighted data in this analysis. Continuous variables with\nnormal distribution were summarized using means and standard devia-\ntions. Distributions that were skewed or had severe outliers were summa-\nrized using the median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles).\nCategorical variables were summarized as percent of total. Groups were\ncompared using t-test or ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square\nfor the categorical variables. Kaplan\u00adMeier plots and proportional hazard\nmodels were used for the survival analysis. Survival was defined as the\ntime from the day of the interview to the death or censor.\nSince the number of subjects with CKD stage 4 and especially 5 was\nlow, for survival analysis, we divided the entire patient population into the\ngroup of patients with stage 2 and the combined group of CKD stages 3\u00ad5.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nThe study population of patients with CKD stage 2 or\ngreater consisted of 13 400 subjects (of this number,\ncan American.

While that is true, the definition of un-\nderprivileged population is usually based on racial affilia-\ntion, sex or geographic location. This definition may not\nbe sensitive or specific, as not all people belonging to\nFactors external to the individual\ndemographic or geographic\nfactors, poor income of parents,\npoor education opportunities\nLevel of social adaptability\nSocial implications\nEmployment status\nEducation level\nMarital status\nSubstance abuse\nIncome level\nHealthcare implications\nLevel of health literacy (i.e., lack of comprehension of the nature of\nthe disease and importance of therapy)\nLevel of motivation to be healthy\nObjective barriers to compliance (inability to support co-payment)\nOutcomes\nMortality and morbidity\nCompliance\nQuality of life\nRate of return to work\nFactors internal to the individual\nLack of motivation/ energy, low IQ,\nlimited developmental or intellectual\nresources, psychopathology, poor focus\nFig. 3. Conceptual model underlying study hypothesis and observed association. Underprivileged status might represent either (i) an external\nphenomenon, independent of individual and representing environment, i.e. being underprivileged due to demographic, geographic or social factors;\nor (ii) an intrinsic phenomenon caused by factors endogenous to individual, i.e. lack of motivation/energy, low IQ, limited developmental or intellectual\nresources, psychopathology, poor focus. In both of these cases, underprivileged status causes lower level of social adaptability and social support, which\nin turn has social and health-care implications leading to poorer outcomes.\nSocial adaptability index and mortality 3677\nthese groups can be classified as `underprivileged' or are\nat risk for poor medical outcomes. In this project, we de-\nfined underprivileged status based on SAI, composed of\nfive socioeconomic characteristics. The novelty of SAI is\nin its integrative nature and strong association with out-\ncome. Despite the fact that individual socioeconomic fac-\ntors have been linked to health outcome, a composite index\nhas never been successfully developed and validated.\nPriebe et al. [23] aimed to develop a simple index of social\nstatus; however, this indicator based on employment, ac-\ncommodation and living situation demonstrated only a\nweak association with health-care outcomes. In contrast,\nthe index that was proposed and validated by our group\nseems to be an accurate, objective and robust measurement\nof underprivileged status. It is also practical as it is based\non five factors easily measurable and quantifiable.\nAll of the individual components of SAI have been dem-\nonstrated to have an association with clinical outcome, in-\nother groups. In particular, the role of income in clinical\noutcome has been demonstrated; specifically, higher\nneighbourhood income has been to shown to increase sur-\nvival and likelihood of placement on the renal transplant\nlist in CKD patients [24]. We have also demonstrated the\nnegative effect of alcohol addiction on kidney allograft sur-\nvival in transplant recipients. There is experimental evi-\ndence that alcohol consumption has a direct nephrotoxic\neffect [25]; moreover, alcohol-induced hypertension can\nindirectly lead to increased risk of CKD [25\u00ad28]. Similar-\nly, smoking confers a substantial increase in risk for renal\nfunction deterioration [29] and cardiovascular disease in\nCKD population [30,31]. Furthermore, joint exposure of\nheavy alcohol consumption and smoking has been shown\nto increase the risk of developing CKD by 5-fold [28]. We\ndid not find an extensive literature on the role of education\nand employment status in outcome of patients with CKD.\nOur group described the role of these factors in clinical\noutcome in the cohort of transplant recipients [11]. Simi-\nlarly, the data regarding the link of income with clinical\noutcome of CKD patients are quite limited. Prevalence\nof CKD was associated with financially disadvantaged sta-\ntus [32,33]; furthermore, the poor and socially deprived\nhave higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease [33],\nwhile living in the area of generally low socioeconomic\nstatus has been associated with a greater rate of progres-\nsive CKD [34]. Interestingly, in another report by the same\ngroup, no association between education level, income and\nprogressive CKD was found in the elderly population [35].\nSimilarly, we did not find much literature on the role of\nmarital status in CKD patients' outcome. In our previous\nstudy, being married and therefore potentially having a\nstronger social support system is associated with positive\noutcome in transplant recipients [14].\nIn this project, we studied the association between in-\ndividual socioeconomic factors and survival, as well as\nbetween the composite index of socioeconomic status\n(the SAI) and survival. Admittedly, there is a degree of\ncollinearity between the components of SAI; for example,\neducation level has been shown to be associated with\nhigher income [36], and marital status has been shown\nto have an association with higher access to material re-\nsources [37]. Similar to that in previously developed co-\nmorbidity indices (e.g. Charlson index [20]), there is a\ncollinearity between certain components, e.g. diabetes\nand cardiac disease, hypertension and cerebrovascular\ndisease, age and malignancies. Due to paucity of infor-\nmation available in the literature, we studied the associa-\ntion between individual components of the SAI and\npatients' survival, and demonstrated the significant and\nindependent association with mortality for each of the\nfive components of the SAI. Interestingly, while the ef-\nfect size for each of these factors (graded on the scale\nfrom 0 to 3) was relatively modest (<10% risk reduction),\neach point increase in SAI (the range is from 0 to 14)\ndecreases the risk of death by 12%.\nThis study did not provide insight into the mechanism of\nobserved association. However, we initiated this project\nbased on a predefined hypothesis and conceptual model,\nwhich might provide explanation of the mechanism of\nthe observed association (Figure 3). In this model, poor so-\ncioeconomic state could be either a phenomenon external\nto the individual due to factors neither under control of the\nindividual nor intrinsically associated with him/her. These\nmay represent the effect of the environment (e.g. demo-\ngraphic or geographic location, poor income of parents,\npoor education opportunities). On the other hand, the level\nof social adaptability may be the result of factors internal to\nthe individual, intrinsically associated with him/her (e.g.\nlack of motivation/energy, low IQ, limited developmental\nor intellectual resources, psychopathology, poor focus). In\nthe latter case, the individual might also drift towards social\nmaladaptation and underprivileged status (Figure 3). While\nunderlying factors are difficult to quantify and measure,\nSAI may be an adequate and easily measurable integrative\nindicator of belonging to underprivileged population. In\nother words, while SAI may have a causative relationship\nwith inferior clinical outcome, it cannot be established from\nthis analysis, and it is probably more practical to think of\nSAI as an indicator that signifies belonging to a disadvan-\ntaged population. In other words, it is not that poor educa-\ntion and income, lack of family and employment, and\nsubstance abuse would necessarily cause inferior outcome\n(although such link can also be postulated), but rather be a\nsign of belonging to disadvantaged group with higher risk\nof mortality.\nIn this project, we validated SAI by survival analysis,\nwhere every additional point in SAI reduced the risk of\ndeath roughly by 12%, and there was a `dose\u00addependent'\nassociation between greater SAI quintile and longer sur-\nvival. These results are not only statistically significant,\nbut also are clinically highly relevant.\nPractical implications and use of SAI, as well as poten-\ntial intervention, deserve special mentioning. Using SAI as\na tool in practice may have deep ethical and political im-\nplications (e.g. suggestion of equal access to care) not dis-\ncussed in this report. Furthermore, here we propose three\npotential ways the results may be applied in practice.\n(i) SAI is easy to calculate and interpret; it is easily mea-\nsurable integrative indicator of belonging to underprivi-\nleged population and can be used as such for the\npurpose of clinical practice (identifying patients at risk)\nand research (defining high risk group for intervention).\nOur definition of underprivileged population at risk for\npoor outcomes should be more sensitive and specific com-\npared to traditional indicators, such as race and gender.\nThis definition (based on the SAI) can be used by both\npractitioners and researchers to identify the group of sub-\njects at risk for inferior outcome and target them for inter-\nvention or study. Researchers and practitioners can use\nSAI in designing interventions or clinical studies instead\nof defining groups based on race, gender or geographic lo-\ncation. This may lead to a greater accuracy and efficient\ninterventions. The authors believe that establishing SAI\nas a new classifier represents a very important practical as-\npect of this study.\n(ii) SAI may be used as an additional factor in decision\nanalysis, where risks are weighed against the benefits. This\nis a complex issue, and care should be taken not to deepen\nexisting disparities, where underprivileged population with\nlower SAI would be denied care in an effort to limit the\nrisk of therapy. To the contrary, we think that SAI can be\nused as a tool to reduce disparities, so that individuals with\nlower SAI can be given more attention.\n(iii) Understanding the association of SAI with the out-\ncome may help to define appropriate specific intervention\n(discussed below) in order to reduce the difference in out-\ncome, which potentially could reduce the degree of health-\ncare disparities. Furthermore, measuring SAI over time\nmay be used as a monitoring tool of some of the interven-\ntion programmes.\nFinally, knowing that lower SAI is associated with in-\nferior clinical outcome, the question becomes, is it possi-\nble to design intervention to change it? Using our\nconceptual model (Figure 3), the potential intervention\ncan be applied either (i) proximal to SAI (addressing fac-\ntors causing lower SAI); (ii) to factors comprising SAI (to\nsee if any of the individual components of SAI can be\nmodified); or (iii) intervene downstream from SAI, ad-\ndressing the consequences of lower SAI, such as poor\nhealth literacy, non-compliance, disinterest in one's medi-\ncal care and healthy lifestyle. We briefly discuss these three\npotential approaches.\nOne may consider an intervention to address primary\nfactors causing (or underlying) disadvantaged status, poor\nsocial adaptability and low SAI. Theoretically, the inter-\nvention can be designed to address underlying factors\ncausing lower SAI. As it is illustrated in Figure 3, factors\nleading to lower social adaptability might be intrinsic to\nsubject (lack of motivation, lower IQ, etc.), as well as re-\nlated to the environment (poor neighbourhood, less oppor-\ntunity to study and seek employment). Addressing factors\nrelated to the subject's environment is outside the focus of\ntraditional healthcare and probably has to do more with\ngeneral concept of fairness and social justice. Furthermore,\nprojects addressing these factors under the concept of so-\ncial justice might require large resources from the society.\nIn other words, theoretically, if the socioeconomic status of\nthe population is a plain field with absolute equality in all\nsocial aspects of societal living, the disparities in healthcare\nshould cease to exist. Addressing factors that are intrinsic to\nthe individual is equally, if not more challenging (improv-\ning one's motivation and focus, interest in studying and pro-\nductive life), and clearly beyond the focus of this paper.\nNext, the possibility for intervention is addressing the\nSAI itself. It is arguable whether individual components\nof SAI are modifiable or not. However, even if effective in-\ntervention is found (encouraging single individuals to cre-\nate families, providing additional education, discouraging\nsubstance abuse, etc.), it is not clear if such intervention\nwould necessarily improve the outcome. The association\nbetween SAI and survival has been observed in this project;\nthe question still remains though, if the association is caus-\native. In the conceptual model that we propose, the lower\nSAI might be either (i) a mediator of inferior outcome, or\n(ii) a separate outcome, which, while correctly labelling the\ngroup at risk, does not necessarily cause poor clinical out-\ncome. In the former case, one can speculate that indeed\nimproving individual components of SAI (i.e. employment\nstatus, income) might provide better access to healthcare,\nbetter education might cause improved health literacy, and\nbeing married would provide a social support system. In\nthat case, the intervention indeed might be helpful. Would\nit be then advisable to tell patients to get married before\nkidney transplant, to go back to college prior to cardiac\nsurgery and to seek higher income to reduce the number\nof potential diabetic complications? It is an interesting is-\nsue to speculate. However, we would be somewhat scepti-\ncal that such intervention would necessarily change the\noutcome if factors intrinsic to the patient and patient's en-\nvironment are not addressed. We do feel that inferior clin-\nical outcome is the result of the interplay between patient\nenvironment, social factors, patient characteristics, etc. On\nthe other hand, if SAI is merely an indicator of disadvan-\ntaged status (in terms of underlying individual characteris-\ntics and the environment), intervening on the components\nof SAI will be ineffective. In reality, it might be a combi-\nnation of these two cases. Furthermore, it seems to be very\nhard to design effective and practical intervention directly\naffecting the SAI.\nIn our opinion, the most practical way to intervene is to\naffect the downstream effects of the SAI by using intensified\neducation or perhaps psychosocial support in patients with\nlow SAI. In our conceptual model, we postulated that poor\nSAI would potentially cause other factors that would be di-\nrectly related to clinical outcome, e.g. poor health-care liter-\nacy and non-compliance, being withdrawn from care,\npaying less attention to symptoms and experiencing objec-\ntive barriers to adherence. Studies demonstrate that health\nTherefore, addressing these issues in our opinion would\nbe the most practical and effective intervention in the group\nof subjects at higher risk (i.e. lower SAI). Along these lines,\nwe propose that effective intervention might be developed in\nthe form of education programme, whereby people with\nlower SAI would be selected for focused education targeting\nhealth literacy and compliance. Indeed, it has been shown\nthat patient education prior to beginning of dialysis leads\nto lower complication rates [42] and improved survival\n[43]. Authors from Taiwan demonstrated that pre-dialysis\neducation in patients with early CKD may slow the progres-\nsion of kidney insufficiency [44].\nThe limitations of the study should be mentioned. This\nis a retrospective project based on existing data from\nNHANES. Prospective observational study would provide\nSocial adaptability index and mortality 3679\nstronger evidence. Reverse causality described elsewhere\n[45] should be considered as well. That would be the\ncase where individuals with an increased probability of\ndying move towards underprivileged strata of the society\nwith lower SAI. However, our models were adjusted for\nco-morbidity and a large number of other health status\nindicators, and still, the results remained consistent with\nprimary hypothesis and robust. Finally, the NHANES\npopulation is representative of the US population only\nto a limited extent, since the data collection strategy\nwas aimed at higher representation of African Americans\nand Hispanics. To address this issue, weighted analysis\nmay be used, although we decided against that, as the\npopulation of the study with higher representation of tra-\nditionally underprivileged subjects might present a good\nopportunity to test our primary hypothesis. Furthermore,\nother limitation of NHANES has to do with the fact that\nit is a cross-sectional survey, and serum creatinine used to\ncalculate GFR was collected only at one point in time\n[1]. The cross-sectional study has other significant limita-\ntions: it does not take into account the variations in SAI\nwith time. However, even with these limitations, the as-\nsociation between SAI and survival was strong and dose-\ndependent. Still, prospective analysis with longitudinal\nmeasurements of SAI would be more informative.\nIn conclusion, we have developed an indicator of social\nadaptability that has a strong association with survival in\nthe CKD population and in various subgroups. This indi-\ncator can be used to identify underprivileged populations\nexposed to greater risk of poor outcome and target them\nfor future interventions in a more accurate and specific\nway than traditionally defined demographic groups.\nConflict of interest statement.
