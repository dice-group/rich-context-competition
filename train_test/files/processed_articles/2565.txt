Suglia, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, 722 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032\nAlthough depression symptoms have been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among adults, little is\nknown about the association of adolescent-onset depression and development of T2DM in young adulthood and\nwhether the association differs by sex. We examined the association between high levels of depressive symptoms\nin adolescence and T2DM in adulthood in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n =\n12,657). Adolescents completed the 20-item version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale during\nwave 1 (mean age, 16 years) and the 10-item version during follow-up (mean age, 29 years). A high level of depres-\nsive symptoms was defined as a score of 16 or higher on the 20-item version or 11 or higher on the 10-item version.\nT2DM was identified 13 years after baseline on the basis of either a glycated hemoglobin concentration of at least\n6.5% or use of hypoglycemic medication (with or without insulin). Participants who reported taking insulin alone\nwere classified as having type 1 diabetes mellitus and excluded. In models adjusted for demographic characteris-\ntics, women were at a higher risk of developing T2DM if they experienced high levels of depressive symptoms dur-\ning both adolescence and adulthood (odds ratio = 1.96, 95% confidence interval: 1.23, 3.11) than were those who\ndid not experience a high level of symptoms at either time point. No statistically significant associations were noted\ncumulative effects; depression; diabetes; life course; mental health; young adults\nAbbreviations: Add Health, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health; BMI, body mass index; CES-D, Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; HbA1c\n, glycated hemoglobin; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nAdults with depression are more likely to develop type 2\ndiabetes mellitus (T2DM), as well as insulin resistance (1,\n2). Existing studies have mainly considered the association\nbetween adult mental health and adult diabetes (2, 3), not\ntaking into account the increasing evidence that mental (4),\ncardiovascular, and metabolic disorders (5) begin early in\nchildhood and adolescence. Reliance on assessments in adult-\nhood of both depression and T2DM has limited the ability of\ninvestigators in most studies to address temporality, which\nraises the possibility of reverse causation, in which subclini-\ncal T2DM risk factors contribute to both depression and clin-\nical T2DM development later in life. Because risk factors and\nhealth behaviors known to affect obesity and diabetes can\npersist from childhood to adolescence and into adulthood\n(6, 7), a life-course framework for studying the etiology of\nT2DM is crucial.\nAdolescence is an important period of development be-\ncause many health behaviors are established during these for-\nmative years (8). Adolescent depression has been associated\nwith overweight and obesity in adulthood (9, 10), and adoles-\ncent onset of depression is associated with both persistence of\ndepression into adulthood and the development of other co-\nmorbid psychiatric disorders throughout the life course (11).\nTo our knowledge, there have been only 2 studies in which\nthe longitudinal relationship between adolescent mental\nhealth and the development of diabetes has been examined.\nIn a small study of primarily overweight or obese children,\nShomaker et al. (12) noted a significant association between\ndepression symptoms in childhood and insulin resistance\nin adolescence. In a larger study based on the 1946 British\nCohort Study, adolescent affective disorder was associated\nwith diabetes mellitus at age 53 years (13). These results suggest\nAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\n\u00a9 The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of\nPublic Health.

However, it is not known\nwhether depression symptoms in adolescence influence T2DM\nrisk in the absence of adult depression symptoms or whether\nit is the continuity of depression symptoms from adolescence\nto adulthood that most strongly influences risk.\nSex differences in the relationship between obesity and de-\npression have been documented, with associations noted among\nwomen but not men (14). Recently, using data from the First\nNational Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, Demmer\net al. (15) reported an association between depressive symp-\ntomatology and incident diabetes among women but not men.\nDifferential behavioral responses or physiological mechanisms\nmight contribute to potential sex differences. Women might be\nmore likely to cope with stress and mental health symptoms by\nengaging in obesogenic behaviors, and men might be more\nlikely to cope by engaging in behaviors that do not promote\nobesity (16). Physiological responses to depression, such as\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and inflam-\nmation, are also implicated in both depression and diabetes and\nhave been noted to differ between sexes (17). Although the\nmechanisms for this relationship are not fully known, it is plau-\nsible that behavioral changes that accompany depression, such\nas changes in dietary choices, sleep patterns, and physical activ-\nity level, might play a role. In addition, inflammatory processes\nand hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation might be\nactivated as a direct result of depression symptoms and in turn\nIn the present study, we examined the relationship of de-\npression symptoms during adolescence and young adulthood\nwith the development of T2DM in adulthood in data from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health\n(Add Health). We tested whether high levels of depressive\nsymptoms experienced in adolescence only, adulthood only,\nor both developmental periods increased the odds of develop-\ning T2DM in adulthood. We also examined whether sex dif-\nferences appeared in this association.\nMETHODS\nStudy population\nAdd Health is a nationally representative, school-based,\nlongitudinal study of the health-related behaviors of adoles-\ncents and their outcomes in adulthood. A questionnaire was\nadministered in 132 schools in the United States to a nation-\nally representative sample of students in grades 7 through 12,\nplus selected oversampled minority groups, stratified by age\nstudy design has been described in detail previously (21).\nBriefly, a stratified random sample of public and private\nhigh schools that was representative of US schools was se-\nlected with respect to region of country, urbanicity, size, type,\nand ethnic makeup of the student body.\nEligible schools included an 11th grade and enrolled more\nthan 30 students. The first wave of in-home interviews was con-\nolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years completed the\nin-home questionnaire. During wave 4 of follow-up, 15,701 par-\nticipants were interviewed. In the present analyses, participants\nwere excluded if data were missing for sampling weights (n =\nhigh levels of depressive symptoms at either time point (n =\n101), orcovariates of interest (n = 237) or if they reported a preg-\nnancy during wave 4 (n = 444) or a diabetes diagnosis before\nage 16 years (n = 34). Participants whowere taking insulin alone\nin adulthood (n = 37) were also excluded from the analyses be-\ncause they were more likely to have type 1 diabetes mellitus.\nOur study sample included 12,657 participants who com-\npleted waves 1 and 4 and met inclusion criteria. Sampleweights\ndesigned for analyzing Add Health data include baseline\nselection probabilities and school-level clustering, as well\nas inverse probability weights to account for longitudinal at-\ntrition (22). Add Health was approved by the Institutional Re-\nview Board of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\nThe Institutional Review Board of Columbia University,\nNew York, approved these analyses.\nDiabetes\nDuring wave 4 (mean age of participants, 29 years), an in-\nhome assessment was conducted. HbA1c\nwas assayed from\nspots of dried capillary whole blood collected from finger\npricks during the home visit. HbA1c\nconcentration measured\nfrom dried blood samples has been shown to have good\nagreement with fresh whole blood samples (23). Participants\nreported use of medications for diabetes (categories included\nsulfonylureas, nonsulfonylureas, insulin, -glucosidase in-\nhibitors, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, antidiabetic com-\nbinations, and miscellaneous antidiabetic agents) anytime\nduring the previous 4 weeks. T2DM was defined as an HbA1c\nconcentration of at least 6.5% (n = 429) or use of diabetes med-\nication with or without insulin (n = 123). Participants who re-\nported a diabetes diagnosis before the age of 16 years were\nexcluded from the analyses. Self-report of a diabetes diagnosis\nis considered a valid method for identifying diabetes (24\u00ad26).\nAs in previous studies (27), we classified participants who re-\nported taking insulin alone as having type 1 diabetes mellitus\nand excluded them from the analyses.\nDepression symptoms\nParticipants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies\nDepression Scale (CES-D) at 2 time points. The 20-item ver-\nsion (CESD-20) was administered in wave 1 (mean age, 16\nyears), and the 10-item version (CES-D-10) was administered\nin wave 4 (mean age, 29 years) (28). The CES-D is a widely\nused measure with well-documented reliability and validity\ntablished guidelines (33). Symptoms of depression during the\n13-year study period were characterized as occurring in adoles-\ncence only, in both adolescence and adulthood, or in adulthood\nonly or as not occurring in either time period.\nCovariates\nWave 4 questionnaires contained questions about socio-\ndemographic factors, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and\nhighest level of education achieved. In adulthood, the catego-\nries for highest level of education were less than high school,\nhigh school graduate, some college, and college graduate or\nhigher. Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, sleep duration,\nand physical activity were assessed at both wave 1 (adoles-\ncence) and wave 4 (adulthood). In both adolescence and\nadulthood, current daily smoking was defined as smoking\nat least 1 cigarette per day in the previous 30 days. Physical\nactivity was defined by the number of bouts of moderate to\nvigorous physical activity per week based on self-report in\nboth adolescence and adulthood. Alcohol consumption in\nadolescence was defined as any episode of heavy drinking in\nthe previous year, characterized for men as 5 or more drinks\nper drinking occasion and for women as 4 or more drinks per\ndrinking occasion. Alcohol consumption in adulthood was\ndefined for men as consuming more than 2 drinks per drink-\ning occasion and for women as consuming more than 1 drink\nper drinking occasion.\nAt wave 1, adolescents were asked, \"How many hours of\nsleep do you usually get?\" The current sleep recommenda-\ntions for adolescents range from 8 to 9 hours of sleep per\nnight, depending on the entity that issued the recommenda-\ntions (34). Short sleep duration in adolescence was defined\nas fewer than 8 hours of sleep per night. In adulthood,\nshort sleep duration was defined as fewer than 6 hours of\nsleep per night.\nIn adolescence and adulthood, height and weight were\nmeasured by trained study staff in the participants' homes.\nBody mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) was calcu-\nlated from measured height and weight. If measured height or\nweight data were missing, self-reported height and weight\nwere used for BMI calculations. Because some of the adoles-\ncents were younger than 18 years of age, we calculated BMI\npercentiles, which account for the child's sex and age and are\nconsidered to be more appropriate than the World Health Or-\nganization classification of obesity for adults based on BMI\nBMI growth references (36) were used to determine age-\nand sex-specific BMI percentiles. In adulthood, BMI was cal-\nculated from height and weight measured during home visits\nby trained study staff.\nStatistical analyses\nAfter excluding 34 participants who reported a diabetes di-\nagnosis in adolescence, we used logistic regression models\nstratified by sex to estimate the associations of high levels\nof depressive symptoms in adolescence, adulthood, and\nboth adolescence and adulthood with T2DM in adulthood.\nThe incidence of diabetes in the study sample was low\nWe ran 3 models. The first model was adjusted for sociode-\nmographic factors (age, educational level, and race/ethnicity).\nThe second model was adjusted for sociodemographic fac-\ntors, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity,\nand sleep duration during adulthood. The third model was\nadjusted for sociodemographic factors, BMI, smoking, alco-\nhol consumption, physical activity, and sleep duration in ad-\nolescence and adulthood. All models were stratified by sex,\naccounted for US region of residence and clustering at the\nschool level, and were weighted to account for the sampling\ndesign (37). Analyses were carried out using SUDAAN, ver-\nsion 11.0 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina), according to the guidelines specified for the anal-\nyses of Add Health Data (37).\nAdd Health used a school-based design in which the pri-\nmary sampling units were schools, so we therefore accounted\nfor clustering at the school level. The poststratification vari-\nable is the region of residence, and we thus stratified for re-\ngion of residence as well. Sampling weights were calculated\nby the Add Health investigators to account for the unequal\nprobability of selection of study participants. We used a lon-\ngitudinal weight derived specifically for the sample of partic-\nipants who responded in waves 1\u00ad4 of follow-up. These\nweights account for the inverse probability of retention in\nthe sample. Analyses of the wave 4 sample indicated negligi-\nble bias from nonresponse between wave 1 and wave 4 (22).\nFormal tests for interaction were performed using a fully ad-\njusted logistic regression interaction model that included var-\niables for sex and depression symptoms and an interaction\nterm that combined them. Depression symptoms were char-\nacterized as occurring only in adulthood, only in adoles-\ncence, or in both adolescence and adulthood. F-tests were\nused to determine statistical significance.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the distribution of high levels of depressive\nsymptoms, T2DM, and study covariates. The sample com-\nprised mostly white (67%) men and women who were an av-\nerage of 29 years of age at the time of the wave 4 follow-up in\n3.8% in women. The majority of participants (76%) with\nT2DM were not taking diabetes medications. A higher prev-\nalence of depression symptoms was noted among women in\nboth adolescence and adulthood. In adolescence, 25% of\nwomen and 15% men experienced high levels of depressive\nof men experienced high levels of depressive symptoms (P <\n0.05). Health behaviors in adulthood differed by sex in that\nmen were more likely to smoke, be physically active, and\nsleep less than 6 hours per night in adulthood (P < 0.05)\n(Table 1).\nBMI in either adolescence or adulthood was associated\nwith the risk of T2DM among both men and women. No\nhealth behavior during adolescence or adulthood was associ-\nated with T2DM among men or women (data not shown).\nShort sleep duration and current smoking were associated\nwith high levels of depressive symptoms in both men and\nwomen in adolescence and adulthood (Appendix Table 1).\nAlcohol consumption in adolescence was associated with\nhigh levels of depressive symptoms in both men and women\nin adolescence. Greater physical activity in adolescence was\nassociated with lower odds of adolescent depression symp-\ntoms among men and women. Consumption of alcohol, as\ndefined in Methods, and greater physical activity were asso-\nciated with lower odds of depression symptoms among men\nin adulthood (Appendix Table 1).\nThe incidence of T2DM varied by the presence of de-\npression symptoms (Table 2). Among women who did not\nDepressive Symptoms and Development of Diabetes 271\nexperience high levels of depressive symptoms in either ad-\nolescence or adulthood, the incidence of T2DM was 3.0%;\namong women who experienced high levels of depressive\nsymptoms in adolescence, adulthood, or both, it ranged\nfrom 4.1% to 7.5%. Among men who did not experience\nhigh levels of depressive symptoms, the incidence of T2DM\nwas 3.3%. The incidence of T2DM among men who experi-\nenced high levels of depressive symptoms varied: Men with\nhigh levels of depressive symptoms in adolescence only had\nthe highest incidence of T2DM, at 4.3%, and those who ex-\nperienced high levels of depressive symptoms in both adoles-\ncence and adulthood had the lowest incidence of T2DM, at\nAs shown in Table 3, after adjustment for sociodemo-\ngraphic factors, women who experienced high levels of depres-\nsive symptoms in both adolescence and adulthood (compared\nwith women without high levels of depressive symptoms in\neither period) had a higher risk of T2DM (odds ratio = 1.96,\nTable 1.

However, the same association was\nnot observed among men. These findings suggest that the\nonset of depression early in life might set up a trajectory of\nrisk for T2DM among women.\nAlthough sex-specific risks among adults have been sug-\ngested in other studies, to our knowledge there has been no\nother study in which sex differences in depression and diabe-\ntes among younger populations have been examined (38).\nAmong adolescents, there is evidence of a sex-differentiated\nassociation between depression and obesity. Similar to our\nfindings, in a study conducted among adolescents in New\nZealand, Richardson et al. (9) noted that depression in ado-\nlescence was associated with obesity in adulthood among\ngirls only. Different coping mechanisms among men and\nwomen have been proposed as explanations for sex differ-\nences in the development of metabolic disorders. However,\nour analyses in which we examined behavioral factors in\nadolescence and adulthood suggest a relationship between\nweight status, health behaviors (sleep duration, physical ac-\ntivity level, smoking status, and alcohol consumption), and\ndepression that is similar across sexes and therefore not likely\nto account for the observed differences. Physiological sex\ndifferences in the response to depression are plausible (e.g.,\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation). In future\nstudies, investigators should explore whether sex-differentiated\nresponses to depression in relation to diabetes are explained\nby hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation or other\nphysiological pathways.\nAn association between symptoms of depression and\nT2DM might be attributable to obesity and behavioral factors\nsuch as lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol consump-\ntion, and short sleep duration. In our analyses, adjustment for\nTable 2.

A relationship be-\ntween depressive symptomatology and higher BMI, as well\nas lower dietary quality, has been reported previously (39).\nTherefore, behavioral factors and obesity might account for\nthe association, and the potential relationship should be ex-\nplored further.\nThe present study has some limitations. First, a screening\ntest rather than a diagnostic measure was used to identify de-\npression. However, the CES-D is a widely used test with\nwell-documented reliability and validity (29\u00ad32). Second, al-\nthough we adjusted for potential confounding factors such as\nphysical activity level, smoking, alcohol consumption, and\nsleep duration, we have no information on dietary habits,\nwhich were not assessed in the present study. Third, we did\nnot have information on laboratory-measured HbA1c\nconcen-\ntrations in adolescence, and we relied on self-reported diabe-\ntes status before the adult assessment. However, because of\nthe low overall prevalence of T2DM among adolescents--\nless than 1% (27, 40)--it is unlikely that the associations\nwe noted could be due to reverse causality. Fourth, although\nwe were able to assess a longitudinal relationship between de-\npressive symptoms in adolescence and T2DM in adulthood,\ndepressive symptoms and T2DM in adulthood were assessed\nsimultaneously; because of the cross-sectional nature of the\nassessment, we cannot establish temporality. Finally, we re-\nlied on measured HbA1c\nconcentrations and on the use of in-\nsulin alone in adulthood to determine the type of diabetes in\nthe sample, as was done in other studies (27). We therefore\nmight have excluded persons with T2DM who were treated\nsolely with insulin and included persons with type 1 diabetes\nmellitus who were treated with both metformin and insulin.\nHowever, we expect this potential for misclassification of\nT2DM to be small and not to be associated with high levels\nof depressive symptoms. We were also unable to distinguish\ncases of T2DM from maturity-onset diabetes of the young or\nlatent autoimmune diabetes in adults. However, maturity-onset\ndiabetes of the young is rare (41), and latent autoimmune dia-\nbetes in adults is typically not diagnosed until after the age of\n35 years (older than all of the participants in the present study\nwere at follow-up) (41, 42); therefore, the potential for misclas-\nsification is small.\nThe present study also has a number of strengths. We used\na nationally representative sample of US adolescents in high\nschool. The ethnic and geographic diversity of the present\nsample increased its relevance and translatability to contem-\nporary US adolescents. In addition, T2DM in adulthood was\nassessed using objectively measured HbA1c\nconcentrations to\nminimize possible measurement bias. Finally, we took a life-\ncourse approach, examining the long-term impact of high lev-\nels of depressive symptoms from adolescence into adulthood.\nThe rise in the rate of obesity during the past 2 decades has\nled to a dramatic increase in the number of adolescents and\nadults with T2DM, particularly among minority populations\n(43). Our finding of a 3%\u00ad4% incidence of T2DM in a nation-\nally representative sample of 29-year-old persons, which is\nhigher than in previous samples (27, 44), warrants a focus on\nthe identification and prevention of risk factors early in the\nlife course. Because adolescents who are depressed are more\nlikely to be depressed as adults, it is prudent to begin preven-\ntion efforts early.\n"
