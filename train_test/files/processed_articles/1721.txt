Inflammation has been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis;\ntherefore, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has the\npotential of decreasing the risk of prostate cancer. However, to the authors' knowl-\nedge the precise correlation between oral NSAID use, serum prostate-specific\nantigen (PSA), and prostate cancer risk is unknown. To further characterize this\nassociation, the authors evaluated serum PSA levels with regard to NSAID and\nacetaminophen consumption in a large cross-sectional study of men in the US.\n2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Linear\nregressions were performed on log-transformed PSA levels, accounting for the\ncomplex survey design, to evaluate the relations between PSA and the use of\nNSAIDs and acetaminophen after adjusting for the effects of age, race, educa-\ntional level, smoking status, body mass index, coexisting inflammatory condi-\ntions, and heart disease.\nRESULTS. NSAID and acetaminophen consumption displayed a negative associa-\ntion with PSA levels, namely, individuals who reported using NSAIDs (19.8%) or\nacetaminophen (1.3%) regularly had lower PSA levels than individuals who did\nnot take these drugs, although the impact of acetaminophen was not statistically\nsignificant. PSA levels among NSAID users were 0.9 times the levels among non-\ndrug takers (P 5.038), whereas PSA levels among acetaminophen users were 0.76\ntimes the levels in nondrug takers (P 5 .14). Individuals who stated they took\nboth NSAIDs and acetaminophen (0.99%) on a regular basis had higher PSA\nlevels (1.8 times greater), although not statistically significantly so (P 5 .24), than\nindividuals who stated they did not take either of these drugs regularly.\nCONCLUSIONS. The findings of the current study suggest that regular NSAID con-\nsumption may reduce serum PSA levels. Whether this is indicative of a protective\neffect on prostate cancer risk or masks possible prostate injury resulting in\nreduced detection of prostate cancer is unclear. Given the widespread consump-\ntion of NSAIDs and the regular use of PSA for the assessment of prostate cancer\nrisk, the potential implications of the current study's findings may be substantial\nCancer Society.\nKEYWORDS: prostate-specific antigen, nonsteroidal anti\u00adinflammatory drug, acet-\naminophen, inflammation, epidemiology.\nProstate cancer is a significant burden on men's health.

Because\nserum PSA levels are indicative of prostatic injury or\ninflammation and are also used to assess a man's\nrisk for prostate cancer, we evaluated the association\nbetween the use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\nStudy Population\nof such surveys to determine PSA levels in men aged\nmeasured in 1320 eligible men after excluding men\nwho reported having any of the following conditions:\ncurrent infection or inflammation of the prostate\ngland, rectal examination within the past week, pros-\ntate biopsy within the past month, cystoscopy within\nthe past month, history of prostate cancer, or were\nmissing data concerning any of these eligibility crite-\nria.18 For the current analysis, we used total PSA\nlevels.\nExplanatory Variables\nMedication history was characterized as current, reg-\nular (``nearly every day'') consumption of NSAIDS\n(including aspirin) or acetaminophen; both; or no\ncurrent intake. Unfortunately, dosing information, in-\ndication for use, and chronicity were not available\nthrough the NHANES database. One participant was\nexcluded from the analysis because of missing data\nregarding the consumption of NSAIDs or acetamino-\nphen, resulting in a final dataset of 1319 men. Other\ncovariates considered to be potential risk factors for\nelevated PSA levels include age (continuous or cate-\nyears), race (white, black, and other), education\n(<high school, high school, and >high school), body\nstatus (dichotomous: ever vs never), history of any\ninflammatory disease (dichotomous: yes vs no;\nincludes asthma, hay fever, arthritis, emphysema, and\nchronic bronchitis), and history of any heart disease\n(dichotomous: yes vs no; includes congestive heart\nfailure, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack,\nand stroke) (Table 1). Data regarding the use of 5-\nalpha reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and\ndutasteride, which are used in the medical manage-\nment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and are known\nto decrease serum PSA values, were not available.19\nStatistical Analysis\nLinear regression was performed on log-transformed\nPSA levels (untransformed PSA levels displayed a\nleft-skewed distribution) to evaluate the correlations\nbetween PSA and the use of NSAIDs or acetamino-\nphen. Age, race, educational level, smoking status,\nBMI, coexisting inflammatory conditions, and heart\ndisease were chosen a priori as covariates in our\nregression model.

Acetaminophen had\nbeen believed to act via inhibition of the COX-3\npathway,27 but later evidence refuted this theory.28\nRecently, acetaminophen has been suggested to\nselectively inhibit the COX-2 pathway in ex vivo and\nin vitro studies involving humans.29\nSeveral systematic reviews have examined the\nrelation between NSAID/aspirin consumption and\nthe risk of developing prostate cancer. In their meta-\nanalysis of 12 reports, Mahmud et al30 found that as-\npirin use provided a 10% risk reduction for prostate\ncancer overall (summary odds ratio [OR] of 0.90; 95%\nrisk reduction for advanced disease (OR of 0.70; 95%\nNSAID use (which included aspirin) was associated\nwith a 39% risk reduction for prostate cancer (rela-\net al32 demonstrated in their cohort study that daily\nlong-term aspirin use was associated with an\nAnalysis of PSA Level in Relation to Current NSAID Use\nDrug Type\nPSA Level: Crude Analysis Multiple Linear Regression*\nPSA indicates prostate-specific antigen; NSAID, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; SE, standard error.\n*log(PSA) regressed as a function of NSAID use, age, race, educational status, smoking status, body mass index, history of inflammatory conditions, and history\nof heart conditions.\nyInterpretation: PSA level among NSAID user 0.9 (e20.10) times the PSA level among those taking no medication.\nPSA Levels With NSAID and Acetaminophen Use/Singer et al 2055\napproximately 20% lower incidence of prostate can-\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging,\nwhich also examined acetaminophen consumption\nin addition to NSAID/aspirin use, attempted to\ndetermine their effects on serum PSA and the risk of\ndeveloping prostate cancer.

Platz et al33 were reassured by the lack of\nclear correlation between NSAIDs and serum PSA, as\nreductions in PSA due to decreased inflammation\nmay lower the number of men referred for prostate\nbiopsy, thereby decreasing the number of men diag-\nnosed with prostate cancer (incidence) without truly\naltering the natural history of the disease.\nWe are not aware of other publications directly\nreporting on the correlation between NSAID and\nacetaminophen use and serum PSA levels. However,\nseveral original observational studies and reviews of\nthe literature have suggested that NSAIDs may have\na role in the chemoprevention of prostate can-\nstand in contrast to those found in the Baltimore\nLongitudinal Study of Aging. Although both studies\ndocument a nonstatistically significant decrease in\nserum PSA in men taking acetaminophen, to our\nknowledge only the results of the current study\nrevealed a significant negative association between\nNSAID consumption and serum PSA concentration.\nThe difference between these 2 studies is unclear.\nThe limitations of the current study include the\nuse of cross-sectional data that does not provide in-\nformation regarding temporality of association. In\naddition, the NHANES database does not have\ndetailed descriptions of medication dosing and fre-\nquency, and acetaminophen users comprised a small\npercentage of the overall drug takers, thereby limiting\nthe conclusions that can be drawn from its use. Con-\nsumption of medications known to decrease serum\nPSA, such as finasteride and dutasteride, were not\nrecorded in by the NHANES instrument. Although\nthe NHANES database lacks information regarding\nprostate biopsies (presence/absence of inflammation,\nadenoma, or adenocarcinoma) or the number of\nmen eventually diagnosed with prostate cancer,\nNHANES does capture a nationally representative\ncross-section of American men and collects informa-\ntion on many potentially important covariates, such\nas those accounted for in Table 1 of our study. The\nunexpected finding that concomitant use of both\nNSAIDs and acetaminophen was associated with\nincreased PSA levels, although not significantly so,\nmay be because of the low number of subjects in\nthose categories (<1% of the total study population)\nwith a corresponding lack of statistical accuracy, and\nlikely does not indicate a biologic effect.\nConclusions\nThe interplay between NSAID consumption and se-\nrum PSA is complex and may involve a variety of dif-\nferent pathways and variables. Nevertheless, the\nresults of the current study are consistent with previ-\nous reports that NSAID use is a protective factor for\nthe development of prostate cancer. Conversely,\nNSAIDs may reduce serum PSA levels without truly\naffecting the natural history of prostate carcinogene-\nsis, and may result in the underdiagnosis of this con-\ndition. The widespread use of PSA screening and the\nhigh rate of consumption of NSAIDs in the general\npopulation suggest further study is warranted to clar-\nify the potential impact of this class of drugs on\nprostate cancer development and diagnosis using\nlarge epidemiologic studies with a prospective design\nand collecting more detailed information regarding\nNSAID use.\nREFERENCES\n1.
