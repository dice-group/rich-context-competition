Activity of AMPK and\nphospho-AMPK, acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase (ACC), phospho-ACC and heat shock protein-70\n(Hsp70) were also measured using Western blot. Food intake and grip strength were recorded;\nbody composition was analysed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Motor neuron survival\nwas observed using Nissl staining.\nResults: AMPK activity increased and Hsp70 expression decreased in AL SOD1G93A mice\ncompared with SOD1WT mice in spinal cord and hindlimb muscle. Compared with AL SOD1G93A\nmice, CR SOD1G93A mice showed increased AMPK activity, downregulated Hsp70 expression,\nreduced motor neuron survival in spinal cord and hindlimb muscle and reduced lifespan; HFD\nSOD1G93A mice showed opposite effects.\nConclusions: In this mouse model, increased AMPK activity seems to play a negative role in\nmotor neuron survival, possibly through a novel mechanism involving Hsp70 downregulation.\nThese changes can be modified by diet. Inhibition of AMPK may provide a therapeutic strategy\nfor ALS.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\nDepartment of Neurology, Peking University Third\nHospital, Beijing, China\nCorresponding author:\nDongsheng Fan, Department of Neurology, Peking\nUniversity Third Hospital, 49 North Garden Road, Haidian\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\n",

AMPK is activated\nduring energy stress by various upstream\nkinases via phosphorylation of threonine\nDownstream consequences of AMPK acti-\nvation include increased glucose uptake and\nfatty acid oxidation, and the inhibition of\ncholesterol, lipid and protein synthesis.8\nSince neurons are sensitive to energy fluc-\ntuations as they execute energy-demanding\nfunctions without efficiently storing nutrients,\nAMPK is essential for neuronal integrity and\nsurvival.9 AMPK activation protects primary\nneuronal cultures from excitotoxicity and\nother insults;10 however, some experimental\nwork has suggested that AMPK activation\ncould be detrimental in animal models of\nHuntington's disease.14 In the present study,\nactivity levels of AMPK and its downstream\ntargets acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase and\nheat shock protein-70 were compared in\nand the effects of calorie restrictive and\nhigh-fat diets were assessed.

Increased\nAMPK phosphorylation in AL SOD1G93A\nmice compared with wild-type controls has\nbeen confirmed in spinal cord tissue, with\naccumulation of pAMPK seen in cytoplas-\nmic granules within motor neurons, but also\nin peripheral tissues, liver and kidney.21 The\ninvolvement of AMPK in the modulation of\nheat shock protein gene expression is a novel\nmechanism of metabolic stress; several stu-\ndies have confirmed that AMPK activation\nproduces negative effects by inhibiting the\nexpression of Hsp70, while AMPK inhib-\nition produces neuroprotective effects via\nthe enhancement of Hsp70 expression in\nstroke models.22 The mechanisms that con-\nnect AMPK activation to Hsp70 expression\nrequire further investigation. Heat shock\nproteins are molecular chaperones that\nassist in the proper folding of newly synthe-\nsized proteins and proteins subjected to\nstress-induced denaturation.23 In contrast\nto other heat shock proteins, Hsp70 has\nbeen identified in almost all of the intracel-\nlular compartments.24 Motor neurons have\na weakened capacity to upregulate Hsp70\nunder stress conditions, making them more\nsusceptible to cell damage.25 Overexpression\nof Hsp70 reduced apoptosis in cerebral\nischaemia and increased expression of the\nanti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.23 Exogenous\ndelivery of Hsp70 extended the lifespan of\nFigure 5.

Therefore, AMPK activa-\ntion, resulting in Hsp70 downregulation,\nmay be harmful in ALS.\nThe main purposes of the present study\nwere to establish whether AMPK activation\nand the resulting detrimental effects could be\naltered by dietary changes in SOD1G93A\nmice.

Others have reported\nthat calorie restriction shortens lifespan\nthrough reductions in mitochondria, protein\noxidation and stress responses (Hsp70) in\npresent study also documented downregula-\nmice, suggesting that AMPK activation\nresulting in Hsp70 downregulation may be\nthe mechanism behind the accelerated clin-\nical onset and disease progression associated\nwith calorie restriction.\nIn contrast, in the present study HFD\nSOD1G93A mice showed increased weight\nand fat body mass, inhibition of AMPK\nactivity, upregulated Hsp70 expression,\ndecreased loss of motor neurons, delayed\ndisease onset and extended survival com-\npared with AL SOD1G93A mice. Others have\nreported that a high-fat diet inhibited\nAMPK activity and that this corresponded\nto significant increases in leptin and glucose\nlevels.29 The present study results are con-\nsistent with those of a report showing that a\nhigh-fat diet increased fat storage, improved\nmotor neuronal function and extended life-\nresults also showed that a highf-at diet was\nassociated with decreased activity of AMPK\nand increased Hsp70 expression. As reduced\nAMPK activity has been shown to be pro-\ntective in genetic models of motor neuron\ndisease,31 this may be part of the mechanism\nby which a high-fat diet protects motor\nneurons in SOD1G93A mice but not in\nmutant TDP-43 mice;21 this difference is\nlikely to be due to different energy metabol-\nism characteristics in these models.\nIn summary, the present study showed\nthat AMPK activity is increased and Hsp70\nexpression is downregulated in spinal cord\nand hindlimb muscle of SOD1G93A mice\ncompared with SOD1WT mice, in a manner\nthat can be predictably altered by diet. A\nhigh-fat diet inhibited AMPK activity and\nmotor neuron loss, upregulated Hsp70\nexpression, delayed disease onset and\nextended the lifespan of SOD1G93A mice,\nbut calorie restriction produced opposite\nresults. These findings suggest AMPK-\ninduced Hsp70 downregulation is a novel\nmechanism in the pathogenesis of ALS. The\nunderlying mechanisms responsible for\nAMPK activity and motor neuron\nloss require further study. Inhibition of\nAMPK may provide a therapeutic strategy\nfor ALS.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by grants from the\nNational Natural Sciences Foundation of China\nReferences\n1.
