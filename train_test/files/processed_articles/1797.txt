Triclosan is not acutely toxic to\nmammals (Bhargava and Leonard 1996), but it\ncan interact with cytochrome P450\u00addependent\nenzymes, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and\nthe human pregnane X receptor (Hanioka et al.\nThe relevance of these interactions is unknown.\nInformation about the known commercial\nuses of triclosan indicates that ingestion and\ndermal absorption are the most likely routes of\nEnglund et al. 2006). Radioactive triclosan is\nexcreted in feces, and to a lesser extent in\nurine, after topical exposure in rats (Moss\net al. 2000) and oral administration in mice\n(Kanetoshi et al. 1988). The extent of dermal\nabsorption of triclosan was examined both\nin vitro and in vivo in rats and humans (Moss\nabout 6.3% of triclosan had penetrated\nhuman skin compared with 23% for rat skin.\nThese data suggest that dermal absorption of\ntriclosan in humans is lower than in rats. In all\ncases, glucuronidation and to a lesser extent\nsulfation of triclosan occurred during passage\nthrough the skin. No oxidative metabolites\nwere detected in the urine in vivo or after\nabsorption through skin in vitro; the major\nurinary metabolites were triclosan glucuronide\nand sulfate (Moss et al. 2000). In another\nstudy, 10 healthy adult Swedish volunteers\nexposed to a single oral dose of 4 mg triclosan\nby swallowing an oral mouthwash solution,\nand the volunteers' plasma and urinary con-\ncentrations of triclosan were determined\n(Sandborgh-Englund et al. 2006). Triclosan\nconcentrations in plasma increased rapidly,\nwith a maximum concentration within\n1\u00ad3 hr; the estimated terminal plasma half-life\nwas 21 hr. The major fraction of the triclosan\ndose was excreted in urine within the first\n24 hr (calculated urinary excretion half-life\nwas 11 hr), and approached baseline levels\nwithin 8 days after exposure. A median oral\ndose of 54% was excreted in urine within the\nfirst 4 days after exposure. The percentage of\nfree triclosan in plasma was higher than in\nurine; in urine, triclosan was excreted mostly\nin its conjugated forms. These data suggest\nthat the concentrations of triclosan in urine\n(conjugated and free species) can be used as\nbiomarkers of exposure to triclosan.\nThe widespread use of triclosan has raised\ninterest about assessing human exposure to this\ncompound.

The geometric mean and 95th percentile concentrations were\na curvilinear relation between age and adjusted least square geometric mean (LSGM) concentra-\ntions of triclosan. LSGM concentrations of triclosan were higher in people in the high household\nincome than in people in low (p < 0.01) and medium (p = 0.04) income categories.\nCONCLUSIONS: In about three-quarters of urine samples analyzed as part of NHANES 2003\u00ad2004,\nwe detected concentrations of triclosan. Concentrations differed by age and socioeconomic status\nbut not by race/ethnicity and sex. Specifically, the concentrations of triclosan appeared to be high-\nest during the third decade of life and among people with the highest household incomes.\nKEY WORDS: 2,4,4\u00b4-trichloro-2\u00b4-hydroxydiphenyl ether, 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-phenol,\nbiomonitoring, exposure, human, Irgasan, NHANES 2003\u00ad2004, urine.

Some of\nthese specimens are used to assess exposure to\nmens for analyses of triclosan were collected\nfrom a random one-third subset of 2,517 par-\nticipants  6 years of age. Because the subset\nwas random, the representative design of the\nsurvey was maintained. The National Centers\nfor Health Statistics Institutional Review\nBoard reviewed and approved the study pro-\ntocol. Informed written consent was obtained\nfrom all participants.\nA single spot urine sample per participant\nwas collected during one of three daily exami-\nnation session periods (i.e., morning, after-\nnoon, evening). The samples were shipped on\ndry ice to CDC's National Center for\nEnvironmental Health and stored at or below\n\u00ad20\u00b0C until analyzed. We measured the con-\ncentrations of free plus conjugated triclosan,\nin 100 \u00b5L of urine, by online solid-phase\nextraction coupled to high-performance liq-\nuid chromatography\u00adisotope dilution\u00adtandem\nmass spectrometry, as described in detail else-\nwhere (Ye et al. 2005). Briefly, the conjugated\nspecies of triclosan were hydrolyzed by use of\n-glucuronidase/sulfatase (Helix pomatia,\nSt. Louis, MO) in 1 M ammonium acetate\npH 5 buffer (Sigma Chemical Co.). After\nhydrolysis, samples were acidified with 0.1M\nformic acid; triclosan was preconcentrated by\nonline solid-phase extraction, separated from\nother urine components by reversed-phase\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography,\nand detected by atmospheric pressure chemi-\ncal ionization\u00adtandem mass spectrometry.\nThe limit of detection (LOD)--calculated as\n, where S0\nis the standard deviation as the\nconcentration approaches zero (Taylor\ntial contamination with triclosan during the\nlaboratory operations, we avoided the use of\ntriclosan-containing soaps and detergents. In\naddition, low-concentration (~ 40 \u00b5g/L) and\nhigh-concentration (~ 230 \u00b5g/L) quality con-\ntrol materials, prepared with pooled human\nurine, and reagent blanks (to monitor and\ncontrol for the potential contamination aris-\ning from the reagents and apparatus used)\nwere analyzed with analytical standards and\nNHANES samples.\nWe performed statistical analyses using\nSAS (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary,\nNC) and SUDAAN (version 9.0.1; RTI\nInternational, Research Triangle Park, NC).\nSUDAAN incorporates sample weights and\ndesign variables to account for the complex\nsample design of NHANES. We calculated the\npercentage of detection, the geometric mean,\nand distribution percentiles for both the vol-\nume-based (in micrograms per liter) and creati-\nnine-corrected (in micrograms per gram\ncreatinine) concentrations. For concentrations\nbelow the LOD, as recommended for the\nused a value equal to the LOD divided by the\nWe used analysis of covariance to examine\nthe influence of several variables, selected on\nthe basis of statistical, demographic, and bio-\nlogic considerations, on the concentrations of\ntriclosan. For the multiple regression models,\nwe used the variables described below and all\npossible two-way interactions to calculate the\nadjusted least square geometric mean (LSGM)\nconcentrations (in micrograms per liter),\nwhich provide geometric mean estimates for a\nvariable after adjustment for the model covari-\nates. Because the distribution of the triclosan\nconcentrations was skewed, triclosan concen-\ntrations were log-transformed. A variable\nbased on self-reported data defined three\nmajor racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic\nblack, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican\nAmerican. Self-reported annual household\nincome was available in $5,000 increments\nobtain comparable numbers of participants in\neach income group, we categorized income as\nThose participants who had serum cotinine\nconcentrations (the biomarker used to define\nsmoking status) > 10 \u00b5g/L were classified as\nsmokers. Creatinine concentrations were log-\ntransformed for the data analysis because of\ntheir skewed distribution. Age was reported in\nyears at the previous birthday. Because body\nmass index (BMI) is age- and sex-specific for\npeople < 19 years of age, CDC recommends\nfor children and teens the use of BMI-for-age\npercentile (BMIPCT) instead of BMI\n(Kuczmarski et al. 2002). Therefore, we con-\nducted two separate models: one for adults\n( 20 years of age) and one for children and\nteenagers (6\u00ad19 years of age). We could not\ninclude only children (6\u00ad11 years of age) in\nthe model because of the small sample size for\nsome strata. We considered age (continuous),\nsex, race/ethnicity, creatinine concentration\n(Barr et al. 2005), and income for both mod-\nels. Additionally, for the adult model, we\nincluded smoking status and BMI, and for the\nCalafat et al.\nTable 1.

When both age and age-squared\nwere in the model, to avoid multicollinearity\nwe centered age by subtracting the mean age\nfrom each participant's age (Bradley and\nSrivastava 1979). To evaluate the relation\nbetween the log-transformed concentration of\ntriclosan and age, we estimated the weighted\ngeometric mean and LSGM concentrations\nafter adjusting by the other covariates in the\nmodel, and we generated a bar chart of tri-\nclosan concentrations by age group.\nTo reach the final model, we used back-\nward elimination, with a threshold of\np < 0.05 for retaining the variable in the\nmodel, using Satterwaite-adjusted F statistics.\nWe evaluated for potential confounding by\nadding each of the excluded variables back\ninto the final model one by one and examin-\ning changes in the  coefficients of the statis-\ntically significant main effects. If addition of\none of these excluded variables caused a\nchange in a  coefficient by  10%, the vari-\nable was re-added to the model.\nResults\nFree plus conjugated species of triclosan (total\nconcentrations ranging from above 2.3 \u00b5g/L\ngeometric mean and 95th percentile concen-\nrespectively (Table 1).\nThe children and adolescents model\nincome, log-transformed creatinine, race/\nethnicity, and interaction terms between race/\nethnicity and income (p = 0.04) and log-\ntransformed creatinine and income (p =\n0.02).

Triclosan concentrations decreased as\nage increased ( coefficient = \u00ad0.004) and\nincreased as creatinine (log-transformed)\nincreased ( coefficient = 0.58).\nBecause BMI or BMIPCT and smoking\nstatus were not significantly associated with\nthe triclosan concentration in the models\nabove, we combined the two models for all\nages without including these variables.

In\nhumans, triclosan can be absorbed through\nmucosa in the mouth and intestinal tract (Lin\ndetection of triclosan in blood (Hovander et al.\n(Sandborgh-Englund et al. 2006; Wolff et al.\n2006) collected from small groups of persons\nin the United States and Sweden suggests that\nthe general population is exposed to triclosan.\nThe range of urinary concentrations of tri-\nwas wide, with 25% of persons examined hav-\ning concentrations < 2.3 \u00b5g/L, and 5% of the\nparticipants having concentrations > 363.8 \u00b5g/g\ncreatinine (Table 1). A wide distribution of\nconcentrations of triclosan has also been\nreported for 10 healthy Swedish volunteers, five\nof whom related using personal-hygiene prod-\nucts that contained triclosan (Sandborgh-\nEnglund et al. 2006). In the Swedish study, the\nbaseline urinary excretion of triclosan (deter-\n\u00b5g/day among people not using triclosan-con-\nusers of triclosan-containing products. In\nanother Swedish study involving a group of 36\nnursing women, triclosan concentrations were\nhigher in both plasma and milk among the\nwomen who used personal care products con-\ntaining triclosan than in the women who did\nnot (Allmyr et al. 2006). These data suggest\nthat personal care products may be a principal\nsource of exposure to triclosan in humans. The\nwide range of concentrations of triclosan may\nbe attributable to differences in exposure, as\nwell as to individual variations in distribution\nkinetics and metabolism (Sandborgh-Englund\nData are limited on the urinary concen-\ntrations of triclosan in human populations. In\na pilot study, triclosan was detected in 67.8%\nyears, from New York City, New York;\nCincinnati, Ohio; and Northern California\n(Wolff et al. 2007). The median concentra-\ntion (5.9 \u00b5g/L) was comparable to the median\nconcentration of triclosan for the 341 chil-\ndren 6\u00ad11 years of age in this NHANES\nAs is true for other nonpersistent chemi-\nwithin-person variability in urinary concen-\ntrations of triclosan exists. Despite this vari-\nability, results from one recent study suggest\nthat triclosan concentrations in a single urine\nsample can be used to categorize the 6-month\naverage exposure to triclosan among a group\nimportant, concentrations based on one spot\nsample per person can be useful in calculating\nmean population concentration estimates in\ncross-sectional studies such as NHANES.\nWe observed a curvilinear-increased rela-\ntion between age and triclosan LSGM concen-\ntration for people  6 years of age. For people\n 20 years of age, concentrations appeared to\ndecline as age increases (Figure 1 and Table 2).\nThese data suggest that the concentrations of\nurinary species of triclosan peak around the\nthird decade of life and then slowly decrease.\nThis relation between age and triclosan con-\ncentration is not clearly understood, and these\ndifferences might reflect differences in lifestyle\nchoices affecting exposure and/or pharmaco-\nkinetic factors based on age.\nWe did not observe differences in the\nadjusted LSGM concentrations of triclosan\nbased on race/ethnicity or sex. LSGM tri-\nclosan concentrations were significantly\nhigher among people in the high household\nincome category than among people in the\nincome categories. These differences might\nreflect differences in lifestyle choices (e.g., use\nof personal care products) that affect exposure\nto triclosan.\ntriclosan data can be used to establish a nation-\nally representative baseline assessment of\nexposure, a baseline to which the triclosan con-\ncentrations in future populations can be com-\npared to identify exposure trends. The reported\nhigh frequency of detection of triclosan and\nthe differences in urinary concentrations based\non age and socioeconomic status highlight the\nimportance of additional research to identify\nthe sources and potential routes of human\nexposure to triclosan. In addition, these data\nprovide exposure information that can be\nuseful for risk assessment if toxicologic or\nepidemiologic studies so indicate.\nREFERENCES\nAdolfsson-Erici M, Pettersson M, Parkkonen J, Sturve J. 2002.\nTriclosan, a commonly used bactericide found in human\nmilk and in the aquatic environment in Sweden.\nAiello AE, Larson EL, Levy SB. 2007.
