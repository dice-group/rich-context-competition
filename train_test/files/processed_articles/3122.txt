Four analytic groups for drug use were defined: Statin users; AI/Antibiotic users\n(use of either anti-inflammatory or antibiotic drugs); Combination group (use of both Statins and\nanti-inflammatory or antibiotic drugs), and a Non-use group (taking none of the listed drugs).

The survey was\ndesigned to assess the health and nutritional status of\nthe non-institutionalized U.S. population by a health-\nrelated household questionnaire, medical examina-\ntions, physiological measurements and laboratory\n(blood) tests. More detailed information on the\nNHANES is available elsewhere16).\n(67.8%) were interviewed and examined. After exclud-\ning pregnant women (n 10) and missing values on\nnon-response items regarding the use of prescription\nand over-the-counter medication (n 7), 9,128 adults\nwere included in the analysis. For participants age 40\nand over, data on WBC counts were available for 8,735\nrespectively. Only four years of NHANES data for\nAmong those available individuals WBC 3.0 (SI)\nwere excluded from the analysis because they most\nlikely reflected the effects of acute, rather than chronic\ninflammation.\nAge, gender and race/ethnicity were included as\ndemographic variables. Blood samples were obtained\nby health technologists during the MEC examination\nand tested for WBC, serum CRP, ferritin levels and\ncholesterol levels. Information on laboratory test\nmethods are available elsewhere16). WBC counts are\nreported in SI units; CRP as mg/dL; and ferritin as\nng/mL. Self-reported diagnosed diabetes mellitus, cig-\narette smoking (defined as having smoked at least 100\ncigarettes during one's lifetime and currently smoking\nevery day or some days), BMI and hypertension (sys-\ntolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or a diastolic pres-\nsure 90 mm Hg or current use of anti-hypertensive\nmedications17)) were included in the multivariate\nregression model as potential confounders.\nInformation on the history of prescribed medica-\ntion use within the previous 30 days (statins, anti-\ninflammatory and antibiotics), and analgesic and pain\nreliever use within the previous 30 days (also anti-\ninflammatory drugs) was also collected. The informa-\ntion on prescribed and over-the-counter medications\nwas obtained by an affirmative answer to the follow-\ning questions: \"In the past month, have you used or\ntaken medication for which a prescription is needed?\"\nIf the response was \"yes\", verification by the trained\ninterviewer consisted of recording the standard generic\nname of the medication and the FDA/NDC therapeu-\ntic drug class codes and Multum Lexicon Therapeutic\nclassification codes directly from the prescription con-\ntainers. The participants were also specifically asked a\nquestion about prescription and non-prescription pain\nmedication use (analgesics and pain relievers).\nFour analytic groups were defined as follows:\nStatin group (use of statins, n 640) AI/Antibiotic\ngroup (use of anti-inflammatory and/or antibiotic\ndrugs, n 3,351), Combination group (use of statins\nalong with anti-inflammatory and/or antibiotic drugs,\nn 791), and the Non-use group (taking none of the\nabove mentioned drugs, n 4,346). Other types of\nlipid-lowering drugs (n 198) were defined as the\nNon-use group.\nStatistical Analyses\nEstimated mean inflammatory marker levels\n(WBC, CRP and ferritin) and the percent in each\nmedication use group (Statins, AI/Antibiotics, Com-\nbination, and Non-use) together with their standard\nerrors are presented. Sample weights which account\nfor the unequal probability of selection and adjust for\nnon-response and non-coverage are incorporated in\nthe estimation procedure. The means of the inflam-\nmatory markers and the group percent of medication\nuse categories were age-adjusted by the direct method\nto the projected year 2000 US Census population\nolder18). The standard errors were estimated using Tay-\nlor Series Linearization, a design-based approach. Sta-\ntistical hypotheses were tested univariately at 0.05\nlevel using Student's t test. The Bonferroni method\nwas applied to adjust for multiple comparisons by\ndividing the overall  level by the number of compari-\nsons being made. To control for potential confound-\ners, 3 separate multivariate regression analyses, one for\neach of the 3 inflammatory makers (WBC, CRP, and\nFerritin) as the dependent variable were conducted.\nThe models included the covariates age, gender, race/\nethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, use of\nStatins, anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics.\nAdditionally, Ferritin level in the multivariable regres-\nsion modeling was analyzed separately for men and\nwomen due to known gender differences in normal\nng/mL)19). The statistical programs SAS version 9.1\nand SUDAAN were used.\nResults\nTable 1 presents descriptive data for age-adjusted\nand age-specific mean levels of the three inflammatory\nmarkers and also descriptive data for each of the three\nmedication usage groups.

The estimated coefficient for CRP also\nshowed lower mean CRP levels in men than in women\n(p0.01) and higher mean CRP in diabetics than in\nnon-diabetics (p0.05) (data not shown). In the CRP\nanalysis, significant interactions were observed\nbetween BMI and age, BMI and hypertension, and\nsmoking and race/ethnicity.\nIn multiple linear regression modeling, there was\nno significant difference in ferritin levels between the\nStatin use group or either of the other two medication\nuse groups when compared to the Non-use reference\ngroup. This was true in the analyses of both men and\nwomen. By gender, men with a BMI 25-29 who were\nsmokers or who were non-Hispanic blacks had higher\nferritin levels than their respective reference groups\nshown). Significantly higher serum ferritin levels were\nfound among women aged 60 years, who were non-\nHispanic blacks, smokers, had BMI 25 or had\nhypertension or diabetes than their respective refer-\ndata not shown). No significant interaction effects\nwere observed for either men or women in the ferritin\nmultivariable regression modeling.\nDiscussion\nThis study showed that statin use was associated\nwith significantly decreased WBC counts and CRP\nafter adjusting for potential confounders. This result\nsupports the hypothesis that statins reduce serum lev-\nels of both CRP and WBC14). Some of the anti-\ninflammatory effects of statins have been proposed to\nbe due to inhibition of the production of isoprenoids,\nwhich share a biosynthetic pathway with choles-\nterol20). Since these isoprenoids have effects on G-pro-\ntein, adhesion molecules, and cell proliferation, block-\ning their production could have a profound effect on\nthese inflammation-related functional systems21, 22). As\nan alternative theory, simply reducing the total\namount of cholesterol available for plaque formation\nmay lower the cholesterol content of atherosclerotic\nplaques, leading to smaller and fewer plaques, there-\nfore providing a net decreased physical basis for\ninflammation to occur. If the alternative theory is\ntrue, other lipid-lowering drugs might have an anti-\ninflammatory effect as well as statins. Unfortunately,\nthe present analysis did not have a sufficient sample\nsize for non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs to test\nwhether there is any anti-inflammatory effect with\nother lipid-lowering agents, such as gemfibrozil, cho-\nlesterol absorption inhibitors or fibric acid derivatives.\nAlthough it is not possible to assess the long-\nterm outcomes of statin treatment from this analysis,\na number of previous studies have shown a relation-\nship between statin treatment and risk reduction in\ncoronary heart disease via reducing CRP levels14, 23).\nBoth experimental studies and clinical trials have dem-\nonstrated that the magnitude of risk reduction in cor-\nonary events attributable to statins is substantially\ngreater among those with evidence of inflammation\nthan in those without any inflammation, as measured\nby CRP levels23-25). A similar result was reported in the\nCholesterol and Recurrent Events study which dem-\nonstrated that the greatest benefit of Statin treatment\n(Pravastatin 40 mg/day) was achieved in the group\nwith the highest baseline CRP (a 54% reduction in\ncardiovascular events compared with 25% in the low-\nest quartile for CRP)24). It appears that Pravastatin,\nin addition to having a beneficial effect on the lipid\nprofile, reduces CRP in these patients and has its\ngreatest benefit in patients with the highest CRP lev-\nels. These results may imply that inflammation and\ntotal cholesterol levels are equally important in athero-\nHeart Association and the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (2003) advised doctors to consider\ntesting Americans at moderate risk of heart disease for\nsigns of inflammation in the bloodstream29).\nFerritin has been identified as an acute phase\ninflammatory marker that, together with CRP and\nWBC, accelerates the oxidation of LDL, and induces\ninflammation in the blood vessels5, 30). In the present\nanalysis there was no significant difference in ferritin\nlevels between the Statin use group and Non-use\ngroup. In the older age group (60 years and older) and\nin those with high blood pressure, our analysis showed\na lower predicted Ferritin level among men. Women\nin the 60 year age group with high blood pressure had\nhigher predicted ferritin levels. This could in part be\nexplained as an artifact of the differences in baseline\nferritin levels by age in men and women. In the litera-\nture, there is a relative lack of published data concern-\ning ferritin levels in different age and gender groups;\nhowever, our data showed a modest negative associa-\ntion between age as a continuous variable and ferritin\nlevels among men, but a modest positive association\nbetween age and ferritin levels amongst women (data\nnot presented). This difference might have been\ncaused by changes brought on by onset of menopause.\nAlso, the relationship between high blood pressure\nand ferritin may be complicated by the age distribu-\ntion and the prevalence of high blood pressure in both\nmen and women31). Over 65% of the population aged\n60 years and older has high blood pressure31). As\nexpected, the predicted mean ferritin levels among\nsmokers and diabetics were significantly higher than\ntheir counterparts. These results are consistent with\nprior studies, supporting the reported positive rela-\ntionship between inflammatory markers and diabetes\nand cigarette smoking32, 33). At present, no studies have\nrevealed any relationship between the medications\nused to control high blood pressure or diabetes and\nserum ferritin levels.\nLimitations of our analysis include the fact that\nthe NHANES survey is a cross-sectional study, and\nthe statistical associations noted here may not be sup-\nported by prospective or longitudinal studies. Also,\nour self-reported history of medication does not\naccount for differences between statin sub-types, the\ndose, schedule or duration of statin treatment, or with\ncompliance or differences in the relative efficacy of\nlipid lowering among the various statins. Low-density\nlipoprotein was not included in our analysis since the\npurpose of the study was to assess the relationship\nbetween statins and inflammatory markers rather than\nlowering the lipid level, per se.\nIn this study, we were also careful to include a\nseparate category representing the effects of the major\ndrug classes known to have anti-inflammatory effects,\nso as to control for their possible effects in the analy-\nsis. There were, however, limitations on our ability to\naddress this important issue. For example, no data\nwere available on the details of the nature and activity\nof the underlying disease being treated in this sub-\ngroup, to inform the overall analysis. Also, we looked\nat the potential effects of other prescription drugs on\nserum inflammatory marker levels. We performed a\nsensitivity analysis of the potential effects of other\n(non-statin) types of lipid-lowering drugs (n 198;\ndata not shown); however, because this analysis did\nnot show any effects, the relatively small number of\npersons taking non-statin lipid lowering drugs was\nadded to the Non-use reference group due to insuffi-\ncient sample size. It would, however, be useful in the\nfuture to study the comparative anti-inflammatory\neffects of statins and other types of lipid-lowering drugs\nwhen possible. Finally, there is a theoretic possibility\nthat other prescription drugs could also be associated\nwith lower CRP, WBC or ferretin levels, but we had no\na priori reason to believe that was actually the case.\nIn summary, the use of statins was significantly\nassociated with decreased WBC and CRP, however,\nmean ferritin was not significantly decreased. This\nanalysis supports the hypothesis that statins have anti-\ninflammatory effects which may possibly help to mod-\nerate the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n"
