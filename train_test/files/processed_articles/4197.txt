    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhen using instruments written originally in a different language, the accuracy of translation is a crucial issue. The language and\ncultural interpretations can be barriers to healthcare access. Despite the need for a robust translation process, the existing\nliterature offers little information about best practices for translation. Therefore, the purpose of this qualitative research was\nto illustrate a systematic approach to developing an accurate translation. We describe the process of developing an accurate\nand culturally relevant translation of the Connor\u00adDavidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) from English to Arabic. The CD-\nRISC is a healthcare instrument to measure resilience and comprises 25 items rated on a 5-point scale, with higher scores\nreflecting increased resilience. Resilience is an important healthcare construct that can be applied to research on mental\nillness and adaptation ability. For instance, increased resilience appears to protect against diminished mental health. The\ntranslation process began as two individuals independently translated the CD-RISC into Arabic. A third person combined\nthe two translations to produce a reconciled version. A fourth individual then back-translated the reconciled Arabic version\nto English. To resolve difficult-to-translate segments, the research team consulted with the instrument developer and then\nconducted cognitive testing with six individuals. A cultural research methodologist participated throughout the process.\nAmong the 28 text segments in the CD-RISC (the title, instructions, scoring, and 25 items), the best equivalency in Arabic\ncame from eight segments of each forward-translation. The remaining 12 segments were similar. Each the back-translation\nand cognitive testing contributed to seven revisions. The robust translation procedures detailed can be used by researchers\nto develop best-quality translations.\n",

When conducting\nresearch in languages besides English, researchers often turn\nto existing instruments for efficiency. It is potentially less\nresource intensive to adapt an existing instrument with reli-\nability and validity evidence than to develop an entirely new\none. Researchers who make the decision to translate an exist-\ning instrument should consult carefully with cultural-content\nexperts regarding appropriateness of making such a decision,\nand consider whether there are any compelling reasons for\nexpanding or creating a new instrument. Once an informed\ndecision has been made about the appropriateness of using\nan existing instrument written originally in a different\nA systematic approach for accurate\ntranslation of instruments: Experience\nwith translating the Connor\u00adDavidson\nResilience Scale into Arabic\nGhazwan Toma1, Timoty C Guetterman1, Tareq Yaqub2,\nNizar Talaat3 and Michael D Fetters1\n Keywords\nAcculturation, Arabic, health communication, refugees, resilience, translation\n1University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\n2Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA\n3Beaumont Hospital, Dearborn, Dearborn, MI, USA\nCorresponding author:\nGhazwan Toma, University of Michigan, 1018 Fuller Street, Ann Arbor, MI\nEmail: gtoma@umich.edu\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\nlanguage, the most critical issue is ensuring the accuracy of\ntranslation. Although a number of techniques have been\ndescribed in the use of cross-cultural surveys, the quality of\nmany translations and methodological approaches is open to\ncriticism (Garcia-Castillo and Fetters, 2007; Maneesriwongul\nand Dixon, 2004). For example, errors arise from differences\nbetween cultures in the particular phenomenon being\nassessed by the instrument, different versions (e.g. dialects)\nof the target language that lead to misunderstanding among\nrespondents, and the modification of words in ways that are\nno longer semantically equivalent. Methodological criti-\ncisms include unclear procedures for translations and the\nlack of appropriate testing of the translated instrument\nResearchers have several available approaches for devel-\noping translations: forward-translation, back-translation, and\ncognitive testing. In forward-translation, one or more lan-\nguage experts translate an instrument to the target language.\nWith back-translation, one or more language experts trans-\nlate from the target language back to the original language to\ncheck for discrepancies. Common variations of translation\ninclude single translator forward-translation and back-trans-\nlation by a second translator, and comparison of the back-\ntranslation with the original document; this is an approach\nthat is well adopted by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) to translate health-related instruments (WHO, 2016).\nAnother variation involves independent forward-translation\nby two translators and reconciliation without back-transla-\ntion. What remains unclear is whether there would be value\nadded by conducting independent forward-translation using\ntwo translators, followed by reconciliation, and then com-\npleting back-translation.\nCognitive testing is a process to check the understanding\nof the translated instrument by individuals representing\nintended users of the instrument. DeVellis (2012) defines\ncognitive testing as a qualitative approach for understanding\nhow potential respondents will interpret and understand\nitems. Broadly speaking, cognitive testing examines instruc-\ntions, responses, and items (Sousa and Rojjanasrirat, 2011).\nIt can uncover problems related to language, comprehension,\nand cultural relevance. Recent advances in translation proce-\ndures have called for combining all of these approaches to\nproduce a comprehensive and accurate translation (Sousa\nAlthough translation techniques have been described, less\nis known about the pitfalls that may arise and how quality\nchecks can be employed throughout the process to address\nthese problems. In this article, we illustrate a qualitatively\ndriven approach to the translation of an instrument and dem-\nonstrate how each step contributes to a best-quality transla-\ntion. We discuss the details of using this comprehensive\nprocess as applied to a specific resilience instrument, illus-\ntrate how different steps contribute to refinement of a trans-\nlation, and present procedures to overcome conflicts that\narise. We discuss the critical role of a cross-cultural research\nmethodologist and checking the intended meaning with the\noriginal author when discrepancy arises. In this example, we\nwere particularly fortunate to actively collaborate with the\noriginal instrument's author throughout the process, but rec-\nognize that such an advantage will not always be possible.\nThe impetus for this study derived from our own interest\nin research on acculturation in an Arab population of immi-\ngrants and refugees. The United States and Canada have wit-\nnessed a continuous influx of refugees from Iraq and the\ncommon group of refugees in the United States and they\nsalient because increased resilience appears to protect against\ndiminished mental health. Refugees are not only more likely\nto experience physical and mental health problems when\ncompared to the population generally (Kinzie et al., 2008;\nlanguage- and culture-related barriers in accessing health-\n2005). While effective acculturation appears to improve\naccess, diminished resilience may limit a refugee's ability to\neffectively acculturate and integrate in their new society\nresilience, therefore, may prove an effective leverage point\nin facilitating acculturation and improving one's ability to\naccess needed health/mental health services.\nWhile the definition of resilience has evolved over time,\nthe key components of resilience relate to a person's ability\nto positively adapt to a changing or unpredictable environ-\nment and maintain or regain positive mental health while\nfacing or confronting adversity (Herrman et al., 2011).\nResilience can predict an individual's adaptation ability\nMeasuring a person's resilience has important clinical utility:\nit can help identify those struggling to adapt to a new envi-\nronment and inform interventions to alleviate stress, anxiety,\nor depressive symptoms (Herman, 2012; Herrman et al.,\nFew studies have explored resilience among Arab-\nspeaking individuals in the United States (Arnetz et al., 2013;\nArabic-speaking refugees is increasing, researchers need a\nvalidated measure of resilience for the Arabic-speaking popu-\nlation. We deemed the Connor\u00adDavidson Resilience Scale\n(CD-RISC-Arabic) to be a particularly good choice as it is a\nwidely utilized instrument available in many languages\n(Connor and Davidson, 2003). The CD-RISC instrument has\nbeen tested in many populations as well as different psychiat-\nric disorders and is well applicable to Arab-speaking individ-\nuals who live in the United States (more information is\navailable at www.connordavidson-resiliencescale.com/about.\nphp). Given the widespread use across multiple linguistic and\ncultural groups, the first author (bilingual investigator) and\nToma et al. 3\nsenior author (culture research methodologist) along with the\ninstrument developer reached the conclusion that developing\na resilience instrument de novo was not needed.An additional\nadvantage of focusing on the CD-RISC would be an ability to\ncompare our own results to the findings of researchers work-\ning with refugees who use other languages such as comparing\nresilience scores of different populations and illnesses.\nCognizant of the lack of a detailed literature illustrating\ntranslation procedures and detailed examples of the kinds of\nchallenges that emerge, we endeavored to fully document\nmethodologically our state-of-the-art procedure for transla-\ntion while developing the CD-RISC-Arabic. The purpose of\nthis research is to demonstrate the qualitatively driven\napproach for developing an accurate translation using the\nexample of our development of an Arabic version of the\nCD-RISC resilience instrument. We clearly discuss the details\nof this process using matrices with actual Arabic translations\nand their English equivalents to illustrate what kinds of chal-\nlenges can arise and a culturally informed approach for over-\ncoming these challenges.\nMethods\nDesign\nAll translators are healthcare professionals who were born in\nArab-speaking countries. They live and work in the United\nStates at the time of translation was underway. After obtain-\ning the translation approval from the author, we used double,\nindependent forward-translation, reconciliation, and then\nindependent back-translation and reconciliation followed by\ncognitive testing to develop a novel Arabic translation of the\nCD-RISC. Two bilingual people, \"forward translators 1\n(director of community mental health center originally from\nSyria) and 2 (an internist original from Sudan),\" indepen-\ndently forward translated the 28 segments of the CD-RISC\ninstrument into Arabic (title, instructions, scoring, and 25\nitems). A third bilingual person who is a family and geriatric\nphysician in the United States originally from Iraq (G.T., the\nfirst author and the \"bilingual investigator\") combined the\ntwo forward-translations to produce a reconciled version. He\nalso recorded the challenges and solutions that were dis-\ncussed with culture research methodologist (M.D.F., senior\nauthor). Then a fourth bilingual person, the \"back translator\"\nwho was a medical student in the US at the time of transla-\ntion and originally from Palestine, back-translated the recon-\nciledArabic into English. The culture research methodologist\nwho is also a physician with wide experience in methodol-\nogy and linguistics and bilingual investigator then compared\nthe original English and the back-translated English, and\nrecorded any concerns with the back-translation. Together,\nthe research methodologist and bilingual investigator exam-\nined and resolved the identified differences. This project was\nreviewed by the University of Michigan Human Subject\nReview Committee and approved as exempt research.\nSetting.The project team was based at the University of\nMichigan in the midwestern United States. We collaborated\nwith Dr Jonathan Davidson who developed the CD-RISC\ninstrument for content-related questions, and Dr Hammad\nfrom a community agency partner (ACCESS--Arab Com-\nmunity Center for Economic and Social Services) to develop\nthis translation. This research was conducted to support a\nparent project on acculturation of Arabic refugees. The trans-\nlation process started in June 2013 and was completed in\nInstrument being translated. The CD-RISC is a tool compris-\ning 25 items rated on a 5-point scale (0\u00ad4), with higher scores\nreflecting increased resilience. It has existing evidence of\nreliability (coefficient =.89) and validity of scores (Connor\nand Davidson, 2003). An exploratory factor analysis showed\nthat the CD-RISC has five distinct factors: personal compe-\ntence, high standards, and tenacity; trust in one's instincts,\ntolerance of negative affect, and strengthening effects of\nstress; the positive acceptance of change and secure relation-\nships; control; and spiritual influences (Connor and David-\nData collection and analysis of translation procedures.The\nbilingual investigator kept meticulous records of all for-\nward-translation, reconciliation, and back-translation proce-\ndures using tables to compare and analyze each of the 28\nsegments. The bilingual investigator was in close contact\nwith forward and backward translators to clarify any ambig-\nuous issues. We recorded in tables all issues that arose, the\npoint in the process when the issues occurred, and how\nproblems were resolved. We examined patterns of the type\nof issues that arose across all segments for both the forward-\nand back-translation. Based on the similarities of solutions\nof translation dilemmas (e.g. different word choice, making\nit easy to understand, adding a word, and so on), these find-\nings were incorporated into Table 1 for forward-translation\nprocedures and Table 2 for back-translation procedures.\nRoles of investigators were clearly defined in the process.\nThe bilingual investigator identified the concerns in the for-\nward-translation. In addition, the culture research method-\nologist guided the process on how to resolve the issues\nidentified. Table 1 categorizes the issues and solution types\n(see Table 1). The cultural research methodologist played a\nsimilar crucial role in organizing the data as represented in\ncolumns in the Table 2.

The out-\ncome of this discussion was a reconciled, semi-final Arabic\ntranslation edited by the bilingual investigator. As a final\nstep, the back translator developed English for the disputed\nitems from the semi-final Arabic translation. These specific\nstatements were then compared and approved by the investi-\ngators for equivalence. That semi-final Arabic Instrument\nwas then subjected to cognitive testing.\nCognitive testing and analysis. We conducted cognitive testing\nwith six adults who were native Arabic-speaking individuals\nto ensure the final version was understood by them as intended\n(DeVellis, 2012). Their participation was voluntary and only\nverbal consent was obtained. The participants in cognitive\ntesting, a combination of staff and clients, were randomly\nselected from a community agency partner (ACCESS), which\nhas diverse Arabic-speaking clients. Participants' gender was\nevenly distributed and included different levels of education.\nCognitive testing entailed the bilingual investigator adminis-\ntering the instrument individually to each participant. With\neach segment, the researcher paused and checked for under-\nstanding and whether any concerns arose. The cognitive test-\ning process involved an iterative analysis of each item to\ncheck for understanding. If participants did not seem to inter-\npret the item the same way, the difference indicated a need to\nclarify. If a participant did not understand, the researcher\nrephrased the item and recorded the item for further analy-\nsis--this only happened with the introduction.

Then, we\nused this table as tool for checking translation accuracy (final\nforward-translation).

There were\nnine occurrences when a more natural expression was needed.\nThe solutions included the flow of the phrasing, and making\nthe language more colloquial. There were eight occurrences\nwhere the final wording was nearly identical, but some inte-\ngration was needed for the final phrasing. There were four\noccurrences where a better literal match to the original\nEnglish was chosen. There were four occurrences when there\nwas a problem with the accuracy of a translated word (i.e. the\nword choice). There were two occurrences (items 7 and 11)\nwhere there were two necessary solutions (expanded wording\nand need of more natural phrasing).\nIndependent back-translation and reconciliation\nTable 2 explains the back-translation as well as the reconcili-\nation with the culture research methodologist and instrument\ndeveloper.

Based on\nfeedback with each of six individuals about each of the 28\nsegments, the final translation ended with seven revisions.\nThe introduction and five items were slightly modified to\nmake them easier to understand. There were two changes in\nthe introduction, one grammatical and one that involved\nword choice. A word was added to three items (items 2, 7,\nand 20) to clarify them further. There was one word choice\nchange (item 18) and one typographical correction (item 10).\nDiscussion\nDeveloping a very accurate translation of a tool is both a cum-\nbersome process and challenging undertaking, yet explaining\nthe process and the transparency of the work produced is\n8 Methodological Innovations\ncrucial in order to produce a state-of-the art translation. This\nresearch illustrates the value added by conducting independ-\nent forward-translation using two translators, followed by\nreconciliation, and then back-translation. There were notable\ndifferences in the independent forward-translations. Clearly,\nthe back-translation was valuable. The fact that semantic\nequivalence was not achieved after forward-translation fur-\nther highlighted the importance of including a cultural expert\nand conducting the independent back-translation. The cogni-\ntive testing then further refined the instrument through testing\nwith participants representing the target audience.\nAmong the challenges the research team encountered\nwere developing a clear understanding of the intent of each\nitem in the original English version and summarizing the\nresolution types by the investigators. In contrast to this\nexample, most authors who produce a second-language ver-\nsion do not provide sufficient information to understand\ntranslation procedures. We believe this may be due to several\nreasons. First, researchers do not really have many venues\nfor making public details of their translations. Moreover,\nmaking public the details could be seen as creating vulnera-\nbility for the accuracy of the translation. Second, lead\nresearchers on projects, especially researchers who are\nmonolingual, may not understand the complexity of transla-\ntion and may want simply a quick fix. There may be a na\u00efve\nunderstanding that there are natural equivalencies of con-\nstructs across languages.\nThis research thus raises questions about accuracy of\nmany translated instruments that have used less intense\ntranslation procedures and the extent cultural context was\nconsidered and accounted for by the translators. Challenges\nare likely to arise when conducting any translation. Based on\nthis research, there are now clear illustrations of procedures\nfor addressing problems that arise during translation and\nback-translation and how each problem can be solved.\nA unique contribution of this discussion of translation\nprocedures is the role of a team regularly communicating\nthroughout the translation process. The periodic meetings\nprovided a format to address each challenge, and a team\napproach to translation proved particularly useful by provid-\ning multiple perspectives to resolve discrepancies. By includ-\ning three individuals who conducted forward and backward\ntranslation, each with a different Arabic dialect (Syrian,\nSudanese, and Palestinian) in addition to the bilingual inves-\ntigator (Iraqi), we were able to identify problematic items\nand ensure broader applicability to anArabic-speaking popu-\nlation. As there are many Arabic dialects, they all share com-\nmon official \"broadcast\" Arabic language. Therefore, having\nextensive representation on the team from multiple nationali-\nties may be particularly important, especially if the intent is\nto use the instrument with Arabic speakers of multiple\nbackgrounds.\nWorking with the original instrument developer ensured\nthe translation did not change the intended meaning of items.\nAs illustrated here, the original developer can assist with\nword choice when the meaning of a particular item is in\nquestion because the original developer is most familiar with\nthe construct being measured. Cognitive testing with the tar-\nget audience can provide a rigorous qualitative method to\ndiscuss each item and talk about understanding. Although it\nyielded a relatively small number of corrections, the research\nteam strongly recommends cognitive testing as a final check\nof translation accuracy and fluency. Finally, this research\nexplored the critical added value of review by a methodolo-\ngist specializing in cultural research.\nIn our experience, most original instrument developers\nappreciate other researchers developing their instrument into\nother languages in order to extend the \"reach\" to other popu-\nlations. Original instrument developers are most receptive\nwhen the proposal includes details on using a best-quality\napproach. This translation has been designated as the stand-\nard Arabic language translation by the tool's copyright\nholder, Dr Jonathon Davidson.\nThis research illustrates that investigators face significant\ncosts when producing high-quality translations of instru-\nments, primarily due to human labor costs. In the research\nteam's consulting experiences with grant application devel-\nopment, candidates often short-change the process, such as\nwhen faced with tight budgets. Unfortunately, compromised\nequivalency at the translation level could compromise con-\nclusions drawn from comparison of results across groups\nthat have used different language translations of an instru-\nment. We advise budgeting adequately to use best-quality\ntranslation practices.\nThe availability of the CD-RISC-Arabic instrument on\nresilience is very timely for our own research and that of\nothers. The waves of refugees from the Middle East high-\nlight the need for researchers and human services organi-\nzations to have a resilience instrument available, and its\npotential use in a variety of applications for measuring\nand monitoring adaptations to acculturation stress. The\nresearch team hopes availability of the CD-RISC-Arabic\nwill enhance the resources for researchers engaged with\nArabic-speaking refugees and other populations. This\ninstrument can also be used by clinical psychologists\nwhile assessing mental health of clients from Arab-\nspeaking countries.\nWith regard to potential study limitations, there were four\ndiverse bilingual individuals involved in this translation\n(they were from different Arab countries with different dia-\nlectics), but there were not any translators from NorthAfrican\ncountries. Using official \"broadcast\" Arabic language should\nhave adjusted for this issue. The cognitive testing was con-\nducted with six individuals. While no new issues were being\nidentified, we may have made minor changes if we had tested\nthe instrument on a larger number of subjects. Feedback\nfrom those six subjects was constructive even though it\ninvolved mostly minor changes.\nToma et al. 9\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this research illustrates detailed procedures for\ndeveloping a high-quality and accurate translation. Given the\nchanges that were incorporated based on having independent\nforward-translations, back\u00adtranslation, and cognitive testing,\nwe recommend this as a value-added endeavor meritorious of\npursuing and funding when conducting research requiring\nadaptation of an instrument into a second language. In addi-\ntion, engaging a cultural research methodologist overseeing\nthe process and conducting cognitive testing can help to\nensure that the instrument is not only accurate but also\nremains culturally relevant. Regular communication of the\nteam is critical throughout the process. A natural extension of\nthis research is to conduct a validation study of the CD-RISC-\nArabic. Moreover, future methodological research should\ncontinue to develop the systematic procedures to ensure a cul-\nturally relevant and accurate translation. We anticipate\nincreased need for these procedures because of continued\nglobal immigration, the increase in research conducted in\ndeveloping nations that do not yet have instruments available,\nand the growing awareness of problems with simple forward-\nor backward-translation procedures. The robust translation\nprocedures detailed here could be used by researchers in a\nvariety of fields to develop best-quality translations.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAlmedom AM (2008) Resilience research and policy/practice dis-\ncourse in health, social, behavioral, and environmental sciences\nover the last ten years.
