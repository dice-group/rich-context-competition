The original model was\nvalidated by replicating the results of two large natural history\nstudies through computer simulation.7,11,12 We modified the\nfront end of the Bennett model to enter patients into the\nalgorithm at the time of acute infection, adding the assump-\ntions for resolution and progression to chronic infection that\nare described below (Fig. 1). The model uses annual cycles\nduring which patients can remain in the same state of health\n(hereafter referred to as disease states) or progress to another\ndisease state, for example from acute to chronic hepatitis. In a\nMarkov process, an individual faces a constant probability of\nmoving from one state to another within each of these annual\ncycles (see Fig. 1 and reference 11 for listing of transition\nrates). However, because the rate of progression is low for this\ndisease, most patients remain in the same disease state from\nyear-to-year. In addition, during each annual transition\nperiod patients are subject to normal, age-adjusted, all-cause\ndeath rates as described by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (National Center for Health Statistics [www.\ncdc.gov/nchswww/]). Thus, the computer model is designed\nto quantify the expected number of HCV-positive patients in\nvarious disease states across time. In this study, our particular\ninterest was in the relatively small subset that developed cir-\nrhosis and complications of liver failure because these are the\npatients who are likely to consume the most medical\nresources. Initial projections assumed no treatment of the\ncohort. Subsequent projections considered the effects of treat-\ning all or a proportion of infected cases.\nDefinitions\nAcute and chronic HCV infections were defined by the pres-\nence of either self-limited or persistent viremia. Because the\nmodel uses annual cycles, chronicity could not be determined\nuntil the year after onset of acute infection. Thus, no patient\nwith acute infection could progress within the first year. Ful-\nminant hepatitis caused by HCV infection is rare and was not\nFigure 1. Transition (disease) states within the model for the natural history of hepatitis C virus infection.

Progression of chronic hepatitis in\nthe model through the disease states of mild to more severe\nhepatitis or cirrhosis was projected mathematically and nor-\nmally would have been unrecognized clinically.11 Complica-\ntions of cirrhosis were presumed to always be clinically appar-\nent, and the definitions of these disease states are obvious. The\ntransplant disease state was defined as the proportion of\ndecompensated patients who were deemed eligible transplant\ncandidates; we assumed for the purposes of the model that this\nproportion would remain constant in future years at a level of\nthat the current limits on the capacity of the health care\nsystem to transplant this group might substantially improve in\nthe future with increased donation and more use of split grafts\nand living donors and possibly through advances in xeno-\ntransplantation or stem cell technology. Once the current\ncapacity limit for transplantation had been reached in each\nyear, further transplant-eligible patients remained in their\ncurrent disease state in the model for another year; for exam-\nple, refractory ascites or hepatic encephalopathy. Several of\nthe disease states for decompensated cirrhosis are further sub-\ndivided into early (first year) and late (after 1 year) transition\nstates. This was done to reflect the higher mortality associated\nwith the first year after onset of these complications before\nmedical therapy is provided. For example, the 1-year survival\nof patients presenting with variceal hemorrhage is 60%,\nwhereas the chance of surviving each subsequent year after\nintervention with medical, endoscopic, or surgical therapy is\n87%.15 Although not graphically displayed in Figure 1, all\npatients in the model are subject to the normal age-adjusted\nrisk of death from nonhepatic causes during each annual cycle\nof the model. Liver-related deaths derived from progression\nthrough the model are reported as liver-related or excess mor-\ntality.\nData Sources\nIncidence of acute infection. Estimates of the annual inci-\ndence of acute HCV infection from 1950 until the present\ntime were required for the model to project the prevalence of\nchronic hepatitis C and its complications over time. The\nwas based on the Sentinel County studies reported by the\nCenters for Disease Control (CDC).3,6 The CDC adjusts\nthese estimates to account for recognition of only icteric or\nsymptomatic acute infections and significant underreporting\nof new cases to public health authorities.3 The annual inci-\nunknown and, therefore, was assumed to be the same as for\n1982. Though this may overestimate infections during those\nyears, few patients infected before 1970 would survive long\nenough to significantly impact the projections for disease in\ncoming decades. For years after 1993, we used the CDC\nassumed that the number of acute infections fell to 25,000 in\n1996 and remained stable thereafter. Although a more recent\nour use of the lower estimate is more conservative and serves\nto underestimate disease projections.\nWe assumed that 79% of acutely infected patients devel-\noped chronic infection.17-21 Of those with chronic infection,\nwe further assumed that 72.5% would have elevated liver\ntests, whereas the remainder would have persistently normal\nimportant because patients with normal ALT levels typically\nhave only mild histologic liver injury24,25 and progress at a\nslower pace than those with abnormal test results.26 There-\nfore, the model would have overestimated disease progression\nif patients with normal ALT levels were not modeled at the\nslower rate.\nThe histologic stage of the liver disease in most infected\npatients is unknown. To estimate the histologic stage of the\nliver disease in the cohort with HCV infection, we assumed\nthat patients had no liver disease at the onset of their acute\ninfection. We then used a bootstrap method to calculate his-\ntologic progression from the time of infection through 1993\nwith the computer simulation model previously reported by\nBennett.11 Patients with persistently normal ALT levels were\nassigned a histologic lesion in the year 2000 model cycle\naccording to the proportion of histologic grade and stage\nobserved in previous studies of such patients.24,25\nPrevalence of chronic hepatitis C. The modified model was\nable to calculate an annual prevalence of chronic hepatitis C\nand to project those calculations into the future. Further-\nmore, the incidence-driven nature of the model meant that\nthe population with chronic hepatitis C could be further\ncharacterized by the duration of infection and the spectrum of\nhistologic severity.\nTo validate the ability of this incidence-based model to\nestimate prevalence, we compared our projected prevalence at\nthe end of 1993 to the prevalence of HCV infection reported\nin the 1993 Third National Health and Nutrition Evaluation\nSurvey (NHANES III).27 NHANES III based its prevalence\nestimate on confirmed anti-HCV positivity among surveyed\nindividuals and extrapolated these age-, gender-, and race-\ndependent antibody prevalence rates to the United States\npopulation at large using Bureau of the Census data.12 In this\nway, it has been estimated that 3.9 million persons were\nRNA confirmation, serum ALT level, and histologic activity\nwere not available in the original NHANES III data set, but\nreanalysis of stored serum found 74% to be HCV-RNA\u00ad\npositive by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\n(RT-PCR).1 Other studies have also reported that only about\npatients are viremic if tested for HCV-RNA by RT-PCR.28-30\nThus, an HCV infection (HCV-RNA\u00adpositive) prevalence of\nand realistic estimate based on the NHANES III database.\nTreatment Effect\nThe model projections of the prevalence of HCV-related dis-\nease and its complications described above assume that no\nFuture Complications of Hepatitis C\ntreatment would be either available or provided.

Accordingly, the total num-\nber of age-adjusted survivors with chronic hepatitis C\ndisease progressed in the surviving cohort, the number\nof cases with cirrhosis increased by more than 50% by\n2010 and then plateaued. As a result, the proportion of\nThe number of patients with hepatic decompensa-\ntion will increase dramatically over the next 30 years\nand then plateau (Table 1). However, the model shows\nthat this is mainly a function of the number of cases\nprogressing to cirrhosis, because the proportion of\npatients with cirrhosis with decompensation remains\nrelatively constant at 14% to 17%. Similarly, the num-\nber of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma increases over\nthe next 2 decades, nearly doubling before leveling off.\nThe projected number of liver-related deaths also\nAge-adjusted nonhepatic deaths would continue to\nexceed hepatic deaths until 2050, when hepatic compli-\ncations will become the main cause of death among the\ncohort.\nEffect of Treatment\nThe previously described projections of HCV-related\ndisease and its complications assume that no treatment\nwas provided. Therefore, we examined the effect of\ntreating some of the patients with chronic hepatitis C. It\nis not known what proportion of HCV-infected\npatients currently receive or could be identified to be\nconsidered for therapy or would be acceptable for treat-\nment. One survey estimated that only 30% to 40% of\ninfected patients in a Veterans Hospital population\nwould be optimal candidates.33 Given these uncertain-\nties, we modeled the effects of treating various propor-\ntions between 10% (a minimum estimate) and 70%\n(perhaps the maximum proportion of potentially treat-\nable candidates) of infected patients. Model projections\nshow that identification and treatment of patients with\nchronic hepatitis C reduces the number of cases of\ndecompensated cirrhosis in nearly direct proportion to\nthe proportion of the cohort identified and treated (Fig.\nwith compensated liver disease would decrease compli-\ncations of cirrhosis after 20 years by 5%, 24%, and\nInitial experience with interferon monotherapy\nshowed that SVR was unusual in patients with cirrhosis,\nand, therefore, many physicians chose not to treat\nthem. However, recent data with combination therapy\nsuggests that patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis respond\nnearly as well as others.31,32 Therefore, we assessed the\nlong-term effect on complications of limiting combina-\nTable 1.

Treat-\nment of all patients was the optimal strategy for reduc-\ning both decompensation and hepatic deaths (Table 2).\nHowever, because hepatic decompensation occurs only\nin patients with cirrhosis, treatment responses in\npatients with cirrhosis account for the early reduction in\ndisease complications and hepatic death (an average of\n88% of the reduction observed during the first 5 years).\nTherefore, excluding patients with cirrhosis from treat-\nment would reduce considerably the potential benefit\non disease morbidity and mortality that could be\nobserved during the first 10 years after treatment. The\nbenefits of treating patients without cirrhosis do not\naccrue until much later and do not match those gained\nfrom treating patients with cirrhosis until 11 years after\ninitial therapy. Treatment of patients with mild chronic\nhepatitis would have little impact on the incidence of\nhepatic decompensation over the next decade, but\nwould have a substantial impact thereafter, accounting\nfor only 11.0% of the reduction after 10 years, but\ndecrease after 40 years (Table 2). Treatment of patients\nwith persistently normal ALT levels would reduce dis-\nease complications very little (2.0% during the next 10\nyears; 6.7% after 40 years). Treatment of patients with\npersistently normal ALT levels would decrease the\nnumber of patients with cirrhosis by only 2.1% after 20\nyears compared with no treatment.\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe assumptions made to estimate disease prevalence\nand progression in the model were intentionally biased\nto underestimate projections of future disease and com-\nplications.11 However, the assumptions are based on\nrates reported in the medical literature, and these rates\noften can vary considerably, thereby leading to some\nuncertainty in model estimates. The previously pub-\nlished version of this model noted sensitivity to treat-\nment response rates such that a decrease in the response\nrate would result in a proportional decrease in long-\nterm benefit.11 This remains important in the current\nmodel because the projections use treatment response\nrates from published clinical trials, which may differ\nfrom response rates observed when the therapy is widely\napplied in the community. A sensitivity analysis of the\nmodifications made to the previously described model\nwas conducted to test the robustness of the model and\nits projections (Table 3). The major factor affecting the\nprojection of hepatic decompensation in the cohort is\nthe all-cause (nonhepatic) mortality rate. A higher non-\nhepatic mortality rate among the cohort could signifi-\ncantly reduce the number of projected cases of cirrhosis\nand liver failure.\nDiscussion\nUsing data derived from annual incidence rates, our\nmodel estimated that there were approximately 3.07\nmillion people infected with HCV in the United States\nFigure 2.

Data shown at decade intervals.\nFuture Complications of Hepatitis C\nin 1994, a figure similar to the estimate of the\nNHANES III survey.1,6 Mathematical modeling esti-\nmates that the total number of HCV infected cases will\ndecrease gradually in coming years as the incidence of\nnew infection falls and currently infected patients die\nfrom nonhepatic, age-related causes. However, the\nlarge pool of surviving patients remains at risk of pro-\ngressive liver disease as the duration of their infection\nincreases. Indeed, the model predicts that an expanding\nproportion of the patients with chronic hepatitis C will\ndevelop cirrhosis over the next 2 to 3 decades, doubling\nthe current percentage by the year 2020. As a result,\nthere will be a dramatic increase in the number of cases\nwith complications of liver failure, hepatocellular carci-\nnoma, and death caused by liver disease. In fact, these\nchanges may already be occurring. Although our model\ndid not show a significant increase in disease complica-\ntions in the last decade of the twentieth century, others\nhave reported an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma\nand liver failure in patients with chronic hepatitis C.8,34\nInterferon-based treatment regimens with the com-\nbination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin result in\nsustained loss of HCV in approximately half of treated\ncases.31,32 Viral eradication is associated with reduction\nin hepatic fibrosis, and, therefore, successful treatment\nmight be expected to reduce future disease complica-\ntions.35 However, despite the impressive results in clin-\nical trials with pegylated interferons and ribavirin,\nmany patients are unaware of their infection, are not\ncandidates for treatment, are unable to complete the\ncourse of treatment, or fail to respond. Considering\nthese factors and assuming that at most perhaps half of\npatients could be identified and treated, we predict that\nthe most we could expect from aggressive treatment at\nthe optimal doses and duration of medication would be\na 24% reduction in the incidence of decompensated\ncirrhosis after 20 years. This goal is best accomplished\nby giving highest priority to treating patients with mod-\nerately severe inflammation or fibrosis. Our model did\nnot consider that patients who do not permanently\nclear virus might benefit from treatment with a reduc-\ntion in the rate of fibrosis as has been reported by some\ninvestigators.35,36 This theory remains unproven and is\ncurrently being evaluated in long-term clinical trials.\nThus, our projections might underestimate the poten-\ntial long-term benefit of treatment. Nevertheless, our\ndata show that current therapy and practice patterns\nthat identify and treat a relative minority of infected\npatients will not be sufficient to control the future com-\nplications of this infection.\nIdentification and treatment of a larger proportion\nof infected patients, education about the importance of\nabstinence from alcohol (the most important risk factor\nfor disease progression), and development of better tol-\nerated therapies may help to achieve a more meaningful\nimpact on the morbidity and mortality of this disease.\nAltough this may support recent calls for look-back\nprograms for transfusion recipients or large scale screen-\ning programs, such strategies have large up-front\ncosts.37 However, the costs of screening and treatment\nmay well be offset by reducing the later costs of treating\nthe complications of cirrhosis, which have been esti-\nmated to exceed 1 billion dollars per year.9,38 Indirect\ncosts, including productivity loss and other societal\nlosses, could reach 7 to 8 billion dollars per year.38\nSeveral studies have shown that treatment of chronic\nhepatitis C with either interferon alone or in combina-\nDespite the effectiveness of current antiviral regi-\nmens, our model clearly shows that the majority of cases\nof cirrhosis are not prevented. Thus, the complications\nof cirrhosis will continue to increase over the next 20 to\n30 years. The need for liver transplantation will con-\ntinue to far exceed the capacity of transplant centers to\nTable 3.

This clearly emphasizes the urgency in\ndeveloping and enacting measures to increase the avail-\nability of transplant services through increased organ\ndonation, use of living donors, or splitting cadaveric\nlivers. Research in xenotransplantation and stem cell\ntechnology may provide future options for these\npatients.\nObviously, projections provided by mathematical\nmodels are limited by the accuracy of the model condi-\ntions and assumptions. We used conservative assump-\ntions that were intentionally biased to underestimate\ndisease complications whenever possible. However, our\nuse of a general-population, age-adjusted, all-cause\nmortality rate may have resulted in an overestimation of\ndisease complications by as much as 22% (Table 3).\nSome evidence suggests that the nonhepatic mortality\nrate is higher in chronic hepatitis patients because of\ncomorbid conditions and risk factors for other dis-\neases.7,42 Furthermore, the model might have under-\nestimated nonvirologic benefits of treatment, if they\noccur, because only SVR rates were used. Finally, we\ndid not consider the likely availability of more effective\ntherapies or increased transplant volume in the future.\nNevertheless, the message is clear that an aggressive,\nproactive approach is needed to first identify, educate,\nand treat patients with HCV infection and, second, to\nincrease transplant resources.\n"
