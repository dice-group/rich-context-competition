    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: We compare three eligibility criteria for targeting health insurance expansions\nin working families: poverty, hourly wages, and employment in a small firm. Making\npairwise comparisons among these, we find that targeting by poverty is the most effective\nand efficient. A poverty-based method is also the most effective way to target those lacking\naccess to employer-sponsored insurance and those with low take-up of such coverage.\nWhen we examine the effectiveness of targeting by family type, we find that marital status\nand number of workers in the family make little difference once we control for the presence\nof children and for poverty level.\nOver the past several years analysts have suggested a wide range of\nincremental health insurance expansion options to cover the more than\nforty million Americans who are uninsured. These options include indi-\nvidual tax credits, public program expansions, alternative purchasing arrange-\nments, and employer subsidies. An often-neglected aspect of these programs' de-\ntails is the choice of eligibility critera. This choice is important because the uninsured\nare a heterogeneous group.1 Some uninsured persons have low wages but not low in-\ncomes. Others work in small firms but have higher wages. When an eligibility crite-\nrion is chosen, some uninsured persons will be included, and others will not.\nThere are two important gauges of the success of an eligibility criterion: (1) the\nnumber of uninsured persons who will be made eligible under this criterion, mea-\nsured as a proportion (which we refer to as target effectiveness); and (2) the propor-\nD a t a W a t c h\n\u00a92002 Project HOPE\u00adThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nDanielleFerryisaresearchassistantintheDepartmentofHealthPolicyandManagementatColumbia\nUniversity'sMailmanSchoolofPublicHealthinNewYorkCity.BowenGarrettisseniorresearchassociateatthe\nUrbanInstituteinWashington,D.C.SherryGliedisassociateprofessorandchairattheMailmanSchool.Emily\nGreenmanisearningherdoctorateinpublicpolicyandsociologyattheUniversityofMichiganPopulation\nStudiesCenter.LenNicholsisvice-presidentoftheCenterforStudyingHealthSystemChangeinWashington,D.C.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

If target efficiency is low, crowding out, or the pro-\nportion of already insured persons taking up coverage, will generally be high. A\ngood policy should seek to maximize target effectiveness and efficiency, but these\ngoals are often at odds with one another.\nThis paper compares three targeting criteria: family income measured relative\nto the federal poverty level, individual hourly wages, and employment in a small\nfirm. As other analysts have, we chose these criteria because uninsurance is con-\ncentrated among the poor and among those without access to employer coverage.\nThe latter, in turn, are largely employed in low-wage jobs and small firms. In 1999,\n63.2 percent of the nonelderly uninsured had family incomes below 200 percent of\npoverty.2 Similarly, 75.8 percent of the uninsured in working families had no access\nwere employed in firms with fewer than ten employees.4\nTargeting Criteria\nn Poverty. Proposals that target families by poverty limit eligibility to individu-\nals and families whose incomes fall below a specified percentage of the poverty level,\na measure that adjusts for family size and number of children. In 1999, for example, a\nfamily of three (one child) with income below $13,410 or a family of four (two chil-\nExamples of poverty-based programs include Medicaid and State Children's\nHealth Insurance Program (SCHIP) expansions, which raise the upper income eli-\ngibility limit for existing programs or extend eligibility to new groups. For exam-\nple, many states have expanded Medicaid to cover persons with family incomes up\nto 200 percent of poverty (some even higher). Tax-credit proposals often also use\npoverty-based eligibility criteria.5\nn Wages. Proposals that are administered through the workplace may target by\nhourly earnings, since firms know their workers' wage earnings and can easily de-\ntermine eligibility. Plans that use wage criteria generally fall into two subgroups:\nthose that encourage employers to offer insurance, and those that induce workers to\ntake up insurance that is offered. Options of the first type may provide a subsidy for\nthe firm's share of the premium or allow employers to offer coverage through a pub-\nlic program buy-in.6 Programs to improve take-up usually subsidize the employee\ncontribution to a group plan.\nn Small firms. Some proposals target workers in small firms.7 Small firms do not\nbenefit from the economies of scale in administrative costs achieved by large firms\nand are at a disadvantage in negotiating premium rates with insurance companies.\nNearly all establishments with at least 1,000 employees offered health coverage in\n1998, compared with 83.8 percent of firms employing twenty-five to ninety-nine\nworkers and 35.9 percent of firms with fewer than ten employees.8\nI n s u r a n c e E x p a n s i o n s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 4 2 4 7\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For some analyses we used a\nmatch of the 1999 February (Contingent Workers and Alternative Employment\nWe adjusted the data to reflect health insurance purchasing units and assigned\neach person a primary source of insurance.10 We calculated hourly wages (based\non earnings and on weeks and hours worked) and treated respondents with com-\nputed hourly wages below $1 as nonworkers. We limited our sample to families\nwith at least one worker and excluded Medicaid recipients and the elderly (age\nsixty-five and older), most of whom receive Medicare. Our weighted sample repre-\nsents 196 million persons in working families, 31.5 million of whom are uninsured.\nWe defined three subgroups based on eligibility criteria: poor/near-poor--in-\ncome below 200 percent of poverty; low wage--families in which at least one\nworker earned hourly wages of $6.82 or less (other workers in the family may earn\nmore); and small firm--families with at least one worker employed in an estab-\nlishment with fewer than ten employees (other workers in the family may be em-\nployed in larger firms). We present some analyses for employees only, excluding\nfamily members and the self-employed. For employees we used a different wage\ncutoff ($7.50) and firm-size cutoff (under twenty-five) to equalize population size\nwith poor/near-poor employees.\nThe number of uninsured persons covered under any eligibility criteria depends\ncritically on population size. Proposals with universal eligibility would include\neveryone and have 100 percent target effectiveness. For this reason, we chose the\nwage cutoff to make poverty/wage comparisons over similar-size populations.\nUsing these cutoffs, there are approximately equal numbers of persons (forty-four\nmillion) in poor/near-poor and low-wage families. The CPS reports firm size in in-\ntervals (for example, under 10, 10\u00ad25), so we could not exactly match the popula-\ntion- and firm-size criteria. We came the closest by specifying small firm size as\nfewer than ten workers. There are nearly four million more persons in small-firm\nfamilies than in poor/near-poor families.\nMany proposals use higher thresholds than the ones we used here, although\nproposals that have received the most attention in Congress tend to use thresh-\nolds more like ours.11 We compared our target populations to those that would be\nobtained from defining poor/near-poor, low wage, and small firm more conserva-\ntively and more liberally in Exhibit 1.12\nEvaluating Policy Options\nn Cost and coverage implications. Exhibit 2 compares the effectiveness, effi-\nciency, and crowding out associated with each targeting criterion. We report\ncrowding out under the assumption that 15 percent of the insured and 50 percent of\nthe uninsured take up insurance.13 In the top panel, the poverty-based criterion out-\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We obtain\nthe same rank ordering when we focus on employees only in the bottom panel.\nAgain, the poverty-based criterion performs the best on all counts.\nn Who is excluded? Who is included no matter what? When a choice is made\nbetween two policy options, some people are left out. Other people qualify under ei-\nther option. When there is a great amount of overlap, cost and coverage consider-\nations can take a backseat to other issues such as ease of administration or outreach.\nWe explore these possibilities here, comparing (separately) a poverty-based\ncriterion with one based on wages or firm size, and then comparing the wage-\nbased criterion to the firm-size criterion. The top panel of Exhibit 3 shows that a\ncriterion that excludes low-wage families and includes poor/near-poor families\ncovers more of the uninsured and targets more efficiently than does one that in-\ncludes low-wage families and excludes the poor/near-poor. Nine and a half million\nuninsured persons are in families that are both poor/near-poor and low wage. An\nadditional 7.8 million uninsured persons live in families that are poor/near-poor\nbut that do not include a low-wage worker. Only 2.4 million live in families with a\nlow-wage worker but are not poor/near-poor.\nEstimates of target effectiveness and target efficiency reflect these differences.\nNearly 25 percent of the uninsured live in families that are poor/near-poor but not\nlow wage. Only 7.7 percent live in families that are low wage but not poor/near-\npoor. Among all those in families that are poor/near-poor but not low wage,\none-third are uninsured.

The middle panel of Exhibit\n3 shows that poor/near-poor families are also more effective and efficient targets\nthan are small-firm families that are not poor/near-poor. There is no difference be-\ntween the effectiveness of low-wage and small-firm targets, however, as shown in\nthe bottom panel of Exhibit 3. A low-wage target is more efficient, though, be-\ncause families that include a small-firm worker have high incomes.\nn Firm offers and take-up of insurance. Proposals seek to expand employer-\nsponsored insurance by increasing offer rates or employee take-up rates. In Exhibit\n4 we examine whether poverty, wages, or firm size are the best predictors of offers\nand take-up. We defined the offer rate as the proportion of workers with a direct of-\nfer of employer coverage. Employees who do not have an offer (or who do not take up\nan offer) may nonetheless have coverage through a family member's employer. To\ncapture this dimension of coverage, we defined the access rate as the proportion of\nD a t a W a t c h\nPolicy Implications Of Selected Health Insurance Expansion Targeting Criteria, 1999\nPersons in\nworking families\nMillions of\npersons Poor/near-poor Low wage Small firm\nNumber eligiblea\nInsured\nUninsured\nTake-upb (millions)\nInsured\nUninsured\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\nTarget effectivenessc\nTarget efficiencyd\nCrowding oute\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\nEmployees only\nNumber eligible\nInsured\nUninsured\nTake-upb (millions)\nInsured\nUninsured\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\nTarget effectivenessc\nTarget efficiencyd\nCrowding oute\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\nSOURCES: For working families, March 2000 Current Population Survey.

The family employer coverage take-up rate\nis the proportion of people with access covered by employer coverage. Employer\ncoverage and health insurance rates are the proportions of individuals covered by\nemployer-sponsored insurance and by any insurance at all, respectively.\nPoor/near-poor workers have higher individual offer rates than do those earn-\ning low wages or employed in small firms. At the family level, though, these results\nare reversed. Poor/near-poor persons have less access to employer coverage, are\nless likely to take up this coverage when offered it, are less likely to be covered by\nemployer insurance at all, and, consequently, are less likely to be insured than are\nI n s u r a n c e E x p a n s i o n s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 4 2 5 1\nTarget Effectiveness And Efficiency Of Groups Included Under Different Eligibility\nNumber of uninsured\nin working families\n(millions)\nTarget effectiveness\n(percent of\nuninsured)\nTarget efficiency\n(percent who\nare uninsured)\nPoor/near-poor vs. low wage\nBoth poor/near-poor and low wage\nPoor/near-poor but not low wage\nLow wage but not poor/near-poor\nPoor/near-poor vs. small firm\nBoth poor/near-poor and small firm\nPoor/near-poor but not small firm\nSmall firm but not poor/near-poor\nLow wage vs. small firm\nBoth low wage and small firm\nLow wage but not small firm\nSmall firm but not low wage\nSOURCE: March 2000 Current Population Survey.\nOffer, Access, Coverage Take-Up, And Coverage Rates For Groups Defined Under\nGroups of\nfamilies\nOffer rate\n(workers)\nAccess rate\n(any offer\nin family)\nFamily employer\ncoverage\ntake-up rate\nEmployer\ncoverage\nrate\nHealth\ninsurance\ncoverage rate\nPoor/near-poor\nLow wage\nSmall firm\nSOURCES: February and March 1999 Current Population Survey.\nNOTE: For an explanation of coverage categories, see text.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

People in low-wage families, which fre-\nquently include a higher-wage worker (65 percent), have the greatest access to\nemployer coverage and are therefore most likely to be insured through an em-\nployer. Those in small-firm families, who generally have high incomes (78 percent\nhave incomes over 200 percent of poverty), have greater take-up of employer cov-\nerage and overall higher insurance coverage rates.\nn Targeting family types. Social policies such as Medicaid and cash welfare as-\nsistance have historically given priority to children and parents. In considering\nhealth insurance expansions, it is useful to know whether it is more effective or effi-\ncient to target some family types over others. Exhibit 5 shows the effectiveness and\nefficiency of targeting six family types. The first four types are families in which the\nprimary earner is married, by whether there are two or more workers or only one\nworker and by the presence of children. The other two groups are families in which\nthe primary earner is single, by the presence of children. We only report results for\npeople in poor/near-poor families to focus attention on the differences among family\nD a t a W a t c h\nTarget Effectiveness And Efficiency Of Health Insurance Expansion Targeting, By\nFamily Status And Income As A Percentage Of Poverty, 2000\nFamily status/\nincome level\n(as percent\nof poverty)\nNumber of\nuninsured in\nworking families\n(millions)\nTarget\neffectiveness\n(percent of\nuninsured)\nTarget\nefficiency\n(percent who\nare uninsured)\nMarried primary earner\nTwo or more workers, no children\nTwo or more workers, with children\nOne worker, no children\nOne worker, with children\nSingle primary earner\nNo children\nWith children\nSOURCE: March 2000 Current Population Survey.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Almost 12 percent of the uninsured are in poor/near-poor families with\nchildren in which there is only one married earner. About 9 percent of the unin-\nsured are in poor/near-poor families with children where the primary earner is\nsingle. Within groups with children who have similar incomes, we find that target\nefficiency is relatively unaffected by marital status and the number of workers in\nthe family. Target efficiency is, however, much higher among poor/near-poor fam-\nily types without children than among those with children. Since more than half\nof those in this group are now uninsured, and few are eligible for public programs,\nmaking this group eligible for new coverage would crowd out relatively little ex-\nisting coverage.\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that poverty is a better targeting criterion for health insur-\nance expansions than either wages or firm size. Since they target the uninsured\nmore efficiently, proposals focusing on poor/near-poor families are likely to be less\ncostly (per newly insured person). Among the poor/near-poor, differences in tar-\nget efficiency are driven mainly by the presence of children. A large fraction of the\npoor/near-poor uninsured are in childless families. Targeting (or at least not ex-\ncluding) childless families, who have historically been excluded from subsidized\nhealth insurance programs, would be relatively efficient.\nThese results raise the issue of how to weigh the pros and cons of various target-\ning strategies. A complete evaluation of policy options would consider more than\njust target effectiveness and efficiency. As mentioned above, wage-based options\nwould be relatively easy to administer since employers already carry out many of\nthe administrative functions that would be needed. Moreover, employers could in-\nform workers of their eligibility in conjunction with benefits notifications.\nPolicymakers might prefer a less effective or efficient proposal if it had administra-\ntive and outreach advantages. This is a trade-off that analysis can identify but can-\nnot resolve without explicit value judgments.\nThisresearchwassupportedbyagrantfromtheCommonwealthFund(FerryandGlied)andbytheW.K.Kellogg\nFoundation(Garrett,Greenman,andNichols).TheworkofGreenmanandNicholswasconductedwhileeachwas\nattheUrbanInstitute.RafiqHijazi(UrbanInstitute)providedexcellentprogrammingassistance.\nI n s u r a n c e E x p a n s i o n s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 4 2 5 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
