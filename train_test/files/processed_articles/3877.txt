It is the reality to fast, auto-\nmated, and inexpensive management of IT resources that\nhave combined to make information technology a compel-\nling paradigm for greater efficiency and enhanced productiv-\nity. There is an increasing perceived vision that cloud\ncomputing will make computing the fifth utility after water,\nelectricity, gas, and telephone that will provide the basic\nlevel of computing services considered essential for fulfill-\ning daily life routines (Buyya, Yeo, & Venugopal, 2008).\nCloud computing uses the Internet as its backbone to provide\nflexible on-demand and dynamically scalable computing\ninfrastructure for many applications using any of its four\ndeployment models: private, public, community, or hybrid\ncloud and its three-service delivery models: Software as a\nService (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS).\nThe cloud technology harnesses the web as the ultimate\nplatform to serve all kinds of users: individuals, businesses,\ninstitutions, the industry, and others. It provides computing\nresources on demand on a pay-per-use basis via a cloud ser-\nvice provider and is a powerful tool that can deliver sustain-\nable advantage (Shimba, 2010). To simply say that cloud\ncomputing can increase productivity is an understatement;\ncloud computing can effectively re-design the way busi-\nnesses and organizations approach and accomplish their\ntasks on daily basis, it is more of a comprehensive infrastruc-\nture that allows for increased streamlining of inter-office\nIn the academia, cloud computing is a powerful tool that\noffers great scalability and flexibility, making it possible for\nstudents, staff, faculties, administrators, and other campus\nusers access file storage, databases, and other university\napplications anywhere anytime (Jain and Pandey, 2013). The\ncloud computing technology has been termed as the \"silver\n1Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation, Kuala Lumpur,\nMalaysia\n2International Islamic University Malaysia, Gombak, Malaysia\n3University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nMueen Uddin, International Islamic University Malaysia, Gombak, Malaysia.\nCloud Computing Adoption Model for\nUniversities to Increase ICT Proficiency\nSafiya Okai1, Mueen Uddin1,2, Amad Arshad1, Raed Alsaqour3,\nand Asadullah Shah2\n Keywords\ncloud computing, cloud adoption model, cloud adoption challenges, ICT\n2 SAGE Open\nbullet\" in the field of educational technology (Mell & Grance,\n2010). Hence, some universities especially in more devel-\noped and advanced countries have adopted this technology\nfor many reasons ranging from reduced cost of hardware\nacquisition and maintenance to greater access of web 2.0\napplications for teachers and learners and ultimately better\nacademic outputs (Ercan, 2010). Through the adoption of\ncloud computing to support their virtual computing lab, the\nNorth Carolina State University, United States, saves a lot on\nsoftware licensing costs. Eastern Washington University in\nthe United States and Lakehead University in Canada have\nalso saved plenty of money by outsourcing their email ser-\nvices. Also, the University of Washington uses the cloud to\neffectively implement collaborative learning for students at\ndifferent locations and the Pennsylvania State University,\nUnited States, uses cloud computing to share resources\namong its numerous campuses and colleges (Cappos,\nBeschastnikh, Krishnamurthy, & Anderson, 2009).\nAccording to James Holt, the vice president and chief infor-\nmation officer (CIO) of the University of Virginia, United\nStates, cloud computing is the real opportunity for the aca-\ndemia to rethink and re-craft services (Thomas, 2011). The\npopularity, advancement in information and communications\ntechnology (ICT) and the use of the Internet has made com-\nputing resources more readily available, but the adoption and\nimplementation level of the cloud technology especially in\ndeveloping countries is still very low. Hence, this article\nexplores into the area of cloud computing to identify the\nchallenges and reasons for the slow rate of its adoption by\nuniversities and proffers solutions to the problems along with\na roadmap for its successful adoption.\nProblem Background\nAdvancement in technology is evolving at a very fast pace\nthat is difficult to match, this puts universities around the\nworld and those in developing countries in particular under\npressure to meet up with latest IT trends such as cloud com-\nputing in the educational sector. Cloud technology is still\nevolving, and the use of ICT in some developing countries\nlike Nigerian universities is growing at a rather slow rate,\nwhich is largely due to the cost involved in the purchase and\nmaintenance of ICT equipments and the poor power supply\nin the country (Ume, Bassey, & Ibrahim, 2012).Adopting the\ncloud computing technology will help to manage the limita-\ntions to the slow pace of ICT growth better because the cloud\ntechnology reduces the cost of delivering IT services and\ntakes away the burden of having to purchase and provide\nmaintenance to the high tech equipment needed to meet the\nIT needs of students and staff, it is essential for better service\nIn the current system in most Nigerian universities, it is\nthe responsibility of the IT department to meet the needs of\nall students as well as academic and administrative staff of\nthe university, whatever service is needed is directed to the\nIT department. The department provides and manages\nstudents and staff email accounts, handles installations, and\nupgrades on PCs in the computer labs, cafes, and staff com-\nputers. Generally, all IT needs whether minor or major of\nstudents and staff of the university are met directly by the IT\ndepartment (Ume et al., 2012). With the adoption of cloud\ncomputing, students and staff can meet their needs directly\nfrom their computers and other devices as long as they are\nconnected to the Internet. Also, having such a technology\nprovides a better way to handle disasters as it provides easy\nbackup and recovery because everything may be thousands\nof miles away and will only be provided as a service by a\ncloud service provider who's backup and recovery plans are\nway better than anything the universities can provide. Even\nthough the concept of cloud computing is getting more popu-\nlar in recent times and quite a number of research has been\ndone on its benefits to higher institutions of learning, most of\nwhich involves the opportunity to save on the huge cost\ninvolved in the purchase and maintenance if IT devices and\navailability of resources housed in the cloud whenever wher-\never, its adoption rate is still very slow due to the challenges\nencountered and issues that come with adopting it.\nChallenges of Cloud Computing and Reasons for\nLow Rate of Adoption by Universities\nDespite the huge benefits of cloud computing; concerns on\nthe security and confidentiality of data stored in the cloud,\nprivacy and regulatory compliance, vendor lock-in, location\nof the data, legal jurisdiction, and reliability of the cloud ser-\nvice provider have been identified as the barriers to cloud\nadoption in higher education by Low, Chen, and Wu (2011)\nand Mircea and Andreescu (2011), which are similar to the\nfindings of the survey carried out by researchers of Carnegie\nMellon University. The survey further revealed that for\nhigher institutions, the challenges of cloud adoption are not\njust limited to the risks listed above, but the relative newness\nand underdevelopment of cloud services is also one of major\nconcerns for cloud adoption. (Sultan, 2010). Security and\nprivacy is a major concern for cloud adopters because valu-\nable data reside outside the institutions firewalls, therefore\nany hacking or other forms of attack on the cloud vendor's\ninfrastructure will affect all clients whose data are stored on\nthe infrastructure. According to Rittinghouse and Ransome\n(2010), lack of compliance to the SLA (Service Level\nAgreements) by cloud service providers is another reason\nbehind the slow rate of adoption, because if cloud vendors do\nnot meet the requirements of the SLA and attend to down-\ntimes prompt performance will be greatly affected.\nLegal and jurisdiction issues also pose reasons for con-\ncern because legal issues can bind an institution into\nunwanted or unsatisfactory conditions, thereby, leading to\nlegal disputes that can run into years due to laws of the loca-\ntion where the data are located. Once the services of cloud\nvendors are employed, the institutions no longer have control\nover the physical infrastructure where their data are stored;\nthe average user may not be concerned with where their data\nOkai et al. 3\nare sitting, but universities hold very vital information of\nthousands of people and processes such as research results\nand findings that require high levels of confidentiality and\nprivacy (Cegielski, Jones-Farmer, Wu, & Hazen, 2012). An\nexample of an institution facing legal issues due to the adop-\ntion of Google's public cloud is the Lakehead University,\nCanada. The faculty union of the university filed a grievance\nwith the university complaining that the email system out-\nsourced to Google does not protect their privacy and aca-\ndemic freedom because Google is a U.S. company and\ntherefore subject to the American law which compels Google\nto hand data to the U.S. government if required even without\ninforming the university (Todd, 2008). Issues like this pose\nthreats to the privacy of data and hinder the interest of higher\ninstitutions of learning to migrate to the cloud. In developing\ncountries, however, the rate of adoption of the cloud technol-\nogy is still quite low; hence, universities in this part of the\nworld will mostly work with copyright laws of the chosen\ncloud vendors and that of the location where the vendors'\ninfrastructures are located; therefore, one of the yardsticks of\nchoosing vendors will be based on how favorable the copy-\nright laws are to the universities.\nProblem Statement\nQuite a number of works have been done on the benefits,\nchallenges, and adoption strategies of cloud computing;\nhowever, despite these works, the hype, and predictions on\nthe increase in the rate of adoption of the cloud technology,\nthe acceptance level is still very low. In a recent survey con-\non the actual rate of adoption and usage of cloud computing,\nthe results show that the adoption rate is not rising as expected\nwith security concerns being the most prominent reason for\nthe reluctance in the acceptance of the cloud technology. In\nview of this, this article attempts to answer the following\nresearch questions:\nResearch Question 1: How can the challenges of cloud\ncomputing be overcome to increase the acceptance level\nand rate of adoption by universities in developing\ncountries?\nResearch Question 2: What measures can be put in\nplace to ensure a safer and more reliable transition to the\ncloud?\nRelated Work\nSaidhbi in the research Cloud Computing Framework for\nEthiopian Higher Education Institutions proposed the imple-\nmentation of a central hybrid cloud computing infrastructure\nthat combines both the current local infrastructure of the uni-\nversities as the private cloud and public cloud to enable the\nsharing of educational resources and collaboration within\nall universities in Ethiopia and the global educational\ncommunity, so that Ethiopian higher institutions can enjoy\nthe benefits of ICT in an efficient and affordable way\n(Saidhbi, 2012). The research further states that by deploying\nthe proposed hybrid cloud model, the risks of privacy and\nother security challenges can be avoided as critical and sensi-\ntive data will be housed in a private cloud.\nIn a study on Cloud Computing in Higher Education in\nJordan by Massadeh and Meslah (2013) suggested that\nJordanian universities consider adopting cloud computing as\na way of meeting the growing demands of IT services and\nmanaging the tight budget due to very limited financial sup-\nport from the government. The researchers believe that\nimplementing cloud computing will be a strategy to offer\ngood business models for the Jordanian universities as they\ndo not have sufficient resources to manage the required IT\nsupport for development, educational, and research activities\nthat should be provided in an ideal higher education environ-\nment. Suryawanshi and Narkehde (2012) outlined a cloud\nimplementation strategy for migrating from the traditional IT\nsystem to the cloud for higher technical institutions. Their\nstrategy includes having a committee to supervise the imple-\nmentation activities and to develop a knowledge base by\nattending cloud computing conferences and seminars and\nalso discussing with cloud vendors.\nTout conducted a study on cloud computing adoption and\ntransitioning to the cloud by higher institutions; in the study,\nthe author outlined greater benefits of cloud computing\nbeyond the traditional advantage of cost reduction of IT\ninfrastructure and maintenance. Cloud computing adds value\nto capital expenses and services provided by universities\nand, at the same time, protects the environment through the\nlights that cloud computing is a revolution in the educational\nsector that makes it possible to migrate sensitive data either\nto private cloud by using existing resources or the educa-\ntional cloud provided and managed by a service provider.\nThe cloud technology enhances teaching, learning, quicker\nmore reliable access to information, and gives the ability to\nfocus more on strategic goals. Ercan (2010) has reviewed the\nconcept of cloud computing in his study on the Effective use\nof Cloud Computing in Educational Institutions and pro-\nposed a model to meet the needs of students and staff. In the\nproposed model, the author identifies compute resources that\ncan easily be accessed by users with any devices of their\nchoice provided on a pay per use model to meet users'\ndemands as demands scale up and down with appropriate\nsecurity that filters the contents being accessed by the users.\nBabu, Sarma, Vijaylakshmi, and Kalyankar (2012) in\ntheir research on improving the confidentiality of data stored\nin the cloud proposed the master\u00adslave paradigm that calls\nfor end-to-end encryption and decryption of data to ensure its\nintegrity from source-provider of the cloud service to the\nusers' destination to prevent privacy leakage and maintain\nthe integrity of educational data. When the decision to adopt\nthe cloud technology has been made, cloud adopters should\n4 SAGE Open\nconsider creating a campus cloud computing roadmap to\nguide the institutions' decisions on whether or not to operate\non premises or off premises and a risk assessment guide to\nguide the policy makers through the risk assessment and\nanalysis of cloud-based portfolios (Thomas, 2011).\nProposed Solution\nThe cloud technology is here to stay; despite its challenges,\nthe benefits of its adoption greatly outweigh the risks. From\nthe above discussions, it was very much obvious to develop\na model for proper adoption of cloud computing to provide a\nsafer and more enjoyable experience for users at the univer-\nsity level. To get the best of the cloud technology paradigm,\nthis article proposes a cloud computing adoption model as\nshown in Figure 1, which consists of the following:\n1. Strategic guidelines to overcome security and pri-\nvacy concerns\n2. Strategic guidelines to overcome reliability concerns\nof the Cloud Service Providers\n3. A roadmap for the successful adoption of cloud\ncomputing\nThe strategic guidelines should be followed when the\ndecision to adopt the cloud technology has been made so as\nto reduce to the barest minimum the negative impact that\ncomes with the adoption of the cloud technology of which\nsecurity and privacy concerns and reliability of the cloud ser-\nvice provider concerns were top of the list in the survey\nconducted.\nOvercoming the Barriers of Cloud Adoption\nFrom both secondary and primary data collected, it was gath-\nered that the main barriers to cloud computing adoption are\nsecurity and confidentiality of data concerns, privacy and\nregulatory compliance concerns, and reliability of the service\nprovider. Overcoming these concerns requires not just pre-\nventive and immediate solutions but also proactive and for-\nward thinking approaches; therefore this article has put in\nplace the following techniques to help in overcoming these\nchallenges.\nStrategic guidelines to overcome security and privacy con-\ncerns.Security and privacy concerns are two major issues\nStrategic guidelines to overcome\nsecurity and privacy concerns:\n*Encryption\n*Digital signature\n*Direct contact with vendor\n*Gradual migration\n*Investigating cloud vendors\n*Data splitting\nStrategic guidelines to overcome\nreliability of the CSP concerns:\n*Reliability and availability\n*Reputation of good track record\n*Assurance of security\n*Meeting requirements of the SLA\n*Transparency and code of practice\nRoadmap for the successful adoption of cloud computing:\n*Planning\n*Choosing the right deployment model\n*Choosing suitable service models\n*Vendor selection\n*SLA negotiation\n*Gradual migration\n*Proper Integration\nFigure 1. Proposed cloud computing adoption model.\nNote. SLA = Service Level Agreements.\nOkai et al. 5\nthat come with the adoption of cloud computing. Due to the\nimportance and confidentiality of educational data, the fol-\nlowing techniques and guideline should be implemented to\nhelp in overcoming these concerns:\nEncryption. This is the process of changing or transform-\ning information into a form that cannot be understood by\nany unauthorized person. By using this technique, the data\nare translated into a secret code that cannot be understood\nby anyone else except those who have the code or password\nto decrypt the encrypted information. This will protect the\ndata and ensure its authenticity and integrity, and further pre-\nvent the improper disclosure of confidential educational data\nstored in the cloud. Encryption is the main method used to\nensure the security of data stored in the cloud.\nDigital signature. Security and privacy concerns can also\nbe overcome by using digital signatures, an electronic sig-\nnature used to authenticate the identity of the user of the ser-\nvices provided over the cloud, by using this technique, the\nuser must provide the appropriate login or access credentials\nbefore they can have access to the information or application\nthey want to use. This will help to ensure the authenticity,\naccountability, and integrity of data in the cloud.\nDirect contact with the service provider.A direct contact\nshould be created between the university and cloud service\nprovider without the services of an intermediary, because the\nmore the levels or stages that the data have to pass from the\nvendor to the user, the more the chances of the data being\ncompromised. Direct contact will ensure that data are moved\nin one way direction, from the cloud vendor to the university.\nGradual sequence of migration.The migration toward\ncloud should not be done all at once, as much as the cloud\noffers cost savings, increased agility and efficiency caution\nshould be taken and the movement gradual with low risks\napplications going first. This will give the university time to\nsee whether the cloud project or the chosen vendor is wor-\nthy--if so, then the other applications can be moved step\nby step. In overcoming the barriers of security and privacy\nconcerns, it is important to ensure compatibility between the\nuniversity and cloud service providers' systems; by mov-\ning gradually, the compatibility of both parties would have\nbeen ascertained before more sensitive data are moved to the\ncloud.\nInvestigating cloud vendors.The chosen cloud provider(s)\nsecurity measures and the kind of security mechanisms,\ninfrastructure and configuration in place to ensure the\nsafety of data stored on their cloud, should be thoroughly\ninvestigated. Also, the plan for security events by the ser-\nvice provider detailing the responsibilities and actions to\nbe taken in the event of a security breach should be under-\nstood, analyzed, and ensured to be in line with the required\nstandards set by cloud computing bodies like the NIST\n(National Institute of Standards and Technology) and the\nCSA (Cloud Security Alliance) to ensure that the right level\nof security is provided by the cloud vendors to their clients\nand there are appropriate backups in place in case of any\nproblems or the occurrences of disasters like fire, flood, or\nearthquake (CSA, 2010). This investigation is necessary by\nadopters of the cloud technology in the educational sector\nto ensure constant availability and confidentiality because\nof the level of privacy that is required to preserve research\nresults and other confidential information.\nData splitting.This technique requires the use of more\nthan one service provider; the data to be stored in the cloud\nshould be split across different clouds, in a way, that pre-\nserves the confidentiality, availability, as well as integrity of\nthe data. The use of two or more cloud services improves\nperformance, avoids vendor lock-in, and reduces the risks\nof data loss and downtimes as security concerns such as data\nintegrity, intrusion, and service availability can be controlled\nusing fault-tolerant protocols across the multiple clouds. The\ndata splitting technique avails the universities the opportu-\nnity to use different clouds for different purposes because\nsome clouds are better than others for some applications;\nfor example, the public cloud from Google might be best\nfor email services whereas Microsoft Azure can be used to\nprovide both PaaS and IaaS services. As the cloud technol-\nogy advances, synchronizing data across multiple clouds is\neasier with the availability of migration solutions and the ser-\nvices of cloud-based service providers such as countability\nthat make it easier to manage multiple cloud providers at the\nsame time. Similarly, the cost of splitting data on multiple\nclouds should be carefully considered, the cost implications\ndiffer depending on the particular pricing scheme; applica-\ntions frequently used and kept running for extended periods\nmay have lower costs than those run for short periods.\nDespite the emphasis to ensure that the right deployment\nand most suitable service delivery models along with repu-\ntable cloud service providers are chosen for a safe and reli-\nable cloud, it is only natural that sometimes failures will\noccur; hence, using the multi-cloud strategy is a better and\nmore reliable way to handle failures when they happen as it\nis most unlikely that services from different providers will be\ndown at the same time. This technique also avails the univer-\nsities the opportunity to shift easily; if suddenly any of the\nservice providers decide to increase their prices or change\ntheir terms of business, the institutions will simply shut down\nfrom those providers and move to others with more favorable\npricing and terms of business.\nStrategic guidelines to overcome reliability of the service provider\nconcerns.The reliability of the service provider, in other\nwords trust, is a major obstacle and barrier to the adoption of\ncloud computing. Cloud service providers needed to be reli-\nable and trusted so that adopters of the cloud technology can\n6 SAGE Open\nbe confident to entrust their vital information to them for\nsafekeeping. The need to look up, properly research, and\nmake a comparison between different cloud vendors to\nensure reliability of the chosen vendor(s) cannot be overem-\nphasized. This is because information is the live wire of uni-\nversities, and all efforts should be put in place to ensure that\nmoving to the cloud brings true relief, solutions, and\nimproved services. These can only be achieved, and the\npromises of the cloud enjoyed if the cloud vendor used is\nreliable and trustworthy. To achieve this and overcome the\nbarrier posed by lack of trust and reliability of cloud service\nproviders, the following guidelines should be followed:\nReliability and availability.To ensure that the services in\nthe cloud are reliable and up and running well at all times,\nreliable cloud vendor is required. The chosen cloud service\nprovider should be one that guarantees service level, uptime\nand availability 99% of the time. The chosen vendor should\nhave redundancy of power, cooling systems, security sys-\ntem, servers, storage, excellent Internet connection, and fire\nsuppression systems among other things to ensure that the\nrequired services are consistently and constantly available.\nReputation of good track record. The chosen cloud vendor\nshould be one with good track record; this can be ascertained\nby how well their services function properly without frequent\ndowntimes and when they occur, how long they last before\nservice is fully restored. The reasons behind downtimes and\nfrequency of occurrence should be considered, this informa-\ntion can be gotten by finding out who their customers are and\nhow well they have enjoyed or not enjoyed the services of\nthe vendor. This should be carefully considered before data\nare moved to any vendors' data center.\nProviding security in the cloud.The university must be\nassured of tight, well-defined security services in the cloud\nbefore they employ the services of any vendor. These secu-\nrity services include identity management, access control\nas well as authorization and authentication mechanisms\nto ensure the right level of control within the cloud envi-\nronment and that only authorized personnel can make any\nchanges or additions to the data and applications in the cloud\nas a way of ensuring the security, privacy, and confidentiality\nof data. The service provider should have a comprehensive\nsecurity infrastructure in place at all levels of the services\nthey provide.\nSLA management.The cloud vendors should give guar-\nantee by providing service levels for all services they are\noffering and ensure to meet the requirements of the SLA.\nThe SLA should be negotiated to meet the expected level of\nservice quality and should include refund guarantees or some\nkind of penalties if the promised service level is not deliv-\nered. This will keep the service providers on their toes to\nmeet up with the terms and requirements of the SLA and the\nclients assured of quality service delivery.Also, the copyright\nlaws as contained in the vendors' SLA and that of the loca-\ntion where the vendors' infrastructures are located should be\ncarefully considered before commitments are made.\nTransparency and code of practice. The choice of the cloud\nvendor should be one that is transparent in their dealings\nwith clients and follow the code of practice unique to them\nas an organization and also that provided by cloud regulatory\nbodies to ensure the provision of highly secured and effi-\ncient services to their customers and be willing to explain\nany ambiguities and provide clarity to their clients when\nneeded. The service provider's chosen should be ones that\nare accountable and live up to their claims and promises.\nRoadmap for the successful adoption of cloud computing.The\nproposed roadmap as shown in Figure 2 has seven stages:\nplanning, choosing the right deployment model, choosing\nthe most suitable service models, vendor selection, negotiat-\ning the SLA, migration, and integration.\nStage 1: Planning.After the decision to adopt the cloud\ntechnology has been taken, the first step is to have a planning\nteam in place to plan and oversee the cloud project. The team\nshould have staff of the university's IT department who will\noffer advise based on what is currently in place in the uni-\nversity and at least one external cloud expert who will give\nprofessional, expert, and practical advice as that is their area\nof expertise. Having the right people in place from the very\nbeginning is necessary, because it will save a lot of costly\nmistakes from happening as the journey to the cloud contin-\nues. At the planning stage, the team should do a background\nstudy, identify the advantages and possible disadvantages of\nadopting cloud computing to the university, the university's\nreadiness to move to the cloud based on available infrastruc-\nture, and any other factors that may be considered important.\nFinally, the team should identify a system with best prac-\ntices to benchmark against; this is because for any project or\nchange to succeed, it has to be benchmarked against simi-\nlar processes that have succeed; doing this will give a better\nreflection of the current processes, policies, and standards\nand how the best practices that have been identified can be\nachieved.\nStage 2: Choosing the right deployment model.Choosing\nthe right deployment model is key to having a successful\ncloud platform, each of the four models of cloud computing\nhave their strengths and weaknesses. For instance, the public\ncloud model offers full utilization of computing resources;\nit is more cost efficient and scalable than the other models\nbut has greater security concerns whereas the private cloud\nthough not as cost efficient as the public cloud offers better\nsecurity. Therefore, to enjoy the full benefits and promises\nof adopting cloud computing, the hybrid model is recom-\nmended as the best deployment model because it combines\nOkai et al. 7\nthe strengths of the public and private clouds and handles\ntheir weaknesses more efficiently. The hybrid cloud provides\nscalability without boundaries; it is more cost-effective,\ngives the needed security, and offers great flexibility by giv-\ning its users the opportunity to explore different operational\navenues.\nStage 3: Choosing the most suitable service models. Just like\nthe deployment model, it is important to know which of the ser-\nvice models is most suitable to meet the needs and achieve the\nobjectives of migrating to the cloud. For instance, using IaaS\ndelivers everything: servers, storage, space, and networking\nequipments as a service. PaaS provides the platform for appli-\ncation developers to build and host their applications whereas\nSaaS provides complete applications to the end user of the\ncloud service; it only requires that the user has a web browser\nand is connected to the Internet. The choice of the delivery\nmodel is dependent on need. For a typical university setting,\neach of these three models will be useful as they all have their\nunique features relevant to the needs of the university.\nStage 4: Vendor selection.As stated in \"Strategic Guide-\nlines to Overcome Reliability of the Service Provider Con-\ncerns\" section above, the importance of choosing the right\nvendor cannot be overemphasized. This is because the suc-\ncess or failure of the cloud project lies strongly with the ven-\ndor delivering the service; hence, it is extremely important\nto investigate into the selected vendor before outsourcing.\nAfter investigating the reliability of the service provider,\nthe next line of consideration is the location where the data\nwill be stored; this is important because of legal compli-\nance that comes with different locations. Different countries\nhave different laws on the right to information in the land,\ninformation security, privacy, data protection, and different\nlevels of restrictions; therefore, it is important to understand\nthe local data protection requirement of the country or loca-\ntion where the data will be housed before commitments are\nmade.\nStage 5: Negotiating the SLA.The SLA is a very impor-\ntant document; it is a binding contract between the university\nand the cloud service provider. The terms of the SLA should\nbe negotiated and agreed upon by the university and chosen\nvendors before the deal is signed. Among other things, the\nagreements should include the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Planned downtimes by the vendor to check bugs, do\nmaintenance, and updates should be scheduled at\ntimes when the impact will be least felt. For example,\nat midnight of the university's location and preferably\nover the weekends; such times should be communi-\ncated to the university beforehand.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In the case of service transfer to another vendor, a\nseamless transfer without delay, downtime, and data\nloss should be assured.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Besides the service costs, all hidden costs within the\ndocuments for extra charges of any kind and terms\nand conditions written in tiny fonts should be made\nclear and properly understood by the university before\nthe SLA is signed to avoid any misunderstandings in\nthe future.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The chosen vendor should assure 99.9% availability\nand have an immediate data recovery plan in case of\nany disaster.\nStage 6: Migration.At this stage, the chosen deployment\nmodel and processes to be hosted on the service delivery\nmodels are mapped out.\nMigration\nNegotiating the SLA\nVendor selection\nChoosing the most suitable\nservice delivery model\nChoosing the right\ndeployment model\nPlanning\nSafe and\nreliable cloud\nFigure 2. Roadmap for successful adoption of cloud computing.\nNote. SLA = Service Level Agreements.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe hybrid cloud. This article proposes the hybrid cloud\nas the most suitable deployment model for universities.\nDeploying the hybrid cloud will offer cost benefits to the\nmanagement of the university; it will also make it easier for\nstaff to share resources not just within the same university\nbut also with other universities around the world. Likewise,\nlecturers do not have to carry their notes around as it can be\neasily accessed through any device because it is available in\nthe cloud. Also with the hybrid model, the fear of privacy\nand other security-related issues are avoided, as very criti-\ncal and sensitive data whose confidentiality cannot be com-\npromised will be hosted on premise in the university's data\ncenter, which serves as a private cloud. This article further\nproposes that the public cloud should combine the services\nof different cloud service providers to serve students and\nstaff of the university more efficiently as well as avoid the\nproblem of vendor lock-in.\nThe SaaS layer. The SaaS layer represents the top layer\nof the cloud. It offers its services in a software model of\nweb-based applications and serves a large number of users.\nAll that is required from the user of the application is a con-\nnection to the Internet. With SaaS, the user does not need\nto install or run any applications on their devices or worry\nabout maintenance, upgrades, and support. Applications\nsuch as e-learning systems, admission process, research,\nfaculty and student corners, admin, digital library, email,\naccount and financial processes, student life cycle and infor-\nmation system, classroom management system, and other\nadministrative processes can be hosted on the SaaS layer for\neasy access and convenience for students, academic as well\nadministrative staff of the university. This can be on the pub-\nlic as well as a private cloud, the most sensitive applications\nsuch as the admission process, account and financial ser-\nvices, and any other services considered critical and requires\nvery high confidentiality should be hosted on a private cloud.\nThe SaaS services on the public cloud can be provided by\ncloud vendors such as Salesforce.com, Google, and Sky-\nDrive. Using SaaS will help to overcome the problems of\nlimited modern teaching and learning resources and lack of\ne-learning scalability.\nThe PaaS layer.The PaaS layer is the middle layer\nbetween the SaaS and IaaS. It is an environment for web\ndevelopers to create, store, and host their applications over\nthe Internet. The services on this layer eliminate the need to\ncreate and manage instances of virtual machines. The PaaS\nlayer facilitates the development and deployment of appli-\ncations without the developers worrying about the cost and\ncomplexity of buying, managing, or configuring the under-\nlaying layers needed for developing applications because\nthe development tools are already hosted in the cloud and\nprovided by the cloud vendor. This layer provides access\nto different platforms and programming languages, thereby\nmaking it possible for developers and programming students\nto easily do their work by simply connecting to the cloud.\nThis layer can be hosted on a public cloud using Force.com,\nMicrosoft Azure, Google App Engine, and so on.\nThe IaaS layer. The IaaS also referred to everything as a\nservice layer provides basic computing resources including\nservers, storage, hardware, and networking equipments. This\nlayer delivers computing IaaS in a virtualized environment. It\ncould also include the operating system, bandwidth, and vir-\ntualization technology needed to manage the resources. It all\ndepends on need and negotiation with the cloud service pro-\nvider. IaaS offers everything as a service; it helps to address\nthe problem of limited learning resources and the e-learning\nscalability. One of the key players in the IaaS layer isAmazon\nE2C (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud), it reduces the time\nneeded to get and bootup new servers to minutes, it allows\nquick scaling capacity back and forth as demands change and\nprovides a computing environment and resources that quickly\nand cost-effectively process large amounts of research data.\nOtherprovidersofthisserviceareHP,GoGrid,Rackspace,and\nso on.\nStage 7: Integration.A successful integration is the key\nto realizing the full potential of the entire cloud investment.\nLack of proper integration of the cloud with existing on-\npremise applications has been identified as one of the key\nreasons why cloud projects fail in the survey conducted;\ntherefore, to avoid this from happening, a proper integration\nis needed to harmonize processes across the hybrid model.\nIntegration can be done using any of the three common tra-\nditional approaches like on-demand integration tools that\nconnect multiple clouds together mainly adopted by small\ncompanies that have low-cost integration options or by\nimplementing complex on-premise software platforms also\ncalled the traditional middleware solutions, which provide\nsophisticated functionalities and are mainly used to meet\nthe integration needs of large enterprises; the third type of\nthe traditional approach is by writing custom codes. Besides\nthese traditional approaches, other approaches to integrating\nthe cloud with on-premise applications is by using applica-\ntions like WebSpace cast iron by IBM, Oracle cloud integra-\ntion by Oracle, Boomi Atmosphere by Dell, or any of the\nother integration platforms available.\nTesting of the Model\nBoth interview and questionnaire survey were conducted by\nthis study as means of primary data collection. Table 1 shows\nthe summary of the responses gotten from the\nquestionnaire.\nBased on the responses above, the model was created and\nsent to experts who have adopted and implemented the cloud\ntechnology in one of the renowned universities (Asia Pacific\nUniversity of Technology and Innovation [APU], Malaysia)\nfor testing, so as to evaluate the effectiveness of the model in\nOkai et al. 9\nmeeting the needs of its users. APU has had a successful\nimplementation of the cloud technology. The university uses\nthe hybrid cloud model by combining a private cloud on\ncampus and public clouds of external cloud service providers\nto meet the needs of its students and staff. By adopting the\nhybrid module, the university can deploy cloud services on\nvarying scales on the three-service delivery models depend-\ning on need, frequency of access, and level of security\nneeded. For instance, the university uses the SaaS services\non both private and public clouds with more sensitive appli-\ncations left behind the university's firewalls on premises.\nAlso, the researcher found that the university through its\nadoption of the cloud technology achieves savings of 95% in\nthe number of servers used as 10 servers were effectively\nused to do the same job of 200 servers. Overall, the adoption\nof cloud computing not only saves APU from spending more\nin providing quality cloud services to her students and staff\nbut also saves on storage space, cooling facilities, and reduc-\ntion in the amount of carbon footprint generated as well as a\nmore robust, secured, and high-performance network.\nConclusion\nThe advent of cloud computing sparked the interest of many\nuniversities around the world to opt for the cloud as an alter-\nnative means of delivering quality IT services to students,\nstaff, and the educational community at reduced cost.\nHowever, the failures experienced by early adopters of the\ncloud technology and challenges that come with its adoption\nhave left many skeptical in committing to it. This article dis-\ncussed those challenges peculiar to higher institutions of\nlearning and proffered solutions that can be followed to\nreduce to the barest minimum the issues of cloud computing\nadoption so as to ensure a safer and more reliable transition\nto the cloud for users at the university level.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This research was\nsupported in part by the Centre for Research and Instrumentation\nManagement (CRIM), University Kebangsaan Malaysia; Grant\nReferences\nBabu, S.
