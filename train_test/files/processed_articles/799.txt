We have made a\ncomparative analysis of these inequalities in the United\nStates and 11 western European countries. The aims of the\nanalysis were (1) to compare the size of inequalities in\ncardiovascular disease mortality between countries, and (2)\nto explore the possible contribution of cardiovascular risk\nfactors to the explanation of between-country differences in\ninequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality.\nData and Methods Data on ischaemic heart disease,\ncerebrovascular disease and total cardiovascular disease\nmortality by occupational class and/or educational level\nwere obtained from national longitudinal or unlinked cross-\nsectional studies. Data on smoking, alcohol consumption,\noverweight and infrequent consumption of fresh vegetables\nby occupational class and/or educational level were\nobtained from national health interview or multipurpose\nsurveys and from the European Union's Eurobarometer\nsurvey. Age-adjusted rate ratios for mortality were corre-\nlated with age-adjusted odds ratios for the behavioural\nrisk factors.\nResults In all countries mortality from cardiovascular\ndiseases is higher among persons with lower occupational\nclass or lower educational level. Within western Europe, a\nnorth\u00adsouth gradient is apparent, with relative and\nabsolute inequalities being larger in the north than in the\nsouth. For ischaemic heart disease, but not for cerebro-\nvascular disease, an even more striking north\u00adsouth gradi-\nent is seen, with some `reverse' inequalities in southern\nEurope. The United States occupy intermediate positions\non most indicators. Inequalities in cardiovascular disease\nmortality are associated with inequalities in some risk\nfactors, especially cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol\nconsumption.\nConclusions Socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular\ndisease mortality are a major public health problem in most\nindustrialized countries. Closing the gap between low and\nhigh socioeconomic groups offers great potential for reduc-\ning cardiovascular disease mortality. Developing effective\nmethods of behavioural risk factor reduction in the\nlower socioeconomic groups should be a top priority in\ncardiovascular disease prevention.\n 2000 The European Society of Cardiology\nKey Words: Cardiovascular diseases; mortality; risk\nfactors; socioeconomic status.\nIntroduction\nIt is well-known that in many industrialized countries\ncardiovascular disease mortality is higher among those\nof lower than higher socioeconomic status, as indicated\nby educational level, occupational class or income\nlevel[1,2]. If the higher cardiovascular mortality rates in\nthe lower socioeconomic groups could be reduced the\naverage rates of cardiovascular disease mortality in these\ncountries could similarly be lowered.\nIn order to achieve these reductions, however, the\ncauses of the inequalities must be known.

Mackenbach, Department of Public\nThe Netherlands.\nfrom epidemiological studies on ischaemic heart disease\nmortality among selected populations within the United\nKingdom, the Nordic countries or the U.S.A.[3\u00ad6]. A\ngeneral finding is that only part of the socioeconomic\ngradient in ischaemic heart disease mortality can be\nexplained by a higher prevalence of classical risk factors\nlike smoking, serum cholesterol and hypertension[3\u00ad6].\nWe report on a study which followed a different\napproach: we quantified the magnitude of inequalities in\ncardiovascular disease mortality in a number of indus-\ntrialized countries, and then looked to see whether\nbetween-country differences in the magnitude of risk-\nfactor inequalities matches that of cardiovascular dis-\nease mortality. This approach takes advantage of the\nlarge variation between countries in the epidemiology\nand social patterning of cardiovascular disease and its\nrisk factors.\nThe aims of this study were: to quantify socioeco-\nnomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality in\na large number of industrialized countries; to determine\nthe association between inequalities in cardiovascular\ndisease mortality and inequalities in risk factors in these\ncountries.\nThis study covers men and women aged 30\u00ad59 in the\nUnited States and 11 countries in western Europe. Both\ntotal cardiovascular disease mortality and mortality\nfrom its main components, ischaemic heart disease and\ncerebrovascular disease, were studied. Risk factors\nwhich were included in the analysis are cigarette smok-\ning, alcohol consumption, overweight and lack of fresh\nvegetables.\nData and methods\nMortality data\nAn overview of data sources for mortality can be found\nin Table 1. For the United States we obtained data from\nthe National Longitudinal Mortality Study, which in-\nvolves a 10-year follow-up of 0\u00b75% of the population[7].\nFor 6 out of 11 countries in western Europe (the Nordic\ncountries, England/Wales and Italy) we also obtained\ndata from longitudinal studies, most of which involved a\nfollow-up of the complete national population enumer-\nated at the census. The exceptions are England and\nWales, where a 1% sample of the national population\nwas followed-up[8], and Italy where the available study\ncovers the population of the city of Turin only[9]. For the\nother five countries in western Europe data were ob-\ntained from cross-sectional studies. In these studies,\nmortality is classified according to socioeconomic infor-\nmation on the death certificate, and related to the\npopulation present in the same period, classified accord-\ning to socioeconomic information obtained during the\ncensus. Broadly speaking, the longitudinal mortality\ndata cover the 1980s (with classification by occupation\nor education and by age based on the situation around\n1980), while the cross-sectional data cover a couple of\nyears surrounding the beginning of the decade.\nFor all countries, mortality could be classified by\noccupational class, but only for men. In order to avoid\ncomparability problems, a common occupational class\nscheme, the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero (EGP)\nscheme[10], was applied to as many countries as possible.\nEGP conversion algorithms[10,11] were applied to\nindividual-level data on occupational title (by 3-digit\ncode), employment status and supervisory status. These\nconversion schemes could not be applied to the data\navailable for Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain and\nPortugal. Data from these countries, classified on the\nbasis of national schemes, could, however, be made\ncomparable to the EGP scheme at the level of three\nbroad classes: non-manual occupations, manual occu-\npations, and farmers/farm labourers[12]. We will report\non the rate ratio of mortality among men in manual as\ncompared to men in non-manual occupations.\nIn most countries, there was insufficient information\non the former occupation of economically inactive men\n(retired, disabled, unemployed, etc.), who would there-\nfore have been excluded from the analysis. This exclu-\nsion is likely to lead to an under-estimation of mortality\ndifferences between occupational classes[13,14]. We there-\nfore applied a procedure which corrects for this under-\nestimation, and which is based on the population share\nand the relative mortality level of economically inactive\nmen. This adjustment was made for cardiovascular\ndiseases separately. Further details on this procedure,\nas well on tests of its performance, can be found\nFor some of the countries in this study, mortality\ncould also be classified by level of education. In contrast\nto occupational class, level of education could be used in\nan internationally comparable way for the classification\nof women. Educational level was measured as the\nhighest level of education which the subject had com-\npleted. OECD guidelines were used to reclassify the\noriginal educational categories into a common\nTable 1 Overview of sources of data for mortality\nCountry Period\nNumber of deaths from\ncardiovascular diseases\nMen Women\na 0\u00b75% sample of population; b 1% sample of population; c city of\nTorino\nscheme[16]. In different countries, different degrees of\ndetail in educational classification could be achieved. We\nwill report on the rate ratio of mortality of men and\nwomen with lower secondary, primary or no completed\neducation, as compared to men and women with upper\nsecondary or tertiary education.\nCardiovascular disease mortality was defined as mor-\nto the ninth revision of the International Classification\nof Diseases[17]. The corresponding code-numbers for\nischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were\nproportion of cardiovascular disease mortality which is\naccounted for by ischaemic heart disease, ranged from\n39% in Portugal to 78% in Norway and Ireland, and\ncerebrovascular disease accounted for between 10% in\nNorway and Switzerland and 39% in Portugal. Among\nwomen, the proportions of ischaemic heart disease were\nsmaller and those of cerebrovascular disease larger than\namong men, but the international pattern of these\nproportions was the same.\nRate ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were\ncalculated on the basis of Poisson regression analysis.\nThe regression models included age as a nominal vari-\nable (5-year age-groups). In the case of the U.S.A.,\nregression models also included ethnicity (Hispanic/\nother white/black/all other), because we consider eth-\nnicity to be a potential confounder of the relationship\nbetween socioeconomic variables and mortality. Ethnic-\nity is associated with, and causally antecedent to, edu-\ncational achievement, and is also an independent risk\nfactor for mortality[18]. In practice, this adjustment had\nvery little impact on the results.\nAlthough rate ratios are our primary outcome\nmeasure, we will also present data on absolute levels of\ncardiovascular disease mortality by occupational class\nand educational level. The rate ratios are adequate\nmeasures for analytical purposes, for example for com-\nparison with (relative) inequalities in risk factors, but\nabsolute differences in cardiovascular disease mortality\nare more relevant for public health policy.\nRisk factor data\nData on risk factors were obtained from two sources:\nnational health interview or multipurpose surveys (avail-\nable for eight western European countries[15] and for the\nU.S.A.[19]), and Eurobarometer surveys. The latter is a\nmultipurpose survey commissioned by the European\nUnion and executed in a standardized way in all member\nstates (available for seven western European countries in\nNational health interview or multipurpose survey data\nwere available to quantify inequalities in current ciga-\nrette smoking by level of education. The data cover the\nwhich we have mortality data to correspond, we re-\nstricted the analysis to the age-group 40\u00ad69. This group\nsecular trends and selection effects, inequalities in risk\nfactors observed in these cohorts around 1990 are likely\nto reflect the differences in exposure within the cohorts\nfor which we have analysed inequalities in mortality.\nSample sizes in this age-group ranged between ca. 1000\nEurobarometer data were available to quantify\ninequalities in a wider range of risk factors, both by level\nof education and by occupational class. Data were\navailable for current cigarette smoking, moderate\nalcohol consumption (1\u00ad4 glasses/day), excessive alcohol\nconsumption (>4 glasses/day for men, >3 glasses/day\nfor women), overweight (body mass index >27), and\nlack of fresh vegetables (<3 days per week). The data\nsis to the age-group 40\u00ad69, for the same reasons as\nmentioned above. Sample sizes in this age-group were\n(smoking) in all countries.\nIn the national surveys, the educational measure was\nsimilar to that in the mortality studies, which permitted\nus to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios of risk factor\nprevalence among men and women with lower second-\nary, primary or no education, as compared to men and\nwomen with upper secondary and tertiary education,\nusing logistic regression. In the Eurobarometers, the\neducational groups which could be compared are those\nwith 0\u00ad11 years of education and those with 12 years of\neducation or more, classification into manual and non-\nmanual occupations could also be made. The regression\nmodels included age as a nominal variable (5-year age\ngroups).\nIn order to explore the possible contribution of\ninequalities in behavioural risk factors to inequalities in\ncardiovascular disease mortality, we calculated Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients between the age-adjusted odds\nratios for the risk factors and the age-adjusted rate ratios\nfor mortality. Because of the limited number of\ncountries for which educational differences in mortality\ncould be calculated, we restricted this correlation analy-\nsis to the data on inequalities in mortality by occu-\npational class. Although such a comparison is suitable,\nwe also calculated correlations with inequalities in risk\nfactors by educational level, because the occupational\ndata in the Eurobarometer are rather crude and because\nthe national survey data, which were only available by\neducational level, cover a larger number of countries.\nResults\nMortality\nTable 2 gives an overview of the age-adjusted rates of\ncardiovascular disease mortality by occupational class\nand educational level observed in this study. In all\ncountries mortality is higher among persons with lower\noccupational class or (in the subset of countries for\nwhich these data are available) lower educational level.\nThis applies to both men and women.\nThere is, however, substantial variation between\ncountries in the magnitude of these differences. This\nvariation can best be observed for mortality by occu-\npational class among middle-aged men. Absolute differ-\nences are smallest in Portugal and largest in Finland,\ndue to a combination of low (high) average death\nrates and small (large) relative differences in mortality.\nGenerally speaking, there appears to be a north\u00adsouth\ngradient in western Europe, with average rates, absolute\ndifferences and relative differences being larger in the\nnorth than in the south. The United States occupy an\nintermediate position.\nFigure 1 illustrates the international variation in rela-\ntive differences by occupational class. The north\u00adsouth\ngradient within western Europe for cardiovascular dis-\nease mortality can clearly be discerned, with rate ratios\nheart disease an even more striking north\u00adsouth gradi-\nent is evident. Rate ratios are clearly above 1\u00b700 in the\nNordic countries, in England and Wales and Ireland,\nbut below 1\u00b700 in Spain and Portugal, indicating that in\nthe latter countries mortality from ischaemic heart dis-\nease is higher in the higher occupational classes. For\ncerebrovascular disease the international pattern is dif-\nferent, with a very high rate ratio in England and Wales\nand rate ratios above 1\u00b700 in the south of Europe too.\nLess clear international patterns are seen for mortality\namong men and women by educational level, for which\ndata are available in a subset of countries (Figure 2).\nHowever, within western Europe there is a clear contrast\nbetween the three Nordic countries (large inequalities in\ncardiovascular disease mortality among both men and\nwomen) and Italy (smaller inequalities). It is also inter-\nesting to note that rate ratios are generally higher for\nwomen than for men.\nRisk factors\nBecause of space limitations we have not included\ndetailed data on inequalities in behavioural risk factors.\nAlthough we found higher prevalences in the lower\nsocioeconomic groups for most risk factors in most\ncountries, we also found marked international differ-\nences in these patterns. Men and women in lower\noccupational and/or educational groups are more often\nTable 2 Rates of cardiovascular disease mortality, men\nand women aged 30\u00ad59 years, by occupational class and\nMen Women\nOccupational\nclass\nEducation\nlevel\nEducational\nlevel\nHigh Low High Low High Low\naBecause of differences between studies in design (e.g. certain\nexclusions, length of follow-up, etc.) these absolute rates could not\nbe calculated directly from the observed numbers of cardiovascular\ndeaths in each study. Instead, we used the national mortality rates\nfrom cardiovascular diseases (obtained from the World Health\nOrganization and standardized to the European Standard Popu-\nlation), and multiplied these by the Standardized Mortality Ratios\nfor high and low socioeconomic groups (calculated with data from\nthe studies in Table 1).\nNor Den Eng Ire Fra Swi Ita Spa Por U.S.A.\nFin\n(c)\nRR manual vs non-manual\nSwe\nNor Den Eng Ire Fra Swi Ita Spa Por U.S.A.\nFin\n(b)\nRR manual vs non-manual\nSwe\nNor Den Eng Ire Fra Swi Ita Spa Por U.S.A.\nFin\n(a)\nRR manual vs non-manual\nSwe\nFigure 1 Inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality\nby occupational class, men 30\u00ad59 years.

Men and women in\nlower socioeconomic groups are also less often moderate\nalcohol consumers in all countries. Among men,\nprevalence rates of excessive alcohol consumption are\ngenerally higher in the lower socioeconomic groups\n(differences being largest in England/Wales and Ireland),\nbut among women no clear differences were found in\nany of the countries. Men and women in lower socio-\neconomic groups are more often overweight in all\ncountries, with differences being smallest in Ireland,\nSpain and Portugal. Finally, men and women in lower\nsocioeconomic groups less frequently eat fresh veg-\netables, with differences being smallest in Italy, France\nand Portugal.\nTable 3 presents the correlations between\ninequalities in risk factors and inequalities in mortality\namong men. The international pattern of inequalities in\ncardiovascular disease mortality corresponds closely\nwith that of inequalities in cigarette smoking and excess-\nive alcohol consumption. This is particularly evident\nfor inequalities in risk factors by level of education,\nwhere several correlations above 0\u00b780 were found.\nCountries with larger inequalities in cigarette smoking\nand with larger inequalities in excessive alcohol con-\nsumption also have larger inequalities in cardiovascular,\nischaemic and cerebrovascular disease mortality (Fig. 3).\nNegative correlations are seen for moderate alcohol\nconsumption.\nDiscussion\nSummary of findings\nWe found socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular\ndisease mortality in all countries included in this study,\nthereby confirming many earlier reports covering single\nthat we have documented important variations between\ncountries in the magnitude, and sometimes the direction,\nof these inequalities.\nFor total cardiovascular disease mortality, inequalities\nare larger in the Nordic countries and England/Wales\nand Ireland, than in the south of Europe. This applies to\nboth relative and absolute measures of inequalities, and\nsuggests that the potential benefits of lowering cardio-\nvascular disease mortality in the lower socioeconomic\ngroups are larger in the former than in the latter group of\ncountries. This international pattern is mainly deter-\nmined by ischaemic heart disease mortality, for which\nwe even found `reverse' gradients in some southern\nEuropean countries. There is no north\u00adsouth gradient\nfor inequalities in cerebrovascular disease mortality.\nThe risk factor data suggest that these international\npatterns are at least partly due to differences between\ncountries in the social patterning of health-related\nbehaviour. It appears that inequalities in cardiovascular\ndisease mortality are consistently larger in countries\nwhere inequalities in cigarette smoking and in excessive\nalcohol consumption are larger.\nEvaluation of data problems\nAlthough we have made every effort to increase com-\nparability of data between countries, the validity of\nour results may be threatened by residual differences\nbetween countries in data collection. We have identified\nfour potential problem areas: certification and coding\nof causes of death; measurement of socioeconomic\ninequalities in mortality; reliability of survey data; and\nmismatches between the mortality and the risk factor\ndata.\nNor Den Ita U.S.A.\nFin\n(c)\nRR low vs high education\nNor Den Ita U.S.A.\nFin\n(b)\nRR low vs high education\nNor Den Ita U.S.A.\nFin\n(a)\nRR low vs high education\nU.S.A.\nU.S.A.\nU.S.A.\nNor Den Ita\nFin\nNor Den Ita\nFin\nNor Den Ita\nFin\nMen\nMen\nMen\nWomen\nWomen\nWomen\nFigure 2 Inequalities in cardiovascular disease by level\nof education, men and women 30\u00ad59 years.

It is\npossible that rates of cardiovascular disease mortality,\nand particularly ischaemic heart disease mortality, are\nunder-estimated in the south of Europe, because recog-\nnition of this disease is less well developed than in the\nnorth. This would affect the comparison of the absolute\nrates as presented in Table 2, but not necessarily the\ncomparison of the rate ratios presented in Fig. 1. What\nmatters for the validity of the comparison of rate ratios\nis whether the degree of under-estimation of cardiovas-\ncular disease mortality differs between socioeconomic\ngroups, and whether this difference is larger in some\ncountries than in others. There is no direct evidence to\nsupport or refute this possibility, but the fact that the\ninequalities in total mortality (without a distinction by\ncause of death) are also smaller in the south of\nEurope[12,28], suggests that substantial bias is unlikely.\nDespite our own efforts at increasing comparability\nbetween countries in measurement of socioeconomic\ninequalities in mortality (e.g. by reclassification of the\noriginal individual-level data into common occupational\nclass and educational level schemes), there may be\nresidual comparability problems which affect our\nresults. Examples are differences in study design (longi-\ntudinal or unlinked cross-sectional), in year of study\n(early 1980s or whole decade), and in the measurement\nof occupation (approximate EGP schemes in some\ncountries, correction for exclusion of economically inac-\ntive men). Elsewhere we have made an extensive evalu-\nation of these residual comparability problems[12,15], and\nour conclusion was that the margins of uncertainty are\nwide and differ in width between countries and socioeco-\nnomic indicators. Due to a cumulation of various data\nproblems, the margins of uncertainty are particularly\nwide for inequalities by occupational class in Ireland,\nSpain and Portugal. Most countries with wide margins\nof uncertainty have small inequalities in cardiovascular\ndisease mortality, but there is no reason to assume that\nthe net effect of the residual comparability problems is to\nunderestimate inequalities in mortality: some problems\nmay produce bias in an upward, others in a downward\ndirection[12,15]. Nevertheless, it is good to be careful in\ndrawing conclusions, and to focus on the overall picture,\nnot on one of these countries in isolation.\nThe data on behavioural risk factors from the Euro-\nbarometer surveys are based on identical questions in\neach country, but the phrasing of the questions on\nsmoking in the national surveys slightly differed between\ncountries. It is unlikely that this has seriously biased our\nresults, because the correlations between inequalities in\nsmoking and inequalities in mortality were very similar\nfor the Eurobarometer and the national surveys (Table\n3). A more important source of bias might be that the\nbehavioural risk factor data are entirely based on self-\nreports. Misreporting (recall bias, social desirability, . . .)\nmay be associated with socioeconomic status[29\u00ad31], but\nthe main question for our study is whether this associ-\nation differs between countries. Similarly, non-response\nmay be associated with socioeconomic status[32,33], and\nalthough a Swedish study showed that socioeconomic\ninequalities in smoking are not very sensitive to differ-\nences between responders and non-responders in smok-\ning[34], we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of bias\nin the international pattern of socioeconomic inequali-\nties in risk factors as observed in our study. It is unlikely\nthat better data will become available in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nUnfortunately, the mortality and risk factor data\ncame from different sources, and a direct assessment of\nthe contribution of these risk factors to inequalities in\ncardiovascular mortality between individuals inside each\ncountry was impossible. Instead, we combined these\ndata in a cross-national analysis, and the results of this\naggregate level or `ecological' analysis should not be\ntaken as indicative of the corresponding individual level\nrelationships. For example, a cross-national correlation\nbetween inequalities in smoking and inequalities in\nOR excessive alchohol consumption\nRR IHD mortality\nfra\nOR cigarette smoking\nRR IHD mortality\nspa\npor\nden\nire\neng\nspa\npor\nden\nfin\neng\nita\nswi\nusa\nnor\nFigure 3 Scatter plots for inequalities in selected risk\nfactors against inequalities in ischaemic heart disease\nmortality.\nischaemic heart disease mortality of 1\u00b700 would not\nimply that within each country all between-individual\ninequalities in ischaemic heart disease mortality are due\nto inequalities in smoking. Nevertheless, the high cross-\nnational correlations which we found for smoking and\nischaemic heart disease can only be meaningfully inter-\npreted if smoking is important at the individual level\ntoo -- which of course it is. There is even some evidence\nthat the relative excess risk of ischaemic heart disease\ndue to smoking is larger in the lower social classes,\npossibly because of an interaction of smoking with other\nrisk factors[35]. This increases the likelihood that\ninequalities in smoking are very important for the\nexplanation of inequalities in cardiovascular mortality.\nThe inequalities in risk factors were measured on the\nbasis of data collected around 1990, while the inequali-\nties in mortality were measured on the basis of data\ncollected in the early or full 1980s. In order to improve\nthe link between these two types of data, we took care to\nmeasure inequalities in risk factors in the same cohorts\nas the mortality data (see data and methods section).\nThis procedure is based on the assumption that within\nthese cohorts, inequalities in risk factors have not\ndo not know whether this assumption holds. Several\nnational studies have documented a widening of in-\nand a similar widening may have occurred for other risk\nfactors. We consider it unlikely, however, that this has\nseriously biased our results. The trends in the social\npatterning of the smoking epidemic are slow and similar\ntrends have been observed in many countries, so that\nsubstantial changes in the international pattern of\ninequalities in smoking within a ten-year period are\nunlikely.\nInterpretation\nSystematic international comparisons of socioeconomic\ninequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality have\nseldom been made, but those that have included a\nsmaller range of countries, and paid less attention to\npotential comparability problems[40\u00ad42]. Our study con-\nfirms previous reports on smaller inequalities in cardio-\nvascular disease mortality in southern Europe[41\u00ad42], and\nalso provides some clues as to the possible causes of this\nsituation.\nThe main contributor to this international pattern is\nischaemic heart disease mortality, and it is likely that the\nsmaller (perhaps even `reversed') inequalities in ischae-\nmic heart disease mortality are at least partly due to\ndifferences with northern Europe in the social patterning\nof cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. In south-\nern Europe, smoking is less frequent in the lower socio-\neconomic groups, and this is likely to reflect an early\nstage in the smoking epidemic: in many countries in\nnorthern Europe and in the U.S.A., uptake of smoking\nstarted in the higher socioeconomic groups, and so did\nstopping smoking[43\u00ad45]. In southern Europe, inequalities\nin excessive alcohol consumption are also smaller than\nin northern Europe. Perhaps surprisingly, the largest\nodds ratios for excessive alcohol consumption (>4\nglasses/day) were found in England and Wales\n(OR=2\u00b707). As excessive alcohol consumption increases\nthe risk of ischaemic heart and cerebrovascular disease\nmortality[46\u00ad48] this may help to explain the larger in-\nequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality, although\ninequalities in excessive alcohol consumption are corre-\nlated with inequalities in smoking, and the latter may\nthus act as confounders.\nThe international pattern of inequalities in excessive\nalcohol consumption changed slightly upon increasing\nthe lower limit to 6 glasses/day. England and Wales still\nhas the largest inequalities (OR=3\u00b799), but Spain now\nranks second. The correlation with inequalities in car-\ndiovascular disease mortality declined from 0\u00b789 (Table\n3) to 0\u00b757 (results not shown). A similar decline occurred\nbut not for cerebrovascular disease mortality (from 0\u00b788\nto 0\u00b772), suggesting that inequalities in very excessive\nalcohol consumption are more important for the latter.\nThere is less evidence in our data for a contribution\nfrom the traditional Mediterranean diet, which has been\nclaimed to have cardioprotective effects[49,50] and which\nis likely to be more prevalent in the lower than in the\nhigher socioeconomic groups in southern Europe[51].\nThis may be due to the fact that the only dietary factor\n(other than alcohol consumption) for which we had data\nis lack of fresh vegetables, which only covers one aspect\nof the Mediterranean diet. Although inequalities in this\nvariable are smaller in southern Europe, the correlation\nwith inequalities in ischaemic heart disease mortality\nwas only moderately positive (Table 3). It is puzzling\nthat inequalities in overweight are not clearly associated\nwith inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality.\nThis is perhaps due to confounding between risk factors.\nMore generally, it is unfortunate that many risk factors\nfor cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure,\ndyslipidaemia, diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle, could\nnot be examined in this study.\nThis interpretation of our results fits into the popular\n`diffusion theory' of the epidemic of ischaemic heart\ndisease mortality[52\u00ad54]. According to this theory, the rise\nof ischaemic heart disease started in the higher socioeco-\nnomic groups in the richer countries, because these were\nthe first who appreciated and could afford the behav-\niours (smoking, a diet rich in saturated fats, lack of\nphysical exercise, . . .) which increase the risk of ischae-\nmic heart disease. From them the disease spread to other\npopulations (lower socioeconomic groups, poorer\ncountries), partly as a result of rising living standards,\npartly as a result of imitation. When the epidemic\nstarted to decline, the higher socioeconomic groups in\nthe richer countries were again the first to benefit,\nbecause they were the first to adopt the behavioural\nchanges (stopping smoking, less saturated fat, more\nexercise) which were required for a reduction in risk of\nischaemic heart disease. As a result, the well-known\ninverse gradient of ischaemic heart disease mortality\nemerged. From this perspective, the situation in\nsouthern Europe, particularly Portugal with its higher\nischaemic heart disease mortality in the higher socioeco-\nnomic groups, may represent a pre- or early epidemic\nstage, from which an epidemic of ischaemic heart disease\nand/or inverse gradients could still develop. Although\nthere is no evidence of rising mortality from ischaemic\nheart disease in southern Europe, reports from Spain\nand France suggest that inverse gradients of ischaemic\nheart disease mortality have emerged during the\nof smoking shows that inverse gradients of cigarette\nsmoking had emerged among young men in southern\nThe fact that inequalities in cerebrovascular disease\nmortality are not smaller in southern Europe is difficult\nto understand on the basis of our data alone. Correla-\ntions with inequalities in risk factors, particularly smok-\ning and excessive alcohol consumption, are generally the\nsame for ischaemic heart disease and for cerebrovascular\ndisease mortality (Table 3), although inequalities in very\nexcessive alcohol consumption have higher correlations\nwith the latter. It is likely, therefore, that other risk\nfactors are involved, such as other components of the\nMediterranean diet. Although the Mediterranean diet\nprotects against ischaemic heart disease, the relatively\nhigh rates of cerebrovascular disease mortality in\nsouthern Europe suggest that it may increase the risk\nof cerebrovascular disease, for example through high\nsodium intakes[58,59]. If lower socioeconomic groups\nin southern Europe still more frequently observe the\ntraditional diet, this would at least partly explain the\nlower rates of ischaemic heart disease mortality and\nthe higher rates of cerebrovascular disease mortality.\nDifferences between countries in blood pressure control,\nand particularly in accessibility of blood pressure con-\ntrol to lower socioeconomic groups, are another possible\nexplanation.\nIt is interesting to note that the U.S.A. occupies an\nintermediate position between northern and southern\nEurope, at least with regard to inequalities in total\ncardiovascular disease mortality. This may reflect the\nmore heterogeneous nature of the U.S.A. population,\nwhich may average out the experience of some subpopu-\nlations with larger inequalities. In a further analysis of\nthe U.S.A. data, however, we found no evidence of\nsystematic differences between ethnic groups in the size\nof inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality\n(results not shown). Unfortunately, we were not able to\nanalyse the U.S.A. data by country of birth, so that we\ncould not compare inequalities among whites of north-\nern European descent with those among whites of\nsouthern European descent.\nOur emphasis on behavioural risk factors should not\ndistract from the fact that these are themselves closely\nlinked to material and/or structural factors[60]. Stronks\ndifference in smoking behaviour between socioeconomic\ngroups appeared to be associated with adverse material\nconditions. Also qualitative studies, most of which were\ncarried out in the United Kingdom, indicate that adverse\nmaterial circumstances may induce people to smoke,\nand hinder stopping smoking[43]. Smoking and other\nbehavioural risk factors such as excessive alcohol con-\nsumption may be considered as a way of coping with\nadverse circumstances.\nIn conclusion, our international comparison shows\nthat (1) in most of the countries included in our study,\nsocioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease\nmortality are a major challenge to public health, and in\nthe few countries where they are not, they may well\nbecome so in the future; (2) these inequalities are partly\nbased on inequalities in behavioural risk factors, and\ndeveloping methods to improve health-related behav-\niour in the lower socioeconomic groups should be a\npriority in cardiovascular disease prevention.\nThis study was supported by a grant from the European Union's\nall participating countries gave permission for the use of unpub-\nlished data from national mortality registries.
