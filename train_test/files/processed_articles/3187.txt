Introduction\nIt is well known that there is evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity in the residuals of many estimated\ndynamic regression models in \u00denance and in macroeconomics. This evidence is particularly strong for\nregressions involving monthly, weekly and daily data. Standard residual-based bootstrap methods of\ninference for autoregressions treat the error term as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and\nare invalidated by conditional heteroskedasticity. In this paper, we analyze two main proposals for\ndealing with conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form in autoregressions.\nThe \u00derst proposal is very easy to implement and involves an application of the wild bootstrap\n(WB) to the residuals of the dynamic regression model. The WB method allows for regression errors\nthat follow martingale difference sequences (m.d.s.) with possible conditional heteroskedasticity. We\ninvestigate both the \u00dexed-design and the recursive-design implementation of the WB for autoregressions.\nWe prove their \u00derst-order asymptotic validity for the autoregressive parameters (and smooth functions\nthereof) under fairly general conditions including, for example, many stationary ARCH, GARCH and\nstochastic volatility error processes.\nThere are several fundamental differences between this paper and earlier work on the WB in re-\ngression models. First, existing theoretical work has largely focused on the classical linear regression\nmodel (see Davidson and Flachaire 2000). Second, Davidson and Flachaire (2000) establish the validity\nof the WB in the presence of unconditional heteroskedasticity in cross-sections, whereas we focus on\nconditional heteroskedasticity in time series. Third, much of the earlier work has focused on boot-\nstrapping models restricted under the null hypothesis of a test, whereas we focus on the construction of\nbootstrap con\u00dedence intervals from unrestricted regression models (see Davidson and Flachaire 2000,\nThe work most closely related to ours is Kreiss (1997). Kreiss established the asymptotic validity\nof a \u00dexed-design WB for stationary autoregressions with known \u00denite lag order when the error term\nexhibits a speci\u00dec form of conditional heteroskedasticity. We provide a generalization of this result to\nm.d.s. errors with possible conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Our results cover as special\ncases the N-GARCH, t-GARCH and asymmetric GARCH models, as well as stochastic volatility models.\nKreiss (1997) also proposed a recursive-design WB, under the name of \"modi\u00deed wild bootstrap\", but he\ndid not establish the consistency of this bootstrap proposal for autoregressive processes with conditional\nheteroskedasticity. We prove the \u00derst-order asymptotic validity of the recursive-design WB for \u00denite-\norder autoregressions with m.d.s. errors subject to possible conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown\nform. The proof holds under slightly stronger assumptions than the proof for the \u00dexed-design WB.\nTentative simulation evidence shows that the recursive-design WB scheme works well in small sam-\nples for a wide range of models of conditional heteroskedasticity. In contrast, conventional residual-\nbased resampling schemes based on the i.i.d. assumption may be very inaccurate in the presence of\nconditional heteroskedasticity. Moreover, the recursive-design WB method works equally well in the\ni.i.d. error case. The recursive-design WB method is typically more accurate in small samples than\nthe \u00dexed-design WB method. It also tends to be more accurate than the Gaussian large-sample\napproximation based on robust standard errors.\nThe second proposal for dealing with conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form involves the\npairwise resampling of the observations. This method was originally suggested by Freedman (1981) for\ncross-sectional models. We establish the asymptotic validity of this method in the autoregressive context\nand compare its performance to that of the \u00dexed-design and of the recursive-design WB. The pairwise\nbootstrap is less efficient than the residual-based WB, but - like the \u00dexed-design WB - it remains valid\nfor a broader range of GARCH processes than the recursive-design WB, including EGARCH, AGARCH\nand GJR-GARCH processes, which have been proposed speci\u00decally to capture asymmetric responses\nto shocks in asset returns (see, e.g., Engle and Ng (1993) for a review). We \u00dend in Monte Carlo\nsimulations that the pairwise bootstrap is typically more accurate than the \u00dexed-design WB method,\nbut in small samples tends to be somewhat less accurate than the recursive-design WB when the data\nare persistent. For large samples these differences vanish, and the pairwise bootstrap is as accurate as\nthe recursive-design WB.\nThe theoretical and simulation results in this paper suggest that no single method of dealing with\nconditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form will be optimal in all cases. We conclude that the\nrecursive-design WB should replace conventional recursive-design i.i.d. bootstrap methods in many\nstandard applications in empirical macroeconomics. This method performs equally well, whether the\nerror term is i.i.d. or conditionally heteroskedastic, but it lacks a theoretical justi\u00decation for some forms\nof GARCH that have \u00degured prominently in the literature on high-frequency returns. When sample\nsizes are at least moderately large and the possibility of asymmetric forms of GARCH is a practical\nconcern, the pairwise bootstrap provides a suitable alternative.\nA third proposal for dealing with conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form is the resampling of\nblocks of autoregressive residuals (see, e.g., Berkowitz, Birgean and Kilian 2000). No formal theoretical\nresults exist that would justify such a bootstrap proposal. We do not consider this proposal for two\nreasons. First, in the context of a well-speci\u00deed parametric model this proposal involves a loss of\nefficiency relative to the WB because it allows for serial correlation in the error term in addition to\nconditional heteroskedasticity. Second, the residual-based block bootstrap requires the choice of an\nadditional tuning parameter in the form of the block size. In practice, results may be sensitive to the\nchoice of block size. Although there are data-dependent rules for block size selection, these procedures\nare very computationally intensive and little is known about their accuracy in small samples. In\ncontrast, the methods we propose are no more computationally burdensome than the standard residual-\nbased algorithm and very easy to implement.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide some empirical and theoretical motivation\nfor the use of the m.d.s. assumption in resampling and highlight the limitations of existing bootstrap\nand asymptotic methods of inference for dynamic regression models such as autoregressions. In section\n3 we describe the bootstrap algorithms and state our main theoretical results. Details of the proofs\nare relegated to the appendix. In section 4, we provide some tentative simulation evidence for the\nsmall-sample performance of alternative bootstrap proposals. We conclude in section 5.\n2. Evidence Against the Assumption of i.i.d. Errors\nStandard residual-based bootstrap methods of inference for dynamic regression models treat the error\nterm as i.i.d. The i.i.d. assumption does not follow naturally from economic models. Nevertheless, in\nmany cases it has proved convenient for theoretical purposes to treat the error term of dynamic regression\nmodels as i.i.d. This would be of little concern if actual data were well represented by models with\ni.i.d. errors. Unfortunately, this is not the case in many empirical studies. Two illustrative examples\nare asset return regressions in empirical \u00denance and autoregressions in empirical macroeconomics.\nDating back to work by Fama and French (1988), there has been great interest in testing the null\nhypothesis of uncorrelated stock returns. It is common to use nonparametric bootstrap tests of this\nhypothesis that impose the much stronger assumption of i.i.d. returns (see, e.g., Goetzmann and Jorion\n1993). Figure 1a shows clear evidence of volatility clustering in monthly value-weighted CRSP returns\ntest of the null of conditional homoskedasticity in Table 1 (see Engle 1982). A related problem arises\nin the international \u00denance literature. The random walk hypothesis due to Meese and Rogoff (1983)\nimplies that changes in exchange rates should be unpredictable. It is standard to employ bootstrap\ntests of this hypothesis. In actuality, however, these tests impose the much more stringent assumption\nat least for exchange returns at monthly or higher frequency.\nAn alternative approach in empirical \u00denance involves the use of \u00denite-sample critical values based\non \u00detted VAR models for returns and a set of additional predictors. This approach may be interpreted\nas a parametric bootstrap approach. Often, however, these VAR models ignore evidence of conditional\nheteroskedasticity in the VAR errors (see e.g., Goetzmann and Jorion 1995). In principle, we may\nmodify the bootstrap approach by postulating a parametric model of conditional heteroskedasticity.\nFor example, Hodrick (1992) and Bekaert and Hodrick (2001) postulate a VAR model with condition-\nally Gaussian GARCH(1,1) errors. Similarly, Lamoureux and Lastrapes (1990) augment the return\nregression by a parametric GARCH(1,1) model. This approach is unlikely to solve the problem. Even\nin the unlikely case that we could agree that the class of GARCH models is appropriate for a given\ndata set, in practice the precise form of the GARCH model will be unknown and different speci\u00decations\nmay yield different results (see Wolf 2000). The same holds for the class of stochastic volatility models.\nThis fact points to the need for a nonparametric treatment of conditional heteroskedasticity in dynamic\nregression models.\nThis need is reinforced by the fact that it is exceedingly difficult to obtain reliable numerical estimates\nof multivariate GARCH models. In practice, researchers often impose additional ad hoc restrictions on\nthe covariance structure of the model (see, e.g., Bollerslev, Engle and Wooldridge 1988, Bollerslev 1990,\nBekaert et. al. 1997). These restrictions have no theoretical justi\u00decation (also see Ledoit, Santa-Clara\nand Wolf 2001). Finally, we note that even with such restrictions it seems next to impossible to model\nconditional heteroskedasticity in high-dimensional VAR models unless the sample size is very large.\nThis problem is most apparent in macroeconomic applications with many variables.\nWhereas the failure of the i.i.d. assumption is well-documented in empirical \u00denance, it is less well\nknown that many monthly macroeconomic variables also exhibit strong conditional heteroskedasticity.\nThe workhorse model of empirical macroeconomics is the linear autoregression. Figure 2 plots the\nsquared residuals of six univariate monthly autoregressive models (for the growth rate of industrial\noutput, M1 growth, CPI in\u00dfation, the real 3-month T-Bill rate, the nominal Federal Funds rate and the\npercent change in the price of oil). The data source is FRED, the sample period 1959.1-2001.8, and the\nlag orders of the AR models have been selected by the AIC. Figure 2 shows strong evidence of departures\nfrom conditional homoskedasticity. Formal LM tests of the null hypothesis of no ARCH in Table 1 also\nprovide overwhelming evidence against the i.i.d. assumption. The evidence in Table 1 is important\nbecause many methods of inference developed for smooth functions of autoregressive parameters (such\nas impulse responses) do not allow for conditional heteroskedasticity. For example, standard residual-\nbased bootstrap methods for autoregressions rely on the i.i.d. error assumption and are invalid in the\npresence of conditional heteroskedasticity, as we will show in the next section. Similarly, the grid\nbootstrap of Hansen (1999) is based on the assumption of an autoregression with i.i.d. errors.\nIt may seem that standard asymptotic methods would be less restrictive, but this is not necessarily\nthe case. For example, the closed-form solutions for the asymptotic normal approximation proposed by\nL\u00fctkepohl (1990) also rely on the assumption of conditional homoskedasticity. They are based on least-\nsquares estimates of the variance of the estimator that are inconsistent in the presence of conditional\nheteroskedasticity. Similarly, Wright's (2000) local-to-unity intervals for AR(p) impulse responses rely\non the assumption of i.i.d. innovations. Although these methods could presumably be modi\u00deed to allow\nfor conditional heteroskedasticity, current implementations of these methods are invalid in the presence\nof conditional heteroskedasticity. Other papers make the even stronger assumption of Gaussian i.i.d.\ntwo papers provide some simulation evidence that their method is fairly robust to non-Gaussian i.i.d.\ninnovations, they do not consider conditionally heteroskedastic errors. Finally, although this paper\ndoes not cover the Bayesian approach, it should be noted that the popular Bayesian Monte Carlo\nintegration method for forming Bayesian error bands for VAR impulse responses also assumes that the\nIn this paper we study several easy-to-implement bootstrap methods that allow inference in autore-\ngressions with possible conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Unlike the standard residual-\nbased bootstrap for models with i.i.d. innovations these bootstrap methods remain valid under the\nmuch weaker assumption of m.d.s. innovations, and they do not require the researcher to take a stand\non the existence or speci\u00dec form of conditional heteroskedasticity. For expository purposes we focus on\nunivariate autoregressive models. Analogous results for the multivariate case are possible at the cost\nof additional notation.\nLet (, F, P) be a probability space and {Ft} a sequence of increasing -\u00deelds of F. The sequence of\nmartingale differences {t, t  Z} is de\u00dened on (, F, P), where each t is assumed to be measurable\nwith respect to Ft. We observe a sample of data {y-p+1, . . . , y0, y1, . . . , yn} from the following data\ngenerating process for the time series yt,\nL2 - . . . - p\nLp, p\n6= 0, is assumed to have all roots outside the unit circle.\n =\n\u00a1\n, . . . , p\n\u00a20 is the parameter of interest, which we estimate by ordinary least squares (OLS) using\nobservations 1 through n:\n^\nn\n=\n\u00c3\nn\nX\nn\nX\nwhere Yt-1 = (yt-1, . . . , yt-p)0. In this paper we focus on bootstrap con\u00dedence intervals for  that are\nrobust to the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form in the innovations {t}. More\nspeci\u00decally, we assume the following condition:\nAssumption A\n(i) E (t|Ft-1) = 0, almost surely, where Ft-1 =  (t-1, t-2, . . .) is the -\u00deeld generated by {t-1, t-2, . . .} .\n(ii) E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n(iii) limn n-1\nP\nn\nE\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n= 2 > 0 in probability.\n(iv) E\n\u00a1\nt\nt-rt-s\n\u00a2\n= 4r,s is uniformly bounded for all t, r  1, s  1; r,r > for some > 0 for all\nr.\n(v) limn n-1\nP\nn\nt-rt-sE\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n= 4r,s in probability for any r  1, s  1.\n(vi) E |t|4r is uniformly bounded, for some r > 1.\nAssumption A replaces the usual i.i.d. assumption on the errors {t} by the broader martingale\ndifference sequence assumption. In particular, Assumption A does not impose conditional homoskedas-\nticity on the sequence {t}, which need not be strictly stationary (although it is covariance station-\nary). Assumption A covers a variety of conditionally heteroskedastic models such as ARCH, GARCH,\nEGARCH and stochastic volatility models (see, e.g. Deo (2000), who shows that a stronger version\nof Assumption A is satis\u00deed for stochastic volatility and GARCH models). Assumptions (iv) and (v)\nrestrict the fourth order cumulants of t.\nThe following theorem gives the asymptotic distribution of the OLS estimator ^\nn\nfor the parameter\nvector  under the martingale difference sequence Assumption A. This result could be obtained as a\nspecial case of Kuersteiner's (2001) Theorem 3.4, which gives the asymptotic distribution of efficient\ninstrumental variables estimators in the context of ARMA models with martingale difference sequence\nerrors. In particular, in addition to the martingale difference sequence assumption, his Assumption\nA1 assumes {t} to be stationary ergodic, and it imposes a summability condition on the fourth order\ncumulants. Here, we use Assumption A, which relaxes the stationarity and ergodicity assumptions\nand the summability condition. We use Kuersteiner's (2001) notation to characterize the asymptotic\ncovariance matrix of ^\nn\n. Using -1 (L) =\nP\n\nj\nLj, we let bj =\n\u00a1\n, . . . , j-p\nj\n= 0 for j < 0. The coefficients j\nsatisfy the recursion s\n- . . . - p\ns-p\n= 1. We let  denote convergence in distribution throughout.\nTheorem 3.1.

Under conditional homoskedastic-\nity, we obtain simpli\u00deed expressions for A and B. In particular, by application of the law of iterated\nexpectations, we have that i,i  -4E\n\u00a1\nt\nt-i\n\u00a2\n\u00a1\nt-i\nE\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\u00a2\n\u00a1\nt-i\n\u00a2\n= 1 for all\ni = 1, 2, . . . . Similarly, we can show that i,j = 0 for all i 6= j. Thus, for instance in the AR(1) case,\nthe asymptotic variance of ^\nn\n= ^\nsimpli\u00dees to C =\n\u00a1\nP\n\ni\n\u00a1\nP\n\ni\n\u00a2\n.\nThe validity of any bootstrap method in the context of autoregressions with conditional het-\neroskedasticity depends crucially on the ability of the bootstrap to estimate consistently the asymptotic\ncovariance matrix C. The standard residual-based bootstrap method fails to do so by not correctly\nmimicking the behavior of the fourth order cumulants of t in the conditionally heteroskedastic case,\nas we now show. Let ^\n\nt\nbe resampled with replacement from the centered residuals. The standard\nresidual-based bootstrap builds y\nt\nrecursively from ^\n\nt\naccording to\ny\nt\n^\nn\n+ ^\n\nt\n, t = 1, . . . , n,\nwhere Y \n=\n\u00a1\ny\n, . . . , y\nt-p\n\u00a20, given some initial conditions. The bootstrap analogues of A and B are\nA\nn\nP\nn\nE\n\u00a1\nY \n\u00a2\nand B\nn\n= V ar\n\u00a1\nP\nn\nY \n^\n\nt\n\u00a2\n, respectively. Because ^\n\nt\nis i.i.d.\n\u00a1\n\u00a2\n, where ^\nP\nn\n\u00a1\n^\nt - ^\n\n, ^\n\nt\nand Y \nare (conditionally) independent, and\nB\nn\nn\nX\nE\n\u00a1\nY \n^\nt\n\u00a2\nn\nX\nE\n\u00a1\nY \n\u00a2\nE\n\u00a1\n^\nt\n\u00a2\n= ^\nn\n.\nThus, the bootstrap analogue of C, C\nn\nn\nB\nn\nn\n= ^\nn\n, converges in probability to 2A-1,\nimplying that the limiting distribution of the recursive i.i.d. bootstrap is N\n\u00a1\n\u00a2\nabove shows, 2A-1 is not the correct asymptotic covariance matrix of ^\nn\nwithout further conditions,\ne.g., that t is conditionally homoskedastic. In the general conditionally heteroskedastic case, B depends\non 4i,j. The recursive i.i.d. bootstrap implies E\n\u00a1\n^\n\nt-i\n^\n\nt-j\n^\nt\n\u00a2\n= ^\n4 when i = j and zero otherwise,\nand thus implicitly sets i,j = 1 for i = j and 0 for i 6= j.\nGiven the failure of the standard-residual based bootstrap, we are interested in establishing the\n\u00derst-order asymptotic validity of three alternative bootstrap methods in this environment. Two of\nthe bootstrap methods we study rely on an application of the wild bootstrap (WB). The WB has\nregression models with (unconditionally) heteroskedastic errors. We consider both a recursive-design\nand a \u00dexed-design version of the WB. The third method is a natural generalization of the pairwise\nbootstrap for linear regression \u00derst suggested by Freedman (1981) for cross sectional data.\nAs we will see next, the recursive-design WB requires a strengthening of Assumption A in order to\nensure convergence towards the correct asymptotic covariance matrix C. In contrast, the \u00dexed-design\nWB and the pairwise bootstrap are valid under the more general Assumption A.\nRecursive-design wild bootstrap\nThe recursive-design WB is a simple modi\u00decation of the usual recursive-design bootstrap method\nfor autoregressions (see e.g. Bose, 1988) which consists of replacing Efron's i.i.d. bootstrap by the wild\nbootstrap when bootstrapping the errors of the AR model. More speci\u00decally, the recursive-design WB\nbootstrap generates a pseudo time series {y\nt\n} according to the autoregressive process:\ny\nt\n= ^\ny\n+ ^\ny\n+ . . . + ^\npn\ny\nt-p\n+ ^\n\nt\n, t = 1, . . . , n,\nwhere ^\n\nt\n= ^\ntt\n, with ^\nt = ^\nn\n(L) yt, and where t\nis an i.i.d. sequence with mean zero and variance one\nsuch that E |t\n|4   < . We let y\nt\n= 0 for all t  0. Kreiss (1997) suggested this method in the\ncontext of autoregressive models with i.i.d. errors, but did not investigate its theoretical justi\u00decation\nin more general models. Here, we will provide conditions for the asymptotic validity of the recursive-\ndesign WB proposal for \u00denite-order autoregressive processes with possibly conditionally heteroskedastic\nerrors. To show this result we need to strengthen Assumption A as follows:\nAssumption A0\n\u00a1\nt\nt-rt-s\n\u00a2\n= 0 for all r 6= s, for all t, r  1, s  1.\n(vi0) E |t|4r is uniformly bounded for some r  2 and for all t.\nAssumption A0 restricts the class of conditionally heteroskedastic autoregressive models in two di-\nmensions. First, Assumption A0 (iv0) requires the product moments of {t} up to order four to behave as\nthose of an independent series. Milh\u00f8j (1985) shows that this assumption is satis\u00deed for the ARCH(p)\nmodel with innovations having a symmetric distribution. Bollerslev(1986) and He and Ter\u00e4svirta (1999)\nextend the argument to the GARCH(p, q) case. In addition, Deo (2000) shows that this assumption\nis satis\u00deed by certain stochastic volatility models. Nevertheless, Assumption A0 (iv0) excludes some\nnon-symmetric parametric models such as asymmetric EGARCH. Second, we now require the existence\nof at least eight moments for the martingale difference sequence {t} as opposed to only 4r moments, for\nsome r > 1, as in Assumption A. A similar moment condition was used by Kreiss (1997) in his Theorem\n4.3, which shows the validity of the recursive-design WB for possibly in\u00denite-order AR processes with\ni.i.d. innovations.\nThe strengthening of Assumption A is crucial to showing the asymptotic validity of the recursive-\ndesign WB in the martingale difference context. In particular, conditional on the data, and given the\nindependence of {t\n},\n\u00a9\nY \n^\n\nt\n, F\nt\n\u00aa\ncan be shown to be a vector m.d.s., where F\nt\n= \n\u00a1\nt\n, . . . , 1\n\u00a2\n.\nWe use Assumption A0 (vi0) to ensure convergence of n-1\nP\nn\nY \n^\nt\nto B\nn\n V ar\n\u00a1\nP\nn\nY \n\nt\n\u00a2\n,\nthus verifying one of the conditions of the CLT for m.d.s.

The \u00dexed-design WB was suggested by Kreiss\n(1997). Kreiss' (1997) Theorem 4.2 provides the \u00derst-order asymptotic validity of the \u00dexed-design WB\nfor \u00denite-order autoregressions with conditional heteroskedasticity of a speci\u00dec form. More speci\u00decally,\nhe assumes a data generating process of the form yt =\nP\np\ni\nyt-i +  (yt-1) vt, where vt is i.i.d. (0, 1)\nwith \u00denite fourth moment. The i.i.d. assumption on the rescaled innovations vt is violated if for instance\nthe conditional moments of vt depend on past observations. We prove the \u00derst-order asymptotic validity\nof the \u00dexed-design WB of Kreiss (1997) under a broader set of regularity conditions, namely Assumption\nA.\nTheorem 3.3.

This method is an extension of Freedman's (1981) bootstrap method\nfor the correlation model to the autoregressive context. In the AR(p) model, it amounts to re-\nsampling with replacement from the set of tuples\n\u00a1\n\u00a2\n= (yt, yt-1, . . . , yt-p), t = 1, . . . , n.

Simulation Evidence\nIn this section, we study the accuracy of the bootstrap approximation proposed in section 3 for sample\nsizes of interest in applied work. We focus on the AR(1) model as the leading example of an autore-\ngressive process. The DGP is yt = 1\n {0, 0.9}. In our simulation study we allow\nfor GARCH(1,1) errors of the form t =\n\nhtvt, where vt is i.i.d. N (0, 1) and ht =  + 2\nt = 1, . . . , n. We normalize the unconditional variance of t to one. In addition to conditional N(0,1)\ninnovations we also consider GARCH models with conditional t5-errors (suitably normalized to have\nunit variance). For  = 0 this model reduces to an ARCH(1) model. For  = 0 and  = 0 the\nerror sequence reduces to a sequence of (possibly non-Gaussian) i.i.d errors. We allow for varying\ndegrees of volatility persistence modeled as GARCH processes with  +   {0, 0.9, 0.99}. In addition,\nwe consider AR(1) models with exponential GARCH errors (EGARCH), asymmetric GARCH errors\n(AGARCH) and with the GJR-GARCH errors proposed by Glosten, Jaganathan and Runkle (1993).\nOur parameter settings are based on Engle and Ng (1993). Note that many of these processes are not\ncovered by either the conventional asymptotic theory or by the asymptotic theory for the bootstrap.\nIn particular, the assumption of a \u00denite fourth moment may be violated for some parameter settings.\nNevertheless, it is important to investigate the robustness of these methods to such departures from\nour assumptions.\nFinally, we also consider the stochastic volatility model t = vt exp(ht) with ht = ht-1 + 0.5ut,\nwhere || < 1 and (ut, vt) is a sequence of independent bivariate normal random variables with zero\nmean and covariance matrix diag(2\nu\n, 1). This model is a m.d.s. model and satis\u00dees Assumption A.\nvalues obtained by Shephard (1996) by \u00detting this stochastic volatility model to real exchange rate\ndata.\nWe generate repeated trials of length n = 120 and n = 240 from these processes and conduct\nbootstrap inference based on the \u00detted AR(1) model for each trial. All \u00detted models include an\nintercept. The number of Monte Carlo trials is 1,000 with 1,000 bootstrap replications each. The \u00dexed-\ndesign and recursive-design WB involve applying the WB to the residuals of the \u00detted model. Recall\nthat the WB innovation is \nt\n= ^\ntt\n, with ^\nt = yt - ^\nyt-1, where t\nis an i.i.d. sequence with mean\nzero and variance one such that E |t\n|4r   < . In practice, there are several choices for t\nthat\nsatisfy these conditions. In the simulations we use t\n N(0, 1). Our results are robust to alternative\nchoices including the two-point distribution t\n= -(\n\n\n\nt\n= (\n\n5+1)/2 with probability 1-p, as proposed by Mammen (1993), and the two-point distribution\nt\n= 1 with probability 0.5 and t\nWe are interested in studying the coverage accuracy of nominal 90% symmetric percentile-t bootstrap\ncon\u00dedence intervals for the slope parameter 1\n. We also considered equal-tailed percentile-t intervals,\nbut found that symmetric percentile-t intervals in all cases were at least as accurate. Unlike the\npercentile interval, the construction of the bootstrap t-interval requires the use of an estimate of the\nstandard error of n1/2(b\n\n\n- b\n). We use the heteroskedasticity-robust estimator of the covariance\nalso experimented with several modi\u00deed robust covariance estimators (see MacKinnon and White 1985,\nChesher and Jewitt 1987, Davidson and Flachaire 2000). For our sample sizes, none of these estimators\nperformed better than the basic estimator proposed by Nicholls and Pagan (1983). Finally, virtually\nidentical results were obtained based on WB bootstrap standard error estimates. The latter approach\ninvolves a nested bootstrap loop and is not recommended for computational reasons. As a benchmark\nwe also include the coverage rates of the Gaussian large-sample approximation based on Nicholls-Pagan\nrobust standard errors.\nWe begin with a review of the simulation results for the stationary AR(1) model. Starting with\nthe results for N-GARCH errors in Table 2 several broad tendencies emerge. First, the accuracy of the\nstandard recursive-design bootstrap procedure based on i.i.d. resampling of residuals is high when the\nmodel errors are truly i.i.d., but can be very poor in the presence of N-GARCH. Second, conventional\nlarge-sample approximations based on robust standard errors are more accurate than the recursive-\ndesign i.i.d. bootstrap in the presence of N-GARCH, but less accurate for models with i.i.d. errors.\nIn either case, their coverage rates may be substantially below the nominal level. Third, all three\nrobust bootstrap methods are more accurate than the i.i.d. bootstrap or the conventional Gaussian\napproximation. Fourth, the recursive-design WB is always at least as accurate as the \u00dexed-design\nWB and the pairwise resampling procedures, and its accuracy is very high for all variations of the\nDGP, including models with i.i.d. innovations. Speci\u00decally, for n = 120 and AR(1) models with high\npersistence, the accuracy of the recursive-design WB tends to be higher than for the pairwise bootstrap.\nFor n = 240, these differences vanish and both methods are equally accurate. The \u00dexed-design WB is\ntypically less accurate than the recursive-design WB both for n = 120 and for n = 240, although the\ndiscrepancies diminish with the larger sample size.\nThe results for the AR(1) model with t5-GARCH errors in Table 3 are qualitatively similar, except\nthat the recursive-design i.i.d. bootstrap and the conventional Gaussian approximation are even less\naccurate than for N-GARCH processes. In Table 4 we explore a number of additional models of\nconditional heteroskedasticity that have been used primarily to model returns in empirical \u00denance. The\nresults for the stochastic volatility model are qualitatively the same as for N-GARCH and t-GARCH.\nFor the other three models, we \u00dend that there is little to choose between the recursive-design WB and\nthe pairwise bootstrap. Their accuracy for n = 120 and highly persistent data tends to be slightly below\nnominal coverage, but consistently higher than that of any alternative method. In all other cases both\nmethods are highly accurate. Neither the i.i.d. bootstrap nor the conventional Gaussian approximation\nperform well. The high accuracy of the recursive-design WB even for EGARCH, AGARCH and GJR-\nGARCH error processes is surprising, given its lack of theoretical support for these DGPs. Apparently,\nthe asymptotic inconsistency of the recursive-design WB method has little effect on its performance in\nsmall samples. Fortunately, applications in \u00denance, for which such asymmetric volatility models have\nbeen developed, invariably involve large sample sizes, conditions under which pairwise resampling is\njust as accurate as the recursive-design WB and theoretically justi\u00deed.\nGiven the computational costs of the simulation study, we have chosen to focus on a stylized autore-\ngressive model, but have explored a wide range of conditionally heteroskedastic errors. Although our\nsimulation results are necessarily tentative, they suggest that the recursive-design WB should replace\nconventional recursive design i.i.d. bootstrap methods in many standard applications. The pairwise\nbootstrap provides a suitable alternative when sample sizes are at least moderately large and the pos-\nsibility of asymmetric forms of GARCH is a practical concern. Even for moderate sample sizes the\naccuracy of the pairwise bootstrap is slightly higher than that of the \u00dexed-design bootstrap, which\nappears only suited for very large samples.\n5. Concluding Remarks\nThe aim of the paper has been to extend the range of applications of autoregressive bootstrap methods\nin empirical \u00denance and macroeconometrics. We documented widespread evidence of conditional\nheteroskedasticity not just in \u00denancial time series, but also in monthly macroeconomic data. We\nanalyzed the theoretical properties of three bootstrap procedures for stationary autoregressions that\nare robust to conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form: the \u00dexed-design WB, the recursive-design\nWB and the pairwise bootstrap.\nThroughout the paper, we established conditions for the \u00derst-order asymptotic validity of these\nbootstrap procedures. We did not attempt to address the issue of the existence of higher-order asymp-\ntotic re\u00denements provided by the bootstrap approximation. Arguments aimed at proving asymptotic\nre\u00denements require the existence of an Edgeworth expansion for the distribution of the estimator of\ninterest. Establishing the existence of such an Edgeworth expansion is beyond the scope of this paper.\nMoreover, the quality of the \u00denite-sample approximation provided by analytic Edgeworth expansions\noften is poor and less accurate than bootstrap approximations. Thus, Edgeworth expansions in general\nare imperfect guides to the relative accuracy of alternative bootstrap methods (see H\u00e4rdle, Horowitz\nand Kreiss 2001). Indeed, preliminary simulation evidence indicates that wild bootstrap methods based\non two-point distributions that may yield asymptotic re\u00denements in our context tend to perform no\nbetter than - and in some cases worse than - the \u00derst-order accurate methods studied in this paper.\nNevertheless, we found that the robust bootstrap approximation was typically more accurate in small\nsamples than the usual \u00derst-order asymptotic approximation based on robust standard errors. Our\nsimulation results also highlighted the dangers of incorrectly modelling the error term in dynamic re-\ngression models as i.i.d. We found that conventional residual-based bootstrap methods may be very\ninaccurate in the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity.\nThe theoretical and simulation results in this paper suggested that no single bootstrap method for\ndealing with conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form will be optimal in all cases. We concluded\nthat the recursive-design WB is well-suited for many applications in empirical macroeconomics. This\nmethod performs equally well, whether the error term is i.i.d. or conditionally heteroskedastic, but it\nlacks a theoretical justi\u00decation for some forms of GARCH that have \u00degured prominently in the literature\non high-frequency returns. When the sample size is at least moderately large and asymmetric forms of\nGARCH are a practical concern, the pairwise bootstrap method provides a suitable alternative . The\n\u00dexed-design WB has the same theoretical justi\u00decation as the pairwise bootstrap for parametric models,\nbut based on our simulation evidence appears only suited for very large samples.\nThere are several interesting extensions of the approach taken in this paper. One possible extension\nis the development of bootstrap methods for conditionally heteroskedastic stationary autoregressions\nof possibly in\u00denite order. This extension is the subject of ongoing research. Another useful extension\nwould be to establish the validity of the recursive-design WB for regression parameters in I(1) autore-\ngressions that can be written in terms of zero mean stationary regressors, generalizing recent work by\nInoue and Kilian (2002) on I(1) autoregressive models with i.i.d. errors. Yet another useful extension\nwould be to establish the asymptotic validity of robust versions of the grid bootstrap of Hansen (1999).\nThese extensions are nontrivial and left for future research.\nTable 1.

Given the previous results, it suffices to show that ^\nC\nn\nP\n C, i.e. (i) ^\nA\nn\nP\n A,\nand (ii) ^\nB\nn\nP\n B, in probability, where B = ~\nB for the recursive-design WB. We showed (i) in Lemma\nA.4 for the recursive-design WB, and in Theorems 3.3 and 3.4, for the \u00dexed-design WB and pairwise\nbootstrap, respectively. Next, we sketch the proof of (ii). For simplicity we take p = 1. The proof for\ngeneral p is similar. For each of the three bootstrap schemes, we can write e\n\nt\n= ^\n\nt\n-\n^\n\nn\n- ^\nn\n\u00b4\ny\n,\nwhere ^\n\nt\n= ^\ntt\nfor the recursive-design and \u00dexed-design WB, and ^\n\nt\n= y\nt\n- ^\nn\ny\nfor the pairwise\nbootstrap. Thus,\n^\nB\nn\n= ^\nB\n+ ^\nB\n+ ^\nB\n, with\n^\nB\nn\nX\n^\nt\n, ^\nB\nn\nX\n^\n\nt\n^\n\nn\n- ^\nn\n\u00b4\n, and ^\nB\nn\nX\n^\n\nn\n- ^\nn\n.\nIt is enough to show that with probability approaching one, (a) ^\nB\nP\n B, (b) ^\nB\nP\n(c) ^\nB\nP\n 0. For the \u00dexed-design WB, starting with (a), note that y\n= yt-1, and therefore\n^\nB\nP\nn\n^\nt\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\nP\nn\n^\nt\n. Under our assump-\nP\n 0. Since ^\nt = t -\n^\nn\n- \n\u00b4\nyt-1, we can write 1n\nP\nn\nt\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n-\n^\nn\n- \n\u00b4\nP\nn\nt\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n+\n^\nn\n- \nP\nn\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n. We can show that each of\nthese terms is oP (1), in probability. For the \u00derst term, write zt = y2\nt\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n, and note that\nzt is (conditionally) a m.d.s. with respect to Ft\n\n=  (t\n, . . . , 1\nfollows that n-1\nP\nn\nzt\nP\n 0, in probability, provided that E |zt|r = OP (1), or E (E |zt|r) = O (1),\nfor some r > 1, which holds under our moment conditions (in particular, the existence of 4r mo-\nments of t suffices). A similar argument applies to the last two terms of 1n\n, where we note that\n^\nn\n-  P\n 0. For (b), and given ^\n\nn\n- ^\nn\n= oP (1), it suffices that n-1\nP\nn\n^\n\nt\n= OP (1), in\nprobability, or that E\n\u00af\nP\nn\n^\n\nt\n\u00af\n\u00af = OP (1). This condition holds under Assumption A (\u00derst\napply the triangle inequality, then use the de\u00denition of ^\nt, and \u00denally apply repeatedly the Cauchy-\nSchwartz inequality to the sums involving products of yt-1 and/or t.) For (c), by a reasoning similar\nto (b), it suffices that n-1\nP\nn\n= OP (1), which holds under our moment conditions. For the\npairwise bootstrap, we proceed similarly, but rely on the (conditional) independence of\n\u00a1\ny\nt\n, y\n\u00a2\nto\nobtain the results. In particular, for (a), following Theorem 3.3 we can de\u00dene ^\n\nt\n= \nt\n-\n^\nn\n- \n\u00b4\ny\n,\nwith \nt\n= y\nt\n- y\n, which implies ^\nB\n. We can show that 2n\n= oP\n(1), whereas\nP\nn\nz\n+ n\nwhere z\nP\nn\nt\nand n\nP\nn\nt\n. By Theo-\nP\n B. Since z\nis a uniformly square-integrable m.d.s. (conditional on the original data)\nAndrews' LLN implies that the \u00derst term of 1n\nis oP (1), in probability. For the recursive-design WB,\nfor part (a), note that we can write ^\nB\n, where 1n\n=\nP\n^\nj\nP\nn\n^\nt-j\n^\nt\n\u00b4\n, and\nP\nn\nP\nbj\n^\nbi^\n\nt-i\n^\n\nt-j\n^\nt\n. Now, using arguments analogous to those used in the proof\nof Lemmas A.4 and A.5 we can show that 1n\nP\n ~\nP\n 0, in probability. Similar arguments\napply for (b) and (c).\nProof of Lemma A.1. The proof follows closely that of Lemma A.1 of Kuersteiner (2001). We\nreproduce his steps under our weaker Assumption A. In particular, we show that for all   Rm such\nP\nn\n\u00a1\n\u00a2\n, where Yt = (tt-1, . . . , tt-m)0. Noting that\n{Yt, Ft} is a vector m.d.s., we check the m.d.s. CLT conditions (cf. Davidson, 1994, Theorem 24.3).\nLet Zt = 0Yt. We check: (i) n-1\nP\nn\n\u00a3\nt\n- E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\u00a4 P\n 0, where E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\nt\n 0. To see (i), note that n-1\nP\nn\n\u00a3\nt\n- E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\u00a4\nn\nX\n\u00a3\nt\n- E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\u00a4\nn\nX\n\u00a3\nE\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n- E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\u00a4\n.\nFirst consider A1. Since {Zt, Ft-1} is a m.d.s we have that Z2\nt\n-E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\nis an L1-mixingale with\nmixingale constants ct = E\n\u00af\nt\n- E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\u00af\n\u00af: E\n\u00af\n\u00afE\n\u00a1\nt\n- E\n\u00a1\nt\n\u00a2\n|Ft-k\n\u00a2\u00af\n\u00af  ctk\nwith k\n= 0 otherwise. Thus, we apply Andrews' LLN for L1-mixingales (Andrews,\nP\n 0. It suffices that for some r > 1 E\n\u00af\nt\n\u00af\n\u00afr  K <  and n-1\nP\nn\nct < .

For (ii), by a similar reasoning, it suffices to note that\nE\n\n\n\nn\nX\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n\n\n\nn\nX\n^\nt-j\n^\nt\nE\n\u00a1\nt\nt-j\n\u00a2\nn\nX\n^\nt-j\n^\nt\n= oP (1) .\nFor (iii), note that\nn\nX\nt=max(i,j)+1\n^\nt\n^\n\nt-i\n^\n\nt-j\nn\nX\nt=max(i,j)+1\n^\nt\n^\nt-i^\nt-j\n\u00a1\nt\nt-i\nt-j\n- 1 (i = j)\n\u00a2\nn\nX\nt=max(i,j)+1\n\u00a1\n^\nt\n^\nt-i^\n\u00a2\n1 (i = j)  G\nUnder our assumptions, for any \u00dexed i, j,\nn\nX\nt=max(i,j)+1\n^\nt\n^\nt-i^\nn\nX\nt=max(i,j)+1\nt\nt-it-j + Rn,\nwhere the remainder Rn involves products of elements of ^\nn\n-, which are oP (1) under our assumptions,\nwith averages of products of elements of Yt-1 and t, up to the fourth order, which are bounded in\nprobability, given that E |t|4 <  < . Thus, Rn = oP (1), and since n-1\nP\nn\nt=max(i,j)+1\nt\nt-it-j \n4ij (cf. proof of Lemma A.1), it follows that G2n = oP (1). So, if we let z(i,j)\nt\n= ^\nt\n^\n\nt-i\n^\n\nt-j\n-1 (i = j),\nit suffices that\nP (|G\n| > ) \nE\n\n\nn\nX\nt=max(i,j)+1\nn\nX\ns=max(i,j)+1\nE\nz(i,j)\nt\nz(i,j)\ns\n\u00b4\n\n\n=\nn\nX\nt=max(i,j)+1\n^\nt\n^\nt-i\n^\nt-j\nE\nh\u00a1\nt\nt-i\nt-j\n- 1 (i = j)\ni\n\nK\n\nn\nX\nt=max(i,j)+1\n^\nt\n^\nt-i\n^\nt-j\n\n ,\nwhere the equality holds because E\nz(i,j)\nt\nz(i,j)\ns\n\u00b4\n= 0 for s 6= t by the properties of {t\n}, and the\nsecond inequality uses the fact that E |t\n|4 <  < . Under Assumption A strengthened by A0\n(vi0), we can show that n-1\nP\nn\nt=max(i,j)+1\n^\nt\n^\nt-k\n^\nt-l\n= OP (1), which implies that P (|G\n| > ) =\noP (1). In fact, given that ^\nt = t -\n^\nn\n- \n\u00b4\nYt-1, it follows that n-1\nP\nn\nt=max(i,j)+1\n^\nt\n^\nt-i\n^\nt-j\n=\nP\nn\nt=max(i,j)+1\nt\nt-i\nt-j\n+ oP (1).

This assumption\nalso ensures that n-1\nP\nn\nt=max(i,j)+1\nt\nt-i\nt-j\n= OP (1), by repeated application of the Markov and\nCauchy-Schwartz inequalities. \u00a5\nProof of Lemma A.3.

We can write y\nt\n=\nP\n^\nj\n^\n\nt-j\n, t = 1, . . . , n, where\nn\n^\nj\no\nare de\u00dened by\n^\nj\n=\nPmin(j,p)\n^\ni\n^\n, with ^\nj\n= 0 for j < 0. It follows that Y \n=\nP\n^\nbj^\n\nt-j\n, for\nt = 2, . . . , n, where ^\nbj =\n^\n, . . . , ^\nj-p\n\u00b4\n. Note Y \n= 0, given the zero initial conditions. Hence,\nn\nX\nY \n= T\n+ T\n, with T\n=\nX\n^\nbj\n^\nj\n\nn\nX\n^\nt-j\n\n, and\nT\n=\nX\nX\n^\nbj\n^\nj+k\n+ ^\nbj+k\n^\nj\n\u00b4\n\u00c3\nn-j\nX\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n!\n.\nNext, we show: (a) T\nP\nP\n\nj\n, and (b) T\nP\n 0, in probability. To prove (a), consider\nfor \u00dexed m  N,\nT\n= Tm\n+ Rm\n, with Tm\n=\nX\n^\nbj\n^\nj\n\nn\nX\n^\nt-j\n\n , and Rm\n=\nX\nj=m\n^\nbj\n^\nj\n\nn\nX\n^\nt-j\n\n .\nBy Lemma A.2.(i), for each j = 1, . . . , m, m \u00dexed, n-1\nP\nn\n^\nt-j\nP\n 2, in probability; also, under\nAssumption A, ^\nj\nP\n j\n, implying ^\nbj\nP\n bj. Thus, by Slutsky's theorem, Tm\nP\n\nP\nj\nin probability. Since\n\u00a9\nj\n\u00aa\nare absolutely summable, it follows that Am  A as m  , by dominated\nconvergence. Thus, Tm\nP\n A, in probability. Choose   Rp arbitrarily such that 0 = 1. By BD's\nProposition 6.3.9, it now suffices to show that, for any  > 0, limm limsupn\nP\n\u00a1\u00af\n\n\u00af\n\u00af > \n\u00a2\n=\n0, in probability, or limm limsupn\nE\n\u00a1\u00af\n\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00a2\n= 0, in probability, by Markov's inequality.\nUsing the triangle inequality and the properties of {t\n}, we get\nE\n\u00a1\u00af\n\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00a2\n\nX\nj=m\n\u00af\n\u00af\nbj\n^\nj\n\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af E\n\nn\nX\n^\nt-j\n\n =\nX\nj=m\n\u00af\n\u00af\nbj\n^\nj\n\n\u00af\n\u00af\nn\nX\n^\nt-j\n.\nGiven that ^\nt = t -\n^\nn\n- \n\u00b4\nYt-1, and that ^\nn\n-  P\nP\nn\n^\nt-j\nThus, conditional on the sample, and for all n sufficiently large,\nE\n\u00a1\u00af\n\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00a2\n K\nX\nj=m\n\u00af\n\u00af\nbj\n^\nj\n\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af  K\np\nX\np\nX\n|kl|\n\nX\nj=m\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af^\nj-k\n^\nj-l\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\nUnder our assumptions,\nP\np\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af^\nj\n- j\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af = oP (1), so there exists n1 such that supnn1\nP\n\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af^\nj\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af < \nP\n\nj=m\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af^\nj-k\n^\nj-l\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af = oP (1)\nas m  , which completes the proof that T\nP\n A, in probability. Finally, to show (b), consider\n\u00derst for \u00dexed m  N, Tm\n=\nP\nP\n^\nbj\n^\nj+k\nP\nn-j\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n\u00b4\n. For \u00dexed j and k, it follows\nby Lemma A.2.(ii) that n-1\nP\nn-j\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\nP\n 0, in probability. Since ^\nbj\n^\nj+k\nP\n bjbj+k, we have that\nTm\nP\n 0, in probability. To complete the proof of (b) we need to show that each of the following\nRm\n=\nX\nX\n^\nbj\n^\nj+k\n+ ^\nbj+k\n^\nj\n\u00b4\n\u00c3\nn-j\nX\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n!\n, and\nRm\n=\nX\nX\nj=m-k\n^\nbj\n^\nj+k\n+ ^\nbj+k\n^\nj\n\u00b4\n\u00c3\nn-j\nX\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n!\n,\nsatis\u00dees the condition limm limsupn\nP\n\u00af\n\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af > \n\u00b4\n= 0 in probability, for i = 1, 2, where\n and  are as above. This can be veri\u00deed analogously to above, using in particular the fact that\nP\n\nk |k\n| < . \u00a5\nProof of Lemma A.5. As in the proof of Lemma A.4, we have Y \n=\nP\n^\nbj^\n\nt-j\n, where ^\nbj =\n^\n, . . . , ^\nj-p\n\u00b4\n, with ^\nj\n= 0 for j < 0. Let Z\nt\n= Y \n^\n\nt\n=\nP\n^\nbj^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n, for\nt = 2, . . . , n, and note that Z\n= 0. Thus,\nn\nX\nZ\nt\nn\nX\nX\n^\nbj^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n=\nX\n^\nn\nX\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n X\nn\n.\nFor \u00dexed m  N, let X\nn,m\n\nP\n^\nP\nn\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n. Next we show: (a) for m \u00dexed, X\nn,m\ndP \nN\nBm\n\u00b4\n, as n  , where ~\nBm =\nP\nm\nj\n4jj; (b) ~\nBm  ~\nB as m  , and\n(c) limm lim supn\nP\n\u00a1\u00af\n\u00afX\nn\n- X\nn,m\n\u00af\n\u00af > \n\u00a2\n= 0 for any  > 0. For (a), write\nX\nn,m\n=\nX\nn\nX\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n+\nX\n^\nbj - bj\n\u00b4\nn\nX\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n Q\n+ Q\n.\nBy Lemma A.3, under Assumption A strengthened by A(vi0), we have that for \u00dexed j n-1/2\nP\nn\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\ndP  N\n\u00a1\n\u00a2\n, where the elements of the m \u00d7 1 vector composed of these sums are asymptotically\nuncorrelated. Hence, Q\ndP  N\nBm\n\u00b4\n, in probability, where ~\nBm =\nP\nm\nj\n4jj. Next, note\nQ\nP\n 0 in probability, since ^\nbj - bj\nP\nP\nn\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n= OP (1) for each j = 1, . . . , m.\nThe asymptotic equivalence lemma now implies (a). (b) follows by dominated convergence given\nthe summability of\n\u00a9\nj\n\u00aa\nand the uniform boundedness of 4jj. To prove (c), note it suffices that\nlimm lim supn\nE\n\u00afX\nn\n- X\nn,m\n\u00af\n\u00b4\n= 0, by Chebyshev's inequality. Equivalently, we consider for\nany   Rp, such that 0 = 1,\nE\n\u00a1\nX\nn\n- X\nn,m\n\u00a2\u00af\n\u00b4\n= E\n\n\nX\nj=m\nX\ni=m\nbj\n^\ni\nZ\nnj\nZ\nni\n\n ,\nwhere Z\nnj\nP\nn\n^\n\nt-j\n^\n\nt\n. Since E\nZ\nnj\nZ\nni\n\u00b4\n= 0 for i 6= j and E\nnj\n\u00b4\nP\nn\n^\nt-j\n^\nt\n,\nit follows that\nE\n\u00a1\nX\nn\n- X\nn,m\n\u00a2\u00af\n\u00b4\n=\nX\nj=m\nbj\n^\nj\n\n\nn\nX\n^\nt-j\n^\nt\n\n .\nUsing the de\u00denition of ^\nt, i.e. ^\nt = tt\n-\n^\nn\n- \n\u00b4\nYt-1, and the fact that ^\nn\n-  P\n 0, we can show\nP\nn\n^\nt-j\n^\nt\nP\nn\nt-j\nt\n+ oP (1). This implies n-1\nP\nn\n^\nt-j\n^\nt\n= OP (1), given that\nP\nn\nt-j\nt\nP\n 4jj, and 4jj are uniformly bounded by assumption. The proof of (c) now\nfollows exactly the argument used in Lemma A.4 when dealing with Rm\n. \u00a5\nReferences\n[1] Andrews, D.W.K.
