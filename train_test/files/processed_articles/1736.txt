Over the past 4 years, BJBC\nrepresented the nation's largest single initiative to\nimprove the recruitment and retention of a quality,\nsustainable direct care workforce in the long-term\ncare sector. (Kemper, Brannon, Barry, Stott, &\nHeier, this special issue, provide a detailed de-\nscription of this program.)\nThe purpose of this article is to describe the\norigins and development of this combined prac-\ntice- and policy-based initiative and, in particular,\nwhy and how a national long-term care provider\nassociation (the American Association of Homes\nand Services for the Aging) and the nation's\nleading advocacy and technical assistance organi-\nzation for direct care workers (the Paraprofes-\nsional Healthcare Institute [PHI]) partnered to\nhelp create and implement this groundbreaking\neffort. The article begins by describing the\nimportant role and key characteristics of direct\ncare workers (DCWs) in long-term care and then\nhighlights three key issues that motivated the\npartnership and the evolution of BJBC. Following\nthis is a summary of the challenges that the\ndemonstration/research program was intended to\naddress and a discussion of how the BJBC initia-\ntive was designed to respond to these problems\nthrough its demonstration and applied research.\nThe article concludes with a brief summary of\nhow BJBC influenced the view of the DCW issue\nat both policy and practice levels and what the\nimplications are for future efforts to support and\nsustain this critical segment of the long-term care\nworkforce.\nWho Are the DCWs?\nDCWs--nursing assistants, home health and\nhome care aides, personal care workers, and\npersonal service attendants--form the centerpiece\nof the formal long-term care system (Stone &\nWeiner, 2001). These so-called frontline caregivers\nprovide hands-on care to millions of elderly and\nyounger people with disabilities in settings ranging\nfrom the nursing home, to assisted living and other\nresidential care options, to private homes. DCWs\nprovide 8 out of every 10 hr of paid care received by\na long-term care consumer and are often referred to\nas the ``eyes and the ears'' of the care system (PHI,\n2001). In addition to helping with activities of daily\nliving (e.g., bathing, dressing, using the toilet, and\neating), these workers provide the ``high touch'' that\nis essential to quality of life, as well as quality of\ncare, for elders and chronically disabled individuals.\nnursing aides employed in nursing home and\nThe Better Jobs Better Care National Program--including the\ndemonstration and research grants and the national evaluation--was\nfunded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Atlantic\nPhilanthropies. We extend a special thanks to the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation for its generous support of this special issue of The\nGerontologist. We would also like to thank the staff of the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant\nSecretary of Planning and Evaluation/ Disability, Aging and Long Term\nCare Policy for its support in the development of the national program. In\naddition, we express our sincere gratitude to Mary Harahan, who worked\nwith us in helping to make the Better Jobs Better Care vision a reality.\nAddress correspondence to Robyn Stone, AAHSA, 2519 Connecticut\nAvenue NW, Washington, DC 20008.

A study of the\ndemographic characteristics of DCWs, using data\nfrom the 2000 Census, indicates that the median age\nof nursing home aides is 36 years. Home care aides\nare somewhat older, with a median age of 46 years\n(Montgomery, Holley, Deichert, & Kosloski, 2005).\nThe vast majority of DCWs are female--91.3% of\nnursing home aides and 91.8% of home care aides.\nThree out of five nursing home aides and two thirds\nof home care aides are not married. A little more\nthan one quarter of those employed in nursing\nhomes and one third of those working in home care\nhave not completed high school. Many of these\nwomen are likely to be single mothers who are\nsupporting their families with one relatively low\nincome while balancing their job (and sometimes\nmore than one job) with child care and other family\nresponsibilities. These conflicting pressures may\ncontribute to absenteeism and affect the quality of\nthe worker's job performance and commitment to\nthe work.\nThere is much ethnic and racial diversity among\nDCWs. Although a little more than half of nursing\nhome and home care aides are White, 31% of those\nemployed in nursing homes and 26% of those\nemployed in home care settings are African Amer-\nican. Almost 8% of nursing home aides and 16% of\nhome care aides are Hispanic. In addition, 14% of\nnursing home aides and almost 1 out of 4 home care\naides are foreign born. The wide variation in\nethnicity and cultures represented among staff in\nlong-term care settings heightens the potential for\ntension, miscommunication, and conflict between\ncaregivers and care recipients, between peers, and\nbetween supervisors and DCWs (McDonald, 2007;\nParker, 2006). This increased diversity underscores\nthe need for improving the English-language skills of\nmany workers and building cultural competence\nknowledge and skills into formal and on-the-job\ntraining programs for DCWs and managers.\nMotivation for Developing BJBC\nHistorically, concerns about DCWs in long-term\ncare have ebbed and flowed, with the issue gaining\ngreater attention during relatively prosperous eco-\nnomic times when employers compete for workers--\nand thus staff (who might otherwise be employed by\nthe long-term care industry) find other, more\nattractive job options. During the late 1990s, such\na period of low unemployment left many long-term\ncare employers of DCWs not only with high rates of\nturnover (which is typical in the industry) but also\nwith high vacancy rates. The latter in particular\ncaused both providers and policy makers to pay\nincreased attention to how direct care jobs were\nfailing to compete within a suddenly competitive job\nmarket--admittedly more out of concern for how\nthese vacancies were impacting consumers and the\nproviders themselves, but nonetheless resulting in\na renewed interest in how to find and keep DCWs.\nShortly thereafter, PHI and the Institute for the\nFuture of Aging Services (IFAS; the research arm of the\nAmerican Association of Homes and Services for the\nAging) partnered to create a greater awarenessamong,\nand an evidence base for, policy makers and providers\nabout the need for a more systemic approach to\ndeveloping and sustaining DCWs. Both PHI and IFAS\nbased their heightened efforts on the premise that,\nalthough the then-current spike in vacancy rates was\nindeed exacerbated by the full-employment economy,\nthe underlying U.S. demographics of both the long-\nterm care consumers (demand for services) and the\nhealth care workers (supply of labor) would combine\nin the future to make the resulting ``care gap'' not\nsimply an episodic byproduct of occasional strong\neconomies but a permanent crisis for the future of\ncaregiving. (The U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services, 2003, later reinforced this premise\nabout future supply and demand projections in\na report to Congress.)\nPHI, a policy and technical assistance organization\nfor direct care issues, approached the issue primarily\nfrom a workforce development perspective: Based on\na ``quality care through quality jobs'' analysis, PHI\nfocused particularly on improving the financial,\neducational, and workplace dimensions of direct\ncare employment so that DCWs would have the\ntraining, support, and stability to provide high-\nquality care. IFAS was interested in furthering this\nissue because of the DCWs' integral place in the long-\nterm care system. Furthermore, both organizations\nwere committed to helping to advance the evidence\nbase that would support changes in practice and\npolicy. Several key issues motivated their partnership.\nWorkforce Improvement as a Long-Term Care\nQuality Issue\nOver the past 20 years, there has been increasing\ninterest in and concern about the quality of care\nbeing provided in nursing homes and other long-\nterm care settings (Noelker & Harel, 2001;\nWunderlich & Kohler, 2001). However, prior to\n2000, much of the policy, practice, and research\nactivity focused on how to improve quality outcomes\nfor residents and home care clients through a range\nof regulatory and, more recently, quality improve-\nment activities. With the exception of entry-level\ncertification requirements for nursing home and home\nhealth aides, the performance of the DCW was\nusually an afterthought in those discussions of long-\nterm care quality (Stone, Dawson, & Harahan, 2004).\nA 2001 Institute of Medicine report, however,\nidentified workforce development as one of its nine\nguiding principles and acknowledged that quality of\n6 The Gerontologist\ncare depends largely on the performance of the\ncaregiving workforce (Wunderlich & Kohler, 2001).\nUntil recently, most of the discussion of workforce\nissues had focused on achieving minimum staffing\nlevels for nurses and DCWs: A major nursing home\nstaffing study indicated that, to maximize quality of\ncare, a nursing home would need to provide 2.78 hr\nof nurse aide care per resident day, substantially\nmore than the current average of 2.02 hr of aide care\nMedicine report, however, also emphasized that an\nadequate staffing level is a necessary, but not\nsufficient, condition for positively affecting the\nquality of life and quality of care of consumers. A\nmore recent Institute of Medicine (2004) study\nfocused specifically on transforming nurse practice\nemphasized that organizations must not only have\nadequate numbers of staff, but must also create work\nenvironments that help retain nurses and nursing\nassistants. The study highlighted the importance of\nboth orientation programs for newly hired staff and\ncontinuing education for existing staff.\nAt the time planning for BJBC began, there\nexisted only limited empirical evidence directly\nlinking the performance of DCWs (and the factors\nthat contribute to effective worker performance)\nwith resident-/client-level quality-of-care and\nquality-of-life outcomes. Nevertheless, government\nand media reports did suggest that high turnover\namong nursing home and home care aides could\nnegatively affect the quality of the services delivered\nand the quality of life provided in nursing homes,\nassisted living settings, and home-based settings\n(Leon, Marainen, & Marotte, 2001; U.S. Govern-\nment Accountability Office, 1999). Interviews con-\nducted as part of a study of turnover and retention in\nnot-for-profit California nursing homes indicated\nthat, although all of the participating facilities had\nmore than adequate staffing ratios, many of the\nadministrators and supervisory staff felt that the\nlargest obstacle to delivering high-quality care was\nthe need to constantly accommodate DCW vacancies\nAlso, in an earlier study, Schnelle and colleagues\n(1993) developed and evaluated the effects of\na quality improvement program in which nursing\nassistants were trained in how to reduce inconti-\nnence, how to collect and analyze data, and how to\ntrack their own performance relative to the residents\nfor whom they were responsible. Seven of the eight\nparticipating nursing homes experienced significant\nincreases in resident dryness and maintained this\nimprovement over a 6-month follow-up. Eaton\n(2001) documented reductions in mortality and\npharmaceutical use and increases in resident func-\ntioning after the introduction of innovative organi-\nzational programs that improved the work\nenvironment of nursing home aides. These models\nincluded the development of self-managed work\nteams, improved information sharing between nurses\nand direct care staff, and enhanced responsibilities\nfor DCWs. In their evaluation of the Wellspring\nnursing home quality improvement program, Stone\nand colleagues (2002) found that the empowerment\nof the DCWs, including their significant participa-\ntion in care planning and care plan implementation,\nwas associated with reduced turnover, a reduction in\nhealth deficiency citations from state surveyors, and\na decrease in incontinence rates. Researchers in-\nvolved in a national nursing home staffing study\nfound a strong relationship between aide retention in\nCalifornia nursing homes and select quality out-\ncomes (Kramer, Eilertsen, Lin, & Hutt, 2000). For\nshort-stay nursing home residents, the study found\na strong negative association between retention rates\nand both electrolyte imbalances and urinary tract\ninfection rates. Aide retention rates also affected the\nfunctional status and pressure ulcer rates of long-\nstay residents.\nWorkforce Improvement as an Economic\nDevelopment Issue\nThe second major issue driving this interest in the\nrecruitment and retention of a quality, stable direct\ncare workforce is the potential for these occupa-\ntions to contribute to the economic development of\ncommunities across the country--assuming, of\ncourse, that the overall quality of these jobs\n(including wages, benefits, and career opportunities)\nis improved. Given the aging of the U.S. population\nover the next 40 years and increased longevity among\nyounger people with disabilities, the long-term care\nsector will undoubtedly be a growth industry. In\nlong-term care. By 2050, the number is expected to\nincrease to 27 million; the population aged 85 and\nolder--those most at risk for needing long-term\ncare--is expected to increase fivefold (U.S. De-\npartment of Health and Human Services, 2003).\nAlthough it is difficult to predict the level of\nfamily caregiving that will be available and relied on\nin the future, projections of wealth patterns among\nincome and liquid (nonhousing) assets will increase\nSnell, Alexcih, & Kennell, 2003). These estimates\nsuggest that many individuals needing long-term care\nwill prefer and be able to pay for services (Center for\nCalifornia Health Workforce Studies, 2006). Fur-\nthermore, to the extent that more baby boomers are\nmotivated to purchase long-term care insurance, this\nis almost certain to stimulate increased demand for\npaid services--especially at home and in residential\nalternatives to nursing homes.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2006) esti-\nmated that employment of DCWs in long-term care\nsettings in the next 10 years will grow faster than\nhealth care employment in general and 3 times as fast\nas all industries. During the coming decade, there will\nbe an increase of 35% in jobs for nursing assistants,\nhome health and home care aides, and personal care\nworkers. Including both new jobs and replacement\njobs for retiring workers and those who leave the\noccupation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects\nthat almost 1 million new DCWs will be needed\nfor DCWs in home- and community-based settings is\nprojected to grow even higher than for nursing homes:\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 41% increase\nin the demand for home care and personal care aides\nand a 56% increase in the demand for home health\nAlthough the projections farther out into the future\nare more equivocal, the demographic trends suggest\nthat the demands on the long-term care sector will\ncreate many job opportunities, particularly in com-\nmunities that are becoming disproportionately elderly\nbecause younger people have moved out (e.g., in many\nrural areas), substantial numbers of elders have aged\nin place (e.g., in many inner cities), or elderly\nindividuals have migrated to retirement destinations.\nWorkforce improvement efforts that help to create\nmore valuable, attractive jobs for young people as\nwell as older people looking for second careers can\npositively affect the economic health of many\ncommunities and regions across the country.\nWorkforce Improvement as a Moral Imperative\nDespite the critical role that DCWs play in the\nlong-term care system, they are among the lowest\nwage earners in the United States. In 2000, the year\nthat we began to develop the BJBC initiative, the\nmedian hourly wage for DCWs was $8.21 (PHI,\nmedian annual income of a nursing home aide in\nthe federal poverty level for a family of four, which\nThese low wages may encourage DCWs to leave\nthe long-term care or health care fields. One study in\nNorth Carolina found that nursing aides who had\nleft jobs in the health sector were better off\nfinancially than those who remained in the field\n(Konrad, 2003). The study compared North Carolina\nworkers trained as nursing aides who remained\ncertified as aides with those who did not remain\ncertified. Among those who had not been certified as\ncompared to $11,358 for actively certified nursing\naides. The median wage of those no longer certified\nwage increase for currently certified aides was\n$12,877. Although wages increased slightly in North\nCarolina over the 4-year period, median wages\nremained substantially lower for those still certified\ncompared with those who had left the field.\nThis financially disadvantaged status is exacer-\nbated by the lack of health coverage experienced by\na large portion of these caregivers: 1 in every 4\nnursing assistants and more than 2 out of 5 home\ncare workers lack health insurance coverage (Lip-\nson & Regan, 2004). DCWs are uninsured at a rate\nthat is 50% higher than the general population\nyounger than age 65, and nursing home workers are\ntwice as likely to be uninsured than hospital\nworkers (Case, Himmelstein, & Woolhandler,\n2002). Furthermore, coinsurance premiums for\nworkers in long-term care can be as much as 50%\nof the total premium (Michigan Assisted Living\nAssociation, 2001). For low-wage workers, this\nmakes offering health coverage meaningless because\nit is unaffordable.\nThese workers also face strenuous physical\ndemands and high job-related injury rates compared\nto other health- and non-health-related industries:\nand personal care facilities had a workplace injury in\n(Service Employees International Union, 1999). The\nnursing home aide occupation ranks second only to\ntruck driver in the federal government's list of\ndangerous professions (Service Employees Interna-\ntional Union, 1999). Car accidents pose the greatest\ndanger for home care workers.\nIn addition to this disadvantaged status, these\nworkers--who provide up to three quarters of all\nlong-term care--have few opportunities for job\nadvancement and upgrading of their skills. There\nis, furthermore, often a stigma associated with being\na DCW, particularly a home care aide or personal\ncare attendant, such that one is frequently referred to\nas a ``girl'' or viewed as simply a domestic worker--\nGiven the very low quality of and value attributed\nto these jobs, Friedland (2004) noted that\nit could reasonably be argued that our long-term care\nsystem--paid primarily by public tax dollars--has\nan obligation to create jobs that provide a livable\nwage; that our publicly funded health system has\na responsibility, at the very least, to provide its own\nworkers with health insurance. (p. 7)\nFriedland went on to lament that moral persuasion\nalone has failed to offer significant improvements in\nthe quality of direct care jobs. We agree with this\nsentiment and believe that there is a moral imper-\native to improve the recruitment and retention of\nDCWs in long-term care by supporting public\npolicies and educational and provider practices that\nhelp to elevate these jobs to recognized, valued\nprofessions.\n8 The Gerontologist\nThe Current Problem\nAcross the country, long-term care providers\nreport DCW vacancies and high turnover rates.\nNursing homes, assisted living and other residential\ncare providers, home health agencies, community-\nbased home care and adult day programs, and\nindividuals and their families all indicate that they\nexperience difficulties in recruiting and, more impor-\ntant, retaining frontline caregivers (PHI, 2001;\nStone & Weiner, 2001). This workforce problem\nwas the pivotal issue that motivated BJBC's two\nfunders--the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and\nthe Atlantic Philanthropies--to invest in the national\ndemonstration and applied research program.\nNationally, data on turnover rates show wide\n(American Health Care Association, 2003; PHI,\n2001). Most states--major stakeholders in financing\n(via Medicaid) and regulating the long-term care\nsector--identified DCW recruitment and retention as\na major policy concern in 1999 when the United\nStates was experiencing very low rates of unemploy-\nment and there was great competition for workers at\nthe local level (NCDHHS, 1999). Even with increases\nin unemployment rates, however, states continue to\nview these long-term care workforce issues as\npriorities (PHI and North Carolina Department of\nHealth and Human Services Office of Long-Term\nHigh staff turnover and vacancies have negative\neffects on the major stakeholders within the long-\nterm care system: workers, consumers (including\ntheir families), long-term care providers, and third-\nparty payers--primarily the Medicaid and Medicare\nTurnover is expensive, although a dearth of studies\nhas attempted to quantify the per-worker costs of\nfrontline turnover in different long-term care set-\ntings. Seavey (2004) conducted a meta-analysis of the\nliterature and concluded that a minimum direct cost\nof turnover per worker is at least $2,500. Most of the\nstudies she reviewed (Straker & Atchley, 1999;\nWaldman, 2004) estimated the costs of separation\nand vacancy, hiring, training, and increased worker\ninjuries. Seavey noted, however, that the indirect\ncosts of turnover (lost productivity until the re-\nplacement is trained, reduced service quality, lost\nrevenues, lost clients to other agencies, deterioration\nin organizational culture and employee morale) may\nbe substantial and tend to be overlooked because\nthey are less visible and harder to measure.\nIn addition, turnover and vacancies are costly not\nonly to providers but also to consumers (through\nreduction in quality of care and life and care hours\nnot received) and to workers (through increased\nworker injuries, increased physical and emotional\nstress, deterioration in working conditions, and\nincreased likelihood of quitting). Compromised\ncare quality can result in deterioration of the\nresident/long-term care client's health or functional\ncondition, which in turn leads to increased transfers\nto more expensive, higher acuity settings, unneces-\nsary emergency visits and hospital stays, and even\nhigher mortality (Kosel & Olivo, 2002; Seavey,\n2004). Such adverse outcomes have a ripple effect\nand inevitably raise costs to third-party payers\n(primarily Medicaid and Medicare). These down-\nstream medical costs ultimately are borne by citizens\nwhose tax dollars support the public programs that\nThe Long-Term Outlook\nAs noted earlier, the unprecedented increase in the\nsize and proportion of the elderly population and the\ngrowth in the nonelderly disabled population will\nincrease the demand for DCWs across all long-term\ncare settings. There is, however, serious concern\nabout the availability of these caregivers in the\nfuture. In the coming decades, as baby boomers enter\nold age and begin to require assistance, the pool of\nworkers available to provide basic long-term care\nservices will fail to keep up with demand (Feldman,\nnumber of potential entry-level workers who tradi-\ntionally fill direct care jobs--women aged 25 to 54 in\nthe civilian workforce--is projected to increase by\nonly 3.2% during the next 7 years (U.S. Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, 2006). This tightening of the\ntraditional labor pool is caused by the baby boom\ngeneration having passed through this age range, and\nthe slowed rate of increased participation of women\nin the workplace.\nThe educational level among minority women--\nthose most likely to enter the direct care work-\nforce--is also improving dramatically. Although the\neducational status of both White and Black women\nimproved substantially over the past several decades,\nthe increase was most striking for the latter group.\nof Black women aged 25 or older with at least a high\nthe proportion with 4 years or more of college\n2008). These more educated women will be less\nwilling to work in the same low-wage, low-benefit\njobs than those who preceded them.\nThe Response: Design of the BJBC Initiative\nIn response to the caregiving, economic develop-\nment, and moral challenges presented by the\nemerging care gap, IFAS and PHI engaged with the\ntwo national philanthropic organizations during\n2002 to design BJBC. This program, funded at\n$15.5 million over 4 years, would soon become the\nlargest frontline health care staffing initiative in the\ncountry. The initiative took shape with two primary\ncomponents: (a) a five-state, field-based demonstra-\ntion program; and (b) a set of applied research\ninitiatives resulting in eight studies that comple-\nmented, but were distinct from, the five-state\ndemonstration.\nDesign of the Five-State Demonstration\nThe premise of the demonstration program was\nthreefold:\n Poor recruitment strategies and high rates of turnover\nhad resulted in an unstable direct care workforce that\nwas thus hampered in providing ``better care.''\n The causes of these recruitment and retention\nproblems were many--no single solution was avail-\nable to create ``better jobs''--and thus interventions\nhad to be tested at both the practice level and the\npolicy level.\n Greater evidence of effective interventions was\nrequired to convince both providers and policy\nmakers to invest in solutions addressing the emerging\ncare gap.\nIFAS and PHI, in consultation with the national\nfunders, shaped the demonstration program to test\na proposed ``theory of change.'' This theory of\nchange posited that the greatest and most lasting\nimprovements in recruitment and retention were\nmost likely to occur if the following six program\nfeatures were included.\nState-Based Demonstrations.--Long-term care\nsystems are primarily influenced by Medicaid re-\nimbursement policy, eligibility requirements and\nprogram design, state regulations, and training and\neducational requirements that differ significantly by\nstate. The developers of the BJBC national program,\ntherefore, required the demonstration to be state\nbased, although not located within the state\ngovernment. The five successful applicants were all\nstatewide initiatives.\nKey Stakeholder Engagement.--The design of\nthe demonstration required that organized represen-\ntatives of the key nongovernmental stakeholders\nwithin long-term care--consumers, provider/em-\nployers, and workers--work together to forge\ncommon solutions. Therefore, an essential design\nelement was that each state initiative include at the\nonset credible organizations representing at least two\nof those three key stakeholders, and that successful\napplicants present a plan to engage as soon as\npractical organizations representing all three stake-\nholders. Also, although the funders chose not to\nallow any governmental units to be lead grant\nrecipients, the program designers expected successful\napplicants to present strategies that would directly\nengage state and local governmental leaders--\nparticularly in their efforts to change public policy.\nExisting Leadership and Momentum.--The de-\nsigners of this national program recognized that\nsuccess would be more likely in states where there\nalready existed some activity, leadership, and\nmomentum toward addressing recruitment and\nretention issues. Therefore, they selected applicants\nin part on the degree to which they could\ndemonstrate that efforts were underway and that\ntheir BJBC project would build on this preexisting\nmomentum.\nProactive Worker Involvement.--Given the piv-\notal role that DCWs play in delivering long-term\ncare services, and the program's interest in strength-\nening the voice of the DCW, the designers required\nthat, at the very least, DCWs be proactively engaged\nin the governance of the proposed project. Successful\napplicants included workers on their advisory\nboards; several fielded educational programs that\nincluded the voices of both consumers and workers;\nand two sites developed worker associations as part\nof their array of interventions.\nMultifaceted Intervention Approach.--The pro-\ngram encouraged state-based initiatives to address\na broad range of implementation strategies, in-\ncluding both practice-based initiatives (directly\nworking inside the agencies and facilities of employ-\ners/providers) and policy-based initiatives (reform-\ning public regulatory, finance, or funding criteria in\nlong-term care, aging, workforce development, or\neducational programs). As a corollary, the designers\ndid not require any particular array of solutions,\npresuming that each state was distinct, and thus the\nmost effective ``cocktail'' of solutions would likely be\ntailored by the unique combination of state-based\nstakeholders working together.\nMultiple Settings.--The proposed solutions were\napplied across a range of long-term care provider\ntypes and settings--including nursing homes, assisted\nliving facilities, adult day care centers, home care\nagencies, and independent home care provider\nprograms. Although each of these provider types\nexists within unique funding ``silos'' and is subject to\ndiffering regulatory and finance environments, direct\ncare positions are somewhat similar across these\nsettings and draw from much of the same labor pool.\nInterventions, therefore, were likely to be effective in\nmultiple settings.\nAt the same time, the designers also assumed that\ndiffering silos create warring political factions\namong providers, consumers, and worker/labor\norganizations, which in turn impede change. There-\nfore, the designers posited that if the walls of\nmisperception between these factions could be\n10 The Gerontologist\nlowered and ``win\u00adwins'' could be created for all\nstakeholders by working together within the BJBC\nprogram, greater success and potential for sustain-\nability across all of the silos might result.\nBased on these design assumptions and features,\nthe designers distributed widely two requests for\nproposals--one soliciting proposals for applied\nresearch projects that examined various aspects of\nworkforce improvement in long-term care, and the\nother soliciting proposals to develop state-based\ndemonstrations. A National Advisory Committee\nappointed by the two foundations reviewed more\nthan 200 research proposals and recommended\nfunding for eight applied research projects. The\nCommittee also recommended funding for 5 out of\nthe 220 demonstration proposals they reviewed. The\noverwhelming response to both of the requests for\nproposals underscored the interest in and concern\nabout this workforce issue among state stakeholders\nand researchers across the country.\nThe Applied Research Projects\nSix of the eight applied research grantees were\nuniversity-based, one was located within a provider-\nbased research center, and another was based\nwithin a workforce development program. Two\nprojects focused on the role of various aspects of\nleadership, work design, and relationships between\nand across staff and residents in improving work-\nplace outcomes in nursing homes. One grantee\ndeveloped and evaluated the effectiveness of a cul-\ntural competency assessment and training tool in\nhelping to create a healthier work environment for\nDCWs. Two other grantees assessed the role of\ntailored and ongoing training programs in improv-\ning job satisfaction and reducing turnover in the\nlong-term care sector. Another grantee examined\nthe effects of improved wages and benefits on the\nlikelihood of home care workers entering and\nstaying in the job. The final two grantees explored\nissues related to expanding the labor pool of DCWs,\nincluding the potential for older adults and family\ncaregivers to enter this labor market. Summaries of\nthe applied research projects supported by the\nnational program are on the BJBC website\n(www.bjbc.org). In addition, specific articles related\nto these research projects are published elsewhere in\nthis special issue of The Gerontologist.\nThe State Demonstration Policy and\nPractice Solutions\nThe National Advisory Committee awarded\ngrants averaging $1.4 million each to the following\nfive lead nonprofit agencies: the Iowa CareGivers\nAssociation, the CCommunity of Vermont Elders,\nthe North Carolina Foundation for Advanced Health\nPrograms, the Oregon Works! Coalition, and the\nPennsylvania-based Center for Advocacy for the\nRights and Interests of the Elderly.\nEach of the demonstration states eventually\ncrafted a unique cocktail of policy and practice\nresponses. Although none of the demonstration\nprograms had the resources to consider a fully\ncomprehensive solution to recruitment and reten-\ntion, taken together the BJBC programs addressed\nwhat we consider to be nine essential elements of\na quality job program for DCWs (PHI, 2006a). These\nnine elements fall within the three broad categories\nof compensation, opportunity for advancement, and\norganizational support (see Table 1).\nWithin the demonstration sites, these essential\nelements were reflected in practice-based initiatives,\nsuch as a peer mentor program in Iowa, supervisory\ntraining in Oregon, and leadership training and\nteam-building activities in Pennsylvania. They were\nalso reflected in policy-based initiatives, such as the\nNew Organizational Vision Award licensure pro-\ngram in North Carolina, state-funded long-range\nneeds analysis for DCWs across settings in Vermont,\nand the infusion of person-centered care into the\nstate nurse aide and nurse training requirements in\nOregon. The efficacy of these initiatives, although\nstill being assessed, is reported on by researchers\nfrom The Pennsylvania State University's Depart-\nment of Health Policy and Administration, the\nevaluators of the BJBC program (see Kemper,\nBrannon, Barry, Stoot, & Heier, this issue).\nConclusion\nSince the inception of BJBC, issues related to the\navailability of and quality of the direct care work-\nforce have received increasing attention by policy\nmakers at the federal and state levels, providers,\nconsumer and worker organizations, and research-\ners. We believe that this national program, with the\nfoundations' generous support and imprimatur,\nhelped to catalyze this increased attention. During\nthe past 4 years, the current status and future of the\ndirect care workforce was the subject of two national\nprovider-sponsored long-term care commissions\nis a major focus of the current National Campaign\nfor Quality Nursing Homes. The Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services required workforce\nimprovement activities and outcome measures to be\ndeveloped and implemented in the eighth scope of\nwork of the Quality Improvement Organizations, the\ngroups with which it contracts in each state to work\nwith nursing homes and home health agencies on\nquality improvement initiatives. Many state-based\nculture change coalitions have recognized the crucial\nrole of direct care workforce improvement in\nensuring that change actually occurs and is sustained\nwithin nursing homes and other long-term care\nsettings. The U.S. Department of Labor and its state\nand local counterparts have invested significant new\ndollars in the development of training and appren-\nticeship programs for the direct care workforce\nemployed in long-term care settings.\nAs the BJBC national program comes to a close,\nwe and the participants in this initiative face several\nchallenges. As is discussed in more detail in this\nspecial issue, the research projects and demonstra-\ntion sites have produced many findings, lessons\nlearned, and concrete products and tools (e.g., peer\nmentoring programs, supervisory and cultural com-\npetence training programs, model DCW and su-\npervisor curricula, model occupational profiles,\nworkforce improvement assessment tools, legislative\nand administrative changes at the state level) that\nneed to be disseminated and replicated across the\ncountry at the practice and policy levels.\nOne major challenge for the demonstration\ncoalitions, participating providers, worker and\nconsumer associations, and policy makers will be\nto sustain their successes and to help diffuse their\nefforts beyond their own organizations and states.\nThe national program partners also have a commit-\nment to and responsibility for designing and\nimplementing dissemination strategies to share the\nsuccesses and failures of BJBC with a diverse\naudience and to promote replication of the most\npromising practices and policy changes.\nOver the 4-year grant period, BJBC helped to raise\nthe visibility of DCWs, gave them a voice, and made\nsome important inroads toward developing better\njobs and producing better care for this country's\naging population. The practice, policy, and research\ncommunities now must build on that momentum to\nhelp create and sustain a quality long-term care\nworkforce today and in the future.\nReferences\nAbt Associates.
