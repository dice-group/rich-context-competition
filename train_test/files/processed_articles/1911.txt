This corresponds to\n42 million US households with firearms, and 57 million adult gun owners. 64% of gun owners or 16% of\nAmerican adults reported owning at least one handgun. Long guns represent 60% of the privately held gun\nstock. Almost half (48%) of all individual gun owners reported owning >4 firearms. Men more often reported\nfirearm ownership, with 45% stating that they personally owned at least one firearm, compared with 11% for\nwomen.\nConclusions: The US population continues to contain at least one firearm for every adult, and ownership is\nbecoming increasingly concentrated. Long guns are the most prevalent type of gun in the US but handgun\nownership is widespread. Ownership demographic patterns support findings of previous studies.\nThe General Social Survey, a biannual survey of the US\ncivilian population, has tracked household and personal\nfirearm ownership over the past two and a half decades.1\nThis survey reports the percentage of households with firearms\nand personal firearm ownership for the nation as a whole and\nfor the nine major census regions. Over the past 4 years,\ninformation from the General Social Survey has been supple-\nmented by information on household gun ownership at the\nstate level from the National Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System.2 A clear pattern that has emerged over\nthe past several decades from these surveys is a persistent\ndecline in household gun ownership. Although these surveys\ndescribe the demographic patterns of gun ownership in the US,\nthey provide almost no information about the characteristics of\nor changes in the nation's gun stock.\nWe conducted a nationally representative household tele-\nphone survey in 2004 to explore the characteristics of privately\nowned firearms in the US. The last study to examine detailed\nquestions like these, such as the types and numbers of working\nfirearms in private homes, was conducted in 1994 by Cook and\nLudwig.3 In their comprehensive report, they found that 35% of\nhouseholds and 25% of individuals owned firearms, and\nestimated that there were 192 million working firearms in the\nUS in private hands. In addition to describing demographic\ncharacteristics of firearm owners, they were able to determine\nthat the ownership of private firearms was highly concentrated\namong a small percentage of owners. They also clearly\nidentified a difference in the number of household firearms\nreported by married men and women, who, in theory, should\nreport similar rates of household firearm ownership. Their\nfindings, however, that married men reported a rate of 49%\nhousehold firearm ownership compared with 36% reported by\nmarried women suggested that women were either unaware of\ntheir spouse's firearm ownership or were reluctant to report it.\nThese results led the authors to believe that more complete\nsurvey responses would come from individuals who personally\nowned a firearm rather than the household responses.\nAll of these findings helped identify patterns of private\nfirearm ownership in the US and provided health professionals,\nresearchers and policy makers with information about the\nprivate gun stock that was previously unknown. Through our\nsurvey, we wished to investigate possible changes in the\nadditional information about firearm ownership patterns in the\nMETHODS\nThe institutional review board at the Harvard School of Public\nHealth approved this study in 2004. The random-digit-dial\ntelephone sample (conducted by the survey research firm Fact\nFinders, St Louis, Missouri, USA) comprised 2770 randomly\nselected adults aged >18 years living in the 50 states and\nincluding the District of Columbia. The number of interviews\ndesignated for each of the states was proportional to that state's\npopulation relative to the total population of the US as given by\nthe 2000 census. The methods used in composing this sample\nassured that each household with a telephone had an equal\nprobability of being selected for inclusion in the sampling\nframe. One adult from each household was randomly selected\nto participate.\nInterviews were completed between 17 March and 28 June\n2004. Once a telephone number had been randomly selected for\ninclusion in the survey sample, as many as 10 repeat phone\ncalls were made until a final disposition was assigned. Of the\nnot residential, not in service or were for households in states\nwhere the interview quota had been reached. In addition, 39%\nof interviews could not be completed because the maximum\nnumber of calls had been made without an eligible respondent\nwere refusals. According to calculations based on formulas\nfrom the American Association for Public Opinion Research,4\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nour minimum response rate was 14%, assuming that all\nunknowns were eligible and counting partial interviews as\nrespondents; and our maximum response rate was 18%,\nassuming that all unknowns were ineligible.\nDemographic characteristics including age, sex, education,\nmarital status, race, presence of children in the home, whether\nthe area was urban or rural, and household size of our sample\nwere compared with those from the 2000 census.5 Although the\ndemographic characteristics of our sample seemed similar\noverall to that of the census, our respondents had slightly\nhigher educational levels (92% v total US 85% had at least a\nhigh-school diploma) and single-family households were fewer\n(19% v total US 26%). Our sample also under-represented adult\nmen aged 18\u00ad34 years. For that reason, post-stratification\nweightings were applied to the data to reflect the age and sex\ndistribution of the US population. Adjustments for the like-\nlihood of selection on the basis of the number of adults in the\nhousehold were also included in the weightings.\nOur study included 40 active duty military personnel, who\nrepresented 1.4% of the total study population. Eleven reported\nowning firearms; however, only one reported owning the\nfirearm primarily for work. We therefore chose to keep all of the\nrespondents in the sample.\nRespondents were asked several questions regarding firearm\nownership and use. In particular, they were asked, ``Do you or\nanyone you live with currently have any guns in your home or\nmotor vehicles? Not including toys, models, air guns or starter\npistols.'' If the response was affirmative, the respondent was\nthen asked, ``In total, how many guns do you and anyone you\nlive with currently have in your home or motor vehicle?'' All\nrespondents who replied that there were guns in their house-\nhold were asked how many of each type of firearm was in their\nhome (ie, revolvers, shotguns) and if they were in working\norder. To determine the proportion of adults who personally\nowned firearms, we asked those respondents who had replied\nthat there were guns in their home, ``Do any guns in your home\nbelong to you personally?''\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive and bivariate analyses were used to explore the\nrelationships between firearm ownership, demographics, con-\ncentration and motivations for ownership. As previously\nmentioned, research suggests that individuals who personally\nown firearms report firearm ownership more accurately than\nnon-owners who live in households with firearms.6\u00ad8 All of our\nreported analyses are therefore based on responses from\nindividual gun owners rather than respondents living in\nhouseholds with guns, unless specifically noted that the\ncalculation was performed using household responses.\nTo produce national estimates of the number of firearms in\nthe US, we used population figures from the US census9 to\ndetermine the number of adults aged >18 years and the\nnumber of households in the US. We then calculated the\npercentage of respondents in our survey who reported\npersonally owning a firearm. This number was applied to the\nUS population to create national estimates of the number of\nadults who owned firearms. To estimate the number of firearms\nin private hands, we multiplied the number of firearm owners\nby the average number of firearms reported by respondents in\nour survey. As firearm ownership is not normally distributed\nand our survey included some extreme outliers in terms of the\nnumber of firearms owned, we performed calculations exclud-\ning the outliers. As a sensitivity analysis, similar calculations\nwere performed using household reports of firearm ownership.\nWe also conducted comparative analyses among men and\nwomen, and among respondents who lived alone and those\nliving in multi-person households.\nRESULTS\nFirearm owners reported that 60% of the firearms owned in the\nUS in 2004 were long guns, primarily rifles and shotguns (fig 1);\nthe remaining 40% were handguns. Among all firearms, rifles\nwere the most common, representing 33% of the gun stock.\nRevolvers were the most common type of handgun. A small\npercentage of respondents (5%) reported owning other hand-\nguns, including derringers and antique handguns. Other long\nguns, which include muzzle loaders and antique long guns,\nrepresented 6%.\nAccording to our survey, 38% of households reported at least\none firearm in the home and 26% of adults reported owning at\nleast one gun. This corresponds to 42 million households with\nfirearms and 57 million adult gun owners. We found that 64%\nof gun owners or 16% of adults reported owning at least one\nhandgun; 80% of gun owners or 20% of all adults owned a long\ngun (results not shown).\nOwnership demographics\nFirearm ownership was more prevalent among middle-aged\nand older adults than among young adults aged 18\u00ad24 years\n(table 1). Ownership of any firearm was more common among\nmen, those who were married or living with a partner, and\nrespondents living in rural areas or the South. Ownership was\nstrongly associated with whether the respondent grew up with\nguns in the home. Among gun-owning households in our\nsurvey, 46% had >1 adult gun owner.\nReasons for ownership\nWhen respondents were asked, ``What is the one most\nimportant reason that you own a handgun/long gun?'' the\nmost common response among those who owned a handgun\nwas for self-defense (46%), followed by sport shooting (hunting\nor target shooting) or collecting (25%). Owners of long guns\noverwhelmingly reported sport shooting as the ``most impor-\ntant'' reason to own a long gun (77%; data not shown).\nConcentration of ownership\nAlmost half (48%) of all individual gun owners, corresponding\nto 13% of the US adult population, reported owning >4\nfirearms. Household ownership followed a similar pattern, with\n41% of firearm-owning households reporting ownership of >4\nfirearms (table 2). The 20% of gun owners who owned the most\nguns possessed about 65% of the nation's guns.\nOther gun\nOther long gun\nShotgun\nSemi automatic pistol\nOther handgun\nRifle\nRevolver\nFigure 1 Types of firearms owned in the US.\n16 Hepburn, Miller, Azrael, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nNumber of guns\nThe actual number of guns reported in our survey varied\ndepending on how the question was asked and who answered\nthe question. Individual firearm owners (n = 702) reported\nowning an average of 6.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2 to\n7.9, median 3) working firearms. On further examination, it\nseemed that individuals who owned >4 firearms (with an\naverage of 12 firearms per person) were greatly affecting the\nmean.

We estimated that 42 million households in the US\npossessed at least one firearm in 2004, with an average of 5.2\nguns removed. The number of privately owned firearms in the\nReporting differences\nOverall, men and women reported different rates of household\nfirearm ownership. Among married respondents who lived in\ntwo-adult households, married men reported a household\nfirearm ownership rate of 54% and an average of 8 firearms\nper household compared with a 40% ownership rate and an\naverage of 4.6 guns as reported by married women (table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nIn general, our survey results are consistent with previous\nreports of firearm ownership demographics.1 3 10 Firearms are\nmost likely to be owned by white men who live in a rural areas,\nthose who are middle-aged or older, with a middle to higher\nincome, who grew up with guns in the home and who live in\nthe southern or mid-western regions of the country. Long guns\ncontinue to be the most prevalent type of gun in the US. Our\nsurvey, however, reports a slightly higher percentage of\nv 34%). This shift to a greater proportion of handguns may be\nreflective of the decline in hunting and indicate a change in\nmotivations and use of firearm ownership.10 Similar to previous\nTable 1 Demographic characteristics of firearm owners\nn\nOwns any\nfirearm,\n(%)\nOwns both\nhandguns\nand long guns,\n(%)\nOwns handguns\nonly,\n(%)\nOwns long\nguns only,\n(%)\nAge (years)\nSex\nRace\nMarital status\nCommunity\nEducation\nAnnual income\nMilitary service\nPolitical views\nRegion\nChild aged ,18 years\nParents had a gun at home\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nsurveys,3 10 handgun owners were most likely to report owning\ntheir handguns for self-protection, whereas owners of long\nguns reported owning their guns for sporting purposes.\nIndividuals who own only handguns are just as likely to live\nin an urban environment as a rural one and are demographi-\ncally more diverse compared with owners of only long guns\nwho are more likely to be men and live in a rural area.\nOur findings diverge from those of previous studies on\nfirearm ownership regarding the increase in the average\nnumber of guns per gun owner. Although the rate of individual\n(26%) and household (38%) ownership is similar to that in\nother recent surveys,1\u00ad3 11 the number of guns reported per\nperson is higher. When including outliers, gun owners reported\nan average of 6.9 guns per owner compared with 4.1 reported in\nThe higher average number of guns in our survey is attributable\nto the higher number of guns owned by those who owned >4\nguns, as the percentage of gun owners in each category of gun\nownership (those owning 1\u00ad3 or >4 guns) has stayed almost\nthe same.\nCook and Ludwig3 reported an estimate of 192 million\nworking firearms in circulation in 1994. Although the popula-\nalone does not explain the differences in the number of guns\nreported. A recent report by the National Research Council,\nusing national data on firearms manufactured, imported and\nexported, estimated that 258 million firearms were available in\nthe US as of 1999.12 This estimate does not account for firearm\nloss, breakage or those destroyed. When we calculated the\nnumber of guns in the same manner as in the National\nResearch Council report, adding all available years, we\ncalculated that about 275 million guns were manufactured or\nimported for private sale in the US by the end of 2003. As the\nUS does not require firearms to be registered (although some\nindividual states do), it is impossible to determine the exact\nnumber of privately owned firearms in this country.\nOur estimates of 283 million firearms in the US may be\nhigher than those that Cook and Ludwig established in 1994,\neven with the population growth kept in context, for many\npossible reasons. Our sample may have, by chance, captured\nmore affluent firearm owners who own many guns. We\nadjusted for age and sex, but were unable to adjust for income\nbecause our income-related questions were not comparable\nwith a standard such as the US census. Alternatively,\nrespondents may have overestimated the number of guns they\nowned. Given that we are extrapolating from a survey of 2770\nrespondents to millions of Americans, small changes in the\nnumber of reported firearms results in a large difference in the\nnational estimates.\nThe General Social Survey indicates that household gun\nownership has been declining over time, from about 50% in the\nnumber of firearms in the US may be debatable as a result of\ninclusion or exclusion of outliers, or whether individual or\nhousehold responses are used, it seems that although the\nproportion of households with firearms is declining, the number\nof working firearms in the US is increasing, not decreasing, and\nincreasing most among those who already own firearms.\nWe also found evidence to support earlier research showing that\nwomen report lower levels of household firearm ownership, and\nin particular report fewer guns per household than men.6\u00ad8\nMarried women in our study reported an average of 3.4 fewer\nhousehold guns than married men and a difference in ownership\nof 14% (54% in men v 40% in women). These findings reinforce\nearlier recommendations for surveys of firearm ownership and\nbehavior,6 to seek information from individual firearm owners\nrather than any person living in a household with a firearm.\nLimitations\nWe have considered some of the challenges faced when\nconducting telephone surveys, in particular those related to\nasking household members to respond to questions about\ntopics, in this case firearm ownership, which may pertain to\nother members of the household. This self-reported data may\nalso be subject to potential inaccuracies due to recall bias or the\ntendency to report socially desirably responses.13 For example,\nwhen we asked respondents two different questions to\ndetermine how many firearms were in their households, one\nasking for the total number of guns in the home and one asking\nspecifically how many of each type of gun were owned, we\noften received two different numbers. Given that this was a\ntelephone survey, we were limited to adults with access to a\nworking telephone. If households without telephones were\nmore or less likely to own a firearm, then our findings could be\nbiased in the respective directions. Finally, non-response can\nTable 2 Distribution of firearm ownership in the\nUS population\nFirearms owned\nPercentage of US population\nIndividuals* Households*\n*Calculations based on the number of individuals who reported\nan actual number of firearms; 5% of households that reported\nowning a firearm did not report the number of firearms present\nin their home.\n\u00c0These numbers are calculated using the affirmative response to\nowning a firearm.\nTable 3 Rates of household firearm ownership, median\nand average number of guns per household for men and\nwomen\nOwnership\nrate\nAverage number\nof guns Median\nKey points\nN Firearm ownership in the US is very common, with about\none third of all households owning at least one firearm.\nN Long guns are the most prevalent type of gun in the US,\nbut 40% of the gun stock is handguns.\nN Firearm ownership is highly concentrated, with a small\nnumber of adults owning a large proportion of the\nnation's firearms.\nN Married men and women report different rates of\nhousehold firearm ownership, supporting the proposal\nthat researchers should seek information about firearm\nownership from individual firearm owners.\n18 Hepburn, Miller, Azrael, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\naffect the validity of our findings if those choosing not to\nanswer a question differed systematically from those who did.14\nThe low response rate in this survey is similar to other random-\ndigit-dial telephone surveys15; however, it still allows for\npotential bias if those who participated in the survey differed\nin terms of firearm ownership from those who did not.\nCONCLUSIONS\nImplications for prevention\nIn the US, about one in four adults owns at least one firearm.\nAlthough some other developed countries have similar rates of\npersonal firearm ownership, what is unique in the US is the\nnumber of firearms privately owned. Researchers have esti-\nmated about 25 guns per 100 people in countries such as\nCanada, New Zealand, Germany, France and Sweden.16 On the\nbasis of current estimates from our survey, the US has 93 guns\nThe National Academy of Sciences recently issued a report on\nfirearms and violence in which they called for improved data on\nfirearm ownership and use to advance the empirical evalua-\ntions of programs and policies to reduce gun violence.12 Our\nfindings describe the current motivations for firearm ownership\nand also provide information on the similarities and differences\namong owners of different types of guns. This information can\nassist in designing a more appropriate firearm injury policy as\nwell as understanding the denominator of exposure when\nevaluating injury prevention interventions.\n"
