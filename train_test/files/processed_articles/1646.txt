Sampson, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, and approved May 17, 2010 (received for review January 21, 2010)\nThis study estimates the acute effect of exposure to a local\nhomicide on the cognitive performance of children across a com-\nmunity. Data are from a sample of children age 5\u00ad17 y in the Project\non Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. The effect of\nlocal homicides on vocabulary and reading assessments is identi-\nfied by exploiting exogenous variation in the relative timing of\nhomicides and interview assessments among children in the same\nneighborhood but assessed at different times. Among African-\nAmericans, the strongest results show that exposure to a homicide\nin the block group that occurs less than a week before the assess-\nment reduces performance on vocabulary and reading assessments\nby between 0.5 and 0.66 SD, respectively. Main results are rep-\nlicated using a second independent dataset from Chicago. Findings\nsuggest the need for broader recognition of the impact that ex-\ntreme acts of violence have on children across a neighborhood, re-\ngardless of whether the violence is witnessed directly.\ncognitive function | neighborhoods | violence | acute stress\nDespite the national decline in homicides that has occurred\nsince the mid-1990s, homicide remains among the leading\ncauses of death among 15- to 24-y-olds nationally and is the top\ncause of death among African-Americans in this age range (1).\nThese figures reflect the toll that homicide takes in terms of lives\nlost, but they may understate the total impact of extreme violence\namong children living in violent areas. Research examining direct\nexposure to serious violence among youth suggests possible\neffects on a range of developmental outcomes, although the\nestimates are subject to problems of selection bias (2\u00ad5). This\nstudy takes a broader view and examines the impact of extreme\nviolence as felt across a community, regardless of whether the\nviolence is witnessed directly. Specifically, the analysis estimates\nthe acute effect of local homicides on children's cognitive per-\nformance, as measured by two assessments of vocabulary and\nreading skills.\nIncidents of extreme violence may affect children's performance\non cognitive assessments through various physiological, emotional,\nor social responses related to stress, fear, or trauma. Research has\nshown that youth directly or indirectly exposed to different forms\nof community violence show elevated rates of symptoms related to\nacute or posttraumatic stress disorder, including disrupted sleep,\nanxiety, reduced awareness, and difficulty with concentration, all\nof which may act as mechanisms leading to impaired performance\non cognitive assessments (6\u00ad9). The broader literature on stress\nand cognitive function provides further support for the hypothe-\nsized relationship between exposure to environmental stress and\ncognitive performance (10\u00ad12). Findings from experimental studies\nof humans are nuanced, but one consistent result is that highly el-\nevated levels of stress or stress hormones impair cognitive perfor-\nmance, particularly on tasks related to declarative memory (10, 11).\nThe general finding linking experimentally induced stress with im-\npaired cognitive performance is consistent with a large literature\nExtending the findings from these experimental studies to as-\nsess the impact of violent events in children's environments is\nchallenging, however, because the experience of living near a ho-\nmicide cannot be reproduced in an experimental setting, and\nhomicides are not distributed randomly across neighborhoods in\na city. Estimates of \"homicide effects\" will be biased if unobserved\nfactors jointly predict selection into a violent environment and the\noutcome of interest. To address the problem of selection bias,\na method is developed that exploits exogenous variation in the\nrelative timing of homicides and interview assessments among\nchildren living within the same neighborhood.\nData on all reported homicides occurring in Chicago from 1994\nthrough 2002 are merged with data from a survey of children and\nfamilies in Chicago conducted over the same timeframe, the\nProject on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods\n(PHDCN) (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/PHDCN) (14). Children\nin the PHDCN sample who were clustered within the same\nneighborhoods were assessed over an extended period covering\nseveral months or longer. Using neighborhood fixed effects\nspecifications, the impact of a recent, local homicide is identified\nby comparing scores on cognitive assessments among children\nliving within the same neighborhood who were assessed at dif-\nferent times: Some were assessed in the days following a local\nhomicide, whereas others were assessed months later or earlier.\nThe central assumption underlying the method is that, within\na given neighborhood, the timing of homicides in relation to the\ntiming of interview assessments produces exogenous variation in\nthe recency of local homicides; this exogenous variation serves as\nthe basis for causal inference.\nResults\nreported by the Chicago Police Department and successfully\ngeocoded. Exposure to local homicides varies substantially by\nrace/ethnicity. Among African-Americans in the PHDCN sam-\nples, 54 assessments were conducted within 4 d after a homicide\nwithin 28 d (12.5%). Exposure to local homicides is much less\ncommon among Hispanics and is extremely rare among whites.\nThe effect of a local homicide is estimated separately for\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics so that all comparisons are\nmade within race/ethnic groups; whites and members of other race\nand ethnic groups are excluded because results for these groups\nwould be based on only a handful of individuals in the sample who\ncontribute to the estimate. Estimates represent the effect of a\nlocal (within the neighborhood) homicide occurring within dif-\nferent time intervals preceding the assessment, including tract by\nsurvey wave fixed effects, and controlling for calendar year and\nmonth of year (analysis details are given in Materials and Methods).\nAuthor contributions: P.S. designed research, performed research, analyzed data, and\nwrote the paper.\nThe author declares no conflict of interest.\n*This Direct Submission article had a prearranged editor.\n1E-mail: patrick.sharkey@nyu.edu.\nThis article contains supporting information online at www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.\nGender and age group interactions also were tested, although no clear pattern of inter-\nactions was present.\nSOCIAL\nSCIENCES\nNeighborhoods are operationalized using three successively larger\nnested boundaries: block groups, census tracts, and neighborhood\nclusters (15, 16). (Definitions of each geographic boundary are\ngiven in SI Appendix.)\nTwo assessments are available in the PHDCN to measure vo-\ncabulary and reading skills; both assessments have been validated\nand used extensively in previous research using the PHDCN to\ncapture key verbal/language skills important for social interaction\nand academic achievement (17\u00ad19). The first assessment is a\nvocabulary subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for\nChildren-Revised (WISC-R) in which scores are normed to re-\nflect performance relative to a national sample of children of the\nsame age, with the normalized scale designed to have a mean of\n10 and SD of 3 (20). The second assessment is a letter and word\nreading subtest from the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT3).\nScores again are normed to reflect performance relative to a na-\ntional sample of children of the same age; the normalized scale is\ncapture dimensions of cognitive skill that are strongly predictive\nof later educational attainment, labor market success, health, and\nFigs. 1 and 2 show a series of point estimates representing the\neffect of exposure to a homicide within African-American child-\nren's neighborhoods, using three successively larger geographic\nlevels of analysis: block groups, census tracts, and neighborhood\nclusters. Estimates for Hispanics are null in almost every specifi-\ncation and thus are not shown but are available in SI Appendix.\nFrom left to right, the figures show the effect of a homicide that\nnitive assessment.\nFig. 1 displays results using the WISC-R vocabulary score as the\ndependent variable, and Fig. 2 displays results using the WRAT3\nreading score as the dependent variable. From Fig. 1, exposure to\na homicide in the block group that occurred within 4 d before the\nassessment reduces African-Americans' WISC-R scores by 1.40\npoints (P < 0.10), an effect that is marginally significant at con-\nventional levels. The estimated effect of exposure to a homicide\nwithin a week before the assessment is more precise and indicates\nthat a homicide in the child's block group within a week before the\nWISC-R assessment reduces a child's score by 1.52 points, slightly\nmore than 0.5 SD (P < 0.01). Estimated effects of exposure to\nhomicides in the block group occurring more than a week before\nthe assessment are nonsignificant. The effects of exposure to\na homicide in the child's census tract or neighborhood cluster that\noccurred within 4 d before the assessment are negative and sta-\ntistically significant, but each estimate is substantially smaller in\nmagnitude than the effect of a homicide occurring in the block\ngroup. As the duration of time between the homicide and the as-\nsessment increases, the estimated effects of homicides in the census\ntract and the neighborhood cluster are weak and nonsignificant.\nResults shown in Fig. 2 indicate that living in a block group\nwhere a homicide occurred within 4 d before the assessment\nreduces African-Americans' scores on the WRAT3 by 9.72 points\n(P < 0.10), an effect size that is substantively large (0.65 SD) but\nonly marginally significant because of imprecision in the estimate.\nThe estimated effect of exposure to a homicide in the block group\nwithin a week before the assessment also is substantively large but\nLength of time between assessment andhomicide\n)\n=\nd\ns\n(\ne\nz\ni\ns\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\nE\nBlock group Tract Neighborhood cluster\nFig. 1.

Coefficient values are shown for all block group estimates and for significant estimates at all levels. Sample sizes: Block group\nis estimated imprecisely and is not significant. As the time win-\ndow between the homicide and the assessment extends beyond\na week, the effect size again becomes smaller, a pattern that is\npresent for both assessments and at all levels of analysis. Homi-\ncides occurring in the child's census tract or neighborhood cluster\nhave nonsignificant effects on WRAT3 scores regardless of the\nduration of time between the homicide and the assessment.\nAlternative estimates based on kernel-weighted local linear\nregressions suggest a temporal pattern to the results in which the\neffect of local homicides is most severe in the period immediately\nfollowing the homicide and diminishes in a linear manner as the\nperiod between the homicide and the assessment widens. Roughly\n9 d after the homicide the effect size approaches zero and fluc-\ntuates around zero thereafter. (Details are given in SI Appendix.)\nAlthough the analytic approach is designed to be robust to se-\nlection bias by making comparisons within neighborhoods, the\nassumption of exogenous variation in the recency of local homi-\ncides could be violated if there is systematic heterogeneity among\nAfrican-American children living within the same neighborhood\nwho were assessed at different times. Additional analysis pre-\nsented in SI Appendix assesses whether there are observable dif-\nferences in caregiver or child characteristics among children living\nin the same neighborhood who were or were not exposed to local\nhomicides in the period before the assessment. Results reveal no\nsystematic heterogeneity in any key caregiver characteristics or in\nchildren's self-reported violent activity or school performance/\nengagement.\nResults presented to this point are based on a relatively small\nnumber of children who were assessed within a short period\nfollowing a local homicide in their neighborhood; with this lim-\nitation in mind, replications of the analysis are essential before\ndrawing strong conclusions. This section describes results from\na replication using data from the Chicago sample of the Three\nCity Study of Welfare, Children and Families (http://www.icpsr.\nnal study of low-income families living in three cities (Boston,\nChicago, and San Antonio) that began in 1997. The Three City\nStudy includes an independent sample from the same city as the\nPHDCN sample--Chicago--and the timing of the survey over-\nlaps with the timing of the PHDCN, reducing the possibility that\nperiod effects may obscure comparisons of results from the two\nsurveys. The Three City Study conducted assessments of cogni-\ntive skills based on a letter-word identification subtest and an\napplied problems subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-\nEducational Battery-Revised (29). The availability of both as-\nsessments allows for a test of whether the pattern of results is\nuniquetoverbal/readingskillsortospecific featuresoftheWISC-R\nor WRAT3 assessments used in the PHDCN. The primary draw-\nback of the Three City Study Chicago sample is the small sample\nsize and, as a result, the imprecision of estimates. Results displayed\nbelow are based on 180 African-Americans in the sample.\nFigs. 3 and 4 display results from specifications that replicate\nthose presented in Figs. 1 and 2, using the Woodcock-Johnson as-\nsessments as dependent variables and the Three City Study Chicago\nsample. The two measures of cognitive skills are regressed on an\nindicator for whether the child was assessed within a given time\nframe relative to a local homicide in the census tract of residence,\nincluding neighborhood fixed effects and calendar year and month\nof year fixed effects. Separate models are estimated for African-\nAmericans and Hispanics, and whites and members of other race/\nethnic groups are excluded. Similar to the PHDCN, estimated\neffects are null for Hispanics and are not shown in the figures.\nResults for African-Americans displayed in Figs. 3 and 4 repli-\ncate the pattern of strong negative effects of local homicides oc-\ncurring in close proximity to the assessment, although estimates are\nimprecise and the patterns are not identical to those found in the\nPHDCN. Fig. 3 indicates that exposure to a homicide in the child's\nblock grouphasnegativeeffects on letter-word scores,althoughthe\nconfidence intervals are wide, and only the effect of a homicide\noccurring within a week before the assessment is marginally sig-\nnificant.\u00a7 Estimated effects of homicides within the census tract are\nmuch stronger. Exposure to a homicide in the child's census tract\nwithin 4 d before the assessment reduces scores on the letter-word\na homicide within a week before the assessment reduces scores by\nmicide and the assessment expands beyond a week, the effect sizes\nare smaller but remain significant at conventional levels.\nFig. 4 shows negative, nonsignificant effects of homicides oc-\ncurring within the block group on applied problems scores.

Coefficient values are shown for all block group estimates and for significant\nestimates at all levels. Sample sizes: Block group estimates are based on 342 assessments among 177 respondents; census tract and neighborhood cluster\nTo maximize precision of the estimates, neighborhood fixed effects are used instead of\nneighborhood by survey wave fixed effects, which are used in the analysis based on the\nPHDCN. Identification in the neighborhood fixed effects approach is based on variation\nin exposure to local homicides among children living within the same neighborhood\n(block group, census tract, or neighborhood cluster), regardless of the survey wave in\nwhich the interview was conducted. Allowing for comparisons across survey waves im-\nproves the precision of estimates and is less problematic in the Three City Study because\nthe first and second waves of the survey were conducted over a very short time span,\nranging only from 1999 to 2001. Results are substantively the same using neighborhood\nby survey wave fixed effects. Additional details of the analysis and the Three City Study\ndataset are available in SI Appendix.\n\u00a7The anomalous positive effect on applied problem scores of homicides within the block\ngroup occurring within 14 d before the assessment (Fig. 4) is driven by two outlying cases\nwho scored roughly 4 SD above the mean on the applied problems subtest and were\nassessed 14 d after a local homicide in the block group. When these two cases are removed\nfrom the sample, the pattern of results resembles that found for other specifications.\nSOCIAL\nSCIENCES\nsize remains large and statistically significant for homicides oc-\ncurring in the census tract within 10 d before the assessment.\nAlthough estimates based on the Three City Study Chicago\nsample are less precise than estimates based on the PHDCN,\nresults from kernel-weighted local linear regressions reproduce\nthe temporal pattern found in the PHDCN (SI Appendix). At\neach level of analysis, the effect of local homicides is most severe\nwhen the homicide occurred in close proximity to the assess-\nment, and the effect declines in a linear pattern as the time\nbetween the homicide and the assessment widens.\nDiscussion\nEvidence from two independent samples of children in Chicago\nshows that exposure to a local homicide within a short period\npreceding a cognitive assessment reduces performance sub-\nstantially, a finding that is present among African-Americans but\nnot Hispanics. The magnitude of the effect varies depending on\nthe sample, the assessment, the proximity of the homicide to the\nchild's residence, and the length of time that passes between the\nhomicide and the assessment. In the PHDCN, exposure to a ho-\nmicide within the block group that occurs within a week before the\nWISC-R vocabulary assessment reduces scores by roughly 0.5 SD,\nand exposure to a homicide within the block group that occurs\nwithin 4 d before the assessment reduces WRAT3 reading scores\nby 0.66 SD. In the Three City Study Chicago sample, exposure to\na homicide within the census tract that occurs within a week be-\nfore the assessment reduces Woodcock-Johnson letter-word\nscores and applied problems scores by 0.66 to 1 SD, although\nthese estimates have wide confidence intervals.\nIn each case, the estimated effects of recent local homicides are\nsubstantial, suggesting that local homicides have a nontrivial\nacute effect on African-American children's performance on\ncognitive tests that fades as the window of time between the ho-\nmicide and the assessment widens. In the PHDCN sample, the\neffect of a homicide appears strongest when the homicide occurs\nclose to the child's home, within the block group of residence, and\nis smaller for homicides that occur within the census tract or the\nneighborhood cluster. In the Three City Study, the geographic\npattern is less clear because the estimates at the block group level\nare extremely imprecise; the strongest effects are found at the\ncensus tract level, and there are no effects at the level of the\nneighborhood cluster.\nCollectively, the results provide evidence that local violence\nweighs on the minds of children as they approach cognitive\nassessments, but the mechanisms producing lower levels of cog-\nnitive performance are not testable with the available data. The\npattern of findings is consistent with the literature on acute stress\ndisorder, which is defined as a response to a threatening event that\ninduces fear, helplessness, or horror. Among other symptoms are\nreduced awareness and difficulties with concentration for a period\nlasting at least 2 d and up to 1 mo after the stressor (30\u00ad34). Al-\nthough this definition aligns fairly closely with the patterns pre-\nsented, the absence of effects for Hispanics complicates any simple\ninterpretation of the likely mechanisms. It is not clear, for instance,\nwhy local homicides would generate acute stress among African-\nAmericans and not among Hispanics. One possible explanation is\nthat homicides may be less salient or less threatening in the lives of\nHispanics because the victims of homicides are frequently African-\nAmerican.\u00b6 By contrast, homicide victims in African-Americans'\nneighborhoods are almost always of the same race. Unfortunately\nthe data do not have sufficient power to detect interactions by race/\nethnicity of victim, and the racial/ethnic difference in the effect of\nlocal homicides remains an unexplained finding that warrants\nadditional research.\nWith this caveat in mind, this study provides evidence for\nacute effects of community violence that is robust to selection\nbias, a central problem faced by the observational literature on\nexposure to violence and community disadvantage more broadly\n(35\u00ad39). The identification strategy developed here addresses\nthe selection bias problem by exploiting variation in the recency\nof local homicides arising from the relative timing of interview\nassessments and local homicides among children in families that\nhave selected the same neighborhood. Importantly, the method\nis designed to capture only the acute impact of homicides and by\ndesign does not provide any information on permanent impacts\non cognitive development. Still, the analysis of acute effects may\nhave implications for understanding long-range inequality if one\nconsiders the spatial concentration of homicides and the preva-\nlence of violent events within specific communities. As an ex-\nample, if the findings from this analysis are simplified and one\nassumes that homicides within the census tract impair cognitive\nfunctioning for roughly 1 wk, calculations based on the PHDCN\nsample indicate that about 15% of African-American sample\nmembers spend at least 1 mo out of a year functioning at a low\nlevel purely because of local homicides. According to the same\ncalculations, African-American sample members living in the\ncity's most violent neighborhoods spend at least one quarter of\nthe year, or roughly 1 wk out of every month, functioning at a low\nlevel because of local homicides.\nThus, although the analysis is limited to the identification of\nacute effects, these calculations indicate that in the most violent\ncommunities youth frequently may navigate daily life within\nLength of time between assessment andhomicide\n)\n=\nd\ns\n(\ne\nz\ni\ns\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\nE\nBlock group Tract Neighborhood cluster\nFig. 4.

An additional implication of the results is that the\nimpact of violence is not limited to those victimized or those who\ndirectly witness an act of violence but is felt by children across\na community who live in close proximity to extreme violent\nevents. This finding has implications for efforts to mitigate the\nharmful consequences of exposure to violence. Whereas reviews\nof the literature have led to calls for interventions designed to\nprovide treatment or counseling for children directly exposed to\nviolence within the home, school, or neighborhood environment\n(4), the current findings suggest the need for a broader recog-\nnition of the impact that violence can have on children living in\nthe area, regardless of whether they witness violence directly or\nare personally victimized.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe PHDCN is a longitudinal study of families with children that in three\ninterview waves has collected extensive information on child development,\nincluding assessments of vocabulary/reading skills among adolescents. The\nsample is representative of families with children living in Chicago in 1995.\nFamilies were followed wherever they moved over a period ranging from late\ninterview waves, allowing researchers to link families to their residential\nlocation through restricted-use files. The second source of data is a geocoded\nfile identifying the location where the homicide occurred and the date of\nevery homicide reported by the Chicago Police Department from 1994\nthrough 2002. Neighborhoods are operationalized using three successively\nlarger nested boundaries: block groups, census tracts, and neighborhood\nclusters (definitions of each geographic boundary are provided in SI Ap-\npendix) (15, 16). Cognitive assessments in the PHDCN were given to children\nchildren in age cohorts 3, 6, 9, and 12 y at wave 3 of the survey. Sample\nmembers from age cohort 18 y of the PHDCN are excluded in all waves, and\nsample members from age cohort 15 y are excluded in wave 3 because they\nreceived a different assessment designed for adults. Children in the final\nsample range in age from 5 to 17 y.\nBy using the merged data file children's vocabulary and reading scores are\nregressed on an indicator for a recent homicide in the census tract, with tract\nby survey wave fixed effects,k as in Eq. 1:\nYi\n\u00bc  \u00fe \u00f0Homicide\u00de\ni\n\u00fe \n\u00c0\nWave \u00d7 Tract\u00de\ni\n\u00fe \n\u00c0\nYear\u00de\ni\n\u00fe \n\u00c0\nMonth\u00de\ni\n\u00fe i\nwhere Yi\nis child i's score on one of two assessments of cognitive skills, Wave\nand Tract represent census tract by survey wave indicators, Year and Month\nrepresent calendar year and month of year indicators, and Homicide is an\nindicator taking on a value of unity if the child's assessment was conducted\nwithin a given period after a homicide in the census tract;  represents the\neffect of a local and recent homicide on the child's cognitive assessment\nscore. To adjust SE for possible clustering of error terms within individuals\nassessed more than once, all results reported in the main text use the Huber/\nWhite sandwich estimator.\nThe inclusion of tract by survey wave fixed effects means that the esti-\nmator relies entirely on variation in the relative timing of individual\nassessments and local homicides within a given census tract and within\na particular survey wave. This method drops from the analysis sample\nmembers located in neighborhoods in which there is no variation in ex-\nposure to homicides within a given survey wave. For example, in the\nspecification testing for effects of homicides in the census tract that occur\nwithin 7 d before the assessment, individuals would be dropped from the\nanalysis if none of the sample members within the tract were assessed\nwithin a week after a local homicide or in the unlikely case that all sample\nmembers within the tract were assessed within a week after a local\nhomicide. In either case, there would be no variation in exposure to a local\nhomicide among sample members within the census tract. In census tracts\nwhere some sample members were sampled within a week after a homicide\nand others were not, those assessed within a week after the homicide\ncompose the treatment group, and those not assessed within a week after\na homicide compose the control group. Calendar year indicators are in-\ncluded to control for period effects. Month of year indicators are included\nto address the possibility that the time of year in which sample members are\nassessed could produce a spurious association between exposure to local\nhomicides and cognitive performance. This spurious association might\noccur because homicides are more common in the summer months, and\nresearch shows that students score lower on standardized assessments\nwhen school is out of session (40).\nThe replication analysis is conducted with the same methods using the\nChicago sample of the Three City Study of Welfare, Children, and Families. The\nThree City Study collected information from a sample of low-income families\nliving in low-income neighborhoods, including assessments of cognitive skills\nbased on a lette-word identification subtest and an applied problems subtest\nfrom the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (29). The\nsample comprises families with a focal child in one of two age ranges (as of\nwave 1): age 0\u00ad4 y or age 10\u00ad14 y. The current analysis is based on focal\nchildren in the older age range, all of whom were eligible for the Woodcock-\nJohnson assessments at both wave 1 and wave 2 of the survey.\nData from the PHDCN and the Three City Study are accessible through the\nInter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research.\n"
