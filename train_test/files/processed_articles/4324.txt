It is estimated to affect about 2%\nof the population (Bowles et al., 2009; Kennerknecht, Gru\nKennerknecht, Ho, & Wong, 2008) and is characterized as a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nface recognition without any deficits in low-level vision or intelligence (Behrmann & Avidan,\n2005). Face perception is an increasing subject of interest for research, and investigating\nprosopagnosia is one way of gaining a better understanding of how the human recognition\nsystems works.\nTwo main aspects of face perception put faces apart from most other objects: (1). Faces\nare recognized at the individual level (identification); (2). They are processed holistically.\nWhile identification is a clear concept, what exactly is meant with the term ``holistic\nprocessing'' is not well defined and there are numerous controversies about the use of the\nterms holistic and configural processing (e.g., McKone & Yovel, 2009; Maurer, Le Grand, &\nfollowing the definitions given by Maurer, Le Grand, and Mondloch (2002, p. 255):\nHolistic processing is defined as a perceptual phenomenon ``glueing together the features\ninto a gestalt'' and the concept configural processing refers to ``processing second-order\nrelations (i.e., the spacing among features).'' We also use the concept of featural\nprocessing to refer to processing the features of the face (e.g., the shape, color and texture\nof the eyes, mouth, nose, etc.). Finally, we view holistic processing as relying at least in part\non configural and featural processing.\nDifferent experimental approaches exist to measure holistic processing, for example, the\npart-whole test (Tanaka & Farah, 1993), the composite face test (Young, Hellawell, & Hay,\n1987), or the manipulation of configural and featural information of faces (Le Grand et al.,\n2006; Yovel & Duchaine, 2006). The extent to which these approaches measure the ``same''\nholistic processes was examined by several studies applying different holistic face recognition\ntests to the same participants. While DeGutis and colleagues were able to find a significant\ncorrelation between the part-whole test and the composite face test (Degutis, Wilmer,\nMercado, & Cohan, 2013), a study by Wang and colleagues did not find such a\ncorrelation (Wang, Li, Fang, Tian, & Liu, 2012). Therefore, the question whether the tests\ntap into the same holistic mechanisms is yet to be answered. However, in both studies the\nperformance in either test was significantly correlated to face recognition performance,\nconfirming previous findings of a correlation between holistic processing and face\nindividuation (Richler, Cheung, & Gauthier, 2011).\nNot only face identification but also holistic, configural and featural processing are\nbelieved to be impaired in congenital prosopagnosia. However, controversy reigns as\npsychophysical studies differ in their findings. While several studies found evidence for\nweaker holistic processing (Avidan, Tanzer, & Behrmann, 2011; Palermo et al., 2011), other\nstudies reported that only one of their respective prosopagnosic participants showed reduced\nholistic processing (Le Grand et al., 2006; Rivolta, Palermo, Schmalzl, & Williams, 2012).\nSimilarly, evidence of reduced configural or featural sensitivity varies depending on the\nstudies (see Lobmaier, Bo\nevidence of an impairment and Le Grand et al., 2006 for contradictory findings). Other\ndeficits of face processing in developmental prosopagnosia are also subject of debate. For\nexample, some studies found impaired gender recognition in congenital prosopagnosics (Ariel\n& Sadeh, 1996; Duchaine & Nakayama, 2006a), while others reported gender recognition to\nbe normal (Chatterjee & Nakayama, 2012). Also, some, but not all prosopagnosic\nparticipants show impairments in object recognition (Kress & Daum, 2003; Le Grand\nIn short, the picture of a very heterogeneous disorder, even across prosopagnosics\nbelonging to the same family, emerges from these results (Le Grand et al., 2006; Lee et al.,\nevident even when accounting for differences in experiment and stimulus design and needs\nclarification. Further, a better characterization of prosopagnosia might help gain a better\nunderstanding of face processing. For these reasons, we tested face perception in congenital\nprosopagnosia in more details. We developed new tests assessing so far untested aspects of\nface perception (e.g., the influence of strategy usage on test results) as well as aspects for\nwhich controversial results exist in literature (e.g., gender recognition). In addition, we\nincluded two widely used tests for reference, the Cambridge Face Memory test (CFMT,\nDuchaine and Nakayama, 2006b) and the Cambridge Car Memory Test (CCMT, Dennett\nThis paper contains two main parts. The first is a detailed performance analysis of\nprosopagnosic and control participants on several psychophysical tests, allowing to deepen\nthe understanding of the heterogeneous appearance of prosopagnosia. We report and\ncompare the performance of a group of 16 congenital prosopagnosics to the performance\nof 21 matched controls in seven tests. Our tests aimed at measuring holistic face processing,\nconfigural and featural face processing, processing of faces in motion, strategy usage when\nrecognizing faces, face gender recognition, and object recognition. For each test separately,\nwe will present motivation, methodological details, results, and discussion. The second part\nexamines test reliability. To verify the quality of our newly created tests, we calculated their\nreliabilities and compared reliabilities values of old and new tests across participant groups.\nThose data are discussed in view of participants' performance for the tests presented in the\nfirst part. The paper ends by a general discussion of our findings and their implications.\nGeneral Methods\nProcedure\nThe experiments were conducted in two sessions lying about 2 years apart: On average, 24.6\nmonths (SD \u00bc 2.3) for prosopagnosics and 20.3 months (SD \u00bc 1.6) for controls. During the\nfirst session, participants performed the CFMT, test number 1, a surprise recognition test\n(number 3), and a similarity rating test (5). The second session included the CCMT, 2, the\ncomposite face test (4), a gender recognition test (6), and a facial motion advantage test (7).\nIn both sessions, participants could take self-paced breaks between the experiments.\nAll participants were tested individually. The experiments were run on a desktop PC with\n2400 screen. The CFMT and CCMT are Java-script based; the other experiments were run\nwith Matlab2011b (The MathWorks Inc., n.d.) and Psychtoolbox (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner,\nEsins et al. 3\nBrainard, & Pelli, 2007). Participants were seated at a viewing distance of approximately 60\ncm from the screen. The procedure was approved by the local ethics committee.\nParticipants\nWe tested 16 congenital prosopagnosic participants (from now on referred to as\n``prosopagnosics'') and 21 control participants (``controls'') matched as closely as possible\nto the prosopagnosic participants in terms of age and sex (see Table 1).\nAll participants provided informed consent. All participants had normal or corrected-to-\nnormal visual acuity, but we did not formally assess color perception, contrast sensitivity,\nstereoscopic vision or other neuropsychological measures or personality traits (e.g., autism).\nAs no brain imaging was available to exclude the presence of brain lesions, we relied on\nparticipants' self-testimonies or parents' testimonies. To provide an objective measure of face\nprocessing abilities and to maintain comparability with other studies, we tested all\nparticipants with the CFMT. Individual results and z-scores are given in Tables 2 (raw\nscores) and 3 (z-scores) for prosopagnosics and Tables 4 (raw scores) and 5 (z-scores) for\ncontrols. Tables 2 to 5 also contain the raw scores and z-scores of all other tests reported in\nTable 1.

Z-scores for both groups were calculated based on the results of the control\nparticipants.\nProsopagnosics. The prosopagnosics were diagnosed by a semi-structured interview\n(Kennerknecht et al., 2008; Kennerknecht, Plu\n\u00a8 mpe, Edwards, & Raman, 2007; Stollhoff,\nJost, Elze, & Kennerknecht, 2011), approved by the ethical committee of the University of\nMu\n\u00a8 nster, Germany, protocol No 3XKenn2. All prosopagnosics were compensated with 8\nEuro per hour plus travel expenses.\nControls. All controls were compensated with 8 Euro per hour. The controls did not\nparticipate in the full diagnostic interview but in a questionnaire and reported to have no\nproblems in recognizing faces of their friends and family members.\nAnalysis\nThe description of the dependent variables is given for each test individually. All analyses\nwere conducted with Matlab2011b (The MathWorks Inc.) and IBM SPSS statistics Version\n20 (IBM Corp. Released 2011). Analysis of variances (ANOVAs) and their effect sizes (2)\nand linear regressions were calculated with IBM SPSS statistics Version 20. T tests and their\neffect sizes Cohen's d (d), Mann\u00adWhitney U tests and tests' internal consistency reliability\ncoefficients were calculated with Matlab2011b.\nWhere possible, tests reliability was calculated as Cronbach's alpha with the function\ncronbach.m for Matlab (Leontitsis, 2005). Furthermore, we calculated reliability with the\nsplit-half method and subsequent adjustment with the Spearman\u00adBrown prediction formula\nfor all tests: The trials of a test are split into halves (e.g., first half versus second half, or odd\ntrials versus even trials). Then the mean score of each half is calculated for each participant.\nThe correlation between participant's mean half scores gives an estimate of the test reliability\n(Davidshofer & Murphy, 2005). We adapted this method by bootstrapping: Test trials were\nsplit randomly into halves, followed by correlation of the mean half scores. This procedure\nwas repeated 100,000 times. The median of these bootstrapped correlations was then adjusted\nto the tests full length with the Spearman\u00adBrown prediction formula (Brown, 1910;\nSpearman, 1910). Statistical difference between prosopagnosics' and controls' reliability\ncoefficients for Cronbach's alpha was calculated based on the Fisher\u00adBonett approach\n(Bonett, 2003;1 Formula (2)). Statistical difference between prosopagnosics' and controls'\nsplit-half reliability coefficients was calculated as statistical difference between correlation\ncoefficients (Fisher, 1921). This was done for the uncorrected reliability coefficients (i.e.,\nbefore applying the Spearman\u00adBrown prediction formula).\nReaction times of correctly answered trials were also analyzed. For space reasons, we do\nnot report them as they confirm all accuracy data and therefore do not add any additional\ninformation.\nTests\nCFMT\nMotivation. The CFMT was created and provided by Duchaine and Nakayama (2006b). It is a\nwidely used test to characterize prosopagnosics (Kimchi, Behrmann, Avidan, & Amishav,\n2012; Rivolta, Palermo, Schmalzl, & Coltheart, 2011) and to assess holistic face recognition\nabilities. The CFMT has been confirmed to have a high internal consistency reliability with a\nCronbach's alpha between .8 and .9 in different studies (Bowles et al., 2009; Herzmann,\nEsins et al. 9\nDanthiir, Schacht, Sommer, & Wilhelm, 2008; Wilmer et al., 2010). We used this test as an\nobjective measure of face recognition abilities of our participants, expecting reduced\nrecognition abilities for the prosopagnosic group, and to allow comparison with other studies.\nStimuli and task. As this test has been described in detail in the original study (Duchaine &\nNakayama, 2006b), only a short description is given here. Portraits of male Caucasians serve\nas stimuli. The participants were familiarized with six target faces, which they then had to\nrecognize among distractor faces in a three-alternative-forced-choice task. Difficulty was\nincreased stepwise during the test by changing viewpoints and lighting conditions and\nadding noise. Participants had to decide for each image whether the face had been seen\nbefore or not by pressing the relevant keys on the keyboard. The next image appeared as\nsoon as an answer was entered. No feedback was given and no time restrictions were applied.\nThe test can be run in an upright and inverted condition. We only used the upright condition.\nIn our setting, the stimuli faces had a visual angle of 5.7 horizontally and vertically.\nResults. We calculated the overall recognition performance as the percentage of correctly\nrecognized faces per participant. Figure 1 depicts the mean scores per group. Controls\ncorrectly recognized 81.0% (SD \u00bc 9.4) of the test faces, while prosopagnosics scored\n54.8%, (SD \u00bc 5.9). The difference between groups was significant (one-way ANOVA:\nDiscussion. Prosopagnosics showed a significantly reduced face recognition ability compared\nto controls. This result reflects the impaired holistic face processing and face memory of\nprosopagnosic participants and replicates findings of many previous studies (e.g., Bate\nCCMT\nMotivation. The CCMT (Dennett et al., 2011) is a test similar in format and structure to the\nCFMT. We used the CCMT to test for potential general object recognition deficits. We did\nFigure 1.

CFMT \u00bc Cambridge Face Memory Test.\nnot expect to find recognition deficits for prosopagnosics in this control task, as only few\nprosopagnosics might show object recognition deficits which are less severe than their face\nDennett and colleagues found a significant correlation between the scores of their CCMT\nand participants' general interest in cars and knowledge of car makes and models. Therefore,\nwe ran an additional test for car expertise after completing the CCMT, to be able to account\nfor this possible influence and correct the CCMT scores for car expertise.\nStimuli and task--CCMT. As a detailed description is given in the original study (Dennett et al.,\n2011), we give only a short description here. The experimental design is similar to the CFMT,\nwith pictures of whole cars serving as stimuli. The participants were familiarized with six\ntarget cars, which they then had to recognize among distractor cars in a three-alternative-\nforced-choice task. Difficulty was increased stepwise during the test by changing viewpoints\nand lighting conditions and adding noise. Participants had to decide for each image whether\nthe car had been seen before or not by pressing the relevant keys on the keyboard. The next\nimage appeared as soon as an answer was entered. No feedback was given and no time\nrestrictions were applied. The test can be run in an upright and inverted condition. We\nonly used the upright condition.\nStimuli and task--Car expertise. Sixteen cars from the CCMT (four target and twelve distractor\ncars) were presented one after the other to the participants along with three answer choices of\npossible car makes and models (see Figure 2). Participants had to indicate the correct answer\nby pressing the relevant keys on the keyboard. The next image appeared as soon as a response\nwas entered. No feedback was given and no time restrictions were applied.\nThe car images in both tests had a visual angle of 5.7 horizontally and 11.4 vertically.\nFigure 2. Example trial of the car expertise set. Participants had to pick the correct answer among three\nwritten car names.\nResults. The performance measure in both tasks was the percentage of correctly recognized\ncars per participant. Figure 3 depicts the mean scores per group and task. For the CCMT, the\ncontrol participants correctly recognized 77.5% (SD \u00bc 12.9) of the cars, and prosopagnosics\nFor the CCMT, there was no significant difference in scores between prosopagnosics and\ncontrol group exhibited significantly greater expertise in car models than the prosopagnosics\ncontrolling for the car expertise. For this, we ran a linear regression with car expertise scores\nas predictor. The residuals of the regression did not differ significantly between groups (one-\ndiffer between groups after controlling for car expertise. (Combination of both groups'\nregression model was possible, as groups' regression coefficients were not significantly\nDiscussion. We found no difference in car recognition performance on the CCMT between\ncontrols and prosopagnosics on the groupwise level. This replicates findings of previous\nstudies (McKone et al., 2011; Shah, Gaule, Gaigg, Bird, & Cook, 2015). Even though our\ncontrol group contained significantly more car experts, we also could not find significant\ndifferences in the CCMT scores between controls and prosopagnosics after correcting for car\nexpertise. Furthermore, given the fact that no prosopagnosic scored less than 1.81 SD below\nthe mean recognition performance of controls for the CCMT (see Table 3), there was no\nindication that our prosopagnosic participants had general object recognition deficits, at least\nin our laboratory conditions.\nFigure 3.

(b) Mean percentage of correctly identified cars models for controls and prosopagnosics.\nError bars: SEM. CCMT \u00bc Cambridge Car Memory Test.\nSurprise Recognition Test\nMotivation. Because of their difficulty at recognizing faces, prosopagnosics rely on\ncompensatory strategies to identify people. They report using voice, hairdo, blemishes, or\nindividual forms of face features (Dalrymple et al., 2014; Gru\n\u00a8 ter, Gru\nMayer & Rossion, 2009) and use similar strategies in face recognition tasks in laboratory\nconditions (Duchaine, Parker, & Nakayama, 2003). We developed a test designed to try to\nbypass these strategies. In the first part of our test, participants were first asked to name facial\nexpressions performed by various actors (implicit learning phase), thus directing their focus\nto the facial expressions rather than to the identity of the actors. Afterwards, participants had\nto complete a surprise recognition task of the actors' faces. Thus, at test we expected to\nmeasure prosopagnosics' face recognition abilities without the interference of their usual\nstrategies, as they did not focus on detecting identification-helping characteristics during\nimplicit learning. This first part was followed by a second, control part with a similar\nparadigm, but with the difference that participants knew that a face recognition test would\nfollow the presentation of the facial expressions (explicit learning phase). If prosopagnosics\ndid not engage their usual compensatory strategies to remember the faces during the implicit\nlearning phase (first part) but did so during the explicit learning phase (second part), we\nwould expect them to show better performance at test after explicit learning. More\nimportantly, we would expect prosopagnosics to exhibit a stronger recognition\nimprovement between the two test parts than the control group, because then\nprosopagnosics could actively use their strategies to compensate their impaired holistic\nprocessing, while we expected controls to engage holistic processing in both parts.\nStimuli. The stimuli were derived from videos from our in-house facial expression database\n(Kaulard, Cunningham, Bu\n\u00a8 lthoff, & Wallraven, 2012). The database consists of videos of\nmale and female actors performing different emotional and conversational facial expressions\n(e.g., disgust, considering, being annoyed, etc.) without speaking. Frames extracted from one\nof the expression videos are shown in Figure 4(a).\nFigure 4. (a) Some consecutive frames of a video of an actor showing the facial expression ``I don't know.''\n(b) Example stimuli for the test phase: Static images used for testing the participants after training with\ndynamic videos.\nA set of 16 videos was used for the implicit learning phase and another set for the explicit\nlearning phase. In each set, four different target actors (two male and two female) were\ndepicted, each showing four different facial expressions. Both the exhibited expressions\nand the actors' identities differed in both sets. The videos had a mean length of 2.7 s\n(SD \u00bc 1.5). In each test phase, we used 16 static images of the target actors (see\nFigure 4(b)). These images were taken from different videos not presented to the\nparticipants before. As distractors, we used 16 static images taken from 16 new videos\nwith new actors (four images each for two male and two female distractors). All videos\nand images were frontal views of the faces and had a visual angle of 4.8 horizontally and\n6.7 vertically. Different expressions and actors were shown in the first and second part to\navoid interference. The assignment of the targets and distractors to the first or second part of\nthe experiment was randomized across participants.\nTask. In the first part, during the implicit learning phase, participants saw 16 videos: four\ntarget actors (two male and two female), each performing four different facial expressions\nthat participants had to name. The order of the videos was pseudorandom such that no actor\nwas seen twice in a row. Participants had to start each video per key press and could watch it\nonly once. After each video, they typed in their interpretation of the facial expression\n(maximum 80 characters). No feedback was given. After this implicit learning phase,\nparticipants performed a surprise old\u00adnew recognition task. For this, the participants saw\n32 different images: Four images from each of the four target actors and four images from\nfour new distractor actors. Participants had to decide for each image whether the actor had\nbeen seen during the learning phase or not by pressing the relevant keys on the keyboard.\nStimuli were presented for 2 s or until key press, whichever came first. The next image\nappeared as soon as an answer was entered. The order of the pictures was pseudorandom,\nsuch that no actor was seen twice in a row. No feedback was given. All participants reported\nthat they had not anticipated the surprise recognition task after the expression naming.\nThe second part was conducted to control for the effect of surprise. The design was similar,\nwith the difference that participants knew that an old\u00adnew recognition task would follow the\nexplicit learning phase. Again, the participants watched 16 videos of four different actors.\nThis time they did not need to name the facial expressions but could concentrate on\nremembering the appearance of the actors. Afterwards they once more had to recognize\nthe actors among the distractors.\nResults. For each participant, we calculated the d 0-scores as Z(hits)--Z(false alarms).\nFigure 5(a) depicts the mean scores per group. Controls achieved a mean d 0-score of 2.09\n(SD \u00bc 0.88) in the first, surprise part and 2.66 (SD \u00bc 0.91) in the second part. Prosopagnosics\nsecond part. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA of the factors participant group\n(prosopagnosics, controls) and test part (first, second) was conducted on the d 0-scores.\nRecognition performance was significantly higher in the second part compared to the first,\nProsopagnosics and controls performed significantly above chance level (prosopagnosics\nd > 2.48). However, ceiling effects were present for the controls in the second part, as 33% of\nDiscussion. Overall, controls discriminated between old and new faces significantly better than\nthe prosopagnosics in both parts. Importantly, we could not find a difference between groups\nin their performance improvement in the second part as shown by the absence of an\ninteraction. This finding indicates that, contrary to our prediction, prosopagnosics did not\nexhibit a stronger recognition improvement between the two test parts compared to controls\n(e.g., by adapting their strategy). The ceiling performance of the controls reinforces this\nobservation: It may have led to underestimate the improvement between test parts for\ncontrols, yet the improvement for prosopagnosics between test parts was still not bigger\nthan for the controls. Because prosopagnosics' performance was significantly above chance\nlevel in the first, surprise part, we conclude that they extracted and stored identity-relevant\ninformation even when not paying attention to that information. We suggest two equally\npossible explanations. First, contrary to our hypothesis, prosopagnosics had engaged their\nstrategies not only during the explicit but also during the implicit learning phase. They were\nthus able to extract and store featural characteristics even without conscious effort. The\nsecond possible explanation is that prosopagnosics' recognition system does not differ\nfundamentally from that of the controls in so far that in both groups the mechanisms of\nholistic processing and extracting identification-relevant information seem to occur\nautomatically in explicit as well as in implicit learning conditions. These automatic\nmechanisms are exhibited by prosopagnosics, yet are reduced compared to controls. In our\nnext experiment, we investigate whether indeed holistic processing abilities are still present,\nthough in reduced form in prosopagnosics.\nComposite Face Test\nMotivation. Several studies state that the key to a well-functioning face recognition system lies\nin holistic face processing. Holistic processing is defined as the integration of all facial\ninformation, for example, shape of nose, mouth, and eyes (features) and their spatial\ndistances (configuration). This information is combined into a whole gestalt, making it\nFigure 5. (a) Mean d 0-scores in the surprise recognition task for controls and prosopagnosics. Error bars:\nSEM. (b) Ceiling effects for the control participants in the second part of the surprise recognition task.\nharder to process the information individually (Maurer et al., 2002). A classical test for\nholistic processing is the composite face task. When the top half of one face is combined\nwith the bottom half of a different face, both halves are merged into a new, third identity. The\ncombined face halves are processed holistically as a whole, making it difficult to retrieve the\nidentity of the halves individually. This effect disappears when the halves are misaligned. In\nthe composite face task, participants have to indicate if one half (mostly the top half\ncontaining the eyes) is the same in two, consecutively shown composite faces. As the lower\nhalf interferes with the perception of the upper half, neurotypical participants make more\nmistakes when the halves are aligned than when they are misaligned. This effect can also be\nmodulated by the choice of the bottom halves: Neurotypical participants make more\nmistakes when the bottom halves are incongruent to the top halves (i.e., top halves are\nidentical and bottom halves differ and vice versa) than for the congruent case (i.e., either\ntop halves are identical and bottom halves are identical, or top halves differ and bottom\nhalves differ). Our expectations were that in this task evidence of holistic processing would be\ngenerally weaker for prosopagnosics than for controls.\nWe used the ``complete design'' version of this experiment (Cheung et al., 2008). In the\ncomplete design, holistic processing is indexed by an interdependence of congruency and\nalignment: Performance is better in congruent than in incongruent trials (i.e., congruency\neffect). Misalignment reduces the congruency effect, as it disrupts holistic processing. We use\nthis version of the experiment because it has been suggested that it may better separate face-\nspecific from non-face-specific effects than the ``classic'' design (for recent findings supporting\nthis view, see Meinhardt, Meinhardt-Injac, & Persike, 2014, but controversy about this\nquestion is ongoing, see e.g., Rossion, 2013). Following McKone and colleagues' advice\n(McKone et al., 2013), we tested the composite face effect in upright and inverted\nconditions. The inverse condition, like misalignment, also disrupts holistic processing.\nTherefore, inversion in interdependence with congruency also measures holistic processing:\nThe congruency effect is larger for upright than inverted trials.\nStimuli. The stimuli were created from 12 images of female faces taken from the in-house 3D\nface database (http://faces.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/; Troje & Bu\n1999). All images were gray-scale and luminance-equalized, so that the upper and lower half\nof different faces could be combined without obvious color or luminance differences. To\ncreate composites, the faces were cut into top and bottom parts along the center of the\nimage. Bottom and upper face halves were rearranged according to the design of the\nexperiment described below. The composite faces were surrounded with an oval, black\nmask to cover differences in the outer face shape. Moreover, a horizontal, two pixels\nthick, black line covered the border between the two halves (see Figure 6). The faces were\npresented with a visual angle of 2.9 horizontally and 3.8 vertically.\nIn each trial, two composite faces were presented sequentially for 0.3 s each with an inter-\nstimulus interval of 0.4 s. The inter-trial interval was 2 s, resulting in an overall trial length\nof 3 s. When no face was presented, a fixation cross was shown at the center of the image.\nParticipants were instructed to keep their gaze at the position of the fixation cross all the time,\neven when a face was presented and the cross was not visible.\nFor the ``same'' condition, the top half (comprising the eyes) of the first composite face\nwas the same as the top half of the second face within the same trial. In the ``different''\ncondition, the two top halves differed. In the congruent condition, the bottom halves were\nsame if the top halves were same or they were different if the top halves were different. In the\nincongruent condition, the bottom halves were different if the top halves were the same and\nvice versa. In the aligned condition, top and bottom halves were placed exactly on top of\neach other. For the misaligned condition, the top half was displaced to the right, while the\nbottom part was displaced to the left such that the middle of one half was placed adjacent to\nthe edge of the other half. All face images were presented upright for the upright condition or\nrotated by 180 for the inverted condition.\nThe combination of upright or inverted condition with aligned or misaligned conditions\nwas tested in four separate blocks. The block order was balanced across participants. Each of\nthe four blocks contained 120 trials: 30 trials of each combination of same and different trials,\nand congruent and incongruent trials. The order of trials was randomized.\nTask. In each trial, participants had to indicate whether the two face halves comprising the\neyes were the same or not. Participants responded during the inter-trial interval of 2 s by\npressing the relevant keys on the keyboard. No feedback was given. After every 20 trials and\nalso between blocks participants were able to take a self-paced break. Before testing, there\nwere 10 training trials for each of the four different blocks. Blocks were trained in the same\norder as they would appear during the actual testing.\nResults. For each participant we calculated the d 0-scores as Z(hits \u00bc accuracy in same trials)\u00ad\nZ(false alarms \u00bc 1\u00c0accuracy in different trials). The congruency effect was calculated by\nsubtracting d 0-scores of incongruent from congruent conditions. Figure 7 depicts the mean\ncongruency effects per group. In the upright condition controls obtained a mean congruency\nprosopagnosics obtained a mean congruency effect of 0.65 (SD \u00bc 0.61) for aligned and\n0.31 (SD \u00bc 0.48) for misaligned trials. In the inverted condition controls obtained a mean\nwhile prosopagnosics obtained a mean congruency effect of \u00ad0.11 (SD \u00bc 0.46) for aligned and\nAs misalignment and inversion are both control conditions for the measurement of holistic\nprocessing, we consider these two factors separately. First, we looked at the congruency effect\nFigure 6. Example stimuli of the composite face task.\nfor the upright condition only, using misalignment as control condition. A two-way repeated\nmeasures ANOVA on participant group (prosopagnosics, controls) and alignment (aligned,\nmisaligned) was conducted. The congruency effect was larger for the aligned than the\nbetween alignment and participant group was significant, indicating that the congruency\neffect was more affected by misalignment in the control group than for prosopagnosics\ntheir congruency effect was significantly smaller for the misaligned than aligned condition\nprosopagnosics exhibit evidence of holistic processing for upright faces.\nSecond, we looked at the congruency effect for the upright-aligned versus the inverted-\naligned conditions only, using inversion as control condition. A two-way repeated measures\nANOVA for the aligned condition on orientation (upright, inverted) and participant group\n(prosopagnosics, controls) was conducted. As expected, the congruency effect was larger for\nThe interaction between orientation and group was non-significant, indicating that the\ninversion factor did not affect prosopagnosics and controls differently (F(1, 35) \u00bc 0.23,\nAdditionally, we investigated more closely the negative congruency effect observed for\nprosopagnosics in the inverted-aligned condition (see Figure 7(b)). The congruency effect was\nsignificantly smaller for aligned than misaligned trials in the inverted condition for\nDiscussion. The congruency effect in interdependence with (a) alignment or (b) orientation\nserves as a measure of holistic processing. For the upright condition, using (a) misalignment\nFigure 7.

(b) Mean size of the congruency effect in the inverted condition for controls and\nprosopagnosics. Error bars: SEM.\nas control condition, we found that controls showed a larger difference in congruency effect\nfor aligned versus misaligned trials compared to prosopagnosics. These results suggest that\nholistic processing is impaired or utilized to a smaller extent by prosopagnosics in this task.\nThis replicates the results of previous reports of decreased holistic processing for\nImportantly, the difference in congruency effect for aligned versus misaligned trials is\nsignificant for prosopagnosics, which indicates that their holistic processing ability is still\npresent yet impaired.\nWhen we used (b) the inversion effect (upright-aligned versus inverted-aligned conditions\nonly) to assess holistic processing, no significant difference between groups appeared (non-\nsignificant interaction). Thus, we did not find differences in holistic processing between\ngroups, which is contrary to the expectations given by our design. Furthermore, our\nresults also imply that prosopagnosics show more holistic processing for misaligned face\nhalves than aligned halves when seen inverted. Similar ``inversion superiority effects'' for\nprosopagnosics have been described before (Behrmann, Avidan, Marotta, & Kimchi, 2005;\nde Gelder, Bachoud-Le\nHowever, what exactly happens when prosopagnosics process inverted faces is currently not\nwell understood. For this reason, the results in the inverted condition should not be seen as a\ntrue indicator of holistic processing for prosopagnosics. We would argue that the advice to\nrun the composite face effect in upright and inverted conditions (McKone et al., 2013) is not\nsuitable for testing prosopagnosics. Nevertheless, the fact that the controls showed the\nexpected pattern in the inverted condition (small congruency effects with no difference\nbetween alignment conditions) supports the general validity of this method.\nIn sum, if we concentrate on the upright condition that can be clearly interpreted,\nprosopagnosics, compared to controls, show a smaller difference between the congruency\neffects obtained in the aligned and misaligned condition. This indicates that holistic\nprocessing (as indexed by the interdependence of congruency and alignment) is present but\nimpaired for prosopagnosics.\nThe composite task is generally regarded to be the best method to assess holistic face\nprocessing. There are many other methods (see e.g., Piepers & Robbins, 2012) which are used\nto investigate holistic processing. Whether they measure the exact same mechanisms as those\ninvolved in the composite task and how those different mechanisms might relate to one\nanother are still open questions. To get a closer and more detailed look at the impairment\nof holistic processing in prosopagnosia, we tested what type of facial information retrieval is\nimpaired in the study described next.\nFeatural and Configural Sensitivity Test\nMotivation. Our test using the composite face task revealed that holistic processing is impaired\nin prosopagnosics. It is debated whether holistic processing relies exclusively on configural\nprocessing or whether featural appearance (part-based contribution) might be involved as\namong others). Investigating prosopagnosics' sensitivity to configural and featural facial\ninformation might shed some light on this issue. To that end, we generated a stimulus set\nof natural looking faces with parametric differences in features and configuration for a fine-\ngrained investigation of the sensitivity of prosopagnosics and controls to featural and\nconfigural facial information.\nStimulus creation and task have been described in details elsewhere (Esins, Schultz,\nWallraven, & Bu\n\u00a8 lthoff, 2014). Therefore, we will give only a short description here.\nStimuli. We manipulated male faces from our in-house 3D face database to create eight face\nsets. Different faces were used for each set. In each created set, the faces differed in features\n(eyes, nose, and mouth) or their configuration, but they shared the same skin texture and\nouter shape (see Figure 8). Skin texture and outer shape of each set differed from the others.\nChanges in features and in configuration were implemented parametrically, resulting in five\nsimilarity levels from 100% (identical faces) to 0% (maximal difference within each set)\nbetween the faces. The central faces of both dimensions (features and configuration) are\nidentical for each set. In a previous study (Esins, Bu\nappearance of these faces has been controlled.\nThe stimuli had a visual angle of 5.7 horizontally and 8.6 vertically. To prevent pixel\nmatching, the faces were presented at different random positions on the screen within a\nviewing angle of 7.6 horizontally and 10.5 vertically.\nTask. Participants rated the perceived pairwise similarity of the faces within each set on a\nLikert scale from 1 (very little similarity) to 7 (high similarity/identical). They were advised to\nuse the whole range of ratings during the experiment. In each trial, the first face was displayed\nfor 2 s, followed by a pixelated face mask for 0.8 s, and then the second face for another 2 s.\nAfterwards, the Likert scale was displayed and participants marked their rating by moving a\nslider on the scale via the arrow keys and confirmed their choice by pressing the relevant key\non the keyboard. The start position of the slider was randomized. The next trial started as\nsoon as the rating was confirmed. There were no time restrictions, but participants were told\nto answer without too long considerations. After every 20 trials, participants could have a\nself-paced break.\nThe faces of each set were compared with each other and with themselves. We were only\ninterested in trials comparing faces manipulated along the same dimension (see Figure 8(a)\nfor features and (b) for configuration). Filler-trials in which faces differed in both features\nand configuration were displayed during the test to avoid participants realizing the nature of\nthe stimuli. These filler-trials were omitted from the analysis. For each participant, the order\nof trials was randomized within and across sets.\nFigure 8. Faces of one set, (a) differing in features while their configuration stays the same and (b) differing\nin configuration while their features stay the same. Skin texture and outer face shape were kept constant\nwithin each set. The middle faces of both rows are the same.\nResults. For each participant, we calculated the mean ratings for each of the five similarity\nlevels across all sets, but separately for each change type (featural, configural). Similarity\nratings were close to seven (high similarity) for identical faces and dropped with decreasing\nsimilarity. For each participant, we fitted a linear regression to the mean similarity ratings,\nagain separately for featural and for configural ratings. The similarity levels served as\npredictors. The steepness of the slopes was then used as measure of sensitivity: The steeper\nthe slopes, the stronger the participant perceived the configural or featural changes.\nFigure 9 depicts the mean sensitivity scores per group. Controls obtained a mean sensitivity\nProsopagnosics obtained a mean sensitivity score of 1.09 (SD \u00bc 0.20) for featural and 0.51\n(SD \u00bc 0.23) for configural changes. We analyzed the sensitivity scores with a two-way\nrepeated-measures ANOVA with the factors change type (features, configuration) and\nparticipant group (prosopagnosics, controls). Participants exhibited a higher sensitivity\nprosopagnosics showed an overall reduced sensitivity compared to controls (F(1, 35) \u00bc 9.34,\np \u00bc .004, 2 \u00bc .21). The interaction between change type and participant group was\nDiscussion. The use of parametric stimuli in our tests allowed a more fine-grained\nquantification of potential configural and especially of featural processing impairment in\nprosopagnosics than most other studies. We morphed facial features (eyes, nose, and\nmouth) between two faces in several steps in each set in terms of their color and shape,\nthus creating faces differing gradually for these features. In contrast, most other studies\nonly exchanged features between faces. Furthermore, we took care to use faces without\nmake-up and all our stimuli had been controlled for their naturalness (for details, see\nEsins, Bu\nWith these stimuli, our results show that the sensitivity to configural and featural\ninformation is significantly impaired for prosopagnosics compared to controls. It is\nnevertheless worth noting that we carried out a more detailed analysis of our findings in the\nframework of a previous study (Esins, Schultz, et al., 2014) that was based partly on the data\npresented here. That analysis had shown that configural sensitivity was significantly impaired,\nwhile featural sensitivity was only marginally significantly impaired for prosopagnosics in\ncomparison to controls. This finding might indicate that featural information in congenital\nprosopagnosics is less clearly impaired than configural information.\nFigure 9. Mean sensitivity to features and configuration for controls and prosopagnosics. Error bars: SEM.\nFor comparison, Le Grand and colleagues found prosopagnosics to have a significantly\nlower accuracy than controls for faces modified in configuration, but not for faces modified in\nfeatures (Le Grand et al., 2006). This result was confirmed by Yovel and Duchaine (2006)\nwho used the same stimuli to test prosopagnosic participants. However, these authors\ncriticized these stimuli for the presence of make-up increasing the saliency of the eyes and\nlips besides the manipulation of the shape and the distance between features. This critique\nwas addressed in a study that used faces without make-up (Mondloch, Robbins, & Maurer,\n2010), which confirmed the higher sensitivity to features than to configuration. When Yovel\nand Duchaine (2006) tested their participants with other faces wearing no make-up, they\nfound that prosopagnosics showed a reduced sensitivity to both types of information (Yovel\n& Duchaine, 2006). Note, though, that their face stimuli without make-up were criticized for\nhaving configural modifications beyond natural limits (as discussed in Maurer et al., 2007). It\nwas also shown that prosopagnosics obtained significantly lower recognition scores than\ncontrols for both featural and configural information in another study using blurred\n(disrupted featural information with intact configural information) and scrambled\n(disrupted configural information with intact featural information) face stimuli (Lobmaier\nThe results of the composite face test and the featural and configural sensitivity test\nindicate that not only holistic processing but also the retrieval of configural information is\nimpaired in prosopagnosics. Further, the retrieval of featural information might be impaired\nto a lesser degree than configural information as indicated by our previous study based on the\nsame stimuli. In sum, the results of the composite face test and the featural and configural\nsensitivity test in this study support the view that deficits in holistic processing in congenital\nprosopagnosia are due to deficits not only in configural but also at least in part, in featural\nprocessing.\nGender Recognition Test\nMotivation. Most prosopagnosics self-report normal recognition of the gender of faces\n(Gru\n\u00a8 ter, Gru\n\u00a8 ter, & Carbon, 2008) which is also reflected by the results of behavioral\nstudies (Chatterjee & Nakayama, 2012; DeGutis, Chatterjee, Mercado, & Nakayama,\n2012; Le Grand et al., 2006). Nevertheless, there are some single-case studies which report\nprosopagnosics' gender recognition to be impaired (Ariel & Sadeh, 1996; De Haan &\n2001). In view of those conflicting reports, we aimed at clarifying this issue.\nStimuli. We used 80 faces (40 male) from our in-house 3D face database. As visible in\nFigure 10, the faces contained no extra-facial cues (e.g., hair, beard, or makeup) about\ntheir gender. The stimuli had a visual angle of 3.8 horizontally and 5.7 vertically.\nTask. Participants had to judge the gender of each face. The faces were shown one at a time\nand stayed on screen until a response was given by pressing the relevant keys on the\nkeyboard. The next image appeared as soon as a response was entered. The order of trials\nwas randomized. No feedback was given. Participants were instructed to answer as correctly\nand as quickly as possible.\nResults. For each participant, percent correct accuracy was calculated. Figure 11 depicts the\nmean scores per group. Controls achieved a very high mean accuracy of 91.5% (SD \u00bc 4.8),\nwhile prosopagnosics scored very well too at 84.4% (SD \u00bc 5.9). Nevertheless,\nprosopagnosics performed significantly worse than controls as revealed by a one-way\nDiscussion. Prosopagnosics exhibited a significantly lower gender recognition ability\ncompared to controls. This differs from the self-reports of prosopagnosics (Gru\n\u00a8 ter et al.,\n2008) and also from behavioral tests in several studies (Chatterjee & Nakayama, 2012;\nDeGutis et al., 2012; Le Grand et al., 2006). However, there are some single case studies\nof prosopagnosics which report impairments of gender recognition (Ariel & Sadeh, 1996; De\nknowledge, our study is the first to report an impairment in gender recognition on a\nFigure 11. Mean percent correctly classified faces in the gender recognition task for controls and\nprosopagnosics. Error bars: SEM.\nFigure 10. Example of female and male faces used as stimuli for the gender recognition task.\ngroupwise level for prosopagnosics. In our test, we observed high performance for the control\ngroup and comparatively high performance for the prosopagnosics. We argue that first,\nprosopagnosics suffer from only a slight impairment of gender recognition and second,\nthat this impairment may be easily compensable in daily life by using cues like body\nshape, hairdo, makeup, voice, etc. Our conclusion that an impairment in gender\nrecognition is only slight and easily compensable is supported by the fact that controls and\nprosopagnosics achieved ceiling performance in gender recognition tests in several further\nstudies (Dobel, Bo\n\u00a8 lte, Aicher, & Schweinberger, 2007; Gruber, Dobel, Jungho, & Jungho\n\u00a8 fer,\n2011; Lobmaier et al., 2010). In our study, we used well-controlled stimuli derived from real\nfaces. It is possible that this type of stimuli and our large sample size helped to reveal the\ngender recognition deficit in prosopagnosics. Along this line, another study which also used\nfaces of the same 3D face database showed impaired same-or-different recognition\nperformance for faces differing in gender for their prosopagnosic participants (Behrmann\nFacial Motion Advantage Test\nMotivation. Most studies testing holistic face recognition abilities of prosopagnosics use only\nstatic face stimuli. Furthermore, those face images often are identical for training and testing.\nSuch tasks do not reflect the everyday challenges encountered by prosopagnosics, as people\nmove, speak, and might alter their look on a day-to-day basis. On the one hand, the different\nlooks of people might complicate recognition for prosopagnosics maybe even more than for\ncontrols who do not rely on these non-facial attributes for recognition. On the other hand,\nthe additional dynamic information might give additional cues for prosopagnosics, thus\nfacilitating recognition (motion advantage). Again, this advantage may potentially be even\nstronger for prosopagnosics than for controls who do not need to rely on this additional\ninformation for recognition. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the influence of appearance\n(e.g., hairstyle, makeup) and motion on face recognition for prosopagnosics compared to\ncontrols, by using dynamic stimuli in which the same people changed their look between\nlearning and test. We also included static stimuli and faces that did not change their\nappearance (identical stimuli) as control conditions. We expected that, for the identical\nstimuli, the prosopagnosics would retain their usual compensatory strategies, while for the\nchanged stimuli they would make more use of the dynamic information.\nStimuli. The stimuli used in this test have been created and kindly provided by O'Toole and\ncolleagues (O'Toole et al., 2005) and only a short description is given here. Recordings of 72\nactresses speaking into the camera, expressing natural rigid and non-rigid movements served\nas dynamic stimuli (Figure 12(a)). The static stimuli displayed five random frames from the\noriginal recordings, shown for 1 s each and separated by a black screen for 0.2 s (Figure 12(b)).\nActresses were shown only in one of both conditions (static or dynamic) during the task. There\nwere two recordings of each actress. In the second recordings, the actresses had a different\nhairdo, makeup, or accessories (see Figure 12(c)). These different recordings with a changed\nlook were also prepared as dynamic and static stimuli, respectively.\nAll stimuli presented the faces for 5 s and were mute. Each actress was placed in front of a\ngray background and her clothing was covered. The stimuli had a visual angle of 16.6\nhorizontally and 12.4 vertically.\nTask. The experiment consisted of two blocks. In one block, dynamic stimuli were used for\nlearning and testing, and static stimuli were used in the other block. The block order was\ncounterbalanced between participants. In each block, participants first learned 18 target\nidentities and then performed an old\u00adnew recognition test on these 18 target identities\nintermixed with the same number of distractor identities. Half of the targets were identical\nduring learning and at test (identical stimuli) while for the other half of the targets the second\nrecording was presented at test (changed stimuli). Participants were informed that the look\nmight change between learning and testing. The order of trials was randomized during\nlearning and testing. Which target actresses were tested in the identical or changed\ncondition was counterbalanced across participants. During learning and testing\nparticipants could see each stimulus only once. During testing, the stimuli were presented\nas long as described above or until key press, whichever came first. The next stimulus started\nas soon as an answer was entered by pressing the relevant keys on the keyboard. No feedback\nwas given. Between blocks participants were able to take a self-paced break.\nResults. We calculated d 0-scores for each participant.

Prosopagnosics achieved a mean d 0-score of 1.87 (SD \u00bc 0.74) for dynamic\nstimuli and 1.85 (SD \u00bc 0.61) for static stimuli. For the changed condition, controls\nstatic stimuli.

For the identical condition, we found a statistically better\nstatistically better performance for controls than prosopagnosics (F(1, 35) \u00bc 15.62,\np < .001, 2 \u00bc .31). Interaction between stimulus type and participant group was significant\n(dynamic, static) revealed that controls performed better for dynamic than static stimuli in\nno difference between dynamic and static stimuli for prosopagnosics (Fs \u00bc 0.02, p \u00bc .92,\nFor the changed condition, there was no performance difference for static versus dynamic\nDiscussion. The first finding of this test is that controls and prosopagnosics showed a similar\ndrop in recognition performance when the appearance of a person changes compared to the\nidentical condition. Therefore, with this design, we did not find evidence that prosopagnosics\nare more affected than controls when unfamiliar faces change appearance between learning\nand testing.\nSecond, we found that controls, but not prosopagnosics, showed a facial motion\nadvantage when tested with identical stimuli. These results are in line with a study which\nalso tested prosopagnosics with dynamic and static face stimuli in an old\u00adnew recognition\ntask with faces presented either upright or inverted (Longmore & Tree, 2013). In that study,\nprosopagnosics showed no significant difference in performance for dynamic and static\nstimuli in the upright condition, while controls performed better for the dynamic stimuli.\nLongmore and colleagues' interpretation was that the task was too difficult for the\nprosopagnosics, making it impossible to detect a facial motion advantage for this group\nFigure 13. (a) Mean d 0-scores for the identical condition for controls and prosopagnosics. Error bars: SEM.\n(b) Mean d 0-scores for the changed condition for controls and prosopagnosics. Error bars: SEM.\nbecause of a floor effect (mean accuracy rates of the prosopagnosics were about 60% for both\nstatic and dynamic upright stimuli, with the chance level being 50%). Similarly, we find no\nmotion advantage for prosopagnosics in the identical condition. However, our task did not\nseem to be too difficult: Prosopagnosics showed mean d 0-scores between 1.0 and 2.0, with\nd' \u00bc 0 corresponding to chance level. Therefore, we argue that our results provide a valid\nmeasure of the absence of a motion advantage for prosopagnosics.\nIn the changed condition, when appearance changes between learning and test, both\ngroups showed no difference in recognition performance between static and dynamic\nstimuli. This is contrary to our expectations that prosopagnosics would rely more on\ndynamic information than controls in this condition. It is worth noting that, in an earlier\nreport of that test, we had found a significant interaction between participant group and\nmotion information, with a significant motion advantage for controls in both conditions\n(Esins, Bu\n\u00a8 lthoff, & Schultz, 2014). At that time, we had analyzed recognition performance\nof the same 16 prosopagnosic participants and 16 of the 21 controls reported here, matched\nto the prosopagnosics in age and gender as closely as possible. Therefore, we suggest, that a\nlarger sample size is needed to verify the robustness of this finding.\nFurther support for the lack of a motion advantage for prosopagnosics reported here is\ngiven by a study reporting impaired biological motion perception for face, but not whole-\nbody stimuli for congenital prosopagnosic participants (Lange et al., 2009).\nTaken together, these previous studies and our results hint at a lack of a motion advantage\nfor prosopagnosics. This could be explained by a neurophysiological dysfunction in\nprosopagnosia that affects not only the ventral temporal face-processing regions but also\nthe lateral temporal facial motion-processing regions, in particular the superior temporal\nsulcus (Hoffman & Haxby, 2000), a core region of the face processing network (Ishai,\nSchmidt, & Boesiger, 2005). The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) was found\nto have a significantly reduced connectivity with the other core regions of the face processing\nnetwork in prosopagnosics (Avidan et al., 2013). This finding is in accordance with the fact\nthat we find no motion advantage for prosopagnosics tested in our study.\nReliabilities\nAs our study included newly developed tests, we assessed their reliability by calculating the\nreliability scores for each participant group separately. The reliability is an indicator of the\ntest's internal consistency quality: In a test with high reliability, all trials involving the same\nface recognition mechanisms give similar results. We calculated the internal consistency\nreliability with Cronbach's alpha. For consistency reasons, this was done for all tests, also\nfor the established tests CFMT and CCMT, especially as this has never been calculated for\nprosopagnosic populations. However, for the surprise recognition test and the facial motion\nadvantage test, Cronbach's alpha could not be calculated, because participants saw different\nstimuli, depending on assignment. For this reason, we also calculated the reliability coefficient\nwith a bootstrapped split-half method with Spearman\u00adBrown correction. This method is\nmathematically related to Cronbach's alpha and can be applied to all our tests. Both\ncoefficients gave similar results, validating the calculation (see Table 6). Additionally, we\ncalculated the statistical difference between controls and prosopagnosics for either\nreliability coefficient. For Cronbach's alpha, this was calculated based on the Fisher\u00ad\nBonett approach (Bonett, 2003). For the split-half reliability coefficients, it was calculated\nas statistical difference between correlation coefficients (Fisher, 1921). The p values are given\nin Table 6 as well. Many of our tests comprised of several parts testing different aspects of\nface recognition (cars test (3.2), surprise recognition test (3.3), composite face test (3.4),\nTable 6.

Reliability coefficients were calculated\nwith bootstrapped Spearman\u00adBrown adjusted split-half method and, where possible, with Cronbach's alpha. Statistical significance of difference between groups' reliability coefficients\nwas calculated as difference between correlations for unadjusted split-half reliability coefficients and with the Bonett formula for Cronbach's alpha (Bonett, 2003). The ratio between\nprosopagnosics and controls reliability coefficients was calculated by dividing controls reliability coefficients by prosopagnosics reliability coefficients.\n* Statistically significant p values\nfeatural and configural sensitivity test (3.5), facial motion advantage test (3.7)). Therefore, we\ncalculated Cronbach's alpha and split-half estimate for the different test parts separately.\nFor Cronbach's alpha, coefficients of more than .7 indicate acceptable to excellent\nreliability (Lance, Butts, & Michels, 2006; Nunnally, 1978). For controls, reliability\ncoefficients close to .7 and higher (and mostly larger than .9) were reached in most tests\nparts (see Table 6). For prosopagnosics, most reliability coefficients were similar to those\nobtained by the controls and deviated by less than 20% (i.e., the ratio of reliability\ncoefficients between groups was between 0.8 and 1.2, see Table 6). However, in four tests\nor test parts, prosopagnosics' reliability coefficients conspicuously deviated from controls'\ncoefficients (CFMT (3.1), the surprise condition of the surprise recognition test (3.3), the\nupright-aligned condition of the composite face test (3.4), and the static condition of the\nfacial motion advantage test (3.7)). For the surprise recognition test, the facial motion\nadvantage test and the CFMT, controls exhibited more than two to three times higher\nreliability coefficients than prosopagnosics (i.e., the ratio of reliability coefficients was\nlarger than 2.2. See Table 6). The difference of reliability coefficients between groups\nreached significance for the CFMT and composite face test, but not for the surprise\nrecognition test and the facial motion advantage test.\nA literature search for experimental reliability coefficients for the CFMT found only\nstudies reporting Cronbach's alpha for control participants: Cronbach's alpha \u00bc .83\nalpha \u00bc .89 (Bowles et al., 2009). We were not able to find a study reporting reliability for\nthe CFMT for purely prosopagnosic participant groups. Therefore, we report here for the\nfirst time this interesting result.\nImportantly, all tests reported above for which prosopagnosics showed a conspicuous\ndeviation of their reliability coefficients compared to controls, test for holistic recognition\nof static faces, that is, all tests in which participants had to recognize the identity of whole\nstatic faces. The other tests do not investigate holistic face recognition but rather face\nclassification, featural and configural processing, face parts comparison, object recognition,\nor deal with moving faces. The fact that there is no reduced reliability for recognition of\ndynamic faces in the test for the facial motion advantage could have several causes. One\npossible explanation is that other mechanisms than holistic processing is activated when\nrecognizing dynamic faces, which allows the performance of prosopagnosics to be more\nconsistent. This hypothesis is supported by a study finding that non-rigid face motion\npromotes part-based processing rather than holistic processing in laboratory conditions\nThese reliability results lead us to the following hypothesis. The calculated test reliabilities\nare equivalent to the consistency of response behavior of the participants. It is known that\nprosopagnosics use compensatory, part-based strategies to bypass their limited face\nrecognition abilities in everyday life, but also in test situations (Dalrymple et al., 2014;\ncould be caused by this use of various strategies. Prosopagnosics might switch between\nstrategies, combine several different strategies, or respond at random if they find that none\nof their strategies works, thus causing their inconsistent response behavior as measured by\nthe reliability coefficients. This is in line with a study by McKone et al. (2011), testing control\nparticipants with the CFMT-Australian in upright and inverted version and finding a reduced\nreliability for the later condition. These authors also concluded that holistic processing works\nconsistently for upright faces, while for inverted faces a more variable approach of part-\nbased-processing is adopted. As soon as holistic processing is discarded in favor of part-based\nstrategies, the reliability decreases.\nHowever, we want to provide another possible explanation, namely that some internal\nprocesses for holistic face recognition do not work consistently for prosopagnosics. Our test\nresults do not allow identifying the exact cause for this reduced reliability. Therefore, further\ntesting is necessary, also to verify the robustness of this finding.\nIf indeed strategy usage, random answering, or inconsistent internal processes cause the\nreduced test reliability for prosopagnosics, this raises doubt whether the same perceptual\nprocesses and mechanisms are measured for controls and prosopagnosics and also within the\nprosopagnosics themselves. Because significant performance differences between controls and\nprosopagnosics were observed in at least one part of all face perception tests, we argue that these\ntests are suitable for a coarse comparison of face processing abilities between groups, even\nthough for some tests there are apparently qualitative differences in reliability. However, for\na more detailed analysis of performance levels, for example, at an individual level, the tests\nmight be too unreliable. In addition, the low reliabilities affect correlation analyses between\ntests. The correlation between test performances is restricted by the tests' reliabilities: The\nsquare root of the product of reliabilities of two tests gives an upper boundary to their\ncorrelation (Nunnally, 1970). Correlation analyses are often used to relate different face\nperception mechanisms, for example, if face identification performance is linked to holistic\nHayward, & Bu\n\u00a8 lthoff, 2014). It is also used to examine if similar impairments exist in different\ncases of prosopagnosia (Duchaine, Germine, & Nakayama, 2007; Duchaine, Yovel, &\nNakayama, 2007; Kennerknecht et al., 2007). Our finding therefore is very important for the\nsearch of systematic patterns of impairment and possible common subgroups among\nprosopagnosics. As the low reliability for prosopagnosics adds noise to test results, this\nmight complicate the identification of response patterns and subgroups in prosopagnosia,\nwhich is an actual focus of prosopagnosia research.\nGeneral Discussion\nIn the present study, we compared prosopagnosics to controls by assessing their face and\nobject recognition abilities in a variety of tests. The face tests investigated holistic processing,\nsensitivity to featural and configural information, gender recognition, benefit of motion\ninformation, and the unconscious, automatic extraction of identity information, while two\nadditional tests measured participants' recognition performance for objects. Significant\ndifferences in performance between prosopagnosics and controls were observed in all face\ntests, while both groups did not differ in the object tests. Besides acquiring more detailed\ndescriptions of prosopagnosics' impairments in face recognition (as discussed in each test\nsection), our study also brings to light some fundamental difference in the quality of the\nobtained data. It reveals that classical tests engaging holistic processing might not be\nadequate for prosopagnosic participants although they are well adapted for fine-grained\ninvestigations of face recognition in neurotypical populations.\nProsopagnosics in this study displayed reduced face recognition (CFMT) and normal\nobject recognition (CCMT). More interestingly, we found that prosopagnosics showed\nautomatic retrieval of identity information (surprise recognition test), indicating that their\nunconscious mechanisms for extracting identification-relevant information are still active\nwhenever they view faces. Furthermore, we could replicate the finding that prosopagnosics\nshow limited holistic processing (composite face test), supporting the assumption that holistic\nprocessing is decisive for efficient identification (Farah, Wilson, Drain, & Tanaka, 1998). We\nfurther refined this result by testing the same groups of participants with the featural and\nconfigural sensitivity test, which revealed that especially configural processing, and maybe\nfeatural processing to a lesser extent, are impaired in prosopagnosics. These findings reinforce\nthe hypothesis of involvement of featural and configural processing with holistic processing\nand face identification. Our findings fit very well with recent neuroimaging findings showing\nabnormal brain activation patterns in both core (fusiform face area (FFA), occipital face area\n(OFA)) and extended (anterior temporal) face processing regions (Rivolta et al., 2014) as well\nas disrupted connectivity between those regions (Avidan et al., 2014). In particular, a very\nrecent study revealed impaired configural face processing in the right FFA in prosopagnosics\n(Zhang, Liu, & Xu, 2015), demonstrating that functionality within a central face processing\narea is affected in a manner directly visible behaviorally. In addition to our evidence for\nreduced holistic processing in prosopagnosics, we also showed that they are impaired in\ngender recognition (gender recognition test), confirming previous findings that not only\nface identification but also other basic face discrimination tasks like gender discrimination\nrely on holistic processing (Zhao & Hayward, 2010). To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to show an impairment in gender recognition on a groupwise level. Finally,\nprosopagnosics did not benefit from facial motion when asked to recognize faces, while\ncontrols did (facial motion advantage test). Again, this finding corresponds nicely to the\nneuroimaging studies mentioned above that report reduced connectivity between certain\nbrain areas, especially a reduced connectivity between STS and the core face processing\nregions in prosopagnosics (Avidan et al., 2013).\nThe tests' reliability coefficients obtained for the controls and prosopagnosics reached\ngood levels most of the time. However, for tests of holistic face processing employing\nstatic stimuli exclusively, in particular for the CFMT, prosopagnosics obtained only a\nfraction of the reliability coefficients of controls. We suggest that prosopagnosics use\nvarying strategies (e.g., part-based processing) to compensate for their face recognition\nimpairment, which leads to their inconsistent answering behavior in those tests. While we\nadmit of course that this suggestion is a speculation from our part, the use of strategies by\nprosopagnosics has been widely reported in the literature (DeGutis, Bentin, Robertson, &\nD'Esposito, 2007; DeGutis, Cohan, & Nakayama, 2014). Future studies looking in more\ndetails at prosopagnosics' responses in various tests should allow to uncover more evidence,\nand describe the consequences, of using strategies in tests of face processing.\nThat last finding, reduced test reliability when testing prosopagnosics, has important\nimplications for our current study in particular and for research on prosopagnosia at\nlarge. An additional unsuccessful goal of our current study had been to assess a large\ngroup of prosopagnosics with a variety of tests with the goal of finding subgroups. In\nhindsight, after completion of our study, the general opinion is now that a much larger\nnumber of prosopagnosic participants is needed for finding clear subgroups, owing to\nvarious potential factors introducing noise in the test data, two of them being genetic\ndiversity (Schmalzl et al., 2008) and co-morbidity (Mitchell, 2011). Our findings add a new\nfactor to that list: reduced reliability in tests.\nSummary\nWith our extended battery of existing and newly created tests and our large sample size of\nprosopagnosic and control participants, we were able to refine our knowledge about face\nperception processes in general and for congenital prosopagnosia in particular. Furthermore,\nwe are the first to reveal that the response behavior of prosopagnosics in tests for holistic\nprocessing differs from controls, as indicated by their noticeably reduced test reliability.\nFuture work will need to examine the robustness and cause of this phenomenon.\nAdditionally, better tests need to be designed, with higher reliabilities for prosopagnosics.\nSuch tests would provide more robust results allowing to obtain a more accurate picture and\nbetter classification of the impairment.\n"
