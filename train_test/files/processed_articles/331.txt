Both overweight and obesity\nhave been shown to be inversely related to\nhaving been breastfed, which is also a\npotential protective factor against child-\nhood atopic diseases. The aim of this\nanalysis was to explore the relation of\nbody mass index (BMI) to asthma and\natopy in a large representative sample of\nthe United States population.\nMethods--Children aged 4\u00ad17 years were\nincluded in the NHANES III survey. Preva-\nlences of atopic diseases and potential con-\nfounding factors such as exposure to\nenvironmental tobacco smoke, birth\nweight, breast feeding, and household size\nwere assessed using structured interviews\nwith parents. Height and weight were\nmeasured, and BMI was calculated as\nkg/m2 and transformed into Z scores. Chil-\ndren underwent skin prick tests for atopy to\na battery of food and inhalant allergens.\nResults--The prevalence of asthma (8.7%\np=0.05) rose significantly with increasing\nquartiles of BMI. After adjustment for\nconfounders, a significant positive associ-\nation between BMI and asthma remained\nlowest quartiles of BMI), whereas no\nindependent relation between BMI and\natopy was evident. No eVect modification\nby sex or ethnic group was seen.\nConclusions--The eVects of increased\nBMI on asthma may be mediated by\nmechanical properties of the respiratory\nsystem associated with obesity or by\nupregulation of inflammatory mecha-\nnisms rather than by allergic eosinophilic\ninflammation of the airway epithelium.\n",

In fact, several studies (most of\nthem cross sectional) have shown positive\nassociations of obesity or body mass index\n(BMI) with respiratory symptoms, asthma, and\nairway hyperresponsiveness.3\u00ad10 Little is known\nabout the potential eVects of BMI on the\ndevelopment of atopy. While some studies have\nfound an eVect of BMI on skin test reactivity6\nand the prevalence of allergy,9 others have\nfailed to find an association between BMI and\nhay fever5 or self-reported allergy.7 In studies\nstratified according to sex, associations of BMI\nwith respiratory symptoms and lung function\nhave been more pronounced in women and\ngirls than in men and boys.5 7 10 Inner city\npopulations may be at a higher risk than\nresidents of suburban or rural environments.3 8\nA strong inverse relation between having\nbeen breast fed and BMI has recently been\nfound in children starting school,11 confirming\nprevious reports based on smaller study\nsamples.12 13 Since breast feeding is also a pro-\ntective factor against asthma and atopy,14\nuncontrolled confounding may have biased the\nresults of previous studies.\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) explored\nthe nutritional and health status of a stratified\nrandom sample of a non-institutionalised US\npopulation aged 6 months to 74 years.\nInformation was obtained on BMI, breast\nfeeding status, prevalence of asthma and hay\nfever, and atopic sensitisation as assessed by\nskin prick tests.\nMethods\nThe NHANES III survey, which was con-\nmonths to >80 years. For the purpose of this\nreport, data analysis was restricted to children\nsurvey design and the examination procedures\nhave been published previously.15 Interviewers\nvisited the subjects at home before the medical\nexamination to gather demographic infor-\nmation and elicit a medical history.

The number of\nepisodes of wheeze in the past 12 months, the\nnumber of hospital and emergency room visits,\nthe number of hours the subject watched TV\non the day before examination, and the\nfrequency of play or exercise resulting in\nsweating and breathing hard per week were\nascertained. Moreover, exposure to environ-\nmental tobacco smoke--that is, cigarette smok-\ning by anyone in the household--was deter-\nmined. For children aged 4\u00ad6 years,\ninformation on breast feeding status (whether\nthey had ever been breastfed) and the duration\nof breast feeding was collected.\nHeight and weight were measured and BMI\nwas calculated as kg/m2. Z scores of BMI were\nfurthermore computed as suggested for the\nwebsite: www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/\nnhanes/growthcharts/datafiles.htm). Skin prick\ntests were performed in 6\u00ad17 year old subjects\nat the time of the medical examination by\nteams of technicians trained in standardised\nprocedures. A panel of allergens, including\nAlternaria, bermuda grass, rye grass, ragweed,\nRussian thistle, white oak, cat, German cock-\nroach, mites, and peanuts was administered.\nHistamine and phosphate buVered saline con-\ntrols were also applied. Skin tests were\nperformed on an alcohol prepared arm by\napplying drops of allergen and then pricking\nthe skin under the drops by lifting it lightly with\na 25 gauge BD needle. After 20 minutes the\nlength and width of the flare and weal were\nmeasured. A reaction was defined as positive if\nthe mean of the length and the width of the\nweal was at least 3 mm (with the reaction to the\nnegative control subtracted from that to the\nrespective allergen). Children with a positive\nreaction to any of the 10 allergens tested were\nconsidered atopic.\nData were analysed by multiple linear and\nlogistic regression, using generalised models\nfor intraclass correlation to adjust for random\nsite eVects and normalised weighting of data to\nadjust for the sampling scheme in NHANES\nResults\nThe characteristics of the study population are\ngiven in table 1. The three ethnic groups that\nmade up most of the study sample (non-\nHispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and\nMexican Americans) were represented in simi-\nlar proportions. Approximately half of all\nsubjects were atopic, while 9% had had asthma\nwheeze in the past 12 months, hay fever, and\natopy rose significantly with increasing BMI\n(table 2).\nHaving been breastfed was found to be\ninversely related to BMI as reported previ-\nously.11 After adjustment for potential con-\nfounding factors such as age, sex, ethnicity,\nhousehold size, and exposure to passive smoke,\na significant positive association between BMI\nand the asthma outcomes remained (table 3).\nAdditional controlling for birth weight (which\nwas assessed only in children <12 years of age)\nor breast feeding status (which was assessed\nonly in children <6 years of age) did not change\nthe results (data not shown). With stratification\nfor ethnicity and sex, no eVect modification for\nthe relation between BMI and asthma was seen\n(data not shown). When other measures such\nas waist circumference, arm circumference,\nand thigh skinfold were used as indicators of\nobesity, similar results were obtained (data not\nshown).\nTable 1 Characteristics of study population*\nEthnicity\nBirth weight (g)2\nData expressed as n/N (%) except for BMI which is expressed as\na ratio calculated as kg/m2.\n1Information only availabe on subjects aged 6\u00ad17 years.\n2Information only availabe on subjects aged 4\u00ad12 years.\n3Information only availabe on subjects aged 4\u00ad6 years,\n*A complete data set was not available for every subject.\nTable 2 Prevalence of asthma, hay fever and atopy (%) in children aged 4\u00ad17 years across quartiles of Z scores of body\nmass index (BMI)*\n1st quartile\n2nd quartile\n3rd quartile\n4th quartile\nPrevalence (%) in indicated quartile (Z score of BMI range) given as percentages weighted by the normalised weight variable\n*A complete data set was not available for every subject.\nTest for trend.\n836 von Mutius, Schwartz, Neas, et al\nwww.thoraxjnl.com\ngroup.bmj.com\nthorax.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nAtopic sensitisation, as assessed by skin prick\ntests, was only weakly and non-significantly\npositively related to BMI after adjustment for\nconfounding. With further controlling for birth\nweight the association disappeared (data not\nshown). Moreover, in non-asthmatic children,\nBMI was not related to hay fever and atopy\n(data not shown). Finally, no significant associ-\nation of BMI with serum eosinophil counts was\nseen (table 3). When the association between\nasthma and BMI was further adjusted for\natopy, the eVect of BMI remained virtually\nunchanged (data not shown). No interaction\nbetween atopy and BMI was found.\nNo relation between BMI and the number of\nepisodes of wheeze in the past 12 months was\nfound (table 3). However, the number of emer-\ngency room visits because of asthma was posi-\ntively related to BMI. Among asthmatics only,\nBMI was inversely associated with the number\nof episodes of wheeze but not with the number\nof emergency room visits because of wheeze\n(data not shown). Time spent watching TV\nexercising per week was also not associated\nwith asthma (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nA high BMI was associated with an increasing\nprevalence of asthma in a representative sample\nof the US population aged 4\u00ad17 years after\ncontrolling for potential confounding factors\nsuch as sex, ethnicity, age, household size, pas-\nsive smoke exposure, birth weight, and breast\nfeeding status. No eVect modification by sex or\nethnic group was seen. In contrast, atopy was\nnot related to BMI. The lack of correlation\nwith television viewing hours or frequency of\nphysical exercise suggests that it is obesity per\nse, and not lack of exercise, that is the issue.\nThe cross sectional design of this study does\nnot allow an assessment of the timing of expo-\nsure in relation to the occurrence of asthma or\natopy. Thus, the relation between BMI and\nasthma may reflect the predisposition of an\nasthmatic subject to gain weight because of\nreduced exercise tolerance rather than a causal\nassociation between a high BMI and the incep-\ntion of asthma. However, no association\nbetween the number of episodes of wheezing in\nthe past 12 months and BMI was found. In\naddition, longitudinal data for adults suggest\nthat increases in BMI predict the development\nof asthma in nurses16 and in children.17 It\ntherefore seems highly unlikely that asthma\nleads to obesity.\nIncreasing BMI was related to several meas-\nures of asthma, but not to atopy assessed as\nskin test reactivity. A lack of association\nbetween eosinophil counts and BMI suggests\nthat the eVects of increased BMI may be medi-\nated through factors other than the induction\nof allergic eosinophilic inflammation of the air-\nway epithelium. An increasing body of litera-\nture suggests that obesity is a proinflammatory\nstate.18 Studies in animal models indicate that\nincreased levels of leptin, IL-6, and IL-1 (all\nproinflammatory cytokines) may contribute to\nand upregulate inflammation in the airway,\nindependent of an allergic mechanism.18 Stud-\nies of prior National Health and Nutrition\nExamination surveys showed that individuals\nwith a high BMI have increased peripheral\nblood leucocyte counts which also may reflect\nan upregulation of inflammatory processes.\nMechanical properties of the respiratory sys-\ntem associated with obesity, such as diminished\ntidal lung expansion in overweight individuals,\nmay partially account for these results. Re-\nduced tidal lung expansion compromises force\nfluctuations acting on the airways. Impaired\nforce fluctuations result in greater contractile\nresponses of airway smooth muscle,19 thereby\npotentially causing increased airway respon-\nsiveness, a hallmark of asthma. Although\nairway responsiveness was not assessed in\nNHANES III, a previous study of Taiwanese\nadolescents6 clearly showed a positive eVect of\nBMI, not only on the prevalence of asthma, but\nalso on the presence of airway responsiveness\nas assessed by methacholine challenge. In the\nNormative Aging Study20 physiological studies\nsuggesting that increases in obesity are associ-\nated with increases in methacholine airway\nresponsiveness in adults are consistent with the\nmechanical impact of obesity on airway smooth\nmuscle.\nA strong association between asthma and\natopy has been found in clinical studies where\nover 80% of asthmatic children react to one or\nmore environmental allergens in skin prick\ntests.2 On a population level, however, the rela-\ntion between asthma and atopic sensitisation is\nmuch less clear. In some regions of the world,\nsuch as rural China and rural Ethiopia, the\nTable 3 Relation of quartiles of BMI to asthma and atopy in children aged 4\u00ad17 years after adjusting for potential\nconfounding factors*\n1st quartile\n(reference) 2nd quartile 3rd quartile 4th quartile p value\nValues are odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals adjusted for sex, ethnicity, age, household size, study area, and passive smoke\nexposure.\n*A complete data set was not available for every subject.\nRelation of body mass index to asthma and atopy in children 837\nwww.thoraxjnl.com\ngroup.bmj.com\nthorax.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nprevalence of asthma is low and is unrelated to\nthe prevalence of atopy, whereas in westernised\nareas the prevalence of asthma is higher and\nclosely linked to a high prevalence of atopy.21\nThis discrepancy points to the importance of\ndistinct factors in determining the incidence of\nasthma and atopy.\nWe showed in a German survey11 that\nprolonged breast feeding is a protective factor\nagainst childhood overweight and obesity.\nThese data have been reproduced in this study\nwhich shows an increased risk of obesity in\nchildren not breastfed for at least 5 months.\nRecent studies have suggested a protective role\nof breast feeding against asthma.14 22 If pro-\nlonged breast feeding resulted in less obesity,\nthen increased BMI might be an intermediate\nstep in a causal pathway leading from short-\nened nursing to the development of asthma.\nHowever, the results of multivariate analyses\nincluding breast feeding do not support this\nnotion. Breast feeding was no longer a\nsignificant predictor of asthma once BMI was\nintroduced into the model. However, this may\nbe because the intermediate variable (BMI)\nwas included in the regression.\nBMI may therefore be an independent risk\nfactor for the development of asthma in both\nsexes and across ethnic groups. Appropriate\nstrategies for the reduction of body weight in\nchildren may contribute to a reduced incidence\nof asthma in childhood.\nThe authors thank Diane Sredl for her excellent assistance with\ndata analysis.\nDr von Mutius was supported by a joint grant by the NHLBI\nand the German Ministry for the Sciences and Technology.\n1 Chinn S, Rona RJ.
