Although guidelines suggest that physicians counsel all patients about exer-\ncise, physicians counsel only a minority of their patients. Whether patient factors in-\nfluence physician counseling is not well established.\nObjectives To examine and to identify factors associated with exercise counseling\nby US physicians.\nDesign and Setting National population-based supplemental (Year 2000) survey\nto the 1995 National Health Interview Survey.\nadults had seen a physician in the previous year, and 9299 responded when asked\nabout physician counseling on exercise.\nMain Outcome Measure Physician counseling to begin or to continue to exercise.\nResults Of 9299 respondents, 34% reported being counseled about exercise at their\nlast visit. After adjustment for other sociodemographic and clinical factors, women were\nslightly more likely to be counseled, with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 1.15 (95%\nconfidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.29). Physicians counseled older patients (30 years) more\noften than younger patients; those aged 40 to 49 years were counseled most often (AOR,\nels of physical activity, college graduates, and patients who were overweight to obese\n(body mass index: 25 to 30 kg/m2) were more likely to be counseled, as were patients\nCI, 1.46-2.38]). Counseling did not vary by physician specialty or patient race.\nConclusion The rate of physician counseling about exercise is low nationally. Phy-\nsicians appear to counsel as secondary prevention and are less likely to counsel pa-\ntients at risk for obesity. The failure to counsel younger, disease-free adults and those\nfrom lower socioeconomic groups may represent important missed opportunities for\nprimary prevention.\nthe core survey, which elicited infor-\nmation on sociodemographic factors in-\ncluding occupation, insurance cover-\nage,basichealthstatus,visitsorcontacts\nwith health care providers, days hos-\npitalized, height, and weight. Respon-\ndents also were asked about func-\ntional limitations and whether they had\na usual place for health care, a usual\nhealth care practitioner, and the clini-\ncian's specialty.\nIn addition, a supplemental survey\nistered to 1 randomly selected adult,\naged 18 years or older, from one half of\nrespondents). Respondents were que-\nried about 6 common chronic medical\nconditions (diabetes; asthma, emphy-\nsema, chronic bronchitis, or tuberculo-\nsis; chronic kidney disease; chronic liver\ndisease or cirrhosis; cancer; and chronic\ncardiac-related disease). They were also\naskedabouttobaccouse,attemptstolose\nweight, and their participation in a list\nof leisure or sport activities in the 2\nweeks prior to the interview and the fre-\nquency of participation. Respondents\nwho reported having had a medical\ncheck-up (any visit interpreted by the\nrespondent to be a check-up) within the\n\"During your last (medical) check-up,\ndid the doctor recommend that you be-\ngin or continue to do any type of exer-\ncise or physical activity?\"\nsupplement who reported a medical\ncheck-up within the previous year and\nwho were asked about physician coun-\nseling about exercise were eligible for\nthis study sample. We considered those\nwho reported that their physician ad-\nvised them either to start or to con-\ntinue exercise to have received coun-\nseling.\nUsing information available in NHIS,\nwe defined factors hypothesized to in-\nfluence physician counseling about ex-\nercise. These included patient socio-\ndemographic factors such as age, sex,\nrace, marital status, education, in-\ncome, insurance type, and region of the\ncountry. We also considered clinical\nfactors, such as comorbid illness, over-\nall illness burden (self-reported health\nstatus, number of hospital days in pre-\nvious year, visits or contacts with a\nhealth care provider, difficulty walk-\ning), tobacco use, and body mass in-\ndex (BMI) (defined as weight in kilo-\ngrams divided by square of height in\nmeters). We considered the specialty of\nthe patient's usual health care pro-\nvider (general internist or family prac-\ntitioner; gynecologist; other special-\nist; or other health care provider type)\nand whether the patient had a usual\nplace for health care.\nWe performed bivariable analyses to\ncompare unadjusted exercise counsel-\ning rates across various factors. We fit\nlogistic regression models using back-\nward elimination and the Wald 2 test\nto identify sociodemographic, clini-\ncal, and physician factors associated\nwith physician counseling. Two-\ntailed P.05 was considered statisti-\ncally significant. The final model in-\ncluded all statistically significant\nindependent factors and confounders.\nConfounders were factors that, when\nadded to the final model, altered the re-\ngression coefficients of any significant\nindependent variable by at least 10%.\nWe performed additional analyses to\nexamine the stability of our findings.\nFirst, we adjusted our primary multi-\nvariable model for whether patients\nwere attempting to lose weight at the\ntime of survey administration to ac-\ncount for patient-initiated counseling.\nWe hypothesized that patients who\nwere actively attempting to lose weight\nwould have been more likely to ini-\ntiate counseling with their physicians;\nthis might explain any association be-\ntween physician counseling and fac-\ntors correlated with patients' goals of\nlosing weight, such as BMI and health-\nseeking behaviors. Second, we ad-\njusted for what patients' physical ac-\ntivity levels were in the 2 weeks prior\nto the survey. We classified respon-\ndents into low (sedentary), moderate,\nor high activity level based on a vali-\ndated method described previously.25\nThose who participated in moderate ac-\ntivity (eg, walking, gardening, bowl-\ning) more than 4 times a week or vig-\norous activity (eg, running, swimming,\nplaying tennis) more than 2 times a\nweek were classified as having high\nphysical activity level. Respondents re-\nporting 1 to 4 moderate-level activi-\nties or 1 to 2 vigorous activities a week\nwere classified as practicing moderate\nphysical activity. All others were con-\nsidered sedentary. Third, we exam-\nined the effect of respondent occupa-\ntions on factors associated with\nphysician counseling by performing\nsubgroup analyses for respondents who\nreported occupations involving high\nlevels of physical activity (eg, police or\nfirefighters; cleaning or building servi-\ncepeople; laborers) and in those who\nreported sedentary occupations (eg, ex-\necutives, administrators, or managers;\nscientists; health care providers; teach-\ners, librarians, or counselors; techni-\ncians). This classification was based on\nNHIS-defined categories24; we did not\ninclude categories that could not be\nreadily classified. We were able to clas-\nsify 61% of those eligible who re-\nWe also examined the effect of miss-\ning income data on our model, be-\nour study sample lacked information\nabout income. To obtain an annual es-\ntimate of household income for those\nwith missing data, we multiplied by 12\nthe monthly income imputed by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics based\non age, sex, race, family status, and\nother economic and health character-\nistics.25 We applied our model to this\nlarger sample (including respondents\nwith imputed data) to test the stability\nand generalizability of our findings.\nWe used statistical analysis soft-\nware for proper variance estimation in\nall analyses.26,27 Results were weighted\nto adjust for nonresponse to reflect US\npopulation estimates.

The overall rate of physician\ncounseling about exercise was 34%.\nCounseling rates did not vary signifi-\ncantly by physician specialty (P = .69).\nOf adults who reported a general in-\nternist or family practitioner as their\nusual provider, 35% received counsel-\ning to exercise. If the usual provider was\na gynecologist or a specialist, patients\nreported counseling rates of 36% and\n37%, respectively. Rates of counseling\nalso did not differ by patient sex or race;\nhowever, physicians were more likely\nto counsel patients who were older than\n30 years, who were married, and who\nwere of higher socioeconomic status.\nTABLE 2 shows the clinical charac-\nteristics of the study sample along with\nunadjusted rates of counseling. Physi-\ncians counseled overweight (BMI, 25 to\n30 kg/m2) and obese respondents\n(BMI 30 kg/m2) at higher rates than\nthose with lower BMI (25 kg/m2).\nHowever, physicians were less likely to\ncounsel those who were more seden-\ntary and more likely to counsel respon-\ndents with cardiac disease and diabe-\ntes. Patients who reported frequent\nphysician visits or contacts also were\nmore likely to be counseled.\nTABLE 3 presents factors that were in-\ndependently associated with exercise\nAge remained a significant correlate,\ncounseled most often to exercise.\nWomen were more likely to be coun-\nseled than men, as were patients with\ncation. Patients who were uninsured or\nwho had Medicaid insurance were\ncounseled less often.

Pa-\ntients with cardiac disease and diabe-\ntes were more likely to report counsel-\ning as well. Patients were less likely to\nbe counseled if they were single, used\ntobacco, had difficulty walking, and had\ninfrequent physician visits or contacts\nin the previous year.\nPhysician specialty, previous hospi-\ntalization, perceived health status, and\ncomorbid illnesses other than cardiac\ndisease and diabetes were not indepen-\ndently associated with physician coun-\nseling after multivariable adjustment\nand did not confound the relationship\nbetween independent variables in our\nmodel and physician counseling about\nexercise.\nWhen we adjusted ourfinalmodelfor\nwhetherrespondentswereattemptingto\nlose weight, differences by patient sex\nwere no longer significant (P = .48); the\nothercorrelatesofexercisecounselingre-\nmained statistically significant.

These findings are\nconsistent with results from 1 survey\nthat showed that physicians who esti-\nmated a higher proportion of their pa-\ntients as nonsedentary were more likely\nto counsel.22 The lower rates of coun-\nseling in respondents with lower edu-\ncation and income levels, even after ad-\njusting for access to health care, illness\nburden, and activity level, are particu-\nlarly worrisome, because members of\nlower socioeconomic groups have\npoorer health outcomes.23\nPhysicians' perceptions that coun-\nseling may be ineffective may explain\nthe low rate of physical activity coun-\nseling. Given competing time pres-\nsures and limited resources, physi-\ncians may elect to pursue other, more\nproven preventive measures such as\ncancer screening. Moreover, physi-\ncians may be targeting their counsel-\ning efforts at those most likely to ben-\nefit from exercise. Despite strong\nevidence suggesting that physical ac-\ntivity is beneficial, few data are avail-\nable on the long-term effectiveness of\nexercise counseling. Several studies ex-\namining the efficacy of physician ad-\nvice about exercise have shown posi-\ntive results.11-15 The majority of these\nstudies, however, were not random-\nized or well controlled; many also\nlacked follow-up data beyond a few\nweeks and were limited in generaliz-\nized trials have shown conflicting re-\nPreventive Services Demonstration\nProject, which examined the effect of\npreventive health examinations in an\nelderly population, found no signifi-\ncant increase in physical activity level\nin those randomized to receive exer-\ncise counseling.11 However, a second\nstudy demonstrated a statistically sig-\nnificant increase in exercise activity af-\nter counseling. The OXCHECK trial\nto receive physical activity counseling\nand 5 follow-up visits by trained\nnurses.13 After 3 years, a significantly\nhigher proportion of the intervention\ngroup (32.4%) compared with the con-\ntrol group (29.1%) reported vigorous\nexercise more than once a month.\nFinally, perceptions that counseling\nis less effective in certain patient\npopulations may explain the variable\nrates across certain patient sub-\ngroups. For example, physicians may\nbelieve that counseling patients with\nlower socioeconomic status is less ef-\nfective. Data,however,demonstratethat\nlow-income patients are actually more\nlikely to attempt behavioral change\nbased on physician advice.32\nAlthough we used data from a large,\nnationally generalizable sample, our re-\nsults are subject to recall bias. Some re-\nspondents may not have remembered\ndiscussions with physicians about ex-\nercise even when they occurred. This\nbias would underestimate actual coun-\nseling rates; nevertheless, patients' re-\ncall may be an accurate reflection of the\nquality of physician discussions and the\ninfluence of these discussions on the pa-\ntient. Second, the rate of counseling\nabout exercise we report only repre-\nsents counseling that took place dur-\ning the most recent medical check-up\nand does not necessarily reflect an-\nnual rates, except in patients with only\na single physician visit in the previous\nyear. In patients who had multiple phy-\nsician visits in the previous year, we\nwould not have had access to data about\ncounseling that occurred at an earlier\nvisit. However, those with more fre-\nquent health care provider visits and\ncontacts were more likely to report that\ncounseling took place. Third, we were\nalso unable to differentiate between\nphysician- and patient-initiated coun-\nseling. The correlates of counseling we\nidentified may represent correlates of\nhealth-seekingbehavior.Controllingfor\nwhether respondents were attempting\nto lose weight did not alter our find-\nings substantially, however. We at-\ntempted to adjust for physical activity\nlevel, but the available data referred to\nactivity during the 2 weeks prior to sur-\nvey and not necessarily to baseline ac-\ntivity at the time of the physician visit.\nPatients who receive physician coun-\nseling about physical activity may be\nmore likely to initiate exercise, which\nwould explain our observation that per-\nsons who engaged in more physical ac-\ntivity were more likely to be coun-\nseled. However, given the modest\nefficacyofphysiciancounseling,it is un-\nlikely that this phenomenon com-\npletely explains the lower rates of coun-\nseling in more sedentary patients.\nFinally, we had limited information\nabout clinician characteristics or prac-\ntice beliefs other than specialty.\nOur findings demonstrate that the\nrate of physician counseling about ex-\nercise in the United States is low. Phy-\nsicians often counsel patients to exer-\ncise as a form of secondary prevention\nand undercounsel certain groups at\nhigh risk for obesity, weight gain, and\nsedentary lifestyle. In particular, the fail-\nure to counsel younger, disease-free,\nand sedentary adults and those from\nlower socioeconomic groups might rep-\nresent important missed opportuni-\nties for primary prevention that could\nlead to adverse public health out-\ncomes. Given that the problems of obe-\nsity and sedentary lifestyle have reached\nepidemic proportions in the United\nStates, even modest benefits from rela-\ntively benign interventions, such as\ncounseling to increase physical activ-\nity, may have a substantial public health\nimpact. Additional studies are needed\nto evaluate the effectiveness of physi-\ncian counseling about exercise and the\neffectiveness of interventions de-\nsigned to improve physician counsel-\ning, especially in groups at risk for not\nhaving discussions about exercise with\ntheir physicians.\nFunding/Support: Dr Wee was supported in part by\nThe Medical Foundation, Inc (Boston, Mass) and an\ninstitutional National Research Service Award train-\nducted.\nREFERENCES\n1.
