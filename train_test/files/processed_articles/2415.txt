The risk of suicidal\nideation was 2.4 times greater among youth who experi-\nenced peer victimization in the past year, 3.4 times greater\namong those who were sexually assaulted, and 4.4 times\ngreater among those exposed to maltreatment, relative to\nchildren who were not exposed to these types of victim-\nization. Findings also showed substantial effects of poly-\nvictimization (exposure to 7 or more individual types of\nvictimization in the past year), with polyvictims almost 6\ntimes more likely to report suicidal ideation.\nConclusion: Findings point to the importance of re-\ncent victimization in increasing risk of suicidal ideation\nin adolescents and suggest the need for victimization as-\nsessments among all youth who are believed to be at risk\nfor suicidal ideation.\nstantial concern, represent-\ning the third leading cause\nof death for adolescents in\nthe United States. From\nto 19-year-olds were due to suicide, rep-\nyear.1 Suicidal ideation, thoughts of harm-\ning or killing oneself,2 lies on a con-\ntinuum of suicidal behavior and may be\nan important precursor to suicide at-\ntempts.3-6 A national epidemiological sur-\nvey of adolescents in the United States\nfound that 19% of high school students had\nsuicidal ideation in the past year.7\nThere is reason to suspect that child-\nhood exposure to violence and victimiza-\ntion are important determinants of sui-\ncidal ideation. A number of studies have\nshown that sexual assault and child mal-\ntreatment, such as physical abuse, are sig-\nnificant predictors of suicidal ideation and\nattempts.8-15 Recent media reports of ado-\nlescents driven to suicide following bully-\ning at school also suggest the role of peer-\nperpetrated victimization on suicidal\nbehavior.

Indeed, research has\ndemonstrated the particularly damaging effects of \"poly-\nvictimization,\" ie, exposure to multiple forms of victim-\nization, on child trauma symptoms.20,21 This research is\nalso consistent with suicidal ideation studies finding a\n\"dose-response\" relationship between the number of\nchildhood adversities and suicidal behavior.22-24\nA substantial relationship exists between mental health\nproblems and suicidal ideation. Mood and anxiety dis-\norders, in particular, are strong predictors of suicidal be-\ncreased risk for subsequent victimization.27,28 Thus, failure\nto account for youth mental disorder, especially inter-\nnalizing disorders, is likely to inflate associations be-\ntween victimization and suicidal ideation.\nThere are a number of methodological problems and\nlimitations associated with much of the existing research\nin this area. For example, many studies are based on small\nselective samples, such as clinical samples with particular\ndisorders or hospital inpatient samples, making it diffi-\ncult to generalize findings to the general population of ado-\nlescents. Also, studies have often relied on retrospective re-\nports using substantial lag times between childhood abuse\nexposureandadultsuicidalideationassessments.Suchstud-\nies are open to problems with recall bias and make it dif-\nficult to speak to the causal processes involved. Most stud-\nies addressing this issue are also cross-sectional in design,\nfurther reducing the ability to establish temporal order of\nsuicidal thoughts and victimization. Longitudinal studies\nthat allow researchers to control for previous suicidal\nideation to assess the effects of recent victimization on\nsubsequent suicidal ideation would better assess the causal\nrole of victimization on this outcome. Finally, as noted\nearlier, existing studies have typically focused on only 1\nformofvictimizationandhaveoftenreliedonlimited1-item\nmeasures.\nThe current research used 2 waves of longitudinal data to\nexamine the effects of several forms of victimization on\nsuicidal ideation in a nationally representative sample of\nadolescents aged 12 to 19 years. The objectives were to\n(1)determinewhethertherearesignificantdifferencesin\nsuicidalideationacrosssociodemographicfactorsandex-\nposureto5differentaggregatetypesofvictimization(peer\nvictimization,sexualassault,maltreatment,witnessingfam-\nilyviolence,andexposuretocommunityviolence)aswell\nas exposure to multiple forms of victimization (ie, poly-\nvictimization);(2)examinetheindependenteffectsofeach\ncategory of victimization on suicidal ideation at wave 2,\ncontrollingforsociodemographicfactors,internalizingdis-\norder diagnoses, and wave 1 suicidal ideation; and (3)\nassess the effect of exposure to multiple forms of victim-\nization within a 1-year period (ie, polyvictimization) on\nsuicidalideationatwave2,usingthesamesetofcontrols.\nMETHODS\nPARTICIPANTS\nThese analyses use data from the National Survey of Chil-\ndren's Exposure to Violence, a 2-wave longitudinal study of a\nrepresentative sample of US children and adolescents. The Na-\ntional Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence was de-\nsigned to obtain incidence and prevalence estimates of a wide\nrange of childhood victimizations. The wave 1 survey was con-\ning in the contiguous United States. The wave 2 survey was con-\nducted approximately 2 years later between January 2010 and\nNovember 2010. Interviews with parents and youth were con-\nducted over the telephone by the employees of an experienced\nsurvey research firm.\nThe primary foundation of the wave 1 design was a nation-\nwide sampling frame of residential telephone numbers from\nwhich a sample of telephone households was drawn by ran-\ndom digit dialing. This nationally representative cross-section\nthat the study included a sizeable proportion of minorities and\nlow-income respondents for more accurate subgroup analy-\nses, we also oversampled African American, Hispanic, or low-\nincome households. This \"oversample\" yielded 33% of the com-\npleted interviews. Sample weights were calculated for wave 1\nto adjust for differential probability of selection due to (1) study\ndesign, (2) demographic variations in nonresponse, and (3)\nvariations in within-household eligibility.\nIn wave 2, efforts were made to recontact wave 1 respon-\ndents and elicit their participation. A total of 2497 children who\nwere aged 0 to 17 years at wave 1 took part in both waves (55%\nof the original sample). The remaining 45% of the original sample\nwho did not participate consisted of respondents at wave 1 who\ndid not wish to be contacted for wave 2 (5%), those whose tele-\nphone numbers were no longer active residential numbers (9%)\nor were no longer associated with the original household (8%),\nrespondents who refused participation (9%), and failure to reach\nrespondents at scheduled callbacks (13%). The current study\nfocuses on the 1186 children who participated in both waves\nThe wave 1 cooperation rate for the random digit dialing cross-\nsection portion of the survey was 71% and the response rate\nwas 54%. The cooperation and response rates associated with\nthe smaller oversample were somewhat lower at 63% and 43%,\nrespectively. We compared parent reports of adolescents who\ncompleted the interview with parent reports for adolescent non-\nresponders for 10- to 17-year-old participants. Nonre-\nsponders were not systematically different from respondents\non factors related to victimization risk (details of the nonre-\nsponse analyses can be obtained on request).\nFifty-seven percent of the subsample used in this study (re-\nspondents aged 10-17 years in wave 1) completed an inter-\nview in wave 2. To adjust for differential attrition by demo-\ngraphic factors, victimization, and trauma symptom levels, a\nnew set of sample weights was calculated for wave 2 using both\nthe wave 1 sample weights and propensity scores based on the\nlikelihood of each wave 1 case returning for wave 2.

Individual screeners can\nbe grouped into aggregate types representing general classes\nof victimization.\nThis study used 5 aggregate types of victimization that oc-\ncurred within the past year at both waves: peer-perpetrated vic-\ntimization, maltreatment, sexual assault, witnessing family vio-\nlence, and exposure to community violence. The individual\nscreeners used to construct each of these aggregates are shown\nin the eAppendix (http://www.archpediatrics.com). For each\naggregate victimization type, children were coded as 1 if they\nresponded yes to any past-year occurrence of 1 or more of the\nscreeners used to construct the aggregate.\nInadditiontothe5aggregatetypes,weusedameasureofchil-\ndren'stotalburdenofpast-yearvictimization.Asumof36screen-\ners contained in the survey was calculated for each child.

Con-\nsistentwithearlierresearch,thiscutoffidentifiesroughlythetop\n10% of children in terms of multiple victimization levels.20,30\nSuicidal Ideation\nOne item from the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Children31\nwas used to assess suicidal ideation. In both waves, respondents\nwere asked, \"In the last month, how often have you wanted to\nkill yourself? Would you say not at all, sometimes, often, or very\noften?\" A binary suicidal ideation variable was created in which\nresponses of \"never\" were coded as 0 and responses of \"some-\ntimes,\" \"often,\" and \"very often\" were coded as 1.\nInternalizing Disorder Diagnosis\nIn the parent portion of the survey of both waves, parents were\nasked if their child had ever been diagnosed with any of sev-\neral disorders. Children whose parents reported that they had\nbeen diagnosed with either posttraumatic stress disorder, an\nanxiety disorder other than posttraumatic stress disorder, or\ndepression were coded as 1 for having ever been diagnosed with\nan internalizing disorder.\nDemographics\nDemographic information was obtained in the parent interview,\nincluding the child's sex, age (in years), and race/ethnicity (coded\ninto4groups:whitenon-Hispanic,blacknon-Hispanic,otherrace\nnon-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race). Family structure, defined\nby the composition of the household, was categorized into 4\ngroups: children living with (1) 2 biological or adoptive parents,\n(2) 1 biological parent plus partner (spouse or nonspouse), (3)\nsinglebiologicalparent,and(4)othercaregiver.Sex,age,andrace\nwere obtained from the wave 1 interview. Since family structure\ncould have changed between the 2 waves of data, we used family\nstructure reported at wave 2.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents sample percentages reporting suicidal\nideation at wave 2 by demographic variations and victim-\nization exposure.

Al-\nthough there were no substantial differences between ado-\nlescents living with 2-parent families and those living with\na single parent or other adults, almost 11% of respondents\nliving in a stepfamily or with a parent and unmarried part-\nner reported suicidal ideation--more than 3 times the per-\ncentage reported by those living with both biological or\nadoptive parents. There were no significant differences in\nsuicidal ideation across race or between respondents who\nThere were substantial differences in suicidal ide-\nation between adolescents who were exposed to specific\ncategories of victimization in the preceding year relative\nto those who were not. More than 8% of respondents who\nwere peer victimized and more than 11% of those youth\nwho witnessed family violence reported suicidal ide-\nation in the past month, while suicidal ideation among\nthose without these types of exposures was 2.9% and 3.5%,\nrespectively.Theformsofvictimizationassociatedwiththe\ngreatest percentage of youth reporting ideation in-\ncluded maltreatment (16% of maltreated adolescents\nreported suicidal ideation in contrast to 2.7% of non-\nmaltreated youth) and sexual assault (23% of those sexu-\nally assaulted reported ideation vs 3.7% among nonas-\nsaulted adolescents). Youth who were polyvictimized, that\nis, who were exposed to 7 or more individual types of vic-\ntimization, were also substantially more likely to report\nsuicidal ideation, with almost 16% of these youth report-\ning suicidal ideation in the past month.\nWe then conducted multivariate logistic regression\nanalyses to examine the effect of each past-year aggre-\ngated victimization type on suicidal ideation, control-\nling for demographic factors and the other forms of vic-\ntimization. To increase our confidence that victimization\nexposure temporally preceded and contributed to sui-\ncidal ideation, we also controlled for suicidal ideation\nat wave 1 and whether the respondent had ever been di-\nagnosed with an internalizing disorder. Table 2 pre-\nsents these analyses, where odds ratios have been con-\nverted to approximate relative risk ratios.32\nAs seen in model 1, sex and family structure continued\nto be related to suicidal ideation, with all other demograph-\nics and all 4 victimization aggregates controlled. Al-\nthough witnessing family violence and exposure to com-\nmunity violence were not significantly associated\nwithsuicidalideation,maltreatment,peervictimization,and\nsexual assault were independently related to wave 2 sui-\ncidal ideation. Peer-victimized youth had almost 2.4 times\nthe risk of suicidal ideation, those sexually assaulted in the\npast year had about 3.4 times the risk, and those who were\nmaltreated had almost 4.4 times the risk of suicidal ide-\nation. As expected, having been diagnosed with an inter-\nnalizing disorder and suicidal ideation at baseline were also\nsubstantially related to wave 2 suicidal ideation. Twenty-\ntwo percent of the variance (pseudo R2) in wave 2 suicidal\nideation was explained by the model.\nInstead of focusing on the independent effects of the\n5 types of victimization, model 2 of Table 2 considers the\neffects of polyvictimization--exposure to at least 7 in-\ndividual forms of victimization in the past year. Polyvic-\ntims were almost 6 times more likely to experience an\nonset of suicidal ideation at wave 2. All the controls that\nwere significant in model 1 were also significant here,\nwith odds ratios similar in magnitude. About 17% of the\nvariance in suicidal ideation was explained by this model.\nCOMMENT\nThe current study advances research on predictors of ado-\nlescent suicidal ideation by (1) considering exposure to\nmultiple types of victimization in the same study, (2) as-\nsessing more proximal victimization exposure than has\nbeen typical of past research, (3) controlling for inter-\nnalizing disorder diagnoses and past suicidal ideation, and\n(4) using a nationally representative sample.\nFindings indicated that, with the exception of com-\nmunity violence, suicidal ideation was significantly more\ncommon among adolescents who had experienced any\nform of victimization, including sexual assault, peer vic-\ntimization, witnessing family violence, and maltreat-\nment. Moreover, when considered in multivariate analy-\nses, 3 of these categories of victimization showed\nTable 2.

The findings also showed a substantial indepen-\ndent effect of sexual assault on suicide ideation, consis-\ntent with past research on the traumatic, stigmatizing, and\nshame-producingqualitiesofthisformofvictimization.33-35\nHowever,maltreatmentbyacaregiverwasassociatedwith\ngreatest risk. Adolescents who had experienced physical\nabuse, emotional maltreatment, neglect, and/or custodial\ninterferenceinthepastyearwerealmost4.5timesmorelikely\nto experience the onset of suicidal ideation.

Exposure to many different\nforms of victimization likely reflects significant adver-\nsity across multiple contexts of adolescents' lives. For such\nyouth, victimization represents more of a life condition\nthan a set of events. Cross-context victimization may also\ndamage adolescents' potential for resiliency by creating\ndeficits in social and personal resources (such as social\nsupport and self-esteem) that would normally help to\nmoderate the negative effects of victimization. Future re-\nsearch should attempt to better specify the mechanisms\nthat make child polyvictimization a particularly strong\npredictor of suicidal ideation.\nAnother noteworthy finding was the substantial asso-\nciation between suicidal ideation and living in a house-\nhold with a stepparent or unmarried parent partner. Al-\nthoughpastresearchhasdocumentedgreatervictimization\nexposure in stepfamily households,50 in the current study,\nvictimization did not fully explain the association be-\ntween family structure and suicidal ideation. The particu-\nlarly strong association with stepfamily households is wor-\nrisome and warrants more attention in future research.\nThis study uncovered a smaller percentage of adoles-\ncents reporting suicidal ideation than has been found in\nother epidemiological surveys. The discrepancy likely re-\nflects differences in the assessment period. We used a mea-\nsure that asked youth about thoughts of suicide during\nthe past month, while most other studies have used mea-\nsures that ask about the past year or lifetime.7,10,22 Ad-\nvantages to our more proximal shorter-period assess-\nment include clearer temporal ordering between recent\nvictimization and suicidal ideation and less likelihood of\nrecall bias. However, the lower numbers reporting ide-\nation leave less statistical power to detect associations and\ndo not allow for subgroup analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings emphasize the need to include compre-\nhensive victimization assessment in adolescent suicide\nprevention and intervention efforts, recognizing the par-\nticular significance of polyvictimization. Similarly, treat-\nment responses to sexual assault, peer-perpetrated vic-\ntimization, and child maltreatment must recognize the\nincreased risk of suicidal behavior among victims. Al-\nthough much research in this area has focused on neu-\nrological risks and psychopharmacologic interventions,\nthese findings point to the importance of the environ-\nment and the value of victimization prevention in reduc-\ning suicidal behavior. A comprehensive approach to sui-\ncide prevention needs to address the safety of youth in\ntheir homes, schools, and neighborhoods.\nCorrespondence: Heather A.
