Knowing how much longer\nit takes to perceive a stimulus A relative to a stimulus B--the difference in perceptual latency, L--\nmay help the project of understanding what kind of neural activity causes perception (Krekelberg &\nL is sometimes estimated by subtracting the behavioural response time to stimulus B from the\nresponse time to stimulus A (Amano, Johnston, & Nishida, 2007; Aschersleben & Musseler, 1999;\nDi Luca, Machulla, & Ernst, 2009; Kopinska & Harris, 2004; Navarra, Hartcher-O'Brien, Piazza,\nResponse times, however, might reflect speedy decisions that can occur prior to perception or rely on\ndifferent neural circuits than perception (Neumann & Niepel, 2004).\nL is often estimated from other behavioural tasks that are considered to rely more upon per-\nception such as temporal order judgments (TOJ) (Adams & Mamassian, 2004; Arnold, Johnston,\n(Kanai & Watanabe, 2006; Mayer, Di Luca & Ernst, 2014). Here, we studied TOJ and SJ because they\nappear to be the most commonly used for estimating L. We also used duration judgments because,\nalthough previously it has rarely been used to estimate L, the large temporal interval that can be used\nbetween stimulus A and B should minimize or eliminate the sensory interaction of A and B that may be\na problem for the other tasks (see Discussion).\nIn TOJ (Hirsh & Sherrick, 1961), A and B are presented with different relative timings and observ-\ners report which stimulus occurred first. L is estimated as the relative timing for which it is equally\nlikely to report A is first as that B is first.\nIn SJ (Allan, 1975), A and B are presented with different relative timings and observers report\nwhether they occurred at the same time or not. L is estimated as the relative timing that is most likely\nto cause an observer to report \"simultaneous.\"\nIn duration judgments (Grondin & Rousseau, 1991; Kanai & Watanabe, 2006; Mayer, Di Luca &\nErnst, 2013), observers compare the duration of an interval delimited by A followed by B (AB) with\nDifferences in perceptual latency estimated from judgments\nof temporal order, simultaneity and duration are inconsistent\nthe duration of an interval delimited by B followed by A (BA). If the perceptual latency of A (L\nA\n) is\nshorter than the perceptual latency of B (L\nB\n), then the interval AB should be perceived as lasting longer\nthan BA (Figure 3A; Kanai & Watanabe, 2006; Mayer, Di Luca & Ernst, 2013). More specifically, the\nperceived duration of an interval AB (D\nAB\n) of physical duration d might be estimated as\nD\nAB\nBA\nwhere L\nBA\nB\nA\nSimilarly, the perceived duration of a BA interval (D\nBA\n) of the same duration might be estimated as\nD\nBA\nBA\nHence, from Equations (1) and (2) it is possible to estimate L\nBA\nusing D\nAB\nand D\nBA\nL\nBA\nAB\nBA\nA major problem for the estimation of L is that the estimates provided by different tasks often do\nnot coincide. For TOJ and SJ, previous studies have shown that L are inconsistent in that they do not\ncorrelate significantly across observers (Love, Petrini, Cheng, & Pollick, 2013; van Eijk, Kohlrausch,\nJuola, & Van de Par, 2008; Vatakis, Navarra, Soto-Faraco, & Spence, 2008; but see Sanders, Chang,\nHiss, Uchanski, & Hullar, 2011). This inconsistency might be related to the different biases that afflict\nTOJ and SJ (see Discussion).\nNo previous studies have tested whether the L estimated from SJ or TOJ is consistent with that\nestimated from duration judgments. Consistency of duration judgments and TOJ might suggest that\nthese methods should be preferred for estimating L (Neumann & Niepel, 2004). Another possibility\nis that SJ and duration judgments yield consistent estimates. We found, however, that L estimated\nfrom duration judgments is not consistent with L estimated from TOJ nor SJ, which suggests that\neach method is subject to different processes that hinder the estimation of L.\nSeven people participated. The authors (DL and AH) and GS knew the experimental hypotheses. The\ntasks of duration judgment, SJ, and TOJ were tested in different sessions. Observers conducted first the\nduration judgments, then the SJ and finally the TOJ. The sole exception was AH, who conducted some\nmore sessions of duration judgments after the TOJ. For the duration judgments, two standard durations\n(see below) were tested in different sessions whose order was pseudo-randomized across observers.\nFor each standard, observers completed between 280 and 1,120 trials. For SJ and TOJ, each observer\ncompleted 220 trials. The data and code (in R, R Core Team, 2014) to do the statistical analysis and\ncreate the figures are available at http://www.dlinares.org.\nThe visual and auditory stimuli were generated using PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007). Visual stimuli\nwere displayed on a CRT at 100 Hz and auditory stimuli were presented with headphones. Observers\nfixated a black circle (all guns set to zero) in a grey background (54 cd/m2). The visual event, V, was\na colour change of the fixation point to white (108 cd/m2) for 10 ms. The auditory event, A, was a\nFor SJ and TOJ, A occurred at a random time between 0.8 and 1.2 s after the onset of the trial and\nthe timing of V relative to A varied according to the method of constant stimuli (ranging from \u00ad0.25 to\n0.25 s in steps of 0.05 s). SJ and TOJ were run in separate blocks of trials.\nFor the duration judgments, two intervals were presented on each trial and the observers judged\nwhich was longer (see Figure 3a). The first interval (the \"standard\") was 0.6 s or 1.2 s in different\nblocks of trials. The second (the \"variable\") was chosen from a range of durations centred on the\nstandard interval's duration (method of constant stimuli; variable intervals for the 0.6 s standard: 0.3,\n\"spacing interval\" between the judged intervals had a random duration between 0.4 and 0.6 s for the\n0.6 s standard, and between 0.8 and 1.2 s for the 1.2 s standard. The time preceding the stimuli on each\ntrial was a random value between 0.4 and 0.6 s for the 0.6 s standard and a random value between 0.8\nDifferences in perceptual latency 561\nTemporal order judgments (TOJ)\nFigure 1a shows the proportion of trials in which V (the visual stimulus) was reported to occur before\nA (the auditory stimulus) as a function of the relative timing between A and V. Many observers infor-\nmally reported that this task was more difficult than the SJ task and the duration task. The participants\nin Love et al. (2013) similarly reported that TOJ was more difficult. We found that some observers like\nGS and DL perform far from perfectly (less than 80% correct) even for very long relative timings, so\nit appears that the greater difficulty of TOJ is not restricted to when the stimuli occur close in time. To\naccount for this, we fitted cumulative normal curves with an independent lapse rate for each side (see\ncaption of Figure 1).\nTo estimate L\nVA\nfrom the fitted curves, we extracted the timing for which in half of the trials the\nobserver reported V before A. This L\nVA\nis positive for some observers and negative for others, which\nis statistically reliable as for most observers the confidence intervals do not overlap zero (Figure 1b).\nThis is consistent with previous findings (Boenke, Deliano, & Ohm, 2009; Love et al., 2013; van Eijk\net al., 2008). Across observers, the average L\nVA\nwas 45 ms (not significantly different from 0, one\nSimultaneity judgments (SJ)\nFigure 2a shows the proportion of simultaneous reports as a function of the relative timing between\nA and V. We fitted a normal curve to these proportions and took its center as L\nVA\n(see caption of\nFigure 2). L\nVA\nwas positive for all observers (their confidence intervals do not include zero, Figure 1b).\nThis suggests faster perception of A relative to V and is consistent with the findings of previous studies\nthat most observers'L\nVA\nvan Eijk et al., 2008; Zampini, Guest, Shore, & Spence, 2005;). Across observers, the average L\nVA\nDuration judgments\nIn each trial, the observers decided which of two intervals bounded by A and V seemed longer\n(Figure 3a). The order of presentation of A and V was different in two distinct trial types. In the AVVA\ntype of trial, the first interval was a 0.6 s \"standard\": A was always followed by V (standard AV) after\n0.6 s. The second interval was V followed by A after a variable amount of time (variable VA).

The error bars are the 95% parametric bootstrap confidence intervals (Kingdom & Prins, 2010; we\nuse 1,000 samples for all the bootstrap calculations in the paper).\nVAAV type of trial, the first interval was a standard of 0.6 s in which V was followed by A (standard VA)\nand the second interval was defined by A followed by V after a variable amount of time (variable AV).\nThus, the standard was always presented before the variable. The AVVA and VAAV trial types were\npresented in random order within each session.\nComparison of the PSEs for the two trial types allows estimation of L\nVA\n, as explained in the\nIntroduction. The difference in perceptual latency between visual and auditory stimulus, L\nVA\n, should\nnot depend on the duration of the interval demarcated by the two stimuli, d (Mayer, Di Luca & Ernst,\n2013), which here is formalized in Equation (3). To test this, in different blocks we used two different\ndurations of the standard, 0.6 s and 1.2 s.\nFigure 3b shows, for each observer and standard, the proportion of trials in which the variable\ninterval was perceived to last longer than the standard for AVVA and VAAV trials. Figure 3c shows for\nAVVA and VAAV trials the durations of the variable intervals that match the standards. These durations\nare the points of subjective equality or PSEs, estimated by fitting cumulative normal curves to the data\nin Figure 3b and taking from these fits the duration of the variable intervals that were reported longer\nthan the standards in half of the trials.\nFigure 3d shows the estimated L\nVA\nvalues. We did not estimate L\nVA\nby applying Equation (3)\ndirectly to the PSEs in Figure 3c because the equations in the Introduction assume that perceived\nduration is measured using a \"neutral\" variable interval (Mayer, Di Luca & Ernst, 2013). Instead of\nusing neutral variable intervals, we used variable intervals in which the order of A and V was reversed\nrelative to the standards because this yields twice the expected effect, providing more power to reveal\ndifferences in the perceived duration between AV and VA intervals. Taking into account the use of\nreversed variable intervals when considering Equations (1), (2) and (3) yields the following equations:\nD\nAV\nVA\nD\nVA\nVA\nL\nVA\nAV\nVA\nHence, we estimated L\nVA\nby subtracting the PSEs shown in Figure 3c and dividing them by 4.\nBefore discussing the L\nVA\nvalues, we should point out that, according to Equations (4) and (5),\nthe deviation of the PSE for AVVA relative to the duration of the standard (D\nAV\n\u00ad d) and the deviation\nof the duration of the standard relative to the PSE for VAAV (d\u00adD\nVA\n) should be equal. These quantities,\nhowever, were not equal for 8 of the 14 samples (7 observers 3 2 standards), according to a statistical\ntest. The statistical test was calculation of the 95% confidence intervals of (D\nAV\n\u00ad d) \u00ad (d \u00ad D\nVA\n) for each\nbootstrapped within-subject PSE sample and checking whether it contained zero. Between-subjects\nstatistics support the same conclusion for the population generally--that the deviation is asymmetric.\nThis was a one-sample t-test using the absolute values of (D\nAV\n\u00ad d\n)\u00ad (d \u00ad D\nVA\n) calculated for each\nobserver. This difference in shift of the perceived duration relative to d was statistically significant\nThe asymmetric shift could be caused by a bias to perceive the first interval as shorter or as longer\nthan the second interval (time order error, Hellstr\u00f6m, 1985). To take into account this effect, one can\nconsider d in Equations (4) and (5) not as the physical interval but the interval plus a constant term\ncorresponding to shortening or lengthening. Fortunately, because Equation (6) is obtained by subtract-\ning Equations (4) and (5), thus removing d, the shortening or lengthening of the first interval should\nnot affect the calculation of L.\nFigure 3d shows the estimated L\nVA\nfor the 0.6 and 1.2 s standards. For each observer, the sign of\nL\nVA\nwas consistent across standards, that is, for any observer L\nVA\nwas never significantly positive\nfor one of the standards and significantly negative for the other (confidence intervals in Figure 3d).\nFurthermore, the estimated L\nVA\nfor the two standards correlated across observers: Pearson's correla-\nVA\nalso was not signifi-\nseem consistent with Equation (3). They are also consistent with a recent study finding no effect of\nthe standard's duration, although that study did not examine the issue as closely because the data were\npooled across observers before conducting the statistical analysis (Mayer, Di Luca & Ernst, 2013).\nDifferences in perceptual latency 563\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime V was presented before A (s)\nProportion of simultaneity reports\na\n LVA (s)\nb\nFigure 2.

Our results reveal strong inconsistencies in more than half of the observers.\nFuture studies using larger samples of participants might establish which tasks produce estimates\nof L\nVA\nthat are less inconsistent. Larger samples could also reveal which tasks produce estimates of\nL\nVA\nthat are less variable across participants.\n4 Discussion\nUsing an auditory and a visual stimulus, we showed that L estimated from SJ and TOJ are inconsist-\nbut see Sanders et al., 2011) and found that L estimated from duration judgments is consistent with\nneither TOJ nor SJ. Given these inconsistencies, it is difficult to know which task is best for estimat-\ning L. In Table 1, we offer a tentative list of the possible problems associated with using each task to\nestimate L. We discuss these problems below.\nProblems estimating L from TOJ\nEstimating L from TOJ may be affected by three problems. First, sensory interactions: in TOJ,\nthe stimuli are presented close in time and that can affect the response of sensory neurons to each\n(e.g. temporal principle in multisensory processes, Meredith, Nemitz, & Stein, 1987), altering their\nneural latencies (e.g. Rowland, Quessy, Stanford, & Stein, 2007). Thus, the perceptual latency of A\npresented alone and the perceptual latency of A when presented near V could be different. For ex-\nample, when A and V are presented close in time, attention might be allocated differently to A and\nV. Given that attending to a stimulus can reduce its neural latency by a few milliseconds (Galashan,\nSa\u00dfen, Kreiter, & Wegener, 2013; Sundberg, Mitchell, Gawne, & Reynolds, 2012), the different al-\na\nDuration standard (s)\nDuration variable that\nmatches standard (s)\nAV (standard) VA (variable) VA (standard) AV (variable)\nc\nDuration standard (s)\n LVA (s)\nd\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nGG\nG\nG\nGG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nGG\nGG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nGG\nGG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nGG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nGG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nGG\nG\nSN\nDuration variable (s)\nProportion variable reported longer\nG\nG\nVA (0.6 s) AV (variable)\nAV (0.6 s) VA (variable)\nVA (1.2 s) AV (variable)\nAV (1.2 s) VA (variable)\nb\nFigure 3.

The error bars are the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the upper and lower limits of the distribution of\ndifferences of the bootstrapped PSEs in (c) for the two type of trials divided by 4.\nDifferences in perceptual latency 565\nlocation of attention might introduce differences in perceptual latency--an effect called prior entry\nThe second problem is a bias associated generally with the method of single stimulus or compara-\ntive judgments--a popular method for measuring appearance (Anton-Erxleben, Abrams, & Carrasco,\n2010; Garcia-Perez & Alcala-Quintana, 2013). TOJ is an instance of the method of single stimulus and\nas such its estimates may be contaminated by a response bias (Anton-Erxleben et al., 2010; Arnold\n& Movshon, 2007; Morgan, Dillenburger, Raphael, & Solomon, 2012; Nicholls, Lew, Loetscher, &\nArnold, 2011). This bias is particularly an issue for temporal asynchronies near the PSE, where the\nobserver might frequently feel that she does not have an answer, but because she needs to respond, she\nends up favouring one of the responses or response buttons.\nFavouring one response button means that under uncertainty the participant might have a prefer-\nence, for example, for the button that she presses with the index finger or with the dominant hand\ninstead of choosing between the buttons completely at random.\nFavouring one response might mean, for example, choosing rightward direction in a leftward/\nrightward motion discrimination task (Morgan et al., 2012), or the auditory stimulus in a TOJ task.\nThe reasons for choosing one response over the other might not be obvious and different observers\nmight have different preferences. In other cases, the bias might be fairly consistent across observers.\nFor example, in a TOJ task, observers might report that attended stimuli come earlier when they are\nuncertain about the response. Indeed, it is possible that this bias is the major contribution to the prior\nSchneider & Bavelier, 2003; Spence & Parise, 2010). A response could also be favoured depending on\nhow the stimuli group responds. When three stimuli are presented during a brief interval, for example,\nthe reported order of the last two might depend on the similarity with the first one (Albertazzi, 1999;\nThe third problem is a bias associated with a difficulty ordering events in time. In the method\nof single stimuli for spatial tasks, such as motion discrimination, most observers give the correct\nresponse for stimuli relatively far from the PSE, e.g., they respond \"rightward\" close to 100% of\ntrials if the motion signal is strongly to the right (e.g. Selen, Shadlen, & Wolpert, 2012). For TOJ\nhowever, our observers, like observers in previous studies (Love et al., 2013; Petrini, Holt, & Pollick,\n2010; Zampini, Shore, & Spence, 2003), have numerous \"lapses\" even for relatively large temporal\nseparation of the two stimuli. This poor performance is consistent with the data of our observers and\nobservers in previous studies (e.g. Love et al, 2013) reporting that TOJ was a difficult task, more so\nthan SJ. The difficulty might be related to a cognitive temporal bottleneck that limits mapping the two\nstimuli to their identity (Yamamoto & Kitazawa, 2001). That is, not having enough time to name each\nstimulus before the next one is perceived can leave one unable to do the task. Depending on the curve\nused to fit the data (Garcia-Perez & Alcala-Quintana, 2012), the numerous lapses far from the PSE\nFigure 4. Replot of the estimated LVA\n LVA (s)\nmay contaminate the estimation of the PSE (Garcia-Perez & Alcala-Quintana, 2012), sometimes even\nProblems estimating L from SJ\nGiven that in SJ, like in TOJ, stimuli are presented close in time, sensory interactions might also afflict\nSJ. SJ is an instance of the method of equality judgments that measure appearance (Anton-Erxleben et\nal., 2010; Garcia-Perez & Alcala-Quintana, 2012). In equality judgments, the bias associated with the\nmethod of single stimuli should not occur because favouring one of the responses or response-buttons\nshould change the height of the fitted curve but should not shift its central tendency, the PSE (Anton-\nEquality judgments, however, might be affected by an asymmetrical criterion bias by which the\nprobability to report \"equal\" or \"simultaneous\" is different for stimuli smaller and larger than the PSE\n(Anton-Erxleben et al., 2010; Yarrow et al., 2011). For SJ, this bias might reflect an asymmetrical\ncriterion to perceive two stimuli as related. It has been suggested that for auditory and visual stimuli,\nobservers perceive auditory following visual to be more likely to be related than the reverse order, pos-\nsibly because the former is more common in the environment (Dixon & Spitz, 1980).\nUnfortunately, observers sometimes report not having a clear sense of whether two stimuli were\nsimultaneous (Hirsh & Fraisse, 1964; Klemm, 1925). Especially in such conditions of uncertainty,\njudgments may instead be based on perceived relatedness, which can have an asymmetrical crite-\nrion (Welch & Warren, 1980). Indeed, SJ is often considered a measure of perceptual integration\nthat depends on other things as well as L (Arrighi, Alais, & Burr, 2006; Love et al., 2013; Powers,\nConsistent with the hypothesis of an asymmetrical criterion that favours judging simultaneity for\nauditory stimuli occurring after visual stimuli, three recent studies suggest that perceived simultaneity\nis easily malleable for the situation in which A follows V but not for the situation in which V follows A.\nThe first study found that short training on SJ for A and V with feedback reduces \"simultaneity\" reports\nfor A following V, but not for V following A (Powers et al., 2009). The second study reported that\nvideo game players report fewer \"simultaneous\" responses when A follows V than non-video game\nplayers, but video game and non-video game players report \"simultaneous\" equally when V follows A\n(Donohue, Woldorff, & Mitroff, 2010). The third found that fast adaptation to temporal relationships\noccurs when A follows V, but not when V follows A (van der Burg, Cass, & Alais, 2013). It is possible,\nhowever, that these changes are not just decisional but reflect actual changes in perceptual latency.\nTotrytoreconcilethedifferingestimatesofLfromTOJandSJ,thebiasassociatedwiththemethod\nof single stimuli has been modeled recently by Garcia-Perez and Alcala-Quintana (Alcala-Quintana\n& Garcia-Perez, 2013; Garcia-Perez & Alcala-Quintana, 2012), but when we did a simple Pearson-\nproduct correlation of their estimates of L for TOJ and SJ, we found that L did not correlate across\nThe problem might be that their model does not incorporate any bias associated with the difficulty to\norder events for TOJ nor the asymmetrical criterion bias for SJ. The former might be easy to incor-\nporate in the form of lapses (Garcia-Perez & Alcala-Quintana, 2012), but not the latter given that it\nrequires knowledge about how observers associate relatedness to events.\nProblems estimating L from duration judgments\nBecause the stimuli in the duration task can be presented far apart in time (as they were here), the du-\nration task may avoid the problem of sensory interactions and also the bias associated with temporal\norder difficulty.\nTable 1. Problems estimating L. \"Yes\" indicates that the task is likely affected by the problem.\nProblem TOJ SJ Duration\nSensory interactions Yes Yes No\nMethod of single stimuli Yes No No\nTemporal order difficulty Yes No No\nAsymmetric criterion No Yes No\nDuration order No No Yes\nDifferences in perceptual latency 567\nWe measured duration judgments using a two-interval forced choice method. In principle, this\nmethod should not be affected by the bias associated with the method of single stimuli. Unfortunately,\nhowever, we presented the standard interval always first, and hence, when observers reported shorter\nor longer for the second interval, they were effectively prone to the same bias as that with the method\nof single stimuli. The bias could be avoided, if the order of presentation of the standard is randomized.\nAnother bias that may apply only to the duration task is something we refer to as the duration order\nbias (Kanai & Watanabe, 2006; Mayer, Di Luca & Ernst, 2013). The derivation of Equation 3 assumes\nthan the order of presentation of the stimuli that delimit the time interval only affects the perceptual\nlatency of the onset and offset of the interval and not the encoding of duration per se (Ivry & Schlerf,\nnot depend on the duration of the interval, but instead we found that it does, which suggests that the\norder of presentation of the stimuli affects the encoding of duration per se and that duration judgments\nare problematic to estimate L. Such a duration order bias might occur if, for example, attention is\nprompted differently at the interval onset by A and V (see Discussion in Kanai & Watanabe, 2006)\ngiven that attention has been shown to influence perceived duration (Tse, Intriligator, Rivest, & Cav-\n5 Conclusions\nThe inconsistent estimates of L for TOJ, SJ and duration judgments suggest that these tasks are\naffected by partially distinct sets of biases. Hence, when researchers use only one of these tasks to\nassess the effect on L of some manipulation--such as attention (Spence & Parise, 2010), temporal\ncontext (Chen & Vroomen, 2013; Koenderink et al., 2012) or adaptation (Fujisaki, Shimojo, Kashino,\n& Nishida, 2004)--any significant effect should be attributed to changes in L only if one is confident\nthat the biases did not change.\nTo evaluate the merits of different tasks in the estimation of L, one might not only consider\nthe consistencies of L across tasks, but also the consistency of L for an individual across different\nmoments in time. This has not been done extensively, but for SJ, previous results suggest that the esti-\nApart from TOJ, SJ and duration judgments, other tasks can also be used to estimate perceptual\nlatencies. Observers might be asked to report the location of a moving object at the time of an event\n(Haggard, Clark, & Kalogeras, 2002; Kanai, Sheth, Verstraten, & Shimojo, 2007; Libet, Gleason,\naction with a sensory event (Aschersleben & Musseler, 1999; Linares et al., 2009; Nishida & Johnston,\ntask in which participants attempt to press a button for the same duration as a previous sensory event\n(Jazayeri & Shadlen, 2010), or judge whether an event occurred exactly at the midpoint of an interval\n(Burr, Banks, & Morrone, 2009). Differences in perceptual latencies have also been estimated by\nasking participants to determine the pairing of two alternating features (Clifford, Arnold, & Pearson,\n2003; Moutoussis & Zeki, 1997), although the notion that the best feature timing reflects the difference\nin perceptual latency has been questioned (Holcombe & Cavanagh, 2008; Holcombe, 2009; but see\nMoutoussis, 2012; Nishida & Johnston, 2002). The consistency of latencies inferred from these tasks\nwith those from others is under-studied.\nTo provide stronger support for a conclusion that a manipulation affected L rather than just the\nbiases, researchers should consider using multiple tasks. If the perceptual latency estimates from all\ntasks support the same conclusion regarding a change in L, the conclusion is more secure. After at\nleast some manipulations, however, the changes in latencies inferred from different tasks disagree\n(e.g. Schneider & Bavelier, 2003; Vatakis et al., 2008), suggesting that change in biases are sometimes\nthe cause of apparent L shifts. More work should be done to elucidate the nature and malleability of\nthese biases.\n"
