    "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough the phenomenology of visual hallucinations (VHs) has been investigated, no study to date has related cognitive\nperformance to the content of hallucinations, specifically whether participants who have familiar internally driven hallucinations\ndiffer in the executive function from patients with externally driven hallucinations. Here, we examine the relationship between\nexecutive function and the content of VHs in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We evaluated three groups: 17 PD patients\nwith internally driven memory-based VHs, 18 PD patients with externally driven non-memory-based VHs, and 20 PD patients\nwithout hallucinations on a series of tests previously reported to evaluate executive functions, specifically tests of inhibitory\nability, short-term memory, and working memory. Differences were found on test of inhibitory ability with PD patients\nexperiencing externally driven VHs having substantially greater impairment than patients with internally driven VHs. These\nfindings indicate that the cognitive profile of patients may influence the content of the hallucinatory experience and could\nconsequently have implications for treatment of the phenomenon.\n",

A complex variety of hallucinations associated with\nPD most commonly consist of animals and living or deceased\nindividuals, who may or may not be known to the patient.\nTypically, the hallucinated figures appear suddenly, in dim\nlight, with the patient's eyes open (Barnes & David, 2001).\nOther types of hallucinatory phenomena reported in PD\ninvolve hallucinations that are initiated by aspects of the\nenvironment, which then morph and change into other forms.\nThese VHs generally involve seeing an inanimate object as a\nliving entity, such as a street light becoming a flying bird, or\na dusty floor appearing as a swarm of spiders.\nFrancis Galton emphasized the connection of all types of\nvisualization, whether externally stimulus driven or internally\nmemory driven (Galton, 1883). Indeed, one could also delin-\neate VHs as internally driven where they consist of familiar\nobjects and people, whereas externally driven processes could\ncreate cognitive illusions and VHs of unfamiliar people not\npresent in memory. Neurologically speaking, sensations, men-\ntal imagery, daydreams, dreams, and hallucinations are similar\nin the sense that they are all internally driven processes.\nPerceptions are externally driven cognitive constructions,\nassembled from raw sensory data that are united with memory\nto form a conscious awareness of the external environment.\nThe relative predominance of exterior (sensory) versus internal\n1University of Westminster, London, UK\n2University of Bedfordshire, Luton, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nJames Barnes, Department of Psychology, University of Bedfordshire, Park\nSquare, Luton, Bedfordshire LU1 3JU, UK.\nEmail: james.barnes@beds.ac.uk\nPhenomenology of Visual Hallucinations\nand Their Relationship to Cognitive\nProfile in Parkinson's Disease Patients:\nPreliminary Observations\nLaura Boubert1 and James Barnes2\n Keywords\nassessment, clinical psychology, psychology, social sciences, experimental psychology, abnormal psychology, cognitive\npsychology, neuropsychology\n2 SAGE Open\n(memory) inputs to the cerebral mechanisms that construct\nour conscious experience is constantly shifting and it is the\ncompetition between these internal and external inputs for\naccess to this central awareness system that could be leading\nto the possibility of perceptual memories, imagery, and hal-\nlucinations to become indistinguishable from real events.\nMemory function and attention are two possible facilitat-\ning or causative factors of VHs in PD, as the hallucinating\nindividuals become less able of telling the difference between\nperceived and imaginary events, they are unable to attend\nadequately to visual stimuli relying instead on memory for\nidentification, hence hindering their ability to distinguish\nbetween perceived and imaginary experiences (Barnes,\nBoubert, Harris, Lee, & David, 2003). Evidence also sug-\ngests a correlation between VHs and an overall reduction in\nthe ability to process information (Collerton, Perry, &\nMcKeith, 2005). Indeed, executive functions are reportedly\ninvolved in reality monitoring and contribute significantly to\ndisentangling visual perception (Barnes & Boubert, 2008),\nfrom determining external and internal stimuli, to the inter-\nnal production of a visual image (Grossi et al., 2005; Roth,\nJohnson, Raye, & Constable, 2009). If this reality monitor-\ning process is inadequate, it might lead to confusion when\ndistinguishing what is virtual from what is real, thereby con-\ntributing to the experience of hallucinations (Bentall, Baker,\n& Havers, 1991). This process could possibly account for\nhallucinatory syndromes in psychotic conditions as well as\nneurodegenerative diseases (Brebion, Ohlsen, Pilowsky, &\nDavid, 2008). Nonetheless, some aspects of the content (e.g.,\nthe predominance of significant or remembered people or\nanimals) and some aspects of emotional significance suggest\nthat higher level cognitive factors may well also play a role\nin the hallucinatory process.\nPrevious work with Parkinson's patients has led to an\nobservation that the hallucinatory phenomenon is quite ste-\nreotyped in a given patient. In most instances, hallucinations\nmay be categorized as being an internally driven memory-\nbased hallucination process, where individuals see images of\nloved ones or people that they know, or an externally driven\nnon-memory-based hallucination, which consists of strangers\nor bizarre images. Although a previous study has investigated\npatients with a variety of hallucinations and found impaired\ninhibitory and executive functions, the study made no attempt\nto characterize the phenomenological content of the patient's\nhallucinatory experience (Barnes & Boubert, 2008).\nBased on the above considerations, this present study\naimed to extend these observations by investigating if there\nare any cognitive differences in patients with internally\ndriven hallucinations and patients who experience externally\ndriven hallucinations. We predicted that patients with\ninternal driven hallucinations would have more memory-\nassociated impairments than patients with externally driven\nhallucinations and no hallucinations. In addition, we expected\npatients with the externally driven type of hallucinations to\nshow less memory deficits and have more difficulty with\ntasks requiring an intentional component.\nMethod\nAll of the methods described below were formally approved\nby Oxford Brookes University Health and Life Sciences eth-\nics committee.\nParticipants\nIndividuals with PD currently experiencing VHs were\nrecruited using a questionnaire, which asked about VHs and\nvisual disturbances (Barnes & David, 2001). All patients had\na presumptive clinical diagnosis of PD and participants were\nselected on the basis of whether they were experiencing\ninternally based VHs (n = 17), or externally driven hallucina-\ntions (n = 18; see Table 1). In addition, a group of patients\nwho had never experienced VHs were recruited (N = 20).\nThe selection of individuals with VHs was based on (a) the\nfrequency of hallucinations (>1 per day) and (b) the absence\nof epilepsy or cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) > 25; Folstein, Robins, & Helzer,\n1983). Participants were recruited with case notes and the\nhelp of neurologists and ophthalmologists to ensure that no\nparticipant had a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,\nLewy body dementia, or any current or past history of eye\ndisease. Individuals were assigned to groups according to\nwhether their VHs were internally or externally driven and\nthey must have had them occurring within the last month.\nThe control patients with PD who had never hallucinated\nwere matched with those with VHs for age and disease sever-\nity, as well as medication dosage (see Table 2).\nCognitive Assessment\nAll patients who enrolled in the study underwent a psycho-\nlogical assessment, which included screening tests for gen-\neral cognitive abilities. The cognitive tests used were the\nsame as in a previous study investigating executive function-\ning in PD patients (Barnes & Boubert, 2008). The National\nAdult Reading Test (NART) was utilized as a general cogni-\ntive screening test (Nelson, 1982). Depressed mood was\nmeasured with the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory\n(Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961).\nSeveral tests to explore selective cognitive deficits were\nalso selected. Tests of inhibitory ability included category\nfluency (Newcombe, 1969), which was measured by asking\nthe participants to produce as many words as possible in 60 s\nfrom the six categories of furniture, fruit, animals, tools,\nitems of clothing, and insects.\nIn addition, a standard color Stroop task was carried out\nsubtask. Two control trials were performed first to act as a\nbaseline measure and control for the individual differences in\nreading speed and color naming. The participants were\ninstructed to read the words, name the colors, and finally,\nname the ink color of the printed words as quickly and as\naccurately as possible; the times needed to complete each\nBoubert and Barnes 3\nStroop subtask served as dependent measures (Stroop I,\nStroop II, and Stroop III, respectively). The interference\nmeasure was calculated by subtracting the average time\nneeded to complete the first two subtasks from the time\nneeded to complete the third subtask (Interference = Stroop\nIII \u00ad [(Stroop I + Stroop II) / 2]; Valentijn et al., 2005).\nParticipants underwent tests of short-term memory. Digit\nspan Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) was\ntested by the presentation of digit strings presented orally at\na rate of one digit per second. Participants were given two\nattempts at each digit string length and were instructed to\nrepeat the digits in the same order as they had been presented.\nWord span was tested using one-syllable concrete nouns, and\nparticipant word span was administered in the same way as\ndigit span. The longest string administered was nine words.\nA 2-back task was also run (Cohen et al., 1997). This was\na computerized task in which the participants were presented\nwith four-letter abstract nouns one at a time at a rate of one\nword every 2 s and asked to press one button whenever the\ncurrent stimulus matched the stimulus that had been shown\nto them 2 s before. A second button was pressed whenever\nthe stimulus was not a match.\nReading span and word span tasks were also administered\nto each participant (Barnes & Boubert, 2008). To measure\nreading span, participants read aloud a sentence presented to\nthem on a computer screen. They were then asked to answer\na straightforward comprehension question about the sen-\ntence. This was then repeated with another sentence, after\nwhich participants were asked to recall the final word of each\nsentence. Participants performed five sets of two-sentence\npresentations. The word span task was presented in the same\nway as the digit span task with the longest string being nine\nwords. All words were one-syllable, concrete nouns.\nResults\nParticipant's demographics and a comparison of tests are\nsummarized in Table 2. An analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nwas performed on the scores obtained for each test consider-\ning the effect of the group with post hoc pairwise Tukey's\ntest to examine significant main effects. Table 2 summarizes\nthe results.\nTests of Inhibition\nSignificant group effects were found in all tests on inhibitory\nability (see Table 2). Stroop inference scores produced sig-\nexternally driven hallucinating patients performing at a\nlower level than internally driven hallucinating patients and\n.001, respectively. On fluency perseverations, the group\nexperiencing externally driven hallucinations made more\nperseverations than those without hallucinations and the group\nwith patients experiencing internally driven hallucinations.\nTable 1.

Patients with externally driven VHs were impaired\non all three tests of inhibitory ability when compared against\nthe PD patients with internally generated VHs and also\nagainst the controls.\nThe phenomenological complexity of VHs in PD has\nbeen previously highlighted with a number of reoccurring\ncharacteristics and clustered experiences being identified\n(Barnes & David, 2001). In particular, the notion of veridical\nperceptions changing in some way when observed by the\npatient into certain common VHs such as faces, spiders, and\nshapes that take on the form of people is a common factor in\nthis study. Less common, and consequently the more diffi-\ncult individuals to find and engage are the patients who have\nhallucinations of identifiable persons or animals and scenes\nfrom episodic memory being played back to them in a par-\nticular way time after time. Past research has identified that\nthe content of the hallucination seems to be reflective of the\nfunctional specializations of the particular part of the cere-\nbral cortex with phenomenological variables clustering into\nthree main symptoms (Santhouse, Howard, & Ffytche,\n2000). The ventral temporal lobe is associated with the group\nof hallucinations consisting of extended landscape scenes,\nchildren, and figures. The second group of hallucinations\nconsisting of faces is associated with the superior temporal\nsulcus, whereas the third group of palinopsia and continu-\nance of visual sensation in the periphery of the visual field is\nrelated to the dorsal parietal lobe.\nIn this study, we observed patients typically experiencing\nwell-formed VHs, consisting of humans and animals, which\ncan be related to dysfunction of the ventral temporal lobe;\nhowever, as seen here from the documentation of patient\nexperiences (see Table 1), the content of the hallucination\ncan also be highly personalized and involve episodic memo-\nries. In these cases of internally driven hallucinations, the\nimages often expressed seem to be related to how the person\nthinks or feels about past events. Here, some Parkinson's\npatients viewed the content of their hallucinations to be\nmeaningful and to have particular relevance to them. The\nimages within their hallucination played out as memories\nand manifested as recognizable people and events, which in\nmany cases intensified their experiences of the hallucinatory\nevent. Although the inhibitory ability might indeed repre-\nsent a significant role in the phenomenology of externally\ndriven hallucinations, this does not imply that the proposed\ninhibitory disturbances are the sole factors in producing the\nhallucinatory experience. The exact processes that underlie\nVHs remain largely unidentified, but center around two\nmain avenues of research; one focuses on the neuroanatomi-\ncal networks and pathways using brain imaging techniques,\nwhereas the other focuses on cognitive and psychological\nprocesses along with the study of mental events involved in\nVHs.\nPrevious work with PD patients experiencing VHs has\nfound intact visual imagery, but poor executive function\n(Barnes & Boubert, 2008), and poor object perception when\n\"switching\" between modalities at study and test stages\n(Barnes et al., 2003). Together, these studies implicate inhibi-\ntory control as a factor in the hallucinatory phenomenon.\nHowever, they did not, unlike the present study, separate hal-\nlucinators based on phenomenological characteristics, so\nalthough inhibitory mechanisms are implicated, they may\nplay a large role in externally driven hallucinations. These\ncurrent findings therefore highlight the complexity of the\nprocesses involved and perhaps the need to characterize the\nhallucinating individual more precisely before we can exam-\nine the cognitive mechanisms implicated. Internally driven\nhallucinations in individuals may be a result of a failure to\nidentify events as self-driven and could occur because of\nspecific deficits in episodic memory. In this study, patients\nwith these hallucinations had a particular deficient short-\nterm memory for words but not digits. This behavioral pat-\ntern may be a result of tasks difficulty, but still requires\nfurther investigation. Specific deficits in memory may cause\nconfusion regarding the origins of the experience. In support\nof this premise, findings suggest that PD patients with VHs\ntend to misidentify the origins and source of stimuli during\nmemory events (Barnes et al., 2003). From a neuroanatomi-\ncal viewpoint, deficits in the executive function of patients\nwith VHs are consistent with the notion of cognitive inhibi-\ntory deficits; indeed, the disruption of executive functions in\nPD patients has previously been reported (Brown, Schneider,\n& Lidsky, 1997), and there is evidence of hippocampal\ninvolvement in PD with VHs that could link the deficits seen\nhere with the internally driven subtype (Ibarretxe-Bilbao\nThe challenge in this area is in determining whether or not\nthese cognitive deficits are dissociable between patients with\ndifferent types of hallucinatory experiences. This study has\nhighlighted that inhibitory control may have a greater asso-\nciation with hallucinations that manifest themselves from\nenvironmental stimuli and may well be initiated in a bottom-\nup approach from environmental cues. Indeed, the Perception\nand Attention Deficit (PAD) model of VHs proposes that a\ncombination of attention deficits and abnormal object per-\nception is necessary in the occurrence of recurrent complex\nVHs (Collerton et al., 2005). Problems with inhibitory con-\ntrol have been linked to a disruption of striatal-dopaminergic\nprojections thought to be particularly salient for selective\nattention (Casey, Durston, & Fossella, 2001; Casey,\nTottenham, & Fossella, 2002). Furthermore, we hypothesize\nthat there may well be a functional lack of connectivity\nbetween the frontal and posterior areas in visually hallucinat-\ning patients that manifest themselves as a lack of frontal\nmodulatory control of over activation within the visual cor-\ntex; subsequently, events that arise are not synchronized\nnormally.\n6 SAGE Open\nConclusion\nA question raised by the results of this study is the degree to\nwhich cognitive impairments seen in PD patients are a uni-\nform set of factors and to what extent are these factors ulti-\nmately responsible for VHs. It seems that not only do\npsychological factors, such as beliefs and attributions, need\nto be considered when approaching this question, but also\nthe possibility that differing cognitive profiles of the indi-\nviduals, which have been highlighted here, may play a key\nmodulatory role in shaping the hallucinatory experience.\nPerhaps further speculation on this issue should be\nwithheld until a replication of these findings has been\nproduced.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAarsland, D., Larsen, J.
