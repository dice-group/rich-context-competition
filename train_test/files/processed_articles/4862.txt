FSH plays a crucial role in recruit-\nment, selection and dominance; LH acts\nthrough the middle-to-late follicular phase\nby contributing to dominance maturation\nand ovulation. Meanwhile, LH promotes\nthe biosynthesis of androgens, which are the\nsubstrate for oestradiol (E2\nThe effect of LH supplementation on\nin vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes has\nbeen evaluated in several areas. For exam-\nple, in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone\n(GnRH) agonist protocol, because of pitu-\nitary desensitization, endogenous levels of\nLH are very low during the late stimulation\nphase.3 What is more, around 50% of\npatients undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic\nsperm injection (ICSI) using GnRH agonist\nare LH deficient.3 Thus, it would seem\nlogical that LH supplementation would be\nbeneficial to IVF/ICSI results. However,\nwhether LH supplementation during the\nlate follicular phase can increase the preg-\nnancy and implantation rates or decrease the\nspontaneous abortion rate is still a subject\nIn contrast, the effect of LH supplemen-\ntation on IVF outcomes for patients who\nshow a suboptimal response to FSH has also\nbeen evaluated by many investigators.8,9\nEven though it is still unclear exactly how\nLH supplementation affects follicular devel-\nopment, a growing amount of evidence\ndemonstrating the beneficial effect of LH\nsupplementation in patients who show sub-\noptimal response to FSH has been pub-\nlished.8,9 Studies have shown that LH\nsupplementation not only improves\nembryo quality but also increases the\npregnancy rate in women with poor ovarian\nSeveral studies have been conducted to\nassess the role of LH supplementation in the\nearly phase of follicular growth.11\u00ad13 It has\nbeen shown that LH might increase granu-\nlosa cell FSH sensitivity by increasing\nandrogen synthesis during the early stage\nof folliculogenesis. However, because of\nrelatively small sample sizes, these studies\nwere underpowered for pregnancy rate as a\nprimary outcome and were inconclusive as\nto the benefit of recombinant LH (rLH)\npriming in patients undergoing IVF/\nThe aim of this systematic review and\nmeta-analysis was to summarize the existing\nevidence on the effect of rLH priming during\nthe early follicular phase on IVF/ICSI\noutcomes.\nMaterials and methods\nLiterature search\nLiterature searches were conducted to\nretrieve randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs) on the effect of early follicular\nphase rLH supplementation in patients\nundergoing IVF with normal ovary reserva-\ntion on IVF/ICSI outcome. MEDLINE\u00d5,\nEMBASE and the Cochrane Database of\nClinical Trials were searched up to May\n2013 using the following search strategy:\n(`recombinant luteinizing hormone' or\n`luveris' or `lutropin alfa' or `recombinant\nrLH' or `rLH') AND (`recombinant follicle\nstimulation hormone' or `rFSH' or `recom-\nbinant FSH' or `rhFSH') AND (`assisted\nreproductive techniques' or `ART' or `IVF'\nor `ICSI' or `in vitro fertilization' or `intra-\ncytoplasmic sperm injections'). The searches\nwere not limited by language, but restricted\nto RCTs. A combination of text words and\nspecific database indexing terminology were\nused to search available RCTs.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria were RCTs that compared\nthe effect of rLH priming in the early\nfollicular phase on IVF/ICSI outcomes and\novarian stimulation parameters. Exclusion\ncriteria included failure to report appropri-\nate randomization procedures, participants\nas poor responders, or early follicular phase\nLH priming with other agents (e.g. human\nchorionic gonadotropin [hCG], dehydroe-\npiandrosterone, letrozole or human meno-\npausal gonadotropin [hMG]).\nData collection\nStudies were screened by two reviewers (Z.B.\nand L.H.) independently and there were no\ndisagreements in the studies identified for\ninclusion. First, all titles and abstracts from\nthe databases were examined, but only those\nwith the possibility of meeting the prede-\nfined criteria were kept for further evalu-\nation. Secondly, final inclusion decisions\nwere made on examination of the full\nmanuscripts. If the published study was\njudged to contain insufficient information,\nstudy authors were contacted. The primary\noutcome was ongoing pregnancy rate.\nSecondary outcomes included the number\nof oocytes retrieved, recombinant FSH\n(rFSH) dosage, E2\nlevel on the day of hCG\nadministration and number of embryos\nproduced.\nData synthesis and analysis\nAll data extracted were combined for meta-\nanalysis using RevMan version 5.0 software\n(Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).\nDichotomous data for each unit of analysis\nwere expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with\n95% confidence intervals (CIs). Continuous\nvariables were expressed as weighted mean\ndifference (WMD) with 95% CIs.\nHeterogeneity was evaluated using the\nQ-test and I2-index values, and reported\nfor each outcome as a P-value and percent-\nage, respectively. Data from the studies were\ncombined using a fixed-effects model when\nheterogeneity was negligible, or a random-\neffects model when significant heterogeneity\nexisted. A P-value < 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nThe process of literature identification and\nselection is summarized in Figure 1. A total\narticles were reviewed in detail, and of these,\nfive RCTs were considered eligible for inclu-\nsion.11\u00ad15 Of these five studies, one study\nexamined whether exogenous LH adminis-\ntration during the early follicular phase had\na beneficial effect on the IVF outcomes.15\nHowever, the ovarian stimulation protocol\nin the study group started with 1 ampule of\nhMG (75 IU FSH \u00fe 75 IU LH activity) daily\nfor 4 days, with simultaneous administra-\ntion of rFSH.15 Another study assessed the\neffect of short-term pre-rFSH administra-\ntion of LH in women entering an ICSI cycle\non follicular development, oocyte quality\nand early embryo development.14 LH prim-\ning was achieved by 7 days' administration\nof 200 IU/day hCG when ovarian suppres-\nsion had occurred.14 Therefore, these two\ntrials were excluded because the aim of this\nstudy was to explore the effect of rLH\npriming on IVF/ICSI outcomes.\nThree studies were considered eligible for\ninclusion in this meta-analysis, which\nincluded 346 patients undergoing IVF/ICSI\nwith or without rLH priming.11\u00ad13 In these\nthree studies, all patients were treated with\nthe standard long protocol. Pituitary desen-\nsitization was achieved by using GnRH-a\n(depot tryptorelin, buserelin or short-acting\ntriptorelin) to inhibit a premature LH surge.\nAll three trials with a total of 325 women\nprovided data on the ongoing pregnancy\nrates (note that not all 346 women included\nin the studies were able to undergo embryo\ntransfer).

FSH stimulates growth\nand recruitment of immature follicles in the\novary. In the early follicular phase, FSH is\nthe major survival factor that rescues the\nsmall antral follicles (2\u00ad5 mm in diameter for\nhumans) from apoptosis. LH, which is well\nknown for its importance in the late follicu-\nlar phase, supports theca cells in the ovaries\nthat provide androgens and hormonal pre-\ncursors for oestradiol production.16,17 Thus,\nin the process of IVF, to imitate the changes\nFigure 6.

SD, standard deviation; IV,\ninverse variance; CI, confidence interval.\nof FSH and LH in natural folliculogenesis,\nrLH or hMG are usually added in the late\nfollicular phase during ovarian stimulation.\nAlthough controversy remains about the\nefficacy of this procedure, LH supplementa-\ntion during the late follicular phase is\nemployed worldwide to help follicles reach\nmaturation.\nMost of the studies concerning the effect\nof LH supplementation on IVF outcomes\nwere designed to administer LH in the late\nfollicular phase or in patients who showed a\nsuboptimal response to FSH.9,10 However,\nlittle is known about the role of LH in the\nearly follicular stage. The complex roles\nplayed by FSH, LH and other hormones\nduring folliculogenesis have become better\nunderstood. High LH and androgen con-\ncentrations, which used to be considered as\nindicators of less healthy follicles in the early\nfollicular phase, are now found to have a\npositive effect on granulosa cell activity of\nsmaller follicles.18 LH not only promotes the\ngrowth of larger follicles, but also increases\ngranulosa cell FSH activity by increasing\nandrogen synthesis.19 In addition, it is\nknown that the cytoplasmic maturational\nprocess is controlled by E2\nalso responsible for the production of\nandrogen precursors by theca cells, which\nare required for E2\nbiosynthesis, LH is\ncrucial for the process of oocyte matur-\nation.19 Therefore, it is reasonable to\nhypothesize that if rLH is administered in\nthe early follicular phase before ovarian\nstimulation, in women undergoing IVF/\nICSI with the GnRH agonist protocol, (i)\nmore follicles might be recruited, less rFSH\nmay be required and more oocytes may be\nretrieved, since LH has a synergistic effect\nwith FSH in follicular recruitment and\ngranulosa cell proliferation; (ii) oocyte qual-\nity might be increased, which leads to an\nincreased yield of viable embryos and even a\nhigher pregnancy rate.\nIndeed, according to the results of the\npresent meta-analysis, patients treated with\nrLH priming needed less rFSH to achieve\noocyte maturation and tended to yield\nmore oocytes, compared with those treated\nwith rFSH alone. However, it must also be\nborne in mind that patients treated with\nrLH priming needed more LH compared\nwith control patients. Meanwhile, the\nnumber of embryos was comparable\nbetween these two groups, even though\nthe peak E2\nlevel was significantly higher in\nthe rLH priming group. All of these results\nwere consistent with our hypothesis.\nHowever, all three RCTs observed a\nhigher pregnancy rate in the rLH priming\ngroup, but the differences were not statis-\ntically significant.\nThe validity and interpretation of a\nmeta-analysis mainly depends on the qual-\nity and homogeneity of the included stu-\ndies. Therefore, only RCTs with LH\npriming using rLH were included into\nthis study. However, it is acknowledged\nthat this systematic review and meta-ana-\nlysis has several potential limitations. First,\nthere was clinical and methodological het-\nerogeneity between the three included\nRCTs. Durnerin et al.11 used depot\nGnRH agonist for pituitary downregula-\ntion and a dose of 300 IU/day of rLH for 7\ndays of priming, whereas the other two\nstudies used daily GnRH agonist down-\nregulation and 75 IU/day of rLH for 4\ndays of priming.12,13 It cannot be excluded\nthat these clinical variations might be\nassociated with the effectiveness or not of\nrLH priming. Another problem encoun-\ntered in this meta-analysis was that the\ntotal number of RCTs included was rela-\ntively small. Although no heterogeneity\nwas observed in the analysis of ongoing\npregnancy rate, rFSH dosage and E2\nlevel\non the day of hCG administration, there\nwas significant heterogeneity in the analysis\nof the number of oocytes retrieved and the\nnumber of embryos produced. In addition,\ngiven the small sample sizes, the CIs for\nsome of the outcomes were extremely wide.\nMeanwhile, due to the limited number of\nstudies included in this meta-analysis, it\nwas not possible to perform funnel plots to\nexamine publication bias, undertake sub-\ngroup analyses and meta-regression\nanalyses.\nIn conclusion, based on the best available\nevidence, this systematic review and meta-\nanalysis found that there is insufficient evi-\ndence that patients undergoing IVF/ICSI\nmay benefit from rLH priming during the\nearly follicular phase. However, because of\nthe limited number of RCTs included in this\nstudy, larger well-designed RCTs are needed\nto determine whether rLH priming is bene-\nficial to IVF/ICSI outcomes.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China (Grant\nYouth Foundation of The First Affiliated\nHospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou,\nHenan Province, China.\nReferences\n1.
