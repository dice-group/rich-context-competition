Hearing loss is increasingly common among older persons and is negatively associated with health and\nwell-being. Its impact on spouses, however, is poorly researched. This study analyzed the relationship between a spouse's\nself-assessed hearing loss and his or her partner's physical, psychological, and social well-being 5 years later.\nMethods. Subjects were 418 older married couples from the Alameda County Study. Hearing loss and adjustment vari-\nables were assessed in 1994 and outcomes in 1999. Longitudinal analyses included multivariate statistical models using\ngeneralized estimating equations to adjust for paired data and partners' hearing loss, age, gender, chronic conditions, and\nfinancial problems.\nResults. Spouse hearing loss increased the likelihood of subsequent poorer physical, psychological, and social well-\nbeing in partners. The negative impact of husbands' hearing loss on wives' well-being appears stronger than the reverse.\nDiscussion. Findings suggest that early diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss constitute important clinical strategies\nto enhance the well-being of both hearing-impaired individuals and their spouses and support policy change to cover\nhearing devices by insurance. Further research incorporating theoretical perspectives from communication theory and\nqualitative methodology would enhance understanding of how hearing loss impacts older couples and support refinement\nof interventions to promote quality of life.\nONE of the most prevalent chronic conditions in older\npersons, hearing loss is experienced by .25% of those\na near doubling over the last 30 years in the United States, is\nhigher at all adult ages for males than for females in frequencies\nabove 1000 Hz, and is becoming increasingly prevalent at\nChmiel, Stach, & Spretnjak, 1993; Morrell, Gordon-Salant,\nIn spite of the prevalence of hearing loss, older adults and\nhealth care providers do not necessarily place much emphasis on\nits treatment because it is often considered a normal age-related\nchange and not a life-threatening condition (Kochkin, 1999).\nYet hearing loss has significant implications for health and\nfunctioning in old age as it is associated with multiple negative\noutcomes in physical, psychological, and social domains. These\ninclude diminished functional status and physical disability,\ndepression, altered self-esteem, and loneliness (Chen, 1994;\nWallhagen, Strawbridge, Shema, Kurata, & Kaplan, 2001).\nThe negative effects of hearing loss are not difficult to\nunderstand if they are considered within the context of social\nrelationships. Individuals are embedded in a social and cultural\ncontext that includes meaningful relationships and shared\nunderstandings. Social connectedness and strong social ties\nare shown repeatedly to be important factors in the health and\nwell-being of older adults. As early as 1979, lack of strong\nsocial relations was associated with increased mortality (Berk-\nman & Syme, 1979), a finding supported by additional animal\nas well as human data (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). A\nrecent comprehensive review that focused specifically on the\npositive effects of friends and family on health outcomes in\nolder adults reaffirmed this association and documented\nassociations between social relationships and physical health,\nmental health, and recovery from illness (Seeman, 2000). This\nlatter review acknowledged, however, the potential negative\neffects of poor relationships, an issue that emphasizes the\nimportance of interactive patterns (Rook, 1984) and the\ncomplex nature of social ties (Kawachi & Berkman, 2001;\nCommunication is essential to relationships. Cronen, Pearce,\nand Harris (1982) noted that ordinary communication is ``the\nlocus of powerful forces through which persons cocreate,\nmaintain, and alter social order, personal relationships, and\nindividual identities. . . . [It] is not simply one of many things\nthat persons do in relationships; it is the process of maintain-\ning and creating relationships'' (pp. 64\u00ad65). Hummert and\nNaussbaum (2001) even suggested that communication pro-\nvides the essential link between health and successful aging.\nHowever, with the onset of hearing loss, long-standing patterns\nof communication can be altered and patterns previously taken\nfor granted may no longer work. When communication breaks\ndown, all persons involved in a relationship are affected.\nUnfortunately, although studies have investigated the impact\nof hearing loss on the affected person, minimal data are avail-\nable on its effects on the person's family or spouse. Some stud-\nies focus on families with hearing-impaired or deaf children\n(Calderon, Bargones, & Sidman, 1998; Lederberg & Everhart,\nmembers are included in studies of older adults, the focus is\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nusually on the family member's perception of the impact of\nhearing loss on the affected person rather than the family\nmember. For example, a recent small study (N \u00bc 40) showed\nthat when a significant other was involved in the pre-hearing\naid fitting discussions, patients reported improved hearing aid\nbenefit in terms of ease of communication and the aversiveness\nof sounds (Hoover-Steinwart, English, & Hanley, 2001); data\nwere not collected on how this process affected the significant\nother. Newman and Weinstein (1988) studied the effects of\na hearing aid on elderly hearing-impaired men and their spouses\nusing the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE)\nand the HHIE-SP (spouse version). The reduction in hearing\nhandicap was greater for the hearing-impaired person than for\nthe spouse, but the questionnaire asked the spouse to rate her\nhusband, not herself (e.g., ``Does your spouse feel handicapped\nby a hearing problem?''). Similarly, the McCarthy\u00adAlpiner\nScale of Hearing Handicap designed for a family member also\nrequests information about the hearing-impaired individual (e.g.,\n``He gets upset if he cannot hear or understand a conversation'';\nMcCarthy & Alpiner, 1983). Guides addressing hearing loss\nthat do discuss family interactions tend to emphasize assisting\nthe family member to help the hearing-impaired individual join\nin or understand. Thus, the impact of one spouse's hearing loss\non the other usually goes unexplored.\nOne Canadian study did assess the effects of hearing loss on\nintimate relationships, but in a working adult sample (He\n\u00b4tu,\nJones, & Getty, 1993). Most of the article was a theoretical\ndiscussion of the problem, but some descriptive data on inter-\nviews held with both partners were included. The data highlight\nthe stress, effort/fatigue, frustration, anger, resentment, and\nguilt that are experienced by the unimpaired partner, emphasiz-\ning the importance of interviewing partners as well as the person\nwith the loss. Yet the authors pointed out that the impact on the\nunimpaired partner is rarely acknowledged.\nIn a recently published study from England, Morgan-Jones\n(2001) explored the effects of hearing loss in 11 couples and\nfive single/divorced individuals. Her findings demonstrate the\nimportance of the dyadic relationship in the management of\nhearing loss but also the potential of the hearing loss to disrupt\nthis relationship. Several of the older single/divorced partic-\nipants blamed hearing loss for the breakup of their marriages,\nand one couple divorced after the interviews were complete.\nHowever, the study is limited in providing an understanding of\nhearing loss in older adults and their spouses, because eight\nof the couples were young or middle-aged adults (aged 26\u00ad47),\nand five were married after the hearing loss was established in\nthe affected individual.\nFurther supporting the potential effect that hearing loss\nin one family member can have on another are data suggest-\ning that treating hearing loss may diminish caregiver burden\n(Desbiens, Mueller-Rizner, Virnig, & Lynn, 2001; Palmer,\nAdams, Bourgeois, Durrant, & Rossi, 1999). To our knowl-\nedge, however, no systematic study has been made of older\nhusbands and wives where both have been directly assessed.\nFurther, most studies are cross-sectional and thus limit the as-\nsessment of causality.\nThe purpose of the current study was to analyze the\nlongitudinal impact of hearing loss experienced by a husband\nor wife on the well-being of the respective spouse. Domains of\nwell-being explored parallel those found to be affected by\nhearing loss in hearing-impaired individuals: physical, psycho-\nlogical, and social. Because gender differences are common in\nmany aspects of gerontologic research and data suggest that\nmarriage and relationships have a differential impact on men\nfor spouses in general and for husbands and wives specifically.\nFindings are discussed in relationship to their implications for\nfuture research, clinical practice, and health policy.\nData are from a longitudinal study of health and well-being\nthat has a sufficiently large sample size to allow for inclusion\nof potential confounding variables, adjustments for paired\ndata, and statistical significance testing of any observed gender\ndifferences.\nSpecific research questions were the following: (a) To what\nextent does hearing loss in an older spouse affect the physical,\npsychological, and social well-being of his or her partner? and\n(b) Are any observed effects different for husbands than for\nwives?\nMETHODS\nSample\nDesigned to assess the longitudinal effects of a wide range\nof health behaviors and demographic characteristics on health\nand well-being, the Alameda County Study began in 1965 by\nrandom sample of households (Berkman & Breslow, 1983).\nIncluding the cities of Berkeley and Oakland, Alameda County\nwas selected partly because its population was typical of other\nAmerican urban areas in a variety of ways including age and\nsurveys.\nBecause all members of selected households were eligible\nto take part in the survey, 72% of those originally enrolled\nwere married couples. Attrition because of mortality, divorce,\nseparation, or other loss to follow-up reduced the proportion\nof intact couples over the length of the study, but the 1994\nwho were still married to each other and living together. One or\nboth members of 8 couples were missing data on hearing loss\nor adjustment variables and so were omitted, making the final\nsample size 418 couples. Missing data for individual outcome\nvariables were few (mean \u00bc 4.5 couples). Mean age of the hus-\nand 89.0% of the wives were in their first marriage.\nMeasures\nHearing loss and adjustment variables were based on mea-\nfollow-up survey.\nHearing loss. --Hearing loss was self-assessed: Subjects were\nasked how much difficulty they had (even with a hearing aid)\nhearing and understanding words in a normal conversation,\nhearing words clearly over the telephone, and hearing well\nenough to carry on a conversation in a noisy room. Response\nsets and scores for level of difficulty for each of the three\nquestions were a great deal (3), some (2), a little (1), or none\n(0). Scores were summed. The resulting scale had a range from\n0 to 9; higher scores indicate greater hearing loss. In a previous\nanalysis of Alameda County Study data, this scale predicted\nsubsequent poor mental health and well-being for subjects with\nincreased levels of hearing loss (Wallhagen, Strawbridge, &\nHealth and other adjustment variables. --Chronic conditions\nincluded a count of the prevalence in the last 12 months of\n11 conditions: arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, cancer, diabetes,\nemphysema, heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis,\nperipheral artery disease, and stroke. Financial hardship\nincluded any one of the following: not having enough money\nin the last 12 months to buy clothing, fill a prescription, see\na doctor, pay rent or mortgage, or (in the last 30 days) buy food.\nOutcome Measures\nBased on previous data regarding the widespread impact\nof hearing loss on the person with a hearing loss, outcome\nmeasures were chosen that assessed three areas of well-being:\nphysical, psychological, and social.\nPhysical well-being included energy level, self-rated physical\nhealth, physical disability, and physical frailty. Energy level\nwas assessed by asking subjects whether they had more or less\nenergy than most people their age. Responses were coded as (1)\na little or a lot less versus (0) a little or a lot more. Self-rated\nphysical health was assessed by asking subjects whether their\nhealth was excellent, good, fair, or poor. Responses were coded\nas (1) fair or poor versus (0) good or excellent. Physical dis-\nability was assessed using seven variables: getting up from\na stooping, kneeling, or crouching position; lifting or carrying\na weight over 10 lb; pulling or pushing a large object; reaching\nor extending arms above the shoulder; standing up after sitting\nin a chair; stooping, crouching, or kneeling; and writing or\nThose reporting having a lot of difficulty or needing help on\none or more of the items were coded as (1) physically disabled\nversus (0) not physically disabled. Physical frailty was assessed\nwith four questions asking how frequently in the last 12 months\nsubjects had experienced a sudden loss of balance, weakness\nin their legs, weakness in their arms, and dizziness or fainting\nwhen they stood up quickly. Responding often or very often to\nany of the items was coded as (1) physically frail versus (0) not\nphysically frail.\nPsychological well-being included depression, self-rated\nmental health, negative affect, and happiness. Depression was\nmeasured using the 12 items that operationalize the diagnostic\ncriteria for a major depressive episode outlined in Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., rev.;\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, 1994). Designated the\nDSM-12D, the items were adapted from the PRIME-MD mood\ndisorders section of the manual. Subjects experiencing five\nor more symptoms of depression almost every day for the last\n2 weeks, including disturbed mood (feeling sad, blue, or\ndepressed) or anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in most\nthings), were coded as (1) experiencing a major depressive\nepisode versus (0) not experiencing a depressive episode. Self-\nrated mental health followed the same format as self-rated\nphysical health: Responses were coded as (1) fair or poor\nversus (0) excellent or good. Negative affect was measured\nusing the eight-item Bradburn Affect Balance Scale (Bradburn,\n1969); those whose negative affect scores were higher than\ntheir positive affect scores were coded as (1) having negative\naffect versus (0) not having negative affect. Happiness was\nassessed using a single item, coded as (1) not too happy versus\n(0) pretty or very happy.\nSocial well-being was assessed by questions covering four\ntopics: frequency of going out for entertainment, enjoyment of\nfree time, feeling close to others, and marital quality. Frequency\nof going out for entertainment asked subjects how often they\nwent out for entertainment, plays, or movies. Responses were\ncoded as (1) never versus (0) sometimes or often. Enjoyment of\nfree time asked subjects how much enjoyment they got out of\ntheir free time; responses were coded as (1) not very much or\nsome versus (0) a lot. Feeling close to others was worded\nas ``It's hard for me to feel close to others'' and involved a\ntrue/false format. Coding was (1) true versus (0) false. Marital\nquality was measured by a question asking subjects whether\ntheir spouses gave them as much understanding as they needed;\nresponses were coded as (1) no versus (0) yes but not com-\npletely or yes completely.\nAnalysis Strategy\nLogistic regression was used to estimate the effects of the hear-\ning loss of the spouse measured in 1994 on physical, psycho-\nlogical, and social well-being of his or her partner as measured in\nhearing loss score of his or her spouse; covariates included the\npartner's age, gender, number of chronic conditions, financial\nhardship, and own hearing loss score in 1994.\nAnalyses of data from couples require special adjustments\nbecause the assumption of independent observations is not met.\nHusbands and wives married to each other share more attributes\nthan would a sample of unrelated husbands and wives. The\ngeneralized estimating equation (GEE) method of Liang and\nZeger (1986) can be used with logistic regression to deal with\nthe correlations between members of a couple. Therefore, all\nlogistic regression analyses were conducted using this method.\nTo first assess the impact of spouses' hearing loss on their\npartners' physical, psychological, and social well-being in-\ndependent of gender, statistical models were run with gender\nincluded as an adjustment variable. Differences in outcomes\nbetween husbands and wives were then assessed by adding\ngender-by-spouse hearing loss interaction terms to each model.\nOwing to the reduced power associated with the use of such\ninteraction terms, a less stringent significance level than .05\nmay be used to assess the likelihood that interaction is present\nstatistical significance of tests of gender differences. All other\nstatistical tests used .05 (two-tailed) significance levels. To\nallow both the strength and the precision of the relationships to\nbe better assessed, results are presented as odds ratios with their\nassociated 95% confidence intervals. Calculations were per-\nformed using SAS software (PROC GENMOD) Version 8.2\nRESULTS\nBaseline characteristics are shown separately for husbands\nand wives in Table 1. The age range is broad, with over one\nthird of the husbands and nearly one fourth of the wives aged\nyears older than the 1994 ages represented in the table. Recent\nfinancial problems were reported by 10% of the husbands and\n12% of the wives. Over half of the subjects reported one or\nmore chronic conditions. Consistent with the national figures\ndiscussed in the introductory section, the men scored higher on\nthe hearing loss scale than did the women.\nResults of the regression analyses are shown in Table 2. The\nodds ratios indicate the increased odds of each outcome for the\npartner for each 1 point increase in his or her spouse's hear-\ning loss score 5 years earlier. All coefficients are adjusted for\ngender, age, financial problems, number of chronic conditions,\nand the partner's own hearing loss score.\nThe first set of results presents the outcomes for partners\nregardless of their gender. With the exceptions of two social vari-\nables (never go out for entertainment and not much understand-\ning from spouse), all of the results are statistically significant and\nindicate that hearing loss of a spouse predicts poorer physical,\npsychological, and social well-being in his or her partner even\nwhen the partner's own hearing loss is taken into account.\nThe other two sets of odds ratios and associated confidence\nintervals in Table 2 present results for husbands based on their\nwives' hearing loss and for wives based on their husbands'\nhearing loss. All coefficients for the wives are statistically\nsignificant compared with none for the husbands. For un-\nderstanding from spouse, the difference in outcomes between\nhusbands and wives was statistically significant as tested by the\ngender interaction test.\nDISCUSSION\nLimitations of the analyses presented here include the use\nof self-assessed measures for hearing loss and the relatively\nwide age range of the subjects. Self-report data are useful for\nmeasuring a subject's own sense of hearing loss in the world in\nwhich he or she functions, but validation by and comparison\nwith audiometric testing would add another dimension. Further,\nbecause there is a wide age range of over 40 years, it would be\nuseful to use a larger data set to analyze whether the findings\nvary across different age cohorts. Given these limitations, these\nfindings contribute to our current understanding of the impact\nof hearing loss on individuals and their spouses.\nPrevious data demonstrate the negative impact that hearing\nloss has on the affected individual. Still, although audiology\ntexts note the importance of including family in the assessment\nand treatment process (Weinstein, 2000), minimal data are\navailable on the impact of hearing loss on the hearing-impaired\nindividual's family or spouse. This study begins to address this\ngap in our knowledge and demonstrates that the hearing loss of\na spouse impacts the well-being of his or her partner across\na wide range of domains. Further, whereas the odds ratios do\nnot appear large, each odds ratio is based upon only a 1-point\nincrease in the spouse's hearing loss score. Although the cur-\nrent data do not allow a clear delineation of the mechanisms\nby which hearing loss in one partner affects well-being across\nsuch a broad range of domains, some data inform the findings\nand suggest areas for future research as well as potential clinical\nand policy implications.\nAs noted earlier, communication is central to the formation\nand maintenance of relationships. Greeff (2000) found that the\nmarital characteristic that was most important to well-function-\ning families was effective communication between spouses.\nHowever, communication usually evolves into a specific pat-\ntern or relational schema within any relationship (Koerner &\nFitzpatrick, 2002). Additionally, individuals often have specific\nexpectations regarding communication with different indi-\nviduals and within different settings (termed ``communication\nstandards'') and can experience discrepancies between these\nstandards and what actually occurs (Caughlin, 2003). In the\nsetting of long-term marriages, the onset of hearing loss creates\na need to change potentially long-standing patterns of relating\nand can create unmet needs and affect quality of life. Further\nresearch is needed to gain a better understanding of how older\nadults negotiate changing roles and relationships in the context\nof hearing loss.\nAnother influencing factor may be the hearing-impaired\nindividual's own altered well-being. Hearing loss is consistently\nfound to impact the well-being of the affected individual, and\ndata suggest that the psychological well-being of a spouse\ninfluences the psychological well-being of his or her partner\n(Dufouil & Alpe\nIn addition, if a spouse serves as a confidant, hearing loss alters\nthe extent to which he or she can fulfill this role. Further,\nactivities carried out as a couple are potentially constricted; for\nexample, if the hearing-impaired spouse no longer wants to go\nto concerts or plays. This is reflected in the item ``do not enjoy\nfree time.''\nOf additional interest is the finding that although the gender\ninteraction test identified only one statistically significant\nHusbands Wives\nCharacteristic No. % No. %\nAge (years)\nEthnicity\nRecent financial problems\nNo. of chronic conditions\nHearing loss scale score\ndifference between husbands and wives and thus focuses\nattention back on the noninteraction models, the gender-specific\nresults suggest that the findings of the combined models are\ndriven by the impact of a husband's hearing loss on his wife\nrather than on both partners equally. More research is needed to\nfurther support these findings, but data from communication\ntheory as well as other literature provide a perspective that may\nexplain the differential impact of hearing loss on a wife and\nsuggest directions for future investigations.\nCommunication and relationship needs may differ across the\nWhite, 1989). Thus, hearing loss may differentially influence\ncommunication, relationships, and well-being in older couples.\nMoen (1996) noted that research has shown a curvilinear rela-\ntionship between the family's life stage and the perceived marital\nquality of both men and women, but that, in general, men often\nderive more social and emotional support from within marriage\nthan do women, who have broader social ties. Greeff (2000)\nfound that women at several stages in their lives were less\nsatisfied than men with the type and level of communication in\ntheir marriage.\nAcitelli (2002) found that for wives, both marital and life\nsatisfaction were related to the proportion of time that was spent\ntalking about the marital relationship; this was not true for\nhusbands. Both men's and women's relationship talk was\nnegatively correlated with both partners' depression and\npositively correlated with sense of equity in the marriage.\nHowever, for women, relationship talk was also associated with\nsix additional outcomes including greater satisfaction with the\nrelationship and feeling cared for in the relationship. Further,\nAcitelli (2002) noted that studies have consistently demonstrated\nthat variables emphasizing the connections between partners are\nmore important to the well-being and relationship satisfaction of\nwives than of husbands.\nThese data suggest that communication may be more\nimportant for women in marriage than for men. They also\nsuggest that women may enter a relationship with communica-\ntion standards that differ from men. Acitelli (2002) suggested\nthat men view relational talk as important in problematic\nsituations and as a means to an end. In contrast, women may feel\nthat relational talk is an end in and of itself and thus important in\nboth problematic and normal situations. If communication is\nmore central to marital and life satisfaction for women,\nalterations in the ability to communicate effectively and easily\nwith a hearing-impaired spouse may have a more detrimental\nimpact on wives than husbands.\nAlternatively, if women value communication more than\nmen (Garstecki & Erler, 1999), they may be more willing to\nacknowledge hearing loss and utilize strategies to minimize\ntheir deficit. Some data do suggest that women are less likely to\nreturn hearing aids than men (Northern & Beyer, 1999). This\nwould minimize the impact of a woman's hearing loss on her\nhusband. In addition, several epidemiologic studies found that\nwhereas men experience greater high frequency loss, women\nmay exceed men in low frequency loss (1 kHz), although\nthese differences may be the result of testing artifact (Jerger\nsuggest that men and women may have difficulty hearing in\ndifferent settings and may differ in their experience of hearing\nloss. However, data regarding the effects of gender on the re-\nsponse to hearing loss are not consistent (Erdman & Demorest,\n1998), and only minimal data exist addressing any differences\nin terms of their implications for outcomes or approaches to care.\nHearing loss is a significant problem for older adults and their\npartners, affecting communication and quality of life. To date,\nfew studies have focused on the partner of the person with\nhearing loss, even though it is stressed that interventions should\ninvolve the family. Our data document the impact of an\nindividual's hearing loss on his or her partner but suggest that\nthis effect is predominantly on a wife rather than a husband.\nFurther research is needed in this area to replicate these findings.\nTo date, much of the literature on communication has occurred\nin isolation of the research on aging. Utilizing theoretical\nperspectives from communication theory may facilitate an\nTable 2.

In addition, research using qualitative\nmethods would contribute to our understanding of the meaning\nof hearing loss in older couples, strategies used to deal with\nhearing loss, and how they negotiate changes in long established\ncommunication patterns. Further, more research using both\nquantitative measures of hearing loss and qualitative assess-\nments is also needed to investigate potential differences in the\nexperience of hearing loss between men and women. Such data\nare needed to better target interventions to the families of\nhearing-impaired individuals and to promote the quality of life of\nolder adults.\nAlthough further research is needed, the findings from the\ncurrent study have clinical and policy implications. As noted\nearlier, most health care providers pay minimal attention to hear-\ning deficits because they are not immediately life threatening.\nFurther, when problems are addressed interventions are\ngenerally aimed at the affected person with less attention paid\nto family members (Fisher & Weihs, 2000; Moen & Forest,\n1995). Prior data demonstrated the impact of hearing loss on the\nwell-being of older adults; data from the current study\ndemonstrate that hearing loss has broader implications, affecting\nnot only the person with hearing loss but also his or her spouse.\nThis emphasizes the importance of treating hearing loss to\npromote the health and well-being of both affected individuals\nand their partners.\nAddressing hearing loss has other potential clinical ram-\nifications. The management of chronic illness occurs within\nthe context of the family, and the characteristics of family\nrelationships can influence disease management (Fisher &\nWeihs, 2000). Because hearing loss influences communication\nand can affect relationships, improving hearing capacity may\nfacilitate the management of other chronic conditions. It can\nalso facilitate communication with health care providers and\npromote understanding of treatment strategies. Additional\nresearch is needed to further understand these relationships.\nFinally, policy changes are also needed. As Moen and Forest\n(1995) noted, whereas policies tend to focus on families in their\nchildrearing phase, what we need are policies that promote the\neffective functioning of families and family members at all\nstages of life. Currently, Medicare and most other insurance\npolicies do not cover the cost of routine hearing evaluations or\nhearing aids, and Medicaid limits who is eligible and covers\nonly one aid. These policies ignore the wide-ranging impact of\nhearing loss and are not designed to assist families with chang-\ning communication needs across the life span. More data are\nneeded on the cost implications of not providing the resources\nnecessary to facilitate communication.\nIn summary, hearing loss has a significant effect not only on\nolder adults but also on their spouses. Because altered com-\nmunication affects a broad range of daily activities, policies and\ninterventions designed to enhance hearing capacity and promote\neffective communication strategies may have an important effect\non the well-being of older adults and their partners.\n"
