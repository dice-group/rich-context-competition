We aimed to\nreplicate TCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), compare it with persistent Mild Cognitive Impairment\n(PMCI), and to determine whether global cerebral hemodynamic changes could explain transient impairment.\nMethods: Consecutive patients with transient ischemic attack/minor stroke (NIHSS 3) were assessed with the MoCA\nand transcranial Doppler ultrasound acutely and at 1 month. We compared patients with TCI (baseline MoCA < 26\nwith ! 2 points increase at 1 month), PMCI (MoCA < 26 with < 2 points increase), and no cognitive impairment (NCI;\nthose with PMCI. Systolic BP fell between baseline and 1 month (mean reduction \u00bc 14.01 \u00c6 21.26 mmHg) and end-\nbut these changes did not differ between patients with TCI, PMCI, and NCI.\nConclusions: TCI is detectable with the MoCA after transient ischemic attack and minor stroke and has similar clinical\nand hemodynamic profile to PMCI. However, TCI does not appear to be due to exaggerated acute reversible global\nhemodynamic changes.\n",

For example,\ntransient cognitive impairment (TCI) after TIA or\nminor stroke, first described using the Mini Mental\nNuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford,\nOxford, UK\nCorresponding author:\nSara Mazzucco, Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Nuffield Department of\nClinical Neurosciences, Level 6, West Wing, John Radcliffe Hospital,\nUniversity of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.\nEmail: sara.mazzucco@ndcn.ox.ac.uk\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(9)\nInternational Journal of Stroke\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nwso.sagepub.com\nState Evaluation (MMSE), might predict an increased\nrisk of subsequent dementia on follow-up.8\nTCI might therefore identify a subgroup of patients\nwith exhausted cognitive reserve, but several issues\nremain to be resolved. First, TCI should be detectable\nusing cognitive tests other than the MMSE. Compared\nwith the MMSE, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment\ntest (MoCA) has proved to be more sensitive and spe-\ncific as a screening test for MCI,9 particularly after cere-\nbrovascular events, and it incorporates executive and\nattentional tasks suitable for vascular cognitive impair-\nment.10 We therefore aimed to determine the rate of TCI\nafter TIA and stroke using the MoCA. Second, the cause\nof TCI is unknown, but could be related to transient\nglobal flow disturbances due to changes in blood pres-\nsure, endothelial function, or platelet activation in the\nacute phase after TIA or minor stroke. Cerebral hypo-\nperfusion has been reported in the early stages of cogni-\ntive decline, using single-photon emission CT (SPECT)11\nand carotid ultrasound,12 and transcranial Doppler\n(TCD) studies have documented reduced blood flow\nvelocities (BFV) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA)\nWe therefore hypothesized that TCI and MCI might\nhave similar clinical and hemodynamic phenotypes and\nthat TCI might be due to exaggerated but reversible\nglobal hemodynamic changes in the acute phase of\nTIAs and minor strokes.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThis study was nested in the Oxford Vascular\n(OXVASC) Study, an ongoing population-based\nstudy of the incidence and outcome of all acute vascular\nevents in a population of 92,728 individuals registered\nwith 100 primary care physicians in nine practices in\nOxfordshire, UK. Multiple methods of ascertainment\nare used for patients with TIA or stroke, as detailed\nelsewhere.15 These include a daily, rapid-access TIA/\nstroke clinic, to which participating physicians and\nthe local emergency department refer all individuals\nwith suspected TIA or minor stroke.16\nConsecutive eligible patients attending the OXVASC\nrapid-access TIA/stroke clinic between November 2011\nand April 2015 were enrolled in the present study.\nPatients with presumed TIA or minor stroke\n(NIHSS 3) were eligible if they were able to undergo\ncognitive assessment; had no pre-existing clinical diag-\nnosis of dementia in the primary care records; had no\ndisabling neurological deficit due to previous events;\nwere willing and able to come back to clinic for a 1-\nmonth follow-up assessment; and had a temporal bone\nwindow suitable for ultrasound insonation.\nProcedures\nPatients enrolled in the study were evaluated at two\ntime-points, acutely, in the rapid-access TIA/stroke\nclinic, and at the 1-month follow-up visit. Patients\nwere assessed by a neurologist or stroke physician\nand all presentations and investigations were reviewed\nby the senior study neurologist. During the acute clin-\nical assessment, brain and vascular imaging were\nobtained, either 3T MRI with time-of-flight MRA of\nthe intracranial vessels and a contrast enhanced MRA\nof the large neck arteries or brain CT with contrast\nenhanced CTA/Duplex ultrasound if MRI was\ncontraindicated.\nThe MoCA was administered at initial assessment\nand was repeated at 1-month follow-up along with\nthe MMSE. At both time points, TCD sonography\n(Doppler Box, Compumedics DWL, Singen,\nGermany) was performed by one of three experienced\noperators, who were unaware of the patient's clinical\npresentation and results of cognitive assessment. MCA\nBFV was recorded with a handheld 2 MHz probe\nthrough temporal bone window at the depth that pro-\nvided the best signal. Each session was stored in the\nhard disk of the TCD device for subsequent off-line\nanalysis.\nSecondary prevention treatment was started after\nthe initial assessment and included aspirin (300 mg\nloading and then 75 mg daily), plus clopidogrel\nhigh-risk patients; atorvastatin (40 mg daily); antihy-\npertensive treatment (unless systolic blood pressure\nwas below 130 mm Hg on repeated measurement),\naccording to a standardized protocol: a combination\nof perindopril 5 mg and indapamide 1.25 mg followed\nby addition of amlodipine 5/10 mg, if necessary.\nThe OXVASC study and TCD assessment were\napproved by the local ethics committee and consent\nwas obtained from all participants.\nStatistical analysis\nTo validate TCI using the MoCA, the mean change in\nMoCA score between baseline and follow-up was cal-\nculated on all recruited patients. MoCA scores were\nalso divided into the 10 standard cognitive domains,9\nwhich included visuoexecutive, naming, digit spam,\nattention, calculation, repetition, verbal fluency,\nabstract reasoning, recall, and orientation. Changes in\neach sub-score were calculated between baseline and\nfollow-up.\nFor analyses of TCD parameters, patients with sig-\nnificant ICA or MCA stenosis (!50%)17 on vascular\nimaging were excluded, as were patients who had recur-\nrent stroke between baseline assessment and 1-month\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(9)\nfollow-up. However, to avoid any selection bias,\npatients recruited with what was considered initially\nto be a TIA, but in whom an alternative diagnosis\nwas subsequently made on the basis of further\ninvestigation and follow-up were included in the main\nanalysis, but sensitivity analyses excluding these cases\nwere also done.\nFor further analysis of TCD data, cognitive patterns\nwere classified as ``No cognitive impairment'' if MoCA\nscore at baseline assessment was ! 26. Patients with\nMoCA score <26 were classified as either ``Persistent\nmild cognitive impairment'' (PMCI) if their MoCA\nscore at 1 month did not increase by more than one\npoint, or ``TCI'' if their score increased by !2 points.\nDemographic, clinical, cognitive, physiological charac-\nteristics, and risk factors of patients in these three\ngroups were compared using 2 test or ANOVA as\nappropriate. Degree of white matter changes (WMC)\nin the three groups was compared using the age-related\nWMC scale for both CT and MRI,18 rating five differ-\nent regions in both hemispheres according to a 0\u00ad3\nscore. Total score was categorized as absent (0), mild\nTCD measures of peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-\ndiastolic velocity (EDV), mean flow velocity (MFV),\nand pulsatility index (PI) are given as a mean of the\naverage of two measurements on each side; systolic\nblood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure\n(DBP) are given as mean of two measurements taken\nduring the TCD procedure. Cerebrovascular resistance\nindex (CVRi \u00bc mean blood pressure/MFV) was also\ncalculated, consistently.\nAnalyses were repeated after stratification of\nand > 70 years of age. All analyses were done in\nResults\nAmong all 355 eligible patients initially recruited\n(Figure 1), there was a significant overall increase in\nmean MoCA score between baseline and follow-up\nMean/SD change was significant for the visuo-execu-\nFigure 1.

Of the remaining 326\nminor stroke and 58 (17.8%) had an eventual diagnosis\nof possible TIA or an alternative, most commonly\nmigraine variant (N \u00bc 22). Results of sensitivity ana-\nlyses of only patients with definite TIA/stroke are\nshown in Tables I and II of online supplement.\nIn the 326 eligible patients with repeat cognitive\nassessment and TCD at 1 month, mean SBP fell between\nSD \u00bc 21.26 mmHg), whereas mean (SD) PSV, EDV,\ncm/s).

Similarly, although time from the onset of\nthe TIA or stroke to seeking medical attention varied\nafter 7 days), cognitive group was unrelated to delay\n(Table 1). However, prevalence of TCI increased with\nTable 1.

The TCI\ngroup showed higher mean SBP and lower MCA\nBFVs (Table 2) at baseline assessment, mainly with\nlower MFV, EDV, and higher PI and CVRi. These dif-\nferences were also present at 1-month follow-up (Table\n2) and were most marked in patients aged ! 60 years\n(Table III of online supplement). However, the changes\nin SBP, DBP, EDV, MFV, and CVRi between baseline\nand FU were similar in the two groups (Table 2).\nIn contrast, patients with TCI did not differ from\npatients with PMCI in age (p \u00bc 0.19), pre-morbid disabil-\nity (p \u00bc 0.61), low education (p \u00bc 0.43), or other risk fac-\ntors (Table 1). Patients with TCI and PMCI also had\nsimilar physiological profiles in terms of BP and TCD\nparameters at baseline (Table 3). By definition, cognitive\nfunction was improved at 1 month in the TCI group\nand TCD parameters did not differ from those in\npatients with PMCI and NCI (Tables 2 and 3). These\nfindings did not change after excluding 36 (37%)\npatients with TCI in whom the MoCA at 1-month\nwas improved but nevertheless remained < 26 (data\nnot shown).\nDiscussion\nThis is the largest study, to our knowledge, of longitu-\ndinal changes of cognitive performance soon after a\nTIA/minor stroke. We showed an overall improvement\nin cognition between baseline assessment and 1-month\nfollow-up, confirming that reversible cognitive impair-\nment can be demonstrated after minor cerebral ische-\nmic events using the MoCA, which is more sensitive\nand specific than MMSE as a screening test for MCI9\nand for vascular cognitive impairment.10 We have also\nshown that patients with TCI have similar clinical and\nglobal hemodynamic characteristics to those with\npersisting MCI, but we were not able to explain reso-\nlution of TCI on the basis of improved MCA BFVs at\n1-month follow-up.\nPatients with TCI would, by definition, have been\nclassified as cognitively impaired when first seen in\nthe emergency clinic, scoring less than 26 on the\nMoCA. However, 63% of such patients scored ! 26 at\nthe 1-month follow-up visit. Improvement was seen\nmainly in recall, as previously demonstrated with the\nMMSE,8 but also in the visuospatial and abstraction\ndomain, confirming previous results with the MoCA,19\nwhich is more sensitive to visuo-executive and atten-\ntional domains.10 These findings support the advice\ngiven in some countries that temporary abstaining\nfrom driving, and perhaps from other cognitively com-\nplex tasks, is advisable after a TIA/minor stroke.\nNotwithstanding the improvement in the cognitive\nperformance, TCI patients displayed a functional pro-\nfile, risk factors, and MCA hemodynamic indices simi-\nlar to PMCI patients, and this applied also when\nrestricting the analysis only to the 63% of TCI patients\nwith ! 26 MoCA score at 1 month. That is, patients\nwith TCI who would have been classified as cognitively\nunimpaired at the 1-month follow-up visit had MCA\nperfusion indices similar to patients with persistent cog-\nnitive impairment. Previous data from the OXVASC\nstudy showed that TCI patients were more prone to\ndevelop cognitive decline and overt dementia on long-\nterm follow-up,8 and further follow-up of the current\ncohort will confirm whether lower MCA BFVs predict\ncognitive decline.14\nTCI could be an early manifestation of MCI in\npatients who are still usually performing within a\nnormal cognitive range, but who have very limited cog-\nnitive reserve. Preclinical stages of dementia are asso-\nciated to lower MCA MFVs,13,14 and higher PI could\npredict progression from MCI to overt dementia.20\nHowever, we could not find any relation between the\ntransient cognitive deterioration and changes in global\ncerebral hemodynamic variables. SBP and DBP\ndecreased equally across our three cognitive groups\nbetween baseline and follow-up, probably as a result\nof antihypertensive treatment (Tables 2 and 3), with\nsimilar increases in cerebral BFVs.21 Moreover, as the\nfrequency of TCI did not decrease with time since TIA\nor stroke, it is unlikely that an acute decrease in cere-\nbral perfusion secondary to the cerebral vascular event\ncould be the cause of transient of cognitive\nperturbation.\nConsistent with previous reports,8,18 TCI patients\nwere older than patients with no cognitive impairment.\nHowever, TCI patients were in the same age range as\npatients with PMCI. Cognition, BP, and cerebral flow\nvelocities are all strongly related to age.22 When our\npatients were stratified by age, the proportion with\nTCI increased with age, and the differences in global\nhemodynamic features between patients with TCI and\nNCI became more evident (Table III of online supple-\nment). Moreover, the differences were most evident in\nMCA EDV and MFV, which best reflect vascular\nresistance in cerebral circulation.23\nOur study has some limitations. First, the definition of\nTCI as a two or more point improvement in MoCA score\nhas not yet been widely standardized. However, it was\nbased on previous evidence that changes in MoCA\nscores between evaluations 1 month apart averaged 0.9\npoints,9 and is also consistent with the only previous study\non MoCA changes soon after TIA/minor stroke.18\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(9)\nTable 2.

TCI could, at least partly,\nbe a non-specific transient perturbation in cognition in\npatients with exhausted cognitive reserve related to anx-\niety rather than being specifically caused by the cerebro-\nvascular event, particularly in the acute assessment in a\nhospital setting with multiple unfamiliar investigations. A\nrole for anxiety might also explain why the frequency of\nTCI was independent of the time interval between symp-\ntom-onset and baseline assessment. Fourth, TCD, mea-\nsuring BFV, does not provide absolute quantification of\nCBF. However, MCA BFV indices are strongly related to\ncerebral peripheral resistance, in particular EDV, which\nreliably reflects changes in perfusion,23 PI, which is also a\nmarker of small vessel disease,24 and CVRi, which reflects\nthe relationship between blood pressure and CBF.25\nFifth, our hypothesis was that TCI could be caused\nby transient global flow disturbances in the acute phase\nof TIAs and minor strokes, but we couldn't find any\nglobal hemodynamic change specifically associated to\nTCI. However, our TCD study cannot exclude focal\nhemodynamic abnormalities. Further studies with\nhigh sensitivity MRI could address this issue looking\nat focal perfusion abnormalities. Last, we have not\ninvestigated vascular territories other than the MCA\nlike posterior circulation. Therefore, we cannot exclude\nthat hemodynamic changes in other territories are\nrelated to cognitive changes in the TCI group.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, TCI is detectable with the MoCA after\nTIA and minor stroke and affected patients have similar\nclinical and hemodynamic profiles to those with PMCI.\nHowever, we were not able to demonstrate any exagger-\nated acute reversible changes in global hemodynamic\nindices in the TCI group that might have explained the\ntransient cognitive dysfunction. Nevertheless, it is\nimportant that clinicians are aware of the possibility of\nTCI in patients with TIA and minor stroke, particularly\nin relation to the recall of advice given in the acute phase\nand the capacity to perform complex tasks.\n"
