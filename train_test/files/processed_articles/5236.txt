The study\npopulation, a convenience sample of youth living in the slums, were 14 to 24 years of age, and participants in community-\nbased drop-in centers (N = 313). Overall, the prevalence of physical fights (37%), being threatened or injured with a weapon\n(28%), and being raped (30%) was high and increased with age. Multivariate analyses revealed that sadness, drunkenness, and\nhunger were associated with multiple forms of victimization. Findings suggest that additional services are needed to address\nthe cumulative impact of victimizations, depression, and living conditions.\n",

The methodology and findings from this study have\nbeen reported previously (Swahn, Braunstein, & Kasirye,\nSwahn, Haberlen, Palmier, & Kasirye, 2014; Swahn, Palmier,\nSwahn, Palmier, Kasirye, & Yao, 2012; Swahn, Gressard,\nPalmier, et al., 2012). The youth participants were receiving\nservices in Uganda Youth Development Link (UYDEL)\ndrop-in centers for disadvantaged street youth (UYDEL,\nyouth per month through these drop-in centers. Face-to-face\nsurveys, lasting about 30 min, were administered by social\nworkers/peer educators employed by UYDEL. The study\nwas implemented across eight drop-in centers across\nKampala. Participating youth received snacks and transpor-\ntation for completing the survey. No identifying information\nwas collected, and the surveys were completely anonymous.\nSurveys were administered in English or Luganda, to the\nextent possible, in private settings and rooms, to ensure pri-\nvacy of survey questions and responses. Each social worker/\npeer educator received training on the study methodology,\nand each of the survey questions and its translation into\nLuganda (local language) if needed, and recruited potential\nparticipants among attendants at their specific drop-in center.\nRecruitment took place using word-of-mouth, and each\nattendant was eligible for participation if he or she was\nbetween 14 and 24 years of age. No exclusion criteria were\napplied beyond the age range. Participants were informed\nabout the study and read (or were read) the consent forms to\nindicate their willingness to take the survey. The consent pro-\ncess required that emancipated street youth 14 to 17 years of\nage provide their own consent for participating in the survey\nbecause youth 14 to 17 years of age who \"cater for their own\nlivelihood\" are considered emancipated in Uganda, thereby\nwaiving parental permission. The same consenting process\nwas followed for youth 18 to 24 years of age.\nfor participating in the survey. Among these youth, 46\ndeclined, and 461 agreed to participate, yielding a participa-\ntion rate of 90.9%. Four of the surveys were missing substan-\ntial numbers of responses and were therefore excluded,\nyielding 457 completed surveys for the final analytic sample\nanalyses, based on girls and young women, included 313\nparticipants.\nMeasures\nThe survey questionnaire was modeled from existing sur-\nveys, including the U.S.-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey\nconducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC,2012) and the international Global School\u00adBased\nStudent Health Survey supported by the WHO (WHO, 2015).\nSurvey questions addressed demographic characteristics,\nfamily context, alcohol and drug use, injuries, violence and\nsuicidal behaviors, sexual behaviors, and sexually transmit-\nted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The study protocol was\napproved by the Georgia State University Institutional\nReview Board and also by the Uganda National Council for\nScience and Technology. Funding to conduct the study were\nSwahn et al. 3\nobtained from the Georgia State University Office of\nInternational Initiatives and also from funds leveraged\nthrough collaboration with the Emory Center for Injury\nControl, funded by the CDC.\nThe measures included in the analyses and their preva-\nlence among study participants are described in Table 1.\nDemographic and psychosocial characteristics assessed\nincluded age; living circumstances (whether parents were\nalive); whether the youth had apprenticeship skills; whether\nthey were taking care of themselves at night; whether they\nreported hunger, drunkenness, sadness, loneliness, or\nexpected to die early; and whether they had made a suicide\nattempt. In terms of the violence variables, the survey asked\nwhether they had (a) witnessed family violence, (b) reported\nparental abuse, (c) been involved in physical fights, (d)\nthreatened or injured with a weapon, and (e) been raped.\nThese five variables were dichotomized to indicate the pres-\nence of any or none of each form of violence and then com-\nbined into a summative scale, ranging from 0 to 5 to indicate\nexposures to multiple forms of violence. The cell sizes for\nthe prevalence of exposure to multiple forms of violence\nwere relatively low, and as such, the outcome measure was\nrecoded to reflect three levels of violence: zero, one to two\nforms of violence, and three to five forms of violence.\nFinally, future outlook was assessed using 6 measures asking\nif in the past month they had thought about the following:,\nwhether they felt hopeful about the future, whether they felt\nthey would never have enough money, whether they expected\nto die prior to age 30, that bad things would happen, whether\nthey thought they would be unhappy and whether or not they\nexpected to have a nice family when they were older. Four of\nthe six measures were from the \"Positive Outlook-Individual\nProtective Factors Index\" developed by Phillips and Springer,\n1992 (and psychometric properties reported by Gabriel,\n1994), as presented in a compendium of assessment tools\n(Dahlberg, Toal, Swahn, & Behrens, 2005). Response options\nwere \"never,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"often.\" Measures were\ndichotomized to indicate presence of outlook factor if\nrespondents reported \"often.\"\nAnalyses\nThree sets of analyses are presented in the article. The first\ndescriptive chi-square analyses present the prevalence of\nviolence exposure and test for significant differences for\nthose less than 18 years of age versus those 18 years and\nolder (Table 2). The second analyses present bivariate and\nmultivariate logistic regression analyses to determine the\npsychosocial correlates associated with rape (coded raped\nvs. not raped; Table 3). The multivariate analyses included\nall those variables in the model that were significant in the\nbivariate analyses (e.g., age, hunger, drunkenness, sadness,\nloneliness, and expecting to die early). Finally, the third\ndescriptive chi-square analyses present the prevalence for\neach of the six outlook questions by rape victimization\n(Figure 1). Both SAS 9.2 and SUDAAN 10 statistical\nTable 1.

Bivariate associations between demo-\ngraphic and psychosocial correlates, and multiple violence\nexperiences are presented in Table 3. Self-monitoring at\nnight, hunger, drunkenness, and expecting to die early were\nassociated with reporting three to five forms of violence. In\nmultivariate analyses, hunger and sadness were statistically\nassociated with reporting three to five forms of violence.\nIn bivariate analyses of the factors associated with rape\nspecifically (Table 4), self-monitoring at night, hunger, and\ndrunkenness were statistically associated with rape. In multi-\nvariate analyses, hunger and drunkenness remained statisti-\ncally significantly associated with rape.\nFinally, intests of associations between rape and future\noutlook, four of the six measures were statistically signifi-\ncant. Girls and young women who were raped were more\nlikely to expect not to have enough money, to die early, to be\nunhappy, and to have bad things happen to them.\nDiscussion\nIn this study of girls and young women living in the slums of\nKampala, the findings show that there are substantial reports\nof experiencing multiple forms of violence, which remains\nan issue that is not typically addressed. Violence was also\nreported more frequently among young women than among\nthe girls suggesting that potential strategies for violence pre-\nvention should be implemented earlier in life. We also found\nthat violence was common and that hunger and drunkenness\nemerged as important factors associated with reporting mul-\ntiple forms of violence and specifically also with rape.\nAlthough the context for these violent experiences were not\nassessed, it is clear that the circumstances of these youth liv-\ning in the slums may present a range of situations involving\nconflict and altercation with respect to obtaining resources,\nsuch as money, food, and shelter.These youth also report\nmany adverse childhood experiences with high levels of vio-\nlence within the homes. Moreover, a substantial number are\norphans with one or two deceased parents. Thus, the family\ncontext of these youth is grim and further exacerbated by\nreports of food insufficiency and limited care, nurturing, or\nsupervision, which increases risk of further victimization.\nAmong the girls and young women in our study, drunken-\nness was a significant correlate of reporting multiple forms\nof violence as well as of rape specifically. These findings are\nsimilar to previous research conducted in the United States\nthat underscores the link between a range of alcohol mea-\nsures and involvement in violence, as a perpetrator or victim,\nand also within gang cultures and marginalized youth\n(Brewer & Swahn, 2005; Swahn, Bossarte, West & Topalli,\nuse is an important concern, particularly among vulnerable\nyouth in Kampala, because estimates indicate that Uganda\nhas one of the highest per capita alcohol consumption in the\nworld (WHO, 2004). However, studies of alcohol use spe-\ncifically in violent behaviors in this population or region\nremain scarce.\nGiven the dire context of these youth and in particular of\nthe many girls and young adult women who reported having\nbeen raped, it would be expected that their outlook for the\nfuture would be affected. Extant research suggests that\nsocially disadvantaged youth have lower levels of collective\ncognitive and social resources on which to encourage them\nto have high aspirations or expectations for the future\nOftentimes, economic independence as a goal increases the\ndesirable futures of young people (Foster & Spencer, 2011).\nIn our study, the girls and women who reported being raped\ndiffered from those who were not on four of the six measures\nassessed. Girls and young women who were raped were\nmore likely to expect to not have enough money, to expect to\ndie early, to be unhappy, and to have bad things happen to\nthem. However, they did not differ with respect to being\nhopeful about the future or having a nice family. With respect\nto the measures that were significantly different, expecting to\nbe unhappy in the future is troubling and signals the need for\ninterventions to ameliorate the impact of social disadvantage\non their lives, such as multi-level interventions that seek to\nraise young women's self-esteem, improving their sense of\nsafety, and economic security and social mobility.\nSome limitations restrict the interpretation of the findings\nof this study. First, the study utilized a broad definition of\nyouth living in the slums, including both homeless youth\nHopeful about\nfuture\nNot enough\nmoney\nExpect to die\nearly\nWill be\nunhappy\nBad things\nwill happen\nWill have nice\nfamily\nRape No Rape\nFigure 1.

Second, because the participants in this study\nwere recruited from UYDEL drop-in centers, the study sam-\nple is not a random selection of youth in the slums of\nKampala. Although it is unclear how the sample selection\naffects the results, we speculate that the findings observed in\nthe present study are an underestimate of the true burden of\nviolence and disadvantage in this community. Third, the sur-\nvey instrument used in this study had not been previously\npiloted among Ugandan youth. However, the majority of the\nsurvey items were adopted from previously validated sur-\nveys, including the U.S. Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the\nGlobal School\u00adBased Health Survey. Fourth, the low liter-\nacy level of many of the study participants required that the\nsurvey was read aloud to the participants. The direct face-to-\nface interaction between the interviewer and the participant\nmay have resulted in underreporting of certain risk behaviors\nand experiences because of social desirability. A fifth limita-\ntion is that several study participants provided their responses\nto survey items in their local language of Luganda, thus\nrequiring the interviewers to translate the answers into\nEnglish. Sixth, some of the statistical analyses included rela-\ntively small sample sizes and yielded relatively wide confi-\ndence intervals indicating that findings may be less stable.\nLast, our findings are limited by the cross-sectional nature of\nthis study. A temporal relationship between the psychosocial\nvariables and violence experiences cannot be determined,\nnor can causation be inferred.\nDespite these important limitations, the findings from this\nstudy describe the prevalence and correlates of relatively severe\nforms of violence including rape among these vulnerable girls\nand young women. Hunger, drunkenness, and sadness were\nthe most important factors associated with multiple violence\nexperiences. In addition, hunger and drunkenness were also\nspecifically associated with rape. More troubling perhaps is\nthat being victimized by rape also shapes the future outlook\nwith respect to expecting future unhappiness, death, and bad\nthings compared with those not raped. Because of the scar-\ncity of data related to violence experiences, and in particular\nsexual victimization among girls and young women in sub-\nSaharan Africa, additional research is needed to validate\nthese findings. Future research should also assess the extent\nto which trading sex for necessary food and shelter is a key\nconcern among vulnerable girls and women, not only in sub-\nSaharan Africa (Ntozi, Mulindwa, Ahimbisibwe, Ayiga, &\nand its potential role in increasing risk for violent victimiza-\ntion. Efforts should also be made to determine modifiable\nfactors that can be incorporated into prevention programs\nthat may reduce, at least partially, the consequences of the\nadverse childhood experiences and violence victimizations\nexperienced by these girls and young women.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: Funding to conduct\nthe study were obtained from the Georgia State University Office of\nInternational Initiatives and also from funds leveraged through col-\nlaboration with the Emory Center for Injury Control, funded by the\nTable 4.
