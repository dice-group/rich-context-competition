This phenomenon may be influ-\nenced by the escalating global epidemic of overweight and\nobesity, which affect both children and adults (World Health\nOrganization, 2013), and society's obsession with a thin\nbody image (Dittmar, 2007). Children's attitudes toward\nbody size have been the object of several studies, most of\nwhich have focused on overweight figures and a few of\nwhich have considered thin figures. A robust body of evi-\ndence has shown that children display negative attitudes\ntoward obesity (e.g., Brylinsky & Moore, 1994; Cramer &\nfindings concerning attitudes toward thinness are inconclu-\nsive. Some research has found that children hold negative\nattitudes toward thin targets, who are generally seen as being\nsocially submissive (Staffieri, 1967). Other studies have\nemphasized mixed attitudes characterized by ascriptions of\nsocially desirable traits and negative physical features\n(Brylinsky & Moore, 1994). More recent studies have shown\nthat thin figures are perceived as positively as average-\nweight figures (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998; Musher-\nEizenman, Holub, Barnhart Miller, Goldstein, &\nEdwards-Leeper, 2004). Although research has shown that\nchildren's attitudes toward fatness have worsened over the\nthat children's attitudes toward thinness may have become\nmore positive (Thelen, Powell, Lawrence, & Kuhnert, 1992).\nThe recent increase in the prevalence of eating disorders\nin Western societies emphasizes a paradox: Whereas the\npopulation is generally heavier, the mass media disseminate\nan image of unrealistic thinness and simultaneously convey\nstigmatized images of overweight individuals (Solbes &\nappear to affect body image by late elementary school, and\nthe internalization of the societal standards of thinness is\nconsidered to be a risk factor for body image disturbance and\neating pathology (Thompson & Stice, 2001). Relatedly,\noverweight children who perceive weight-based discrimina-\ntion are more likely to engage in binge-eating and unhealthy\nweight-related behaviors compared with average-weight\npeers (Puhl & Heuer, 2010). Therefore, both belief types\nmay increase social pressure on children, thus affecting their\nsocial interactions and self-perceptions and leading to more\neating disorders. Thus, investigating children's body size\nattitudes appears particularly relevant. The present study\nexamines attitudes toward thin, average-weight, and over-\nweight figures among 6- to 11-year-old children.\nOverall positive and negative attitudes toward specific\nbody types may obscure more notable nuances if the content\nof such beliefs is not considered.

According to\nFiske (2012), \"evolution argues for the utility of [a] rapid\ncategory-based social judgment. People have to know whom\nto approach or avoid and for what purposes\" (p. 34). Warmth\nand competence appear to be the two most crucial and adap-\ntive aspects relevant to survival because warmth (e.g., friend-\nliness, sincerity, trustworthiness, and sociability) reveals\ngood or bad intentions, and competence (e.g., intelligence,\nskill, creativity, and efficacy) reveals the ability to act on\nthose intentions.\nMore subtle and modern forms of prejudice are character-\nized by mixed combinations of these two basic dimensions;\nthat is, groups are described as either competent or warm but\nnot both (see Cuddy, Fiske, & Glick, 2008, for a review).\nPertinently, recent research has shown mixed ascriptions of\nwarmth and competence toward obese adults; that is, heavy\nindividuals were rated as more warm than competent relative\nto lean individuals (Vartanian & Silverstein, 2013). However,\nto the best of our knowledge, research has not yet systemati-\ncally investigated these dimensions on children's stereo-\ntypes. Therefore, the present study also explores children's\nwarmth and competence stereotypes concerning body weight\nto qualify the valence of these attitudes.\nChildren's Body Size Attitudes\nOverweight children suffer from severe stigmatization.\nThese children are perceived as mean and undesirable play-\nmates (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998) who possess more nega-\ntive personality and behavioral traits (Sigelman, Miller, &\nWhitworth, 1986) and are less likely to be associated with\npositive abilities than average-weight children (Penny &\nHaddock, 2007a). Interestingly, these negative attitudes\nappear to be shared by children who are overweight them-\n1967). As a result, overweight children suffer from peer\nrejection (Harper, Wacker, & Cobb, 1986; Strauss, Smith,\nFrame, & Forehand, 1985), victimization (Adams &\nBukowski, 2008), academic underachievement (Crosnoe &\nmore frequently than average-weight children.\nStudies have shown that children's anti-fat attitudes vary\nwith age (e.g., Brylinsky & Moore, 1994; Cramer &\nobserved by researchers are consistent with those suggested\nregarding the development of children's ethnic prejudice. At\nthe pre-school level, children focus on the external attributes\nof individuals and make global, gross distinctions based on\nfamiliar versus unfamiliar characteristics. These \"like me\"\nand \"not like me\" categories (Sigelman et al., 1986) peak at\napproximately 5 to 8 years old and lead to a clear-cut prefer-\nence for the ingroup over the outgroup. At approximately 8\nto 9 years old, children increasingly perceive intra-group\ndifferences and inter-group similarities, which allow them\nto consider other people's perspectives, thus attenuating\ntheir ingroup preference and outgroup dislike. However,\nmany scholars have argued that this decline may simply\ninvolve a social desirability concern; that is, older children\nmay be more aware of what is socially unacceptable and\nmay thus be less overtly biased (e.g., Brown, 2010; Rutland,\nConsistent with Aboud's theory, children between 5 and 8\nyears old are generally more biased toward overweight peers\n2007b). This result is most likely because older children have\nmore developed reasoning skills. However, it is not obvious\nwhether such reasoning skills help older children appreciate\noverweight peers' perspectives or help them become more\naware of how they are perceived by others and by under-\nstanding that discrimination is wrong, are less likely to be\nopenly biased. A recent meta-analysis (Raabe & Beelmann,\n2011) integrating 90 years of research on ethnic, racial, and\nnational prejudices has shown that the increase in prejudice\nbetween early and middle childhood (2-7 years old) can be\nregarded as a typical developmental change \"because it is a\npersistent finding that was obtained independently of contact\nopportunities, and the divergent operationalizations of preju-\ndice . . ., across a large pool of studies from different social\ncontexts\" (p. 1729). By contrast, the decrease that occurs\nbetween middle and late childhood (7-10 years old) is\naffected by the measurements used in the studies. More spe-\ncifically, Raabe and Beelmann (2011) observed an age-\nrelated change on explicit but not implicit attitudes. This\nresult appears consistent for anti-fat attitudes. Solbes and\nEnesco (2010) investigated such attitudes at the explicit and\nimplicit levels in 6- to 11-year-old children. The results\nshowed that as children age, they appear to reduce their lev-\nels of explicit prejudice but not implicit bias.\nSome results have also suggested that anti-fat attitudes are\ngender-related. Although some studies have observed no\ngender differences (e.g., Brylinsky & Moore, 1994; Solbes &\nthat overweight females are more stigmatized than their male\nsome evidence indicates that girls show stronger anti-fat atti-\ntudes than boys (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998; Sigelman et al.,\nproximity effect (i.e., average-weight individuals are deni-\ngrated when placed next to overweight individuals rather\nthan average-weight individuals; Hebl &Mannix, 2003) in\n5- to 10-year-old children. Such an effect occurred in\nDurante et al. 3\nchildren as young as 5 years old and was likely to occur\nwhen evaluations were made on female targets.\nAccording to Smolak (2004), \"body image is a strongly\ngendered phenomenon\" (p. 21). In her review of the litera-\nture, Smolak noted that the incidence of body dissatisfaction\nis similar in male and female adolescents, but not in children\nyounger than approximately 11 years old (see also Tang-\nP\u00e9ronard & Heitmann, 2008). Young boys appear to be less\nconcerned about their bodies compared with their female\ncounterparts. For example, Pine (2001) found that the ideal\nfemale figure selected by girls (5- to 11-year-olds) was sig-\nnificantly thinner compared with the ideal male figure cho-\nsen by boys. Furthermore, when asked to select the figure\nthey aspired to be as an adult, girls expressed higher prefer-\nences for the thinner figure. Young girls appear to be under a\ngreater pressure to achieve a particular body type, particu-\nlarly in contemporary Western societies. Building on the\nobjectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997),\nSmolak argued that\nwhile the male body is viewed as agentic and active, the female\nbody is an object to be looked at, particularly by men. The\nfunction of women's bodies, then, is to be attractive, to be\nsexually pleasing to men. Girls learn this lesson early with\nmessages coming from media, peers, and parents [which are\nmore consistently directed toward girls than boys] (p. 22).\nConsidering the above evidence, the present study\nexplores 6- to 11-year-old children's attitudes toward thin,\naverage-weight, and overweight figures with the following\naims: to replicate previous results concerning obesity,\nnamely, a stronger anti-fat bias in younger children com-\npared with older children; to shed new light on attitudes\ntoward thinness; and to deepen the role of gender in both\ntypes of attitudes. In addition, we investigated social desir-\nability concerns to account for the predicted decline of anti-\nfat attitudes in older children (i.e., fifth grade).\nStereotype Content\nAccording to Penny and Haddock (2007a), extensive\nresearch has been carried out to establish the content of obe-\nsity stereotypes held by adults, whereas much less attention\nhas been devoted to children's stereotypes of overweight\nchildren. Furthermore, no research has systematically inves-\ntigated children's stereotype content regarding thin, average-\nweight, and overweight figures in terms of warmth and\ncompetence, which are considered to be the fundamental\ndimensions of social judgment (see Abele, Cuddy, Judd, &\nYzerbyt, 2008). These dimensions are often observed in\nambivalent combinations; that is, groups are perceived as\nwarm or competent but not both (Fiske et al., 2007; Fiske,\nCuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002). These ambivalent combinations\nare consistent with the compensation hypothesis (Judd,\nJames-Hawkins, Yzerbyt, & Kashima, 2005) that states that\na compensatory process occurs when one is judged more\npositively on one dimension (either warmth or competence)\nthan on the other. Thus, people attempt to \"rectify this dispar-\nity [on one dimension] by asserting that the situation must be\nreversed on the other dimension of social judgment\" (Judd et\ntence are led by a compensatory motive that operates when\nthe judgments of individuals or groups are generated in a\ncomparative context (see Kervyn, Yzerbyt, & Judd, 2010 for\na review). Ambivalent combinations of warmth and compe-\ntence are pervasive in social judgments because they are\nfunctional and depict individuals or groups as possessing\ncounterbalanced good and bad qualities to maintain a sense\nStudies have shown that overweight children are believed\nto be less intelligent, lazier, and less academically successful\ncompared with their average-weight peers (e.g., Cramer &\n2000). By contrast, thin children are perceived as kinder,\ncleverer, and friendlier than overweight children (e.g.,\nAltogether, the existing research appears to indicate that\nwarmth and competence may underlie children's stereotypes.\nHowever, little is known about how these two dimensions\nare combined with reference to specific body types.\nAs noted, a recent contribution has shown that overweight\nadults were rated as more warm than competent relative to\nlean adults (Vartanian & Silverstein, 2013). In a related\nresearch domain, Barg, Armstrong, Hetz, and Latimer (2010)\ninvestigated the stigma that able-bodied adults have toward\nchildren with a physical disability in terms of warmth and\ncompetence. People with disabilities are perceived cross-\nculturally as more warm than competent (Cuddy et al., 2009;\nDurante et al., 2013). Pity, sympathy, and disrespect are gen-\nerally directed toward individuals stereotyped in such a man-\nthat \"stigma and the consequent reactions towards those with\na disability may be explained by the qualitative differences\nin perceived warmth and perceived competence in the con-\ntent of stereotypes held by society at large\" (p. 372).\nConsequently, and according to the stereotype content mod-\nel's predictions (cf. Fiske et al., 2002), improving perceived\ncompetence may reduce the stigma that is directed toward\nindividuals with disabilities. The results showed that by\nboosting perceptions of competence of a child with physical\ndisabilities (i.e., portraying him or her as being active), he or\nshe was rated as more competent than an able-bodied child.\nTherefore, are children's anti-fat attitudes just negative\n(as the literature appears to suggest) or are negative evalua-\ntions on one dimension compensated by positive evaluations\non the other dimension? Because \"not all stereotypes are\nalike\" (Fiske et al., 2002), we aim to broaden previous\nresearch on children's body size attitudes by considering the\nrelated stereotype content in terms of warmth and\n4 SAGE Open\ncompetence and establishing the combination of these\ndimensions for each body type. Based on the research of\nBarg et al. (2010), identifying different warmth and compe-\ntence combinations might help when designing appropriate\nintervention programs to reduce weight bias.\nMethod\nParticipants\nwere recruited from elementary schools in Northern Italy.\nLetters describing the study and asking for consent were sent\nto the parents/guardians of all children. Only those children\nwhose parents/guardians returned the signed consent form to\nthe school participated in the study. The participants were\ntaken from alternate school years (first, third, and fifth grade)\nto comprise three age groups: 50 participants (24 males and\n26 females) between 6 and 7 years old (M\nage\nparticipants (30 males and 25 females) between 8 and 9 years\nold (M\nage\nage\nMaterials\nSix cartoons were created using graphic computer software\nand were pasted onto 16.5 \u00d7 24 cm white cardboard squares.\nEach cartoon represented a male or female thin, average-\nweight, or overweight child. Computer software allowed us\nto manipulate body weight changes while maintaining the\nstability of the other elements. The characters for each gen-\nder were identical except for body size: thin (3.9 cm wide),\naverage-weight (5.4 cm wide), and overweight (9.2 cm\nwide). Measurements were taken at the widest part of the\nbody. The children made their evaluations (except for the\nSocial Desirability Scale; see below) using a 5-point scale.\nEach point of the scale was labeled appropriately (i.e., 1 =\nnot at all, 2 = a little, 3 = don't know, 4 = a lot, 5 = very\nmuch) and included smiley faces graded from the most seri-\nous to the happiest. Both the cards and scale were pilot tested\nusing a convenience sample of 18 children (8 males and 10\nfemales) from 6 to 11 years old. The children were asked to\norder the cards from \"the thinnest to the chubbiest\" (or vice\nversa) to ensure that our stimuli conveyed different body\nweights. Furthermore, the children completed several prac-\ntice questions (e.g., \"How much do you like doing your\nhomework?\" \"How much do you like ice cream?\") to ensure\nthat all children understood how to use the scale. Both the\nfigures and scale were appropriate for the children's age\ngroups and aims of the present study.\nProcedure and Measures\nThe participants were interviewed individually during the\nschool day. A trained male experimenter conducted all\ntesting. After a brief period of social interaction, the children\nwere familiarized with the scale through a few practice ques-\ntions (as in the pilot study), and the experimenter ensured\nthat they understood how to use it. The experimenter then\nrandomly presented the six figures one at a time giving the\nchildren the ability to rate each figure the same way.\nAttitude toward body size.For each figure, the participants\nwere asked the following three questions: \"How much do\nyou like this boy/girl?\" \"How much would you like to have\nhim/her as a friend?\" and \"How much would you like to have\nhim/her as a desk partner?\" The reliability for each target\nfigure within each age group was satisfactory (alphas\nStereotype content.Next, the participants were again pre-\nsented with the target figures one at a time in random order\nand were asked to evaluate each figure for competence and\nwarmth. Two items were used for each dimension: \"How\nmuch do you think this boy/girl is intelligent/good at school?\"\n(i.e., competence) and \"How much do you think this boy/girl\nis kind/amusing?\" (i.e., warmth). The warmth and compe-\ntence reliabilities calculated for each target figure within\neach age group were generally sufficient (competence\nFinally, the children were asked to order the figures from\n\"the thinnest to the chubbiest\" (or vice versa) to ensure that\nthey were able to discriminate between different body sizes.1\nNone of the participants failed this task.\nSocial desirability.At the end of the session, only the fifth-\ngrade children were presented with a true\u00adfalse, 12-item\nresponse format questionnaire to measure social desirability.\nWe used a short form (Short-Form B) of the Crandall Social\nDesirability Test for Children (CSDTC; V. C. Crandall,\nCrandall, & Katkovsky, 1965) implemented by Carifio\n(1994). The items were translated and adjusted for the Italian\ncontext. Examples include the following: \"I would never hit\nanyone who was smaller than I am\" and \"Sometimes I feel\nlike staying home from school even if I'm not sick.\" The reli-\nability was sufficient ( = .65). The participants' responses\nwere coded and aggregated to form a reliable social desir-\nability index (ranging from 0 to 12) with higher scores indi-\ncating higher social desirability concerns.\nResults\nAttitude Toward Body Size\nThe items were averaged to form reliable scores for each tar-\nget figure.

However, social desirability did not\npredict such a decline in fifth-grade children ( = .20, p =\nStereotype Content\nWarmth and competence items were averaged to form reli-\nable scores. To explore the existence of ambivalent stereo-\ntype content in children, a 3 (Age Group) \u00d7 3 (Target Weight)\n\u00d7 2 (Dimension) mixed ANOVA was performed with the last\ntwo factors serving as within-participants factors.3 We were\nespecially interested in the warmth and competence combi-\nnation for each body size and in their variations, if any,\naccording to children's age. The results showed a significant\na significant Target Weight \u00d7 Dimension interaction, F(2,\nwarmth and competence ratings differed significantly for\nthat thin targets were judged as more competent than warm,\nwhereas overweight targets were judged as more warm than\ncompetent. Notably, average-weight targets were rated as\nboth competent and warm, F< 1. Furthermore, the simple\neffects associated with the two dimensions showed that over-\nweight figures were evaluated as the least competent, F(2,\n2 = .23. The other comparisons for each dimension were not\nsignificant.\nThe relevant three-way Age Group \u00d7 Target Weight \u00d7\np = .22. However, it is possible that different directions in the\nwarmth and competence evaluations for each target weight\nin each age group could have canceled each other out, thus\nleading to a non-significant three-way interaction. Therefore,\nwe further investigated the possibility of compensation in\ndifferent dimensions at different ages by comparing the\nwarmth and competence means for each body size within\neach age group. The results for the first-grade children\nshowed that thin targets were perceived as more competent\nwere non-significant (ts < 1.25, ps > .20).

Finally, the means for warmth all differed sig-\ntargets receiving the highest evaluations. Only average-\nweight and overweight targets differed in the competence\nDiscussion\nThe results showed that children of all ages differentiated\namong the three body sizes. Children held the most positive\nattitude toward average-weight targets and the most negative\nattitude toward overweight targets. Attitudes toward thin tar-\ngets appeared to be more positive than those toward over-\nweight figures but not as positive as attitudes toward\naverage-weight targets. Both the preference for average-\nweight and the dislike for overweight children decreased\nfrom first- to fifth-grade children. However, social desirabil-\nity concerns appear to be involved in the decline of the anti-\nfat attitude, at least among fifth-grade children. Finally,\nconsistent with Brylinsky and Moore's (1994) findings, atti-\ntudes toward thin targets did not vary according to children's\nage.\nConcerning gender, we found that children favored their\nown gender, as reported in previous studies (e.g., Penny &\nweight and overweight female targets, in particular, were\nevaluated less favorably than their male counterparts.\nNotably, although female participants preferred figures of\ntheir own gender, this ingroup bias was less prominent in\ntheir evaluations of the overweight female target. This result\nappears in line with previous findings showing stronger anti-\nfat attitudes in girls than boys (e.g., Cramer & Steinwert,\npreference for thin figures among girls compared with boys.\nIn summary, there were neither gender nor age differences\nfor the thin targets, but we found age differences for both\naverage-weight and overweight targets as well as indications\nof stronger anti-fat attitudes toward female overweight tar-\ngets. These results are not only consistent with previous\nresearch but also extend it in several respects. First, we\nassessed attitudes toward thinness as well as fatness. The\nmajority of previous studies considered only two body types:\neither thin or average-weight and overweight. The present\nstudy assessed children's attitudes toward three body types\nand found that average-weight is the most liked body size,\nbut thinness is always preferred over fatness. Furthermore,\nwe did not adopt a forced-choice paradigm, but the children\nhad the option to rate each figure in the identical manner.\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the biases observed here are\nmerely the effects of the methodology used. Second, we shed\nnew light on the role of gender in the anti-fat prejudice, thus\nshowing that although children preferred targets of their own\ngender, the female overweight target was more stigmatized\nand did not benefit from the gender ingroup bias as much as\nits male counterpart.\nThird, our results demonstrated that social desirability\nconcerns play a role in the decline of anti-fat attitudes among\nolder children. Similar to recent arguments for racial, ethnic,\nand national prejudices (see Raabe & Beelmann, 2011), this\nresult supports the idea that as age increases, children become\nmore aware of what is socially desirable and modulate their\nresponses to appear more positive and less biased. Our find-\nings are also consistent with Solbes and Enesco's (2010)\nresults on implicit versus explicit weight bias. However,\nsocial desirability did not account for the diminished prefer-\nence toward average weight found among older children,\nlending support to cognitive theories (e.g., Aboud, 1988).\nThe aforementioned results have established the positiv-\nity/negativity of children's body size attitudes. However,\nresults concerning stereotype content showed that such atti-\ntudes are more sophisticated than simply liking or disliking\nspecific body types. In fact, although children perceived\noverweight targets as the least competent, they appeared to\ncompensate in the warmth dimension, attributing higher\nwarmth than competence to these targets. Similarly, thin fig-\nures were judged as more competent than warm, whereas\naverage-weight targets were judged as both competent and\nwarm. These compensation versus halo effects (see\nRosenberg, Nelson, & Vivekananthan, 1968) are in line with\nwhat was argued by Fiske et al. (2002). According to these\nauthors, the majority of groups' stereotypes are ambivalent,\nbut reference groups and ingroups are generally perceived as\npossessing both warmth and competence. In the present\nresearch, and consistent with the findings of previous studies\non the anti-fat prejudice, average-weight targets represent\nthe favorite body type. The majority of children identified\nwith the average-weight figures (i.e., ingroup; see Note 1).\nTherefore, it is not surprising to find a univalent (only posi-\ntive) stereotype toward average-weight figures.\nOur results concerning the more-warm-than-competent\noverweight stereotype are in line with the findings of Penny\nand Haddock (2007a) who investigated the same stereotype\nin terms of athletic, artistic, academic, and social abilities.\nThe last two domains may be considered equivalent to com-\npetence and warmth, respectively. Although these authors\nused a different methodology, they found that compared with\nTable 6.

Children's attributions of warmth and competence\nto thin, average-weight, and overweight targets mirrored\nthose of adults (both in the present research and in Vartanian\n& Silverstein, 2013), and the evidence of an age trend sug-\ngests that by the end of elementary school, children seem to\nmanage the two fundamental dimensions of social judgment\nas adults do.\nImplications\nThe present study has important theoretical and practical\nimplications. First, our findings concerning the relationship\nbetween the decline of anti-fat attitudes and social desirabil-\nity concerns in fifth graders are consistent with previous\nresults, indicating that strong negative biases toward over-\nweight peers persist during pre-adolescence (e.g., Enesco,\nGuerrero, Callejas, & Solbes, 2010). Furthermore, over-\nweight and obese individuals experience prejudice and dis-\ncrimination in every area of their lives, and according to\nJohnston (2012), \"Weight-based discrimination is on the rise\nand remains a socially acceptable form of discrimination\" (p.\nAll these results emphasize the need for age-appropriate\ninterventions promoting prejudice reduction at overt and\nsubtler levels. Raabe and Beelmann (2011) noted that the\ntransition from middle to late childhood (7-10 years old) is a\nsensitive period for environmental influences on prejudice.\nThese authors suggested contact-based interventions together\nwith a stronger and more direct communication of anti-prej-\nudice and egalitarian norms as strategies to reduce ethnic\nprejudice. We believe that such strategies could also be effec-\ntive to address negative weight-based attitudes in children.\nFor example, Hansson and Rasmussen (2010) also found that\none of the predictors of the obesity stereotype in 10-year-old\nchildren was parental body size; that is, children showed\nstronger obesity stereotypes with decreasing parental body\nsize. Relying on the contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954) which\nstates that frequent interactions with outgroup members may\nimprove negative attitudes, both toward the outgroup mem-\nber that one interacts with and toward the entire outgroup,\nthe authors argued that a possible explanation for their result\n\"is that children with larger parents realize that body size has\nlittle or nothing to do with certain behaviours or characteris-\ntics, and are therefore less disposed to stereotype\" (Hansson\nSecond, the more-warm-than-competent overweight ste-\nreotype observed in the present study provides us with some\nindications of which stereotypical dimension we should\nfocus on when designing an intervention. The study by Barg\net al. (2010) on the stigma toward children with physical dis-\nabilities (also stereotyped as more warm than competent) has\nshown that improving perceived competence may reduce the\nstigma directed toward such individuals. Therefore, contact-\nbased, competence-oriented early interventions are essential,\nespecially considering the recent results that show that the\nwarmth and competence stereotypes may constrain and\ndirect outgroups'behavior interpretations (Richetin, Durante,\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThe present study has some limitations that should be\naddressed in future studies. First, the social desirability mea-\nsure was only administered to 5th-grade children. The\nCSDTC (V. C. Crandall et al., 1965) was tested with 3rd to\n12th graders, but the short form used here was validated by\nit was not appropriate to administer the test to younger chil-\ndren. Because in our results 3rd- and 5th-grade children did\nnot differ in their evaluations of the overweight targets, to\ndeepen the role that social desirability plays in children's\nanti-fat attitude at different ages, future research should con-\nsider and develop other instruments to investigate the devel-\nopmental pattern of such a construct. Similarly, the decline in\nthe average-weight preference should be further investigated.\nIn fact, it is plausible to assume that as children become more\naware of social norms (e.g., modesty), ingroup preference\nmight consequently decrease.\nSecond, although consistent with previous results\n(Brylinsky & Moore, 1994), we did not observe a preference\nfor thin targets in either boys or girls, which is inconsistent\nwith what has been observed in the body image and dissatis-\nfaction literature. This inconsistency may be because the\nincidence of body dissatisfaction is not obvious in children\nHeitmann, 2008). However, because previous studies have\nshown that young children display an awareness of dieting\nmessages (e.g., Holub et al., 2005) and cultural standards for\nbeauty prior to puberty (e.g., Smolak, 2004), it is plausible to\nassume that little girls in particular may not be immune to\nthese influences. Harriger, Calogero, Witherington, and\nSmith (2010) noted that researchers \"have documented that\nthe current ideal body type for women is not only thin, but a\n`curvaceously thin' body shape\"; therefore, it \"is not simply\na matter of attaining a low body weight but also having the\nnecessary fat distribution in certain areas (e.g., breasts, but-\ntocks) to achieve the desired body proportions\" (p. 610).\nSimilarly, the ideal male body type has muscles (see Kelley,\nNeufeld, & Musher-Eizenman, 2010). The stimuli used in\nthe current research portrayed children; therefore, there were\nno curves on the girls and no muscles on the boys.\nConsequently, expressing a preference for average-weight\nfigures does not clarify the ideal body type that children\nDurante et al. 9\nmight want to achieve as adults, which could affect their eat-\ning behaviors more than their attitudes toward thin peers.\nSpecifically designed studies are necessary to address this\nproblem.\nRelative to the stimuli, the difference in width between the\nthree body weights may be considered a further limitation. In\nfact, thin and average figures differed by 1.5 cm, whereas the\ndifference between the average- and overweight figures was\nmore than 3 cm. However, in the pilot study, 6- to 11-year-old\nchildren were able to order the cards from \"the thinnest to the\nchubbiest\" (or vice versa), and in the main study, the partici-\npants preferred average-size figures to both thin and over-\nweight figures. These results indicated that children were able\nto categorize the figures according to their weight. However,\nmore constant and systematic changes in body weight should\nbe used in building stimuli for future studies.\nFourth, we did not measure the participants' height and\nweight. However, the research suggests that anti-fat attitudes\nappear to be shared by children and adults who are over-\nweight themselves (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998; Holub,\n2008), and perceived body size seems to be a better predictor\nof such attitudes (Solbes & Enesco, 2010). Note 1 indicates\nthat we controlled for perceived body size by asking the chil-\ndren to select the child that they looked most similar to from\nthe six figures. The results showed that the majority of chil-\ndren of all ages chose the average-weight figure. Future\nresearch should address both issues more carefully with a\nlarger and more heterogeneous sample.\nFinally, concerning the stereotype content, to our knowl-\nedge, this is the first study showing that ambivalent combi-\nnations of warmth and competence characterize children's\nstereotype content. Although there is no reason to expect that\nthese findings should operate differently in other social cat-\negories or nations, future research should extend these results\nby considering other types of targets (e.g., ethnic, gender\ngroups) in other countries. Furthermore, future studies\nshould experimentally establish compensation processes in\nchildren, such as by using stories of fictitious individuals and\nmanipulating one dimension at a time to determine how the\nattributions on the other dimension change as a consequence.\nThis could be done with children of different ages to verify\nthe age pattern observed here.\nConclusion\nPrevious research exploring children's anti-fat biases has\nmostly focused on the valence of the attitude. The results of\nthe current study show that although children hold a negative\nattitude toward their overweight peers, the associated stereo-\ntype content is ambivalent, and positive and negative beliefs\nco-exist. Especially in children around 10 years of age, the\nfact that overweight targets are penalized in one dimension\n(i.e., competence) but are compensated in the other (i.e.,\nwarmth), in addition to the results concerning social desir-\nability, highlights children's ability as social perceivers.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. Children's body size perceptions were also assessed as a\nsupplementary control measure. The children were asked to\nchoose which child they most looked like from the six figures.\nThe results showed that the participants always chose a same-\ngender figure, typically the average-weight figure; namely,\nmale participants: first grade 79.2%, third grade 83.3%, and\nfifth grade 76%; female participants: first grade, 80.8%, third\n2. All tests of simple effects used the Bonferroni correction for\nmultiple comparisons.\n3. For simplicity, the participants' and targets' genders were not\nentered in the ANOVA reported in the text because the initial\nanalyses showed no relevant effects on the warmth and com-\npetence dimensions.\n4. The traits have been extensively and cross-culturally pre-tested\nGlick, & Xu, 2002) to reflect the dimensions of warmth and\ncompetence.\nReferences\nAbele, A. E., Cuddy, A. J. C., Judd, C.
