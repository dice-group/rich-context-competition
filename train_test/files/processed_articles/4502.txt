    "abstract": "Abstract\nAttitudes towards social groups that have traditionally been marginalised or discrimi-\nnated against have changed markedly in Britain over the past three decades. This change\nis particularly marked in attitudes towards homosexuality and racial diversity which, as\npublic opinion surveys have regularly shown, have become more accepting over time.\nThis change is often attributed to older, less tolerant generations being replaced by\nyoung cohorts who are more inclusive and open minded in their attitudes to cultural\nothers. The paper explores this argument by examining trends in people's attitudes\ntowards a variety of minorities, including the said groups, but also immigrants and\nforeign workers. It starts with a discussion of several perspectives predicting different\ntrends with regards to these attitudes. A distinction is made between optimistic ones\n(i.e. those anticipating rising levels of tolerance) and pessimistic ones (i.e. those expect-\ning stable or declining levels of tolerance). Subsequently, the paper presents trend\nanalyses and an analysis of age, cohort and period effects to broadly assess the explana-\ntory power of these perspectives. Using these approaches, we find that tolerance\ntowards racial minorities and homosexuality has indeed risen across the board, and\nthat young people are also more accepting of these groups than their parents or grand-\nparents and previous generations of young people. These trends broadly support the\noptimistic perspectives. However, we also find that prejudice has not disappeared from\nyouth attitudes altogether; for a sizeable minority of youth, it has merely shifted its\nfocus to immigration. Not only have unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants\ngenerally become stronger, young people are not always the most tolerant age group\nregarding this social group. These findings are thus more in line with the expectations of\nthe pessimistic perspectives.\n",

Trends in\ntolerance among young\npeople in Britain\nJan G Janmaat and Avril Keating\nUCL Institute of Education, UK\n Keywords\nTolerance, immigrants, trends, young people, age groups\nEthnicities\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/etn\nCorresponding author:\nJan G Janmaat, University College London Institute of Education, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, UK.\nEmail: g.janmaat@ucl.ac.uk\nIntroduction\nOver the past two decades there has been a marked shift in attitudes towards many\nsocial groups that have historically been marginalised and/or vilified in British\nsociety. People have become more accepting of homosexuality and interracial mar-\nriage, for instance. These changes have coincided with globalisation and open-\nborders policies that have made West European societies more diverse, ethnically\nand religiously. Britain, in particular, has experienced a sharp increase in the\nnumber of immigrants, coupled with a gradual rise in the size of the British-\nborn, ethnic minority population (Storm et al., 2017). There has been much\ndebate, discussion and consternation in Britain about these social changes \u00ad par-\nticularly in relation to cultural diversity, immigration \u00ad and their implications.\nContemporary youth are often considered to be more tolerant, open minded and\ninclusive because they grew up under these conditions. Yet, they have also suffered\nmore from the last economic crisis and are likely to face more competition from\nimmigrants than are older people. These last-named conditions are said to make\npeople less tolerant, based on the argument (discussed below) that scarcity of\nresources fuels hostility towards out-groups.\nIn this article, therefore, we seek to address three questions: What are young\npeople's attitudes towards cultural others? Is the current generation of\nyoung people more tolerant than their elders and/or previous generations\nof young people? And how can the patterns and trends on these attitudes be\nexplained? To address these questions, we will draw on the data of two surveys\n(World Values Survey and British Social Attitudes) and present trend and regres-\nsion analysis of attitudinal change in Britain over three decades. To the best of our\nknowledge, academic studies looking at trends in attitudes towards various social\ngroups and comparing young people to both older people and to previous gener-\nations of young people are non-existent. That trends can differ quite dramatically\nacross various indicators of (in)tolerance, and that there is thus every reason to\ninvestigate this in depth, becomes evident when we compare different studies. While\nFord (2008) found racial intolerance to have declined in Britain in the 1980s and\nimmigrants to at first decline and then to rise during the same period in the\nNetherlands.\nWhat our findings will show is that, on the whole, young people are indeed more\naccepting of homosexuality and of racial diversity than their parents or grandpar-\nents and previous generations of young people. However, we shall also see that\nintolerance has not disappeared from youth attitudes altogether; for a sizeable\nminority of youth, it has merely shifted its focus to immigration. Contemporary\nyouth are markedly less welcoming of immigrants than young people 10 or 20 years\nago. Given that immigration has been the most important political issue for the\nBritish electorate since May 2015 (Ipsos Mori, 2016a) and trumped the economy as\nthe key concern motivating the vote in the EU Referendum in June 2016 (Ipsos\nMori, 2016b), it is hard to exaggerate the relevance of these findings.\nIn the section following the next, we will discuss various theoretical perspectives\noffering different explanations and expectations regarding trends and generational\ndifferences in tolerance. We then present two empirical sections with analyses of\nsurvey data on the trends and drivers of tolerance. These sections serve to broadly\ntest the predictions of the theoretical perspectives. The conclusion highlights our\nmain finding that the target of intolerance has shifted and explains what the main\ncontribution of this paper is to the existing literature.\nA brief note on terminology\nIn this article, we understand the concept of tolerance in a broad sense; that is, as\ndenoting acceptance of, and favourable and inclusive attitudes towards, various\nminority groups that are often marginalised and/or discriminated against by the\nmajority. This means we consider its antonyms to be hostility, prejudice and exclu-\nsionism (see also Dejaeghere et al., 2012). We are aware that this goes beyond its\noriginal meaning, which revolves around the idea of enduring and respecting some-\nthing one dislikes. As Vogt (1997: 3) put it: `Tolerance is intentional self-restraint in\nthe face of something one dislikes, objects to, finds threatening, or otherwise has a\nnegative attitude towards'. We understand the term in a much wider sense, i.e. as\nalso referring to attitudes towards cultural others that do not necessarily include\nthis element of dislike, such as positive opinions about cultural others and a will-\ningness to accept them as equals. We further acknowledge that the attitudes we\nhold it to embrace are not equally demanding in relation to implications for the\ntreatment of cultural others. Believing that others are fundamentally equal to one's\nown group and therefore deserving of the same rights (i.e. inclusive attitudes), or\nsupporting an unrestrained endorsement of these others obviously require more\naccommodating policies towards these groups than a `resigned acceptance for the\nfiner distinctions are glossed over in the more colloquial use of the term, however.\nIn the media and in everyday conversations, the term is often used as a catch-all\nphrase referring to all kinds of positive attitudes towards various minorities. We\nadopt the term in this idiomatic sense because we need an accessible term to denote\na wide set of attitudes often seen to be interrelated.\nIn view of the sensitivity of the topic under investigation, we take extra care in\nthe terms we use to refer to the object of tolerance; that is, the group which people\nare asked to express their opinions about. Although no terms are completely\ndevoid of negative or positive connotations, we will use concepts that are as neutral\nas possible. Hence we will use `social groups' or `cultural minorities' to refer to\nimmigrants, homosexuals and distinct racial minorities, and not describe them\nas `outgroups', since the latter could be read as implying that we as researchers\nconsider these groups as somehow deviant from the norm, which is not our inten-\ntion. Nonetheless, when certain terms are used in the wording of survey questions\n(such as `immigrants' and `homosexuals'), we will copy this terminology to avoid\nconfusion. In situations where the majority population needs to be referred to,\nJanmaat and Keating 3\nwe will use `majority' or `White British' rather than the `native' or `indigenous'\npopulation as use of the latter implies that we would consider the objects of toler-\nance as somehow less native. In the case of immigrants, this is undoubtedly true,\nbut not in the case of other minorities.\nThe drivers of tolerance\nThere is extensive literature on tolerance and prejudice, particularly regarding immi-\ngrants (see Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2014), but considerably less debate about\nwhere these attitudes come from and why individuals (and societies more generally)\nbecome more or less tolerant of cultural others at particular points in time. This\nvaried literature contains theories that are optimistic about the future of tolerance,\nand some that are decidedly more pessimistic. The optimistic perspectives predict\nrising levels of tolerance while the pessimistic ones anticipate stable or declining\nlevels of tolerance. These perspectives can further be subdivided into those discern-\ning clear generational differences in tolerance related to different circumstances in\npeople's formative years and those envisaging rising or falling levels of tolerance due\nto more general processes affecting everyone equally. The former can be said to\nanticipate cohort effects while the latter would expect to find period effects.\nOptimistic perspectives\nThe optimistic theories tend to focus on the fact that societies as a whole are\nbecoming more tolerant over time and can point to a number of social changes,\ntechnological developments and cultural shifts to explain these changes.\nDevelopments in biology and genetics, for instance, have exposed racist ideology\nas fundamentally flawed (Ford, 2008). Politically, racist views have become com-\npletely unacceptable due to their association with the Holocaust and Apartheid\n(Ford, 2008). Racial intolerance should thus have declined as the assumptions on\nwhich such attitudes are based have been shown to be false and morally objection-\nable. At the same time, an international normative discourse on human rights\nstressing the dignity and equality of all human beings has become ever more influ-\nential as evidenced by the treaties and agreements that many states have signed\n(Osler and Starkey, 2006). This process can be also be expected to have increased\ntolerance by increasing the normative pressure on people to respect other people's\ncultures and views. Tolerance may also have risen because of British society having\nbecome ever more ethnically diverse. This assumption is based on the idea that\nthe growing visibility of ethnic minorities in all domains of society and the increas-\ning cross-cultural contacts in everyday settings have made the majority (White\nBritish) population more familiar with, and more inclusive in its attitudes towards,\nethnic minorities (Ford, 2008). This echoes contact theory, the key tenet of which\nis that informal intercultural contact reduces prejudice and enhances sympathy\nand identification with the cultural other (Allport, 1954; Pettigrew and Tropp,\nOther `optimistic' perspectives would argue that rising levels of tolerance are\nmainly due to a process of generational substitution whereby new, young and more\ntolerant cohorts replace more intolerant, older ones. The process of growing diver-\nsity might partly influence tolerance through this mechanism, as not all age groups\nexperience diversity equally. Young people have more opportunities for\ncross-cultural contacts than do older people because the immigrant population\ndiversity than previous generations of young people have, they are likely to be\nmore tolerant than both older age groups and earlier generations of young people.\nThe idea of rising levels of tolerance due to generational replacement is mostly\nassociated with the work of Ronald Inglehart on post-materialism. Inglehart and\nWelzel (2005) argue that the steady rise in living standards in the Western world\nafter the Second World War meant that new generations grew up under ever more\nprosperous and secure conditions. With their basic needs satisfied, these gener-\nations developed so-called post-materialist values in their formative years, includ-\ning self-fulfilment, freedom of choice and expression and tolerance of cultural\nothers, and have retained these values in the remainder of their lives. Inglehart\nand Welzel (2005) discern a steady shift from the 1960s towards post-materialist\nvalues generated by a process of young, post-materialist generations replacing\nolder, materialist ones. Thus, with tolerance being one of the core dimensions\nof this values syndrome, we would expect it to have risen over the last 50 years\nand we would anticipate the younger generations to show the highest levels of\ntolerance.\nA final optimistic perspective predicting rising levels of tolerance due to gener-\national replacement highlights the steady process of educational expansion. OECD\ndata show that the United Kingdom has indeed experienced a significant educa-\ntional expansion in the last 15 years: The percentage of 25- to 65-year-olds com-\n(OECD, 2015: 44). This process, which led to new generations being ever better\neducated than previous ones, is likely to have produced a growth in tolerance\nbecause of the strong association at the individual level between educational attain-\nment and tolerance, which is one of the most consistent findings in social science\nSeveral reasons have been proposed as to why more educated people are more\ntolerant. First, education enhances the knowledge and reasoning skills of people,\nallowing them to refute prejudiced claims and dismiss irrational fears about cul-\ntural others (Nunn et al., 1978). Second, education cultivates tolerance directly\nthrough socialisation: the longer individuals stay in the education system, the\nmore they are exposed to tolerance as the core value that it promotes and thus\nthe more likely they are to internalise it (Hyman and Wright, 1979; Stubager, 2008).\nThird, education enhances the competitive position of individuals and diminishes\nfeelings of economic insecurity. Educated people therefore see people from other\ncultures as less threatening, which makes them more welcoming and inclusive in\nJanmaat and Keating 5\nPessimistic theories\nAlthough education tends to have a positive effect at the individual level, the rela-\ntionship between education and tolerance can be complex and it also features in one\nof the pessimistic theories of tolerance. To understand this perspective, we must first\ndistinguish between the absolute and the positional effect of education (see\nCampbell, 2006; Nie et al., 1996). While the first two reasons noted above relate\nto the absolute effect of education, the last reason, that is the argument that educa-\ntion improves the competitive position of individuals, refers to the positional effect.\nIf the effect is absolute, any increase in education levels should, over time, yield\nhigher aggregate levels of tolerance among the society as a whole. In that case, the\neffect of educational expansion on tolerance is simply compositional (i.e. the sum of\nindividual attainment levels). Educational expansion can then be expected to lead to\na rise in tolerance through the substitution of older, less educated generations by\nyounger, more educated ones (see, e.g. Stubager, 2008). By contrast, if the effect of\neducation on tolerance is mainly positional, educational expansion cannot be\nexpected to have increased overall levels of tolerance much since the competitive\nposition of more educated individuals will not improve when other people also\nbecome more educated. Put simply, if levels of education are raised for everyone,\nthen having even more education than previous generations of young people does\nnot increase one's competitive advantage today, and nor does it enhance a sense of\neconomic security, which is a contributory factor to explaining why people with\nmore education are more likely to be tolerant (see, e.g. Borgonovi, 2012).\nThe notion of competition is also key to the second pessimistic perspective \u00ad the\nperceived threat theory. This theory contends that the scarcer the resources in\nsociety, and the greater the competition for them, the more people will tend to\nview outsiders as threatening and the more negative and hostile their opinions will\nindeed a decisive factor, one would expect young people, in particular, to show\ndeclining levels of tolerance as this age group has disproportionately been affected\nby the rising costs of education and housing and the growing precariousness of jobs\nin Britain. Moreover, at the same time when these conditions were worsening, the\ncountry experienced unprecedented levels of immigration, with net inward migra-\ntion steadily increasing from the mid-1990s onwards to reach an all-time high of\nperceived, is not just a function of the amount of resources themselves, but also of\nthe number of people seeking access to them, high levels of immigration can equally\nspark feelings of threat and intolerance among the `indigenous' majority (Coenders\nSome have argued that the majority need not only feel threatened in an eco-\nnomic sense. A sudden influx of immigrants could also spark a sense of cultural\nthreat: a feeling that one's identity, established ways of life, and one's norms and\nvalues are being challenged by outsiders (Chandler and Tsai, 2001; Sears and\nHenry, 2003). Either way, the result is that people retreat into their own commu-\nnity, develop hostile attitudes towards the ethnic minorities living in the same\nneighbourhood and reject a discourse of racial equality and multiculturalism, as\nhas been well demonstrated by case studies of White British youth in London and\nthe northern industrial towns of Oldham and Rochdale (Hewitt, 2005; Thomas and\nSanderson, 2013). These case studies also show how localised and contingent on\nparticular circumstances these feelings can be. Such feelings of threat can, more-\nover, be activated by political entrepreneurs claiming that immigrants bring noth-\n(2010), negative political rhetoric influences how people evaluate a recent increase\nof immigrants in their home region. As Britain experienced a severe economic crisis\nafter 2008, attracted high numbers of immigrants and saw the rise of a political\nparty critical of immigration and the European Union (the United Kingdom\nIndependence Party), one would, based on these theories, expect tolerance of cul-\ntural others and minorities to have decreased among all age groups over the last 15\nyears. By this logic, this downward trend should be particularly evident among\nyoung people; this generation fared worse in the aftermath of the global recession\nand this, coupled with the increasingly insecure place in the labour market, could\nfuel anti-immigrant sentiment (Mierin\nmoreover, face more competition from immigrants in areas such as the job and\nhousing markets than older age groups due to the youthful age profile and resi-\ndential preferences of immigrants (Camarota, 2013).\nThe idea of a resurgent nationalism can be seen as another pessimistic perspec-\ntive. This perspective questions whether the post-national discourse on human\nrights and cosmopolitan citizenship, as discussed earlier, has truly become more\nsalient. Scholars embracing this view observe that nationalism has made a come-\nback since the turn of the century, as manifested by the electoral successes of\npopulist anti-immigrant parties in Europe (see Mierin\nEuropean Union and a growing realism in international relations (Kaplan, 2012;\nRachman, 2014). Mainstream parties have adopted some of the rhetoric and pro-\nposed policies of these populist parties, leading to more restrictive immigration and\nnaturalisation regimes everywhere and a discourse more generally of protecting and\nprivileging the majority population (Van Spanje, 2010). These recent trends suggest\nthat the taboo on expressing negative sentiments towards cultural others, especially\nregarding immigrants, has weakened, leading possibly to growing intolerance in all\nage groups. That said, since the perspective is not making claims about gener-\national differences, young people are not expected to show any higher or lower\nlevels of tolerance than other age groups.\nData and methods\nWe draw on data of the British Social Attitudes survey (BSA) and the World\nValues Survey (WVS) to investigate trends in tolerant attitudes and examine\nJanmaat and Keating 7\nsome of the drivers of tolerance as suggested by the aforementioned perspectives.\nWhile the BSA has relevant data going up to 2013, the WVS allows for an assess-\nment of trends only until 2006 since the United Kingdom did not participate in the\nlatest round of this survey. The WVS is useful nonetheless as it allows us to trace\ntrends further back in time, particularly regarding attitudes on immigrants. Both\nsurveys include nationally representative samples of the British population, with\nsample sizes varying between 1000 and 3400 respondents across the different waves\nof the two studies.\nFirst, we present a series of trend graphs showing the responses of different age\ngroups on various tolerance indicators. In each graph a particular age group at a\ncertain point in time is compared to that same age group at an earlier or later point\nin time. One and the same age group thus represents different cohorts across dif-\nferent points in time. These graphs allow us to compare young people to older age\ngroups at the same point in time and to compare them back in time to their parents\nwhen they were young. They further permit a provisional evaluation of the afore-\nmentioned perspectives.\nWe complement the review or trends with a multivariate (OLS regression) ana-\nlysis of age, period and cohort (APC) effects, based on the pooled samples of\nsome perspectives suggest that changing attitudes reflect a cohort effect (e.g. post-\nmaterialism and growing diversity) while others posit they represent period effects\n(e.g. resurgent nationalism). APC analysis has some important limitations, most\nnotably the classic identification problem, which means that, as the three effects are\ncompletely linearly dependent, they cannot be distinguished; for instance, knowing\nhow old someone is (age) and the year of the survey (period), means knowing when\nthis person was born (cohort) (Tilley and Evans, 2014). This problem has led some\nscholars to abandon statistical analysis of APC effects altogether and exclusively\nuse descriptive and graphical investigation of data (e.g. Voas and Chaves, 2016).\nWe believe a statistical approach does have its merits, however. On the one hand,\nthe three effects can still be estimated by using proxies for one or more of the three\neffects (see, for instance, Coenders and Scheepers, 1998; Ford, 2008). We follow\nFord's approach in using conditions relating to life stages, such as being married,\nbeing a widower and owning a home, as proxies for age. These conditions have\nbeen shown to be related to authoritarianism (Altemeyer, 1995) and political orien-\ntations (Binstock and Quadagno, 2001), and are therefore also likely to influence\ntolerance. Including these proxies in the models helps to prevent multicollinearity\nbetween the APC variables (Ford, 2008: 619). On the other hand, by assigning\ndifferent significance levels to the various effects, the statistical approach allows\nresearchers to arrive at a better assessment of the relative importance of the dif-\nferent factors than a trend analysis. Indeed, a multivariate APC analysis allows us\nto draw more precise inferences regarding the explanatory power of some of the\naforementioned perspectives (see further later).\nCohort is measured with year of birth rather than five or 10-year periods (such\nas birth decades) because of the arbitrariness in establishing the boundaries for\nthe latter. Period is represented by BSA Round. Although we have data on\njust two or three rounds for the outcomes to be analysed, these rounds are\ncircumstances and zeitgeists. In 1996, Western countries experienced robust\neconomic growth, liberal democracy reigned supreme and globalisation was\nseen as a welcome and/or inevitable process; in 2013 Western economies lay in\ntatters, anti-immigrant parties with protectionist agendas were quickly gaining\npopularity and authoritarianism was on the rise globally. The BSA rounds\nthus truly reflect very different periods. It is important to note, though, that\nperiod represents a multitude of macro-level influences, including educational\nexpansion, net immigration, the economic crisis, the alleged growing salience of\na human rights discourse and the alleged comeback of nationalism. We cannot\ninclude variables representing these influences in the model as there are not\nenough data points (points in time) to assess the effects of these variables indi-\nvidually. Therefore, if we find a period effect we cannot be sure what this effect\nprecisely stands for. It could represent the influence of any one of these variables\nor a combination of them.\nWe further added highest qualification attained (HQA) to the models (see\nTable 1 for the categories of this variable). The outcomes are racial tolerance,\nsupport for equal treatment of immigrants and perceptions of ethnic competition\n(see Figures 3, 6 and 7 for the wording of the items on which these outcomes are\nbased). The analyses on the latter two outcomes are based on a sample of those\nidentifying as British; the analysis of the first-named outcome only includes those\nidentifying as White British. We could not run the analyses on the same group of\nrespondents as ethno-racial identity was not available in all the BSA waves for the\nlatter two outcomes, while the item on racial intolerance was asked of only White\nBritish respondents.2\nThe APC analysis enables us to look more closely at the optimistic perspectives\nin particular. If HQA is the only variable with a significant (and positive) effect on\ntolerance, rising levels of tolerance are exclusively due to increasing levels of edu-\ncation, which would strongly support the education as absolute effect argument.\nHowever, if birth cohort is the only variable with a significant (and positive) effect,\nit is not their higher education levels but something else that makes young people\nmore tolerant, indicating that the post-materialism and growing diversity perspec-\ntives are better able to account for the trends in tolerance.\nIt is more difficult to evaluate the different pessimistic perspectives because it is\nnot quite clear which influence is captured by period. Nonetheless, some more\nprecise inferences can be made. If the effects of period and cohort are both negative\nin a model with tolerance on immigrants as outcome, tolerance towards this group\nhas declined and is lowest amongst the young, which would indicate that the\nperceived threat theory has excellent predictive power. If only the effect of\nperiod is negative in the said model and all the other effects are insignificant,\nthen the results are more in accordance with the expectations of the resurgent\nnationalism argument or the education as positional effect thesis.\nJanmaat and Keating 9\nTrends over time: Are young people today more tolerant\nthan previous generations of youth?\nHave people become more tolerant of minorities in general in their immediate\nenvironment or does this only apply to some minorities? Figures 1 to 4 show\nthat the latter is the case. Over time, Britons have become steadily more accepting\nof homosexuals and people of a different racial background, and this trend can be\nseen in all age groups. In other words, the current generation of young people are\nfor middle-aged people and pensioners. This development has, in fact, been so\npronounced that, by the end of the time series of the WVS (2006), only small\nminorities in each age group still have issues with living next door to homosexuals\nor people of a different race (see Figures 1 and 2). Data from the BSA going up to\n2013 confirm this trend for racial tolerance. Ever smaller numbers of people state\nthat they would have problems with one of their close relatives marrying a person\nof Black or West Indian origin (Figure 3; the question was asked only of White\nBritish respondents). The fact that the lowest levels of intolerance can be observed\nat the end of the time series when Britain was in the midst of a severe recession\n'On this list are various groups of people.

We further see that the youngest age group tends to be the most tolerant and\nthe oldest group the least tolerant whatever the period or the social group we are\nexamining (only regarding the BSA question on racial tolerance do we see that the\n35- to 54-year-olds are marginally more tolerant than the youngest age group\ntowards the end of time series). Together, these results provide some provisional\nsupport for the optimistic perspectives, i.e. the international human rights dis-\ncourse, the growing diversity perspective, post-materialism theory and the absolute\neffect of education hypothesis.\nImmigrants \u00ad the new `other'?\nBy contrast, when we look at how attitudes towards immigrants have changed over\n'Would you mind or not mind if one of your close\nrelatives were to marry a person of Black or West Indian\norigin?'\n% 'mind a lot'*\nFigure 3.

And at each of the three time points we looked at, young people (age\n15\u00ad29) expressed the least opposition to this. These results are in keeping with the\ntrends in tolerance towards the other groups discussed above. Yet this trend is\nhad not only started to rise again among the under 50s, but opposition was higher\nThe deviating pattern regarding trends on immigrants is even more pronounced\nwhen looking at recent trends in exclusionary attitudes and perceptions of compe-\ntition. We see, for instance, a very pronounced rise among the young and an almost\nequally salient increase among middle-aged people in the numbers supporting the\nidea that employers should give priority to the majority population over immi-\ngrants in times of crisis (see Figure 5); by contrast, there has been virtually no\nchange in attitudes among the over 50s. What is more, the absolute levels are also\nnoteworthy: in each age group, clear majorities supported this form of unequal\nDeclining support for equal treatment can also be seen when turning to the more\nrecent data from the BSA survey. Asked about whether `legal immigrants to Britain\nwho are not citizens should have the same rights as British citizens', all age groups\nexpressed much lower levels of agreement with this idea in 2013 than 10 years\nearlier (Figure 6). Falling support for equal treatment is accompanied by rising\nperceptions of competition as all age groups show increases in the percentages\nagreeing with the statement that `immigrants take jobs away from people who\nwere born in Britain' (Figure 7). Again, the overall levels are remarkably high:\nalmost 50% of the 18- to 34-year-olds and a majority of the 55-plus group support\nthe statement. These rising levels of unwelcoming attitudes are all the more remark-\nable in view of the growing share of ethnic minorities in the British population\n(Storm et al., 2017) and the tendency of ethnic minority respondents, both of the\nfirst and second generation, to be significantly more inclusive in their attitudes\n'When jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this\ncountry over immigrants'\n(% agree)\nFigure 5.

Perhaps\ntheir own experience as immigrant or that of their parents makes these groups\nidentify with immigrants and express greater sympathy towards them (Janmaat,\n2014). Nonetheless, with the passing of generations, links with immigrant pasts\nmay weaken. It has been noted, for instance, that Britain's ethnic minorities also\nfavour a reduction in migration rates and start to think less positively about immi-\ngrants, although the White British are still more critical on immigration (Amrani,\nEqually interesting is that the youngest age group becomes virtually indistin-\nguishable from the middle-aged groups in their tolerance levels. On some indica-\ntors they even become slightly less tolerant than the latter.

Young people are still the most supportive of extending equal rights to\nimmigrants.\nIn sum, the trend analysis shows that young people's attitudes towards mino-\nrities are more complex than it is sometimes portrayed. When the focus is on the\nacceptance of racial and sexual minorities, we see that young people are more\ntolerant that their elders or than previous generations of young people. Yet this\ntrend towards tolerance does not necessarily extend to other minorities. When we\nexamined attitudes towards immigrants, including support for equal treatment and\nperceptions of competition, we found declining or stabilising levels of tolerance and\nin some cases, slightly lower levels of tolerance among young people than middle-\naged respondents.\nThese contrasting trends are all the more remarkable as previous research has\nfound attitudes towards different racial and cultural groups to be so strongly\ninterrelated that they have been interpreted as manifestations of a latent dimen-\nsion of tolerance (e.g. Brewer, 1986; Dejaeghere et al., 2012; Scheepers et al.,\n2002). It is perhaps the determination to find such a singular dimension that has\nprevented scholars from looking at the variation in the attitudes towards different\ngroups or from assessing whether these attitudes cluster equally strongly among\ndifferent social groups or generations. Indeed, using Wave 5 of WVS and corre-\nlating the items of Figures 1, 2, 4 and 5 to one another, we find a marked\ndifference between the youngest (those born after 1975) and the oldest group\n(those born before 1954) in the clustering of these attitudes.3.Among the\nyoung, attitudes towards other racial groups and homosexuals are not signifi-\ncantly related to attitudes on immigrants and support for discrimination of immi-\ngrants; however, among the old respondents, all four attitudes are closely\ninterlinked. In other words, while a more general disposition of tolerance may\nwell inform attitudes on immigrants among the old, the young seem to decouple\nimmigration issues from the norm of accepting and embracing cultural minorities.\nThese diverging attitudes among the young towards different minorities in a way\nmake sense in view of the greater competition young people face from immigrants\nand their generally more vulnerable position on the labour market, as discussed\nearlier. They also shed further light on our finding that contrasting trends are\nparticularly evident among the young (compare, for instance, Figures 1 and 2\nwith Figure 5).\nThe trends also raise questions about the optimistic theories discussed above.\nThe declining levels of tolerance regarding immigrants in the youngest age group\nare particularly noteworthy in view of educational expansion, which means that\nyoung people today are more highly educated than young people at any point in\nthe past. This might indicate a positional effect of education. In the next section, we\nwill examine the explanatory power of the various theoretical perspectives more\nclosely.\nA closer look at the perspectives explaining tolerance:\nAPC effects\nTable 1 presents the results of the APC analyses. A striking finding is that educa-\ntional attainment exerts a strong positive influence on all three outcomes. That is\nTable 1. The determinants of three (in)tolerance outcomes: age, period and cohort effects.\nRacial\nintolerance\nSupport for\nequal treatment\nof immigrants\nPerceptions of\ncompetition from\nimmigrants\nMarital status\nMarried (ref cat)\nTenure\nOwner (ref cat)\nBSA round (period)\nHighest qualification (HQA)\nPrimary (ref cat)\nNote: None of the three analyses exceeded critical multicollinearity levels, as gauged by the variance inflation\nfactor (VIF).\nJanmaat and Keating 15\nthe only commonality across the three analyses, however. The effects of year of\nbirth (cohort) and BSA Round (period) vary radically across outcomes.\nIf we look at racial intolerance, we see a strong negative cohort effect indicating\nthat young generations are significantly more racially tolerant than older ones. It is\nworth mentioning that this effect occurs in addition to a strong negative effect of\neducational attainment. This means that the generational effect is not only due to\nyounger cohorts being more highly educated than older ones. Evidently other\ninfluences must be driving this effect as well, such as, for instance, more prosperous\nconditions during one's formative years, or more contact with cultural others. We\nfurther note that the effect of year of birth is significant while controlling for\nmarital status and tenure, which indicates that it does represent a cohort effect\nand not, or not just, an age effect. (We have to add the words `or not just' as we can\nnever be sure whether marital status and tenure fully capture the effect of aging.\nOnly a longitudinal study with several panels would permit a better disentangle-\nment of age and cohort effects.)\nOf further interest is that the period effect is non-significant. It is difficult to say\nwhat this precisely means. It could be that macro-level processes, such as rising\nrates of immigration, the post-2008 economic crisis, growing nationalist rhetoric or\nan increasingly influential post-national discourse of human rights, are not influ-\nential. It could also mean that the first three processes enhance intolerance, but that\nthese influences are cancelled out by an increasingly prevalent human rights dis-\ncourse that promotes tolerance.\nTogether, these findings are quite consistent with the optimistic perspectives,\nsuch as those of post-materialism and growing diversity. As the period effect is\nnon-existent, they also suggest that the effect of education on racial intolerance is\nabsolute rather than positional (if the effect of education had been positional we\nshould have seen a positive effect of period). The strong cohort effect further sug-\ngests that racial tolerance is likely to increase in the near future as more tolerant\nyoung generations replace less tolerant older ones.\nIn contrast, the effect of cohort is insignificant and that of period highly signifi-\ncant when we look at the two other outcomes of interest: namely support for equal\ntreatment and perceptions of ethnic discrimination. Regarding this period effect,\nthe more recent the BSA round, the less supportive people are of offering equal\nrights to immigrants and the more they feel that immigrants take jobs away from\nthe majority population, controlling for all other conditions. This indicates grow-\ning exclusionism and intolerance towards immigrants, which is the opposite of\nwhat the human rights perspective would predict. Educational attainment has a\npositive effect on support for equal treatment and a negative one on perceptions of\nethnic discrimination. In combination with the non-effect of cohort, this suggests\nthat higher tolerance levels amongst the young are entirely due to younger gener-\nations being more highly educated than older ones; once you control for educa-\ntional attainment, differences between the generations disappear.4. This means the\npost-materialism and the growing diversity perspectives cannot account for the\npatterns on these outcomes. Instead, the results are much more consistent with\nthe `pessimistic' perspectives. Support for one of these perspectives, the perceived\nthreat theory, is mixed, however: on the one hand, the theory correctly predicts\ngrowing exclusionary attitudes towards immigrants, but on the other hand, and\ncontrary to expectation, young people are not more hostile to immigrants than\nolder generations despite having taken the brunt of the economic crisis and facing\nmore competition from immigrants. Lastly, as the period effect is as strong, or\nstronger, than the effect of educational attainment and as exclusionary and intoler-\nant attitudes on immigrants have increased (as shown by the trend analyses), there is\nmore evidence for a positional than an absolute effect of education. We could not\ndetermine, however, whether the resurgent nationalism idea or the positional effects\nmodel has most power in accounting for the attitudes on immigrants because the\nperiod effect can represent a number of macro-level influences simultaneously.\nMore generally, the analyses of APC effects confirm the observations regarding\ntrends. Reported acceptance of racial diversity differs markedly across generations\nand shows a steady upward trend undisturbed by fluctuations in the economy or\nimmigration. However, the story is completely different for tolerance outcomes\nrelating to immigrants. Processes such as rising immigration or economic contrac-\ntion are likely to be highly influential (although it could not be determined which\none of these precisely had a decisive influence) and differences between the gener-\nations are small, reflecting only differences in aggregate educational attainment. In\nshort, patterns on racial tolerance cannot be generalised to attitudes on immi-\ngrants. The British, and particularly young people, thus appear to distinguish\nbetween different minorities. It seems that they increasingly accept people of a\ndifferent skin colour as one of `us' (provided they are British), while immigrants\nare ever more feared and considered as `them'.\nConclusions\nIn this paper we set out to examine the oft-cited claim that young people are more\ntolerant than their elders and/or previous generations. We found that, on the\nwhole, contemporary youth in Britain are more tolerant of racial diversity and\nof homosexuality than older age groups and previous generations of young\npeople. Trend analysis clearly shows that intolerance towards these groups has\ndeclined markedly since the 1980s, and indeed, some measures of racial diversity\nsuggest that among young people opposition to these types of racial diversity has\nalmost disappeared. Yet we found that quite a different pattern emerged once we\nexamined youth attitudes towards immigrants and foreign workers. Over the past\nfour decades, attitudes towards these groups have become more rather than less\nnegative; this pattern is true across all age groups, and young people are not\nnecessarily the most tolerant age group. Young people today are less accepting\nof immigrants than previous generations of young people. This is remarkable\nbecause they are more educated than their past peers and because well-educated\npeople are usually more tolerant in their views on immigrants than poorly\neducated ones.\nJanmaat and Keating 17\nThrough further analysis we also examined whether these attitudinal changes\ncould be attributed to the replacement of generations (i.e. a cohort effect) or to\nconditions prevailing in a certain period (i.e. a period effect). We found that the\nincrease in racial tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality primarily represents a\ncohort effect, induced not just by rising levels of education but also by a broader\ncultural shift in attitudes. By contrast, shifts in attitudes towards immigrants\nappear to be more a function of the prevalent social conditions, confirming pessim-\nistic scenarios about intolerance rising in times of crisis and enhanced competition\nover scarce resources or becoming more salient as part of a virulent resurgence of\nnationalism. For many young people, the prevailing conditions have meant fewer\nopportunities in housing and employment, and a media environment that tends to\nlink these challenges to a surge in immigration. These contemporary contextual\nissues may well explain why young people are less accommodating in their attitudes\ntowards immigrants than towards other cultural minorities.\nThis paper contributes to the wider literature by showing that, even though\nattitudes towards a variety of cultural minorities may be strongly interlinked,\nthey need not change in the same way over time, nor be influenced by the same\nconditions. Putting the spotlight on contrasting trends in such attitudes is a focus\nthat few studies share. Most of the existing studies zoom in on one outcome among\na series of outcomes capturing tolerance and tend to be quite unequivocal in their\nconclusions as to the theoretical perspectives that can best explain the variation in\nthemselves to a single outcome. Thus, Hainmueller and Hopkins (2014) focus on\nattitudes towards immigrants and observe that concerns about immigrants consti-\ntuting a cultural threat to the community are a stronger factor in explaining such\nattitudes than personal economic circumstances. Our study shows that there is no\none factor or theoretical perspective that can best account for the variation in\nattitudes towards various minorities; which factor has most explanatory power\ndepends on the minority that people are asked to express their opinions about.\nThis finding, in particular, casts doubt on those studies that collapse a range of\ntolerance outcomes into one outcome and proceed by investigating the determin-\nants of this outcome (e.g. Dejaeghere et al., 2012).\nMore generally, our findings guard against the assumption that dissolving\nboundaries regarding one group can easily be generalised to other groups. As we\nhave seen, growing acceptance of people of different racial backgrounds and dif-\nferent sexual preferences coincide with a hardening of the split between the major-\nity population and immigrants. We are certainly not the first to note such a process\nof shifting boundary making. Back (1993), for instance, found a similar dynamic\namongst a group of White and Black youth in South London; the engagement of\nthis group with Afro-American and Afro-Caribbean popular culture engendered a\nde-racialised `neighbourhood nationalism' (p. 220), which, however, became highly\nexclusionary and hostile towards Asian minorities and Vietnamese in particular.\nThe findings of Back and our own study thus show that the development\nof seemingly more inclusive identities only leads to new forms of exclusion and\nothering. It is all the more sobering to realise that such new patterns of exclusion\ncontinue to happen despite new generations being better educated than previous\nones. This tempers the optimistic view that rising levels of education should result\nin greater broadmindedness towards cultural others more generally.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the ESRC (grant ref:\nNotes\n1. Unfortunately, due to shortcomings in the data regarding the measurement of key vari-\nables we could not perform APCE analysis on the WVS data.\n2. The BSA also asked White British respondents to express their attitudes towards Asians,\nbut these questions were not asked of other ethnic groups. It is somewhat surprising that\nonly this group was questioned about their racial tolerance of other groups. The survey\norganisers may have assumed that issues of racial intolerance only, or mainly, apply to\nthe White British population.\n3. The results of these analyses can be obtained from the authors upon request.\n4. Indeed, once educational attainment is omitted from the model, the effect of cohort\nbecomes significant for both outcomes (results can be obtained from the authors upon\nrequest).\nReferences\nAllport G (1954) The Nature of Prejudice.
