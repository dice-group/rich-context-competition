Again, center differences were noted in the\nrisk for hypertension at 6 years of age.\nCOMMENT\nIn this report, we have demonstrated that in full-term\ninfants, IUGR status at birth appears to be linked to risk\nfor hypertension in childhood after adjusting for poten-\ntial confounders. These results suggest that IUGR status\nat birth may result in lifelong consequences because\nhypertension is a marker for adult cardiovascular\ndisease.\nWe excluded preterm infants in this study because pre-\nterm birth has effects on the vascular system that persist\nto adult life. Kistner et al13 have demonstrated that pre-\nterm birth affects the retinal vascular system, both func-\ntionally and structurally, resulting in a lower threshold\nfor the development of vascular disease. Another reason\nfor excluding children who were born preterm was that\nBP has been found to be significantly higher in very low-\nbirth-weight subjects in late adolescence as compared with\nnormal-birth-weight subjects.14\nBlood pressure was measured in our study by the por-\ntable Dinamap monitor, an oscillometric device, and com-\npared with normative data obtained by the sphygmoma-\nnometer auscultatory method.16 Relationships between\nBP measurements using the Dinamap monitor and the\nsphygmomanometer method have been debated. Ear-\nlier reports by investigators have noted the accuracy of\nBP measurements by the Dinamap monitor in infants and\nchildren.19,20 Most recent data, however, have shown that\nhigher readings are obtained by the Dinamap monitor as\ncompared with the sphygmomanometer.21 However, the\nDinamap monitor is the most common instrument used\nin current clinical practice. The BP cuffs used in this study\nwere based on the recommendations established by the\nNational High Blood Pressure Education Program Work-\ning Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Ado-\nlescents.16 By doing so, we believe we have avoided the\npitfalls of inappropriate cuff selection.22\nIn this study, an association between increases in BMI\nand elevation in BP was noted. The systolic BP of chil-\ndren, adolescents, and adults is affected by BMI mea-\nsured at corresponding ages.23-26 Although overweight\nand obesity status were not seen in the 6-year-old chil-\ndren in this report, we anticipate the frequency of these\nconditions to increase as the children continue to be\nevaluated at older ages,27,28 when it is anticipated a\ngreater association of BMI with hypertension can be\ndemonstrated.\nRace and socioeconomic factors have been shown to\ninfluence hypertension. Black Americans are at higher\nrisk for hypertension than white Americans, and an in-\ncrease in overweight and obesity in Hispanic individu-\ntive risk for hypertension is significant for both sex and\noverweight status. The majority of the children in our\nstudy were black; however, no risk for hypertension was\nattributed to race. Unfortunately, we did not measure ma-\nternal BP at the child's 6-year clinic visit because this is\nan important confounder. We are currently obtaining BP\nmeasurements at the 9-year visit of the children. We did\nfind clinical site differences, which need to be explored.\nIn our study, at 6 years of age, we did not find a rela-\ntionship between sex and hypertension. Socioeconomic\nstatus was measured as maternal education in our study\nand was not associated with hypertension.\nTheassociationbetweenmaternallifestyleduringpreg-\nnancy and risk for hypertension in the offspring is unclear\nwhen examining prenatal cocaine exposure and elevated\nBP in childhood. Horn8 examined 12 infants following in-\ntrauterine cocaine exposure and noted that half of the in-\nfantshadhypertensionornormalBP.Needlmanetal9 found\nno differences in BP between 32 cocaine-exposed and 23\nnonexposed infants at 8 to 26 months of age. Echocardi-\nography of infants born to women following cocaine ex-\nposure and comparison infants (total of 87 infants evalu-\nated)hasnotdemonstratedanydifferenceintheshortening\nfraction of the left ventricle or abnormalities in cardiac\nrhythm.30 Prenatal exposure to cigarettes has been associ-\nated with elevated BP at birth and at 12 months of age.31\nWe did not find any association with either cocaine, opi-\nate, marijuana, tobacco, or alcohol use during pregnancy\nand hypertension at 6 years of age.\nTable 4.

All rights reserved.\nAdditional risk factors for hypertension are diet32,33 and\ngenetic determinant of cardiovascular risk.34 New arte-\nriosclerosis risk factors in obese children and adoles-\ncents and children and adolescents with hypertension and\ndiabetes are now available.35 As we follow up our cohort\nlongitudinally we will obtain data on these risk factors.\nSixteen percent of children who did not have growth\nrestriction at birth were found to have hypertension at 6\nyears of age. We suggest that this high rate reflects an\natypical study group that is predominantly inner city and\nAfrican American and has a low socioeconomic status.\nIn summary, in this study we have demonstrated an as-\nsociation between IUGR status at birth and elevated BP at\n6 years of age among full-term infants. Six years of age may\nbe too young to label a child at risk for hypertension; how-\never, an awareness of the prehypertensive status in child-\nhood may serve as a signal to institute healthful lifestyle\nchanges that might avert future cardiovascular disease.36\nCorrespondence:SeethaShankaran,MD,Neonatal-Perinatal\nMedicine,Children'sHospitalofMichigan,3901Beaubien\nAuthorContributions:Studyconceptanddesign:Shankaran,\nDas, Bauer, Bada, Lester, Wright, Higgins, and Poole.
