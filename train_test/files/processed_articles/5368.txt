Thus,\nwhen asked to choose which scenario is worse (sexual or emotional infidelity), sex\ndifferences emerge in favor of the evolutionary hypothesis, but when asked to rate how\nupsetting each type of infidelity is separately, the data are contradictory and sometimes\ninconsistent with the evolutionary hypothesis (Harris, 2005).\nAlthough these findings help to characterize jealousy in populations of men and\nwomen, little is known about individual differences in reactions to threats of sexual versus\nemotional infidelity or how individuals react to infidelity threat on the whole (emotional\nand sexual infidelity combined). Further, there has been limited attention to potential\nmoderators of these affects. Moreover, the available research examines how upset\nindividuals feel, but pays relatively little attention to either the specific aversive emotional\nreactions one feels or the behavioral intentions an individual may have in response to\nthreatened sexual infidelity, emotional infidelity, or infidelity as a whole.\nIn general, men and women become differentially upset over sexual as opposed to\nemotional infidelity, nevertheless substantial variation exists within each sex (see Harris,\n2005; Sagarin, 2005). Furthermore, men and women generally pursue different types of\nrelationships and focus on different aspects these relationships. Research examining\nrelations among types of men and women and individual differences in reaction to\nthreatened sexual or emotional infidelity may help characterize jealousy for a larger\nspectrum of individuals.\nOne relatively unexplored factor in the jealously literature is the relationship\nbetween reproductive strategies, jealousy, and reactions to threatened sexual and emotional\ninfidelity. Intuitively, the energy one places in obtaining and retaining sexual access to\npartners may impact reactions to infidelity. Specifically, individuals who allocate their\nlimited resources preferentially to Mating Effort (as opposed to Parental Effort) may focus\non the sexual aspects of a relationship, pursue mostly short-term relationships, and hence\nbe less concerned with emotional than sexual infidelity. Moreover, individuals who invest\nheavily in Mating Effort may behave in ways that benefit them in the short-term (e.g., deter\ninfidelity) independent of the long-term costs (e.g., long-term damage to the relationship).\nJealousy and Reproductive Strategies\nAlthough men and women differ systematically in their reactions to sexual and\nemotional infidelity (Buss et. al., 1992), we hypothesize that the sex of the individual\nserves primarily as a proxy for the fact that, overall, the reproductive strategies of men and\nwomen differ.\nGenerally men report more short-term and opportunistic mating strategies than do\nwomen (e.g., Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Rowe, Vazsonyi, and\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nsexual infidelity is more threatening than emotional infidelity to individuals involved in\nshort-term relationships, regardless of the sex of the respondent and that those reporting\nmore sexual partners (a short-term relationship focus) also tend to report that sexual rather\nthan emotional infidelity is a greater threat, again regardless of sex (Mathes, 2003).\nHence, sexual strategies influence the form of infidelity an individual considers\nmost threatening (See Harris 2005; Sagarin, 2005). Given that, we examine the hypothesis\nthat those pursuing short-term reproductive strategies (Higher-Mating-Effort, Lower-\nParental-Effort individuals) have relatively little concern over emotional infidelity or the\nrisk of losing a partner because their relationships involve little investment and are short-\nlived. In contrast, those pursuing long-term reproductive strategies (Lower-Mating-Effort,\nHigher-Parental Effort individuals) will have great concern over emotional infidelity or the\nrisk of losing a partner because of the large investment in the relationship. Thus, in\naddition to sex-specific triggers of jealousy, we suggest that evolutionary pressures shaped\nspecific reactions to sexual and emotional infidelity appropriate to the reproductive\nstrategies (or style) pursued by different individuals.\nSpecific Strategic Considerations\nMating Effort\nOne way to estimate differences in reproductive strategies is to measure Mating\nEffort (ME): The energy and resources one invests in obtaining and retaining access to\nsexual partners (Bjorklund and Shackelford, 1999; Rowe, et. al., 1997). Higher-ME\nindividuals report pursuing multiple short-term relationships, avoiding long-term\ninvestments, and placing great importance on gaining sexual access to partners. Hence,\nhigher levels of ME may produce costs in other areas of life because limited energy and\nresources (e.g., time, food, and wealth) are spent gaining and retaining sexual access to\npartners. Higher-ME individuals often report more sexual partners and more sexual\npromiscuity than individuals who are lower in ME (Rowe, et. al., 1997). Higher-ME\nindividuals also report competing with individuals of the same sex and resorting to\naggressive, coercive, and antisocial behavior to obtain or guard sexual access to a mate\nmore often than Lower-ME individuals (Egan et al., 2005; Lalumiere and Quinsey, 1996).\nThe effort expended in obtaining or guarding a mate that results from Higher-ME is\nnot the same as increasing one's investment in a long-term committed relationship.\nAccording to evolutionary theory, Higher-ME individuals guard their mates inconsistently\n\u00ad generally during their more fertile and hence more sexually active times (Rowe et. al.,\n1997). Thus, Higher-ME individuals restrict a competitor's access to other potential\npartners even though such behavior might lead to relationship dissolution in the future.\nBased on data such as these, we test the hypothesis that sexual infidelity threatens Higher-\nME individuals more than emotional infidelity because of the relative importance of sexual\nactivity in a short-term relationship and a lack of concern with partners eventual departure.\nIn addition, Higher-ME individuals are likely to react punitively to potentially unfaithful\npartners because punitive behavior will (at least in the short-term) deter infidelity. Thus,\njealousy in such individuals is likely to be driven toward the goal of restricting their\npartner's sexual behavior (Shackelford, Goetz, Buss, Euler, and Hoier, 2005; Shackelford,\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nIn contrast, although sexual infidelity due to the risk of cuckoldry and loss of\nresources invested in a single partner may threaten Lower-ME individuals, such individuals\nshould also be concerned with losing that partner in the long-term because such a loss\nwould result in poor reproductive outcomes. Hence, we predict that Lower-ME individuals\nare less likely than Higher-ME individuals to react to infidelity in punitive or destructive\nways because such individuals are more likely to frame their reproductive behavior in the\nlong run and are therefore not likely to risk losing the investments they have made in the\nrelationship.\nMate Value\nSexual and romantic attractiveness or Mate Value (MV) is related to infidelity\n(Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Brown and Moore, 2003). Little attention has been paid to\nrelationships between MV, jealousy over sexual as opposed to emotional infidelity, or\ninfidelity as a whole (sexual and emotional infidelity combined). We measure MV by\nasking an individual to rank him/herself on different traits desirable to a romantic partner\n(Kirsner, Figueredo, and Jacobs, 2003). These are traits attractive to both long-term and\nshort-term sexual or romantic partners.\nIndividuals with higher levels of Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA; a variable inversely\ncorrelated with MV) report experiencing higher levels of chronic jealousy (Brown and\nMoore, 2003). This suggests that relations between MV and reactions to sexual and\nemotional infidelity differ, at least partially, because Lower-MV individuals chronically\nanticipate infidelity.\nShort-term Mate Guarding is an effective deterrent to sexual infidelity. Lower-MV\nindividuals may use such strategies as a stop-gap, deterring infidelity (even in the face of\nlong-term costs) to temporarily retain the relationship. As a result, such individuals may\nfocus on short-term aspects of the relationship, be more emotionally upset about sexual\ninfidelity, and react more punitively to infidelity.\nConversely, Higher-MV individuals are less likely to be chronically concerned\nover infidelity at least partially because they are more valued as romantic partners and have\ngreater access to relationship opportunities (Brown and Moore, 2003). Hence, Higher-MV\nindividuals should be more upset over infidelity in general because it is an unexpected\noutcome and indicates poor mate choice. As a result, in a Higher-MV individual, being\nmore upset over the infidelity should motivate dissolution of the relationship, rather than an\nexhibition of punitive behaviors, because they can more easily find another high-quality\npartner.\nAversive Emotional Reactions\nSexual and emotional infidelity is associated with distinct emotional reactions (e.g.,\nsexual infidelity is often associated with anger, emotional infidelity is often associated with\nsadness or depression; Becker et al., 2004). It appears that men experience greater levels of\nanger than do women with respect to infidelity of any type (Sabini and Green, 2004). With\nthis in mind, we asked participants to report specific emotions that occur with sexual or\nemotional infidelity. This permitted us to examine the specific emotions and intentions\nparticipants report in response to imagined emotional or sexual infidelity.\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nPunitive Behavioral Intentions\nAlthough most researchers on jealousy ask participants to report attitudes and\nfeelings towards sexual and emotional infidelity, they seldom inquire about behavior.\nUnfortunately, attitudes and feelings do not adequately predict behavior (e.g., Fazio and\nZanna, 1978). Natural selection operates on behavior, not attitudes or feelings, over\nevolutionary time (Harris, 2005). Hence, it is important for evolutionary psychologists to\ninvestigate behavior \u00ad what people will do \u00ad as directly as possible.\nResearch in social psychology demonstrates that a good way to predict specific\nbehavior is to inquire of an individual's intentions (Ajzen, 1985). Given that evolutionary\ntheory guides the present research, we measured participants' intentions to act following\nimagined sexual or emotional infidelity. We also probed the presumably antecedent\nimpulses towards specific punitive actions by assessing the temptations that may or may\nnot be acted upon (Figueredo et al., 2006).\nWe measured intention to use punitive responses designed to stop infidelity in the\nshort-term, regardless of long-term costs to a relationship. We focused on unequivocally\npunitive behaviors to avoid any ambiguity over the hostile intention behind the action. For\nexample, an individual could \"ignore\" infidelity, however this action could be born out of\nan inability to cope with the overwhelming hurt of the infidelity, or this action could\nrepresent little concern over the infidelity. Thus, behaviors were selected which clearly\ndemonstrated a negative behavioral response towards the infidelity.\nGeneral Methodological Considerations\nWe have used multiple regression analyses to examine the hypotheses driving this\nstudy. Experts in statistical methodology suggest assigning hierarchical priority in multiple\nregression analyses to causally preceding variables when multiple predictors are correlated\n(or mutually confounded) (Cohen and Cohen, 1983). In the case of cross-sectional and non-\nexperimental research, causal priority can be established by the application of causal\ntheory, not by any purely statistical method.\nFor example, ME correlates with Sex of respondent because men generally invest\nmore in ME than do women (e.g., Gangestad and Simpson, 2000). We hypothesize that\n\"sex differences\" in jealousy are attributable to reproductive strategy rather than Sex per se.\nTherefore, we give ME hierarchical priority over Sex in our multiple regressions. Similarly,\nbecause self-reported MV might be biased by ME (e.g., Rowe et al., 1997), we give ME\nhierarchical priority over MV in our multiple regressions. Hence, for all hierarchical\nregression techniques reported herein, the theoretically based order of causal priority is\nME, then MV, then Sex, then ME*Sex. By giving the variables theoretically determined\npriority, we control for ME before assessing MV, for ME and MV before assessing Sex,\nand the ME, MV, and Sex before assessing the ME*Sex interaction. We estimate the\ninteraction last as per the standard recommended statistical techniques (Cohen and Cohen,\nA methodological flaw in much jealousy and infidelity research involves the\ncollinearity of reactions to different forms of infidelity. Originally, jealousy research\nexamined sex differences and two types of infidelity scenarios, sexual and emotional using\na 2 (Sex: Female vs. Male) X 2 (Infidelity: Sexual vs. Emotional Infidelity) chi-square\n(e.g., Buss et. al., 1992). As other researchers examined sexual and emotional infidelities\nusing Likert scales, alternative hypotheses, and different measures, they continued to\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nexamine each outcome or criterion variable using orthogonal statistical procedures (see\nSagarin, 2005, for review). Unfortunately, reactions to sexual and emotional infidelity are\nhighly correlated because sexual and emotional infidelities co-occur more often than not\n(see Harris, 2003 for a review). Thus, much in the same way that we cannot examine the\neffect of two highly correlated independent variables on some outcome using separate\nstatistical tests, we cannot examine reactions to sexual or emotional infidelity without\naccounting for the co-linearity between them.\nTheoretically, the order of causal priority between sexual and emotional infidelity is\ndifficult to establish. In some cases, individuals are solely interested in having sex outside a\nrelationship without emotional involvement, or emotional involvement may develop long\nafter sexual relations began. In other cases, an infatuation or romantic interest may develop\ngradually, leading to emotional infidelity, which may or may not lead to sexual contact.\nBecause it is theoretically difficult to determine the causal direction between the\ntwo forms of infidelity, we treat the two co-linear predictors as converging indicators of a\nsingle common factor (Gorsuch, 1983). Thus, all applicable analyses first examine relations\nbetween the hypothesized predictor variables and the overall reactions (aversive emotions,\npunitive impulses, or punitive intentions) as measured by a single common factor. We\noperationalize that factor as the average of the separately measured reactions to sexual and\nemotional infidelity, which we call the \"General Infidelity\" factor. Then, we control the\ninfluence of the common factor variance by entering it as the first predictor variable when\nwe conduct separate analyses of the unique variance associated with sexual or emotional\ninfidelity. This allows us to examine the direct effect any predictor variable may have\nspecifically on sexual or emotional infidelity by controlling for the overlap between the\ntwo.\nAlthough this procedure is commonly used for common factors consisting of three\nor more component indicators, in the present study we only have two indicators of the\nfactor (sexual and emotional infidelity). When estimated in this fashion, any unique effects\nupon sexual and emotional infidelity will be the exact inverse of each other. To avoid\nstatistical redundancy, we report all results for sexual infidelity after controlling for general\ninfidelity, and omit the inverse results for emotional infidelity (when controlled for general\ninfidelity) both in the text and tables. This procedure does not favor the effects of sexual\nover emotional infidelity, but instead accepts their complementary (additive) contributions\nto the general infidelity factor. We chose sexual infidelity as the unique variance of interest\nto be consistent with the direction of our hypotheses.\nFinally, we encountered the related problem of co-linearity among measures of the\naversive emotions, the punitive impulses, and the punitive intentions produced by jealousy.\nTo address this problem, we constructed a \"cascade\" (Demetriou, Christou, Spanoudis, and\nPlatsidou, 2002; Figueredo and Gorsuch, in press; Mouyi, 2006) of multiple regressions in\nwhich the multiple criterion variables are analyzed sequentially according to the\nhypothesized causal order, with each hierarchically prior criterion variable entered as the\nfirst predictor for the next. Each successive dependent variable is predicted from the initial\nset of ordered predictor variables, each time entering the immediately preceding criterion\nvariable hierarchically as the first predictor, to statistically control for any indirect effects\nthat might be transmitted through them, then entering all the ordered predictors from the\nprevious regression equation. Within this analytical scheme, the estimated effect of each\npredictor is limited to its direct relationships with the successive dependent variables. To\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nestablish a theoretical causal order, we hypothesized that aversive emotions causally\nprecede punitive impulses, and that punitive impulses causally precede punitive intentions.\nSummary\nOur purpose is to examine relations among self-reported reproductive strategy,\nsexual attractiveness and affective, impulsive, and intended reactions to imagined sexual or\nemotional infidelity. Additionally, we examine how differences in self-reported\nreproductive strategy may account for, augment, or interact with the sex of the participant\nto create different reactions towards sexual and emotional infidelity.\nWe examined relations among these variables and traditional measures of jealousy\n(see Buss et. al., 1992) by gathering self reports of how upset participants were towards\nimagined sexual and emotional infidelity, and which form of infidelity they considered\nmost upsetting. We also accounted for a methodological shortcoming of previous research\nby accounting for the collinearity between sexual and emotional infidelity when using\nLikert scales. We then examined relations among these individual differences and specific\naversive emotions, impulses to act punitively towards a partner, and intentions to act\npunitively towards a partner in response to sexual and emotional infidelity.\nWe predicted that Higher-ME individuals (those who generally pursue short-term\nreproductive strategies) would report being more upset by sexual infidelity than by\nemotional infidelity, report greater tendencies to behave punitively in response to either\nform of infidelity, report greater rates of jealousy overall than Lower-ME individuals, and\nreport greater temptation and likelihood to behave in punitive ways in response to sexual or\nemotional infidelity. In addition, we predicted that Lower-ME individuals would report\nbeing more upset over and react more punitively to sexual than to emotional infidelity. We\nalso predicted that previously reported sex differences will emerge from traditional\nmeasures of jealousy using both forced choice and Likert scale items, even after the effects\nof reproductive strategy was accounted for within the model. Finally, we predicted that\ninteractions between sex and reproductive strategy will help explain why some studies have\nfailed to replicate previous jealousy results, and why levels of high variation exist within\nStudy 1 examined relations among the hypothesized predictors (ME, MV, Sex, and\nME*Sex) and the form of infidelity (sexual or emotional) considered most threatening by\ndifferent individuals. We also measured the degree to which imagined sexual and\nemotional infidelity upset or threatened participants using Likert-scale measures.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nTwo hundred ninety-eight individuals participated in a study on \"Relationships and\nPerson Differences.\" Data from twenty-seven were omitted from the analyses due to\nincomplete data. The final sample contained 271 participants (185 women, 86 men)\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nenrolled in an introductory psychology or human sexuality course who volunteered to\nparticipate in exchange for course credit or extra credit for their course.\nProcedures and Measures\nParticipants were tested in groups of 5-12 (with one group of 70) within a classroom\nsetting. The questionnaires were presented in a large study packet. Participants were\nassured their answers would be anonymous, were asked to answer with the first response\nthat came to mind, and to complete the questionnaires in the order they were given.\nMating Effort. We first assessed ME by asking participants complete the Mating\nEffort Scale (MES), which assesses the effort people allocate towards short- and long-term\nrelationships and how hard they try to gain and retain access to sexual partners (Rowe et.\nal., 1997). The scale asks participants to indicate how much they agree (-2 = strongly\ndisagree, to +2 = strongly agree) with each of 10 statements in the scale, such as: \"I would\nrather date several boys (girls) at once rather than just one boy (girl).\" The items were\naveraged to form a single score. The MES demonstrated acceptable inter-item reliability\nMate Value. Participants then completed the Mate Value Inventory (MVI) which\nassesses their own perception of how attractive they are to potential mates (Kirsner et. al.,\n2003). The MVI is a 17-item (with five distracter items) self-assessment scale that asks\nparticipants to rate themselves on a set of characteristics empirically shown to be desirable\nin a mate. Examples of traits used on the MVI are: Attractive Face, Good Sense of Humor,\nand Intelligent. The traits were averaged to form a single scale: The scale also\ndemonstrated acceptable inter-item reliability (=.78).\nJealousy Manipulation. Participants then read the following:\nPlease think of a serious committed romantic relationship that you have had in the\npast, or that you currently have. Imagine that you discover that the person with\nwhom you've been seriously involved became interested in someone else. How\nmuch would each of the following distress or upset you?\nTwo two-choice pairs taken from previous research (Buss et al., 1992) followed this\ndescription:\nA) Imagining your partner forming a deep emotional attachment to that\nperson,\nB) Imagining your partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with that\nother person.\nA) Imagining your partner trying different sexual positions with that other\nperson,\nB) Imagining your partner falling in love with that other person.\nLikert Scale Items. Participants were asked to react to each item on a Likert scale of:\n-3 = the most upset you have ever been, to +3 = extremely happy. The Likert scale items\nwere first averaged separately for Sexual and for Emotional Infidelity, creating one two-\nitem scale for Sexual Infidelity and one two-item scale for Emotional Infidelity, measuring\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nhow upset a participant reported being in response to the two Sexual and two Emotional\nInfidelity scenarios respectively. This, however, resulted in a high correlation between the\ntwo-item reaction to Sexual Infidelity scale and the two-item reaction to Emotional\nInfidelity scale (r=.58, p=<.0001). Therefore we created a common General Infidelity\nFactor (=.79), reflecting the overall reaction to either form of infidelity, by averaging the\ntwo-item Sexual Infidelity and the two-item Emotional Infidelity scales (see above).\nForced Choice Items. Participants then selected the most threatening form of\ninfidelity by circling either the A or B choice located immediately below the item. To avoid\nthe use of such dichotomous criterion variables in the analyses, however, we added the two\nforced choice items together (1 = Sexual Infidelity was chosen as worse, 0 = Emotional\nInfidelity was chosen as worse) to create a single three-point scale for the forced choice\nitems ranging from 0 to 2.\nResults\nWe first examined relations among the hypothesized predictors (ME, MV, Sex, and\nME*Sex), the form of infidelity (Sexual or Emotional), and the reported degree of threat\nunder the forced choice conditions.\nThe overall model predicting the most threatening form of infidelity was\nInfidelity (F=8.21, p<.01, =.02). Additionally, men were more threatened by Sexual\nform of infidelity seen as most threatening (F<1). There was a non-significant ME*Sex\ninteraction, with the direction of the effect suggesting that Higher-ME men report more\nWe then analyzed the average of how upset participants reported being over\nGeneral Infidelity on the Likert scales. There were no main effects for Sex or ME\nthat Higher-MV individuals reported being more upset about General Infidelity than\nLower-MV individuals. In addition, there was also a significant ME*Sex interaction\nWe then analyzed how upset participants reported being about Sexual or Emotional\nInfidelity, using the average of the two Sexual Infidelity items and the average of the two\nEmotional Infidelity items, respectively. We statistically controlled for General Infidelity in\nthe first step in each equation to obtain the unique variance associated with each form of\nInfidelity being analyzed (see rationale above). Men reported greater upset over Sexual\nSexual Infidelity items in Likert form. The analysis detected no other differences.\nDiscussion\nThe results of Study 1 confirm that Higher-ME individuals report greater threat to\nSexual Infidelity than do Lower-ME individuals. Higher-ME individuals focus primarily on\nshort-term sexual access to partners rather than long-term commitment to partners; hence,\nSexual Infidelity is most upsetting to them. Conversely, Lower-ME individuals focus on\nlong-term commitments rather than short-term sexual access to partners; hence, Emotional\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nInfidelity is most upsetting to them. This pattern of data replicates familiar findings with\nrespect to sex differences: Men are more threatened by Sexual Infidelity than Emotional\nInfidelity whereas women are more threatened by Emotional Infidelity than Sexual\nInfidelity as determined by forced choice and Likert measures.\nSome evidence supported the prediction that ME interacts with Sex to account for\nwithin-sex variance. Higher-ME men report greater upset by Sexual than Emotional\nInfidelity. These men place great importance on sexual activity and are likely to guard\nmates tightly against possible interlopers, at least in the short-term.\nHigher-MV individuals report more threat over General Infidelity than do Lower-\nMV individuals. This supports the hypothesis that infidelity upsets Higher-MV individuals\nmore than Lower-MV individual because (1) they do not expect infidelity, (2) infidelity\nindicates indicate poor mate choice, and (3) better options were lost (opportunity cost).\nThe Likert-scale items offer some support for the idea that Higher-ME individuals\nare, overall, more jealous than are Lower-ME individuals. It may be that Higher-ME\nindividuals are simply more impulsive and sensitive to infidelity, and are more easily upset\nin general.\nStudy 2 examined relations among our hypothesized predictors (ME, MV, Sex, and\nME*Sex) and specific aversive emotional reactions produced by Sexual or Emotional\ninfidelity scenarios, as well as specific intentions to behave punitively toward an unfaithful\npartner.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nOne hundred and thirty-two students participated in a study on, \"Relationships and\nPerson Differences\" in exchange for course credit. The data from five participants were\nomitted from the analysis because of missing data, leaving a total of 127 (88 women, 42\nmen). The procedures were identical to those used in Study 1.\nProcedures and Measures\nMating Effort and Mate Value. We used ME, MV, Sex, and ME*Sex to predict the\naversive emotional and punitive reactions participants report in response to Sexual or\nEmotional Infidelity. The MES (=.70) and MVI (=.77) demonstrated good internal\nconsistency reliability.\nJealousy Manipulation. Participants read two scenarios (order counterbalanced) of\nSexual and Emotional Infidelity (see below):\nSexual Infidelity:\nPlease think of a serious committed romantic relationship that you have had in the\npast, or that you currently have. Imagine that you discover that the person with\nwhom you've been seriously involved became interested in someone else...you also\ndiscover that your partner is enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with that other\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nperson but has no romantic feelings for this person. Please answer the following\nquestions with respect to how you would feel and react.\nEmotional Infidelity:\nPlease think of a serious committed romantic relationship that you have had in the\npast, or that you currently have. Imagine that you discover that the person with\nwhom you've been seriously involved became interested in someone else...you also\ndiscover that your partner has fallen in love with that other person but isn't having\nany sexual contact with them. Please answer the following questions with respect to\nhow you would feel and react.\nParticipants then completed a questionnaire assessing aversive emotions and\npunitive reactions to each scenario.\nAversive Emotional Reactions. The questionnaire assessing aversive emotions asked\nparticipants how much they agreed with the following: I would feel Enraged, Disgusted,\nInsecure, Inadequate, Frightened or Scared, Disappointed, Lonely, Sad, or Depressed. The\nquestionnaire assessing aversive emotional reactions demonstrated good internal reliability\nfor both the Sexual Infidelity (=.78) and Emotional Infidelity (=.80).\nPunitive Intentions. Participants were then asked how likely they would be to\nperform a series of punitive behaviors towards their partner such as: I would scream at\nthem, I would slap them, I would break up with them, I would start seeing someone else.\nAll items were rated on a scale of -3 = strongly disagree to +3 = strongly agree. The\nquestionnaire assessing punitive intentions demonstrated good internal reliability for both\nthe Sexual Infidelity (=.85) and Emotional Infidelity (=.83) scenarios.\nGeneral Infidelity Factors. Due to the high positive correlation between the data\nobtained from the questionnaires assessing aversive emotional reactions to Sexual and\nEmotional Infidelity (r=.62, p<.01), we averaged the two sets of data in an attempt to\nmeasure aversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity (=.76) (see above). Because a\nsimilarly high correlation existed between the data obtained from the two questionnaires\nassessing intended punitive reactions to both infidelity scenarios (r=.72, p<.01), we\naveraged those data to measure punitive intentions to General Infidelity (=.83).\nHierarchical Analyses. Aversive emotional reactions and punitive intentions for\nboth Sexual and Emotional Infidelity were correlated with each other. We therefore suggest\nthat aversive emotional reactions causally preceded punitive intentions. Aversive emotional\nreactions were estimated directly from the hypothesized predictors (i.e., ME, MV, Sex,\nME*Sex); punitive intentions were estimated first from the corresponding aversive\nemotional reactions (both General and specific to Sexual Infidelity scenarios) and then\nfrom the hypothesized predictors (i.e., ME, MV, Sex, ME*Sex).\nResults\nWe first tested the relations among our hypothesized predictors (ME, MV, Sex, and\nME*Sex) and participants' aversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity; we found no\nrelations among the predictor variables and aversive emotional reactions specific to Sexual\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nInfidelity, statistically controlling for aversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity.\np<.01), only aversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity predicted aversive\nemotional reactions to Sexual Infidelity (see Table 1 for all F values, p values, and \nweights). Hence, none of the model predictors uniquely relate to aversive emotional\nreactions to Sexual Infidelity.\nTable 1. Predictors of Aversive Emotional Reactions to General Infidelity and Sexual Infidelity.\n________________________________________________________________________\nAversive Emotions: Aversive Emotions:\nGeneral Infidelity Sexual Infidelity\n________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________\nNote: Significant findings are in bold. EMOG=Aversive Emotional Reactions to General Infidelity.\nWe then examined the relations among the predictor variables and intended punitive\nreactions to Sexual Infidelity, controlling for aversive emotional reactions to General\nInfidelity, since emotions logically precede intentions. The overall model was significant\npredicted intended punitive reactions to General Infidelity. In addition, ME significantly\nand positively predicted intended punitive reactions to General Infidelity (see Table 2 for\nall F values, p values, and  weights). Thus, individuals who report greater aversive\nemotional reactions to General Infidelity are more likely to report punitive intentions in\nresponse to General Infidelity.\nTable 2. Predictors of how likely participants reported being to engage in Punitive Behaviors in response to\nGeneral Infidelity and Sexual Infidelity.\n________________________________________________________________________\nPunitive Intentions: Punitive Intentions:\nGeneral Infidelity Sexual Infidelity\n________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________\nNote: Significant findings are in bold. EMOG=Aversive Emotional Reactions to General Infidelity,\nEMOS=Aversive Emotional Reactions to Sexual Infidelity, INTG=Punitive Intentions for General Infidelity.\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nAfter controlling for aversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity, however,\nwe found that Higher-ME individuals also report a high likelihood of engaging in punitive\nbehaviors in response to General Infidelity. In addition, a significant main effect for sex\nindicated that women were more likely report an intention to administer punitive behaviors\nin response to General Infidelity.\nWe then tested the individual effects of the predictor variables on behavioral\nreactions specific to Sexual Infidelity, statistically controlling for aversive emotional\nreactions to General Infidelity, aversive emotional reactions to Sexual Infidelity, and\npunitive reactions to General Infidelity. The model examining punitive reactions to Sexual\nemotional reactions both to General Infidelity and specifically to Sexual Infidelity, along\nwith punitive reactions to General Infidelity, significantly predicted punitive reactions to\nSexual Infidelity. In addition, after statistically controlling for these variables, a significant\nmain effect for MV emerged: Higher-MV individuals reported being less likely to behave\nin punitive ways in response to Sexual Infidelity.\nDiscussion\nStudy 2 lent further support to the hypothesis that ME predicts an individual's\nreaction to Infidelity. Overall, Higher-ME individuals reported a greater likelihood of\nresponding to General Infidelity with punitive behaviors toward their partner than did\nLower-ME individuals. Hence, ME relates not only to attitudes towards infidelity, but also\nto an individual's reaction to General Infidelity.\nThese data do not support the hypothesis that men and women differ in specific\naversive emotional reactions towards infidelity or in their reactions to Sexual Infidelity. As\npredicted, Higher-MV individuals reported a lesser likelihood of responding to Sexual\nInfidelity with punitive behaviors than did Lower-MV individuals. This result is consistent\nwith the idea that Higher-MV individuals react less to Sexual Infidelity than do Lower-MV\nindividuals. One explanation for this finding relies on the notion that Higher-MV\nindividuals have greater access to partners than do Lower-MV individuals. Lower-MV\nindividuals may be more motivated to guard their mates against Sexual Infidelity to deter\ninfidelity in the short term, even if it comes at a cost to the relationship in the long-term.\nStudy 3 used the same set of hypothesized predictors (ME, MV, Sex, and ME*Sex)\nto examine relations among reports of (1) how tempted participants are to respond to\ninfidelity punitively and (2) how likely participants are to respond to infidelity punitively.\nWe also asked participants to rate how strongly they would feel specific emotions in\nresponse to infidelity, with an aversive emotion on one side and a near opposite emotion on\nthe other side of a graded continuum.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nOne hundred, thirty-two individuals participated in a study on \"Relationships and\nPerson Differences\" in exchange for course credit. Data from eight participants were\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nexcluded from the analysis due to missing data, leaving a total of 124 participants (92\nwomen, 32 men). The procedures were the same as Studies 1 and 2.\nDesign and measures\nMating Effort and Mate Value. The MES (=.73) and MVI (=.75) demonstrated\ngood internal consistency reliability.\nJealousy Manipulation. After filling out the MES and MVI, participants read the\nscenarios used in Study 2 (counterbalanced).\nAversive Emotional Reactions. After reading each scenario, participants rated how\nthey reacted to each form of infidelity using a scale that permitted a report on a continuum\nof -4 (completely feeling the emotion to the left) or +4 (completely feeling the emotion to\nthe right). For example, for the first item, the scale was as follows: -4 = completely jealous,\n+4 = completely fine. The items were: Jealous/fine, upset/relaxed, distress/calm, rage/calm,\nsadness or depression/happy, disgust/turned on, insecure/secure, fear/relieved,\ndisappointed/impressed, inadequate/adequate, and concerned/carefree. The ratings of the\nitems were averaged for each infidelity scenario to create an aversive emotions scale\nreacting to both Sexual Infidelity (=.85) and Emotional Infidelity (=.83). Both\ndemonstrated good internal consistency reliability.\nPunitive Impulses. Participants were then given a questionnaire asking how tempted\nthey would be to perform a series of punitive behaviors (-4 = not at all, +4 = completely)\n(e.g., I would scream at them, I would slap them, I would break up with them, I would start\nseeing someone else). Participants completed this questionnaire in response to both Sexual\nInfidelity (=.90) and Emotional Infidelity scenarios (=.87). Both scales demonstrated\ngood internal consistency reliabilities.\nPunitive Intentions. Directly beneath the how tempted items, participants were\nasked how likely they would be to perform that same punitive behavior (-4 = not at all, +4 =\ncompletely). Participants completed this questionnaire in response to both Sexual Infidelity\n(=.85) and Emotional Infidelity scenarios (=.82). Both scales demonstrated good\ninternal consistency reliabilities.\nGeneral Infidelity Factors. Because the two aversive emotional reaction scales were\nhighly correlated (r=.68, p<.0001), we created an overall scale of aversive emotions in\nresponse to General Infidelity. To do this, the aversive emotions scales for both Sexual and\nEmotional Infidelity were averaged. The resultant scale demonstrated good internal\nconsistency reliability (=.81). In addition, the scales assessing how tempted participants\nwould be to engage in punitive behaviors in response to Sexual or Emotional Infidelity\nwere highly correlated (r=.67, p<.0001), as were the scales assessing how likely\nparticipants would be to engage in punitive behaviors in response to Sexual or Emotional\nInfidelity (r=.74, p<.0001). Thus, the scales responding to how tempted and how likely they\nwould be to engage in punitive behaviors in response to both Sexual and Emotional\nInfidelity were averaged to create overall scales of how tempted and how likely participants\nreported they would be to engage in the list of punitive behaviors in response to General\nInfidelity (=.80 for how tempted; =.87 for how likely).\nThe Hierarchical Cascade. Finally, aversive emotional reactions, punitive\nimpulses, and punitive intentions correlated with one another. We therefore assumed that\naversive emotional reactions causally preceded punitive impulses and that punitive\nimpulses causally preceded punitive intentions. We estimated aversive emotional reactions\ndirectly from the hypothesized predictors (i.e., ME, MV, Sex, ME*Sex). We estimated\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\npunitive impulses first from the corresponding aversive emotional reactions (both General\nand unique to Sexual Infidelity scenarios) and then from the hypothesized predictors (i.e.,\nME, MV, Sex, ME*Sex). We estimated punitive intentions first from the corresponding\npunitive impulses (both General and unique to Sexual Infidelity scenarios), then from the\ncorresponding aversive emotional reactions (both General and unique to Sexual Infidelity\nscenarios), and finally from the hypothesized predictors (i.e., ME, MV, Sex, ME*Sex).\nResults\nWe first tested the relations among our hypothesized predictors (ME, MV, Sex, and\nME*Sex) and participants' reported aversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity. The\naversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity; women reported more aversive emotions\nthan men (see Table 3 for all F values, p values, and  weights). We then tested the\nindividual predictor variables on emotional reactions specific to Sexual Infidelity,\nstatistically controlling for aversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity. The model\nemotional reactions to General Infidelity predicted aversive emotional reactions to Sexual\nInfidelity (see Table 3 for all F values, p values, and  weights). No other predictors were\nstatistically significant.\nTable 3. Predictors of Aversive Emotional Reactions to General Infidelity and Sexual Infidelity.\n________________________________________________________________________\nAversive Emotions: Aversive Emotions:\nGeneral Infidelity Sexual Infidelity\n________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________\nNote: Significant findings are in bold. EMOG=Aversive Emotional Reactions to General Infidelity.\nWe then tested the individual relations among the predictor variables and how\ntempted to engage in punitive behaviors participants reported being in response to General\nInfidelity and specifically to Sexual Infidelity. In both cases, we statistically controlled for\naversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity. When examining impulses to engage in\npunitive behaviors specifically in response to Sexual Infidelity, we also controlled for\naversive emotional reactions specifically to Sexual Infidelity.\nThe model predicting impulses to engage in punitive behaviors in response to\nvalues, p values, and  weights). Regarding aversive emotional reactions and punitive\nimpulses in response to General Infidelity, aversive emotions predicted impulses to engage\nin punitive behaviors, such that individuals who reported more aversive emotions reported\na greater impulse to engage in punitive behaviors. After controlling for aversive emotional\nreactions to General Infidelity, a significant main effect emerged for ME indicating that\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nHigher-ME individuals reported more impulses to engage in punitive behaviors in response\nto General Infidelity than did Lower-ME individuals. In addition, significant main effects\nfor Sex and MV emerged. Women reported a greater impulse to engage in punitive\nbehaviors in response to General Infidelity than did men. Higher-MV individuals reported\nlesser impulse to engage in punitive behaviors in response to General Infidelity than did\nLower-MV individuals.\nTable 4. Predictors of how tempted participants reported being to engage in Punitive Behaviors in response to\nGeneral Infidelity and Sexual Infidelity.\n________________________________________________________________________\nPunitive Impulses: Punitive Impulses:\nGeneral Infidelity Sexual Infidelity\n________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________\nNote: Significant findings are in bold. EMOG=Aversive Emotional Reactions to General Infidelity,\nEMOS=Aversive Emotional Reactions to Sexual Infidelity, IMPG=Impulses to engage in Punitive Behaviors\nin response to General Infidelity.\nThe model examining impulses to engage in punitive behaviors in response to\nin response to General Infidelity and to Sexual Infidelity and impulses to engage in punitive\nreactions to General Infidelity significantly predicted impulses to engage in punitive\nreactions in response to Sexual Infidelity. No other relations were significant.\nThus, aversive emotional reactions specific to Sexual Infidelity predicted impulses\nto engage in punitive reactions in response to that infidelity. This effect accounted for\nvariance above and beyond aversive emotional reactions to General Infidelity, which\nsuggests that although emotions experienced during Emotional Infidelity and Sexual\nInfidelity are highly correlated, specific infidelity may elicit specific emotions which\nmotivate an individual to act in certain ways in response to that infidelity.\nWe then tested the individual relations among the predictor variables on how likely\nparticipants reported they would be to engage in punitive behaviors in response to General\nInfidelity and specifically to Sexual Infidelity. In both cases, we statistically controlled for\naversive emotions in response to General Infidelity as well as for impulses to engage in\npunitive behaviors in response to General Infidelity. When dealing with punitive intentions\nrelated to Sexual Infidelity, we also controlled for aversive emotions as well as for the\nimpulses to engage in punitive behaviors in response to Sexual Infidelity.\nThe model predicting how likely participants reported they would engage in\npunitive behaviors in response to General Infidelity was significant (R2=.62,\nemotions in response to General Infidelity, and impulses to engage in punitive behaviors in\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nresponse to General Infidelity both significantly predicted the report of how likely a\nparticipant would be to engage in punitive behaviors in response to General Infidelity.\nAfter controlling for these variables, only a significant effect for ME emerged: Higher-ME\nindividuals reported they would be more likely to engage in punitive behaviors in response\nto General Infidelity.\nTable 5. Predictors of how likely participants reported being to engage in Punitive Behaviors in response to\nGeneral Infidelity and Sexual Infidelity.\n________________________________________________________________________\nPunitive Intentions: Punitive Intentions:\nGeneral Infidelity Sexual Infidelity\n________________________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________________________\nNote: Significant findings are in bold.

No other predictors were\nstatistically significant.\nDiscussion\nResults of Study 3 indicate that Higher-ME individuals report being both more\ntempted and more likely to engage in punitive behaviors in response to General Infidelity.\nWomen reported being more tempted to respond to infidelity more punitively overall, but\ndid not indicate they would be more likely to engage in such behaviors. The results also\nsuggested that how likely participants reported they would be to engage in punitive\nreactions in response to General Infidelity and specifically to Sexual Infidelity were\npredicted first by aversive emotions in reaction to General Infidelity and specifically to\nSexual Infidelity and then by impulses to behave in punitive ways to General Infidelity and\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nspecifically to Sexual Infidelity. This suggests that emotions and impulses to behave in\ncertain ways in response to infidelity scenarios may mediate an individual's final\nbehavioral intentions in response to infidelity. Furthermore, the data support the prediction\nthat Higher-ME individuals are both more tempted and more likely to engage in punitive\nbehaviors in response to General Infidelity than are Lower-ME individuals. This supports\nthe notion that Higher-ME individuals are more motivated (by experiencing higher levels\nof temptation), and more likely to act in ways that will deter infidelity of a partner, even if\nsuch actions are punitive and may pose long-term costs.\nThe aversive emotions participants report in response to infidelity appear to\ninfluence impulses to engage in punitive behaviors in response to General or Sexual\nInfidelity. This suggests that emotions mediate a path to impulses to behave in certain ways\nin response to infidelity. In addition, women, and individuals with lower MV also\nsignificantly reported increased impulse to engage in punitive behaviors in response to\nGeneral Infidelity.\nEarlier, we predicted that Lower-MV individuals would report more impulse to\nengage in punitive behaviors in response to General Infidelity because they may be\nunlikely to keep their romantic partner in the long-term. Moreover, these individuals may\nbenefit from motivations to engage in behaviors that deter infidelity, even if such behaviors\npose long-term costs to the relationship (Figueredo and McCloskey, 1993). We did not,\nhowever, predict the tendency for women to report higher levels of impulse to engage in\npunitive behaviors in response to General Infidelity. Women were more likely to report\naversive emotional responses to General Infidelity. We should interpret this finding with\ncaution, however, considering a lack of similar significant findings in Study 2.\nAs in Study 2, aversive emotional responses to General Infidelity predicted aversive\nemotional responses to Sexual Infidelity. These findings are similar to those predicting\ntemptation and likelihood of engaging in punitive behaviors in response to General\nInfidelity and to those predicting temptation and likelihood of engaging in punitive\nbehaviors in response to Sexual Infidelity. Thus, emotions, impulses, and intentions specific\nto either emotional or Sexual Infidelity seem to be similar regardless of the type of\ninfidelity in question. Interestingly, however, emotions and impulses specific to a type of\ninfidelity contribute unique variance to predicting reports of likelihood of engaging in\npunitive behaviors. Thus, although aversive emotions and punitive impulses cluster and are\nsimilar, it seems as if there are some notable differences in how aversive emotions lead to\nspecific impulses, and in which impulses ultimately lead to specific punitive intentions.\nGeneral Discussion\nReproductive strategy appears to be a crucial determinant of both affective and\nbehavioral reactions to infidelity. As predicted, Higher-ME individuals are not only more\nlikely to be threatened by Sexual Infidelity, they also report a higher likelihood of\nresponding to General Infidelity with punitive behaviors.\nMen and individuals higher in ME reported being more upset by Sexual Infidelity\nthan women or individuals lower in ME. When examined using proper statistical\nprocedures, these findings were consistent for both forced choice and Likert items. Thus, it\nappears that because of the focus Higher-ME individuals place on the short-term aspects of\nrelationships, they are differentially upset by thoughts of Sexual Infidelity. Further,\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nHigher-ME individuals are also more likely to respond in punitive ways to General\nInfidelity. This also reflects the predicted notion that Higher-ME individuals are more\nlikely to think in terms of stopping the infidelity immediately with little to no regard of the\nfuture consequences on the relationship.\nME influences the self-reported temptation to and the likelihood of behaving in\npunitive ways in response to General Infidelity. This indicates that Higher-ME individuals\nreport greater motivation to act in ways that support short-term infidelity deterrence, and\nalso report being more likely to act upon that motivation. The present results, however, did\nnot support the hypotheses that Higher-ME individuals are more likely to engage in\npunitive behaviors in response to Sexual as opposed to Emotional Infidelity. Sexual and\nEmotional infidelities were highly correlated in all studies. Hence, we statistically\ncontrolled for and examined a common jealousy factor before we examined the specific\nrelations among the predictor variables and either Sexual or Emotional Infidelity. The\nbehavioral response patterns reported by Higher-ME individuals appear to be a reaction to\nGeneral Infidelity, not a reaction to a specific type of infidelity. A reasonable account of\nthis is that, because Sexual and Emotional infidelities often occur in combination,\nindividuals interested in defending short-term interests would have historically based\ntendencies to react in a way that immediately deters any type of infidelity.\nThe present results replicated more familiar sex differences in response to Sexual or\nEmotional Infidelity. Men were more upset by Sexual Infidelity than by Emotional\nInfidelity using both the sum of the forced choice items and Likert scale items assessing\njealousy. Sexual Infidelity threatened Higher-ME individuals more than Lower-ME\nindividuals, regardless of sex. . An individual's ME is a factor which influences the\nreproductive strategy they follow. Such strategies have been used throughout evolutionary\ntime to solve specific adaptive problems in one's socio-ecological environment. Such\nstrategies may have solved problems of how to deal with an unfaithful partner effectively\nand how to keep a partner faithful, regardless of the long-term cost to the relationship. It is\nlikely to have been a strategy that was successful for Higher-ME individuals.\nBecause both men and women vary in their levels of ME, however, it is unlikely\nthat we can honestly attribute these findings to differences in how cultures treat men and\nwomen, or to what men and women learn with respect to relationships or infidelity. For\nexample, certain cultures may teach that it is unacceptable for women to be sexually\nunfaithful, and thus create greater sexual jealousy in men. However, cultural explanations\ncannot explain why such differences would exist between Higher-ME and Lower-ME\nindividuals. Furthermore, although men are generally higher in ME than women, men still\nreported being more threatened by Sexual Infidelity, even after we controlled for\ndifferences in ME.\nWe predicted that Lower-MV individuals would report a greater likelihood of\npunitive behaviors in response to infidelity because Lower-MV individuals need to deter\ninfidelity by resorting to behaviors that are more drastic (and costly). Hence, it may be\nmore beneficial for them to delay infidelity (even if dissolution of the relationship is\nimminent) rather than be a victim of infidelity. Self-described MV, however, did not\nconsistently relate to self-reported jealousy.\nNevertheless, Higher-MV individuals were less likely to engage in punitive\nbehaviors in response to Sexual Infidelity, and thus more likely to report punitive behaviors\nin response to Emotional Infidelity than Lower-MV individuals. We suggest that this is\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nbecause Higher-MV individuals have less trouble finding a new sexual partner to \"even the\nscore\" by being unfaithful themselves (Symons, 1979), or by finding someone else with\nwhom to start a sexual relationship. Higher-MV individuals may, however, be upset at the\nprospect of losing a valuable partner. Another interpretation is that Higher-MV individuals\ndo not have to be as vigilant against Sexual Infidelity because they are very desirable.\nOne reason for the inconsistent findings may relate to the MV differential between\none's partner and one's self. An individual with a lower MV may have the same MV as\ntheir partner and thus may feel secure in the relationship. Another individual of the same\nMV might have a partner who exceeds her or him in MV - setting the stage for insecurity,\nhypersensitivity to infidelity, and the use of more drastic mate-retention tactics.\nNo particular variable predicted aversive emotional reactions to infidelity. There\nwas some indication that women reported more aversive emotions in response to General\nInfidelity, but this did not occur consistently. Aversive emotional reactions did, however,\nstrongly predict self-reported likelihood of specific forms of behavior. Individuals who\nreported more distress about General Infidelity also reported a greater likelihood of\nbehaving punitively in response to General Infidelity. Thus, emotional reactions and ME\nwere independent but strong predictors of behavioral intentions in response to infidelity.\nFurther, emotions elicited by a specific infidelity uniquely predicted the specific punitive\nbehaviors an individual may perform in response to that infidelity. Thus, individuals who\nreported stronger aversive emotions with respect to Sexual Infidelity (after controlling for\nemotions in response to General Infidelity) were more likely report punitive behaviors in\nresponse to Sexual Infidelity specifically.\nWe selected the behaviors we asked about because these actions appear to reduce\nthe cost of infidelity or discourage infidelity in the short term, but also appear likely to\nstrain or harm the relationship in the long term. Contingency traps (generally, decisions\nbetween short-term loss for long-term benefit, or long-term loss for short-term gain) such\nas these may be useful in defining an individual's reproductive strategy, because in some\nenvironments one may maximize reproductive potential in the short-term by using these\nstrategies (Figueredo and McCloskey, 1993). These findings are consistent with what we\nknow about ME in general. Higher-ME individuals tend to behave more coercively and act\nin ways that benefit them in the short-term, with little regard for long-term costs (Rowe et\nThe statistical analysis of the data partially supports our hypothesis that ME\naccounts for the sex-specific variation seen in the threat produced by Sexual or Emotional\nInfidelity. Although there was evidence that reproductive strategy interacts with sex to\nproduce increasing levels of concern over General Infidelity, the two variables had additive\nmain effects on jealousy. After controlling for ME, the effects of respondent sex (being a\nwoman or a man) increased in magnitude. Thus, within-sex variation with respect to ME or\nreproductive strategy may cloud the sex effects that jealousy researchers describe.\nAs importantly, because Sexual and Emotional Infidelity often co-occur and are\ntherefore highly correlated, one must control for General Infidelity (defined as the average\nof Sexual and Emotional Infidelity), before assessing how a specific variable uniquely\nrelates to one form of infidelity or another. In short, one must estimate how the predictor\nvariables affect the General Infidelity factor, created by combining Sexual and Emotional\nInfidelity, before examining any unique effects upon either Sexual or Emotional Infidelity\nalone.\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nWe now offer four cautionary notes. First, because the jealousy manipulations were\nhypothetical, the ecological validity of these results remains unknown. Although self-\ndescribed intentions provide an estimate of how a person will react to infidelity, these\nintentions remain distance from real-world behaviors enacted in response to infidelity. The\nexternal validity of these results remains to be established.\nSecond, all the items in the present scales were punitive and pitted short-term\nbenefit against long-term cost. Theory predicts Higher-ME Individuals to have impulses\nand intentions with respect to these costs and benefits; a different set of costs and benefits,\nhowever, may elicit different responses. Hence, it may be informative to examine the\ngenerality of these findings including behaviors directed towards different goals such as\nfrightening a partner into not cheating, dissolving a relationship, retaining a mate (e.g.,\npulling them away from the interloper, back into the relationship), or working things out. It\nmay be that Higher-ME individuals are less likely to work things out than others because\nthey think within short-term time frames; it may be that Lower-ME individuals are less\nlikely than others to dissolve a relationship because of their use of long-term time frames\nand the resultant greater levels of commitment to the relationship (Figueredo et al., 2006).\nThird, a full predictive model makes it necessary to examine the MV of a\nparticipant's partner relative to the MV of the participant because, theoretically, MV in\nrelation to that of the partner will predict degree of vigilance to infidelity. Lower-MV in\nrelation to one's partner places a premium on efforts to protect against Emotional as\nopposed to Sexual Infidelity because investment in a relatively Higher-MV partner may be\nworth the risk of extra partner affairs, as long as several offspring are produced with the\nhigher quality partner. In contrast, being with a relatively Lower-MV partner increases\nvigilance over Sexual Infidelity because the individual may be sacrificing other desirable\nqualities in a mate for the knowledge that all the offspring one invests in are one's own.\nFourth, given current methods, measuring real-world responses to infidelity is\nimpractical and unethical. Thus, measuring intentions to imagined scenarios is as close as\nwe could come to measuring responses to infidelity. Responses to infidelity may be\nequivocal in their consequences; some may perform the same behavior with different\ndesired outcomes for the relationship. We selected the behavioral intentions used in this\nstudy because of their clear purpose of deterring infidelity and being punitive in nature.\nGiven these caveats, the results reported here support the notion that reproductive\nstrategies and reactions to infidelity relate strongly. Higher-ME individuals report greater\nupset to Sexual Infidelity, and a greater likelihood of behaving punitively towards their\npartner or their relationship in response to infidelity than do Lower-ME individuals. The\nresults are robust and replicated consistently.\nFinally, the fine-grained distinctions among aversive emotional reactions, punitive\nimpulses, and punitive intentions that are the sequelae of infidelity provide grounds to\nsuggest that different causal forces are at work at different levels of this hierarchical\ncascade of consequences. How threatening Sexual or Emotional Infidelity is to someone\ndepends on an individual's sex and ME; the degree of threat also depends on the person's\nME, aversive emotional responses, and punitive impulses. Taken together these factors\n(and perhaps more, yet unidentified factors) are collectively responsible for punitive\nbehavioral intentions towards a potentially unfaithful partner.\nIn summary, these studies document five major findings. First, using traditional\nforced-choice methods, we replicated the well-established sex difference in reaction to\nReproductive strategies and jealousy\nSexual and Emotional Infidelity. Using graded Likert-scales we also replicated the\npreviously reported disappearances of such sex differences. Second, because these sex\ndifferences have been interpreted by previous researchers to be little more than proxies for\ndiffering sexual strategies, we also obtained additional results of theoretical interest using\ntwo strategically-relevant predictors, ME and MV, and several different outcomes measures\nof our own devising. Neither ME nor MV significantly predicted aversive emotional\nreactions, however. We interpret this result as an indication that the previously self-\nreported \"upset\" attitudes are insufficiently discriminative of different sexual strategies.\nNevertheless, with aversive emotional reactions controlled, individuals higher in ME and\nlower in MV were generally more likely to report punitive impulses towards an unfaithful\npartner, regardless of the type of infidelity. Furthermore, with aversive emotional reactions\nand punitive impulses controlled, individuals higher in ME were generally more likely to\nreport punitive intentions towards an unfaithful partner, regardless of the type of infidelity.\nThird, the high collinearity between Sexual and Emotional Infidelity should be\nconsidered when assessing specific effects. Because a single General Infidelity Factor can\nbe constructed to capture the common variance, effects upon specific Sexual or Emotional\nInfidelity Factors should be statistically controlled for effects upon the General Factor\nwhen testing more specialized hypotheses. Fourth, most statistically significant effects of\nME, MV, and Sex were directly upon the General Infidelity Factor and only indirectly on\nSexual (or Emotional) Infidelity. Finally and also importantly, it appears that aversive\nemotional reactions lead to punitive impulses, punitive impulses lead to punitive intentions,\nand it is punitive intentions that presumably lead to real-world punitive behaviors. More\nresearch will be required to document this last conclusion.\nReferences\nAjzen, I. (1985). From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior. In J.
