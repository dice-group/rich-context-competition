The study focused on how the high school proceeded from its initial concept, moving to a small school program,\nand emerging as a new small high school. Data collection included interviews, observations, and document review to develop\na case study of one small high school sharing a multiplex building. The first key finding, \"Too Many Pieces, Not Enough\nGlue,\" revealed that the school had too many new programs starting at once and they lacked a clear understanding of\ntheir concept and vision for their new small school, training on the Montessori philosophies, teaching and learning in small\nschools, and how to operate within a teacher-cooperative model. The second key finding, \"A Continuous Struggle,\" revealed\nthat the shared building space presented problems for teachers and students. District policies remain unchanged, resulting\nin staff and students resorting to activist approaches to get things done. These findings offer small school reform leaders\nsuggestions for developing and sustaining a small school culture and cohesion despite the pressures to revert back to top-\ndown, comprehensive high school norms.\n",

Urban high schools are\nplagued by high drop-out rates, increased violence, low\nachievement levels, low levels of student engagement, and\nnumbers of large public urban districts are seeking more effi-\ncient alternatives to the traditional comprehensive high\nschool.\nIn response to this problem, high schools across the coun-\ntry are focusing on reorganizing into smaller learning com-\nmunities. Research conducted over the past 20 years supports\nthat small schools are better for students academically, and\nthey are safer too (Supovitz & Christman, 2003). This \"small\nis better\" reform movement has concluded that smaller high\nschools have better attendance and performance on reading\nand writing assessments, and higher graduation and college-\ngoing rates, despite serving a more educationally disadvan-\ntaged population of students (Bryk, Easton, Gladden,\nThe Small Schools Movement\nThe small schools movement is described by Meier (2002),\nfounder of one of the first and most successful small schools\nin Harlem, as a cultural rather than an institutional change.\nThe small schools movement is about relationships and cre-\nating a culture in which students, teachers, families, and\ncommunity members are known to each other (Klonsky,\nThe large, factory model school has its own kind of culture.

The literature has begun to inform educational\nreformers the ways in which they can take advantage of the\nsmallness of their own schools. Copeland and Boatright's\n(2004) research suggests that small schools offer the oppor-\ntunity for leadership practices to emerge that strengthen\ninterpersonal relationships between adults and students, and\nbuild professional communities that are focused on the\nimprovement of teaching and learning for everyone. Reports\nfrom the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation examine issues\nof initiating and maintaining successful small school reform,\nand ways to identify barriers to sustaining thriving small\nschools (Hendrie, 2004). One of the key barriers mentioned\nis finding enough principals and teachers who truly under-\nstand the complex features of successful small schools:\n\"Many small schools are struggling to put into place strong\ncurricula and instructional practices, in part because their\ndetracted classrooms include students of widely varying skill\nlevels\" (p. 30). The article also discusses the difficulty in\nrenovating large buildings at a \"time of overcrowding and\ntight budgets\" which \"pose other serious roadblocks\" (p. 30).\nDarling-Hammond (1997) commented, \"There's a big debate\nin the reform community on whether it's even worth the\neffort to try to convert large high schools as they are, or\nwhether only useful strategy is to go to new, small, com-\npletely autonomous schools\" (p. 31). Currently, there is little\nresearch available that supports either approach as better\nthan the other.\nThe positive effects of small schools are attributed to the\nfact that small schools foster school communities that focus\nAlthough individual factors related to school effectiveness\nhave been explored, little is known about the evolution of\nsmall schools--how organizational and leadership change is\nexperienced in the newly configured small high schools.\nInsights into a relatively new phenomenon of such complex-\nity can best be acquired through in-depth investigation of a\nparticular site through an analysis of these relationships as\npart of a sustained inquiry.\nThis study attempted to contribute to the knowledge base\nby exploring and analyzing the evolution of an urban small\nhigh school in its 3rd year of reform in a large multiplex.\nThis ethnographic case study reports on issues of organiza-\ntional change through focused attention on the altered roles\nof the teachers and administrators, as well as their relation-\nships with each other and with the central administration\noffice. Moreover, this study describes the complexity of\nshared spaces within a multiplex structure and discusses the\nrepercussions this arrangement has on its students and school\nleaders within this large midwestern school district.\nTheoretical Framework\nRestructuring a large high school into a smaller learning\ncommunity is a challenging process. Schools undergo this\ntransformation because their current structure is failing.\nHowever, creating successful small high schools needs more\nthan just small numbers of students (Cotton, 1996; Howley\ncurriculums, and alternate assessments are a few of the com-\nWasley et al., 2000). Although these components are more\neasily achieved in smaller schools, they are not an automatic\nresult of a smaller school and must be worked for instead.\nFine's (2005) research suggests that dividing large schools\ninto smaller units is a step in the right direction, but simply\ndividing or \"fracturing\" current structures would not ensure\nsuccess. Newly created small high schools must be supported\nby districts, states, and local communities or they will have\nschools movement was meant to reclaim the public sphere\nand reinvigorate public education with a commitment that\nwould inspire, spread to, and support other schools (Darling-\nsmall schools movement clear is vital to its success.\nBased on the Bank Street research project in Chicago,\nFine (2005) contended that small schools were established to\nprovide students:\nAccess, participation and democracy: Educators craft\nelaborate plans for curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment to\nnurture the minds and souls of youth. They build democratic\nparticipation into the fabric of schools and communities.\nCommitments to equity: While small schools vary in theme,\norigin, and structure, at their best they are designed to encourage\nsustained, critical inquiry among heterogeneous groups of youth\nwho are being educated toward college.\nSophisticated systems of assessment that support better\nteaching and learning: The small schools movement has\nhistorically resisted high-stakes tests and externally generated\nassessments as fundamentally anti-intellectual.\nSchools for social justice and social responsibility: Defining\nschools as public institutions with deep social responsibilities\nfor intellectual, economic, and civic well-being, many in the\nsmall schools movement originally conceived the schools as a\nmovement for educational justice. (pp. 12-14)\nThese ideas emphasize the original intent of small schools\nand these findings foreshadow the focus of this research\nproject, providing the conceptual orientation of the proposed\nstudy. These concepts have provided a framing lens through\nwhich to better understand the phenomena of small school\nreform. The following section describes the methods and\ndata collection for the study.\nMethods and Data Collection\nThis yearlong ethnographic case study conducted in 2009\nmarked an attempt to explore how one urban high school, a\nnew small high school housed in a multiplex, evolved from a\nconcept, to a program, and finally to a new small high school.\nThis case study design used qualitative strategies of data col-\nlection. Field data were collected through school site obser-\nvations, document analysis, and 25 individual interviews.\nThe researcher observed general leadership meetings with all\nstaff members, department team meetings with teachers,\nadministrator meetings with parents on discipline issues, and\ngeneral staff development sessions. The researcher inter-\nviewed administrators and teachers, as well as observing stu-\ndents, classrooms, hallways, principal or other school\nleader's offices, the cafeteria, and other events.\nData were managed and organized through the use of\nNVivo, a qualitative research software program. NVivo sup-\nports the ways in which researchers work with their data. The\ncomputer's capacity for recording, sorting, matching, and\nlinking can be directed by the researchers to assist in answer-\ning their research questions from the data, without losing\naccess to the source data, or the original context of the data.\nThe researchers produced node reports and conducted rela-\ntional mapping through intersection and union of identified\nnodes relative to the research questions.\nData Analysis\nThe analysis followed generally accepted forms of qualita-\ntive inquiry and relied on the research questions to guide the\ndata collection, analysis, and reporting of the ethnographic\ncase study findings. Data analysis was an ongoing, continu-\nous process in this qualitative study. According to Merriam\n(2009), \"Making sense out of the data involves consolidat-\ning, reducing, and interpreting what people have said and\nwhat the researcher has seen and read--it is the process of\nbegan simultaneously with data collection. The researcher\nreflected on observations, analytic memos, field notes, and\ninterview data independently. Patterns were identified and\ninitial codes were determined after multiply readings. By\nexamining the complexity of these different categories, the\nresearcher began to see an emerging picture of how an urban\nhigh school experienced its evolution. More specifically,\nseveral internal and external factors emerged that affected\nthe school's development.\nThis study addressed two overarching questions:\n1. In what ways have the original ideas behind this new\nsmall high school in an urban setting evolved and\ntaken shape from its initial concept, to a program, to\na new small high school?\n2. In what ways, if any, have the internal (leadership,\nbuilding space, curriculum, and school identity) or\nexternal factors (funding, local or state support, and\nparent support) of this school affected its evolution?\nThe following section provides the context for the research\nstudy.\nContext of the Study\nThe United States has been entrenched in cycles of school\nreform for more than 100 years. In Grassmore1 the most\nrecent wave of large-scale high school reform, called\nWeston's2 High School Redesign Initiative, was imple-\nmented in the fall of 2003, with a grant from the Bill and\nThe grant outlined a 5-year plan to redesign Weston's large\ncomprehensive public high schools by developing small\nautonomous high schools throughout the city, with the goal\nof helping students graduate from high school prepared for\ncollege and the workforce, and ready to be productive and\ncontributing members of society.\nWeston's High School Redesign Initiative suggested that\nnew small high schools should be in their own building or\nshare space in a multiplex (an old large high school housing\n4 SAGE Open\nthree or more separate schools). New small high schools\nshould be autonomous with a specific mission and specific\nobjectives for success. The goal in Weston was to have\nschools throughout the area offer parents and students choice\nin approaches to curriculum, teaching methodology, and\nclassroom structures. In addition, there would be schools that\nkeep at-risk students from disengaging from the learning\nprocess by offering counseling, personal attention, and sup-\nport in addition to an innovative curriculum.\nFederal accountability standards driven by the No Child\nLeft Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) demand that systematic\nchange occur in secondary education around the country.\nWeston's comprehensive high schools have been identified\nas schools in need of improvement and are therefore subject\nto rigorous federal sanctions that could lead to school recon-\nstitution. Due to the grim statistics facing them, leaders\nthroughout Weston have mobilized efforts to address the\nchallenges of NCLB and the need to improve high school\nattendance, performance, and graduation rates by imple-\nmenting a small high school design. It is estimated that\n15,000 students were affected by this comprehensive reform\nPublic School (WPS) system, 7,000 students were served in\nmultiplex facilities located in reconfigured large WPS high\nschools and 6,000 students in 30 or more newly created small\nschools. According to a report issued by the National\nAssessment of Education Progress, a testing program of the\nfederal government often called The Nations' Report Card,\nWeston had the most dramatic negative results regarding the\nachievement gap figures (Borsuk, 2008). These figures sug-\ngested that other larger issues than education are affecting\nthe lives of African Americans in Weston. The report sug-\ngested that rising poverty, loss of blue-collar jobs, high rates\nof single-parent households, increased numbers of teen\nbirths, and severe crime are a few issues affecting African\nAmerican students and the Weston community at large.\nUndeniably, action needed to be taken given the state sta-\ntistics on school performance in Grassmore. On average,\n43.1% of students graduate from an urban high school in\nGrassmore compared with the U.S. national average of 70%\n(Toppo, 2006). The statistics in Weston, the city in which this\nstudy is focused, are even more staggering as there is a large\ndisparity between the inner-city schools and their surround-\ning suburbs. In Weston, 82.5% of students graduate from\nsuburban schools while only 54.5% graduate from urban\n10th-largest among cities in the United States.\nWPS District\nAt the time of the study in 2009, WPS District was the\nlargest school district in its midwestern state and is the\n27th largest school district in the country. It served more\nreduced lunch, the measure used to indicate student pov-\nerty, which has grown from 69% a decade ago (Borsuk,\n2007). The number of students with disabilities has\nIn WPS, 90% of high school\u00adage students attend 15 large\ncomprehensive high schools with an average enrollment of\nmore than 1,300 students. Student proficiency and gradua-\ntion rates in these schools are extremely low. One of every\nfour WPS high school students fails to pass enough courses\nand earn enough credits to move to the next grade level the\nfollowing year. One of every three freshmen fails to advance\nto sophomore status the next year. The average high school\nmobility rates are also high with nearly one of every three\nhigh school students changing schools every year. On aver-\nage, students who dropped out of WPS have attended four\nhigh schools before leaving the system. Over the past several\nyears, the average grade point average (GPA) for high school\nstudents was 1.8 (D+) and one third of the students failed all\nwere 65%, and the suspension rate for high school students\nwas 41% (Borsuk, 2007). The small school strategy is clearly\nan important one in Weston; currently, 18% of the high\nschool graduates come from small high schools, even though\nthese schools enroll only 10% of the WPS high school stu-\ndent population and represent 4% of the WPS high school\nbudget.\napproximately 75 new proposals for 30 new schools set to\nopen in the fall of 2006. The goal was to plan and create\nWPS students by converting at least 7 large schools into mul-\nstudents or less) serving 6,000 students. The school focused\non for this study, Summit High School, is one of the new\nsmall schools mentioned above, and it opened in August\n2006, joining three other new small high schools in a multi-\nplex building.\nFindings\nThe research project on small high school reform has pro-\nduced several distinct findings that are organized here under\ntwo broader dilemmas of practice in contemporary urban\nschooling:\n1. Key finding--Too many pieces, not enough glue:\nSummit High School did not have a successful evolu-\ntion from vision to reality. Its founders had too many\nnew initiatives starting at once. They lacked a clear\nunderstanding of the concept and vision for their new\nsmall school. Staff lacked training on the curriculum\nphilosophies, teaching and learning in small schools,\nand operating within a teacher-cooperative model.\n2. Key Finding--A continuous struggle: Internal and\nexternal factors hindered the development of Summit\nHigh School. The shared building space presented\nmany problems for the teachers and students at\nSummit High School. District policies remain\nunchanged, resulting in staff and students resorting to\nactivist approaches to get things done for their school.\nIn the sections that follow, the findings are discussed with\nan attention to this backdrop and the articulated dilemmas\npresent in an urban high school setting.\nKey Finding: Too Many Pieces, Not Enough Glue\nSchool Concept.The practice of a shared concept involves\ndeveloping \"pictures of the future\" that foster genuine com-\nmitment and enrollment rather than compliance (Senge,\nwill never work, rather people will excel and learn when they\nwant to. The original founders of Summit High School,3\nCathy, Dave, and Barb, had good intentions when they began\nplanning their new small school. Their vision and mission\nstatement was clearly defined on paper, but they had trouble\nfiguring out how to make it a reality within the school\nbuilding.\nWhen Summit High School first opened in 2005, the staff\nwas faced with multiple challenges and spent many hours\njust trying to get things done. None of the teachers had been\nprincipals, received any formal leadership training, or had\nthe equivalent administrative licenses. Understanding how to\nenroll students, deal with district policies, and handle bud-\ngets was all new to this staff. Quite frankly, the staff, a group\nof teachers who cared about their school and were trying to\nmake it work, was overworked and overwhelmed.\nSummit High School's initial small school proposal\ndescribed the advantages of combining two unique curricu-\nlumphilosophies,MontessoriandInternationalBaccalaureate\n(IB), stating that the rigor of the IB program coupled with\nMontessori's concept of creating a lifelong love of learning\nwas a unique mix that would enhance academic achieve-\nment, increase family involvement, and develop character\n(school document, January 2, 2003). Montessori is a unique\ncurriculum with specific features that teachers need to be\nsufficiently trained so that they can incorporate these princi-\nples into their own teaching and learning practices. Even\nthough Summit provided a few initial professional develop-\nment sessions centered on Montessori philosophies, these\nfew hours of seminar sessions were not enough to assist\nteachers in incorporating these philosophies into their\ncurriculum.\nMoreover, the lack of clarity around the school concept\nwas evident during the planning stages of Summit High\nSchool, and even through the early years of the school's exis-\ntence. This contributed to the school remaining stagnant.\nMany staff did not know if they would be required to go to\nMontessori training over the summer, which would be a\n6-week commitment out-of-state. Barb knew how difficult it\nwould be to recruit teachers, and then tell them that they had\nto attend out-of-state training, so she continued to tell new\nhires that the training was \"optional.\" Many teachers who\ndid not want to continue in the Montessori philosophy or\nattend the training left the school, which resulted in high\nturnover the first few years.\nIn 2006, Summit High School made another important\ndecision and applied for and received Charter status with\nWPS District. This decision was made to \"trade a higher\nlevel of accountability for a higher level of autonomy\"\n(school document, January 5, 2007). The staff believed that\nchanging the school's status would benefit them in several\nways, including more local control over finances, flexibility\nin scheduling and school calendar, assessment practices that\nmatch the school's vision and mission, and the opportunity to\nsupplement nutritional services with locally grown healthy\nfood.\nAnother reason that Summit High School decided to\napply for Charter status was their leadership model. From the\nbeginning, Summit High School operated as a teacher-\ncooperative model and teachers collectively shared in the\ndecision-making process. However, as a non-Charter school,\nthey were required to maintain a 5% principal appointment,\nand this appointment carried more weight in terms of deci-\nsion making than the school's founders originally realized.\nEssentially, the 5% principal had the authority to overrule or\nchange any decision made by the group. Even though this\nnever did happen, this change would protect the work they\nhad started, and Charter status would allow the group to\nfunction as a recognized, structured teacher-cooperative\nmodel.\nMontessori Knowledge and Training. Small schools originated\nas creative places where teachers have a clear idea of the\nprofessional culture they want to nurture. \"Relevant curricu-\nlums and assessments should ideally grow out of that culture,\nand teachers should have the flexibility to develop unique\ncurriculums, methodologies, and assessments appropriate to\ntheir students\" (Cook & Tashlik, 2005, p. 15). The objective\nis to develop curriculum that challenges and promotes criti-\ncal inquiry in a student body. The lack of teachers trained in\nMontessori principles was a major issue that Summit needed\nto overcome. At the time of the study, only 3 staff members\n(Cathy, Dave, and Barb) were trained in Montessori princi-\nples and had certification. That left 12 teachers without suf-\nficient tools to implement the Montessori philosophy into\ntheir daily curriculum.\nThe Montessori training program required a large finan-\ncial commitment from the school and a large time commit-\nment from the teachers. The closest training site was located\nin Ohio and required attendees to stay for a period of 6\nweeks. Dave explains why teachers were not sent their 1st\nyear of employment:\n6 SAGE Open\nWhat we learned is that it is best to bring teachers on, have them\nteach with us for a year, kind of get their feet wet and you know\nkind of absorb the lesson and the integrated teaching style. Then\nafter their first year, go to the 6-week adolescent training. Going\nin cold without really knowing what's going on is difficult and\nplus for our school, it's a $6,000 investment. (D. Segal, personal\nSummit High School, in some respects, took a big risk\nhiring candidates without discussing the training commit-\nment in advance. Staff members who are not trained in a par-\nticular curriculum focus will not be able to incorporate the\nmethod effectively into their own teaching and learning ped-\nagogy. Interestingly, all seven of the recently hired staff\nmembers are single, and new to the teaching profession.\nThe Leadership Model. One of the main objectives of small\nschool reform is to allow smaller schools the ability to create\nleadership models in which leadership is distributed across\nthe staff, instead of being centered on one person. Summit\nHigh School struggled with its leadership model, and how\nthat leadership model fit in with the rest of the multiplex.\nNone of the staff was a trained administrator, so running and\nleading a school was a new experience. Not only were staff\nmembers trying to figure out how to run and manage their\nown school but they also needed to operate within the build-\ning council, which was a group of principals representing the\nother small schools, housed in the Summit multiplex.\nBuilding Council.The building council meetings were estab-\nlished as a method of joint decision making for the entire\nmultiplex. The goal was for leadership to be shared among\nmany participants, but the reality was that the decisions were\nmade by only a few leaders. The building council reverted to\na hierarchical pattern of leadership, similar to that of schools\noperating with a principal. This pattern prevented some\nteachers, especially from Summit, from participating more in\nbuilding-wide programs and events.\nThis lack of communication between the building leaders\nresulted in whole building programs usually falling through.\nCollaborating on programs within the multiplex would have\nhelped create more unity between the small schools. If the\nschools felt more connected and more like a community,\nrivalries between the school programs and the students of\ndifferent schools might have decreased. Summit High School\nteachers were trying to negotiate within this new arena with-\nout proper training from the district, or help from the more\nseasoned leaders from the other schools. Summit High\nSchool staff members were left on their own to figure out\neven basic tasks, such as getting duplicate keys made for a\nclassroom or hiring a DJ for a school dance.\nThroughout the study, the building council continued to\nbe dysfunctional. The other building council leaders were\nprincipals and operated in a different leadership model, and\nwhen present at the meetings they had the ability to make\ndecisions on the spot if needed. Summit staff members, how-\never, always needed to go back to the rest of the staff before\nmaking any decisions. One explanation for the impasse of\nthe building council group is that the different leadership\nmodels did not work within the time constraints necessary\nfor building decisions. Another explanation is that the other\nbuilding leaders were assigned into their leadership roles as\nprincipals in the multiplex, therefore not choosing to be a\nleader of a small school.\nTeacher-Cooperative Model.The teacher-cooperative model\ngives teachers a systematic way to bypass the traditional\nchain of command, which relies on a principal, and act as a\ncollaborative body of classroom-level reformers, making\ndaily decisions in ways that will benefit their students (Wil-\nliams, 2007). This type of leadership model provides more\nautonomy in decision making but does require staff members\nto take on more tasks. Dave explains,\nOur leadership model has been very confusing over the last 3\nyears. We started out as a lead-teacher model and no one really\nknew a lot about what that was at that time. And then we became\nmore of a teacher cooperative where we tried to solve everything\nthrough consensus and long discussions. (D. Segal, personal\nAt Summit High School, teachers faced a heavy workload\nthat included, among other things, long, arduous meetings.\nMany were not willing to put the extra time in to get every-\nthing done, for example, arranging parent informational\nmeetings, or afterschool clubs and activities. As a result,\nmany teachers left during the 1st and 2nd year.\nFor a teacher collaborative model to be successful, all\nteachers need to embrace the ways in which decisions are\nreached by consensus. The reality of teachers practicing\nleadership is far from simplistic.\nKnowledge of Small Schools.According to Meier (2005),\nteachers must believe in and be involved in their small\nschools for those schools to be successful. Teachers in small\nschools need to rethink how schooling is done; understand-\ning what small schools are about is the first step. Summit\nteachers were unprepared. Emily, a new English teacher\nexplains,\nI think small schools struggle, because they are dealing with the\npopulation that comes out of factory sort of education style and\nall of a sudden they have to learn and it is the students who are\nalso going into shock. (E. Jones, personal communication, April\nIt is difficult to provide engaging teaching and learning in\nan environment that is unfamiliar. This was true for the\nmajority of the staff at Summit High School.\nThe research revealed that staff members knew little\nabout teaching and learning in small schools, most of them\nreferred to the basic features of small schools, most notably\nschool size. Nilga, a math and science teacher, commented,\n\"Small school is an alternate school that has 100 students per\ngrade level, or it has a limited enrollment\" (N. Nganle, per-\nshould have small classroom sizes\" (T. Johnson, personal\nIt appeared that on some level, Summit High School was\nnot really functioning as a small school, which resulted in\nthe staff not understanding how they were a small school\nother than referring to size or knowing students' names.\nThe literature suggests that to truly embrace small school\nreform, teachers need to be educated and understand the\nnuances of teaching and learning within a small school to\ntake advantage of all the things small schools can offer staff\nand students.\nKey Finding: A Continuous Struggle\nShared Space.Small schools are often required to share\nspace with other schools. This is primarily the case because\nschool districts need to utilize the buildings that they already\nown and operate, and most of these are old large comprehen-\nsive school buildings. Unfortunately, districts often do not\nspend the money to renovate these spaces to accommodate\nthe new small school configurations, and this was the case in\nThe staff and the students at Summit High School did not\nembrace the shared space or multiplex configuration. Summit\nHigh School's school calendar is slightly different than the\nother three schools; they start 3 weeks earlier in the fall and\nend 3 weeks earlier in the spring compared with the other\nthree schools in the multiplex. When Summit High School\nfirst opened in 2005, they had the school to themselves for\nthe first 3 weeks. Dave reflects on what that experience was\nlike:\nThinking back to our first 3 heavenly weeks when it was just us\nand our kids, I mean of course there were problems and there\nwas profanity and all the things that bug you but once the other\nschools moved in, everything was just . . . [it] went to hell.\nEverything got twice as hard in a week. (D. Segal, personal\nSummit High School was located in the basement near the\ncafeteria and the gymnasium. Being near the common spaces\nwas a problem as the students from the other schools con-\nstantly interrupted Summit's school day, either by kicking on\ndoors, running through the hallways, or starting fights.\nEventually, all common doors in Summit High School\nbecame locked doors, including the teacher work rooms,\nclassrooms, the library, and bathrooms.\nThroughout the study, the tensions and problems associ-\nated with the shared space continued to deteriorate. In\nresponse to the tensions, Summit concentrated on character\neducation and appropriate behavior. Ruth comments that the\nother schools \"have too much power over our education\nhere, because I feel like they are either interrupting our edu-\ncation or they have kids running down our hallways\" (R.\nsituation caused Summit students to shift their identities to fit\nin with the students from the other small schools in the mul-\ntiplex. Summit students acted one way in the classroom and\nonce they were in the hallways, they switched into a different\nrole that was more accepted among the population of stu-\ndents; they did not want to be seen by their peers as different.\nIt became a chameleon effect. The poor behaviors became\nthe status quo and continued to be perpetuated. This became\nthe accepted school culture.\nDistrict Policies. The small school reform movement has been\nabout creating an environment where students can flourish\npersonally and academically. Small schools are not little rep-\nlicas of large schools. Successful small schools are about cre-\nating change in curriculum, school culture, teacher's work,\nand student assessment (Raywid & Schmerler, 2003). For\nthese changes to occur, the policy environments supporting\nsmall schools need to change as well.\nSummit High School had difficulty working with WPS.\nTheir processes appeared to be outdated and remained\nunchanged even though the school structure had changed.\nOn one hand, WPS claimed to support the small school ini-\ntiative, but on the other hand, expected Summit to operate\nlike a large school with the same reporting structures. These\nreporting practices have not been altered to recognize the\nnewly changed school programs. There is a sense of \"same-\nness\" that continues to prevail; WPS operates as though\nschools, large and small, are the same and should be treated\nthe same (D. Segal, personal communication, April 6, 2009).\nThis was extremely frustrating to the teacher leaders at\nSummit.\nThere were other countless examples of WPS using out-\ndated practices included in the field notes throughout the\nstudy. For example, district principal meetings were held\nduring the school day. Teacher-led administrators were not\nable to attend because they were teaching in the classroom\nduring the meeting time. Furthermore, requiring high enroll-\nment numbers from new small schools was not realistic in\nsuch a short period of time. At times, the situations seemed\nso simple to handle and yet the processes to which the teach-\ners were asked to adhere seemed obsolete and excessively\ntime-consuming. As Summit High School attempted to\ndevelop systems that worked for their school, they were met\nwith resistance from the district. Tensions emerged between\nwhich policies the district was willing to change and which\npolicies it was not. One major problem Summit was dealing\nwith was sharing teachers within the multiplex. WPS District\nput a rule in place that schools cannot share teachers if the\nschools are operating under different calendars. Even though\nSummit is housed with three other schools, because of this\n8 SAGE Open\nrule it would not be able to share any teachers with the other\nschools because those schools have a different school calen-\ndar. The schools in Grassmore that share a similar calendar to\nSummit are located miles away and are large comprehensive\nschools that would not need to share teachers to save money.\nOne benefit of small schools sharing space is that they have\nthe opportunity to offer extra programs, including after-\nschool activities or clubs, and the cost is shared by all of the\nschools. However, this new payroll rule would make that\nimpossible for Summit High School. At a time when budgets\nare extremely tight, this adds another burden for the teachers\nto take on more responsibility within their own schools.\nThese and other requirements added unnecessary layers to\na system that should be more supportive in helping small\nschools in the first few years of existence. The issues with\nWPS hampered teachers of Summit's abilities to act autono-\nmously and make decisions that were right for their school,\ntheir staff, and their specific circumstances. The district\nreverting to a \"sameness\" mentality resulted in Summit\nremaining stagnant in many areas, and being forced to\ndevelop an activist approach to simply get things done.\nActivist Approach.Small schools are about creating schools\nthat fulfill the promise of what education can be, and sustain-\ning a democratic environment in which families can choose\nthe right school for their children. To continue to envision,\nfight for, and sustain these schools and environments, teach-\ners and leaders in small schools have an ongoing battle. Sim-\nple survival is a constant preoccupation for many small\nschools, and even well-established small schools are notori-\nous for the breathtaking demands placed on those that work\nwithin them (Mohr, 2000). Leaders find themselves spending\nlong hours crafting plans to counteract the ongoing resis-\ntance from district policies that just do not make sense.\nDave took on an activist role to fight for the programs and\nconcessions that he felt were necessary for Summit to be suc-\ncessful. The Innovative Schools Calendar was an example.\nThe Innovative Schools Calendar was a collaborative effort\nthat used a shared calendar and resources to provide more\nstudent contact time, shorter vacation time, more time\nfor professional development, and collaboratively operated\nproject-based enrichment and credit recovery intersessions\nDave suggested that the government \"stimulus funding pro-\nvides us with the opportunity to do something bold\" (school\nresults that the district would want, namely, increased aca-\ndemic achievement, as well as increased teacher retention\nrates, increased graduation rates, and decreased suspensions\nand disciplinary actions. The innovative school calendar was\neventually approved but not without a fight.\nAnalysis of Findings. Restructuring a large high school into a\nsmaller learning community is a challenging process. The\nliterature does not offer much about this process in terms of\nthe political struggles that occur within the school building\nand between the schools and the district offices, nor does the\nliterature talk about the culture clashes that exist in and com-\nplicate the physical spaces shared by new small schools. The\npersonal sacrifices that small schools demand from their cre-\nators are tremendous. Few realize this until they are already\nknee-deep in the reform effort:\nThere are some pitfalls that await unsuspecting small school\ndesigners. A small school is not merely a change of scale; it is a\nchange of intensity and it requires a whole new set of responses.\nIf that is not realized by everyone embarking on the journey,\nthere will be a terrible lot of energy expended with little gain.\nA significant factor in creating small learning communi-\nties is strong, caring leadership that keeps everyone focused\nthroughout the change process. There must be someone in\ncharge, someone who can anticipate the dangers, read the\nterrain, collect the wisdom, and inspire confidence, espe-\ncially when not feeling very confident (Mohr, 2000).\nThis research study explored the ways in which one new\nsmall high school, born out of a sweeping initiative to down-\nsize existing schools in a midwestern state, has experienced\nthis reform movement.\nTheoretical Framework Discussion.Fine's (2005) research on\nsmall school reform provided a framework to compare the\nevolution of Summit Montessori High School with the pro-\ncesses of other small schools that have proven successful\nbased on her research. Fine stated that new small high schools\nneed to focus on several elements, including access, partici-\npation and democracy, commitments to equity, sophisticated\nsystems of assessment that support better teaching and learn-\ning, and social justice and social responsibility. By focusing\non these elements, institutions are organizing themselves as\nschools that are designed to make a difference in the lives of\ntheir students, rather than just calling themselves \"small\nschools\" while engaging in practices that do not support the\ntrue intention of the reform movement.\nFine (2005) referred to \"access, participation, and democ-\nracy,\" as the process of providing education to the students\nwho need it most, for example, those from poor urban cities\nenrolled in schools with the least amount of resources.\nAccording to Fine, small schools were designed to counter-\nact this trend, primarily in urban centers, by developing\nschools where students felt like they belonged while also\nbeing challenged academically. Wealthier communities pro-\nvide their students an educational environment in which stu-\ndents typically flourish, move onto college, and become\ncontributing members of society. The statistics presented on\nWeston School District suggest that students in Weston are\nsuffering from the same disparity in education between\nwealthier and poorer communities. The number of students\nwho graduate from suburban schools in Weston is 82.5%,\nwhile only 54.5% graduate from urban schools (Thomas,\n2008). Affluent families can make a choice between public\nschool with advanced college-preparatory tracks or small\nprivate schools, some with a traditional orientation, some\norganized around a theme such as technology, and some with\na particular educational approach (Bill and Melinda Gates\nFoundation, 2003). All students should have the same oppor-\ntunity, regardless of color or socioeconomic background, to\npursue a rigorous education and attend college. These are the\nbeliefs that began the original grassroots efforts around cre-\nating smaller schools for students in urban cities. Small\nschool reform efforts, therefore, should not be driven by pri-\nvate funding in an attempt to transform schools into entities\nthat do not equally offer education to all types of students, or\nwork any differently than large comprehensive schools.\nFine's (2005) concept of small school reform is truly\nfocused on students' needs and democracy. Fine's research\nsuggests that small schools must move cautiously and ensure\nthat the schools are defined with a clear concept that focuses\non students' needs. Students and their parents should have a\nchoice between many high school programs that offer unique\ncurriculum ideas when it comes time to choose a high school.\nStudents, along with their parents, can decide which high\nschool's program matches their own career aspirations.\nSmall schools that focus on the talents of the individual stu-\ndent, assess the student with creative alternate methods, and\nresist using the typical \"high-stakes\" testing promote better\nteaching and learning for their students (Fine, 2005). Districts\nrandomly assigning students to schools that they do not want\nto attend defeats the purpose of what small schools are trying\nto accomplish. Students who are forced to attend one school\nrather than another will not work because they do not con-\nnect with the school's concept and vision.\nThis research study suggests that Summit High School\ndid not achieve many of the small school elements that have\ndefined Fine's (2005) work. For example, student access to\nSummit is still being manipulated by the district office. The\ndistrict office continues to assign students to Summit High\nSchool that does not have a Montessori background or an\ninterest in a Montessori or an IB curriculum focus. This pol-\nicy undermines the ability of families to make the choice to\nparticipate in a particular school's program. In addition, it is\ndifficult for staff members to work with students and families\nthat do not want to be part of the school community. Weston's\ndistrict office also has strict enrollment requirements that\nnegatively affected Summit High School. These polices\nmandate that schools within the district must have a specific\nnumber of students enrolled by a specific date in the fall of\neach academic year or sanctions will follow. Sanctions have\nincluded loss of teaching staff and loss of financial resources\nand programming. This policy forces teachers, leaders, or\nprincipals to fill open seats with any student willing to attend\nregardless of his or her curriculum focus or previous educa-\ntional background. These practices have affected the ability\nof Summit's leaders to fill their school with students inter-\nested in teaching and learning within a Montessori/IB focus.\nAuthentic assessment, another positive element of small\nschools, is missing at Summit High School. Summit's staff\nmembers have not created authentic assessments that reflect\ntheir unique curriculum, because the majority of them are not\ntrained in the Montessori philosophy. Alternate forms of\nassessment ensure that student's progress is being monitored\nin multiple ways instead of relying on high-stakes testing.\nResearch suggests that student work that involves an active\nmode of acquiring knowledge is linked to heightened student\nachievement (Newman, Marks, & Gamoran, 1995). Teachers\nwho seek alternate ways to assess student's understanding of\nthe curriculum are better equipped to alter the curriculum, if\nneeded, to ensure that critical learning is occurring.\nFurthermore, the district office in Weston needed to rede-\nsign its current policies to reflect the unique needs of new\nsmall schools as they shape and implement their new pro-\ngrams. If these practices are not altered or changed by the\ndistrict office, Summit High School will continue to flounder\nas it has for the past 3 years. If Weston is going to allow the\nHigh School Redesign Initiative to occur, then they need to\nbe flexible in changing their accountability structures to\nreflect the new school environments. Until Summit can\naddress these issues with student access, curriculum, enroll-\nment, and alternate forms of assessment, it will continue to\nstruggle in its evolution as a new small high school.\nDiscussion\nThe research at Summit High School revealed that there\nwere multiple pieces that were not held together. Ultimately,\nthis lack of cohesion hindered Summit High School's evolu-\ntion from its initial concept, to a program, and finally to a\nnew small school. More specifically, a lack of knowledge on\nthe part of the teachers and school leaders on the school's\nconcept and vision, curriculum focus, and leadership models\noften conflicted with the staff's ability to negotiate with\nother building and district personnel, and with themselves\nand their own community, which resulted in a fragmented\nlearning environment. In addition, operating within a multi-\nplex complicated the ability of Summit High School's staff\nto create a school culture that reflected their vision of what\nthe school should be. Although Summit struggled for auton-\nomy from the other schools within their multiplex and from\nthe district, it floundered and was prone to many pressures to\nconform and operate like a traditional comprehensive high\nschool. Moreover, teaching and learning did not evolve\nbecause of school leaders' lack of knowledge of small\nschools and limited information on Montessori curriculum\npractices. All of these challenges hindered the ability of\nSummit's staff to define their school's vision and identity\nand ultimately to move the school forward. The findings\nchallenge some current assumptions about small school\nreform and offer school leaders, teachers, and policy makers'\nsuggestions for making small school reform more successful.\nThe research findings have identified that the ways in which\nsmall schools handle their implementation processes, pro-\ngram planning, and district policy requirements as key com-\nponents to future reform success.\nImplementation Processes\nTo implement a new program, such as small school reform,\ntime and planning are important. Weston, like many other\nurban cities across the United States, has felt the pressure to\nmake changes in its failing high schools; as a result, there has\nbeen a tendency to rush the pace and push reform to multiple\nlocations at once. The Weston High School Initiative called\nfor more than 30 schools to be restructured over a 5-year\nperiod. Starting small school reform in just a few schools,\nconcentrating on the internal infrastructure first, is a more\norganized approach as compared with overhauling multiple\nlocations simultaneously.\nThe notion of starting small in a few locations first is sup-\nported and documented in the literature. Bryk, Easton,\nKerbow, Rollow, and Sebring (1993) conducted a study in\nChicago that made an overarching suggestion that urban\nschools and urban districts try to implement too many pro-\ngrams too soon, and that schools initiate programs on the\nbasis of what is needed rather than on the basis of what they\nare capable of handling. The study referred to this scenario as\nthe \"Christmas tree\" effect, that is, the schools adorned\nthemselves with program after program without carefully\nplanning and making sure that the programs were up and\nrunning before moving on. Bryk et al. (1993) found that ele-\nmentary school principals implementing reform acted with a\nmore entrepreneurial attitude, which led them to introduce\nprograms into the school at a pace that made no sense for\ntheir level of organizational development. Schools with no\ntrack record of successful implementation, the authors sug-\ngest, should not be attempting to implement three or four\nnew programs simultaneously. This study involved a teacher-\nled group at the high school level attempting multiple imple-\nmentations at once, 16 years after this research was done,\nand the results were very similar Trying to fix many things at\nonce did not work in 1993 and still does not work today.\nAfter so many years, why haven't school districts learned\nfrom their mistakes? Why do reform efforts continue to be\nimplemented in this manner over and over again? One expla-\nnation that this research study revealed is the notion of fair-\nness. Most districts attempt to operate under a policy of\nfairness between schools and this was evident in the Weston\nSchool District. Dave commented how difficult it was to get\napproval for new initiatives for Summit unless the initiatives\nwere universal to most of the schools in the district. His\nattempts to implement an innovative school calendar at\nSummit High School provide a perfect example. When Dave\ninitially submitted the proposal for Summit's new school cal-\nendar, it was rejected. The district did not want one high\nschool following a different academic calendar than the rest\nof the district. The fairness policy is in place to allow equal\nopportunities for all schools; if one school applies for fund-\ning for a new program or initiative, then all schools should\nhave the same opportunity. The problem is that all schools\nare not operating under the same organizational structures.\nSmall schools require different support mechanisms than\nlarge comprehensive schools or even private schools. For\nexample, small schools might need to share resources or\nafterschool activities, as well as sharing teaching staff, or in\nsome cases, need leeway with enrollment numbers. However,\nthe fairness attitude pressures districts to begin programs or\ninitiatives on a much larger scale then they are able to sup-\nport. Allowing multiple locations to begin new programs or\ninitiatives simultaneously without being able to support them\nsufficiently has the potential to cause these initiatives to fail.\nThe findings from this research project support this claim.\nThe superintendent in Weston felt pressured to \"fix\" the fail-\ning high schools and began a large-scale initiative of trans-\nforming large comprehensive high schools into smaller\nlearning communities without first figuring out how to sup-\nport the reform initiative features, or to ensure that its teach-\ners, students, and communities would be successful\nthroughout the process. Weston began its initiatives without\nknowing what to expect.\nBased on the research findings, schools should pilot a\nreform in one or two schools for a 3-year period before\nallowing a large-scale reform movement to occur throughout\nthe entire school district. School districts would then better\nunderstand the pitfalls, problems, and nuances of the reform\nbefore taking it to multiple locations. Moreover, the school\ndistricts would have more time to develop the necessary sup-\nport functions before schools begin the reform process,\nwhich would be extremely helpful to everyone involved in\nthe reform effort.\nProgram Planning\nSmall schools are small learning communities, first and fore-\nmost. The benefits of teaching and learning in small schools\nhave been discussed and established in the literature. The\nresearch base supports the transformation of large compre-\nhensive schools to smaller learning communities that focus\non specific unique curriculums. A challenge facing the small\nschools movement as it becomes more popular is keeping\nrestructuring efforts true to the philosophy of small schools\n(Hendrie, 2004). To be successful, small schools need to take\nadvantage of the benefits that this environment offers.\nProgram planning is intertwined in all facets of small schools,\nincluding school organization, curriculum, and instruction.\nAll of these components are mutually supportive practices,\ndependent on one another to realize their desired effect on\nstaff members of Summit High School were not able to\neffectively plan their teaching and learning practices or\ndevelop the school's vision during the first 3 years. In fact,\nplanning was lacking in many areas, including curriculum,\nstudent assessments, school concept, professional develop-\nment, and school and student identities.\nThe concept of a small school and its curriculum is often\nintertwined. For Summit, a big part of the school concept\nwas centered on the unique Montessori curriculum. However,\nonly three teachers at Summit were certified in the full scope\nof the curriculum program that defined their school. This\nlack of training and knowledge made it impossible for them\nto develop relevant instruction or make any decisions about\nchanging their own method of teaching. Professional devel-\nopment opportunities for these teachers were limited because\nof a lack of funds and district travel policies. The opportunity\nto create personalized learning for students is one of the ben-\nefits of smaller learning communities; unfortunately, the\nstaff at Summit was not able to capitalize on this benefit.\nAnother important element in program planning for small\nlearning communities is developing a clear vision of the\nschool. As administrators and teachers rush to restructure\nschools, they may only take the time to understand reform\nsuperficially; defining what the school is early on is vital to\nits staying true to reform philosophies. Mohr (2000) sug-\ngested that everything in a small school has an amplified\nimpact: \"Large schools are ocean liners on a steadier\ncourse--for better or worse, they keep on going. Small\nschools are little sailboats, maneuverable but easily tipped\"\n(p. 144). This was certainly the case at Summit High School;\nthey were barely able to stay afloat.\nDeveloping a statement that defines the vision of the\nschool is of critical importance as the small school is being\nformed. The vision is a critical step because it provides focus\nand stability for a new small school, and keeps the small\nschool on course. According to Feldman, Lopez, and Simon\n(2006), most small school conversion efforts get bogged\ndown in the daily decisions that staff members face when\ntime and resources are truly limited. They explain,\nWhen a group of people are attuned to their collective vision,\nthey are more likely to stay connected to the students' needs and\ntheir long-range conversion goals. They are less likely to be\nderailed by the day-to-day challenges conversion presents along\nthe way. Vision gives those involved a sense of purpose,\nidentifies compelling reasons, defines understandable goals for\nSummit High School floundered for many years because\nthe school leaders and teachers lacked a clear vision of the\nschool. A school's vision defines its unique design, including\nits structure, culture, and instructional approach. \"A solid\npedagogical foundation and vision for the school makes\nstaff of Summit struggled in creating a vision.\nFundamentally, program planning in small schools must\nfocus on developing a strong school identity that is rooted in\ninnovative curriculum and program offerings. This research\nstudy indicated that from the beginning the schools sharing\nspace in the Summit multiplex were competing against each\nother for their school identities and overall school domi-\nnance. This competition moved from battling to enroll stu-\ndents to meet district enrollment numbers to outright rivalries\nand fights between the students. This situation escalated\npartly due to the breakdown of the building council as well as\nthe other school leaders not fully buying into the small school\nreform idea. Other school leaders were not as invested in\ntheir own schools changing into a new small structure, as not\nall of the leaders supported small school reform. In the early\ndays, there was a lot of antismall school chatter among some\nleaders in Old Summit. According to one assistant principal,\nsmall schools do nothing more than \"transition kids in and\nor simply shuffle people around. \"Small schools are hard to\nfund and hard to run properly; there is not enough selection\nof interested students or good teachers\" (L. Blake, personal\ndoes not support small schools stated, \"Education is not a\npriority for this group [urban high school students], and the\nstatistics show that small school reform efforts usually don't\nlast more than 2 years\" (L. Blake, personal communication,\nThis type of viewpoint does not lend itself to cooperation\nbetween the schools. It was clear that two competing forces\nwere at play almost constantly. On one hand, there seemed to\nbe a need to retain the positive image of Old Summit, the\nformer large comprehensive school, and on the other hand,\nthe need to establish separate school identities. The actual\nprocesses by which small schools are created are important\nto the success of each individual school program and can\naffect the relationships between the small programs, particu-\nlarly if they share larger multiplex spaces (Mohr, 2000). The\nschools sharing the space of Old Summit never developed a\nsense of a shared community, and deeper relationships\nbetween all of the multiplex leaders and entire student body\nat Old Summit never evolved. This clearly affected the stu-\ndents at Summit High School. Summit's students did not\nconnect with students from other schools in the building and\noften felt the need to shift their identities to fit in.\nFor Summit High School, the shared space became a\ncomplicated space for the students to maneuver on a daily\nbasis, and as a result, suspension rates soared. In 2008, there\nwere 242 students enrolled in Summit High School, and 90\nstudents were suspended for a total of 249 times (school doc-\nconfiguration had a detrimental effect on the students. Mohr\n(2000) suggested that small schools view behavior issues\nmore broadly in an attempt to change the behavior:\nSmall schools that are not prepared to see student conflicts\nor acting-out behavior as a signal for a community-wide\nresponse will suffer far greater consequences and can find\nthemselves with ever-increasing disruptions. The typical\ncourse corrections--increased attempts to control and be\ncontrolled--will result in an escalation of tension and anger.\nSmall schools must use the community as a vehicle for\ndealing with issues and not revert to familiar and inappropriate\nConflict resolution is not just about stopping fights but\nconnecting the negative behavior more broadly to the cur-\nriculum and the lives of the students. \"When effectively\nwoven throughout the culture of the school, the resulting cur-\nriculum will include and be about everything going on in\nSummit's leaders were not able to foster a sense of commu-\nnity with the other schools, and as Mohr (2000) stated, \"A\ntrue community values each of its members and makes them\nfeel valuable\" (p. 153). Students need to be supported and\nvalued within their schools and teachers need to help create\nenvironments where conflict resolution is a primary compo-\nnent in building \"productive and high-functioning learning\nteachers became somewhat complacent to this growing prob-\nlem. They accepted this type of behavior as a large part of\ntheir daily activities.\nLeadership Model\nThe research revealed that the leadership model at Summit\nwas not developed in a way that allowed the school to func-\ntion properly, either as a separate entity or as a part of the\nmultiplex. Teachers share leadership tasks in small schools\nthat are spread across the entire school rather than being cen-\ntrally located with one person. Teachers must take on more\nresponsibility, but often have less training and guidance on\nhow to be successful, within this new leadership model. The\nteachers at Summit were clearly not prepared for or sup-\nported in their new capacity as school leaders.\nThe distributive leadership model might be a better option\nfor new small schools and would benefit from garnering the\ntalents of their individual teachers by distributing the leader-\nship based on skills rather than on convenience. Spillane's\n(2006) research on distributive leadership demonstrates that\nthis method would work well with Summit's leadership\nmodel because it is also rooted in collaboration, and relies on\nmutual trust, support, and inquiry from its members.\nEvidence suggests that it is difficult for teachers to create and\nsustain the conditions for improved pupil learning if those\nconditions do not exist for their own learning (Silns &\nMulford, 2002). When teachers share good practice and learn\ntogether, they increase the possibility of securing better qual-\nity teaching overall. The collaboration and collegiality fos-\ntered through distributed leadership has been shown to lead\nto an enhanced capacity for change and improvement at the\nschool and classroom levels. Research also shows that teach-\ners who work together in a meaningful and purposeful way\nare more likely to remain in the profession because they feel\nvalued and supported in their work (Barth et al., 1999).\nDistributed leadership, therefore, would provide the glue for\nSummit in accomplishing more common tasks or goals, and\naid in creating a culture of expectations supported by indi-\nvidual skills and abilities.\nSmall schools need to capitalize on the specific talents\nand expertise of their teachers and other staff members.\nBlending the distributive leadership methods with Summit's\nteacher-cooperative model would create a stronger founda-\ntion of leadership for the staff operating within a small school\nas well as provide a direction for mutual collaboration.\nDistrict Policies\nIn addition to the organizational elements of small schools,\ndistrict policies need to change to support new smaller learn-\ning communities. Curricular and instructional reorganization\ncannot be fully achieved unless the larger system of which it\nis a part also changes to accommodate the new practices\nof small schools are completely different than those of large\ncomprehensive schools, and yet this research concluded that\nSummit was still expected to operate within old policies that\ndid not support its new structure. In fact, this research uncov-\nered that Summit had additional layers of accountability to\nWPS regarding its Charter status. Small learning communi-\nties need the autonomy necessary to act in ways that support\ntheir vision and their goals, and imposing old policies on new\nsmall schools is inevitably going to undermine the success of\nnew small schools.\nStaff members of new small schools often lack the knowl-\nedge teachers at larger schools glean from years of working\nin a larger system (Dentith et al., 2007). This lack of knowl-\nedge can negatively affect newly formed programs. Policy\nmakers need to embrace bottom-up reform methods, which\nallow teachers the necessary room to create and maintain\nsuccessful small schools (Darling-Hammond, 1997; Meier,\n2000). Without drastic, systemic change in the larger system,\nsmall schools will fail, and the innovation and creativity\nsparked by them will be lost.\nFinal Thoughts\nSmall schools have come a long way over the past decade,\nbut the risks of these schools failing or reverting back to\ncomprehensive school practices are very real. Small schools\nneed to provide opportunities that are different than the larger\ncomprehensive schools they are replacing. Fine's (2005)\nquote suggests that small schools must operate as small\nschools, being mindful of the best practices identified for\nthose environments to flourish: \"At times, I have lauded\nthese schools as `sites of possibility,' criticized some as\n`large schools in drag'and others for `confusing hugs for cal-\nlenges to meet: developing leadership models, negotiating\nshared space, gaining access to resources, recruiting commit-\nted teachers, training staff, dealing with district paperwork\nand outdated policies, performing state-mandated testing,\nand meeting countless other challenges. Most, if not all, of\nthese issues were faced by the creators of Summit High\nSchool.\nThis research provides a glimpse into how small high\nschool reform is being carried out in a large, public urban\nschool district, and these findings add to the growing body of\nliterature surrounding this fast-moving reform movement.\nThis research study shines light on the complexity and mess-\niness of small high schools sharing space and the repercus-\nsions this arrangement has on its students and school leaders.\nIt also reveals the power struggles that school leaders face in\nan attempt to build a community of learners. Change is dif-\nficult and not always embraced.\nAt their core, small schools can provide equitable educa-\ntion to students seeking to learn in an environment that pro-\nmotes democracy, if small schools are supported in the ways\nthat allow them to flourish. District, state, and federal poli-\ncies need to support small schools, allowing them the neces-\nsary breathing room to get their programs up and running.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
