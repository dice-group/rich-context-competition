One such factor ap-\npears to be one's level of social engagement --a term we\nuse to refer broadly to both quantitative and qualitative as-\npects of social interaction, A growing body of evidence sug-\ngests that greater social engagement is associated with\nsignificantly lower risks for cognitive decline and dementia\nin older adults (Fratiglioni, Paillard-Borg, & Winblad,\n2004). The question of whether such associations are evi-\ndent across the life course (e.g., earlier in adulthood as well\nas at older ages) has not been examined.\nAmong older adults, longitudinal cohort studies have\ndocumented significant relationships between greater so-\ncial integration (i.e., larger social networks) and less risk\nof cognitive decline (Barnes et al., 2007; Bassuk, Glass, &\nAlvarado, Del Ser, & Otero, 2003). Two studies included\nlongitudinal social engagement data and found greater\ncognitive declines in older adults who reported consis-\ntently low or decreasing levels of social engagement (Bassuk\nported a significant relationship between greater social\nactivity and lower subsequent risk of cognitive decline\n(Beland, Zunzunegui, Alvarado, Otero, & Del Ser, 2005;\nBosma et al., 2002; Lovden, Ghisletta, & Lindenberger,\n2003), although two studies did not find such a relation-\nship (Aartsen, Smits, van Tilburg, Knipscheer, & Deeg,\nstudies of older adults also have linked greater reported\nsupport from others to lower risk of cognitive decline\n(Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, & Berkman, 2001; Zunzunegui\net al., 2003), whereas a third found that greater loneliness\nwas associated with increased risk of decline (Tilvis et al.,\n2004). Notably, these studies reflect a range of popula-\ntions and cultures from the United States (Barnes et al.,\n& Stern, 2001), Sweden (Fratiglioni, Wang, Ericsson,\nMaytan, & Winblad, 2000; Wang, Karp, Winblad, &\net al., 1999), Germany (Seidler, Bernhardt, Nienhaus, &\n(Yen et al., 2004) and show links between social engage-\nment and better performance in multiple major cognitive\ndomains, including recall/memory tasks (Bosma et al.,\nHistories of Social Engagement and Adult Cognition:\nMidlife in the U.S. Study\nTeresa E.

To evaluate whether social contacts, support, and social strain/conflict are related to executive function and\nmemory abilities in middle-age and older adults.\nMethods. Longitudinal data on social contacts, support, and strain/conflict were examined in relation to executive\nfunction and memory at ages 35\u00ad85 years using data from the national Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) study. Age-related\ndifferences in patterns of association were also examined.\nResults. Regression analyses, controlling for age, sex, race, education, chronic health conditions, and health behav-\niors, revealed significant positive associations between histories of greater social contacts and support and both executive\nfunction and episodic memory, whereas declines in social contacts were negatively associated with both outcomes.\nGreater average reported frequency of social exchanges characterized by strain or conflict was negatively associated with\nexecutive function but not episodic memory. Patterns were generally consistent across different age groups; where differ-\nences were seen, associations were stronger in younger age group.\nDiscussion. Positive and negative aspects of social relationships are related to cognition throughout adulthood, con-\nsistent with the hypothesis that social factors have life-long influences on cognition. Positive and negative aspects of so-\ncial engagement may thus be important factors to consider in relation to efforts to promote optimal cognitive development\nand cognitive aging.\nKey Words: Executive function--Memory--Social support--Social engagement.\nHultsch et al., 1999), executive function (Bosma et al.,\nThe hypothesis that features of our social environments\ncan impact on cognitive functioning, and do so not just in\nolder age but throughout the life course, fits within a broader\ntheoretical (and empirical) literature on the evolution of\nman as a social animal living in groups, resulting in a highly\nevolved \"social brain\"--a brain that both allows us (with\nvarying individual degrees of success) to develop and main-\nGrossmann & Johnson, 2007) and that is in turn attentive to\nand influenced by our interactions with others. Over the past\nseveral decades, a growing body of evidence has high-\nlighted the salience of social relationships to multiple as-\npectsofhealthandwell-being(i.e.,greatersocialintegration/\nsupport being associated cross-sectionally and longitudi-\nnally with better physical and mental health and greater lon-\ngevity (Baumeister & Sommer, 1997; Cohen & Syme,\nrelationships are thought to affect health (including cogni-\ntive \"health\") include social influences on brain development\ninfluences on the brain's cognitive\u00ademotional interpretation\nof (and responses to) stimuli and the resulting patterns of\nphysiological activity in major biological regulatory sys-\ntems that in turn affect risks for most major health condi-\ntions, including cognition (DeVries, Glasper, & Detillion,\nSimilar to animal \"enrichment\" models (Diamond, 2001;\nFillit et al., 2002), greater social interaction/engagement\nmay also contribute to better cognitive functioning across\nthe life course at least in part as a result of the cognitive\ndemands associated with such interactions, including de-\nmands on cognitive processes such as attention, reasoning,\nlanguage, executive function, and speed of processing.\nData from the Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) study offer a\nunique opportunity to examine relationships between pat-\nterns of social engagement over a decade and subsequent\nlevels of adult cognition and to do so for a cohort ranging in\nage from younger adults in their 30s to older adults in their\n70s and 80s. We sought to test the hypothesis that patterns of\nsocial engagement would be related to adult cognitive func-\ntioning in all age groups. The MIDUS data offer the advan-\ntage of including assessments of quantitative aspects of\nsocial engagement (i.e., extent of social contacts/relation-\nships) along with assessments of both positive and negative\nqualitative aspects of those relationships. The availability of\ninformation on not only positive/supportive qualities of indi-\nviduals' social relationships but also negative features of\nthose same relationships (e.g., levels of social strain and\nconflict) provides a unique opportunity to assess the hypoth-\nesis that unlike supportive interactions (which are hypothe-\nsized to generate patterns of cognitive\u00ademotional and\nphysiological activation that will support better cognitive\nfunctioning), social strain/conflict will be associated with\npatterns of cognitive\u00ademotional and physiological activation\nthat will negatively impact on cognition. Existing evidence\nfrom both laboratory-based studies of the physiological and\ncognitive\u00ademotional consequences of social conflict as well\nas population-based surveys linking reported levels of social\nconflict to profiles of physiological activity provides support\nfor the hypothesis that social conflict/strain results in pat-\nterns of physiological arousal known to be associated with\nincreased health risks (i.e., increases in blood pressure, in-\nflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and sym-\npathetic nervous system arousal; Seeman & McEwen, 1996;\nUchino, Cacioppo, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1996). MIDUS also\nallows for controls for major potential confounders such as\neducation, health status, and health behaviors that have pre-\nviously been related to both social engagement (Glass, De\nRyff, Singer, & Palmersheim, 2004; Seeman, Bruce, &\nMethods\nI). The original sample (N = 7,108) included respondents\naged 25\u00ad74 years. Though national in scope, the original\nMIDUS cohort was not strictly speaking nationally repre-\nsentative. Like many such surveys, it underrepresented\nthose at the extremes of the socioeconomic status (SES)\ncontinuum but did encompass a majority of the SES diver-\nsity within the U.S. adult population. A second wave of data\ning a new telephone protocol to assess cognitive function.\nAs detailed in Radler and Ryff (2010), similar to other lon-\ngitudinal studies, among the 4,963 participants reassessed\nat Wave 2, higher retention was found for Whites, women,\nand those with better health and higher education. Analyses\nalso indicated that health status predicted retention more\nstrongly among older individuals, whereas SES better pre-\ndicted retention among those with lower functional health\nCognitive Function\nAfter a brief hearing check, cognition was assessed using\nthe Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT),\nwhich includes six accuracy measures of key domains of\ncognitive aging: episodic memory (immediate and delayed\nword list recall), working memory (digits backward), exec-\nutive function and semantic memory (category fluency),\nreasoning (number series completion), and speed of pro-\ncessing (backward counting). Additionally, the Stop and Go\nSwitch Task (SGST) provides both accuracy and latency\nmeasures of cognitive function; in the following analyses,\nwe focus on task-switching latencies (averaged over switch\nand nonswitch trials). In order to assess response latencies\nand ensure that participants were performing the task as di-\nrected, the latencies data were filtered to exclude individu-\nals who did not meet 75% or better accuracy criteria on each\ntask condition (for more detailed information, see Tun &\nThe dependent variables reflect two summary measures of\ncognitive function based on exploratory and confirmatory\nfactor analysis of the BTACT measures and task-switching\nlatencies from the SGST (Lachman,Agrigoroaei, Murphy, &\nTun, 2010). The episodic memory measure comprised scores\non immediate and delayed word recall; the remaining BTACT\nitems and SGST latency measures comprise an executive\n2008). Each summary score was computed as a mean of the z\nscores for the respective tests. The two means were also stan-\ndardized to z scores, with a mean of 0 and a SD of 1. Cogni-\ntive outcome data were available for 3,195 participants for\nexecutive function and for 3,530 participants for episodic\nmemory; those excluded from the current analyses tended to\nbe older (executive function outcome only), non-White, less\neducated, and in poorer health (data not shown).\nSocial Engagement\nThree aspects of social engagement were assessed at both\nMIDUS I and II: frequency of social contacts and extent of\nreported social support and social strain/conflict. Social\ncontacts were assessed as the sum of the frequency of con-\ntact (never or hardly ever, less than once per month, about\nonce per month, 2\u00ad3 times per month, once per week, about\nonce a day, and several times per day) across two domains:\nfamily and friends.A sum score of social contacts was given\nonly if information for both family and friends was avail-\nable. Social support was created as the average of responses\nregarding \"how much\" spouse, other family, and friends are\nsources of understanding, caring, appreciation, and provide\nemotional, reliance, and esteem support based on response\ncategories ranging from not at all, a little, and some to a\nlot (Cronbach's alpha = .90 for both M1 and M2 scale\nscores). Using the same range of responses, social strain/\nconflict was measured as the average of responses regarding\nhow often spouse, other family, and friends are sources of\ndemands, criticism, tension/arguments, or let you down or\nannoy you (Cronbach's alpha = .89 for both M1 and M2\nscale scores). For both social support and social strain/con-\nflict, mean scores were not created if more than two of the\nthree domains queried (spouse, family, and friends) were\nmissing data. Correlations among the three aspects of social\nengagement ranged from very low to moderate at most,\nwith more contacts related to greater support (r[M1] = .32;\n.02), whereas greater support was associated with lesser\nTo assess cumulative social engagement across these\nthree domains, averages of MIDUS I and II scores for each\ndomain were created. If one time point was missing data,\nthe score from the available time point was imputed as the\naverage score because those with data from both time points\nprovided strong evidence that a majority of adults exhibited\nsubstantial stability over time in all domains with T1\u00adT2\ncorrelations of .44 for contacts, .59 for support, and .59 for\nconflict.\nCovariates\nSelection of covariates for inclusion in the current analy-\nses was based on prior evidence, suggesting that they could\nbe potential confounders (i.e., that they have been related\nto both social engagement; Glass et al., 2006; Okun &\nZunzunegui et al., 2003; and cognition; Colcombe &\nWhitfield et al., 2000). Sociodemographics included age\n(in years), gender (coded 1 for female), education, and race\n(Black/African American, Native American/Aleutian Island/\nEskimo, Asian or Pacific Islander, \"other,\" and multiracial\ncompared with the reference category of \"White\"). Educa-\ntion was assessed based on a six-category degree-based\nmeasure ranging from \"less than high school\" to \"PhD,\nEDD, MD, and other professional degree.\" Health status\nwas assessed based on (a) self-reports of major chronic\nconditions based on indicator variables for reports of heart\ndisease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes; (b) reported\nnumber of activities of daily living disabilities (0\u00ad6); and\n(c) a measure of depression based on the screening version\nof the major depression section of the World Health Orga-\nnization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview\n(Kessler, Mickelson, Walters, Zhao, & Hamilton, 2004),\nreflecting reports of being sad, blue, or depressed or loss of\ninterest in most things all day or most of the day nearly\nevery day for 2 weeks as well as at least four other associ-\nated symptoms, including problems with eating, sleeping,\nenergy, concentration, feelings of self-worth, and thoughts\nof death; this variable is score present (1) or absent (0).\nHealth behaviors included smoking status (coded as for-\nmer smokers and current smokers, each compared with ref-\nerence category of nonsmokers) and physical activity\n(assessed based on an ordinal measure indicating level of\nhighest reported activity). Separate indices of activity were\ncreated for MIDUS I and II due to differences in available\nitems with additional items at MIDUS II allowing for iden-\ntification of light activity where only moderate and vigor-\nous could be identified at MIDUS I (M1 index range = 0\u00ad3,\nno reported activity, only moderate activity, infrequent vig-\norous activity, and frequent vigorous activity vs. M2 index\nrange = 0\u00ad4, no reported activity, only light activity, only\nlight or moderate activity, infrequent vigorous activity, and\nfrequent vigorous activity).\nAnalyses\nWe examined relationships for each of the three domains\nof social engagement to each of the cognitive outcomes us-\ning generalized linear mixed models (SAS 9.2 software) in\norder to account for clustering at the family level because\n834 participants in the analytic sample were siblings of\nother participants. We examined both continuous and cate-\ngorical (quartile)-based measures for the social engagement\ndomains (examining indicator/flag variables for each quar-\ntile relative to the \"best\"--high contacts or support, low\nconflict) to evaluate possible nonlinearities in the relation-\nships to cognition. Results are presented here only for the\ncontinuous social engagement measures as no evidence for\nnonlinearities was seen. Results are reported based on stan-\ndardized coefficients (i.e., unit change in outcome per stan-\ndard deviation difference on social engagement [or other]\nindex). Covariates were added in steps to observe changes\nin the relationship between cognition and the social engage-\nment variables, adjusting first for major sociodemographic\ncharacteristics, then for health status, and lastly for health\nbehaviors. Hommel adjustment was applied to account for\nthe multiple testing associated with primary analyses of av-\nerage social influences (two outcomes and three major pre-\ndictors), and analyses of effects of changes in social factors\n(four predictors and two outcomes; Hommel, 1988) tests for\nage interaction were treated as exploratory and were not ad-\njusted for multiple testing.\nDrawing on the unique range of adult ages within the\nMIDUS cohort, we tested for differences in relationships by\nage, with particular attention to whether patterns of associa-\ntion observed in previous work among older adults would\nbe seen among younger MIDUS adults. For each cognitive\noutcome, tests for interactions between each social domain\nand age were examined, including age-by-social domain in-\nteraction terms with age centered at the sample mean.\nWe also assessed the effect of changes in social engage-\nment over time in two ways. For our measure of social con-\ntacts, where change scores are integers reflecting changes\nacross categories, we fit models where the change from M1\nto M2 was categorized into dummy variables: down three\npoints from M1 and up three points from M1 versus no\nchange (reference group); difference of three points was se-\nlected based on both a priori desire to identify those with\ngreatest reported change as well as examination of actual\nchange distribution to ensure adequate sample sizes in both\n\"change\" groups. For the measures of social support and\nsocial strain/conflict, where continuous mean scores were\navailable, we fit linear regression models using the social\nengagement score at M1 with a measure of continuous\nchange in social engagement from M1 to M2 (as measured\nby M2 score - M1 score). Because methodologists have\nsuggested that adjusting for the baseline level of a risk fac-\ntor, when studying the effect of risk factor change on dis-\nease risk, can lead to overestimates of effect (Cain, Kronmal,\n& Kosinski, 1992), we repeated the multivariable analyses,\nadjusting for the mean of the baseline and final values--an\napproach that underestimates effects of change--to assess\nthe stability of our findings relating to the effects of change.\nResults\nTable 1 provides descriptive information for those in-\ncluded in the present analyses (i.e., with complete data on\nall variables used in the analyses) along with comparative\nstatistics for the more complete group of all those seen at\nMIDUS II. There are few, if any, differences between our\nanalysis sample and the overall MIDUS II cohort. At the\ntime of their MIDUS II assessments, the analysis sample\nranged in age from 32 to 84 years with an average age of\nwith 55.3% women. Just over 38% reported attaining a\nBachelor's degree or more with another 28.5% reporting\nsome college or an Associates degree; only 5.4% had not\nattained at least a high school or General Education Devel-\nopment degree. Average reported levels of social contacts,\nsupport, and conflict show high levels of stability from\nMIDUS I to II: social contacts (M1: mean = 11.5, range =\nences between MIDUS I and II were small: -0.14 for social\nBoth executive function and episodic memory exhibited\nthe expected age differences in cognitive performance, with\npoorer performance seen in the older age groups (see Figure 1)\nRegression models for executive function revealed the\nexpected patterns of association for our measures of social\nengagement. Higher average reported social contacts and\nsupport were associated with better executive functioning,\nwhereas higher average reported social strain/conflict was\nassociated with poorer executive function. As shown in\nTable 2, these relationships remained significant for with\nsequential controls for age (Model 1) and other sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics, including education (Model 2); con-\ntacts and conflict/strain also remain significant with further\ncontrols for major health conditions and health behaviors\n(Model 3), though estimates of the change in R2 associated\nwith the social factors alone are small (ranging from 0.4\n[social conflict] to 1.4 [social contacts]). Parallel analyses\nfor episodic memory revealed significant positive associa-\ntions for social contacts and support in all models (seeTable 3),\nthough again estimated changes in R2 are small (social con-\ntacts = 2.8; social support = 0.2). Reported levels of social\nstrain/conflict were not significantly related to episodic\nmemory in any models. When all three domains of social\nengagement were examined simultaneously, more social\ncontacts and lower social strain/conflict each remained\nsignificantly associated with better executive function\nfor social strain/conflict). Both social contacts and support\nremained independently and positively associated with\nTests for age interactions revealed significant interactions\nwith respect to executive function for social support\nwith respect to episodic memory. Figure 2 (executive func-\ntion) and Figure 3 (episodic memory) illustrate the patterning\nof these age interactions, plotting the associations at age\n55 years (mean age) and those at 1 SD (approximately\n12 years) above and below the mean. As shown, these age\ninteractions reflected stronger patterns of associations\namong younger participants.\nA final set of analyses examined whether and how\nchanges in reported social engagement were related to the\ntwo cognitive outcomes. As shown in Table 4, once adjusted\nfor multiple comparisons, only declines in social contacts\nwere significantly related to both executive function and\nepisodic memory outcomes, independent of all covariates.\nTable 1.

Analyses\ncontrolling for average social engagement rather than base-\nline yielded weaker though basically similar results (data\nnot shown).\nDiscussion\nAnalyses of MIDUS social engagement and cognition\ndata revealed significant positive associations between aver-\nage reported contacts and support and measures of both ex-\necutive function and episodic memory, independent of age,\neducation, gender, and race as well as major health condi-\ntions and health behaviors. Extending prior work, examina-\ntion of possible links between reported frequency of\nnegative social exchanges such as excessive criticism and\ndemands or perceptions that others \"let you down\" and cog-\nnition also revealed that greater frequency of such social\nstrain/conflict was significantly and negatively associated\nwith executive function but not episodic memory. Longitu-\ndinal social engagement data also revealed that declines in\nsocial contacts over the decade between MIDUS I and II\nwere associated with poorer executive function and epi-\nsodic memory performance.\nThe wide age range in the MIDUS cohort (35 years and\nolder at the time of the cognitive assessments) also allowed\nus to test the hypothesis that associations between social\nengagement and cognition previously documented for older\nadults would be evident at younger ages as well. Consistent\nwith this hypothesis, we found significant positive associa-\ntions between social contacts and support and both cogni-\ntive outcomes for those younger than the age of 65 years.\nSocial strain/conflict was also significantly associated with\npoorer executive function and marginally associated with\npoorer episodic memory in this younger age group. For\nthose older than the age of 65 years, we also found signifi-\ncant positively associations between social contacts and\nboth executive function and episodic memory. For episodic\nmemory, effect sizes for social support and conflict were\nsimilar to those seen among the younger age group but were\nnot statistically significant due to larger standard errors.\nFormal tests for age interactions revealed that associations\nwere significantly stronger among the younger adults for\nsocial support and conflict with respect to executive func-\ntion and stronger for social strain/conflict with respect to\nepisodic memory.\nThe overall pattern of these findings is consistent with a\nlife course model for social engagement influences on cog-\nnition wherein social influences are evident not only at\nolder ages but across the life course. MIDUS data show that\namong adults aged 32 years and older, those reporting\nhigher average social contacts and social support (based on\nassessments approximately a decade apart) performed sig-\nnificantly better on tests of executive function and episodic\nmemory, whereas higher average reported frequency of so-\ncial strain/conflict was associated with significantly poorer\nperformance. Changes over time were also associated with\ndifferences in cognitive performance with declines in con-\ntact (i.e., reductions in exposure to \"positive factors\") asso-\nciated with poorer performance. Though not statistically\nsignificant when accounting for multiple comparisons, there\nwas suggestive evidence that increases in support (i.e., in-\ncreased exposure to a \"positive factor\") were associated\nwith better performance.\nThough the MIDUS data provide support for our original\nhypothesis that social engagement would be associated with\nbetter cognition at younger as well as older ages, the fact\nthat a number of the associations were stronger among the\nyounger member of the MIDUS cohort was unexpected.\nPossible reasons for the stronger associations among those\nyounger than the age of 65 years may include the greater\nattrition among the older adults from baseline to MIDUS II\n(when the cognition assessments were made) such that\nthose with the poorest social engagement histories were less\nlikely to remain in the cohort by the MIDUS II follow-up\nand are thus not included in the current analyses. Had they\nremained, one might hypothesize that they would have ex-\nhibited the poorest cognition and might have contributed to\nstronger associations between poor social engagement and\npoor cognition among the older adults. Our pattern of\nweaker associations at older ages parallels findings for mul-\ntiple other risk factors (e.g., Berry, Ngo, Samelson, & Kiel,\nFigure 1. Age-related differences in cognition.\nothers, also reflect in part the greater competing risks at\nolder ages wherein even those with good profiles of social\nengagement are, for example, more likely than their younger\ncounterparts to have other risk factors that will increase\ntheir risks for poorer cognition. Thus, though we controlled\nfor a number of known risk factors for poorer cognition\n(e.g., health conditions, health behaviors), it is likely that\nTable 2.

With\nonly a single assessment of cognition at MIDUS II, analyses\npresented here provide evidence for \"associations\" between\nhistories of social engagement and executive function and\nepisodic memory as of MIDUS II. Further investigation of\nthe temporal sequencing of changes in social engagement\nand changes in cognition must await future longitudinal cog-\nnitive data. Such data will allow (as the current data do not)\nfor evaluation of the relative strengths of what are, in all like-\nlihood, reciprocal relationships between social engagement\nand cognition with cognition and changes in cognition im-\npacting on patterns of social engagement even as social en-\ngagement itself influences cognition and trajectories of\ncognitive aging. The current analyses only allow us to deter-\nmine the presence of associations between these two impor-\ntant domains without being able to assess the relative strength\nof the directionality of their respective influences. For the\nmajority of the current MIDUS cohort, however, available\ncognitive data show performance levels that are suffi-\nciently high that reverse causation--with cognitive function\nbeing sufficiently poor as to negatively impact on social\nengagement--would seem less plausible as the primary ex-\nplanation for the observed association. Only among the old-\nest of the MIDUS participants, where cognitive performance\nis poorest, might one speculate that patterns of social en-\ngagement were potentially more affected by cognitive func-\ntioning. Whether and how any reciprocal effects come to be\nmanifest over the life course, however, awaits further longi-\ntudinal data for both cognition and social engagement. Also,\nthe social engagement data are based on self-reports and thus\ncould be subject to differential response bias (e.g., if those\nwith better cognition are more likely to bias their self-reports\ntoward more positive reporting of social engagement); if so,\n+\nD\nS\n-\nD\nS\nSocial Support\nExecutive Function\nAge (mean)\n+\nD\nS\n-\nD\nS\nSocial Conflict\nExecutive Function\nAge (mean)\nFigure 2.

Age-related differences in associations between social strain/conflict and episodic memory.\nthis could result in an upward bias in estimates of the asso-\nciation between social engagement and cognition. Finally, as\nnoted previously, the MIDUS is a national sample with sub-\nstantial socioeconomic diversity but is not strictly nationally\nrepresentative, and the cognitive data were collected only for\nthose remaining in the longitudinal cohort, which, like all\nlongitudinal studies, is positively selected for those who re-\nmained healthier and more interested in continuing their par-\nticipation in the study. Thus, the generalizability of our\nfindings remains to be determined.\nThese analyses, however, also have a number of signifi-\ncant strengths. First, the age range of the cohort allowed for\nthe first formal tests of the hypothesis that relationships be-\ntween social engagement and cognition are not restricted to\nolder ages but rather are evident much earlier in life. MIDUS\ndata allowed for testing of these associations among adults\nas young as 35 years at the time of the cognitive assess-\nments. Second, the MIDUS data provide particularly rich\ninformation on social engagement, including assessments\nof more quantitative aspects such as social contacts as well\nas more qualitative features, including frequency of both\npositive social exchanges (social support) and negative ex-\nchanges (social strain/conflict). Also, the social engagement\ndata are available at two time points approximately a decade\napart, allowing for evaluation of more cumulative aspects of\nsocial engagement (i.e., social histories) as they relate to\ncognition. Third, although the cognitive data are only avail-\nable at a single time point, the range of measures provides\nassessments for key cognitive domains known to be impor-\ntant in cognitive aging across the life span. Furthermore, the\ninnovative telephone-based SGST provided enhanced data\non speed of processing and executive function through as-\nsessments of latencies in task switching.\nIn summary, MIDUS data provide evidence linking three\naspects of social engagement--social contacts, support, and\nconflict--to both executive function and episodic memory\nin adults ranging in age from 35 to 84 years. Those report-\ning greater average contacts and support performed better\non both types of cognitive tasks, whereas those reporting\ngreater average frequency of negative social exchanges per-\nformed did more poorly. The fact that these associations\nwere evident in younger adults and that changes in these\nfeatures of social engagement are related to performance\npoints to the potential value of considering more positive\naspects of social engagement such as social contacts and\nsupport in the context of any future efforts to improve or\nbolster levels of cognition across the life course. These data\nalso suggest the importance of taking account of risks stem-\nming from higher levels of social strain/conflict. Clearly,\nfurther research is needed to confirm these initial findings\nregarding the associations at younger ages and the impact of\nnegative social exchanges. The current findings, however,\nwill hopefully encourage attention to these questions as we\nseek to understand how patterns of social engagement im-\npact on cognitive function across the life course and how we\nmight best leverage such knowledge to enhance cognitive\ndevelopment earlier in life and reduce risks for cognitive\ndeclines in later life.\nFunding\n020166) from the Behavioral and Social Research Program in the National\nInstitutes of Health funding for the General Clinical Research Centers\nProgram.\nCorrespondence\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Teresa Seeman, PhD, Division\nof Geriatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles,\nReferences\nAartsen, M.
