A disease-segregating mutation (p.Gly171Ala), absent in normal population, was\nidentified in the SORT1 gene. The p.Gly171Ala mutation was shown not only to impair the expression of its encoding protein\nsortilin but also the mRNA levels of its binding partner p75 neurotrophin receptor that is known to be implicated in brain\ninjury, neuronal apoptosis, and neurotransmission.\n",

Albeit its core motor symptom is\nan 8- to 12-Hz kinetic tremor of the arms, some\npatients with ET also develop other motor and non-\nmotor manifestations, including parkinsonism, myoclo-\nnus, dystonia, cerebellar dysfunction, sensory\nabnormalities, sleep disorders, and cognitive and psy-\nchiatric features (Louis, 2010). Despite many magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) studies have supported the\nhypothesis that the abnormalities of the cerebellotha-\nlamo-cortical motor pathway and the fronto-parietal\ncircuit are involved in the functional pathological\nchanges of ET (Bagepally et al., 2012), there is still\na controversy as to whether there is an underlying\nneurodegenerative process of the cerebellum in ET\nConsequently, there is growing evidence that ET may\n1Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New\nYork, NY, USA\n2Biodonostia Research Institute, University of the Basque Country, San\nSebastia\n\u00b4n, Gipuzkoa, Spain\n3Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastia\n\u00b4n,\nGuipuzcoa, Spain\n4Centro de investigacio\n\u00b4n biome\n\u00b4dica en Red para enfermedades\nNeurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Madrid, Spain\n5Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA\n6Department of Medicine, The Immunology Institute, Icahn School of\nMedicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA\n7Department of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country, San\nSebastia\n\u00b4n, Guipuzcoa, Spain\n8Departments of Psychiatry and Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn\nSchool of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA\n9Friedman Brain and Mindich Child Health and Development Institutes,\nIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nCoro Paisa\n\u00b4n-Ruiz, Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at\nMount Sinai, One Gustave L.

This is partly due\nto misdiagnosis is a common feature in ET, with 37% to\n50% of ET patients reported to be misdiagnosed (Schrag\net al., 2000). Genetic variants within LINGO1 (MIM\nfor developing ET; however, these associations have not\nbeen consistently replicated (Zimprich, 2011;\nKuhlenbaumer et al., 2014). Through genome-wide asso-\nciation and whole exome sequencing (WES) analyses,\ngenes have been reported to respectively carry suscepti-\nbility or causative alleles for ET (Merner et al., 2012;\nThier et al., 2012). While the disease-associated mutation\nidentified in the FUS gene was only present in 54% of\nindividuals classified as ``possible'' ET, it fully segregated\nwith disease in individuals with definite and probable ET\n(Merner et al., 2012). More recently, a disease-\nsegregating mutation (p.G399S) in the HTRA2 gene has\nbeen reported in a large kindred featuring both ET and\nParkinson's disease (Unal Gulsuner et al., 2014). Taken\ntogether, these clinical barriers associated with ET make\ntraditional gene discovery approaches not succeed in the\nidentification of the causal gene defect. Therefore, in an\nattempt to identify a causative gene for ET, we performed\nWES and subsequent functional analyses in a family fea-\nturing an autosomal dominant form of early-onset ET.\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects\nA Spanish ET family consisting of an affected father, an\nunaffected paternal aunt, a healthy mother as well as one\naffected and two unaffected siblings was clinically exam-\nined and subject to WES approaches (Figure 1(a)).\nSubjects were recruited from a descriptive study of famil-\niar and sporadic ET cases and controls carried out in the\nMovement Disorders Unit at the Donostia University\nHospital (San Sebastian, Spain). Genomic DNA samples\nfrom all family members in addition to samples from\nwere available for study. A cohort composed of 188 con-\ntrol chromosomes of Spanish individuals without family\nhistory of any movement disorders was also available.\nThe age at sample collection of the control cohort\nyears. The local ethics committee at the Donostia\nUniversity Hospital approved this study and informed\nconsent was obtained from all participants. DNA sam-\nples from all participating members were isolated from\nwhole blood using standard procedures. All methods\nwere carried out in accordance with the approved\nguidelines.\nClinical Examination\nAll participants in this study underwent a series of struc-\ntured questionnaires and a comprehensive neurological\nand neuropsychological assessment undertaken at the\nMovement Disorders Unit by three experienced move-\nment disorder specialist (JFM-M, JRM, and AB). The\nfollowing standardized protocol was used: (a) demo-\ngraphic variables; (b) personal and family history and gen-\neral medical health (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score\n[range: 0\u00ad42], total number of prescription medications);\n(c) neurological assessment: a subjective motor complains\nquestionnaire, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence\nscale, a motor examination including UPDRS part III and\na general examination in order to detect dystonia, myo-\nclonus, ataxia, and polyneuropathy as well as a specific\ntremor exploration that includes one test for postural\ntremor and five for kinetic tremor; (d) the use of medica-\ntion (yes vs. no); (e) additional variables of interest (e.g.,\nage of symptom onset); (f) the SCOPA-AUT assessment\nof autonomic dysfunction (Visser et al., 2004); and (g) the\nPittsburgh sleep quality index (Buysse et al., 1989). The\nMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) that assesses\ndifferent cognitive domains (http://www.mocatest.org/)\nwas used to determine possible cognitive dysfunction\nand DSM-IV criteria were used for diagnosis of depres-\nsion and anxiety disorders (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 1994). In addition to the standard clinical\nexploration described above, evaluation of ET was carried\nout by recording the drawing of an ``Archimedes spiral''\n(Elble et al., 1990) and using the Fahn\u00adTolosa\u00adMarin\ntremor rating scale (TRS; Fahn et al 2003). Surface elec-\ntromyography (EMG) was recorded from wrist extensor\nand flexor muscles using surface electrodes placed over the\nmuscle bellies 3 cm apart. The filters were set with a band-\npass of 10 Hz to 1 kHz. A triaxial accelerometer was\nplaced over the first dorsal interossei muscle of the\nhand. In an effort to minimize diagnostic pitfalls, clinical\ncriteria were comprehensively reviewed by the Consensus\nStatement of the Movement Disorder Society on Tremor\n(Deuschl et al., 1998) and the Washington Heights\u00ad\nInwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor criteria\npatient received a diagnosis of ET from a movement dis-\norders neurologist after the first evaluation which subse-\nquently was confirmed by consensus with the rest of the\nteam based on the review of the clinical data and electro-\nphysiological records from the second evaluation using\nthe formerly described diagnostic criteria. Criteria for\n2 ASN Neuro\ndefinitive ET included abnormal bilateral postural or kin-\netic tremor of the hands in the absence of other neuro-\nlogical symptoms.\nWES Approaches\nFour DNA samples from two affected (Cases 1 and 3)\nand two unaffected cases (Cases 2 and 4) were subject to\nWES analyses (Figure 1(a)). The SureSelect Human All\nexon 50 Mb exon-capture kit was used for library enrich-\nment (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and\ncaptured libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq2000\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions for paired-\nend 100-bp reads (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA), using a\nsingle flow cell lane per sample. Sequencing data were put\nthrough a computational pipeline for WES data process-\ning and analysis following the general workflow adopted\ndescribed elsewhere (Marti-Masso et al., 2013). Each\nexome's statistics were conducted in PICARD (http://\npicard.sourceforge.net/).\nFiltering of Common Genetic Variation\nAny potential mutation observed as common variation\nGenomes Project Phase 1, other public databases, such\nas the Exome Variant Server of the National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project\n(http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; Exome Variant\nServer, 2015), or exomes generated in house (Marti-\nMasso et al., 2013) was removed from further analyses.\nOnly genetic variants mapping to coding and splice site\nregions were considered causative.\n(a)\n(c)\nFigure 1.

The NCBI HomoloGene\ndatabase was used to examine the conservation of novel\nSNVs identified in different species (http://www.ncbi.\nnlm.nih.gov/homologene). The professional Human Gene\nMutation Database (https://portal.biobase-international.\ncom/hgmd/pro/start.php) and the NCBI ClinVar database\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) were used to deter-\nmine if novel single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were\nalready known to be associated with disease-related\nphenotypes.\nGene Screening Analyses\nGenomic primers for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\namplifications of the entire coding region and intron\u00ad\nexon boundaries of SORT1, LAPTM5 exon 5, and\nGRIN2D exon 13 were designed using a primer design\npublic website (http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/ExonPrimer.html;\nprimer sequences available upon request). All purified\nPCR products were sequenced in both forward and\nreverse directions by Sanger sequencing using Applied\nBiosystems BigDye terminator v3.1 sequencing chemistry\nas per the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed as\ndescribed elsewhere (Marti-Masso et al., 2013).\nMutagenesis and Cell-Culture Assays\nHuman embryonic kidney cells HEK293 were cultured in\nDulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with\n10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nduced into the human pCMV6-XL5-SORT1 wild-type\nplasmid (Origene, Rockville, MD) by site-directed muta-\ngenesis (QuikChangeII, Agilent Technologies, Santa\nClara, CA). All generated constructs were verified in\nboth directions by Sanger sequencing and using the\nhuman sequence GRCh37.p13 as a reference.\nculture plates. After reaching confluency ($80%), cells\nwere transiently transfected using FuGene 6\nTransfection Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) with\nmutant human plasmids. After 24 hr, culture media was\nreplaced and cells were treated independently with 10 ng/\nml or 30 ng/ml of two different pro-neurotrophics factors:\npro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) and pro-brain-\nderived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), or with a com-\nbination of both of them (Novoprotein, Summit, NJ).\nCells were then incubated at 37C for 72 hr except for\napoptosis assays in which a 16 h incubation was used.\nConditioned media was collected and cells were harvested.\nGene Expression Analyses\nRNA extraction from HEK293 cells was performed using\nthe RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as\nper manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was tran-\nscribed into cDNA with SuperScript II reverse transcript-\nase (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Gene\nexpression was carried out by qPCR using an Eco Real-\nTime PCR System (Illumina, San Diego, CA),\nSYBRGreen PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems,\nFoster City, CA), and the following oligonucleotide\nwere run in triplicates, analyzed using the standard curve\nmethod, and normalized to B2M housekeeping gene using\nImmunoblot Analyses\nLysates from cells were prepared in radioactive immuno-\nprecipitation assay buffer and treated with protease inhibi-\ntor cocktail. Equal amounts of proteins were added to\nLaemmli's buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), heated for\nBis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were\nthen transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in\nPhosphate Buffered Saline with Tween-20 (PBST), and\nincubated with primary antibody anti-SORT1 (1 mg/ml;\n(Abcam, Cambridge, MA; ab16640) and secondary anti-\nbody anti-Rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase\n(1:5000, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) was used as loading\ncontrol. Protein expression was detected by using\nLumminata Forte (Millipore, Billerica, MA), gel images\nwere obtained using a G:BOX Chemi image analyzer\n(Syngene, Frederick, MD), and densitometric analyses\nwere performed through the ImageJ software\n(imagej.nih.gov).\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\nHuman progranulin (hPGRN) in conditioned medium\nfrom wild-type and mutant HEK-293 cells was detected\nusing the DuoSet ELISA Development System kit (R&D\nSystems, Minneapolis, MN) following the\n4 ASN Neuro\nmanufacturer's protocol. The hPGRN from five human\nsamples (Cases 2\u00ad6; Figure 1(a)) was measured using the\nhPGRN ELISA kit from Adipogen (San Diego, CA).\nAbsorbance values were measured using a M5 multi-\nmodal plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)\nApoptosis Assay by Flow Cytometry Analysis\nQuantitative analysis of apoptotic cell death was done\nusing the Alexa Fluor\u00d5 488 Annexin V/Dead Cell\nApoptosis Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). HEK293 cells were treated\nwith 30 ng/ml of proneurotrophins (proNTs) for 16 hr;\ncells were then harvested, stained with Alexa Fluor\u00d5\n488-Annexin V and PI in annexin-binding buffer, and\nanalyzed by flow cytometry using a BD LSR II flow cyt-\nometer and the BD FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience,\nSan Jose, CA). Cells stained with only Annexin V were\nconsidered as being in early apoptosis, while cells stained\nwith both Annexin V and PI were considered to be in late\napoptosis or necrotic stage. HEK293 cells treated with\n2 mM of hydrogen peroxide were used as positive control\nfor apoptosis. Data analysis was performed using the\nFlowJo software version 9.3.2 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad\nPrism software version 6.00 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).\nData on graphs are presented as mean \u00c6 SEM. Statistical\ndifferences between wild-type and mutant were calculated\nby using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric U test. For\nSORT1 mRNA expression using different proNT con-\ncentrations, statistical significance was determined using\na linear regression model. Values of p .0001 were con-\nsidered highly significant (****).\nResults\nPhenotypic Examination of a Spanish Family With ET\nThe reported ET family, who consisted of two ``defini-\ntive'' affected individuals as well as four unaffected mem-\nbers (Figure 1(a)), featured postural tremor of both hands\nwith slow progression since childhood. Psychiatric fea-\ntures, such as depression and anxiety, were found in\none unaffected member. Detailed clinical descriptions of\nall family members examined are described below.\nCase 1. This is an affected male who was first seen in 2006\nwith postural and action tremor of both hands and without\nvoice, head, or rest tremors. He reported to have tremor with\nslow progression since childhood. No other signs of motor\nimpairment suggestive of parkinsonism, myoclonus,\ndystonia, ataxia, and polyneuropathy were identified, and\nhe did not show any sign of autonomic involvement, sleep\ndisorder (insomnia, drowsiness, REM sleep behavior disor-\nder (RBD)), anxiety, or depression. He did not take any\nmedication for tremor, but his tremor improved with alcohol\nintake. He reported hypercholesterolemia and had a myocar-\ndial infarction in 2000 and an atherothrombotic left pontine\nsubdural hematoma and intracranial fronto-temporal hemor-\nrhage at 73 years of age. He scored 36 in the TRS scale and\ning of right hand spiral is shown in Figure 2(a).\nCase 2. This is the wife of case 1 who did not show any sign\nof tremor or other neurological symptoms.\nCase 3. This is a 48-year-old woman who suffers from tremor\nof both hands since childhood. During examination, she\nshowed symmetric postural tremor involving hands without\nresting or action tremors and without affecting head, voice,\nand trunk. Her gait was normal and no clinical signs of par-\nkinsonism, myoclonus, dystonia, ataxia, and polyneuropathy\nwere found. She did not present any sign of autonomic\ninvolvement, sleep disorder (insomnia, drowsiness, RBD),\nanxiety, or depression. She scored 11 in the TRS scale and\nshowed normal cognitive status with a MoCA value of 30/30\nand a normal brain MRI. EMG recorded a postural tremor of\n9.5 Hz of frequency and 46 mV of amplitude. Her total chol-\nesterol was 244 mg/dl and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\ncholesterol levels were slightly elevated (176 mg/dl). Her\ndrawing of right hand spiral is shown in Figure 2(b).\nCase 4. This is a 46-year-old woman who reported having\nmild tremor of both hands during her childhood when she\nwas a regular tobacco smoker, but it greatly improved after\nsmoking withdrawal. On a recent examination, she showed no\ntremor and a normal cognitive status (MoCA \u00bc 30/30). Her\nbrain MRI, total cholesterol, and LDL levels were normal.\nCase 5. This is a 43-year-old man who apparently has not\nreported tremor or an EMG-recorded tremor. His brain MRI\nwas normal and showed a MoCA value of 30/30. He has\nhigh levels of total cholesterol and LDL and is under treat-\nment with atorvastatine 20 mg/day.\nCase 6. This is 67-year-old woman who has had anxiety and\ndepression symptoms for 15 years and is being treated with\n20 mg/day of paroxetine. On examination, she showed no\ntremor and her cognitive assessments (MoCA \u00bc 30/30) and\nLDL levels were normal.\nNone of the unaffected cases (Cases 4, 5, 6) showed\nany sign of motor involvement suggestive of parkinson-\nism, myoclonus, dystonia, ataxia, and polyneuropathy,\nnor nonmotor symptoms such as autonomic involvement,\nsleep disorders, anxiety, or depression.\nSa\n\u00b4nchez et al. 5\nWES and Subsequent Analyses\nWES approaches performed in four family members cap-\nthe target exome at 20-fold coverage or higher.\nApproximately 1,000 novel, coding SNVs, including\nonly missense and nonsense genetic variants, were iden-\ntified in each family member sequenced: 1062 SNVs were\nand 884 for Case 4. After adequate filtering and by keep-\ning SNVs only shared by both affected individuals, we\nwere left with six SNVs as potential disease-associated\nmutations. Two of these were not validated through\nSanger sequencing and the other four were also present\nin the youngest family member (Case 5), who is appar-\nently unaffected at his 43 years of age. Because the\nexistence of a variable age at onset is common in families\nwith tremor, every unaffected individual younger than 50\nyears should still be considered at risk (Merner et al.,\nnicity-matched normal chromosomes, but only one was\nfound present in the control population. A DNA sample\nfrom an additional unaffected member (Case 6) was then\nacquired and tested for these three novel SNVs; she was\nfound to be a noncarrier for any of them. By using four\ndifferent computational programs, only two SNVs were\npredicted to be deleterious by all programs. Although\none of this (p.Gly171Ala) was reported with very low\nConsortium (ExAC) that contains exome data for a var-\niety of rare diseases including rare neuromuscular dis-\neases (ExAC, 2015), none of them were reported in the\nX (cm)\nY (cm)\nX (cm)\nY (cm)\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2. Archimedes spirals. Right hand spirals of affected Case 1 (a) and Case 3 (b) are shown. Archimedes spirals were drawn on a\ndigitizing tablet.\n6 ASN Neuro\nEuropean population. These two SNVs were also highly\nconserved across different species while the other one\nreported in European population (ExAC data) and situ-\nated in the GRIN2D gene, which encodes a class of iono-\ntropic glutamate receptor and has been associated with\nschizophrenia susceptibility in the Japanese population\n(Makino et al., 2005), was not. The two pathogenic-pre-\ndicted, highly conserved SNVs were located within\nLAPTM5 and SORT1 genes (Table 1; Figure 1(b) and\n(c)). The LAPTM5 gene encodes for a lysosomal-asso-\nciated multispanning membrane protein that is known to\nbe associated with spontaneous regression of neuroblast-\nomas, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and lung cancer\n2009). The SORT1 gene encodes for sortilin, a member\nof a family of cellular vacuolar protein sorting 10\ndomain receptors that is expressed in neurons of the cen-\ntral nervous system, including cortical, hippocampal,\nand cerebellar neurons, and peripheral nervous system.\nSORT1 is known to regulate both neuronal viability and\nfunction through its regulation of both protein transport\nand signal transduction (Willnow et al., 2008) and is\nknown to bind proNTs to control neuronal survival\nand cessation (Nykjaer and Willnow, 2012). Sortilin,\nwhich has multifunctional roles in intracellular traffick-\ning of polipeptide from the golgy apparatus to secretory\nand endocytic pathways (Nielsen et al., 2001; Chen et al.,\n2005), has already been implicated in Alzheimer's disease\n(AD) and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration. In AD,\nsortilin has been shown to represent a major endocytic\npathway for the clearance of apoE/Ab complexes (Carlo\net al., 2013) and to control APP processing to Ab\n(Gustafsen et al., 2013), while in fronto-temporal lobar\ndegeneration it has been shown to regulate extracellular\nlevels of progranulin (PGRN; Hu et al., 2010). Sortilin\nhas also been postulated as a risk factor for hyperchol-\nesterolemia and myocardial infarction (Musunuru et al.,\n2010). Interestingly, all of our SORT1 mutation carriers\nwere shown later to carry elevated levels of LDL chol-\nesterol, suggesting a possible role of cholesterol homeo-\nstasis in the pathogenesis of tremor.\nThe entire coding region of SORT1 was then examined\nno pathogenic mutation was identified. Likewise, the\nexon 4 containing the SORT1 mutation (p.Gly171Ala)\nwas tested in additional 90 ET cases (28 familial ET\nand 62 sporadic), but no additional mutation carrier\nwas identified.\nFunctional Assays\nThe SORT1 p.G171A mutation downregulates its mRNA and\nprotein expression levels. To further test the pathogenecity\nfected with either wild-type or mutant (p.G171A) plasmids\nand quantitative PCR (qPCR) on cDNA extracted from wild-\ntype and mutant cells was carried out. Sortilin mRNA levels\ncells were found nearly three-fold lower in p.G171A muta-\ntion carriers than in noncarriers (p < .0001; Figure 3(a)), and\na similar decrease of two-fold between wild-type and mutant\ncells was observed at the protein level (p < .05; Figure 3(b)).\nBecause sortilin binds to the prodomains of both proNGF\nand proBDNF to regulate sorting of mature NGF and BDNF\nto appropriate endocytic and secretory pathways (Chen et al.,\n2005), transfected cells were also treated with proNGF,\nproBDNF, and with a combination of proNGF/proBNDF.\nSortilin downregulation was consistent in both treated and\nuntreated cells, suggesting that the treatment with proNTs\nhas no effect on its mutant-related differential expression\n(Figure 3(a)\u00ad(c)).\nmutant cells. Given the role of sortilin in proNGF- and\nproBDNF-induced neuronal apoptosis via its interaction\nthe effects of the SORT1 p.G171A mutation on mRNA and\nprotein expression levels, we sought to determine whether\nthis mutation may also alter the p75NTR mRNA levels and\nthe levels of apoptosis. The expression of p75NTR in untrans-\nfected cells was first tested by direct qPCR: HEK293 cells\nexpressed p75NTR, and then examined in both wild-type and\nmutant SORT1 transfected cells: p75NTR mRNA levels were\nsignificantly increased in mutant cells when compared with\ntheir wild-type counterparts (Figure 4(a); p < .05, p < .01).\nThis increase was more significant in cells treated with\nproBDNF and proNGF/proBDNF (p < .01). Although a\nslightly increase in apoptotic levels was found in p.G171A\nmutant cells treated with proNGF and proNGF/proBDNF\ntogether, these differences were not statistically significant\n(Figure 4(b)).\nPGRN levels are not altered in SORT1 mutant cells or human\nmutation carriers. An exciting area of research is the role of\nsortilin function in the metabolism of PGRN beacuse sor-\ntilin has been shown to regulate extracellular levels of\nPGRN in vivo (Hu et al., 2010) and in vitro (Lee et al.,\nmutation, which downregulates SORT1 mRNA and protein\nlevels and upregulates p75NTR mRNA levels, may also be\nassociated with increased PGRN levels in culture and\nhuman serum samples, PGRN levels were measured by\nELISA. No differences in PGRN levels between wild-\ntype and mutant cells (Figure 5(a)) and SORT1 p.G171A\nmutation carriers versus noncarriers (p \u00bc .65; Figure 5(b))\nwere found.\nDiscussion\nDespite significant efforts made to identify the genetic\nbasis of ET, the results are limited with linkage,\nSa\n\u00b4nchez et al. 7\nTable 1.

A\nhighly significant reduction of mRNA and sortilin\nexpression levels was observed in mutant cells when com-\npared with their wild-type counterparts (Figure 3(a) and\n(b)), suggesting that the SORT1 p.G171A mutation iden-\ntified in our ET patients is implicated in sortilin dysregu-\nlation. Since the expression of p75NTR, which binds to\nsortilin to mediate neuronal cell death (Nykjaer et al.,\n2004) and modulates cholinergic transmission (Yang\net al., 2002), was also found significantly elevated in\nmutant cells when compared with wild-type (Figure\n4(a)), one may commend that under pathological condi-\ntions dysregulation of sortilin may upregulate p75NTR\nexpression levels. Considering that p75NTR is not only\nupregulated in pathological conditions (Nykjaer et al.,\n2005) but also in impaired GABAergic transmission\n(Riffault et al., 2014), the sortilin deficiency caused by\nthe p.G171A mutation might also be responsible for\ndefects in neurotransmission, resulting in both the devel-\nopment of tremor and high p75NTR expression.\nGiven the role of sortilin as a principal neuronal bind-\ning site for PGRN and that a dramatic consequence of\nsuch binding is the rapid endocytosis of PGRN by sortilin\n(Hu et al., 2010), extracellular PGRN levels were also\nexamined. Although PGRN levels were not disrupted in\nmutant cells versus wild-type (Figure 5(a)) or in mutation\ncarriers versus noncarriers (Figure 5(b)), it has previously\nbeen reported that SORT1 mutants known to disrupt\nendocytosis do not have altered PGRN levels (Nielsen\nUntreated\nproNGF\nproNGF/proBDNF\n**** **** **** ****\n(a)\n(c)\nCells treated with proBDNF (ng/ml)\nCells treated with proNGF/proBDNF (ng/ml)\nCells treated with proNGF (ng/ml)\n(b)\nUntreated\nproNGF\nproNGF/proBDNF\nProtein expression of SORT1\n** ** ** **\nUntreated cells\nproNGF\ntreated cells\ntreated cells\nproNGF/proBDNF\ntreated cells\nGAPDH\nFigure 3.

Values represent the mean \u00c6 SEM.\nSa\n\u00b4nchez et al. 9\nthat our SORT1 mutation could still affect sortilin-\nmediated endocytosis, sorting, and trafficking, regardless\nof its effect on PGRN levels.\nLastly, noncoding SORT1 variation has recently been\nassociated with high cholesterol levels and heart diseases\n(Musunuru et al., 2010). There are mounting evidence\nthat aberrations in cholesterol homeostasis can lead to\nsevere neurological diseases and impairments in synaptic\nplasticity (Lane-Donovan et al., 2014); along these lines,\nhigh levels of serum total cholesterol have been associated\nwith an increased risk for Parkinson's disease in Finnish\npopulation (Hu et al., 2008). The importance of choles-\nterol homeostasis for brain function was first highlighted\nby Niemann-Pick type C disease, in which pathogenic\nmutations result in impaired cholesterol trafficking and\nprogressive neurodegeneration (Carstea et al., 1997;\nNaureckiene et al., 2000). The association of a specific\napolipoprotein E allele (\"4) with the risk for both spor-\nadic and familial AD also raised the possibility that dys-\nfunction in the lipid transport system may cause defects\nin the brain lipid homeostasis of AD patients (Poirier\net al., 2014). Nowadays, it is known that lipoprotein\nreceptors, which participate in synapse development,\ncargo trafficking, and signal transduction, are key players\nin AD pathogenesis and neurodegeneration; indeed, the\nassociation between impaired lipid metabolism and brain\ndiseases including but not limited to AD, PD and\nHuntington's disease is well reported and documented\nIn conclusion, we here identified a disease-segregating\nSORT1 mutation in a small family with early-onset ET\n(Figure 1(a)).
