This study estimated the prevalence in 2004\nof self-reported diagnosis of diabetes and other conditions in a community-based population, using\ndata from the Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to\nDiabetes (SHIELD).\nMethods: The initial screening questionnaire was mailed in 2004 to a stratified random sample of\n200,000 households in the US, to identify individuals, age  18 years of age, with diabetes or risk\nfactors associated with diabetes. Follow-up disease impact questionnaires were then mailed to a\nrepresentative, stratified random sample of individuals (n = 22,001) in each subgroup of interest\n(those with diabetes or different numbers of risk factors for diabetes). Estimated national\nprevalence of diabetes and other conditions was calculated, and compared to prevalence estimates\nResults: Response rates were 63.7% for the screening, and 71.8% for the follow-up baseline\nsurvey. The SHIELD screening survey found overall prevalence of self-reported diagnosis of\ndiabetes (either type 1 or type 2) was 8.2%, with increased prevalence with increasing age and\ndecreasing income.

When comparing results from the\nSHIELD screening survey (self-report only) to those from NHANES 1999\u00ad2002 (self-report,\nclinical and laboratory evaluations), the prevalence of diabetes was similar. SHIELD allows the\nidentification of respondents with and without a current diagnosis of the illness of interest, and\npotential longitudinal evaluation of risk factors for future diagnosis of that illness.\nBackground\nStudies have shown that the prevalence of diagnosed dia-\nbetes mellitus (DM) in the US is increasing. Mokdad et\nal.[1], using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-\nlance System (BRFSS), a cross-sectional telephone survey\nconducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion and state health departments, showed that the preva-\nlence of self-reported diagnosis of DM increased from\nUsing data from four consecutive National Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys, Kanjilal et al. [3] showed\na similar, significant increase in prevalence of self-\nreported diagnosis of DM, as well as a significant increase\nin total (diagnosed and undiagnosed) prevalence of DM.\nFurther, they showed that DM prevalence increased most\namong persons with lower income and education levels\nThe purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence\nin 2004 of self-reported diagnosis of DM and prevalence\nof specific risk factors associated with diabetes in a com-\nmunity-based population. Additionally, individuals with\nrisk factors for diabetes were identified to determine sim-\nilarities and differences with diabetes patients. SHIELD\n(Study to Help Improve Earlyevaluation and manage-\nment of risk factors Leading to Diabetes), the largest sur-\nvey of its kind, began with an initial cross-sectional\nsnapshot of the US population, followed by longitudinal\nquestionnaires designed to evaluate parameters poten-\ntially related to DM, and is the first prospective study to\nexamine select risk factors (RFs) for future diagnoses of\nDM. This study was also designed to provide insight into\nhealth-related knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes as well\nas their implications for individuals' transitions to a DM\ndiagnosis and progression of DM treatments. The SHIELD\ndesign and methodology are described herein, along with\nthe initial, cross-sectional results of parameters related to\nDM compared with findings from the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999\u00ad\nMethods\nSHIELD consists of three phases: 1) an initial screening,\ncross-sectional survey that used a general population\nscreening questionnaire to identify cases of interest; 2) the\nbaseline survey, in which the identified respondents were\nfollowed up longitudinally with a longer, more detailed\nquestionnaire assessing each individual's health status,\nhealth knowledge and attitudes, and current behaviors\nand treatments; and 3) annual follow-up questionnaires\nto assess disease progression, which encompassed a) tran-\nsition from at risk status to diagnosed DM, b) progression\nof treatment over the course of the disease, and c) the\nassociated clinical and economic burden. Results from the\nfirst two phases are presented here. Respondents volun-\nteered to complete the surveys without compensation.\nScreening questionnaire\nThe initial screening questionnaire was mailed in April\nholds in the US. These households were a part of the Tay-\nlor Nelson Sofres National Family Opinion, Inc. (TNS\nNFO) survey panel, which is a market research firm that\nmaintains a panel of households throughout the US for\nmarketing and research purposes. The panel was con-\nstructed to be representative of the US population in terms\nof residence (including both geographic region and\nhousehold area population size), age of the head of\nhousehold and household income and size. The require-\nments for participation included being 18 years of age and\nhaving a telephone and mailing address. Random sam-\nples of households were invited to enroll in the panel, and\ndemographic information was obtained from those who\nenroll (and updated every 2 years). Households who\nagreed to participate were invited to take part in periodic\nsurveys. The NFO panel has been used previously to deter-\nmine general population prevalence of migraine [4,5],\nbipolar disorder [6], disease related impairment [7-9],\nand depression and comorbidity in epilepsy and asthma\nThe SHIELD screening survey used 12 questions created\nby an expert advisory panel to identify individuals with\nDM (and type of DM) or RFs associated with a diagnosis\nof DM. After being mailed, the screening questionnaire\nwas completed by the head of the household who\nanswered for up to four adult members of the household\n(18 years of age). The head of household was identified\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nas the individual who is the panel member for the NFO\npanel and typically was the adult female of the household.\nDue to the self-administration approach, the head of\nhousehold was able to consult with other adult family\nmembers and personal health records to report whether\nthey or any adult member had been told by their doctor\nor nurse that they had any of the conditions.\nRisk factors (RFs) associated with diabetes mellitus\nIn addition to self-reported DM, the screening question-\nnaire included the following items: age, family history,\nadiposity (as measured by body mass index [BMI]) and\npresence of potential DM-related predictors such as\nabdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and car-\ndiovascular disease (CVD) events. The SHIELD data were\nanalyzed and compared with overall prevalence estimates\nreported and laboratory values). The following factors\nwere hypothesized to be associated with a diagnosis of\nDM: (1) abdominal obesity (waist circumference), (2) over-\nweight/obesity (BMI, calculated from self-reported height\nand weight), (3) cholesterol problems (reported diagnosis of\ncholesterol problems of any type), (4) hypertension\n(reported diagnosis of high blood pressure), and (5) his-\ntory of CVD (\"heart disease/myocardial infarction, narrow\nor blocked arteries, stroke, coronary artery bypass graft\nsurgery/angioplasty/stents/surgery to clear arteries\").\nRespondents were provided with a measuring tape and\nwhile standing were asked to hold the tape measure\nloosely around their waist at the level of their navel\n(\"belly button\") to determine waist circumference.\nThese CVD parameters were confirmed using logistic\nregression analyses on the SHIELD screening data, which\nindicated that each RF had independent and similar pre-\ndictive power for diagnosis of DM. Specific thresholds for\nwaist circumference and BMI were determined as\ndescribed below in \"Data Analysis.\"\nSampling for baseline survey\nOnce the screening questionnaire was returned, baseline\n(BL) follow-up disease impact questionnaires were\nmailed in September and October of 2004 to a represent-\native stratified random sample of individuals based upon\nseveral subgroups of interest, which included: (1) type 1\nDM (defined as reported type 1 diagnosis made at age 21\nyears plus insulin use), (2) type 2 DM (defined as reported\ntype 2 diagnosis made at age >21 years), and (3) individ-\n12% of baseline survey respondents were from the same\nhousehold and the correlation between responses for\nindividuals from the same household was minimal (r <\n0.03) and not statistically significant. After the BL ques-\ntionnaires were returned, a subgroup of 600 responses\nwas created from the total response pool to represent a\ngeneral population sample for comparison with the DM\nand RF groups. This \"population-based\" control group\nsampled returns from the type 1 and type 2 DM groups\nand each RF level in proportions to reflect the overall prev-\nalence of that stratum in the general population. This\ngroup was constructed by stratified random sampling\n(without replacement) of 600 individuals from within the\ndisease and RF groups in proportion to their rates of\noccurrence in the population (as estimated from the\nscreening study).\nBaseline (BL) questionnaire\nThe BL questionnaire consisted of 64 detailed questions\nregarding comorbidities, symptoms, and family history;\nmedical testing; health-related quality of life, depression\nand health-related disruptions of normal activities; diet,\nexercise and other health-related behaviors; healthcare\ninsurance coverage and resource use; and impact of health\nproblems on work productivity.\nThe BL questionnaire also included several validated sur-\nvey instruments including: (1) the 12-item Short Form\nHealth Survey [11] (SF-12v2;) and the European Quality\nof Life (EuroQoL) EQ-5D instrument [12-15] to assess\nquality of life; (2) Sheehan Disability Scale [16] to assess\nthe level of disruption felt in work, social life, and family/\nhome life due to health problems; (3) 9-item Patient\nHealth Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [17] to assess depression;\nand (4) the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment\nQuestionnaire: General Health, version 2.0 (WPAI-GH)\nto assess work productivity and performance of other reg-\nular activities [18].\nIn addition, the questionnaire included some, but not all,\nquestions from the following instruments: the Diet and\nHealth Knowledge Survey (DHKS), the Press-Ganey Satis-\nfaction Questionnaire, and the International Physical\nActivity Questionnaire (IPAQ), which was developed to\nassess health-related aspects of physical activity and sed-\nentary behaviors [19].\nData analysis\nEstimated national prevalence of DM and each RF was cal-\nculated using SHIELD and NHANES data. Logistic regres-\nsion analyses of the SHIELD screening data with diagnosis\nof type 2 DM as the dependent variable and sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics and RFs as explanatory variables\nwere used to identify those factors associated with being\ndiagnosed with type 2 DM. In addition, specific thresh-\nolds for waist circumference and BMI were determined\nseparately for men and women, using the area under\nreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to quantify\nsensitivity and specificity. The waist circumference or BMI\nvalue that maximized the area under the ROC curve was\nchosen as the threshold (point that maximized the\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nnumber of people correctly classified as diabetes or not)\nfor determining whether that RF (i.e., \"abdominal obes-\nity\" or \"high BMI\") was present. Odds ratios around the\nthreshold were stable. The ROC analysis was done to\ndetermine diabetes-specific thresholds for obesity (BMI)\nand abdominal obesity (waist circumference) rather than\nusing the continuous variable for these factors; and the\nROC model with the continuous variables was only\nslightly improved over the dichotomous variable. The\nsensitivity of the model predicting diabetes (duration  3\nROC curves for abdominal obesity found an optimal cut-\noff value at waist circumference  97 cm for men and waist\ncircumference  89 cm for women. For BMI, the optimal\nthreshold value was  28 kg/m2 in both men and women.\nRF levels were calculated as the unweighted number of\nRFs reported by each respondent on the screening ques-\ntionnaire. For example, if a person reported three RFs on\nthe screening questionnaire, they were classified into RF\nlevel 3. Most analyses of the SHIELD BL data reported here\ngrouped individuals into cohorts with lower risk (0\u00ad2\nRFs) or higher risk (3\u00ad5 RFs). Data reported here reflect\nthe sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents\nto the BL survey and the occurrence rates of each RF\namong our respondent subgroups.\nResults\nResponse rates and analyzed cohort\na response rate of 63.7% for the screening survey.

US census data are also included for comparison.\nYounger age groups, African Americans, and Asian Amer-\nicans were generally under-represented in the study popu-\nlation, compared with US census data.\nWith some exceptions, in general, the sociodemographic\ncharacteristics of the population sample group and US\ncensus data were similar to those seen in the 0\u00ad2 RF\ngroup. In contrast, at least with regard to age, income, and\nhousehold size, the 3\u00ad5 RF group had sociodemographic\ncharacteristics more similar to the type 2 DM group. The\ntype 1 DM group tended to be younger and the type 2 DM\ngroup tended to be older than the population sample. In\nsummary, the 3\u00ad5 RF and type 2 DM groups tended to be\nolder, and to have lower incomes and smaller household\nsize compared to the 0\u00ad2 RF group, population control\nsample, and US census. The lower income and smaller\nhousehold size relationship for the 3\u00ad5 RF and type 2 DM\ngroups remained even with age stratification.\nRF proportions\nThe proportion of respondents with individual RFs within\neach subgroup of interest are shown in Table 3. The type\n1 DM group had similar proportions of abdominal obes-\nity and BMI 28 as the population sample and the 0\u00ad2 RF\ngroups. Both the type 1 and type 2 DM subgroups had a\nhigher likelihood of being diagnosed with dyslipidemia,\nhypertension, and CVD events (perhaps in part related to\nmore intensive medical evaluations once being diagnosed\nwith DM) compared to the population sample and 0\u00ad2 RF\ngroup. The type 2 DM group and the 3\u00ad5 RF group had\ngenerally similar individual RF proportions and a similar\naverage number of risk factors. Approximately 78% of the\ntype 2 DM group had 3\u00ad5 risk factors. Finally, within each\nsubgroup, CVD was the least frequently reported RF.\nDiscussion\nThe SHIELD design allowed for a very large, community-\nbased sample with broad demographic representation of\nthe population of interest. The use of the TNS NFO house-\nhold survey panel also resulted in a high response rate for\nTable 3: Proportion of respondents with risk factors and by diabetes group\nRisk Factor Population Sample Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes Mellitus 0\u00ad2 RFs 3\u00ad5 RFs\nCardiovascular\nNumber of Risk\nFactors\nBMI = body mass index\n(page number not for citation purposes)\na written survey. The completion of the questionnaire in\nthe home setting allowed for thoughtful answers and for\ntime to check records and medications for accurate report-\ning. In addition, the respondents could work at their pace,\nand there was no interviewer bias. Any sampling bias due\nto demographics can be measured and adjusted for in the\nfinal analysis. Finally, the survey allowed the identifica-\ntion of respondents without a current diagnosis of the ill-\nness of interest, and potential longitudinal evaluation of\nRFs for future diagnosis of that illness.\nSHIELD consists of a cross-sectional, and then 5-year lon-\ngitudinal observational study of individuals with or at risk\nfor DM. A large number of the cross-sectional, screening\nquestionnaires were sent and a high return rate was\nachieved, providing a sample that was generally represent-\native of the overall US population. The BL survey was\ndesigned to provide a more detailed view of DM and other\nhealth conditions in a large sample that will be followed\nover 4 subsequent annual surveys. The overall response\nrate for the BL survey (80%) was also quite high for a\nlarge, mailed survey.\nDemographically, the population sample was generally\nsimilar to US census data, indicating that the SHIELD\nresults are representative and generalizable to the US pop-\nulation. The population sample and the 0\u00ad2 RF groups\nwere also similar to each other. One important result from\nthis survey was the similarity of the 3\u00ad5 RF and the type 2\nDM groups. Results from SHIELD reveal that the mean\nnumber of RFs increases with age, as does the likelihood\nof being diagnosed with DM. The proportion of individ-\nual RFs was highest in the type 2 DM and 3\u00ad5 RF groups,\nwith somewhat higher percentages for each of the five\nindividual RFs in the 3\u00ad5 RF group as compared with the\ntype 2 DM group. The 3\u00ad5 RF group has not been diag-\nnosed with diabetes but they appear similar to the type 2\nDM group, which is not explained by age stratification.\nThis finding may indicate the importance of managing the\nrisk factors in the 3\u00ad5 RF group to delay or prevent diabe-\ntes. Importantly, in follow-up surveys, it may be possible\nto determine which RFs in those persons without DM best\ncorrelate to a future diagnosis of DM. The similarity in\nprevalence rates of DM between SHIELD and NHANES\nconfirm that surveys like SHIELD, with self-reported diag-\nnoses, acquire data approximating surveys that also\ninclude clinical and laboratory evaluations.\nThe lower prevalence of dyslipidemia and abdominal\nobesity in SHIELD versus NHANES may be largely due to\nthe use of laboratory data (cholesterol levels) and inter-\nviewer measurement in NHANES compared with only\nself-report in SHIELD. For diagnoses that are dependent\non laboratory evaluations, particularly when more than\none laboratory parameter is used to define a specific diag-\nnosis (such as dyslipidemia), self-report surveys may\nunderestimate the true prevalence of these diagnoses.\nMultivariate analysis indicated that smaller household\nsize, population size and the US South were independ-\nently associated with a higher likelihood of type 2 DM\ndiagnosis. These associations may be due to differences in\ndiet, lifestyle habits, access to medical and/or diabetes\ncare and limited family support.\nIt should be noted that panel data have some limitations.\nFor example, only a small percentage (5%\u00ad8%) of con-\nsumers invited to participate in the NFO panel elected to\ndo so, leading to the possibility of bias. Household panels\ntend to under-represent the very wealthy and very poor\nsegments of the population, and do not include military\nor institutionalized individuals. However, these limita-\ntions are true for most random sampling and clinically\nbased methodologies as well.\nAnother limitation is that data collected by self-reported\nsurveys cannot always be directly compared to clinical\nand laboratory surveys, such as NHANES data. This is\nespecially true in trying to assess clustering of CVD risk\nfactors.\nCurrently, further analyses of the screening and BL survey\ndata are in progress, to investigate differences in health\nattitudes and behaviors between survey respondents with\ntype 1 and type 2 DM and those with 3\u00ad5 RFs. It is antici-\npated that the long-term, longitudinal data from SHIELD\nwill allow for continued clarification of predictors of\nbeing tested for or being diagnosed with DM. In addition,\nit is possible that SHIELD data may help identify those\nRFs (and health attitudes and behaviors) that are most\npredictive of transitioning from one stage of DM to the\nnext (disease progression) and from one stage of DM\ntreatment to the next (treatment progression).\nConclusion\nWhen comparing results from the SHIELD screening sur-\nclinical and laboratory evaluations), the prevalence of DM\nwas similar. In addition, the prevalence of DM observed\nin SHIELD increased with higher ages and lower income\nlevels. Multivariable analyses of the SHIELD baseline sur-\nvey data found that abdominal obesity, higher BMI, and\ndiagnosis of cholesterol problems, hypertension or CVD\nwere each independently associated with higher likeli-\nhood of type 2 DM diagnosis. Other factors positively\nassociated with type 2 DM diagnosis were increased age,\nblack race, and decreased household income level.\nSHIELD is an ongoing self-reported survey study that\nbegan with a cross-sectional questionnaire, followed by\ntargeted longitudinal surveys, and is the largest survey of\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nits kind. Because a large number of questionnaires were\nsent with a high return rate achieved, the SHIELD survey\nachieved a large sample that is representative of the over-\nall US population. SHIELD provides information that is\nunique from data more commonly reported, especially\nregarding the longitudinal follow-up on a large sample,\nwhich may allow correlation of RFs with the future diag-\nnosis of DM.\nCompeting interests\nDr. Harold Bays, in almost two decades of clinical\nresearch, has served as a Clinical Investigator for (and has\nreceived research grants from) pharmaceutical companies\nsuch as Abbott, Alteon, Arena, AstraZeneca, Aventis,\nBayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Boehringer Mannheim,\nBristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Esperion, Fujisawa, Ciba\nGeigy, GelTex, Glaxo, Genentech, Hoechst Roussel, KOS,\nKowa, Lederle, Marion Merrell Dow, Merck, Merck Scher-\ning Plough, Miles, Novartis, Parke Davis, Pfizer, Pliva,\nPurdue, Reliant, Roche, Rorer, Regeneron, Sandoz, San-\nkyo, Sanofi, Searle, Shionogi, Schering Plough, SmithK-\nline Beecham, Takeda, TAP, UpJohn, Upsher Smith,\nWarner Lambert, and Wyeth-Ayerst.
