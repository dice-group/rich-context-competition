These people have el-\nevated prevalence of other mental disor-\nders.6,11 They report greater impairment,\nuse of psychotropic medication, and psy-\nchiatric help-seeking than people with\nmany Axis I disorders.8 Such findings have\nled to the view that PAs are fairly nonspe-\ncific risk markers for psychopathology.12\nSome people with isolated PAs meet cri-\nteria for agoraphobia (AG).13 It is not\nknown, though, whether the persistent\ncourse and poor outcome associated with\nAG among people with PD14 also apply to\nPAs with AG. As a result, the boundary be-\ntween PA and PD and the relative role of\nAG within each are not well understood.\nInvestigation and comparison of these\nsymptom presentations in community\nsamplesmighthelpclarifytheseissues.The\ncurrent report presents initial data of this\nsort from the recently completed US Na-\ntional Comorbidity Survey Replication\n(NCS-R).\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe NCS-R is a nationally representative sur-\nvey of 9282 English-speaking household resi-\ndents18yearsorolderinthecoterminousUnited\nStates.

The hu-\nman subjects committees of Harvard Medical School (Boston,\nMass) and the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) approved the\nNCS-R recruitment and consent procedures. Respondents were\ninterviewed in 2 parts. The part 1 interview, administered to all\nrespondents, included the core diagnostic assessment. The part\n2 interview, administered to all part 1 respondents who met cri-\nteria for any lifetime core disorder plus a probability subsample\nof others (for a total of 5692 part 2 respondents), was used to as-\nsess correlates and disorders of secondary interest. The part 1\nsample is used here to examine prevalence and course, clinical\nseverity and role impairment, and most aspects of comorbidity.\nThe part 2 sample is used to examine comorbidity with disor-\nders of secondary interest to the survey, sociodemographic cor-\nrelates, and treatment. The part 1 sample was weighted to adjust\nfor differential probability of selection and discrepancies be-\ntween the sample and the US population concerning census so-\nciodemographic and geographic variables. The part 2 sample was\nweighted additionally to adjust for differential probability of se-\nlection from the part 1 sample. More details on NCS-R sampling\nand weights are reported elsewhere.15\nPanic and AG were assessed using the World Mental Health\nSurvey Initiatiave version of the World Health Organization\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),16 a fully\nstructured lay-administered diagnostic interview (available at\nwww.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmhcidi). The assessment of panic\nwas comparable to that in previous versions of the CIDI, ex-\ncept that a distinction was made between uncued PAs (de-\nscribed as occurring \"out of the blue\" with no triggering event)\nand cued PAs. A series of parallel questions was asked about\neach of these 2 types of attacks. Panic disorder was defined as\nthe occurrence of 4 or more uncued PAs not caused by sub-\nstance use or a general medical condition accompanied by\n1 month or more of persistent concern about recurrence, worry\nabout the implications of the attacks, or significant change in\nbehavior because of the attacks. Agoraphobia was defined as\nanxiety about 2 or more situations that had to include being in\ncrowds, going to public places, traveling by yourself, or traveling\naway from home associated with a fear of having a PA and fear\nthat it might be difficult or embarrassing to escape. This fear\nhad to result in avoidance of the feared situations, distress when\nexposed to these situations, or the necessity of a companion\nduring these situations. We used these classifications to de-\nfine 4 subgroups for comparative analysis: PA without PD or\nAG (PA only), PA with PD and AG (PA-AG), PD without AG\n(PD only), and PD with AG (PD-AG). The PA-only category is\nnot a codable DSM-IV12 disorder; PA-AG is a subset of the\nDSM-IV category AG without a history of PD, excluding respon-\ndents with AG who never had a PA. This latter subgroup is not\nconsidered in this report because we focus exclusively on people\nwith a history of panic.\nAs detailed elsewhere,17,18 blinded clinical reappraisal in-\nterviews using the lifetime nonpatient version of the Struc-\ntured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)19 were adminis-\ntered to a probability subsample of 325 NCS-R respondents to\nassess concordance with CIDI diagnoses. The CIDI-SCID con-\ncordance for PD diagnosis had an area under the receiver op-\nerating characteristic curve of 0.72, a moderate  value (stan-\nthe CIDI prevalence estimate compared with that in the SCID\nby using a McNemar test (2\n=0, P=.82). The CIDI-SCID con-\ncordance was not assessed for PA because PA was not evalu-\nated separately in the SCID; concordance also was not as-\nsessed for AG because AG occurred too infrequently in the\nclinical reappraisal study for reliable analysis of concordance.\nThe DSM-IV requires recurrent uncued PAs, which could be in-\nterpreted as 2 or more, for a PD diagnosis. However, CIDI re-\nspondents who reported 2 or 3 lifetime uncued PAs generally\nwere found in the SCID to have had only 1 full PA with addi-\ntional limited-symptom attacks. Validity of the CIDI in rela-\ntion to the SCID consequently was improved when we re-\nquired at least 4 lifetime uncued attacks in the CIDI. The\nMcNemar test result documents that the CIDI PD prevalence\nestimate does not differ significantly from the SCID estimate\ndespite the SCID requiring only 2 attacks.\nRespondents who met DSM-IV lifetime criteria for PA were asked\nto estimate the age of onset (AOO) of their first attack and AOO\nof having 4 uncued attacks with a month of persistent worry.\nThey also were asked to estimate their age at the most recent\nattack, lifetime number of uncued and cued attacks, and num-\nber of years with at least 1 attack. Clinical severity was as-\nsessed only for 12-month cases by using a fully structured ver-\nsion of the 7-question Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) that\nwas developed specifically for the NCS-R. (Question wording\nis posted at www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs.) The clinician-\nadministered version of the PDSS yields a reliable and valid as-\nsessment of overall PD clinical severity.20 A separate fully struc-\ntured version of the PDSS, developed independently of the\nNCS-R version but with similar wording, has excellent con-\ncordance with the clinician-administered version.21 Published\nPDSS cut points (none, mild, moderate, or severe) were used\nto define severity.\nAlthough 2 of the 7 PDSS questions assess role impair-\nment, a more generic measure of role impairment, the Shee-\nhan Disability Scale (SDS),22 also was included in each section\nof the CIDI. The SDS asked respondents with 12-month panic\nto focus on the 1 month in the past year when their panic, their\nworry about having another PA, or their restriction of activity\nbecause of this worry interfered most with their life and activi-\nties and to rate this interference on a 0 to 10 visual analog scale\nwith response options of none (0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-\n6), severe (7-9), or very severe (10). Interference ratings were\nobtained for 4 role domains: home management, work, social\nlife, and personal relationships. Responses were combined by\ntaking the highest score across the 4 ratings and collapsing the\nsevere and very severe response categories.\nThe NCS-R was used to assess a number of other DSM-IV dis-\norders: other anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder,\nspecific phobia, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder,\nobsessive-compulsive disorder, and adult manifestations of sepa-\nration anxiety disorder), mood disorders (major depressive dis-\norder, dysthymic disorder, and bipolar disorder I or II), sub-\nstance use disorders (alcohol and illicit drug abuse and\ndependence, in which abuse and dependence on specific illicit\ndrugs were combined with polysubstance abuse and depen-\ndence), and impulse-control disorders (intermittent explosive\ndisorder and adult manifestations of 3 child-adolescent impulse-\ncontrol disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, op-\npositional-defiant disorder, and conduct disorder). Organic ex-\nclusion rules and diagnostic hierarchy rules were used in making\nall diagnoses. As reported in more detail elsewhere,18 blinded\nclinical reappraisal interviews using the nonpatient version of\nthe SCID19 showed generally good concordance between CIDI\nand SCID diagnoses of anxiety, mood, and substance use dis-\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.

Diagnoses of impulse-control\ndisorders were not validated because the SCID does not assess\nthese disorders.\nTREATMENT\nTwo questions about lifetime and 12-month treatment of panic\nwere asked at the end of the panic section. Part 2 respondents\nadditionally were asked more general questions about whether\nthey ever received treatment for any problems with your emo-\ntions or nerves or your use of alcohol or drugs and, if so, about\ntypes of professionals seen.23 Treatment was distinguished in\n5 sectors: psychiatry, nonpsychiatry mental health specialty,\ngeneral medical, human services, and complementary-\nalternative. Questions about treatment in the 12 months be-\nfore interview asked about number and duration of visits; num-\nber and duration of psychotherapy sessions; and name, dose,\nand duration of each medication used. No information was ob-\ntained about the content of psychotherapy. A rough measure\nof 12-month guideline-concordant treatment of panic was de-\nveloped using these reports on the basis of available evidence-\nbased guidelines.24 Guideline-concordant treatment was de-\nfined as receiving either pharmacotherapy (at least 2 months\nof an appropriate medication, defined as antidepressants or anx-\niolytics,25 plus at least 4 visits to any type of medical physi-\ncian) or psychotherapy (at least 8 visits with any health care\nor human services professional lasting an average of at least 30\nminutes). The decision to require at least 4 physician visits for\npharmacotherapy was based on the recommendation of at least\n4 visits for medication evaluation, initiation, and monitoring\nduring the early and continuation phases of PD medication treat-\nment.24 The decision to require at least 8 psychotherapy ses-\nsions was based on the fact that clinical trials demonstrating\neffectiveness generally have included at least 8 psychotherapy\nvisits.24 Because respondents who began a course of treatment\nonly shortly before the interview could not fulfill the require-\nments, we counted respondents with at least 2 visits to an ap-\npropriate treatment sector if they were in treatment at the time\nof interview.\nCross-tabulations were used to estimate prevalence and pat-\nterns of treatment. The actuarial method26 was used to esti-\nmate AOO distributions. Mean comparisons were used to ex-\namine illness course and severity or impairment. Logistic\nregression analysis27 was used to estimate associations with so-\nciodemographic variables and comorbid DSM-IV disorders. Be-\ncause the NCS-R sample design featured weighting and clus-\ntering, all analyses used the Taylor series design-based method,28\nimplemented in the SUDAAN software system.29 Significance\ntests of sets of coefficients in the logistic regression equations\nwere made using Wald 2 tests based on design-corrected co-\nefficient variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance\nwas evaluated using 2-sided, design-based P.05-level tests.\nRESULTS\nPREVALENCE\nTwenty-eight percent (standard error) (28.3% [1.0]) of re-\nspondents met criteria for lifetime PA and 11.2% (0.5) for\none sixth of those with lifetime PA) met criteria for life-\n1% of all respondents (roughly 3% of those with a life-\ntime PA) met criteria for lifetime PA-AG and 0.4% (0.1)\n(approximately one fifth of those with lifetime PD and 60%\nof those with lifetime PA-AG) met criteria for lifetime\nAs described, respondents with lifetime panic were\nplaced into 4 mutually exclusive subgroups (Figure 1):\nPA only, 22.7% of the sample; PA-AG, 0.8%; PD only,\n3.7%; and PD-AG, 1.1%.

First, the response rate was only 70%. As de-\nscribed in more detail elsewhere,15 we assessed this prob-\nlem in a nonrespondent survey in which a subsample of\ninitial nonrespondents was offered a large financial in-\ncentive ($100) to complete a short (15-minute) tele-\nphone interview that included CIDI diagnostic stem ques-\ntions. No significant difference was found in panic stem\nquestion endorsement compared with responses in the\nmain survey sample, indirectly arguing against large non-\nresponse bias on the basis of panic. Second, although good\nconcordance with SCID PD diagnoses was found, no va-\nlidity data were obtained for PA or AG. Third, possibly\nbiased information about AOO, persistence, and other\nimportant course and treatment variables were ob-\ntained retrospectively. As described in more detail else-\nwhere,16 a number of strategies were used in the NCS-R\nto reduce recall bias. Evidence exists that these strate-\ngies improved the accuracy of retrospective AOO re-\nports,30 but we have no data about effects on other as-\npects of recall.\nWith these limitations as a backdrop, the NCS-R life-\ntime prevalence estimates of DSM-IV PD and PD-AG (4.7%\nand 1.1%, respectively) are similar to the DSM-III-R1 es-\ntimates in the baseline NCS (3.5% and 1.5%, respec-\ntively). The NCS-R estimate of PD-only prevalence (3.7%)\nis substantially higher than in the NCS (2.0%).2 Al-\nthough higher than in earlier epidemiological surveys,31\nthe concordance of the NCS-R PD prevalence estimate\nwith an independent SCID estimate argues against up-\nward bias. In the case of AG, the concern is more with\ndownward than upward bias because the CIDI require-\nment of anxiety about multiple situations is stricter than\nthe DSM-IV requirement.\nEstimates of persistence, sociodemographic corre-\nlates, and psychiatric comorbidity are broadly consis-\ntent with the baseline NCS1,2,32 and other previous epi-\nis not possible because previous surveys did not disag-\ngregate panic into the 4 subgroups considered here. High\nprevalence among women, low prevalence among the el-\nderly, and strong comorbidity with other anxiety and\nmood disorders are all noteworthy consistencies with pre-\nvious survey findings. One notable difference is a much\nhigher estimated lifetime prevalence of PAs in the NCS-R\n(28.3%) than in the NCS (7.3%), a discrepancy presum-\nably caused by the more detailed stem questions in the\nDSM-IV version of the CIDI than in the DSM-III-R ver-\nsion that suggests PAs were underestimated in the base-\nline NCS.\nWe are aware of no previous general population re-\nsearch in which investigators compared the prevalence\nand correlates of isolated PAs vs PD with and without\nAG. The most striking results of this comparison are that\nisolated PAs are common and significantly comorbid with\nother DSM-IV disorders. These results are consistent with\nresults from clinical studies.36,37 Most people with iso-\nlated PAs fail to meet PD criteria because they never had\nrecurrent uncued attacks, although they typically had nu-\nmerous cued attacks. Another notable subgroup result\nis that cued attacks are more common than uncued at-\ntacks even among people with PD. This finding is espe-\ncially striking given that probing often uncovers ini-\ntially unrecognized panic cues,38,39 which means that the\nNCS-R probably leads to underestimating the propor-\ntion of attacks that are cued. We also found that persis-\ntence and lifetime number of attacks are more strongly\nrelated to PD than to AG; that comorbidity, especially\nwith other anxiety disorders, is more strongly related to\nAG than to PD; and that isolated PAs are associated with\nsubstantial role impairment when they occur in conjunc-\ntion with AG.\nThe subgroup results suggest that AG and PD are to\nsome extent distinct, as about 40% of all respondents with\nPA and AG never met criteria for PD. This finding is con-\nsistent with family aggregation studies, which show that\nTable 4.

To-\ngether with the finding that a high proportion of AG is\nassociated with PA, these results could be interpreted as\nsuggesting that panic exists along a continuum in which\nPA and PD differ in degree rather than in kind. This in-\nterpretation is consistent with prior findings that infre-\nquent, spontaneous PAs are common in the general popu-\nlation,41,42 that these attacks typically include fewer and\nless severe symptoms than those in patients with PD,43 and\nthat infrequent PA aggregates with PD in families.40,44\nThe distinction between cued and uncued attacks might\nbe called into question as part of this same line of thinking\nbased on the view that most PAs are to some extent\nresults that the boundary between PA and PD is arbitrary.\nNevertheless, given the high prevalence of PA only and the\nnegative outcomes associated with PA only, future re-\nsearchmightprofitablyattempttostudyPAonlyandevalu-\nate whether diagnostic criteria or symptom thresholds for\nPD should be modified to improve differentiation be-\ntween pathological and normal panic experiences.\nAn innovation of the NCS-R was the use of a fully struc-\ntured version of the PDSS to assess clinical severity. Al-\nthough lower than in clinical samples, 86.3% of respon-\nPA-AG and PD only were in the clinically important range\non the PDSS. A related finding is that clinical severity as-\nsessed in the PDSS and role impairment assessed in the\nSDS appear to be influenced nearly as much by AG\n(PA-AG vs PA only) as by PD (PD only vs PA only). This\nfinding is consistent with prior findings that AG is asso-\nciated with panic severity, anticipatory anxiety, and cog-\nnitive correlates of severity41,47-49 and our finding that AG\nis more common among people with PD than PA. Also\nconsistent with this pattern is the higher average life-\ntime number of PAs among respondents with vs those\nwithout AG in both the PA and PD samples. One pos-\nsible interpretation of this pattern is that AG is a sever-\nity marker of panic, although this is at least superficially\ninconsistent with the notion in previous paragraphs that\nAG is distinct from PD disorder. Another possibility is\nthat AG has a direct effect on impairment.\nThe treatment results are consistent with previous\nNCS-R reports that most people with PD eventually ob-\ntain treatment,23 that most active cases receive treat-\nment in a given year,50 and that most current treatment\n(45%-60% across the 3 PD and/or AG subgroups) fails\nto meet basic treatment guidelines.50 The latter result is\nall the more striking in that our definition of treatment\nquality is liberal. For example, no distinction was made\namong psychotherapies despite much more evidence\nfor the effectiveness of some types of psychotherapy\nthan others in treating panic,51-53 nor was a distinction\nmade among antidepressants or anxiolytics despite\nmuch more evidence for the effectiveness of some than\nothers.54,55 In interpreting the finding that many pa-\ntients fail to receive guideline-concordant treatment,\nsome patients were so classified because they dropped\nTable 5.
