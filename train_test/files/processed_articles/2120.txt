In populations\nwithout folic acid fortification, individuals with the TT genotype\nhave lower blood folate and higher blood homocysteine con-\ncentrations than do people with the more common CC genotype.\nIn the absence of folic acid fortification, studies of MTHFR and\nCVD can be used to assess the effects of lifelong differences in\nhomocysteine for CVD risk (13\u00ad15). Several meta-analyses of\npreviously published studies have reported that the MTHFR\n18), but the results have been conflicting. Some studies have\nreported effect modification by folate status (3), and others have\nsuggested that publication bias or other methodologic problems\nmight account for the observed associations (3, 17). Few studies\nalso examined the association of MTHFR C677T with CVD\nmortality (15, 19, 20), and none have examined possible effect\nmodification by longitudinal changes in folate status resulting\nfrom folic acid fortification within a population.\nThe validity of observational epidemiologic studies can be\naffected by unmeasured confounding of behavioral, physiologic,\nor socioeconomic factors associated with both exposure and\ndisease (21). Mendelian randomization uses common genetic\npolymorphisms that are known to influence exposure patterns or\nto have effects such as a modifiable exposure as proxies that are\nless susceptible to confounding by behavioral or environmental\nexposures, thereby strengthening the ability of an observational\nstudy to contribute causal inferences (22).\n1 From the Office of Public Health Genomics, CDC, Atlanta, GA (QY,\nTL, AY, and MJK); the Department of Foods and Nutrition, University of\nGeorgia, Athens, GA (LB); the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemio-\nlogical Studies Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (RC);\nthe Department of Epidemiology, Rolling School of Public Health, Emory\nUniversity, Atlanta, GA (WDF); and the Department of Medical Genetics,\nUniversity of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada (JMF).\n2 The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the author(s) and\ndo not necessarily reflect the official position of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\n3 No funding was received for this study.\n4 Address correspondence to Q Yang, Division for Heart Diseases and\nStroke Prevention, CDC, 4770 Buford Highway, NE, Mail-Stop F-72, At-\n5 Abbreviations used: CHD, coronary heart disease; CVD, cardiovascular\ndisease; ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision;\nIHD, ischemic heart disease; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nSupplemental Material can be found at:\nAlthough the MTHFR C677T variant has widespread effects\non several aspects of one-carbon metabolism (23), its effects on\nCVD are believed chiefly to reflect lower serum folate and\nhigher serum homocysteine concentrations.

The MTHFR\nC677T genotype was associated with significantly lower serum\nfolate and significantly higher homocysteine concentrations\n(P , 0.001), as expected. Individuals with the TT genotype had\n2.2-lmol/L higher homocysteine and 1.4-ng/mL lower folate\nconcentrations on average than did those with the CC genotype.\nThe prevalence of TT genotype varied by ethnic group,\nranging from 1.2% in non-Hispanic blacks and 11.6% in non-\nHispanic whites to 19.4% in Mexican Americans (Table 2). As\nshown in Table 3, a folate concentration .3.4 ng/mL was\ngenerally associated with a lower risk of all-cause and CVD\nmortality.

Similar associations were\nobserved in the subset of deaths that occurred after 50 y of age\n(see supplemental Table 1 under \"Supplemental data\" in the\nonline issue). In contrast, the MTHFR genotype was unrelated to\nother causes of death or with all-cause mortality (Table 5). The\nassociation of MTHFR TT genotype with a lower risk of CVD\nmortality was chiefly due to deaths occurring after the in-\ntroduction of folic acid fortification in January 1998 (Table 6)\nand those deaths occurring after 50 y of age (see supplemental\nTable 2 under \"Supplemental data\" in the online issue).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this nationally representative cohort study, the MTHFR\nC677T TT genotype was associated with significantly lower se-\nrum folate and higher homocysteine concentrations, consistent\nstudies also suggest that low folate or high homocysteine status is\nWe could not demonstrate both of these associations in this study,\nand randomized controlled trials of B vitamin supplementation to\nlower blood homocysteine concentration have clearly shown no\nbeneficial effects on risk of major vascular events (41).\nBecause of Mendelian randomization, we expected to find that\nMTHFR TT genotype, as a proxy for lifelong high blood homo-\ncysteine concentrations, was associated with an increased risk of\nCVD mortality if high blood homocysteine concentrations were\na cause of CVD mortality. Unexpectedly, we found TT genotype\nto be associated with a significantly lower risk of CVD mortality,\nand a stratified analysis showed that this effect occurred only in\nthe period after mandatory folic acid fortification. The observed\ninverse association of the TT genotype was consistent across sex,\nrace-ethnicity, use of supplements containing folic acid, serum\nfolate deficiency status, CVD status at baseline, and C-reactive\nprotein status. The association was also apparent when the anal-\nysis was restricted to individuals who died after 50 y of age.\nMost previous MTHFR C667T variant association studies\nfocused on the risk of CVD and concluded that MTHFR C677T\npolymorphism was associated with a moderately increased risk\nof CVD occurrence (3, 13, 18). Only a few previous studies\nexamined the association of MTHFR C677T with CVD or all-\nmiddle-aged women living in the Netherlands, a population\nwithout folic acid fortification (15), the rate ratios for CVD\nnotype, compared with women with the CC genotype, consistent\nwith the current study. In a further Dutch cohort of 666 elderly\n(aged 85 y) individuals, the MTHFR TT genotype was associ-\nated with a significantly higher risk ratio of all-cause mortality\ndeaths from cancer, not CVD (19). In a 6-y follow-up of a pro-\nspective study of 710 kidney transplant recipients living in Austria\n(again without mandatory folic acid fortification) (20), the\nMTHFR C677T genotype was unrelated to all-cause mortality.\nThe reasons for this paradoxical finding of an inverse association\nof MTHFR C677T genotype with CVD mortality are unclear. We\ncannot rule out the possibility that the associations we observed\noccurred by chance. However, the consistency of our findings with\nother prospective studies of MTHFR C677T with CVD mortality\n(15, 19) make this unlikely. Although the factors that predispose to\nthe development of CVD might be distinct from those that de-\ntermine CVD deaths, people who died with CVD were most likely\nto have CVD listed as an underlying cause of death (42).\nMeta-analyses of published studies of MTHFR C677Tand risk\nof incident CVD have suggested an excess risk of CVD in\nRisks (HRs and 95% CIs) for all-cause and CVD mortality that occurred before or after folic acid fortification by MTHFR C677T genotype per NHANES III\nCharacteristic\nDeaths before folic acid fortification\nDeaths after folic acid fortification\nCC CT TT P value2 CC CT TT P value2\nAll-cause mortality\nCVD mortality\n1 95% CIs in parentheses.

The geographic differences might indicate\nthat the influence of the TT genotype is dependent on folate\nstatus, because the folate intake increased substantially in North\nAmerican countries after January 1998, when folic acid fortifi-\ncation was introduced (43). After that time, the average serum\nfolate concentration increased by 2-fold, the average homo-\ncysteine concentration fell significantly among the general\npopulation (44), and the difference in the homocysteine con-\ncentration by the MTHFR C677T genotype was significantly\nattenuated (45). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that\nthe temporal association between when the inverse association\nof CVD mortality and MTHFR TT genotype began to become\napparent and when mandatory folate fortification was im-\nplemented in the United States was merely coincidental.\nThe current study had several major strengths, including the\navailability of MTHFR C677T genotyping and serum folate and\nhomocysteine measurements from a nationally representative\ncohort sample of the US adult population, investigation of\na large number of potential confounding variables, and ascer-\ntainment of all-cause and CVD mortality over a reasonable\nlength of time (median follow-up: 13.5 y). The prospective co-\nhort design of the current study was less sensitive to selection\nbias or to information bias than are cross-sectional or case-\ncontrol studies (21). Moreover, Mendelian randomization stud-\nies are typically less susceptible to confounding, apart from\npopulation stratification, or reverse causality than are other ob-\nservational studies. In addition, the genotypes were invariant\nover time and should be related to lifelong differences in ho-\nmocysteine concentrations. Use of these genotypes would, there-\nfore, be expected to be superior to single measurements of serum\nfolate or homocysteine concentrations as measures of lifetime\nfolate or homocysteine status.\nThis study had several limitations. First, because of the limited\nnumber of deaths for each specific CVD, such as IHD or stroke,\nwe primarily confined our analyses to all-cause and CVD mor-\ntality. Second, the NHANES III Linked Mortality File identified\ncauses of death through the National Death Index, which is based\non death certificates, which are known to be subject to error in\nclassification of the cause of death. Third, the last 8 y of follow-up\nin the current cohort occurred after mandatory folic acid forti-\nfication began in the United States. Possible explanations for the\ndiscrepant results between the current study and some previous\nstudies may reflect the effects of confounding of the MTHFR\nC677T genotype on risk of total or CVD mortality by the sub-\nstantial changes in folate status that occurred after fortification\nAlthough Mendelian randomization studies using functional\nvariants such as MTHFR C677T are generally unaffected by\nconfounding and reverse causality, they are still susceptible to\npublication bias, population stratification, and genetic pleiotropy\n(46, 47). Such biases can seriously distort the true associations\nwith coronary heart disease (CHD), even for a variant that has\nbeen as extensively studied as MTHFR. Recently, the MTHFR\nStudies Collaboration reported a definitive meta-analysis of\nMTHFR and CHD avoiding publication bias and compared\nmeta-analyses of published studies and unpublished datasets\nobtained from genome-wide association studies or other large-\nscale genotyping panels (48). In this meta-analysis, 19 un-\npublished data sets were obtained, involving 48,175 CHD cases\nand 67,961 controls, in which multiple genetic variants had been\nmeasured that included MTHFR only incidentally (47). These\ndata sets did not include measurements of blood homocysteine,\nbut homocysteine concentrations would be expected to be\n;20% higher with the TT than with the CC genotype in the\npopulations studied.
