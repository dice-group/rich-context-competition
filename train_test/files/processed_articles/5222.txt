P0 is synthesized by Schwann\ncells, processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and enters the secretory pathway. However, the mutant P0 with S63\ndeleted (P0S63del) accumulates in the ER lumen and induces a demyelinating neuropathy in Charcot\u00adMarie\u00adTooth disease\ntype 1B (CMT1B)\u00adS63del mice. Accumulation of P0S63del in the ER triggers a persistent unfolded protein response. Protein\nkinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is an ER stress sensor that phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor\n2 alpha (eIF2alpha) in order to attenuate protein synthesis. We have shown that increasing phosphophorylated-eIF2alpha (P-\neIF2alpha) is a potent therapeutic strategy, improving myelination and motor function in S63del mice. Here, we explore the\nconverse experiment: Perk haploinsufficiency reduces P-eIF2alpha in S63del nerves as expected, but surprisingly, ameliorates,\nrather than worsens S63del neuropathy. Motor performance and myelin abnormalities improved in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 com-\npared with S63del mice. These data suggest that mechanisms other than protein translation might be involved in CMT1B/\nS63del neuropathy.

Schwann cells produce myelin,\nwhich is a membranous structure composed by lipids and\nproteins that allows fast nerve conduction. The myelin pro-\ntein zero gene (P0, MPZ) encodes the major protein con-\nstituent of myelin. Mutations affecting MPZ cause a wide\narray of hereditary neuropathies. In particular, deletion of\ndisease type 1B (CMT1B) neuropathy characterized by\nreduced motor capacity, defective nerve conduction, and\nAnalysis of transgenic mice expressing this mutation\nrevealed that P0S63del fails to reach myelin and is\nretained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Schwann\n1Hunter James Kelly Research Institute, University at Buffalo, NY, USA\n2Department of Biochemistry, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical\nSciences, University at Buffalo, NY, USA\n3Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, DIBIT, Milan,\nItaly\n4Division of Genetics and Cell Biology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute,\nDIBIT, Milan, Italy\n5Department of Neurology, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical\nSciences, University at Buffalo, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLawrence Wrabetz, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences,\nEmail: lwrabetz@buffalo.edu\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nASN Neuro\nasn.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission\nprovided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\naccumulation of P0S63del triggers the unfolded protein\nresponse (UPR), a set of signals aimed to restore cellular\nhomeostasis (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005). Schwann\ncells and neurons are examples of factory cells; both\nface a high demand for protein synthesis and folding,\nrendering them particularly vulnerable to ER stress\n(D'Antonio et al., 2009; Gow and Wrabetz,\ninal-phase UPR effectors may provoke cell death or\ndedifferentiation (Tabas and Ron, 2011; D'Antonio\nIn mammals, there are three UPR transducers: Protein\nkinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK),\nactivating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-\nrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). IRE1 activates, through\nspliced X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s) transcription\nfactor, the expression of genes involved in ER-associated\ndegradation (ERAD; Friedlander et al., 2000; Travers\net al., 2000). ATF6 promotes folding capacity by increas-\ning the levels of ER-resident chaperones (Haze et al.,\ntranslation of most messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by phos-\nphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha\n(eIF2alpha), hence reducing the load of proteins in the\nER lumen. Phosphorylated-eukaryotic initiation factor 2\nalpha (P-eIF2alpha) protects and promotes survival in\nfactory cells. In fact, the ability to cope with persistent\nER stress is significantly decreased in Perk-deficient\nP-eIF2alpha simultaneously increases the translation of\nactivating transcripton factor 4 (ATF4) that upregulates\nCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous gene\n(Chop), an effector of cell death or dedifferentiation\nmotor function and reduced demyelination (Pennuto\nupregulating growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible\nprotein 34 gene (Gadd34), encoding a regulatory subunit\nof protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) holophosphatase that\nreactivates protein translation via dephosphorylation\nof eIF2alpha.\nWe previously demonstrated that Gadd34 inactiva-\ntion rescued S63del neuropathy by augmenting the\nlevel of P-eIF2alpha and, therefore, reducing protein\nsynthesis and overload in the ER, and alleviating the\nUPR (D'Antonio et al., 2013). Thus, we reasoned that\nreduced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha would exacer-\nbate S63del neuropathy. Nonetheless, we show here\nthat Perk haploinsufficiency surprisingly ameliorates\nS63del myelin defects in vivo and in vitro, even if nerve\nlevels of P-eIF2alpha were decreased. Moreover, Perk\nablation improved motor capacity in S63del mice indi-\ncating that PERK is detrimental in CMT1B neuropathy.\nOur data indicate that improved S63del neuropathy\nis not always coupled to increased P-eIF2alpha levels\nin nerve.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimals\nAll experiments involving animals were performed in\naccord with experimental protocols approved by the\nSan Raffaele Scientific Institute Animal Care and Use\n(Harding et al., 2000b) have been described previously.\nP0S63del and P0OE were maintained on the FVB/N\nbackground, whereas Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice, initially on the\n129S6 background, were backcrossed for at least six gen-\nerations onto the FVB/N background before initiation of\nexperiments. S63del mice were crossed with Perk\u00fe/\u00c0\nmice in order to obtain wildtype (WT), S63del, Perk\u00fe/\n\u00c0, and S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 genotypes. P0S63del transgene\nwas detected in FVB background mice through Tg80\nPCR, with the following primer sequences: P0 sense\nsense (50-GCTATTTGCCCTTCTCAGTC-30). Following\ndigestion with BamH1 restriction endonucleases, two\nbands are recognized for the positive pups; 310 bp\n(cut) \u00fe 400 bp. To detect the Perk KO allele, the following\n2000b). In all experiments, littermates were used as\ncontrols.\nPERK Immunoprecipitation\nWhere indicated, WT mice were injected intraperitoneally\nwith 1mg of tunicamycin in 150mM dextrose/g body\nweight. Mice were killed by CO2\ninhalation after 48hr.\nFragments of livers from WT or injected animals and a\ntotal number of 40 to 50 sciatic nerves from each of WT,\n(P28) were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nTissues were pulverized in a stainless steel mortar at\n\u00c080C, and the powder was homogenized with a motorized\nTeflon pestle with 1ml of SDS-free buffer (1% Triton\n1mM EDTA) containing phosphatase (1X, Phostop,\n2 ASN Neuro\nRoche) and protease inhibitors (PIC, Sigma). The hom-\nprotein concentration was assessed by the BCA method\n(Pierce). An equal amount of lysate (2 mg for nerves\nand 4mg for liver) was diluted to a final volume of\n700ml for each sample. For nerves, 20ml were reserved\nfor Western analysis to normalize the amount of protein.\nSaturation of endogenous immunoglobulins and aspecific\nbinding were prevented by adding 50ml of protein A beads\n(GE-Healthcare) and 1ml of a nonspecific rabbit antibody\nto lysates and incubating for 1hr at 4C. Lysates were\ncentrifuged and beads discarded. Rabbit polyclonal sera\n(2ml) against PERK (or subsequently against general con-\ntrol nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), heme-regulated eIF2\nalpha kinase (HRI), or protein kinase RNA (PKR)\nwere added together with 50 ml of protein A beads to\neach sample and left rotating overnight at 4C. After cen-\nbeads were washed and the excess of washing solution\nwas eliminated with a 27 G needle. Laemmli buffer was\nand loaded onto a 6% to 7% SDS-PAGE gel for\nWestern analysis.\nWestern Analysis\nSciatic nerves from transgenic and WT animals were dis-\nsected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were\nextracted in 100 ml of SDS Lysis Buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl,\nphosphatase (final 1X, Phostop, Roche) and protease\ninhibitors (final 1X, PIC, Sigma). Protein content was\nassessed by the BCA method (Pierce) following manufac-\nturer's instructions.

Single nerve fibers\nwere teased from nerves with G27 syringe needles under\ninternodes (three animals/genotype) were measured with\nImageJ software.\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrain, cerebellum, and muscle were dissected from P28\nmice and fixed in 10% formalin buffer overnight at room\ntemperature. The sections were embedded in paraffin,\nand 4 -mm sections were cut and dried at 60C for 1 hr.\nSlides were cooled to room temperature, deparaffinized\nin three changes of xylene, and rehydrated using graded\nalcohols. Finally, the slides were stained with hematoxy-\nlin and eosin, rinsed with water, and coverslipped.\nFresh frozen P28 sciatic nerve sections (8\u00ad10 mm) were\nfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min and\npermeabilized with \u00c020C cold methanol for 5 min.\nBlocking was performed for 30 min in undiluted goat\nserum followed by a 45-min incubation with\nbis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) 1%\u00adTriton 0.2% in\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

To assess the nuclear\nlocalization of CHOP, confocal images were taken using\nLeica confocal SP2 microscope with the 60\u00c2 objective.\nStaining of myelinated cultures was performed at 12 days\nafter ascorbic acid induction. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG)\nneurons were fixed with ice-cold 4% PFA for 15 min and\npermeabilized for 5 min with \u00c020C cold methanol.\nCoverslips were moved to a wet chamber and blocked\nwith 10% donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr. Rat antibody\nagainst MBP (1:4, Judith Grinspan) and rabbit antibody\nagainst NF-H (1:200, EMD Millipore) were incubated\novernight at 4C in BSA 1%\u00adTriton 0.2%. Anti-rabbit\nFITC-conjuated (1:200, Jackson Immuno Research Labs)\nwere incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Coverslips\nwere then exposed to DAPI and mounted as before. Only\nthe areas where neurofilament staining (axons) was pre-\nsent were considered for counting. Coverslips were visua-\nlized on a DM5000B fluorescence microscope (Leica),\nimages captured with a Leica DFC480 digital color\ncamera and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4. The\ninternodal length was measured with ImageJ software.\nMyelinating DRG Explant Cultures and Cocultures\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 and S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 embryos were\ncultured as previously described (Taveggia et al., 2005).\nAfter 6 days in culture, myelination was induced with\n50 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma\u00adAldrich) and the number\nof myelinated segments was assessed after 12 days upon\naddition of ascorbic acid. Pure DRG neuronal cultures\nwere obtained as previously described (Taveggia et al.,\n2005) using three 2-day cycles of normal or FudR\u00adsup-\nplemented media. Rat Schwann cells (2 \u00c2 105) were\nseeded on pure neuronal cultures and left to recover\nfor 6 days. Afterward, Schwann cells were induced to\nmyelinate with 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid in culture\nmedia and blocked at 21 days after seeding for assess-\nment. Parallel, non-seeded neuronal cultures certified\nabsence of mouse Schwann cells. The number and\nlength of MBP-positive myelinated internodes (see\nImmunohistochemistry section) was counted from 8 to\n10 fields per DRG and from 8 to 12 DRG per embryo.\nThree to nine embryos per genotype were dissected in\nfour separate experiments.\nTaqMan\u00d5 Quantitative PCR Analysis\nTotal RNA from mouse P28 sciatic nerves was extracted\nusing TRIzol (Roche), as previously described (Pennuto\net al., 2008). Synthesis of cDNA was performed starting\nfrom 2 mg of total RNA using a final concentration of\n50 mg/ml oligo dT (Promega), 5 mg/ml random hexamers\n(Promega), 2.5 mM dNTPs (Invitrogen), 30 U RNAsin\nreverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture\ncDNA was prepared and 4 ml was used to perform\nthe quantitative PCR. The ABI PRISM 7700 sequence\ndetection system (Applied Biosystems Instruments)\nwas used for the amplification according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions (TaqMan\u00d5; Applied Biosystems).\nThe relative standard curve method was applied using\nWT mice as reference.

Cells induce transla-\ntional attenuation as a fast and efficient strategy to pre-\nvent the accumulation of client proteins in the ER and\ncope with stress (Harding et al., 2001a). Complex eukary-\notes achieve global attenuation of protein translation by\nactivating the PERK P-eIF2alpha pathway (Harding\nER of Schwann cells, eliciting a chronic UPR that\nPennuto et al., 2008). Indeed, genetic and pharmaco-\nlogical inhibition of Gadd34 in S63del mice resulted in\nincreased levels of P-eIF2alpha, lowered the rates of pro-\ntein synthesis, and rescued the S63del phenotype\n(D'Antonio et al., 2013). To understand if, on the con-\ntrary, reduced eIF2alpha phosphorylation would worsen\nS63del neuropathy, we bred S63del mice with Perk\u00fe/\u00c0\nmice, where PERK-dependent phosphorylation of\nUnfortunately, we could not study nerves from full\nPerk ablation because Perk\u00c0/\u00c0 mice invariably died\nsoon after birth in the FVB/NCrl background (Harding\n4 ASN Neuro\nPerk is Necessary for eIF2alpha Phosphorylation\nTo test PERK activation in the CMT1B mouse model, we\nanalyzed the levels of P-eIF2alpha in S63del nerves\nbetween postnatal day 10 (P10) and 4 months of age.\nThe phosphorylation of eIF2alpha was high in S63del\nnerves compared with WT between P10 and P30\n(Figure 1a). Similar to P-eIF2alpha, also the chaperone\nBiP, a marker of ER stress, was highly induced in S63del\nwhen P0S63del is highly synthesized causing a chronic\nUPR, was a good timeframe for directly testing PERK\nactivation.\nImmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis\nallowed us to distinguish the active, phosphorylated\nform of PERK (PERK*), from the inactive counterpart\n(PERK0) in P30 sciatic nerves (Figure 1b\u00adc). Liver\nextracts derived from tunicamycin-injected mice served\nas positive controls (Figure 1b). In accordance with P-\neIF2alpha levels, also PERK activation (PERK*)\nincreased in a dose-dependent manner in S63del and\npared with WT at P30. Interestingly, also P0OE nerves\nincreased PERK activation (Figure 1c), although full\nactivation of a canonical UPR has not been detected in\nP0OE nerves (Pennuto et al., 2008; D'Antonio et al.,\n2013). Furthermore, the activation of the other three\neIF2alpha kinases, GCN2, HRI, and PKR (Harding\nS63del nerves (Supplementary Figure 1) suggesting that\nPERK is the main eIF2alpha kinase active in S63del-\nCMT1B nerves. Consistent with these observations,\nPerk partial loss of function in S63del mice (S63del//\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0) was sufficient to reduce P-eIF2alpha by\nconclude that PERK is the main kinase involved in\neIF2alpha phosphorylation in vivo, and that we can\nexperimentally explore the consequences of reduced\nP-eIF2alpha levels in the context of the UPR in S63del\nnerves.\nPerk Haploinsufficiency Paradoxically Ameliorates\nS63del Motor Performance and Reduces\nDemyelination and Onion Bulbs\nS63del mice display a progressive neuropathy character-\nized by impairment in motor capacity that can be\ndetected by rotarod analysis around 4 months of age\net al., 2013). The rotarod test of motor performance\nalso successfully discriminated functional changes of\nS63del neuropathy in previous studies where the UPR\nwas genetically perturbed (Pennuto et al., 2008;\nD'Antonio et al., 2013). Thus, to test whether Perk abla-\ntion would have a detrimental effect on S63del motor\nfunction, as expected from a resulting decrease in P-\neIF2alpha, we performed rotarod analysis on WT,\nmonths of age. Surprisingly, S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 animals\nshowed a significant improvement in motor performance\nas compared with S63del mice (Figure 2a). Supporting\nthe rotarod data, in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice F-wave\nlatency showed a trend toward amelioration as compared\nwith S63del (p \u00bc .10; Figure 2c), however, nerve conduc-\ntion velocity (NCV) was not improved (Figure 2b).\nNotably, Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice showed reduced motor cap-\nacity, although NCV and F-wave latency were not signifi-\ncantly affected, suggesting a possible detrimental effect of\nPerk haploinsufficiency in tissues other than sciatic nerve\nthat could affect the motor performance (Figure 2b\u00adc). To\nverify this hypothesis, we performed morphological ana-\nlysis of cerebellum, spinal cord, and gastrocnemius muscle\n(Supplementary Figures 2\u00ad4). Hematoxylin and eosin\nstaining did not reveal gross abnormalities in the cerebel-\nlum and spinal cord suggesting that these tissues did not\ncontribute to the reduced motor capacity of Perk\u00fe/\u00c0\nmice. Interestingly, Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice displayed a trend\ntoward a slightly increased number of centrally nucleated\nmuscle fibers as compared with WT (Supplementary\nFigure 4a, inset a, black arrowheads), although a similar\n1\u00ad2% of centrally nucleated fibers have been reported in\nWT mouse muscle (Sonnemann et al., 2006) suggesting\nthat this slight increase is unlikely to explain significantly\nimpaired rotarod performance.\nFinally, metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus are\nassociated with neuropathy. Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice have been\nreported to manifest glucose intolerance with only\nslightly elevated beta-islet cell death (Harding et al.,\n2001b). Accordingly, we found no obvious morphological\ndifference in hematoxylin and eosin\u00adstained pancreatic\nislets among WT, Perk\u00fe/\u00c0, S63del, and S63del//Perk\u00fe/\n\u00c0 mice (data not shown).\nS63del neuropathy is characterized by thinner myelin\n(hypomyelination; Pennuto et al., 2008; D'Antonio et al.,\n2013). We therefore investigated the effect of Perk loss of\nfunction in S63del nerves and quantified myelin thickness\nat 4 months. As expected, the g-ratio analysis revealed\nhypomyelination in S63del nerves compared with WT\nf), but did not reveal a difference between S63del//Perk\u00fe/\n\u00c0 and S63del nerves (Figure 2f). A very slight hypermye-\nlination was instead detected in Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves when\nAfter 6 months of age, S63del nerves show progressive\nsigns of demyelination and other pathological hallmarks,\nMusner et al. 5\nsuch as onion bulbs (Wrabetz et al., 2006). As previously\nreported, Chop ablation and the functional impairment of\nGadd34 reduced the amount of demyelinated fibers and\nD'Antonio et al., 2013). To further analyze the unex-\npected finding that Perk deficiency could rescue S63del\nneuropathy, we counted the number of demyelinating\nfibers and onion bulbs at 12 months, when they are\nmore evident. Strikingly, both onion bulbs and\ndemyelinated fibers were strongly diminished in\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 sciatic nerves as compared to S63del\n(Figure 3). Only rare pathological findings were detected\nin Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 and WT nerves. Consistent with this\nimprovement, Perk deficiency in S63del produced a\ntrend toward amelioration of the reduced myelin thick-\nness observed in S63del compared with WT, as shown by\ng-ratio measurement in 12-month sciatic nerves\n(Supplementary Figure 5).

In this way, only DRG\nneurons are lacking Perk, as the rat Schwann cells are\nWT. To control for possible insertional effects of\nS63del transgene, we also processed analogously S63del,\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0, and S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 explants. The\nnumber of myelinated internodes and internodal length\nwere unaffected in all of the explants, showing that nei-\nther the depletion of Perk in neurons nor S63del trans-\ngene insertion had an effect on Schwann-cell myelination\n(Figure 4e\u00adg). These data suggest that Perk ablation has\nan important role in influencing myelination in S63del\nDRG explants and that Schwann cells might be primarily\nresponsible for this effect.\nTo confirm the ex vivo observations in vivo, we mea-\nsured the internodal length of teased fibers from WT,\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0, S63del, and S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 sciatic nerves.\nInternodal length increases strongly between P5 and\nP20 and reaches its maximum around P30, when it sta-\nbilizes (Court et al., 2004). In agreement with what we\nfound in the myelinating DRG explant cultures, S63del\ninternodes are shorter than those in the WT. In addition,\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 teased fibers show longer internodes\nTo further support the in vivo data on S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0\nmyelination, we quantified the protein expression of\nMAG, MBP, and PMP22 myelin proteins in 4-month\nnerves. Western blot analysis showed a reduction in\nMBP levels in S63del nerves relative to WT, whereas\nlevels of myelin-related proteins remained similar\nbetween S63del and S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 (Supplementary\nFigure 6). As demyelination and onion bulbs occur in a\nsmall subset of fibers in S63del nerves, it is possible that\nthese morphological features do not produce discernible\neffects in western analysis for myelin proteins.\nNonetheless, our observations reinforce that, both\nin vivo and ex vivo, S63del myelination is ameliorated\nby Perk genetic ablation.\nFigure 5.

The\ntranscription factor ATF4 lies between P-eIF2alpha and\nCHOP in the PERK signaling pathway. As P-eIF2alpha\nlevels are reduced in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves, stress-\nenhanced translation of ATF4 may be limited, reducing\nupregulation of Chop and its detrimental effect on mye-\nlination. To test this hypothesis, we measured ATF4 pro-\ntein levels in sciatic nerves of P28 animals. Surprisingly,\nATF4 is not decreased in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves as\ncompared with S63del (Figure 6a). Accordingly, Chop\nmRNA is still highly induced in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0\nnerves, suggesting that Perk haploinsufficiency does not\nhave a strong influence on Chop upregulation.\nCHOP must translocate into the nucleus in order to\nact as a transcription factor (Ron and Habener, 1992). To\ntest whether Perk ablation could somehow impede Chop\nnuclear translocation, we performed CHOP immunos-\ntaining on sciatic nerve sections from WT, Perk\u00fe/\u00c0,\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves, CHOP localizes in Schwann\ncell nuclei similarly to S63del (Figure 6c, insets).\nFinally, to verify whether Chop is still able to up-regulate\nits target genes, we tested the expression of Gadd34,\nFigure 7. The ATF6 and IRE1 branches of the unfolded protein response are not affected by Perk ablation. (a) ATF6 cleavage analyzed by\nWestern blot in WT, Perk\u00fe/\u00c0, S63del, and S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 sciatic nerves at P28.

Gadd34 mRNA levels are elevated\nremain elevated comparably in both S63del and S63del//\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves (Figure 6d). In addition, Doc1, 4, and 6,\nother CHOP target genes, were not decreased (data not\nshown). These data suggest that CHOP remains equally\nprotein levels were instead significantly decreased in\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice as compared with S63del, consist-\nent with the fact that Gadd34 levels are also known to be\nregulated post-transcriptionally (Figure 6e).\nThese results suggest that, although S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0\nmice seem to phenocopy S63del//Chop\u00c0/\u00c0 mice, the\namelioration of neuropathy observed here is likely to be\nindependent from Chop. Therefore, we considered other\ncandidates for S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 rescue, for example, in\nthe other UPR pathways.\nActivation of Other UPR Sensors is Not Perturbed\nin Response to Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 Haploinsufficiency\nWhen challenged with ER stressors, Perk-null cells acti-\nvate IRE1 more quickly and deactivate it more slowly\ncompared with control cells, suggesting a compensatory\noveractivation of parallel UPR transducers in the absence\nof Perk (Harding et al., 2000b). Moreover, in cells with\ndefective PERK signaling, increased activity of ATF6\nand IRE1 stress pathways have been reported\n(Yamaguchi et al., 2008). We therefore hypothesized\nthat Perk loss of function can ameliorate S63del myelin-\nation by augmenting folding capacity or ERAD, down-\nstream of the other two UPR transducers. To test\nwhether ATF6 or IRE1 pathways are regulated in\nresponse to Perk loss of function, we measured the\nlevels of cleaved ATF6 and Xbp1 splicing. ATF6 does\nnot respond to Perk heterozygosity, as cleaved ATF6\nprotein levels remain comparable in S63del and S63del//\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves (Figure 7a and b). Similarly, Xbp-1 spli-\ncing did not show overt alterations between S63del//\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves (Figure 7c). These data suggest that\nATF6 and IRE1 branches of the UPR do not compensate\nfor Perk haploinsufficiency and to improve the\nneuropathy.\nDiscussion\nTransgenic mice expressing P0S63del manifest a demye-\nlinating neuropathy that mirrors CMT1B disease in\nnerves, P0 accumulates in the ER of Schwann cells, elicit-\ning an UPR (Wrabetz et al., 2006). Genetic or pharma-\ncological impairment of Gadd34 in S63del nerves, which\nshould increase eIF2alpha phosphorylation, and reduce\nthe synthesis of P0S63del, fully rescued this neuropathy\nTo further explore this relationship, we performed the\nconverse experiment. Here, we report that crossing\nS63del mice with Perk-deficient mice reduces eIF2alpha\nphosphorylation in nerve by 40%, but surprisingly,\nameliorates rather than worsens S63del motor function\nand its morphological hallmarks such as onion bulbs\nand demyelinated fibers. Moreover, also myelin interno-\ndal length increases significantly. These data suggest\nthat the regulation of eIF2alpha phosphorylation might\nnot be the only mechanism involved in the CMT1B\nneuropathy.\nPERK is the Main Kinase Phosphorylating\neIF2alpha in Nerve\neIF2alpha phosphorylation can be enhanced by several\nstimuli, being the common target of the integrated stress\nAt least four kinases phosphorylate eIF2alpha. PKR\nresponds to viral dsDNA (F. Zhang et al., 2001);\nGCN2 and HRI respond to amino acid or heme depriv-\nP. Zhang et al., 2002b), whereas PERK reacts to ER\naccumulation of unfolded proteins (Harding et al.,\nexperiments show that PERK is the eIF2alpha kinase\nmost abundant in S63del peripheral nerves and that its\nactivation parallels the dosage of the S63del transgene\n(Figure 1c). Accordingly, eIF2alpha phosphorylation\ndecreases in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves and S63del//\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0 myelinating DRGs (Figure 4a). These results\nindicate that PERK is the main kinase involved in\neIF2alpha phosphorylation in S63del neuropathy.\nInterestingly, PERK is strongly active in P0OE nerves\nwhere P0WT is overexpressed (Figure 1c). We had previ-\nously reported that P0WT overexpression weakly, but\nsignificantly, increases BiP levels, without altering Chop\nor Xbp1s levels (Pennuto et al., 2008). This may be\nanother example where UPR mediators play roles in\nhomeostasis during development. For example, Xbp1s\nis required for normal differentiation of plasma cells,\nwhich like Schwann cells, also express immunoglobulin\nfamily members (Reimold et al., 2001; Iwakoshi et al.,\nRepeated attempts to measure protein translation\nrates in S63del and S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 nerves were per-\nformed as previously described (D'Antonio et al., 2013),\nbut the method was not sensitive enough to reveal a dif-\nference between these two genotypes (not shown).\nNonetheless, the 40% decrease of P-eIF2alpha levels\nwas sufficient to promote alterations in myelination in\nS63del nerves. Similarly, partial ablation of Perk was suf-\nficient to produce associated phenotypic changes in\nmouse models of central demyelination (W. Lin et al.,\nPERK is Detrimental for S63del Myelination\nPERK through phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, reduces\nprotein translation rates for almost 90% of cellular\nWhen we attenuated translation by interfering with\nGadd34, and increasing eIF2alpha phosphorylation, we\nwere able to relieve the levels of UPR activation and\nachieve almost complete morphological and functional\nTherefore, we performed the converse experiment in\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0 or S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice. Perk ablation in\nmice without the P0S63del transgene reduced eIF2alpha\nphosphorylation, and had a detrimental effect on motor\nperformance. Moreover, myelination in Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 and\nPerk\u00c0/\u00c0 DRG explants was impaired and the length of\ninternodes was shorter than WT (Figure 4b\u00add). These data\nsuggest that Perk is beneficial for myelination in WT.\nIn contrast, and to our great surprise, Perk deficiency in\nS63del mice did not worsen, but ameliorated morphological\nand functional features of neuropathy (Figures 2, 3, and 5).\nOnion bulbs and demyelinated fibers, the hallmarks of\nS63del neuropathy, were rescued in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 ani-\nmals (Figure 3). Functionally, motor performance was sig-\nnificantly ameliorated in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 animals,\nstrongly suggesting that Perk contributes a detrimental\neffect to the pathogenesis of S63del neuropathy (Figure 2).\nIn Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice, Perk ablation may negatively influ-\nence motor phenotype not only by acting in peripheral\nnerves, but also in other tissues. In this mouse model, one\nPerk allele is ablated in all cells of the body, and Perk\nhaploinsufficiency is known to have negative conse-\nquences in several organs (Harding et al., 2001b)--some\ncrucial for motor function (i.e., brain, spinal cord, or\net al., 2010). For example, in the brain, it is possible\nthat Perk haploinsufficiency can interfere with the\nmotor learning phase of rotarod analysis or myelination\nmuscle, Perk ablation can impair myocyte Ca2\u00fe signaling\nand contraction (Huang et al., 2006). Another possibility\nis that Perk ablation could contribute to S63del neur-\nopathy in a non-nerve autonomous way, but without\nobvious morphological changes outside of nerve. For\nexample, a systemic metabolic disturbance like glucose\nintolerance (Harding et al., 2001b) could secondarily\naffect neurons or Schwann cells negatively. Thus, nerve-\nindependent effects could contribute to the poor rotarod\nperformance of Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice, even if morphology and\nNCV studies of sciatic nerve appear grossly normal\n(Figure 2).\nHowever, these same detrimental effects are not likely\nto explain the altered rotarod performance in S63del//\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice, as it improved relative to S63del.\nAccordingly, we did not document any correlating\nmorphological alteration in cerebellum, spinal cord, or\nmuscle, apart from a very slight increase (from 0.5% to\n1.5%) of centrally nucleated fibers in S63del gastrocne-\nmius muscle, that returned toward normal in S63del//\nPerk\u00fe/\u00c0. Centrally nucleated fibers are linked with\nmuscle degeneration/regeneration. However, 1\u00ad2% cen-\ntrally nucleated fibers have been reported in normal\nyoung adult mouse muscle (Sonnemann et al., 2006). In\ncontrast, clinically symptomatic mice with early muscular\ndystrophy typically have already 30\u00ad60% centrally\nPerk-Null Neurons Do Not Alter Myelination\nby S63del Schwann Cells\nTo eliminate a possible role for other tissues in the\nimprovement of S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice, we studied the\neffect of Perk ablation on myelination in cultures contain-\ning only Schwann cells and neurons. We isolated DRGs\nfrom S63del//Perk\u00c0/\u00c0 embryos and induced myelination\nin vitro (Taveggia et al., 2005). This experiment also\nallowed us to study complete ablation of Perk. In\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 and S63del//Perk\u00c0/\u00c0 myelinating\nexplant cultures, the increased internodal length nicely\ncorrelated with the rescue observed in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0\nsciatic nerves, suggesting, once more, that Perk has a det-\nrimental function for S63del myelination (Figure 4).\nMyelination depends on carefully orchestrated, reciprocal\nsignals between neurons and Schwann cells (Taveggia\net al., 2010). We then asked whether altering Perk and\neIF2-alpha phosphorylation in neurons could influence\nmyelination, in a non-cell autonomous manner. To test\nthis hypothesis, we cultured Perk-deficient neurons with\nWT rat Schwann cells, already known to myelinate\nmouse neurons normally (Taveggia et al., 2005). The\nhigh rate of myelination observed in all genotypes ana-\nlyzed indicates that Perk-deleted neurons do not alter\nmyelination. These data, together with the results of\nDRG explant myelination, suggest that Perk influences\nmyelination in a Schwann cell autonomous manner.\nFuture experiments may address this in vivo, by deleting\nPerk in Schwann cells and neurons using conditional\nablation of Perk with Cre-recombinases (P. Zhang\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 Rescue is not correlated\nwith Alterations in Chop and Gadd34\nIt has been shown that Chop and Gadd34 are detrimental\nin S63del neuropathy.

This is\nconsistent with previous reports showing that Chop can\nbe upregulated independently by ATF6 (Yoshida et al.,\n2000). Additionally, CHOP remains detected in nuclei of\nmyelinating Schwann cells, and CHOP target genes\nremain activated, suggesting that CHOP loss of function\ndoes not explain rescue in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice.\nGadd34 protein levels, instead, drop by about half in\nabsence of PERK (Figure 6e). This can be explained by\nthe post-transcriptional regulation of Gadd34 mRNA\nmediated by the uORF regions in the 50 UTR of its\nGadd34/PP1 holoenzyme promotes eIF2alpha depho-\nsphorylation and restarts protein translation after initial\nComplete genetic ablation of Gadd34 rescues S63del\nneuropathy phenotype by impeding reversal of protein\nsynthesis (D'Antonio et al., 2013); haploinsufficiency of\nGadd34 had no effect on S63del neuropathy. Even if\nS63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice resemble S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0-defi-\ncient mice functionally and morphologically, the amelior-\nation observed in this study is not correlated with\neIF2alpha phosphorylation levels.

Therefore, we reasoned that the\nlack of PERK in S63del could induce other UPR path-\nways to compensate. However, our data show that Perk\nhaploinsufficiency did not alter either the IRE1 or ATF6\npathways in S63del nerves.\nCollectively, our data show that Perk ablation para-\ndoxically improves S63del neuropathy despite that\neIF2alpha phosphorylation is reduced in nerve. We thus\nconclude that the translational homeostasis in Schwann\ncells is not the only factor involved in the pathogenesis of\nCMT1B. For example, we cannot rule out a possible\neffect of beneficial effect of Perk deletion in neurons or\nother cells, which may contribute to the phenotype\nobserved in S63del//Perk\u00fe/\u00c0 mice.
