Numerous studies have reported that\nactivation of the intra-renal RAS contributes to glomeru-\nlar hypertrophy, mesangial expansion and glomeruloscle-\nrosis in various renal diseases.1 Previous clinical and\nexperimental studies have demonstrated that inhibition of\nthe RAS using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\n(ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) results\nin the reduction of proteinuria and retards progression of\nrenal disease in addition to lowering blood pressure.\nEven in normotensive or well-controlled hypertensive\npatients with CKD, use of RAS blockade resulted in\nreduction of proteinuria and may be beneficial in the\npreservation of renal function.2\u00ad8 However, RAS block-\nade is frequently associated with several adverse events,\nincluding angioedema, dry cough, hyperkalemia, and\naggravation of underlying renal insufficiency.9 In partic-\nular, the incidence of hyperkalemia is increased in\npatients with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\nand limits the use of RAS blockade in patients with\nadvanced CKD.10 If the serum potassium level increases\nabove 5.5 mmol/l during use of RAS blockade, discon-\ntinuation of RAS blockade should be considered,11,12 with\nhyperkalemia managed by, for example, prescription of a\nThe effect of renin\u00adangiotensin system\nblockade on renal protection in chronic\nkidney disease patients with hyperkalemia\nJu-Hyun Lee1*, Young Eun Kwon1*, Jung Tak Park1, Mi Jung Lee1,\nHyung Jung Oh1, Seung Hyeok Han1, Shin-Wook Kang1, Kyu Hun\nChoi1 and Tae-Hyun Yoo1\n Keywords\nRenin-angiotensin blockade, hyperkalemia, renal outcomes\n1Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine,Yonsei University,\nSeoul, Korea\n*These authors equally contributed to this work\nCorresponding author:\nTae-Hyun Yoo, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Department of\nKorea.\nOriginal Article\n492 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nlow-potassium diet, thiazide or loop diuretics, and cor-\nrection of metabolic acidosis. However, there are differ-\nent approaches to cope with RAS blockers according to\nphysician preference and decision. A practical strategy\nfor maintaining the RAS blockade is needed not only for\ncontrol of blood pressure, but also to delay the progres-\nsion of CKD. In order to maintain the blocking effect of\nRAS, ACEI or ARB are frequently maintained in CKD\npatients with elevated potassium levels. Still, it is not\nclear whether or not maintenance of RAS blockade is\nbeneficial in CKD patients with elevated potassium\nlevels.\nWe examined renal outcomes (doubling of creatinine or\nprogression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)) in order to\ndetermine the effect of RAS blockade maintenance in\npatients with CKD stage III and IV, who had developed\nhyperkalemia during use of RAS blockade. In addition, we\nevaluated the impact on hyperkalemia of maintenance with\nRAS blockade in this population.\nMaterials and methods\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board\n(IRB) of Yonsei University Health System Clinical Trial\nCenter. This study was a retrospective medical record-\nbased study and the IRB waived the requirement for written\nconsent from the patients.\nStudy subjects\nPatients with stage III or IV CKD, prescribed ACEI or ARB\nand with concurrent hyperkalemia during the use of RAS\nblockade were included in this study. We initially recruited\n2124 patients who were followed-up for CKD at Yonsei\nUniversity Health System from July 2008 to December\n2011. ACEIs or ARBs except dual blockers including\naldosterone antagonists were prescribed to 1239 patients,\nand 351 patients developed hyperkalemia during treatment\nwith RAS blocker. Of these patients, 83 patients were\nexcluded for the following reasons: age younger than 18\nyears or older than 75 years, terminal malignancy, previous\nhistory of kidney transplantation, and follow-up duration of\nless than 12 months. Patients whose serum creatinine and\npotassium levels at baseline or during the follow-up period\nwere not available, or who were transiently discontinued\nRAS blockers for less than 3 months were also excluded.\nTherefore, a total of 258 patients were included for the final\nanalysis (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Flow diagram of the study.A total of 351 patients developed hyperkalemia during treatment with RAS blockers. Excluding\n83 patients, a total of 258 patients were enrolled for final analysis. CKD: chronic kidney disease;ACEi: angiotensin converting enzyme\ninhibitor;ARB: angiotensin II receptor blocker; KT: kidney transplantation.\nData collection\nUsing medical records, demographic and clinical data were\nreviewed retrospectively for age, sex, medical history,\nmedications, time to doubling of baseline serum creatinine\nlevels and ESRD, and history of admission after study\nenrollment. Laboratory data included urinary protein-to-\ncreatinine ratio (UPCR), and serum creatinine and potas-\nsium levels. The four-variable Modification of Diet in\nRenal Disease study equation was used for calculation of\nthe estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR).\nDefinitions\nand hyperkalemia was defined as potassium 5.5 mmol/l in\na non-hemolyzed serum sample. Patients with hyper-\nkalemia that occurred after initiation of renal replacement\ntreatment were not included. When hyperkalemia devel-\noped during treatment with RAS blockade, three kinds of\nclinical practice patterns were recognized contingent on the\nmaintenance of RAS blockade: 1) discontinuation of RAS\nblockade; and 2) reduction or 3) maintenance of doses of\nRAS blockade with supportive management for potassium\nreduction. Patients were categorized as the maintenance\ngroup if they were maintained on RAS blockade without\ndiscontinuation of drugs, and as the withdrawal group if\nRAS blockade had been discontinued for >3 months after\ndevelopment of hyperkalemia. The criteria for maintenance\nof RAS blockers were not specified. Maintenance or with-\ndrawal of RAS blockades were decided according to indi-\nvidual physicians.\nOutcome endpoints\nThe main outcomes were a doubling of the baseline serum\ncreatinine concentration and ESRD. ESRD was defined as\ninitiation of renal replacement therapy including permanent\nhemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or renal transplantation.\nIn addition, incidence of hyperkalemia and hyperkalemia-\nrelated hospitalization were also evaluated during the fol-\nlow-up period.\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA)\nwas used to perform statistical analysis. Continuous vari-\nables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and\ncategorical variables were expressed as percentages.\nT-test and chi-square test were used for comparison of\nthe two groups. The Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test was used\nfor analysis of the normality of the distribution of param-\neters. Cumulative renal survival curves were derived\nusing the Kaplan\u00adMeier method, and differences between\nsurvival curves were compared using the log-rank test.\nMultivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used\nfor determination of risk factors for renal outcomes.\nHazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)\nwere calculated using the estimated regression coeffi-\ncients and standard errors in the Cox regression analysis;\na p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nThe baseline demographic, clinical and biochemical data of\nstudy subjects are shown in Table 1.

In addition, neither hyper-\nkalemia-related hospitalizations nor mortality differed\nbetween the two groups (0.18 episodes per patient-year vs.\n(p=0.14). Blood pressures at various time points during the\nfollow-up period are listed in Table 3. The blood pressures\nin the two groups were comparable during the follow-up\nperiod. During the follow-up period, 17 patients (11 patients\nin the maintenance group and six patients in the withdrawal\ngroup) died, and mortality rate was not different between\ntwo groups. One patient in each group died due to hyper-\nkalemia-related events.\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrated that maintenance of RAS block-\nade is beneficial for the preservation of renal function, even\nin hyperkalemic CKD patients treated with RAS blocker. In\naddition, cautious use of RAS blockade does not lead to a\nsignificant increase in the episodes of hyperkalemia in\nCKD patients who develop hyperkalemia during treatment\nwith ACEI or ARB.\nBased on previous reports, long-term blockade of the\nrenin\u00adangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system by ACEIs or ARBs\nresulted in increased levels of plasma renin or angiotensin\nII.13 In addition, occurrence of aldosterone breakthrough\nhas been also reported during long-term ARB therapy,\nmainly by angiotensin II-dependent mechanisms.14 Since\nrenin or angiotensin II levels are already elevated in condi-\ntions of chronic blocking of the RAS, it is possible that\nrenal failure and hypertension might be aggravated due to\nthe abrupt disappearance of the RAS-blocking effect.\nBlocking of RAS might be maintained in order to prevent\nrebound hypertension and progression of renal failure. Our\ndata support that maintenance of RAS blockade rather than\nwithdrawal is beneficial for the preservation of renal func-\ntion in CKD patients who have accompanying hyper-\nkalemia during RAS blockade treatment.\nThe renoprotective effect of the RAS blocker was much\nmore prominent in the subgroup with a baseline UPCR\nratio of more than 1 mg/mg. This finding is consistent with\nprevious studies, indicating an association of a higher uri-\nnary protein excretion rate with a rapid decline rate in renal\nfunction,8 and ACEI has a distinguishable renoprotective\neffect in patients with baseline proteinuria of 3 g/day or\nmore.3 The present study suggests that maintenance of RAS\nblockade should be considered in highly proteinuric CKD\npatients.\nIn patients with CKD, development of hyperkalemia fre-\nquently occurs due to various causes such as reduced renal\nexcretion of potassium or metabolic acidosis.15\u00ad17 Besides\ndiscontinuation of RAS blockade, various approaches should\nbe considered. Potassium imbalance might be treatable by\nrestricting potassium intake and correction of underlying\ncauses, while maintaining treatment with RAS blockade. A\nprevious study showed that most of the patients with\nTable 1.

In addition, another study\nconducted in the CKD population reported no significant\nFigure 2.

Therefore, maintenance of the\nRAS blocker with careful monitoring, rather than only dis-\ncontinuing RAS blockade, could be applied.\nThis study has several limitations. Because its design is\nretrospective, this study may include sampling errors.\nThere may be potential selection errors because mainte-\nnance of RAS blockade was decided by individual physi-\ncians. However, there are no specific guidelines and\noutcomes regarding whether use of RAS blocker is benefi-\ncial, due to a lack of appropriate guidelines. In addition,\ndue to safety and ethical issues, it would be difficult to con-\nduct a prospective study using RAS blockade in CKD\npatients who have hyperkalemia. Thus, in spite of the retro-\nspective nature of the current study, we think that the study\nresults are still valuable. Second, even though other drugs\nand conditions may have had an influence on serum potas-\nsium levels, these and dietary potassium intake were not\nevaluated. Therefore, further large-scale analysis is needed\nin order to confirm the risk and benefit of RAS blockade in\nthis special population.\nIn conclusion, the renoprotective effects of RAS block-\nade in CKD patients with hyperkalemia disappeared after\nwithdrawing RAS blockade. The results of the current\nstudy suggest that maintenance of RAS blockade retards\nthe progression of renal failure, and these beneficial effects\nare more prominent in proteinuric CKD patients. In addi-\ntion, ACEI/ARB is well tolerated in stage III or IV CKD\npatients with hyperkalemia occurring during treatment with\nRAS blockade.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a new faculty research grant of\nReferences\n1.
