The study participants provided demographic and clinical data. Thyroid\nfunction and serum concentrations of the thyroid autoantibodies antithyroperoxidase antibody\n(TPOAb) and antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) were measured.\nResults: A total of 1334 subjects were included in this study. The prevalence of TPOAb and TgAb\npositivity was significantly higher in female than in male subjects. The prevalence of thyroid\nautoantibodies in those with subclinical hypothyroidism and clinical hyper- and hypothyroidism was\nsignificantly greater than in euthyroid subjects. The concentration of TPOAb and TgAb in subjects\nwith both TPOAb and TgAb was significantly higher than in those who exhibited only one type of\nthyroid autoantibody. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, female sex, thyroid volume,\nthyroid hypo- and heteroechogenicity were found to be risk factors for the presence of\nautoantibodies.\nConclusions: Thyroid autoantibodies were common in the general population. Women with\nthyroid enlargement, hypoechogenicity and heteroechogenicity might benefit from routine\nscreening for thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid function.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, West\nChina Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan\nProvince, China\n2Yulin Community Health Service Centre, Chengdu,\nSichuan Province, China\n3Department of Geriatric Medicine, Sichuan Provincial\nPeople's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China\nCorresponding author:\nProfessor Hui Huang, Department of Endocrinology and\nMetabolism, West China Hospital, 37 Guoxue Lane,\n*These authors contributed equally to this work and are\nco-first authors.\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\n",

The study sample was randomly\nselected by the numbers of residential build-\nings in this Chengdu community. The cross-\nsectional survey was undertaken between\nsion criteria were as follows: pregnant or\npostpartum women within 1 year; subjects\ntaking glucocorticoids, dopamine ordobuta-\nmine; subjects taking antiepileptic drugs (e.g.\nphenytoin, carbamazepine); subjects with\nadrenocortical insufficiency, renal insuffi-\nciency, other serious systemic disease or\nchronic wasting disease; subjects\nwho received amiodarone or an iodine-\ncontaining contrast agent within the previous\n6 months. The study protocol was approved\nby the Ethics Committee of West China\nHospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu,\nChina. All of the participants in this study\nprovided written informed consent.\nMethods\nA questionnaire was designed by the\nChinese Society of Endocrinology specific-\nally for this study in order to obtain general\npersonal information, including sex, age,\nsmoking history, history of thyroid disease\nand intake of iodine supplements. The sub-\njects who were enrolled in this study\nattended a clinical examination with blood-\nsample collection at Yulin Community\nHealth Service Centre, Wuhou District,\nChengdu. Participants completed their ques-\ntionnaires at home prior to the clinical\nexamination. Smoking status was classified\ninto three categories: nonsmoker, occasional\nsmoker (<1 cigarette per day) and frequent\nsmoker (!1 cigarette per day). Each sub-\njects' height, weight and blood pressure was\nmeasured by nurses using standardized pro-\ncedures. Venous blood (3 ml) was collected\nafter an overnight fast. After standing for\n1.5 h, the blood sample was centrifuged at\n704 g for 5 min at room temperature in a\nmedical low-speed centrifuge (Beijing\nMedical Centrifuge Factory, Beijing,\nChina). The serum was separated and\nstored at \u00c020C until further analysis.\nThyroid ultrasonography was performed\nby trained technicians using ultrasonog-\nraphy equipment with a 7.5 MHz probe\n(LOGIQ\u00d5 500; GE Healthcare China,\nBeijing, China). The volume of each thyroid\nlobe was calculated using the formula: V\nThe thyroid volumes consisted of the sum of\nthe volumes of the two lobes. Diameters of\nany thyroid nodules that were identified\nwere measured and recorded. The thyroid\ninterecho classifications included isoecho-\ngenicity, hyperechogenicity, hypoechogeni-\ncity and heteroechogenicity.12\nLaboratory methods\nThyroid function and thyroid autoantibo-\ndies were measured using Roche\nchemiluminescence immunoassay kits\n(thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]: kit\nanalyser (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).\nThe intra- and interassay coefficients of\nvariation were all <5%. The TPOAb,\nTgAb, and TSH levels were measured in\neach study participant. The serum TSH\nconcentration was used to evaluate thyroid\nfunction. If TSH was <0.71 mIU/l, the FT4\nand FT3 levels were also measured in the\nsame sample. If TSH was >6.25 mIU/l, then\nonly the FT4 level was measured.

The\nreference range of TSH was based on a\nthyroid epidemiological survey of 10 cities in\nChina and has been demonstrated to be\nsuitable for Chinese populations.12\nDiagnostic criteria for thyroid disease\nClinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed\nwhen the serum TSH concentration was\n<12.0 pmol/l. Subclinical hypothyroidism\nwas diagnosed when the serum TSH con-\ncentration was >6.25 mIU/l and the serum\nFT4 was within the normal range. Clinical\nhyperthyroidism was diagnosed when the\nserum TSH concentration was <0.71 mIU/l\nand the serum FT4 was >22.0 pmol/l and/or\nthe FT3 concentration was >6.8 pmol/l.\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism was diagnosed\nwhen the serum TSH concentration was\nFT3 were within normal ranges.\nThyroid autoantibodies were regarded as\npositive when the TPOAb level was >34 IU/\nml and/or the TgAb level was >115 IU/ml.\nGoitre was defined as a thyroid volume\nThis definition was derived from the mean\nmale and 282 female) with no personal or\nfamily history of thyroid disease, with no\nthyroid autoantibodies, and with an unde-\ntected goitre or nodules using B-mode\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5.

Body mass\nindex (BMI) was calculated using the\nformula: BMI \u00bc weight (kg)/height (m2).\nNonparametric statistical tests (Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test or Kruskal\u00adWallis test)\nand parametric statistical tests (Student's\nt-test) were used when appropriate for\ncontinuous variables. 2-test was used for\nnoncontinuous variables. Differences in the\nprevalence of thyroid autoantibodies were\ntested using a 2-test and the 2 trend test if\nnecessary. Risk factors were evaluated using\nunivariate and multivariate logistic regres-\nsion analyses. Apart from the TPOAb\nand/or TgAb levels, the following variables\nwere included in the models: age, sex,\nsmoking status, BMI, TSH concentration,\nthyroid volume, thyroid nodules and thy-\nroid echogenicity.

Study participants with\neuthyroidism had a significantly lower\nprevalence of thyroid autoantibodies\n(TPOAb, TgAb, TPOAb and TgAb,\nTPOAb and/or TgAb) than those with\nclinical hyper-/hypothyroidism or subclin-\nical hypothyroidism (all P < 0.05; data\nnot shown). A significant difference in\nthe prevalence of both TPOAb and TgAb\npositivity was found between the\neuthyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroid-\ndata not shown). The prevalence of thyroid\ndifferences were found using the subgroup\nanalysis.\nUsing a univariate logistic regression\nmodel, age, female sex, being a frequent\nsmoker, TSH level, thyroid volume, thy-\nroid goitre, hypoechogenicity and hetero-\nechogenicity were found to be risk\nfactors for thyroid autoantibody positivity\n(Table 2). In the multivariate logistic regres-\nsion analysis, the final model retained the\nfollowing variables: female sex, thyroid\nvolume, hypoechogenicity and heteroecho-\ngenicity. The risk of TPOAb positivity\nincreased significantly with an elevated\nTSH concentration, however, the risk\nwas not significant between TgAb and the\nTSH level.\nThe numbers of subjects classified as\nhaving isoechogenicity, hyperechogenicity,\nheteroechogenicity and hypoechogenicity\nStudy participants with thyroid hypoecho-\ngenicity were divided into five groups\naccording to their TPOAb and TgAb con-\ncentrations. Individuals who were negative\nfor both TPOAb and TgAb were placed\nin group 0; groups 1\u00ad4 were divided by\nquartiles of thyroid autoantibody-positive\nconcentrations. The hypoechogenicity sub-\ngroup analysis showed that regardless of\nwhether the subject was TgAb positive or\nnot, the prevalence of thyroid hypoecho-\ngenicity increased with increasing concen-\ntrations of TPOAb (TgAb positive,\nIn addition, there was a trend towards an\nincreased prevalence of thyroid hypoecho-\ngenicity with an elevated concentration of\nTgAb, regardless of the TPOAb concentra-\ntrend test; data not shown). In total, a\ntrend towards an increased prevalence of\nthyroid hypoechogenicity with elevated\nlevels of TPOAb and TgAb was observed\nshown).\nDiscussion\nConsistent with previous research, in the\npresent study, thyroid autoantibodies were\nsignificantly more prevalent in female than\nin male participants in a cohort (n \u00bc 1334)\nwith no history of thyroid disease.4,5,15\nFurthermore, the current study detected a\nsignificantly greater serum median TSH\nconcentration in tparticipants who were\npositive for thyroid autoantibodies com-\npared with those who were negative.\nA significant association was demonstrated\nbetween an elevated TSH level and the\npresence of thyroid autoantibodies.16\nAlthough this current cross-sectional study\ndid not show a risk for the participants with\npositive thyroid autoantibodies developing\neither subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism,\nsuch a progression has been reported in a\nlongitudinal study.17 In addition, for euthyr-\noid individuals with positive autoantibodies\nat baseline, those who developed hypothy-\nroidism in the follow-up study had signifi-\ncantly higher baseline TSH levels than those\nwho remained euthyroid.15 This current\nTable 2.

The presence of\none antigen might enhance the concentra-\ntion of the other antigen in the immune\nsystem, or the reactivity of the immune\nsystem against thyroid antigens when\nboth autoantibodies are present may be\nenhanced.\nIn the current study, the prevalence of\nthyroid autoantibodies was as high as 83.3%\nand 76.9% in subjects with clinical hypo-\nthyroidism and clinical hyperthyroidism,\nrespectively. Significant differences were\nobserved in the prevalence of positive thy-\nroid autoantibodies between euthyroid sub-\njects and those with thyroid dysfunction.\nPrevious studies observed that thyroid\nautoantibodies were involved in thyroid\nabnormalities.18\u00ad20 The presence of TPOAb\nand TgAb was associated with lymphocytic\nassociation suggests that TPOAb and\nTgAb may play an important role in the\npathogenesis of thyroid abnormalities.\nSeveral studies have suggested that TPOAb\ncould induce antibody-dependent cell-\nmediated cytotoxicity, and that concentra-\ntions of TPOAb might correlate with\nseverity of thyroid lymphocytic infiltration,\nregardless of the presence or absence of\nthyroglobulin (Tg) could facilitate the for-\nmation of complement-activating Tg/TgAb\ncomplexes.24 Patients with high-avidity\nTgAb might be at a high risk of developing\nsubclinical and clinical hypothyroidism.25\nHowever, the positive rate for thyroid\nTPOAb and/or TgAb was 13.8% in euthyr-\noid subjects in the present study. A longitu-\ndinal study in China found that the\nprevalence of abnormal thyroid function,\nespecially hypothyroidism, in euthyroid sub-\njects with positive antibodies at baseline,\neither alone or combined (TgAb and/or\nTPOAb), was much higher than in euthyroid\nsubjects who were antibody negative after\n5 years.15 Populations positive for thyroid\nautoantibodies may be at a high risk of\nabnormal thyroid function.17 A routine\nexamination of thyroid function in individ-\nuals with positive thyroid autoantibodies\nmay be necessary and is suggested, based on\nthese current findings.\nThe univariate and multivariate logistic\nanalyses in the present study revealed that\nfemale sex was a risk factor for TPOAb and\nTgAb positivity. A previous study showed\nthat presence of thyroid autoantibodies was\nsignificantly associated with female sex.16\nFemale sex was reported to be a risk factor\nfor TgAb positivity.15 Cross-sectional26 and\nlongitudinal27 studies found that the preva-\nlence of thyroid autoantibodies was higher\nin subjects with thyroid goitres than in those\nwithout thyroid goitres. In the Whickham\nSurvey follow-up study,17 patients who had\ndeveloped a goitre had also developed thy-\nroid autoantibodies. However, findings of\nthe current study showed that thyroid\ngoitres were not in the final multivariate\nanalysis. In addition, thyroid volume was a\nrisk factor for the presence of thyroid\nautoantibodies in the current study, both\nin the univariate and multivariate logistic\nregression analyses. A study undertaken in\npeople with elevated TSH demonstrated\nthat there was a strong association between\nthyroid autoantibodies and an enlarged\nthyroid.28 In hypothyroidism patients, a\nhigh level of autoantibodies (TPOAb and/\nor TgAb) was significantly associated with\nthyroid enlargement: patients with thyroid\nenlargement had the highest values of both\nTPOAb and TgAb.29 In another study,\nantibody-positive subjects had larger thy-\nroid volumes than control subjects.30\nVarious associations may exist between\nthyroid autoantibodies, thyroid volume\nand goitres. TgAb formation might reduce\nthe level of Tg, and low Tg levels maximize\ngrowth-promotion activity and induction of\nthe apical iodide transporter, which stimu-\nlates follicular cell growth.31 In addition, the\nco-ordinated actions of TSH and insulin/\ninsulin-like growth factor-1 signalling might\nThyroid hypoechogenicity was reported\nto be involved in thyroid autoimmune\ninflammation and lymphocytic infiltra-\ntion.34 Thyroid hypo- and heteroechogeni-\ncity were found to be highly indicative of\nautoimmune thyroiditis.35 In the current\nstudy, thyroid hypoechogenicity and hetero-\nechogenicity were risk factors for thyroid\nautoantibody positivity. The prevalence of\nhypoechoic thyroid increased with elevated\nconcentrations of TPOAb and TgAb.\nHypoechogenicity and heteroechogenicity\nwere associated with significantly higher\nlevels of TPOAb activity and were indicative\nof a high level of autoimmune inflammatory\nactivity of the thyroid gland.36 A close\nrelationship between the heteroechogenicity\nof the thyroid gland and TPOAb was\nreported in euthyroid patients with\nHashimoto's thyroiditis before the hetero-\nechogenicity became distinguishable from\nnormal thyroid glands.37\nHow smoking affects thyroid auto-\nimmunity remains controversial. The\nNHANES III study found that the preva-\nlence of thyroid autoantibodies was lower in\nsmokers than in nonsmokers.5 A significant\nnegative association was observed between\nsmoking and the presence of TPOAb and\nTgAb.38 Furthermore, a prospective study\nreported that smoking cessation might\nincrease the risk of TPOAb and TgAb\npositivity.39 Similarly, the current study\ndemonstrated that the prevalence of\nTPOAb and/or TgAb positivity was lower\nin smokers (occasional and frequent) than in\nnonsmokers. In addition, using univariate\nlogistic regression analysis, being a frequent\nsmoker was a protective factor for positive\nTPOAb and TgAb (TPOAb: odds ratio\nthe final model of the multivariate logistic\nanalysis. In the current study, BMI was a\nrisk factor for TPOAb positivity, but not for\nTgAb, in the univariate logistic regression\nanalysis; however, BMI was not in the final\nmodel of the multivariate analysis. The\nprevalence of positive thyroid autoantibo-\ndies was increased in obese children, par-\nticularly in those with elevated TSH.40\nObese patients had a higher frequency of\nantithyroid antibodies than control\npatients.40 The prevalence of TPOAb posi-\ntivity was greater in the obese group in a\ncross-sectional study undertaken in 165\nmay be due to increased antigen presenta-\ntion by amplified thyroid stimulation, or it\nmay be associated with another factor, such\nas the leptin level.41 Future studies are\nneeded to understand how obesity might\nenhance the risk of thyroid autoimmunity.\nThe current investigation had a number\nof limitations. First, the study did not\ninclude subjects <18 years of age.\nSecondly, the study was cross-sectional and\nhence did not investigate individual changes\nover time. Thirdly, laboratory tests assessing\nFT4 and/or FT3 were only performed in\nsubjects with abnormal TSH levels.\nIn conclusion, female sex, thyroid\nvolume, thyroid hypoechogenicity and het-\neroechogenicity were risk factors for the\npresence of the thyroid autoantibodies\nTPOAb and TgAb. Thyroid autoantibodies\nwere detected in subjects with thyroid dys-\nfunction and in those who were euthyroid.\nAn increased prevalence of thyroid hypoe-\nchogenicity correlated with elevated levels of\nTPOAb and TgAb. The presence of thyroid\nautoantibodies was indicative of auto-\nimmune thyroiditis. Smoking may be a\nprotective factor for the presence of\nTPOAb and TgAb. Women with thyroid\nenlargement, thyroid hypoechogenicity and\nheteroechogenicity would benefit from rou-\ntine evaluation of thyroid autoantibody\nstatus and thyroid function.\nAuthors' contributions\nYue-Rong Yan and Xi-Lian Gao contributed\nequally to this work.
