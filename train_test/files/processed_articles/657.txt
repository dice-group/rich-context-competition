Physical inactivity is a leading cause of death and disability, but very little is known about physical ac-\ntivity and its determinants among socially disadvantaged and medically vulnerable adults. The purpose of this study\nwas to assess physical activity and its correlates, including measures of physical activity knowledge, perceived barri-\ners, and self-efficacy, among socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults.\nMethods. A stratified random sample of 1,088 patients aged 55 years or older was selected from an urban primary care\ncenter serving a predominantly low-income population. Of the 1,088 patients sampled, 771 (71%) completed an inter-\nviewer-administered questionnaire.\nResults. A physical activity instrument, developed specifically for the population being studied, showed an average\nof 65 minutes of physical activity per week. Scores on a true-false knowledge quiz were no better than expected by\nchance, and over two thirds reported symptom and perceived environmental barriers to physical activity. Lower self-\nefficacy and greater symptom and motivational barriers were found to be associated with less physical activity.\nDiscussion. Given the prevalence of inactivity, knowledge deficits, and perceived barriers to physical activity,\npopulation-specific interventions may be required to improve rates of physical activity among socially disadvantaged\nand medically vulnerable adults.\neach year as a result of physical inactivity (Powell &\nBlair, 1994). Consequently, physical inactivity is one of the\nleading causes of death among adults in the United States\n(McGinnis & Foege, 1993). Physical inactivity is a leading\ncause of both death and disability among older adults\n(Buchner, 1997), and physical activity or exercise has been\nthe most common intervention for the prevention or man-\nagement of disability (Jette et al., 1996; King, Haskell,\nHealth care provider referral and counseling for physical\nactivity is highly recommended (U.S. Preventive Services\nTask Force, 1996), but older adults' compliance with physi-\ncal activity recommendations is low (Shah, Maly, Frank,\nHirsch, & Reuben, 1997) and perceived barriers to greater\ncompliance may be significant (Clark, in press). To effec-\ntively promote physical activity among all adults, we will\nneed to develop measures and improve understanding of\nphysical activity and its determinants within vulnerable\npopulations (Fletcher et al., 1996; NIH Consensus Devel-\ndate, adults with lower education, little income, and poor\nhealth have rarely been included in physical activity stud-\nies. Yet, these are the persons suffering the most in terms of\nchronic disease and impairment (Clark, Mungai, Stump, &\nTheoretical models suggest that adequate physical activity\nknowledge and self-efficacy, and recognition and successful\nmanagement of perceived barriers all affect the likelihood of\nadoption and maintenance of regular physical activity (An-\nHovell, & Hofstetter, 1992). Self-efficacy is a pivotal con-\ncept of social cognitive theory and represents the evaluations\npeople make of their performance ability in a particular do-\nmain and the likely outcomes of that performance (Bandura,\n1986). Outcome expectations fall under the model of self-\nefficacy and represent evaluations people make of the out-\ncomes that will result from the behavior. The information\npersons draw on to assess their performance ability and\nlikely outcomes may be based on previous experiences, ob-\nservation of others, or verbal persuasion (Strecher, McEvoy,\nBecker, & Rosenstock, 1986). In addition, an individual's in-\nformation or knowledge base may operate in conjunction\nwith perceived social and physical resources or barriers to\naffect self-efficacy assessments and, ultimately, behavior\nThe Regenstrief Physical Activity and Health Survey\n(RPAHS) was designed to assess physical activity knowl-\nedge, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and behavior among\na vulnerable population of older adults. Data on physical ac-\ntivity behavior and its correlates were gathered from per-\nsons aged 55 years or older who receive care from an urban\nprimary care center that serves a predominantly low-income\npopulation. After assessing the appropriateness of two exist-\ning physical activity instruments, this article presents the\nmeasures developed specifically for the RPAHS sample.\nBecause gender and age differences in social norms and\nhealth are likely to affect physical activity behavior, self-\nefficacy, knowledge, and perceived barriers, all physical ac-\ntivity measures are explored by age and gender. Finally, a\nmultivariable, hierarchical model of the association between\nphysical activity and theoretically relevant blocks of inde-\npendent variables is estimated. In the hierarchical model, so-\nciodemographic characteristics are followed by measures of\nknowledge and perceived barriers (including current health\nstatus), which are followed by self-efficacy measures.\nMETHODS\nThe RPAHS consisted of a survey development phase,\nwhich included the conduct of focus groups, and a survey ad-\nministration phase. Accordingly, the methods of the study are\npresented in two parts. First, the focus group sample selection\nand script are presented, and then the survey sample selection\nand instruments are presented. The presentation of analyses\naddresses the procedures used in the evaluation of the focus\ngroup data, the psychometric testing of the survey instru-\nments, and the cross-sectional analyses of the survey data.\nFocus Group Sample\nDetails of the focus group sample selection, script, and\nresults are published elsewhere (Clark, in press). Names\nwere randomly selected from the Regenstrief Medical\nRecords System (RMRS), which contains data on all pa-\ntients seen at any of seven primary care centers located\naround Indianapolis (McDonald, Tierney, Overhage, Mar-\npersons in each of four race by gender groups had agreed to\nattend a focus group session. Generally, it was necessary to\nphone 20 individuals from each group to arrive at 8 to 10\nindividuals who attended the session. The exception to this\nrule was White men. Eight White men agreed to attend, but\njust 3 individuals showed up for the session.\nThe script was the same at each of the four sessions. The\nscript began by asking participants to list some physical ac-\ntivities that come to mind. Examples were given as a probe\nwhen necessary. After a list was compiled and additional\nactivities were not forthcoming, participants were asked\nwhich activities they perform most often, and how often\nthey perform these activities. The participants were then\nasked to name activities that come to mind when they hear\nthe term exercise.\nWith an exercise list completed, participants were told to\nimagine they were required to exercise at least 3 times a\nweek for 30 minutes each session. They were then asked to\nchoose one exercise activity to meet this requirement. Each\nparticipant was then asked what led them to choose that\nparticular activity. They were then asked to consider the\nfactors that would make it difficult for them to perform the\nactivity or, alternatively, factors that would make it easier\nfor them to perform the activity.\nSurvey Sample\nRespondents to the RPAHS came from a stratified ran-\ndom sample that was taken from the RMRS. Community-\ndwelling patients who had at least one scheduled visit to the\nWishard Memorial Hospital outpatient general medicine\npractice in the 12 months preceding the list generation, had\na valid address or phone number, and who were at least 55\nyears of age were eligible. There were approximately 5,000\neligible subjects. The sample list was stratified by age (55\nto 69 and 70 and older), gender, and race (African Ameri-\ncan, White). One hundred forty patients were randomly se-\nlected from each of the 8 possible strata, except the older\nWhite male strata. There were only 108 White men in the\n70 and older age group; all of these men were selected.\nThus, a total of 1,088 patients were selected.\nThe 1,088 sampled patients were approached over an 8-\nmonth period as they came in to the clinic for scheduled ap-\npointments. A face-to-face interview was conducted in the\nclinic, or a time for a telephone interview was arranged. Pa-\ntients who did not have a scheduled appointment during the\n8-month period received a telephone interview without ini-\ntial contact in the clinic. The Short Portable Mental Status\nQuestionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975) was used to screen patients\nfor cognitive impairment.\nWe were unable to establish contact with 174 (16%) pa-\ntients and another 115 (10%) patients refused. Fifteen patients\nfailed the cognitive screen or had a speech or hearing impair-\nment with no proxy available, and 13 patients did not com-\nplete the interview. Thus, 771 (71%) completed a face-to-face\nor phone interview. Twenty-nine percent of these interviews\nwere in person and the remaining interviews were over the\nphone. There were 42 (5%) proxy interviews. The data from\nproxy interviews have been excluded from Tables 3 and 4,\nwhich included responses to questions about physical activity\nself-efficacy, knowledge, and perceived barriers.\nBivariate analyses comparing those interviewed (n = 111)\nto those not interviewed (n = 317) on each of the variables\nshown in Table 1 indicated that men were less likely to be in-\nterviewed than women (p < .05). The response rate among\nMen were less likely to have an operating telephone and were\nless likely to show up for scheduled clinic appointments.\nTable 1 presents a comparison of selected characteristics\nof the RPAHS sample to the 1995 Current Population Survey\n(CPS) respondents who were 55 years of age or older and to\nrespondents of the 1984 National Health Interview Survey\n(NHIS) Supplement on Aging, all of whom were 55 years of\nage or older. As can be seen, the respondents to the RPAHS\nwere significantly poorer, less educated, and of poorer health.\nSurvey Measures\nThe survey generally lasted about 20 minutes. One\nAfrican American woman and one White woman inter-\nviewed patients over an 8-month period (November 1996\nthrough June 1997) for the baseline survey. Formal inter-\nrater reliability was considered too burdensome for respon-\ndents, but no statistically significant differences across inter-\nviewers were found on any measure. To organize the\ndiscussion of measures, we have grouped them into four\ntheoretically derived categories: (1) sociodemographic char-\nacteristics; (2) knowledge and perceived barriers (including\nhealth and chronic disease); (3) self-efficacy; and (4) physi-\ncal activity.\nSociodemographic characteristics.--Sociodemographic\nmeasures were relatively standard and included age, race,\ngender, and years of formal education. To asses income, re-\nspondents were asked whether their household income was\nTable 1.

Knowl-\nedge was measured with a 6-item facts-on-exercise quiz.\nResponses were agree, disagree, and not sure. Scores are\nreported as the number correct out of six. The six quiz\nstatements were \"as people get older they should exercise\nless,\" \"if you can talk while exercising, you aren't exercis-\ning hard enough,\" \"regular exercise can make you feel less\ntired,\" \"people with high blood pressure should not exer-\ncise,\" \"a slow walk is as good as a brisk walk,\" and \"your\nheart does not have to beat faster than normal for exercise\nto make your heart and lungs stronger.\"\nTo determine perceived barriers to physical activity, we\nasked respondents, \"Do any of the following reasons keep\nyou from walking or exercising more than you currently\ndo?\" We then presented a list of potential barriers identified\nthrough focus groups and an open-ended question during\nsurvey pilot testing. Respondents answered yes or no to the\nfollowing potential barriers: fear of crime, poor weather, no\nor poor sidewalks, getting out and having no place to sit\ndown, not enough will power, lack of interest, not enough\ntime, pain, swelling, fear of chest pain, no energy, and fear\nof shortness of breath.\nIn addition to symptoms reported as specific barriers to\nphysical activity, general health and chronic disease indica-\ntors may represent perceived barriers or resources for phys-\nical activity. Chronic disease indicators were based on the\nRMRS data, whereas general health status questions were\nincorporated into the survey. Persons were determined to\nhave a particular disease if it had been diagnosed, marked\non the patient problem list, or treated through prescribed\nmedications. Hypertension was additionally determined to\nexist if persons had systolic values of greater than 140 or\ndiastolic values of greater than 90. The survey included a\nquestion of perceived health, and questions about mobility.\nPerceived health was measured with a 5-point response set\n(excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor), but recoded to\nfair or poor versus all other for analyses. Like the perceived\nhealth question, the mobility questions have been fre-\nquently used in nationally representative surveys of older\nadults and shown to perform adequately (Guralnik et al.,\n1993). There were two items; one asked about difficulty\nwalking one block and the other asked about difficulty\nclimbing one flight of stairs. Responses were no difficulty, a\nlittle, somewhat, or very difficult, and unable to do because\nof a health or disability problem.\nSelf-efficacy.--Self-efficacy consists of two components;\nefficacy expectations and outcome expectations. There were\nthree questions to determine efficacy expectations (i.e., per-\nformance confidence) and three to determine outcome ex-\npectations (i.e., outcome confidence). The efficacy expecta-\ntions questions were each framed in the same way, but the\nreferenced activity varied in type and/or frequency. Re-\nsponse categories were not at all sure, a little sure, some-\nwhat sure, and very sure, and were scored 0, 1,2, and 3, re-\nspectively. Thus, the range for the efficacy and outcome\nexpectations scores was 0 (not at all sure) to 9 (very sure).\nAn example of an efficacy expectations item is \"how sure\nare you that you could sit in a chair and exercise your arms\nand legs for 20 minutes at least 3 times a week.\" The other\ntwo questions asked about brisk walking for 10 minutes\nevery day of the week and brisk walking for 30 minutes 3\ntimes a week. The outcome expectations questions fol-\nlowed immediately after each efficacy expectations ques-\ntion and asked subjects how sure they were that the previ-\nously described activity and frequency (e.g., 10 minutes of\nbrisk walking every day) would improve their health. Re-\nsponse categories were the same as those for the efficacy\nexpectations questions. These activities and frequencies\nwere chosen in an attempt to represent a range of physical\nactivity difficulty and frequency relevant to this population.\nApproximately 9% of respondents were unable to charac-\nterize their level of self-efficacy on at least one outcome or\nefficacy expectations item. These persons were coded as \"a\nlittle sure\" for the multivariable models (Table 4). Those\nmodels were run with and without these imputed cases, and\nthe results of those models did not differ significantly from\nwhat is presented in Table 4.\nPhysical activity.--Exercise has been defined as a subset\nof physical activities that are planned, structured, and repet-\nitive for the purpose of physical fitness, whereas physical\nactivity is more broadly defined as bodily movement of\nskeletal muscles (NIH Consensus Development Panel,\n1996). Focus groups indicated that many respondents\nwould be very broad in their classification of physical ac-\ntivity, often expanding it to include all activity, physical or\nnot. Thus, activities were specifically identified for the re-\nspondents on the survey.\nIn the assessment of physical activity, patients were\nasked whether they ever climb stairs and, if so, how many\nflights of stairs they climb on a normal day. Respondents\nwere also asked whether they ever walk as far as one block\nand, if so, how often they took such walks during a normal\nweek and how many minutes a normal walk lasted. They\nwere also asked whether their legs got tired, their hearts\nbeat faster, or their breathing got heavier on a normal walk.\nRespondents were also asked whether they did any phys-\nical activities other than walking that were exertional (i.e.,\ncausing their legs to get tired, their heart to beat faster or\ntheir breathing to get heavier). If they responded yes, they\nwere asked how often they engaged in such activity and\nhow long the activity normally lasted. The dependent vari-\nable for the multivariate analyses was minutes of physical\nactivity per week. Total minutes of walking, whether exer-\ntional, and total minutes of other exertional activity were\ncombined to arrive at a single measure of total minutes of\nphysical activity per week. It is important to note that stair\nclimbing was not included in the composition of total min-\nutes of physical activity.\nAnalyses\nIn what follows, we present the results of the focus group\nsessions, the psychometric properties of the new survey\nmeasures, and the results of cross-sectional analyses of the\nsurvey data. Each focus group session was audiotaped and a\nresearch assistant took notes during the session. The facilita-\ntor then listened to the audiotape and wrote out a transcript.\nThe transcript was reviewed and compared to transcripts of\nother sessions. All sessions followed the same script, and a\ntable of responses following the script was generated to\ncompare the responses across groups (see Clark, in press).\nThe assessment of psychometric characteristics consisted of\nexploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, and test-\nretest reliability. Exploratory factor analysis was performed\non the self-efficacy and outcome expectations items, which\nwere expected to form two dimensions, and with perceived\nbarriers to physical activity to identify clustering. Internal\nconsistency of the two self-efficacy dimensions was as-\nsessed using Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was\nperformed for the physical activity measures on 50 subjects.\nResults were assessed using the intraclass correlation coeffi-\nFollowing the presentation of focus group and psychomet-\nric results, physical activity behavior and physical activity\nself-efficacy, knowledge, and perceived barriers are pre-\nsented for the sample as a whole, two age groups (i.e., ages\nage and gender differences using t tests. We then estimate\ncorrelates of minutes of physical activity per week. Total\nminutes of physical activity per week was highly skewed and\nwas recoded into four categories for the multivariable, hier-\narchical analysis. Ordinary least squares regression was used\nbecause assumptions were satisfied with minutes categorized\nas described previously, and the percent of variance associ-\nated with each of three separate blocks of variables could be\ndetermined. The potential correlates of minutes of physical\nactivity per week were incorporated sequentially in three\nblocks following the model presented earlier; (1) sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics; (2) knowledge and perceived barriers\n(including health); and (3) self-efficacy. Only respondents\nwho reported they were able to walk as far as one block were\nincluded in the multivariable analysis.\nRESULTS\nFocus Groups\nThe range of physical activities listed varied somewhat\nacross the race and gender groups, but the three most com-\nmon activities were consistently housecleaning, yardwork,\nand walking. There was no variability across the groups in\nterms of the activity most preferred; walking was the most\npreferred and performed activity. Walking was also defined\nas exercise, and was the most commonly preferred exer-\ncise activity.\nMany perceived barriers were noted and these are all pre-\nsented with the survey data. The most frequently mentioned\nand most significant barriers seemed to be pain (knee pain,\nback pain, and hip pain), shortness of breath, and fear of\nchest pain. The men seemed to focus more on shortness of\nbreath, and women more on pain as a barrier. Weather, cold\nor hot, was noted as an important perceived barrier, and the\nquality of sidewalks was frequently mentioned.\nPsychometric Assessments\nAs noted, self-efficacy consists of evaluations of confi-\ndence in one's performance ability and confidence in out-\ncomes. There were three questions intended to measure each.\nFactor analysis of the six items revealed two dimensions that\nexplained 70% of the variance in responses to the items. The\nfactor loadings were all over 0.50 and the expected items\nloaded together. The interfactor correlation was 0.39. The\nCronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.71 for the self-efficacy\nitems and 0.81 for the outcome expectations items.\nExploratory factor analysis revealed three factors that ex-\nplained 50% of the variance in responses to the perceived\nbarriers. Minimum factor loadings within the three factors\nwere all over 0.50. The three factors were labeled environ-\nmental, motivational, and symptom. Interfactor correlations\ners were crime, weather, no or poor sidewalks, and having\nno place to sit down. Motivational barriers were not enough\nwill power, lack of interest, and not enough time. Symptom\nbarriers consisted of pain, swelling, fear of chest pain, no\nenergy, and fear of shortness of breath. These categories of\nperceived barriers are not presented as a representation of\nunderlying factors. It does not seem appropriate, for exam-\nple, to assume that there is one underlying environment af-\nfecting physical activity. Rather, the barriers are presented\nin the environmental, symptom, and motivation clusters to\nbetter organize the presentation of data.\nTwo existing physical activity instruments were assessed.\nThe Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and the\nYale Physical Activity Scale (YPAS) have been shown to\nhave reasonable validity (Dipietro, Caspersen, Ostfeld, &\nWashburn, Smith, Jette, & Janney, 1993). Both, however,\nwere developed on relatively healthy, active, and well-edu-\ncated subjects. The types of activities described in the PASE,\nand particularly the YPAS, are very rare and even unknown in\nthe population studied here. The PASE is reasonably short (10\nto 15 minutes), but the YPAS is very detailed and often takes\nlonger than 30 minutes. Most importantly, the vast majority of\nour respondents were at the floor of the PASE, which assesses\nphysical activity in terms of hours per day rather than minutes\nper day. Among 30 respondents who were administered the\nPASE in pilot testing, there was little variability. Twenty-three\nof the 30 respondents were at the floor of the walking assess-\nment, and just 4 of the 30 respondents reported any leisure\ntime physical activity other than walking.\nAccordingly, the RPAHS physical activity instrument\nwas intended to capture average minutes of walking and\nother physical activities that involved some perception of\nexertion. The number of flights of stairs climbed per day\nwas also captured. We assessed two-week test-retest relia-\nbility of physical activity survey questions on 50 subjects.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient for number of stairs\nclimbed per day was 0.73. Total minutes of physical activ-\nity per week, excluding stair climbing, had an intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient of 0.59.\nCross-Sectional Analyses\nPhysical activity behavior.--A breakdown of daily stair\nclimbing, weekly walking, weekly brisk walking, and other\nbrisk physical activities is shown in Table 2. \"Brisk\" was\ndefined as activity that produced tired legs, or increased\nheart rate or breathing. Differences across the age and gen-\nder groups are also shown.\nThe last section of Table 2 shows total weekly physical\nactivity excluding stair climbing. Two thirds of the sample\nwas found to have reported some weekly physical activity,\nand the average total number of minutes of physical activity\nlikely to report some weekly activity and achieved more\nminutes on average than the 70 and older age group. Simi-\nlarly, men were more likely to report any activity than\nwomen and completed more minutes when they were active.\nSelf-efficacy.--For each of the two self-efficacy dimen-\nsions, higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy. Table 3\npresents the results for the sample as a whole, and by age\ngroup and gender. The self-efficacy scores indicate that re-\nspondents were a little to somewhat confident of their abil-\nity to perform the activities and durations (i.e., efficacy ex-\npectations), and somewhat to very confident that the activi-\nties and durations would improve their health (i.e., outcome\nexpectations). Women had significantly poorer efficacy ex-\npectations, and the older age group had significantly poorer\noutcome expectations.\nKnowledge and perceived barriers.--Table 3 presents in-\nformation on physical activity knowledge and perceived\nbarriers among the RPAHS sample respondents.\nOn average respondents answered fewer than three of the\nsix facts about exercise questions correctly, and scores were\nTable 2.

Similarly, the\nolder age group was less likely to report that their physician\nhad mentioned or discussed physical activity.\nPerceived barriers to physical activity were very preva-\nlent. Two thirds reported that physical symptoms kept them\nfrom exercising more often. Pain was reported among 50%,\nand fear of chest pain (21%) or shortness of breath (29%)\nwere also common (not shown). The vast majority per-\nceived environmental barriers; 75% noted weather as a bar-\nrier and crime was a concern for 50% (not shown). Motiva-\ntion was a barrier for about one half of the respondents, but\njust 12% reported time as a barrier (not shown).\nMultivariate Analysis\nIn bivariable analyses not shown, all of the physical ac-\ntivity knowledge, perceived barrier, and self-efficacy ques-\ntions of Table 3 were found to be significantly associated\nwith weekly physical activity. The model of Table 4 pre-\nsents hierarchical, multivariable associations between the\nsociodemographic, knowledge, perceived barriers (includ-\ning health and chronic disease), and self-efficacy measures\nof Tables 1 and 3 with minutes of weekly physical activity.\nTotal minutes of physical activity was skewed, so it was\n60 or more (20%) minutes for these analyses. The same re-\nsults were found with the third and fourth categories col-\nlapsed to one category, and with the third and fourth cate-\ngories expanded to four categories rather than two.\nLooking across the models of Table 4, it can be seen that\neach block of variables added approximately 6% to the vari-\nance accounted for in minutes of physical activity. The final\nmodel accounted for 17% of the variance. Older age was as-\nsociated with slightly less physical activity, and that associa-\ntion did not change with the incorporation of additional\nblocks of variables, including health and chronic disease. Fe-\nmale gender, fair or poor health, and symptom barriers were\nall associated with less physical activity, and the effect of\neach was somewhat reduced with the incorporation of self-\nefficacy measures. The association of motivation barriers was\nnot reduced with the incorporation of self-efficacy. The asso-\nciation of efficacy expectations was highly significant, but the\nassociation of outcome expectations was not.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (1996)\nhas recommended a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate\nphysical activity per week. Just 10% of the RPAHS respon-\ndents reported 150 minutes per week. The average weekly\nnumber of minutes of total physical activity was 79 in the\nyounger age group, whereas the 70 and older age group av-\neraged just 48 minutes of total physical activity per week\n(obtained by multiplying the percent active by the mean\nnumber of minutes of activity; not shown). Women aver-\naged 57 minutes of total physical activity per week,\nwhereas men averaged 78. Efficacy expectations were\nhigher among men and outcome expectations were higher\nin the older age group. Scores on the facts-on-exercise quiz\nsuggest that important information about exercise and\nphysical activity may be lacking within this population.\nPerceived barriers were very prevalent in all groups.\nTable 4.

The associations of perceived\nhealth and symptom barriers were somewhat reduced with the\nincorporation of self-efficacy into the model, but the associa-\ntion of motivational barriers was not. The facts-on-exercise\nquiz score was not associated with physical activity. The\nstrongest correlates of weekly physical activity that are po-\ntentially modifiable were motivation barriers and efficacy ex-\npectations. In some contexts, living status and perceived\nhealth might also be modifiable. The final model accounted\nfor just 17% of the variance in physical activity, but other re-\nports have accounted for just 12 to 15% with similar mea-\nsures (e.g., Sallis et al., 1992). Clearly, work remains to be\ndone in the theory and measurement of physical activity.\nThe reliability of the physical activity questions devel-\noped for the RPAHS study will require more investigation.\nThe test-retest reliability was just 0.59 for minutes of physi-\ncal activity per week. The PASE had a test-retest reliability\nutes of physical activity, however, is likely to be less reli-\nable than a measure based on hours of physical activity. As\nwe found in our pilot test of the PASE, there was consider-\nably less variability in hours of physical activity than in\nminutes of physical activity. An individual might state that\nhe or she never walks more than one hour per day, but may\nwalk 10 minutes one day and 30 minutes the next. It is also\nimportant to note that we do not know the extent of short-\nterm fluctuations in physical activity.\nOur data suggest that public health campaigns to increase\nknowledge of physical activity and its importance have not\nreached this most vulnerable population. Although primary\ncare centers are a site for access to such populations, it may\nnot be practical to rely on providers to increase physical ac-\ntivity knowledge and behavior. The relatively numerous per-\nceived barriers to physical activity found among RPAHS re-\nspondents and the complexity of self-efficacy suggest that\nefforts far beyond a quick screen for and endorsement of\nphysical activity will be necessary among those who most\nneed physical activity education and assistance. Like physi-\ncal activity measures, existing physical activity promotional\nmaterials available to providers were not developed with the\ninclusion of patients most in need of physical activity pro-\nour models suggest that greater knowledge and outcome ex-\npectations are not associated with physical activity. This is\nconsistent with intervention studies that have found educa-\ntion to be necessary but insufficient for changing physical\nactivity behavior (Dishman & Buckworth, 1996).\nSocially and medically vulnerable patients will have to be\nincluded in research and promotion if the public health bene-\nfits of physical activity are to be fully realized. The greatest\ngains in public health via physical activity will come when\npersons who are sedentary adopt moderate-intensity physical\nactivity (Powell & Blair, 1994). The public health costs of\nphysical inactivity are substantial. Resources, research, orga-\nnization, and training will be required to make professionals\nand communities effective in physical activity promotion.\nWhether such efforts can be done in a cost-effective manner\nwill need to be addressed. At present there are no studies\navailable to estimate the costs and few to estimate the out-\ncomes of physical activity counseling and promotion.\nFurther work will be needed to validate the findings of\nthis study. Few have attempted to survey physical activity\nknowledge and behavior in disadvantaged populations, and\nwe have found that existing instruments are inappropriate\nfor these populations. This leaves our conclusions open for\nquestion; we developed new measures specifically for this\npopulation and have only been able to partially assess their\nreliability and validity. We did not capture data on physical\nactivities such as gardening and housework, which have\nbeen used as examples of moderate exercise in recent litera-\nture. Focus groups indicated that these activities are rela-\ntively limited in this population and there is debate about\nwhether such activities hold health benefits, particularly if\nthere is no perception of exertion. Further work is needed to\ndetermine the frequency and benefit of these activities.\nThe physical activity data contained in the RPAHS survey\nare based on self-reports of primary care patients of one pri-\nmary care site. Their reports are not representative of those\nof older urban primary care patients in general. It must be\nkept in mind that all of the physical activity data are self-\nreports. It is not typical that White men are underrepresented\nin research, but they may in fact by underrepresented in\nthese data. The focus group was smallest and the survey\nsample was smallest among White men, particularly in the\nolder age group. In addition, with cross-sectional data we\nare only able to identify associations between variables and\nhave relied on theoretical models to direct our conclusions.\nEven with these limitations, these data are valuable in that\nthey provide a first look at the physical activity behaviors,\nself-efficacy, knowledge, and perceived barriers of a group\nthat is difficult to access but has an urgent need for in-\ncreased physical activity. Given the limited physical activity\nfound in this survey of disadvantaged older adults, further\nefforts to understand behaviors of this population would\nseem to be a very important research topic.\n"
