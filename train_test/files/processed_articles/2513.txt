Given the small\nscale of operations of these businesses, catering\nmostly to customers in the local community, it is\nhighly plausible that businesses owned by low-caste\nowners face discrimination at the hands of customers,\nsuppliers and lenders, since their caste status is easily\nidentifiable, unlike in large businesses with complex\nownership and management structures, where observ-\ning the caste of the owners might be less straightfor-\nward. However, discrimination could be directed\ntoward larger low-caste businesses too: In personal\ninterviews, rich SC entrepreneurs have discussed their\nindividual battles with caste discrimination as they\nstarted their businesses.3 There are other ethnographic\nindicate the presence of persistent disadvantage and\ndiscrimination in the self-employment arena, which\nforms the motivation for the present study.\nTo the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper\nto examine caste gaps in earnings from household\nbusinesses for India. We use the India Human\ntwo methodologies for understanding the earnings\nstructure of businesses: OLS estimation of mean\nearnings for businesses owned by SCs and STs and\nnon-SCST businesses; and quantile regressions for a\ndistributional analysis to look beyond the mean and to\nunderstand `what happens where' in the earnings\ndistribution. Correspondingly, we use decomposition\nstrategies to decompose the earnings gap between\nSCST and non-SCST businesses into explained and\nunexplained components (with the latter being indica-\ntive of discrimination), at the mean and at various\nquantiles of the earnings distribution.4\nOur main findings are as follows. There are clear\ndifferences in observable characteristics between\nSCST and non-SCST businesses. The latter are more\nurban, record larger number of total man-hours, have\nbetter educated and richer owners, and are more likely\nto have a business in a fixed workplace. These\ndisparities get reflected in both indicators of business\nperformance in the data--gross receipts and net\nincome--such that SCSTs, on average, perform\nsignificantly poorly compared to non-SCSTs. The\nBlinder\u00adOaxaca decomposition reveals that depend-\ning on the specification of variables, assuming that the\nnon-discriminatory earning structure is that of non-\nSCSTs, at least 20 % of the net income gap could be\nattributed to the unexplained or the discriminatory\ncomponent. Unconditional caste gaps in earnings are\nhigher at lower percentiles than at the higher per-\ncentiles. Thus, we find some evidence supporting a\n`sticky floor,' a phenomenon observed in the context\nof gender wage gaps in developing countries (e.g., Chi\nsitions based on our preferred specification reveal that\nthe unexplained component is significant in the middle\npart of the distribution (viz., between the fourth and\neighth deciles), where it hovers around 15 % of the\ntotal gap in earnings.\nIn addition to contributing to the broader literature\non racial and ethnic disparities in small business\nownership from a developing country perspective, this\npaper has significant policy implications, particularly\nin the context of the current discourse on `Dalit\nCapitalism' in India--inspired by `Black Capitalism'\nin the USA--by the Dalit Indian Chamber of Com-\nmerce and Industry (DICCI).5 DICCI believes that\nDalits should enter business and industry sectors as\nentrepreneurs and use this route to become `job givers,\nand not job seekers' especially for others in their own\ncommunity and enhance their wealth, instead of being\ndependent on the state for benefits. However, the\nmajority of Dalit businesses are small, owner-oper-\nated, survivalist household enterprises that do not have\n2 The Employment\u00adUnemployment Survey conducted by the\nNational Sample Survey (NSS) collects data on earnings of\nsalaried employees and casual workers, but not of the self-\nemployed.\n3 See, for instance, interviews in Outlook Business, May 2,\n4 Large Indian data sets such as the NSS and Economic Census\ndefine four broad social groups: Scheduled Castes (SCs),\nScheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and\nFootnote 4 continued\n`others.' `Others' is a reasonable approximation of the upper\ncastes.

Deshpande, S. Sharma\nthe potential to generate either employment or wealth\n(Deshpande and Sharma 2013). Further, our results\nindicate that discriminatory tendencies that exist in\nlabor markets may characterize business operations as\nwell.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows:\nSect. 2 contains a literature review; Sect. 3 outlines\nthe methodology; Sect. 4 discusses the data and\ndescriptive statistics; Sect. 5 presents the results,\nwhile Sect. 6 discusses our findings. Section 7\nconcludes.\n2 Review of related literature\ndescriptive analyses using Indian Economic Census\ndata document caste differences in non-agricultural\nenterprise ownership and performance.6 They find\nSCs and STs to be underrepresented relative to their\npopulation shares. Enterprises owned by SCSTs are\nsmaller in terms of number of workers, hire mostly\nfamily labor, rely less on external sources of finance\nand operate mostly in the unregistered unorganized\nsector as compared to enterprises owned by non-\nSCSTs. Deshpande and Sharma (2013) examine unit-\nlevel data from two successive censuses of the micro-,\nsmall and medium enterprises (MSME) sector to study\nthe nature of participation of marginalized groups in\nself-employment and found that the MSME sector\nexhibits very clear differences along business owners'\ncaste and gender, in virtually all business\ncharacteristics.\nThis evidence of systematic differences, however,\ndoes not prove discrimination; all the gaps in perfor-\nmance could, in principle, be accounted for by\ndifferences in characteristics of SCST and non-SCST\nbusinesses.7 For example, in the USA, racial dispar-\nities in asset ownership and family background in self-\nemployment (with blacks being more disadvantaged\nthan whites) are among the most important factors\nleading to differences in business creation and\nperformance (Dunn and Holtz-Eakin 2000; Hout and\nRosen 2000). However, even after controlling for\ndifferences in characteristics, a significant proportion\nof the performance gap remains unexplained and that\ncould be on account of discrimination or some\nunobserved differences in behavior such as ability\nand risk aversion or some factors not amenable to\nmeasurement.\nDiscrimination manifests itself in self-employment\nprimarily in the form of consumer and credit market\ndiscrimination. For example, Borjas and Bronars\n(1989) study consumer discrimination and find that\nrelative gains of entering self-employment are reduced\nfor ethnic minorities because they have to compensate\nwhite consumers by lowering prices charged for goods\nand services. Coate and Tennyson (1992) study credit\ndiscrimination assuming that lenders are unable to\nobserve entrepreneurial ability. Individuals from a\ngroup discriminated against in the labor market will\nreceive less favorable terms in the credit market since\nlenders know that for such individuals, the opportunity\ncost of entering self-employment is lower, and, thus,\nthey are willing to take more risks. Such groups will be\ncharged higher interest rates, thereby reducing the\nexpected returns from self-employment. Empirical\nanalyses using data from the USA show that the\nprobability of loan denials and rates of interest charged\non approved loans is higher for black-owned busi-\nnesses than whites (Blanchflower et al. 2003) and\nprobability of loan renewals is lesser for black- and\nHispanic-owned businesses (Asiedu et al. 2012).\nSection 6 discusses the evidence from Prakash\nothers, to understand possible channels of discrimina-\ntion against Dalit businesses in India.\n3 Methodology\n3.1 Blinder\u00adOaxaca decomposition framework\nWe first use the Blinder\u00adOaxaca method to decom-\npose the mean earnings gap from self-employment\nbetween SCSTs and non-SCSTs into portions\nattributable to differences in characteristics (the\nexplained component or composition effect) and\ndifferences in returns to these endowments (the\nunexplained component or coefficients effect) (Blin-\n6 Audretsch et al. (2013) use NSS data to explore the influence\nof religious and caste affiliation on occupation choice. They find\nSCs and STs to be less likely to be self-employed.\n7 The fact that SCSTs possess inferior characteristics suggests\nsome `pre-market' discrimination (Deshpande 2011; Thorat and\nDisadvantage and discrimination in self-employment\ncomponent can be attributed to discrimination, it is\nhighly plausible that this residual also includes the\neffects of either unmeasurable or unobservable char-\nacteristics. All decomposition exercises are subject to\nthis caveat. However, it is equally true that some pre-\nmarket discrimination affects the formation of char-\nacteristics, and thus, the explained component also\nembodies the effects of past discrimination. Therefore,\nestimates of the unexplained component from decom-\nposition exercises should not be taken as precise\nmeasurements of `true' discrimination, but as rough\nestimates, providing orders of magnitude.\nThis method involves estimating earnings equa-\ntions separately for individuals i of the different\ngroups g, SCSTs (group s) and non-SCSTs (group n):\nwig\n\u00bc Xg\ni\nbg \u00fe ug\ni\nwhere g = (n, s) denotes the two groups. The depen-\ndent variable w is the natural log of earnings. Xi\nis the\nvector of covariates for individual i, which contains\ncharacteristics that would determine earnings. b is the\ncorresponding vector of coefficients, and u is the\nrandom error term.\nThe gross difference in earnings between the two\ngroups can be written as:\nG \u00bc \nXn ^\nbn \u00c0 \nXs ^\nIn order to decompose this gap, some assumptions\nhave to be made about the earnings structure that\nwould prevail in the absence of discrimination and\nconstruct counterfactual earnings functions. One\ncounterfactual could be constructed by assuming that\nthe non-discriminatory earnings structure is the one\napplicable to non-SCSTs.8 In that case, the counter-\nfactual earnings equation of the SCSTs would be\nwritten as:\nwc\nis\n\u00bc Xs\ni\nbn \u00fe vs\ni\nAdding and subtracting the counterfactual earnings\nto Eq. (2), we arrive at:\nG \u00bc \nwn \u00c0 \nws \u00bc \nXn \u00c0 \nXs\n\u00f0 \u00de^\nbn \u00fe \nXs ^\nbn \u00c0 ^\nbs\n \nwhere the first term on the right-hand side represents\nthe part of the earnings differential due to differences\nin characteristics and the second term represents\ndifferences due to varying returns to the same\ncharacteristics. The second term is the unexplained\ncomponent and is considered to be a reflection of\ndiscrimination.\nThe decomposition is sensitive to the choice of the\nnon-discriminatory earnings structure, as the two\ncounterfactuals yield different estimates. To get\naround this `index number problem,' one solution is\nto use the pooled estimates as the single counterfactual\n(Oaxaca and Ransom 1994). Another solution, sug-\ngested by Cotton (1988), is to construct the non-\ndiscriminatory earnings structure as a convex linear\ncombination of the earnings structures of both groups.\n3.2 Quantile regression decomposition\nframework\nGeneralizing the traditional Blinder\u00adOaxaca decom-\nposition to analyze earnings gaps at different parts of\nthe earnings distribution, Machado and Mata (2005)\nproposed a decomposition method that involves\nestimating quantile regressions separately for the two\nsubgroups and then constructing a counterfactual\nusing covariates of one group and returns to those\ncovariates for the other group.\nThe conditional earnings distribution is estimated\nby quantile regressions. The conditional quantile\nfunction Qh\n(w|X) can be expressed using a linear\nspecification for each group as follows:\nQh wg\njXg\n\u00bc XT\ni;g\nbg;h\nwhere g = (n, s) denotes the two groups. w is the\nnatural log of earnings. Xi\nis the set of covariates for\nindividual i, bh\nare the coefficient vectors that need to\nbe estimated for the different hth quantiles. The\nquantile regression coefficients can be interpreted as\nthe returns to various characteristics at different\nquantiles of the conditional earnings distribution.\nNext, Machado and Mata (2005) construct the\ncounterfactual unconditional earnings distribution\nusing estimates for the conditional quantile regres-\nsions, which consists of the following steps:\n1. Generate a random sample of size m from a\nuniform distribution U [0,1]\n8 One could also construct an alternative counterfactual by\nassuming that the non-discriminatory earnings structure is the\none applicable to the SCSTs. However, the counterfactual based\non the non-SCST earnings structure is more intuitively appeal-\ning, as non-SCSTs are not discriminated against on account of\ntheir caste identity.\nA. Deshpande, S. Sharma\n2. For each group, separately estimate m different\nquantile regression coefficients\n3. Generate a random sample of size m with\nreplacement from the empirical distribution of\nthe covariates for each group, Xs,i\nand Xn,i\n4. Generate the counterfactual of interest by mul-\ntiplying different combinations of quantile coef-\nficients and distribution of observables between\ngroup s and group n after repeating this last step\nm times.\nStandard errors are computed using a bootstrapping\ntechnique.\nThis simulation-based estimator relies on the\ngeneration of a random sample with replacement to\nconstruct the counterfactual unconditional earnings\ndistribution and comes at the cost of increased\ncomputational time. Melly (2006) proposed a proce-\ndure that is less computationally intensive and faster\nby integrating the conditional earnings distribution\nover the entire range of covariates to generate the\nmarginal unconditional distribution of log earnings.\nThis procedure uses all the information contained in\nthe covariates and makes the estimator more efficient\nthan the one suggested by Machado and Mata (2005).\ndecompositions are numerically identical when the\nnumber of simulations in the latter goes to infinity.\nWe construct a counterfactual for the SCST group\nusing the characteristics of SCSTs and the earning\nstructure for non-SCSTs here:\nh\n\u00bc XT\ns;i\nbn;h\nThis yields the following decomposition:\nDh\n\u00bc Qn;h\nh\n\u00fe CFs\nh\n\u00c0 Qs;h\nThe first term on the right-hand side represents the\neffect of characteristics (explained component) and\nthe second the effect of returns to characteristics\n(coefficients effect or unexplained component).\n4 Data and descriptive statistics\nWe use the India Human Development Survey (IHDS)\nvillages and 971 urban states in 33 states of India. The\nmodules of the survey collect data on a wide range of\nquestions relating to economic activity, income and\nconsumption expenditure, asset ownership, social\ncapital, education, health, marriage and fertility, etc.\nThe survey module on household non-farm busi-\nnesses does not identify the primary decision-maker in\nthe business. However, we can identify specific\nmembers in the household who worked in the business\nand the amount of time they spent, in terms of days per\nyear and hours per day. Using that information, we\nassume that the person who has spent maximum\nnumber of hours in the business is the de facto\ndecision-maker.\nWe restrict the sample to those states where there\nare at least 50 household businesses, leaving us with\n22 states.9 We consider only male businesses (i.e.,\nwhere men are the primary decision-makers) in the\nmain analysis because factors affecting selection into\nself-employment vary along lines of gender; addition-\nally, in order to delineate the effect of caste, we need to\nhold gender constant, so as not to confound the effect\nof overlapping identities.10\nThe data canvasses information on two measures of\nfinancial performance of the business: net income and\ngross receipts. Our primary dependent variable is the\nlog of net income from the business over the last\n12 months. Net income is computed as gross receipts\nless hired workers' wages less cost of materials, rent,\ninterest on loans, etc. One issue on which the data are\npatchy is the use of unpaid family labor in these\nbusinesses, which would affect the calculation of net\nincome. While some businesses in the data report the\nindividual components as well as a net income, others\nreport only the net income. However, our queries with\nthe IHDS team revealed that when hired labor is not\nreported, it cannot be assumed that no labor was\n9 These states are: Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh,\nPunjab, Uttaranchal, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh,\nBihar, Tripura, Assam, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa,\nChhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra\nPradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\n10 In Appendix 2, we report results of the mean decomposition\nfor the sample of 1099 businesses where the primary decision-\ntotal sample of 1099 females is not sufficient to estimate\nquantile decompositions with precision, we do not estimate\nthose. Using the non-SCST coefficients, 68.7 % of the mean\nearnings gap is explained using our preferred specification, with\n31 % remaining unexplained.\nDisadvantage and discrimination in self-employment\nactually hired. Thus, data do not allow us to clearly\ndistinguish between hired and unpaid family labor,\nresulting in the inability to estimate `true' net income.\nWe, thus, use the net income figures in the data as\nreported. While expenditure-based indicators have\nbeen found to be more reliable than income-based\nmeasures in developing countries--on accountof recall\nerrors, non-response and deliberate mis-reporting--for\nan analysis focusing onenterprise performance, income\nis the most appropriate outcome to consider.\nAs explanatory variables, we use individual-speci-\nfic variables such as age, marital status and standard\nyears of education completed of the decision-maker;\nhousehold-specific variables such as wealth (proxied\nby asset ownership), rural/urban status, whether\nsomeone close to or within the household is an official\nof the village panchayat/nagarpalika/ward committee\nand membership in the following: business or profes-\nsional group; credit or savings group; caste associa-\ntion; development group and agricultural, milk or\nother co-operative; and business-specific variables\nsuch as number of family members who worked in the\nbusiness, total number of hours put into the business,\nwork place type and industry type.11 Admittedly,\nbusiness-specific variables and some household-speci-\nfic variables such as membership in different types of\nnetworks and wealth are potentially endogenous with\nrespect to business performance. However, as Fortin\net al. (2011) argue, decompositions are accounting\nexercises that allow one to quantify the contribution of\nfactors to the difference in outcome between two\ngroups without necessarily shedding any light on the\nmechanisms explaining the relationship between such\nfactors and outcomes.\nAs our sample is limited to only those households\nthat operate businesses, a potential limitation of our\nestimations is that coefficients of earnings regressions\nmay be biased since individuals and households do not\nrandomly select into self-employment. Unfortunately,\nour data set does not provide us with suitable instru-\nments to correct for selection.\n4.2 Descriptive statistics\nTable 1 lists the summary statistics for the whole\nsample and for the sample of SCST and non-SCST\nbusinesses separately. Of the total 7288 businesses,\nIn terms of performance, the average net income for\nfor SCST businesses (Rs. 25,640). A similar pattern\ncan be seen in the average gross receipts. Figure 1\nplots the kernel density distribution of log income for\nSCST and non-SCST businesses. The distribution of\nincomes of non-SCST businesses lies distinctly to the\nright of the SCST businesses.\nThis large difference in business performance could\nbe on account of a variety of characteristics, in most of\nwhich there are clear differences between SCSTs and\nnon-SCSTs. The primary decision-maker is on aver-\nage 39 years old, and 86 % of them are married. These\nnumbers are similar across SCST and non-SCST\ndecision-makers. However, average years of educa-\ntion differ significantly by caste, with 8.3 years for\nnon-SCSTs and 5.7 years for SCSTs.\nThere is a distinctly different pattern in the rural\u00ad\nurban distribution across castes with 33 % of SCST\nhouseholds and 53 % of non-SCST households being\nlocated in urban areas. There is also disparity in\nmaterial standard of living as reflected in asset\nownership, in that out of the 16 assets in the\nquestionnaire, non-SCSTs own approximately 8,\nwhile SCSTs own around 5.13 We create a wealth\nindex using principal components analysis and divide\nthe sample into three groups following Filmer and\n(poor), middle 40 % (middle) and the top 20 % (rich).\nBy this somewhat arbitrary definition, 65.2 % of\nSCST households fall in the poor category, while\n42.7 % of SCSTs and non-SCSTs, respectively, are in\nSCSTs are rich.\n11 Definitions of variables are available in Appendix 1.\n12 Since the decomposition methodology is applicable only to\npairs of groups, we club together relatively similar groups, albeit\nwith intra-group heterogeneity, into two broad dissimilar\ngroups.\n13 The IHDS data contain information on the ownership of the\nfollowing 16 items (binary variables): cycle/bicycle, sewing\nmachine, generator set, mixer/grinder, air cooler, motorcycle/\nscooter, black and white television, color television, clock/\nwatch, electric fan, chair or table, cot, telephone, cell phone,\nrefrigerator and pressure cooker.\nA.

In\ngeneral, participation in such networks is low. 8 % of\nall businesses are members of business or professional\ngroups with membership of SCST businesses being\nbelow average (5 %). Participation in credit or savings\ngroups does not differ by caste, covering roughly 7 %\nof owners. Membership in caste associations is 14 and\n12 % for non-SCST and SCST businesses, respec-\ntively. Membership in development groups and co-\noperatives is miniscule across the board. In terms of\npolitical networks, 12.5 % of SCSTs have someone in,\nor close to, their household who has been an official in\nlocal bodies, while for non-SCSTs, the corresponding\nfigure is 10.6 %.14 Overall, there is no discernible\npattern in network participation of the two groups in\nour data.\nThese gaps in performance could also be related to\nother characteristics, such as (a) the number of family\nmembers who worked in the business: SCST busi-\nnesses have greater than average number of family\nmembers working in the business (1.47), as compared\nto non-SCST businesses (1.37); and (b) the total\nnumber of hours put in by everyone working in the\nbusiness: Non-SCST businesses record 1.3 times more\nhours than their SCST counterparts.\nIn terms of business location, about 25 % of\nbusinesses are home-based, and this proportion does\nnot differ by caste. 34 % of SCSTs and 20 % of non-\nSCSTs have mobile workplaces, while the proportions\nof non-SCSTs and SCSTs with fixed workplaces are\n55 and 39, respectively. To the extent a fixed\nworkplace indicates permanency, it suggests that\nnon-SCST businesses are more stable and less\nmakeshift.\nThe most important sector for these businesses is\n`wholesale, retail trade and restaurants and hotels,'\nwhich include activities such as running of `kirana'\n(neighborhood grocery) stores, other grocery and\ngeneral stores, and petty shops. 56 % of non-SCST\nbusinesses and 44.5 % of SCST businesses are\ninvolved in this sector. About 13 % of businesses are\nin manufacturing activities, and this proportion does\nnot vary by caste. The major activities here are\nblacksmiths, carpenters and flour mills. About 16 % of\nbusinesses are in the `community, social and personal\nservices' sector. This includes activities such as\nbarbers, cycle repair shops and tailoring. These\nexamples also corroborate our intuition that these\nbusinesses are engaged in low-end activities, and are\nmore survivalist than entrepreneurial.\nApproximately 6.5 % of businesses are in the\n`transport, storage and communication' sector, with\nthe proportion being the same across castes. Overall,\nonly 4 % of businesses are in the primary sector\n(agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing), but 15 %\nof SCST businesses are in this sector. Proportions in\n`construction' and `financing, insurance, real estate\nand business services' are small, involving only about\n2 % of businesses each. Businesses engaged in\n`mining and quarrying' and `electricity, gas and\nwater' sectors are practically non-existent, as\nexpected, since these highly capital-intensive activi-\nties are not conducive to self-employment.\n5.1 Earnings function estimates\nTable 2 reports the OLS estimates with log income as\nthe dependent variable, for the pooled sample, and\nseparately by caste. We present estimates using two\nspecifications. Specification 1 uses only exogenous\nexplanatory variables. This includes age and age\nsquared (as proxies for experience), whether married\nor not, years of education, whether urban or not, and\nstate of residence. Specification 2 is more exhaustive\nand also includes potentially endogenous variables. In\nFig. 1 Kernel density of log income\n14 This could possibly reflect the operation of the mandatory\n22.5 % caste quotas in local bodies for SCSTs.\nA. Deshpande, S.

As expected, earnings have a\nquadratic relationship with the decision-maker's age\nsuch that earnings initially increase with age and start\nto decline thereafter. Businesses operated by more\neducated owners also perform better indicating that\nmore years of formal education may be associated\nwith higher managerial ability and business acumen.\nHouseholds owning more assets are able to overcome\nliquidity constraints more easily, and we find that\nasset-rich households own more profitable businesses.\nBusinesses in urban locations perform better possibly\ndue to proximity to markets and easier availability of\ninformation. The number of hours spent working is\npositively correlated with income, as expected. Busi-\nnesses based on other fixed locations (outside of the\nhome) and that are mobile are correlated with higher\nincomes than home-based businesses.\nPooled regressions impose the restriction that the\nreturns to included characteristics are the same for the\ntwo caste groups. Since this assumption is not realistic,\nparticularly in the Indian context, we also report caste-\nspecific OLS regressions. Caste-specific OLS esti-\nmates indicate that some variables--particularly those\nrelated to memberships in business or professional\ngroups, development groups and credit groups--\ncorrelate in different ways with performance of SCST\nand non-SCST businesses.\n5.2 Decomposition of the mean earnings gap\nThe results of the Blinder\u00adOaxaca decomposition with\nlog income as the dependent variable are presented in\nTable 3.16 Panel A and Panel B of Table 3 display the\ndecomposition results using specification 1 and spec-\nification 2, respectively. Within each of these panels,\nwe report results using: coefficients from a pooled\nmodel over both groups as the reference coefficients;\nnon-SCST coefficients, i.e., how SCST businesses\nwould fare if they were treated like non-SCST\nbusinesses; and SCST coefficients, i.e., how non-\nSCSTs would fare if they were treated like SCSTs.\nIt is apparent that as more variables are added in\nmoving from Panel A to Panel B, the explained\nproportion increases and the unexplained proportion\ndecreases significantly. In Panel B, in the presence of\nnon-SCST coefficients, the unexplained component is\n19 %. Using SCST coefficients, we see that the\nunexplained proportion is 10.05 %, and for the pooled\nmodel, the corresponding value is 16 %. Following\nBanerjee and Knight (1985), we can take the geomet-\nric mean of the estimates based on the SCST\ncoefficients and non-SCST coefficients to yield a\nsingle estimate of the unexplained component which\nWhich of the variables contributes the most to the\nexplained component? The lower panel of Table 3\nshows the contribution of selected significant charac-\nteristics to the overall explained part of the income\ngap. Using the first specification, years of education\ncontributes 39\u00ad42 % of the explained component,\ndepending on the counterfactual earnings structure.\nUrban location also accounts for 37\u00ad44 %. However,\nin the second specification, the importance of years of\neducation and urban location declines significantly to\naround 5 and 8 %, respectively, and number of hours\nand asset ownership emerge as the dominant variables,\neach accounting for approximately 30\u00ad40 % of the\nexplained component. Since variables such as years of\neducation and urban location are generally positively\ncorrelated with asset ownership, it is not surprising\nthat upon controlling for the latter, the relative\nimportance of education and location declines.\n15 As a robustness check, we also estimated three specifica-\ntions: one with purely personal characteristics; second with\npersonal and household characteristics, and third one being the\nsame as the full specification with all variables. The results,\nrobust to alternative specifications, are available from the\nauthors upon request.\n16 This is done using the STATA program `oaxaca' (Jann\nA. Deshpande, S. Sharma\n5.3 Quantile regressions\nFor quantile regressions, we use the same two\nspecifications of the earnings function that we used\nfor the OLS regressions. The average gap in log\nincomes of non-SCST-owned and SCST-owned busi-\nraw net incomes of the two types of businesses. This is\ninstructive, but when we juxtapose this against the log\nincome gap for the different quantiles, we see that\nrestricting the analysis to only mean gaps misses a\nlarge part of the bigger picture. Broadly speaking, as\nFig. 2 indicates, while the uncontrolled log income\ngap is positive throughout the distribution, the gap is\nhigher for low-income businesses as compared to\nhigh-income businesses, with the gap for those at the\nbeing substantially higher than the gap at the 75th and\nphenomenon of higher gaps at lower levels of the\nearnings distribution is similar to the `sticky floor'\nphenomenon observed in the gender wage gap liter-\nature. Sticky floors are broadly defined as declining\nearning gaps as one moves from lower to higher\nquantiles of the earnings distribution (e.g., Arulam-\ndeveloped countries that are characterized by `glass\nTable 3 Blinder\u00adOaxaca decomposition of log income\nPanel A Spec. 1 Panel B Spec. 2\nPooled\ncoefficients\ncoefficients\nSCST\ncoefficients\nPooled\ncoefficients\ncoefficients\nSCST\ncoefficients\nContribution to explained component\nYears of\neducation\nTotal person-\nhours\nRobust standard errors clustered at the district level in parentheses\n*** Significant at 1 %, ** significant at 5 %; * significant at 10 %\nFig. 2 Caste log income gap across percentiles and average gap\n17 Specifically, Arulampalam et al. (2007) define a sticky floor\nas the 10th percentile wage gap being higher than the 25th\npercentile wage gap by at least two percentage points.\nDisadvantage and discrimination in self-employment\nceilings' (i.e., increasing wage gaps as one moves\nfrom lower to higher quantiles), several developing\ncountries reveal a sticky floor, for instance India\nVietnam (Pham and Reilly 2007). In fact, Carrillo\net al. (2014) find that gender wage gaps in poorer and\nmore unequal countries exhibit sticky floors, whereas\nglass ceilings characterize richer and less unequal\nones, using a sample of 12 Latin American countries.\nTables 4 and 5 report quantile regression results for\nthe two specifications, respectively, for the pooled\ncentiles. The estimates show that controlling for\nvarious characteristics reduces but does not eliminate\nthe caste gap observed in Fig. 2. In Table 5, even with\nthe most inclusive specification, the caste dummy\nremains negative and significant, but compared to\nTable 4, its magnitude is much smaller at each of the\npercentiles. The sticky floor no longer prevails as in\nTable 4. The caste income gap increases from 10 % at\nthe 10th percentile to 16 % at the median, declines to\n10 % at the 75th percentile and increases again up to\nResults of caste-specific quantile regressions are\nreported in Tables 6 and 7. Results from Table 7\nindicate that while being married and years of\neducation are associated positively with income for\nnon-SCSTs, they are not significant for SCSTs. Being\nlocated in urban areas and number of hours spent in the\nbusiness seems to confer greater benefits at the lower\nend of the earnings distribution than at the higher end,\nfor both groups. On the other hand, gains from asset\nownership are mostly increasing across the distribu-\ntion for both groups. Returns to other fixed or moving\nworkplaces appear higher at all percentiles for SCSTs\nas compared to non-SCSTs.\n5.4 Quantile decompositions of log income gaps\nWe conduct the quantile decompositions separately\nusing both specifications.18 Table 8 shows the sum-\nmary results with the raw difference, characteristics\n75th and 90th percentiles using the non-SCST\nTable 4 Quantile regression: specification 1 (pooled sample)\nRobust standard errors clustered at the district level are reported in parentheses for OLS.

As noted previously, another set of\nestimates could be obtained using the SCST coeffi-\ncients (Table 9).\nIn both Tables 8 and 9, as with the mean decom-\nposition, we note that upon including more explana-\ntory variables in specification 2, the proportion\nexplained increases. Based on non-SCST coefficients\nand focusing our attention on specification 2\n(Table 8), we find that the raw log income gap shows\na generally declining trend, first decreasing from 0.95\nat the 10th percentile to 0.57 at the median and then\nremaining fairly flat thereafter. The proportion of the\nincome gap due to differences in characteristics lies in\nthe range of 84\u00ad87 % and then increases to about\n91 % at the 90th percentile. Using the SCST coeffi-\ncients (Table 9), the proportion explained is slightly\nlower. Differences in characteristics account for about\nat the median and 82 % at the 90th percentile.\nMirroring these trends, we find using both coun-\nterfactuals that the unexplained component is some-\nwhat larger at the lower end of the conditional earnings\ndistribution than at the higher end. In Table 8, using\nthe second specification, the unexplained share decli-\nnes from 12 % at the 10th percentile to approximately\n8 % at the 90th percentile. While with the non-SCST\nearnings structure, the coefficients effect is significant\nfor the businesses in the middle range of the earnings\ndistribution (median and third quartile), with the SCST\nearnings structure, the unexplained component is\nstatistically significant throughout the distribution.\nFigures 3 and 4 plot the raw gap, the contribution of\ncharacteristics and that of coefficients at each per-\ncentile of the earnings distribution using the second\nspecification for the non-SCST and SCST coefficients,\nrespectively.\n6 Discussion\nAs mentioned earlier, the unexplained component is\nthe residual gap that remains after all characteristics\nare accounted for. It measures the influence of other\nunmeasured and unobserved factors, including dis-\ncrimination. For instance, the IHDS data do not\ncontain information on family background in running\nan enterprise, type of customer base, risk aversion of\nthe owner, etc., all of which previous literature has\nshown to affect enterprise performance. Similarly,\nTable 7 continued\nStandard errors in parentheses are bootstrapped using 100 replications. *** significant at 1 %. State of residence and industry dummy variables included\n** Significant at 5 %; * significant at 10 %\nA. Deshpande, S. Sharma\nthere are characteristics such as ability or motivation,\nwhich cannot be measured but can affect the earnings\ngap. Similarly, as noted earlier, the explained compo-\nnent could include pre-market discrimination.\nWhile we cannot test empirically the channels\nthrough which discrimination manifests itself, there\nexist studies that qualitatively document the presence\nof active discrimination against SCST businesses.\nbusinesses in 13 districts spread across 6 states in India\nreports difficulty in obtaining initial formal credit in\norder to set up an enterprise, resulting in informal\nloans being taken at high interest rates. The ones who\ndid successfully obtain institutional credit were those\nin partnerships with upper castes or had local political\ncontacts that facilitated loan approvals.

Jodhka (2010) through detailed interviews with\nDalit entrepreneurs in two towns in northwest India\nfinds that caste works as a direct and indirect barrier in\nthe successful running of their businesses. Most of\nthem report difficulties on account of their Dalit\nidentity in mobilizing finance and getting a space to\nstart their enterprise. A majority of them felt that their\ncaste identity was perceived as more important than\ntheir professional identity, which led to them being\nseen as `odd actors' in the local community.\nAnother unobserved factor that could constrain\nenterprise performance is geographical segregation.\nResidential segregation is still prevalent in India with\nDalits living in their own segregated neighborhoods. If\nthe main customer base of SCST enterprises is their\nown community--and given that SCSTs are on\naverage poorer and have lower purchasing power--\nthey may have to keep their prices low in order to cater\nto members of their own group. For example, Clark\nand Drinkwater (2000) explain that ethnic enclaves\ncan be a source of advantage or disadvantage. While\non the one hand, a concentration of co-ethnics\nprovides a captive market for producing ethnic goods\nthat hold particular appeal for the community, on the\nother hand, if the ethnic group is poor, then businesses\nsetup by members of these groups may actually\nlanguish.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper, our objective has been to assess the\npresence of caste-based discrimination in small\nhousehold businesses using the large-scale nationally\nrepresentative India Human Development Survey of\nfare significantly worse in terms of owner's education,\nhousehold economic status and business characteris-\ntics, as compared to their non-SCST counterparts.\nUsing the non-SCST counterfactual earnings struc-\nture, at least 20 % of the mean earnings gap between\nbusinesses owned by SCSTs and non-SCSTs cannot\nbe explained by differences in characteristics. Further,\nwe find that there is substantial heterogeneity in raw\nearnings gaps across the earnings distribution reveal-\ning a sticky floor, thereby necessitating the use of\nquantile regression-based decomposition methods.\nThese indicate that the proportion of the earnings\ngap on account of differences in characteristics is\ngenerally increasing in the higher deciles of the\nconditional earnings distribution.\nThis paper focuses on one part of the IHDS data set,\nviz., data related to household non-farm business,\nwhere we see clear evidence of caste-based disparities\nin earnings and other business characteristics, as well\nas the existence of discrimination. Desai and Dubey's\nFig. 3 Quantile decomposition of log income gap: non-SCST\ncoefficients\nFig. 4 Quantile decomposition of log income gap: SCST\ncoefficients\nA. Deshpande, S. Sharma\n(2011) analysis based on the entire IHDS data set\nsuggests that our findings fit into the larger pattern of\npersistence of caste inequalities, which results in\ninequalities in opportunities as well as inequalities in\noutcomes. They find an increase in civic and political\nparticipation by marginalized groups, but also docu-\nment how economic and educational disparities con-\ntinue to flourish.\nIn addition to being the first to examine this\nquestion for India, this paper's findings confirm\npatterns that have been observed in the context of\nracial and ethnic differences in entrepreneurship in\nother countries such as the USA and UK. However,\nunlike the USA, for instance, where a number of\nmigrant groups such as the Koreans and Japanese have\nused self-employment as a way to achieve upward\neconomic and social mobility that does not appear to\nbe the case for India, as suggested by our findings and\nalso those in Iyer et al. (2013) and Deshpande and\nSharma (2013). This also suggests that the exuberance\nsurrounding Dalit Capitalism may be somewhat\nmisplaced since the reality of most SC and ST\nbusinesses is in stark contrast to the success of a few\nDalit billionaires.\nThe simultaneous existence of discrimination\nagainst SCs and STs in self-employment and wage\nemployment presents serious challenges for public\npolicy, further complicated by the existence of `pre-\nmarket' discrimination for Dalits which results in\nlower and poorer quality of educational and skill\nattainment. While caste-based job quotas in India\ntarget public sector-salaried employment, that may not\nbe the appropriate instrument to tackle discrimination\nfaced by the self-employed. One such recent move is a\n2012 public procurement policy for micro- and small\nenterprises (MSE) that mandates 4 % of government\nprocurement to be from MSEs owned by SCs and STs.\nOther multi-pronged measures, based on more\nresearch, need to be devised that would tackle\ndiscrimination in both spheres. For instance, looking\nat the entrepreneurial success of migrant groups in\ncountries such as the USA and UK indicates that\nFairlie's (2006) suggestion of stimulating business\ncreation in sectors with high growth potential (e.g.,\nconstruction, wholesale trade and business service)\nmight be one effective element of public policy for\npromoting job creation and increasing earnings,\nespecially in areas where marginalized groups are\nconcentrated.\nA larger question is the relationship between\nearnings and wealth, and whether an increase in\nearnings (from businesses and elsewhere) is sufficient\nto close the wealth gap between communities. Barsky\net al. (2002) find that roughly two-thirds of the mean\ndifference in wealth between blacks and whites in the\nUSA can be explained by differences in earnings from\nall sources, which suggests that substantial wealth gaps\nremain even after controlling for earning differences.\nWhether an increase in business ownership by SCs and\nSTs translates into narrowing wealth gaps would have\nto be the subject matter of a future exercise.\n"
