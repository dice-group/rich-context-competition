    "abstract": "Abstract\nMultiplex viewing of static or dynamic scenes is an increasing feature of screen media. Most\nexisting multiplex experiments have examined detection across increasing scene numbers, but\ncurrently no systematic evaluation of the factors that might produce difficulty in processing\nmultiplexes exists. Across five experiments we provide such an evaluation. Experiment 1\ncharacterises difficulty in change detection when the number of scenes is increased. Experiment\n2 reveals that the increased difficulty across multiple-scene displays is caused by the total amount\nof visual information accounts for differences in change detection times, regardless of whether this\ninformation is presented across multiple scenes, or contained in one scene. Experiment 3 shows\nthat whether quadrants of a display were drawn from the same, or different scenes did not affect\nchange detection performance. Experiment 4 demonstrates that knowing which scene the change\nwill occur in means participants can perform at monoplex level. Finally, Experiment 5 finds that\nchanges of central interest in multiplexed scenes are detected far easier than marginal interest\nchanges to such an extent that a centrally interesting object removal in nine screens is detected\nmore rapidly than a marginally interesting object removal in four screens. Processing multiple-\nscreen displays therefore seems dependent on the amount of information, and the importance of\nthat information to the task, rather than simply the number of scenes in the display. We discuss the\ntheoretical and applied implications of these findings.\n",

However, we are commonly presented with\ninformation that traverses multiple displays, such as multiple monitor computer setups,\nmulti-scene television viewing (e.g. some news channels), and banks of monitors in CCTV\ncontrol rooms (Stainer, Scott-Brown, & Tatler, 2013b). Any potential benefit of maximising\nthe amount of visual information in this way must depend crucially on the limits of the\nhuman observer in processing this information (Attwood & Effron, 2006). While these\nmulti-scene displays have permeated the way we interact with media, little is understood\nabout how theory of scene perception generated from single scene viewing applies in these\nmultiplex viewing conditions which not only present the visual system with an increased\nvisual load, but also introduce further potential sources of processing difficulty - such as\nthe need to manage attention conflicts not only within a scene, but also between the scenes\nin a display.\nThe factors that underlie the allocation of gaze when looking at multiplexed scenes may\nnot be the same as found in single scene viewing, such as the frame of reference around\nwhich inspection is organised during a multiplex scene-memorisation task (Stainer, Scott-\nBrown, & Tatler, 2013a). Moreover, when given the choice, expert CCTV operators view\ncontent on their single scene spot-monitors rather than the multiplexed wall of monitors,\nsuggesting both a reliance on prior knowledge to guide their search for crime, and an\nunderstanding of the difficulty of processing such large data loads (Stainer et al., 2013b).\nResearch into processing multiple scene displays has tended to focus on the decrease in\ndetection performance associated with multiplex viewing (e.g. Tickner & Poulton, 1973),\nhowever, as of yet a systematic evaluation of the factors that might influence difficulties\nin multiplex viewing has not been conducted. We used a change detection task to explore\nthe contribution of several potential sources of processing difficulty in multiple-scene\ndisplays based on previously observed relationships between items in a scene, or an\narray of scenes.\nIncreased information content\nSet-size effects demonstrate that the number of distractor items in an array correlates very\nstrongly with search latencies (Wolfe, 1998). Correspondingly, the time to detect changes to\narrays increases when the number of items increases (Bravo & Farid, 2004; Rensink, 2000;\nZelinsky (2001) have further demonstrated that change detection in natural scenes is related\nto the number of objects within the scene, however, the number of objects in each of these\nexperiments was relatively easy to distinguish (for example, there was little overlap between\nobjects), whereas segmenting natural scenes is not always such a simple process. Yokosawa\nand Mitsumatsu (2003) revealed that when only a certain number of segments of a visual\nimage was shown in a change detection task, change detection performance scaled with the\namount of visual information. Research has begun to address alternative ways to quantify\nthe amount of visual information that is contained in real-world scenes (Asher, Tolhurst,\n& Nakano, 2007). Regardless of how visual information is quantified, the overwhelming\nmessage is that a larger amount of measured visual information tends to correlate with\nlonger search times.\n2 i-Perception\nPhysical extent of the display\nGiven acuity limits in the peripheral retina, increasing the physical extent of a search array is\nlikely to influence search performance. This is demonstrated in the well-documented effects of\neccentricity in visual search (Carrasco & Chang, 1995; Carrasco & Yeshurun, 1998; Wolfe,\nO'Neill, & Bennett, 1998). In complex scenes, the physical extent of the scene on the display\nchanges viewing behaviour: while larger scenes necessarily result in larger saccades, when\nsaccade sizes are expressed relative to the size of the scene, larger scenes result in relatively\nsmaller saccade amplitudes (von Wartburg et al., 2007). However, physical size effects may be\nmore complex than larger displays simply resulting in worse search performance. Ball and\nNorth (2005) partially separated the influence of display size from that of the visual content\nof a scene by comparing search of a scene displayed over a multiplex of 1, 4 and 9 displays.\nThe search array was initially scaled to each display size, with participants able to pan and\nzoom in the images (to effectively make the targets the same size on the monoplex as the\nnonaplex). The authors noted, however, that participants preferred not to use these controls,\nand were more likely to physically navigate the images in zoomed out mode. Search\nperformance for small targets was better for the 9-screen multiplex (nonaplex) arrays than\nfor the 4-screen (quadraplex) or single screen (monoplex) displays. They argued that this\nmight be due to the larger display allowing a higher level of detail of small targets.\nPhysical discontinuity\nAn additional consequence of presenting information across a multiplex display is that\ncontent is often separated by physical space, either by the bezels of a monitor, or by\nartificial windowing. In Varakin and Levin (2008), when a scene was simply segmented\ninto four sections by windows, detection performance was unaffected by this artificial\nwindowing. Similar patterns of results have also been found in visual search tasks across\nmultiple monitors (Bi, Bae, & Balakrishnan, 2010; Hutchings, Czerwinski, & Meyers, 2004;\nTan & Czerwinski, 2003), suggesting that search for targets is unaffected by the presence or\nabsence of a physical separation, or boundaries between content. When boundaries are\nintroduced between the four quadrants of a scene, fixation selection is only significantly\nchanged when the order of the quadrants are also scrambled (Stainer et al., 2013a). Thus,\nthe mere presence of boundaries may not influence attention, but only when coherent scene\nstructure can be perceptually bridged across the gaps.\nSemantic discontinuity\nVisual and semantic similarity between items influences search performance. In terms of\nvisual similarity, targets become harder to detect as target-distractor similarity increases (J.\nBeck & Ambler, 1973; Treisman & Gelade, 1980), or as variance in the distractor items\nincreases (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989; Smith, Pickett, & Trutschl, 1998). Semantic\nsimilarity between target and distractors can also influence search performance. When\nsearching for a target presented with distractors from the same category (e.g. the number\n4 presented among other numbers), search times are longer than when searching for the same\ntarget among distractors from another category (e.g. the number 4 among letters; see Jonides\n& Gleitman, 1972). These effects of semantic category can be shown to arise from\nendogenous understanding of the display rather than purely physical visual properties:\nJonides and Gleitman (1972) used the physically identical symbol O, but varied whether\nthey told participants to search for the digit zero or the letter o. In this situation the same\nStainer et al. 3\nbetween-category search benefits were shown depending upon the instructions given to the\nparticipants. However, subsequent studies failed to replicate this finding (Duncan, 1983), and\nit was proposed that category effects disappear when items are matched in physical properties\n(Krueger, 1984). More recently, Lupyan (2008) varied the conceptual but not visual\nvariability between distractors in a search task. Targets (letter-like shapes) were easier to\nfind when the distractors were conceptually homogenous (distractors were B and b, thus\nsharing the conceptual representation of the same letter) than when distractors were\nconceptually heterogeneous (e.g. B and p as distractors, thus representing different letter\nconcepts). This effect was even stronger when participants were asked to verbally label the\ncategories. It seems consistent that categorising objects in a search task (either in a perceptual\nor conceptual manner), improves both search times and efficiency (Wolfe, Friedman-Hill,\nLuck and Vogel (1997) suggested that as the number of items in an array increases, it is\nlikely that as each item introduces an amount of visual information load associated with the\nobject. If a new item is semantically similar to those already in the display, then each object\nshould be associated with a lesser demand on working memory than objects that are different.\nAlvarez and Cavanaugh (2004) found that both the number of objects, and the visual\ninformation load associated with those objects influenced change detection. However,\nBarton, Ester, and Awh (2009) found that the variance between items in a change\ndetection task (e.g. the display was either made up of cubes, or Chinese characters, or a\nmix of both) did not influence peoples ability to detect changes. In multiple-scene displays,\ncompetition for attention does not only exist between the items within a scene, but also\nbetween the different scenes in the multiplex. Greene and Wolfe (2011) asked participants\nto determine whether scenes with a particular global property were present or absent in\ndisplays containing arrays of one to four scenes. They found that search was inefficient\nwhen there was more than one scene on the display. Thus, it is unclear if semantic\ninformation at a scene level (which is inherently a global property of each scene: it is the\nsum of the information contained in the scene) would be processed when attending to the\nmultiplex, or whether the multiplex itself is treated as one global semantic unit containing\nlocal variance in content (i.e. between scenes) much as is true of the local variance within\nsingle scenes.\nViewing multiple scenes\nAlthough multiplex displays present these challenges for human perception, to date,\nsurprisingly little research has considered how we attend to multiplex displays. Notable\nexceptions include studies of rapid processing of briefly presented multiplex displays.\nRousselet, Thorpe, and Fabre\u00adThorpe (2004) studied animal detection performance in\nbriefly presented scenes. These authors found that increasing the number of scenes\npresented simultaneously from 1 to 2 to 4 scenes resulted in increases in reaction time.\nBehavioural costs when faced with increasing numbers of scenes had been previously\ndemonstrated by Tickner and Poulton (1973) using a surveillance-based task (also see\nHoward, Gilchrist, Troscianko, Behera, & Hogg, 2011). These authors showed that when\nmonitoring simultaneous feeds from cameras in a prison, the accuracy with which\nparticipants detected suspicious events was lower when the number of simultaneously-\nviewed camera feeds was high; with 83% for 4 monitors, 84% for 9 monitors and 64% for\n16 monitors. Similarly, Wallace, Diffley, Baines, and Aldridge (1997) examined participants\ntarget detection across multiple scenes and found decreases in performance when increasing\nthe number of scenes presented in the town centre CCTV array.\n4 i-Perception\nThe present study\nIn this series of experiments, we use change detection to explore processing of multiple scene\ndisplays. The flicker paradigm is, as has been shown (e.g. in Rensink, O'Regan, & Clark,\n1997), a convenient laboratory paradigm for studying how attention is allocated to complex\nvisual scenes, with successful detection of a change being contingent upon the allocation of\nattention to the site of the change (Cohen, Cavanagh, Chun, & Nakayama, 2012; Henderson\n& Hollingworth, 1999), which is not necessarily guaranteed upon fixation. Thus the time\ntaken to locate a change reflects how long it took participants to attend to the location of the\nchange. Change detection has the further advantage in the study of attention allocation in\nthat the target does not need to be defined before the trial, therefore reducing the utility of\ncontextual guidance that can inform visual search tasks for a target which has a learned\nspatial relationship with an environment (e.g. clocks tend to be on walls, not ceilings;\nTorralba, Oliva, Castelhano, & Henderson, 2006). Such contextual cueing can serve to\nreduce the area over which an observer must search for a target (Zelinsky & Schmidt,\n2009). Providing no prior information about the identity of the changed item means\nparticipants could expect the target to be in any location in the scene or multiplex.\nWe used the flicker paradigm with trials in which a single changed item in one of the scenes\nwas presented in a display amongst several unchanging scenes. In Experiment 1 we assessed\nhow change detection is affected by increasing the number of scenes displayed simultaneously\nfrom 1 to 4 to 9 scenes (monoplex, quadraplex and nonaplex respectively). This experiment\nallowed us to characterise performance decreases across our multiplexes. In Experiment 2\nand 3 we tease apart the potential sources of this processing difficulty. In Experiment 4, we\nask whether knowing about the scene containing the change alters the task difficulty. Finally,\nExperiment 5 examines how semantic importance of the changed item affects multiplex\nchange detection difficulty.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 examined change detection performance in monoplex, quadraplex and\nnonaplex displays to characterise performance difficulty in our task. Attentional allocation\nwas indexed by considering the latency and accuracy of change detection performance using a\nsurvival analysis technique (explained in methods below). Given previous literature on multi-\nscene viewing (Tickner & Poulton, 1973; Wallace & Diffley, 1998), increasing the number of\nscenes displayed simultaneously will result in longer latencies for change detection.\nMethods\nParticipants. Fifteen undergraduate psychology students took part in Experiment 1 in\nexchange for course credit. Participants in all studies reported here reported normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision. Participants provided written consent to take part in each of\nthe experiments presented in this paper. The research was approved by the University of\nDundee Human Research Ethics Committee, and conducted in accordance with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nStimuli. 126 digital colour photographs of city centre scenes were used for Experiment 1. The\nphotographs were 400 \u00c2 300 pixels in size (those that were above were cropped or scaled to\nthis size). Of these, 27 photographs were randomly selected to be target images where changes\nwere made to a single item using Adobe Photoshop. These items were removed using the\nStainer et al. 5\n`cloning' tool, where the changed item was replaced with appropriate estimated background\ntexture. This technique makes it possible to change items that are overlapping, such as\ndigitally removing a person standing in front of a shop window. Examples of items that\nwere digitally removed include windows, people, chimneys, road markings, shop signs and\ncars (see Figure 1). Changes were designed to ensure that both the pre- and post-changed\nscene were physically plausible (for example a lamp-post would not be removed, leaving a\ngravity-defying floating light). The changes were to items that were definable as discrete\nobjects and care was taken to ensure that image or editing flaws did not reveal the\nlocation of the change. Accordingly, correct detection of change would require the\nobserver to have inspected both pre- and post-change versions of the stimulus image\nrather than by them perceiving digital image flaw `pop-out'.\nFigure 1. Two representative example scenes in pre and post-change format. The changed items in each\nscene is indicated by the white circle. (A) A disappearing van, (B) a disappearing chimney.\nFigure 2. Monoplex, quadraplex and nonaplex displays of a single pre-changed scene in each of the three\nconditions. The target scene appears in the bottom left of quadraplex and in the centre of the nonaplex\ndisplay in this figure. During the experiment, the location of the changing scene in the multiplex arrays was\nrandomised.\n6 i-Perception\nStimuli were presented in monoplex, quadraplex or nonaplex displays (see Figure 2 for\nsample arrangements). Displays were presented in a random order, and were\ncounterbalanced so that the changed photograph could exist in any position of the four,\nor nine possible display positions. Stimuli were piloted [n\u00bc5] to ensure that when presented in\nmonoplex format, average detection was made in fewer than 10 alternations.\nApparatus. Stimuli were presented on a 24inch iMac 3.06GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4GB\nexperiment was programmed and run using MatLab version 7.8.0, using PsychToolbox\napproximately 60 cm, with the monitor subtending an approximate 40 degree visual angle\nhorizontally. The size of a single scene was 400 \u00c2 300 pixels, the inter-scene distance for\nmultiplex arrays was 50 pixels vertically and horizontally.\nProcedure. Participants viewed 27 trials containing one, four or nine scenes (with 9 trials of each\ntype of display). The experiment used a modified flicker paradigm (see Figure 3). The original\ntarget image and accompanying foil images (for all multiple scene versions) were displayed for\n500 milliseconds, followed by a blank lasting 250 milliseconds. The display then showed the\nmodified target image and foils for 500 milliseconds, followed by a second blank of 250\nmilliseconds. This sequence continued in a loop either until correct detection was made\n(indicated by a button press, and the participant verbally reporting the changed item and\nclicking on the scene that contained the change in the multiplex versions), or until the cut-\noff point of 180 alternations (four and a half minutes). This cut-off point was chosen following\npilot work; this allowed most of the changes to be detected, even for nonaplex displays, but\navoided the demotivating and frustrating situation for participants when changes were not\ndetected for very long periods (as prior piloting found that some changes in nonaplexes could\ngo undetected for over 5 minutes viewing). Trials were presented in a random order, interleaved\nacross conditions. Between participants, stimuli were counterbalanced across the three\nconditions such that each scene appeared equally in each of the monoplex, quadraplex and\nnonaplex displays.\nAnalysis. Data in these experiments were analysed using Cox Regression survival analysis, a\ntechnique that has previously been used for event history style examination of data (Hirose,\nFigure 3. Example of modified flicker paradigm stimulus in nonaplex format (adapted from Rensink et al., 1997).\nStainer et al. 7\nKennedy, & Tatler, 2010; Pannasch, Dornhoefer, Unema, & Velichkovsky, 2001). This method\nuses observed performance to plot the likelihood of a change being detected at any given instance\nin time during the trial (given that the participant has not previously detected the change).\nDuring piloting for this study, participants often struggled to detect changes (particularly in\nnonaplex displays), thus prompting the addition of a set time-out point of four and a half\nminutes for each trial. By using survival analysis it is possible to take into account trials where\nparticipants were unable to detect the change (i.e. in a medical experiment these would be trials\nin which participants have `survived' the trial). Survival analysis also provides a change\ndetection probability at the end of the trial time limit that represents the overall\nperformance (how many trials were successfully detected). Thus the analysis incorporates\naspects of both time and accuracy in the task, which is preferable to simply removing the\ntrials where participants were unable to detect the changes within the given time limits. For\nthis use of survival analysis, the assumption is made that, given an unlimited amount of time\nparticipants will at some point detect the change in all trials across all conditions. Here the figures\npresented are inverse survival functions of the data. The method means is it possible to effectively\nplot the probability that a change will be detected at any given time point (given that it has not\npreviously been detected). This presentation of the data is more readily interpretable than\nplotting the survival functions themselves, which plot the probability that the change will not\nbe detected at any given point in time, and is similar to interpret to cumulative frequency curves.\nData were analysed using the survival (Therneau & Grambsch, 2000) package in R. We\nreport Wald statistics, which quantify whether the survival model parameters are better fit\nwhen a factor of interest - such as (in this case) the number of scenes - is included. The\nstatistical comparison tests for the degree of overlap between survival functions, with the\nnull hypothesis being that the functions are superimposed. As Wald values increase, this\nrepresents an increasing difference in performance between conditions. For pairwise\ncomparisons between levels, we report z scores. All participants' data are included in each\nmodel, with the individual variance accounted for by using the cluster function. This\nmeans, that each participant is represented multiple times in the data - but as each\nparticipant completed the same number of trials across each condition in each experiment,\nthat all participants are represented equally in the analysis.\nResults\nA strong, significant association of scene number with detection speed and accuracy was\nfound (Wald (2) \u00bc 323.3, p < .001), with participants detecting changes more rapidly in single\nscene viewing than quadraplex and nonaplex versions of the task. Figure 4 demonstrates that\nby 100 s after the onset of the flicker display, changes in single scenes were almost at 100%\nprobability of being detected (i.e. the probability of detection is close to 1). At the same point\nin time, the probability of detecting a change within a quadraplex display was about 0.7, and\neven lower at about 0.5 for nonaplex scene viewing. The levels of scene number (monoplex,\nquadraplex and nonaplex) were compared using Forward Difference coding (mono vs quad,\nquad vs nona). There was a significant difference in detection performance between monoplex\nand quadraplex displays (z \u00bc 10.26, p < .001) and between quadraplex and nonaplex displays\nDiscussion\nExperiment 1 examined change detection in monoplex, quadraplex and nonaplex displays to\nestablish the constraints on detection performance when searching for a change in a pictorial\n8 i-Perception\narray when the nature of the visual change was unknown, and the number of distracting\nscenes was varied systematically. The time taken to detect changes in monoplex displays was\nsimilar to that reported in previous change detection studies using the flicker paradigm (such\nas Rensink et al., 1997). In quadraplex displays not all changes were detected within four and\nhalf minutes. Final accuracy fell from approximately 99% for monoplex to $92% for\nquadraplex. Accuracy was further reduced for nonaplex displays, with only $73% of\nchanges detected within 180 alternations between the modified and unmodified versions of\nthe display.\nOne explanation for multiplex detection difficulties is the increase in the physical extent of\nthe visual array when adding multiple scenes, however, increasing the number of scenes in a\nmultiplex array also necessarily increases the total amount of information in the display.\nFurthermore, multiplexes introduce physical separation between scenes. All of these factors\n(physical extent of the search array, information content of the display and physical\nseparation) may introduce behavioural costs for change detection.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 examined three possible sources of multiplex detection difficulty based on the\nconsequences of presenting multiple scenes as opposed to presenting one scene. Firstly,\nadding scenes (while maintaining image size ratio) increases the physical visual angle over\nwhich information is displayed. Secondly, an increase in the amount of visual information\ncompared to a scene shown on its own increases the number of possible change locations. The\nthird possible cause is that the difficulty is not due to the visual content, but that performance\nis driven by the segmentation of a multiplex display into a set of physically separated\n`windows', as is typically found for multiplex displays.\nPhysically larger arrays usually lead to longer search times (Carrasco & Chang, 1995),\nhowever, the inherent structure of real-world scenes may reduce the effect of the increased\nFigure 4. Inverse survival plots for monoplex, quadraplex and nonaplex change detection.\nStainer et al. 9\nphysical display size (Ball & North, 2005). To examine whether the total physical area\noccupied by the images influences change detection, change detection performance was\ncompared when a scene was displayed at 400 \u00c2 300 pixels to performance when displayed\nat 800 \u00c2 600 pixels. This allowed control of the presentation of identical visual content, but\nmanipulates the total physical area over which observers must search for the change.\nTo manipulate the influence of visual information content in displays, participants were\npresented with one quadrant of the original scene (the quadrant containing the change) at\n400 \u00c2 300 pixels and performance was compared in this condition to performance when\nthe entire scene was displayed at the same size (400 \u00c2 300 pixels). Thus the physical extent\nof the image was constant, but the information content differed between these two\nconditions.\nTo assess the influence of the physical segmentation of a multiplex display (with each scene\npresented in a separate `window') change detection performance when a scene was presented\nin 800 \u00c2 600 pixel format was compared with performance when the same scene was\npresented, but split into four 400 \u00c2 300 quadrants and separated by 50 pixel spaces. This\nmanipulation allowed us to consider whether multiplex displays are difficult to process for\nchange detection because of the separation of information into separate panels. Such\ndiscontinuity may, for example, result in the viewer parsing the display into a set of\nseparate scenes, dealing with each as a separate perceptual `unit'. If viewing information in\nthis way disrupts people's ability to detect changes it would suggest that the spatial\narrangement, as opposed to the visual content, of the multiplex display impacts upon\nattentional allocation in multiplex arrays. In Stainer et al. (2013a), we found only a very\nminimal (and not significant) change in viewing behaviour when scenes were split into\nquadrants and moved 50 pixels apart. Varakin and Levin (2008) found no effect of\nwindowing on change detection performance, however, given the aims of the previous\nresearch, the window frame was overlaid on top of the scene, whereas here we moved the\ncontent apart to examine whether physical separation (in a condition with no loss of content,\nto examine whether detection performance was affected.\nThe three main experimental comparisons of Experiment 2 are illustrated in Figure 5,\naddressing three questions. Firstly, to what extent does the physical size of a display influence\nchange detection? Secondly, can increasing the amount of information in a display account\nfor the difficulties in detecting changes across multiple scenes? Finally, does the division of a\nscene into four scene sections create the same difficulties as moving from a monoplex to a\nquadraplex display?\nMethods\nParticipants. Fifteen students participated in exchange for course credit. All participants had\nnormal or corrected-to-normal vision. None had participated in Experiment 1.\nStimuli. Thirty-two photographs of city centre scenes were used. Photographs were scaled to\n800 \u00c2 600 pixels in size and prepared in four ways. They were either presented whole (large),\nsplit into four quadrants (separated) and presented with an inter-image gap of 50 pixels\nhorizontally and vertically, or scaled by 50% to 400 \u00c2 300 pixels (small). In the fourth\ncondition only the changing quadrant of the large scene version (400 \u00c2 300 pixels in size)\nwas used for presentation. Examples of all display types can be seen in Figure 5.\nProcedure. The task of the participant was to detect a change in a flickering image or image\narray. Participant viewed a total of 32 trials, with eight trials of each display condition.\nExperimental presentation times were the same as the previous experiments, with the\nexperiment cut-off time set to 180 seconds.\nResults\nIn the quadrant condition, change detection was at 100% with all changes being detected by\nthe cut-off point. Detection rates were lower for small, large and large exploded display\nthese conditions.\nAnalysis showed a significant association between display condition and detection\nperformance (Wald (3) \u00bc 98.92, p < .001; Figure 6), though this effect was strongly driven\nby the single quadrant display condition. We examined the differences between conditions by\nchanging the reference condition in the model. Quadrant change detection was indeed\nsignificantly better than performance in large (z \u00bc\u00c07.84, p < .001), separated (z \u00bc\u00c09.5,\nlarge, small and separated conditions (all p-values > .05).\nDiscussion\nThe data showed no significant difference in change detection between the large version of the\nscene and the small version of the scene. When the same visual information was presented on\nFigure 5. Summary of the main experimental hypotheses for Experiment 2 using examples from the\nexperimental image set. (A) Large scene versus small scene conditions where visual content is controlled, and\nphysical display size is manipulated. (B) Small scene versus quadrant condition where physical display size is\ncontrolled and the amount of visual content is manipulated. (C) Large scene versus separated scene\nconditions where visual content and size are controlled, but the number of artificial `scene divisions' is\nmanipulated.\nan area four times larger, change detection was unaffected. While physical display increases\nmay require longer saccade lengths to navigate, the bounds of scene structure, in terms of the\nconsistent spatial relationship between the items in the images in each of these conditions may\ncompensate for the scaling of the image. Similar scaling mechanisms to counteract these\nphysical issues have been proposed in reading (Morrison & Rayner, 1981). The result of\nExperiment 2 demonstrates that increasing physical display size cannot account for the\nincreased change detection times at multiple-scene viewing from Experiment 1.\nParticipants took less time, and detected more changes when presented with a quarter of the\nimage, compared to the whole image presented at the same dimensions. This result suggests\nthat increasing the amount of visual content in a multiplex display influences the difficulty of\ndetecting changes. This suggestion is consistent with studies finding that change detection\ntimes increased when the number of items (and therefore information content) in an array\nnumber of items in a single scene is increased (Beck et al., 2007). This result is entirely\nconsistent with Yokosawa and Mitsumatsu (2003), who found that change detection\nperformance from scenes that were scrambled and had various number of segments\nrevealed, was related to the number of segments, rather than the coherence of the scene.\nWhile performance was influenced by the information content of the scenes, it was not\ninfluenced by whether or not the scene was physically separated into four separate windows\nin the display: there was no difference between the small and the large-exploded version of the\nscenes, where both have the same visual content, but are arranged to appear like the\nmonoplex and quadraplex versions of Experiment 1. Thus the reduction in change\ndetection performance found in quadraplex arrays was not principally a result of the\ndivision into multiple scenes. This corresponds with our previous findings (Stainer et al.,\n2013a) and the findings of Varakin and Levin Varakin and Levin (2008; also see Bi et al.,\nwhere change detection was not influenced when images were presented in windows.\nFigure 6. Inverse survival functions for the four different display conditions in Experiment 2. Note that\nExperiment 3\nWhen participants view a single scene, they only have to process one scene gist. It may be that\nthe demands of processing several scene gists are analogous to findings from visual search\n(such as Treisman & Gelade, 1980), where set-size effects are moderated by the similarity of\nstimuli. If this provides an explanation of the difficulty that participants experience in\nmultiple-scene change detection, then introducing differences in context between scenes\nshould further increase the difficulty of detecting changes (Beck & Ambler, 1973).\nAlternatively, if the variability between the content across scenes does not matter, we\nwould expect that increasing differences in context should not influence change detection\nperformance. To explore this point, in Experiment 3 the similarity of pictorial context\nbetween scenes within a multiplex array is manipulated.\nTo investigate the nature of the semantic relationship between scenes, changing scenes\nwere presented in a quadraplex array of scenes that were scene-consistent (i.e. the additional\nscenes would make up one large picture), scenes that were similar to the target scene (i.e. all\nscenes were of the same semantic category, such as city centres), or scenes that were all of\ndifferent types (i.e. drawn from different semantic categories: Motorways, airports, car parks\nand city centres). Scene categories were selected to contain similar items, and similar focal\nlengths, from locations familiar to the participant group lifestyles but from well-defined easily\ndiscriminable categories. While visual search is influenced by item similarity (both between\ntarget and distractors, and in the distractor set), scene gist has yet to be explored as a factor in\nwhich similarity may affect target search tasks.\nMethods\nParticipants. Fifteen undergraduate students participated in exchange for course credit.\nParticipants had not taken part in either previous experiment.\nStimuli. 144 photographs were collected; 36 of each of the four different scene types; city\ncentre, airport terminal, car park and motorway scenes. Photographs were 800 \u00c2 600 pixels\nrandomly selected to be targets. In the target images, changes were made equally often to\neach of the four quadrants across the image set. Non-target images were split into four\nquadrants, with experimental distractor items being selected equally from the four quadrants.\nStimuli were presented in quadraplex displays in all trials (see Figure 7). The similarity\nbetween the target and distractor scenes was varied across three experimental conditions: The\nthree distractor (i.e. unchanging) quadrants were (1) drawn from the same scene, (2) similar\nFigure 7. Examples of displays where the windows are from the same scene, semantically similar scenes\n(e.g. all city centre) and semantically different scenes.\nscenes (drawn from the same semantic category as the target), or (3) different scenes (drawn\nfrom different semantic categories to the target scene). Presentation order was randomised\nacross trials and the non-changing distractor images were selected randomly for each trial. A\npilot study [n \u00bc 5] ensured that when presented in the image-consistent format, detection was\nmade in fewer than 40 alternations in over 50% of the trials (a level of performance for\nquadraplex displays that is in line with that found in Experiment 1).\nProcedure. Participants viewed 48 trials, with 16 trials of each different condition. In each trial\nthe participants were required to report which of the four quadrants had contained the\nchanging object. The trial cut-off time was set to 120 seconds.\nResults\nCox Regression analysis revealed no significant association between distractor-scene\nsimilarity on detection probability (Wald (2) \u00bc 0.9, p \u00bc .64; Figure 8). Changes were\ndetected at an equal speed and accuracy in scene-consistent, similar and different scene\nconditions.\nDiscussion\nWhile caution must always be drawn from interpreting null effects, survival functions for\nsingle item change detection in quadraplex displays were inseparable using statistical tests,\nregardless of the similarity between the scene gist of the target scene and the three distractor-\nscenes. Of course at some level adding scenes to a display must necessarily increase the\nvariation in semantics across the display: Even images (quadrants) drawn from the same\noverall scene will each have slight variations in semantic content. However, the findings from\nFigure 8. Examples of displays where the windows are from the same scene, semantically similar scenes\n(e.g. all city centre) and semantically different scenes.\nExperiment 3 suggest that the accuracy and response latency for detecting changes in\nquadraplex arrays of photographic scenes are not necessarily influenced by the amount of\nsemantic similarity between the target scene and the three distractors. Thus, even when\nsemantic variation is high - in the case where distractor scenes are each drawn from a\ndifferent category and are all from different categories to the target scene - change\ndetection can proceed in the same manner as when the semantic variation and separation\nbetween scenes is very low - when all images are taken from the same overall scene.\nThese findings contrast with the influence of semantic similarity on search performance in\nmore simple displays. When searching for a target object among distractors search\nperformance is influenced by the semantic similarity between the target and distractors\n(Jonides & Gleitman, 1972). However, when searching for a change within a single scene\nof a multiplex display, the results of Experiment 3 suggest that semantic consistency between\nscenes did not influence performance. One potential consideration is that it is difficult to\nseparate the semantic, and visual similarity of scenes. We did not select scenes with the intent\nof investigating visual similarity, and we cannot therefore rule out the possibility that there\nmay be confounds between these two factors.\nOne possible cause of this pattern of results is that the reason scene gist did not appear to\nbe important is that knowledge of scene gist gave no advantage to the detection task. The\nchange could have occurred in any of the scenes and was not linked to scene semantics,\ntherefore making scene gist less informative. In tasks where scene gist is more task-relevant or\ndiagnostic of the likely change (such as `find the car', making traffic scenes more likely than\nairport terminals to contain a target), the competition between gists may still be more\nanalogous to classic visual search findings.\nThe results from Experiments 1 to 3 seem to indicate that the factors that govern attention\nallocation in the multiplex might be the same as those that have been shown to have influence\nin single scene viewing. This would suggest that people might be treating the multiplex as\nthough it were one scene: i.e. using the whole multiplex as the frame of reference for viewing.\nThis finding is at odds with our previous work where we demonstrated that when a single\nscene was scrambled to form a multiplex, fixations were allocated to each quadrant as though\neach were a single scene (an individual scene-based frame of reference Stainer et al., 2013a).\nThis apparent contradiction might be due to the task of the observer. If observers are able to\nflexibly segment these displays depending on the demands of the task, we could expect that\nthe frame of reference for viewing would determine the factors that influence attention\nallocation. One way to examine this is to ask what happens when we reintroduce the\nimportance of the individual scene-level frame of reference, which we did in Experiment 4.\nExperiment 4\nIn Experiment 4, we gave the participants prior knowledge of which scene the changing target\nwould appear in. Prior knowledge about the spatial likelihood of targets has been shown to\ninfluence the way people search for targets (Torralba et al., 2006; Zelinsky & Schmidt, 2009).\nIn previous change detection experiments, cuing the location of the change by use of a gaze\ncue was found to reduce the deleterious effects of additional pictorial information (Langton,\nO'Donnell, Riby, & Ballantyne, 2006; O'Donnell & Langton, 2003). This finding is consistent\nwith the notion of a narrowing of the search set to relevant locations in the scene. Similar\nnarrowing of the search space has been found when searching for objects in natural images.\nZelinsky and Schmidt (2009) asked participants to search for UFO targets in aerial-view\nmaps. They found that cueing a target's location effectively constrains participants' visual\nsearch to only the cued locations. Previously, various forms of cues have been shown to\nsuccessfully improve the detection of changes in natural images. Scott-Brown and Orbach\n(1998) demonstrated that cueing the location of a changed item in an array of contrast\npatches significantly reduces the threshold of change in contrast required for successful\ndetection. This experiment also provided evidence that cueing reduces the set-size effect in\na change detection task, similar to the findings of cueing subsets of items in visual search\nIf the observer uses a multiplex-based frame of reference for searching for the change, we\nwould expect that the content of the distractor scenes alone (task relevant or not) should\ninfluence attention allocation. In contrast, if performance is improved by cueing, this would\nsuggest that the frame of reference is flexibly fitted to the demands of the task, and that task\nirrelevant content (i.e. the distractor scenes) should not affect detection times.\nMethod\nParticipants. Twelve psychology undergraduate students took part in this experiment. All\ncompleted the experiment for course credit and had not completed Experiments 1 to 3.\nStimuli. Experiment 4 used the same 126 digital colour photographs of city centres as used in\nExperiment 1.\nProcedure. The procedure of Experiment 4 was identical to Experiment 1, except that in half\nof the trials, the location of the changed scene in the multiplex array was cued before each\ntrial for 500 ms by means of a dark grey rectangular cue. The scenes that were provided a cue\nwere counterbalanced across the experiment so that all images were presented equally in the\ncued and un-cued condition.\nResults\nIn the cued condition, changes were detected 100% of the time before the cut-off in all scene\nnumber conditions. In the un-cued conditions performance was comparable to Experiment 1\n(Figure 9).\nThere was a strong relationship between scene number and detection speed in the un-cued\ncondition (Wald (3) \u00bc 160.3, p < .001), showing the same pattern of results as observed in\nExperiment 1. Monoplex was faster than quadraplex (z \u00bc\u00c07.028, p < .001), with nonaplex\nversion taking longer still (z \u00bc\u00c012.103, p < .001). In the cued condition, no such pattern was\nobserved (Wald (2) \u00bc 1.27, p \u00bc .53), with changes being detected at the same performance in\nall conditions (all p-values > .05).\nIn monoplex trials, participants detected the change within 75 s, and typically all changes\nwere detected (Figure 10, upper panel). In the quadraplex format of the un-cued condition,\ndetection accuracy after 75 s is over 20% lower, with the nonaplex detection being\nsignificantly slower. However, in the cued condition, performance was the same across all\ndisplay conditions (Figure 10, lower panel).\nDiscussion\nProviding a cue for the location of the scene containing a change within a multiplex display\nsimplified the change detection task to the extent that survival functions for change detection\nin monoplex, quadraplex and nonaplex were essentially overlapping. This finding contrasts\nFigure 10. Examples of the original image (a), a `heat-map' of the selected locations of interest for the\nimage by the 8 observers (b), and the changed central-interest (c) and marginal-interest (d) versions of the\nimages.\nFigure 9. Inverse survival functions for monoplex, quadraplex and nonaplex detection trials in un-cued\n(upper panel) and cued (lower panel) conditions.\nwith the widely separated survival functions seen in un-cued conditions, where increasing\nscenes in the array were associated with increasing detection latencies and reduced detection\naccuracy. When the target scene in a four or nine scene multiplex was known, the additional\nirrelevant scenes in the array did not affect detection performance. This finding provides good\nevidence that attentional cueing negates the effect of increased visual load of the multiple-\nscene display conditions by limiting the area over which participants need to attend. Further,\nit demonstrates that although in some viewing conditions observers might use multiplex-\nbased frames of reference (Experiments 1 to 3), when beneficial to the task observers\nmight switch to an individual scene-based frame of reference. Importantly this means that\nthe distractor scenes do not appear to affect attention allocation when irrelevant to the\ntask being conducted. Given that there are times when we know, or do not where the task\nrelevant information will be in a display, understanding how people cope with both types of\ntask will be important to understand how people attend to multiplexes in various viewing\nconditions.\nExperiment 5\nExperiment 4 suggested that when target location is known, change detection performance\nwas unaffected by being presented in a multiplex. Another feature that might affect change\ndetection performance is that of the target itself, in particular its importance in the scene.\nRensink et al. (1997) showed that changes to items in a scene that were mentioned in\ndescriptions by at least three of six judges when asked to describe `what the picture was\nabout' were detected significantly faster than items that were not mentioned. This central\nversus marginal interest comparison somewhat mirrors the earlier findings of Yarbus (1967)\nand Buswell (1935) who showed that we prioritise information that is interesting when\ninspecting pictures.\nWhen completing tasks across multiplexes, it is likely that some information is more\ninteresting, or important than others. It is unclear what effect multiplexing might have on\ncentral and marginal interest changes, and whether detection performance will\ntherefore change in the same way for both types of changes as we increase the scene\nnumbers. Experiment 5 sought to examine how such changes are detected across multiplex\ndisplays.\nMethods\nParticipants. Twenty-four students took part in Experiment 5. All participants had not taken\npart in any other experiment.\nStimuli. The stimuli used in Experiment 5 were the same as Experiment 1, except that new\nchanges were made to the images. Each image had two changed versions created. As the\npictures contained less basic narrative than the original Rensink et al. (1997), we used a\nslightly different approach to selecting marginal and central interest items in the images. 8\nobservers naive to the study were asked to click the 5 most ``interesting locations'' in the\npictures. Participants were simply told to select the 5 most interesting locationsy\n\u00a8 \u00a2\u00a7. The\ninstructions meant that participants could select objects that they thought were\nsemantically interesting, or areas that were perceptually interesting. We selected the central\ninterest items as items in the photographs that least 6 out of the 8 observers, with marginal\ninterest items being selected as objects that were clicked on by none. Examples of the selection\nprocess, and example changes can be seen in Figure 10.\nProcedure. The procedure of Experiment 5 was identical to Experiment 1. Marginal and\ncentral interest changes were counterbalanced across the experiment such that each\nparticipant saw trials of central and marginal interest changes, and each scene occurred\nequally across scene numbers and change type. Participants were not told of the marginal-\ncentral change structure until after the experiment when they were fully debriefed.\nResults\nThere was a significant effect of scene number and interest condition on detection\nacross increasing scene number (p-values < .001), and there was a significant difference\nbetween marginal and central interest changes (z \u00bc\u00c06.105, p < .001). We used an ANOVA\nto compare overall proportion of changes that were detected by the cut-off point to examine\nwhether interest and scene number interacted. Figure 12 shows that on overall proportion of\nchanges detected, there was a significant interaction between scene number and interest\nmarginal interest changes than central interest changes.\nDiscussion\nMultiplexing made both central and marginal interest changes more difficult to detect - but\ndifficulty did not increase at the same rate. The difference between performance in central and\nmarginal interest changes increased with scene number, suggesting that detection of\nmarginal-interest changes suffered more from increasing scene number than detection of\ncentral-interest changes. This finding is in line with previous reports of semantic interest\nbeing linked to change detection performance (O'Regan, Rensink, & Clark, 1999; Rensink\net al., 1997), but indicates that with increasing scene number - the difference in performance\nincreases. This finding has important implications for multiplex tasks, where it demonstrates\nthat information that is not important to the task being currently undertaken may be\nprogressively hidden as the multiplex size increases. While previous reports (Tickner &\nPoulton, 1973), and the results here have shown that detection becomes more difficult\nFigure 11. Survival plots for central versus marginal interest changes.\nacross multiplexes, we demonstrate here that semantic interest can modulate the degree to\nwhich performance is affected.\nGeneral discussion\nThe need to assess human perceptual limits objectively when evaluating display technology is\nparticularly underlined by recent research on visual perception that demonstrates not only\nthat our visual awareness may be quite limited, but also that people systematically\noverestimate their ability to process visual information (Beck et al., 2007; Levin, Momen,\nDrivdahl, & Simons, 2000). Previous research on multiplex viewing has tended to focus on\nhow detection of events is related the number of screens in multiplexes (e.g. Tickner &\nPoulton, 1973), but until now there has not been an exploration of the sources of this\nprocessing difficulty. In a series of experiments, we explored several potential candidates\nfor the problems associated with attention allocation when attending to multiplex displays.\nExperiment 1 found that change detection performance became worse as the number of\nscenes increases in a multiplex. The findings from Experiment 2 showed that there was no\nsignificant effect of the contributions of increased physical display area, or whether a scene\nwas displayed intact or segregated into four separate windowed displays (mimicking a\nquadraplex display). However, there was a clear effect of the total amount of visual\ninformation in the display, with more visual information being associated with longer\ndetection latencies. In Experiment 3, the between-scene semantic gist variability between\nscenes could also not account for the difficulties of multiplex change detection. One\ninterpretation of the findings in these three experiments is that despite the challenges\nassociated with attending to a multiplex that are not present when attending to a single\nscene, how people allocate attention might be dependent on many of the same factors that\ninfluence single scene perception. This is somewhat surprising, given the physical and\nsemantic separations and variation between scenes in a multiplex, factors that have been\nFigure 12. Mean proportion of changes detected across observers in the two conditions with 1 \u00c6 SE bars.\nshown to affect performance in tasks when this variance exists between objects in an array\n(Beck & Ambler, 1973; Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Attention allocation here did not appear\nto be disrupted by the need to cross physical and semantic boundaries in multiplex displays.\nNeither was the variation in gist problematic for scene processing: there was no evidence for\ncosts associated with increased semantic variation across scenes. It would appear that of these\npossible sources of difficulty, only the amount of information across the entire display had a\nsignificant impact on how attention was allocated (particularly supporting the findings of\nYokosawa and Mitsumatsu (2003)). These findings taken together suggest that observers\nused the multiplex itself, rather than the components of the `scene units', as the frame of\nreference for inspection. This is somewhat different from the findings of our previous research\n(Stainer et al., 2013a), where we found that fixation behaviour in scrambled scenes (i.e.\nmultiplexes with discontinuity between parts) was driven towards the centre of the scene\nunits, albeit with an early tendency to fixate centrally in the multiplex.\nIn Experiment 4, we examined whether the reason that people appeared to use the\nmultiplex as a frame of reference might that in the change detection task studied, scene\nbounds provided no task-relevant information (i.e. they did not give clues to where the\ntarget was). We reintroduced the importance of the scene bounds by only cueing one of\nthe scenes in the multiplex. This meant that if observers were unable to change frames of\nreference from the entire multiplex, to an individual scene based frame, then performance\nshould be identical to un-cued trials. This would suggest that the additional information itself\nshould cause additional processing difficulty. Given that in multiplex viewing, we might have\nan expectancy of where to find the target of interest, scene bounds would be useful to the\ntask, and therefore we would expect that participants would likely only search the task-\nrelevant scene and be unaffected by the other information. We found support for the latter\nof these two possibilities: observers performed in multiplex cued trials as though there was\nonly one scene in the display.\nPreviously, we observed monitoring behaviour in a real, complex multiplex CCTV\nenvironment (Stainer et al., 2013b). In this study, we found that operators preferred to\nseek out criminal activity on their single scene monoplex display, demonstrating some of\nthe guidance that may be occurring in Experiment 4. By reducing the set-size of a display to\nlocations informed by prior-knowledge (e.g. `Where is a crime likely to appear at this time of\nday?'), multiplex-users are likely seeking to make the task more manageable, effectively\nturning their multiplex into a monoplex.\nExperiment 5 demonstrated that the manner in which change detection performance was\nmodulated by scene number depended on whether the change was semantically important,\nwith an increasing difference between central and marginal interest changes as scene number\nincreased. These findings have clear implications for tasks that occur across multiplex\ndisplays, with prior knowledge of where the target is likely to be, and whether the target is\nsemantically relevant (which it is likely to be so for the task being conducted) both negating\nthe performance costs of multiplexing. This, of course, comes at the detriment of targets that\nare not important to the task that is currently being conducted. In many multiplex\nmonitoring tasks, unexpected events that occur in unexpected locations are no less\nimportant to the task than expected events in expected locations.\nWhat can we generalise from our change detection task to other tasks in the multiplex? The\nreason for using change detection here was to provide a task where the target's location could\nbe anywhere in the scene (it was not cued by scene context as a `find the car?' task would be -\ncueing road areas), and anywhere in the display. There are many tasks conducted on multiplex\ndisplays that share similarities with the change detection task. For example, detection of an\nunattended bag in an airport scene that involves noticing an object that is not in the\n`unchanged' version of the scene. It should be borne in mind that in security scanning, the set\nof possible targets is unknown and unspecified, it is not a general search for an individual or a\nspecific item. However, there are many tasks that involve much more guided searching, such as\nsearching for a face in a crowd. Here, we show that when not all information is relevant to the\ntask, performance seems more related to the subset of cued information. Thus, guidance from\ntarget-scene contextual relationships will likely go some way to making multiplex tasks less\ncomplex. Nevertheless, in difficult multi-screen search tasks, we can predict a similar pattern of\nresults as we report here, where the amount of information critically influences response\nlatency, and scene guidance can reduce search times.\nConclusions\nManyofthetasksthatareconductedacrossmultiplexdisplaysrelyondetectingeventsthatoccur\nsomewhere in the display. Here, we provide the first systematic evaluation of factors that make\nmultiplex detection difficult. Information load appears to be the dominant factor in detection\nperformance, with more information leading to worse performance. It did not matter whether\nthis was from one scene, or many different scenes. If only a subset of the information was\nimportant for the task, observers adjusted their `set-size' to show improved performance (as in\nZelinsky & Schmidt, 2009). If the target itself was important to the scene, changes were\npreferentially detected compared to targets that were not important, with the magnitude of\ndifference increasing with scene number. These findings have important implications for\nconsidering the task of human observers across multiplex displays, particularly given that the\noverriding message from the set of experiments presented here is that detection performance in a\nmultiplex is not as solely driven by the number of scenes in a display.\n"
