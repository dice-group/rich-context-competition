    "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrently, there is a growing field in organization studies, reflecting a stream in social science more broadly, which seeks\nto encompass a process philosophical view of the world as multiple and in constant becoming. However, this raises new\nquestions and challenges to the field of methodology: If movement and process are the basic forms of the universe, then\nthe vagueness and multiplicity that come with the flux of the world are not to be ruled out by rigorous research designs;\nrather, relating to vagueness and multiplicity may be the very precondition of approaching the studied phenomena. For some\nscholars, this has been an occasion for deeming the discipline of methodology `dead' or `emptied'. In contrast to such claims,\nthis article argues that the scholar doing empirical research from approaches drawing on process philosophy to no less\nextent than other scholars must deal with problems of methodological character. However, he or she may need a renewed\nunderstanding of traditional methodological categories such as documentation, validity and variation. Rather than cancelling\nsuch concepts, this article experimentally reconsiders them in a process view, using a piece of observational material to\nthink from. The article suggests that process philosophy may open up a methodological thinking that has room for a more\nconnotative, playful way of relating to research material \u00ad which does not demand from a method to overcome the gap\nbetween what is there and what is captured but makes use of this gap as a space of invitation and play. Rather than adhering\nto the promise of ruling out vagueness and filling out a gap, the article, therefore, in itself aims at being such an invitation for\na connotative, playful methodology.\n",

You, no doubt, imagine seeing a girdle of\nwalls rising from the dusty plain as you slowly approach the\ngate, guarded by customs men who are already casting oblique\nglances at your bundles. Until you have reached it you are\noutside it; you pass beneath an archway and you find yourself\nwithin the city. If this is what you believe you are wrong;\nPenthesilea is different.\nIn this way, the traveller in Italo Calvino's novel Invisible\nCities begins his tale of Penthesilea, one of the cities he\ndescribes for the old emperor Kublai Khan. Khan's power is\nin a state of decline, he fears his empire is falling apart, but\nin the traveller's descriptions, he seeks the lost order: `One\nday when I know all the emblems', he asks the traveller,\n`shall I be able to possess my empire, at last?' But the travel-\nler answers. `Sire, do not believe it. On that day you will be\nan emblem among emblems'. Still, the emperor asks the\nworld to show itself as a mapped territory of land, resources,\nbuildings, cities and so on; by knowing it all, he hopes to\nregain the power to possess and master it. However, Marco\nPolo, the Venetian traveller, does not bring back this over-\nview; rather, he brings in the details, the unusual, the infinite,\nthe dreamlike, that which is only half glimpsed from the\nDocumenting the invisible \u00ad on the `how' of\nprocess research: (Re)considering method\nfrom process philosophy\nEva Pallesen\n Keywords\nMethodology, process philosophy, organization studies, play\nCentre for Leadership and Experience Design, University College\nAbsalon, Roskilde, Denmark\nCorresponding author:\nEva Pallesen, Centre for Leadership and Experience Design, University\nCollege Absalon, Trekroner Forskerpark 4, 4000 Roskilde, Denmark.\nEmail: pallesen.eva@gmail.com\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\ncorner of the eye. After a while, Kublai Khan starts to doubt\nthe reality of the traveller's tales of the cities: Is it actually\nthe territory out there \u00ad the cities of his empire \u00ad that Marco\nPolo is describing to him? Or has it been one and the same\ncity he has been describing all along? Is it simply Marco\nPolo's own city, Venice, that the emperor has begun to know\nthrough Marco Polo's many tales?\nHereby Khan poses a question that has been foundational\nto the discipline of method in social science: How can we be\nsure that the descriptions and information we receive from\nresearch in the world `out there' actually correspond to the\nworld they are claimed to describe? How can we be certain\nthat it is not simply the researcher's own world \u00ad habits,\ntaste, inclinations \u00ad that we are learning about, rather than\nthe world out there? The discipline of method has been given\nthe role of establishing this guarantee of correspondence\nbetween the world and what is stated, claimed and described\nabout it. The more rigorous the method that guides the work\nprocess, the stronger the link between reality and statement\nand the more solid the ground on which we stand when we\nclaim something. Method is here a matter of developing and\nmastering procedures and techniques that can provide some\nkind of guarantee of the link (or absence of a link) between a\nstatement and a reality. Is it like this or is it not?\nTrying to overcome this problem of correspondence, the\nemperor claims that from now on he will describe a city and\nthen Marco Polo can go out and see whether it exists as he\nhas conceived of it. But the cities that Marco Polo has trav-\nelled to are always different from those conceived by the\nemperor. Khan, impatiently, moves on by suggesting a model\nfrom which he can deduce all cities: `It contains everything\ncorresponding to the norm. Since the cities that exist diverge\nin varying degrees from the norm, I need only foresee the\nexceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable com-\nbinations'. Marco Polo, however, takes this reasoning to its\nultimate consequence by reversing its logic. He thereby\nshows how such models may serve us so well in terms of\ndescribing the general and the probable that we at last\n`achieve cities too probable to be real'. In this way, he shows\nhow a correspondence reasoning \u00ad regardless of whether it\nstarts from the general model and moves towards the particu-\nlar or vice versa \u00ad may produce averaged-out themes and\ndescriptions, too probable to be real. In searching for regu-\nlarities and patterns while eliminating outliers, unexplaina-\nble phenomena and the half glimpsed, the `realness' is lost,\nsince the real lies in the multiple, elusive and constantly\nunfolding nature of the researched: Describing the city is\ndescribing a multiplicity of invisible cities.\nIntroduction: process thinking and\nmethod\nCurrently, there is a growing field in organization studies that\nseeks to encompass this premise of the world as multiple and\nTsoukas, 2017). All things that we might study have multiple\nbecomings; there is always a multiplicity of incipiencies\npressing against the actuality of the studied phenomena\n(Massumi, 2002). These are not less real; they are real in\ntheir virtuality (Bergson, 2010). In other words, they are not\nactualized presently. However, if everything has multiple\nbecomings, then the discipline of method, if it is understood\nas creating correspondence between `what is' and `what is\nclaimed', becomes problematic. If movement and process\nare the basic forms of the universe, then the vagueness and\nmultiplicity that come with movement are not to be ruled out\nby research design; rather, relating to vagueness and multi-\nplicity is the very precondition of approaching the studied\nphenomena. This leaves us with the question of what method\nis \u00ad if it is at all. Throughout the past two decades, the death\nof method has been announced in different ways, for exam-\nple, by suggesting that method is emptied and must be\nreplaced by analytical strategy (Andersen, 2003) or that we\nhave reached a time of `after method' (Law, 2004).\nHowever, the scholar conducting empirical studies on the\nbasis of process thinking must still relate to `the how' of\nresearch. And here, questions of a methodological nature\ntend to leak in again, surprisingly unaffected by the claimed\n`death' of method. When process researchers go into the\nfield, they must still decide whether to do observations, inter-\nviews, document studies and so on; how to do them, who to\ninclude, what to do with the material afterwards; how much\nmaterial they need, how to treat the material, how to write\nabout it; and what the basis is for pointing out or claiming\nanything from the material that is gathered. Such questions\nhave traditionally been treated in the context of terms such as\n`documentation', `validity' and `variation'. This article sug-\ngests that we need to revisit and discuss such fundamental\nmethodological categories framed by the correspondence\nthinking in order to advance the `how' of process research in\norganization studies. The article is an attempt to contribute to\nsuch moving further.\nThus, the interest of the article is, `Can we think of method\nin organization studies without asking the world to reveal\nitself to us as distinctions, categories and causal regularities\nthat we can map and master?' `Can we know without this\ndemand for overview, explicitness and explanatory closure?'\nThe role of method here would not be about overcoming the\ngap between what is captured and what is there but would\nrather be about relating to this tension, playing with the gap\nitself. However, this still leaves the researcher with the ques-\ntion, `If studying something is about relating to its multiplic-\nity \u00ad if process research means relating to the virtuality of the\nstudied phenomena \u00ad then what does this actually mean in\nterms of gathering, processing and writing about empirical\nmaterial?' In this article, I aim to address this `how' of pro-\ncess research on the basis of an example of a specific piece\nof empirical material and on this background discuss and\nreframe classic method categories.\nPallesen 3\nThe structure of the article is as follows: I start by briefly\nintroducing process thinking in organization studies and then\ndiscuss current contributions to thinking about method that\ngo beyond correspondence thinking. Next, I inquire into `the\nhow' of process thinking using a specific piece of empirical\nmaterial as an example. On the basis of this, I revisit and\nrethink traditional methodological categories, particularly\nthe concepts of documentation, validity and variation.\nProcess thinking in organization studies\nTo provide some clarity about what I refer to as process\nresearch here, it might be useful to draw a basic distinction\nbetween two different meanings of `process research'.\nAccording to one, the term process refers to the study object;\naccording to the other, process reflects a basic understanding\nof the world. In the former sense, process research means\nstudying process as something contrasted to a stable situa-\ntion before and after the process (e.g. the implementation of\nnew legislation or the translation of strategy into new prac-\ntice). In the latter sense of process research, which I take up\nin this article, the term process reflects a basic understanding\nof the world, on which we must understand all kinds of activ-\nities we might study. Hence, `the processual' in the latter\napproach does not lie in studying process as something that\nhas to be explained; instead, process refers to an understand-\ning of the world as continuously and relationally under\nconstruction.\nThus, process research in this sense is characterized by\ndrawing on process philosophy, that is, on thinkers who do\nnot take their point of departure in subjects and objects but in\nan ever unfolding middle of becoming. Heraklit, Bergson,\nWhitehead and Deleuze are often seen as process philoso-\nphers, but also thinkers associated with American pragma-\ntism, such as Mead, Peirce, Dewey and James, have been\nassociated with process philosophy. A relatively recent hand-\nbook on process philosophy and organization studies includes\nprocessual readings of 34 thinkers; among them are central\nphilosophical figures in the history of continental philoso-\nphy, such as Nietzsche, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Ricoeur\nand Foucault (Helin et al., 2014). This long list of names\nindicates that process research is not easily nailed down to a\nfew main points; however, it seems reasonable to say that\ngiving becoming ontological primacy over being lies at the\nheart of it.\nThus, understanding the nature of becoming and move-\nment is central to process philosophy. The French philoso-\nTo understand the order of reality that characterizes move-\nment, we must understand the difference between qualitative\nand quantitative multiplicity, he points out. To illustrate the\ndifference, musical scores are a quantitative multiplicity,\nmarked separately as notes on staves that succeed and\nexclude each other in space (on paper), whereas music is a\nqualitative multiplicity \u00ad the experienced passing of tones\nthat interpenetrate each other but cannot be sliced into pieces\nor represented, since what music is cannot be separated from\nthis indivisible sensation of movement. Scores exist in space,\nwhile music exists in time. It does not exist out there but in\nour experience as a felt duration. Thus, while space can be\nmeasured and divided into quantitative entities, movement is\na dynamic unity (Massumi, 2002), which is why we cannot\nchange one tone in a melody without changing its whole.\nLater in this article, I will return to the methodological con-\nsequences of this different order of reality of movement,\npointed out by Bergson.\nOn this ground of insisting on the link between process\nphilosophy and process research, there is a growing field of\nprocessual reframing of established organizational concepts:\nHjorth and Steyaert rethink the concept of entrepreneurship\nprocess philosophical concepts such as `affect' and `desire'\ninto the dominating entrepreneurship discourse. This also\nopens up for a rethinking of social entrepreneurship as pub-\nlic entrepreneurship, thus emphasizing the desire for the\ncept of strategy and emphasize strategy as emergent from\nlocal coping actions instead of an intentional outcome of a\ngrand plan and link this to a Heideggerian notion of `dwell-\ning'. These contributions, in line with the reframing of the\ncategory of organization as organizing (Weick, 1979), distin-\nguish themselves from previous processual rethinkings of\norganizational categories (e.g., Stacey, 2007) by insisting not\nonly on the primacy of relation and process but also on the\nlink to process philosophical concepts such as `affect',\n`desire'and `becoming'that question the subject\u00adobject divi-\nsion and the purposeful (causally ordered) being in the world\nas ontologically fundamental.\nMethodological approaches in social\nscience inspired by process thinking\nIn the attempt to move further the focus on the `how' of\nprocess research, I do not intend to claim that method in\nsocial science has been unaffected by process thinking. An\nincreasing number of contemporary scholars strive in dif-\nferent ways to deal methodologically with the world as\nmultiple and in constant becoming. We might even speak of\na wider methodological shift in social science (Coleman\nand Ringrose, 2013): a growing call for methods that are\nare performative (Beyes and Steyaert, 2012; Dirksmeier\nThese attempts to rethink method emphasize in different\nways that research is a matter of not only studying what is\n`already there' but also actively creating and adding to the\nstudied world. All of these contributions in some way call for\na move from understanding research as representation (i.e.\n4 Methodological Innovations\nreflecting/illustrating what is there) towards understanding\nresearch as creation. However, it is worth noting that creation\nis here understood differently than in the constructionist\nsense of `creating' as constructing the world through per-\nspectives of the world.\nIn contrast, scholars within this shift towards performa-\ntive methodology tend to understand research as something\nthat not only changes how we think about the world but also\nalters the world ontologically. Or more precisely, the whole\nidea of perspective (i.e. how we see the world) as some-\nthing that exists at another level than reality (i.e. what the\nworld is) is fundamentally questioned. Instead, method, as\nwell as theory, is located on the same flat plane as the stud-\nied practices. They are practices themselves and thus add to\nthe world. This problematization of the distinction perspec-\ntive/world is not new, however. Already in 1920, the phi-\nlosopher Alfred Whitehead critically considered what he\nlabelled `the bifurcation of nature': the split between the\nworld/things out there (separated from any subject) and the\nsubject, the perspectives in here (separated from the world)\nHence, method, as well as theory, does not exist on a purer\nor more ordered level than reality \u00ad it is always an interven-\ntion in the messy, continuously practised world. This rethink-\ning of methodology as performative, messy, creative and so\non shares with constructivism a basic scepticism of the `cor-\nrespondence idea' of method referred to above. They both\nreject the positivist ideal that method can provide us with\nsome degree of certainty that the world is what the statement/\ntheory says it is. However, it tends to have another conse-\nquence: Instead of limiting research to a question of episte-\nmology, it implies a return to ontology \u00ad not ontology in the\npositivist sense as a question of what the world is, but rather\nan ontology of becoming. Reality is not inaccessible (we\ncannot not access reality since we are always already in the\nmidst of it); rather, reality is constantly enacted and per-\nformed in situated practices, and therefore constantly enfold-\ning, expanding and multiplying. It is not just our perspectives\nof the world that are multiple but the world itself. Therefore,\nmethod must necessarily deal with the impossible closure of\nknowledge. In other words, method now becomes a matter of\nhow to keep knowledge open and multiple when we do\nThe methodological task therefore becomes to `imagine\nmethods when they no longer seek the definite, the repeata-\nble, the more or less stable' (Law, 2004: 6) \u00ad in other words,\nmethods that are `tentative, hesitant, intuitive, slow and\nuncertain' (Law, 2004: 6). Law even compares it to a blind\nperson with a stick: His blindness handicaps him, but he also\nhas the force of the more intense feeling of the stick as he\nmethod implies another idea of clarity and rigour: The meth-\nodological task is `to find ways of knowing the indistinct and\nslippery without trying to grasp and hold them tight' (Law,\ning (e.g. providing some kind of guarantee, being sufficiently\nsure about something), Law talks about knowing as some-\nthing that calls for `techniques of deliberate imprecision'\n(Law, 2004: 3). He even often leaves the language of tech-\nniques behind and talks of a sense of method. The words he\noffers the reader for this kind of methodological understand-\ning (i.e. `quieter', `more generous', `broader', `looser') tend\nto designate an attitude rather than a technique.\nInterestingly, this (performative) account of method often\ncancels the promises of conventional method (e.g. precision,\ntempo, order) and suggests the exact opposite (e.g. impreci-\nsion, slowness, mess). Law invites the reader to an interest-\ning tour beyond current methods, but not to a new method.\nThis might be his whole point (with the title `after method'in\nmind): When the idea that knowledge should reflect a stable\nreality is left behind, the concept of method is emptied.\nHowever, it is worth noting that the discipline of method has\nbeen claimed to be dead before \u00ad without dying. For exam-\nple, it has been argued that method should be replaced by\nanalytical strategy on the basis of the constructivist reason-\ning mentioned above (Andersen, 2003): Since we cannot\naccess reality directly, all we can do is to be precise about our\nepistemological ground. In other words, we must account for\nthe perspectives through which we create reality. However,\nas academic debates have since shown, scholars within this\nparadigm continued to struggle with methodological ques-\ntions that could not be limited to a matter of analytical strat-\nSince the suggestion of methodological `imprecision' or\n`looseness' does not mean that anything goes, scholars doing\nempirical research in a process philosophical perspective\nmust still consider the `how' \u00ad and, in that sense, still need\nsome concept of method, albeit a somewhat different one\nthan the ones offered by correspondence thinking. Therefore,\nthe challenge for the scholar doing empirical work inspired\nby these processual approaches is, `If studying something\nprocessually is about relating to its multiple becomings \u00ad and\nhence the vagueness and slipperiness of the studied phenom-\nena \u00ad then what does this actually mean in terms of gather-\ning, processing and writing about empirical material?' In the\nnext section, I will discuss this on the background of a spe-\ncific piece of empirical material.\nStudying entrance \u00ad an example\nThe piece that I will now take up stems from observations\nmade during 3 days that I spent at the entrance of an activity\ncentre for citizens who are in contact with the social psychi-\natric system. In Danish, this activity centre is called\n`v\u00e6rested', which can be directly translated to `being place'.\n`Being'refers to the fact that the users of the centre do not get\nmedical or any other treatment at the centre. It is a place\nwhere users can come and get something to eat, take part in\nactivities or just hang out. The centre is organized by the\nPallesen 5\nlocal municipality and run by a social psychiatric team, who\nalso visit users in their homes. I have been allowed into the\ncentre to study the encounter between users and the centre as\npart of a research project focusing on the dynamics of wel-\nfare creation in the encounter between professionals and citi-\nzens \u00ad and how welfare management can be (re-)understood\nin this context. The observations are therefore part of a wider\nmaterial, including interviews with five other leaders, pre-\nceded by observations or other preparatory material and suc-\nceeded by four collaborative sessions with employees and\nleaders in three other institutions. From previous interviews\nin this centre, we know that the team manager currently\nplaces high priority on maintaining focus on the user in the\norganization of the team's work (e.g. by adapting the open-\ning hours to the rhythm of the users' lives) and with enhanc-\ning the team's attention to the users' resources, which is also\ninscribed in a wider political agenda of seeing `the citizen as\nresourceful'.\nAlready in explaining the research focus, as I just did in\nthese lines, a number of categories are implied: the user, the\nmanager, the entrance, the centre, and so on. However, in the\ninterests of process research, we are concerned with how\nthey come into being in an organizational context (Hjorth\net al., 2015): their multiple becomings, the vagueness of\nincipiencies by which their `realness' lives. So, rather than\nstarting with entities, categories or places, assuming that\nthey are already there and then trying to find regularities in\nhow they relate to each other, the challenge of the empirical\nwork is to find ways to connect to the multiplicity and vague-\nness of these categories. In the process described here, this\nwas attempted in various ways, some of which were planned\nand others which grew more spontaneously out of the pro-\ncess. In the next section, I will try to stay with the category\n`entrance' \u00ad which is both the site of observation and an\nactivity in focus for it \u00ad through five vignettes (entrance and\nabsence, entrance and hesitation, entrance and becoming-\nother, entrance and space, entrance and habit) made from\nrewritten observation notes and inspired by Calvino's\nInvisible Cities. Subsequently, I will discuss the `how' of\nprocess research from this example and take up some meth-\nodological issues in relation to it.\nEntrance and absence\nThe first day the researcher arrives at the activity centre to do\nobservations, she is led upstairs and into an apartment that\nhas been converted into an office. The staff tell her that after\nthe announcement of her arrival, some of the users had\nexpressed concern about someone coming from outside.\nThey had started wondering: Could it be the municipality\nthat is behind this? Were they thinking of closing down the\nplace since they have sent someone from outside to observe?\nShe states that she will interfere as little as possible in order\nto reduce unnecessary anxiety as much as she can. The staff\nand the researcher go down to the activity centre in the\nbasement of the building. Ten or fifteen minutes pass without\nanyone entering the room except for three staff members.\nOne of them, a young woman, says, `It's strange. Normally\nthey would have been here'. Her colleague nods at the\nresearcher: `Maybe it's because of the announcement of you\nbeing here, they might have been frightened'. The researcher\nfeels bad about having interfered and having caused anxiety\nfor these (in her mind) vulnerable, ill people before she has\neven entered their centre. Ten more minutes pass before the\nfirst user enters: an elderly man. By this point, the researcher\nhas withdrawn to the office area of the room, where she can\nbe on the sidelines, but his eyes immediately seek into her\ncorner behind the staff members. However, since she is `not\nthere', she does not know how to greet him. A staff member,\nthe young woman, notices their searching glance and takes a\nstep back as an invitation for them to connect. The researcher\nsteps out of the office area and the man approaches her. He\nstarts asking questions in an open interested way. He knows\na bald professor: Does she perhaps know him? She laughs a\nbit and says that there is a majority of bald professors, she\nguesses. But the staff member persists, asking `Which insti-\ntute was it?'As they slowly walk along the oblong entrance,\nthe user and researcher talk about the institute and the profes-\nsor that it actually turns out that she knows.\nEntrance and hesitation\nMore users enter the room. A scraping of chairs blends with\nvoices to create a steady and soft background noise. The\nresearcher is already aware that she is not observing in the\nway she had planned. Rather than observations from the\nsidelines, she is observing from within activities and conver-\nsations. As a consequence, a lot of things happen around her\nthat she does not grasp. However, becoming part of the\nsteady, slow rhythm of the centre, she starts to notice small\nchanges in it. Later, numerous users have found their way to\nthe centre. Two users are entering the room. They keep stand-\ning at the step down to the room. One member of staff, a\nmiddle-aged woman, gets up and starts walking towards\nthem, but then something apparently makes her hesitate\napproximately 5 m in front of them. The staff member greets\nthem and sends a `Happy New Year'through the room across\nthe distance between them. Then she waits for a long\nmoment. The users do not take the expected step down into\nthe room; they just keep standing there, a bit stiff. The staff\nmember raises her hand, and one of the users lifts his hand\nslightly. Then the staff member takes a step back and returns\nto the kitchen.After a while, the two users enter the room and\nblend into the crowd.\nEntrance and becoming-other\nThe staff meeting is about to begin in the usual meeting room\non the third floor, equipped with an oval table and a white-\nboard covered with words and arrows in red, left over from\n6 Methodological Innovations\nthe previous meeting. The researcher is given the floor by the\nmanager. She has promised to present the observations from\nthe entrance of the centre and therefore start by describing\nsituations she has noticed, among these the two users hesitat-\ning at the doorstep. She also describes, to the participants'\namusement, how the strategy of observing from the sidelines\ntotally broke down as she was approached by the talkative\nusers and she thereby became another observer than the one\nwho had arrived in the morning, a guest. She asks what these\nobservations might evoke about their encounters with the\nusers. One member of staff immediately says that it makes\nhim think of entering the living room of an elderly woman he\nonce made home visits to. From the moment he entered her\nhome, he could sense her condition, but he also knew that the\nhome changed when he entered. It was a home, but when he\ncrossed the doorstep, it became something more than a home.\nThe point that what it becomes depends on a number of cir-\ncumstances is emphasized in the dialogue that follows: `for\nexample, how we physically approach the citizen', one mem-\nber of staff adds. Another situation is evoked by this discus-\nsion: A participant who works at the activity centre tells\nabout a time he went to the sports hall with a group of users\nof the activity centre. He recalls how he was struck by how\nmuch entering the sports hall changed the contact among the\nusers and even his own way of approaching them. `At the\nactivity centre they sometimes can seem apathetic, and I\nhave to use all my energy to get them to be active. But here\nanother kind of energy was going through them', he adds. A\ndiscussion emerges: The role of the social psychiatric team is\nnot to make users not-ill or less-ill, but rather `more-than ill'.\nHence, the point of the activity centre is to create a context in\nwhich users can become more than their mental illness, all\nthe other things that they are apart from being ill, for exam-\nple, a chess player, someone who cooks or a basketball\nplayer.\nEntrance and space\nThe participants, previously sitting around the meeting table,\nnow go silently down the stairs that lead to the activity centre\nin the basement. There is some awkwardness in this silence,\nyet it seems to create a pause in which they sense the passage\nfrom the meeting room into the activity centre. As they enter\nthe linoleum tiled room, one member of staff immediately\nsays, `Already here I notice that there's a certain smell in\nhere that I would always recognize'. They all pause and sniff\nat the entrance, and others reply, `Yeah, you are in a com-\npletely different place now'. `A public institution', one says.\n`Well, I smell dinner', another one adds. A third exclaims, `I\njust got the thought that this is a difficult room to enter \u00ad it's\nlike a long, narrow tunnel seen from here'.\nThey are now standing at the doorstep where the two\nusers were standing, hesitating for a long time. The researcher\nreturns to how she was struck by the situation, when one of\nthe staff members approached the users, but stopped at a\ndistance of 5 m and waited for a long moment. Now, she goes\ndown the room and stops 5 m in front of the staff member,\nwho is still standing at the doorstep where the users hesi-\ntated. `What made you stop here?' the researcher wonders\nout loud. The staff member is not sure. `But it varies a lot',\nanother one adds, `Some users look for immediate contact'.\nThe group now tries, two by two, to approach each other and\nthen try to notice whether we feel we are being approached\ntoo close, too fast or too hesitantly.\nEntrance and habit\nTwo months later, this `slowing down'at the entrance is rein-\nserted in another context: a working seminar with a munici-\npal office north of Copenhagen that was part of the same\nresearch project. However, while the first `slowing down'\nemerged spontaneously from the pause created by the (artifi-\ncial) silence in which they entered the centre and thereby\nintensified the event, this time the researcher tries purpose-\nfully to recreate this slowing down. At the entrance of their\nusual meeting room, she reads a piece from Calvino's\nInvisible Cities, with which I started this article \u00ad to make\nparticipants stop, wonder and slowdown in the habit of enter-\ning a meeting with their colleagues \u00ad in other words, to make\na pause in the continuity of expectations.\nThen, how is the entrance of Penthesilea different than\nwhat we habitually assume? The traveller continues his tale\nin this way:\nYou advance for hours and it is not clear to you whether you are\nalready in the city's midst or still outside it. [...] If you ask the\npeople you meet, `Where is Penthesilea?' they make a broad\ngesture which may mean `Here' or else `Farther on', or `All\naround you' or even `In the opposite direction'. `I mean the\ncity', you ask insistently. `We come here every morning to\nwork'. Someone answers, while others say, `We come back here\nat night to sleep'. `But the city where people live?' you ask. `It\nmust be that way', they say, and some raise their arms obliquely\ntoward an aggregation of opaque polyhedrons on the horizon,\nwhile others indicate, behind you, the specter of other spires.\n`Then I've gone past it without realizing it?' `No, try going on\nstraight ahead'.\nDiscussing `the how' of process\nresearch from the example\nLike the entrance of Penthesilea, the entrance of the centre is\nnot just a place that is already there; it only becomes an\nentrance from someone having entered \u00ad it emerges from the\nprocess of entering. And vice versa: The entrance actualizes\nthe one who enters the centre in a particular way. Certain\nmemories and experiences come to the surface (e.g. `dinner'\nor `public institution') and actualize the user, the employee\nand also the researcher in certain ways (e.g. as `hesitant',\n`walking in a tunnel' or `a guest' that does not just observe\nPallesen 7\nfrom the sidelines). Thus, `entrance' is constantly emerging\nfrom relationally, materially, affective forces that entwine\nwith each other and affect us as a dynamic unity: the archi-\ntecture of the building, the smell of the room and the sounds\nin it resonate with the experience of those entering. Thus, the\nentrance of the centre continuously comes into being in mul-\ntiple ways. Hence, studying entrance as dynamic unity\nimplies opening up the qualitative multiplicity of the catego-\nries of those entering: how the citizen may `become other'\nwhen he enters the centre (e.g. a `user' in the social psychiat-\nric system or a chess player), just like the researcher became\nsomeone else than the person who arrived in the morning.\nThus, studying entrance, not simply as extensive passage\n(a space that the user traverses) but as intensive passage (a\nprocess of becoming-other), opens up the question, `How\ndoes the space of becoming \"more-than ill\" emerge through\ndaily encounters?' Hereby, the theme of the resourceful user,\nintroduced by the manager in the introductory interview,\nstarts to deviate: Throughout the collaborative process, the\nquestion is reframed from `How to implement an optic of the\nuser as being resourceful?' to `How the space for becoming-\nother (more than ill) is actualized/enacted in daily life of the\ncentre?' In that sense, the return to the observation site\ntogether with employees forefronts the genuinely processual\nin the team's task \u00ad in terms of creating a space for the user's\nmultiple becomings: mentally ill, chess player, quiz winner,\nbasketball player, someone cooking Indian food and so on.\nHence, through this process, the observations at the\nentrance become observations about how the `being place' is\nentered as a `becoming place' \u00ad in other words, What are the\nmaterial, affective, bodily details of the event of entering the\ncentre that hold open this space of intensive movement/\nbecoming-other? Method here becomes a matter of finding\nways to be attentive to these entwined materially, bodily and\naffective forces by which entrance into the centre actualizes\nusers and employees (and the researcher) in certain ways and\n\u00ad to relate to the multiplicity of it \u00ad the crowd of pressing\nincipiencies that Massumi (2002) speaks of.\nIn the process described here, this was attempted in vari-\nous ways. One is by intervening actively by adding a drop\nof `otherness', that is, introducing something artificial, cre-\nating a pause (`the awkward silence' or `the piece from\nCalvino') that intensifies the event of entering and how it is\nsensed. Another way, also conditioned by this `otherness',\nis slowing down, partly by literally, physically slowing\ndown at the entrance when we return to the observation of\nthe users hesitating at the entrance. The sequence at the\nentrance can be seen as a technic of `slowmotioning'(Beyes\nand Steyaert, 2012), which allows us to zoom in on the mul-\ntiple micro-life of the encounters that had just been in focus\nin the meeting room. In other words, the physical slowing\ndown becomes a way to extend a piece of everyday life and\npay attention to what is more in it by slowing down our\nperception of small everyday details, for example, how the\nentrance emerges from the scent, sound and architecture of\nthe centre. A third way was repetition, that is, staying by the\nevent of entering and relating to it in different ways. The\nobservation of `the users hesitating at the doorstep' is here\nmultiplied by returning to this observation repeatedly in\nways that differ in form: First, the observation is made and\nnoted by the researcher; next, it is narrated at the meeting\nwith the team (where it opens up other narratives about\nencounters with the users); then it is `relived' by actually\ngoing back to the entrance, where it happened, where it\nopens up an attention to the material, spatial aspects of\nentering the centre. At last, it is reinserted into another con-\ntext. Thus, there is a series of `slowing downs', starting\nfrom the two users slowing down at the entrance that opens\nup to intensity and multiplicity.\n`The how' of this small piece of process research could\ntherefore also be described as a process of slowing down,\nintensifying and multiplying: First, there is a slowing down\nat the entrance conditioned by a drop of otherness, which\nintensifies and brings to the forefront sensations and feeling-\nup in reflecting sessions and thereby opens up for multiply-\ning, that is, opening up to the qualitative multiplicity of the\ncategories involved. Thus, method here also becomes a ques-\ntion of how to move beyond habitual practices of how we\napproach the categories in focus. In line with Andrew\nMurphie (2008), process research is arguably precisely not\nabout analysing habits and making them the basis of a new\ntaxonomy of experience but to `remake relations, changing\nsomehow involves what Helin et al. call exposing ourselves\nto the strange `that which invites us to open up and move\nRethinking existing methodological\nconcepts: documenting, variation,\nvalidity\nIn the example discussed above, `documenting' takes on\nanother meaning than it has in the framework of correspond-\nence thinking, where documenting means capturing what is\nthere as precisely as possible. Massumi (2008) has reminded\nus that we always perceive double: We see an object (e.g. a\nchair), but we also see what we do not see (the back of the\nchair, its weight, our body's capacity to move around the\nchair or to stretch out the arm and feel the soft velour at the\nhand). That is, we sense our own aliveness \u00ad the dynamic,\non-going, processual aspect of our relation to the object. In\nprocess research, documenting is about finding ways of put-\nting that aliveness in front.\nThus, relating only to what we see is not something we\ncan do; we always see what we do not see, the city is multi-\nplied by the experience of those entering, and it is always a\nmultiplicity of invisible cities. Process research is a call to\ntake this seriously in the practice of documenting \u00ad to relate\nto what we `double see', to invoke the invisible and attend to\n8 Methodological Innovations\nthe `aliveness' of the researched phenomena. That requires\nmethods that leave room for relating to the multiple registers\nof sensation (Beyes and Steyaert, 2012; Dirksmeier and\nobservations in many ways excesses the visual sense (Pink,\n2009). Touching, hearing, smelling, tasting were also part of\nbeing in the activity centre \u00ad sensations that are indivisible\nand interpenetrating each other in experiencing a situation\nand forms the sensation of being present, of being a part of its\nliveliness. In Bergson's terms, they are a qualitative multi-\nplicity that forms a dynamic unity of becoming.\nTo grasp the `realness'of the researched, we need ways of\ndocumenting that does not immediately split apart that which\nforms a dynamic unity in our experience of it just to recon-\nnect it into generalizable descriptions and models that may\nbe \u00ad to use the words of Calvino's traveller \u00ad too probable to\nbe real. In the process discussed above, `documenting' what\nhappens rather means to put the liveliness of entrance in the\nforeground \u00ad to forefront its changeability, its openness. It is\nnot so much about documenting the entrance that is already\nthere, but to connect to its multiple becomings, to invoke the\ninvisible entrance.\nHowever, this has implications for how we can under-\nstand the classic methodological categories of validity and\nvariation. In classic methodological thinking, `validity' basi-\ncally means applying a transparent method that measures\nwhat it claims to measure, which allows another researcher\nto repeat the study with the same result. In qualitative\napproaches, however, this concept of validity has been modi-\nfied. For example, in Grounded Theory (Glaser and Strauss,\nstudy has inducted the core categories systematically from\nthe empirical material and that these categories are saturated.\nIn other words, data collection must continue until there is no\nmore variation in the categories. However, in process think-\ning, where the singularity of the experience is emphasized\nand multiplicity is seen as fundamental, this reasoning\nbecomes problematic. Instead of searching for the point\nwhere variation ends, validity would instead be a question of\nactively pushing that point further.\nAs in the example above, that kind of `pushing' can take\ndifferent forms during the research process. It may be a ques-\ntion of intervening by adding a `drop of otherness' to the\nresearched practices; it may be a matter of making series of\nprocessings of the same piece of empirical material that takes\nit through treatments that differ in terms of form, or it may be\na question of writing up empirical material in ways in which\nthe openness and ambiguity of the material are affirmed.\nHence, in methodological thinking from the perspective of\nprocess philosophy, `repetition' becomes a way to stay with\nthe research object and multiply it, rather than a way of test-\ning whether the outcome stays the same.\nHowever, this implies a fundamentally different way of\nthinking about variation. In classic methodological thinking,\nvariation is a problem that is solved as a matter of statistical\nsignificance (in quantitative methodology) or saturation of\ncategories (in qualitative methodology). However, in\nBergson's (2010) terms, one might say that both of these\nways of reasoning are extensive ways of thinking about vari-\nation, that is, variation between states and categories that are\nseparable and exclude each other in space. However, think-\ning of multiplicity as qualitative (i.e. indivisible, multiple\nstates interpenetrating each other) paves the way for another\nway of thinking of variation: a fundamentally qualitative\nway, namely, thinking of variation from within, as intensive.\nOne way to do this in empirical work is by welcoming the\nnotion that the same piece of empirical material comes into\nbeing in multiple ways depending on the context it resonates\nwith and the experience of those involved. In the analysis\nabove, this is done by selecting a small piece of material that\nis returned to repeatedly, but in different ways: for example,\nas a narrative evoking other narratives, as a physical move-\nment, as the sounds, scents and architecture of the place\nwhere it happened. Seen in this way, variation is not merely\nvariation between cases, practices or statements but also a\nmatter of revealing the variation immanent to the material \u00ad\nthat is, of the places, situations and problems that we study\n\u00ad by repeatedly `documenting' it in different ways and\ncontexts.\nConclusion\nProcess thinking does not merely mean that movement and\nvagueness are a complicating premise, something we have to\nhandle and take into account as a methodological challenge\nin research. In this article, I have aimed at taking the more\nradical point of departure that movement is the precondition\nof studying anything at all: All things, to be noticed, must be\nmoving. That means that method becomes genuinely the task\nof describing, understanding and expanding the ways in\nwhich we connect with the world, how we connect with its\nvagueness, movement and multiplicity, rather than a disci-\npline of techniques to disconnect from the world. I have sug-\ngested here that moving further this `how'of process research\nin organization studies and social science implies rethinking\ncentral methodological categories like `documenting',\n`validity' and `variation'. Hence, moving further in the field\nof process research implies processualizing not only organi-\nzational categories but also how we relate to knowledge.\nThis implies a methodological thinking that has room for\na more connotative, playful, way of relating to the material,\nthat does not demand from a methodology to overcome the\ngap between what is there and what is captured, but makes\nuse of this gap as a space for invitation, rather than for impos-\ning, listing and classifying. This involves moving beyond\nhabitual practices of relating to knowledge; method is in that\nsense inherently an `upstream practice' and involves what\nHelin et al. call exposing ourselves to the strange `that which\ninvites us to open up and move along lines of flight' (Helin\nPallesen 9\nThat upstreamness may, however, be threatened by its\nown success. Put more precisely, there is always a risk of\nending up chasing more or less settled (agreed upon) markers\nof `otherness', which over time may become an `over-coded'\nform of strangeness, which ceases to be strange and therefore\nchanges no habits. In any case, it is not necessarily the very\n`loud-mouthed' strangeness that enacts otherness. The sim-\nple activity of slowly entering a room in silence (a room you\nhave entered innumerable times at work, but not in silent\ntogetherness with colleagues that you are not used to being\nsilent together with) and suddenly becoming attentive to the\nsmell of the room can be a productive (but silent) stranger to\nhabit.\nIn this light, it is worth stressing that the how of process\nresearch is a multiplicity of `hows'; the way of doing process\nresearch discussed in this article is one way, as it emerged in\na corner of a research material generated in a specific con-\ntext. However, this does not mean that there is no room for a\ncommon discussion about methodological concepts in a pro-\ncess perspective. We may see method as `dead' or `empty',\nbut researchers will still encounter questions of a certain\n(`methodological') nature when they go into the field and\nafterwards when they present their findings in academic\npapers or presentations. These are questions often silently\nframed by methodological categories that have traditionally\nbeen defined by correspondence thinking. In order to move\non and keep searching for the `hows' of process research in\norganization studies, rethinking concepts such as validity\nand variation through a processual lens might not only be\nhelpful for the researcher doing empirical studies in the field\nof process research \u00ad but also may help create some space for\nplay in the field of methodology.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThis article draws partly on thoughts elaborated in the author's phd,\nwhich was co-funded by Copenhagen Business School and\nMetropolitan University College.\nReferences\nAndersen N\u00c5 (2003) Discursive Analytical Strategies:\nUnderstanding Foucault, Koselleck, Laclau, Luhmann.\nBristol: The Policy Press.\nAndersen SC (2005) Smid ikke barnet ud med badevandet.\nEpistemologisk konstruktivisme og dens metodiske kon-\nsekvenser [Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.\nEpistemological constructivism and its methodological conse-\nquences] Dansk Sociologi 3: 16.\nBergson H (1910) Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate\nData of Consciousness (translated from Essai Sur Les Donnees\nImmediates de la Conscience by FL Pogson).
