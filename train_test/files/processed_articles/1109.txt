Field,* Parul Aneja, and Bernard Rosner\n Key words: weight change, gender, adolescents\nIntroduction\nAlthough self-reported BMI, weight change, and BMI\nchange have been used to predict the development of nu-\nmerous chronic diseases, such as type II diabetes (1,5\u00ad8),\nhypertension (8,13), there has been some concern that self-\nreports are biased estimates and that, as a result, self-\nreported weight and BMI underestimate their true values.\nThe validity of self-reported weight and height have been\ninvestigated in both adult populations (14\u00ad17) and adoles-\ncent and young adult populations (18,19). Many of these\nstudies have observed a high correlation between measured\nand self-reported weight (17\u00ad19). Thus, there is ample\nevidence that self-reported weight and height information is\nnot perfect, but it is more than adequate for conducting\nepidemiological research using weight or BMI as a predic-\ntor of health outcomes. There is conflicting evidence about\nthe accuracy of classifying participants in terms of weight\nstatus based on self-reported weight and height. In the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III\nstudy, the use of self-reported weight and height resulted in\nadolescents (18). In addition, in the Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health (Add Health),1 Goodman et al. observed\nthat 9.7% of youth were obese based on measured weight\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

Overall, only 3.8% of the youth\nwere misclassified as obese using self-reported BMI (19).\nHowever, others have observed that the prevalence of over-\nweight and obesity are underestimated when self-reports are\nused instead of measured weight and height (20,21). Thus,\noverall, it appears that weight status based on self-report\nsomewhat underestimates the true prevalence. Therefore, it\nis more appropriate to use self-reported height and weight as\na predictor of an outcome rather than as an estimate of\npopulation prevalence.\nAlthough there have been a variety of studies assessing\nthe validity of self-reported weight, height, and weight\nstatus, we are unaware of studies assessing the validity of\nweight change based on self-report vs. measured informa-\ntion. Weight change is a predictor in many analyses of\nchronic disease endpoints and is increasingly a common\noutcome in studies assessing possible protective factors to\nprevent obesity. Therefore, understanding the validity of\nweight change is of paramount importance. To ascertain the\nvalidity of self-reported weight change based on self-re-\nported information, we analyzed data from Add Health, a\nprospective study sampled to be representative of students\nin grades 7 through 12 in the United States at Wave I\n(1995). The present investigation was limited to participants\nwho were at least 16 years of age because most of the\nfemale participants and many of the male participants would\nhave achieved their peak height by that age. Investigating\nchanges in weight, weight status, or BMI change at earlier\nages would be complicated because the results would need\nto take into account height change and accuracy of self-\nreported height change, hence the decision to restrict the\nsample to Add Health participants who were at least 16\nyears of age, among whom we could focus exclusively on\nweight change.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nSample\nhigh schools and 52 middle schools in the U.S., which were\nselected with unequal probability of selection, completed an\nin-home questionnaire (Wave I). The Add Health study\ndesign incorporated systematic sampling methods and im-\nplicit stratification to ensure that the sample was represen-\ntative of U.S. schools with respect to region of country,\nurbanicity, school size, school type, and ethnicity. Approx-\n(including school drop-outs) completed another in-home\nquestionnaire and were measured and weighed (Wave II).\ninal Wave I participants completed an in-home interview\nand were measured and weighed (Wave III).\nMeasures\nAge, weight, and height were assessed on each of the\nthree waves of data collection. Race was assessed at base-\nline. If participants indicated that they were of Hispanic or\nLatino origin, they were coded as Hispanic regardless of\nwhether they indicated they were white, African-American,\nAsian, Native American, or other race. Among the remain-\ning participants, those who indicated that they were black or\nAfrican-American, regardless of whether they indicated any\nother race, were classified as African-American. Among the\nremaining participants, those who indicated that they were\nAsian, regardless of whether they also indicated that they\nwere Native American, other race, or white, were classified\nas Asian. The remaining participants were classified as\nbeing other race if they indicated that they were Native\nAmerican or other race. Participants were classified as white\nif they indicated that they were white and no other race.\nHousehold income and level of parental education were\nassessed at Wave I. Response to the question on level of\nparental education ranged from \"never attended school\" to\n\"professional training beyond a 4-year college or univer-\nsity.\"\nAt Wave I, weight and height were self-reported, whereas\nat Waves II and III, in addition to self-report, weights and\nheights were measured. Due to the lack of measured weights\nand heights at Wave I, only information from Waves II and\nIII were used in the analysis. We calculated BMI (weight in\nkilograms/height in meters squared) at Waves II and III\nusing self-reported weight and height information and mea-\nsured weight and height. In addition, we calculated weight,\nheight, and BMI change based on self-reported information\nat Waves II and III. The same three variables were calcu-\nlated based on measured weights and heights at Waves II\nand III. In addition, discrepancy scores (self-reported\nweight or weight change minus measured weight or weight\nchange) were calculated: discrepancy between self-reported\nand measured weight at Wave II, discrepancy between\nself-reported and measured weight at Wave III, discrepancy\nbetween self-reported and measured BMI at Wave II, dis-\ncrepancy between self-reported and measured BMI at Wave\nIII, and discrepancy between self-reported and measured\nweight change between Waves II and III. To assess whether\ndifference in accuracy of self-reported weight change varied\nby weight status, measured weight and height at Wave II\nwere used to create indicators for being overweight or obese\nbased on the International Obesity Task Force cut-off points\n(22), which are age- and gender-specific.\nUsing information on weight from Waves II and III,\nparticipants were classified as weight maintainers, weight\ngainers, or weight losers according to self-report and mea-\nsured information. Two different sets of weight change\nvariables were created. One set, created separately for self-\nreported and measured weight information, was based on\nchanges of at least 10 pounds. Participants who gained at\nSelf-Reported Weight Change, Field, Aneja, and Rosner\nleast 10 pounds between Waves II and III were classified as\ngainers, whereas those who lost 10 pounds were classified\nas weight losers. The participants who remained within 10\npounds were classified as weight maintainers. The other set\nof weight change variables were based on changes of at\nleast 5% of their weight at Wave II. Participants who gained\nat least 5% of their Wave II weight between Waves II and\nIII were classified as gainers, whereas those who lost 5%\nwere classified as weight losers. The participants who re-\nmained within 5% were classified as weight maintainers.\nAt Wave II, weight control efforts were assessed. Partic-\nipants were asked, \"Are you trying to lose weight, gain\nweight, stay the same weight, or not trying to do anything\nabout your weight?\" Using that question, participants were\nclassified as trying to gain, trying to lose, trying to maintain,\nor not trying to do anything.\nPhysical activity was assessed with three questions at\nWave II: \"During the past week, how many times did you\nplay an active sport, such as baseball, softball, basketball,\nsoccer, swimming, or football?\", \"During the past week,\nhow many times did you go roller-blading, roller-skating,\nskate-boarding, or bicycling?\", and \"During the past week,\nhow many times did you do exercise, such as jogging,\nwalking, karate, jumping rope, gymnastics, or dancing?\" A\nsummary score of the mean times per week that the partic-\nipant engaged in physical activity at Wave II was computed\nfrom these three questions.\nPhysical inactivity was assessed with three questions at\nWave II: \"How many hours per week do you watch televi-\nsion?\", \"How many hours per week do you watch videos?\",\nand \"How many hours per week do you play video or\ncomputer games?\" Because the categories are not mutually\nexclusive, in the analysis, we restricted inactivity to hours\nper week of television viewing. In secondary analyses, the\nsum of the three inactivity items was used to estimate total\nhours of inactivity.\nSample for Analysis\nParticipants who did not have information on race (n \n2), did not complete both Waves II and III of data collection\n(n  6234), were missing self-reported or measured infor-\nmation on weight or height at either wave (368 male and\n643 female participants), were outliers on weight (defined\nas weighing 30 or 600 pounds) or height (defined as\nparticipants) at either wave, had lost more than 1 inch in\nheight between Waves II and III according to both self-\nparticipants), had lost more than 1 inch on measured but not\nself-reported height (449 male and 602 female participants),\nhad lost more than 1 inch on self-reported but not measured\nheight (97 male and 145 female participants), or were out-\nliers in terms of BMI change (defined as being above the\nparticipants) and self report (14 male and 14 female partic-\nipants) were excluded from the analysis, thus leaving 3991\nand many male participants would have achieved close to\ntheir peak height by age 16, but those who grew more than\n1 inch between Waves II and III were excluded from the\nfemale participants remained for analysis. There were minor\ndifferences between the sample for analysis and the sample\nexcluded due to being outliers or missing data. For example,\nthere was a slightly lower percentage of female participants\nin the sample for analysis (53%) than in the outlier (55%)\nsample. The difference was smaller between the sample for\nanalysis and sample missing information at Wave II (52%\nfemale participants). Household income was only slightly\nhigher among the sample included in the analysis (mean \ndespite the analysis sample being at least 16 years of age.\nThe sample for analysis was 36.9% Hispanic or African-\nAmerican, which was similar to the prevalence of 37.5% in\nthe sample excluded. However, the sample retained in the\nanalysis contained a greater proportion of Hispanics and\nfewer African-Americans than the excluded sample.\nAnalysis\nAll analyses were stratified by gender and conducted with\nSAS 8.2 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Although\nit is strongly recommended that Add Health be analyzed\nwith software that takes the sample weights and clustering\ninto account, weights were not used in the analysis because\nthe focus was on internal comparisons rather than estimat-\ning population prevalence rates and measures of association\nthat could be extrapolated to a larger population. However,\nto assess whether the results were robust, the analysis was\nrerun using sample weights to account for the stratified\nsampling strategy and clustering. Linear regression models\nwere used to assess predictors of the discrepancy between\nself-reported and measured weight change (self-reported\nvalue minus measured value). Logistic regression models\nwere used to assess predictors of self-reported weights\ncorrectly classifying participants in terms of their weight\nchange (weight gainers, weight losers, and weight maintain-\ners). All p values are two-sided, with p  0.05 considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nAt Wave II, according to measured anthropometry, the\nmean weight among the boys was 164.0 pounds, and the\nmean weight among the girls was 136.1 pounds (Table 1).\nAmong the boys, the mean weight according to self-report\nSelf-Reported Weight Change, Field, Aneja, and Rosner\nwas an average of 0.5 pounds higher than the mean based on\nmeasured weight, whereas among the girls, the mean based\non self-report was 1.6 pounds lower than measured\nweight. During the approximately 5-year period between\nWaves II and III, 64% of the participants gained 10\npounds. Among the male participants, there was a mean\ngain of 21.9 pounds, and among the female participants,\nthere was a mean gain of 17.5 pounds. Less than 10% of\nparticipants lost weight, and less than one-third maintained\ntheir weight.\nAt Wave III, both the male and female participants\nslightly under-reported their weight. Male participants un-\nder-reported their weight by an average of 2.3 pounds, and\nfemale participants under-reported by 3.6 pounds. Due to\nthis slight under-reporting, weight change based on self-\nreported weights at Waves II and III slightly underestimated\nweight change based on measured weights, by 2.1 to 2.8\npounds among the female and male participants, respec-\ntively (Table 1). There was a small gender difference in\nunder-reporting of weight change based on self-report vs.\nmeasured weight (mean difference by the genders  0.6\npounds, p  0.06), and the correlation between weight\nchange based on self-report vs. measured weights was the\nsame among male and female participants (r  0.8).\nAlthough obese female participants under-reported their\nweight more than their healthy-weight female peers, they\nconsistently under-reported their weight. Therefore, despite\nunder-reporting their weight by an average of 10 to 11\npounds at Waves II and III, weight change based on self-\nreport was 0.3 pounds less than weight change based on\nmeasured weights among the obese female participants (Ta-\nble 2). Similarly, overweight female participants under-\nreported their weight by 3.6 pounds at Wave II and 5.8\npounds at Wave III, so weight change based on self-report\nwas underestimated by 2.2 pounds, which was similar to the\nunderestimation among underweight and healthy-weight fe-\nmale participants (2.3 pounds). Weight change was under-\nestimated significantly less among the obese participants\ncompared with their healthy-weight peers (p  0.001), but\nthe difference in underestimation between the obese and\noverweight women was not significant. The pattern was\nsimilar among the male participants among whom weight\nchange was underestimated by 3.1 pounds among the\nhealthy-weight male participants and by 1.7 to 2.2 pounds\namong the overweight and obese men (Table 2). The dis-\ncrepancy between weight change based on self-reported vs.\nmeasured weights was not associated with known predictors\nof weight change: being African-American (male partici-\nfemale participants,   0.2, p  0.7), weight change\nefforts (male participants,  for trying to lose weight \np  0.3; female participants,  for trying to lose weight \np  0.4), activity level (male participants,   0.2 per\nhour, p  0.2; female participants,   0.1 per hour, p \n0.6), and time spent watching television (male participants,\nper hour, p  0.07). Among the female participants, but not\nthe male participants, age at Wave II was inversely related\nto the discrepancy between weight change based on self-\nreport and weight change based on measured weights (i.e.,\nthe discrepancy was greatest for older participants). House-\nhold income level was unrelated to the discrepancy between\nself-reported and measured weights. However, level of pa-\nrental education was positively associated with the discrep-\nancy between self-reported and measured weights among\nthe male participants (p  0.01) and inversely related\namong the female participants (p  0.05).\nTrue weight change was related to the discrepancy be-\ntween self-report and measured weight change. Compared\nwith those who maintained their weight within 5% of their\nweight at Wave II, weight change was significantly over-\nestimated among those whose Wave III weight was at least\n5% higher than their Wave II weight. In contrast, weight\nchange was significantly underestimated among those\nwhose weights decreased by at least 5% (data not shown).\nTable 1.

Overall, 87% of the\nweight gainers and 65% of weight maintainers were cor-\nrectly classified by self-report. Twenty-three percent of the\nweight maintainers were misclassified as weight gainers\nwhen the classification was made based on self-reported\nweights. When weight change status was based on remain-\ning within 10 pounds of baseline weight, 81% of the weight\ngainers and 79% of the weight maintainers were correctly\nclassified. The weighted  statistic was similar when 5%\nchange [weighted   0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI),\nRegardless of the definition of weight change (5% vs.\n10-pound change), female participants were more accu-\nrately classified as weight maintainers.\nAccuracy of weight gain or maintenance based on self-\nreported serial weights was not associated with age, activity,\ninactivity, trying to lose weight, trying to gain weight, or\ntrying to maintain weight (Table 4). There was a suggestion\nthat African-American male participants were more accu-\nrately classified as weight gainers than were white male\nparticipants, whereas among the female participants, Asians\nwere more accurately classified than whites. In addition,\nobese male participants were 2 times more likely than their\nnormal-weight peers to be accurately classified by self-\nreported weights as weight gainers [odds ratio (OR)  2.2;\nto 3.5). Among the female participants, overweight partic-\nipants were approximately two times more likely (OR \naccurately classified by self-reported weights as weight\nmaintainers.\nDiscussion\nAmong 4760 adolescents and young adults, we observed\nthat weight change based on serial self-reports of body\nweight was a valid estimate of weight change based on\nserial measured weights. Overall, weight change based on\nself-report underestimated measured weight change by ap-\nproximately 2 pounds among both men and women. The\nunderestimation was lowest among those who were obese or\nmaintained their weight within 5% of their weight at base-\nline. The discrepancy between weight change based on\nself-reported vs. measured weights was not related to race/\nethnicity, activity level, or time spent watching television,\nthree known risk factors for weight gain. Moreover, there\nwas no evidence that weight control behaviors were asso-\nciated with biased estimates of weight change. Taken to-\ngether, these results suggest that the error in weight change\nbased on self-report is random and, therefore, will bias the\nTable 3.

We found that at both Waves II and III, obese\nparticipants under-reported their weight more than over-\nweight participants, and overweight participants under-re-\nported their weight more than underweight or healthy-\nweight participants. However, participants were fairly\nconsistent in their under-reporting; as a result, weight\nchange based on self-report was within 2 to 3 pounds of\nweight change based on measured weights. The difference\nwas smallest among obese female participants, the group\nwho under-reported their weight the most, but in a very\nconsistent manner.\nClassification of participants based on self-reported\nweights into weight losers, gainers, and maintainers did\nresult in a slight underestimation of weight gainers and a\nslight overestimation of weight maintainers. However, ac-\ncuracy of classification was not associated with African-\nAmerican or Hispanic ethnicity, physical activity level, time\nspent watching television, or weight change efforts, factors\nthat are thought to be related to weight change. Thus, it\nappears that the errors in classifying participants were ran-\ndom and would lead to underestimating true associations\nwith weight change, rather than biasing the results upwards.\nMoreover, it would be possible to use the Add Health data\nto create measurement error correction models, the results\nof which could be applied in analyses using self-reported\nweights.\nTaken together, the results suggest that self-reported\nweight is not a perfect measure, but the errors in estimating\nweight change are less than the errors in estimating weight\nat one point in time. For large prospective studies with a\ngeographically diverse sample, measuring the weight and\nheight of participants is neither logistically nor fiscally\npossible. These results suggest that using weight change\nbased on self-reported weights as a predictor or an outcome in\nanalyses should introduce very minimal measurement error.\n"
