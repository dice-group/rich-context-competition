Given the strong evidence that treatment services, such as mental/behavioral health,\nalcohol/substance abuse, and primary healthcare may reduce recidivism, the large number of prisoner releases\nhighlights the need for adequate treatment services in the community. It is within this context that the current\nstudy aims to examine the effects of prison deinstitutionalization on community based intervention modalities.\nMethods: This study set out to address a set of fundamental research questions in the current climate of reversing the\n40-year upward trend in prison population. This thread of inquiry is based on a hydraulic model of institutionalization\nof transinstitutionalization. This hydraulic framework posits that there are many overlaps between public safety and\nmental health needs, and that psychiatric institutionalization and penal institutionalization are functionally dependent.\nLongitudinal data with annual standardized measures such as rates and percentages for this change modeling were\nobtained from a number of national data programs for all 50 states.

However, only the bivariate association between imprisonment and substance\nabuse treatment admissions attained the conventional threshold of statistical significance. Holding constant the direct\nand indirect effects of changes in the rates of violent crime and illicit drug use, change in prison population was\nnegatively associated with changes in the rate of substance abuse (unstandardized coefficient = -0.891; p < 0.05) and\nmental health admissions (unstandardized coefficient = -0.509; p > 0.05) in the community.\nConclusion: By using a path analysis of the hydraulic model, we argue that social systems, similar to water moving in\nclosed tubes, aspire to equilibrate. In other words, a decrease in prison population will not go without a corresponding\nincrease in community mental health and substance abuse services. Social voids like those created by deinstitutionalization\nmust be filled; and with states deinstitutionalizing offenders the toll is on their corresponding communities to address\nthe needs of those offenders who are reentering after being incarcerated. In devising a policy and practice strategy to\naddress the projected increase in the reentry population, leadership within communities for social and supportive\nservices to ex-prisoners, specifically treatment services should be of primary concern.\n",

Of the 2.2 million persons\nincarcerated, when considering race, age and gender, the\ndisparity is staggering for young minority males (Glaze and\nlikely and Hispanic men were 2.5 times more likely to be\nimprisoned than white males (Carson and Golinelli 2013).\nwho are returning to communities in metropolitan areas\nwith high concentrations of ex-offenders, the challenges\nmay be overwhelmingly greater than for the larger reentry\npopulation. Many of these communities are facing high\nlevels of socioeconomic distress and are dealing with\nalready strained resources (Clear 2007). Complicating the\nreentry process and increasing the threat of unsuccessful\nreentry even more, present deinstitutionalization trends in-\ndicate an increase in the reentry population, in the not so\ndistant future.\nGiven the increase in state and municipal budget\nand the repeal of certain draconian drug laws, such as the\nRockefeller Drug Laws, it is likely that offenders' sentences\nmay be shorter than in previous years (Fields 2009;\nThe result could well be an increase in the number of ex-\noffenders released over the next few years, thus increasing\nthe count and density of ex-offenders in many communities\nacross the nation, making successful reintegration an even\ngreater strain on community resources.\nThe United States is already experiencing an increase\nin ex-offenders returning to communities nationwide, as\ndocumented in recent Bureau of Justice Statistics reports\non the prison population (Glaze 2011). The combined\nU.S. state and federal prison population, numbered\nfirst decline of prison population experienced since 1972\n(Guerino et al. 2011). After sharp unprecedented in-\nhas since grown at a slower pace, and is in its fourth\n2013). Over the same period, prison release increased by\nabout the same percentage (2.2%); thereby, slightly in-\ncreasing the rate of those returning from prisons and\njails back to their communities. Previously, in 2008, the\nnumber of ex-prisoners returning to the community\nreached an all-time high (Lattimore et al. 2010).\nReports indicate that out of the individuals who serve\na prison term, 90\u00ad95 percent will return to the commu-\nnity at least one time \u00ad most of whom will be rearrested\nwithin three years and returned to prison for new crimes\nor parole violations (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2007).\nAs prisoners are released from incarceration, the com-\nmunity is often called upon to provide treatment and\nother services in order to reduce recidivism. These tasks\nhave become increasingly overwhelming because there\nare more than seven million adults in the United States\nunder some form of criminal justice supervision\nData shows that many offenders currently under criminal\njustice supervision, either incarcerated or supervised in the\ncommunity, are diagnosed with multiple health issues, in-\ncluding mental health (Fazel and Danesh 2002), substance/\nWatson et al. 2004). Given the strong evidence that treat-\nment services, such as mental/behavioral health, alcohol/\nsubstance abuse, and primary healthcare may reduce recid-\nivism, the large number of prisoner releases highlights the\nneed for adequate treatment services in the community.\nThe importance of these treatment services lies in their\nrelationship to recidivism. Recidivism is a vital measure\nbecause it represents a significant societal cost, and it is a\nknown empirical observation that, while it might not be\ntrue in some communities, nationally, most released pris-\noners will re-offend. In addition, the time it takes for some-\none to recidivate for a drug-involved offense is much\nshorter than other types of offenses (Holleran 2002). This\nobservation suggests that addiction counseling may be\nexceptionally critical to reducing recidivism rates. However,\nmany states are not able to meet the multiple needs of\nthose returning from prison and jail due mainly to the lack\nof proper resources, specifically for treatment services\n(Frazier 2008). This is particularly true for those communi-\nties disproportionately impacted by high counts and\ndensities of returning ex-offenders (Gideon 2010).\nLiterature Review\nOverwhelming need for treatment services\nWhile released prisoners have many types of needs (e.g.\neducation, employment, housing, treatment services,\netc.), addiction counseling for alcohol and substance\nabuse is considered one of the most prominent. In fact,\nsixty to eighty percent of incarcerated offenders have\nbeen involved with drug use and, of this, approximately\nonly 11 percent have received any type of professional\ntreatment since admission (Center on Addiction and\nSubstance Abuse 2010). Studies have shown that ap-\nproximately half of all prisoners are diagnosed with\nsome form of substance abuse (Chandler et al. 2009).\nBased on two observations made by Spjeldnes et al.\n(2012), it is reasonable to assume that at least some of\nthese individuals will still need treatment once they are\nreleased from prison. Firstly, nearly three-quarters of\nstate prisoners, who are expected to be released within\nthe next year, reported a history of drug and/or alcohol\nabuse. Secondly, only one in six inmates received treat-\nment for alcohol/substance abuse or mental/behavioral\nproblems and even fewer received treatment after release\n(Spjeldnes, et al. 2012). In prison, the mental and phys-\nical problems of inmates go undiagnosed unless the in-\nmate complains, and even then, they may not receive\ntreatment for reasons such as the lack of adequate ser-\nvices (Ross et al. 2011). Since ex-offenders report sub-\nstance problems in prison but do not receive treatment,\nthe conclusion that they may need treatment in the\ncommunity upon release is supported.\nUnfortunately, many released prisoners do not receive\ntreatment upon release. In a Maryland study, Visher\net al. (2004) demonstrated gradually decreasing enroll-\nment of prisoners in drug or alcohol treatment pro-\ngrams. Twenty-seven percent of the approximately 300\nsurveyed respondents participated in such programs be-\nfore release. After 30\u00ad45 days post-release, the percent\ndropped to 18 percent, with a further drop to eight per-\ncent after four to six months following release (Visher,\nspondents indicated having had some type of outpatient\nsubstance abuse treatment in the past 30 days, and only\nthree percent had such treatment four to six months\nafter release. It is clear that treatment services may be\nuseful for released prisoners because 63 percent of sub-\njects in the study reported using alcohol and drugs more\noften or in larger amounts than they intended after be-\nIn addition to addiction treatment, released prisoners\nmay require mental health treatment. Research based on\ndata from personal interviews estimates that more than\nhalf of all inmates (including 56 percent of state pris-\noners, 45 percent of federal prisoners and 64 percent of\njail inmates) have a mental health problem (Hawkins\nto 31 percent of the nine million inmates released from\njail every year have a diagnosis of mental illness (Draine\net al. 2010). These individuals with mental illnesses may\nstrain the capacity of community mental health systems\nupon release because of their sheer numbers. This strain is\ncomplicated by the observation that offenders with mental\nhealth issues often have trouble complying with advice\nfrom mental health professionals. Using a sample consisting\nof 301 offenders from Allegheny County Jail in Pennsylva-\nnia, who were 30 days from release, Spjeldnes, et al. (2012)\ntracked the men after their release in an effort to determine\nfactors that could predict recidivism. The study examined\npersonal characteristics of the sample and found that 92\npercent of inmates, who had been diagnosed as severely\nmentally ill from the sample prison population, were\nknown to be non-adherent to psychiatric medications\nbefore their current arrest and 95 percent had a prior arrest.\nIt is possible that this non-adherence is due to inadequate\nsupervision from mental health professionals and deficient\nmental health care system within prison facilities. Some\nestimates suggest that up to 11 percent of prisoners may\nsuffer from dual diagnoses or co-occurring diseases \u00ad sub-\nstance abuse and mental illness being the most prevalent\n(Edens et al. 1998). Clearly, these observations suggest that\nthere might be resources to support only one of the ill-\nnesses, and that released prisoners receive worse or no\ntreatment relative to the general population.\nFurthermore, there is also evidence that the spread of\nHIV in the community may be disproportionately tied\nback to released prisoners. For example, 39 percent of all\nHIV-positive women in Rhode Island were first diagnosed\nwhile incarcerated, which suggests that establishing a link\nbetween prison and community follow-up treatment is es-\nsential (Flanigan et al. 1996). As described, the treatment\nneeds for released prisoners are dire and diverse. Ex-\nprisoners leave a fully controlled environment in prison\nand return to one in which they rely on the community to\nhelp them in the reintegration process. If needs are not\nmet, returning prisoners may return to crime, and the re-\nvolving door of the criminal justice system begins to turn\n(Morani et al. 2011). The community's inability to provide\nadequate services to released prisoners is further chal-\nlenged by the deinstitutionalization of persons with men-\nDeinstitutionalization in context\nDeinstitutionalization has three parts, which includes\n\"the release of individuals\" from the institution into the\ncommunity, \"their diversion\" from entering the institu-\ntion, and \"the development of alternative community\nsuccessful deinstitutionalization and reentry is proper\nplanning and implementation in all stages of reentry,\nwhich sometimes occur simultaneously. Mental health\ndeinstitutionalization was driven by both a desire to\nmaximize effectiveness of resources and a hope to make\nthe process of treating the mentally ill more humane.\nThe passage of the \"Community Mental Health Act of\n1963 was based on the optimism that former residents\nof state psychiatric institutions could find meaningful\nrestoration of their lives back in the community, with\nthe help of local mental health clinics\" (Bond et al. 2004,\np. 572). Unfortunately, the act did not work as intended\nbecause of poor implementation of community services\n(Bond et al. 2004). Thus, the community may still be suffer-\ning from its inability to properly treat mental health after\nthe deinstitutionalization in the 1960s. This is exceptionally\nimportant in the context of released prisoners because, as\nstated earlier, the prevalence of mentally ill offenders in-\ncarcerated in the nation's jails and prisons present an\nenormous challenge on communities in which these indi-\nviduals will be released to (LaVigne and Mamalian 2004).\nOne may argue that such a challenge is an indication of\nthe deinstitutionalization pendulum.\nAs a result of this deinstitutionalization movement,\nmore mentally ill individuals, who might have previously\nbeen treated in mental institutions, were being sent to\nprison, and, unfortunately, prison often worsens mental\nillness before individuals are released back into the com-\nmunity as seen in Figure 1 (Nicholas and Bryant 2013;\nHarcourt 2011). A common theme in both mental\nhealth and prison deinstitutionalization is that the com-\nmunity is often unprepared to meet the needs of these\nreentry populations. This is significant because institutions\noften can divert released patients or prisoners from re-\ninstitutionalization by connecting them to community re-\nsources, but the community still has not learned how to\nadjust to treatment needs of these individuals. In the case\nof the mentally ill, it appeared that community institutions\ndid not have the skills necessary to treat the mentally ill\nIt is within this context that the current study aims to\nexamine the effects of prison deinstitutionalization on\ncommunity based intervention modalities. As the deins-\ntitutionalization of mental institutions in the 1960s is be-\nlieved to have inversely impacted incarceration, it is\nhypothesized that the same relationship exists \u00ad that is,\nthat there is an inverse relationship between prison\ndeinstitutionalization and the demand for treatment ser-\nvices in the community.\nMethods\nResearch questions and hypotheses\nThis study set out to address a set of fundamental re-\nsearch questions in the current climate of reversing the\n40-year upward trend in prison population. How does the\nincipient reduction in prison population in different states\naffect mental health and substance abuse treatment needs\nin local communities? How does the deinstitutionalization\nof criminal offenders create new demands for substance\nabuse and mental health services in our communities?\nThis thread of inquiry is based on a hydraulic model of\ninstitutionalization of transinstitutionalization.\nThis hydraulic framework posits that there are many\noverlaps between public safety and mental health needs,\nand that psychiatric institutionalization and penal insti-\ntutionalization are functionally dependent: squeezing\none system of institutionalization can produce a bulge in\nanother system of institutionalization (Prins 2011). Just\nas earlier deinstitutionalization, which when coupled\nwith inadequate funding of community-based services\nfor individuals in need of psychiatric treatment led to\nthe criminalization of mental illness and attendant in-\ncreases in prison population (Earley 2006), current\ndeinstitutionalization of criminal offenders may lead to\nthe re-institutionalization of psychiatric patients if insuf-\nficient financial and political resources are committed to\nthe support of offenders with serious mental health or\ndrug abuse problems in the community. The involve-\nment of individuals with chronic and severe mental\nhealth or substance abuse problems in criminal justice\nprocesses is often known as \"entrenchment\" because\nthey remain imprisoned longer, are less likely to receive\ncommunity sanctions, and are much more likely to vio-\nlate their probation or parole conditions and return to\njail or prison than other offenders charged with compar-\nable offenses (Prins and Draper 2009). It is usually as-\nsumed that the size of this vulnerable population at the\nintersection of public health care and criminal justice\nsupervision has been relatively stable over time. Their\nE. Harcourt).\ninstitutional destination is mostly determined by the\nideological climate and policy environment of the time.\nTwo hypotheses are thus formulated to explain this\nhydraulic linkage between prison population downsizing\nand mental health/substance abuse service needs across\nthe 50 states of the union: (1) Change in the rate of state\nimprisonment is negatively associated with change in the\nrate of substance abuse treatment admissions in local\ncommunities; the greater the decrease in the size of the\nprison population, the greater the increase in the relative\nnumber of substance abuse treatment admissions in the\nstate, and vice versa; and (2) change in the rate of state\nimprisonment is negatively associated with change in the\nrate of mental health treatment admissions in local com-\nmunities; the greater the decrease in the size of the\nprison population, the greater the increase in the relative\nnumber of mental health treatment admissions in the\nstate, and vice versa. These hypotheses were tested with\nData\nLongitudinal data with annual standardized measures\nsuch as rates and percentages for this change modeling\nwere obtained from a number of national data programs\nfor all 50 states. Change was operationalized as the dif-\nference between two measurements in time. Since efforts\nat reversing the long trend of growing prison population\nstarted to gain momentum in the middle of the first dec-\nthe States 2010), our analytical focus concentrated on\nthe second half of the decade of the 2000s.\nThe two exogenous variables, change in the rate of\npast month prevalence of illicit drugs between 2005 and\n2010, were constructed from annual standardized mea-\nsures of arrests for violent crime and self-report past\nmonth illicit drug use from the Uniform Crime Reports\n(UCR) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and\nthe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)\nof the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nable in the path model, was computed based on the\nannual rate of incarceration in state prisons reported in\nthe National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) by the Bureau of\nJustice Statistics (BJS) (Harrison and Beck 2006; Guer-\nino, et al. 2011). A two-year time lag was built into the\nconstruction of the last two endogenous variables to spe-\ncify the temporal order in the sequencing of events.\nFirst, change in the rate of substance abuse treatment\nwas computed from SAMHSA's Treatment Episode Data\nSet (TEDS) (SAMHSA 2012b). Finally, change in the\nrate of in-patient admissions in state psychiatric hospi-\nMental Health National Outcome Measures (NOMS) by\nthe Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Uni-\nform Reporting System (URS) of SAMHSA.\nTable 1 provides a descriptive summary of the vari-\nables used in this analysis.

These fluctuations in institu-\ntional statistics took place in a wider context of changes\nin violent crime and substance abuse rates in the general\npercent and 4.55 percent respectively.\nAnalytical Strategies\nThe testing of the hypothesized inverse relationship be-\ntween changes in the prison population and changes in\nthe demands for community-based substance abuse and\nmental health services were executed in two stages. First,\na bivariate analysis was performed to yield Pearson's r\ncoefficients to detect the shape, direction, and strength\nTable 1 Description of variables (N = 50 states)\nVariable name Description Mean Std.

Then, a parsimonious\npath analysis model subjected the two hypotheses to a\nsimple multivariate test. The path analysis model speci-\nfied the flow of unidirectional impact from change in the\nprison population to changes in the substance abuse and\nmental health treatment populations in the community\nin the larger contexts of fluctuating levels of violent\ncrime and illicit drug use (see Figure 2). Since both hy-\npotheses were directional propositions asserting a nega-\ntive relationship between changes in prison population\nand changes in community demands for substance abuse\nand mental health services, a one-tail significance test\nwas implemented in both bivariate and path analysis\nmodels.\nResults\nTable 2 displays the correlation matrix involving the\nfive variables included in the analysis. Change in the\nstate imprisonment rate was negatively correlated with\nchange in the rate of substance abuse treatment admis-\nsions (r = -0.24; p < .05) and the change in the rate of\ninpatient admissions in state psychiatric hospitals (r =\nassociation between imprisonment and substance abuse\ntreatment admissions attained the conventional thresh-\nold of statistical significance. It became important to\nsee whether the direction and strength of these two\nmoderate links between change in the prison popula-\ntion and the change in the substance abuse and mental\nhealth treatment populations in the community can\nwithstand the multivariate test from the path analysis\nmodel.\nPath Analysis Model\nThe model Chi-square of 3.087 failed to attain the statis-\ntical significance level of .05 (see Table 3), which indi-\ncates that the fit between our reduced model and the\ndata is not significantly worse than the fit between the\njust-identified model in which there would be a direct\npath from each variable to each other variable (see\n(smaller than 0.9) and a Root Mean Square Error of\nwe conclude that the overall goodness of fit of the model\nEssentially, outcomes from the path analysis modeling\nreplicated and corroborated the bivariate findings.

For every one percentage-point decrease\nin the imprisonment rate there was a statistically signifi-\ncant increase of a 0.89 percentage-point in the rate of\nFigure 2 The hydraulic model of institutionalization.\nTable 2 Correlation matrix (N = 50 states)\n5.

The relatively short\nstricted the range of within-case variation over time in\nthis analysis of hydraulic transmission of institutional-\nized populations across systems. A longer time series\ndata in the future may provide a better description of\nthe phenomenon in the post-2000s decline in prison\npopulation. All in all, these outcomes provided partial\nbut very encouraging support to the two research\nhypotheses.\nFurther Research Implications\nThe concept of deinstitutionalization is longitudinal in na-\nture; therefore, its measurement and analysis require that\ndata and modeling techniques should be commensurate\nwith this necessity. It should also be noted that while the\nterm `deinstitutionalization' may summarize a national\ntrend, regional idiosyncrasies and patterns unique to indi-\nvidual states must be identified and interpreted. Two basic\nquestions should guide the theoretical elaboration and\nmethodological design of future epidemiological studies in\nprison deinstitutionalization: First, how does the process\nof deinstitutionalization evolve over time in each state?\nSecond, what demographic, socio-economic, and political\nforces predict differences among states in their change?\nOther secondary questions will also have to be addressed\nin future research including: What is the shape of the\nmean trend in deinstitutionalization over time? Do past\nlevels of incarceration predict the rate of change? Do two\nor more groups of states differ in their trajectories? How\ndoes rate of change or degree of curvature in the mean\ntrend predict local crime rates and/or demands for mental\nhealth and substance abuse services? Does significant\nbetween-state variability exist in the shape of the\ntrajectory?\nOn the policy side, the coincidence of the trend of\nprison deinstitutionalization with the implementation of\nthe Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, which is the\nmost revolutionary piece of health care legislation in the\nUnited States in 45 years, calls for intensive monitoring\nfrom public health and criminal justice researchers.\nTable 3 Model fit and effect coefficients of the path\nmodel (N = 50 states)\nModel fit\nRoot Mean Square Error of Approximation\nEffect coefficients of imprisonment rate\nUnstandardized\ncoefficient\nStandardized\ncoefficient\nS.

Two sets of ACA provisions should be of par-\nticular interest to researchers and policymakers. First,\nthe federal government will help states expand Medicaid\ncoverage by subsidizing 100% of expenditures for all in-\ndividuals under age 65 with income below 133% of the\nfederal poverty level who are not otherwise covered by\nSecond, treatment of mental health problems and sub-\nstance use disorders will be considered essential benefits.\nAccordingly, it is assumed that state governments may\nfind powerful incentives in releasing non-violent inmates\nfrom jails and prisons while sentencing non-violent of-\nfenders to community-based sanctions so that the med-\nical and psychiatric needs of these populations can be\nbetter attended in the community with federal funds.\nFuture research will have to focus on the effects of the\ndiversion of offenders with mental and substance abuse\nproblems to the community, the potential increased in-\nvestment on the continuity of care as a result of the re-\nduced correctional health care expenditures, and the\ncorrelation between reductions in racial disparities in in-\ncarceration and more equal access to health care in the\ncommunity. In addition, it is assumed that the landscape\nof services available for such at risk populations will\nevolve in such a manner that more somatic and mental\nhealth care needs will be addressed. Yet, these develop-\nments will also have to be examined in future studies.\nDiscussion and policy implications\nThe physics principle of connected vessels determines\nthat the amount of water in various connected vessels\nwill always aspire to equilibrate. Such principle is based\non the minimal potential energy principle suggesting\nthat any system will remain in its lowest potential energy\nas long as the system enables smooth transition between\ndifferent situations. Such principle also applies to the\npreliminary findings of this study; here we referred to it\nas the hydraulic transmission of institutionalized popula-\ntions across systems. By using this principle we argue\nthat social systems, similar to water moving in closed\ntubes, aspire to equilibrate; decrease in prison popula-\ntion will not go without a corresponding increase in\ncommunity mental health and substance abuse services.\nSocial voids like those created by deinstitutionalization\nmust be filled; and with states deinstitutionalizing of-\nfenders the toll is on their corresponding communities\nto address the needs of those offenders who are reenter-\ning after being incarcerated. Yet, such demand for com-\nmunity services to the offenders' population should not\nbe taken lightly. As previously discussed in this article,\nsome communities may require more services than\nothers. Many incarcerated individuals are suffering from\none medical condition or another, while others may be\nsuffering from the morbidity of physical, mental, and\nsubstance/alcohol issues.\nThe prevalence of many chronic diseases, substance\nabuse, and mental health issues is much higher among in-\ncarcerated offenders compared to non-offenders (Dretsch\ndeinstitutionalization demands that such issues be ad-\ndressed. This is more than just moving offenders from jails\nand prisons back to the community; this is about public\nsafety and public health. We suspect that in the near fu-\nture more incarcerated offenders will be released earlier to\nthe community to alleviate conditions of overcrowding,\nand states' budgetary crises. However, if we are to make\nthis new deinstitutionalization movement work, proper\nplanning and action must take place. Society still has re-\nsponsibility for the safety and health of all its members,\nand that includes those released from our correctional fa-\ncilities. With the recent approval of the Affordable Care\nAct (ACA) of 2010, released offenders will become eligible\nand, as intimated previously, have better access to health\ncoverage in 2014. Consequently, it is assumed that such\navailability to health-related services in the community, to\nmany individuals who were lacking it before the ACA, will\nlikely reduce criminal behavior among mentally ill and\nthose battling addiction. Yet, the ACA does not guarantee\nthat all those who are in need for psychiatric care will fol-\nlow their treatment plan. Some simply stop attending their\ntreatment sessions, while others stop taking their medica-\ntions because they think they do not need them anymore\nand can do without them. Such course of action will re-\nquire better outreach and community monitoring to those\nin need.\nAs discussed by Lamb and Bachrach (2001), deins-\ntitutionalization is not a one step process, but rather\nhas three parallel phases: (1) the release of individuals\nfrom the institution into the community; (2) the diver-\nsion of individuals from entering the institution; and\n(3) the development of alternative community services.\nConsequently, any policy that wishes to be successful in\nthe prison deinstitutionalization movement should in-\nvolve considerable planning that will target all three\nphases, by properly acknowledging the alternatives to\nincarceration and institutionalization, and how such al-\nternatives are better equipped to address the needs of\nthose individuals targeted by the policy. We suggest,\nthat more should be done at intake stages to identify\nthe multiple and complex needs and risks of the con-\nvicted offender. This will enable criminal justice agents\nto tailor a more appropriate and individualized course\nof action, while also coordinating what services are\nneeded and in what specific geographic locations. Part-\nnering with agencies in the community is thus of para-\nmount importance to the process, as such agencies will\nabsorb and treat those who are convicted, as well as\nthose who have already served time. As mentioned earl-\nier in this section, the landscape of community based\nhealthcare intervention is about to change over the\ncoming years. As the U.S. grapples to unwrap the ACA\nand estimate the magnitude of its surprise, various\nchallenges will, without doubt, affect criminal justice\nclients and the criminal justice system. Enrolling indi-\nviduals involved in the criminal justice system into Me-\ndicaid, diverting large numbers of mentally ill and\nsubstance abusing offenders from criminal justice solu-\ntions to community-based healthcare interventions,\nand fostering partnerships will be one of the biggest\nchallenges of both deinstitutionalization and the ACA;\ntwo mammoth challenges that share similar interests,\nand perhaps even similar destinies.\nImplications for Provision of Treatment Service Providers\nIn devising a policy and practice strategy to address the pro-\njected increase in the reentry population, leadership within\ncommunities for social and supportive services to ex-\nprisoners, specifically treatment services should be of pri-\nmary concern. This is especially true in those communities\nwith large counts and densities of returning ex-offenders, as\nthey face even greater challenges of pro-social integration\nand improved public safety. The findings of this study sup-\nport the need for organizations that provide treatment ser-\nvices to improve accessibility to ex-prisoners and improve\npro-social reintegration for ex-offenders in their communi-\nties. Specifically, reentry stakeholders should be encouraged\nto take a leadership role in building the outreach and net-\nworking capacity for treatment services for ex-offenders.\nThis step, which consists of outreach, networking, com-\nmunity justice/reentry partnerships and funding resource\nbuilding, requires strategic planning, implementation, and\nevaluation. These organizations should develop policies\nwhich would: (1) engage in more outreach to ex-prisoners;\n(2) engage in more networking between other service pro-\nviders, community organizations and community justice\nand governmental agencies; and (3) seek more reentry\nfunding to increase provision of treatment services.\nOutreach\nSeveral elements of outreach are relevant at this junc-\nture. First, ex-prisoners need to be made aware of men-\ntal health services prior to release. Most often ex-\noffenders do not get connected to the treatment services\nthey need. Accordingly, it is vital to examine the experi-\nences and preparedness of those individuals revolving\nthrough the criminal justice system, and how the system\naddresses their special needs, be they mental health,\nsubstance abuse, or any other health related needs\n(Gideon 2013). These are essential for orchestrating\nsmoother transitions from incarceration back to the\ncommunity. Such practice is known as discharge plan-\nning, and it provides the critical link between prison-\nbased intervention process and the transition back to\nthe community. The ultimate goal of the discharge plan\nis to link inmates with appropriate health and other hu-\nman service providers in the community (Mellow et al.\n2008), in order to ease the transition and to reduce the\nrisk of recidivism. An essential part of the discharge plan\nis the need for outreach programs that will identify and\ndirect needed individuals in the right direction. Specific-\nally, the process of outreach must begin during pre-\nrelease and continue through the last stage of reentry,\ncalled post-supervision. Research has found that only\nabout a third of organizations engage in pre-release out-\nMental health organizations should be encouraged and\nprovided opportunities by correctional facilities at every\nlevel (federal, state, and county) to do the same. Sec-\nondly, outreach must address issues of eligibility and ac-\ncessibility. Individuals returning from prison and jail\nface an array of challenges: not only are they grappling\nwith feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem and hope-\nlessness, they must also negotiate the bureaucratic hur-\ndles required by many agencies. In a study by Frazier\n(2008), providers stated that making the requirements\nand processes clear and intelligible is an initial step that\ncould assist ex-prisoners. Thirdly, community organiza-\ntions of all types should be encouraged to share informa-\ntion on services available to ex-prisoners, especially\nthose that have completed their sentences and are no\nlonger connected to the criminal justice system. A con-\ncentrated effort must be made throughout the entire\ncommunity to create more awareness of services that or-\nganizations claim they are able to provide, especially ser-\nvices that assist in successful reintegration. These\norganizations, as well as ex-prisoners, should also be en-\ngaged in finding new and better ways to reach out to in-\ndividuals returning from prison or jail, connecting them\nwith services.\nNetworking\nTaking the leadership role of networking should be ad-\ndressed on two fronts: community justice/reentry partner-\nships, as well as both formal and informal networking\namong all organizations within the community, even those\nthat do not provide social and supportive services to ex-\nprisoners. Community justice/reentry partnerships take\nplace between criminal justice agencies (i.e. the courts,\nparole and probation, and the police) and community or-\nganizations and institutions. Presently, few organizations\ncollaborate with parole and probation agencies at the\nfederal, state, or county levels (Frazier 2008). These and\nother collaborations should be encouraged to grow and\ncontinue, while new ones should be encouraged to de-\nvelop. The benefits of such networks considerably im-\nprove the provision of services and other desired\noutcomes, such as improved outreach.\nFunding\nBecause funding is the primary barrier to increased\nprovision of treatment services, leadership is needed to\npromote education and awareness of funding streams\nand processes. Since many treatment service organiza-\ntions lack the resources necessary to seek and success-\nfully apply for additional potential funding, leadership in\npartnering with funding sources to provide workshops\nand seminars that could be valuable for organizations\nseeking to serve more ex-prisoners. Leadership is also\nneeded to determine and share best practices that may\nimprove capacity without increased funding. In other\nwords, more direction on ways to improve efficiency and\neffectiveness would also help organizations to improve\ntheir ability to serve more ex-prisoners.\nConclusion\nDeinstitutionalization should not be about becoming\nmore lenient or less punitive; it should be about being\npro-social and supportive of the reintegration of ex-\noffenders while maintaining the health and safety of the\ncommunity. Years of valuable research informs us that\nwe cannot, and should not, tolerate practices of locking\nup people as the sole means of punishment (Clear 1994),\nas such practice have a negative effect on our communi-\nties. Ignoring the needs of the incarcerated as well as\nthose of society, does more harm than good, and will re-\nsult in the failure of deinstitutionalization as once before\nexperienced by the deinstitutionalization of the mentally\nill. Further, failure to address the needs of those diverted,\nand otherwise released from prison may also result in in-\ncrease of violent crimes, which in turn, will create a new\ncry for more incarceration. Such destructive cycle must\nbe broken if the present prison deinstitutionalization\nmovement is not to mirror that of the previous mental\nhealth deinstitutionalization movement.\nWhile the present study focuses on mental health and\nsubstance abuse treatment, every area of healthcare\n(HIV/AIDS and primary health care, alcohol and sub-\nstance abuse treatment, and mental and behavioral\nhealth treatment) is seen to be of great need within the\ncommunity. In addition, in-patient treatment is among\nthe least provided services and these providers have the\nleast capacity to serve more ex-prisoners (Frazier 2008).\nEffort and great attention must be given to each individ-\nual healthcare arena instead of viewing them in concert.\nThe various services, issues, and treatments must be\nviewed separately and we must remember that each pro-\nvider type may face somewhat different challenges. Ac-\ncessibility not only includes issues of location and\nproximity to service providers, it also includes access to\ntreatment and available treatment options.\nAdditionally, mental illness and substance abuse--of-\nten co-existing disorders--place ex-prisoners at high risk\nof re-incarceration, reconviction, or re-arrest and also\ncontribute to instability in employment and housing.\nSome ex-prisoners are treated for both mental illness\nand substance abuse while incarcerated; however, once\nreleased, most often there is no continuum of care. Even\nfewer ex-prisoners receive treatment for HIV/AIDS be-\ncause there is no mandatory testing for inmates (Maca-\nWhile strict Health Insurance Portability and Account-\nability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) laws prevent sharing of pa-\ntient information, efforts must be made to improve the\ncontinuum of care for those receiving treatment while\nincarcerated. Attention must also be given to building\npartnerships to share referrals and find other ways to\nprovide these desperately needed healthcare services.\nWith the ACA the potential barriers to the treatment of\nthose offenders diverted/deinstitutionalized should be\nidentified and resolved before it is too late. Positioning\navailable services to released offenders, and those who\nare in the community and foster such needed partner-\nships will determine the success of both movements.\nStudy Limitations\nReaders should be aware of two limitations in our data,\none of theoretical nature and the other with methodo-\nlogical implications. First, the use of change in state im-\nprisonment rates as the mediating variable in the model\ndid not allow the discrimination of prison admissions\nfrom prison releases. While most discussions have focused\non penal policy reforms leading to decreases in prison\npopulations, it is also true that violent crime rates have\ndramatically declined across the country since the 1990s.\nTherefore, recent reductions in prison populations could\nhave been triggered by both decreased admissions (due to\ncrime decline and a more widely use of diversion pro-\ngrams) and increased releases. Since the hydraulic model\nhypothesized in this analysis assumed a relative stability in\nthe total size of institutionalized populations and an in-\nverse correlation between correctional institutionalization\nand psychiatric institutionalization, the exclusion of mea-\nsures of prison admission and release did not affect the\ngoodness of data for the testing of the two hypotheses.\nSecond, time series data used in this analysis pertained\nobservation rendered a longitudinal sample with a lim-\nited number of years, which may have restricted the stat-\nistical power of our analysis. As a result, the risk of type\nII error or the failure to reject a false null hypothesis\nwas high, making our results conservative in nature.\nThat is, the probability of missing the true effect of\nprison populations on community treatment populations\nwas much higher than the probability of detecting the\neffect when it did not exist.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nBDF provided conceptual and theoretical framework, and recommendations.\nHS and LG provided research designed, statistical analysis and findings.
