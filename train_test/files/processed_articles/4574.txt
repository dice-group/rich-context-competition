Data were collected from 887 adolescents (52% males) with a mean age of 13.4 years. Participants\nrated three measures of problem behaviors (delinquent behavior, cigarette smoking, and problem substance use), three\ntypes of psychosocial protection (models protection, controls protection, and support protection), and three types of\npsychosocial risk (models risk, opportunity risk, and vulnerability risk). Female adolescents reported lower levels of problem\nbehavior involvement than male adolescents. Psychosocial protective and risk factors accounted for significant variation in\nadolescents' problem behavior involvement. For males, models risk was the most important risk factor in problem behavior\ninvolvement variation, whereas for females, opportunity risk was the most important risk factor. Present findings are useful\nin understanding problem behavior involvement among Egyptian youth and informing the design of interventions to reduce\nproblem behavior.\n",

The theory has been supported by empirical\nresearch conducted in the United States and other countries\nPBT explanatory model should have general applicability to\nyouth growing up anywhere. Although the magnitude of\nproblem behaviors might vary across societies, the theoreti-\ncal associations between risk and protective factors and\nproblem behavior should be consistent across settings. Little\nis known about the applicability of Jessor's PBT to Arabic\ncultures that may be different not only in terms of the preva-\nlence of problem behaviors and levels of risk and protection\nbut also in terms of cultural characteristics such as religion,\neducational structure, and/or political system.\nThe current study examines the applicability of the PBT\nin Egypt, an Arabic country. Egypt is markedly different\nfrom other countries in which the PBT has been tested in\nterms of religious, educational, political, economic, and\nsocial indicators. Despite the societal differences and more\nmicro-level differences in the levels of risk factors, protec-\ntive factors, and problem behavior involvement in Egypt in\ncomparison with other contexts, we expect to find similar\nassociations between risk and protective factors and problem\nbehaviors in the present study as observed in previous work\nin other settings (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2000; Jessor et al.,\nPBT\nThe PBT is a social\u00adpsychological framework that explains\nthe relationship between psychosocial protective and risk\nfactors and involvement in a variety of problem behaviors\nsuch as delinquent behavior, substance use, problem drink-\ning, and early sexual intercourse (Donovan et al., 1991).\nAccording to the theory, protective factors decrease the\n1Psychology Department, Faculty of Arts, Menoufia University, Egypt\nCorresponding Author:\nOmnia E.

In contrast, risk factors increase the likelihood of ado-\nlescents' involvement in problem behavior. Conceptually,\npsychosocial risk factors include models for risk behavior,\nopportunity for engaging in risk behavior, and personal and\nsocial vulnerability to engage in risk behavior (Costa, Jessor,\n& Turbin, 2007). Psychosocial risk and protective factors\nhave been shown to account for substantial amounts of vari-\nance in adolescent problem behavior for both males and\nfemales and for younger and older adolescents across groups\nvarying in socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity sub-\ngroups (Jessor et al., 2003). In addition, the theory hypothe-\nsizes that protective factors play an additional indirect role in\nthe occurrence of adolescent problem behavior by moderat-\ning the impact of risk factors (Jessor et al., 2003) and empiri-\ncal evidence has supported that moderation (Jessor et al.,\n2003; Jessor, Van Den Bos, Vanderryn, Costa, & Turbin,\nFew studies have tested the applicability of PBT in devel-\noping societies. Jessor et al. (2003) examined PBT in two\nadolescent samples from China and the United States.\nResults indicated that the same protective and risk factors\naccounted for a substantial amount of variance of problem\nbehaviors in both samples, even though problem behaviors\nwere less prevalent among Chinese adolescents than U.S.\nadolescents. In another report based on the same data, Costa\net al. (2005) showed that four contexts of adolescents' life\n(family, peer, school, and neighborhood) provided a substan-\ntial account of problem behaviors among Chinese and\nAmerican adolescents. Results also indicated that the family\nand peer contexts were the most influential in the U.S. sam-\nple, whereas the peer and school contexts were the most\ninfluential in the Chinese sample. The neighborhood context\nwas least influential for both samples.\nVazsonyi et al. (2008) examined the applicability of PBT\nin Georgia and Switzerland. Results supported the applica-\nbility of PBT across these societies outside the United States.\nA more recent study conducted by Ndugwa et al. (2011)\ninvestigated the applicability of PBT among adolescents liv-\ning in two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, a low-\nincome country. Results indicated that protective and risk\nfactors provided a substantial account of adolescent's prob-\nlem behavior variation. Results also indicated that models\nprotection can moderate the impact of risk factors on prob-\nlem behavior vulnerability. Another recent comparative\nstudy by Vazsonyi et al. (2010) investigated the extent to\nwhich the PBT explained problem behavior in a sample of\n10,310 adolescents from eight countries: Hungary, the\nNetherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey,\nand the United States. Results provided evidence of great\nsimilarities in the associations between risk and protective\nfactors and the problem behavior involvement across\ncultures.\nGender Differences in Problem\nBehavior\nExisting studies on gender differences in problem behaviors\nhave focused on individual problem behaviors such as sub-\nstance use, academic failure, and violence (Chun & Mobley,\n2010). In general, compared with females, male adolescents\nhave higher rates of individual problem behaviors (e.g.,\nmore likely to initiate delinquent acts over time (e.g.,\nWilliams et al., 2007), and are more delinquent at all ages\n(Miller, Malone, & Dodge, 2010). Mears, Ploeger, and Warr\n(1998), however, in their study of gender differences in\ndelinquent behavior among adolescents in the United States\nshowed that males were substantially more likely than\nfemales to have delinquent friends and appeared to be more\nstrongly affected by delinquent peers than were females.\nHowever, other researchers have shown that the same risk\nfactors (e.g., mental health problems, running away, gang\ninvolvement, and secure detention) predict serious, violent,\nand chronic offenses among males and females (e.g.,\nJohansson & Kempf-Leonard, 2009), and gender-coded\nactivities increased the risk of problem and delinquent\nbehaviors for both boys and girls (e.g., Dennis, 2012).\nFew studies have examined whether gender might be a\npredictive factor of multiple problem behavior involvement.\nBeam, Gill-Rivas, Greenberg, and Chen (2002) found that\nbeing male and having peers who engage in misconduct were\nassociated with more adolescent involvement in problem\nbehavior among high school students in Los Angeles. Chun\nand Mobley (2010) investigated the structure of problem\nbehavior across gender and grade level. Results indicated\nthat females had a lower tendency for unconventionality\ncompared with males. Being female was less predictive of\nproblem behavior involvement among U.S. adolescents.\nOverall, study findings provide a good rationale for testing\ngender differences in the effects of protective and risk factors\nin the present study. In addition, documenting the differences\nbetween male and female adolescents on problem behavior\ninvolvement in relation to protective and risk factors is\nessential to better understand this phenomenon and to inform\nmore targeted prevention programs.\nStudy Context\nEgypt is an Arab country located in northeast Africa with a\npopulation of 83 million. The country covers an area of about\n1 million square kilometers. More than 90% of the popula-\ntion is Muslim. Official reports indicate that 18.4% of\nEgyptians live below the poverty threshold and only 51.5%\nEl-Shenawy and Shehata 3\nof Egyptian families have enough income to support their\nmonthly needs (Egyptian Cabinet, Information Center and\nDecision Making Support, 2010). Almost a third of the popu-\nlation comprises children and adolescents younger than 15\nyears of age (The Egyptian Central Agency for Public\nIslamic values and norms have a huge impact on Egyptian\nadolescents'behaviors. For example, there are limited oppor-\ntunities to establish relations with the opposite sex (Al-Omari,\n2008) as the segregation of sexes is still a very common phe-\nnomenon throughout most Arab countries including Egypt.\nThis segregation is based on Islamic values and also rein-\nforced by Arab values pertaining to the honor of the family\n(Al-Omari, 2008). In addition, opportunities for residential\nseparation from parents and the larger family are almost non-\nHofstede (2001) noted that Arab countries are character-\nized by collective cultures, which are thought to be less con-\nducive to the overt expression of deviance and tend to\nencourage suppression of socially disapproved behavior\n(Greenberg et al., 2000). However, the Egyptian societal\nstructure has changed during recent decades because of cul-\ntural, social, and economic changes (Saif & Choucair, 2010).\nEgyptian youth are exposed to liberal behavioral models\nthrough the Internet and media that are associated with\npoorer parental relationships, lower levels of religiosity, and\nlower levels of academic commitment (Shehata &\nEl-Shenawy, 2010). Egyptian adolescents, therefore, face a\nconflict between conservative social norms (e.g., obedience,\nsubmissiveness, compliance, etc.) and liberal or unconven-\ntional practices (Nydell, 2006). In fact, one aspect of\nEgyptian culture urges youth to focus on Islamic knowledge\nand traditional identity, while the other aspect provides them\nwith a new identity emphasizing use of information technol-\nogies, 21st-century science, and new global ideas (Asik,\nPrevious studies indicate that the problem behavior\ninvolvement rate is higher when the children were exposed\nto socioeconomic risk factors, such as poverty (Deater-\nDeckard, Dodge, Bates, & Pettited, 1998; Samrakkody,\nFernando, McClure, Perera & De Silva, 2012). Official data\nshow an increasing rate of crimes committed by adolescents\nin resource-limited settings (Egyptian Interior Ministry,\n2007). Available data from a few studies carried out to\nexplore problem behavior in Egypt report wide variation of\nprevalenceamongEgyptianstudents(Shehata&El-Shenawy,\nety has also been linked to problem behavior involvement\nCurrent Study\nFew studies have examined the theoretical underpinnings of\nproblem behaviors among Egyptian adolescents. Problem\nbehavior prevalence among these adolescents can be better\nunderstood by applying existing theoretical frameworks. The\npresent research examined the applicability of PBT and\nexplores the contribution that psychosocial protection and\nrisk factors can make to explain problem behavior among\nmale and female adolescents in Alexandria and Shebeen\nEl-Koom, Egypt. The study assessed (a) whether Egyptian\nadolescents' scores on measures of problem behavior\ninvolvement and on measures of protective and risk factors\ndiffered by gender, (b) whether associations among protec-\ntive and risk factors and problem behavior involvement were\nsimilar to those found in previous studies, and (c) whether\nthe protective factors moderated the relationship between\nrisk factors and problem behavior involvement. Based on\nprevious studies, we expected that Egyptian female adoles-\ncents would be less likely than males to report problem\nbehavior involvement and that the scores on measures of\nprotective and risk factors would differ between Egyptian\nfemale and male adolescents. Based on Jessor's PBT, we\nexpected that protective factors would decrease the likeli-\nhood of involvement in problem behavior, whereas risk fac-\ntors would increase the likelihood of problem behavior\ninvolvement. We also expected to find that protective factors\nwould also moderate the relationship between risk factors\nand problem behavior involvement.\nMethod\nParticipants\nData were collected from a sample of 887 Egyptian adoles-\ncents (52% males) attending intermediate schools in\nAlexandria and Shebeen El-Koom. In all, 530 participants\nwere from Alexandria city and 357 were from Shebeen\nEl-Koom. Adolescents in Grade 7 were around 60%, 29%\nwere in Grade 8 and 11% were in Grade 9. The mean age of\nthe adolescents was 13.4 years. A majority of adolescents\n(85%) were enrolled in public schools.\nSampling\nFour schools were randomly selected from a list of the 437\nAlexandria intermediate schools and three schools were ran-\ndomly selected from a list of the 410 Shebeen El-Koom\nintermediate schools. Within each school, all students from a\nnon-randomly selected grade level were included in the sam-\nple after obtaining the approval of the students to participate\nin the study.\nProcedures\nPermission to conduct the study was granted by the Egyptian\nMinistry of Education. Data were collected in March 2009,\nusing a structured interview capturing sociodemographic\ncharacteristics, behavior as well as measures of psychosocial\nprotective and risk factors. The questionnaire was translated\nby the authors into Arabic language. Back translation into\nEnglish was done by an Egyptian professor in the English\n4 SAGE Open\ndepartment at Menoufia University, Egypt. The Arabic trans-\nlation and the back-translation were externally reviewed and\nthe Arabic translation was revised accordingly.\nMeasures\nAge was measured using a single item. Participants indicated\ntheir sex. Responses were coded 1 for male and 2 for female.\nParticipants were asked to indicate their educational stage.\nResponses were coded 1 for Grade 7, 2 for Grade 8, and 3 for\nGrade 9. The area of residence was coded as 1 for urban\n(Alexandria) and 2 for rural (Shebeen El-Koom).\nProblem behavior involvement was assessed using the\nMultiple Problem Behavior Index (MPBI), which is an aver-\nage of T-scored measures of adolescents' involvement in\nthree different types of problem behavior: (a) delinquent\nbehavior, including theft, vandalism, and physical aggres-\nsion (Cronbach's  = .72 for the present study); (b) cigarette\nsmoking based on participants' reports of frequency and\namount of smoking in the past month and the past year\n(Cronbach's  = .80 for the present study); and (c) problem\ndrinking (Jessor et al., 2003). The last subscale was replaced\nby problem substance use; this was done because the lowest\nconsumption levels can be found in the countries of North\nAfrica, sub-Saharan Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean\nregion, and southern Asia and the Indian Ocean. These\nregions represent large populations of the Islamic faith,\nwhich have very high rates of abstention (World Health\nsubscale is based on the adolescents' self-reports of sub-\nstance use frequency, frequency of high volume substance\nuse, and the negative consequences of substance use\n(Cronbach's  = .75 for the present study). The term sub-\nstance use in the present study explicitly covers cannabis\n(marijuana) and recreational use of prescription pills.\nRespondents rated frequency of substance use on an 8-point\nscale. Higher scores reflect high frequency of substance use.\nNegative consequences of substance use were assessed by\nanswering five items (Table 1). The alpha reliability of the\nthree components of the MPBI was .70. In general, alpha\nreliabilities of problem behavior measures in the present\nstudy were comparable with other studies (Jessor et al.,\nThree types of psychosocial protection (models protec-\ntion, control protection, and support protection), and three\ntypes of risk (models risk, opportunity risk, and vulnerability\nrisk) were assessed using Jessor and colleagues'(2003) com-\nposite measures of the three types of protection and the three\ntypes of risk. Each psychosocial composite measure was\nconstructed by averaging all of the items in its component\nsubscales, standardized and equally weighted, with a mean\nof zero. A description of the measures is presented in Table 1\n(for more details about the measures, see Jessor et al., 2003).\nThe alpha reliabilities of the three measures of protective\nfactors in the present study were .61 for models protection,\n.71 for controls protection, and .75 for support protect. The\nalpha reliabilities of the three types of risk were .70 for mod-\nels risk, .78 for opportunity risk (availability), .88 for oppor-\ntunity risk (gangs), and .82 for vulnerability risk. Each\nmeasure was transformed to a T score, and means for the\nstudy constructs were then calculated for males and females.\nStatistical Analysis\nAs a first step, initial descriptive statistics were computed for\nrisk factor composite measures' scores, protective factor\ncomposite measures' scores, and the MPBI scores. Before\nexamining whether the multivariate explanatory model of\nPBT applies to Egyptian adolescents, we estimated the par-\ntial correlations between risk and protective factors and the\nproblem behavior involvement index to establish the rela-\ntionships of the predictor measures with the problem behav-\nior outcome variable, the MPBI. Hierarchical linear\nregression analysis (enter method) was then used to assess\nthe applicability of PBT across Egyptian adolescent\nsamples.\nResults\nTable 2 presents group means on protective factors, risk fac-\ntors, and problem behavior measures for males and females\nseparately. Male adolescents reported lower levels of control\n50.89) than females. However, males reported a higher level\nHigher levels of vulnerability risk among female adolescents\nsuggest that they had lower self-esteem, lower expectations\nof success, greater depression, and greater stress. With\nrespect to problem behavior involvement, females reported\nless involvement in problem behavior types than males.\nTable 3 presents the bivariate correlations between prob-\nlem behavior measures and protective and risk factors by\ngender. Correlations among the three types of psychosocial\nprotection (models, controls, and support) ranged from .10 to\nsample, which were all were positive. Correlations among\nthe four measures of risk factors ranged from .19 to .30 for\nthe male sample, from .14 to .24 for the female sample that\nwas again positive. As expected, correlations between the\npsychosocial protective factors measures and the risk factors\nmeasures were negative and ranged from -.04 to -.43 for the\nall but two were positive but not significant in both samples.\nAs shown in Table 3, correlations between the MPBI and the\npsychosocial protective factors measures (models, controls,\ntively, for the male sample, whereas for the female sample\ntively.

Demographic variables (gen-\nder, educational stage, and socioeconomic level) were\nentered in Step 1 of the hierarchical regression accounting\nfor 3% (p < .001) of the variance in problem behavior\ninvolvement. The protective factors were entered at Step 2.\nThis model accounted for 19% of variance (p < .001) in\nproblem behavior involvement. The four psychosocial risk\nfactors were added in the third step. This model accounted\nuniquely for 29% of variance (p < .001). Given that some\nvariance is shared between protective and risk factors, psy-\nchosocial protective factors were entered after the psychoso-\ncial risk factors in a supplementary analysis and they\naccounted uniquely for 3% of variance (p < .001) compared\nwith 11% for the risk factors.\nControl protection and support protection were signifi-\ncant predictors of problem behavior involvement (p < .001).\nIn addition, three measures of psychosocial risk factors were\nsignificant predictors of problem behavior involvement\n(model risk, opportunity risk (availability), and vulnerability\nThe next set of analyses examined the possible moderat-\ning role of protective factors on the relation of risk factors to\nproblem behavior. Here again, demographic variables (gen-\nder, educational stage, and socioeconomic level) were\nentered first, followed by protective factors in the second\nstep, the psychosocial risk factors measures in the third step,\nand the 12 interactions of the three protective and four risk\nfactors in the last step. Non-significant interactions at the 5%\nlevel were later dropped, and this model was refitted with\nonly the significant interactions. The final model is shown in\nTable 4. When the only significant interactions were added at\nthe last step, 31% of variance in problem behavior involve-\nment was explained. There were only three significant\ninteractions; however, one of those three interactions was in\nthe opposite direction from theoretical prediction. Figure 1\nillustrates the moderator effects for protection factors on the\nassociation between risk factors and the MPBI. Models pro-\ntection significantly moderated the relationship of opportu-\nnity risk\u00adgang to the problem behavior involvement. The\nrelation of opportunity risk\u00adgang to the problem behavior\ninvolvement is stronger when models protection is low com-\npared with when models protection is high. This is illustrated\nby the smaller difference between the high- and low-risk\ngroups under high models protection than under low models\nprotection (Figure 1, Graph A). In addition, control protec-\ntion significantly moderated the relation of model risk to the\nproblem behavior involvement. High models risk was more\nlikely to be related to problem behavior involvement under\nlow control protection than high control protection (Figure 1,\nGraph B).\nThe next set of analyses examined whether the relative\nimportance of separate risk and protective factors to varia-\ntion in adolescents problem behavior differed by gender\n(Table 5). Hierarchical regression was conducted again for\neach sample. Here again, demographic variables (educa-\ntional stage and socioeconomic level) were entered first, fol-\nlowed by protective factors in the second step, and risk\nfactors in the last step. The entry of demographic variables\nexplained 3.7% of the variance in problem behavior involve-\nment for females and 1% for males. With the entry of the\nthree measures of protective factors in the next step, 22.4%\nof the variance in problem behavior involvement for females\nand 16% for males was explained. When the four measures\nof risk factors were entered in the final step, 30.4% of vari-\nance in problem behavior involvement among females and\n27.7% among males was explained.

Non-significant interactions at the 5% level\nwere later dropped, and this model was refitted with only the\nsignificant interactions. The final model is shown in Table 5\n(Step 4). Only one interaction was significant in the female\nsample--models protection significantly moderated the rela-\ntion of model risk to problem behavior involvement. High\nmodels risk was more likely to be related to problem behav-\nior involvement under low control protection than high con-\ntrol protection (Figure 1, Graph C). Two interactions were\nsignificant in the male sample; however, one of these two\nwas in the opposite direction from theoretical prediction.\nControl protection significantly moderated the relation of\nopportunity risk\u00adavailability to the problem behavior\ninvolvement. High opportunity risk (availability) was more\nlikely to be related to problem behavior involvement under\nlow control protection than high control protection (Figure 1,\nGraph D).\nDiscussion\nThe present study examined the applicability of PBT for\nEgyptian adolescents. The results indicated that female ado-\nlescents have a lower tendency for unconventionality. These\nresults are consistent with previous gender difference stud-\nies, which indicated that being male was associated with\ngreater involvement in problem behavior (Beam et al., 2002)\nand being female was less predictive of problem behavior\nIn general, the present results support the theoretical con-\ncepts of PBT and the idea of general applicability of the PBT\nexplanatory model (Jessor, 2008) in an Arabic Muslim cul-\nture.

The relationship among models protection,\nsupport protection, and problem behavior involvement was\nnot significant for the adolescent male sample. Similar\nresults were found by Vazsonyi et al.

These\nresults indicate that although female adolescents had a lower\naverage level of problem behavior involvement than male\nadolescents, their risk factors differ from those of males.\nThis may also be an indicator that the etiology of problem\nbehavior involvement is different for boys and girls. The\nimportance of separate risk and protective factors in\nexplaining problem behavior involvement for males and\nfemales in the present study suggests that prevention pro-\ngrams need to be tailored differently for boys and girls.\nIn terms of the direct effects of risk and protective factors\non problem behavior involvement, both factors had nearly\nequivalent associations with Egyptian female adolescents'\nproblem behavior involvement, but the association with risk\nfactors was greater than that of protective factors on Egyptian\nmale adolescents' problem behavior involvement. A similar\nfinding was observed among poor urban adolescents aged\nThese results suggest the need for systematic efforts for both\nLow opport. risk\ngang\nHigh opport. risk\ngang\nLow models\nprotection\nHigh models\nprotection\nModeraon of combined models proteconl \u00d7 opprt.risk\ngang to problem behaviour involvement : total sample\nLow models risk\nHigh models risk\nLow models\ncontrol\nHigh models\ncontrol\nModeraon of combined models control \u00d7 models\nrisk to problem behaviour involvement: total sample\nLow model risk\nHigh model risk\nLow model\nprotection\nHigh model\nprotection\nModeraon of combined models protecon \u00d7\nmodels risk to problem behaviour\ninvolvement : female sample\nLow opport. risk\nHigh opport. risk\nLow models\ncontrol\nHigh models\ncontrol\nModeraon of combined control protecon \u00d7\nopport.risk availability to problem behaviour\ninvolvement : male sample\nFigure 1.

For example, among females, models protec-\ntion was shown to moderate the relation of models risk to the\nproblem behavior involvement, indicating that at high levels\nof model risk, adolescent females with strong levels of mod-\nels protection such as parents or friends models for conven-\ntional and healthy behavior, show less involvement in\nproblem behavior than their peers with low models protec-\ntion. Among males, control protection significantly moder-\nated the relation of opportunity risk (availability) to problem\nbehavior involvement. This indicated that at high levels of\nopportunity risk (availability), males with high levels of con-\ntrol protection show less involvement in problem behavior\nthan their peers with low levels of control protection. These\nfindings highlight the importance of socialization, and have\nimportant impacts on preparing intervention programs to\nreduce problem behavior involvement among Egyptian\nyouth in contexts of high risk.\nThe present study has several strengths. First, it provides\nan extension to previous studies that have explored the appli-\ncability of Jessor's PBT across different settings in low and\nmiddle income countries and is unique in testing the PBT in\na lower middle income Arabic country. Second, it has impor-\ntant implications for understanding gender differences in\nproblem behavior involvement among Egyptian adolescents.\nThird, the use of the psychosocial protective factors, psycho-\nsocial risk factors, and behavior measures based on PBT and\ndeveloped by Jessor et al. (2003) as well as the large sample\nsize adds to the reliability of the results.\nDespite these strengths, the findings of the present\nresearch are limited in several ways. First, although the sam-\nple was obtained from different schools in urban (Alexandria)\nand rural (Shebeen El-Koom) settings, the extent to which\nsimilar findings would be observed in other Egyptian sam-\nples is unknown. Second, a need exists for longitudinal stud-\nies to examine how protective and risk factors contribute to\ndifferent problem behaviors involvement. Third, the extent\nof problem behavior may be underestimated by the reliance\non self-reports. In contrast to official reports, self-reports can\nprovide information about undetected problem behaviors;\nhowever, there are difficulties related to memory, honesty,\nand willingness to report (Feldman, Rosenthal, Mont-\nAlthough Egypt has a different culture and is a lower mid-\ndle income country, the present findings are consistent with\ndifferent cross-national studies in several ways: (a) female\nadolescents were less likely to engage in all three problem\nbehaviors in comparison with male adolescents and (b) the\npresent work indicated the usefulness of Jessor's PBT\nbeyond the United States, especially in low and middle\nincome countries. This indicates that adolescents from dif-\nferent cultures are subject to similar individual and social\nfactors that influence adolescents'problem behavior involve-\nment independent of where they are living.\n"
