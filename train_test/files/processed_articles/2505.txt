Raymo 1\nMiho Iwasawa 2\nLarry Bumpass 1\n Introduction\nOver the past 30-40 years, substantial changes in family behavior and organization of\nthe life course have occurred in all industrialized countries. Often characterized as the\n\"second demographic transition,\" these changes include: (a) delayed marriage and\nfertility, (b) increasing cohabitation, divorce, and non-marital childbearing, and (c)\nexplanations for these changes have focused on increasing economic opportunities for\nwomen, increasing consumption aspirations, declining economic prospects for men, as\nwell as increasing secularization and growing emphasis on individual fulfillment\n(Lesthaeghe 1998). Key empirical features of these family changes include substantial\nsocioeconomic and regional variation. For example, in her recent presidential address\nto the Population Association of America, Sara McLanahan (2004) argued that patterns\nof family change are following two different paths depending on social status. Changes\nwith favorable implications for children (e.g., later marriage, delayed childbearing,\nmaternal employment) are increasingly concentrated among women with greater\nsocioeconomic resources whereas changes associated with unfavorable outcomes for\nchildren (e.g., divorce, non-marital childbearing) are increasingly concentrated among\nwomen with fewer socioeconomic resources. Family change associated with the second\ndemographic transition thus has potentially important implications for social\nstratification in general and for growing socioeconomic differentials in the well-being\nof children in particular.\nAlthough McLanahan (2004) emphasized the similarity of socioeconomic\ndifferentials in family behavior across a wide range of western industrialized countries,\nit is also clear that there is considerable variation across countries in the pace and the\ncomparative studies, Japan stands out as one setting in which some family changes\nassociated with the second demographic transition have been particularly rapid while\nothers have been slow to emerge. A very early transition to below replacement fertility\nand a very late age at marriage place Japan at the forefront of the second demographic\ntransition. At the same time, some family patterns associated with the second\ndemographic transition, such as increases in maternal labor force participation and\ndivorce have remained less prevalent than in most other low-fertility societies (Tsuya\nand Bumpass 2004). Despite rapid socioeconomic and normative change, other\nbehaviors such as cohabitation and non-marital childbearing have been virtually absent\nThe distinctive pattern of family change in Japan likely reflects, in part, a tension\nbetween the social and economic forces of change noted above and the continued\nstrength of family forms and family values very different from those in most western\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 397\nsocieties (e.g., Mason, Tsuya, and Choe 1998). Previous studies of demographic\nchange in Japan have linked declining rates of marriage and fertility to relatively\nuniversal social and economic forces of change including increasing educational\nattainment, increasing economic opportunities for women, increasing consumption\naspirations, and more tolerant attitudes toward family behaviors such as late marriage\nTsuya and Mason 1995). Theoretical discussions of the second demographic transition\noften place considerable emphasis on the role of increasing individualistic attitudes. A\nplausible explanation for the Japanese exception with respect to the most \"deviant\"\nbehaviors is that the growth of individualism is at odds with the collectivist orientation\nof Japanese society (Atoh 2001). There is, however, some evidence that pressures may\nbe building for a transition in cohabitation and perhaps even unmarried childbearing\nIt is also clear that divorce has rapidly increased, with the crude divorce rate\nincreasing by two-thirds during the 1990s. While this change is reflected in pervasive\nattention to divorce in the popular press, demographic analyses of divorce in Japan are\nextremely limited. Indeed, existing research consists primarily of descriptions of trends\nin crude rates or age trajectories, neither of which speaks directly to the risk of divorce.\nAlmost nothing is known about the correlates of divorce in Japan, trends in\nsocioeconomic differentials in divorce, or how these differentials compare to those\nobserved in other societies. In this paper, we draw upon several sources of data to\nbegin addressing these major gaps in the literature on family change in Japan. Using\nvital statistics data, we describe divorce trajectories for marriage cohorts and construct\nsynthetic cohort estimates to assess the implications of recent rates. These estimates\nprovide a clear picture of the extent to which divorce has increased over time and allow\nfor comparisons with other industrialized countries. Using census data, we examine\neducational differentials in the prevalence of divorce and describe how these\ndifferentials have changed over time. Results of these analyses enable us to assess the\nextent to which the increasing socioeconomic differentials in divorce found in other\nlow-fertility societies (McLanahan 2004) are also observed in Japan. Our results raise\nseveral questions regarding the implications of rising divorce rates for social\nstratification and the well-being of children and divorced parents in Japan. Importantly,\nthis study also provides a solid empirical basis for subsequent research addressing these\nquestions we raise. Before presenting our results, we provide a brief background on\nfamily change in Japan and existing scholarship on divorce.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\n398 http://www.demographic-research.org\n2. Background\nFollowing steady increases throughout the 1990s, Japan's crude divorce rate reached\n2.3 in 2002 (Figure 1). It is extremely important to recognize that, as illustrated at the\nright side of this figure, this is a level similar to most industrialized countries other than\nthe U.S. The Japanese rate is also much higher than in Italy and Spain, two European\ncountries with which Japan shares many other demographic similarities (Lesthaeghe\nand Moors 2000). As in the U.S., rapid increases in divorce suggest a major\nrestructuring of the family life course in Japan. It will be important in future research to\ncompare the consequences of divorce for women and children in Japan to those in other\nindustrialized countries. The prevalence of extended family residence (Rindfuss et al.\n2004) and the importance of family provided care (Ogawa and Retherford 1997) could\nmoderate these consequences, while the highly asymmetric gender division of labor\namong spouses (Tsuya and Mason 1995) and married women's relatively tenuous\nconsequences of divorce even more profound for women and families in Japan than in\nother high-divorce societies. The social, economic, and family environments in which\ndivorce occurs in Japan provide a valuable contrast to the U.S. and other western\ncountries for studying the correlates and consequences of divorce.\nAs a non-western society with a very different family tradition, Japan provides an\nimportant test of the generality of McLanahan's (2004) description of growing\nsocioeconomic differentials in family outcomes (Note 2). Do relatively low levels of\neconomic inequality and widely shared normative views of \"appropriate\" family\nbehavior restrain such divergence in the experience and consequences of divorce? On\nthe one hand, the homogeneity of the family life course in Japan's recent past (Brinton\n1992) leads us to expect rather limited socioeconomic differentials in divorce. These\nexpectations are strengthened by the fact that fertility reduction in the 1950s and more\nrecent trends toward later and less marriage have occurred rapidly across all social\ndocumented growing socioeconomic differentials in the experience of bridal pregnancy,\nan increasingly common pathway to family formation (Raymo and Iwasawa 2004). It is\nclear that Japanese women with lower levels of education are increasingly likely to\nmarry while pregnant relative to their more educated counterparts. Finding a similar\npattern with respect to divorce would provide further evidence of decline in the very\nhomogeneous family life course in Japan. Although the subject of increasing\nsocioeconomic inequality has been much discussed in Japan during recent years (Sat\n2000; Tachibanaki 2001), very little attention has been paid to the potential role of\ngrowing differentials in family behavior.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 399\nIndeed, there is very little academic research on divorce at all. Existing work is\nlimited to descriptions of trends in crude rates by age and sex (e.g., Koyama and\nYamamoto 2001), analyses of regional variation in crude rates (Fukurai and Alston\n1990; Uchida, Araki, and Murata 1993), and synthetic cohort analyses based on age-\nspecific divorce rates--which ignore differences in marriage duration by age (Beppu\npresumably reflects the limitations of available data. Complete marriage histories like\nthose commonly analyzed for the U.S. and Western Europe are not available in Japan\n(Note 3). This does not mean, however, that we cannot learn more from the existing\ndata.\nWe have three objectives in this paper. The first is to track the experiences over\ntime of real marriage cohorts up until the duration when they can last be observed. The\nsecond is to use the most recently available period data to make synthetic cohort\nestimates of the cumulative proportion of marriages expected to end in divorce by\nvarious durations since marriage. These two results are presented and discussed\ntogether. Finally, we take the observed proportions divorced by ages 35-39 as reported\nin the census and make adjustments for differential age at marriage by education\n(affecting differences in duration since marriage at the observed ages) in order to\napproximate educational differences in the risk of divorce.\n3. Data and methods\nThe basic data for estimating duration-specific risks are simply the number of marriages\nand divorces registered in the Japanese vital statistics system across years. Data on\nmarital dissolutions classified by the years in which marriage began and ended come\nfrom special tabulations not included in the annual volumes published by the Ministry\nof Health, Labour, and Welfare. We adjust these data as described below to reassign\nevents from their year of registration to the year in which they actually occurred. The\ndata for estimating educational differentials are census reports of the percent of ever-\nmarried women divorced at ages 35-39, combined with estimates of educational\ndifferences in duration since marriage by these ages.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\n400 http://www.demographic-research.org\n3.2 Adjustment for year of registration\nThe divorce tabulations classify all divorces registered in a given year (between 1979\nand 2002) by the year in which the marriage began and the year in which the marriage\nended. Because roughly 10% of marriages and 30% of divorces are not registered in\nthe year in which they occur (Ishikawa 1995), it is essential to measure marital duration\nusing the years in which the union began and ended rather than the years in which\nmarriage and divorce were registered. The vital statistics tabulations we use allow us to\ncalculate the number of marital dissolutions by marriage cohort and marital duration by\nsumming registered divorces in each year occurring to each marriage cohort--as\nmeasured by the years in which coresidence began and ended.\nBecause the earliest marriage cohort in the data is 1979 and the most recent year of\ndata is 2002, we can observe divorces registered up to twenty-three years after they\noccurred (Note 4). Our counts become progressively less complete for the more recent\nyears because for each succeeding year a higher proportion of the events will not yet\nhave been registered. To construct yearly counts of divorce classified by year of\nmarriage, we use the procedure described in Figure 2. We first subtract from each\nyear's registered divorces those that occurred in earlier years and add them to the\nnumber events for the year in which they occurred (which have, in turn, had late\nregistrations subtracted from them and reassigned to earlier years). The count of the\nnumber events for year t is simply the number of events registered in year t, minus\nthose that occurred n years earlier, and plus those that were registered n years after year\nt (where n ranges from 1 to 23). These additions and subtractions of divorces registered\nwith delay are represented by the bold dashed arrows in Figure 2. This creates a good\ncount of annual events until the more recent years for which we no longer observe the\nlarge majority of late registrations. However, we can take advantage of the fact that\npatterns of delayed registration have been remarkably stable over time to estimate the\nnumber of divorces that have occurred by 2002 but will be registered in 2003 and\nbeyond.\nUsing the years for which we have complete counts of events and the years in\nwhich these events were registered, we can estimate the proportion of the events\noccurring in a particular year, but that will not yet have been registered by 2002. For\nexample, to estimate a complete count of marital dissolutions occurring in 1999, we\nadjust that total for the proportion of all divorces from earlier years that were registered\nmore than three years after they occurred (Note 5). The addition of these estimated\nnumbers of divorces occurring by 2002 but registered after 2002 is represented by the\nthin dotted arrows in Figure 2. To assess the appropriateness of this procedure, we also\nworked backwards to estimate the number of duration-specific divorces registered with\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 401\na given delay in the past. In all cases, these estimates were very close to the observed\nvalues.\nWe use similar techniques to construct yearly marriage cohorts. Vital statistics\ntabulations classify all marriages registered in a given year by the year in which the\nmarriage actually occurred. As with the divorce data, we are thus able to reconstruct\nannual marriage cohorts by allocating late-registered marriages from the year in which\nthey were registered back to the year in which they occurred (Note 6). We adjust the\nsize of marriage cohorts upward by estimating marriages that have already occurred but\nhave not yet been registered using the procedure described in the previous paragraph.\nWith yearly counts of marriages and duration-specific numbers of marital dissolutions\nfor each marriage cohort, it is straightforward to calculate the cumulative duration-\nspecific proportions of each marriage cohort to experience marital dissolution.\nRearranging cohort and duration-specific dissolution probabilities as year and duration-\nspecific dissolution probabilities allows us to calculate the synthetic cohort cumulative\nprobability of marital dissolution for recent years. Because the earliest marriage cohort\nin our data is 1979, we can use observed dissolution probabilities in 2002 to calculate a\nsynthetic cohort divorce trajectory through 23 years of marriage. For the sake of\nsimplicity, we ignore mortality in these life-table calculations. This simplification is\nunlikely to affect results given the very low levels of young adult and mid-life mortality\nin Japan.\n3.3 The cumulative risk of divorce\nWe begin by creating synthetic life-table estimates of cumulative divorce by duration of\nmarriage. There are several important issues relating to these estimates. The first is\nthat we use divorce data from 2002. It is important to use the most recently available\ndata given that the crude divorce rate increased so dramatically during the 1990s--a\ndecade characterized by very low levels of economic growth, corporate restructuring,\nand increasing unemployment (Yamagami 2002).\nSecond, we improve considerably upon existing synthetic estimates by estimating\ncumulative disruption from entry into exposure to risk (marriage) rather than by age,\ni.e., we use marital duration-specific dissolution rates rather than age-specific rates.\nAge-specific divorce rates reflect two components: a) the risk of divorce by duration\nsince marriage, and b) the effects of age at marriage on the proportions married at\nspecific ages, and age differences in duration since marriage. Cumulative estimates\nbased on age are appropriate when the objective is compare life course experience by a\ngiven age--for example, differences between cohorts in the experience of divorce\nbefore age 30. To evaluate the risk of divorce, however, estimates must be based on\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\n402 http://www.demographic-research.org\nrates specific to durations since marriage. This difference between age-based and\nduration-based estimates is especially important in settings such as contemporary Japan\nwhere marriage timing has changed rapidly (Raymo 2003).\nFinally, we present data for both real and synthetic cohorts. We are not aware of\nany previous analyses of marital dissolution in Japan describing the trajectories of real\nmarriage cohorts.\n3.4 Differences by education\nRegistration forms for vital statistics do not collect information on educational\nattainment, and large sample surveys such as the Current Population Survey or the\nNational Survey of Families and Households which collect respondents' socioeconomic\ncharacteristics and marital histories are not currently available in Japan (see Note 3).\nRather than waiting for such data to become available, we believe that it is\nimportant to take advantage of existing data to learn what we can. Consequently, we\ndifferences in current marital status and to examine how these differentials have\nchanged over time. It is important to recognize, however, that examining differentials\nin current marital status to shed light on educational differentials in divorce poses two\nsignificant problems. The first is that current marital status understates the actual\namount of divorce because those who have divorced and remarried are simply classified\nas married (Note 7). We are thus forced to assume that there are no educational\ndifferentials in the likelihood of remarriage. Growing educational differentials in the\ntransition to first marriage in Japan (Raymo 2003) suggest that this assumption may be\nviolated. However, the fact that studies of remarriage in the U.S. and other\nindustrialized societies have typically not found significant educational differentials in\nremarriage (de Graaf and Kalmijn 2003), suggests that the same may be true in Japan.\nData from the Japanese National Fertility Surveys (JNFS), the only large survey\ncontaining information on both educational attainment and experience of divorce,\nsuggest that educational differentials in remarriage are not large in Japan. However,\nbecause the number of ever-divorced respondents is small for some educational groups,\nwe cannot confidently conclude from these data that educational differentials in\nremarriage are negligible. This caveat should be kept in mind when evaluating our\nresults.\nThe second problem is the one we addressed above in comparing life-table\nestimates based on duration since marriage rather than simply on age. The available\ncensus data leave us no option but to base our estimate on comparisons of the\nproportion divorced at specific ages. Because those in lower educational groups marry\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 403\nat younger ages, on average, than those in higher educational groups (Raymo 2003), the\nlength of exposure to divorce is inversely related to educational attainment. We take a\nsimple approach to addressing this problem. We first calculate age-specific mean ages\nat marriage by education, and we then weight the education-specific ever married\npopulations by the number of years between mean age at first marriage and the census\ndate. Dividing the divorced populations by these measures adjusts the prevalence of\ndivorce to reflect educational differences in age of initial exposure to the risk of\ndivorce. For each educational group at each census, we are thus able to calculate the\nnumber of currently divorced individuals for each year between initial exposure to the\nrisk of divorce and the census date.\nIn order to calculate the education-specific values of mean age at marriage used to\nweight the ever married populations in the census tabulations, we use data from the\nJapanese National Fertility Surveys. Conducted every five years by the National\nInstitute of Population and Social Security Research, these surveys provide information\non educational attainment and age at marriage for large nationally representative\nsamples of married women between the ages of 18 and 49. Measures of mean age at\n1997 JNFS. Because tabulations of marital status by educational attainment in the\ncensus are presented by five-year age group, we calculate mean age at marriage for\nsimilar age groups in each of the JNF surveys. In the analyses presented below, we\nfocus on ages 35-39 because women at these ages will have been married long enough\nfor many divorces to occur, and yet their experience represents marriages over a\nrelatively recent period.\nWe present these analyses and their results in two sections. In the first, we\nexamine trends and levels in marital dissolution and in the second, we examine\neducational differentials in the prevalence of divorce.\n4. Results\n4.1 Trends and levels\nWe describe trends in marital dissolution by examining the cumulative probability of\ndivorce for single-year marriage cohorts beginning in 1980, and a synthetic cohort\ntrajectory based on divorce rates observed in 2002. The latter spells out the\nimplications of recent increases in divorce by describing the expected cumulative\nproportion divorced at successive durations if a marriage cohort were to follow the most\nrecently observed duration-specific rates.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\n404 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 3 presents five cumulative divorce trajectories. The four solid lines\nbroken line represents the synthetic cohort dissolution trajectory calculated from\nduration-specific dissolution probabilities observed in 2002. The rapid increase in\nmarital dissolution is very clear, particularly between the 1985 and 1990 marriage\ncohorts. The proportion of marriages ending within five years is 50% higher for the\nmarriages begun in 1990. Despite the somewhat greater gap between marriages begun\nin 1985 and 1990, each successive cohort has experienced a higher proportion divorced\nat each duration since marriage. The synthetic cohort line continues this pattern with an\nincrease over the 1995 cohort and then follows a smooth trajectory in which the\nproportion divorced by 12 years is about as much higher than the 1990 cohort as the\nsuggests some attenuation in the rate of increase, but implies continuing increases in\ndivorce nonetheless. We estimate the cumulative probability of marital dissolution\nwithin 20 years of marriage to be 30%, a figure that is substantially higher than the\nlifetime probability of divorce from earlier age-based estimates (Beppu 2002; Ikenoue\nAs we argued in the introduction, Japan's markedly different family traditions\nmake comparisons with the Western experience of the second demographic transition\nextremely valuable. Figure 4 compares the proportion of marriages expected to end in\ndivorce by 20 years after marriage in Japan to those estimated for various European\ncountries by Andersson and Philipov (2001). Our results here are startling. While the\nincrease in rates of divorce in Japan is well recognized, it has gone unnoticed that Japan\nhas fully experienced this component of the \"second demographic transition.\" The risk\nof divorce for new marriages in Japan now matches the highest levels in Europe, even\nthough it is still considerably below that in the U.S. Rates are similar to those of\nGermany and Austria, slightly higher than those in Sweden and Finland, and\nsubstantially higher than those of France (30 vs. 19 percent) (Note 8).\nAlthough divorce rates decline steadily over the course of marriage, there is some\nincrease in cumulative divorce for a cohort even after the duration of 23 years that we\ncan estimate from our data. On the other hand, the cumulative proportion divorced\nincreases very little after 30 years, so the proportion divorced by 30 years is a\nreasonable indicator of the lifetime probability of divorce. We can make a rough\nestimate of this proportion, by applying the ratio of the proportion divorced by 30 years\nto the proportion divorced by 20 years duration as reported in other synthetic cohort\nstudies of divorce in the U.S. and elsewhere. The lowest of these ratios (from the U.S)\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 405\nsuggests that a third of all marriages in Japan will end in divorce by 30 years after\nmarriage. This has very substantial implications for family patterns in Japan, especially\nin light of evidence presented in the next section showing that the prevalence of divorce\nis relatively high among the less advantaged.\n4.2 Educational differentials\nIt is extremely important to understand the extent to which this rapid increase in marital\ndissolution has occurred across the socioeconomic spectrum or is increasingly\nconcentrated among certain groups. As noted above, cross-national studies of family\nchange associated with the second demographic transition indicate that divorce is\nincreasingly concentrated among the less educated (McLanahan 2004). We would\nexpect to observe a similar pattern of change in Japan to the extent that economic\nhardship is associated with marital instability and to the extent that Japanese couples\nwith more limited socioeconomic resources have been most adversely affected by the\nWe begin with tabulations of age and marital status by educational attainment for\ncategories of educational attainment: junior high school graduates, high school\ngraduates, junior college/vocational school graduates, university graduates, in school,\nand never attended school. We do not consider the last two categories given the very\nsmall numbers in each and the largely irrelevant nature of the \"in school\" category\nbeyond usual ages for schooling. In Figure 5, we present the unadjusted ratios of the\ndivorced population to the ever married population by educational attainment for 35-39\ndivorce has increased for all educational groups, especially between 1990 and 2000\ndivorced. By 2000, 15% of ever married women who did not finish high school and\n7% of high school graduates were divorced. Increases in the prevalence of divorce for\nwomen with at least a two-year college degree have been relatively small. While it is\nimportant to keep in mind that these figures substantially understate experience of\ndivorce given that roughly half of those who divorce eventually remarry, it seems clear\nthat there has been a sharp increase in educational differentials in divorce over the past\ntwo decades.\nIn Figure 6, we describe change over time in the relative prevalence of divorce\nafter adjusting for educational differences in the mean age at first marriage of 35-39\nyear old women at each census (as calculated from the Japanese National Fertility\nSurveys). This adjustment to account for earlier marriage among women in lower\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\n406 http://www.demographic-research.org\neducational groups has little impact on the patterns described by the unadjusted data.\nEducational differences in the prevalence of divorce were negligible in 1980 but\nincreased substantially over the following two decades. In 1990, there was a slight\ndivergence between women with higher education and those who completed high\nschool and a very large relative increase in the prevalence of divorce among women\nwho did not finish high school. This divergence between women with and without\nadjusted prevalence of divorced female high school graduates is 1.6 times larger than\nfor university graduates. Among women who did not complete high school, the\nprevalence of divorce is 2.8 times higher than among college graduates. Trends for\nwomen in the lowest educational category may be discounted given the increasingly\nwomen were classified as junior high school graduates. However, with high school\ngrowing educational differentials in the experience of divorce in Japan.\nThere are two issues that could possibly result in the size of these differentials\nbeing overstated. First, because age at first marriage has increased substantially\nbetween 1980 and 2000, age at divorce has also increased, thus inflating the prevalence\nof divorce (i.e., women have had less time to remarry). If this pattern of change has\ndiffered by education, our results may overstate the increase in educational differentials\nin divorce. This seems most unlikely, however, since age at first marriage has been\ndelayed most among the most highly educated women (Raymo 2003). Second, it is\npossible that educational differentials in the likelihood of remarriage following divorce\nhave increased. If highly educated women are increasingly likely to remarry soon after\ndivorce (relative to their less educated counterparts), the patterns depicted in Figure 6\nwould overstate the increase in educational differentials in divorce. We are not aware,\nhowever, of any empirical or anecdotal evidence to suggest that this is the case.\nIn sum, our adjustment for differences in age at first marriage only partially\naccounts for differences in exposure to the risk of divorce so we do not place much\nweight on the specific values presented in Figure 6. Rather, it is the general pattern of\nchange that is important. The very clear trends convince us that the growing\neducational differentials in divorce are not an artifact of the crude measurement\ntechniques necessitated by data limitations. The ratio of divorced high school graduates\nto divorced university graduates may be more or less than the 1.6 we calculate but it is\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 407\n5. Discussion\nVery little has been known about recent trends in marital dissolution in Japan. It is\nclear that crude divorce rates increased sharply during the 1990s, but the absence of\nmore informative measures of the likelihood of divorce has hidden the scale of current\nlevels. Furthermore, nothing was known about socioeconomic differentials in divorce.\nOur interest in understanding patterns of divorce in Japan is heightened by the contrast\nbetween the very homogeneous nature of the family life course in Japan and evidence\nof increasing socioeconomic differentials in family behavior in other industrialized\nsocieties. Is divorce increasingly common across socioeconomic strata, as suggested by\nthe limited socioeconomic differentials in fertility trends and changes in marriage\ntiming? Is divorce increasingly concentrated among those with fewer socioeconomic\nresources, as in other industrialized countries? In this paper, we have utilized available\ndata to describe trends in the experience of marital dissolution across the life course and\nto examine trends in educational differentials in the prevalence of divorce.\nCumulative probabilities of divorce have increased markedly across marriage\ncohorts in Japan. Indeed, our synthetic cohort estimates indicate that roughly one-third\nof Japanese marriages are expected to end in divorce. This figure is similar to that\nobserved in some western European countries and higher than the level in most. Japan\nis no longer a society characterized by low levels of marital dissolution. Rough\nestimates of educational differentials in the prevalence of divorce indicate that there has\nbeen a rapid increase over the past two decades in the extent to which divorce is\nconcentrated among those with lower levels of education. While educational\ndifferentials in the prevalence of divorce were negligible in the 1980 census, women\nwith a high school degree or less are far more likely than their more highly educated\ncounterparts to be divorced in the 2000 census.\nAs in the U.S. and most other industrialized societies, it appears that family\nchanges associated with the second demographic transition may have important\nimplications for social stratification in Japan. For example, the economic implications\nof rising divorce rates for women may be particularly pronounced in Japan where\nmarried women's attachment to the labor force is far more tenuous than in the U.S. and\nmany European countries. At the same time, however, the relatively high prevalence of\ncoresidence with parents following divorce may diminish the economic implications of\ndivorce for some Japanese women and their children (Note 10). Tabulations of\nJapanese census data and data from the National Survey of Families and Households\nindicate that the proportion of 35-39 year-old divorced women coresiding with parents\nis 25% in Japan but only 2% in the U.S. Does this pattern of post-divorce coresidence\nwith parents mitigate the economic consequences of divorce for women? Does it\ninfluence the likelihood of remarriage among divorced women? Does it ameliorate the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 11, Article 14\n408 http://www.demographic-research.org\nnegative consequences for children of growing up with a single parent (e.g.,\nMcLanahan and Sandefur 1994)? In considering these questions, attention will need to\nbe paid to the potential for even further divergence in family experience. If coresidence\nameliorates the consequences of divorce for some women and children in Japan, these\nconsequences may be very severe indeed for the majority who do not live with parents.\nIn the absence of joint custody laws, what role do divorced fathers play in the lives of\ntheir children?
