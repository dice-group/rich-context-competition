Design and Methods:\nview Survey (NHIS) and the 1999 National Nursing\nHome Survey (NNHS). The NHIS represents all\ncommunity-dwelling people living in the United\nStates, and the NNHS is representative of all nursing\nhome residents. Results: NHIS data show that there\naged 65 and older with reported confusion or mem-\nory loss, and 2.3 million elders with reported\nlimitation of activity caused by senility or dementia.\nidents aged 65 and older with a reported diagnosis\nof dementia. Implications: Estimates of the preva-\nlence of cognitive impairment that are based on\nnationally representative data are rare, because\ncomprehensively evaluating a national sample by\nusing standard, validated cognitive-impairment as-\nsessment methods is difficult and expensive, and\nbecause most national surveys are broad based and\ndesigned to cover a wide variety of topics. Crude\nmeasures of cognitive impairment, such as the pres-\nence of confusion or memory loss or limitations\ncaused by senility or dementia, that are included in\nthese multipurpose surveys may be only rough proxies\nfor clinically evaluated cognitive impairment, but they\ndo appear to produce prevalence estimates that are\nsimilar to estimates found with the use of more precise\ncase-ascertainment methods. These nationally repre-\nsentative data sets may be used to generate hypoth-\neses related to the prevalence, epidemiology, and\nhealth care utilization patterns of people with cog-\nnitive impairment that can be tested in studies using\nmore specific case-ascertainment criteria.\nKey Words: Dementia, Prevalence, Limitation of\nactivity, National surveys\nCognitive impairment is often, although not al-\nways, a precursor to dementia later in life (Leifer,\nAn accurate estimate of the number of people with\nidentifiable cognitive impairment, along with their\nhealth status, comorbid conditions, and use of health\ncare services, can provide a baseline for forecasting\nthe health care and social resources needed to care\nfor people with this increasingly common condition.\nDementia can be difficult to diagnose, particularly\nin its early stages. This imprecision in diagnosis\ntranslates into difficulty in identifying individuals\nwith clinical dementia in either person-based surveys\nor in surveys that rely on medical or administrative\nrecords. Cognitive impairment, however, is more of\na symptom than a diagnosis, and it can be determined\nby respondent report or clinical observation. Our\nanalysis addresses how the prevalence of cognitive\nimpairment can be estimated from two national\nhealth surveys, the National Health Interview Survey\n(NHIS), which was designed to track the overall\nhealth status and determinants of health status and\nhealth care of the civilian noninstitutionalized pop-\nulation, and the National Nursing Home Survey\n(NNHS) resident sample, which was designed to\ntrack changes in nursing home use, characteristics of\nnursing home residents, and nursing home facility\nAddress correspondence to Amy B.

This is one of a very few studies that\nincludes people with cognitive impairment in both\ninstitutional and community-based nationally repre-\nsentative data sets and compares results based on\ndifferent case-ascertainment methods. Although the\nmethod of identification of patients with cognitive\nimpairment differs between the surveys, when the\nsurveys are taken together, they provide a more\ncomprehensive picture of the total prevalence of\ncognitive impairment than each survey does on its\nown. More often, researchers derive prevalence\nestimates of cognitive impairment from small studies\nin which investigators screen people by using various\nassessment scales that assess various domains of\ncognition (e.g., memory, problem solving, wording\nfinding), and then apply the prevalence estimates from\nscreened respondents to population data. This raises\nquestions about the generalizability of the popula-\ntions screened (Government Accountability Office\nDesign and Methods\nData\nData for this analysis come from two nationally\nrepresentative surveys: the NHIS and the NNHS,\nresident sample, sponsored by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention's National Center\nfor Health Statistics. Because elderly people com-\nprise the large majority of patients with cognitive\nimpairment and diagnosed dementia, we include\nonly those people aged 65 and older in this analysis.\nThe NHIS monitors the health of the U.S.\npopulation through the collection and analysis of\ndata on a broad range of health topics. The NHIS is\na continuous survey of the civilian, noninstitution-\nalized population of the United States. It obtains\ninformation through in-person interviews with\nhousehold respondents and one selected adult and\none child per household. Since 1997, the sample has\nhave a sufficiently robust sample size for people with\na limitation caused by dementia, we combined data\nor older in the family component of the survey and\ncomponent.\nThe NNHS is a series of national probability\nsample surveys of nursing homes, their residents, and\ntheir staff. Data from the 1999 NNHS provide point-\nin-time estimates of residents from a sample of\npeople currently residing in nursing homes. A staff\nmember familiar with the sampled residents, re-\nferring to medical and facility records, provided\nresident data through on-site interviews. The 1999\ncurrent residents (7,383 individuals who were aged\nIdentification of Cases\nTable 1 displays how we identify people in the\ntwo surveys as having cognitive impairment. We\nderive two measures of cognitive impairment from\nthe limitation-of-activity component of the family\ncore questionnaire of the community-based NHIS\n(see Table 1).\nThe full set of limitation of activity questions\nelicits whether anyone in the household has a limi-\ntation in his or her everyday activities as a result of\na physical, mental, or emotional health problem.\nThe responses may be self-reported or reported by\nproxy from an adult household member for other\nhousehold members not present at the interview.\nRespondents are asked about limitations in activities\nof daily living, instrumental activities of daily living,\nplay, school, and work; difficulties in walking or in\nremembering; and any other activity limitations. The\nfirst NHIS measure assessed the self-report of\nlimitations caused by confusion or memory loss.\nThe second measure of cognitive impairment used\nfor NHIS participants is based on the specific con-\ndition or disease that causes activity limitations\nidentified by any of the aforementioned limitation-\nof-activity questions. When limitations are reported,\nthe causal health conditions are determined and\nrespondents are considered limited if one or more of\nthese conditions is chronic. Interviewers asked only\nthe subset of NHIS respondents who identified a\nlimitation of activity to identify the cause or condi-\ntion that caused the limitation. Interviewers then\nasked respondents what condition caused each limi-\ntation identified and recorded this condition as\n``senility'' if the respondent reported that the limi-\ntation was due to senility, Alzheimer's disease, or\nanother aging-related cognitive impairment. People\nwith a ``yes'' response to this question are included in\nthe Senility cognitive-impairment category.\nThe respondent-reported confusion or memory\nloss-measure casts a wide net and is probably an\noverestimate of the total prevalence of people who\nwould be diagnosed with dementia if they were\nclinically assessed. Conversely, the number of people\nwho report a limitation caused by senility is prob-\nably an underestimate of the total number of\ncommunity-dwelling elderly persons who could be\ndiagnosed with dementia if they were assessed by\na clinician, because it excludes many people in the\nearly stages of dementia who do not yet have\na reported dementia-related limitation of activity.\nAmong older people with a limitation caused by\nsenility (NHIS Measure 2), 87% also reported\na limitation caused by confusion or memory loss,\nand approximately 30% of the people who reported\nconfusion or memory loss (NHIS Measure 1) also\nreported a limitation caused by senility.\nWe considered cognitive impairment or dementia\nto be present in persons in the NNHS on the basis of\nwhether they had a diagnosis of dementia recorded on\nthe medical record or reported to the NNHS inter-\nviewer by a knowledgeable staff person. Up to six\nconditions could be recorded for nursing home res-\nidents; which were coded to the appropriate ICD-9-\nCM diagnostic dementia codes (i.e., those listed by the\nInternational Statistical Classification of Diseases,\nninth revision, clinical modification; see Table 1).\nAll differences noted in this paper are statistically\nsignificant at the p , .05 level and are tested by use\nof the two-tailed z test. We computed estimates of\nstandard errors by using SUDAAN software, which\ntakes into account the complex survey designs of\nboth the NHIS and the NHHS (more detail about\nall of the NCHS surveys, including downloadable\npublications, can be found on the NCHS website at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs).\nResults\nUsing the NHIS Confusion or Memory loss- mea-\nsure of cognitive impairment, we found that, on aver-\nage, approximately 2.3 million community-dwelling\npeople aged 65 and older had cognitive impairment\nat the time of the survey during the 3-year period\nSenility measure, however, we found that the esti-\nmated number of community-dwelling elderly people\nAlthough only 4% of noninstitutionalized people\naged 65 to 74 years had confusion or memory loss,\nthis increased to 9% for people aged 75 to 84 years\nand to almost 20% of people aged 85 and older. Less\nthan 1% of noninstitutionalized people aged 65 to 74\nyears reported a limitation caused by senility,\ncompared with 9% of people aged 85 and older.\nand older had a dementia diagnosis at the time of the\nsurvey in 1999. For nursing home residents, the\nprevalence of diagnosed dementia was similar to that\nolder (approximately 43% to 45%), but this rate was\nconsiderably higher than the rate for people aged 65\nDiscussion\nThis analysis shows that it is possible to make esti-\nmates of cognitive impairment from general-purpose\nhealth surveys that do not specifically set out to assess\ncognitive impairment. It also shows that these\nTable 1.

For example, a meta-analysis\nproduced by the GAO estimated that approximately\n5.7% of the people aged 65 years had any Alzheimer's\ndisease dementia--not including other types of\nAlzheimer's disease (GAO). In a study using nation-\nally representative data, Suthers and colleagues found\na cognitive-impairment prevalence rate of 5.5% to\n6.5% for people aged 70 and older who were living in\nthe community and a rate of approximately 50%\namong institutionalized elders aged 70 and older\n(Suthers et al., 2003). These researchers used two out\nof seven symptoms related to cognitive impairment as\ntheir classification criteria, which is considerably\nmore stringent than the single question or item that\nwe used for the three measures of cognitive impair-\nment presented in this analysis.\nOur study is subject to several limitations. Surveil-\nlance for cognitive impairment typically uses assess-\nment scales that assess various domains of cognition\n(e.g., memory, problem solving, and word finding; see\nRosenberg, Johnston, & Lyketsos, 2006); therefore,\nthe use of a single item is a crude or imprecise method\nto ascertain cognitive impairment. Second, people\nwith cognitive impairment in the NHIS are classified\non the basis of self-report or proxy report, and\nprevalence may be underreported because of possible\nstigma or embarrassment. Cognitive impairment in\nthe nursing home sample is determined by staff\nmembers who refer to sampled residents' medical\nrecords, and this too is subject to misreporting or\nunderreporting. Cognitive impairment is a complex\ncondition, and researchers cannot make a definitive\ndetermination of it on the basis of one question about\ncognition or limitation of activity. Further analyses\ncomparing results from these questions with other\nvalidated measures would have to be conducted.\nWithout further validation, results using the NHIS\nmeasures would have to be interpreted with caution\nand replicated with additional studies. Our analysis\nalso does not include any data on cognitive impair-\nment within the small (but increasing) number of\npeople living in alternative long-term-care residential\nsettings, such as assisted living facilities, who are not\nincluded in either household surveys of noninstitu-\ntionalized persons (such as the NHIS) or surveys of\npersons in institutional settings (such as the NNHS).\nHowever, the fact that results based on these simple\nmeasures are consistent with other studies using more\ndetailed measures means that researchers may be able\nto use these national studies to generate hypotheses\nrelated to the prevalence and determinants of\ncognitive impairment, comorbid conditions, or health\ncare utilization of people with cognitive impairment\nthat can be tested in studies with more specific\ncognitive-impairment case-ascertainment criteria. It\nis our hope that the NHIS and the NNHS, which\ninclude these indicators of cognitive impairment but\nTable 2.
