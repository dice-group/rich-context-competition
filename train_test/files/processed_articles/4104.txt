    "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose. Dyspnea is a common and distressing symptom for patients with lung cancer (LC) because of disease burden,\ntherapy toxicity, and comorbid illnesses. Acupuncture is a centuries-old therapy with biological plausibility for relief of\ndyspnea in this setting. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of acupuncture for\ndyspnea among patients with LC. Methods. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of LC and clinically significant dyspnea without\na clear organic cause. The treatment consisted of 10 weekly acupuncture sessions, with a follow-up visit 4 weeks after\ntherapy. The primary outcome was dyspnea severity as measured using a validated Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of 0 to\n10 (10 being \"most severe shortness of breath imaginable\"). Results. We enrolled 12 patients in the study. The median age\nable to complete all 10 acupuncture sessions. Acupuncture was well tolerated; adverse events were mild and self-limited.\nMean (SD) dyspnea scores on the NRS improved from 6.3 (1.7) at baseline to 3.6 (1.9; P = .003) at the end of treatment and\n3.2 (2.3; P = .008) at follow-up. Fatigue and quality of life also improved significantly with acupuncture (P < .05). Conclusion.\nAmong patients with LC, acupuncture was well tolerated and exhibited promising preliminary beneficial effects in the\ntreatment of dyspnea, fatigue, and quality of life. Performing a trial in this population appears feasible.\n",

Multiple studies have shown\nacupuncture to be safe when administered by trained practi-\ntioners.11-13 A recent systematic review has revealed signifi-\ncant efficacy of acupuncture for a variety of cancer-related\nsymptoms.14 Although the exact mechanism of action for\nacupuncture is not fully understood, recent animal and\nhuman studies have demonstrated an effect that is mediated\nin part by endogenous opioid release.15,16 These molecules\nbind the same opioid receptors engaged by synthetic opi-\noids currently used for dyspnea treatment.

The\namount of acupuncture administered was substandard, and\nthe study combined acupuncture with acupressure.20 To\nevaluate the potential role of traditional acupuncture for the\ntreatment of dyspnea in LC in a formal manner, we per-\nformed a pilot study. The specific aims of this study were\n(1) to evaluate the feasibility of accruing patients with LC\nto a trial of acupuncture and (2) to estimate preliminary\neffect size and safety of the intervention.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Patient Population\nWe recruited eligible patients from the thoracic oncology\nclinics at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of\nPennsylvania. Patients 18 years and older were eligible if\nthey had a diagnosis of LC, a dyspnea severity score of at\nbeing most severe shortness of breath imaginable), an\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status\nof 1 to 3 and could provide informed consent and complete\nstudy surveys in English. Key exclusion criteria included\nlife expectancy of less than 12 weeks as assessed by the\ntreating oncologist, an organic cause of dyspnea requiring\nimmediate treatment (eg, pleural effusion, acute radiation\npneumonitis as measured by treatment with steroids for less\nthan 3 weeks, acutely progressive disease, or severe ane-\nmia), or a current bleeding disorder. Informed consent was\nobtained from all patients prior to participation. This study\nreceived approval from the institutional review board at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.\nStudy Intervention\nThe acupuncture treatment regimen was semistandardized,\nwhich has been an effective approach in prior studies of\nacupuncture.21 The acupuncture points were chosen based on\na review of the literature and were further informed by a team\nof licensed acupuncturists, a palliative care physician, and an\noncologist with knowledge of LC treatment. The primary acu-\npuncture points were chosen to improve dyspnea, but addi-\ntional points were presented as optional in the case of a\nparticular symptom (see Supplemental Table 1 [available at\nhttp://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental] for acupuncture points\nSeirin-America Inc, Weymouth, MA) were inserted until the\npatient reported a sensation of soreness (termed De Qi).\nTreatments occurred in 2 stages. Patients were first seated in\na comfortable chair in the chemotherapy infusion suite to\nallow the placement of anterior needles. These needles\nremained in place for 15 to 20 minutes and were then\nremoved. Patients were then placed face down in a massage\nchair for the placement of posterior needles. These needles\nwere also kept in place for 15 to 20 minutes and then removed.\nNo stimulation of the acupuncture needles was utilized.\nPatients received weekly treatments for 10 weeks and had a\nfollow-up visit 4 weeks after the end of treatment. This dose\nof acupuncture has been effective in prior trials.22 Two\nlicensed acupuncturists, each with greater than 10 years of\nexperience, administered the acupuncture.\nData Collection and Outcome Measurement\nPatient-reported outcome instruments were utilized to\nobtain information on symptom severity. Patients com-\npleted surveys at baseline, at the end of treatment, and at a\nfollow-up visit 4 weeks after treatment completion.\nThe primary outcome of the study was dyspnea severity\nin the past 7 days, as measured by a Dyspnea NRS. Scores\non the NRS ranged from 0 (no shortness of breath) to 10\n(most severe shortness of breath imaginable). NRSs have\nbeen used extensively in the measurement of dyspnea and\nare responsive to change.23\nGiven the limitations of unidimensional measurement of\na complex symptom such as dyspnea,23 we also used a mul-\ntidimensional instrument. The Cancer Dyspnea Scale (CDS)\nwas originally written and validated in Japan to assess the\neffort, anxiety, and discomfort associated with dyspnea24\nand has since been validated in English.25 The CDS is struc-\ntured around 3 domains: sense of discomfort, sense of anxi-\nety, and sense of effort. Scores range from 0 to 49, and a\nhigher score indicates more severe dyspnea. The CDS is the\nonly multidimensional dyspnea assessment tool that is vali-\ndated in cancer patients, but it has never been used in a clini-\ncal trial. Thus, we did not know its sensitivity to change and\nchose to use the CDS as a secondary outcome measure.\nPatients with LC often describe their dyspnea as a feel-\ning of fatigue,26 so we also measured fatigue with the Brief\nFatigue Inventory (BFI).27 The BFI is a validated instrument\nfor the assessment of fatigue among patients with cancer. We\nalso measured global quality of life using the Functional\nAssessment of Cancer Therapy\u00adLung version (FACT-L).28\nEach of these validated instruments was utilized at baseline,\nat the end of treatment, and at the follow-up visit.\nTo monitor objective findings related to dyspnea sever-\nity, we performed spirometry and lung volume measure-\nments in the pulmonary function laboratory at the University\nof Pennsylvania at baseline and at the end of treatment. In\naddition, patients completed a 6-minute walk test, which\nhas been validated as a prognostic marker in patients with\nTo define the patient's impression of their dyspnea\nimprovement with acupuncture, we administered the Patient\nGlobal Impression of Change instrument30 weekly through-\nout therapy.\nSample Size Calculation and Statistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed in STATA (STATA\nv12.1, College Station, TX). For our primary outcome, we\nused a paired, 2-sided t test to compare the dyspnea severity\nas measured by NRS at baseline with the score at the end of\ntreatment. Significance was defined at .05. Based on prior\nstudies, the SD of a NRS measuring dyspnea among patients\nwith LC is 2.1.23 We hypothesized that if acupuncture could\ncause an effect size of 1 SD reduction in dyspnea, we would\nneed 10 individuals to have 80% power to detect such dif-\nference, using a 2-sided significance level of .05. We chose\na 12-subject sample size to account for an expected loss to\nfollow-up rate of 15%.\nTo better characterize the effect of acupuncture among\npatients with LC, we performed a series of paired t tests to\ncompare objective pulmonary measurements and symptom\nseverity at the end of treatment and at the follow-up visit\nwith baseline measurements. All tests were 2-sided, and a\nsignificance level of .05 was used. Given our small sample\nsize, these evaluations should be regarded as exploratory.\nResults\nParticipant Characteristics\nWe screened 17 patients to identify the 12 patients who\nenrolled in our study (see Figure 1). The median age of\nenrolled patients was 64.5 years, with a SD of 10 years, and\n66.7% of patients were female. The racial breakdown of\nenrolled patients included 66.7% Caucasians, 25% African\nAmericans, and 8.3% Asian Americans. Prior treatment\nincluded surgery (25%), radiation therapy (58.3%), and\nchemotherapy (75%); 33.3% of patients had recurrent/met-\nastatic disease and were receiving active treatment (see\nTable 1). Of note, all patients who received radiation ther-\napy also received concurrent chemotherapy.\nFeasibility and Safety\nIn this study, 83.3% of patients were able to receive all\nscheduled acupuncture treatments, with only 2 patients\nunable to attend all sessions. One patient withdrew from the\nstudy because of a long commute to the center, and another\nhad progression of LC while on the study and was unable to\nparticipate further because of illness. A third patient had\nprogression of disease after the final acupuncture appoint-\nment and was unable to attend the follow-up visit. All\npatients who completed at least 1 acupuncture session were\nincluded in the final analysis.\nDespite the use of chest wall acupuncture points in a\npopulation with a high incidence of emphysema, no patient\nexperienced a pneumothorax. There were no attributable\nadverse events of grade 2 or higher seen in this study.\nThere were 3 possibly related or related adverse events\nnoted during >100 acupuncture sessions. There were 2\npatients who experienced mild redness/bruising near a nee-\ndle site, and 1 patient experienced a minor exacerbation of\nchronic back pain. All adverse events were mild and\nresolved without intervention.\nImprovement in Dyspnea\nMean dyspnea severity (SD) on the NRS was 6.3 (1.7) at\nfollow-up. There was a statistically significant difference\nbetween both later time points and baseline (P = .003 and\n.008, respectively). There was a 49% reduction in dys-\npnea severity from baseline to follow-up. This was a clin-\nically significant effect size, correlating with a Cohen's d\nScores on the CDS also improved from 12.3 (6.8) at base-\nfollow-up. This was also a statistically significant differ-\nence (P = .04 for both comparisons). There was a numeri-\ncal improvement in all subscales of the CDS at the end of\ntreatment and at follow-up (see Table 2). At the end of\ntreatment, 60% of patients reported that their dyspnea\nwas at least somewhat better, and at the follow-up\nvisit, 77.8% of patients reported at least some improve-\nment in dyspnea. No patient experienced worsening of\ndyspnea.\nImprovement in Related Symptoms\nOverall, participants experienced an improvement in fatigue\nand global quality of life at the end of treatment. The effect\non fatigue maintained statistical significance at the follow-\nup visit (see Table 2). No statistically significant changes\nwere seen in pulmonary function testing or in 6-Minute\nWalking Distance (see Table 3).\nFigure 1.

In this pilot study, we\ndemonstrated successful recruitment and retention to a\nstudy of acupuncture for dyspnea in LC. There was a statis-\ntically and clinically significant improvement in dyspnea,\nas measured with both the NRS and CDS. At the time of\nfollow-up, nearly 80% of patients reported some improve-\nment in their dyspnea. Acupuncture was well tolerated, and\nthere were no episodes of pneumothorax despite a signifi-\ncant rate of emphysema among patients with LC. In addi-\ntion to improving dyspnea, acupuncture was also associated\nwith improved fatigue and quality of life.\nAlthough dyspnea is a debilitating symptom, with even\nmild symptoms leading to significant interruption of normal\nactivities of daily living,26 currently available therapies are\ninadequate. The current standard of care for dyspnea among\npatients with advanced cancer is low-dose opioids, which\nare associated with significant side effects.9 Our study\nrevealed an effect size for acupuncture that was similar to\nthat previously reported for opioids,31,32 with an improved\nside effect profile for acupuncture. This observation needs\nto be confirmed in a larger, randomized study.\nDyspnea has previously shown a strong correlation with\nquality of life and fatigue.33,34 Indeed, for some patients\nwith LC, fatigue and dyspnea represent the same clinical\nentity.26 Thus, the effect seen in our study on quality of life\nand fatigue is not surprising. Interestingly, subjective dys-\npnea severity has historically exhibited poor correlation\nwith expected objective factors predicting degraded lung\nfunction. For instance, dyspnea severity is not associated\nwith the extent of LC surgery, and its correlation with pul-\nmonary function tests has been inconsistent.5,35 Therefore, it\nis not surprising that we were able to see an improvement in\ndyspnea severity without a change in objective pulmonary\nmeasurements. It should be noted, however, that all objec-\ntive measurements exhibited a numerical improvement.\nPrior studies of acupuncture for other lung diseases have\nshown improvement in pulmonary function test measure-\nments.36,37 Our pilot study was not adequately powered to\ndetect a significant improvement.\nThis study has a number of important limitations. First,\nthe lack of a control group makes it impossible to rule out\nthe possibility of a placebo effect or symptomatic improve-\nment independent of the intervention itself. Whereas prior\nstudies have raised the concern of a placebo response to\nacupuncture,38 this seems to be mostly limited to sham acu-\npuncture. Prior work by our group has indicated that\nresponse expectancy, a key component of the placebo effect,\nis not a predictor of response to true acupuncture.39 Although\nwe cannot exclude symptomatic improvement independent\nof the intervention, dyspnea and other symptoms generally\nworsen over time among patients with LC.2,40 The presence\nof a significant improvement in dyspnea is, thus, notable.\nNext, our population was relatively heterogeneous, includ-\ning patients with cured and active cancer who had received\na variety of prior treatments. For instance, some patients\nbecame quite ill related to their disease and were unable to\ncomplete follow-up. Although this is certainly a limitation,\nit may reflect a more \"real-world\" application of acupunc-\nture for dyspnea and would be expected to bias our study\ntoward the null. Finally, our sample size in this pilot trial\nwas small, which, when combined with the heterogeneous\npopulation, may limit generalizability of our findings. Our\nfindings should be confirmed in a larger, randomized study.\nIn spite of these limitations, our study has notable\nstrengths. Dyspnea is a major cause of symptomatic distress\nfor patients with LC,4,8 and currently available therapies for\nits treatment are inadequate and can have significant toxici-\nties (eg, opioids).9 Acupuncture was well tolerated by a\ngroup of patients with LC, and performing a trial in this\npopulation was feasible. This was the first trial to use the\nCDS in the context of a clinical trial, and it seemed to be\nresponsive to change. In conclusion, acupuncture exhibited\npromising preliminary effects in the treatment of dyspnea.\nThis benefit needs to be confirmed in a larger, randomized\ncontrolled study.\n"
