Cadmium is a widespread environmental pollutant that accu-\nmulates in the pancreas and exerts diabetogenic effects in animals. To test the hypothesis that\nexposure to cadmium is associated with impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes, we\nexamined the associations between urinary cadmium and the prevalence of impaired fasting\nglucose (prediabetes) and diabetes in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III).\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data on 8,722 adults 40 years\nof age from the NHANES III (1988\u00ad1994), a cross-sectional health survey of a nationally\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population. We studied urinary\nlevels of cadmium (adjusted for urine creatinine) in relation to the prevalence of impaired fasting\nglucose and diabetes, using the criteria of the American Diabetes Association.\nRESULTS -- After adjustment for age, ethnicity, sex, and BMI, the odds of impaired fasting\nglucose and diabetes increased dose-dependently with elevations in urinary cadmium from\nCONCLUSIONS -- In this large cross-sectional study, urinary cadmium levels are signifi-\ncantly and dose-dependently associated with both impaired fasting glucose and diabetes. These\nfindings, which require confirmation in prospective studies, suggest that cadmium may cause\nprediabetes and diabetes in humans.\nIncreasing rates of type 2 diabetes in the\nU.S. and worldwide suggest that diabe-\ntes may be caused by environmental\nfactors (1). For example, epidemiologic\nstudies have implicated arsenic as a pos-\nsible cause of type 2 diabetes, and a role\nfor other environmental toxins is strongly\nsuspected (2). Recently, we reviewed ev-\nidence indicating that exposure to the\nheavy metal cadmium is a cause of pan-\ncreatic cancer (3). Because pancreatic\ncancer and type 2 diabetes are known to\nbe associated (4), we wondered if type 2\ndiabetes is also associated with cadmium.\nCadmium is an environmental pollut-\nant with a biological half-life in the whole\nbody exceeding 10 years. Cadmium levels\nin the body accumulate with age, as only a\nminute part of the body burden (0.01\u00ad\n0.02%) is excreted per day. The urinary\nexcretion of cadmium is proportional to\nthe body burden and is widely used as a\ndosimeter of lifetime exposure (5,6). We\nused the publicly available data collected\nin the Third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III)\nto examine the associations between uri-\nnary cadmium and impaired fasting glu-\ncose and diabetes.\nMETHODS -- The National Center\nfor Health Statistics of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention conducted\nnoninstitutionalized U.S. civilians aged 2\nmonths and older (7,8). Information on\ndemographic characteristics, ethnicity,\nand medical history of diabetes was ob-\ntained in a household interview. Informa-\ntion on history of diabetes included\nquestions about prior diagnoses of diabe-\ntes by a physician and current use of in-\nsulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. In\naddition, women were asked whether the\ndiagnosis had been made during preg-\nnancy and whether they had been diag-\nnosed with diabetes at some time other\nthan pregnancy. Blood and urine speci-\nmens were obtained during physical ex-\namination. Urine was collected as a \"spot\"\nor untimed sample. Studies of timed urine\nspecimens indicate that urinary cadmium\nlevels do not show significant diurnal\nvariation (9) and that urinary cadmium in\nspot specimens is well correlated with uri-\nPlasma glucose, measured using a\nmodified hexokinase enzymatic method\n(8), was used to classify participants un-\nder the headings \"normal,\" \"impaired\nfasting glucose,\" and \"diabetes.\" Subjects\nwith serum cotinine 10 ng/ml and who\nreported smoking fewer than 100 ciga-\nrettes in their lifetimes were classified as\nnonsmokers; otherwise, subjects were\nclassified as ever-smokers. Serum cotin-\nine was measured using high-perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography coupled\nwith an atmospheric pressure chemical\nionization tandem mass spectrometer\n(11). Urine cadmium was measured by\nZeeman effect graphite furnace atomic ab-\nsorption (12), and urine microalbumin\n                                                \nFrom the 1Departments of Cancer Biology and Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest University School of\nMedicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the 2Department of Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest Uni-\nversity School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and the 3Department of Biostatistics, University\nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Gary G.

To adjust for\nvariation in the diluteness of urine, uri-\nnary cadmium levels were expressed as\nurine cadmium/urine creatinine (g/g).\nDetails regarding the laboratory proce-\ndures for these tests are published else-\nwhere (8).\nSubjects were categorized as having\nimpaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabe-\ntes based on fasting (8- to 24-h) plasma\nglucose (FPG) levels in accordance with\nthe criteria of the American Diabetes As-\nFPG  126 mg/dl; diabetes was defined\nas FPG 126 mg/dl and/or current use of\ninsulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.\nWe restricted the analysis to adults 40\nyears of age and older to exclude cases of\ntype 1 diabetes, which is etiologically dis-\ntinct from type 2 diabetes. After excluding\nthose with missing values, we analyzed\nthere were complete records. We quanti-\nfied the associations between urinary cad-\nmium and IFG, diabetes, and the\ncombined outcomes (IFG  diabetes) by\nestimating odds ratios (ORs) and calculat-\ning 95% CIs by logistic regression. The\ncadmium concentration in urine was cat-\negorized in three levels: 0\u00ad0.99 (refer-\ng/g creatinine (exposure level II). Expo-\nsure levels I and II were modeled as two\nindicator variables. The ORs were ad-\njusted for age, race, sex, and BMI. The\nrelationship between urinary cadmium\n(g/g creatinine) and smoking (ever-\nsmokers versus nonsmokers) was exam-\nined using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney\ntest.\nRESULTS -- The prevalence of IFG,\ndiabetes, and the combined outcomes\n(IFG  diabetes) were positively associ-\nated with urinary cadmium in a dose-\ndependent manner (Table 1). The odds of\nthe combined outcomes increased by\n30% at each level of urinary cadmium.\nThe magnitudes of these associations\nwere slightly higher for IFG than for dia-\nbetes. Similar effects were observed when\nurinary cadmium was modeled as a con-\ntinuous variable; the ORs associated with\nan increase of 1 g/g creatinine were 1.19\nrespectively.\nBecause cadmium is known to exac-\nerbate renal damage in diabetes (15), re-\nnal damage could cause cadmium to leak\ninto urine, leading to a (noncausal) asso-\nciation between cadmium and diabetes.\nWe therefore restricted the analysis to\npersons without laboratory evidence of\nrenal damage, using a standard cut-point\nof urine albumin, 30 g/ml, as de-\nscribed by Paschal et al. (6). This restric-\ntion did not appreciably affect our\nfindings (Table 2). Thus, the higher levels\nof cadmium in the urine of persons with\nIFG and diabetes do not appear to be the\nresult of renal impairment.\nApart from occupational exposure to\ncadmium (which should be rare in this\ncohort), the major source of cadmium ex-\nposure among nonsmokers is the diet\n(16). Among smokers, the major source\nof cadmium exposure is cigarettes. As has\nbeen observed repeatedly (6,16), urinary\ncadmium levels were significantly higher\namong ever-smokers: the mean levels of\ng/g creatinine (ever-smokers versus\nthe prevalence of the combined outcomes\n(IFG  diabetes) in ever-smokers and\nnonsmokers. Despite small variations in\neffect size at the different levels of expo-\nsure, the associations were apparent in\nboth groups (Table 3). Thus, regardless of\nthe source of exposure, diet or cigarettes,\nhigher levels of cadmium in urine were\nassociated with increases in the odds of\nIFG and diabetes. Finally, we tested the\nassociation between smoking and the\ncombined outcomes: the OR adjusted for\nCONCLUSIONS -- To our knowl-\nedge, this is the first report of an associa-\ntion between cadmium exposure and\nboth IFG and type 2 diabetes. Because this\nTable 1--Association of urinary cadmium with the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and diabetes among subjects 40 years of age and older\nExposure\nlevel\nUrinary cadmium\n(g/g creatinine)\nNormal\n(n)\nIFG Diabetes IFG  diabetes\nExposure levels I and II were modeled as two indicator variables.

A prospective\nstudy, in which cadmium levels are deter-\nmined before the development of disease,\nwill be required to establish a causal basis\nfor these associations.\n"
