One study, a random digit dialing survey\nin Seattle, compared the sexual behavior of MSM from 2003\nto 2006 and found a significant decrease in median number of\nsex partners in the past year over time and no change in\nunprotected anal intercourse.10 However, given the wide-\nspread increases in HIV and P&S syphilis in the United\nStates, national data on temporal trends in the sexual behav-\niors of MSM are needed. To date, there has been a lack of\ndata from national population-based surveys that include\nMSM. The purpose of this study was to examine nationally\nrepresentative data on sexually active MSM to determine if\nbehaviors changed recently while P&S syphilis and HIV\nincreased among MSM.\nMETHODS\nSurvey of Family Growth (NSFG). NSFG is a multistage\nnational probability sample of 15\u00ad44 year olds living in US\nhouseholds, with over-samples of 15\u00ad24 year olds, blacks,\nand Hispanics. Detailed information on the survey design\nand sampling procedures has been previously described11,12;\nhowever, in 2006, NSFG switched from periodic administra-\ntion (ie, conducting the survey every 3\u00ad7 years) to continuous\nadministration (ie, conducting interviews from June 2006 to\nJune 2010). The same primary sampling units were used in\nrisk included in this analysis were collected via audio com-\nputer assisted self-interview.\nWe used SAS-callable SUDAAN (release 10.0,\nResearch Triangle Institute, Durham, NC) for analyses, to\naccount for the complex sampling procedures used by NSFG,\nand data were weighted for nonresponse. For men who\nreported one or more male anal and/or oral sex partners in the\n12 months before interview (referred to as \"sexually active\nMSM\"), we used t tests to compare mean number of male sex\nFrom the Division of STD Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, Atlanta, GA.\nThis research was supported in part by an appointment to the Research\nParticipation Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education\nthrough an interagency agreement between the US Department of Energy\nand CDC.\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not\nnecessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\nPresented in part at the National STD Prevention Conference, March 13,\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\nCorrespondence to: Jami S.

Additionally, we used x2 tests to compare re-\nported sexual risk behaviors [specific sexually transmitted\ndisease (STD)/HIV risk behaviors, including those with male\npartners], sex with female partners, and STD/HIV testing\nacross time.\nRESULTS\nThe percentage of men who reported having a male sex\npartner in the past 12 months did not differ across time with\n2.7% (n = 197) of all men categorized as sexually active\n(P = 0.103); thus, there were an estimated population total\nthe United States during the survey years (Table 1). Among\nall sexually active MSM, there was a significant decrease\nacross time in the reported number of male partners in the\nidentified among sexually active 15- to 24-year old MSM\nthere was a nonsignificant decreasing trend for 35\u00ad44 year olds\n(P = 0.072). Also, there were no significant differences in the\naverage number of male partners reported by any racial or\nethnic group (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic\nblack) across time.\nWe found significant decreases in number of male\npartners in the past 12 months for some subpopulations.\nSpecifically, sexually active MSM with an income less than\n150% of the federal poverty level reported a mean of 3.0 male\npartners in 2002 significantly decreasing to 2.1 male partners in\ndecreased for sexually active MSM with some college experi-\nthose living in a metropolitan statistical area, other than a central\nwere no changes over time for the remaining subpopulations by\nincome, education, or residence.\nTABLE 1.

Specifically, there was no\nsignificant difference across time in sexually active MSM who\nreported spending time in jail, not using a condom at last sex,\ninjection drug use (IDU) and/or sex with a male IDU, or sex\nwith an HIV-infected male (Table 2).

Specifically, adolescent and young adult\nMSM did not report a higher number of male partners than\nother adult MSM. Additionally, sexually active black and His-\npanic MSM did not report more partners than their white coun-\nthan whites although the difference was not statistically signif-\nicant. These findings suggest that factors other than an individ-\nual's sexual behavior should also be examined in relation to the\nincreases in HIV and P&S syphilis.\nIt is possible that sexual network factors are associated\nwith the increases in HIV and P&S syphilis. Partner-level\nfactors such as sexual risk, a lack of awareness of HIV infec-\ntion, and less access to HIV care have been associated with\ndisparities in HIV infection among MSM. One study found\nthat black MSM had higher reports of same-race partners and\npartners who were significantly older than MSM of other\nblack MSM who were HIV-positive but not aware of their\ninfection were more likely to believe that having sex with\na same-race partner (ie, assortative mixing) lowered their\nHIV risk.18 A 2008 study that included multiple partner-level\nfactors found that having a partner with an unknown HIV\nstatus was associated with HIV and was more commonly\nreported by black than white MSM.19 Furthermore, black\nmen were estimated to have the highest number of unidenti-\nfied HIV infections,20 and studies have found that minority\nMSM (black, Hispanic, mixed race) were more likely to be\nunaware of their HIV infection.21\u00ad23 Additionally, access to\nantiretroviral therapy which has been associated with reduced\nHIV transmission24 is lower among black MSM.25 Finally, it\nis possible that STD/HIV prevalence within the partner pool\nare related to the increases in P&S syphilis and HIV, as young\nand minority MSM have higher rates of HIV and STD. Thus,\nsexual network factors, including partner risk and underlying\ndisease prevalence, may contribute to a higher risk of acquir-\ning HIV and syphilis.4,5\nThere are limitations to this study. The same-sex\nmeasures included in NSFG through 2010 were limited;\ntherefore, we could not examine the number of unprotected\nanal intercourse partners, partner characteristics (eg, type,\nage, or race of partner), or whether MSM had partners who\nwere nonmonogamous. Also, 2002 NSFG did not assess the\nuse of crystal methamphetamines. NSFG relies on self-\nreported data, so the potential nonreporting of same-sex\nbehaviors exists; however, the use of audio computer assisted\nself-interview minimizes the chance that disclosure of same-\nsex sexual behaviors would have changed over time. It is\npossible that behavioral trends influence morbidity trends\nwith a time lag that was not possible to assess given available\nsurvey years. Finally, it is possible that household surveys\nmay underestimate the riskiest MSM populations (eg, core\ngroups); therefore, findings may be most useful in combina-\ntion with venue-based26 and convenience samples.\nData on MSM from national probability samples may be\nuseful for STD/HIV prevention, particularly aiding in the\nidentification of larger patterns of risk. Our findings suggest\nthe need to also consider issues in addition to sexual behavior,\nsuch as sexual networks and disease prevalence in the sexual\nnetwork, to better identify the factors associated with the\nobserved increases in syphilis/HIV in young and minority MSM.\nREFERENCES\n1.
