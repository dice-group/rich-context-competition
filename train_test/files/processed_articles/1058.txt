Our examination of seven program sites\nsuggests that despite solid community leadership and carefully crafted plans, political, eco-\nnomic, and organizational obstacles precluded much expansion of coverage and con-\nstrained reforms. Redistribution of financial and organizational resources among both\nmainstream and safety-net institutions in these communities was hard to achieve.

On\nthe other hand, health is famously a \"commu-\nnity affair\" in the United States. The example\nof Hillsborough County, Florida, which since\nthe early 1990s brought coverage to nearly\nfrom a half-cent increase in the sales tax,\nshows that communities can at least make a\ndent in the problem.2 Moreover, local innova-\ntions that improve the delivery of medical care\nmay not only per se benefit the uninsured but\nalso liberate new resources with which to ex-\npand coverage. What happens, then, when\ncommunities, aided and abetted by foundation\nsupport, work to mobilize resources sufficient\nto expand coverage or care for the uninsured?\nTo answer these questions, we interviewed\nkey stakeholders in person at each site twice\nand supplemented our site visits with tele-\nphone interviews and examination of docu-\nments. The mix of modest progress, stalemate,\nand collapse that we found after four years of\ntracking suggests, in brief, that even communi-\nty leaders who are deeply dedicated to ad-\ndressing the problems of the uninsured face a\nsharp uphill struggle. A few communities have\nengineered small expansions of coverage or\ncare, but nothing in the concatenation of cir-\ncumstances that supported this modest prog-\nress or in the general record of our seven sites\nargues that U.S. communities have the capac-\nity to make much of a dent in the problems of\nthe uninsured.3\nInstitutions And Resources\nImproving coverage and care for the unin-\nsured is inescapably an exercise in redistribu-\ntion from the haves to the have-nots. Institu-\ntions, public or private, that command\nresources must agree to shift some share of\nthem to medically disadvantaged individuals\nor households (coverage) or organizations\n(care). Whether the strategy envisions, for ex-\nample, shifting patients from tertiary hospitals\nto community health centers (CHCs), spend-\ning tobacco settlement funds on covering the\nuninsured instead of on immunization cam-\npaigns, or increasing the sales tax to aid those\nwithout coverage instead of improving the\ntransportation infrastructure, some local in-\nstitutions and residents will--absent the infu-\nsion of new resources from outside the com-\nmunity--gain while others lose.\nThat broader coverage entails redistribu-\ntion is a truism--to be sure, money spent for\none purpose is not available for others--but in\npolitical terms, this truth is not trivial. Funds\nfor coverage get (re)channeled, not along opti-\nmal lines charted by analysts but, rather,\nthrough dark thickets of political conflict that\nmust be mapped before they can be success-\nfully navigated, and CIC illuminates the tra-\nvails that attend alternative visions of redistri-\nbution.\nInstitutions that do the redistributing are\nof two general types: \"mainstream\" (govern-\nment agencies, business firms, community\nhospitals, medical societies, and managed care\norganizations, for example); and \"safety net\"\n(entities that traditionally care for the disad-\nvantaged--CHCs, public clinics, and public or\nvoluntary hospitals with a high volume of un-\ninsured or publicly insured patients). Re-\nsources to be redistributed also come in two\nbroad categories: funds (new tax dollars and\nprivate insurance premiums) and \"organiza-\ntion\" (revised procedures, donated profes-\nsional services, redeployed personnel, and ser-\nvice innovations such as group-based patient\neducation). To be sure, changes in funding\ntend to have organizational implications, and\nvice versa, but these variables are distinct\nenough for our analytical purposes.\nM a r k e t W a t c h\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e W 1 5 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

First, mainstream institutions may\ncommit new moneys (funds not previously\nused for this purpose; Portland, Oregon, and\nBrooklyn). Second, mainstream institutions\nmay reorganize their time and work for the in-\ntended advantage of the uninsured. This strat-\negy entails a redistribution of professional en-\nergies that improves care largely in lieu of new\nmonies (Portland, Maine). (Time, of course, is\nfamously money, so these redistributed ser-\nvices are arguably equivalent to new funds, but\nthe distinction is worth maintaining.) Third,\nsafety-net institutions may redistribute their\nbudgets in ways that extend coverage or care\nfor the uninsured. Redistribution in this case\ngenerally shifts funds among institutions and\npurposes within the safety net itself in hopes\nof forging a better system (Birmingham and\nAlameda County). Fourth, safety-net institu-\ntions may reconfigure the division of labor\namong themselves or redesign workflow\nwithin their organizations, to provide better\ncare for the uninsured.4\nStrategies And Strains\nn Strategy I. Portland, Oregon. Portland's\nCIC program is a public variation on our first\nstrategic theme: raising new \"mainstream\"\ndollars to benefit the uninsured. In a setting\naccustomed to regional (tri-county) thinking\nand institution building for transportation,\nrecreation, and other \"collective\" goods, defin-\ning the uninsured as a regional issue had\nstrong a priori appeal in Portland. In liberal\nMultnomah County, moreover, creation of a\ntaxing district that might emulate the accom-\nplishment of Hillsborough County, Florida,\nwas not entirely beyond the political pale. Talk\nof new taxes, however, soon ran afoul of an\neconomy so sour that Oregon laid doleful\nclaim to the nation's highest unemployment\nrate by mid-2002. The declining tax revenues\nthat ensued meant, of course, that the state\nand counties were hard pressed to maintain\ncurrent levels of public service; finding new\nfunds to cover thousands of uninsured resi-\ndents looked quixotic. Moreover, the region's\ncounties displayed different political personal-\nities and distinct institutional approaches to\nproviding health services: Multnomah County\nhad a liberal and activist tradition and sizable\npublic health institutions, but Washington\nCounty was essentially a middle-class suburb,\nconservative and cautious about adding new\npublic services to such basics as schooling and\nlaw enforcement. Clackamas County fell\nsomewhere in between.\nBy 2002, having agreed that political pros-\npects for a new taxing district for the unin-\nsured were negligible, CIC planners floated a\nregional \"port authority\" that might somehow\ntake existing resources in hand and reconfig-\nure them for the benefit of the uninsured. Ten-\nsions over intentions aggravated jurisdictional\ndistrust: Was the \"authority\" mainly a means\nby which activist Multnomah might redistrib-\nute funds from its two county \"partners\" to it-\nself, home to many of the region's uninsured\ncitizens and its safety-net providers? Finding\nlittle taste for anything so structurally impos-\ning, reformers instead proposed tri-county\n\"cooperative agreements\" to address the prob-\nlems of uninsurance. Jettisoning the authorita-\ntive connotations of an \"authority,\" leaders in\nthe public health agencies in the three counties\nquietly worked to convince their skeptical and\nmostly detached \"electeds\" (county commis-\nsioners) of the merits of a safety-net \"enter-\nprise,\" a term meant to suggest, said one\nsource, a business venture--an \"organization\nof influence.\"\nthree counties on language that would bring\nsuch an entity into being, the principals were\ntrying to decide what exactly it might do. High\non most lists were (1) the use of data to paint a\ndetailed picture of the distribution of care for\nthe uninsured among institutions in the coun-\nties, (2) concerting plans to leverage new fed-\neral dollars, (3) coordinating grant seeking\namong safety-net clinics and hospitals, (4)\nidentifying ways to make care for the unin-\nsured more equitable and efficient, and (of\ncourse) (5) reducing inappropriate use of\nemergency departments (EDs). Even these\nseemingly innocuous projects could threaten\nthe autonomy of county leaders, however, so\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In fall 2003, said one, \"It's just\ntalk of funneling resources through this\n`thing'.\" Portland's mainstream institutions\nhad, in effect, exchanged strategy I, raising\nnew funds, for strategy IV, reorganizing the\nsafety net under the guiding hand of the\nemerging \"enterprise.\" But whether or not CIC\ncould produce something substantial re-\nmained to be seen.\nBrooklyn, New York. CIC in Brooklyn ran a\nprivate variation on strategy I. Here new funds\nto cover the uninsured are expected to come\nfrom the private sector (small employers), not\nfrom taxpayers. The Brooklyn project\nbreathed new life into an old idea: If the U.S.\nprivate sector contrives to cover most employ-\nees, rocket science should not be needed to de-\nvise appealing, affordable private insurance\nproducts to cover the rest. To be sure, previous\nefforts to develop such options have amounted\nto a party to which small firms rarely choose to\ncome, but hope springs eternal, and Brooklyn\ntweaked the core elements of small-employer\ninsurance in promising ways.5\nSpecifically, Brooklyn's CIC plan--Brook-\nlyn Health Works (BHW)--combined strong\npublic support by the borough president, en-\nthusiastic endorsement by the local Chamber\nof Commerce, and the prospect of state waiv-\ners that would exempt the new coverage from\ntaxes imposed on most carriers. The plan mo-\nbilized an impressive cast of participants. The\nGroup Health Insurance plan, which had\nmuch experience in the small-group market,\nagreed to underwrite the coverage. The Cham-\nber of Commerce helped brokers identify eligi-\nble firms. The borough's hospitals, which\nhoped that new paying customers would\nbrighten their fiscal picture, agreed to accept\ndeep discounts. The office of the borough pres-\nident could engage community organizations,\nwhich conferred the legitimacy of citizen par-\nticipation on the plan. If, as one CIC planner\nproclaimed, \"it's all about relationships,\" the\nproject seemed to have lined up its ducks ad-\nmirably. The need, moreover, was unquestion-\nable: Brooklyn housed few private providers,\nplentiful poor and uninsured residents, and a\ngrowing number of immigrants who could not\notherwise qualify for coverage.\nForces in the environment of the program\nsoon shook these well-laid plans. An economic\ndownturn, severely aggravated by the impact\nther stressed the precarious profit margins of\nsmall firms in Brooklyn. The borough presi-\ndency changed hands, and the new incumbent\nviewed this complex project from the previous\nregime with understandable caution. Provid-\ners sought formal assurance that the new plan\nwould not enroll people holding less deeply\ndiscounted insurance, but state law precluded\nsuch \"anti-crowd-out\" provisions.\nto revive; the Chamber of Commerce assumed\nleadership of the project, supplying energy for-\nmerly emanating from the borough president's\noffice; and discussions between project staff\nand the state's superintendent of insurance\nyielded an ingenious solution to the crowd-out\nproblem: putting BHW under the program-\nmatic umbrella of Healthy New York, a state\nprogram that helped small firms gain health\ncoverage. This move bought BHW both the\nprotections its providers wanted and valuable\nstop-loss protection. The key, remarked a par-\nticipant, was to \"leverage public spirit\" by\n\"aligning the interests of the uninsured with\nthose of other entities.\" CIC wanted the state\nDepartment of Insurance to help make its\nproduct acceptable to providers and affordable\nto purchasers; the state government wanted a\nshot in the arm for the lagging enrollment of\nHealthy New York.\nBringing the state on board was a crucial\nbreakthrough, yet there was no rest for CIC's\nweary planners. As they prepared to cut the\nribbon on BHW, the health system that ran a\nhospital key to the plan's network forbade the\ninstitution to accept the discounted rates, and\nthe tense negotiations that followed delayed\nthe plan's unveiling for six months. The prod-\nuct finally hit the market in early 2004 but, af-\nter seven months of enrollment, had signed up\nonly fifty-five employees in eighteen firms.\nJacksonville, Florida. Jacksonville's CIC trajec-\ntory illustrates the interplay between strategy\nM a r k e t W a t c h\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e W 1 5 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Initially, CIC hoped to\nemulate Hillsborough County's success by\nwinning an increase of a half-cent on the\ncounty sales tax to cover the uninsured. This\nhope evaporated when the mayor opted in-\nstead to use the increase for his \"Better Jack-\nsonville\" initiative, which featured a range of\ncivic improvements. CIC's Plan B--some com-\nbination of public and private revenues with\nwhich to expand coverage--held little prom-\nise. Local government already pumped sizable\nsums into the local safety-net hospital, to cover\nthe costs of caring for the medically indigent,\nand was disinclined to commit further funds\nto a new program. Moreover, chief executives\nof the city's other major hospitals were unwill-\ning to cough up new monies of their own.\nIn Jacksonville, however, CIC staff found\nstrategic assets that were absent from Port-\nland, Oregon. The site's consolidated city-\ncounty government averted intergovernmen-\ntal battles, and a thriving economy both ele-\nvated health coverage on the agenda of private\nemployers who wanted to attract good work-\ners and spared the city from the ravaged reve-\nnues that constrained policy innovations in\nmany local venues.\nThrough 2002, CIC staff, aided by an influ-\nential local foundation, convened a string of\nforums in which the components of the unin-\nsurance problem in Jacksonville were exam-\nined and options to address it were carefully\ncanvassed. The influential chief executive of\nthe city's largest hospital, eager both to reduce\nof the burden of the uninsured on his hospital\nand to advance its religious mission, embraced\nthe project and tirelessly urged both the mayor\nand other hospital leaders to attend the forums\nand stay the course. Gradually, consensus set-\ntled on a public-private partnership, and the\nprotagonists worked to whittle one into shape.\nThe resulting model, JaxCare, is a reorganized\ndelivery system in which an expanded net-\nwork of providers (safety-net and mainstream\nhospitals), offering a specified set of benefits,\ndiscounted prices, and improved information\ntechnology and promoted in the marketplace\nby a cooperative Chamber of Commerce, will\nprovide efficient care for the newly insured. As\nendorsed by the mayor and the city council,\nJaxCare will use $2.5 million of new public\nfunds (supplemented by hospital contribu-\ntions and management assistance from Blue\nCross Blue Shield of Florida) to pilot a pro-\ngram that brings new coverage to 1,500 work-\ning uninsured Jacksonville residents. JaxCare's\nsponsors expect that evaluators will find im-\nproved health outcomes coupled with less rap-\nidly rising costs of care once ED use declines\nand primary care case management takes hold.\nA positive verdict, they hope, might persuade\nlocal, state, federal, foundation, and private\nfunders to sustain and expand the program.\nStrategies I and II were thus conjoined. The\nprospect of efficiency generated by the reorga-\nnization of the safety net would entice contri-\nbutions of new money from government and\nproviders and then, as the system evolved,\ngradually replace (at least partially) those city\nand hospital funds with savings generated by\nmore effective use of resources. In August\n2004, however, demonstrated savings were the\nleast of the project's worries: JaxCare had only\nseventy enrollees and was pondering how to\nfind its market niche.\nn Strategy II. Portland, Maine. In Portland,\nmainstream institutions created a plan, Care-\nPartners, that reorganized the delivery system\nto expand care for the uninsured. The partners\nincluded MaineHealth (an integrated non-\nprofit hospital system that served three-\nfourths of the state's population), affiliated\nhospitals in three counties, Anthem Blue Cross\n(which supplied claims management at no\ncost), and more than 700 primary care and spe-\ncialty practices. Providers delivered uncom-\npensated care to a limited number of unin-\nsured patients via primary care \"medical\nhomes,\" office-based specialty care, and hospi-\ntalization when needed. MaineHealth com-\nmitted funds for prescription drugs. Eligible\npatients were enrolled in disease management\nprograms, and care managers would generate\nsavings on hospital and ED use that were ex-\npected partially to offset the program's cost.\nImplementation of the model revealed the\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

One county, Waterville-Augusta,\nenjoyed reasonable levels of provider partici-\npation and enrollment of beneficiaries. A sec-\nond, Portland, found good participation\namong primary care physicians and hospitals\nbut surprisingly sluggish enrollment. In the\nthird, rural Lincoln County, providers were\nfew and feared the costs of serving a (presum-\nably) rising number of uninsured patients,\nwho were (these fears notwithstanding) nota-\nbly slow to enroll.\nThree challenges, more-\nover, cut across all three set-\ntings. First, physicians were\nambivalent about participat-\ning. A mix of motives induced\nhospitals to join CarePart-\nners: namely, mission (all hos-\npitals in Maine save one are\nvoluntary nonprofits and by\nstate law must care for the\nmedically indigent), margin\n(readier primary care and case management\nfor the uninsured should lower the costs of un-\ncompensated ED services), and Medicaid (a\nsource of revenue for which some CarePart-\nners enrollees would prove to be eligible). Phy-\nsicians were a tougher sell. In a state with few\nCHCs, many physicians already quietly gave\nprimary care to the uninsured, but some were\nsaid to fear that signing up with CarePartners\nwould make them a magnet for more than they\ncould handle. Specialists were especially slow\nto commit to the program. That physicians\ntended to be widely dispersed across rural\npopulations further complicated the plan's ef-\nforts to recruit them. On the other hand, pri-\nmary care physicians were pleased that Care-\nPartners would supply or improve such tools\nas diagnostic services and medications, which\ntheir uninsured patients needed but were of-\nten obliged to forgo.\nSecond, as in such undersubscribed pro-\ngrams as Medicaid and the State Children's\nHealth Insurance Program (SCHIP), those\nwho were eligible had to learn about Care-\nPartners and how to enroll. This process began\nwith proof that they did not qualify for Medic-\naid, a time-consuming and stigmatizing deter-\nmination that some uninsured people declined\nto pursue. The number of uninsured people\nwho sought to sign on was also unimpressive\nbecause, as one respondent observed, many of\nthem \"were satisfied with episodic care.\" Ag-\ngressive outreach by the plan might have\nboosted the ranks of enrollees, but constraints\non the number it could support held its zeal to\nrecruit in check.\nThe size of the coverage gap that the Maine\nCIC project sought to plug\nchanged before its eyes, more-\nover, as its objectives were\ndiscombobulated by the\nshifts in public eligibility cri-\nteria that go with the terri-\ntory of incremental gap-fill-\ning programs. When state\nexpansions in Medicaid cov-\nerage (unexpected in light of\nMaine's budget woes) took\naway hard-won CarePartners\nenrollees, the plan had to revisit its own stan-\ndards for eligibility, and CIC planners debated\nwhether to cast their net more widely, perhaps\noffering CarePartners to workers who stayed\nuninsured because they could not afford to\ntake up their employer's offer of coverage. That\ncourse risked crowding out private coverage,\nhowever, which no one wanted to do. Late in\n2003, CIC tentatively agreed to open Care-\nPartners to workers who could not afford the\ncoverage offered by their employer, but only if\nthe workers' premiums, deductibles, and\ncopays would exceed 5 percent of their ad-\njusted gross income. As a price of compromise,\nproviders (mainly the rural hospitals) insisted\non enrollment caps in each site, lest they be\nflooded by new enrollees.\nThe disinclination of providers and pa-\ntients to change their behavior presented a\nthird challenge. In theory, by improving the\nuse of resources, care management would yield\nsavings with which to expand CarePartners.\nBut physicians, voluntarily rendering uncom-\npensated care, were reluctant to complete the\npaperwork that generated the data on which\nsound coordination of care depends.

A state plan to expand cover-\nage would yet again redefine the gap Care-\nPartners aimed to fill. Pharmacy costs had\nrisen to 40 percent of the plan's budget and\nthreatened to drain the coffers of its main\nsponsor, thus clouding the program's financial\nfuture. Disease management was just getting\noff the ground. \"We just wanted to do our\nshare,\" one of the project's prime movers re-\nflected. \"We never claimed to be solving the\nproblem of the uninsured here in Maine.\"\nn Strategy III. Birmingham, Alabama. In two\nsites, safety-net institutions tried to engineer a\nsizable redistribution of dollars within their\nsystems. In Birmingham the core of the safety\nnet is Cooper-Green Hospital, a county entity\nof 1970s vintage, built largely to ensure care for\nAfrican Americans who had been made to feel\nunwelcome in \"community\" hospitals during\nyears of segregation. Cooper-Green, to which\nthe county devotes about $40 million annually,\ncame increasingly under attack as an obsolete\nfacility that rendered care of questionable\nquality. Birmingham's other hospitals, with\nplenty of unused capacity, contended that they\ncould provide inpatient care for African Amer-\nicans; that bitter memories of segregation had\n(or should have) faded; and that what Cooper-\nGreen's patients needed above all was accessi-\nble, high-quality primary care. CIC planners\ntherefore hoped to forge agreement that the\ncounty's annual outlay would shift from Coo-\nper-Green to the building of \"network service\nareas\" among community hospitals and clinics,\nand an expanded primary care system cospon-\nsored by the County Health Department and a\nmuch-downsized Cooper-Green.\nThis win-win scenario proved to be a polit-\nical loser. Cooper-Green was, rightly or\nwrongly, a potent symbol of racial equality,\nand although its defenders no longer feared\nthat black women would give birth on the\nlawns of \"white\" hospitals that refused to ad-\nmit them or would be consigned to substan-\ndard segregated basement wards, they were by\nno means convinced that these mainstream in-\nstitutions would welcome blacks, treat them\nwith dignity, and give them good care. More-\nover, the county commissioners who oversaw\nCooper-Green were reluctant both to lose the\n$40 million of county funds that bought jobs\nfor their constituents and to divert funds to in-\nstitutions outside their control that might re-\nturn repeatedly to demand more money as the\nprice of caring for the uninsured. Acrimony be-\ntween Cooper-Green's defenders (mainly\nblack) and proponents of new arrangements\npredicated on primary care (mainly white)\ngrew steadily, yielding a nasty public fight that\nthe primary care forces lost. Unable to reas-\nsemble Humpty Dumpty, Birmingham's CIC\nprogram shut down late in 2002. The lesson\nseems to be that although the safety net has\nsizable resources to \"play\" with, the status\nquo's many defenders can play hardball poli-\ntics that sharply limits the fungibility of those\nresources.\nAlamedaCounty,California. Alameda County's\nCIC program delivers a similar message by a\ndifferent route. Building on a provision of Cali-\nfornia law that guarantees MediCal (Califor-\nnia Medicaid) beneficiaries the choice of a\nsafety net\u00adsponsored managed care organiza-\ntion (MCO), the county created Alameda Alli-\nance for Health, a nonprofit MCO built on the\narea's abundant CHCs. The plan proved to be a\nfinancial success, and the county's hospital,\nCHCs, community activists, and government\nofficials, collaborating as the CIC grantee, de-\nbated how to invest the Alliance's reserves.\n\"The community would have squawked if we\ndidn't use those reserves for the community\ngood,\" one stakeholder explained.\nCommunity leaders in the CIC collabora-\ntive agreed that both expanding health cover-\nage and strengthening the safety net were un-\nimpeachable priorities, but they differed on\nhow to strike a balance between the two. One\nschool maintained that the county's heavy\nspending on the safety net ought to be redis-\ntributed toward insurance coverage. A propo-\nnent of this strategy conjectured that\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Yeah, they [the safety net] will scream\nbloody murder, but if you've got $60\u00ad$70 million\nannually in the safety net, can't you convert some\nof it? But public hospitals in California think\nbigger is better. The public hospital lobby is part\nof the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, and\nthey're powerful, so you're fighting the people\nwho support you the most. They want to build\nbig institutions--jobs and political support are\nthere. Then besides the county hospitals, you've\ngot the community-based clinics, the county\nworkers, and the minority doctors with forty-to-\nfifty-year traditions, who say, \"We do 70 percent\nof the care for moms and kids, so why are we be-\ning left out?\" Add it up, and the safety net is big.\nFor advocates of insurance, CIC was a win-\ndow of opportunity. Its funds would supply\nthe staff, data, expertise, and managerial ca-\npacity both to help boost enrollment in Medi-\nCal and to design and market new coverage,\n\"Family Care\"--subsidized by $14 million\nfrom the Alliance's reserves (plus $1 million\nper year from state tobacco settlement funds\nment). CIC constituted new resources that\ncould broaden the insurance beachhead with-\nout \"messing with existing money for the\nsafety net,\" as one player put it.\nAlthough defenders of the safety net duti-\nfully acknowledged that coverage and care\nwere not zero-sum alternatives, the new\nprominence that CIC conferred on the former\nthreatened the latter. One participant re-\nmarked on the community's \"consensus that\nwe don't want hospitals to go under or close\nbeds. To shrink the hospitals conflicts with\nthe community's preference for choice.\" Not\ntoo much choice, however: Insurance that per-\nmitted subscribers to get care from providers\nbeyond the safety net cruelly rebuffed those\nwho dutifully treated the uninsured when oth-\ners declined to do so. One CHC executive\nthought it \"irresponsible just to give them in-\nsurance and let them go where they please.\nYou've got to nourish the safety-net infrastruc-\nture, too.\" A public hospital executive joined\nthe chorus:\nEven if everyone is insured, they still [have to]\nget care somewhere, and a lot of the private pro-\nviders just don't want these folks. And for the\nsafety net, it's not just health care--it's social\nwork, nutrition, and lots more. The safety net\nwill do these things; the private providers just\ndon't and won't.\nAs Family Care rolled out, state and county\nbudget surpluses began to vanish into omi-\nnous deficits, and stressed hospitals in the\ncounty laid moral claim to a portion of the Al-\nliance's reserves, thus challenging the ascen-\ndance of the new insurance strategy. In a con-\ntentious and wrenching session, the Alliance's\ndirectors voted to bail out the hospitals with\n$12 million of Alliance reserves. When the\ncounty's medical center successfully de-\nmanded another $7 million to keep operating,\nobservers wondered whether redistribution of\nsafety-net resources to insurance coverage had\nfound its legs politically and whether care and\ncoverage could reverse their customary roles at\nthe center and periphery of the system.\nEvents in 2003 brought disconcerting clar-\nity. Tackling a huge budget deficit, the state\ndeferred implementation of a federally ap-\nproved waiver that would have brought new\ncoverage to parents of SCHIP-eligible chil-\ndren--coverage on which Family Care had\nbeen counting as it estimated the number of\nlives it could afford to cover. As its own costs\nrose and its MediCal rates faced contraction,\nthe Alliance insisted that its reserves (no lon-\nger readily replenishable) should not be ex-\npected to carry Family Care forward. By year's\nend, CIC's leaders were scrambling to assem-\nble from California foundations, county to-\nbacco settlement sums, and other coffers re-\nsources sufficient to sustain coverage for 3,200\nlives, about half of its peak enrollment. By mid-\nsustainable. Meanwhile, a $78 million deficit\nin the Alameda County Medical Center, the\ncore of the safety net, left no doubt that the\ncounty's statutory duties to sustain care ines-\ncapably dwarfed its good intentions to expand\ncoverage.\nn Strategy IV.

The four major voluntary\nhospitals in Jackson set aside\ntheir rivalries to gather data\non use patterns and fashion\nnew referral services among\nthe hospitals, the CHCs, and\nthe Medical Mall. Although\nthe project's staff hoped that\nthe four key hospitals might\nthese plans (making Jackson\nalso an exemplar of Strategy\nII), funding mainly entailed \"coordination of\nexisting resources,\" which, a participant ex-\nplained, made sound political sense: \"It's key to\nmaximize the system you've got, or people\nwon't listen when you ask for more money.\"\nJackson's CIC staff hoped to reduce frag-\nmentation of care by creating a sophisticated\nprogram in which volunteer hospital employ-\nees referred patients who used EDs inappro-\npriately to one of the HCHA's primary care\ncenters. The HCHA proposed to increase the\naccess of patients to primary care providers by\nmeans of such extra services as transportation\nto clinics, a mobile phone system (to reduce\nbroken appointments), a discount prescrip-\ntion drug program, and disease management\n(mainly for diabetics and cardiac patients).\nThis model of increased coordination within\nthe safety net and between safety-net provid-\ners and their patients seemed so promising\nthat in early 2003 the Mississippi State Divi-\nsion of Medicaid contracted with the Alliance\nto channel Medicaid patients to primary care\nsettings.\nThe strategy fell short, however. Fearful\nthat the HCHA might be a bill collector or\nwelfare office, almost half of the ED patients\ngave incorrect addresses or phone numbers,\nleaving project staff unable to contact them\nabout primary care referrals. Reorganization\nof care, moreover, failed to penetrate far\nenough throughout the safety net. Uninsured\npatients trying out CHCs and the Medical\nMall found four-week waits for appointments\nand long delays in waiting rooms once they\nreached their primary care medical \"homes.\"\nMeanwhile, competition had spurred the four\nhospitals to reengineer their EDs, which re-\nduced average waiting times\nto an hour. Faced with pri-\nmary care alternatives that\nkept them waiting longer and\ncollected mandatory copay-\nments on the spot, many of\nthe uninsured stuck with the\nED, leaving the future of the\nJackson project in doubt.\nAssessments And\nInsights\nThe basic strategic tools for improving\nhealth coverage and care for the uninsured--\nmore public or private money (or both), reallo-\ncation of funds within the safety net, and\nbetter organization of care within the safety\nnet or the larger community system--are\navailable to any community that cares to de-\nploy them. Although CIC is now winding\ndown, many communities across the country\nhave tried to adopt one or more of these strate-\ngies. CIC's checkered career offers a useful,\nthough limited, commentary on the pros and\ncons of such community-centered initiatives.\nA streamlined structure/process/outcome\nassessment of the seven CIC sites studied here\ngoes like this: Highly intelligent and mission-\ndriven local leaders carefully planned and he-\nroically pursued initiatives that yielded mod-\nest results. The program's fondest hope--that\nthe funded sites would follow Hillsborough\nCounty's lead by raising new \"mainstream\"\nfunds for covering the uninsured--was largely\ndisappointed in the few sites (notably Ore-\ngon's three counties, Brooklyn, and Jackson-\nville) that sought to realize it. In this \"cell,\"\npower too widely diffused over too many inde-\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\n\"Power too widely\ndiffused over too\nmany independent\ninstitutions bedevils\nthe most committed\nand energetic local\nleaders.\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Redistrib-\nuting funds within the safety net for new\ncoverage (Alameda County) or patterns of care\n(Birmingham) fares little better. Funding pat-\nterns in safety-net institutions that might\nstrike critics as inefficient and ripe for revision\nlook to insiders like admirable (albeit misun-\nderstood) embodiments of their vital roles and\nmission.\nThe CIC program in southern Maine shows\nnotable, although limited, success in organiz-\ning new care for the uninsured by enlisting an\nexpanding cadre of mainstream providers.\nOne lesson might be that \"more is better\" re-\nmains the most feasible formula for redistribu-\ntion in the U.S. health care system, but getting\nthat \"more\" was not easy. And the main lesson\nof CIC's redesign of caregiving within Jack-\nson's safety net is all too familiar: Changing the\nbehavior of complex formal organizations is\ndifficult, and changing the care-seeking pref-\nerences and patterns of disadvantaged con-\nsumers is no easier.\nn Coverage versus care. Contemplation\nof the four strategies yields a cross-cutting in-\nsight: Communities tend to find it \"easier\"\n(though not easy) to expand care than to ex-\ntend coverage. Organizational politics within\nand among community health care institu-\ntions that aim to redesign care encounter\nfewer (though not few) pitfalls than do tax\nand budgetary politics among elected officials\nand public agencies that hope to generate new\ncoverage. The institutions that deliver care to\ncommunity residents without coverage are up\nclose and personal. Uninsured people morph\ninto \"patients\" in waiting rooms and EDs. Care\nreally is a \"community affair,\" whereas the in-\nstitutions that govern coverage lie here, there,\nand everywhere--a \"field of inaccountabili-\nties.\"6 That the coverage buck so often starts\nand stops elsewhere is of course one reason\nwhy communities are compelled to pump siz-\nable sums of their own money into safety-net\ninstitutions.\nMoreover, power comes more readily to\nhand in reforms of care than in those that ex-\ntend coverage. Local providers and payers in\nMaine, for instance, controlled enough levers\nto implement the agreements they negotiated\namong themselves to donate services. The new\ninformation system that Jacksonville con-\nvinced its hospitals to accept speaks to a func-\ntion these hospitals control. Care-improving\ninnovations may nonetheless carry costs both\neconomic and political--disputes between\n\"old\" safety-net entities and \"new\" ones like\nCHCs, for example. Nor are such innovations\nguaranteed immunity from costs imposed\nfrom above the community--for instance, hos-\npitals that reduce the number of uninsured\npeople treated in their EDs may jeopardize\ntheir federal disproportionate-share hospital\n(DSH) payments. On balance, however, it is\nprobably fair to generalize that persuading\nmainstream providers to donate services to a\nnew plan (Maine) is less arduous than recon-\nfiguring operations within existing safety-net\ninstitutions (Jackson), which is in turn less\ntorturous than shifting millions of dollars\nwithin safety-net institutions and between\nthese and mainstream ones (Birmingham)--\nwhich still might face slightly rosier prospects\nthan raising local taxes for new coverage for\nthe uninsured or inducing small firms to buy\nit.\nn Where the power lies. Even when art-\nfully amassed, local power might not suffice to\nsecure local coverage projects. New models of\ncoverage require certification by state insur-\nance authorities. BHW could not hit the mar-\nket until insurance authorities (belatedly)\neased its way. The launching of JaxCare was\nmuch delayed first by long debates over\nwhether the plans constituted \"insurance\" and\nthen by honoring the demands of state insur-\nance regulators. And as California's decision\nnot to implement a crucial coverage-expand-\ning federal waiver reminded CIC staff in\nAlameda County, local plans may depend\nheavily on state and federal powers of the\npurse. Such variables as state criteria for eligi-\nbility in Medicaid and SCHIP, private employ-\ners' willingness to offer health insurance to\ntheir workers, and the vagaries of regional\neconomies powerfully influence the number of\nuninsured, but communities can do little\nM a r k e t W a t c h\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e W 1 5 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The raw materials of universal\ncoverage--Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, man-\ndated employer purchases, and monies forgone\nby tax expenditure polices--lie outside com-\nmunity hands.7\nImprovements in the delivery of care also\nfurnish a more fruitful arena for the exertion of\nmission-driven local leaders than expansions\ndo. Cases in point are Maine, where CIC aug-\nmented donated care, and Jackson, where lead-\ners of a quartet of hospitals were determined\nto show that their image of better-organized\nsafety-net services could work. CIC protago-\nnists in Portland, Oregon; Brooklyn; and\nAlameda County were no less dedicated to\ntheir plans for the creation of new coverage,\nbut following the money they needed was one\nthing, securing it quite another.\nn Levels-of-government question. On all\nthree counts, then--institutions, power, and\nleadership--reconfigurations of care tend to\nlie more firmly within the purview of commu-\nnity control than do coverage expansions. It\nwould be hasty to infer that this good news\nabout care offsets the bad news about cover-\nage, however: In most communities the need to\nmaintain (never mind enhance) the local\nsafety-net establishment retains first claim on\ncommunity resources and consigns redistribu-\ntion of safety-net resources and organizational\npatterns to the outer margins of the system. As\nlong as they contain more or less functioning\nsafety nets, community leaders seldom show\nmuch taste for pitched battles over their re-\nconfiguration and instead rest content to keep\nthem (more or less) intact, preferably with as\nmuch federal and state money as may be lever-\naged, leaving safety-net providers to fight\namong themselves over the (re)distribution of\nlabor and largesse.\nNotwithstanding a couple of medium-\nwattage points of light, CIC offers little hope\nthat communities can or will make major\nbreakthroughs in expanding coverage or care\nfor the uninsured. To infer that communities\nare therefore the wrong answer to what is es-\nsentially a question of the proper division of la-\nbor within the U.S. federal system would be\nmisleading, however. Although Hillsborough-\nlike programs are rare, communities invest\nlarge sums in care for the uninsured. How\nmuch coverage those funds might buy were\nthey redistributed from safety-net institutions\nis largely a moot point, because, first, such re-\nprogramming is not in the political and institu-\ntional cards and, second, the need for accessible\ncare for the (newly) insured would demand\nsome retention or reinvention of current safety-\nnet capacity.\nThe states, too, present a blurred picture of\ninhibition at war with innovation. Medicaid is\nthe first or second most costly item of spend-\ning in most state budgets and is crucial for lo-\ncal safety-net providers. Medicaid now spends\nfar more than most states would prefer to\ncommit to health coverage, but Hawaii has had\nan employer mandate since 1974, California\nkeeps flirting with a mandate, Massachusetts\nand Washington enacted laws that (had polit-\nical tides not shifted dramatically) would have\napproached universal coverage, and Minne-\nsota has adopted public programs that com-\nbine with its broad private coverage to drive\nits percentage of uninsured residents below 10\npercent.\nThe federal government, which has the\ngreatest capacity of the three government lev-\nels to raise funds and pool insured lives, has\nconspicuously failed to achieve universal cov-\nerage. The feds, however, spend handsomely\non Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP and subsi-\ndize the safety net in many ways. Across the\nintergovernmental system, then, runs a com-\nmon theme: All three levels are financially pre-\noccupied with their existing duties for cover-\nage and care and have been able neither to\nbuild the political consensus nor to find the\npolitical will to get forty-six million more\nAmericans covered and served. If identifying\nthe right level of government for the job were\nthe central challenge, the nation would be\nlucky indeed.\nn Cultural and political question. The\nlevels-of-government question is secondary to\na primary cultural and political question: Why\ndoes the United States, unique among West-\nern peers, persist in permitting so many citi-\nzens to go un- and underinsured?

Simply to scan this list is to see how\nand why the concrete contributions of a pro-\ngram like CIC cannot be more than marginal.\nBut insofar as the program helped immerse lo-\ncal notables in the intricacies and trade-offs\nthat perplex health policy and stiffened their\nresolve to work them through politically, its\nstructures and processes might eventually\npromote outcomes more impressive than CIC\ncould achieve on its own time and turf.\nTheauthorsthankTerriStoller,Catherine\nMcLaughlin,JamesKnickman,NancyFishman,\nSherryGlied,andtwoanonymousreviewersfor\nhelpfulcommentsonanearlierdraft.Thisworkwas\nsupportedinpartbytheCaliforniaHealthCare\nFoundation.\nNOTES\n1.

The only major new local programs for the unin-\nsured have developed in several California coun-\nties in the past two years.

Although the analysis of the strategies in this pa-\nper concentrates on the major program elements\nof the seven sites, these elements do not exhaust\nthe sites' CIC-sponsored activities. For example,\nunder strategy I, the federal Health Resources\nand Services Administration (HRSA) gave\nBrooklyn an HCAP grant for drug coverage, and\nin AlamedaCounty, two foundationsgaveFamily\nCare a total of $1.85 million--a small but not un-\nimportant addition to the $14 million with\nwhich the Alliance capitalized the plan. In strat-\negy II, Jacksonville providers donated care to\nhelp keep JaxCare affordable, and in Brooklyn,\nboth public and private hospitals agreed to ac-\ncept discounted fees (which can be treated as be-\ning equivalent to donated time). Strategy III con-\ntains the donation by Jacksonville's safety-net\nvices to JaxCare. Examples of strategy IV include\nAlameda County's \"frequent user\" program,\nwhich aims to bring counseling and other social\nservices to exceptionally high users of ED care.\nCIC can properly claim credit for these (and\nother) initiatives, but their importance is decid-\nedly secondary to those discussed in the text.\n5.
