    "abstract": "Abstract: The loss of manufacturing jobs and the expansion of service jobs and part-time employment\nhave contributed to a decline in the rate of employer-sponsored health insurance among workers. Not\nonly does manufacturing provide more of its own workers with coverage compared with other industry\ngroups, but it also is a significant net \"exporter\" of coverage to dependent workers in other industries.\nIn 1991 the net export of coverage represented a 20 percent tax on manufacturing employers per\ncovered worker, while professional services--the fastest-growing industry group--collected a subsidy\nfrom other industry groups equal to more than 12 percent per covered worker. Similarly, larger\nfirms--those that employed 100 workers or more--paid a self-imposed tax of as much as 13 percent\nper covered worker to support dependent workers employed in smaller firms.\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance plans are the single largest source\nof private insurance coverage among nonelderly Americans. In 1991,\n140 million Americans under age sixty-five--including nearly eighty-\nnine million workers--had coverage from an employer-sponsored health\nplan. Approximately three-quarters of employer-insured workers are covered\nas a benefit of their own employment; all others--some twenty-one million\nworkers--are covered as the dependent of an employer-insured worker,\naccording to the March 1992 Current Population Survey.\nThe number of Americans covered by an employer health plan has\ndeclined over the past decade. Historically, during periods of economic\nrecession the number and proportion of workers without employer coverage\nhas risen. However, at least since 1985 economic expansion has failed to\nproduce growth of employer-sponsored health insurance among workers\nprovided health insurance declined by nearly 2 percent; 1.2 million fewer\nworkers were covered by their own employer in 1991 than had been\ncovered six years earlier. Since 1988 the loss of employer-insured jobs has\naccelerated.\nThe erosion of coverage by employer-sponsored plans coincides with\nmajor changes in the structure of the U.S. work force.

Estimates of uninsured workers and em-\nployer-insured workers are presented, as are estimates of the net change in\nemployer-insured jobs within major industry groups relative to the change\nin industry employment. These estimates indicate that the growth of em-\nployer-insured jobs has been consistently slower than job growth in indus-\ntries that have experienced net job growth. In industries with declining\nemployment, employer-insured jobs have declined even faster.\nUninsured And Employer-Insured Workers\nIt is well known that the percentage of workers who are uninsured varies\namong industry groups and firm sizes. Uninsured workers are counted as the\ndifference between all workers in an industry or firm-size group and workers\nwho report having coverage from any of a number of sources: as a benefit of\nthe worker's own job; as the dependent of another worker; from an individ-\nual policy; or as a beneficiary of a public program, usually Medicaid. In 1991\njust over half of all workers (55 percent) were covered directly by their own\nemployer; all other employer-insured workers were covered only by another\nworker's plan. Nationally, for every ten workers insured by their own\nemployer, another three were covered only as dependents.\nVariation by industry group. In 1991 the proportion of workers who\nwere uninsured from any source throughout the year (or for a significant\nportion of the year) varied markedly among industry groups. Nearly 42\npercent of agricultural workers reported having no insurance coverage\n(Exhibit 1). Among workers principally employed in construction and\npersonal/entertainment services, nearly 30 percent were uninsured all year.\nThese very high rates of uninsured workers contrast with very low rates of\nuninsured workers in other major industry groups, especially in government\n(7 percent) and in finance, insurance, and real estate (8 percent).\nIn general, industries with low rates of uninsured workers have relatively\nhigh rates of employer coverage, either sponsored by the workers' own\nemployers or received as dependents of workers at other firms. In no\nindustry is a low rate of employer coverage fully offset by coverage from\nother sources, such as individually purchased insurance or public programs.\nIn firms that do not contribute to health coverage, coverage received by\nworkers as dependents of workers in other firms represents a real subsidy.\nThis subsidy is collected in the form of higher wages by the dependent\nworkers; by the firm as higher profit (perhaps supporting an otherwise\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Among workers in firms of a thousand or\nmore employees, just seventeen workers are covered only as a dependent for\nevery hundred workers covered by their own employer (Exhibit 3). In\ncontrast, for every hundred workers covered by their own employer in firms\nwith fewer than ten employees, another ninety-five are covered only as the\ndependent of another worker.\nMedicaid. Medicaid is a relatively small but growing source of coverage\namong low-income workers in the United States, mainly as a result of\nfederal expansions of Medicaid eligibility effective since 1990 and expan-\nsions in many states in excess of the federally required minimum. All states\nmust cover pregnant women and infants (to age one) with family incomes\nbelow 133 percent of the federal poverty level States may extend eligibility\nto pregnant women and infants up to 185 percent of poverty with full\nfederal matching, and many have done so. Some states have extended\nMedicaid to these groups with income as high as 200 percent of poverty.\nThese provisions have resulted in a small but growing number of workers\nand families who qualify for Medicaid. While only about 2 percent of\nAmerican workers reported receiving coverage from Medicaid during 1991,\nin some industry groups--agriculture, retail trade, business and repair serv-\nices, and personal and entertainment services--reliance on Medicaid as an\nexclusive source of health coverage ranged between 4 percent and 6 percent\nof total industry employment. Similarly, reliance on Medicaid by workers\nemployed in small firms (4 percent) is greater than that among workers in\nlarge firms (2 percent). However, nearly 29 percent of Medicaid-insured\nworkers identified firms with 1,000 employees or more as their principal\nemployer; only 20 percent identified firms with fewer than ten employees\n(Exhibit 4). As defined here, these workers reported no coverage from an\nemployer (either from their own employer or as a dependent) that year.\nGrowth And Loss Of Employer-Insured Jobs\nSince 1985 U.S. net employment has grown 7.4 percent. This includes\nrapid growth in some industries (professional services, personal/entertain-\nment services, and self-employment) and declining employment in others\n(manufacturing and mining). As employment has changed among industry\ngroups, so has the proportion of workers covered by their own employer\n(Exhibit 5).\nSeveral aspects of the relative change in employer-covered workers ver-\nsus the change in industry employment since 1985 are significant.

However, in each of the fast-growing industries, em-\nployment growth has substantially exceeded the growth of employer-\ninsured jobs. For example, for every hundred jobs gained in professional\nservices (the highest-growth industry), only forty included coverage (Ex-\nhibit 5). As a result, while the number of own-employer-insured workers in\nhigh-growth industries has risen, the percentage of workers in the industry\nwith coverage from their own employer has declined.\nSecond, while own-employer coverage has trailed employment growth in\nall industries, the erosion of coverage has been particularly pronounced in\nslow-growth industries. In very-low-growth industries--construction and\nagriculture--the decline in employer-insured jobs has been dramatic, with\nFinally, in both manufacturing and mining--industry groups that histori-\ncally have had among the highest rates of employer-insured workers--the\nrate of loss of employer-insured jobs has exceeded the rate of decline in total\nemployment (Exhibit 6). For every 100 manufacturing jobs that have been\nlost since 1985, 224 employer-insured manufacturing jobs have been lost\n(see Exhibit 5).\nThese changes in the number and rate of employer-insured jobs across\nsectors suggest that further employment growth is unlikely to stem the\ndwindling rate of employer-based coverage. Furthermore, the rapid decline\nof insured jobs in major sectors of the economy may be problematic for\nother industries.

In particular, declining own-employer coverage\nin industries that export coverage suggests loss of dependents' coverage and,\ntherefore, growing noncoverage in other industry groups as well\nThe distribution of health insurance exported to dependent workers in\nother industry groups (Exhibit 7) is significant in several ways.

In 1991 manu-\nfacturing exported coverage to 3.2 million dependent workers in other\nindustries net of imported coverage; these dependent workers were not\notherwise covered by an employer plan of their own. On average, for every\nhundred manufacturing jobs that are lost, a net fifteen workers in other\nindustry groups also lose employer-sponsored coverage. Thus, the net loss of\nmore than one million manufacturing jobs since 1985 has produced an\nestimated net loss of dependent workers' coverage for at least 157,000\nworkers employed in other industries.

For every hundred large-firm workers in 1991,\nnearly ten workers in smaller firms were covered as dependents.\nSimilar to the net loss of exported coverage associated with the loss of\nemployer-insured jobs in some industries, the downsizing of large U.S. firms\napparently has also contributed to the erosion of coverage among workers\nand dependents since 1985. Further growth in small firms is unlikely to\nproduce offsetting increases in coverage for workers and their families,\nabsent government action requiring significant employer contributions to\ncoverage.

Net tax subsidy rates are calculated in each sector as the number of\nworkers in another sector that employers cover as dependents, net of\nimported coverage, per the number of workers covered within the sector as\nthe primary beneficiary. Obviously, sectors with both a high rate of covered\nworkers and a high self-imposed net tax bear the largest total burden to\nsupport dependent workers employed in other sectors.\nAmong the industry groups, the highest rates of effective taxation on\nhealth insurance benefits offered to workers occur in mining (35 percent)\nand manufacturing (20 percent), as well as in transportation, communica-\ntions, and public utilities (23 percent). In addition, these industry groups\nhave relatively high rates of covered workers, resulting in a disproportion-\nate cost burden for them. Compared with all other industry groups, mining\nand manufacturing also have shown absolute loss of employment as well as\nthe fastest loss of insured jobs. Conversely, the greatest rates of subsidy are\nbeing collected by firms and workers in personal and entertainment services\n(72 percent) and by self-employed workers (141 percent)--both fast-grow-\ning sectors--as well as in retail trade (35 percent).\nThe magnitude of self-imposed taxation to support dependent workers\nalso is positively related to firm size.

In addition, the availability of these subsidies to some employers\nprobably deters other employers from providing health benefits to their\nworkers. That is, in industries that import substantial amounts of coverage,\nfirms that do not receive subsidies are best able to compete with firms that\nare subsidized only if they, too, do not offer coverage to their workers.\nCompetition does not allow employers in such an industry to consider\nwhether their workers are covered at all.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe erosion of employer-sponsored health insurance among American\nworkers and their families is significant. The loss of employer-insured jobs\nin one sector affects coverage in others as dependents' coverage also is lost.\nMajor industry groups and small and large firms are strongly interdepend-\nent, in terms of the dependents' coverage imported from and exported to\nother sectors. It is notable that the industry groups that have actually lost\njobs since 1985, and at an even faster pace have lost employer-insured jobs,\nare among the strongest net exporters of dependent coverage to other\nindustry groups. Conversely, the rate of dependents' coverage imported by\nhigh-growth industries suggests that their growth has been encouraged by\nthe real subsidies provided to their workers in the form of such coverage.\nThese patterns offer little to support the belief that erosion of employer-\nbased coverage will reverse itself. The extraordinary growth of health care\ncosts--persistently and by wide margins exceeding the growth of prices and\nwages in all other sectors--implies an increasing burden on businesses that\nprovide health insurance benefits to their workers. As the subsidies pro-\nvided to other-industry workers in the form of dependents' coverage also\nbecome more burdensome, the propensity to offer family coverage or any\ncoverage at all to one's own workers declines.\nAggressive government action to curb the growth of health care costs\nmay stem the further erosion of employer-based coverage among workers\nand their families. However, it is unclear whether that action alone would\nbe sufficient to reverse the loss of insured jobs that is being driven by\ncompetition. Nevertheless, failure to act seems virtually certain to encour-\nage continued loss of employer-based coverage among American workers,\nas well as the loss of total employment in sectors that tax themselves to\nsupport coverage of dependent workers employed eslewhere.\nThe opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of\nthe Center for Risk Management and Insurance Research, its associates, or its sponsors.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
