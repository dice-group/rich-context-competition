Researchers have found that the relationship between strain and emotions sometimes\ndiffer by sex. We argue that gender identity, or how masculine or feminine individuals view\nthemselves, offer an additional explanation of emotional reactions to strain rather than focusing\non sex differences alone. Using a subsample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health), we examine the direct effects of gender identity on negative emotions and\nthe conditioning effects of masculinity and femininity on the relationship between strain and nega-\ntive emotions. Our results indicate that gender identity is important for explaining the effect of strain\non anger for males and females. Gender identity plays less of a role in explaining depression,\nhowever. These findings support the inclusion of gender identity when explaining gender differences\nin a general strain theory context.\nA consistent finding in criminology is that males offend more frequently and commit more\nserious offenses than females (Steffensmeier et al. 2005). One prominent theory that is well sui-\nted to explain the gender gap in offending is general strain theory (GST). The core idea of GST\nis that when people experience strain, they then experience negative emotions such as anger and\ndepression that may be alleviated through legitimate or illegitimate coping techniques depending\non characteristics of the individual and the environment (Agnew 2006).\nGender differences in emotional reactions to strain may thus be a key explanation as to why\nmales offend more frequently than females (Broidy and Agnew 1997). Anger has been found to\nbe the salient emotion in explaining criminal behavior (Baron 2007; Piquero and Sealock 2004)\nwhile the effect of depression on crime is inconsistent (Broidy 2001; De Coster and Zito 2010;\nPiquero and Sealock 2004). Presumably, anger motivates actors to respond to strain aggressively\nwhile depression encourages withdrawing, escapist, and=or self-destructive behaviors (Agnew\nmales are more likely to experience outer-directed emotions such as anger while females\nexperience high levels of both anger and inner-directed emotions such as depression, then gender\ndifferences in crime and deviant behavior may be explained through gender differences in the\nAddress correspondence to Shelley Keith, Department of Sociology, Mississippi State University, PO Box C,\nMississippi State, MS 39762, USA.

However, the research is mixed with some studies finding that males\nand females respond to strain with similar emotions (Jennings et al. 2009; Kaufman 2009;\nexpected gender differences in the experience of emotions or mixed support (Broidy 2001;\nExplaining why some studies find sex similarities in emotional reactions to strain while others\nfind sex differences may be crucial to explaining why males offend more frequently than\nfemales. We seek to explain these mixed findings by examining how gender identity (i.e.,\nhow masculine or feminine individuals view themselves) affects emotional reactions to strain.\nMost gender and GST studies examine differences in strain, emotions, and criminal behavior\nby comparing separate models by sex. However, these studies do not take into account the\ndegree to which males and females identify with feminine and masculine traits but rather assume\nthat gender socialization affects individuals similarly (De Coster and Zito 2010; Hay 2003).\nWhile femininity and masculinity may be correlated with biological sex due to gender based\nsocialization, some individuals may identify with both masculine and feminine characteristics,\nwhile others may identify only with traits of the opposite sex (Horwitz and White 1987). We\nassert that gender identity will affect emotional reactions to strain and these effects will be\nsimilar for males and females.\nSpecifically, we argue that those who identify with a masculine gender identity should be\nmore likely to experience anger as a result of strain while those who identify with a feminine\ngender identity should be more likely to experience depression as a result of strain. It is impor-\ntant to examine how gender identity affects reactions to strain rather than assuming that males\ninternalize only masculine characteristics while females internalize only feminine characteristics.\nBy examining how masculinity and femininity moderate the effect of strain on negative\nemotions, we hope to shed light on the mixed findings in previous GST and gender studies.\nTo examine these arguments, we use a subsample from Waves III and IV of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).\nAccording to general strain theory (GST), people are pressured into crime through strain or\n``. . . events or conditions that are disliked by individuals'' (Agnew 2006:4). Strains include\nthose that hinder goal achievement, result in the loss of something positively valued, and those\nthat include negative treatment by others (Agnew 1992). Failure to achieve positively valued\ngoals may include having less money, status, or autonomy than is desired. The loss of something\nvalued may include property or money that is stolen, death of someone close to the individual, or\na breakup of a romantic relationship. Finally, negative treatment by others may include victimi-\nzation; negative relationships with parents, teachers, and friends; and other stressful life events\nAgnew (1992, 2006) asserts that strain produces negative emotions such as anger and\ndepression and these emotions create pressure in the individual that needs to be alleviated.\nThe negative emotions that follow strain have a mediating effect which increases the likelihood\nmore salient for crime than other negative emotions because it motivates individuals to take\naction, increases the justifications for crime, instigates a desire for revenge, and inhibits rational\nthought (Agnew 1992, 2006). Anger, an outer-directed emotion, has been found to be related to\naggression and other outwardly-directed behaviors, while inner-directed emotions such as\ndepression have a stronger effect on withdrawing behaviors (Ganem 2010; Jang and Johnson\nnot everyone will respond to strain with negative emotions and=or crime. Most people find\nnoncriminal ways to cope with strain depending on a variety of characteristics of individuals\nand the environment such as their coping skills, social support networks, level of conventional\nbonds, criminal behavior of peers, and the benefits and ease of committing crime (Agnew 2006).\nWe argue that gender identity is a neglected conditioning variable that may also explain how\nindividuals react to strain.\nBroidy and Agnew (1997) provide the foundation for explaining the gender gap in offending\nfrom a GST framework. First, they suggest that one might think that males are subject to more\nstrain although they point out that the stress literature does not support this proposition. In\naddition, recent studies confirm that females experience as much or more strain than males\n2009). Rather, the gender gap in offending may better be explained by differences in the types\nof strain and susceptibility to these strains with males experiencing more crime producing strain\nsuch as financial strain, peer problems, and criminal victimization and females experiencing\nmore relationship-based strain (Broidy and Agnew 1997; Cheung and Cheung 2010; De Coster\nRelationship-based strain such as caring for family increase attachment to conventional others\nand reduce the opportunities and benefits for females to commit crime, while concerns over\nmaterial success and victimization may increase the desire and opportunity for criminal coping\namong males. Not all studies find gender differences in strain, however, with some studies\nfinding that males and females experience similar strains reacting in similar ways (Baron\nnumerous studies suggest that males and females experience different types of strain with males\nexperiencing strain more likely to lead to crime with some exceptions.\nBecause differences in the type of strain alone cannot fully explain the gender gap in offend-\ning, Broidy and Agnew (1997) suggest that general strain theorists might argue that differences\nin emotional responses to strain affect offending. Specifically, males may be more likely to\noffend because they become angrier as a result of strain while females experience more\ndepression. However, Broidy and Agnew (1997) and others challenge this line of thought\nfinding that females are just as angry as males if not more angry (Mirowsky and Ross 2003).\nSome evidence suggests males experience anger uniquely based on their gender such that\nwhen males are angry they blame others and worry less about hurting others' feelings and thus\nuse anger to demonstrate their masculinity (Broidy and Agnew 1997; Campbell 1993). Females,\non the other hand, may experience crime-suppressing emotions such as depression and guilt in\nblame themselves and feel expressing their anger is inappropriate, they should be less likely\nto act out their feelings, thus coping with these negative emotions in more self-destructive ways\nsuch as eating disorders (Sharp, Brewster, and Love 2005).\nAs expected, many studies find that strain leads to anger for both males and females (Hay\n2004; Sigfusdottir et al. 2008). Some studies find that anger reactions to strain vary by sex\nbut no clear patterns emerge as to which types of strain are more likely to affect anger for males\naddition, the relationship between strain and depression is less clear with many studies finding\nsex similarities rather than differences (Jang and Johnson 2005; Kaufman 2009; Moksnes et al.\nfor males (Piquero and Sealock 2004; Sharp et al. 2005). However, some studies find that as\nexpected females are more vulnerable to depression than males (De Coster 2005; Drapela\net al. 2008). Finally, some studies confirm that females experience outer-directed and\ninner-directed emotions simultaneously (De Coster and Zito 2010; Hay 2003) although not all\nstudies find sex differences in the co-occurrence of emotions (Sigfusdottir and Silver 2009).\nIn sum, the literature shows that females are just as likely to experience anger as a result of\nstrain although some studies find that this relationship depends on the type of strain. The evi-\ndence is less clear for sex differences in internalizing emotional reactions to strain and the\nco-occurrence of emotions. Therefore, it is important to examine factors that affect emotional\nreactions to strain beyond biological sex differences to explain these mixed findings. This study\nhopes to fill the gap in the literature through examining how gender identity affects the relation-\nship between strain and negative emotions.\nFinally, Broidy and Agnew (1997) argue that the gender gap in offending may be explained\nby differences in key conditioning variables that affect how males and females respond to strain\nand=or negative emotions. Specifically, while males and females may experience similar types\nof strain and=or negative emotions, factors such as coping resources, peers, and dispositions\ntowards crime may influence how individuals cope with strain and negative emotions. Some\nevidence supports that females benefit more from coping resources than males (Cheung and\nIn contrast, the relationship between strain and crime has been found to be stronger for males\nwho have deviant attitudes, low self-esteem, deviant peers, and attribute strain to causes outside\nof their control (Baron 2007). When females have deviant attitudes and peers, they are also more\nsusceptible to criminal coping as a result of strain (Baron 2007). In addition, Kort-Butler (2009)\nfinds mixed support for gender differences in coping with most of her findings supporting\ngender similarities.\nTo summarize, Broidy and Agnew (1997) provide a strong foundation for explaining the\ngender gap in offending from a general strain theory framework. While some support has been\nfound for gender differences in strain and negative emotions, many studies find that males and\nfemales experience similar types of strains and that the relationship between strain and negative\nemotions operates similarly for males and females. Differences in coping resources provide one\narea that may explain how males and females can experience similar strain but differ in emotion-\nal responses. Broidy and Agnew (1997) suggest that one crucial conditioning variable that may\nexplain differences in negative emotions is gender socialization or gender identity. Below we\ndescribe how this key neglected moderating variable may explain these mixed findings.\nMost studies that focus on sex differences in negative emotions and=or crime assume that gender\nsocialization accounts for differences in reactions to strain but data limitations preclude\nto the literature by including a measure of gender identity that ``refers to how individuals relate\nto masculine and feminine qualities'' (Horwitz and White 1987:159). Gender identity is\ndeveloped through socialization where children at a young age are taught appropriate gender\nroles and what it means to be a male or female (Bem 1981; Broderick and Korteland 2002).\nMales are typically socialized to embody masculine traits such as being assertive, independent,\ncompetitive, and physically and emotionally strong. Females, on the other hand, are socialized to\nbe warm, nurturing, and compassionate (Horwitz and White 1987). Gender identity is typically\nmeasured through respondents indicating whether they view certain traits as describing them-\nselves (Bem 1974). The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) was developed to capture the two\nfacets of gender identity and remains a commonly used scale in sociology and psychology to\nassess levels of emotions (Kinney, Smith, and Donzella 2001; Kogut, Langley, and O'Neal\npard and Paisley 1987), although only one study focused on general strain theory (Ganem 2010).\nMasculine qualities are more compatible with anger and criminal behavior while feminine\ncharacteristics such as being compassionate, passive, dependent, and emotionally and physically\nweak align more with inner-directed emotions and behaviors such as depression and\nStrough et al. 2007). As reviewed above, however, males do become depressed and females\ndo become angry and both sexes may respond with internalizing and externalizing behavior.\nTherefore, these inconclusive findings may better be explained by gender identification rather\nthan sex alone since some males may subscribe to feminine qualities while some females\nmay relate more closely with masculine qualities (Horwitz and White 1987). ``Therefore, to\nthe extent that gender identities are related to styles of pathology, we would expect a tendency\nfor males with feminine identities to develop internalized styles of distress and females with\nmasculine identities to engage in acting out behaviors'' (Horwitz and White 1987:159).\nA number of studies examine the direct relationship between gender identity and deviance\nfinding evidence that masculinity increases outer-directed behaviors while femininity reduces\n2010). Most studies that quantitatively assess the relationship between gender identity and anger\nfind that those who are more masculine report higher levels of anger while identification with\nfemininity reduces angry emotions (Kinney et al. 2001; Kogut et al. 1992; Kopper and Epperson\n1991) with limited exception (Ganem 2010). It is important to note that in most cases gender\nidentity affects anger while sex is unrelated. These patterns hold regardless of how gender ident-\nity is measured. For example, some studies measured gender identity using the shortened Bem\n1996; Nofziger 2010) similar to this study, while others relied on the Personal Attributes Ques-\ntionnaire assessing stereotypical feminine and masculine traits (Horwitz and White 1987), and\nothers used a measure including stereotypical gender roles and traits (Heimer 1996; Heimer\nand De Coster 1999). Given these findings, we predict a direct relationship between gender\nidentity and anger such that higher levels of masculinity should lead to more anger while higher\nlevels of femininity should lead to less anger. While biological sex may be correlated with gen-\nder identity, `` . . . the content of gender role orientation, rather than the degree of congruence\nbetween one's biological sex and gender role orientation, influences mental health'' (Barrett\nand White 2002:465). Thus, we expect these relationships to hold regardless of biological\nsex. We propose the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1A: Those who are higher in masculinity should be more likely to experience anger\nthan those who are lower in masculinity.\nHypothesis 1B: Those who are higher in femininity should be less likely to experience anger than\nthose who are lower in femininity.\nIn addition, some evidence suggests that those who are high in femininity and=or low in\nmasculinity are more likely to experience depression (Barrett and White 2002; Van Gundy\n2002). Overall, the research shows strong support for masculinity reducing depression with these\nrelationships holding regardless of biological sex (Barrett and White 2002; Horwitz and White\n2002). The effect of femininity on depression is less consistent, however, with numerous studies\nfinding that higher levels of femininity decrease depressed emotions contrary to theoretical expec-\ntations (Stoppard and Paisley 1987). Based on the extant literature and theoretical assumptions in\nthe mental health literature, we expect that higher levels of masculinity will reduce depression\nwhile higher levels of femininity will increase this negative emotion and that this relationship\nshould operate similarly for males and females. Therefore, we propose the following:\nHypothesis 2A: Those who are higher in masculinity should be less likely to experience depression\nthan those who are lower in masculinity.\nHypothesis 2B: Those who are higher in femininity should be more likely to experience depression\nthan those who are lower in femininity.\nWhile most studies show the important role that masculinity and femininity play in directly\nimpacting negative emotions, few studies have examined the assumption that gender identity\nbuffers the effect of stress on anger and depression and none within a general strain theory\nGundy 2002). The underlying assumptions are that anger and depression result from stress\nand, by extension, gender identity buffers the effect of stress on these outcomes. Specifically,\nboth masculinity and femininity may provide advantages after stressful events. Highly\nmasculine individuals may be less likely to become depressed after experiencing strain but these\ncharacteristics might influence angry reactions to strain. In contrast, those who are highly femi-\nnine may feel that anger is an inappropriate response to stress but may become depressed. When\nthe interactions are examined, the findings provide somewhat mixed support for this idea. For\nexample, Van Gundy (2002) does not find support that autonomy serves as a protective factor\nagainst stressful events on depression contrary to expectations. In addition, Stoppard and Paisley\n(1987) find that neither masculinity nor femininity affected the relationship between stress and\ndepression. Priess et al. (2009) find that masculinity reduces depression but only at lower and\nmedium levels of stress. In addition, Broderick and Korteland (2002) find that male and female\nparticipants who identified themselves as more feminine rather than masculine were more likely\nto report rumination or coping with problems through worrying or thinking about them. While\nfew studies have tested the moderating effect of gender identity on negative emotions especially\non anger, based on the mental health literature, we expect the following relationships:\nHypothesis 3A: Those who are higher in masculinity should be more likely to experience anger as a\nresult of strain than those who are lower in masculinity.\nHypothesis 3B: Those who are higher in femininity should be less likely to experience anger as a\nresult of strain than those who are lower in femininity.\nHypothesis 4A: Those who are higher in masculinity should be less likely to experience depression\nas a result of strain than those who are lower in masculinity.\nHypothesis 4B: Those who are higher in femininity should be more likely to experience depression\nas a result of strain than those who are lower in femininity.\nThe data analyzed for this study come from a subsample of respondents from Waves III and IV\nof the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a nation-\nschool year. A smaller cohort of 20,745 adolescents completed more in-depth in-home inter-\nviews and were interviewed at each successive wave of data collection (Harris et al. 2003).\nA unique characteristic of the third wave of Add Health is that a subsample of respondents\nwere asked to provide detailed information regarding their romantic relationships. One half of\nthe original sample was randomly selected to be considered for the ``Couple Sample.'' The final\nsubsample included only those remaining respondents who had been in a current relationship for\nmore than three months with a person of the opposite sex who was over the age of 18. This final\nsubsample included 4,203 of the more than 15,000 respondents who participated in Wave III.\nWe use the Couple Sample in our analyses because they were asked a reduced version of the\nBem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), which we use to measure gender identity (described below).1\n1One potential concern is that the Couple Sample differs in some important way from the full sample related to the\nkey independent and dependent variables. Supplemental analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between\nthe two samples on the dependent variables. A few differences emerged with regard to strain. In general, the Couple\nSample experienced slightly less strain with the exception of childhood victimization. Unfortunately, differences in\ngender identity cannot be determined because the questions were only asked of the Couple Sample. Given that this study\nfocuses on a non-representative subsample, the results should be viewed as exploratory rather than being generalizable.\nThe remaining variables including our dependent, independent, and control variables come from\nWave IV.2 Approximately 87% (3,664) of the Couple Sample participated in Wave IV of Add\ndescriptive statistics).\nDependent Variables\nEmotions\nOur key dependent variables include the trait emotions of anger and depressed mood. Agnew\n(1992) argues that state emotions or specific emotions that arise as a result of strain are more\nimportant for how individuals cope with strain. Due to data limitations, we rely on trait emotions\nor dispositions towards anger and depression. Trait-based emotions should affect how indivi-\nduals react to strain, however, such that someone who is high in trait anger or depression should\nbe more likely to become angry or depressed in specific stressful situations (Hay 2003).\nFor our first dependent variable, anger, respondents indicated how much they agree with each\nstatement about them as they generally are now, not as they wish to be in the future (Harris et al.\n2003). Anger was created by summing the responses to the following four statements: ``I rarely\nget irritated,'' ``I keep my cool,'' ``I get angry easily,'' and ``I lose my temper.'' Responses for\nthe latter two items listed were reverse coded. Responses to each of these items ranged from 1\n(strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), with a higher score indicating a higher level of trait\nFor the second measure of emotions, we relied upon a shortened version of the Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D was created to focus on\ndepressed moods in the general population rather than on clinical depression (Radloff 1977).\nDepressed mood includes five items that measure sadness, trouble concentrating, trouble shaking\noff the blues, feeling depressed, and things bothering the respondent more than usual during the\npast seven days. Responses for each of the items included: never or rarely (0), sometimes (1), a\nlot of the time (2), and most of the time or all of the time (3). In order to reduce skewness, we\ntook the natural log of respondents' summated score on this scale. A higher score on the\ndepression scale reflected a higher degree of depression (a \u00bc .79).\nIndependent Variables\nStrain\nWe examine several different types of strain because recent research indicates that males and\nfemales are vulnerable to different kinds of stress (De Coster 2005; Kort-Butler 2009). Our first\nmeasure of strain was included to capture subjective strain which refers to individual appraisals\n2All of our measures, except for gender identity, race, and ethnicity come from Wave IV of Add Health. While we\nwould prefer to conduct longitudinal analyses using independent variables from Wave III predicting outcomes at Wave\nIV in order to better establish causality, not all of the strain measures were available in the Wave III data. In addition, six\nyears elapsed between the administration of Waves III and IV which would hinder our claims of causality rather than\nsupport them.\nof events or conditions (Agnew 2006). We include four items from the Perceived Stress Scale\nassessing how often in the past 30 days respondents have felt unable to control the important\nthings in their life, they felt confident they could handle personal problems (reverse-coded), they\nfelt things were going their way (reverse-coded), and they felt that difficulties were piling up so\nhigh they could not overcome them (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein 1983). A higher score\nindicated higher levels of perceived stress with 0 signifying that respondents never perceived any\nof these strains in the past 30 days and 16 reflecting that all of these strains were experienced\nvery often in the past 30 days (a \u00bc .73).\nThe second measure of strain, childhood history of abuse by caregivers, was constructed by\ncombining measures of the level of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse inflicted by parents\nbefore the child reached their 18th birthday. Each item was coded as follows: (0) this never hap-\npened, (1) one time, (2) two times, (3) three to five times, (4) six to 10 times, and (5) more than\n10 times and then summed to indicate higher levels of a history of abuse (a \u00bc .53).\nThe third measure of strain was a composite scale intended to measure whether respondents\nhad been a victim of a property or violent crime in the past 12 months. One item assessed\nwhether respondents had something taken from them worth $50 or more while the other four\nitems assessed whether they had been threatened with a weapon, shot or stabbed, or physically\nvictimized without a weapon. The final scale ranged from 0 to 5 with 5 indicating respondents\nexperienced all of these victimizations in the past year (a \u00bc .63).\nThe fourth scale was constructed to measure economic strain and assessed whether respon-\ndents had difficulty paying for basic living expenses during the previous 12 months. Specifi-\ncally, respondents indicated whether they were without phone service, did not pay the full\namount of the rent or mortgage, were evicted from their residence, or did not pay the full amount\nof the gas, electricity, or oil bill because they did not have enough money and if they had the\nservice turned off by the gas or electric company, or the oil company would not deliver because\npayments were not made. The summated scale ranged from 0 indicating the respondent did not\nexperience any of these problems in the past year to 5 indicating the respondent had all of these\nfinancial difficulties during the past year (a \u00bc .69).\nFor the final measure of strain, romantic strain, respondents answered a series of questions on\nthe quality of their current relationship or if not currently in a relationship, with their most recent\nrelationship. Specifically, respondents were asked to respond to how much they agree or\ndisagree with the following statements, ``We (enjoy=enjoyed) doing even ordinary, day-to-day\nthings together,'' ``I (am=was) satisfied with the way we handle our problems and disagree-\nments,'' ``I (am=was) satisfied with the way we handle family finances,'' ``My partner\n(listens=listened) to me when I need someone to talk to,'' ``My partner (expresses=expressed) love\nand affection to me,'' ``I (am=was) satisfied with our sex life,'' and ``I (trust=trusted) the partner to\nbe faithful.'' Responses were summed so that a higher score indicated they disagreed with these\nstatements and that they experience or experienced higher levels of romantic strain within the\nrelationship (a \u00bc .89).\nBem Sex Role Inventory\nGender identity was measured using the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). We include two\nseparate measures of gender identity, masculinity and femininity because they represent two dis-\ntinct traits without the expectation that they are highly inversely correlated (Bem 1974; Strough\net al. 2007). We utilize the short form of the BSRI from Wave III of Add Health, which includes\n10 items for the masculinity scale and 10 for the femininity scale (Campbell, Gillaspy, and\nThompson 1997). Respondents were asked to rate on a seven-point scale how often each\nmasculine and feminine characteristic was true for him or her. Responses to the questions range\nfrom (1) never or almost never true to (7) always or almost always true. The masculinity scale\nincluded the following items: ``I defend my own beliefs,'' ``I am independent,'' ``I am assert-\nive,'' ``I have a strong personality,'' ``I am forceful,'' ``I have leadership abilities,'' ``I am will-\ning to take risks,'' ``I am dominant,'' ``I am willing to take a stand,'' and ``I am aggressive''\n(a \u00bc .81). The femininity scale included the following items: ``I am affectionate,'' ``I am\nsympathetic,'' ``I am sensitive to the needs of others,'' ``I am understanding,'' ``I am\ncompassionate,'' ``I am eager to soothe hurt feelings,'' ``I am warm,'' ``I am tender,'' ``I love\nchildren,'' and ``I am gentle'' (a \u00bc .91). Both scales range from 10 indicating all 10 traits were\nnever or almost never true for the respondent to 70 indicating the respondent reported that all 10\ncharacteristics of that gender identity was always or almost always true for him or her.\nOur measures of masculinity and femininity were taken from Wave III while most of our\nindependent and dependent variables were taken from Wave IV. One concern is that levels of\nfemininity and masculinity may change during this six-year time period. Evidence shows, however,\nthat masculinity and femininity are relatively stable over time (Bem 1974) although there is some\nevidence that males and females become more feminine as they age (Hyde, Krajnik, and Skuldt-\nNierderberger 1991). Not all studies find that men change in masculinity over time or that females\nchange in femininity over time, however (Priess et al. 2009; Strough et al. 2007). In addition, levels\nof masculinity and femininity may increase during adolescence (Barrett and White 2002) with the\ndifferences reaching a peak by the end of high school (Eme 1984). In Wave III, respondents ranged\nin age from 18 to 28 during a period when gender identity has started to stabilize (Barrett and White\n2002). Evidence also shows that gender identity may be affected by factors such as socioeconomic\nstatus and changes in life events such as marriage and child rearing (Kasen et al. 2006; Roberts,\nHelson, and Klohnen 2002). We include these relevant controls in our analyses.\nControl Variables\nWe include a number of control variables because they may affect the experience of negative\nemotions such as demographic characteristics, experience with the criminal justice system, level\nof self-control, and family life (Ganem 2010; Simon and Nath 2004). We also control for factors\nthat may be associated with gender identity such as socioeconomic status, marriage, and having\nchildren so that we may take into account any spurious correlations between gender identity and\nnegative emotions.\nDemographics\nRespondents provided their race, ethnicity, and age. Race was coded as a series of dummy\nvariables including ``black or African American,'' ``American Indian or Native American,''\nand ``Asian or Pacific Islander'' with white as the reference category.3 We include a separate\n3For respondents who indicated they belonged to more than one racial category, we coded their answer to reflect the\ncategory they felt best described their racial background (which was asked in a subsequent question).\nvariable indicating whether respondents reported being of Hispanic ethnicity (coded as 1 or 0\notherwise). We used respondents' birth date and the date of the interview to calculate their exact\nage at the time of the Wave IV Add Health interview.\nSocioeconomic Status\nSocioeconomic status included three separate measures: personal yearly income, subjective\nperceptions of class position, and highest level of education attained given that these measures\nwere not highly correlated (see Appendix A). Respondents were asked to choose a category\nwhich best fit the total dollar amount they had earned in wages=salaries, tips, bonuses, and over-\ntime pay, and=or in income from self-employment in the previous fiscal year. They could choose\n$30,000 where the size of the income between categories increased. This strategy resulted in\na normally distributed personal income measure. To assess the effect of respondents' subjective\nperceptions of their social class position, we also created a variable using data from a question in\nwhich respondents were instructed to ``think of [a] ladder as representing where people stand in\nthe United States. At the top of the ladder (step 10) are the people who have the most money and\neducation, and the most respected jobs. At the bottom of the ladder (step 1) are the people who\nhave the least money and education, and the least respected jobs or no job'' and indicate where\nthey would place themselves on that ladder relative to other people in the United States. Finally,\nrespondents indicated their highest level of education ranging from 1 (8th grade or less) to 8\n(completed a doctoral degree).4\nCriminal Justice Involvement\nTo measure criminal justice system involvement, we created a variable that represented\nwhether respondents' had ever been arrested in their lifetime.\nSelf-Control\nWe created a five-item scale to measure respondents' level of self-control. For the items\non this index, respondents indicated on a scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly\ndisagree) how much they agreed with the following statements: ``I am not interested in other\npeople's problems,'' ``I go out of my way to avoid having to deal with problems in my life,''\n``when making a decision, I go with my `gut feeling' and don't think much about the\nconsequences of each alternative,'' ``I like to take risks,'' and ``I live my life without much\nthought for the future.'' Scores ranged from 5 to 25 with a higher number indicating higher\nlevels of self-control (a \u00bc .55).\n4The exact scale for education included 8th grade or less (1); some high school (2); high school graduate (3); some or\ncompleted vocational or technical training (4); some college (5); completed college (6); some graduate school, completed\nmaster's degree, some graduate training beyond master's degree, some or completed post baccalaureate professional\neducation, (7); doctoral degree (8).\nReligious Involvement\nWe created a two-item composite scale to measure religious involvement. The first item\nmeasures how often respondents attended religious worship services in the past year and the\nsecond item measures how often they attended other activities at a religious institution. For both\nitems, responses ranged from 0 (never) to 5 (more than once a week). The scale was summed\nsuch that a 0 indicated that respondents never attended services or other activities with 10\nindicated they attended both more than once a week.\nRelationship and Parental Status\nWe created a dummy variable that indicates if the respondent was currently in\na marriage or not (1 \u00bc married; 0 \u00bc not currently married). Finally, we included a variable\nthat indicated whether or not respondents had at least one living biological child.5 Those\nwho had at least one child were coded ``1'' and those who did not were coded ``0.''\nFinally, we include a variable indicating whether someone has ever cohabitated coded\nas ``1'' or ``0'' otherwise.\nAnalytical Strategy\nFollowing the work of others examining gender differences in GST (e.g., Jang 2007;\nKaufman 2009; Piquero and Sealock 2004), we began our analyses by testing for mean\ndifferences (or proportions if the variables were dichotomous) by gender in our primary\nindependent, dependent, and control variables using independent samples t-tests (see\nTable 1). We then conducted a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models\npredicting negative emotions (see Tables 2 and 3). In Tables 2 and 3, Model 1, we present\nthe direct effects of the strain and the control variables on negative emotions separately\nfor males and females. Using stepwise procedures, we added the gender identity variables\nin Model 2. We relied on the procedure recommended by Paternoster et al. (1998) to test\nfor significant differences in regression coefficients between models. Next we examined\nthe effects of the two-way interactions between strain and gender identity predicting\nnegative emotions entering one interaction in the model at a time for males and females.\nThese models (not shown to conserve space) include all independent and control variables.\nWe present the coefficients for the interaction terms for these models in Table 4 and 5\nas well as the conditional effects when the interactions were significant. In order to\nexamine the nature of each interaction, we assess the effect of strain on negative emotions\nat different values of masculinity and femininity.6\n5Unfortunately, respondents were only asked about biological children although stepchildren may be equally\nimportant.\n6When interaction terms were significant, we calculated the standard errors at each level of gender identity with the\nstatistics are computed with the following formula: t \u00bc (b1 \u00fe b3 \u00c2 X2)=S(b1 \u00fe b3 \u00c2 X2).\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Results\nResults from the tests for mean differences show significant differences between males\nand females with regard to negative emotions, strain, and gender identity (see Table 1). As found\nin the mental health literature, females reported higher levels of anger and depression than males.\nIn addition, females reported higher levels of perceived stress and childhood abuse while males\nreported significantly more criminal victimization than females. While females experience more\neconomic strain than males, the difference did not reach conventional statistical significance.\nTurning to our key moderating variables, females reported significantly higher levels of\nDescriptive Statistics for Variables\nFull Sample Males Females\nN Mean SD Min Max N Mean SD Min Max N Mean SD Min Max\nNegative Emotions\nStrain\nGender Identity\nControl Variables\nReligious\nInvolvement\n\u00c3p < .05. \u00c3\u00c3p < .01. \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3p < .001 denote significant gender comparison with two-tailed t-tests.\nfemininity than males. Males and females did not significantly differ in their levels of masculinity.\nNext we examine the direct effects of our key variables as well as the moderating effects of gender\nidentity on the relationship between strain and negative emotions.\nRegression Results\nDirect Effects of Strain and Gender Identity on Negative Emotions\nAnger. As shown in Table 2, Model 1, perceived stress and history of abuse by caregivers\nhad a positive effect on anger for both males and females. Criminal victimization had significant\nAnger Regressed on Strain, Gender Identity, and Control Variables\nMales Females Males Females\nb SE b SE b SE b SE\nStrain\nGender Identity\nControl Variables\nNote.

Romantic strain leads to anger for females but not for males. In the second\nmodel including the direct effects of gender identity, our results show that masculinity had a\npositive effect on anger, while femininity had a negative effect on anger for both males and\nfemales confirming Hypotheses 1A and 1B. In sum, very few sex differences exist with regard\nto the effect of strain and gender identity on anger.\nA few of the control variables affected anger when examining Model 2. For males, whites\nwere more likely to report being angry than blacks or Asians and those who were higher in self-\ncontrol reported lower levels of anger for both sexes. In addition, females who were more\ninvolved in religious activities reported lower levels of anger. Finally, females who were\ncurrently married and those who had at least one child reported higher levels of anger than single\nor childless women. To summarize, as expected, strain leads to anger for both males and females\nindicating some sex similarities although some sex differences emerged depending on the type\nof strain. Gender identity operates as hypothesized with masculinity increasing anger and\nfemininity decreasing anger for both sexes. Gender identity appears to be especially important\nfor influencing anger among females given the larger increase in variance explained compared\nto the model for males.\nDepression. The results presented in Table 3, Model 1 indicate that perceived stress and\na history of abuse by caregivers have positive effects on depression for both males and females.\nConsistent with the argument that females respond to strain with depression more so than\nmales, criminal victimization and romantic strain lead to higher levels of depression for females\nonly. Recall that perceived stress, childhood abuse, and romantic strain lead to anger among\nfemales supporting the argument that females respond to strain with anger and depression\nsimultaneously.\nContrary to expectations, only femininity for females had a significant negative effect on\ndepression. Thus, gender identity does not affect depression for males and leads to a decrease\nin depression for highly feminine females. These results counter our second hypothesis (2B),\nwhich asserts that those who are higher in femininity will be more likely to experience\ndepression.\nVery few control variables affected depressed moods as shown in Model 2. Males and\nfemales who were higher in self-control were less likely to be depressed. Asian males were more\nlikely to report depression than white males. Females who had cohabitated were significantly\nmore likely to report depression than females who had not cohabitated.\nIn sum, sex similarities emerged in models predicting depression. Specifically, strains\nincreased depression for males and females although criminal victimization and romantic strain\nwas significant for females but not for males. In addition, gender identity plays little role\nin explaining depression and contrary to expectations, higher levels of femininity was related\nto lower levels of depression.\nEffects of the Interactions Between Strain and Gender Identity on\nNegative Emotions\nTo examine the potential moderating effects of gender identity, we ran separate regressions\nadding interaction terms one at time which included the strain and control variables.\nTables 4 and 5 include the coefficients for each significant interaction term that was regressed on\nanger. Depression was excluded from the tables given that none of the interactions were\nsignificant. We also display the slopes and significance levels of the effect of strain on anger\nat varying values of gender identity.\nThree of the interactions were significant for males when examining how masculinity\nconditions the relationship between strain and anger (see Table 4). The first significant\ninteraction shows that perceptions of stress have a stronger effect on anger as levels of\nmasculinity increase. At very low levels of masculinity perceived stress does not affect\nanger. A history of abuse by caregivers demonstrates a similar pattern with the effect of\nstrain on anger becoming stronger as masculinity increases. The slope becomes negative\nand insignificant at lower levels of masculinity indicating that history of abuse does not\nDepression Regressed on Strain, Gender Identity, and Control Variables\nMales Females Males Females\nb SE b SE b SE b SE\nStrain\nGender Identity\nControl Variables\nNote.

Males who score at the lowest levels\non masculinity are significantly less likely to respond to romantic strain with anger.\nRomantic strain is more likely to lead to anger for males who are high in masculinity.\nIn sum, as expected and in support of Hypothesis 3A, masculinity exacerbates the effects\nof most types of strain on anger for males.\nLimited support was found for the importance of masculinity for females with only two sig-\nnificant interaction terms. Our results indicate that females are less likely respond to economic\nstrain with anger when masculinity is low. While the pattern of the relationship is similar for\nfemales in that the coefficient becomes positive at higher levels of masculinity, the relationship\nbetween economic strain and anger is no longer significant at average and above average levels\nof masculinity. For romantic strain, masculinity exerts a significant positive effect on anger but\nonly at average and above average levels of masculinity. In summary, we find some support for\nHypothesis 3A that strain is more likely to lead to anger for those who are higher in masculinity\nand these relationships are similar for males and females.\nWe also found that femininity conditions the relationship between some types of strain\nand anger for males and females (see Table 5). For males, femininity exacerbates the effects\nof romantic strain on anger, with those who are very high in femininity being more likely\nto report anger as a result of this type of strain. Interestingly, those males who report low\nlevels of masculinity were significantly less likely to respond to romantic strain with anger.\nThis runs counter to our prediction that angry reactions to strain would be less likely among\nmales who were higher in femininity (Hypothesis 3B). Although contrary to our hypothesis,\nit may be that romantic strain is perceived as more severe for men higher in femininity,\nthus producing higher levels of anger. Levels of femininity did not affect the relationship\nbetween perceived stress, childhood abuse, criminal victimization, or economic strain for\nmales.\nThe patterns that emerged for the effect of strain on anger at higher levels of femininity were\ncontrary to expectations for females. We expected that anger would be less likely to result\nfrom strain when femininity was high. Two out of five interaction terms were significant\nincluding childhood abuse and economic strain. The effect of abuse on anger was only\nsignificant when femininity was very low and when it was very high. For those reporting\nextremely low levels of femininity, strain predicted significantly lower levels of anger. At the\nhighest levels of femininity those who had a more feminine gender identity were more likely\nto respond to this type of strain with anger than those who had a less feminine gender identity.\nThe effect of economic strain showed a similar pattern with those who reported lower\nthan average levels of femininity being less likely to respond to strain with anger. At above\naverage levels of femininity, economic strain did not affect anger. In sum, we find contrary support\nfor Hypothesis 3B for males and females.\nContrary to expectations, gender identity did not moderate the relationship between strain and\ndepression for males or females. In sum, gender identity has no effect on the relationship\nbetween strain and depression failing to support Hypotheses 4A and 4B. However, for males\nand females, masculinity serves to exacerbate the relationship between strain and anger\nsupporting Hypotheses 3A. In addition, while we expected that angry reactions to strain would\nbe incongruent for those high in femininity, we found that anger was more likely when\nfemininity was higher for males and females.\nInteraction Effects of Strain and Femininity on Anger\nMales Interaction Coef.\nMasculinity Level\nFemales\nNote.

The underlying assumption of many of these studies is\nthat gender socialization affects emotional reactions to strain. Specifically, it is assumed that\nmales internalize masculine characteristics which are congruent with anger. As a result, males\nare socialized to respond to strain with anger and subsequently engage in crime. Because females\nare socialized to be feminine, which includes characteristics that are inconsistent with anger, then\nguilt and depression should accompany anger which serves to inhibit criminal responses. The\npurpose of this study was to explicitly test whether gender socialization or internalization of\nmasculine and feminine traits affects emotional reactions to strain.\nFirst, we examined whether gender identity directly affects negative emotions. We find as\nexpected, masculinity increases the likelihood of anger while femininity decreases the likelihood\nof anger for males and females and these effects were especially important for females. These\nfindings indicate that how individuals are socialized whether masculine or feminine may be\nthe key to understanding gender differences in anger. To the extent that males subscribe to mas-\nculinity and females subscribe to femininity, differences in the experience of anger will emerge.\nWe know that anger is especially important for explaining crime (Baron 2007; Piquero and\nSealock 2004). In supplemental analyses we find that anger leads to violent crime for both males\nand females lending further support to the importance of establishing the cause of angry emotions.\nFuture research should incorporate gender identity as an important predictor of anger rather\nthan assuming that males identify as masculine while females identify as feminine. While\nbeyond the scope of this study, future research should examine the direct relationship between\ngender identity and offending. Through including this key variable, we may come one step\ncloser to explaining the gender gap in offending.\nWe find little support that gender identity plays an important role in directly affecting\ndepression. Contrary to expectations but consistent with some research (see Stoppard and\nPaisley 1987), higher levels of femininity result in lower levels of depression among females.\nThese findings contradict other studies that show that the absence or presence of masculinity\nis important for explaining depression (Barrett and White 2002; Horwitz and White 1987; Priess\net al. 2009). These contradictory findings may also be explained by the complex nature of femi-\nninity (Priess et al. 2009). A concern and sensitivity for others may reduce depression because\nthese qualities provide an avenue for social support. Future research should examine under what\nconditions levels of femininity serves as a resource versus a liability.\nFuture research needs to also assess other factors which may affect negative emotions such as\nthe presence or absence of delinquent peers and social support and other coping resources. One\nimportant avenue for future research is how gender identity attenuates the effect of biological sex\non negative emotions. In supplemental analyses, this study found that biological sex continued\nto significantly impact negative emotions independently of gender identity (see Appendix B).\nFemales experience more anger and depression than males controlling for strain, gender identity,\nand other possible correlates of negative emotions which contradicts some studies which find\nthat gender identity predicts emotions rather than biological sex (Kinney et al. 2001; Kopper\nNext we examined the interactions between gender identity and strain predicting anger and\ndepression. We find the most support for the conditioning effect of masculinity on the relation-\nship between strain and anger for both males and females. Several types of strain significantly\nincreased the likelihood of anger but only at average levels of masculinity and above. Strain did\nnot lead to anger or was less likely to lead to anger for males and females at lower than average\nlevels of masculinity. These findings may explain why sometimes males and females respond to\nanger similarly while other times sex differences emerge given that the relationship between\nstrain and anger clearly depends on masculinity rather than sex alone. In other words, to the\nextent that females are socialized to ascribe to fewer masculine traits, the effect of strain on anger\nshould be weaker than for males who do identify with masculine traits.\nIt is unclear why masculinity does not moderate the relationship between victimization and\neconomic strain and anger for males and perceived stress, childhood abuse, and victimization\nfor females. Data limitations may explain these results given that this study relies on trait emo-\ntions and strains that occurred at various times in the past. In addition, the type of emotional\nreaction may depend on the type of strain. Future studies should examine the moderating\nrelationship between strain and gender identity and a variety of negative emotions beyond anger\nand depression. It is interesting to note that economic strain did not directly affect anger for\nfemales and romantic strain did not directly affect anger for males. Rather, the effects of these\nstrains on anger depend on levels of masculinity. These findings may explain why the literature\nshows inconsistencies in how different types of strain differentially impact anger for males and\nfemales.\nOur findings were mostly contrary to expectations for the moderating effect of femininity on\nthe relationship between strain and anger for males and females. For romantic strain for males\nand for childhood abuse for females the effect of strain on anger increased at higher levels of\nfemininity. For romantic strain for males and economic strain for females, lower levels of\nfemininity reduced the effect of strain on anger. These seemingly contradictory findings may\nbe explained by the type of strain and how these relate to gender identity. First, we find that\nromantic strain leads to more anger at higher levels of femininity for males. Men who identify\nwith feminine characteristics may find romantic strain to be particularly severe and respond with\nhigher levels of anger than those who do not identify themselves as feminine. As a male, others\nwill view anger as an acceptable response to strain. In addition, childhood abuse may be viewed\nas higher in magnitude for females. Based on Chesney-Lind's (1989) work, being victimized by\ncaregivers may be especially traumatic for females. It may be that more feminine women experi-\nence this strain more intensely and therefore respond with higher levels of anger. While these\nstrains may lead to more anger among females, gender identity may inhibit the expression\nof these emotions. Finally, gender identity may shape perceptions of strain. For example, gender\nidentity may influence how severe or salient a strain is viewed which will then affect negative\nemotions. Future research should explore how gender identity affects emotional reactions to\nstrains paying particular attention to the salience for masculine and feminine identities. While\nbeyond the scope of this study, a next step would be to then examine how the experience of these\nemotions is expressed through either internalizing or externalizing behaviors.\nOverall, we find no support for the conditioning effects of gender identity on depression for\nmales and females. It is surprising that masculinity did not reduce the effect of strain on depression\ngiven prior research in the mental health literature demonstrating the importance of masculinity\nin reducing depressive symptoms (Barrett and White 2002). Future research should explore other\nfactors that may reduce depression for males and females when faced with strain. In this study,\ngender identification appears to be a relatively unimportant conditioning factor.\nFuture research should also examine different combinations of gender identity such as being\nhigh in both masculinity and femininity, being low in both traits, or being high in one while low\nin the other. Specifically, some research has shown that androgynous individuals or those\nwho are high in masculinity and femininity have different mental health outcomes from those\nwho are undifferentiated or low on both gender identities (Barrett and White 2002). While\nsupplemental analyses in this study did not reveal very many significant interactions\nbetween masculinity, femininity, and strain, researchers should continue to examine these dif-\nferent subgroups of individuals to determine how these gender identities modify the relationship\nbetween strain and negative emotions as well as between negative emotions and crime and\ndeviance.\nThis study is not without some limitations. First we were unable to conduct longitudinal\nanalyses. While we conducted our analyses on two waves of data, not all key variables were\nmeasured at both time periods in order to allow us to predict dependent variables at the second\ntime period. Also, our strain measures included reference periods that varied from current feel-\nings of stress to incidents that occurred in childhood. In addition, six years elapsed between the\ntwo waves which would weaken our arguments that strain affects negative emotions. Also, data\nlimitations required us to rely on trait emotions rather than state emotions. State emotions in\nresponse to particular strains should demonstrate the strongest test of general strain theory\n(Agnew 2006). The reliance on trait emotions may explain our weak findings related to\ndepression. In other words, feeling depressed as a result of a specific strain may be different from\nongoing depression. Future research should focus on longitudinal data collected during a\nrelatively short time period to fully examine how gender identity moderates the relationship\nbetween emotional reactions and strain.\nAnother way this research should be expanded is to focus on the experience of emotions\nrather than the expression of negative emotions. There is good reason to believe that males\nand females experience similar emotions but display rules determine how they choose to cope\nexperience anger and depression, according to expression rules surrounding masculinity, these\nindividuals may choose to engage in crime (De Coster and Zito 2010). Females who experience\nthese emotions may follow feminine defined expression rules coping with internalizing\nbehaviors. Therefore, future studies should examine the conditioning effect of gender identity\non behavioral outcomes such as crime, drug use, and self-destructive behaviors.\nRegardless of these possible limitations, this study has taken an important step in explaining a\nkey part of general strain theory, emotional reactions to strain. Rather than assuming that males\nand females are socialized to experience different emotions we directly test these ideas through\nincluding a measure of gender identity. Not only does gender identity directly affect emotions\nbut also masculinity and femininity affect emotional reactions to strain. Future research should\nbuild on this work including measures of gender identity when explicating the relationship\nbetween strain, negative emotions, and crime for males and females.\nShelley Keith, PhD, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at Mississippi\nState University.
