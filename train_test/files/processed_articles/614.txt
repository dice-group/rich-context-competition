In response to this, a vast number of prevention programs have been\ndeveloped and implemented in schools, municipal services, and health services.\nSymptoms of mental ill-health in children may be either externalizing or internalizing in\ncharacter. This distinction does not preclude that the same child may suffer from symptoms\nof both kinds, and that aggressive, acting-out behavior may indeed mask depressive\nfeelings and anxiety. Even so, externalizing and internalizing problems are usually\nunderstood in different etiological terms, and met with different intervention strategies.\nIn general, prevention programs targeting externalizing problems in children build on\nbehavioral and social learning principles. Major formats for delivery are parent training\nand school-based programs. Parent training programs aim to strengthen positive parenting\nand reduce coercion, which in turn will reinforce pro-social development in the child (e.g.\nDeGarmo et al. 2004). School-based prevention programs typically train children in self-\nregulation and social skills (e.g. Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group 1999), and/\nor train teachers in how to respond to acting-out children in ways that will promote positive\ndevelopment (e.g. Ialongo et al. 1999). School programs may be implemented in their own\nright, or as a complement to parent training, in a multimodal format (e.g. Eddy et al. 2003).\nThere are different strategies for delivery of prevention programs. Universal prevention\ntargets entire populations. Selective prevention is offered to sub-populations with known\nrisk factors, for instance children living in socio-economically disadvantaged neighbor-\nhoods, or children of parents with substance abuse. Notably, selective prevention is not\nbased on the assessed risk of the individual child. This is however the case for indicated\nprevention, which may be offered to children with, for example, elevated symptom levels.\nBecause of its focus on the individual, indicated prevention allows for tailoring the\nintervention to individual needs (Mrazek and Haggerty 1994).\nIn order to evaluate preventive effects, it is necessary to study what happens over time.\nTo determine if the intervention decreases the likelihood for the unwanted future outcome,\nfollow-up assessments, of both the intervention and the control group, are imperative.\nAccording to standards formulated by the Society for Prevention Research, the minimal\npost intervention interval before follow-up must be 6 months (Flay et al. 2005). Few\nprevention studies meet these standards. Typically, original studies as well as published\nsystematic reviews of prevention programs have focused on the immediate effects on child\nbehavior, measured directly post intervention.\nIn a systematic review of the effect of training programs for parents of children\n0\u00ad7 years, Kaminski et al. (2008) included 48 controlled studies. They found a stan-\ndardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.25, favoring intervention, from pre to post test.\nLundahl et al. (2006) included 63 controlled studies on parent training programs, and found\nthat the SMD was 0.42 post test, but decreased to 0.21 at follow-up, specified only as\n``months later''. Barlow and Parsons (2003) pooled five studies of training programs for\nparents of children age 0\u00ad3 years. The effect size was 0.44 for parental observations and\n0.55 for independent observers. However, only two studies had follow-up data, according\nto which positive effects diminished and became insignificant.\nThree systematic reviews have analyzed the effects of school-based interventions to\nprevent externalizing symptoms. Wilson and Lipsey (2007) conducted a broad meta-\nanalysis and included 249 studies, with no explicit criteria for study quality, and found an\neffect size of 0.21 for universal programs, 0.29 for selective programs and 0.05 (n.s.) for\nmultimodal programs, in a pre to post intervention test. Effects were largely the same for\nprograms implementing behavioral, cognitive, and social skills components. Hahn et al.\n(2007) found a 15 % reduction in acting-out behavior, when pooling twelve studies that\nhad externalizing problems as outcome measure. Effects at follow-up were not quantified\nbut were reported to decrease with time. Mytton et al. (2006) included 34 randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCT) fulfilling Cochrane quality criteria and targeting aggressive and\nviolent behavior. The post-test effect size was 0.41, with no tendency to decline in the\nseven studies that had a follow-up at 12 months.\nIt is striking that although a primary aim of most programs is to prevent serious\nexternalizing problems in adolescence by offering interventions to children of preschool or\nearly school age, none of the previous reviews have systematically investigated the lasting\neffects of these programs. Rather, the reviews, like the majority of the primary studies,\nfocus on pre- to post intervention effects, with unsystematic reporting of follow-up\nassessments, at best. Likewise, previous reviews have often summarized intervention\neffects, without distinguishing between prevention strategies, or between prevention and\nclinical treatment trials.\nAiming to fill this gap, and in accordance with the Society for Preventive Research\nguidelines, our systematic review had a firm focus on studies with a follow-up period of at\nleast 6 months post program termination. We also aimed to limit the review to prevention\nprograms, and exclude interventions offered to children seeking clinical treatment for\nmanifest problems. With this focus on preventive effects, the following research questions\nwere posed:\n\u00b7 Which programs are effective in preventing mental ill-health of the externalizing type?\n\u00b7 What is the relative effectiveness of universal, selective or indicated prevention\nprograms?\n\u00b7 Are there any risks involved in using the programs?\nThe present state of knowledge did not provide a basis for formulating testable\nhypotheses, and the review was therefor largely explorative. However, we did expect\nweaker evidence for effect when applying a 6 months follow-up criterion, as compared to\npost intervention tests. Also, in keeping with the prevention literature at large, we expected\nsmaller effect sizes for universal as compared to selective and indicated prevention trials.\nFor ethical reasons, we included a specific focus on possible negative intervention effects.\nMethods\nThe systematic review presented in this article is primarily based on a health technology\nassessment conducted by the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU),\nan independent public authority. The total assessment also included a systematic review of\nprograms to prevent internalizing symptoms (SBU 2010). The literature search included\nPubMed, PsycInfo, ERIC and IBSS databases and was supplemented with studies found in\nreference lists and web sites dedicated to some of the programs. The literature search for\nthe initial review was tailored to identify controlled studies, published in in English,\nGerman, French or any of the Scandinavian languages, in peer-reviewed journals between\nwww.sbu.se/upload/Publikationer/Content0/1/barnpsykhalsa_bilagor/Bilaga%201.%20S%\nC3%B6kstrategier.pdf. Studies published prior to 1990 were included, to the extent that\nthey were referred to in studies identified through the systematic literature search. For the\npurpose of the present article, a complementary literature search was performed in Feb-\nruary 2013 in PubMed, now limited to studies on programs that had been identified in the\noriginal search. Four additional articles that fulfilled our criteria were found, reporting on\ntrials of three different programs (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group 2010,\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nWe included studies of programs aiming at preventing externalizing mental ill-health in\nchildren aged 2\u00ad19 years, i.e. from the early preschool years through adolescence. Since\nthe focus was prevention, studies on clinical populations, and on children with impairments\nor medical conditions that substantially increase the risk for mental ill health, were\nexcluded. The programs were required to be standardized and to have an explicit aim to\nprevent mental ill health. Interventions solely targeting antisocial behaviors, with sub-\nstance abuse or delinquency as outcome measures and without assessment of mental\nhealth, were not included. The intervention could be directed at children and/or parents and\nbe delivered on an individual basis or in a group setting. Care as usual (CAU) or alternative\npreventive interventions were accepted as control conditions. The studies had to investigate\neffects on mental health in children participating in the trial, and presumed mediators of\neffect were not accepted as primary outcome measures. Outcome measures included rating\nscales or clinical assessments of symptoms, structured behavioral observations, school\nadjustment measures with externalizing behavior assessment components (e.g. Teacher\nObservation of Classroom Adaptation; TOCA), clinical diagnoses of psychiatric illness\nand, finally, measures indicating antisocial behavior (e.g. self assessment). Outcome had to\nbe measured no less than 6 months post intervention, and include both intervention and\ncontrol groups.\nWith our focus on long-term effects, we also included studies that followed outcome for\nseveral years after program termination, even if all inclusion criteria were not met.\nLikewise, we included long-term trials reporting consecutive observations over several\nyears, also in the absence of a follow-up 6 months post intervention, or later. Hence, the\nreview of long-term outcome was less rigorous than our main protocol, and the results are\nreported under a special heading. Studies reporting negative effects, indicating that the\nprogram may involve risks, were included regardless of study design.\nStudy Selection and Data Extraction\nTwo members of the research group, independently of each other, screened abstract lists\nand selected studies to be reviewed in full-text. All studies selected by at least one member\nwere read in full text, again by two researchers, for evaluation of study relevance and\nquality, and extraction of study data. Studies had to meet all of the following standards to\nbe of adequate quality for inclusion in the analysis of the scientific evidence for effect:\n(a) adequate control of confounders, (b) attrition rates under 30 %, attrition rates of\n30\u00ad50 % being accepted if a satisfactory attrition analysis was reported, (c) intent-to-treat\n(ITT) analysis, reported or calculable, and (d) analysis considering relevant confounders in\nnon-randomized studies. If the two researchers were in disagreement regarding study\nrelevance and quality, the study was processed in the entire group of eight researchers,\nguided by principle of consensus. Overall, the review process followed the PRISMA\nguidelines (www.prisma-statement.org). More detailed information about the evaluation of\nthe quality of each study is available on request.\nData Analysis\nWhen possible, meta-analyses were conducted by using the Cochrane Collaboration\nReview Manager software (http://ims.cochrane.org/revman). The pooled results for con-\ntinuous outcomes were expressed as SMD, in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration\nrecommendations. Effect sizes were classified as small, medium or large as proposed by\nCohen (1992). A requisite for drawing conclusions regarding the scientific evidence for\neffect of a specific program was that it had been subject to at least two trials that met the\ninclusion criteria and had comparable outcome measures.\nResearch Ethics\nPrior to the review, all research group members had signed a declaration assuring no\nconflict of interests. The study did not involve primary data, and ethical review and\napproval was therefor not applicable.\nResults\nA flow chart of the literature search and review is presented in Fig. 1. A substantial\nnumber of studies were excluded, either after reviewing the abstracts or the full text,\ndue to an insufficient follow-up period. In the end, 38 controlled trials with adequate\nstudy quality were identified, evaluating in total 25 different prevention programs for\nexternalizing problems. The vast majority of the included trials had been conducted in\nthe USA, followed by Canada, Australia, and England. Only a few selective trials had\nbeen performed in Continental Europe. The programs included are summarized in\nDesign of Trials\nThirty-six of the 38 studies were RCT, and two were controlled without randomization.\nFour of the RCTs had used an optimal method for randomization. The number of par-\nticipants in the respective trials varied from 100 to 998, with the largest samples recruited\nfor universal trials.\nThe majority of the trials employed a no intervention or CAU control group. Two had\nwhat is best described as an attention control, whereas six employed a design with more\nthan one treatment condition, to be compared with no intervention.\nAs primary outcome measure, the majority of trials employed various symptom rating\nscales. A few studies also included structured behavioral observations, as a complementary\noutcome measure. Long-term follow-up studies used (presence or absence of) psychiatric\ndiagnoses as an index of outcome, as well as overall psychosocial adjustment including\neducational attainment and employment. Eleven studies had used some sort of blinded\noutcome assessment.\nProgram Content, Length and Intensity\nAll included programs contained cognitive-behavioral components. Many of the programs\nwere modified versions of interventions that had first been developed as clinical treatments\n(e.g. Incredible Years/IY). Cognitive techniques were most visible in programs targeting\nolder children, whereas purely behavioral techniques were more frequent for young chil-\ndren. Clear examples of the latter were the Good Behavior Game (GBG), which uses a\ntoken economy to encourage on-task and pro-social group performance, and the parent\nmanagement techniques promoted by IY and the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P).\nSocial learning theory had influenced program content visibly in both cognitive and\nNumber of abstracts\nExcluded (not relevant)\nNumber of articles retrieved\nfor full text reading\nExcluded (not meeting\ninclusion criteria)\nNumber of included articles\nArticles with adequate\nstudy quality\nNot included in analyses\ndue to low study quality\nFig. 1 Flow chart of the literature review\nTable 1 Programs included in the meta-analysis\nType of program Universal Selective Indicated Programs with follow-up\nSchool based Second step\nGood behavior game (GBG)\nRochester SPS\nPeer coping skills\nCoping power\nPrime time\nGood behavior game\nParent training Incredible years (IY)\nTriple P\nNew beginnings\nParent management training\nFamily bereavement program\nIncredible years (IY)\nFamily check-up (FCU)\nCommunity parent education\nFamily check-up (FCU)\nNew beginnings\nParent management\ntraining (PMT)\nMultimodal Adolescent transition\nprogram (ATP)\nBaltimore project\nPATHS (embedded in Fast\ntrack)\nLinking interests of families\nand teachers (LIFT)--incl.\nGBG\nSAFEChildren\nFamilies and schools together\nAdolescents and their parents\nwith AIDS\nCoping power\nSchools and homes in\npartnership (SHIP)\nATP with family chcek-up\nEarly risers\nFast track\nMontreal prevention program\nSeattle development\nprogram\nFast track/PATHS\nAdolescents and their\nparents with AIDS\nMontreal prevention\nprogram\nmodeling techniques. Several programs targeting parents included home assignments on\nthe assumption that positive change requires active practice of new and more adaptive\nbehaviors. One single program, Prime Time, subject to only one included trial, gave\nreference to attachment theory.\nProgram length ranged from three sessions given within a single month, to several\nyears. The longer interventions tended to be less intensive. Most common were weekly\nsessions over a period of 3\u00ad9 months. The shortest programs were unimodal, targeting\nparents, whereas extended interventions tended to be multimodal. Program length varied\nwith content and target populations, in a way that defied analysis regarding its unique\nimpact on effect.\nCompetence of Staff\nIn general, program staff members were highly qualified, both with respect to general\neducational background and specific program competence. Many trials relied on health\nprofessionals, such as psychologists and counselors (31 %), quite a few used graduate\nstudents (17 %) or other members of the research team (17 %). Several programs were\nimplemented in schools, and teachers served as program staff in 28 % of the trials.\nNotably, just a few trials (8 %) were conducted without involvement of the program\ndevelopers.\nProgram Target Population and Prevention Level\nAccording to our classification, five (14 %) of the 36 trials used a universal strategy of\ndelivery, 16 (44 %) were selective, and 15 (42 %) were indicated. Note that our classifi-\ncation was not always in agreement with that of the authors, who might consider a program\nuniversal if it was offered to all families in a high-risk neighborhood. According to our\ndefinition, such interventions were classified as selective.\nBasic information including findings from all of the included studies of universal,\nselective and indicated programs, respectively, is summarized in Tables 2, 3, 4. Length of\nfollow-up(s) is stated, and the overall outcome is expressed as ?/0/-; where ? indicates a\nstatistically significant positive effect of the intervention, 0 no effect and - a negative\neffect of the intervention, i.e. the control group had a better outcome than the intervention\ngroup. More detailed information, on all studies included, can be retrieved in tabulated\nform at http://www.sbu.se/upload/publikationer/Content1/1/Eng_tabeller_psykiskohalsa_\nweb.pdf.\nEffects of Universal Prevention Trials\nIn the following subsections, effect sizes are expressed in accordance with Cohen's (1992)\nrecommendations. A standard mean difference of 0.20 between intervention and control\ngroups is referred to as a ``small'', 0.50 as a ``medium'' and 0.80 and beyond as a ``large\neffect''.\nSix different programs were studied in one universal trial each. Three of them were\nschool-based and entirely implemented in the classroom by teachers under supervision,\nnamely Rochester Social Problem Solving Training Program, Second Step, and the GBG.\nAnother three programs were school-based but also involved parents; the Baltimore\nClassroom-Centered and Family School Project (including GBG as a school component),\nTable 2 Preventive effects of universal programs\nFirst author\nYear\nCountry\nStudy design\nSetting\nPopulation\nIntervention N Control N Follow up time after\ntermination of trial\nOutcome (source)\nUSA\nRCT\nThree middle schools,\nmetropolitan area\n6th graders\nATP\nSix lessons in-class on life\nskills\nSelf report: 0\nOfficial rec.: 0\nUSA\nCluster RCT, matched for SES\nElementary schools\nSecond step\nonce or twice a week\nUSA\nCluster RCT; Schools in urban\nareas and varying SES\nFirst grade children, Total\nBaltimore project for 3 years\nGroup 1: GBG and learning\nsupport\nGroup 2: FSP\nNine workshops for parents\nNot\nreported\nreported\nTeacher: ?\nTeacher: ?\nDiagnosis: ?ns\nAustralia\nCCT, schools matched for SES Rochester social problem\nsolving training program\ncombined: 0\nNetherlands\nRCT\nElementary schools in urban\nareas\nGBG\n3 times weekly for 2 years\nduring school terms\nSelf report: ?\nSelf report: ? for\ninternalizing probelms\nConduct Problems\nPrevention\nResearch Group\nUSA\nCluster RCT\nElementary schools in high risk\nareas\nPATHS embedded in Fast track\n2\u00ad3 times weekly during grade\nrooms\nClass\nrooms\nPost-test, after grade\nTeacher: ?\nATP adolescent transition program, CAU care as usual, CCT controlled clinical trial, FSP family school project, GBG good behaviour game, PATHS promoting alternative thinking\nstategies, RCT randomized controlled trial, SES socioeconomic status\nTable 3 Preventive effects of selective programs\nFirst author\nYear\nCountry\nStudy design\nSetting\nPopulation\nIntervention N Control N Follow up time after\ntermination of trial\nOutcome (source)\nSwitzerland\nRCT\nMiddle class families,\nresponding to\nadvertisements\nTriple P, level 4, group version\ncouples\ncouples\n1 year Parent: ?\nUSA\nRCT\nFamilies with youth in family\ncourt and sibling target\nchild\nIY, modified\neach for parents and children\n?Home visits\nUSA\nRCT\nUrban area, lower middle\nclass SES\nMother divorced and living\nwith son in 1\u00ad3 grade\nPMT\nmother\nParent: ?\nTeacher: ?\nOfficial rec.: (?)\nUSA\nCluster RCT\nPublic elementary schools in\nareas with increased risk\nLIFT for 3 months (incl GBG)\nChildren 2 9 1 h session weekly\nParents: group meetings for\nUSA\nCluster RCT\nDay care centers in deprived\nmetropolitan area\nIY basic\nGroup 1: parent and teacher\ntraining\nGorup 2: parent training\nGroup 3: teacher training\nTeacher: ?\nBlind observer: 0\nUSA\nCluster RCT\nDay care centres in deprived\nmetropolitan area\nIY, modified\n11 weekly sessions with parents\nBlind observer: ?\nTable 3 continued\nFirst author\nYear\nCountry\nStudy design\nSetting\nPopulation\nIntervention N Control N Follow up time after\ntermination of trial\nOutcome (source)\nGermany\nCluster RCT\nPre-schools in urban area\nChildren 3\u00ad6 years old\nTriple P\n4 weekly sessions, 2 h each\nTeacher: 0\nObserver: 0\nGermany\nCluster RCT\nDay centres in urban area:\nFamilies with middle to\nupper SES\nChildren mean age 4.5 years\nTriple P\nFour sessions and opportunity for telephone\ncontacts\nKratochwill et al.\nUSA\nRCT, matched pairs\nEarly elementary schools\nChildren of Indian American\ndescent\nFAST\nTeacher: ns\nRotheram-Borus et al.\nUSA\nRCT\nAIDS services in\nmetropolitan area\nParents with AIDS and low\nSES\nCoping skill intervention\nModule 1: 8 sessions [ 4 weeks for parents\nonly\nparents ? adolescents\nModule 3: delivered to adolescents if parent\nhad died\nSelf rep: ?\nSelf rep: 0\nSelf rep: 0\nEduc.: ?\nWork: ?\nUSA\nRCT\nMetropolitan area\nFamilies where one parent\nearlier\nFamily Bereavement Program\n12 lessons, 2 h each for care givers and\nchildren separately\nstudies\nfor girls\n0 for boys\nUSA\nCluster RCT\nUrban high risk community\nChild in 1st grade in school\nSAFE Children\nFamily: weekly sessions after school\nAcademic tutoring: twice weekly, 30 min\nteacher\ncombined: ?\nTable 3 continued\nFirst author\nYear\nCountry\nStudy design\nSetting\nPopulation\nIntervention N Control N Follow up time after\ntermination of trial\nOutcome\n(source)\nUSA\nRCT\n50 % of the intervention\nwhen children were in 4th\ngrade\nSAFE Children booster dose\n20 sessions multiple family groups\nUSA\nRCT\n14 schools in two large Head\nStart districts\nIY Partner ?

No universal programs\ntargeting parents only met our inclusion criteria.\nResults regarding effect of universal trials are summarized in Table 2. According to\nthree studies, GBG reduced symptoms of externalizing behavior in schoolchildren for at\nleast 12 months, although effect sizes were small. Other universal school programs had\nbeen subject to a maximum of one study of adequate quality, and the scientific evidence\nregarding their respective effect was therefore insufficient.\nEffects of Selective Prevention Trials\nNine different prevention programs were tested in 17 selective trials that met our inclusion\ncriteria, and their results are summarized in Table 3.\nTrials of the parent training programs Triple P and Incredible Years allowed for meta-\nanalyses, as presented in Figs. 2, 3. Both programs reduced symptoms of externalizing\nproblems in preschool children, who had minor to moderate social problems, for at least\n12 months. The effects were small to medium (Fig. 2). The Incredible Years had been\ntested only in socio-economically disadvantaged environments. In those contexts, the\nprogram had a small effect on symptoms of externalizing problems in pre-school children,\nrated by blind observers at least 8 months post intervention (Fig. 3). Symptom ratings by\nparents suggested that the program had little or no effect (Fig. 2).\nSelective trials targeting families affected by internal stress (Parent Management\nTraining/PMT, New Beginnings, Family Bereavement Program, Adolescents and Their\nParents with Aids, considered together) reduced externalizing behavior in the children at\nleast 11 months post intervention. The average effects were small.\nThe review did not allow for conclusions regarding the effects of any other program\nsubject to a selective trial, since the remaining studies were too heterogeneous to be pooled\nin a meta-analysis.\nBooster sessions were reported for a few of the selective trials, with variable results.\nOne extra session of IY 1 year after program termination reported no effect, whereas a\ncomplete repeat trial of SAFE Children 3 years later reported a small but significant effect.\nEffects of Indicated Prevention Trials\nThe effects of 11 programs were tested in a total of 16 indicated trials of adequate quality.\nAnother 25 indicated trials met the inclusion criteria, but were of insufficient quality to\ncontribute to the scientific evidence. Included trials represented family support programs,\nschool programs, and multimodal programs. The results are summarized in Table 4 and\nThe Family Check-Up (FCU), a family support program, was based on a structured\nthree-session assessment and feedback intervention, but could also provide individually\ntailored continued support, and treatment. Three large trials of FCU were included in the\nreview, showing reduced symptoms of externalizing behavior in children and adolescents\nfor at least 12 months. The effects were of medium size.\nCoping Power was subject to two trials, primarily implemented within the school\ncurricula but with complementary supportive education targeting parents and teachers. It\nreduced the degree of externalizing behavior in schoolchildren for up to 12 months, with\nmedium effects.

See Fig. 4.\nLong-Term Outcome\nEight selective or indicated trials, of which seven are presented in Tables 3 and 4, had been\nsubject to long-term follow-up studies with at least one observation 5 years or longer after\nFig. 2 Selective prevention with the Incredible Years and Triple P parent training programs: Parental\nratings of child behavior at follow up: a 6\u00ad8 months, b 12\u00ad16 months post intervention\nFig. 3 Selective prevention with Incredible Years: Independent observer ratings of child behavior at 1 year\nfollow up\nprogram termination. In the case of Fast Track, there had been consecutive observations\nduring a 10-year long intervention, complemented with a follow-up 3 years post\nintervention.\nThese studies reported a lower incidence of psychiatric diagnoses (Fast Track, GBG and\nNew Beginnings), better school attendance (Montreal Prevention Project), lower incidence\nof delinquency (PMT) and overall problem behaviors (Family Check-up), and a higher\nemployment rate and self-support (Adolescents and Their Parent with AIDS). However,\nthe long-term effects were small and typically found only on occasional outcome measures.\nAn eighth trial, the Seattle Development Project, presented a special case with one\nextremely long-term follow-up study. The program aimed at preventing antisocial ado-\nlescent behavior through an intervention delivered in different steps during grades 1\u00ad6.\nInitially, the study was randomized, but was converted into a quasi-experimental design\nwhen additional cohorts were recruited. Long-term observations were made when partic-\nprogram aim to prevent externalizing problems, positive long-term effects mostly con-\ncerned internalizing problems. At age 27, significantly fewer psychiatric diagnoses were\nreported for those who had participated throughout grades 1\u00ad6.\nFig. 4 Indicated prevention: Parental ratings of child behavior at 1 year follow up\nNegative Effects\nThe literature search on negative effects of prevention programs rendered 534 abstracts. In\nthe end, ten studies constituted the scientific evidence for negative effects; a few of them\nwere also part of the assessment of prevention effects. Typically, the reports on negative\neffects were based on incidental findings, which ran contrary to expectation. Early on,\nDishion and colleagues reported an unexpected increase in externalizing symptoms and\ndisruptive behavior in 11\u00ad14 years old participants in a group intervention for youths at\nhigh risk, the Adolescent Transition Program (Dishion and Andrews 1995; see Table 4).\nProgram involvement of parents was reported to have a small but protective effect.\nAdditional longitudinal studies of ATP, including a follow-up of the Cambridge-Somer-\nville Youth Study, have confirmed these findings (Dishion et al. 1999, 2001). In the same\nvein, Warren and colleagues reported that parental involvement is intrinsic to and elimi-\nnates iatrogenic effects of Families and Schools Together (Warren et al. 2006).\nCavell and colleagues reported that the Prime Time group intervention made low-risk\ngroup participants more accepting of aggressive and disruptive behaviors (Cavell and\nHughes 2000; see Table 4). Two studies of PALS, a social skills training program\nadministered in a group format, reported that program participation increased the risk for\nnegative peer interactions and use of drugs (Palinkas et al. 1996). Mager et al. (2005) found\niatrogenic effects only in high-risk youths participating in group interventions together\nwith well-adjusted peers, and suggested that the group composition fueled their negative\nself-image.\nThree studies, all limited in size, reported that selective or indicated prevention pro-\ngrams may have negative effects on the family system, with increased stress, tension and\nconflicts between other family members (Mockford and Barlow 2004; Helfenbaum-Kun\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review of prevention programs targeting externalizing problems in chil-\ndren lends limited support to their effects. Among several hundreds of prevention programs\ninvestigated and reported in the international literature, only 24 programs met our inclusion\ncriteria. In fact, only five of them had been subject to more than one trial of sufficient\nquality, which showed positive results, a requisite for drawing conclusions regarding\nspecific program effect. These five programs include two parent training programs\n(Incredible Years and Triple P), a family support program (Family Check-Up), and two\nschool programs (GBG and Coping Power). In addition, a small group of studies, con-\nsidered together, indicate that family support programs (i.e. PMT) aimed at families\nundergoing a period of increased stress may prevent externalizing mental ill-health in\nchildren. Overall, effect sizes were small.\nOur results may seem at odds with previous meta-analyses, which have tended to report\nlarger and more unanimously positive program effects. What may account for these\ndiverging results? First, our analysis was designed to evaluate preventive effects only, and\nexcluded treatment studies, where effect sizes are usually more impressive. Second, only\nstudies with outcome measures concerning the children's externalizing problems were\nincluded; presumed mediators such as parenting skills, or parent or teacher satisfaction,\nwere not accepted as primary outcome measures. Third, we excluded programs that were\nsolely targeting antisocial behaviors, with substance abuse or delinquency as outcome\nmeasures, and that had no assessment of mental health. Fourth, we only included studies\nthat met the specified quality criteria regarding control and analysis of confounders,\nattrition rates and ITT-analysis. Fifth, and most importantly, we used a follow-up period of\nat least 6 months as a critical inclusion criterion, to exclude merely transitory effects.\nConsidering that many of the programs in the analysis intervene in preschool or early\nschool years with an ultimate goal to prevent the development of externalizing problems in\nadolescence, this seems like a fairly modest criterion.\nLimited evidence for effect must not be taken as a proof that prevention programs are\nuseless. Rather, it demonstrates that our knowledge about the effects of the programs is\ndisturbingly meager. Scientists and practitioners concerned with the wellbeing of children\nshould be encouraged to conduct well-designed trials, which include follow-up assess-\nments conducted at least 6 months after program termination.\nThe few long-term follow-up studies that have been conducted lend some, albeit\nunsystematic, support to the belief that prevention programs may indeed make a difference.\nThe results are, however, inconclusive, due to the small number of studies and also to the\nfact that effects measured at one specific point in time tend to be difficult to replicate\nduring consecutive follow-ups. A given outcome measure may be relevant at one devel-\nopmental stage, and of subordinate interest at another, posing significant theoretical and\nmethodological challenges.\nPrevention programs are delivered at different levels of intervention. The prevention\nliterature at large indicates that universal prevention produces smaller effect sizes per\nobservation unit, since the great majority of the general population is unaffected by the\nproblem targeted. Therefore, the effects of universal prevention can only be tested in very\nlarge-scale trials. Evaluations of programs for children at risk, in indicated or selective\ntrials, are less demanding in terms of resources and are likely to produce higher effect\nsizes. However, our meta-analysis lends weak general support for indicated prevention,\nand there was no sign that brief, indicated trials of single-component programs had any\neffect at all. On the other hand, data from Fast Track and Family Check-up trials, support\nthe idea that sustainable indicated prevention may benefit children who are most at risk. In\nsummary, our meta-analysis did not allow for any conclusions about preferable prevention\nlevel, primarily because of the small number of universal prevention trials of sufficient size\nand scientific quality.\nThe length of the parent support programs varied greatly from 1 month to several years,\nsometimes including ``booster sessions'', but variations in effect may have more to do with\nthe socio-cultural context of the studies than the length and intensity of the programs.\nStudies of Triple P, a program that has been evaluated primarily in middle class settings,\nhave typically reported larger effects than studies of the Incredible Years program, which\nhas almost exclusively been evaluated in disadvantaged families.\nExternalizing symptoms have a strong male preponderance. Accordingly, most of the\nstudy populations in this systematic review had an uneven gender distribution, and five\nstudies focused entirely on boys. No program in our analysis had developed gender specific\napproaches, and gender effect analyses were rare. Thus, the available evidence in support\nof the effect of preventive programs targeting externalizing problems relies heavily on\neffects in boys.\nThe possibility for negative or unwanted effects must always be taken into account. It is\nwell documented that aggregating at-risk children and adolescents for group interventions\nmay result in a negative outcome, through social contagion (Dishion et al. 2001). Although\nless well researched, there is also reason to be aware that interventions aimed at parents\nmay disrupt the balance in a fragile family system. To date, very few intervention trials\nhave included a systematic procedure for reporting of iatrogenic effects, and it is fair to\nassume that our knowledge of harmful consequences is quite limited. An obvious rec-\nommendation for future trials is to include protocols for observation and systematic\nreporting also of unwanted outcomes.\nMethodological Shortcomings and Challenges\nEvaluating preventive effects poses a number of significant methodological and practical\nchallenges. Since lower effect sizes are to be expected, prevention trials generally demand\nlarger study populations than do clinical treatment trials. Cluster randomization is one\nstrategy to handle this problem, but interferes with the basic assumption of independence\nbetween observation units, if not handled properly in the statistical analysis. Quite a few of\nthe included studies had unbalanced study groups, with higher initial symptom levels in the\nintervention group compared to controls, despite adequate randomization procedures. This\nsuggests that a regression to the mean may be part of the calculated effects, e.g. in the trials\nof Triple P. Another problem is that some studies present only a few out of many potential\noutcome measures, which raises questions about selective reporting of variables.\nA major limitation in the literature is the shortage of studies reporting long-term out-\ncome. Admittedly, there are a number of difficulties with longitudinal designs in pre-\nvention research. Maintaining study cohorts over of time is a demanding undertaking,\ninvolving sustainable logistics, at considerable costs. In reality, research funding is rarely\ngranted for more than a few years at a time, allowing only for brief follow-up periods, at\nbest. Furthermore, longitudinal studies present some purely scientific challenges of their\nown, conceptual as well as methodological. A linear relationship between a specific\nintervention and long-term outcome is not to be expected. Inventories measuring psychi-\natric symptoms at early school age may not be valid measures of mental health later in\nchildhood, whereas school attendance and performance, as well as psychiatric diagnoses\nand overall social adjustment are of increasing importance during adolescence.\nIn most of the included trials, the program developers themselves had been actively\ninvolved, indicating a risk for allegiance effects. There is an obvious need for more\neffectiveness studies, carried out by independent researchers.\nConclusions and Future Directions\nIn spite of a vast research literature, the scientific evidence for lasting effects of prevention\nprograms targeting externalizing problems in children and adolescents is limited. A mere\nhandful of programs have been subject to more than one well-controlled trial with adequate\nfollow-up. There is a need for well-designed studies that evaluate lasting effects in\neffectiveness studies, and address whether universal or selective/indicated approaches\nshould be preferred, and whether there is a risk for negative consequences from program\nparticipation. Evaluation studies for prevention programs should include follow-up mea-\nsures no less than 6 months post intervention, and preferably at several points in time, for\nboth intervention and control groups, allowing for analysis of developmental trajectories\nand maintenance of the attained effects. Future meta-analyses in this field need to clearly\ndifferentiate between different levels of intervention, specify inclusion criteria accordingly,\nand limit conclusions to the level in focus.\nFinally, funding agencies need to be made aware of the high costs involved in\naddressing the methodological problems mentioned above. Quality prevention research is\ndependent on sustainable funding. A lack of commitment on the part of funding sources is\na major obstacle for the development and implementation of prevention programs based on\nsound scientific evidence.\n"
