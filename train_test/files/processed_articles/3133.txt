Fugelseth1\n1Dept.of Neonatal Intensive Care, 2Neuroradiology, Oslo University Hospital, Ullev\u00e5l, Oslo, Norway,\n3Dept.of Childhealth, University College of Bristol, St. Michaels Hospital, Bristol, UK\nBackground: Optimal timing of cMRI after therapeutic hypothermia is controversial.\nAim: To compare cMRI postnatal d4 with d10.\nMethods: Sagittal/axial T1 IR-weighted and axial T2-weighted images were visual scored: Basal ganglia\nand thalami (DNGM), white (WM), cortical gray matter (CGM) 0-3 (0=normal, 1=mild, 2=moderate,\n3=severe), posterior limb of capsula interna (PLIC) 0-2 (0=normal, 1=equivocal, 2=loss), haemorrhages 0-2\n(0=none, 1=extra-axial, 2=intracerebral).\nResults: Twenty-five infants (GA 36-41) were examined.\n[cMRI data:]\nEighteen had normal; seven had abnormal scans on d4 and d10. Five had mild to severe changes in DNGM\nd4, two progressed from mild to moderate on d10. Two grade 1 CGM progressed to grade 2 or 3 on d10.\nTwo without CGM pathology d4 had mild to moderate on d10. Three had grade 2 or 3 WM findings; one\nregressed from grade 3 to 2. Four had abnormal PLIC on d4, two disappeared d10. Two had haemorrhages\non d4 and d10; grade 2 (data not shown in the tbl)\nConclusions: CGM and DNGM lesions progressed from day d4 to day d10, WM and PLIC regressed\n"
