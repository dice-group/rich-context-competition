Males\nwere more likely than females to be both perpetrators and targets of bullying. The\nfrequency of bullying was higher among 6th- through 8th-grade students than among\n9th- and 10th-grade students. Perpetrating and experiencing bullying were associ-\nated with poorer psychosocial adjustment (P.001); however, different patterns of\nassociation occurred among bullies, those bullied, and those who both bullied others\nand were bullied themselves.\nConclusions The prevalence of bullying among US youth is substantial. Given the\nconcurrent behavioral and emotional difficulties associated with bullying, as well as\nthe potential long-term negative outcomes for these youth, the issue of bullying mer-\nits serious attention, both for future research and preventive intervention.\nResearch examining characteristics of\nyouth involved in bullying has consis-\ntently found that both bullies and those\nbullied demonstrate poorer psycho-\nsocial functioning than their nonin-\nvolved peers. Youth who bully others\ntendtodemonstratehigherlevelsofcon-\nduct problems and dislike of school,\nwhereas youth who are bullied gener-\nally show higher levels of insecurity,\nanxiety, depression, loneliness, unhap-\npiness, physical and mental symptoms,\nare bullied also tend to be physically\nweaker than males in general.2 The few\nstudies that have examined the charac-\nteristics of youth who both bully and are\nbullied found that these individuals ex-\nhibit the poorest psychosocial function-\nThecurrentresearchprovidesafoun-\ndation for an understanding of the bul-\nlying problem. However, it is insuffi-\ncient to guide intervention and policy\ndevelopment. Moreover,little is known\nspecifically about bullying among US\nyouth.6 In one county-wide middle\nschool survey, 24.1% of youth reported\nbullying others at least once in the past\nsemester26; it is not known whether this\nischaracteristicof the rest of the nation.\nThe purpose of this study was to re-\nport the prevalence of bullying in a na-\ntionally representative sample of US\nyouth in grades 6 through 10, along\nwith information on differences in the\nprevalence of bullying by sex, grade,\nand race. In addition, the relation-\nships among bullying, being bullied,\nand psychosocial adjustment are ex-\nplored for 3 distinct groups: bullies\nonly, those bullied only, and those who\nboth bully and are bullied.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThe National Institute of Child Health\nand Human Development supported a\nnationally representative survey of US\nyouth in grades 6 through 10 during\nspring of 1998. The survey, entitled the\nHealth Behaviour of School-aged Chil-\ndren (HBSC), was part of a collabora-\ntive, cross-national research project in-\nvolving 30 countries and coordinated\nby the World Health Organization.27\nThe US survey was approved by the Na-\ntional Institute of Child Health and Hu-\nman Development Institutional Re-\nview Board and was carried out by\nMacro International Inc (Calverton,\nMd). Both parental and student con-\nsent were solicited.\nThe US sampling universe con-\nsisted of all public, Catholic, and other\nprivate school students in grades 6\nthrough 10, or their equivalent, exclud-\ning schools with enrollment of fewer\nthan 14 students. The sample design\nused a stratified 2-stage cluster of\nclasses. The sample selection was strati-\nfied by racial/ethnic status to provide\nan oversample of black and Hispanic\nstudents. The sample was also strati-\nfied by geographic region and coun-\nties' metropolitan statistical area sta-\ntus (largest urban areas/not largest\nurban areas) with probability propor-\ntional to total enrollment in eligible\ngrades of the primary sampling units.\nSample size was determined on the cri-\nteria of making estimates for all US stu-\ndents in grades 6 through 10 with a pre-\ncision of 3% at a 95% confidence level,\nand for minority students with a pre-\ncision of 5% at a 95% confidence level.\nAn 83% participation rate was\nachieved. The school-based sample\ndesign, using 1 class period for comple-\ntion of the questionnaire, precluded\nability to compare respondent charac-\nteristics with those of nonpartici-\npants. Responding students in sampled\nclasses were excluded if they were out\nof the target range for grade or if age\nwas outside of the 99th percentile for\ngrade (n=440 students), or if either\ngrade or age were unknown (n=39 stu-\ndents), yielding an analytic sample of\nMeasures\nMeasures were obtained from a self-\nreport questionnaire containing 102\nquestions about health behavior and rel-\nevant demographic variables. Items\nwere based on both theoretical hypoth-\neses related to the social context of ado-\nlescents and measurements that had\nbeen validated in other studies or pre-\nvious WHO-HBSC surveys.27 Mea-\nsures were pretested.\nBullying. Questions about bullying\nwere preceded with the following ex-\nabout bullying. We say a student is\nBEING BULLIED when another student,\nor a group of students, say or do nasty and\nunpleasant things to him or her. It is also\nbullying when a student is teased repeat-\nedly in a way he or she doesn't like. But it\nis NOT BULLYING when two students of\nabout the same strength quarrel or fight.\nParticipation in bullying was as-\nsessed by 2 parallel questions that asked\nrespondentstoreportthefrequencywith\nwhich they bullied others in school and\naway from school during the current\nterm. Similarly, being bullied was as-\nsessed by 2 parallel questions asking re-\nspondents to report the frequency with\nwhich they were bullied in school and\naway from school during the current\nterm. Because the analytic focus of the\ncurrentstudywastherelationshipofbul-\nlying behaviors to overall psychosocial\nadjustment, frequencies of bullying be-\nhaviors in and out of school were com-\nbined for all analyses. Response catego-\nrieswere\"Ihaven't. . . ,\"\"onceortwice,\"\n\"sometimes,\" \"about once a week,\" and\n\"several times a week.\" An analysis of\nthe response distribution revealed fewer\nsubjects in the fourth category than the\nfifth, a deviation from the expected\nskewed pattern. Hence, the latter 2 re-\nsponse options were collapsed. Addi-\ntionalquestionsaskedrespondentstore-\nportthefrequencywithwhichtheywere\nbullied in each of 5 ways--belittled\naboutreligion/race,belittledaboutlooks/\nspeech, hit/slapped/pushed, subject of\nrumors or lies, and subject of sexual\ncomments/gestures.\nPsychosocial Adjustment. Mea-\nsures of psychosocial adjustment in-\ncluded questions about problem be-\nhaviors, social/emotional well-being,\nand parental influences. Alcohol use\nwas measured by 3 items assessing fre-\nquency of alcohol consumption. The\nfrequency of smoking, fighting, and tru-\nancy were assessed by 1 item each. Aca-\ndemic achievement was assessed by an\nitem querying perceived school perfor-\nmance. Three items (=.70) queried\nthe frequency of feeling lonely, feeling\nleft out, and being alone because oth-\ners at school did not want to spend time\nwith the person. One item assessed ease\nof making friends. Three items (=.72)\nwere used to assess relationship with\nclassmates: \"enjoy being together,\" \"are\nkind and helpful,\" and \"accept me.\"\nSchool climate was measured by 7 items\n(=.82) related to the respondent's per-\nception of the school and teachers.\nThree items measured parental involve-\nment in school (=.82), and 1 item as-\nsessed respondents' perceptions about\ntheir parents' attitudes toward teen\ndrinking.\nStatistical Methods\nStatistical sample weights were devel-\noped to adjust the minority oversam-\npling and to obtain student totals by\ngrade comparable to population grade\nestimates from the US National Center\nfor Education Statistics. Weighted data\nanalyseswereconductedusingSUDAAN\nsoftware.29 Descriptive statistics were\nconductedusingSUDAANtoobtainper-\ncentage distributions and confidence in-\ntervals(CIs)basedontheweighteddata,\nwith SEs adjusted for the sample de-\nsign. All CIs are shown at the 95% level.\nTo examine the relationship be-\ntween psychosocial adjustment and bul-\nlying/being bullied, students were clas-\nsified as noninvolved, bullies only, those\nbullied only, or both bully and bullied\ncoincidentally,andaseparatemodelwas\nfit for each outcome. Students who were\nneither bullies nor bullied served as the\nreferencegroup.Eachoutcomehad4or-\ndinal levels based on frequency of the\nbehavior--never, once or twice, some-\ntimes, and once a week or more. The\nproportional odds model30 was used to\nexamine the relationship between a\nrange of psychosocial adjustment con-\nstructs and each of the outcomes. In-\nherent in this model is the propor-\ntional odds assumption, which states\nthat the cumulative odds ratio for any\n2 values of the covariate is constant\nacross response categories. Its interpre-\ntation is that the odds of being in cat-\negoryisexp[(x1\n)]timeshigher\natthecovariatevectorx=x1\nthanatx=x2\n,\nwhere the parameter vector  contains\nthe regression coefficients for the co-\nvariate x. A cumulative logit function\nwas used to estimate the model param-\netersviathegeneralizedestimatingequa-\ntions.31 The dependence of responses\nwithinclusterswasspecifiedusinganex-\nchangable working correlation struc-\nture. To account for the dependence be-\ntween outcomes in estimating the\nvariances,robustvarianceestimateswere\nused for the estimated parameters. The\nMULTILOGprocedureofSUDAANwas\nused to fit the proportional odds model\nwith exchangable correlation struc-\nture. Each model was first fit using the\nfull sample, and then refit using 4 sub-\nsamples stratified by sex and education\nlevel (middle school vs high school).\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of Bullying\nOverall, 10.6% of the sample reported\nbullying others \"sometimes\" (moder-\nate bullying) and 8.8% admitted to bul-\nlying others once a week or more (fre-\nquent bullying), providing a national\nin frequent bullying (TABLE 1). Expe-\nriencing bullying was reported with\nsimilar frequency, with 8.5% bullied\n\"sometimes\" and 8.4% bullied once a\nweek or more, for a national estimate\nfrequently (TABLE 2). A sizable num-\nber of students reported both bullying\nothers and being bullied themselves. Of\nthe total sample, 29.9% (an estimated\ninvolvement in moderate or frequent\nbullying, as a bully (13.0%), a target of\nDemographic variation in the fre-\nquency of bullying was observed. Males\nboth bullied others and were bullied sig-\nnificantly more often than females. Bul-\nlying occurred most frequently in 6th\nthrough 8th grade.

Females more\nfrequently reported being bullied\nthrough rumors or sexual comments.\nBeing bullied through negative state-\nments about one's religion or race oc-\ncurred with the lowest frequency for\nboth sexes.\nResults of the analyses of the relation-\nship among indicators of psychosocial\nadjustment and bullying/being bullied\nusing the proportional odds model are\npresented in TABLE 4. The overall model\nfor each of the outcomes was signifi-\ncant (P.001). Allmain effects were sig-\nnificant in at least 1 of the models. Table\n4 also shows the estimated odds ratios\nfor each psychosocial adjustment con-\nstruct in the model (adjusting for all\nother constructs in the model), indicat-\ning the odds of having a greater fre-\nquency of the outcome variable com-\npared with the reference group.\nBullies, those bullied, and individu-\nals reporting both bullying and being\nbullied all demonstrated poorer psycho-\nsocial adjustment than noninvolved\nyouth; however, differences in the pat-\nternofmaladjustmentamongthegroups\nwere observed. Fighting was positively\nassociated with all 3 outcomes. Alco-\nhol use was positively associated with\nbullying and negatively associated with\nbeing bullied. Smoking and poorer aca-\ndemicachievementwereassociatedwith\nboth bullying and coincident bullying/\nbeing bullied; poorer perceived school\nclimate was related only to bullying.\nPoorerrelationshipswithclassmatesand\nincreased loneliness, on the other hand,\nwere associated with both being bul-\nlied and coincident bullying/being bul-\nlied. Ability to make friends was nega-\ntively related to being bullied and\npositively related to bullying. A permis-\nsive parental attitude toward teen drink-\ning was associated only with coinci-\ndent bullying/being bullied, while\nincreasedparentalinvolvementinschool\nwas related to both being bullied and co-\nincident bullying/being bullied.\nResults from the analyses of the 4 sex/\nage subgroups (data not shown) yielded\nfindings similar to the model based on\nthe full sample. No notable differences\namong groups were observed for fight-\ning, academic achievement, perceived\nschool climate, and relationship with\nclassmates. However, differences by sex\nand age were observed for several vari-\nables. While smoking was positively as-\nsociated with bullying and coincident\nbullying/beingbulliedamongallgroups,\nthe magnitude of the relationship was\ngreater for middle school youth than\nhigh school youth. Middle school males\nalso showed a positive relationship be-\ntween loneliness and bullying; this was\nnot the case for any of the other groups.\nAmong high school youth, bullying/\nbeing bullied was positively related to\nalcohol consumption; this relationship\nwas not observed among middle school\nyouth.Highschoolfemales,ontheother\nhand, did not demonstrate a signifi-\ncantrelationshipbetweenpoorerfriend-\nship-making and being bullied, whereas\nthe other groups did. In addition, per-\nmissive parental attitude toward teen\ndrinking was associated with bullying/\nbeing bullied for all groups except high\nschool females. Finally, greater paren-\nTable 2.

It was related\nto bullying for high school males only.\nCOMMENT\nThis study indicates that bullying is a se-\nrious problem for US youth. Consis-\nlying was reported as more prevalent\namong males than females and oc-\ncurred with greater frequency among\nmiddle school\u00adaged youth than high\nschool\u00adaged youth. For males, both\nphysical and verbal bullying were com-\nmon, while for females, verbal bullying\n(both taunting and sexual comments)\nand rumors were more common. How-\never, verbal bullying through deroga-\ntory statements about one's religion or\nrace occurred infrequently for both\nsexes. This finding may reflect stron-\nger social norms among adolescents\nagainst such behavior. That is, it may be\nmore socially acceptable for a youth to\ntaunt peers about their appearance than\nto make derogatory racial statements.\nBoth bullying and being bullied were\nassociated with poorer psychosocial ad-\njustment; however, there were notable\ndifferences among those bullied, bul-\nlies, and those reporting both behav-\niors. Those bullied demonstrated poorer\nsocial and emotional adjustment, re-\nportinggreaterdifficultymakingfriends,\npoorer relationships with classmates,\nand greater loneliness. Youth who are\nsocially isolated and lack social skills\nmay be more likely targets for being bul-\nlied. This is consonant with the finding\nmost frequent reason cited by youth for\npersons being bullied is that they \"didn't\nfit in.\" At the same time, youth who are\nbullied may well be avoided by other\nyouth, for fear of being bullied them-\nselves or losing social status among their\npeers.Consideringthehighdegreeofre-\nlationship observed, it is likely that both\nprocesses occur. Being bullied was also\nassociated with greater parental involve-\nment in school, which may reflect par-\nents' awareness of their child's difficul-\nties. Conversely, parental involvement\nTable 4. Results of Fitting the Proportional Odds Model to the HBSC Data*\nCovariate\nOutcome, OR (95% CI)\nBeing Bullied Bullying Bullying/Being Bullied\nParental attitude toward\nteen drinking\nOkay to drink/not\nget drunk\n(continued)\nmay be related to a lower level of inde-\npendence among these youth, poten-\ntially making them more vulnerable to\nbeing bullied. Interestingly, being bul-\nlied was associated with less frequency\nof alcohol use and had a nonlinear re-\nlationship with smoking. This is not al-\ntogether surprising, given Farring-\nton's34,35 findingthatsociallyineptyouth\nwere less likely to be involved in delin-\nquency than other youth.\nPersons who bullied others were\nmore likely to be involved in other\nproblem behaviors such as drinking al-\ncohol and smoking. They showed\npoorer school adjustment, both in terms\nof academic achievement and per-\nceived school climate. Yet they re-\nported greater ease of making friends,\nindicating that bullies are not socially\nisolated. Considering their greater in-\nvolvement in other problem behav-\niors, it is likely that these youth have\nfriends who endorse bullying and other\nproblem behaviors, and who may be in-\nvolved in bullying as well.\nThose youth who reported both bul-\nlying and being bullied demonstrated\npoorer adjustment across both social/\nemotional dimensions and problem be-\nhaviors.Consideringthecombinationof\nsocialisolation,lackofsuccessinschool,\nand involvement in problem behaviors,\nyouthwhobothbullyothersandarebul-\nlied may represent an especially high-\nriskgroup.Itisnotknownwhetherthese\nyouth were first bullied and then imi-\ntated the bullying behavior they experi-\nenced or whether they were bullies who\nthen received retaliation. Current un-\nderstanding tends to support the former\nexplanation. Olweus2 describes a small\nsubset of bullied youth he terms \"pro-\nvocative victims,\" individuals who dem-\nonstrate both anxious and aggressive\nbehavior patterns and who are known\nfor starting fights and engaging in dis-\nruptive behavior. Pellegrini and col-\nleagues36,37 further discuss the \"aggres-\nsive victim,\" defined as youth who\nrespondtobullyingwithreactiveaggres-\nsion. These youth do not tend to use ag-\ngression in a proactive or instrumental\nmanner, but rather are aggressive in re-\ntaliatory circumstances.\nThe patterns of relationships be-\ntween bullying/being bullied and psy-\nchosocial adjustment observed in this\nstudy were similar across age and sex\ngroups, providing support for the sta-\nbilityofthefindings.Thedifferencesthat\nemerged may be useful for those con-\nductingresearchordevelopinginterven-\ntions targeting specific populations. For\nexample, the stronger relationship be-\ntween bullying and smoking observed\namong middle school youth may re-\nflect an association of bullying with de-\nviance; as smoking becomes more nor-\nmative in the older youth, it is less\nassociated with bullying. The lack of a\nrelationship between being bullied and\npoorer friendship-making among high\nschoolfemalescouldindicatethatbythis\nage, females are more apt to find a peer\ngroup in which they \"fit,\" even though\nthe peer group may consist of youth of\nsimilar social status.38\nSeverallimitationsofthestudyshould\nbe noted. The HBSC is a broadly fo-\ncused survey regarding the health be-\nhaviors of middle\u00ad and high school\u00ad\naged youth. As such, more in-depth\ninformation, such as might be obtained\nfrom an intervention study addressing\nbullying,arenotavailable.Thisstudyin-\ncludes middle\u00ad and high school\u00adaged\nyouth but does not address elementary\nschool youth. The data are cross-\nsectional, and as such, the direction of\nrelationships among the variables can-\nnot be determined. Another limitation is\nthe reliance on self-report for measure-\nment of bullying. While self-report is a\ncommon and accepted method of mea-\nsuring bullying, individual perceptions\nof bullying nevertheless may vary. To\nminimizesubjectivity,studentswerepro-\nvided with a detailed definition of bul-\nlying along with examples.\nWhile research on the long-term con-\nsequences of bullying is minimal, the\nstudies that have been conducted show\nnegative effects into adulthood. Ol-\nweus39 found former bullies to have a\n4-foldincreaseincriminalbehavioratthe\nage of 24 years, with 60% of former bul-\nlies having at least 1 conviction and 35%\nto 40% having 3 or more convictions.\nTheir earlier pattern of achieving de-\nsired goals through bullying likely in-\nhibited the learning of more socially ac-\nceptablewaysofnegotiatingwithothers.\nConversely, individuals formerly bul-\nlied were found to have higher levels of\ndepression and poorer self-esteem at the\nage of 23 years, despite the fact that, as\nadults, they were no more harassed or\nsocially isolated than comparison\nadults.40 Those who have been bullied\nmayviewsuchtreatmentasevidencethat\nthey are inadequate and worthless and\nmay internalize these perceptions. No\nstudy has assessed the long-term out-\ncomes for those who both bully others\nandarebullied.Giventheirinitialpoorer\nadjustment status, it is possible that they\nfare worse than either bullies or those\nbullied.\nWhile this study provides impor-\ntant data on the prevalence and psy-\nchosocial correlates of bullying among\nUS youth, further research is needed.\nTable 4.

P values\nrepresent the significance of the category overall.\nOdds ratios for continuous variables were calculated for each level for illustrative purposes. In each case, the OR\nprovided at the level \"2\" represents the increase in odds attributable to an increase in 1 unit of the covariate.\nOf particular importance would be pro-\nspective studies addressing factors that\nlead to bullying, as well as studies on\nthe long-term consequences of bully-\ning and being bullied. Longitudinal\nstudies also would be valuable in bet-\nter understanding the nature of those\nwho bully and are bullied.\nThe prevalence of bullying observed\nin this study suggests the importance of\npreventive intervention research target-\ning bullying behaviors. Effective pre-\nvention will require a solid understand-\ning of the social and environmental\nfactors that facilitate and inhibit bully-\ning and peer aggression. This knowl-\nedge could then be used to create school\nand social environments that promote\nhealthy peer interactions and intoler-\nance of bullying. School-based interven-\ntions have demonstrated positive out-\nThese interventions focused on changes\nwithin the school and classroom cli-\nmate to increase awareness about bul-\nlying, increase teacher and parent in-\nvolvement and supervision, form clear\nrules and strong social norms against\nbullying, and provide support and pro-\ntection for individuals bullied. This type\nof approach has not been tested in the\nUnited States.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nNansel, Overpeck, Pilla, Simons-Morton, Scheidt.\nAcquisition of data: Overpeck, Scheidt.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Nansel, Over-\npeck, Pilla, Ruan, Simons-Morton, Scheidt.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Nansel, Overpeck, Pilla.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Nansel, Overpeck, Pilla, Ruan,\nSimons-Morton, Scheidt.\nStatistical expertise: Nansel, Overpeck, Pilla, Ruan,\nSimons-Morton.\nObtained funding: Overpeck, Simons-Morton, Scheidt.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Nansel,\nOverpeck, Pilla, Simons-Morton, Scheidt.\nStudy supervision: Overpeck, Simons-Morton.\nREFERENCES\n1.
