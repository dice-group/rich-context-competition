Hypertension is an\nasymptomatic condition that affects 30% or more of\nadults and strongly predicts risk of stroke, coronary\nartery disease, congestive heart failure and renal\nfailure.1,2 Many millions of hypertensive individuals\nremain unaware of their condition3 and, in re-\nsponse, public health guidelines recommend in-\ncreasing the proportion of adults screened for high\nblood pressure.4 However, screening and detection\nleads to the labelling of individuals as hypertensive\nand such labelling may adversely affect some health\nindices. For example, some studies show that\nlabelling increases work absenteeism5\u00ad7 while others\nshow that labelled hypertensives have lower self-\nrated health (SRH) than normotensives.8\u00ad15 This\napparent SRH effect of labelling has been reported\nin comparisons of labelled and unlabelled (unaware\nhypertensive) persons11 and may occur in indivi-\nduals mislabelled (i.e., normotensive persons mis-\ndiagnosed as hypertensive).9 Therefore, even though\nscreening and detection of hypertension is neces-\nsary to prevent the complications of hypertension,\nit may also adversely impact global SRH through\nlabelling effects.\nThe potential sensitivity of global self-health\nratings to hypertension labelling is particularly\nimportant. First, SRH has a prominent role in\nclinical investigation because subjective ratings of\nhealth and well-being are considered to be primary\nend points.16 Further, global SRH is an integrative\nmeasure of health status that has established\ncriterion validity impacting major objective health\noutcomes. For example, global SRH covaries with\nfunctional ability,17,18 prospectively predicts physi-\ncian use19 and mortality across socioeconomic\nstrata20 even after adjustment for objective dis-\nease.21\u00ad23 The predictive utility of SRH is in part\nCorrespondence: Dr SD Barger, Department of Psychology,\nE-mail: Steven.Barger@nau.edu\nwww.nature.com/jhh\nwhy it is routinely collected in public health\nsurveys.24 For example, the global SRH assessment\n\u00ad `How would you rate your health, poor, fair, good,\nvery good or excellent?' \u00ad is a benchmark for quality\nof life in the national strategy for health promotion\nin the US.4 In fact, the first goal of this effort `y is\nto help individuals of all ages increase life expect-\nancy and improve their quality of life [emphasis\nin original]' (p 20).4 Thus, quality of life on a\npopulation level is operationally defined in part by\nglobal self-health appraisals like those shown to be\npressure screening and concomitant hypertensive\nlabelling reduce SRH, then success in some ele-\nments of public health promotion (blood pressure\nscreening and hypertension control) may erode\nprogress in others (quality of life), particularly for\nthose who are mislabelled.\nOur understanding of the scope and character of\nhypertensive labelling effects on SRH is limited for\nseveral reasons. Prior studies have utilized clinic10,25\nor otherwise restricted samples,9,12 enrolled unu-\nsually hypertensive subgroups,25,26 lacked normo-\ntensive controls,27 and/or did not covary potential\nconfounding factors such as antihypertensive treat-\nPopulation-based studies with adequate controls\nwere either small11,13 or lacked independent blood\npressure measurements,8,15 and none have enrolled\nsufficient numbers of racial/ethnic subgroups to\nevaluate the consistency of labelling effects across\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and\nHispanic subpopulations. Finally, in order to\ndistinguish labelling effects from the effects of\nhypertension status it is necessary to examine large\nsamples including hypertensive and normotensive\nindividuals, both labelled and unlabelled (or mis-\nlabelled, as the case may be).\nThe present study evaluated hypertension label-\nling effects on global SRH in the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition  \n(NHANES III),29,30 a large, ethnically diverse, prob-\nability sample of US residents. These data contain\ndetailed demographic assessments, medical his-\ntories, as well as objective measurements of physical\ncharacteristics including blood pressure and BMI.\nprovides a unique opportunity to address labelling\neffects independent of actual blood pressure levels,\nantihypertensive treatment and potential confound-\ning factors. This disaggregation of measured blood\npressure from hypertension labelling permits eva-\nluation of the relative impact of risk labelling and\nactual health risk status. We tested the following\nhypotheses: (1) Is hypertensive labelling associated\nwith poor SRH?, (2) Is hypertension status (actual\nblood pressure) associated with poor SRH?, (3) Is the\neffect of hypertensive labelling similar among normo-\ntensives and hypertensives?, and (4) Are these\nrelations consistent across racial/ethnic groups?\nMaterials and methods\nNHANES III utilizes a complex, stratified multistage\nsampling design that represents the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized population of the US.30 Blacks,\nolder adults, and Mexican\u00adAmericans were over-\nsampled. Participants were interviewed in their\nhome in English or Spanish by NHANES staff, and\nfollowing the interview physical measurements\nwere obtained by a trained health professional.\nAdditional blood pressure measurements were\nobtained for most (80%) participants by a board-\neligible physician during a second physical exam at\na mobile examination centre. The second assess-\nments took place within 4 weeks of the home\ninterview.\nBlood pressure was measured with a mercury\nsphygmomanometer using protocols established by\nthe American Heart Association. Household and\nmobile examination centre examiners initially re-\nceived a day and a half of blood pressure measure-\nment training, were recertified quarterly and\nretrained annually.29\n(17\u00ad90 \u00fe years old), we restricted our analyses to\nleast one valid blood pressure measurement\nand responded to the question about previously dia-\nyears old). All participants provided informed\nconsent for both the home and mobile examination\ncentre evaluations. The data used for this study are\npublicly available from the US National Center for\nHealth Statistics.\nMeasures\nSociodemographic characteristics. We used sev-\neral sociodemographic variables as covariates in all\nanalyses. They included age (in seven categories;\nyears), gender, education (in five categories; 0\u00ad9,\nhold income (approximate quartiles in US dollars;\nto represent non-Hispanic white (N \u00bc 8121), non-\nHispanic black (N \u00bc 5243), Mexican-American\n(N \u00bc 4965), and `other' race/ethnicity categories\ncome responses were missing. Rather than reducing\nour sample via casewise deletion, missing income\nvalues were imputed using age, education, gender,\nethnicity, and smoking status. The direction and\nsignificance of analyses were insensitive to this\nimputation, so we retained the imputed income\nvariable for all analyses.\nHealth characteristics. BMI was calculated as\nweight in kg/height in m2. Measurements were\nobtained by physical examination. We created five\nBMI categories as follows: underweight (BMI\nHypertensive labelling and poorer self-rated health\nSD Barger and MF Muldoon\nJournal of Human Hypertension\n(BMIX40).31 Four dummy codes were used to\nrepresent these five categories. The number of\nphysician visits in the last 12 months (during the\npast 12 months, about how many times did you\nsee or talk to a medical doctor or assistant?) were\nrecoded into four categories (none, 1, 2, 3, or more).\nPhysician visits are higher among labelled normo-\ntensives and may explain differences in health\nperceptions.32 Chronic disease was assessed by the\nself-reported presence or absence of cancer, stroke,\nheart attack, and diabetes. Smoking status was\ncoded as never, former, or current. A very small\nnumber (o0.5%) of missing values for health\ncharacteristics were imputed using age, gender,\nethnicity, education, household income, and smok-\ning status. Analyses were insensitive to these\nimputations so we report statistics using the 19 057\nadult participants described above.\nHypertensive status and hypertensive label status.\nWe created a binary hypertension status variable\n(hypertension if systolic blood pressure (SBP)X140\nor diastolic blood pressure (DBP)X90; otherwise\nnormotensive) based upon the average of blood\npressure readings obtained during the home and\nmobile examination centre exams. In over 80% of\nparticipants this average was derived from six blood\npressure measurements across the two sessions, and\nover 99% of the sample had at least three readings\nfrom one session. A binary hypertension label\nvariable was created based upon each participant's\nanswer to the question `Have you ever been told by a\ndoctor or other health professional that you had\nhypertension, also called high blood pressure?'\nThese two variables were used to create a 2 \u00c2 2\nmatrix from which specific pairwise comparisons\nwere conducted (see Table 1). A final binary variable\nrepresenting current prescription medication use for\nparticipants who reported being labelled as having\nhypertension.\nStatistical analyses\nThe primary dependent variable was SRH, assessed\nwith the question `Would you say your health in\ngeneral is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?'\nSince SRH is an ordered categorical variable, we\nused an ordinal regression model, the cumulative\nodds model33,34 to evaluate differences in SRH as a\nTable 1 Sample demographic characteristics (s.e.) by blood pressure and hypertensive label status\nNormotensive Hypertensive\nUnlabelled, Labelled, Unlabelled, Labelled,\nEthnicity\nYears of education\nSelf-rated health\nNote: Values are weighted to represent the US population.

To examine the effects of mislabelling\namong normotensives, we identified the subset of\nlabelled normotensives who were not receiving\nantihypertensive medication (N \u00bc 391) and com-\npared them to unlabelled normotensives.

First, we replicated a number of similar\nstudies testing labelling effects.9\u00ad14,25 Second, we\nextended this work by showing that labelling effects\non SRH are independent of potential confounding\nby known SRH predictors, such as concurrent\nchronic disease,36 SES,37 and BMI. Since high BMI\nis associated with hypertension and poorer SRH,\nit is an especially potent rival hypothesis for\nlabelling effects.38,39 Third, the NHANES data\nprovide multiple blood pressure measurements to\ndefine hypertensive status, reducing the possibility\nof misclassification error.40 In addition, the rigorous\ntraining of examiners likely provided more reliable\nblood pressure measurement than those obtained in\ntypical hospital or clinic settings.41,42 Finally, the\nsample was substantially larger than in previous\nreports and representative of the adult US popula-\ntion, reinforcing findings from other population-\nbased studies showing adverse hypertensive label-\nTo the extent that a hypertensive label negatively\naffects SRH, among truly hypertensive individuals\nthis is offset by the health benefits of subsequent\nantihypertensive treatment. On the other hand,\nnormotensive persons mislabelled as hypertensive\nenjoy no such benefit. Based upon this population\nsample, we estimate that 12.6% of normotensive\nUS adults are labelled as having hypertension.\nAlthough most of these people are on antihyperten-\nsive medication, some are mislabeled due to factors\nsuch as blood pressure variability, poor measure-\nment technique and miscommunication. The poten-\ntial for adverse labelling effects may be exacerbated\nby recent guidelines which recommend labelling\nthose with lower blood pressure (i.e., 120\u00ad\ntensive.1 In any case, the potential negative con-\nsequences of mislabelling remain unaddressed in\npublic and private health screening initiatives.\nSeveral limitations of the present work should be\nconsidered. The cross-sectional design cannot ad-\ndress the causal direction of this association, and we\nrelied upon self-reports to assess prior hypertension\ndiagnosis (i.e., labelling). However, error in these\nreports would probably bias the analyses towards\nthe null hypothesis. Looking ahead, longitudinal\nstudies could prospectively document the effects of\nhypertensive labelling on SRH, and also assess\nwhether such labelling affects clinical outcomes.\nIn this regard, one prospective study found that the\nadverse effects of labelling on SRH were limited to\nthose taking medication 1 year postlabelling.27\nHowever, that report was based upon hypertensive\nparticipants enrolled in a clinical trial of blood\npressure treatment. Other SRH predictors were\nuncontrolled in the analyses and, in general,\nparticipants in clinical trials often report gains in\nOdds of Lower Self-Rated Health\nWhite\nBlack\nMexican-Amercian\nNormotensives Hypertensives\nFigure 2 Odds of lower self-rated health for individuals labelled\nas hypertensive by actual hypertension status and race/ethnicity.\nAll values are adjusted for age, gender, education, annual\nhousehold income, body mass index, smoking, physician visits\nin the last 12 months, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and\nthe presence of cancer, stroke, heart attack, and diabetes.
