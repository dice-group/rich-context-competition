Morbidity and disability be-\nfore death have a tremendous impact\non such persons, their families, and the\nhealth care delivery system. Health care\nuse increases substantially as people\nall deaths in the United States oc-\ncurred among persons 65 years and\nand older.2 It is therefore important to\nhave a clear description of the health\nstatus and quality of life before death\nfor this population. The theory of com-\npression of morbidity3 posits that most\npersons would survive to the end of\ntheir biologically endowed life span and\ndie of natural causes. The prevalence\nof disability and the proportion of life\nlived with disability would therefore de-\ncrease. Although this may be an ideal\npersonal goal that could also reduce the\nburden on the health care system, other\ncommentators predict that in the face\nof continued increases in total life ex-\npectancy, an extension of the period of\ndisability prior to death may be an in-\nevitable consequence of living to an ad-\nvanced age.4-5 United States residents\nmay instead be living a longer life with\nworsening health.6\nAlthough no consensus exists,\nmany studies have described the pat-\ntern of change in morbidity and dis-\nability among the general US popula-\ntion of older adults.6-11 Quality of life\nprior to death has been studied less\nthoroughly.12 This study used data\nMortality Followback Surveys to\nexamine the changes in the use of\nformal medical care, disability, and\noverall quality of life in the year\nbefore death among older persons\nliving in the United States and to\nexamine how this change varied by\nsex and age at death.\nMETHODS\nNational Mortality\nFollowback Survey\nThe National Center for Health Statis-\ntics periodically conducts the National\nAuthor Affiliations: Department of Preventive Medi-\ncine and Epidemiology, Loyola University Stritch School\nof Medicine, Maywood, Ill.\nCorresponding Author and Reprints: Youlian Liao,\nMD, Department of Preventive Medicine and Epide-\nmiology, Loyola University Stritch School of Medi-\nyliao@wpo.it.luc.edu).\nContext The population is aging and life expectancy is increasing, but whether mor-\nbidity and disability late in life also increase is unknown.\nObjective To examine whether the use of health care services, disability and cog-\nnitive function, and overall quality of life in the year before death among older adults\nhas changed over time.\nwhich were probability samples of all deaths in the United States with response rates\nof next of kin of 90% and 88% for those aged 65 years and older.\nParticipants Next of kin were asked to report the health status of a total of 9179\nand 1.6 million decedents aged 65 years and older.\nMain Outcome Measures Days of hospital or nursing home stays, number and\nlength of disability in 5 activities of daily living, duration of impairment in 3 measures\nof cognitive function, and an overall sickness score among individuals aged 65 through\n84 years and those aged 85 years and older.\nResults Women used significantly fewer hospital and nursing home services in the last\nservices; mean reduction 18.4 nights for nursing home for women aged 65-84 years and\n42.3 nights for women 85 years).

Most param-\neters for men aged 65 through 84 years did not change significantly.\nConclusions Men and women at least 85 years old in the US experienced a better\noverall quality of life in the last year of life in 1993 than those in 1986. Most measures\nfor men and women aged 65 through 84 years improved or did not change.\nMortality Followback Surveys on prob-\nability samples of all deaths and ob-\ntains in-depth information from dece-\nsurveyswerethefifthandsixthsuchsur-\nveys13-15 to gather disability, activities of\ndaily living (ADL), lifestyle, and other\nhealth informationin the last year of life.\nDeathcertificatesweredrawnfromthe\ncurrentmortalitysample,a10%system-\natic sample of the death certificates of\nthe 50 states, the District of Columbia,\nandtheindependentregistrationareaof\nNew York City. Because of respondent\nconsentrequirements,OregonandSouth\nthese certificates, a complex sampling\ndesign was used to ensure that enough\ndecedents from certain strata would be\nselected.Somepopulations(eg,blacks)\nand some diseases (eg, cardiovascular\ndiseaseandexternalcauses)wereover-\nsampled. The final sample represents a\nnational 1% probability sample of all\ndeathsinthesurvey-specifiedageranges,\nThe next of kin, identified on the de-\ncedent'sdeathcertificate,wascontacted\nby personalized letter and asked to par-\nticipate in the survey.

Infor-\nmation was obtained on the dece-\ndent's ability to perform 5 self-care ac-\ntivities: walking, bathing or showering,\nusing the toilet (including getting to and\nfrom the toilet), dressing, and eating.\nIf the decedent had difficulty in doing\nany of the activities, respondents were\nasked to indicate the length of time the\ndecedent experienced difficulty for each\nactivity. Cognitive function in the last\nyear of life was evaluated by asking\nwhether the decedent had trouble un-\nderstanding where he/she was, remem-\nbering what year it was, and recogniz-\ning family members or good friends.\nThe impairment of each function was\nclassified by 4 categories: never or\nhardly ever, only in last few hours or\ndays before death, some of the time, and\nall or most of the time.\nData Analysis\nDecedentsincludedinthisanalysiswere\nthose 65 years and older at death.\nAnalyses were performed by sex and by\nyears, and those 85 years and older. Use\nof health care services and numbers of\ndisabilities in the last year of life of de-\ncedents were compared between the 2\nsurvey years with several approaches.\nFirst, we compared the length of hos-\npital or nursing home stay and the pro-\nportion of decedents with limitation in\neach of the 5 ADLs and in each of the\n3 cognitive measures. Then we con-\nstructed 2 opposite-extreme catego-\nries for each of the following indica-\ntors: use of service, less than 1 week of\ntotal hospital and nursing home stay\n(minimum use) vs 6 months or longer\ncombined hospital and nursing home\nstays (extensive use); ADL, no diffi-\nculty in all 5 ADLs or limited for less\nthan 30 days if any (minimally re-\nstricted) vs difficulty in at least 2 ADLs\nfor 6 months or longer (severely re-\nstricted); cognitive function, no im-\npairment in all 3 domains of function\nor in only the last few hours or days be-\nfore death if any (normal) vs having im-\npairment in at least 2 functions all or\nmost of the time (severely impaired);\nand overall quality of life in the last year,\nminimal use of service and minimal re-\nstriction in ADL and normal cognitive\nfunction (good quality) vs at least 1\nindicator described above that was in\nthe unfavorable extreme (severely\nimpaired).\nFinally, we created a summary sick-\nness score for each decedent jointly con-\nsidering the severity and length of each\nservice used, disability, and impair-\nment. We began by assigning scores for\neach group of indicators: service use,\nADL, and cognitive function. Each in-\ndicator consisted of a various number\nof disability items, and different dis-\nabilities may not represent the same ex-\ntent of sickness (eg, difficulty in eat-\ning vs walking). It was therefore\nnecessary to weight different items and\nto standardize the scores of the 3 indi-\ncators. For service use, the score is the\ntotal days of all hospital and nursing\nhome stays. For ADL and cognitive\nfunction, assuming severity of a dys-\nfunction and its prevalence are nega-\ntively related, the score was calculated\nas Wi\nTi\n/Wi\n, where Wi\nis the inverse\nof the prevalence rate of disability i\nin\nthe combined data, Ti\nis the duration\n(days) of disability. We assigned 0, 5,\nof impairment in cognitive function, re-\nspectively. The scores for service use,\nADL, and cognitive function were then\nsummed up to derive a single measure\nof overall sickness. This score ignores\nthe interrelationships among 3 indica-\ntors but should correctly order dece-\ndents according to severity of disabili-\nties. A higher score (with day as the\nunit) represents a worse quality of life\ncompared with a lower score.\nThe National Mortality Followback\nSurvey is a stratified random sample\nthat allows for projections of national\nestimates from the sample. Data were\nweighted by SUDAAN software16 to be\nrepresentative of the age, sex, and ra-\ncial composition noted on all death cer-\ntificates and for factors determining the\nprobability of selection. The response\nrate of informants was also adjusted in\nthe weighting process. The t test was\nused to compare the age-specific dif-\nference between the 2 survey years and\nof hospital or nursing home stay were\nlog-transformed in the statistical tests.\nMultivariate regression analysis was\nperformed to adjust for changes be-\ntween the 2 survey years in the distri-\nbution of the relationship between\nproxy respondents and decedent\n(spouse, child/parent, sibling/other rela-\ntive, or other) and the living arrange-\nment of the decedents before death\n(lived alone or lived with spouse, or\nnonspouse). To examine whether the\nchanges in sickness score were signifi-\ncantly different by age, the interaction\nterm year \u00d7 age was tested in the re-\ngression model.\nRESULTS\nBasic demographic data for the US de-\nTABLE 1.
