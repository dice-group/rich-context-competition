This quantitative research\nstudy analyzed universities' overall private contributions to determine whether there was a significant difference in the\npercentage of overall financial support to the institutions following a year of athletics success. For this study, athletics success\nincluded participation in either the Division I (DI) men's basketball National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Final\nFour or DI Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Bowl Game. The study focused on a period\nEducation [VSE] Survey)--satisfying the criteria above, then comparing them with the baseline (all institutions) during the\nsame period of time to determine whether the change in the percentage of overall contribution was statistically significant\nover a 2-year period. The results show a significant statistical difference of more than double in the percent increase of overall\nprivate contributions for institutions with athletics success compared with all higher education institutions. Furthermore,\na small statistical difference was found for the athletics success in private institutions compared with public institutions\nthat experienced similar athletics success. No difference was found by region, for history of athletics success, or between\nbasketball or football athletics success for those institutions experiencing athletics success.

When a university's athletics\nprogram is successful at an elite level, the media exposure can\ncast a wide spotlight and positive perception on that institu-\ntion (Goff, 2000). This begs the following question: When a\nDivision Institution experiences a year(s) of \"athletics suc-\ncess,\" how does that athletics success impact an institution in\nterms of private contributions? For this study, athletics suc-\ncess included Division I (DI) institutions that competed in a\nfootball Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Football Game or\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's\nBasketball Final Four. This operational definition of success\nwas conservative in nature to include a broad range of defini-\ntions for athletics success. This definition is even sometimes\nconsidered to be \"elite athletics success.\" Fifty-two DI uni-\nversities and 129 total samples were studied over a period of\nhad a significant impact on overall private contributions to\nthe university. Private contributions included donations to the\nentire university, including academic and athletic areas, and\nalso restricted and unrestricted giving to the institution.\nUniversities in particular depend upon a large majority of\ntheir resources from external forces such as private contribu-\ntions from individuals, corporations, and foundations (Lee &\nClery, 2012). These external entities have power over the\norganization to determine whether it receives the resources\nand how the resources should be spent (Froosman, 1999).\nBecause these funds are not required, but voluntary, the out-\nside agencies have influence with their contributions.\nTherefore it is essential to understand and analyze relation-\nships that exist in donors' motivations for their private con-\ntributions, which may include athletics success or other\nvariables (Wunnava & Okunade, 2013). Relationships with\nexternal entities therefore are critical to maintain and enhance\nthose resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Intercollegiate\nathletics have played a central role in higher education and\n1The University of Memphis, TN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAdam G.

Alumni giving, in the form of private\ndonations, are increasingly important in the current eco-\nnomic climate challenging higher education. In fiscal year\nnation's colleges and universities (Council for Aid to\nEducation [CAE], 2013). Forty-four percent of contributions\nwere directed from individuals, while 30% were generated\nTheoretical Framework\nThe theoretical framework that follows ties together the\nthought that the perception, image, or identity a potential\ndonor holds or university portrays may be influential on the\ndecision of donors to contribute or increase their monetary\nsupport. Each of the theories below are closely associated\nwith athletics, in that often times, athletics receives the most\nexposure at an institution and is used as a conduit for the\nuniversity's image. A successful athletics program may con-\nvey a positive image overall of the university and make a\ndonor more inclined to give to that institution in regard to the\nenhanced exposure and feelings of pride or achievement for\nan institution they associate with personally.\nBecause athletics have an impact on the external environ-\nment and perception of the institution, these theories align\nwith the premise of this study. Understanding how these theo-\nries are woven into the fabric between athletics and the uni-\nversity can be beneficial to administrators to take advantage\nof situations where athletics success can enhance the image,\nperception, identity, or external environments in their favor.\nResource Dependence Theory\nResource dependence theory developed by Pfeffer and\nSalancik (1978) operates on the concept that organizations\ndepend on their environments for resources, both internally\nand externally. Universities in particular depend upon a large\nmajority of their resources from external forces including\nkey stakeholders and donors to the institution. These external\nentities have power over the organization to determine\nwhether it receives the resources and how those resources\nshould be spent (Froosman, 1999). Depending on the needs\nand scarcity, the university can be highly dependent upon the\nsupplier of those funds (Casciaro & Piskorski, 2005).\nResource dependence theory states that institutions are\ndependent on external entities to survive (Bess & Dee, 2012).\nExternal constituents not only determine whether or not an\norganization will receive resources but they also determine the\nextent to which the organization uses the resources. These con-\nstituents may be influenced by the outward perception of the\ninstitution for their donor motivations, which may be influenced\nby athletics success. Resource dependence theory implies that\nthere is a power relationship. In addition to adapting to the envi-\nronment, organizations must maintain strong external relation-\nships with constituents to attain resources for stability.\nSystems Theory\nSystems theory originates from early research by Bertalanffy\ntional environments asserts that institutions have an inter-\ndependent relationship with the external environment\n(Bess & Dee, 2012). Ongoing transactions occur on a con-\ntinuous basis between the organization and the environ-\nment. Key characteristics of the environment sustain the\norganization.\nThis theory relates how athletics has a direct and indi-\nrect impact on the institution. These direct and indirect\nimpacts range from perception to financial. Athletics\ngains much public attention, and public opinion can be\ncast on the entire institution based on positive and nega-\ntive associations. Athletic scandals, criminal arrests, or\npoor academic results can have a negative perception,\nwhile conversely, athletics success, community service\nand involvement, and academic success and graduation in\nathletics can lead to positive perceptions. Under this the-\nory, reciprocal relationship exists between the organiza-\ntion and the environment. Such a relationship could occur\nin regard to athletics success and the external environ-\nment, the community where the university resides in being\na primary example. This relationship could be positive,\nneutral, or negative.\nInstitutional Theory\nInstitutional theory addresses the significance of under-\nstanding external expectations for institutions (Bess &\ncolleges and universities gain legitimacy through coer-\ncive, mimetic, and normative conformity. Choices made\nby the institution are limited by external pressures from\nthe environment. Institutional theory explains that institu-\ntions reflect the attitudes, values, and beliefs of the exter-\nnal environment in which the institution is embedded\n(Bess & Dee, 2012). Such might be the case with the sur-\nrounding community in which an institution is located,\ndepending upon the community's actions and values may\ndetermine to the extent in which the athletics program is\nembraced or neglected. This is often the case in communi-\nties that place a heightened emphasis or expectations on\ninstitutions in regard to athletics success. One example is\nin the Southeastern Conference (SEC), where the fan\nbases can be obsessive and place great personal and emo-\ntional investments on the performance of their athletic\nprograms.\nLiterature Review\nRelationships Between Athletics Success and the\nDirect Impact on Universities\nThe basis of a positive relationship between donor giving and\nathletics team success is to an extent a psychological perspec-\ntive. James Strode (2006), in his research on this topic, noted\nthat the relationship begins with the concept of achievement.\nAthletics donors earmark their gifts to athletics because of\na special affinity or because of the incentives and benefits of\ngiving to athletics (Howard & Stinson, 2008). Some have ana-\nlyzed whether giving to athletics has produced a crowding-out\neffect, hurting overall academic giving. For instance, Howard\nand Stinson (2008) found that a shift toward greater athletics\ngiving was present at schools with major football programs.\nThe researchers deduced that schools did experience giving\nincreases around athletics team success. Their research\nshows that the crowding-out effect does not occur, on aver-\nage, at these institutions but that both parties (athletics and\nacademic) benefit from success (Howard & Stinson,\nThe definition of success is different to each individual,\nalthough Humphreys and Mondello (2005) closely studied\nthe effects of post-season football bowl games and NCAA DI\nmen's basketball tournament appearances. They define suc-\ncess as partaking in post-season play. Again football and bas-\nketball, the most visible sports, generate the most interest and\ncontributions from donors. These are also the sports which\nreceive the most media exposure nationwide. For this study,\nthe definition was even more conservative and included only\nuniversities reaching the DI men's Final Four or a football\nBCS Bowl Game.\nMost importantly, Humphreys and Mondello (2005)\nfound that restricted giving (giving specifically earmarked\nfor athletics) did increase with appearances by schools in\npost-season play, although unrestricted giving did not\nincrease. Unrestricted giving typically responds to variations\nin economic conditions, and athletics success does not prove\nto induce donors to increase this unrestricted giving.\nIn 2007, Humphreys and Mondello reviewed a compre-\nhensive data set for 320 colleges and universities drawn from\nthe Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System for the\ntion studies. Their data included giving by alumni, founda-\ntions, corporations, and other sources. They studied both\nrestricted and unrestricted donations in the study. They found\nno increase in unrestricted donations as a result of any mea-\nsure of success of either football or men's basketball pro-\ngrams. Restricted giving appeared to rise at both public and\nprivate universities in response to success of the basketball\nteam, and at public institutions when the football team is\ninvited to a bowl game.\nHoward and Stinson (2007) found similar findings that\nless prestigious academic institutions are influenced more by\nathletics success and have a larger portion of total institu-\ntional gifts allocated in support of intercollegiate athletics\nprograms. According to Litan, Orszag, and Orszag (2003),\nthere is no relationship between spending more on athletics\nand winning more. Second, increased spending on coaches'\nsalaries has no significant relationship to success or increased\nrevenue, according to a follow-up study.\nThese studies would be another factor to examine each\ninstitution on a case-by-case basis to determine why this is\nso. One could hypothesize back to the culture and environ-\nment discussed in the \"Theoretical Framework\" section that\nrelates to giving; stated that the mission, image, identity, and\nexpectations of the institution affect perceptions and, there-\nfore, emphasis placed on athletics success and giving. Simply\nstated, each institution's perception and relationship with\nathletics is shaped by their own identity and community or\nenvironment in which each institition is located.\nMeer and Rosen (2008) found when a male graduate's\nformer team wins its conference championship, his dona-\ntions for general purposes increased by about 7% and his\ndonations to the athletics program increased by about the\nsame percentage. This study indicates another perspective\nthat overall athletics success drives overall private contribu-\ntions to an institution. Rhoads and Gerking (2000) also found\na positive relationship by examining bowl appearances in\nfootball and NCAA tournament appearances in basketball,\nwhich resulted in an increase in overall alumni contributions\nto the institution.\nEthical Issues and Litigation in College Athletics\nLarge ethical concerns persist within college athletics. Walter\nByers, who served as NCAA executive director from 1951 to\n1987, was charged with the dual mission of keeping intercol-\nlegiate athletics clean while generating millions of dollars\neach year for the colleges. Byers believes that modern-day\ncollege sports are no longer a student activity or amateur\nsport, but they are a high-dollar commercial enterprise, and\ncollege athletes should have the same access to the free mar-\nket as their coaches and colleges (Byers, 1995).\nCollege athletics is now beginning to see this proliferation\nwith recent litigation involving student-athlete's names,\nimages, or likeness (O'Bannon vs. NCAA, 2014) and stu-\ndent-athlete compensation in regard to EA Sports video\ngames (Keller vs. NCAA, 2014). With these recent rulings,\nstudent-athletes may be compensated for use of their names,\nimages, or likeness. While the Keller case was settled out of\ncourt, the O'Bannon case entitles student-athletes to be com-\npensated via a trust with a cap no less than US$5,000 per\nyear, depending on academic eligibility (O'Bannon vs.\nNCAA, 2014). This opens up a new dynamic whereby stu-\ndent-athletes are now sharing a portion of revenues. These\nrecent rulings appeal to earlier research suggesting the expo-\nsure and exploitation of amateur student-athletes (Sack &\n4 SAGE Open\nIndirect Benefits of Athletics Success\nIn addition to individual benefits, there may also be indirect\neffects to public institutions in terms of state appropriations.\nfound that those fielding DI Football Bowl Subdivision\n(FBS) football teams receive about 8% more from their state\nlegislature than otherwise comparable universities that do\nnot participate in DI (FBS) football. Participation seems to\nbe what matters. Success is less important. State subsidies\nappear to be no greater for universities with top 20 or bowl-\nparticipating football teams.\nBowen and Shulman (2001) found that among a top\ndonor group, the top 5% of donors to universities do not, on\nthe whole, care about athletics and instead cite more interest\nin supporting undergraduate education, intellectual free-\ndom, and extracurricular activities. Donors of today are\nlooking to support broad participation, affecting the largest\nnumber of lives possible. Most donors often identify with\nthe many students who are leading lives similar to the ones\nthey led while in school, which is more than likely not as\none of a few star athletes. Ultimately, donors want their\nschools to place less, not more, emphasis on collegiate ath-\nletics (Bowen & Shulman, 2001). Although this research\nshows evidence of no relationship between success and giv-\ning, the pervading outcome of research on this topic reveals\na positive relationship between the two.\nThe most notable university admissions case as it\nrelates to athletics success originates from Boston College\nUniversity and the \"Flutie Factor\" that resulted from Doug\ncase, Boston College experienced an unprecedented 30%\napplication increase in the 2 years following the legendary\nSince this case, there are a number of other similar situa-\ntions where universities have experienced a spike in applica-\ntions and have increased their enrollment due to athletics\nsuccess. McEvoy (2006), in an article written for the United\nStates Sports Academy, shows empirical support for admis-\nsions applications increases and provides a number of addi-\ntional case studies and previous research on the topic, all\ncontributing further to this fact. Athletics serve as a market-\ning tool and rallying point for the institution, leading to\nrecruiting more students, not just student-athletes (McEvoy,\n2006). In addition, and equally as important to higher educa-\ntion, empirical evidence finds that athletics prominence and\nsuccess were related to increased out-of-state enrollment\nRecently, Butler University after their consecutive runs to\nthe men's Final Four experienced an increase of 41% in\napplications, athletics donations increased by 200% (US$1\nmillion to US$3 million over 2 years), and alumni giving\nalso estimate the public exposure Butler received was esti-\nGonzaga, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Texas\nChristian University (TCU), and Boise State have all seen\nsimilar results in applications and donations (DiConsiglio,\nToma and Cross (1998) also found athletics success\nrelates to an increase in applications. They compared the 30\ninstitutions that won national championships in football and\ninstitutions to see if an increase in admissions applications\noccurred after athletics success. The researchers found that\nunder most circumstances notable increases resulted in\nadmissions applications received, both in the year of, and\nover the 3 years following the championship season (Toma\ntions with DI athletics programs attract more applications\nand enroll students with higher average SAT scores than\nsimilar institutions that do not participate in DI sports.\nMcCormick and Tinsley (1987) discovered the same results\nwhen they examined 63 universities, each in one of the six\n\"big-time\" athletics conferences, compared with other col-\nleges and universities.\nFleming (2007), in a report on Jaren and Devin Pope's\nresearch around sports success and admissions, declares the\nempirical evidence among the top 20 football schools and\ntop 16 basketball schools, has an increase of between 2% and\n8% in admissions. Fleming noted that Pope found an\nincreased pool of applicants across the schools with both\nhigh and low SAT scores. While the amount of applicants\nmay increase, critics say that the yield decreases. However,\nPope and Pope (2009) argue that the greater amount of appli-\ncations simply allows the institution to be more selective and\nimprove their incoming freshmen class. Tucker (2005) also\nfound significance in the relation to football success and\nenhanced incoming freshmen's SAT scores from studying\nThe most influential piece of Pope and Pope's (2009)\nresearch is that it was conducted over a 19-year span, elimi-\nnating the chance for critics to claim that the increase in\nadmissions was not sustainable. This time period allows the\nstudies to show the increase as well as the stability that fol-\nlowed (Pope & Pope, 2009). In an interview with George\nMason University's press secretary, it was revealed that the\nschool had a number of positive outcomes from their Final\nFour appearance in 2006. On top of admissions increasing,\nthe general visibility and awareness of the institution created\na genuine sense of pride in those affiliated with the university\nand produced a special curiosity from those who did not\nknow about the university (Pope & Pope, 2009).\nMost recently, Koo and Dittmore (2014) determined that\nwinning football teams are related to increases in both aca-\ndemic and athletic donations. They ruled out the idea that\nathletic donations \"crowd out\" academic donations (Koo &\nDittmore, 2012), finding rather that \"there was a significant\nand positive causal relationship between athletic factors and\nacademic giving.\" For example, the coefficient on athletic\ngiving implied that for every US$1 increase in athletic giv-\ning, the current dollars of voluntary support restricted to aca-\ndemic purposes will increase by 48 cents.\nBased on this evidence showing a positive relationship\nbetween university admissions and athletics team success,\ninstitutions of higher education have a choice of how to capi-\ntalize on this phenomenon. McEvoy (2006), in his research,\ngives a detailed listing of options for the university. First, the\nuniversity could admit more applicants of \"comparable qual-\nity\" resulting in increased enrollment and, thus, additional\nrevenue. Second, the university could increase the \"rigor in\nits admissions process,\" admitting the same number of stu-\ndents as before, although with better qualifications, increas-\ning the average quality of student. Third, a hybrid approach\ncould be taken by only slightly increasing the applicant pool\nand increasing admissions standards (McEvoy, 2006).\nRegardless of the option that is chosen, the institution should\nbenefit.\nAlthough athletics has been viewed as an entity that pri-\nmarily needs university subsidies and can contribute to the\n\"cost disease\" at many institutions nationwide, there are ben-\nefits. In select cases, programs at the highest levels generate\nrevenue and can help alleviate financial burdens for their\ninstitutions. Anderson (2012) found a positive link between\nathletics success and donations, applications, and enhanced\nfreshmen students' academic standards. His study finds that\nwinning reduces acceptance rates (enhancing selectivity),\nand increases donations, applications, academic reputation,\nin-state enrollment, and incoming SAT scores. Prior to this\nstudy, conflicting studies existed as to whether athletics suc-\ncess increases overall donations to institutions (Anderson,\nFrom his conclusions, Anderson (2012) states,\nConsider a school that improves its season wins by 5 games (the\napproximate difference between a 25th percentile season and a\n75th percentile season). Changes of this magnitude occur\napproximately 8% of the time over a 1-year period and 13% of\nthe time over a 2-year period. This school may expect alumni\npercentage points (2%), in-state enrollment to increase by 76\nstudents (3%), and incoming 25th percentile SAT scores to\nAnother recent case is the first of its kind; Louisiana State\nUniversity (LSU)Athletics announced in the summer of 2012\nthat they will begin transferring up to US$7.2 million annu-\nally to the academic side of campus from athletics revenues.\nThis is the first case where an athletics program has pledged\nto help contribute to the overall university instead of receiv-\ning a subsidy (Addo, 2012). Other institutions support the\nacademic side, but it is usually on a year-to-year basis and not\npledged over a period of years. In recent years, athletic sup-\nport of academic initiatives has grown at many institutions.\nHowever, the support of academics by athletics is rare; 98 of\nprograms; the median deficit was US$9.4 million (National\nCollegiate Athletic Association [NCAA], 2010). Yet schools\nremain caught up in an ever-escalating \"arms race\"--at the\nexpense of academic scholarships, facilities, and faculty\n(Benedict & Keteyian, 2013). It is a case of a \"go big or go\nhome\" mentality, which can either pay off large for a small\namount of schools or leave institutions \"footing the bill\" for\ntheir athletics programs.\nData and Method\nThe research questions addressed in this study were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: What financial impact does \"ath-\nletics success\" have on a Division Institution in terms of\noverall private contributions? Specifically, is there a sig-\nnificant difference in the percentage of overall private\nsupport to the institution following a year of athletics\nsuccess?\nResearch Question 2: What impact does regional loca-\ntion, public or private affiliation, or history of athletics\nsuccess have on overall private contributions using the\nsame measurements?\nResearch Question 3: Does the difference in percent\nchange from private contributions differ between DI insti-\ntutions with basketball athletics success compared with\nDI institutions with football athletics success?\nThis study was a quantitative analysis of public, second-\nary data obtained through the CAE's Voluntary Support of\nEducation (VSE) Survey, a voluntary survey of higher edu-\ncation institutions with standardized data pulled from their\nannual reports. This survey was selected because it records\nprivate support to nearly each institution of higher education\nand is the most comprehensive and complete annual survey\non overall private contributions. The CAE has conducted\nsurvey research on the private support of education since\ninto a large-scale annual research and dissemination pro-\ngram, the VSE. The survey is open to all colleges, universi-\nties, and private elementary and secondary schools in the\nUnited States. The Council for Advancement and Support of\nEducation (CASE) co-sponsors the survey. Based on these\nresults, CAE develops and disseminates national estimates of\nThe VSE Survey is designed to obtain information on the\namounts, sources, donor-specified purposes, forms of private\ngifts, grants, and bequests received by educational institu-\ntions. The 2013 VSE Survey collected data on funds raised\nfrom private sources for the fiscal year beginning July 1,\nreporting on different fiscal calendars (CAE, 2013). In July\n2012, CAE mailed an announcement that the survey was\n6 SAGE Open\ntutions. For this study, the category of \"total support\" was\nidentified as the main dependent variable. Total support was\ndefined as the total of outright giving and deferred giving,\neducation institutions had provided complete data, including\nall samples studied for this research project. A baseline of\nfinancial support in terms of difference in giving by percent\nwas totaled for all higher education institutions utilizing\nathletics success and a year after the 2011 athletics success.\nThis baseline was used against the sample to determine\nwhether a statistically significant difference was found. The\npopulation as defined by athletics success was applied for the\nwas a significant difference in the percentage of contribu-\ntions to the university utilizing a one-sample t-test analysis in\nSPSS (19th edition). Subsequent research questions regard-\ning differences in region were analyzed using a one-way\nANOVA test; public or private affiliation, history of athletics\nsuccess, and basketball versus football success were ana-\nlyzed using an independent samples t test.\nAll higher education institutions that participated in the\nVSE Survey were included in the study, which ranged from\n2013). The institutions, including DI athletically successful\nones, were used as a baseline for comparison with those\nschools that experienced athletics success. Based on the defi-\nnition for athletics success, 40 institutions participated in a\n(NCAA, 2013). One institution did not report data in the sur-\nvey and was excluded, leaving the sample size for DI basket-\nball at 39.

A\none-sample t test was administered to determine significance\nat the .05 alpha level. Effect size was measured after the t test\nto determine the effect size of any significant statistical dif-\nferences found. A Cohen's d test was utilized to find the\neffect size of each significant result (Cohen, 1988).\nThe data were segmented including region, public versus\nprivate affiliation, history of athletics success, and basketball\nversus football success. A one-way ANOVA test was used to\ncompare the groups in terms of regions (East, North/Midwest,\nSouth, and West). Each region was compared with the base-\nline via a one-sample t test. If a region was found to be sig-\nnificant, then that region(s) was (were) compared against the\nother regions in an independent samples t-test comparison.\nIndependent samples t tests were utilized to compare the\ngroups in terms of public versus private affiliation, history of\nathletics success, and basketball versus football success.\nStudy Demographics\nThe study included 129 observations during the last 10 years,\nathletics success was defined as participating in the men's DI\nNCAA Final Four in basketball or a BCS Bowl Game in\nfootball. Ninety of these institutions studied participated in a\nBCS Bowl Game, while the remaining 39 participated in\nmen's DI NCAA Final Four. Fifteen of these institutions\nwere private institutions, while the remaining 114 were pub-\nlic institutions. Eighty-three institutions were identified as\nhaving a \"history of athletics success.\" A history of athletics\nsuccess in this study was defined as a school wining two or\nmore national championships in that sport. Forty-six institu-\ntions were identified as no \"history of athletics success\" for\nthis study. Schools were also placed into a geographical\nregion and analyzed. Twenty-two institutions were listed in\nthe \"East\" region of the country, 52 were listed as \"North/\nMidwest\" region of the country, 36 were included in the\n\"South\" region of the United States, and lastly, 19 institu-\ntions were identified in the \"West\" region of the country\nResults\nResearch Question 1\nFor Research Question 1, a one-sample t test was conducted\ncomparing 129 DI institutions with athletics success to the\nan average of 1,003 respondents for all higher education\nchange during a 2-year period for all higher education insti-\ninstitutions as well.

Those institu-\ntions with athletics success exhibited a median percent\nchange of 12.84% (Figure 1). As stated above, this difference\nis statistically significant (p = .002). This indicates an aver-\nage increase of more than double for an institution that expe-\nriences athletics success over the baseline. The effect size or\nCohen's d for this result was 0.55. This result of .55 indicates\nthe two groups' means differ by more than half a standard\ndeviation. This difference is larger than .5, which is consid-\nered a medium effect size (Cohen, 1988). The formula used\nto compute the Cohen's d effect size was d = (t \u00d7 2) / (sqrt\n(df)), where, d = Cohen's d value or effect size (standardized\nmean difference), t = t-test value, and df = degrees of\nfreedom.\nResearch Question 2\nFor the second research question, the study conducted sev-\neral tests on each of the variables. For the variable private\nversus public, an independent samples t test was conducted\n0.34 (Table 3).

The increase was even more pow-\nerful because the baseline also included the athletically\nsuccessful institutions, which they (the independent\nvariable--athletically successful institutions) are being\ncompared against. These results indicate there are indeed\nfinancial implications for institutions that are athletically\nsuccessful to reap the benefits.\nFigure 2.

DI = Division I.\nThe study found that regardless of public or private affili-\nation, history of athletics success, or region, those DI institu-\ntions that experience athletics success, either in basketball or\nfootball, saw a significant increase in overall private contri-\nbutions to their institution. These results are especially mean-\ningful because the impacts on the institution are of a financial\nnature. These enhanced resources can facilitate desired\ngrowth for the institution in manners it deems appropriate.\nThese resources and impact may have a long-lasting result\nand cultivate future financial gains in the process. These\nfindings relate back to the resource dependence theory, in\nthat institutions are dependent on external stakeholders for\nresources and, therefore, must be cognizant of motivations\nand influencers those stakeholders may hold, which could\ninclude athletics success (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978).\nThe study also found a marginally significant difference\nbetween private institutions that experienced athletics suc-\ncess compared with public institutions with the same athlet-\nics success. These results show there may be a particular\nadvantage to private institutions that experience athletics\nsuccess compared with baseline institutions. In this instance,\nthe impact is very noticeable, with a 28% increase over 2\nyears compared with a 5% increase for all other institutions\nduring the same period of time. This was more than five\ntimes an increase for private institutions' overall financial\nsupport compared with the mean percent increase for all\nhigher education institutions.\nThe results regarding the second research question were\nevaluated by several statistical analyses. For differences by\nregion, all four regions were found to not be different statisti-\ncally from one another by way of a one-way ANOVA test.\nHowever, analyzing the data in more depth, the study found\nthe South region to be the largest in terms of percent change in\ncontributions over 2 years, 16.8%, while the West region had\nthe lowest value at a 9.25% change. The only region that was\nsignificantly different versus the baseline independently was\nsents a large effect size, indicating a possible interaction effect\non the group as a whole as none of the other regions differed\nsignificantly when individually compared with the baseline\nusing a one-sample t test. Another contributing factor may be\nsmaller degrees of freedom for each group individually, which\ncould account for why the other groups did not see a statisti-\ncally significant difference from the baseline individually.\nThis was ascertained to be true by subsequent tests showing\nthe regions not differing from one another, and the three\nregions (excluding the South region) showing significance\nwhen compared with the baseline in a one-sample t test.\nFor the variables private versus public affiliation and\nimpact on institutions with athletics success, the study found\na marginal significant difference between the two in an inde-\neffect size was considered to be relatively small. Examining\nthe two individually compared with the baseline, the study\nfound both to be statistically significant. The private institu-\ntions that experienced athletics success had a mean percent\n1.40. The effect size for the private institutions was very\nlarge. This indicates a very strong relationship between ath-\nletics success and the increase in contributions in terms of\npercent for private institutions. The public institutions also\nsaw a significant difference from the baseline with a mean\neffect size (0.50), but not as significant as private institu-\ntions. This represents a significant finding for public institu-\ntions, and even more so in regard to those with a private\naffiliation. One thought on why this may be is the culture of\nphilanthropyatprivateinstitutionsismoredeeplyentrenched;\nthus, as a result of an athletically successful year, it motivates\nan already larger generous populous to contribute, compared\nwith public institutions. This is also verified as the top 10\ninstitutions in percentage of alumni that give back are all pri-\nvate institutions (The Alumni Factor, 2012).\nFor the variable history of athletics success, although a\ndifference in means between the two groups existed, the\nstudy concluded no statistical difference between those insti-\ntutions with a history of athletics success (M = 12%) com-\npared with institutions without a history of athletics success\n(M = 14.3%). This suggests that all institutions regardless of\ntheir history of athletics success can benefit from a year of\nathletics success.\nTesting of the last research question to determine whether\na difference existed between DI institutions with basketball\nsuccess versus DI football success, the study found no statis-\ntical significant difference between the two. It was, however,\ninteresting to note that institutions with basketball success\nexhibited a larger mean (M = 16.1%) compared with institu-\ntions with football success (M = 11.9%).\nThe main result of this study, that DI institutions that\nexperience athletics success exhibit a significant difference\nin private contributions, is congruent with previous studies\nunique to this study was the definition of athletics success\nwas more narrowly defined, and the data source utilized was\nTable 10. Comparison of Football Athletically Successful DI Institutions Versus Basketball Athletically Successful DI Institution.\nGroup N M SD df t p\nNote. DI = Division I; BB = Basketball; FB = Football.\nthe VSE Survey, which were distinctive from the studies\nabove. Moreover, this study found significance utilizing this\ndata set where a previous study in 2007 by Humphreys and\nMondello using a similar database found no significance\nThese current findings may indicate a shift in the influ-\nence athletics success plays in private contributions to insti-\ntutions in the current environment. This study also differed\nfrom previous studies, in that it accounted for multiple years\nprior to and after the athletics success, for a more accurate\nreflection of how the athletics success had a significant\nfinancial impact on those institutions. Accounting for a\nchange over multiple years versus a single year after athletics\nsuccess provides additional validity to the study compared\nwith previous studies.\nThe results indicating private institutions benefit more\nthan public institutions may contradict the study by Howard\nand Stinson (2007), which found less prestigious academic\ninstitutions are influenced more by athletics success. Howard\nand Stinson defined prestigious institutions as Tier I by U.S.\nNews & World Report. During the time of this study by\nHoward and Stinson (2007), Tier I was defined as institu-\ntions that ranked in the top 50%, currently institutions are\nclassified as Tier I if they rank in the top 75% (U.S. News &\nWorld Report, 2012). Although the two studies' definitions\ndo not align, and a majority of the private institutions are\nclassified as Tier I, the findings are interesting to note and\nsurprising given the study's hypothesis. The difference in\nmeans over 2 years was marginally significant between the\nFurthermore, Humphreys and Mondello (2007), in their\nwas linked to an increase in restricted contributions at both\nprivate and public institutions; however, football success\nwas linked to an increase at only public institutions. In an\nearlier study, Humphreys and Mondello (2005) defined\nrestricted donations as those earmarked for athletics, sug-\ngesting that academic departments do not benefit from ath-\nletics success at public institutions, although similar to\nHoward and Stinson's (2008) findings, private institutions\ndid see an increase in academic giving.\nThis study found a relationship at both private and public\ninstitutions and giving overall, which may be evidence that\nthere may be a shift in the donor's perception nationwide\nregarding athletics and private contributions. One could\nhypothesize back to the culture and environment discussed\nin the \"Theoretical Framework\" section that relates to giv-\ning; stated that the mission, image, identity, and expectations\nof the institution affect perceptions and, therefore, emphasis\nplaced on athletics success and giving. Organizational image\nand identity theory relates to the identity and image portray\nby the university as a result of the athletics success (Dutton\nNext, the results comparing variables by region and his-\ntory of athletics success are unique, in and of themselves\nbecause these variables have either been lightly researched\nor never been studied previously in this context and defini-\ntion of athletics success. Particularly of interest, are the\nresults for the South region being significant when compared\nwith the baseline. This may represent an influential variable\non the data set as a whole.\nLastly, the findings on private contributions for basketball\nsuccess versus football success observed no statistical differ-\nence between the two. This was similar to the findings by\nHumphreys and Mondello (2007) that found restricted giv-\ning appeared to rise at both public and private universities in\nresponse to success of the basketball team, and at public\ninstitutions when the football team is invited to a bowl game.\nImplications for Operational Policy\nThere are 347 institutions that compete at the NCAADI level\nin basketball and 124 institutions that field an NCAA DI\n(FBS) football program (NCAA, 2013); for these schools,\nthe implications from these results are vast. The results from\nthis study help to quantify the return on investment in athlet-\nics programs in terms of overall private contributions to the\ninstitution. This also does not take into account other intan-\ngibles and possible indirect results from this athletics suc-\ncess, such as increased applications, enrollment, improved\nSAT/ACT scores of incoming freshman, enhanced national\nattention/marketing/exposure, royalties from sales of mer-\nchandise, community economic impact, television revenue,\nand possibly enhanced image of the institution.\nThese findings may help justify and encourage those\ninstitutions to invest in their athletics programs strategically\nto reap these financial benefits. Administrators should have a\nstrategic plan in place well before the success occurs to take\nfull advantage of the benefits, much like institutions have an\nemergency preparedness plan. By having a strategic plan,\nuniversities will be able to capitalize on the marketing, expo-\nsure, donations, and image to the fullest extent during and\nimmediately after athletics success. This thought relates to\ninstitutional theory in which institutions should understand\nexternal expectations and strategically align themselves with\nthe external environmental conditions, such as the impact\nathletics success may create for their university (DiMaggio\n& Powell, 1983). Each institution should prepare for as many\nextreme instances as possible, both positive and negative.\nThis is especially true in communities that place an enhanced\nemphasis on athletics success such as the southern region of\nthe United States as indicated in the results of this study.\nThis is especially true because the study found no statisti-\ncal difference between schools with a history of athletics\nsuccess compared with institutions without a history of ath-\nletics success. Excellent examples come from the recent and\nsurprising success of such teams including VCU, George\nMason, Butler, Boise State, and TCU. However, even insti-\ntutions with a long history of success may benefit from\nrecent athletics success. In April of 2013, after Michigan\nmade a deep run in the men's basketball NCAA Final Four,\nCharles Munger committed US$110 million to the University\nof Michigan, the largest gift to the institution (University of\nMichigan News Service, 2013). Furthermore, the gift was\nmade after he was an invited guest of the university to the\nFinal Four, and his gift was designated for the academic side\nof the institution to build a new graduate student hall. This\nrecent gift speaks to the power and influence athletics may\nhold in donor motivations, even to gifts toward academic\ninitiatives.\nRecommendations for Future Research\nAlthough this study provided substantial and unique results,\nnot to mention added to continuing research on this subject,\nseveral future studies should be conducted on topics related\nto athletics success and the financial impact on universities\nto expand on this relationship. To further this research, one\ncould examine in detail where the increase in contributions\nwas allotted within the institution. However, because most\nathletics departments are subsidized, even if all the increase\nwent specifically toward athletics, the institution itself would\nbenefit by providing less of a subsidy, thereby saving\nresources that could be allocated elsewhere based on priority\nand needs of the university.\nThe relationship between private and public affiliation in\nregard to athletics success should be researched further to\ndetermine if a strong relationship exists. The sample size of\n15 in this study for private institutions was rather small and a\nstronger relationship may be found with an expanded study\nof private institutions that experience athletics success.\nIn regard to region, there were no statistically significant\ndifferences between regions that experienced athletics suc-\ncess. However, the Southern region exhibited the largest\nmean among the groups and was the only region to exhibit\nsignificance on its own compared with the baseline. In the\nfuture, conducting a two-way ANOVA accounting for athlet-\nics success in basketball and football by region would be\nsuggested. There may be an influential pattern found by sport\nand region if further research is completed.\nThere are also several other direct and indirect financial\nimpacts of athletics success on institutions. Several recom-\nmendations for future studies may include analyzing televi-\nsion revenue and royalties universities receive and how they\nmay fluctuate based on athletics success. Also, the economic\nimpact of the athletics success may be examined in the com-\nmunity which the institution resides in, which associates\nwith systems theory, in that institutions have an interdepen-\ndent relationship with their external environment (Berrien,\ndonations relates to systems theory and how that success has\na direct and indirect impact across the entire institution in\nregard to financial and perception values.\nFinally, the ability to quantify the marketing, exposure, and\npossibly enhanced perception or rankings an institution gains\nfrom their athletics success would be of particular interest\nbecause these variables are often difficult to measure but can be\nvery valuable financially in the long term. Simply enhancing the\nalumni giving percentage can increase an institution's ranking\nin the U.S. News & World Report marginally, which accounts\nfor 5% of the rankings (U.S. News & World Report, 2012).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAddo, K.
