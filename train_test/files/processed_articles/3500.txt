    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this article, we explore mothers' responses to celebrity mom body (CMB) profiles in popular magazines. Drawing from\nobjectification theory, we frame CMB images as one component of the ubiquitous sexualization of girls' and women's bodies,\nand ask how these images influence mothers' views of their postpartum bodies. While a good deal of previous research\nexamines the media portrayal of pregnant and postpartum bodies, very few studies go on to ask how these images affect\nmothers' self-image and their relationships with men. During in-depth interviews, we showed our sample CMB images and\nfound that most mothers evaluated themselves negatively; however, we add that they evaluated themselves in different ways\ndepending on their social class and educational backgrounds. All mothers identified negative effects of CMB images on men,\nwhich diminished mothers' feelings of sexual attractiveness to male partners.\n",

Research documents how multiple media\nforms present celebrity mothers' bodies as ideal types--in\nprenatal, pregnant, and postpartum stages (Chambers, 2009;\nRepresentations of celebrity motherhood begin with tabloids\nspeculating over the celebrity \"baby bumps,\" followed by a\ndetailed progression of their pregnancies, and then critiques\nof their postpartum bodies.\nDouglas and Michaels (2004) suggest that everyday\nmothers have several reactions to these \"carefully packaged\nfantasies\" (p. 123): Some mothers fully subscribe to these\nimages, wanting celebrity bodies and lives for themselves;\nother mothers are quite critical, stressing that these images\nare airbrushed and have nothing to do with real mothers'\nlives. Douglas and Michaels suggest most mothers lie some-\nwhere in between--They are somewhat critical of these\nimages but also feel inadequate in comparison.\nHowever, like most research on celebrity mother profiles,\nDouglas and Michaels (2004) do not directly examine how\nthese images influence everyday women. Our research fills\nthis gap by exploring how noncelebrity mothers react to\nmedia featuring celebrity postpartum bodies.

Second, how do mothers interpret men's reac-\ntions to these images, and how do these interpretations influ-\nence mothers' feelings of sexual attractiveness? To the\nliterature reviewed below, our research also contributes a\ndiverse sample of women by race and class; in their own\nwords, these mothers interpret CMB images and discuss\ntheir own bodies in light of these images.\nLiterature Review\nThe Maternal Body in the Media\nA large body of scholarship explores representations of\nwomen's bodies in the media. Here we focus on media\nrepresentations of the maternal body in the United States,\nparticularly those using celebrities. Scholars suggest that\nthe obsession with celebrity motherhood began with Demi\nMoore's Vanity Fair cover in 1991, which became the\nbest-selling single issue in Vanity Fair's history\ncover challenged the historical norm of hiding a woman's\npregnant body, and instead objectified the pregnant female\nbody, providing the maternal image for public consump-\ntion and pleasure (Cunningham, 2002). Throughout the\nposing nude, and often draped in jewels, while pregnant\nthe past two decades, pregnancy photos became a lucra-\ntive strategy for selling magazines (Hopper & Aubrey,\nMany have argued that popular media--which increas-\ningly featured celebrity narratives over the 1990s and\n2000s--perpetuates unrealistic standards of beauty and\nalizes mothers' bodies (Douglas & Michaels, 2004; Oliver,\n2010). Media portrayals of pregnant women create a beauty\nideal in which every part of the body is small and contained,\nwith the exception of the pregnant belly (Bordo, 1993;\nFor example, Oliver (2010) analyzes the eroticization of\nthe pregnant body in popular culture. She argues that Demi\nMoore's body represented an entirely novel form of sexual-\nizing women's bodies: \"Their bodies and their desires are\nimagined for others, for men, for the viewing audience, and\nnot for themselves or as women themselves experience their\nChambers (2009) explores the flaunting of the \"ornamental\nbump\" in the media. Chambers's study, done in the United\nKingdom, examines the ways popular culture uses fertility to\nChambers (2009) concludes that \"celebrity pregnancy has\nbeen become part of a sexy to-be-looked at femininity\" (p.\n15), adding that certain pregnant women--lower-income\nwomen, women of color, and single women--are presented\nand discussed in a more negative light than upper-income,\nWhite, married mothers.\nDouglas and Michaels's (2004) in-depth media analysis\nof celebrity motherhood uncovers a pervasive \"new-\nmomism\" ideology that requires perfection in all mothering\npractices, including \"getting back\" their slim, toned bodies.\nThis ideology \"exemplify[ies] what motherhood has become\nin our intensified consumer culture: a competition. They\n[celebrity mothers] rekindle habits of mind pitting women\nagainst women that the women's movement sought to end,\nleaving the notion of sisterhood in the dust\" (p. 138). Douglas\nand Michaels conclude that the \"new-momism\" has created\nan environment of hypercompetition, guilt, and anxiety for\nwomen.\nA handful of studies explore how media covers postpar-\ntum weight loss. Dworkin and Wachs (2004) conduct a con-\ntent and textual analysis of Shape Fit Pregnancy magazine.\nOnce the celebrity pregnant body has been exposed on the\ncover or within the magazine, the next step is to monitor the\npostpartum body, otherwise known as \"getting your body\nphrase, \"letting the body go,\" has often been used to identify\nnew mothers who do not immediately return to their prepreg-\nfeature before and after photos of women working hard to\nreturn to their \"normal body.\" McRobbie (2006) agrees that\nthe favorite cover image of celebrity weeklies is the \"yummy\nmummy\" who is back to her pre-baby weight within weeks\nof giving birth. O'Donohoe (2008) claims that North\nAmerican consumption of the \"yummy mummy\" resembles\nthat in the United Kingdom. In sum, women are bombarded\nwith images of slenderness and containment immediately\nafter pregnancy, a time when \"women feel overwhelmingly\nIndeed, research has shown that after having children, the\nmajority of women's bodies do not return to their original\nform, and many women never regain their prepregnancy\nJohnson, Burrows, & Williamson, 2004). Many women\nexperience feelings of grief and disappointment in regard to\ntheir body after pregnancy (Jenkin & Tiggemann, 1997;\nthe relationship between prepregnancy body weight and\nbody image change in 76 women who were pregnant for the\nfirst time. Among normal-weight women, feelings of self-\nconsciousness were common, and many said these feelings\nwere caused by an increase in public scrutiny of their bodies.\nMoreover, Collett (2005) suggests that after their pregnancy,\nwomen often remind people or inform them they just had a\nbaby, so as not to confuse her changed body with one of lazi-\nness or \"letting go.\"\nA recent study by B. Fox and Neiterman (2015) found\nconsiderable variation in how Canadian mothers discussed\ntheir postpartum bodies. While many women associated\nbreastfeeding with powerful feelings toward their maternal\nWilliams et al. 3\nbodies, most mothers reported being unhappy with their\npostpartum appearance, particularly their weight gain.\nHowever, B. Fox and Neiterman stress that mothers'material\ncircumstances--the education, jobs, and resources they\nhad--mediated their views of their postpartum bodies; moth-\ners with more education and better jobs tended to feel better\nabout their bodies, in part because they felt they had more\ncontrol over their lives. (On the contrary, returning to paid\nwork did make many mothers more worried about their\nappearance.) Drawing from this study, we explore how moth-\ners' narratives about their postpartum bodies vary by social\nclass and educational attainment.\nWhile many content analyses have examined how media\nportrayals objectify women, limited research explores the\neffects of media on pregnant and postpartum women. One\nimportant exception is Hopper and Aubrey's (2013) analysis\nof celebrity gossip magazines and pregnant women's self-\nobjectification. Hopper and Aubrey separate 301 pregnant\nwomen into three groups: one viewed highly objectifying\nimages of celebrity pregnant women (showing their full bod-\nies in little clothing), one group saw much less objectifying\nimages of celebrity pregnant women (only headshots), and\nthe control group saw baby products. They found that in their\nfirst trimester, the pregnant women shown the less objectify-\ning pictures reported the most self-objectification (measured\nby how often women described features of their own bodies\nwhen describing themselves). They suggested,\nImages of thin, toned, and sculpted celebrity bodies are so\nprevalent in our culture and these bodies are so frequently\nobjectified by the media that it is likely just seeing their heads\ntriggered these women to visualize images of these celebrities'\nbodies that they had previously been exposed to. This\nvisualization, in turn, may have caused them to see themselves\nas objects to be evaluated by others because their pregnant\nbodies differed from their visualization of that thin ideal.\nAmong respondents in their third trimester, the most highly\nobjectifying images lead to more self-objectification as pre-\ndicted. The authors speculate that because women earlier in\ntheir pregnancy are often not immediately identified as preg-\nnant (but may have gained weight), they may self-objectify\nmore than women in the third trimester--who are typically\nrecognized as pregnant. Their study was the only research we\ncame across that explores the impact of pregnant celebrity\nmedia images on women's self-objectification. Our research\nbuilds on their analysis by using in-depth interviews to\nexplore mothers' nuanced and detailed reactions to CMB\nprofiles.\nObjectification Theory\nFredrickson and Roberts's (1997) objectification theory\nargues that women and girls experience sexual objectification\nby internalizing an observer's perspective of their own\nbodies. In our culture, the \"observer's perspective\" separates\nwomen's bodies, or body parts, from the rest of her person-\nhood and views women's bodies primarily as objects of male\ndetails how women internalize a male gaze that prioritizes\ntheir physical attractiveness, \"practices which train the female\nbody in docility and obedience to cultural demands\" (p. 27).\nThese practices reduce the importance of women's bodies\noutside of their sexual attractiveness to men. More recent\nscholarship affirms that in our culture, early socialization\npractices and unrealistic media images cause girls and women\nto \"self-objectify by treating themselves as an object to be\nlooked at and evaluated on the basis of appearance\"\n(Szymanski, Moffitt, & Carr, 2011, p. 8). Objectification the-\nory emphasizes the cumulative effect of the objectification of\nwomen's bodies over their life course, a process through\nwhich women internalize the conventional beauty ideals\ndescribed above (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997; Hopper &\nAubrey, 2013). Indeed, women who self-objectify or rou-\ntinely experience sexual objectification often feel shameful\nabout their bodies and engage in restrictive dieting (Noll &\nFredrickson, 1998), display disordered eating (Tiggemann &\nWilliams, 2012), and have positive attitudes toward plastic\nsurgery (Calogero, Pina, Park, & Rahemtulla, 2010).\nThe objectification of pregnant women's bodies is espe-\ncially problematic, because pregnancy, birth, and breastfeed-\ning can be among women's most profound bodily experiences\n(Rich, 1976). The objectification process thus ignores and\ndevalues the power of the female body. Objectifying preg-\nnant and postpartum women's bodies also shows the extent\nto which this process is ubiquitous in our society (Fredrickson\n& Roberts, 1997); women's weight is surveilled during preg-\nnancy--when women must gain weight to give birth to a\nhealthy baby, and during the postpartum period--when\nwomen need extra weight if nursing their babies. The objec-\ntification and surveillance of mothers' bodies devalues the\npower of the maternal body, mothers' work as caregivers,\nand mothers' many other contributions to society.\nApplied to this study on postpartum bodies, sexual objec-\ntification can be seen in magazine images where the pregnant\nbody is presented for the consumption of others, through a\ngazing and inspection of the body (Fredrickson & Roberts,\n1997). As this gaze is available for around the clock con-\nsumption in our media culture, women internalize the\nobserver's perspective and self-objectify, or view themselves\nas objects for male sexual desire (Fredrickson & Roberts,\n1997). Consequently, in this study, we pay particular atten-\ntion to how women evaluate their postpartum appearance\nwhen comparing themselves with CMB images and also\nwhen comparing themselves with the imagined standards of\ntheir male partners.\nWhile previous research has explored various objectifica-\ntion experiences within a woman's life cycle, such as puberty\n4 SAGE Open\nusing objectification theory has explored sexual objectifica-\ntion in the postpartum experience. Therefore, a main contri-\nbution of this research is to explore to how CMB profiles, as\none example of ubiquitous media narratives that normalize\nthinness and conventional standards of beauty, influence\nmothers' views of their postpartum bodies.\nIntersectionality\nContemporary gender scholarship emphasizes that women's\nlived experiences vary considerably by race/ethnicity, social\nRoberts, 1997). Our society has long targeted the bodies of\nwomen of color for unequal treatment. Patricia Hill Collins\n(2004) writes that from slavery onward, \"Black women\nwere objects to be seen, enjoyed, purchased, and used, pri-\nmarily by White men with money\" (p. 31). Because another\narticle from this study focuses on race in mothers' postpar-\ntum narratives, we do not focus on race in this article. A\nlarge body of sociological literature shows that social class\nand educational attainment influence women's everyday\nlived experiences of both motherhood and body image (Edin\nhere we explore differences in mothers' narratives across\nclass and education.\nOur main research questions include the following:\nResearch Question 1: In light of CMB narratives, how\ndo mothers evaluate their bodies vis-\u00e0-vis others--includ-\ning celebrities and others in their lives?\nResearch Question 2: How do mothers' narratives vary\nby women's social class and educational backgrounds?\nResearch Question 3: In light of CMB narratives, how do\nmothers interpret men's evaluations of their postpartum\nbodies, and how do these interpretations influence moth-\ners' body image and feelings of sexual attractiveness?\nMethod\ninterviews with noncelebrity women who had one or more\nchildren. Interviews took place in a moderate-sized metro-\npolitan area in the upper South of the United States. We\nrecruited respondents through personal contacts, and more\ncommonly with flyers and social media advertisements; in\nflyers, we described the project as an interview-based study\nof mothers' views of their postpartum bodies and media\nimages of celebrity motherhood. Some respondents were\nfound utilizing snowball sampling, through which respon-\ndents provided names of additional mothers who might par-\nticipate in the study. To ensure a diverse sample, only five\nwomen in the study were found through snowball sampling.\nThe interviews were conducted in public places chosen by\nrespondents or in respondents' homes.\nAfter each woman filled out a small set of demographic\nquestions, interviews were semistructured; the first author\nworked from an interview guide but gave women substantial\nleeway to discuss the issues most important to them. The first\nauthor began with general questions on media consumption\nand went on to ask how respondents felt the men in their\nlives viewed their bodies before and after pregnancy. Then,\nthe first author showed mothers media images of celebrity\nmotherhood, asking how these made respondents feel about\ntheir own bodies, and how respondents thought the men in\ntheir lives viewed these images. The media images came\nfrom People Magazine, Shape, Us Weekly, Elle, and other\npopular magazines. We choose these magazines because\nthey have high circulation rates (PSA Research, 2016), rou-\ntinely feature stories on celebrity mothers, and are featured\nin grocery store checkout lines and magazine stands through-\nout the country. All of our respondents were familiar with\nthese magazines. Celebrity mothers on the covers of these\nmagazines included Jessica Simpson, Beyonce, the\nKardashians, and Demi Moore (from the iconic 1990s cover).\nSome respondents focused on the cover of the magazines;\nothers flipped through the magazines to view more images.\nWhen viewing these images, respondents typically seemed\nmore engaged and comfortable; they often opened up and\ndiscussed more personal experiences and struggles with their\nown body image.\nInterviews lasted between 35 and 75 minutes, most about\n45 minutes. All interviews were digitally recorded and tran-\nscribed, and all respondents were given pseudonyms.\nAs seen in Table 1, these mothers came from different\nracial and socioeconomic backgrounds. We interviewed 23\nWhite women, seven African American women, one\nHispanic woman, two Asian women, and five racially mixed\nwomen Our sample is somewhat representative of the popu-\nlation of the metropolitan area in which interviews took\nplace, though our sample has more mixed race respondents:\nThe metropolitan area is 77% White, 22% African American,\nand less than 5% Hispanic, Asian American, or mixed race\nAfrican American, and 13% mixed race, with fewer than 5%\nAsian American or Hispanic respondents. Due to space limi-\ntations, this article explores how mothers' narratives vary by\nsocial class and education; another article focuses on differ-\nences in women's narratives by race/ethnicity--which were\nsubstantial.\nAll mothers self-reported they were heterosexual. We\nmeasured income by respondents' self-reports of family\nincome. Eleven mothers were lower-income and earned less\nupper-middle income and earned between US$45,001 and\nto 45, with the average age of 31. Respondents had between\none and four children.\nWilliams et al. 5\nOnce interviews were complete, we reread transcripts\nseveral times and then coded each interview according to\nthemes and patterns that emerged from all the interviews\n(Heese-Biber & Leavy, 2007). Once general themes were\nfound, we coded interviews again for more specific themes\nrelated to our research questions (Charmaz, 2006).\nFindings\nMothers' Consumption of CMB Profiles\nMothers in this sample consumed between 1 and 8 hours of\npopular media, but on average their daily media consump-\ntion was around 3.5 hours. Media consumption consisted of\nviewing popular magazines, TV, online news sources, and\nsmartphone apps. Out of these 38 women, 17 women openly\ndiscussed seeking out CMB narratives in the media; they\nsubscribed to popular magazines such as People, Us Weekly,\nCosmopolitan, or Shape. Most mothers were more reluctant\nto admit their consumption. When asked if they ever bought\nmagazines such as People, Us Weekly, Ok! Magazine, or\nShape, 21 of the mothers denied such purchases. Some\nclaimed they had no time to follow CMB narratives.\nHowever, later in the interview, each of these 21 women spe-\ncifically mentioned stories from magazines, named celebrity\nmothers, or described advice they took from particular CMB\nnarratives. Even though all of these mothers showed they\nhad some consumption of CMB profiles, these 21 women\nseemed to associate these profiles as a kind of \"guilty plea-\nsure\" entertainment and did not want to be viewed as women\nwho read these magazines.\nBy the end of the interviews, almost all mothers in the\nsample reported being a headline consumer of these maga-\nzines (even though most did not buy them). Many revealed\nthat they consumed more CMB narratives than they had real-\nized. For example, Paige explained that she did not buy into\nCMB media and had no time to follow their stories. However,\nby the end of the interview, she had mentioned 11 celebrity\nmothers and their pregnancy or postpartum weight loss sto-\nries; she said, with embarrassment, \"I know so much more\nthan I thought I did!\"\nSocial Class, CMB Profiles, and Mothers'\nEvaluations of Their Postpartum Bodies\nUpper-income mothers. Of the women interviewed, nine were\nhigh-income mothers. As seen in Table 1, all of these women\nwere White. Most of these women were married to influen-\ntial men in the community, many of them business leaders.\nHowever, two of these mothers had PhDs and were married\nto male PhDs. All nine women graduated from college. As\nseen in Table 1, these mothers were the least likely to report\nstruggling with postpartum weight loss.\nSeveral patterns emerged in the interviews of high-income\nmothers: Most believed they could achieve a fit body through\nhard work and overlooked the resources associated with their\nhigh incomes. In addition, most had some kind of plastic sur-\ngery, and most compared their bodies with women in their\nsocial circle rather than celebrities.\nAlthough many of these women complained about their\nbodies in interviews, all but two believed you could have\npostpartum success if you were fit before your pregnancy. In\nthis sense, these mothers were not highly critical of the\nTable 1.

All respondents were given pseudonyms.\n6 SAGE Open\nimages of celebrity postpartum bodies. For example, Angela,\na personal trainer, was very critical of other mothers who\nwere not physically fit after pregnancy:\nI do not think women should use pregnancy as a crutch, like oh,\nI had two children. No, you just don't work out or you don't\nwork hard enough. If you had a flat stomach before kids, you\ncan again. If you didn't before, then no, it is not going to\nhappen.\nAnother mother, Anne, similarly believed a mother's post-\npartum body had a lot to do with how fit she was before\npregnancy and with good genes. In contrast, Brooke, a more\ncritical mother, explained, \"I grew up in a single mother\nhousehold. I know what it means to work hard and put every-\none before yourself.\" For Brooke, postpartum success had a\nlot to do with her resources and social class. She was aware\nof the privilege that comes with a high-income lifestyle--\nnannies, personal trainers, and the ability to buy healthy\nfoods. In contrast, most of the high-income mothers did not\nseem aware of how their class privilege influenced their\npostpartum bodies.\nAll nine of the high-income mothers said they compared\nthemselves with women in their social circle in addition to\ncelebrity mothers. Several of these women displayed a sense\nof hypercompetitiveness among their friends. Miranda, the\nfirst higher-income mother I interviewed, brought this com-\npetitiveness to my attention:\nFor the social circle I am in, there is so much pressure to look\ngood . . . So I don't even have to pick up a magazine to compare\nmyself to--I can just compare myself to my friends and the\nwomen at my country club . . . What I am getting at is, I know\nthese magazines are altered . . . so that is not as intimidating as\nwhen the people you are hanging out with are totally changing\nthe way they look and flaunting it.\nMiranda experienced self-objectification not by evaluating\nherself in light of the CMB profiles but instead by measuring\nher body against those in her social circle.\nOne likely outcome of comparing their postpartum bodies\nwith others in their very high-income social circle was cos-\nmetic surgery: Seven of the nine high-income mothers had\nBotox or cosmetic surgery to alter their bodies. Mothers like\nCaroline, Allison, and Brooke were open about having plas-\ntic surgery, while Anne was embarrassed to admit having any\nwork done. Anne whispered, \"I had a tummy tuck. My friend\nused the same doctor and hers looked great, so I decided to\ndo it.\" When I asked why she whispered to me about her\ntummy tuck, she replied,\nI know . . . and I don't understand why women don't talk about\nthat more, you know? I mean even among my friends, plastic\nsurgery is a secret. Weight loss efforts are a secret. Everyone has\nthe better nanny or the better trainer . . . Sometimes it just makes\nme crazy.\nAnne suggests that while she compared her body with those\nof her friends, the methods they use to attain fit bodies are\nlargely secretive.\nOther mothers were more upfront about using plastic sur-\ngery. Brooke said,\nI worked my ass off to get in the shape I am. I also paid my\ndoctor a lot of money to keep me looking this way. It was my\nchoice, and I am very open about having plastic surgery and\nBotox. Most women are not. I see nothing wrong with keeping\nmyself in shape and looking young.\nAfter asking Brooke about particular CMB narratives, she\nreplied,\nLook, I know that these women are being airbrushed and getting\nwork done. Myself and my friends all get the same work done. .\n. I know that I don't have to look like this in order to make it in\nmy business, but in order to make it in my lifestyle and social\ncircle, yes, I have to look a certain way.\nBrooke's quotes suggest that high-income mothers may feel\nthe need to engage in plastic surgery and exercise to meet the\nhigh expectations for beauty within their social networks.\nOverall, the higher-income respondents felt immense\npressure to look their best and keep up with friends and pop-\nular celebrity trends. Not all higher-income women evaluate\ntheir bodies on the basis of celebrity mothers; most care\nmore about how they look compared with mothers in their\nsocial circle. Even if they were critical of the hypercompeti-\ntiveness among themselves and their friends, they still felt it\nnecessary. As suggested by objectification theory, these\nwomen have internalized patriarchal norms about the ideal\nfemale body--as Brooke says, \"I have to look a certain way.\"\nThe narratives of these high-income women suggest that\neconomic privilege may exacerbate the pressures of self-\nobjectification, as these women can afford to go to more\nextreme measures (such as plastic surgery) to attain the ide-\nalized, thin body after childbirth.\nMiddle-income mothers.The majority of the women inter-\nviewed were lower- to upper-middle-class mothers.Atotal of\nUS$99,999. Many of these mothers described consuming\nCMB narratives as a guilty pleasure, something moms could\nread with little effort or concentration. Of these 18 women,\n15 struggled with postpartum weight loss and had negative\nthoughts toward their bodies after pregnancy. The main\ntheme emerging from these narratives was ambivalence:\nMiddle-income mothers were both critical of and envious of\ncelebrity mothers who had time to work out and eat\nhealthfully.\nAll 18 middle-income women were educated and almost\nall were career-oriented; one was a stay-at-home mother.\nThey had college degrees; many had professional degrees as\nWilliams et al. 7\nwell. Their education, or their jobs, often led them to be more\ncritical of CMB narratives. Kate explained,\nI think they (CMB images) are very unrealistic for your average\nmom, especially if they have more than one child. You have a\nchild that only wants chicken nuggets. And you're running to\nthree different sporting events. I don't have anyone to cook for\nme.\nJoyce had similar feelings but also those of\njealousy and envy--wanting to be a part of that lifestyle. Seeing\nhow easy everything is for them. I can barely make it to the gym,\nbut I feel like all I see these women doing are working out or\nplaying on the beach. It was always in the back of mind that I\nneeded to lose the weight . . . But time was always a factor, or\nnot having any motivation after work.\nJoyce seems to buy into the CMB images, even while she\nrealizes her life is quite different from that of celebrities who\n\"play on the beach\" all the time.\nSamantha, a part-time professor and college admissions\ncounselor, also showed ambivalence toward CMB narratives.\nShe believed that because of her education, she knew they\nwere unrealistic and avoided comparing herself with them.\nShe said, \"These women cannot be that perfect. It also makes\nme wonder exactly what these women are doing. I think a lot\nof them probably do more cosmetically than we think they\ndo.\" She admitted that she was interested in what celebrity\nmothers do cosmetically, but because of her education, she did\nnot believe cosmetic surgery was something worth pursuing.\nOf these 18 women, three admitted to having plastic sur-\ngery. However, 11 middle-income mothers admitted wanting\nbreast augmentation or tummy tucks. Even those who said\nthey would not undergo plastic surgery expressed ambiva-\nlence. For example, Lauren quickly answered \"no,\" when\nasked if she has or would ever have plastic surgery, but later\nsaid,\nI really don't like the idea of it because we wouldn't have the\nmoney. But I often fantasize about what a tummy tuck would\nlook like. It is just a fantasy, to finally have a flat stomach.\nWhile Lauren did not want plastic surgery, she did fantasize\nabout the results of it. Her ambivalence when shown and\nasked about the CMB profiles was also clear:\nIt makes me feel bad. I wish I could be like well, whatever, I am\nnot a celebrity. But it is hard not to think . . . I still look somewhat\npregnant seven weeks after the birth of my son. Then I look at\nthese women in their bikinis holding their newborn babies, and\nwho doesn't want to be this hot mom? Yeah . . . they make you\nfeel so crappy. I don't think any of us are immune to it.\nLike other middle-income mothers, Lauren was critical of\nCMB profiles but still influenced by them.\nAs suggested by objectification theory, the internalization\nof conventional beauty norms is evident in these women's\nnarratives: Working mothers like Joyce and Lauren, who\nhave little time or energy for working out, still feel pressure\nto be physically attractive. Lauren asks, \"Who doesn't want\nto be this hot mom?\" The CMB profiles encourage these\nmothers to discount other important aspects of their lives,\nsuch as jobs or parenting skills, and instead focus on whether\nor not their bodies meet conventional (and for the vast major-\nity of mothers, unattainable) standards of beauty and thin-\nness. While several middle-class mothers were openly\ncritical of the narrow scope of CMB profiles, they had a hard\ntime resisting the conventional beauty standards located\ntherein.\nLow-income mothers.Eleven respondents were low-income\nmothers, earning less than US$20,000 a year. These women\nwere full-time students, working minimum wage jobs, or\nunemployed. All low-income mothers were single mothers\nand attributed their inability to regain their pre-baby bodies\nto a lack of economic resources.\nLow-income mothers were high consumers of CMB pro-\nfiles, some more interested in the pregnancies, others more\nfocused on postpartum narratives. Like other respondents,\ninitially these women expressed ambivalence toward CMB\nconsumption, but once rapport was established, they began\nto divulge high consumption. The majority of these women\nwere headline consumers, not willing to spend money on\npopular magazines. However, all of these women admitted to\nflipping through these magazines or following CMB narra-\ntives on television or online.\nTwo patterns emerged in lower-income mothers' narra-\ntives: First, like the middle-income mothers, they were\nsomewhat critical of the class privileges that undergird CMB\nimages, but at the same time, almost all lower-income\nrespondents said they wanted these kinds of bodies for\nthemselves.\nThese mothers described an inability to \"afford\" the per-\nfect bodies in the magazines. These women said that celebri-\nties like Kourtney Kardashian, Jessica Alba, and Jennifer\nLopez were able to obtain a beautifully shaped and toned\nbody quickly; for example, a young mother, Susan, said,\nThese celebrity moms put so much pressure on people like me!\nLook at Kourtney Kardashian, who has 2 kids now and dropped\nthe weight successfully in front of the public in a matter of\nweeks--it is almost like a slap in the face to normal women.\nLower-income mothers were very aware of the economic\nresources of celebrities. One mother, Ashley, said, \"If you\nhave money, this is what you look like. Without money, I do\nnot think women's bodies are capable of looking like this\nimmediately after pregnancy.\" Similarly, Leah claimed that\nshe did follow celebrity mother's dieting and fitness advice,\nbut said that they were more successful because, \"People\n8 SAGE Open\nlike me, I don't have the time or the money for a personal\ntrainer. I could diet, but that is hard also when you live a life\nfinancially struggling.\" Almost all of the low-income moth-\ners referred to themselves as \"women like me\" or \"people\nlike me,\" which showed a sense of class difference and\nawareness of the privileges women showcased in CMB\nnarratives.\nHowever, while critical of the class privilege of celebrity\nmothers, the low-income mothers in this sample also wanted\nthese economic privileges for themselves. For example,\nMelissa, an African American mother of two, said, \"these\ncelebrity women have the money, they have the means to\nachieve the look they want. These are all things I cannot do,\nand most women cannot do, because we do not have the\nsame life.\" She admitted that she and other women idolized\ncelebrity mothers.\nI know this is the body God blessed me with, but looking at\nthese [images], I just feel fat. I feel like I need to lose more\nweight. They look fantastic . . . and I know they probably had\npeople helping them look this way, so it is not totally realistic.\nShe later went on to tell me, \"I took advice from celebrity\nmoms and tried to work out more and just drink water. But\nthat didn't always work. I was stressed a lot and wanted\nchocolate.\" Melissa expressed a sense of powerlessness over\nher own body in regard to postpartum weight loss and CMB\nprofiles. Like Melissa, several other low-income mothers we\ninterviewed had internalized feelings of guilt, inadequacy,\nand inability to control their own bodies by comparing them-\nselves with socially constructed ideals of beauty and\nmotherhood.\nSome respondents attributed their inability to regain their\nbodies to a lack of willpower. Even 6 years after giving birth\nto her daughter, Paige admitted that she still continues to fol-\nlow CMB advice:\nI have always followed Britney Spears. She would list her daily\nfood regimen, like salmon, rice, and vegetables. That is not\nalways realistic for women like me. I am a single mother and\ncannot afford all of the fancy and healthy foods all the time.\nRather than to cook a healthy meal that costs 25 dollars with\nsalmon and grilled chicken, I can take that money and buy food\nthat will last all week. But it's not healthy, it is not what celebrity\nmothers are saying is right, or what mothers like me should be\ndoing.\nPaige indicated that a lack of economic resources prevents\nlow-income mothers from obtaining good food, exercise pro-\ngrams, and dietitians. Like Paige, several low-income women\nin this study seemed to internalize messages from media\nimages that ensure a continued otherness.\nLike the high-income mothers, almost all lower-income\nwomen admitted to wanting plastic surgery (if they had the\nmoney). For example, Erica said, \"I have thought about hav-\ning plastic surgery on my stomach. Maybe in time I will have\nthe money.\" Similarly, Candace said, \"If I had the money, I\nwould get a tummy tuck and breast-lift in a heartbeat!\"\nIn sum, the lower-income mothers were often critical of\nthe class privilege among celebrity mothers, but they also\nwanted these economic resources, and celebrity moms' bod-\nies, for themselves. As suggested by objectification theory,\nmothers buy into conventional beauty standards and feel\nquite badly about their own bodies and lives, even when they\nknow celebrity mothers have substantial resources unavail-\nable to them.\nThe Male Myth: Mothers' Views of Men's\nReactions to CMB Narratives\nIn every interview, respondents said they thought the men in\ntheir lives expected a quick return to their prepregnancy bod-\nies. All 38 mothers believed that the men in their lives sub-\nscribed to what we began to call the \"male myth\"--the\nassumption that women's bodies spontaneously go back to\ntheir prepregnancy shape following the birth of a child.\nEllen, a bench clerk in family court, described the atti-\ntudes many of the women held regarding men:\nI think a lot of men expect their wives to look a certain way\nduring and after pregnancy. I mean even Scott [Disick] tells\nKourtney Kardashian she needs to lose weight, or makes crappy\ncomments to her about weight gain . . . If it happens in celebrity\nlives, it happens 1000 times more in our lives.\nLauren, a mother of two, echoed this mentality when sharing\na story from her motherhood group:\nThey [the mothers in her group] all complain that they don't feel\nlike they are in their own body--things are moved around . . .\nThey all talk about how they don't feel sexy for their husbands\nanymore, and feel like their husbands do not want to have sex\nwith them. I do not know how to explain it, you just really don't\nfeel comfortable in your own skin for a while. Then you have\nthese men that want you to look like these famous women. It is\nhard to understand men, they say, \"no no no, I don't expect you\nto look like this,\" but you know they do . . . you know that's what\nthey desire.\nLauren then explained,\nMedia teaches us that to be a good mother and a good wife, you\nhave to look like you haven't had a child six weeks after giving\nbirth. Otherwise you have failed at mothering and you have\nfailed at being sexy for your partner.\nThis mother clearly believed that celebrity images can make\nwomen feel less sexually attractive to their partners.\nMany mothers admitted that their negative body image\nwas influenced by how their partner viewed their body.\nMelissa, a mother of two who struggled with her weight\nwhile caring for her ill parent, claimed,\nWilliams et al. 9\nMen think all women should look like these celebrity mothers. I\nthink some are okay with the baby weight, but most want you to\ndrop it immediately. The father of my children did. He didn't\nwant to be around me because I was so big. He told me I was so\nfat all the time. The doctor would explain to him I was retaining\nwater.\nAlthough she had a medical reason for her weight gain, she\nassociates his negative image of her body during preg-\nnancy with their relationship ending. Similarly, Erica\ndescribed her partner's negative reactions: \"Since I've\nbeen pregnant, he doesn't show me attention. This hap-\npened during my other pregnancies as well . . . but I keep\nputting up with it.\"\nSome mothers revealed partners' severely negative reac-\ntions to their postpartum bodies. Kate said,\n[He] put me down a lot when I was pregnant . . . every chance he\ngot. He called me a fat slob. He threw food away and told me I\ncouldn't eat certain things. I remember crying and asking for ice\ncream and he laughed and said I had already gained enough. . .\nIt took me six years to boost my confidence back up.\nKate admitted on several occasions that she believed his neg-\native attitude toward her pregnant body was directly related\nto CMB profiles; she said,\nSix years ago these images devastated me. These celebrities . . .\nyou see Britney and you're like, oh wow, she is gorgeous and not\nhuge . . . And then my boyfriend comes home after looking at\nthese like why are you so fat and they aren't? It puts off a persona\nthat you stay skinny while pregnant.\nLikewise, Kimberly, a mother of three, whose husband\nleft her for another woman during her last pregnancy,\nexplained that \"some men have complete aversions to preg-\nnancy and weight gain. My ex-husband did not like it. He\nwas like EW! I would do little belly dances to tease him and\nhe would be disgusted.\" Samantha explained her view of\nmen's aversion to pregnancy in more depth:\nI think men in general are freaked out by pregnant women.\nWomen's bodies have been so sexualized . . . I think when the\nbody changes, it just totally freaks them out. I think some men,\nonce a woman has a baby--they never see their partner outside\nof their maternal role again. The sex is never the same. I think it\nis hard for men to separate your role as a mother and your role\nas a woman. I think men are harder on women about their weight\nalso.\nLike Lauren above, Samantha emphasizes how the sexual-\nization of women's bodies can make postpartum women feel\nsexually unattractive to male partners.\nSome women claimed their husbands' criticisms were\nhealthy criticisms to keep them motivated. Miranda said,\n\"My husband would tell me to go work out, because he knew\nit would make me feel better about myself. But also, I mean\nhe probably wanted to see the benefits of it.\" In addition,\nJoyce explained that her fianc\u00e9\nwas supportive, and encouraged me to eat healthy. He made me\na meal plan that was helpful. He was nice. He would make\ncomments that I should start running or get my workout in. But\nthat didn't hurt my feelings or anything because he was worried\nabout me and wanted to encourage me.\nHowever, later in her interview, she admitted, \"I know when\nthings get back to normal we will make it official [long\npause] . . . I am working out a lot and getting back into shape.\nI know he will get excited for a wedding!\" While many of\nthese men may have wanted to support their partners in\nefforts to stay healthy and feel better about themselves,\nJoyce's comment implies that a slimmer body may be neces-\nsary for their relationship.\nIn contrast, some women claimed their husbands were\nhappy or even excited about the changes in their bodies dur-\ning pregnancy. Tiffany explained that her husband enjoyed\nseeing her body change during her pregnancy: \"He was\nalways supportive and would encourage me that I was beau-\ntiful.\" Lauren similarly shared that her husband \"doesn't pay\nmuch attention to magazines I don't think. I'm sure he com-\npares me sometimes to these women, he is only human. He\ntells me he thinks I am beautiful and doesn't expect anything,\nbut he is progressive.\" Ellen claimed her husband did not say\nanything to her during pregnancy: \"He made me feel good.\nLike I was pretty. I had a great pregnancy. But he did men-\ntion after the pregnancy that he would work out with me.\"\nThus, a few mothers suggested that men were comfortable\nand happy with their partners' pregnant and postpartum\nbodies.\nDespite these positive experiences with their partners, all\n38 women interviewed said that men in general assumed all\nwomen's bodies could resemble those of celebrities in CMB\nprofiles after pregnancy. Jennifer, a psychology professor,\nsaid,\nMost men are under the impression that after the baby, you just\ngo back to your normal weight. If these women did, you can too.\nEat healthy, work out, it is easy right? Most don't realize that\nmany of the changes with our bodies are permanent.\nWhile most mothers viewed male reactions to CMB nar-\nratives in a negative light, one woman, Sally, whose husband\ndied of a rare form of cancer while her daughter was very\nyoung, expressed an alternative:\nI have heard men say they think their wives are sexy during\npregnancy but once they have their baby it is like \"okay honey!\nTime to get back to normal! Time to get back to that sexy body\nI married!\" It's like buddy . . . I still am the sexy woman you\nmarried . . . I am just trying to raise our new baby. I am still me.\nI am still sexual. We can't change the stretch marks, or the new\nhips. For most people that doesn't go away. We aren't airbrushed.\nSally suggests that men should come around to the realiza-\ntion that the real women are not \"airbrushed\" and can still\nenjoy sex and their bodies.\nAs objectification theory suggests, when respondents\nimagined male reactions to CMB profiles, most viewed their\nown postpartum bodies as inferior and felt sexually unat-\ntractive. However, a few mothers, Sally in particular, openly\nreject the objectification of women and the male gaze in\nCMB profiles. But on the whole, these quotes show that most\nmothers feel their postpartum bodies are inadequate.\nConclusion\nThis research finds that everyday mothers typically compare\ntheir bodies negatively with those of celebrity mothers.\nAlmost all of the women, albeit to varying degrees, shared\nthe experience of feeling their bodies were inadequate in the\nface of CMB narratives. In addition, all 38 mothers thought\nmen believed a woman's experience of pregnancy and post-\npartum body should mimic those of celebrities.\nThe voices of the 38 women in this sample support objec-\ntification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997): The sexual-\nization and objectification of women's bodies is inescapable\nin our culture, even among women who have recently given\nbirth. The CMB images we showed to mothers reinforce\npatriarchal norms about conventional beauty, most notably\nthe ideal of thinness. Like women in other research, these\nmothers felt pressure to \"get their body back\" (Bordo, 1993;\n38 women interviewed seemed acutely aware of how these\nimages have been stylized and airbrushed, they still viewed\ntheir bodies negatively in light of CMB profiles.\nHowever, our research suggests that mothers evaluated\nthemselves in different ways depending on their social class\nbackground. Higher-income women framed motherhood in\nmore competitive terms than other mothers, as the former\nwere more concerned with living up to the perceived stan-\ndards of beauty within their social circles. Douglas and\nMichaels (2004) argue that mass media's representation of\nmotherhood has created an environment of hypercompeti-\ntion, guilt, and anxiety for women. Indeed, in this sample,\nmost high-income women admitted to having plastic surgery\nto keep up with other mothers they know. As Douglas and\nMichaels suggest, when women compete against each other,\nthey are unlikely to work together for social change.\nWhile the middle- and low-income mothers did not\nexpress motherhood in competitive terms, most still wanted\nthe toned bodies shown in the CMB narratives. The lack of\ncompetition in these mothers' accounts could be because\nthey saw CMB narratives as out of their reach. In contrast,\nthe higher-income mothers had the resources to attain the\nbodies presented in CMB profiles and may have felt more\naccountable to them.\nSome middle-income mothers said that their education\nmade them more critical of CMB profiles, and that their\nparenting and paid work made it impossible for them to look\nlike celebrity mothers. Low-income mothers were also criti-\ncal of the CMB profiles based on their own life experiences;\nsome had tried the diets touted by celebrities, but were unable\nto afford healthy food, or were unable to keep up with exer-\ncise regimens and diets without child care and personal train-\ners. However, unlike most middle-income respondents, most\nlow-income mothers openly wished for the resources of\ncelebrity mothers and felt a sense of personal failure when\ntheir bodies did not meet the (unrealistic) standards of CMB\nprofiles. Thus, our research suggests that college-educated,\nmiddle-income women were the most critical of the images,\nwith several saying they knew they should not pay attention\nto them. Nonetheless, as predicted by objectification theory,\nevery mother in this sample had to some degree internalized\nan ideal of thinness for women's bodies, even soon after\nchildbirth. As Lauren, one of the most critical, middle-\nincome mothers, concluded in her discussion of CMB\nimages, \"I don't think any of us are immune to it.\" This\npoints to the pervasive effects of early socialization and\nmedia forms in promoting conventional norms of thinness\nand beauty--even among women who feel they should\n\"know better.\"\nLikewise, despite differences across class and education,\nall women in this sample believed that CMB profiles had\nnegative effects on men, and most mothers believed that men\nin the lives evaluated their postpartum bodies unfavorably;\nmany mothers in this study believed that their postpartum\nbodies were not \"sexy\" to the men in their lives. Because we\ndid not interview the male partners of the mothers, we can\nonly go by mothers' interpretations of how men in their lives\napproached CMB profiles and viewed mothers' bodies.\nFurther research could explore men's views of CMB pro-\nfiles, and their expectations of postpartum bodies, in more\ndirect ways. More research on sexual objectification and\nmothers' use of plastic surgery is especially needed.\nLast, we would argue that this research, and other research\nin this vein, can serve as a form of consciousness-raising\namong mothers. Many of the women commented on a lack of\ndialogue among mothers concerning their expectations for\nand experiences of postpartum weight loss. In addition,\nhigher-income mothers felt pressure to stay fit because they\ncompared themselves with other women in their social cir-\ncle; some, like Angela, chastised women who did not lose\ntheir pregnancy weight, thus surveilling the bodies of other\nmothers. If women were more open and honest with each\nother about their feelings of guilt and inadequacy in the face\nof CMB narratives, this could lead to less competition among\nhigher-income mothers and more solidarity among lower-\nincome mothers. More open dialogue could also lead to\nfewer women following and purchasing media featuring\nunrealistic CMB profiles.\nStructural changes are also necessary. Women in this sam-\nple with higher levels of education were generally more criti-\ncal of CMB narratives; this suggests that higher education\ncan help women challenge these pervasive narratives. In\naddition, a few online sources, such as \"The Shape of a\nMother\" website, provide accurate portrayals of postpartum\nmothers--with stretch marks, ample bellies, and sagging\nbreasts. As suggested by Sally, more realistic portrayals\ncould help affirm and celebrate real women's postpartum\nbodies, those that \"are not airbrushed.\" More realistic images\nof postpartum bodies could help women feel better about\ntheir postpartum bodies and more sexually attractive to their\nmale partners.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBartky, S.
