The association of cigarette smoking with albu-\nminuria has been reported but not examined in a representative U.S.\npopulation. No study has evaluated the association between serum\ncotinine (a biological marker for tobacco exposure) and kidney\ndamage. Methods. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted\namong 15,719 adult participants of the third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey to assess the association between\nsmoking exposure and kidney damage. Smoking was assessed by\nself-reported lifetime cigarette use and serum cotinine. Kidney dam-\nage was assessed by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), with\nalbuminuria defined as ACR of 17 g/mg in males and 25 g/mg\nin females. Results. The analysis included 13,121 with normal\nalbumin (mean ACR 6.3 g/mg) and 2,414 with albuminuria (mean\nrespectively.

However, relatively fewer studies\nhave been devoted to kidney disease outcomes. While the\nassociation between cigarette smoking and end-stage renal\ndisease (ESRD) has been inconsistently observed in popula-\ntion studies,[2\u00ad4] several studies have reported that cigarette\nsmoking is related to urine albumin excretion[5\u00ad7] as well as\nelevated serum creatinine or decreased glomerular filtration\nrate (GFR).[8,9] A recent longitudinal cohort analysis using\nthe Framingham Heart Study by Fox et al.[10] examined pre-\ndictors for new onset kidney disease defined by an esti-\nmated GFR at or below the sex-specific 5th percentile over a\nmean of 18.5 years of follow-up. Authors found that partici-\npants who smoked in the year prior to examination were\n42% more likely to develop new onset kidney disease than\nthose who did not smoke.\nThe primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the\ncross-sectional association between lifetime smoking dura-\ntion and dose with albuminuria in the adult population exam-\nined in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III). Serum cotinine is one of the primary\nmetabolites in nicotine and is a widely accepted biological\nmeasure of not only cigarette smoking but also exposure to\nenvironmental tobacco smoke (such as passive smoking). To\nour knowledge, this study is the first to examine both self-\nreported cigarette smoking and serum cotinine in relation to\nkidney disease. Information collected as part of NHANES\nIII provided the opportunity to address this association in a\nprobability sample representative of the U.S. population.\nStudy Participants\nThe NHANES III was designed to assess the health\nand nutritional status of persons aged 2 months and older\nNHANES III study participants and methods have been\npreviously published.[12] Briefly, the study used a strati-\nfied, multistage cluster sampling design to obtain a repre-\nsentative sample of the U.S. non-institutionalized, civilian\npopulation. Over-sampling of the very young, elderly,\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans was done in\norder to improve the precision of estimates in these sub-\ngroups. Of the 19,618 NHANES III participants older than\ninformation on albuminuria and 184 were excluded due to\nmissing information on other covariates. In addition, 264\npregnant women, 159 persons with overt renal insuffi-\nciency (serum creatinine  1.8 mg/dL [> 159 mol/L] in\nof race other than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, or Mexican-American were excluded, leaving\nMeasurement of Albuminuria and Kidney Damage\nThe physical exam included the collection of a ran-\ndom urine specimen and measurement of serum creati-\nnine. Urine was evaluated for albumin and creatinine by\nsolid-phase fluorescent immunoassay with external quality\ncontrol provided by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.[13] The ratio of urine albumin (g/mL) to urine\ncreatinine (mg/dL) (ACR) concentration was used to esti-\nmate total daily albumin excretion. Albuminuria was\ndefined as a urinary ACR of 17 g/mg or higher in males\nand 25 g/mg or higher in females. Macroalbuminuria was\ndefined as urinary ACR greater than or equal to 250 g/mg\nin males and greater than or equal to 355 g/mg in\nfemales.[14] Serum creatinine was analyzed using the mod-\nified Jaffe reaction.[13] To evaluate kidney function, esti-\nmated GFR was calculated using the abbreviated\nModification in Diet and Renal Disease (MDRD) Study\nformula based on serum creatinine, age, gender, and\nrace.[15,16] The serum creatinine values from NHANES III\nwere calibrated to the values obtained at the laboratory in\nwhich the glomerular filtration rate equation was\nderived.[17] Categories of kidney function were defined\nand greater than or equal to 90, to represent moderate to\nsevere, mildly decreased, and normal kidney function,\nMeasurement of Smoking\nThe amount of cigarettes smoked, years of smoking,\nand duration of smoking cessation were recorded as part of\nthe NHANES III questionnaire.[12] Lifetime smoking was\n  135\nestimated in pack-years, defined as the number of years a\nfull pack of cigarettes (20 cigarettes) was smoked per day.\nSmoking status was categorized as current (smoking > 1\ncumulative pack years up until 12 months prior to exami-\nnation), former (quit smoking and sustained cessation for\nat least 12 continuous months prior to examination), or\nnon-smokers (never smoked or smoked  1 cumulative\npack-year). Serum cotinine level was measured using\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography atmospheric-\npressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry.\nPersons with elevated serum cotinine, defined as greater\nthan or equal to 10 ng/mL, were considered exposed to\nenvironmental tobacco smoke.\nMeasurement and Definition of Covariates\nSeated blood pressure was measured three times\nduring the home interview using a mercury sphygmoma-\nnometer.[12] Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were\nestimated as the average of all available blood pressure\nreadings. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic\nblood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg, dias-\ntolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg,\never having been diagnosed as having high blood pressure\nby a physician on two or more occasions, or by reported\nuse of antihypertensive agents during the month prior to\ntheir study visit. Diabetes was defined as those who had\never been told by a physician that they had diabetes or\nsugar diabetes (excluding those only told they were dia-\nbetic during pregnancy).\nStatistical Methods\nThe mean or proportion of each characteristic was\ncalculated by albuminuria status. Tests of differences by\nalbuminuria status were done using chi-square tests for\ncategorical measures and t-tests or analysis of variance for\ncontinuous variables. Logistic regression models were\nused to estimate age, race, and gender-adjusted as well as\nmultivariable adjusted odds ratios of albuminuria com-\npared to normal albumin excretion associated with ciga-\nrette smoking. Generalized logit regression models were\nused to evaluate the multivariable association of smoking\nwith estimated GFR at specific, pre-defined cut-points of\nGFR.[18] Multivariable models were adjusted for variables\nknown to be associated with kidney outcomes including\nage, gender, race, education, body mass index, diabetes,\nblood pressure, use of anti-hypertension medication, HDL\ncholesterol, and alcohol intake.\nMultiplicative interaction terms of current and former\nsmoking and serum cotinine with gender, race, education\nlevel, diabetic status, and hypertensive status were evalu-\nated using logistic regression models. Interaction terms\nwith p values less than 0.10 were considered important\nstratification measures. A significant interaction was evi-\ndent between former smoking and hypertension (p =\n0.039); therefore, all models were stratified by hyperten-\nsive status. All other interaction terms with current and\nformer smoking as well as cotinine were non-significant,\nwith p values greater than 0.10.\nThe statistical package SUDAAN (release 8.0.1)[19]\nwas used to account for weights and adjustments for\nmulti-stage sampling, sample selection probabilities, non-\nresponse, and undercounts of the U.S. population esti-\nmates by gender, race, and age.\nRESULTS\nA total of 15,535 adults were included in our analysis.\nNormal albumin was observed in 13,121 participants\n(mean ACR 6.3 g/mg). Albuminuria was detected among\n28% of hypertensives and 8.5% of non-hypertensives. As\nexpected, there were differences in demographic and clini-\ncal measures by albuminuria status (see Table 1). Among\nnon-hypertensive participants, those with albuminuria\nwere more likely to be older, female, less educated, and\ndiabetic compared to participants with normal albumin-\nuria. In this same group, systolic blood pressure was\nhigher while serum creatinine estimated GFR were similar\nin subjects with albuminuria compared to subjects with\nnormal albuminuria (see Table 1). Among hypertensive\nparticipants, those with albuminuria were more likely to\nbe older, non-Hispanic black, diabetic, and be in the low-\nwithout albuminuria. Also, mean serum creatinine was\nhigher and estimated GFR lower among hypertensives\nwith albuminuria compared to those with normal albumin.\nThe comparison of other characteristics among hyperten-\nsives between persons with albuminuria and normal albu-\nmin were similar to what was observed in non-\nhypertensives.\nTable 2 shows self-reported smoking characteristics\nand levels of serum cotinine adjusted for age, sex, race,\neducation, and diabetes. Among all participants as well as\nby hypertensive status, those with albuminuria were more\nlikely to be current smokers and have smoked for a greater\nnumber of years and pack-years compared to those with\nnormal albumin (among current and former smokers).\nNon-hypertensive former smokers with albuminuria were\nmore likely to have smoked for greater than or equal to 60\npack-years and less likely to have smoked less than 20\npack years.\nThe odds ratios of albuminuria associated with smoking\nstatus, pack-years of smoking, and level of serum cotinine\nare shown by hypertension status in Table 3. Among hyper-\ntensives, the risk of current smoking was associated with a\nmultivariable adjusted models. Among hypertensive current\nand former smokers, cotinine in the lower and upper 50th\npercentile above elevated cotinine (10 ng/mL) demon-\n2.27) excess risk of albuminuria, respectively, compared\nto those with levels less than 10 ng/mL. No similar associ-\nations were observed among non-hypertensives.\nTo explore if there were a specific level of cigarette\nsmoking where an association with albuminuria was evi-\ndent among current and former smokers by hypertension\nstatus, pack-years were categorized into 20 pack-year\nshown in Figure 1, among hypertensives, there were\ngreater associations between albuminuria and current\nsmokers who smoked greater than 40 pack-years but no\nCharacteristics of NHANES III participants by level of albuminuria* and hypertension status\nAll Non-hypertensive Hypertensive\nNormal albumin\nAlbuminuria\nNormal albumin\nAlbuminuria\nNormal albumin\nAlbuminuria\nRace/ethnicity, %\n High school\neducation\nBMI, mean (SE),\nantihypertensive\ndrugs, %\nSystolic BP, mean\n(SE) mmHg\nDiastolic BP, mean\n(SE) mmHg\nUrine ACR, mean\n(SE) g/mg\nGFR, mean (SE)\nEstimated kidney function, %\nAbbreviations: SE = standard error; ACR = albumin to creatinine ratio; SCr = serum creatinine (note: to convert mg/dL to mol/L,\nmultiply by 88.4); BMI = body mass index; GFR = glomerular filtration rate; BP = blood pressure; CKD = chronic kidney disease.\n*Albuminuria = urine ACR  17 g/mg (males) and  25 g/mg (females).\n**Diabetes = previous diagnosis as told at least twice by a physician or fasting glucose  126 mg/dL.\nStatistically significant difference of estimates between albuminuria and normal albumin in the non-hypertensive and hypertensive\n  137\nassociations among former smokers.

Among non-hypertensives,\nthere were greater associations between albuminuria and\ncurrent and former smoking for greater than 40 pack-\nyears, although only the association with 60 or more pack-\nyears among former smokers was statistically significant.\nIn former non-hypertensive smokers, a dose response rela-\ntionship emerged between pack years of smoking and\nalbuminuria.\nThe duration of smoking cessation was explored among\nformer smokers to see if longer duration of smoking cessation\nattenuated the association of pack-years and albuminuria (15\nyears was used as the cut point for smoking cessation because\nit represents the median number years of cessation reported\nby former smokers; see Table 3).

The association\nbetween current self-reported smoking and albuminuria\nwas validated by serum cotinine, which was associated\nwith an increased risk of albuminuria in hypertensives. A\nrelationship between 40 or more pack-years of smoking\nwith albuminuria was observed in current hypertensive\nsmokers. Among non-hypertensives, a relationship was\nobserved between 60 or more pack-years and albuminuria.\nEven more striking was the observed association between\nhigh levels of serum cotinine and albuminuria among\nthose who never smoked. This study provides strong,\ndetailed, and consistent support for the association\nbetween smoking exposure and early kidney damage\namong persons with hypertension in the general U.S.\npopulation.\nThe findings from the current study are consistent\nwith several other cross-sectional studies that have evalu-\nated the association between smoking and kidney dam-\nbetween increased smoking and several markers of kidney\nimpairment, including decreased kidney plasma flow,[9]\nelevated serum creatinine,[8] decreased and/or elevated\nglomerular filtration rate,[7,9] and the presence of pro-\nalso consistently found an association between smoking\nand diabetic kidney disease.[22] However, irrespective of\ndiabetic status, persistent albuminuria is almost always\ndue to intrinsic kidney disease [23] and is associated with\nhigher risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[24]\nThe extent to which microalbuminuria mediates some of\nthe increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to smok-\ning needs further study.\nMultivariable adjusted* odds ratios (and 95% confidence\nintervals) of albuminuria associated with measures cigarette\nsmoking exposures by hypertensive status\nAlbuminuria\nNon-hypertensive Hypertensive\nNever smoked\n(reference)\nAll smokers (current and former)\n(reference)\nelevated cotinine)\nng/mL (upper\ncotinine)\nFormer smokers**\nNever smoked\n(reference)\nNon-current smokers\nQuartile of serum cotinine:\nng/mL (reference)\nng/mL\nng/mL\n*Adjusted for gender, race, age, education, body mass\nindex, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive\nmedication, alcohol intake in last 12 months, and HDL\ncholesterol.\n**Former smoking was defined as quitting 12 consecutive\nmonths prior to the interview and the reference group was never\nsmokers (defined as <1 pack-year).\nNon-smokers were defined as either former or never\nsmokers.\nElevated serum cotinine >10 ng/mL.\n  139\nMultivariable estimates of relative risks for current\nsmoking were similar across general population studies\nwith statistically significant increased risk estimates rang-\nevaluated a dose-response effect found increased risks\namong those who smoked greater than 20 cigarettes per\nday as compared to those who smoked 20 or less per\nday.[7] This was also the only other study to distinguish the\nrisk of microalbuminuria among former smokers with an\nage- and sex-adjusted increased odds ratio of 1.27 (95%\ninformation was provided across pack-years of smoking\nfor former smokers or a biological marker of smoking\nexposure, such as cotinine.\nMany epidemiologic studies have pointed to an effect\nof passive smoking on coronary heart disease (CHD).[25\u00ad30]\nIn a meta-analysis of CHD risk from passive smoking,[25]\nthere was a 25% overall increased risk of CHD in non-\nsmokers exposed to passive smoke compared to non-\nsmokers not exposed to passive smoke. No study to our\nknowledge has examined the effect of passive smoke on\nkidney disease. By examining levels of serum cotinine\namong non-current smokers, it was found that among\nhypertensives, relatively high levels of exposure to passive\nsmoke resulted in a 41% increased prevalence of albumin-\nuria. Although those with high cotinine values (>71 ng/mL)\ncould represent the inclusion of some current smokers who\nclassified themselves as never or former smokers, the bias\nfrom misclassification due to self-reported smoking status\nis usually considered insignificant.[31,32]\nAlthough there was an increased risk of chronic kid-\nney disease among both current and former smokers, only\nthe impact of former smoking was statistically significant.\nBias from differential survival among both current smok-\ners and hypertensives may influence cross-sectional stud-\nies of these factors and chronic kidney disease. The ratio\nof smoker to non-smoker mortality peaks at age 45 in\ndeveloped countries.[33] Differential death from cardiovas-\ncular causes including hypertension is also well known.\nFurthermore, chronic kidney disease is most often observed\nFigure 1. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for albuminuria by pack-years of cigarette smoking and hypertension\nstatus compared to non-smokers. Odds ratios for all current and former smokers were estimated using non-smokers as the reference\ngroup (odds ratio = 1.0), as represented by the dashed (---) line.

Therefore, the influence of current\nsmoking on chronic kidney disease requires further evalua-\ntion in longitudinal and not cross-sectional studies.[10]\nSeveral potential mechanisms for the role of smoking\nin the development of albuminuria have been hypothe-\nsized. The effects of smoking on the kidney are likely to\nbe mediated through a combination of effects, including\nalterations in kidney hemodynamics and blood pressure\nand damage to the microvasculature within the kidney.\nEvidence suggests a similarity between atherosclerotic\nlesions and glomerulosclerosis.[34\u00ad38] It has been hypothe-\nsized that the atherogenic effects of cigarette smoking\nextend to the microvasculature of the kidney, affecting\nboth renal tubular and glomerular structures.[39,40] Autopsy\nstudies have supported this theory and have shown an\nassociation between a history of smoking and thickening\nBlood cadmium concentrations in smokers are about\nfour times higher than in nonsmokers,[45] and cadmium\nhas also been implicated in the development of kidney dis-\nease. Cadmium is an environmental pollutant with nephro-\ntoxic properties that are absorbed into the body by, among\nother sources, cigarette smoking, and has a slow excretion\nrate due to renal reabsorption.[46] The effects of cadmium\nnephrotoxicity may include proteinuria, calciuria, glyco-\nsuria, and tubular necrosis. Also, because of an extensive\nhalf-life (30 years), chronic low level exposures to cad-\nmium are also detrimental and may be associated with\nend-stage renal disease, early onset diabetic kidney dis-\nease, and abnormal blood pressure regulation.[45]\nOur analysis showed that the association between\nsmoking and albuminuria was mediated by hypertension,\nwhich may indicate that smoking promotes the progression\nof kidney disease among hypertensives. It is possible that\nthe vascular injury already present among hypertensive\nindividuals potentiates the physiological damage of smok-\ning on the kidney microvasculature, resulting in albumin-\nuria or the initiation of kidney damage. Once this damage\nhas occurred, the development of chronic kidney disease\ndue to continued exposure to smoking or a myriad of other\npromoting factors is likely to progress.\nOur study had several important strengths. First,\nbecause of the NHANES III sampling methods and weights,\nour results can be generalized to U.S. adults. Second, the\nlarge sample size included in our analyses allowed us to\ndetect any small but important associations between smok-\ning and kidney disease. Even small associations with a com-\nmon exposure such as smoking can contribute to substantial\nabsolute numbers of persons affected. Third, using available\ndata, we analyzed dose and duration of both self-reported\ncurrent and former smoking as well as cotinine, a biological\nmarker of smoking exposure for smokers and non-smokers.\nDespite its strengths, several limitations of the current\nstudy warrant mention. As with any cross-sectional study\ndesign, inferences are limited in terms of establishing a\ncausal role of smoking in the development of albuminuria,\nand large, prospective studies are needed. Also, the use of\na single random urine sample for evaluation of albumin-\nuria is not ideal. Although albuminuria is almost always\ndue to intrinsic kidney disease, false positive evaluations\ncan occur due to heavy exercise, fever, and extreme emo-\ntional stress,[23] but these conditions are likely to be rare.\nFortunately, false negative evaluations are also rare; there-\nfore, cases are unlikely to be defined as non-cases in the\ncurrent study, and any bias resulting from misclassifica-\ntion will likely underestimate the association of smoking\nand albuminuria. It is also important to note that diabetes\nas diagnosed by fasting glucose (  126 mg/dL) was\ndetermined in only approximately half of the NHANES III\nparticipants. There was no evidence of different associa-\ntions between smoking and albuminuria by diabetic status\nin the current study.\nIn summary, this study provides evidence that ciga-\nrette smoking is associated with the presence of albumin-\nuria among hypertensive adults in the general U.S.\npopulation. Associations with albuminuria among current\nsmokers are higher than among former smokers, but the\nassociation is still evident among former smokers with a\nhigh pack-year history of smoking. Ultimately, the contin-\nued emphasis on smoking prevention and cessation may\nprove to have an impact on the incidence of albuminuria in\nthe general population and subsequently contribute to the\nreduction of morbidities associated with albuminuria.\n"
