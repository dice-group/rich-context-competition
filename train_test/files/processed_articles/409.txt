Murray, MD, DPhil\nBackground--Blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality and has lifestyle and\nhealthcare determinants that vary across states. Only self-reported hypertension status is measured at the state level in\nthe United States. Our aim was to estimate levels and trends in state-level mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), the\nprevalence of uncontrolled systolic hypertension, and cardiovascular mortality attributable to all levels of higher-than-\noptimal SBP.\nMethods and Results--We estimated the relationship between actual SBP/uncontrolled hypertension and self-reported\nhypertension, use of blood pressure medication, and a set of health system and sociodemographic variables in the\nnationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We applied this relationship to identical\nvariables from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate state-specific mean SBP and uncontrolled\nhypertension. We used the comparative risk assessment methods to estimate cardiovascular mortality attributable to\nhigher-than-optimal SBP. In 2001\u00ad2003, age-standardized uncontrolled hypertension prevalence was highest in the\nDistrict of Columbia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina (18% to 21% for men and\n24% to 26% for women) and lowest in Vermont, Minnesota, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Colorado (15%\nto 16% for men and 21% for women). Women had a higher prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension than men in every\nstate by 4 (Arizona) to 7 (Kansas) percentage points. In the 1990s, uncontrolled hypertension in women increased the\nmost in Idaho and Oregon (by 6 percentage points) and the least in the District of Columbia and Mississippi (by 3\npercentage points). For men, the worst-performing states were New Mexico and Louisiana (decrease of 0.6 and 1.3\npercentage points), and the best-performing states were Vermont and Indiana (decrease of 4 and 3 percentage points).\nConclusions--Lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for lowering blood pressure are particularly needed in the South\nand Appalachia, and with emphasis on control among women. Self-reported data on hypertension diagnosis from the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System can be used to obtain unbiased state-level estimates of blood pressure and\nuncontrolled hypertension as benchmarks for priority setting and for designing and evaluating intervention programs.\nKey Words: blood pressure  cardiovascular diseases  hypertension  models, statistical  mortality\n risk factors  United States\nHigh blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardio-\nvascular disease and mortality, accounting for an estimated\n14% of cardiovascular deaths worldwide and 18% in high-\nincome countries.1 Although in some clinical applications spe-\ncific thresholds are used to define hypertension (eg, 140 mm Hg\nfor systolic blood pressure [SBP]),2 epidemiological studies\nhave established that cardiovascular disease and mortality risks\nincrease continuously with blood pressure from levels well\nbelow the conventional thresholds used in the definition of\nhypertension.3,4 Therefore, in addition to hypertension diagnosis\nFrom the Harvard School of Public Health, Boston (M.E., G.D., C.J.L.M.), and Initiative for Global Health, Harvard University, Cambridge (M.E.,\nS.O., G.D., C.J.L.M.), Mass, and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington (C.J.L.M.), Seattle.\nGuest Editor for this article was Daniel W. Jones, MD.\nThe contents of this article are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention or the Association of Schools of Public Health.\nThe online-only Data Supplement, consisting of tables and figures, can be found with this article at http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/\nmajid_ezzati@harvard.edu\nHypertension\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nand control, shifting the whole distribution of blood pressure is\nimportant for reducing cardiovascular disease mortality. In the\nUnited States, age-standardized mean blood pressure declined\nmeasured in the first 3 rounds of the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), possibly as a result\nof a combination of lifestyle and pharmacological interven-\ntions.5,6 Since the early 1990s, however, these declines appear to\nhave stagnated or reversed, possibly because of the rise in risk\nfactors associated with blood pressure (eg, overweight and\nobesity) and the fact that hypertension remains underdiagnosed\nand only partially controlled.7\u00ad9\nState-specific data on levels and trends of blood pressure\nand hypertension are essential inputs for priority setting; for\nthe design, delivery, and evaluation of interventions; and for\nunderstanding disparities in hypertension levels, diagnosis,\nand treatment.10\u00ad13 In the United States, NHANES III pro-\nvided information on blood pressure in broad regions of the\ncountry,14\u00ad16 but estimates in NHANES III were based on data\nlevel, only self-reported hypertension status is measured in the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).17\u00ad20\nBRFSS estimates cannot be directly used to assess cardiovascu-\nlar risk and to evaluate interventions for a number of reasons (see\nalso earlier assessments of BRFSS).21\u00ad23 First, some people may\nbe unaware of their hypertension status because they have not\nhad contact with a health professional or have not been diag-\nnosed during such a contact. Second, some people who were\ndiagnosed with hypertension may have effectively controlled\nand lowered their actual blood pressure through lifestyle and/or\npharmacological interventions. Because the risk of cardiovascu-\nlar diseases is determined by actual blood pressure and not by\nwhether this level is maintained through interventions,24 such\npeople are no longer a part of the \"high\u00adcardiovascular-risk\"\ngroup. Finally, self-reported questions allow analysis of only the\nhigh-risk (hypertension) status, not the underlying continuous\nexposure.\nWe used 2 national health and health examination surveys,\nNHANES and BRFSS, to characterize the relationship be-\ntween actual SBP and self-reported hypertension status, use\nof blood pressure medication, and a set of health system and\nsociodemographic variables. We then used this relationship to\nestimate for the first time mean SBP and uncontrolled\nhypertension prevalence at the state level by sex and age\nthen calculated cardiovascular mortality attributable to all\nlevels of higher-than-optimal SBP at the state level.\nMethods\nData Sources\nNHANES, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, is part of a cross-sectional survey series conducted in the\nUnited States since 1959. This nationally representative survey uses\na complex, multistage, stratified, clustered probability sample design\nto determine health and nutrition characteristics of the civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized population 2 months of age. NHANES in-\ncludes an in-person interview and a subsequent physical examination\nand measurement component in a mobile examination clinic (MEC);\nthose unable to visit the MEC are offered a limited examination at\n1999, NHANES became a continuous survey with data released in\nThe response rate for the household interview was 86%, 82%, and\n2002, respectively. The corresponding response rates for the medical\nexamination after completing the household interview were 92%,\n93%, and 95% (The overall response rate for medical examination is\ntherefore the product of the 2 separate response rates). Additional\ninformation on survey design and methods, including blood pressure\nmeasurement, is available elsewhere25,26 and online\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).\nBRFSS, overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, is an annual cross-sectional telephone survey that started in\n1984. Currently, the survey is conducted by health departments in all\n50 states and the District of Columbia using a random-digit dialing\nmethod to obtain a state-representative sample of the civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized population 18 years of age. The state samples\ncan be combined to form a nationally representative sample. In 2002,\nthe response rate among calls that were answered ranged from 62%\nto 99% by state, with a median rate of 77%. Additional information\non the full survey design is available elsewhere20,27 and online\n(http://www.cdc.gov/brfss).\nWe included adults 30 years of age in NHANES and BRFSS\nwho answered this self-reported hypertension question: Have you\never been told by a health professional that you have high blood\npressure?\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used measured and self-reported data from NHANES, which are\nrepresentative at the national but not state level, to characterize the\nrelationship between measured SBP and self-reported hypertension\nstatus, blood pressure medication, and a set of health system and\nsociodemographic variables listed in Table 1. This relationship was\nestimated in a series of linear regressions in which the dependent\nvariable was the individual's SBP measurements and the indepen-\ndent variables were the health system and sociodemographic covari-\nates (Figure 1). We conducted the analysis based on SBP because it\nhas been found to be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than\ndiastolic blood pressure.2\u00ad4\nWe estimated the regression model separately for 6 subgroups of\nthe NHANES data. Men and women were divided into 3 groups\neach. Group A comprised those who answered no to the question,\n\"Have you ever been told by a health professional that you have high\nblood pressure?\" Group B included those who answered yes to that\nquestion and no to \"Are you currently taking medicine for your high\nblood pressure?\" Group C included those who answered yes to both\nquestions. We used these divisions because the effects of health\nsystem and sociodemographic factors (eg, age or insurance status) on\nblood pressure may vary across these groups, as confirmed by our\nregression coefficients.\nWe used a random-effects linear regression model to estimate SBP.28\nWhen 1 measurement of the dependent variable (ie, SBP) is available\nfor each subject, the random-effects model can be used to separate the\nregression error term (ie, unexplained variation) into stochastic (within-\nperson) and systematic (between-person) components. The second term\ncan be used to obtain unbiased estimates of the SD of the blood pressure\ndistribution in the population. In this regression, the dependent variable\nwas each subject's SBP measurements, excluding the first measurement.\nWe also used a standard logistic regression to estimate the proportion of\nthe population with uncontrolled hypertension, defined as the average of\nMEC-based SBP measurements, excluding the first measurement,\nWe applied the regression coefficients to identical questions in\nBRFSS, which is state representative, to estimate SBP for each\nBRFSS observation in the years corresponding to each NHANES\nround (Table 1 and Figure 1). The BRFSS sample was stratified into\nthe same 6 groups as those used for the above regressions. The\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nindividual BRFSS observations were then pooled using appropriate\nsample weights to obtain estimates of mean SBP and prevalence of\nuncontrolled hypertension by age, sex, and state. We present the\nof age), age standardized to the 2000 US population to account for\ndifferences in age distributions across states and/or over time.\nWe estimated cardiovascular mortality attributable to higher-than-\noptimal SBP using the methods of the comparative risk assessment\nproject, which is described in detail elsewhere.29,30 On the basis of\nthe evidence from observational and intervention studies, attributable\nmortality was estimated by calculating proportional reduction in\ncause-specific cardiovascular mortality if the current SBP distribu-\ntion was reduced to the optimal level of 115 mm Hg (SD,\n6 mm Hg).3 Relative risks for cause-specific mortality for each\n10-mm Hg SBP increment were from the meta-analyses of the\nProspective Studies Collaboration.4\nThe authors had full access to and take full responsibility for the\nintegrity of the data.

We excluded the first measurement, as is also recommended by NHANES documentation, because it was significantly higher than\nsubsequent ones. We dropped observations that did not have at least 1 MEC-based blood pressure measurement.\nAverage MEC-based SBP for each individual was calculated, excluding the first measurement.\nFor consistency, race in BRFSS and NHANES 1999\u00ad2002 was analyzed in the same categories as NHANES III, which had fewer race categories.\n\u00a7This variable was defined as a composite of multiple questions about physician contact for specific conditions in BRFSS.\nInsurance status was not included in the 1988\u00ad1992 period (NHANES III) because the insurance question is asked only from 1991 in BRFSS.\nincluding and excluding insurance status was not statistically significant; therefore, insurance was retained in the analysis for this period.\n\u00b6Body mass index was corrected for bias in self-reported height and weight in telephone interviews using methods reported elsewhere.31\n#The years 1994, 2000, and 2002 were not included in the analysis because BRFSS in most states did not ask about self-reported hypertension.\nand 1992, BRFSS asked only if medication has been prescribed. A comparison of this question with the medication use question during 1988\u00ad1990\nshowed that almost all individuals (97.5%) who reported being prescribed medication also reported using medication. Therefore, we used these\nhypertension status was not asked in BRFSS in this state.\nEzzati et al Blood Pressure and CVD Mortality in US States 907\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\n140 mm Hg increased by 4.3 percentage points; for Amer-\nican men, it declined by 2 percentage points (Table 2). Both\nmen and women had minor increases in self-reported hyper-\ntension over this period (0.5 and 2.2 percentage points,\nrespectively). Measured prevalence of uncontrolled hyperten-\nsive status (including both those who are aware of their\nhypertension and those who are not) is 10 percentage points\nlower than self-reported hypertension in NHANES for both\ntime periods, indicating that many of those diagnosed with\nhypertension have controlled their blood pressure. Between\noccurred in women 60 years of age, whose mean SBP\nincreased by 4.5 mm Hg and uncontrolled hypertension\nprevalence increased by 9 percentage points, compared with\na decrease of 0.4 mm Hg and 2.2 percentage points in older\nmen (Table 2). Below 60 years of age, men had higher mean\nthough the sex difference declined over time, reflecting the\nunfavorable differential trends among women. Proportion-\nally, fewer individuals who knew their hypertension status\n1992 (Table I of the online-only Data Supplement). Of those\nusing medication, a larger proportion achieved SBP below the\nalso Hajjar and Kotchen8).\nPrevious analyses have shown that self-reported weight\nand height differ between in-person interviews with subse-\nquent measurement (NHANES) and telephone surveys\n(BRFSS).31 Testing whether self-reported hypertension is\naffected by the same phenomenon shows that although age-\nand sex-specific self-reported hypertension prevalence dif-\nfered slightly between NHANES and BRFSS, particularly in\nthose 50 years of age, no consistent pattern is apparent to\nindicate systematic bias as a result of telephone survey versus\nin-person interview (Figure I of the online-only Data\nSupplement).\nRegression Results\nRegression coefficients are provided in the online-only Data\nSupplement. A common result in all 24 regressions (6\nregressions for each time period for both the random-effects\nlinear and logistic models) was that SBP and uncontrolled\nhypertension status increased with age, consistent with the\nvast available evidence on age association of blood pres-\nsure.3,9 However, the age gradient was attenuated for those\nstrongest in those diagnosed with hypertension but not using\nmedication (group B). This result possibly indicates the\neffectiveness of blood pressure control, which also may have\nimproved over time.\nOverweight and obesity were associated with significantly\nhigher SBP in those not diagnosed with hypertension (group\nA).

These findings may\nillustrate stricter blood pressure control among those who are\noverweight or obese once they are diagnosed (see also Gregg\net al6). Not having seen a doctor in the past year had a\nsignificant and positive effect on SBP, except for those\ncurrently managing their hypertension, for whom the coeffi-\ncient for physician visit was no longer significant. After\ncontrolling for all other factors, including stratification by\nawareness and medication status, blacks had consistently\nhigher SBP than whites.\nTo validate that levels of variables included in the model\nwere similar between the 2 surveys, we applied the estimated\nregression coefficients to data from both NHANES itself and\nBRFSS to compare estimated national mean SBP and uncon-\ntrolled hypertension. The largest differences in age- and\nsex-specific national estimates were 1.1 mm Hg and 2 per-\ncentage points, respectively. Similar validation checks by\nrace and region gave results within 0.6 mm Hg and 1.4\npercentage points, respectively.\nState-Level Uncontrolled Hypertension Status and\nSelf-Reported Hypertension\nprevalence was highest in the District of Columbia and\nprimarily southern states, including Mississippi, Louisiana,\nAlabama, Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina (18% to 21%\nfor men and 24% to 26% for women); it was lowest in the\nMidwest and the Northeast, including Vermont, Minnesota,\nConnecticut, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Colorado (15% to\nPrevalence of uncontrolled hypertension increased among\nwomen and decreased among men in every state, but signif-\nicant variations were present in state-level trends. For men,\nthe smallest decrease was predominantly in the South,\nwhereas female trends had no clear geographical pattern. For\nwomen, age-standardized uncontrolled hypertension preva-\nlence increased the most in Idaho and Oregon (6 percentage\npoints) and the least in the District of Columbia and Missis-\nsippi (3 percentage points); for men, the largest decreases\nwere in Vermont and Indiana (3 to 4 percentage points), and\nthe smallest were in New Mexico and Louisiana (0.6 to 1.3\npercentage points). Correlation coefficients between preva-\nsion than men in every state by 4 (Arizona) to 7 (Kansas)\nwas on average 1.4 percentage points across states and as low\nas 0.2 in Arkansas and Louisiana. No relationship existed\nbetween change in female and male hypertension prevalence\ncient for sex-specific hypertension change, 0.07). For exam-\nple, the largest and smallest declines in male prevalence were\nin Vermont (3.8 percentage points) and New Mexico (0.6\npercentage points), but both states had about an average\nincrease in female prevalence (4.2 and 5.0 percentage points,\nrespectively). Similarly, the smallest increase in female prev-\nalence was in the District of Columbia (2.8 percentage\npoints), and the largest increases were in Idaho and Oregon\n(6.1 and 5.9 percentage points); these states had relatively\npercentage points in the District of Columbia, Idaho, and\nOregon, respectively).\nmeasured high-risk status for both men and women in every\nstate, but the difference was larger for men (Figure 3 and\nFigure II and Table XI of the online-only Data Supplement).\nAlthough women had higher measured hypertension preva-\nlence than men in all states, they had lower self-reported\nprevalence in all but 6 states (Alabama, Alaska, District of\nColumbia, Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina). Further-\nmore, self-reported hypertension and measured uncontrolled\nhypertension had lower correlation across states for men than\nfor women (Figure 3). For example, men in Washington and\nthe District of Columbia had self-reported hypertension\nprevalence of 30% to 31%, but actual prevalence of those\nwith blood pressure 140 mm Hg was 16% in the former and\n21% in the latter. Similarly, West Virginia and New Mexico\nhad actual prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension of 17%,\nbut self-reported hypertension prevalence was 39% in the\nformer and 25% in the latter.\nState-Level Mean Blood Pressure and\nHypertension by Age and Sex\nWhen considered by age (Figure 4), older women (60 years\nof age) had higher mean SBP (by 5.8 to 12.6 mm Hg) and\nuncontrolled hypertension (by 14 to 20 percentage points)\nWyoming, and South Dakota had the smallest male-female\ndisparities; Nevada, Alaska, and Colorado had the largest.\nYounger and middle-aged (30 to 59 years of age) women had\nlower SBP and uncontrolled hypertension than men of the\nsame ages in all states except in Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada,\nRhode Island, and Wyoming, where women had slightly\nhigher prevalence.\nAmong women, mean SBP and uncontrolled hypertension\nincreased in both age groups and every state in the 1990s.

Of the states with the highest SBP-\nattributable cardiovascular mortality rate, all but Arkansas\nand Wyoming for women and South Dakota and North\nDakota for men were also those with the highest mean SBP.\nIn this latter group of states, even moderate SBP levels led to\nrelatively high attributable mortality because background\ncardiovascular mortality risk is high. The cross-state correla-\ntion between age-standardized mean SBP and age-\nstandardized cardiovascular mortality rate attributable to SBP\nDiscussion\nOur results illustrate important geographic patterns and trends\nin sex- and age-specific SBP and its cardiovascular mortality\nimpacts that were masked by the shortcomings of self-\nreported data. The state-level estimates show that the District\nof Columbia, the South, and the Appalachia had the highest\nSBP and uncontrolled hypertension, consistent with regional\nresults from NHANES III14\u00ad16 and from the Coronary Artery\nRisk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study,11\nwith Mississippi and the District of Columbia faring the\nworst. The Northern Plains, the Northeast, and the Midwest\nhad the lowest levels of SBP and uncontrolled hypertension.\nIn the District of Columbia, Alabama, and Mississippi, the\neffects of high SBP were further magnified by high back-\nground cardiovascular mortality risk, leading to a very large\nabsolute cardiovascular mortality rate attributable to this risk\nfactor.\nSBP and uncontrolled hypertension increased among\nwomen in the 1990s, particularly in older ages, in all US\nstates, but considerable cross-state variation was present in\nlevels and trends. Using the relative risks from the Prospec-\ntive Studies Collaboration,4 we can attribute 2% of coronary\nheart disease deaths and 2% of stroke deaths (400 annual\ndeaths) to the average 3.1-mm Hg rise in mean SBP in young\nand middle-aged (30 to 59 years of age) women between the\n2 NHANES rounds; the proportion of deaths attributable to\nthe 4.6-mm Hg rise in blood pressure in women 60 years of\nage was 3% for coronary heart disease and 4% for stroke\n(12 000 deaths annually). Male SBP declined in older ages\nin all states, with more heterogeneous trends in the young and\nmiddle-aged. As a result of differential trends by sex, the\nmale-female disparities in SBP and uncontrolled hyperten-\nsion in older ages have increased in every state since\naged adults has shrunk or reversed.\nAn important finding of our analysis was that little corre-\nlation existed between changes in SBP of men and women\nacross states. This indicates that state-level programs may not\nhave systematically and uniformly benefited all demographic\ngroups. Self-reported hypertension was higher than measured\nhigh-risk status in every state and for both sexes, broadly\nindicating benefits from hypertension diagnosis and manage-\nment, especially among men. Definitive conclusions about\ndiagnosis coverage and subsequent management among those\ndiagnosed with hypertension and how they may vary by sex\nrequire further investigation, especially in longitudinal stud-\nies such as the CARDIA study.11\nThis analysis has a number of limitations. First, although\nour regression models included important sociodemographic,\nmale\nfemale\nFigure 5. Cardiovascular mortality rate attributable to higher-than-optimal blood pressure by state and sex in 2001. Mortality rates are\nage standardized to the 2000 US population.\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nlifestyle, and health system determinants of blood pressure\nand hypertension diagnosis, other factors affect these such as\ndiet and quality of care.14,32 For instance, we were unable to\ninclude salt intake, an important dietary determinant of blood\npressure, in the model because this question is not asked in\nBRFSS. The effects of some of these factors may be captured\nby the variables in our model (eg, self-reported hypertension,\nbody mass index, insurance status, and visit to a doctor). If\nthe unexplained effects vary systematically across states, the\nmodel might underestimate cross-state variation in blood\npressure. To consider the role of regional variation in blood\npressure above and beyond the variables in our model, we\nincluded region as a variable in the model. (Region is not\nto 23.1% for women. The correlation of estimated uncon-\ntrolled hypertension across states with and without inclusion\nalthough BRFSS provides state-level data for the variables\nincluded in the model, some instruments have changed over\ntime or have been implemented in some years only (Table 1).\nAs a result, the analysis could use BRFSS data for some years\nonly. Third, we conducted our analysis using SBP because of\nits stronger relationship with cardiovascular disease out-\ncomes. Some of the people self-reporting hypertension may\nhave been diagnosed on the basis of their diastolic blood\npressure, which may cause error in our estimates (see Table I\nin the online-only Data Supplement for details). The single\nbest way to reduce uncertainty in our analysis would be to add\na validation component to BRFSS that includes measured\nblood pressure for a random subset of interviewees.\nDespite the uncertainties, these first estimates of SBP and\nuncontrolled hypertension and their effects on cardiovascular\nmortality provide important guides and benchmarks for pri-\nority setting and for designing and evaluating cardiovascular\nprevention programs at the state level. Increasing the effec-\ntive coverage of lifestyle (eg, reduced salt intake) and\npharmacological interventions should be a policy priority in\nstates with high levels of uncontrolled hypertension, with\nspecific emphasis on improving diagnosis and control among\nwomen. Furthermore, in states where the absolute cardiovas-\ncular risk associated with higher-than-optimal blood pressure\nis high because SBP level is high and/or background cardio-\nvascular risk is high, blood pressure control should be\naccompanied by management of other cardiovascular risks on\nthe basis of similar analysis of other risk factors such as body\nmass index,31 blood glucose, and cholesterol. Regular report-\ning of risk factor levels and trends also can help us evaluate\nthe performance of programs in individual states and learn\nfrom states with successful programs.\nSource of Funding\nThis research was supported by a cooperative agreement from the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention through the Association\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.

Regional and racial differences in response to antihypertensive med-\nication use in a randomized controlled trial of men with hypertension in\nthe United States: Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study\nHigh blood pressure is one the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Information on blood pressure and\nuncontrolled hypertension is needed for priority setting and for interventions. In the United States, national data on blood\npressure are obtained by measurement, but at the state level, the data are limited to self-reported hypertension diagnosis.\nSuch self-reported data may be biased for several reasons, including undiagnosed hypertension among people who may not\nhave had health system contact and reduced risk among those with diagnosis who have effectively controlled their\nhypertension status. This analysis uses self-reported hypertension diagnosis and a number of other indicators such as\ninsurance status, history of contact with a doctor, body mass index, age, and other sociodemographic factors to estimate\ntrue blood pressure and hypertension status. The results show that uncontrolled hypertension was highest in the District of\nColumbia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina (18% to 21% of men and 24% to 26%\nof women in these states had uncontrolled hypertension after accounting for differences in age in these states). Uncontrolled\nhypertension was lowest in Vermont, Minnesota, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Colorado, ranging from 15% to\n16% for men and 21% for women. In the 1990s, uncontrolled hypertension increased among women, especially those\n60 years of age, in every state. As a result, early in the 2000s, women had a higher prevalence of uncontrolled\nhypertension than men in every state by 4 to 7 percentage points. Lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for lowering\nblood pressure are particularly needed in the South and Appalachia, with emphasis on control among women.\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nMajid Ezzati, Shefali Oza, Goodarz Danaei and Christopher J.L.
