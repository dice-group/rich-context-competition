This has been attributed, in part, to chronic\nstress. Telomere length (TL) has been used as a biomarker of\nchronic stress: TL is shorter in adults in a variety of contexts,\nincluding disadvantaged social standing and depression. We use\ndata from 40, 9-y-old boys participating in the Fragile Families and\nChild Wellbeing Study to extend this observation to African American\nchildren. We report that exposure to disadvantaged environments\nis associated with reduced TL by age 9 y. We document significant\nassociations between low income, low maternal education, unstable\nfamily structure, and harsh parenting and TL. These effects were\nmoderated by genetic variants in serotonergic and dopaminergic\npathways. Consistent with the differential susceptibility hypothesis,\nsubjects with the highest genetic sensitivity scores had the shortest\nTL when exposed to disadvantaged social environments and the\nlongest TL when exposed to advantaged environments.\ngene\u00adenvironment | adversity | senescence\nAlarge body of research has documented a positive associa-\ntion between exposure to disadvantaged social environ-\nments and morbidity and mortality (1, 2). A key mechanism for\nexplaining this association is chronic stress, which is believed to\ndegrade physiological functioning (3\u00ad6), thus \"weathering\" the\nindividual and making him or her less resistant to disease (7, 8).\nWe examined (i) whether the association between exposure to\na disadvantaged environment and stress biomarkers was evident\nin childhood and (ii) whether the association was more pro-\nnounced for children carrying specific genetic variants. To\nmeasure the effect of stress on children's physiological state, we\nused telomere length (TL) as a biomarker. A recent line of re-\nsearch suggests that accelerated shortening of the telomere, the\nsequence repeat at the end of each chromosome, is\na good biomarker of exposure to lifetime stress (3, 6, 8\u00ad11). To\nmeasure the social environment, we used an index based on four\ndimensions: economic conditions, parenting quality, family structure/\nstability, and maternal depression.\nOur analysis extends the existing literature on social environ-\nments and TL in several ways. First, we focus on children, whereas\nprior research has focused primarily on adults, with few exceptions\n(12). Second, we examine a sample of African American boys\nwhereas prior research has used mostly samples of whites. Third, we\nexamine for the first time, to our knowledge, whether the associa-\ntion between the social environment and TL is moderated by var-\niations in selected genes. Although recent research suggests that\nsome people are genetically more sensitive than others to their\nsocial environments (13\u00ad15), research on TL has not taken account\nof this potential moderating factor. Finally, we use a saliva DNA\nsource of TL, which we show to be highly correlated with blood\nleukocyte TL (see Figs. S2 and S3). Our study validates other\nwork showing that multiple tissues, including saliva, can be used\nDisadvantaged Social Environments and Telomere Length\nDuring DNA replication, chromosome ends shorten with each\ncycle of chromosomal replication and cellular division. The repetitive\ntelomere sequence is sacrificed to protect genetic information near\nthe ends of chromosomes. In addition, the presence of the telomere\nprevents fusion of adjoining chromosomal ends. Over time, due to\neach cell division, the telomere ends become shorter, and so the\ntelomere has been referred to as a \"mitotic clock\" (11, 18\u00ad20). As-\nsociated with progressive telomere shortening, the cell activates\nsignaling events that produce replicative senescence. Salient to this\nreport, stress appears to augment replicative TL shortening, perhaps\nby promoting nonenzymatic hydrolysis of telomere base pairs (11,\n18). Stress-related telomere shortening could evoke physiological\ngests several possible behavioral mediators of the negative asso-\nciation between stress and TL, including smoking, mental illness\n(particularly depression), caregiver stress, and obesity (23\u00ad25).\nConsidering the strong association between social deprivation and\nthese mediators, it is not surprising that some measures of social\nstanding and social deprivation have also been found to be associ-\nSignificance\nThis paper makes two contributions to research on the link\nbetween the social environment and health. Using data from\na birth cohort study, we show that, among African American\nboys, those who grow up in highly disadvantaged environ-\nments have shorter telomeres (at age 9) than boys who grow\nup in highly advantaged environments. We also find that the\nassociation between the social environment and telomere\nlength (TL) is moderated by genetic variation within the sero-\ntonin and dopamine pathways. Boys with the highest genetic\nsensitivity scores had the shortest TL when exposed to disad-\nvantaged environments and the longest TL when exposed to\nadvantaged environments. To our knowledge, this report is the\nfirst to document a gene\u00adsocial environment interaction for TL,\na biomarker of stress exposure.\nAuthor contributions: C.M., J.H., S.S.M., J.B.-G., I.G., and D.N. designed research; C.M., J.H.,\nS.S.M., J.B.-G., I.G., and D.N. performed research; S.R.S. and D.N. contributed new re-\nagents/analytic tools; C.M., J.H., S.S.M., A.B., J.B.-G., I.G., and D.N. analyzed data; and\nC.M. and D.N. wrote the paper.\nReviewers: T.E.S., Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles; S.J.S.,\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,\nNational Institutes of Health.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\n1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

A second limita-\ntion of current TL literature is that most studies are based on\nsamples of middle-class whites; research on minority children and\nchildren from low-income families is sparse. Finally, existing re-\nsearch on TL has not examined the role of genetic sensitivity in\nmodifying the association between the social environment and TL.\nA growing body of research shows that specific gene variants\nmoderate the association between the social environment and\nchildren's health and well-being (13\u00ad15). Of particular interest are\ngenes found in the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. We\nhypothesized that the association between children's social envi-\nronment and TL would be moderated by specific gene variants.\nResults\nOur analysis is based on 40 African American boys (age 9) who\nparticipated in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study\n(FFCWS). We focused on African American children because\nthis group is understudied, and we focused on boys because prior\nresearch indicates that boys may be more sensitive than girls to\nnegative family conditions (14). As described in Materials and\nMethods, our sample was chosen to represent extreme environ-\nments, based on the child's family's economic conditions, par-\nenting quality, family structure/stability, and maternal depression\n(see Materials and Methods for more details about these mea-\nsures). Half of the children in the sample were raised in very\ndisadvantaged environments, and the other half were raised in\nadvantaged environments. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics\nfor the variables used to measure children's environments along\nwith other variables used in the models. Body mass index (BMI)\ndid not differ between harsh and nourishing environments. Due\nto concerns of outliers and influential data points in a sample of\n40, we use robust ordinary least squares (OLS) regression (using\nCook's D and Huber weighting), which is 95% as efficient as\ntraditional OLS (28).\nSocial Predictors of Telomere Length. Model 1 (M1) of Table 2\nshows that living in a disadvantaged environment was associated\nshow the associations between boys' TL and each of the envi-\nronmental measures separately. Model 2 (M2) shows that a\ndoubling of the family income/needs ratio was associated with\na 5% increase in the boys' TL (P = 0.03). To provide more\ncontext for this estimate, in the larger Fragile Families sample\nthe mean income/needs ratio is 0.7 for children at the 25th\npercentile and 2.7 for children at the 75th percentile, which is\nequivalent to an 8% difference in TL under this model. As\na robustness test for economic conditions, we also examined the\nassociation between a boy's TL and his mother's education (see\nM5 in Table 2). Compared with children of mothers with less\nthan a high school education, having a mother with a high school\ndegree is associated with a 32% increase in a child's TL (P =\n0.006), and having a mother with at least some postsecondary\neducation is associated with a 35% increase in TL (P = 0.005). In\nsum, family economic status was a significant predictor of a boy's\nTL measured in middle childhood. Model 3 shows that a low\nscore on the parenting quality index was associated with a 3%\ndecrease in a boy's TL. Finally, model 4 shows that being ex-\nposed to multiple changes in family structure was associated with\nGene\u00adEnvironment Interactions with Telomere Length. The models\nin Table 3 present estimates of the main and interaction effects\nof dopamine and serotonin pathway genes and the environ-\nmental factor for a boy's TL, controlling for age of the mother\nand age 9 standardized BMI. Because there are a variety of ways\nto code genetic effects, and no set way of combining multiple\ngenetic markers, we use two common methods of coding and\nsumming genetic markers. A key component of this coding is\nusing the gene\u00adenvironment interaction literature of these genes\nto designate a \"sensitizing\" or reactive allele. This sensitizing\nallele is often the allele typically thought to confer risk, but in\nthis case that definition would apply only to those in the harsh\nenvironment, whereas those with the same allele would see an\namplification of the positive effect in the nurturing environment.\nOur serotonergic sensitivity score sums the sensitizing alleles or\nhomozygous genotypes composed of sensitizing alleles for four\nserotonin markers from two genes (5-HTT: 5-HTTLPR and\ntivity score similarly sums the sensitizing alleles or homozygous\ngenotypes of sensitizing alleles for four dopamine markers (DAT1,\nTable 1.

M3\u00adM4 shows the interactions for the\ndopamine pathway genetic sensitivity scores. Although less de-\nfinitive than in the case of the serotonergic pathway, the negative\nassociation between the social environment and TL is stronger\nfor boys with dopaminergic pathway genetic variants most associ-\nated with higher levels environmental sensitivity (M3: b = -0.18,\nFig. 1, Upper shows that, among children with 0 sensitizing\nserotonin genotypes, there is little difference in TL between\nchildren in advantaged and disadvantaged environments. How-\never, for children with higher levels of genetic sensitivity (i.e.,\nthose with 2+ sensitizing genotypes), we see a large difference. In\nfact, consistent with the differential susceptibility hypothesis, the\npoint estimates suggest that the most sensitive group has the\nlonger TL in the advantaged environment and the shorter TL in\nthe disadvantaged environment. This finding implies a geneti-\ncally encoded differential sensitivity to the environment using TL\nas the biomarker (13\u00ad15). Fig. 1, Lower shows a similar (but not\nas strong) relationship with dopamine pathway genotypes. Namely,\nfor boys with 0 sensitizing dopamine genotypes, there is only a\nsmall, insignificant difference in TL by environment, whereas for\nboys with 1 and 2+ sensitizing dopamine genotypes, there is a large\nand significant difference by environment, with boys with sensitizing\ngenotypes having the longer TL in advantaged environments and\nthe shorter TL in disadvantaged environments.\nDiscussion\nOur analysis makes a number of methodological and substantive\ncontributions. We demonstrate the utility of using saliva DNA\nto measure the children's telomere length (SI Text). This is\nimportant in that most TL research uses blood, which is more\ndifficult to collect than saliva. That saliva DNA is a valid in-\ndicator of TL makes it easier and less expensive for researchers\nto collect samples of TL at multiple points in time and thereby to\nexamine how changes in the social environment are associated\ncontribution is the use of prospective data to measure children's\nenvironmental exposures in real time. Only one study that we\nknow of used real-time measures of children's environments and\nthat study examined ages 5\u00ad10 (27). Finally, our analysis is, to\nour knowledge, the first to examine TL in a sample of African\nAmerican children.\nOur analysis provides evidence that exposure to disadvantaged\nenvironments in childhood is associated with shorter TL. Decom-\nposing the environmental factor into its different components also\nprovided insight. Here we were able to replicate the positive asso-\nciation between family socioeconomic status (SES) and TL (8, 9, 17,\n26) for a sample of children. In addition, we were able to document\nsignificant associations between family structure/stability and TL\nand harsh parenting and TL.\nDue to sample size limitations, we were not able to examine the\nindependent effect of each of these measures. Nevertheless, we\ntested the measured variables pairwise and found that the SES\nmeasures were the strongest predictors of TL. Although the other\nvariables maintained the same pattern of association, the coef-\nficients declined dramatically with the inclusion of poverty ratio\nand mother's education.\nTable 2.

All models control for age of mother and age 9 BMI.\nAll gene scores are mean centered. P < 0.10, *P < 0.05, one-tailed.\nMost importantly, to our knowledge, this report is the first to\nexamine a gene\u00adsocial environment interaction for a biomarker,\nTL. Using two genetic sensitivity scores (related to serotonin and\ndopamine pathways), we found that African American boys with\nthe highest scores on the serotonin and dopamine pathway ge-\nnetic sensitivity had shorter TL than their peers when exposed to\ndisadvantaged social environments and longer TL when exposed\nto advantaged environments. A similar pattern was found for the\ndopamine pathway genetic sensitivity score.\nOur findings on gene\u00adsocial environment interactions raise in-\ntriguing questions about the mechanisms involved. We suggest that\nan individual's genetic architecture moderates the magnitude and\ndirection of the physiological response to exogenous stressors.\nMaterials and Methods\nSample. Our data were taken from two studies: the FFCWS and a benchmark\nstudy designed to provide information on the effect of the sample collection\nprocess and tissue source for TL. FFCWS follows a stratified, multistage,\nprobability sample of children born in large US cities (200,000+) between\nto unmarried parents (three-quarters unwed, one-quarter wed) (29). Be-\ncause of the large oversample of nonmarital births and because of the urban\nlocation of the study, the children in the sample come from a wide range of\nsocial environments. This feature of the data afforded us greater power to\ndetect the effects of social environment than an equally sized sample of all\nbirths would have provided. Baseline interviews with mothers and fathers\nwere conducted within 48 h of the child's birth, and subsequent interviews\nwere conducted when the focal child was 1, 3, 5, and 9 y old. Saliva DNA\nsamples were taken at the age 9 follow-up, using the Oragene DNA sample\ncollection kit (DNA Genotek Inc.). DNA was extracted following the manu-\nfacturer's protocol and stored at -80\u00b0 until use. We used data from all five\nwaves and restricted the analysis to children with genetic information. From\nthis pool we selected subsamples of children from the most extreme envi-\nronments in the FFCWS. Initially, we identified 40 families based on a three-\nstep process. In the first step, the sample was constrained to boys meeting\nthe following conditions: (i) boys provided saliva at age 9 (wave 5) in-home\ninterview, (ii) whose mother self-identified her race as black or African\nAmerican, (iii) for whom no data were missing on the criterion variables\ndescribed below, and (iv) who were male.\nNext, we arrayed the subsample on an index of advantage\u00addisadvantage\nfrom birth to age 9 based on an equally weighted combination of (i) family\neconomic conditions, (ii) parenting practices, and (iii) family structure/sta-\nbility. Finally, we took children with the 20 highest scores in the disadvan-\ntaged index whose mothers had experienced at least one depressive episode\nand the children with the 20 lowest scores on the index whose mothers had\nnever experienced depression. Thus, boys who scored highest on this index\n(n = 20) lived in homes with high levels of poverty, high levels of family\ninstability, harsh parenting, and maternal depression. Boys who scored\nlowest (n = 20) lived in affluent, stable families and were not exposed to\neither harsh parenting or maternal depression. We then assayed the children\nfor TL.\nTelomere Measurement. Telomere length was measured using our modifi-\ncation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay that incorporates an oligomer\nstandard to permit measurement of absolute (in kilobases per chromosome)\nrather than relative telomere length (30). Briefly, this method adapts the\napproach of Cawthon (31) in which relative telomere length is determined\nby quantitative PCR by determining the ratio of telomere copy repeats to\na single-copy reference gene (the gene is 36B4). To determine absolute\ntelomere length, an 84mer oligomer standard TTAGGG is used to construct\na standard curve. A separate standard curve for the single-copy gene\nincorporates a 79mer containing the reference gene 36B4. This enables\ncalculation of total telomere length per diploid genome, whereas the 36B4\nproduct gives the number of diploid genomes. Length per chromosome is\ngiven by dividing telomere length per genome by 92, the number of telo-\nmeres per diploid genome. Samples are measured in triplicate and the\nresults are averaged. Distribution of samples in the 96-well plates was ran-\ndomized, and each plate contains at least 10 repeats from prior runs to\ndetect and limit potential batch effects. To mitigate batch effects, reference\nDNA from a tel- cell line and the same line after stable integration of tel\nwere included in each plate. Reference DNA was harvested at a single time,\naliquoted, and frozen. Telomere length was normalized by this reference to\nassure plate-to-plate consistency. The coefficient of variation of a standard\nThe average TL for our sample was 9.9 kb long, with a SD of 3.3 kb. Fig. S1,\nUpper indicates that the TL data are positively skewed (even with outliers\nremoved). The best transformation of the data are the natural log (other\ntransformations not shown). Fig. S1, Lower shows the distribution and Q-Q\nplot of log-transformed TL. Once transformed, both distributions track the\nnormal distribution fairly well. Due to the close approximation to normality,\nwe used log telomere length (lnTL) for the remainder of the analyses.\nMost prior reports of telomere length have used DNA derived from cir-\nculating blood cells. To evaluate TL in DNA derived from blood cells and saliva,\nwe compared TL in DNA from both origins from 16 volunteers. Telomere\nlength was significantly greater in saliva than in blood leukocyte-derived\nblood cells) P < 0.001] (Fig. S2). However, saliva and leukocyte DNA lengths\nSocial Environment Measures. In addition to comparing boys exposed to the\nbest and worst environments, we also examined the association between TL\nand each of the individual components used to construct the disadvantage/\nadvantage index. To measure the economic conditions of the household, we\nused the average income/needs ratio across all five waves of the study. This\nmeasure adjusts total household income by household size and is a better\nindicator of economic resources than income alone. To measure the mother's\ncompleted education, we used four categories: (i) less than high school, (ii)\nhigh school graduate, and (iii) at least some college. To measure family\nstructure/stability, we used four categories: (i) stable two-parent families, (ii)\nstable single-mother families, (iii) families with one partnership change, and\n(iv) families with multiple partnership changes. To measure harsh parenting,\nwe used a count of how often mothers engaged in harsh psychological\nbehaviors (e.g., yelling, threatening) and harsh physical behaviors (hitting,\nslapping). These items were taken from the Conflict Tactics Scale (32). To\nmeasure maternal depression, we used the composite international diagnostic\ninterview (CIDI) short form (33). We measured mother's self-reported age\nFig. 1. ln(telomere length) by environment type and serotonin pathway\n(Upper) and dopamine pathway (Lower) homozygous genotype counts. Al-\nthough the possible range of homozygous genotypes was 0\u00ad4, due to the small\nnumber of minor allele frequencies the range is top-coded at 2+. For the se-\nrotonin pathway genotypes, the environment effect is borderline for 0 geno-\ntypes (P = 0.09), not significant for 1 genotype (P = 0.32), and significant for 2+\ngenotypes (P = 0.02). For the dopamine pathway genotypes, the environment\ndifference is not significant for 0 genotypes (P = 0.63), significant for 1 geno-\nGENETICS\nat birth. Father's age is highly correlated with mother's age (0.8) and\nwas missing from multiple of the single-mother births; therefore, only\nmother's age was used. BMI was assessed in the home by an interviewer and\nwas age-standardized to age 9 to account for slight differences in age\nat interview.\nGenes and Their Variants. Serotonergic. Our measure of the serotoninergic\npathway comes from four genetic variants each of two genes. First, we use\ntwo length variants within the most studied gene of this system, the serotonin\ntransporter gene (5-HTT). This gene codes for the protein that recycles the\nserotonin from the synapses. The two well-examined variants of the sero-\ntonin transporter gene are (i) a functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the\n5 regulatory region and (ii) a 17-bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)\nin the second intron region (called STin2 VNTR). For the 5-HTTLPR poly-\nmorphism, the most common alleles are the short (S) 14-repeat and long (L)\n16-repeat of a 23-bp incomplete repeat, but other less common repeats are\nalso found in various populations. Compared with the L allele, the S allele of\nthe 5-HTTLPR polymorphism has been shown to be associated with reduced\ntranscription (34). For the STin2 polymorphism, the two most common\nalleles are the 10 and 12 repeat, and compared with the 10-repeat allele, the\n12-repeat allele is also associated with reduced transcription (35). We also\nused variants of the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2), which codes\ntyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of sero-\ntonin (36). Alleles of TPH2 have been associated with depression, bipolar\ndisorder, and other mental health problems (37, 38). We used variants at\nthat appears associated with reduced transcription rates. Similarly, the sec-\nond variant, rs1386494, a T/C SNP, is also associated with reduced transcription\nDue to the novelty of the differential susceptibility model, there is little\nguidance in how to code the reactivity of a genetic variant or polymorphism.\nTo date, most studies have taken genetic markers that were formerly clas-\nsified as \"risky\" and reclassified them as reactive or \"sensitizing\" (13, 15).\nNormally, these risky (now sensitizing) polymorphisms are the variants as-\nsociated with lower transcriptional efficiency (15), and this is generally the\ncase in our study. In combining the serotonergic system variants, we create\ntwo serotonin pathway genetic sensitivity scores by (i) summing the number\nof homozygous genotypes composed of sensitizing alleles (5-HTTLPR-S,\nSTin2-12, TPH2a-G, TPH2b-T) and (ii) summing the number of sensitizing\nalleles. This results in a possible score of 0\u00ad4 for the first measure and 0\u00ad8 for\nthe second measure.\nDopaminergic. For the dopaminergic pathway, we used one measure each for\nfour different genes along the dopaminergic pathway. DAT1 (SLC6A3,\n5p15.3) is the gene that codes the dopamine transporter protein that\nintron 14) is a SNP, and the C allele is associated with reduced transcription\nfor postsynaptic dopamine receptors (42). We measured the DRD2 taq1a\nwe used the 48-bp VNTR in the third exon. We coded 6\u00ad10 repeats as \"long\"\nor 7R alleles (which make up 80% of long alleles) and call the short allele\n\"4R\" because it constitutes 85% of the short (2R-5R) alleles. Finally, catechol-\nO-methyltransferase (COMT, 22q11.21) codes for a major enzyme involved in\nthe inactivation of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, and the Met allele of the\nSimilar to the serotonergic scores, we created two dopamine pathway\ngenetic sensitivity scores by (i) summing the number of homozygous gen-\notypes composed of sensitizing alleles (the C allele for DAT1, 7R for DRD4,\nT allele for DRD2, and Met allele for COMT) and (ii) summing the number of\nsensitizing alleles. This results in a possible score of 0\u00ad4 for the first measure\nand 0\u00ad8 for the second measure.\nGenotypes for HTTLPR, STin2, and DRD4 were obtained by PCR followed\nby gel or capillary electrophoresis, and other variants were determined by\nreal-time PCR using primer systems supplied by Life Technology.\n"
