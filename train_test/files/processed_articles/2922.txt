The gap widens with surpluses of the\nGerman trade balance to other euro area countries and becomes negative,\nwhen surpluses of the trade balance contract. This phenomenon is accom-\npanied by a new pattern of money growth, which is not driven by domestic\ncredit of banks any more but by their net foreign assets. German nonfinan-\ncial corporations have rising equity ratios and provide other sectors with\nfunds on a net basis. Moreover, their deposits with German banks have\ngrown at a much stronger pace than their loans.

Over\nthe Great Moderation period these concerns took a back seat to a view of mone-\ntary policy conducted exclusively by changing interest rates. In academic circles,\nmoney and credit aggregates moved away from mainstream economics. Taylor-like\nrules became the standard approach to model central bank behaviour in the 1990s\n(see, for example, Svensson 1997), while money and credit aggregates disappeared\nfrom the bulk of monetary policy models (see, for example, Woodford 2003) de-\nspite the fact that banks create the major part of money in our financial system.\nFocusing on money and credit aggregates challenged central banks as standard\nmoney demand models had difficulties in explaining monetary dynamics on the\nbasis of developments in the traditional determinants, such as output, prices and\ninterest rates. However, a central bank cannot ignore the information from mone-\ntary developments in its assessment and policy considerations, though the relevant\ndebate is rather how they should do so.\nBesides the dominant neo-classical and New Keynesian mainstream, the post-\nKeynesian research paradigm allows for a comprehensive modeling of monetary\nvariables in the stock-flow consistent framework. Godley and Lavoie (2007) pro-\nvide a compendium to these modeling techniques. Beyond the post-Keynesian\nschool of thought, Werner (1997, 2005) was also a distinctive exception in the pre-\nrepeatedly stresses the fundamental importance of credit creation process and its\ninstitutional setup for sustainable growth and financial stability. The financial\ncrisis led to a critical assessment of the current monetary order, which includes a\nrevival of the Chicago Plan (see Benes and Kumhof 2012) and 100 percent reserves\nas proposed by Fisher (1936). Others try to formulate alternative approaches for\nconsidering the modern money system without disregarding its operational char-\nacteristics, see for example Roche (2011).\nThe focus of our analysis is less radical. The starting puzzle is the fact that\nGerman credit does not drive German money and that there is a gap between Ger-\nman credit growth and GDP growth. German enterprises were traditionally known\nfor their strong bank dependence and low equity ratios and not surprisingly, bank\ncredit to the nonfinancial corporate sector was the main driving force of German\nmoney growth. Since the turn of the millenium this equity ratios started growing\nsteadily and deposits of nonfinancial corporations increased strongly in relation\nto bank credit. Current account surpluses, in particular, trade account surpluses,\nincreased, while growth of net foreign assets at German banks increased at an\neven stronger pace. A major destination of both, the real sector and the financial\nflows, were other EMU countries. German enterprises provided other sectors with\nfunds on a net basis as their surplus funds in the non-financial corporation sector\nincreased, i.e. the increase of gross investment fell short of the sum of retained\nearnings and depreciation.1 Internal financing dominated, while a changing struc-\nture of external financing contributed to waning traditional bank credit only to a\nminor extent.2\nThe driving forces of German money changed. It is not driven by domestic\nbank credit any more, but by foreign credit. Accordingly, net foreign assets are\nnow the main counterpart of the German contribution to euro area money.\nIn our work we attempt an inspection of driving factors for German low credit\ngrowth in an alternative monetary framework. Despite the importance of export\norientation there may be another important reason: German membership in the\nEuropean monetary union by itself. An unique combination of export competi-\ntiveness and a membership in a large monetary union form the frame (common\ncurrency, no exchange rates) where domestic credit is partly substituted by cur-\nrent account surpluses surpluses. Hence, in some sense we confirm the conclusions\nof Koo (2008), who suspects that Germany used its high export performacne to\nescape a balance sheet recession in the beginning of the millenium. In addition,\nwe point out how operational characteristics of a monetary union can change the\ncredit creation dynamics in the corresponding countries. The rest of the paper is\norganized as follows: Section 2 establishes the \"Puzzle\" of German credit growth\nby identifying a credit gap, which \"lacks\" respective the observed GDP expan-\nsion rate. Section 3 attempts to explain the gap by relating it to German trade\n1The main recipients of these funds were German enterprises foreign affiliates, which covered\npart of their funding needs using the equity capital provided by their parent companies, see\n2While the share of market-based external financing has remained virtually unchanged, credit\nto the corporate sector has gained importance during the periods of economic weakness in the\nsurpluses with the Eurozone countries. The next section reconsiders our findings\nfrom the European perspective, indicating that the \"closing\" of German credit\ngap was, however, hardly possible without participation of the German banking\nsystem. Section 5 outlines the substitution mechanics between export cash-flows\nand domestic credit theoretically in a simple two-country model of post-Keynesian\ntype. The final section concludes.\n2 The Puzzle of German Credit Growth\nIn the last two decades it is hardly possible to find any stable correlations between\ncredit aggregates and aggregated measures of economic activity like GDP in Ger-\nmany. To illustrate these empirical findings in more detail we compute the results\nof Granger causality test as well as simple correlations between the growth rates\nof nominal German GDP and nominal bank credit volume to non-bank firms, see\nupper plot of Figure 1. The statistics are calculated for different subsamples of\nthe last three decades, the results are displayed in Table 1. In the decade be-\nfore the German reunification credit growth Granger causes GDP growth and the\ncorrelation between them is positive. In the first decade after the reunification\nthere is no significant link between credit and GDP growth in terms of Granger\ncausality. During the last decade the direction of Granger causality changes and\nthe correlation becomes negative.\nHowever, a stable positive relationship between credit and output is crucial\nfor estimating any credit demand or supply equation. Now our intention is to\ndecompose the German credit growth and to extract a component, which is highly\ncorrelated with the production dynamics. Finally we demonstrate that the pro-\nposed decomposition works well before the reunification and in the first decade\nafter it but fails in the last one.\nFor this purpose we adopt the framework proposed by Werner (1997) and\nexplained in more detail in Werner (2005), called the quantity theorem of disag-\ngregated credit. Werner builds his analysis on the well-known quantity theory of\nmoney, agruing that an increase of output, expressed in terms of number and value\nof transactions in an economy in a given period (Q), can only be achieved by the\nnGDP, YoY%\nnC, YoY%\nnGDP, YoY%\nnCR, YoY%\nFigure 1: Nominal GDP growth (nGDP), nominal bank credit (for non-\nbanks, nC) growth, productive credit growth (nCR) in Germany, yoy-\nrates (notional stocks used to calculate credit growth rates).

However, the traditional\nquantity theory exposed a rather bad performance in terms of the money velocity\nin the past. Economic theory postulates a constant money velocity, but this is\nempirically not the case, since a trending money velocity was required in order to\nbalance two sides of the quantity equation.\nform with the gross domestic product as output measure actually is not an equation\nsince the money stock in circulation is also used in transactions, which are not\nmeasured by the GDP, for example, most of financial transactions. For this reason,\nif the number of non-GDP transactions increases, for example due to a financial\nmarket boom, the estimated money velocity has to decrease, otherwise the equation\nis not balanced. In order to balance the equation we should use a money measure\nthat is only used for GDP transactions, however no such measure exists because\nit is hardly possible to differentiate between deposits for GDP and deposits for\nnon-GDP purposes. Hence, Werner proposes to change the balance sheet side\nconsidering credit aggregates. This change is appropriate since banks expand the\nsize of both sides of their balance sheets by granting loans and creating deposits\nsimultaneously. However, only bank loans or other form of bank investments\nare considered, because investments by non-bank institutions do not constitute\ncreation of new means of payments but only a redistribution of available means\nof payments in the economy. Typically banks are required to report information\nabout borrowers if they lend. This information could be used to discriminate\nbetween credit aggregates for different purposes, thus enabling us to approximate\ncredit for GDP and non-GDP uses.\nFirst, Werner (1997) formulates the Quantity Equation in terms all economic\ntransactions\nCV = PQ, (2)\nwhere C, V , P and Q denote credit, money velocity, price level and the total\nnumber of transactions respectively. Second, GDP-based and non-GDP transac-\ntions are separated, so that Q is replaced by real GDP Y . However, credit, money\nvelocity and price level are replaced as well, linking new measures to the GDP\nCY V Y = PY Y, (3)\nwith CY , V Y and PY denoting credit for GDP-based transactions, money velocity\nin the real economy and finally the GDP deflator. Assuming a constant money ve-\nlocity and considering growth rates instead of levels the equation can be simplified\nconsiderably as follows\ncY\nt\n= yN\nt\nwhere yN\nt\nand cY\nt\nare nominal GDP and credit for GDP transactions in logs re-\nspectively. Since nominal GDP series are available for most countries, the main\ntask reduces to finding appropriate measures of credit aggregate for productive\npurposes.\nNow we apply the framework of the quantity theorem of disaggregated credit\nto study the credit growth in Germany. First, a measure of credit aggregate\nfor productive purposes has to be found. An obvious choice for the productive\ncredit aggregate is bank credit granted to non-bank firms. Since housing credit\nand mortgages of private households are often used for non-GDP transactions\nlike buying land or already existing real estate, we do not include them in our\nproductive credit measure. Furthermore, consumption credit usually played only\na minor role in Germany, so that we do not include it until now as well. The\nresults turned out to be robust also after including consumption credit.\nGrowth rates of nominal GDP and bank credit for non-financial firms are plot-\nted in the upper subplot of Figure 1. We see that even though the one-to-one\nrelationship between credit and production growth seems to be fulfilled, this is a\nvery rough approximation, since rather large and persistent deviations from the\npostulated equations are observed. In particular, there are two subsequent peri-\nods, where we observe a significant gap between the credit and GDP growth: (a)\nthe decade after the German reunification as well as (b) the subsequent decade\nwhich is mainly characterized by the existence and functioning of the European\nMonetary Union.\nIn order to refine the productive credit measure we consider also bank credit\nfor non-banks subject to different industry branches. The overall series of bank\ncredit for non-banks exhibits a rising GDP-to-credit ratio. It turns out that this is\nmainly due to the credit granted to the business services branch. The ratio of credit\nfor business services firms to its own value added is strongly rising until the last\ndecade. The branch of financial services (non-banks) features very high and erratic\ncredit growth rates as well. Hereupon we remove these two components from the\noverall bank credit to non-banks and compare it with the GDP growth rates again,\nsee the lower plot in Figure 1. It is easy to see that the approximation resemble\nfinancial and business services credit from the total bank credit volume for non-\nbank firms enlarges the gap between the productive credit series and GDP growth\neven more. Moreover, the new credit growth series keeps its negative correlation\nwith the GDP growth during the Great Recession and the subsequent recovery.\nIn addition, we performed some robustness checks by testing whether other\nliability components of non-banks are sufficient to close the gap between credit\nand production growth in the last decade. We considered the credit volumes of\nnon-banks from the German flow of funds, which include credit granted to non-\nbanks from abroad as well as credit granted by other non-banks. Further, bonds\nissued by non-banks as well as their total liabilities were considered. However,\nnone of these modifications turned out to be sufficient to close the gap between\nnominal GDP and liability growth of non-banks - the shape of the series remained\nqualitatively the same in all cases.\n3 The Ebb and Flow of Retained Profits\nThere seems to be a gap between credit growth of non-bank firms and German\nGDP growth. A possible solution is foreign credit, which can drive domestic money\ngrowth. Foreign credit, however, does not provide financing for domestic firms,\nbut financing of those who purchase goods and services from domestic firms. We\nrewrite the equation in the following way\ncY\nt\n+ gt\n= yN\nt\nwhere gt\ndenotes the credit gap. Indeed if we consider the consolidated balance\nsheet of the German banking system and compute the quotient between the volume\nof all bank deposits of non-bank firms and bank credit granted to non-bank firms,\nthe corresponding picture supports the view stated in Equation 5. As shown in\nFigure 2 the deposit volume expanded with a higher rate than the credit borrowed\nby non-bank firms since the start of the millenium. Consequently there was no\nevident shortage of money, which could hinder the expansion of economic activity.\nAt the turn of the millenium a continuing improvement of the German export\nperformance relative to the other member states was under way. Many argue\nthat the widening trade and current account surpluses reflect structural reforms\ninitiated in the early 2000s, which boosted German competitiveness. Surpluses,\nhowever, in particular grew to Southern member states of EMU such as Greece,\nPortugal, Italy and Spain. Furthermore, money creation in Germany changed\nconsiderably. This suggests that German membership in the European monetary\nunion was also important. While domestic credit to non-banks was the driving\nforce of money creation in Germany before the monetary union, net foreign assets\nbecame the dominating counterpart of the German contribution to money in the\neuro area. In Figure 3 (upper plot) we present money growth in Germany and the\n3 gives evidence that the pattern of money creation changed considerably with the\nstart of the monetary union. Furthermore, an analysis of national contributions\n3A direct comparison of the two periods is difficult due to statistical breaks and changes in\nthe definition of money and to the fact that currency as part of money cannot be nationally\nearmarked in a monetary union any more. Furthermore, net foreign assets in Germany include\ninterbank claims in the euro area and also TARGET-balances of the Bundesbank, which did not\nexist before monetary union.\nto money and its counterparts in the euro area shows that credit creation has\nincreasingly shifted to southern European countries, namely to Spain, before the\noutbreak of the crisis (see Deutsche Bundesbank 2013, p. 51).\nThus if current account and trade balances are widening, the demand for do-\nmestic credit is expected to decrease. The credit gap gt\ndefined in Equation 5 is\npositive and the corresponding credit aggregates tend to contract given some GDP\nlevel. This is what we observe in the upper plot of Figure 4. Absolute seasonal\ndifferences of German trade balances relative to the European Union (where the\nEurozone constitutes the bulk of dynamics and other countries are closely related\nto it) are fitting the credit gap quite well.4 The resemblance is especially close\nat the trough of the Great Recession. Here the credit gap becomes negative, the\ntrade balance contracts rapidly and more domestic credit is demanded in order to\ncompensate for the shortage of inflowing liquidity. It is worth mentioning why we\nhave to differentiate the trade balance. Since the whole economy is expanding, only\na growing trade balance can compensate the positive credit gap. Consequently if\ntrade balance stops widening, credit contraction has to revert providing necessary\nfunds for the expanding economy. This is what we observe just before the outbreak\nof the financial crisis.\nNext we check whether the credit gap gt\nis only resembled by current account\nand trade imbalance with European countries. In the lower plot of Figure 4 abso-\nlute seasonal differences of German trade balance relative to all non-EU countries\nand the credit gap are compared. A visual inspection shows that the comovement\nis not as pronounced as in the EU case. Even more striking are the corresponding\nthe lower plot. There is virtually no significant correlation between the credit gap\nand the trade balance dynamics relative to the non-EU countries.\nWe can draw the following conclusion: if a competitive country is a member\nin a monetary union and is running a significant current account surplus with\nother members of the monetary union, then differences between domestic and\nforeign credit creation can more easily fade away. If export revenues are strongly\nincreasing, non-financial firms finance themselves via retained profits which tend to\n4We amalgamed the Eurozone and non-EMU EU-countries into one group, since the Eurozone\ndynamics dominates in absolute terms and the trade balance with the non-EMU part is closely\ncorrelated with the EMU. The non-EMU part of the European Union has also strong financial\nlinks with the Eurozone.\nsubstitute domestic credit. If export revenues sharply decrease due, for example,\nto some unexpected transitory shock, the firms demand more domestic credit in\norder to bridge the recession. In such an economy the credit dynamics is supposed\nto be anticyclical relative to GDP, increasing retained profits correspond with\ndecreasing domestic credit demand. This is in contrast to the standard case where\nincreasing domestic credit creation stimulates production expansion and retained\nprofits.\n4 Money Creation in the EMU Perspective\nAccording to the evidence German export firms demand less domestic credit and\nfinance higher production from retained profits, when export revenues are high,\nat least inside a monetary union. The missing link between GDP growth and\ncredit growth seem to be changes in retained profits, but this is not the end of the\nstory, because also retained profits ultimately need a source of financing. Export\nrevenues of German firms are import expenditures abroad, which are financed by\nforeign credit to foreign nonbanks. The funding for the foreign credit business\nincreasingly took place abroad, but inside EMU. An important reason for the\nincrease of cross-border funding of European banks was the start of the monetary\nunion, or presumably and more precisely, the misinterpretation of what a monetary\nunion means for the pricing of credit risk. We suspect that an underpricing of credit\nrisk unduly eased financing conditions and fostered cross-border flows. Thereby,\nforeign banks could fund themselves in the converging EMU financial market, for\nexample, by interbank borrowing or by issuing bank securities.5\nFinancing conditions considerably eased with the start of the monetary union\nin EMU countries, because there was no exchange rate risk any more inside EMU\nand market participants also decreased their pricing of credit risk, last but not\nleast, because they did not believe in the no bail-out clause of the EU treaty. This\nexpectation, however, can change rapidly. Two examples support this evidence.\nFor short-term funding in the euro area the spreads between rates for collateralized\nand uncollateralized interbank transactions (as measured, for example, by Euribor\n5Not only banks but also special purpose vehicles (SPVs) funded themselves abroad. When\nthe access of SPVs to capital markets deteriorated, banks bought the securities issued by \"their\"\nSPVs and thereby assumed the risk formerly held off balance sheet.\n- Eurepo 3M-spreads) is a proxy for the price of credit risk, which banks consider\nas a benchmark. The average spread measured in basis points remained in single\ndigits pre-crisis and presumably, banks only added very small margins in order\nto price the individual credit risk of their counterparties. During the crisis, how-\never, the spread swiftly reached three digit numbers and many banks drastically\ndecreased credit limits to counterparties indicating that this funding source not\nonly dried up due to lower demand at higher rates but also due to credit rationing.\nThough the average spread has declined again, market participants may expect\nthat spreads will never return to their low pre-crisis level.\nSecond, spreads of sovereign bond yields serve as a benchmark for longer term\nfinancing in the financial market and for indicating sovereign credit risk. The\nspreads of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish 10-year-government bond yields to\nGerman bunds, for example, averaged at about 400 basis points in the mid-1990s6,\nbefore they rapidly converged to a much lower level in the run-up to the monetary\nunion. During monetary union, but pre-crisis, a period which in retrospective is\noften called the honey moon, the spreads averaged at lower double digit numbers\nuntil the collapse of Lehman in September 2008. During the European sovereign\ndebt crisis they increased rapidly to levels of the mid-1990s again or even higher.\nStarting from mid 2012 spreads declined rapidly within a few months, which some\nrelate to Draghi's famous \"whatever it takes\" speech and the following OMT-\nannouncement of the European Central Bank, though spreads in retail interest\nrates remain elevated compared to Germany and other so called \"core countries\".\nGiven the fact that the pricing of credit risk in the euro area is drastically\nre-adjusted whenever market sentiments change, the market for pricing credit risk\nmay not always efficiently deal with information and reflect it in the price imme-\nThe behavior of banks in Germany also changed with the developments of fi-\nnancing conditions in the monetary union. As shown in Figure 3 (lower plot)\ntheir net foreign assets to abroad and denominated in domestic currency surged to\n7Behavioral finance has supplemented the efficient market hypothesis and recognizes that\nindividuals neither are able to process the full set of information at the same time nor evalu-\nate it systematically and rationally as assumed by the extremely strict assumptions of a homo\neconomicus, see Barberis and Thaler (2003) for a survey.\neuro during the decade before the start of the monetary union. The develop-\nment was mainly driven by increasing assets towards EMU countries, in particular\nSouthern European countries, though the latest developments are heavily influ-\nenced by changes in liabilities to Britain. Net foreign assets denominated in Euro\nhave halved again since they peaked in 2008. The crisis has heightened the risk\nawareness of banks and suddenly changed financing conditions. Accumulated trade\nsurpluses, however, continue, because funding from the Eurosystem partly substi-\ntuted the lack of funding from sources in the private sector. Large and diverging\nTARGET balances at national central banks in the Eurosystem are a symptom\nof this asymmetric provision of central bank liquidity in the Eurosystem and sig-\nnal an alternative reaction to sudden stops of private capital inflows than sharp\nexchange rate depreciations.8\nWe conclude that the start of the monetary union greatly facilitated financing in\nEMU countries, which fostered domestic credit booms in some of them and export\nbooms in others, namely in Germany. This contributed to the gap between GDP\ngrowth and credit growth in Germany. Credit of foreign banks to foreign non-banks\ncreates money that finances trade between Germany and its export destinations\nand that eventually increases wealth of exporting firms. Assuming that (at least\npart of) the wealth is held on accounts at banks in Germany, the banks receive\nadditional funding via the export revenues of their customers, which they can\ninvest abroad. Pre-crisis, increasing net foreign assets of banks in Germany have\nrefinanced foreign credit expansion and have contributed to the easing of financing\nconditions. This has been partly substituted by public cross border claims, i.e.\nTARGET balances of the Bundesbank, during the crisis. Generally speaking,\ncredit still creates money, though it is not necessarily domestic credit that creates\n8The start of the monetary union is just one of many factors influencing structural changes\nin the banking sector. In an environment of decreasing levels of interest rates in developed\neconomies, stronger de-regulation and higher competition in the financial sector, the tradi-\ntional sources of banks' earnings from interest business, became unsatisfactory and were grad-\nually substituted by banks' earnings from commission business and own account trading. The\nstart of the monetary union offered new profit opportunities of banks that were increasingly\nput under pressure from these structural developments. Additionally, some special develop-\nments at Landesbanks, such as the lifting of state guarantees, which eventually took place in\nmid 2005, for ensuring the institutions' solvency (Anstaltslast) and for indemnifying depositors\n(Gew\u00a8\nahrtr\u00a8\nagerhaftung) triggered large scale issuance of bank securities shortly before and a cor-\nresponding search for yield for the new funding, which was increasingly taking place in EMU\ncountries.\nNorth HHs North Govt.

The\neasing of financing conditions, higher net foreign assets of banks in Germany and\nstronger foreign credit creation reinforced each other. Eventually, it should be kept\nin mind that the strongly changing price for credit risk lies at the heart of these\ndevelopments and could be based on a misperception of the financial sector that\nyet has not found a fundamental value.\n5 A Small Two-Country Model\nThe goal of the current section is to demonstrate how the negative short-run\nlink between output and credit in the presence of export trade surpluses outlined\nabove can be resembled even in the context of a simplistic stock-flow consistent\nmodel. For this purpose we adopt a slightly changed version of the model OPEN\nintroduced by Godley and Lavoie (2007) in their section 6.6. The model OPEN\ncomprises four economic sectors and two countries. The sectors are households,\nproducers, government and central bank. The countries trade with each other.\nHowever, due to the assumption of two different currencies the central banks hold\ngold reserves which enable import transactions. If the trade is not balanced, the\ncountry with trade deficit loses gold reserves and the one with trade surpluses\naccumulates them. The unbalanced trade can continue as long as the central\nbank of the deficit country is willing or able to provide gold reserves for import\ntransactions.\nFor our purposes we abandon the assumption of two currencies, but maintain\nthe framework of two countries with two central banks, which allows to mimic\nthe institutional setup of the Eurozone to some extent. Bearing in mind that\nin our simplistic model the domestic banking system is amalgamated with the\ncentral bank, the trade deficits are financed by incurring net foreign liabilities\nin domestic currency. Inside the model this process can continue ad infinitum\nwhile the system approches a non-stationary steady-state, since no endogenous\nstabilising mechanisms are considered forcing both countries towards a balanced\ntrade path. Cross border transactions between the two countries are settled by\nchanges in net foreign positions at their balance sheets. In contrast to gold, which\nis the international means of payments in section 6.6 of Godley and Lavoie (2007),\nincreasing net foreign assets of the trade surplus country are financial assets with a\nliability as their counterpart and are not limited by physical quantity. We outline\nthe main equations and features of the model. For a more detailed treatment of\npost-keynesian models Godley and Lavoie (2007) is probably the best reference\navailable currently.\nFirst, consider the balance sheet matrix of the model, which is presented in\nTable 2. The balance sheet matrix comprises of a nothern and southern part,\nhowever, due to their analogy and in order to save the space only the northern part\nis put into the table. The households allocate their wealth in non-interest-bearing\ndeposits and interest-bearing bills. The bills are issued by the government. The\ncentral bank purchases government bills and injects high powered money (assumed\nin forms of deposits) into the economy. If the corresponding country runs trade\nsurpluses, the central bank accumulates net foreign assets. In case of trade deficit\nnet foreign liabilities are accumulated. Finally, the household wealth is the sum\nof government bills and net foreign assets.\nTable 3 contains the transaction matrix for the northern country, however, all\ncolumns sum to zero only if the southern part is considered as well. In partic-\nular, northern exports and imports correspond to southern imports and exports\nrespectively. The same holds for net foreign assets and liabilities. Government\nexpenditures constitute the core of the model and correspond to autonomous con-\nsumption in models without government sector, since G = 0 implies that all other\nmodel variables converge to zero as well. The government finances expenditures\nprimarly by taxes. The recurrent fiscal deficits are firstly covered by selling bills to\nhouseholds. If households do not demand the required amount of bills, they will be\npurchased by the central bank. This is how new money is injected into monetary\ncircuit of the model. If the government runs fiscal surpluses or households demand\nmore bills than needed, the government liabilities to the central bank are settled\nHHs Prod. Govt. CB N\nConsumption -CN +CN 0\nGovt.

This is how the money is brought out of the circuit and destructed.\nAll model equations are adopted from Godley and Lavoie (2007) and are doc-\numented in the appendix. We need only four behavioral equation for the model\nclosure: consumption function, import and tax function and portfolio decision\nfunction. The households hold non-interest-bearing deposits because of the trans-\naction motive. In order to keep the setup as simple as possible the north and the\nsouth posses equal model coefficients but the import prospensities:\nMi = \u00b5iY i. (6)\nIf \u00b5N = \u00b5S, the trade is balanced and the system reaches a stationary steady-state\nwith zero fiscal deficit and zero level of net foreign assets and liabilities, since\nNFAN = XN - MN . (7)\nIf \u00b5N > \u00b5S, the north runs trade and fiscal surpluses, which is offset by equal trade\nand fiscal deficits in the south, since government expenditures are exogenous. Due\nto fiscal surplus the northern government pays back its debt to the central bank.\nFirst, the balance sheet size of the northern central bank remains constant since\nthe diminishing stock of bills on the assets side is offset by the growing stock\nof net foreign assets, see Figure 7. An asset swap takes place so that the balance\nsheet size of the central bank in the north remains stationary in the non-stationary\nsteady-state. If the stock of bills is depleted on the asset side, increasing net foreign\nassets and increasing government deposits, which are negative holdings of bills at\nthe central bank, lead to balance sheet growth.\nSurpluses of the north correspond to deficits in the south financed by issuing\nnew central bank money. Since the stock of bills owned by households converges to\na constant level, the central bank purchases additional bills permanently and the\nasset side of its balance sheet expands. On the liabilities side the growing stock\nof bills is compensated by growing net foreign liabilities (Figure 7) while the stock\nof money remains stationary. Hence, the non-stationary steady-state in the south\nleads to non-stationary balance sheet growth of the banking system.\nOur simulation exercise starts from a stationary steady-state, where all co-\nefficient in the north equals to the southern coefficients. Since the government\nexpenditures levels are also identical, all model variables converges to same levels\nimport prospensity of the south, \u00b5S\n, is increased carrying the system to a new\nnon-stationary steady-state. However, all model variables exept the stock of gov-\nernment bills (Bi), the stock of government bills purchased by the central bank\n(Bi\ncb\n) and the net foreign assets (NFAi) remain stationary, see Figures 5 and 6\nogenously reduced for a period of two years, while the government expenditures\nin the north remain constant. Subsequently this shock causes transitory output\nlosses in both countries. The households also reduce their holdings of bills and\nnon-interest-bearing deposits adjusting the lower GDP level. Nevertheless, the\ngovernment debt in the north reacts in the exactly opposite way - it is increasing.\nThe reason for this negative relation between government indebtness and output in\nthe north is the exogeneity of government expenditure. Since GN remains constant\nwhile export revenues are falling due to weaker import demand in the south, the\nnorthern fiscal balance switches into negative area and the government is forced\nto finance its expenditures by issuing new bills.\nWe bear in mind that the central bank can be considered as a proxy for the\nwhole domestic banking system in our simplistic monetary circiut. It is also rea-\nsonable to view the government and producers as including also all private firms\nwhich have access to credit via government bills, where the taxes partly play the\nrole of retained profits. Under these assumption the analogy of our simple model\noutcome to the empircal findings stated above becomes obvious. Since the north-\nern firms expect the demand shock in the south to be transitory and as long as\nthey believe in their \"business strategy\", they react to the output decreases by\ngoing deeper into debt maintaining the necessary level of money in the monetary\ncircuit, which resembles the negative correlation between GDP and credit flow to\nthe non-bank firms in German data.\n6 Conclusions\nSince the turn of the millenium the pattern of money and credit changed in Ger-\nmany. Domestic credit did not drive \"domestic\" money, or more precisely, the\nnational contribution to euro area money. We argue that the start of the mone-\ntary union had an impact as it triggered an easing of financing conditions, which\nfacilitated credit booms abroad and current account surpluses in Germany. Ger-\nman export firms demand less domestic credit and finance higher production from\nretained profits, when export revenues are high. Foreign credit to foreign non-\nbanks developed as an important source of financing for trade surpluses and GDP\ngrowth and contributed to the gap between GDP growth and credit growth in Ger-\nmany. Increasing net foreign assets of banks in Germany have refinanced foreign\ncredit expansion and thereby, fostered the easing of financing conditions. During\nthe crisis, though, this has been partly substituted by public cross border claims,\ni.e. TARGET balances of the Bundesbank. The experience of credit, GDP growth\nand current account surpluses in Germany supports the fact that export surpluses\nare not an imbalance of savings and investment, but rather an imbalance of fi-\nnancing and investment. The financing of credit booms abroad may fuel further\neasing of financing conditions. Financing conditions channel the flow of credit and\ndepend on the risk awareness of market participants. Keeping in mind that the\npricing of credit risk may be less efficient than commonly believed, credit creation\nmay also be suboptimal. Thus, the question remains whether the new paradigm\nof money and credit will be sustainable. Can countries, which maintain ongoing\nsurpluses in their trade balances, achieve much the same objective of enhancing\ntheir economic growth and employment as long as they ensure that their debtors\ncan finance their trade deficit (see Kaldor 1978)? Answers probably lie beyond\npure economic reasoning.\nReferences\nBarberis, N. and R. Thaler (2003). A survey of behavioral finance, in G. M.\nConstantinides, M. Harris and R. Stulz (eds.)
