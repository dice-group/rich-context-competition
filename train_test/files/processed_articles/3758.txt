Varese\nof definitions of organised crime have started to include the\nterm `network'(p. 7). At the same time, formal network anal-\nysis techniques are being used more and more to study inter-\nactions among offenders. Social network analysis (SNA), as\nmaintained by Bouchard and Amirault (2013), has finally\n`taken root in the field of criminology' (p. 199; see also\n(2011) has pointed out that we may be witnessing the `com-\ning of a networked criminology' (p. 101).\nHowever, some ambiguity around key concepts still\nremains, starting from the very same notion of `network': is\nit a specific form of organisation or just a collection of actors\nand ties? Are these two perspectives on networks invariably\nintertwined or can we apply social network techniques while\nrejecting the notion of networks as a distinct form of organi-\nsation? To shore up the foundations of criminal network\nresearch, it is vital to fully address this ambiguity. In addi-\ntion, while the number of articles devoted to the study of\ncriminal networks has undoubtedly increased in the recent\npast, a large proportion of them still remains descriptive in\nexplanatory research in the field by offering some remarks\non selected critical issues related to the study of criminal\nnetworks.\nThis work starts by discussing two different perspectives\non networks while examining the implications for criminolo-\ngists (Section `Conceptualising social (and criminal) net-\nworks'). Ultimately, this article favours an instrumental\napproach to networks, interpreted as a collection of actors\nand ties, and regards it as the most fruitful strategy to foster\nexplanation in criminal network research. This approach,\nhowever, is not without its pitfalls: the section, `Potential pit-\nfalls in criminal network research', will explore the dangers\nof an over-reliance on structural measures. Finally, the sec-\ntion, `Explanation in criminal network research: The use of\nQAP regression models', will discuss a viable strategy to\nassess the determinants of criminal networks, and explaining\nwhy a given network is structured in the way we have\nExplaining criminal networks: Strategies\nand potential pitfalls\nPaolo Campana\n Keywords\nCriminal networks, explanation, pitfalls, quadratic assignment procedure, social network analysis\nInstitute of Criminology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK\nCorresponding author:\nPaolo Campana, Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge,\nSidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DA, UK.\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\nobserved. This strategy is based on the use of a Quadratic\nAssignment Procedure (QAP) regression method.\nFinally, two caveats: first, this article mainly focuses on\nthe study of criminal networks defined as `the organisation\nthus leaving aside other possible applications of network\nanalysis relevant to criminologist, for instance the study of\nhow personal networks may influence crime and delinquency\n(for an insightful review of the latter, see Carrington, 2011:\n236\u00ad243). Second, the aim of this article is not to present an\npelling and comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art\nresearch in the field.\nConceptualising social (and criminal)\nnetworks\nOn the face of it, one might be tempted to regard the question\nof what a network is as a trivial one. However, at least for\nresearchers interested in explaining the organisation of crim-\ninal activities, the answer is far from unambiguous. Broadly\nspeaking, there are two distinct ways of conceptualising net-\nworks. One perspective, which can be defined as `substan-\ntive', interprets networks as a specific form of organisation.\nThe second perspective, which can be regarded as `instru-\nmental', defines networks as based on the presence of two\nconstitutive sets of elements: actors (nodes) and relation-\nships (ties). This dualism is a long-standing source of ambi-\nguity and misunderstanding among scholars and practitioners\n(2010: 8) have highlighted the tension between the substan-\ntive perspective and the instrumental one in the context of\ncriminal networks. Given the increasing popularity of net-\nworks in criminological research, it is vital to discuss this\ndualism at some length. In addition, the adoption of a sub-\nstantive rather than an instrumental approach has a direct\nimpact on the extent to which we can perform explanatory\nresearch in the context of criminal networks. I will now\nexamine the defining characteristics of both perspectives.\nNetworks as a form of organisation\nThe idea of conceptualising networks as a distinct form of\norganisation arose in opposition to the `conventional' view\nthat identifies only two possible forms of coordination\namong economic actors: market and hierarchy (Podolny and\nback to the seminal work of Ronald Coase, The Nature of the\nputs forward the idea that production, and by extension eco-\nnomic exchange, can be coordinated in two alternative ways:\n(1) through the price mechanism that underpins transactions\nin the market or (2) through the decisions of an entrepreneur\nwho directs production within a firm (hierarchy). Coase's\nideas gained prominence in the Seventies when Oliver\nWilliamson put them at the basis of the new transaction cost\neconomics to explain coordination and governance of eco-\nyears, the original dichotomy has been reinterpreted\nas a continuum to capture hybrid forms of governance,\nfor instance long-term contracting (see, for example,\nWilliamson, 2005: 7). However, this continuum remains\nfirmly anchored in the market vs. hierarchy framework.\nOrganisational scholars and sociologists have challenged\nthe premises of the Coase-Williamson framework by sug-\ngesting the presence of a third, separate, mode of exchange:\nthe network. According to Powell (1990), the continuum\nsuggested by Williamson is still `too quiescent and mechani-\ncal' (p. 299); by `sticking to the twin pillars of markets and\nhierarchies, our attention is deflected from a diversity of\norganizational designs that are neither fish nor fowl, nor\nsome mongrel hybrid, but a distinctly different form'\n(p. 299). He then suggested a third form of organisation,\nnamely the network, defined in the following way:\nNetworks are `lighter on their feet' than hierarchies. In network\nmodes of resource allocation, transactions occur neither through\ndiscrete exchanges nor by administrative fiat, but through\nnetworks of individuals engaged in reciprocal, preferential,\nmutually supportive actions. Networks can be complex: they\ninvolve neither the explicit criteria of the market, nor the familiar\nPodolny and Page (1998) offer a more formal definition\nof `network' as a distinct form of organisation:\nWe define a network form of organization as any collection of\nactors (N 2) that pursue repeated, enduring exchange relations\nwith one another and, at the same time, lack a legitimate\norganizational authority to arbitrate and resolve dispute that may\narise during the exchange. (p. 59)\nOne of the defining characteristics of the network form of\norganisation is trust. According to Podolny and Page (1998),\na `more trusting ethic' makes the network `not reducible to a\nhybridization of market and hierarchical forms, which, in\ncontrast, are premised on a more adversarial posture' (p. 61).\nScholars in criminology have also embraced the concept\nof network to describe a (supposedly) new mode of operation\nadopted by criminals as well as terrorists. This `emerging'\norganisational form is believed to pose a `new' threat to the\nsecurity of states (Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 2001). For exam-\nple, Williams (2001) maintains that `there is a growing rec-\nognition that organized crime is increasingly operating\nthrough fluid network structures rather than more formal\nhierarchies' (p. 62). He points out that `networks are one of\nthe most common forms of social organization. They are\nsimultaneously pervasive and intangible, ubiquitous and\nAccording to Williams (2001), networks are `an ideal form\nfor organizing criminal activities' (p. 64) as they possess a\nnumber of characteristics that makes them particularly\nappealing to criminals: they are flexible and dynamic (p. 67);\nthey are able to limit the exposure to risks as networks pos-\nsess limited fixed assets and higher adaptation than hierar-\nchies (p. 74); and they allow the formation of flexible\nalliances among criminals as well as between criminals and\ncorrupt individuals (p. 77\u00ad80). Practitioners too have\nembraced the `new' network paradigm and have started to\nadopt the network form of organisation in their description of\nthe underworld. For instance, the latest Serious and Organised\nCrime Threat Assessment compiled by Europol (2013),\nexplicitly states that `it appears that criminal groups increas-\ningly employ network forms of organisation and behaviour'\n(Europol, 2013: 33). Yet, the popularity of a substantive net-\nwork perspective in the study of the organisation of criminal\nactivities has not always been matched with a thorough\nreflection on the limits of such an approach. While, accord-\ning to a number of scholars, the network form of organisation\nappears to be able to capture the essence of contemporary\ncriminal endeavours (see, among others, Castells, 2000: ch.\n3; Williams, 2001), a closer scrutiny of real-world evidence\nreveals a different picture.\nInterpreting networks as a form of organisation rules out\nthe possibility of looking at hierarchies through the network\nlens. This is indeed very limiting. As pointed out by Varese\n(2010), `hierarchies too are networks' and ultimately `any\norganization can be thought of as a network-based social sys-\ntem' (p. 13). Varese (2013) compellingly shows the potential\nof analysing the connections between members of a hierar-\nchical organisation through a network approach (in this case\nit was a Russian Mafia group). By reconstructing the infor-\nmal patterns of interaction, one can derive the structure of\nhierarchical organisations from the ground (Varese 2010,\nbility to develop formal models to assess the determinants of\nthese interactions as well as their change over time; crucially,\nthis can also be carried out in relation to hierarchies\ntion, `Explanation in criminal network research: The use of\nQAP regression models').\nFurthermore, not only organisations with an established\nhierarchy will be out of our reach, but the very same forms of\norganisation that are neither market nor hierarchy may,\nindeed, fall outside the conceptual domain of a substantive\napproach to networks. For instance, Campana (2015) pre-\nsents a study of a transnational Nigerian human trafficking\nring. The study shows that the ring under scrutiny does not\npossess an established hierarchy that is in control of all the\nactivities, while being neither completely flat nor `fluid'. In\nother words, this ring is neither a classic example of hierar-\nchy nor just a host of market-based transactions. However,\nthe formal definition of the network form of organisation\ngiven by Podolny and Page (1998), or the one given by\nPowell (1990), seems unable to capture the dynamics\nobserved in this ring. For instance, the majority of the key\nactors did not pursue repeated and enduring exchange rela-\ntions with one another, that is, a defining property of the net-\nwork form of organisation as interpreted by Podolny and\nPage (1998). Yet, this was not a completely flat ring as some\ndegree of centralised coordination was indeed detected. In\nother words, a substantive approach to networks offers very\nlimited analytical help; on the contrary, a continuum between\nmarket and hierarchy seems to capture reality much better.\nFinally, the stress on trust as a constitutive element of the\nis hard to reconcile with the reality of the Nigerian traffick-\ning ring or, indeed, the underworld more generally. As docu-\nmented by Campana and Varese (2013), trust is often in\nscarce supply among law-breakers (see also McCarthy et al.,\nContrary to the received wisdom that sees the network\nform of organisation as `pervasive' and `ubiquitous'\nsuch an approach is indeed very limiting and often hard to\nreconcile with real-world manifestations of criminal endeav-\nours. It is precisely because our object of study is situated on\nan extended continuum ranging, as noted by Morselli (2009:\n1), from `a one-time partnership to execute a criminal ven-\nture' to a `bureaucratic-like infrastructure that demands and\nenforces exclusivity on the actions and productivity of mem-\nbers' that we need a radically different approach to the study\nof criminal networks. This article argues that the alternative\napproach discussed below is better-suited to fully grasp the\nmechanisms underpinning the organisation of criminal activ-\nities, and places us in a better position to test hypotheses on\nthe formation of ties in criminal networks. Ultimately, as\n\"slow moving\" or \"quick on its feet\" is an empirical question\nrather than a theoretical premise or assumption'. Structure\nshould be empirically reconstructed rather than assumed\nThe instrumental perspective on networks\nRather than a distinct form of organisation, networks can be\nconceptualised as based on the presence of two distinct sets\nof entities: actors (nodes) and relationships (ties). Wasserman\na finite set or sets of actors and the relation or relations defined\nSimilarly, Robins (2015) defines a social network as `a set\nof social actors and a relationship among them in the form of\ndyadic relational ties' (p. 18, emphasis in the original). Within\nthe broad domain of networks, `social networks are impor-\ntantly distinctive in one major regard: the actors in the network\nhave intentionality'(Robins, 2015: 5, emphasis in the original).\nBy and large, this is an instrumental perspective on networks.\n4 Methodological Innovations\nAs pointed out by Borgatti et al. (2013), networks are `a way of\nthinking about social systems that focuses our attention on the\nrelationships among the entities that make up the system, which\nwe call actors and nodes' (p. 1). This perspective is commonly\nreferred to as Social Network Analysis (SNA).\nSNA offers a set of conceptual tools and analytic proce-\ndures that allows researchers to first collect and systematise\nevidence in a relational way and then use the same evidence\nto test substantive hypotheses. When interpreted in this way,\nthe concept of networks thus `provides us with a way of\nviewing social relations. It is not a theory of society, though\nthe builders of theories will have to take such networks into\napproach to data collection, we are in a position to gather\nevidence on both actors and ties in a network, including the\nattributes of both entities (actors and ties). In very simple\nterms, the most basic unit of analysis is the dyad `Actor-Tie-\nevidence has been collected, one can then run joint analyses\nof actors and ties (for a comprehensive discussion of SNA,\nAn instrumental approach to networks has been applied to\nthe study of a number of different social phenomena, from\noccupational mobility to research on communities, groups,\nmarkets and organisations (Wasserman and Faust, 1994: 6).\nYet, the broad reach of this approach has come under criti-\ncism. For instance, the definition of `network' upon which it\nis premised has been regarded as a `loose definition, desig-\nnating nothing more than a set of interlinked elements that\nability to encompass a vast variety of organisational forms,\nincluding both markets and hierarchies, has been interpreted\nThompson, 2003). A second, related, criticism that has been\nformulated is that SNA is an empirically driven approach\nthat lacks a structural model for the explanation of the phe-\ndifferent view, and contends that what may be perceived as a\nweakness is in reality a strength. For example, by not assum-\ning a structure a priori, it is possible to test hypotheses on the\nmechanisms that have brought about that very same struc-\nture. Network analysis can indeed be combined with one or\nmore substantive theories of network processes, such as pref-\nerential attachment, structural balance, social selection and\nMore generally, SNA achieves its full potential when it is\nmatched with substantive, theory-driven, research questions\nflate the network approach with any prior assumption about\nthe structure of a network, as the `network model' of organi-\nsation would require. For instance, as suggested by Von\nwithin organisational theory can find an answer using a net-\nwork analysis approach.\nIn criminology, a network analysis approach to the study of\norganised criminal activities has been fruitfully adopted by an\nincreasing number of scholars. Among the most recent works,\nMafia group; Campana and Varese (2013) to the comparative\nstudy of cooperation within a Russian and an Italian mafia\nexplore drug trafficking. Calderoni and Piccardi (2014) have\napplied a specific community detection algorithm (indeed, a\nnetwork analysis technique) to reconstruct the structure of a\nMafia organisation based on the attendance of its associates to\nmeetings that were monitored by the police. Morselli (2014)\noffers an insightful collection of studies that have adopted a\nnetwork approach to investigate a number of criminal phe-\nnomena, including the evolution of a drug co-arrest network\n(Iwanski and Frank, 2014), homophily effects among co-\noffenders (Van Mastrigt and Carrington, 2014), the core mem-\nbership of a youth gang (Bouchard and Konarski, 2014), drug\ntorical networks such as that established by Al Capone in\nChicago during the Prohibition era (Papachristos and Smith,\n2014). Earlier pioneering works using formal network models\nUltimately, the instrumental approach to networks (SNA)\ndoes not assume the existence of any structure a priori, but\nderives it from the evidence collected in a relational way\nVarese 2012). This makes such an approach rather appealing,\nand well-suited to test hypotheses on the mechanisms that\nmay have brought about the structure observed. However,\nthis approach is not without its drawbacks, and I will now\nturn to discuss some possible perils.\nPotential pitfalls in criminal network\nresearch\nThis section briefly touches upon a selection of issues that\nmay arise when adopting an instrumental approach (SNA) to\nthe study of criminal networks.\nDangers related to data collection\nInevitably, an instrumental approach to social networks is\nhighly sensitive to the quality of the data collected. As with\nany network data, criminal network data is subject to a num-\nber of threats to validity and reliability. These include the\nincorrect attribution of characteristics of nodes and ties, and\nerrors in data mining and in secondary sources (Borgatti\ntrary to non-network approaches, a random sampling may\nseverely distort inferences when a network is clustered\nspecification problems and issues of missing data can also be\nThese threats are inherent to all network data; however, the\nspecific nature of criminal behaviour may exacerbate the\nimpact of some of them. For instance, missing data, i.e.,\npotential missing nodes or ties, can pose a very serious issue\nto the validity of criminal network data; external validity\nprocedures should therefore be adopted to double-check the\nevidence extracted from a given source (Campana and\npolice investigations, Campana and Varese (2012) suggest\nperforming external validity checks based on information\nextracted from additional court and law enforcement files,\ninterviews with key informants and other open source\nrecords. Whenever possible, an internal validity control (i.e.\ninternal to the same source) should also be carried out, for\nexample by contrasting the information extracted from the\ncontent of the tapped phone calls with the metadata related to\nthe same set of conversations. Ultimately, the coverage of a\nspecific source of network data should be carefully and criti-\ncally scrutinised by researchers using all available contextual\nevidence.\nAn additional problem relates to the identification of the\nboundaries of a given network (Kossinets, 2006; Laumann\net al., 1989). This is a key issue in network analysis, and it is\narguably exacerbated in the case of criminal networks. This\nis due, for instance, to the lack of an accessible membership\nlist according to which nodes can be included in a network.\nIn addition, the boundary-specification problem may become\neven more acute when networks are composed of largely\nindependent actors carrying out market-based transactions\nand the boundary-specification problem have a direct impact\non network measures, as the latter tends to be largely depend-\nent on the structure of the network as a whole (Robins, 2015:\nthe impact of missing data and boundary-specification on\nreal-world criminal networks.\ncritically assess the different sources of data that are avail-\nable within the justice system, and the potential biases that\neach may include. The work of Campana (2015) shows\nthat, when only an incomplete or not sufficiently reliable\nset of `1-mode' network ties is available, researchers could\nadopt a `2-mode'data collection strategy to minimise biases\narising from coverage and boundary-specification prob-\nlems. A typical `2-mode' coding strategy would generate a\nnetwork based on a series of events and the actors (nodes)\nassociated with them. In summary, structural measures can\nbe subject to biases due to errors, sampling procedures,\nboundary-specification problems and missing data.\nHowever, even structural measures that are not biased can\nstill pose a challenge for researchers, particularly in rela-\ntion to their interpretation.\nAdditional dangers in the interpretation of\nnetwork data\nStructural measures are indeed a very useful tool to investi-\ngate criminal network data. However, an over-reliance on\nstructural measures alone without an adequate grasp of the\ncontext may lead to ambiguous or, worse still, misleading\nconclusions. If taken out of context, even simple statistics\nsuch as degree centrality, that is, the number of ties that an\nactor exchanges with the other actors in the network, may be\nrather ambiguous. Ambiguity can manifest itself in a number\nof ways that are worth discussing at some length.\nCentrality measures are arguably among the most com-\nmon statistical measures that researchers and practitioners\nalike calculate on criminal network data (for a formal discus-\nsion of centrality measures, see Wasserman and Faust, 1994:\nch. 5). While the idea behind most of these measures \u00ad par-\nticularly degree centrality \u00ad is relatively straightforward,\ntheir interpretation is not always without challenges. Let us\ntake degree centrality as an example. A high level of degree\ncentrality is usually taken as an indication of prominence of\na given actor. Conversely, a low level of degree centrality is\ncommonly associated with peripheral actors. The latter are\noften interpreted as performing less important roles in a net-\nwork. This may indeed hold true for many networks; how-\never, this is not necessarily the case for all networks. To\nillustrate this point, I now turn to some additional analysis of\nThe network under scrutiny includes 58 actors, of which\n25 are offenders and 33 are victims. Figure 1 presents the\ndistribution of degree centrality for the 25 offenders.1 In this\nnetwork, degree centrality indicates the level of participation\nin trafficking activities by each individual. Two actors imme-\ndiately stand out as the most central players (#1 and #2); a\nthird offender (#4) also scores relatively high. Then, the\nindex quickly drops and we observe a rather large number of\nperipheral actors (a core group of three offenders was also\nidentified by a core-periphery algorithm). Based on this fig-\nure, one would be tempted to conclude that the key players\nare only Actor #1, #2 and #4. The reality, however, is more\ncomplex.\nFigure 1. Human trafficking network: degree centrality by actor.\n6 Methodological Innovations\nBased on the content of the phone conversations wire-\ntapped and other evidence included in the court files, four\ndistinct roles where identified: management, resource acqui-\nsition, escorting of victims (`trolley') and the so-called `mad-\nams', typically former prostitutes turned into traffickers (for\na full description, see Campana, 2015). On average, `mad-\nams' present the lowest degree centrality in the network.2\nShould we therefore conclude that they also have a marginal\nrole in the trafficking ring?\nIf we base our judgement on structural measures only,\nthe answer will be in the affirmative. However, the content\nof the phone conversations and other evidence extracted\nfrom the court files tell us that this is not the case. In fact, it\nwas the `madams' who were generating the demand for the\ntrafficking services that were then supplied by the individu-\nals coded as `management' (Actor #1 and #2 are included in\nthis category). Indeed, the `managers' were in charge of the\ntransportation of victims from Nigeria to Europe, and in\nthis respect they played an important role. Nonetheless,\nthey worked as contractors hired by the `madams'. The low\ndegree centrality of `madams' is explained by the fact that\nthey were largely independent of each other and of the\nother offenders (each tie in this network records the co-\nparticipation of two offenders in a given trafficking event).\nYet, by no means are they marginal players in the ring;\nquite the opposite is true: they can be considered as key\nplayers (see Campana, 2015 for additional details on the\nmodus operandi of the network).\nWhat is crucial to stress here is that the presence of a tie is\nnot the only important feature of a criminal network; the\nabsence of a tie can be equally telling. Understanding the\nreasons why an actor has not established a given tie with\nanother actor can be very informative (provided, of course,\nthat this was not due to missing data). For this reason, one\nneeds to complement structural measures with additional\n(often qualitative) evidence to have a full grasp of the mech-\nanisms at play.\nMore generally, a joint analysis of the structure and con-\ntent of criminal connections has been advocated by Campana\nures and a systematic coding of the orders given by each\nactor to empirically test to what extent the Russian Mafia\ngroup under scrutiny could be considered `flat' or hierarchi-\ncally structured. Similarly, Calderoni (2012) includes both\nstructural measures and measures of `status' in his analysis\nof two Mafia organisations involved in drug trafficking.\nWestlake et al. (2011: 11) have applied a formal model devel-\noped by Schwartz and Rouselle (2009) to identify key play-\ners in an online child exploitation network; their model\ncombines a measure of the resources available to each actor\nwith measures of cohesion of the network as well as the\nstrength of the relationships between actors. Instead of a\ntask-based approach, Carley et al. (2002) have suggested tak-\ning the cognitive abilities of each actor into consideration in\norder to identify potential `leaders'. In their view, leaders\nmay or may not be the central nodes in a network.3\nIn addition, based on the idea that `centrality comes in\nthe joint distribution of different centrality measures. For\ninstance, Morselli (2010) has looked at a joint distribution of\ndegree and betweenness centrality in order to identify differ-\nent types of individual positioning within criminal networks.\nHis work has shown that the individual positioning had an\nimpact on the likelihood of arrest in the case of a Hells\nAngels group based in Canada: actors with high betweenness\ncentrality but low degree centrality were less likely to be\nTo summarise, both the presence and the absence of a tie\ncan equally represent an important feature of a given net-\nwork. Up to this point, the article has focussed on the analy-\nsis of a single network. In reality, people, and indeed\noffenders, may share a multiplicity of ties (see, for example,\nfor instance financial transactions, and non-economic, such\nas kinship.4 To gain a full grasp of the mechanisms at play,\none can model multiple networks simultaneously in a fash-\nion similar to regression models. I will now discuss a possi-\nble strategy of doing so that is particularly well-suited to the\nanalysis of criminal network data.\nExplanation in criminal network\nresearch: the use of QAP regression\nmodels\nCarrington (2011) has aptly noted that research on criminal\nnetworks `tends to be exploratory and descriptive rather than\ntheory-testing' (p. 244); for the most part, `it seeks to give a\n(literally) graphic account of the structure of the network\nbeing studied' (p. 248). This has been reiterated by\nthere have been some interesting developments in teasing\nout possible factors that may lead to the disruption of crimi-\nnal networks. Bichler and Malm (2015) include an informed,\nup-to-date, collection of works spelling out strategies to pre-\nventing crime by applying SNA to the study of various forms\nof organised crime and terrorism (on the structural differ-\nences between organised crime and terrorism due to their\ndistinct time-to-task requirement, see Morselli et al., 2007).\nYet, by and large, Carrington's observation still holds true.\nThere are a host of reasons that may account for the lim-\nited number of explanatory studies using criminal networks,\nincluding the difficulties in accessing good quality data (on\nfurther \u00ad yet crucial \u00ad complication lies with the very same\nnature of the data collected within a network framework.\nDue to their relational nature, network data violate the\nassumption of independence of observations upon which\nserious problem as significance tests commonly included in\nstandard statistical packages do assume independence of\nthat, when seeking to explain how a given structure has been\nbrought about (i.e. tie-formation), one cannot rely on the\nusual statistical tools. Yet, there are solutions to this problem\nas I briefly discuss below.\nQAP regression models\nThe use of QAP regression models to test hypotheses on the\norganisation of criminal activities has been largely over-\nlooked by criminologists. Nevertheless, these models may\nprove to be a very fruitful tool. QAP procedures offer a solu-\ntion to the problem of auto-correlation, or non-independence,\n1988). More specifically, QAP models are based on a family\nof procedures to perform a permutation-based nonparametric\ntest of statistical significance on network data (Dekker et al.,\nand the results can be interpreted in a similar way. In the case\nof a QAP regression, we typically regress a dependent net-\nwork matrix on two or more independent network matrices.\nRegression coefficients are estimated through an ordinary\nleast squares method (OLS). The major departure from a\nstandard regression model is constituted by the way the sig-\nnificance test for these coefficients is performed. In a nut-\nshell, a QAP procedure would create a number of randomly\nthat are a random rearrangement of the original one. To\ndetermine whether a regression coefficient is statistically\nsignificant, the procedure compares the observed coefficient\nagainst the distribution of the same coefficient calculated on\nthe randomly permuted matrices. If the observed coefficient\nis greater than 95per cent of the random coefficients, this is\nconsidered to be statistically significant at the 0.05 level (see\nEarlier approaches to permutation tests were confined to a\nHowever, progress has been made on how permutations are\nperformed and recently, thanks to the work of Dekker et al.\n(2007), a new permutation method has been proposed:\nDouble-Semi-Partialing (DSP). Dekker et al. (2007) have\nshown the DSP method to be reasonably robust in models in\nwhich the dependent variable is continuous or at least count-\nable integers (Poisson-like; for a formal description of the\nmethod, see Dekker et al., 2007).5 The appeal of QAP regres-\nsion models to criminologists lies in their ability to handle\nvalued networks as dependent variables. The implication is\nthat one can model the strength of contacts among offenders,\nfor example, based on the number of phone calls exchanged\nor meetings attended.6 Some basic conditions, however, need\nto be met in order for a QAP regression to be performed: all\nthe matrices need to be square and of the same size, and they\nall have to include exactly the same actors.7\npioneered the use of QAP models to test hypotheses using\nreal-world criminal network data. Campana and Varese\n(2013) have tested the impact of kinship and violence on fos-\ntering cooperation among criminals. They have interpreted\nboth devices as a way to establish credible commitments\namong offenders, thus situating their work in the broad lit-\nerature on cooperation in the absence of law and trust. They\ncollected data on contacts exchanged by members of two\nmafia organisations \u00ad a Russian Mafia group and a Neapolitan\nCamorra clan \u00ad and ran a series of QAP multiple regression\nmodels to estimate the impact on tie-formation of sharing\ninformation about violent acts and of sharing a kin-tie when\ncontrolling for other variables such as sharing the same task\nwithin the organisation. They have found evidence that both\nfactors, kinship and violence, enhance cooperation. In addi-\ntion, they have also discovered that violence has a much\ngreater impact than kinship even in groups made up of rela-\ntives. They have concluded that there is nothing ontological\nin the role of kinship in organised crime, and when better and\nmore reliable mechanisms to increase commitment are avail-\nable, criminals will resort to them, just as organisations in\nadvanced societies tend to rely on merit rather than kinship.\nCampana (2015) is a study of the organisation of human\ntrafficking. It relies on a novel, manually built, dataset\nrecording the co-participation of offenders in trafficking\nactivities between Nigeria and Europe (victims are also\nincluded in the dataset). It first elaborates a theoretical frame-\nwork to interpret trafficking activities based on Coase (1937)\nand the theory of agency, and then derives and tests a number\nof substantive hypotheses on the organisation of `high-\ncapacity' trafficking networks. The network under scrutiny\nshows a tendency towards a separation between different\nstages of the trafficking process as a strategy to decrease\nmonitoring costs and thus increase the overall `trafficking\ncapacity' of the ring. In addition, the study shows that even\nin networks that are not a unified organisation, there is still\nsome level of centralisation. Nonetheless, coordination sup-\nplied by the core group of offenders did not extend to all the\nstages of the trafficking process, but was mostly confined to\nthe transportation stage. Finally, a QAP regression model has\nalso shown that, contrary to a widely held belief, the traffick-\ning ring was not run along ethnic or family lines. Rather, a\nmore sophisticated model based on division of labour and\nrole specialisation was adopted by traffickers.\nThe QAP procedure presents some limitations. By per-\nforming random permutations on a matrix, it is able to cal-\nculate a significance test that is not biased by the\nnon-independence of observations; however, the types of\ndependence present in a given network are not directly mod-\nelled. In other words, it is not possible to estimate the impact\nof local network configurations on the global structure of a\nnetwork. Network processes such as reciprocity, local clo-\nsure or more complex forms of dependence cannot be mod-\nelled directly, and therefore a measure of their impact cannot\n8 Methodological Innovations\nbe estimated (for a formal discussion of different dependence\nassumptions, see Koskinen and Daraganova, 2013). To\nmodel structural configurations and actor-level attributes\nsimultaneously, one needs to adopt a different strategy, for\nexample, fitting an Exponential Random Graph Model\n(ERGM; for an excellent discussion on ERGMs, see Lusher\net al., 2013). To date, ERGMs have been mostly limited to\nbinary networks, and therefore used to predict the presence\nor absence of a tie, and not the strength of a relationship\nextend these models to valued networks are currently under\nway (see, for example, Krivitsky, 2012). In criminology,\nERGMs have recently been applied to test hypotheses using\nbinary networks in relation to intra-gang violence\n(Papachristos et al., 2013) and the role of ethnic homophily\nConclusion\nThis article has offered some remarks on a few critical issues\nrelated to explanation in criminal network research. It has\nfirst discussed two perspectives on networks, namely a sub-\nstantive approach that views networks as a distinct form of\norganisation, and an instrumental approach that interprets\nnetworks as a collection of nodes and attributes. The latter is\nat the basis of SNA. Ultimately, this article has argued\nagainst the conflation between the substantive and the\ninstrumental approach. It has contended that the instrumen-\ntal perspective (SNA) is the most productive strategy to fos-\nter explanation in criminal network research \u00ad in line with,\nCampana and Varese (2012). SNA techniques can be fruit-\nfully applied to explain criminal networks while rejecting\nthe notion of networks as a distinct form of organisation. In\naddition, the instrumental approach allows researchers to\nderive the structure of a network from the empirical evi-\ndence rather than merely assuming it (Morselli, 2009;\nVarese, 2010). This also opens up the possibility to test\nhypotheses on tie-formation using real-world data. SNA\nachieves its full potential when matched with substantive,\ntheory-driven, research questions.\nThis approach, however, is not without its pitfalls. Besides\nthe issues related to data collection and the quality of the data\navailable, this article has cautioned against an over-reliance\non structural measures alone as the latter may lead to ambig-\nuous if not misleading interpretations. In line with Varese\ninvoked a greater emphasis on additional \u00ad qualitative \u00ad evi-\ndence when investigating real-world criminal networks.\nFinally, this work has sought to foster explanation in crimi-\nnal network research by discussing an empirical strategy to\ntest hypotheses using (multiple) network datasets. This strat-\negy is based on QAP regression models. Some recent appli-\ncations reviewed in the article have shown this procedure to\nbe particularly apt for the study of a number of research\nquestions relevant to criminal network researchers.\n"
