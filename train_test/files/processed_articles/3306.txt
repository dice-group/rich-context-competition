Decreased expression of\naquaporin 1 and heme oxygenase-1 and increased expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and\nsodium\u00adhydrogen exchanger 3 were observed in RPTCs of angiotensinogen-transgenic mice and in angiotensinogen-\ntransfected immortalised RPTCs. These parameters were normalised by dual renin\u00adangiotensin system blockade. Both\nin vivo and in vitro studies identified a novel mechanism in which angiotensinogen overexpression in RPTCs enhances\nthe cytosolic accumulation of Nrf2 via the phosphorylation of pGSK3 Y216. Consequently, lower intranuclear Nrf2\nlevels are less efficient to trigger heme oxygenase-1 expression as a defence mechanism, which subsequently diminishes\naquaporin 1 expression in RPTCs.\nConclusions: Angiotensinogen-mediated downregulation of aquaporin 1 and Nrf2 signalling may play an important role\nin intrarenal renin\u00adangiotensin system-induced hypertension and kidney injury.\n",

Bouley et al. reported that\nangiotensin II (Ang II) rather than osmolality may be\nmore important in regulating AQP1 levels in renal proxi-\nmal tubules (RPTs).12 Ang II at low concentrations (10\u00ad9\nincreased AQP1 expression in cultured rat immortalised\nrenal proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs) in vitro and in rat\nkidneys in vivo, respectively. In contrast, Ang II at high\nconcentration (10\u00ad7 M) inhibited AQP1 expression in\nIRPTCs. Thus, the intrarenal RAS appears to regulate\nAQP1 expression, influencing water reabsorption and\nbody fluid homeostasis.\nOur lab has established that transgenic mice specifi-\ncally overexpressing angiotensinogen (the sole precursor\nof all angiotensins) in their RPTCs developed hyperten-\nsion and nephropathy with elevated intrarenal reactive\noxygen species (ROS) production.13\u00ad15 In the present\nstudy, we aimed to determine whether intrarenal RAS-\ninduced hypertension and kidney injury in our angio-\ntensinogen-transgenic (Agt-Tg) mice could be mediated,\nat least in part, via alteration of AQP1 expression and\nwhether RAS blockade in this transgenic model could\nreverse this effect. We further aimed to define the underly-\ning molecular mechanisms both in vivo and in vitro.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimal models and ethics statement\nAgt-Tg mice overexpressing renal rat angiotensinogen\nwere generated by employing the kidney-specific, andro-\ngen-regulated protein promoter (KAP2) linked to rat\nangiotensinogen cDNA as reported previously.16 There\nis no need to administer exogenous androgen since the\ncirculating level of testosterone in adult male Agt-Tg\nmice (from 12 weeks of age, as is the case here) is suffi-\nciently high to drive KAP2 promoter to express the\nand studied starting at 10 weeks of age and treated with or\nwithout hydralazine (15 mg/kg/day, in drinking water),\nlosartan (losartan 30 mg/kg/day, in drinking water) and/or\ndual RAS blockers (losartan 30 mg/kg/ day plus perindo-\npril 4 mg/kg/ day, in drinking water) from week 13 until\nlittermates served as controls. All animals had free access\nto standard mouse chow (Diet #2918, Harlan Teklad,\nMontreal, Canada) and water.\nThe animal study was carried out under strict condi-\ntions according to the recommendations in the guide for\nthe case and use of laboratory animals of the National\nInstitutions of Health. Animal care and procedures were\napproved by the animal care committee from the Centre de\nRecherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de\nMontr\u00e9al (CRCHUM). Mice were killed by sodium pento-\nbarbital overdose (75 mg/kg of body weight (BW)) and\nefforts were made to minimise suffering.\nPhysiological studies\nMean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored by the\ntail-cuff method with the Visitech BP-2000 blood pressure\nanalysis system for mice (Visitech System Inc., Apex, NC,\nUSA), as reported elsewhere.13\u00ad15 Animals in each group\nwere acclimated to longitudinal SBPmeasurement (2-week\nperiod of pre-training starting at 11 weeks of age, followed\nby actual measurement of SBP thrice weekly from 13\nweeks until 20 weeks of age) to minimise stress to the ani-\nmals. While the technique of tail-cuff measurement is gen-\nerally considered less sensitive than telemetry, our SBP\ndata include a 2-week pre-study training period and sub-\nstantial numbers of animals (N=8\u00ad15 mice per group) and\nlongitudinal measurement (8 weeks excluding the 2-week\npre-study training period).\nTwenty-four hours before the mice were killed, BW\nwas recorded and mice were individually housed for 24\nhours in metabolic cages. Blood was collected individually\nvia intracardiac exsanguination before death and then cen-\ntrifuged to obtain serum. Urine was collected and assayed\nfor albumin and creatinine ratio (g/mg) (enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA), Albuwell and Creatinine\nCompanion, Exocell, Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA), angio-\ntensinogen and Ang II measurement (i.e. C18 Sep-Pak col-\numns (Waters, Mississauga, ON, Canada); extraction kits\n(BachemAmericas, Torrance, CA, USA); ELISAs (Bachem\nAmericas)) as reported previously.13\u00ad15 Kidney weights\nwere rapidly recorded. The left kidney was utilised for\nrenal histology and the right kidney was reserved for RPTs\nisolation by the Percoll gradient method for protein expres-\nsion experiments as previously reported.13\u00ad15\nChang et al. 3\nRenal morphology, immunohistochemistry and\nimmunofluorescence\nThe renal morphology and immunostaining (immunohis-\ntochemistry and immunofluorescence) were performed as\ndescribed previously.14,16 Briefly, the kidney morphology\nwas studied with periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) and Masson's\ntrichrome staining.

The sodium\u00adhydro-\ngen exchanger 3 (NHE3) antibody was a gift from Dr\nOrson Moe (University of Texas Southwestern Medical\nCenter, Dallas, TX, USA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody\nagainst rAgt was generated in our laboratory17 and is spe-\ncific for intact rat and mouse angiotensinogen (55\u00ad62 kDa)\nand does not cross-react with pituitary hormone prepara-\ntions or other rat or mouse plasma proteins, as described\nRat immortalised renal proximal tubular cells\nThe IRPTC cell line11,18 and an IRPTC stable clone that\nhas been stably transfected with the control plasmid pRC/\nRSV (designated as `pRSV-IRPTC') or with a plasmid\npRC/RSV containing the rat angiotensinogen cDNA (des-\nignated as `pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC')13,19 were employed for\nour in vitro studies. We have previously reported that as\ncompared to naive IRPTC and pRSV-IRPTC, pRSV/rAgt-\nIRPTC express significantly high amounts of rat angio-\ntensinogen mRNA and protein as well as significantly\nhigher amounts of Ang II secreted into the culture\nmedium.13,19 All in vitro studies were performed in the nor-\nmal 150 nM NaCl final concentration with an osmolarity\nof 415 mOsm/kg in normal glucose (5 mM D-glucose)\nDMEM as reported by Bouley et al.12\nNuclear protein and cytosolic protein extracts were pre-\npared using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extrac-\ntion kit (Thermo Scientific, Burlington, ON, Canada).18\nCobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP, an activator of HO-1 expres-\nsion) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada\n(Oakville, ON, Canada).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical significance between the experimental groups\nwas analysed by one-way analysis of variance, followed\nby the Bonferroni test using Graphpad Software, Prism\n5.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA, http://www.graphpad.com/\nprism/Prism.htm).

There were no significant differences in BW, kid-\nney weight and the kidney weight/BW ratio (Figure 1(a))\namong the five groups. However, as compared to the con-\ntrol group, SBP (Figure 1(a), a cross-sectional measure-\nment at week 20; Figure 1(b), a longitudinal measurement\n(weeks 13\u00ad20)), urinary albumin/creatine ratio (ACR, g/\nmg) (Figure 1(c)), angiotensinogen/creatine ratio (ng/mg)\n(Figure 1(d)) and Ang II/creatine ratio (ng/mg) (Figure\n1(e)) were relatively increased in Agt-Tg mice; these\nchanges were prevented by the treatment of losartan alone\nand/or dual RAS blockade in Agt-Tg mice. It appears that\ndual RAS blockade was more effective than losartan alone\nin decreasing the urinary ACR (Figure 1(c)). In contrast,\nalthough hydralazine treatment was able to decrease SBP\nin Agt-Tg mice over the follow-up period (Figure 1(a) and\n(b)), the urinary ACR was unchanged (Figure 1(c)). The\nserum level of angiotensinogen (Figure 1(e)) or Ang II\n(Figure 1(f)) did not differ between the groups.\nRenal morphology and extracellular matrix\nprotein\nBoth PAS staining (Figure 2(a)) and Masson's trichrome\nstaining (Figure 2(b)) of kidney sections revealed enhanced\nextracellular matrix (ECM) protein accumulation in the\nglomerulo-tubular areas in hypertensive Agt-Tg mice, a\nfinding that was confirmed by collagen type IV (Figure\n2(c)) and TGF1-immunohistochemistry staining (Figure\n2(d)). The degree of oxidative stress was confirmed by\nlower catalase expression in kidneys of hypertensive\n4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nangiotensinogen mice (Figure 2(e)). Semi-quantitative\nanalysis revealed that dual RAS blockade was more effec-\ntive in preventing ECM accumulation and collagen type\nIV/TGF-1 expression as well as in normalising catalase\nexpression in Agt-Tg mice as compared to losartan treat-\nment alone. Given the greater effectiveness of dual block-\nade, the remainder of our mechanistic experiments were\ndone with Agt-Tg mice treated with dual RAS blockade.\nRenal angiotensinogen, AQP1 and HO-1\nprotein expression\nWe assessed angiotensinogen, AQP1 and HO-1 protein\nexpression in the renal cortex by immunohistochemistry\n(Figure 3(a)) and in isolated RPTs by western blot (WB)\n(Figure 3(b)). AQP1 shows a two-band WB pattern (gly-\ncosylated (38 kDa) and non-glycosylated AQP1 frac-\ntions (28 kDa)), matching its original described character\nas an N-proteoglycan.20 The functional significance of\nAQP1 glycosylation is unknown but it could play a role\nin AQP1 oligomerisation,21 removal of sugars from the\nAQP1 molecule seems not to influence AQP1 water\ntransport function.22 Thus, in the current study, we eval-\nuated the change of total AQP1 including both glyco-\nsylated and non-glycosylated AQP1. Compared to\nnon-transgenic control littermates, increased angio-\ntensinogen, but decreased AQP1 and HO-1 protein\nexpression were observed in RPTs of Agt-Tg mice and\nthese changes were normalised with dual RAS blockade.\nThese data indicate an inverse relationship between\nangiotensinogen expression and AQP1 and HO-1 expres-\nsion in RPTs of Agt-Tg mice.\nTo establish a functional relationship among angio-\ntensinogen, AQP1 and HO-1 expression, we performed\nin vitro studies by using IRPTCs.11,18 In the presence of\nCoPP, an activator of HO-1, both HO-1 and AQP1 pro-\ntein expressions were increased (Figure 3(c)) while the\nangiotensinogen protein expression was reduced (Figure\n3(d)) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, these\neffects seem selective because CoPP did not affect Nrf2\nexpression (Figure 3(e)). We further confirmed those\nresults in naive IRPTCs and IRPTCs transiently\nFigure 1.

However, higher magnifi-\ncation of immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the\naugmented Nrf2 was mostly localised to the cytosolic por-\ntion in RPTCs of Agt-Tg mice with some Nrf2 staining in\nthe nuclei of RPTCs (Figure 4(a)). In contrast, in the kid-\nneys of Agt-Tg mice treated with dual RAS blockade, the\nmajority of positive immunohistochemistry-Nrf2 was local-\nised in the nuclei of RPTCs (Figure 4(a)). Keap1, a protein\ninvolved in Nrf2 degradation showed no change in expres-\nsion in the kidneys among three groups by either immuno-\nhistochemistry staining (Figure 4(a)) or WB (Figure 4(b)).\nNext, we validated the renal Nrf2 translocation pattern in\nour pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants.13,19 As com-\npared with naive IRPTC and pRSV-IRPTC control transfor-\nmants, the pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants\nexpressed high amounts of rat angiotensinogen and Nrf2\nprotein without any change in Keap1 protein expression\n(Figure 5(a)). Also, AQP1 expression was dramatically sup-\npressed in the pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable clone (Figure 5(a)).\nSimilar to the in vivo observation, the higher and lower Nrf2\nexpression was observed in the cytosolic fraction and\nnuclear fraction of pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants,\nrespectively, as compared to pRSV-IRPTC controls (Figure\n5(b)).

In brief,\nangiotensinogen overexpression in RPTCs enhances cyto-\nsolic accumulation of Nrf2 via the phosphorylation of\npGSK3 Y216. Consequently, less intranuclear Nrf2 is\navailable to trigger HO-1 expression as a defence mecha-\nnism. As a result, AQP1 expression in RPTCs is subse-\nquently diminished. The depleted AQP1 expression\nthrough -catenin-dependent signalling further contributes\nto hypertension that involves the intrarenal RAS (via\nNHE3) and nephropathy.\nIn this study, we are focusing on the functional interac-\ntion between angiotensinogen and AQP1 in RPTCs, given\nthe fact that Aqp1-null mice appear not to develop homeo-\nstasis disturbances although they have slight dehydration.3\nIn concert with our previous findings,13\u00ad15 we observed\nthat Agt-Tg mice specifically overexpressing rat\nangiotensinogen in their RPTCs developed hypertension\nand nephropathy. As we only detected a significantly\nincreased urinary Agt/Cre ratio and Ang II/Cre ratio in\nAgt-Tg mice, while serum levels of angiotensinogen and\nAng II remained unchanged, it suggests that angiotensino-\ngen derived predominantly from RPTCs rather than other\nsources23,24 plays the key role in this phenomenon.\nThe use of combination treatment with an ACE inhibi-\ntor and angiotensin-receptor blocker to ameliorate the pro-\ngression of kidney disease has been controversial because\nof concern about an increased risk of hyperkalaemia or\nacute kidney injury.25,26 However, a recent meta-analysis\npublished in the Lancet27 reported a benefit of dual RAS\nblockade in the prevention of chronic kidney disease with\nor without diabetes. Our current data lend support to these\nobservations. We found that as compared to the treatment\nwith losartan alone, dual RAS blockade (losartan and per-\nindopril) was more effective in preventing hypertension\ninduced by activation of the intrarenal RAS and nephropa-\nthy progression in Agt-Tg mice. Moreover, although\nhydralazine decreased systemic hypertension in Agt-Tg\nmice over the follow-up period, it had no impact on ACR\n(a marker of renal function), suggesting that intrarenal\nRAS activation contributed to the development of\nFigure 4.

Notably, substantial inhibition of AQP1\nand HO-1 protein expression in the RPTCs was observed\nin the kidney of Agt-Tg mice, implicating their possible\nrole in the pathogenesis of hypertension and nephropathy.\nThis possibility is supported by the observation that sig-\nnificantly decreased renal AQP1 content was observed in\nthe obstructed kidneys of rats with unilateral ureteral\nobstruction, suggesting that downregulation of AQP1\nmight be associated with tubule-interstitial fibrosis.9\nMoreover, in the mouse model of hypertension induced by\na high-salt diet, the reduction of cardiac AQP1 might be\nassociated with hypertension and cardiac injury, because\nangiotensin-receptor blocker treatment (valsartan) par-\ntially reversed the effects of a high-salt diet on hyperten-\nsion with cardiac damage (fibrosis and inflammatory cell\ninfiltration) and normalised cardiac AQP1 expression.10\nOur in vitro studies demonstrated that CoPP, an activa-\ntor of HO-1, dose-dependently stimulates HO-1 and AQP1\nand inhibits angiotensinogen protein expression in\nIRPTCs, suggesting an inverse relationship between the\nexpression of angiotensinogen and HO-1/AQP1 in RPTCs.\nHow HO-1 and AQP1 interact is not fully understood. A\npossible link between AQP1 and HO-1 might be via the\nKruppel-like protein, since the AQP1 promoter contains\nKruppel-like sequences,28 and Kruppel-like factor 2\ndependently induced HO-1 expression.29\nHO-1 is a stress-inducible protein that induces cellular\nprotection in the event of injury, inflammation, oxidative\nstress, etc. Exogenous induction of HO-1 has been shown\nto have renal and/or cardiovascular protective func-\ntions30,31 and to attenuate the development of hypertension\nand to decrease blood pressure in models of established\nFigure 5.

These data suggested\nthat while overexpression of angiotensinogen in RPTCs\nresulted in activated Nrf2 expression, it still failed to pro-\nmote sufficient HO-1 and AQP1 expression in RPTCs to\nprevent or diminish ROS-induced kidney damage and\nhypertension occurring in Agt-Tg mice. Compelling\nstudies suggested that Nrf2 accumulation/activation is\ncountered by two major Nrf2 degradation mechanisms \u00ad\ne.g. Keap1-induced Nrf2 proteasomal degradation in the\ncytosol; and/or GSK3-mediated nuclear export and deg-\ndiffer among the three groups of animals, Keap1-associated\nNrf2 degradation appears to be normal in our model.

In brief, overexpression of\nthe intrarenal angiotensinogen gene in RPTCs via elevated\nROS generation mediates Nrf2 activation with an impaired\nNrf2 translocation pattern. Angiotensinogen overexpression\nin RPTCs promotes and inhibits the phosphorylation of pGSK\nY216 (active form) and pGSK S9 (inactive form), respectively.\nConsequently, nuclear export of Nrf2 activity is enhanced,\nresulting in the accumulation of Nrf2 in the cytosol, and\ndecreased Nrf2 expression in nuclei, which fails to trigger\nHO-1 expression as a defence mechanism and subsequently\ndiminishes AQP1 expression in RPTCs. Concomitantly, the\ndepleted AQP1 expression through -catenin-dependent\nsignalling further contributes to intrarenal RAS-induced\nnephropathy and hypertension (via NHE3).\nNrf2 was associated with an accumulation of Nrf2 in the\ncytosol, while lower nuclear levels of Nrf2 failed to trigger\nHO-1/AQP1 induction-mediated renoprotection in RPTCs\nin Agt-Tg mice.\nEvidence suggests that -catenin might be one of medi-\nators that links AQP1 and Ang II functionally.40\u00ad42 For\nexample, AQP1 acts as a scaffold in interaction with\nGSK3 to promote -catenin degradation by increasing\n-catenin phosphorylation; vice versa, loss of AQP1 inhib-\nits -catenin degradation and facilitates the translocation\nof free -catenin to the nucleus to enhance Wnt signalling,\nconsequently triggering cystic dilation of RPTs in polycys-\ntic kidney disease.42 In addition, Ang II via AT1R appears\nto promote the accumulation of -catenin protein, corre-\nlated with GSK3 phosphorylation, contributing to the\ndevelopment of renal fibrosis and hypertension.40,41 In the\ncurrent study, we observed the depleted AQP1 in our\nAgt-Tg and pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants acti-\nvated and inhibited phosphorylation of GSK3 (Y216) and\ngesting that loss of AQP1 might trigger the Wnt/-catenin\npathway, resulting in RPTs damage and hypertension.\nFinally, our data both in vivo and in vitro also suggest\nthat overexpression of angiotensinogen in RPTCs and the\nrelated hypertension might be due to decreased water\nabsorption via AQP1 and increased sodium reabsorption\nvia NHE3. Indeed, this observation is in line with recent\nfindings \u00ad e.g. when compared with wild-type mice\n(NHE3+/+), AQP1 is significantly increased in RPTCs of\nNHE3 knockout mice (NHE3-/-), which completely blunted\nAng II-induced hypertension, underscoring the importance\nofAQP1 and NHE3 interaction.43 In fact,Ang II-dependent\nhypertension mediated by an increased NHE3 abundance\nin RPTCs has been reported in AT1a receptor-deficient\nmice44\u00ad46 and in oxidative stress-modulated AT1R signal-\nling in Sprague\u00adDawley rats,47,48 although other Ang II\ninfusion models have provided variable results49\u00ad51 (NHE3\nhas been reported as increased50 or decreased49 or not\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that angiotensinogen/\nNrf2-mediated downregulation ofAQP1 and HO-1 expres-\nsion in the proximal tubule plays a key role in Ang\nII-induced hypertension and kidney injury.\nAuthor contributions\nSYC, CSL, XPZ, MCL and IC performed all experiments and\ncontributed to discussion.
