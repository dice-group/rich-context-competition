In the\nliterature, healthcare employees who simultaneously provide unpaid elder care at home have been referred to as double-\nduty caregivers. The present study broadens this perspective by examining the psychosocial implications of double-duty\nchild care (child care only), double-duty elder care (elder care only), and triple-duty care (both child care and elder care or\n\"sandwiched\" care).\nMethod: Drawing from the Work, Family, and Health Study, we focus on a large sample of women working in nursing\nhomes in the United States (n = 1,399). We use multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance tests to examine a\nrange of psychosocial implications associated with double- and triple-duty care.\nResults: Compared with nonfamily caregivers, double-duty child caregivers indicated greater family-to-work con-\nflict and poorer partner relationship quality. Double-duty elder caregivers reported more family-to-work conflict, per-\nceived stress, and psychological distress, whereas triple-duty caregivers indicated poorer psychosocial functioning\noverall.\nDiscussion: Relative to their counterparts without family caregiving roles, women with combined caregiving roles reported\npoorer psychosocial well-being. Additional research on women with combined caregiving roles, especially triple-duty car-\negivers, should be a priority amidst an aging population, older workforce, and growing number of working caregivers.\n",

In the literature, paid healthcare\nprofessionals who simultaneously provide unpaid elder\ncare at home are referred to as double-duty caregivers\n(Rutman, 1996). Double-duty care, however, comprises a\nlimited body of research. Conceptually, double-duty care\noverlooks other types of family caregiving roles. Further,\ndouble-duty care research has primarily been based on\nqualitative data, women working outside of the United\nStates, and relatively small samples (e.g., Boumans &\nJournals of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences\nUsing a large sample of women working in nursing\nhomes in the United States, the current study builds on\nand extends the literature by considering different com-\nbined caregiving roles among healthcare employees. That\nis, we broaden the definition of double-duty care to refer to\nhealthcare employees providing a single family caregiving\nrole at home, whether it be child or elder care, and dis-\ntinguish between these roles with the terms \"double-duty\nchild care\" and \"double-duty elder care,\" respectively. We\nalso account for healthcare employees in the sandwiched\ngeneration (e.g., Miller, 1981), meaning women who pro-\nvide both child and elder care at home; we call these women\n\"triple-duty caregivers\" to emphasize their simultaneous\nengagement in three different caregiving roles--formal\ncare, child care, and elder care. Additionally, we examine\nthe psychosocial implications associated with both double-\nand triple-duty care by applying the stress process model\n(Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990). Specifically, we\nassess subjective primary (perceived stress, psychologi-\ncal distress) and secondary (work and family role strains)\nstressors among women with combined caregiving roles.\nDouble- andTriple-Duty Care\nNearly 66 million adults provide some form of unpaid\nfamily care in the United States (National Alliance for\nCaregiving and AARP, 2009), constituting the largest\nsource of long-term care in the nation (AARP Public Policy\nInstitute, 2011). As the population rapidly ages (Jacobsen,\nKent, & Lee, Mather, 2011), there will be a greater need\nfor family caregivers' contributions. The interplay of recent\nsocietal and demographic trends, however, has complicated\nthe provision of family care. Americans are remaining in\nthe workforce longer and employment among older women\nAt home, women continue to outnumber men as family\ncaregivers (National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP,\n2009). Collectively, these trends indicate that the number of\nwomen balancing work and caregiving roles is increasing\n(Gordon, Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, Murphy, & Rose,\n2012). Caregiving is further complicated by delayed child-\nbirth and longer life expectancy, which can leave women\n\"sandwiched\" between caring for dependent children and\nolder adults while working (e.g., Pierret, 2006). Yet, one\nof the most complex combinations of work and caregiving\nroles is also one that has been neglected in the literature--\nwomen who provide formal care at work and informal care\nat home or double-duty care (Ward-Griffin, 2004).\nThe healthcare industry is currently facing significant\nchallenges from accelerated population aging, such as\nretaining an aging workforce already older than that found\nin other industry sectors, providing care to a rising num-\nber of older patients, and recruiting healthcare workers\nto counter a potentially severe nursing shortage amidst an\nincreasing demand for services (Harrington & Heidkamp,\nAcademies, 2008). Given that women dominate the major-\nity of professions within the healthcare industry and\ntypically enact family caregiving roles (National Alliance\nfor Caregiving and AARP, 2009; U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, 2013), the increasing likelihood that healthcare\nemployees will be balancing caregiving demands at home\npresents an additional challenge (Ward-Griffin et al., 2009).\nDespite this projection, empirical investigations of women\nsimultaneously participating in both private and public\ndomains of care were \"almost non-existent\" a decade ago\ndate (Boumans & Dorant, 2014). Instead, researchers have\nprimarily considered professional, paid caregiving and per-\nsonal, unpaid caregiving to be separate domains (Ward-\nWe address this limitation by conducting a timely exam-\nination of the psychosocial implications associated with\ndouble- and triple-duty care. To our knowledge, only one\nstudy has examined the implications of multiple caregiving\nroles among healthcare employees (Scott et al., 2006). That\nstudy assessed the impact of providing child, elder, and\nsandwiched care at home on hospital staff nurses' fatigue\nand stress. Nurses with family caregiving roles reported\nmore stress, physical fatigue, and mental fatigue relative to\ntheir nonfamily caregiving counterparts. Specifically, levels\nof fatigue and stress were highest among nurses engaging\nin sandwiched care at home. However, the Scott and cow-\norkers (2006) study was limited by a small sample of elder\nand sandwiched caregivers (32 and 29, respectively). The\ncurrent study is therefore the first to examine the psychoso-\ncial implications associated with different family caregiving\nroles among a large, unique sample of women working in\nnursing homes in the United States.\nConceptual Framework:The Stress Process\nWe adapted the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1990)\nto examine the perceived psychosocial implications of dou-\nble- and triple-duty care. The stress process model is based\non the concept of proliferation (Pearlin & Aneshensel,\noccurs when a stressor or set of stressors experienced in\nthe family caregiving role generate new problems in other\nroles or lead to an accumulation of stressors that spread to\nmultiple life domains (e.g., work). The stress process model\nalso distinguishes between primary and secondary stress-\nors. Within the context of family caregiving, primary stress-\nors are directly rooted in caregiving hardships and drive the\nstress process by producing other stressors. In this paper,\nprimary stressors refer to subjective appraisals of hardships\nencountered in family caregiving roles. Secondary stressors\nare exacerbated or influenced by primary stressors; they\narise as a result of caregiving demands but occur in other\nroles. In the current study, we pose the following questions\nfor both sets of stressors: How do nonfamily caregiving\nhealthcare employees differ from women with combined\ncaregiving roles? How do women with combined caregiv-\ning roles differ from each other?\nPrimary Stressors\nWe consider two subjective indicators of primary stress-\nors, perceived stress and psychological distress. Given\nthat women in combined caregiving roles provide care\nat work and at home, they may be exposed to challenges\nbeyond typical stressors associated with family caregiving.\nFor instance, relative to home-based care workers, nurs-\ning home employees indicate more physical and emotional\nstrain (Hasson & Arnetz, 2008). Indeed, these nurses\nengage in physically demanding tasks and experience work-\nplace stressors ranging from witnessing the decline and/or\ndeath of patients to respecting patients' autonomy when\nconfronted with physical resistance (Ross et al., 1994;\nVonDras, Flittner, Malcore, & Pouliot, 2009). However,\nhealthcare employees may anticipate or expect such stress-\nors because it is likely that they self-selected into their\nemployment role (Pearlin & Aneshensel, 1994). That is,\nbecause healthcare employment is a role that women have\nembarked on, prepared for, or settled into, they are aware\nof or familiar with its stressors. Similarly, double-duty\nchild caregivers may be balancing two expected care roles\nin that child care is often regarded as a more normative\nor planned role relative to other family care roles (Pearlin\n& Aneshensel, 1994). Further, unlike caring for an elderly\nperson, child care recipients become increasingly independ-\nent over time and care arrangements are often more stable\n(Hessel & Keck, 2009). Thus, double-duty child caregiv-\ners may subjectively experience hardships more similarly to\nnonfamily caregivers than double-duty elder or triple-duty\ncaregivers.\nIn contrast, double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiv-\ners may be balancing expected and unexpected care roles.\nQualitative data from double-duty elder caregivers sug-\ngests that they are often not self-selected into their fam-\nily caregiving role; rather, women describe facing strong\nfamilial pressure to provide family care because of their\ngender and healthcare expertise (Ward-Griffin et al., 2005).\nDouble-duty elder caregivers also mention family mem-\nbers' heavy reliance on them for providing or coordinating\ncare, being pressured to accept more care responsibilities\nthan desired, and having high expectations of themselves to\nprovide quality care. These findings are reminiscent of role\ncaptivity, wherein an individual unwillingly enacts or feels\ntrapped by a family caregiving role (Pearlin et al., 1997).\nRole captivity is associated with distress, partially because\nfamily caregivers feel that they lack control or power over\naspects of their own lives (Pearlin & Aneshensel, 1994). In\naddition, elder care has been considered more emotionally\ndemanding as well as less predictable than child care given\nthat elder care recipients' needs increase over time, change\nsuddenly, and last for an unspecified period of time (Hessel\n& Keck, 2009). Double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiv-\ners may therefore indicate more primary stressors relative\nto their nonfamily caregiving counterparts and double-duty\nchild caregivers.\nSecondary Stressors\nThe designated secondary stressors for our investigation\nfocus on role strains within the major institutions of work\nand family. With women increasingly balancing employ-\nment and family caregiving, interest in work\u00adfamily issues\nand the implications of multiple roles has grown (Gordon\net al., 2012). Yet, research to date has largely not consid-\nered the work\u00adfamily interface for women with combined\ncaregiving roles (Ward-Griffin, 2004). Acknowledging that\nsecondary stressors typically arise when there are con-\nflicts between social roles (Knussen, Tolson, Swan, Stott,\n& Brogan, 2005), the current study examines healthcare\nemployees' appraisals of work\u00adfamily conflict (bidirec-\ntional) and work-to-family (unidirectional) positive spill-\nover. Although positive spillover may seem discrepant in\ncomparison to our other psychosocial indicators, we con-\nsider this a work\u00adfamily strain or subjective secondary\nstressor to the degree in which work-to-family positive\nspillover is diminished or absent (Pearlin et al., 1990).\nWhile we are unaware of any studies that have assessed\nwork\u00adfamily stressors among triple-duty caregivers, prior\nevidence suggests that double-duty elder caregivers indicate\nboth positive and negative work\u00adfamily outcomes, whereas\ndouble-duty child caregivers report negative effects. For\ninstance, a previous study of hospital-based nurses found\nthat double-duty child care was correlated with work\u00adfam-\nily conflict, but double-duty elder care was not (Gottlieb,\nKelloway, & Martin-Matthews, 1996). In contrast,\nBoumans and Dorant (2014) found that more hours of fam-\nily care provision was associated with greater work\u00adfamily\nconflict as well as family-to-work positive spillover among\ndouble-duty elder caregivers. These work\u00adfamily conflict\nfindings are consistent with qualitative data from double-\nduty elder caregivers in which women express feelings of\nprolonged caregiving, the perception of being on-call all\nday with limited or no time off, and a continuous negotia-\ntion and subsequent renegotiation of professional and per-\nsonal role boundaries (Ward-Griffin et al., 2011). Boumans\nand Dorant (2014) attributed their positive spillover find-\nings to the role expansion perspective, which posits that\nindividuals benefit from balancing multiple roles by accu-\nmulating or enhancing resources such as mastery, social\nsupport, and personal accomplishment. Indeed, double-\nduty elder caregivers identify recognition, self-esteem, and\nopportunities for personal and family growth as rewarding\naspects of family caregiving in qualitative interviews (Ross\nrole expansion may be especially applicable to double-duty\nelder caregivers because their care roles are essentially an\nextension of each other, with similar knowledge or skills\nused in both roles to manage comparable care demands.\nThe current study also utilizes a subsample of healthcare\nemployees in a wider family network through their roles\nas a spouse or partner (n = 893). The presence of a spouse\nor partner does not mean an individual automatically ben-\nefits from partner support; rather, relationship quality is\nmore critical for support (Pearlin, Lieberman, Menaghan,\n& Mullan, 1981). Thus, women who positively appraise\npartner relationship quality may be able to capitalize on\npartner support to avoid, eliminate, or reduce stressors\nwhen confronted with caregiving hardships. For instance,\nsupport encompassing both personal and professional\nresources has been negatively correlated with the degree\nof blurring between professional and personal care roles\n(Ward-Griffin et al., 2011). We therefore assess healthcare\nemployees' perceptions of partner relationship quality\n(partner support and strain) to understand whether women\nwith combined caregiving roles view partners as resources\nor stressors. Similar to work-to-family positive spillover, we\nconsidered partner support to be a stressor to the degree\nin which it is diminished or absent. We also decided not\nto examine partner support as a moderating resource to\nexplain stressor variation; rather, we opted for a compre-\nhensive assessment of proliferated stressors among women\nwith combined caregiving roles. That is, we sought to\nassess differences in exposure to proliferated stressors and\nexamine whether healthcare employees with varying family\ncaregiving roles are different in their exposure to stressors\nrather than assume similar exposure across roles (Pearlin\nMethod\nSample and Procedures\nData derive from the Work, Family, and Health Study\n(WFHS), which examined work and family life outcomes\namong healthcare employees (Bray et al., 2013). Employees\nwere recruited from 30 nursing homes spanning six states,\nall owned by the same long-term health and specialized\ncare company. Eligible employees worked a minimum of\nhr per week in direct patient care, were not exclu-\nsively night shift workers, and received study information\nthrough recruiting materials and informed consent docu-\nin the WFHS. Participants completed 1-hr long computer-\nassisted personal interviews regarding work experiences,\npersonal well-being, and family relationships at a private\nlocation in the workplace.\nThe current study focuses on the 1,399 women who\nagreed to be interviewed. Women had a mean age of 38.7\nand 64% were married or in a cohabiting relationship.\nMost (67%) held positions as certified nursing assistants\n(CNA) and registered nurses or licensed practical nurses\n(28%). Sixty-one percent of women had some college\neducation or were college graduates and the modal house-\nworked a regular daytime shift and the average company\nMeasures\nCombined caregiving roles\nWe categorized employees into four groups based on exist-\ning child and elder care measures from the WFHS, which\nare comparable to those found in other studies (e.g.,\n& Korunka, 2013). Dependent child care was defined as\nhaving children 18 years of age or younger living with the\nemployee for at least 4 days per week.Elder care was defined\nas providing care (e.g., help with shopping, medical care, or\nassistance in financial/budget planning) for at least 3hr per\nweek in the past 6 months to an adult relative, regardless of\ntheir living situation. Triple-duty caregivers satisfied crite-\nria for both the child and elder care measures. Two women\nwere excluded from family care classifications for indicat-\ning they had children but not providing their ages. Overall,\ndouble-duty child caregivers, 228 (16%) double-duty elder\ncaregivers, and 196 (14%) triple-duty caregivers. On aver-\nage, both double-duty child (SD = 0.95) and triple-duty\nat home. The average age of dependent children was 6.81\ntriple-duty caregiving households, respectively.\nPrimary stressors\nWe used a global measure of perceived stress (Cohen,\nof psychological distress (Kessler et al., 2003). Perceived\nstress comprised four items (e.g., \"How often have you\nfelt that things were going your way?\") pertaining to the\nlast 30 days. Responses ranged from 1 (very often) to 5\n(never). We reverse-coded two items and summed responses\nto compute perceived stress scores ranging from 4 to 20,\nwith higher scores reflecting more stress ( = .76). Six\nitems examined psychological distress (e.g., \"How much of\nthe time did you feel hopeless?\") during the past 30 days.\nResponses ranged from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the\ntime). We summed responses to compute a composite dis-\ntress score ranging from 6 to 30, with higher scores denot-\ning greater distress ( = .84).\nSecondary stressors\nWe used the work\u00adfamily conflict scale from Netermeyer,\nBoles, and McMurrian (1996). Five items pertained to\nwork-to-family conflict (e.g., \"The demands of your work\ninterfere with your family or personal time\") and five items\nassessed family-to-work conflict (e.g., \"Family-related\nstrain interferes with your ability to perform job-related\nduties\") in the past 6 months. Responses ranged from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores\nreflect more work-to-family ( = .88) and family-to-work\n( = .79) conflict. The WFHS also included the affective\nspillover subscale from Hanson, Hammer, and Colton\n(2004) to examine work-to-family positive spillover. The\nscale comprised four items (e.g., \"Being happy at work\nhelps you to be happy at home\"), with responses ranging\nfrom 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher\nscores indicate greater work-to-family positive spillover\nWe adopted a measure of partner relationship quality\nfrom Schuster, Kessler, and Aseltine (1990). Five items eval-\nuated support (e.g., \"Does your partner appreciate you?\")\nand five items examined strain (e.g., \"Does your partner\ncriticize you?\") within the past month. Responses ranged\nfrom 1 (not at all) to 4 (a lot). We summed all items for\neach subscale, which resulted in a total score ranging from\n5 to 20. Higher scores reflect greater support ( = .92) and\nCovariates\nWe selected a number of demographic, employment, and\nhealth covariates motivated by the stress process model\nand past research. The model considers caregivers' social\nand economic background characteristics, specific fea-\ntures of the family caregiving context, and the caregivers'\nhealth status to be key characteristics influencing stressors\n(Pearlin et al., 1990). Caregivers' ascribed statuses, such\nas age (in years) and race (White, other), along with edu-\ncational attainment (postsecondary education or not) and\nor more), are embedded in the stress process. Further,\nadults' perceived stress, subjective well-being, and caregiv-\ning strain have differed by demographic characteristics in\nprior research (Jivraj, Nazroo, Vanhoutte, & Chandola,\nWeinstein, & Goldman, 2014); we therefore examine these\nbackground characteristics as potential statistical controls.\nWe also consider marital status (married/cohabiting versus\nsingle) because partners are part of employees' networks\nand may provide support; indeed, the continuously mar-\nried are considered advantaged in psychological well-being\n(Sasson & Umberson, 2014). Additionally, we select fea-\ntures of the employment role controlled for in previous\ndouble-duty care and healthcare employee studies, includ-\ning hours worked per week, company tenure, and occupa-\ntional status (CNA vs. other) (Boumans & Dorant, 2014;\nSchrijnemaekers et al., 2003). We also include the psycho-\nlogical job demands scale from Karasek and coworkers\n(1998) because work demands are linked to greater work\u00ad\nfamily conflict (Gordon et al., 2012), and elder care is asso-\nciated with work-related strain (Trukeschitz, Schneider,\nM\u00fchlmann, & Ponocny, 2013); higher scores indicate\ngreater job demands ( = .59).\nTo account for family caregiving context, we control\nfor developmental disabilities, physical health problems,\nor long-term, serious mental health problems among\ndependent children. With regard to health status, we assess\nemployees' diagnoses of chronic health conditions (diabe-\ntes, cancer, and high blood pressure) as such conditions\nhave been differentially associated with caregiving strain\n(Perkins et al., 2013). Similar to prior research, history of\nchronic health conditions was obtained by dichotomous\nindicators (e.g., \"Has a doctor ever told you that you have\ncancer?\") (Perkins et al., 2013). Given its relationship to\nemotional well-being over the life course (Windsor, Burns,\n& Byles, 2013), we also examine employees' functional\ndisabilities with the physical functioning subscale from the\nSF-36, which assesses the ability to perform various physi-\ncal activities (e.g., climbing stairs); higher scores indicate\nbetter physical functioning ( = .87; Ware & Sherbourne,\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe first examine employees' demographic, employment,\nand health characteristics for potential inclusion as covari-\nates in multivariate analysis by conducting analysis of\nvariance tests with Tukey post hoc comparisons to iden-\ntify mean differences among nonfamily, double-duty child,\ndouble-duty elder, and triple-duty caregivers. We include\nany variables on which the groups differ significantly, in\naddition to child disability, as covariates. Next, we perform\nmultiple linear regression analysis to predict the psycho-\nsocial implications (primary stressors: perceived stress,\npsychological distress; secondary stressors: work\u00adfamily\nconflict, partner relationship quality) of double- and triple-\nduty care with nonfamily caregivers as the reference group.\nWe also analyze adjusted mean differences with analysis of\ncovariance (ANCOVA) tests using Tukey post hoc compari-\nsons to assess how women with combined caregiving roles\ndiffer from each other. For relationship quality analyses, we\nrestrict the sample to married and cohabiting employees\nResults\nBackground and Context of the Stress Process\nTable 1 provides information about demographic, work,\nand health characteristics by combined caregiving roles.\nEmployees differed by age, marital status, race, company\ntenure, psychological job demands, functional disability,\nand high blood pressure. We therefore used these vari-\nables, as well as child disability, as covariates. On average,\ndouble-duty child and triple-duty caregivers were younger\nthan nonfamily and double-duty elder caregivers, married\nor cohabiting to a greater extent than double-duty elder\ncaregivers, and were more racially diverse and had shorter\ncompany tenure than nonfamily caregivers. Additionally,\ndouble-duty child caregivers were married or cohabiting\nmore and had better physical functioning scores relative\nto nonfamily caregivers as well as had shorter company\ntenure and reported high blood pressure to a lesser extent\nthan double-duty elder caregivers. Both double-duty elder\nand triple-duty caregivers indicated greater psychological\njob demands than nonfamily caregivers.\nPsychosocial Implications\nMultiple regression and ANCOVA results are presented\nin Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Company tenure and high\nblood pressure were nonsignificant predictors across mod-\nels and subsequently removed; this did not affect model fit\nor alter results. For each psychosocial indicator we present\nregression results first, in which no family care is the refer-\nence group, and then discuss adjusted mean differences in\noutcome scores across all four groups of employees.\nNonfamily Caregivers versus Double-Duty Child,\nDouble-Duty Elder, andTriple-Duty Caregivers\nPrimary stressors\nDouble-duty elder and triple-duty care were associated\nwith greater perceived stress and psychological distress\nin regression analysis. A subsequent ANCOVA comple-\nmented these findings; double-duty elder and triple-duty\ncaregivers had higher perceived stress (p < .05 and p <\n.05, respectively) and psychological distress (p < .001 and\np <.001, respectively) scores. Additionally, employees who\nwere older, White, married or cohabiting, and had better\nphysical functioning indicated fewer subjective primary\nstressors, whereas child disability and more psychological\njob demands were linked to more primary stressors.\nSecondary stressors\nIn regression analysis, triple-duty care was associated with\ngreater work-to-family conflict, with the same findings\nemerging in a follow-up ANCOVA (p < .05). Child disabil-\nity and more psychological job demands were also related\nto greater work-to-family conflict, whereas better physical\nfunctioning and older age were linked to less work-to-fam-\nily conflict. All three combined caregiving roles predicted\nmore family-to-work conflict, but none of the combined\ncaregiving roles were associated with work-to-family posi-\ntive spillover; ANCOVA results complemented these find-\nings in that double-duty child (p < .01), double-duty elder\n(p < .001), and triple-duty (p < .01) caregivers had higher\nfamily-to-work conflict scores, and there were no group\ndifferences for positive spillover. Employees who were\nolder, White, married, and had better physical functioning\nalso reported less family-to-work conflict. As for partner\nrelationship quality, both double-duty child and triple-duty\ncare were associated with less support and greater strain.\nSimilarly, double-duty child and triple-duty caregivers had\nlower support (p < .05 and p < .01, respectively) and higher\nstrain (p < .001 and p < .001, respectively) scores. Child dis-\nability was also associated with less partner support while\nbetter physical functioning predicted less partner strain.\nTable 1.

Additionally,\ndouble-duty elder caregivers had higher psychological dis-\ntress scores than double-duty child caregivers (p < .001).\nDouble-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers did not signifi-\ncantly differ on any psychosocial indicators.\nDiscussion\nWomen with combined caregiving roles represent a unique\ngroup of working caregivers. Given their invaluable soci-\netal contributions and an increasing need for their services,\nit is essential to acquire additional information about this\nunderstudied population. The present study builds on exist-\ning literature by broadening the perspective of double-duty\ncare, focusing on women working in nursing homes in the\nUnited States, and examining the psychosocial implications\nof double- and triple-duty care.\nDouble-Duty Caregivers\nOur findings suggest that double-duty child caregivers\nexperience fewer stressors, particularly subjective primary\nstressors, in comparison to employees balancing elder and\nsandwiched care roles. This group, however, indicated\ngreater secondary stressors in the form of family-related\nstrains relative to nonfamily caregivers. Our results are\nconsistent with a study on hospital-based nurses that found\npositive correlations between child care and strain- and\ntime-based family-to-work conflict (Gottlieb et al., 1996).\nFurther, parenthood has been linked to lower marital sat-\nisfaction, a finding attributed to role conflicts and restric-\ntion of parents' freedom, which reflects double-duty child\ncaregivers' poorer relationship quality (Twenge, Campbell,\n& Foster, 2003). Our findings also align with prior research\nsuggesting that child care is a more normative role and\nthat working child caregivers are least likely to experience\nself-loss or depression (Hessel & Keck, 2009; Pearlin &\nAneshensel, 1994). Moreover, these results are consistent\nwith our expectation that double-duty child caregivers' sub-\njectively experience hardships more similarly to nonfamily\ncaregivers than double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers.\nOur results also suggest that double-duty elder caregivers\nexperience more negative subjective primary stressors and\nfamily-related strains conflicting with work than their non-\nfamily caregiving counterparts. These findings complement\na prior study by Boumans and Dorant (2014), which found\nthat more family care hours were associated with poorer\nmental health, more emotional exhaustion, and increased\nhome-to-work conflict among double-duty elder caregiv-\ners. Further, our results align with qualitative evidence from\ndouble-duty elder caregivers in which women speak about\nTable 2.

These results are consistent with previous work by\nScott and coworkers (2006), who found that hospital staff\nnurses with sandwiched care obligations at home indicated\ngreater mental fatigue and increased stress compared with\ntheir nonfamily caregiving counterparts. Interestingly, psy-\nchosocial implications did not differ between double-duty\nelder and triple-duty caregivers; rather, these caregivers\nboth reported more family-related strain and negative pri-\nmary stressors compared with nonfamily caregivers. Unlike\ndouble-duty elder caregivers, however, triple-duty caregiv-\ners reported greater work-related strain and poorer rela-\ntionship quality than nonfamily caregivers, which raises\nquestions about the availability and utilization of profes-\nsional and personal support among this group.\nLimitations\nOur study is the first to use a large sample of women work-\ning in nursing homes in the United States to examine the\npsychosocial implications of double- and triple-duty care.\nNevertheless, we utilize self-report data and a cross-sec-\ntional, correlational design, which constrains the ability\nto identify causal relationships or detect changes in stress-\nors. Considering our focus on nursing home workers, our\nfindings may also not be generalizable to other healthcare\nemployees (e.g., physicians). Although we used a diverse\nsample, everyone worked for the same corporation, further\nlimiting generalizability. We were also unable to exhaus-\ntively examine covariates with the potential to influence\nstressors, such as employees' perceptions of the division of\nhousehold labor or specific features of caring for an older\nadult. Given our use of multiple regressions, our analy-\nsis does not account for the bias of unobserved variables.\nFurther, although we assessed negative and positive work\u00ad\nfamily outcomes, the WFHS did not include a family-to-\nwork positive spillover measure.\nMoreover, we conducted a secondary analysis of data\nfrom the WFHS, which was not specifically designed to\nstudy caregiving. Similar to Tement and Korunka (2013)\nand Scott and coworkers (2006), we applied proxy meas-\nures of family caregiving roles to determine role occu-\npancy and did not possess information regarding objective\nprimary stressors or caregiving demands (e.g., elder care\nrecipients' health status). However, subjective reactions to\ncaregiving have played a larger role in prior research on\nstress proliferation among caregivers than objective physi-\ncal demands (Knussen et al., 2005). Additionally, a sub-\nsample of employees in the current study participated in\nqualitative interviews in which they were asked about elder\ncare obligations. Employees mentioned caring for an aging\nrelative who is chronically ill, in declining health, or has\nmultiple health problems (end-stage renal disease, demen-\ntia, diabetes), monitoring parents' health status, assisting\nwith recovery from adverse health events (post-stroke, hip\nTable 3.

Thus, even\nthough we do not assess objective primary stressors, quali-\ntative evidence from the WFHS suggests that employees\ncared for older adults with a variety of health conditions\nand engaged in a range of caregiving tasks. One advantage\nof the current approach is that, given the diversity of care\nsituations reported, our sample may be more representative\nof working caregivers than a sample selected for a certain\nthreshold of care or diagnosis (e.g., dementia). Indeed, our\nheterogeneous sample may actually underestimate the psy-\nchosocial implications of double- and triple-duty care.\nFuture Directions\nWe have several suggestions for future double- and triple-\nduty care research, which should be a priority amidst an\naging population, older workforce, and growing number\nof working caregivers. First, researchers should assess\nwhether these caregivers find existing workplace programs,\npractices, and policies relevant or useful for their unique\nwork\u00adfamily demands. This is particularly important for\nsingle healthcare employees with family care obligations.\nNearly half of double-duty elder caregivers in the WFHS\nsample were single, automatically leaving them without\naccess to the potential resource of partner support. To\ncompensate for a lack of resources at home, single double-\nand triple-duty caregivers may rely on workplace supports\nmore heavily. Alternatively, supportive policies may be in\nplace but family caregivers may fear workplace penalties\nfor utilization or overutilization of available formal sup-\nport. Prospective qualitative research could explore these\nissues further by asking double- and triple-duty caregivers\nto identity perceived barriers to workplace supports and\nalso discuss key resources at home for facilitating work-life\nbalance in the absence of partner support.\nFurther, healthcare employers can administer work-\nforce and workplace assessments to examine as well as\nmonitor the changing demographics, skills, and work-\nlife demands of their current workforce (Harrington &\net al., 2009). The subjective stressors associated with dou-\nble- and triple-duty care will likely become a greater con-\ncern for the healthcare industry as it seeks to retain or\nhire employees with an increased likelihood of family care\nobligations at home. Workplace assessments may provide\nimportant insight regarding effective strategies for attract-\ning and retaining employees as well as identifying alter-\nnate pathways into retirement (Sweet, Pitt-Catsouphes,\nBesen, Hovhannisyan, & Pasha, 2010). Feedback from\nthese assessments could also be used to develop appro-\npriate and targeted work-life strategies, flexible or cus-\ntomized scheduling practices, family-friendly policies,\nhealth-promoting practices, and supervisor behavior\ntraining programs with an emphasis on work\u00adfamily\nsupport (Kossek, Hammer, Kelly, & Moen, 2014). In\nturn, such changes could reduce turnover, increase job\nsatisfaction, enhance health, and facilitate work-life bal-\nance (Harrington & Heidkamp, 2013), all of which may\nbenefit care recipients by decreasing caregivers' stressors\nand increasing resources. Moreover, engaging employees\nin decision-making processes regarding workplace prac-\ntices and policies may provide family caregivers with the\nopportunity to inform employers about aspects of their\njob that create work\u00adfamily conflict and also propose\nways to ameliorate such situations (Sweet et al., 2010).\nAdditional research on the prevalence, types, and implica-\ntions of double- and triple-duty care among both women\nand men employed in different occupations within the\nhealthcare industry is also warranted.\nFunding\nThis research was conducted as part of the Work, Family and\nHealth Network (http://www.WorkFamilyHealthNetwork.\norg), which is funded by a cooperative agreement through the\nNational Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention: Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute\nSocial Sciences Research, and National Institute for Occupational\nthe William T.
