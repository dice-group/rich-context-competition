This is the first report to identify that ATIP may have a similar role in other disease states characterised\nby excessive growth and indicates that for ATIP3, at least, an interaction with the AT2-receptor may not be necessary.\n",

Even less is known regard-\ning the function and the intracellular signalling pathways of\nthe ATIP isoforms in cardiac tissues and cell lines.\nTherefore, in the present study we have examined the\nexpression and function of the three rat ATIP variants in\nH9c2 cardiomyoblasts and myotubules in an attempt to\ngain new insights into the nature of the cardiac ATIP iso-\nforms and their interaction with the AT2-receptor.\nMethods\nCell culture\nRat H9c2 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's Modified\nEagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4 mM glu-\nfoetal calf serum (FCS). Rat myotubule cells were con-\nverted from H9c2 cells by allowing them to become conflu-\nent prior to changing the media to DMEM media\nsupplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 1.5 g/l sodium bicar-\nbonate solution 7.5% and 2% horse serum for 12 days to\nallow cell differentiation. All cell lines were maintained at\n37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2\nOver-expression studies in rat H9c2 cell line\nOver-expression studies utilised the full-length human\nATIP1 and ATIP3 fragment, sub-cloned into a pcDNA3\nvector which had been kindly donated by Dr Clara Nahmias\n(Institute Cochin, Paris, France). The day prior to transfec-\ntion, cells were plated in six well plates at a density of\n1.5 \u00d7 105 cells/well in DMEM media. Extra wells were\nseeded to examine the level of ATIP1 and ATIP3 mRNA\nover-expression in the cells using real-time polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR). Cells were approximately 60% con-\nfluent prior to transfection. On the day of transfection, 3 l\nof a pcDNA3 vector containing human ATIP1, ATIP3 or\npcDNA3 vector only (negative control) were diluted in 100\nl/well of serum-free DMEM in sterile tubes. In a separate\ntube, 4 l/well of Lipofectin\u00ae transfection reagent\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was diluted in 100 l/well\nof serum-free DMEM. Both tubes were incubated for 40\nminutes (min) at room temperature, following which the\ntwo tubes were mixed together and incubated for another\n12 min at room temperature to allow for the formation of\ntransfection complexes. A 1 ml aliquot of the solution was\nthen added to each well and gently mixed to ensure uniform\ndistribution. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C humid-\nified atmosphere of 5% CO2\nFollowing this incubation, the media were changed to\nserum-free DMEM and the cells were starved for 24 hours.\nReal-time PCR\nRat myoblast and myotubule cells were seeded in 25 cm2\nplastic flasks or six well plates containing complete DMEM\nserum (CS), 2% horse serum DMEM serum (HS) or other\ntreatments made in serum-free DMEM (SF). RNA was\nextracted using the RNeasy\u00ae Mini Kit (QIAGEN, USA).\nThe quality and concentration of mRNA, as well as DNAse\ntreatment, were performed as previously described.45 The\noligonucleotides primers and TaqmanTM probes for the\nvarious genes (Table 1) were kindly designed by Ms Josefa\nPete (Baker Heart Research Institute, Prahran, Victoria,\nAustralia) using Primer Express v2.0 (Applied Biosystems,\nCA, USA). Probes for the target genes were labelled with\n6-carboxy-fluoresecein (FAM) reporter dye at the 5' end.\ncDNA samples for each sample were analysed using the\nApplied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR System\n(Branchburg, New Jersey, USA). PCR amplification was\nconducted as previously described.45 To control for varia-\ntions in the amount of DNA used, the expression of the can-\ndidate gene of interest was normalised simultaneously (by\nmultiplexing) in relation to expression of the housekeeping\ngene 18S RNA (rRNA) (18S rRNA TaqMan Control\nReagent, Applied Biosystems). The CT\nvalue of each candi-\ndate gene probe was subtracted from the CT\nribosomal mRNA to give a CT\nvalue. The values are rep-\nresented as CT\nor percentage fold change.\nImmunoblotting for ATIP protein\nImmunoblotting for ATIP protein was undertaken as previ-\nously described.46 In short, cells were grown in T-125 flasks\nto 80% confluency and then detached, centrifuged and lysed\nin extraction buffer for five min on ice. Lysates were centri-\nfuged and the pellet was discarded. Protein concentration was\ndetermined using Bradford instant protein assay.47 Following\nprotein determination, a 0.5 volume of 2\u00d7 Laemmli's buffer\nwas added to each sample. Lysates were heated at 95\u00b0C for\nfive mins and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immu-\nnoblotting onto nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with\n1:1000 anti-ATIP antibody (kindly donated by Dr Clara\nNahmias, Cochin Institute, Paris, France)46 overnight at 4\u00baC\nand bands visualised with an enhanced chemiluminescence\nkit (ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham\nPharmacia Biotech UK Ltd, UK). Blots were stripped and re-\nhybridised with anti--actin antibody (A5316, Sigma, St.\nLouis, MO, USA) as a control for protein added. Band inten-\nsities were measured as previously described.45 Each sample\nwas run in duplicate and the ratio of ATIP over -actin was\ngenerated for four separate experiments.\nImmunoblotting of extracellular signal-regulated\nkinase 2 (ERK2) phosphorylation\nERK2 phosphorylation assays were conducted as described\npreviously.45 In summary, cells were grown in six well plates\n. The following day the cells were FCS-starved for 48\nhours prior to stimulation with the following treatments for\nC160, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were then washed\nwith ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in ice-\ncold buffer and Western blots performed as previously\ndescribed.45 Blots were hybridised overnight at 4\u00b0C with\n(Sigma Aldrich Co., Australia). The following day the mem-\nbrane was washed for one hour with skim milk and incubated\nfor one hour at room temperature prior to visualisation of\nprotein bands as described above.Anti-MAP kinase 2 (ERK-\n2) antibody (1:1000 dilution) was used as a control for pro-\ntein. The values presented in the results are the average\nphosphorylation of ERK2 relative to the amount of unphos-\nphorylated ERK2 in six separate samples. Band intensity\nlevels were measured using the Multi Gauge program. In\norder to simultaneously determine ERK2 phosphorylation\nandATIPover-expression in the studies that examined ERK2\nphosphorylation in myoblasts over-expressing ATIP1 or\nATIP3, six additional wells were plated at the commence-\nment of the assay (three of the wells were transfected with\nthe negative control and the remaining wells were transfected\nwith the relevantATIP variant) and mRNAwas generated for\nquantitative (Q)PCR analysis directly following the end of\nthe ERK2 phosphorylation assay.\nImmunohistochemistry\nRat myoblasts and myotubules were seeded on sterilised\ncover-slips in six well plates at 150,000 cells per well.

The cover-slips\nwere then washed with PBS for five min and incubated\novernight at 4\u00baC in ATIP primary antibody, with or without\na 1:3 dilution of ATIP antigen.\nThe following day, the cover-slips were incubated for one\nhour at room temperature with EnVision+\u00ae System-labelled\npolymer-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) anti-rabbit (DAKO,\nAustralia) and incubated with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole\n(AEC) Chromogen for 10 min.

Cells were washed with 70% ethanol\nand NaOH/SDS (0.25 M NaOH (APS Finechem, N.S.W,\nAustralia)/0.1% SDS, 300 l) solution was added to each\nwell to lyse the cells.

ATIP1 mRNA was expressed at signifi-\ncantly higher levels (two-fold, p = 0.03) in myoblast than\nin myotubule cells, whereas tATIP and ATIP3 were\nexpressed at similar levels in both cell lines. By contrast,\nAT1-receptor mRNA was approximately three-fold higher\nin myotubules than myoblasts (p = 0.01); whereas,\nalthough relatively low levels of AT2-receptor mRNA\nwere identified in myotubule cells, it could not be consist-\nently detected in myoblasts (i.e. it was identified in only\nsix of the 40 independent samples examined), strongly\nsuggesting that AT2-receptor mRNA is expressed at\nhigher levels in myotubules than myoblasts and that\nthere is little to no AT2-receptor mRNA expressed in\nmyoblast cells.\ntATIP protein expression and localisation in\nmyoblast and myotubule cell lines\nUsing an anti-ATIP antibody that identifies all three ATIP\nisoforms present in the rat (i.e. tATIP),36 tATIP protein\nexpression and localisation was examined in whole myo-\nblast and myotubule cells grown on cover-slips. tATIP\nstaining was localised to the cytoplasm of both cell lines,\nwhereas there was little or no staining observed in the\nnuclei (Figure 2). Moreover, staining was inhibited when\ncells were incubated with an ATIP antibody that had been\npre-absorbed overnight with ATIP antigen (Figure 2(b), (d),\n(f) and (g)).\nTo quantitate ATIP levels, some cover-slips were not\ncounterstained with haematoxylin and Scott's tap water\n(Figure 2(a), (b), (e) and (f)) and four randomly chosen\nfields from each cover-slip were then examined (Figure\n2(a) and (e)) for tATIP staining intensity, determined using\nthe MCID program. The analysis indicated that tATIP stain-\ning was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in myoblasts than\nmyotubule cells (Figure 2(i)).\nEffect of treatment with Ang II, EGF and\nAng II receptors and ATIP in myoblast and\nmyotubule cells\nIn both rat myoblast and myotubule cells, treatment with\nexpression mRNA for either Ang II receptor or any ATIP\nvariant (data not shown).\nEffect of treatment with Ang II, EGF and\nmorphology and hypertrophy\nRat myoblast and myotubule cells were seeded on cover-\nAng II, or CGP42112A and cell volume was calculated fol-\nlowing counterstaining.\nAs the size of cell nucleus was not significantly different\nin the untreated and treated cells (p = 0.23 for myoblasts\nand p = 0.39 for myotubules), we used mean change in cell\nvolume as a measure of cellular hypertrophy.\nTreatment of myoblasts with 16 nM EGF for 48 hours\nhad no effect on cell volume, whereas 96-hour EGF treat-\nment significantly induced (p < 0.001) cellular hypertro-\n(500 nM) for 96 hours also significantly increased cell vol-\nume (i.e. cellular hypertrophy) (p < 0.001).\nIn myotubules, 48 hours' treatment with 16 nM EGF or\nsignificant increase in myotubule volume (p  0.001).\nWhen Ang II was added in combination with the AT1-\nreceptor blocker losartan (500 nM) it no longer induced cell\nhypertrophy, suggesting that Ang II-induced hypertrophy is\nprimarily mediated through activation of the AT1-receptor\nin myotubule cells (data not shown).\nWe then examined the effects of the AT2-selective ago-\nAT1-receptor blockade (500 nM losartan).

These\nfindings are in contrast to the relative expression of the\nATIP variants in rat left ventricle, where ATIP1 mRNA was\nthe predominantly expressed ATIP variant followed by\nATIP3 mRNA.39 ATIP protein was identified in both whole\nmyoblasts and myotubules using immunohistochemical\ntechniques (Figure 2(a) and (b)); cytoplasmic staining for\ntATIP in whole cells was significantly higher in myoblasts\nthan myotubules (Figure 1(i)). Unfortunately, due to the\nnon-specific nature of the anti-tATIP antibody used in the\nimmunohistochemical studies, it was not possible to deter-\nmine the relative expression of the individual ATIP proteins\nin whole cells. Therefore, no real conclusions could be\ndrawn regarding the efficiency of translation of the various\nATIP mRNA species in the cells; however, it is tempting to\nspeculate that the significantly higher protein expression\nseen in myoblasts may result from the significantly higher\nlevels of ATIP1 mRNA identified in these cells and this\npossibility warrants further investigation.\nAs growth factors, for example, Ang II and EGF, are\nimplicated in the development of hypertension and other\ncardiovascular diseases, and as the anti-tATIP antibody\nused in our work cannot discriminate between the various\nATIP proteins in whole cells, we investigated whether these\nagents induced changes in the expression levels of mRNA\nfor the ATIP isoforms and the Ang II receptors. Using the\nendogenous AT1- and AT2-receptor agonist Ang II and epi-\ndermal growth factor EGF, we attempted to simulate condi-\ntions similar to those that occur during hypertension.\nPreviously, we identified that stimulation of LNCaP and\nPC3 cells with EGF or Ang II significantly decreased the\nexpression of tATIP and ATIP1 mRNA but had no effect on\nthe levels of AT1- and AT2-receptor mRNA.46 By contrast,\nin rat myoblast and myotubules, treatment with either EGF\nor Ang II did not affect ATIP mRNA expression (data not\nshown).\nIn functional studies by contrast and consistent with pre-\nhypertrophy in both H9c2 myoblasts and myotubules\n(Figure 3). Although some studies have linked the hyper-\ntrophic effects of Ang II to activation of the AT2-\nprimary mediator of Ang II-induced cellular hypertro-\nand previous work indicate that H9c2 myoblasts contain\nfew to noAT2-receptors,50 we were somewhat surprised that\nhypertrophy in the H9c2 cell lines. However, although\nconcentrations it also has the capacity to bind to and activate\nthe AT1-receptor.61,62 Therefore, to examine whether the\npossibly mediated via the AT1-receptor, we first incubated\nthe cells with losartan (an AT1-receptor selective antago-\nnist) in the presence or absence of the equipotent Ang II\nreceptor agonist Ang II. In these studies, losartan inhibited\nthe ability of Ang II to induce cellular hypertrophy (data not\nshown), suggesting thatAng II induced cellular hypertrophy\nprimarily via the AT1-receptor. Further studies were then\nconducted to determine whether the hypertrophic action of\nthese studies, which were conducted in both in myoblasts\nand myotubules, the AT1-receptor antagonist losartan inhib-\nited CGP42112A-mediated increases in cell volume (Figure\n1(a) and (b)); therefore, indicating that the Ang II receptor\nprimarily responsible for mediating hypertrophic responses\nin H9c2 cells was the AT1-receptor.\nMoreover, hypertrophy of the rat myoblast and myotu-\nbules was accompanied by an increase or re-expression of\nAT2-receptor mRNA, although this did not reach statistical\nsignificance (data not shown). Other studies have also iden-\ntified an up-regulation of the AT2-receptor with cardiac\nhypertrophy;19\u00ad21 however, the development of the onset of\nAT2-receptor re-expression is controversial and whether it\noccurs following or prior to the development of hypertro-\nWe also examined the effects of EGF, Ang II and\ndine incorporation and ERK phosphorylation assays.\nThese studies identified a dose-dependent increase in [3H]\nthymidine incorporation following treatment with EGF\nand Ang II for 18 hours (Figure 3). By contrast, but con-\nsistent with a lack of AT2-receptor-mediated growth in\nthese cells, CGP42112A did not affect cell proliferation\nnor did it potentiate the effects of EGF when given in\ncombination.\nIn ERK phosphorylation assays, we observed that in\nboth myoblast and myotubules EGF increased ERK2 phos-\nphorylation and although while not having an effect when\ngiven alone, Ang II significantly potentiated the effect of\nEGF (Figure 4). This latter finding is consistent with work\nconducted in vascular smooth muscle cells derived from\nporcine thoracic aortas,65 which suggested that Ang II inter-\nacts synergistically with EGF to induce sustained prolifera-\ntion via complementary actions at different cell cycle\nphases, as EGF has been shown to be involved in the early\ncell cycle phases andAng II tends to be involved in the later\ncell cycle phases.65 However, this finding contrasts with\nprevious work in which Ang II stimulated ERK2 phospho-\nrylation in rat myoblasts.66 This discrepancy, however, may\nresult from differences in the incubation medias used as in\nKinjo et al.40 Ang II was given in combination with 0.5%\nFCS, whereas in all of our ERK phosphorylation studies the\ncells were serum starved overnight and during treatment in\nan attempt to improve assay sensitivity. Consistent with our\nphosphorylation (Figure 4), adding further weight to the\npossibility that the AT2-receptor is not a pro-growth recep-\ntor in these cell lines.50\nAlthough there were no changes in the expression of\nATIP mRNA following treatment with the hypertrophic\nagonists, we further investigated the role of ATIP1 and\nATIP3 in these cell lines by over-expressing these variants\nin H9c2 myoblasts. ATIP1 is the most studied ATIP vari-\ninduced ERK2 activation and insulin receptor\nautophosphorylation.36 Moreover, loss or down-regulation\nof ATIP1 mRNA expression promotes cell proliferation in\nsome tissues.37,41 In our previous studies in prostate cancer\ncell lines, over-expression of ATIP1 significantly decreased\nbasal levels of ERK2 phosphorylation and EGF-induced\nERK2 phosphorylation was attenuated compared to control\ntransfected prostate cancer cells.46 By contrast, over-\nexpression of ATIP1 in rat H9c2 myoblasts did not affect\nbasal levels of ERK2 activation, nor did it significantly\ninhibit the ability of EGF to stimulate ERK2 phosphoryla-\ntion in these cells (Figures 5(a) and (b)). This was not sur-\nprising, however, as we have previously reported that the\neffects of ATIP1 over-expression are dependent on the co-\nexpression of the AT2-receptor,36 and our mRNA expres-\nsion studies suggest that H9c2 myoblasts contain little to no\nAT2-receptors (Table 2).\nWe also examined the effect of ATIP3 over-expression in\nH9c2 myoblasts, the most highly expressed ATIP variant in\nthese cells, as to date there are little published data available\nregarding the function and expression of this variant, par-\nticularly in cardiac cells. What is known is that ATIP3\nexpression decreases in invasive breast tumours,44 and over-\nexpression of this variant, much like the effects of ATIP1\nover-expression in normal36 and prostate cancer cells,46\nreduces cell division.44 Moreover, ATIP3 has been shown to\nbe a mitotic spindle-associated protein in breast cancer cells\nand prolongs mitosis.44 In the current study we demon-\nstrated that in H9c2 myoblasts, consistent with its action in\nbreast cancer cells,44 ATIP3 over-expression attenuated the\neffects of EGF on ERK2 phosphorylation compared to con-\ntrol transfected myoblasts (Figure 5(c) and (d)).\nDue to the limitations of the cell lines used, it is difficult\nto determine the relevance of the present study to humans.\nAlthough ATIP mRNA is expressed in normal human heart,\nalbeit at relatively low levels compared to other tissues,\nwith the predominantly expressed ATIP variants being\nATIP1 and ATIP3a,38 the levels of ATIP expression in dis-\neased hearts have not been investigated and it is therefore\nnot known whether cardiacATIP levels increase or decrease\nfollowing the onset of cardiovascular disease. In spite of\nthese shortcomings, the current study suggests that ATIP3\nmay at least have a role in myocardial homeostasis and the\nevidence indicating increased AT2-receptor expression fol-\nlowing the development of cardiac hypertrophy possibly\nsuggests that ATIP1 may also have a role in regulating car-\ndiac growth.\nIn conclusion, the present study has identified for the\nfirst time ATIP protein and mRNA expression in rat H9c2\nmyoblasts and myotubules. In addition, Ang II-induced\nhypertrophy in these cell lines appears to be primarily\nmediated via activation of the AT1-receptor. In H9c2 myo-\nblasts, which do not contain AT2-receptors, ATIP1-over\nexpression had no effect on either basal or EGF-stimulated\nlevels of ERK2 activation, whereas over-expression of\nATIP3 retarded the ability of EGF to activate ERK2 phos-\nphorylation, possibly indicating that ATIP3 can influence\ncell growth and hypertrophy independently of the AT2-\nreceptor. These results suggest that ATIP3 and possibly\nATIP1, following the re-expression of the AT2-receptor\nwhich occurs following the onset of cardiac disease, play a\nrole in growth factor-induced cardiac myoblast hypertro-\nphy and growth, and further exploration of the underlying\nmechanisms of their action warrants further investigation.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis work has been kindly supported by the Austin\nMedical Research Foundation and the University of\nMelbourne.\nReferences\n1.
