A waiver from the\ninstitutional review boards was received as an exempt\nstudy.\nFull details of survey methodology, including sampling,\ninterview, examination, laboratory measurements, mortal-\nity linkage, ethics approval, and informed consent, are de-\nscribed elsewhere.35 Briefly, the survey used a complex,\nstratified, multistage probability sample design. NHANES\nIII oversampled certain subgroups of people, including\nlow-income persons, adolescents, older adults, African\nAmericans, and Mexican Americans. Because physical\nand laboratory examinations occurred in mobile examin-\nation centers, inclement weather was a challenge during\ndata collection. To avoid this challenge and improve re-\nsponse, the NHANES preferentially scheduled data collec-\ntion in the lower latitudes (farther south) during winter\nmonths and higher latitudes (farther north) in the summer\nNHANES III collected household interview data, in-\ncluding demographic characteristics and data on health and\ntory examination in a mobile examination center or at a\nhome visit. Participants without reported serum 25(OH)D\nmeasurements (216 missing) and valid mortality data (7\nmissing) were excluded. Poverty:income ratio (ratio of a\nfamily's income to the poverty threshold of a family of the\nsame size) was used to assess socioeconomic status; 463\nparticipants without data for this important covariate were\nlion older U.S. adults, were included in the final analysis.\nSerum 25(OH)D levels were similar for excluded and an-\nalyzed participants (data not shown).\nDefinition of Study Variables\nFrom the household interview data, information on self-\nreported age, sex, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic sta-\ntus, as measured according to the poverty-income ratio was\nanalyzed. Smoking history (current smoking and pack-\nyears), current asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease (emphysema or chronic bronchitis) diagnosis from\nself-reported history were included. Physical activity was\nmeasured in total metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) and\ncalculated as the sum of leisure-time physical activities re-\nported during the prior month (as measured for each ac-\ntivity by the product of intensity rating, in METS, and\nfrequency of activity during the month). Factors that are\nknown to be associated with serum 25(OH)D,31 but with-\nout a clear direct relationship to mortality, such as milk\nintake and vitamin D supplementation, were not included\nin the models because of collinearity.\nFrom the examination data, body mass index was\ncalculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square\nheight in meters. Hypertension was defined as self-reported\nphysician-diagnosed hypertension, average systolic blood\npressure greater than 140 mmHg at baseline, or average\ndiastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg at baseline.\nOne to three blood pressure measurements were made at\nthe baseline data collection. Diabetes mellitus was defined\nas self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus (ex-\ncept gestational diabetes only), fasting (48 hours) blood\nglucose of 126 mg/dL or greater at baseline, or nonfasting\nblood glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater at baseline. Hyper-\nlipidemia was defined as self-reported physician-diagnosed\nhigh cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\ngreater.\nBlood samples collected during the examination were\ncentrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen to \u00c0 701C on site and\nshipped on dry ice to central laboratories, where they were\nstored at \u00c0 701C until analysis. The National Center for\nEnvironmental Health (Atlanta, GA) measured serum\n25(OH)D levels using a radioimmunoassay kit after ex-\ntraction with acetonitrile (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN). The\ndate of the examination and laboratory data collection was\nused to most accurately adjust for the effect of season on\nserum 25(OH)D levels. Estimated glomerular filtration rate\nwas calculated using the abbreviated Modification in Diet\nin Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Serum creatinine\nmeasurements were calibrated to the MDRD standard by\nsubtracting 0.23 mg/dL from NHANES III values, as pre-\nviously described.37\nVital Status and Cause of Death\nMortality outcomes were collected by matching National\nDeath Index screen or death certificate data from the time of\nclassified as ``dead'' or, for all participants without a prob-\nabilistic match, ``presumed alive.'' The underlying cause of\ndeath was coded using the International Classification of\ncodes for comparability. CVD mortality was defined as\ncauses of death.\nThe primary outcome for the cohort was all-cause\nmortality during the follow-up period, and the secondary\noutcome was CVD mortality. It was attempted to analyze\ncancer and infection-related mortality, but the number of\nobservations was too small for meaningful analysis; thus,\nnon-CVD mortality was used as a second category for cause\nof death.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using Stata 9.0 (Stata-\nCorp., College Station, TX). Using survey commands,\nthe recommended subsample weights for the interview\nplus examination data were applied to account for un-\nequal probabilities of selection and to accurately repre-\nsent estimates for the U.S. population. All results are\npresented as weighted values. Variance was calculated\nbased on NHANES-provided masked variance units,\nusing the Taylor Series linearization method. All P-values\nwere two-tailed, with Po.05 considered statistically\nsignificant.\nFor the primary analysis, serum 25(OH)D levels were\nwhich were chosen a priori based on previously reported\n25(OH)D thresholds for improving general health.1,38 It\nis likely that consistency of thresholds in the literature,\nrather than using percentiles (which vary from study to\nstudy), facilitates integration of multiple studies in the lit-\nerature, although a secondary analysis of 25(OH)D deciles\nhas also been included to evaluate linearity of observed\nassociations.\nProportions and means with 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs) were calculated for the selected covariates, according\nto 25(OH)D strata. Univariate associations were deter-\nmined between characteristics and 25(OH)D levels using\nthe Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables and\nanalysis of variance for continuous variables. The associ-\nation between each covariate and mortality outcomes was\nevaluated using simple (unadjusted) Cox proportional haz-\nards analysis.\nThe primary analysis focused on the association be-\ntween baseline serum 25(OH)D level and all-cause, CVD,\nand non-CVD mortality during follow-up using multivari-\nable Cox proportional hazards models. Three different\nmultivariable models were used, specified a priori, to test\nfor the independent effect of serum 25(OH)D levels on\nmortality. The first model adjusted for age, sex, and race or\nethnicity (all important in adjustment of mortality rates)\nand season (important in adjustment of 25(OH)D levels).\nBuilding on the first model, the second model added other\npotential confounders: poverty: income ratio, region, body\nmass index, physical activity, smoking status, cigarette pack\nyears, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and\nrenal function. This model was considered to be fully ad-\njusted for subsequent analyses. The third model added po-\ntential intermediates to help explain the observed\nassociations, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus,\nhyperlipidemia, history of myocardial infarction, history\nof stroke, and history of cancer (nonskin). Finally, effect\nmodification by covariates on the associations between\n25(OH)D and mortality were formally tested for by adding\ninteraction terms to the adjusted models.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the weighted NHANES III sample, strat-\nified according to baseline 25(OH)D level, are summarized\nWomen, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans had\nlower 25(OH)D levels. Lower socioeconomic status, winter\nseason, Midwest region, lower physical activity, hyperten-\nsion, diabetes mellitus, and history of stroke were also\nassociated with lower 25(OH)D levels.\nDuring the median 7.3 years of follow-up, there were\n726 non-CVD deaths could not be further stratified ac-\ncording to other causes (e.g., cancer, infection) for valid\nanalysis because of the small number of individual obser-\nvations. The association between baseline characteristics\nand all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality are presented\nin Table 2. Baseline 25(OH)D level, older age, diabetes\nmellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and history of\nstroke were most strongly associated with CVD and all-\ncause mortality (all Po.05).\nIn the multivariable models (Table 3), baseline serum\n25(OH)D level maintained an independent association with\nall-cause mortality, even after controlling for potential con-\nfounders and intermediate variables. Additionally, the\nKaplan-Meier curves (Figure 1A) demonstrates an imme-\ndiate and sustained divergence of mortality risk between\n25(OH)D strata. Stratification of the mortality outcome\nsuggested that the association was stronger for CVD than\nfor non-CVD mortality (Figure 1B, C).\nThere appeared to be a dose-response association with the\nlargest risk in the lowest 25(OH)D stratum (o25.0nmol/L).\nAdditionally, analysis according to deciles suggests that the\nassociation between 25(OH)D and mortality is linear in the\nrange from 0 to 120 nmol/L (Figure 2), and baseline\n25(OH)D levels analyzed as a continuous and linear vari-\nable had a strong inverse association with mortality risk\n10-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D). The association be-\ntween 25(OH)D and all-cause mortality was stronger in\nparticipants with diabetes mellitus at baseline than in those\ntion 5 .02). There was no other statistically significant in-\nteraction between covariates and the associations between\n25(OH)D and all-cause or CVD mortality (data not\nshown).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study demonstrated a significant inverse association\nbetween baseline serum 25(OH)D level and mortality risk\nin older adults. The association was strong (two time\ngreater odds of mortality for 25(OH)D level o25.0 nmol/L)\nand appeared linear within the range of the data and in-\ndependent of demographic factors and other common CVD\nand mortality risk factors. Additional strengths of the study\ninclude the generalizability of this large, diverse, nationally\nrepresentative sample, the robust measurement of covari-\nates, and the quality of the mortality follow-up data.\nThese results are consistent with several recent reports\nthat link vitamin D insufficiency with CVD,8\u00ad12 CVD mor-\nthe existing literature in that the cohort already was at high\nrisk for mortality, with an overall mortality rate of 44%\nduring the median 7.3 years of follow-up. For instance, this\nrate was higher than recently reported (14% over median\nfollow-up11). A nested case-control study of hemodialysis\npatients, a group that is also at higher risk for mortality,\nfound that lower baseline 25(OH)D levels were associated\nwith higher 90-day mortality.24 Given the aging population,\nand that even a small reduction in mortality could have a\nsubstantial effect on public health, the potential importance\nof these findings is large. Additionally, a stronger associa-\ntion was found between vitamin D and all-cause mortality\nin older adults with diabetes mellitus than in those without.\nThese results differ from those reported previously25 in\ntheir more-general look at the NHANES III data for adults\naged 20 and older. This age-specific difference may be re-\nlated to higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, vitamin D\ninsufficiency, or mortality in the older cohort in the current\nstudy and requires further study.\nThe association between vitamin D and mortality was\nparticularly robust in participants with baseline 25(OH)D\nAlthough these subgroups represented 26% of the current\ncohort, epidemiological data suggests that vitamin D in-\nsufficiency is increasing in the U.S. population. For instance,\nit was recently reported that the proportion of older U.S.\nadults with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 25 nmol/L\nTable 1.

Similarly, the percentage of adults with levels of\ncause exposure to UVB rays is the primary determinant of\nvitamin D status in humans,1 it is likely that decreases in\noutdoor physical activity and widespread campaigns for\nsunscreen use have contributed to the recently observed\npopulation increase in vitamin D insufficiency.31 Thus, it is\nTable 2.

The only clinical trial of vitamin D in the\ngeneral U.S. population, the Women's Health Study, failed\nto detect any effect of vitamin D and calcium supplement-\nation on CVD mortality and morbidity,48 although that\nstudy used a low-dose vitamin D supplementation (400 IU/d)\nand had several methodological concerns.49 A recent meta-\nanalysis of 18 randomized controlled trials on bone health\nmostly due to CVD and infection-related mortality.26\nHigher dose supplementation (e.g., 3000 IU/d), which\nmay be given safely in monthly dosing,50 is more likely to\nU.S. adults and thus may have more-impressive effects on\nCVD and all-cause mortality.\nThere are several potential limitations to this study.\nSerum was collected at only one point in time and pre-\nferentially collected in northern states in the summer\nand southern states in the winter, although age and season\nwere controlled for, which limits the potential for biased\nTable 3.

This prospective cohort was an observational study;\nthus, the causality of the association between vitamin D\nand mortality requires further study. The study attempted\nto address this shortcoming by controlling for known\nconfounders, but unmeasured confounding could exist.\nFor instance, although common conditions associated\nwith CVD and mortality were adjusted for, lower 25(OH)D\nlevels may be a nonspecific marker of poor general\nhealth, and thus, vitamin D insufficiency may identify\nindividuals who are less likely to go outdoors and produce\nvitamin D from sunlight exposure. Large randomized\ncontrolled trials of vitamin D supplementation are required\nto enhance causal inference. Finally, it was not possible\nto evaluate individual non-CVD mortality causes of mor-\ntality (e.g., cancer, infection) because of limited statistical\npower.\nIn summary, in noninstitutionalized older adults, a\ngroup at high risk for mortality, baseline serum 25(OH)D\nlevels had an independent, inverse association with\nCVD and all-cause mortality. Individuals with baseline\n25(OH)D levels less than 50.0 nmol/L appear to be at high-\nest risk for mortality, but levels of 100.0 nmol/L or greater\nmay be necessary for better survival. Current dosage rec-\nommendations for vitamin D supplementation appear to be\ninadequate in most older adults to support these higher\n25(OH)D levels that are associated with optimal general\nhealth and reduced mortality. Randomized controlled trials\nof higher-dose vitamin D supplementation in older adults\nare warranted to determine whether this association is\ncausal and reversible.\n"
