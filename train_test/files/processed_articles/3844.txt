    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe examined whether locus of control (LOC) moderates the apparent relationship between perfectionism and postpartum\ndepression (PPD). It was predicted that external LOC would moderate the relationship between self-oriented perfectionism\nand PPD, and socially prescribed perfectionism and PPD. A sample of 243 women completed an online self-report questionnaire\nassessing perfectionism, LOC, and PPD. Self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism were significantly associated\nwith PPD. Increased personal loci of control (i.e., low external LOC and high internal LOC) moderated (strengthened)\nthe relationship between perfectionism and PPD. LOC may be an important concept and one of the underlying factors at\nwork in the perfectionism\u00adPPD relationship. This outcome may be attributed to the self-directed nature of self-oriented\nperfectionists.\n",

PPD\nsymptoms mirror major depression and include pervasive\nlow mood, sleep disturbances, weight changes, poor cop-\ning, impaired concentration, anxiety, feelings of worthless-\nness or guilt, and reduced confidence and self-esteem\nsymptoms may reduce the mother's parenting capacity,\nand her PPD symptoms may persist into a major depres-\nsive disorder (Post and Antenatal Depression Association,\n2013). Consequently, the infant can suffer lifelong effects\nleading to an insecure attachment, impaired socioemo-\ntional functioning, attention deficits, and behavioral dis-\nturbances (Chabrol & Callahan, 2007). Many women fail\nto seek a treatment for PPD, however, believing their\nsymptoms are those typical of the baby blues (Post and\nAntenatal Depression Association, 2013). The baby blues\nare characterized by transient symptoms that usually pass\nwithin 2 weeks post birth, whereas PPD symptoms are\nmore pervasive and have a greater impact on the mother\nand child. While the literature is rich for certain types of\nrisk factors, other areas remain underresearched. For\nexample, perfectionism and locus of control (LOC) are\ntwo factors that, despite associations with PPD, have been\nlargely neglected.\nPerfectionism remains a contentious concept, although\ngrowing consensus suggests it is characterized by the setting\nof high standards coupled with extreme self-critical evalua-\nels, perfectionism is considered adaptive and linked to\npositive affect (Frost, Heimberg, Holt, Mattia, & Neubauer,\n1993), while at high levels, it is considered maladaptive and\na risk factor for depression (Dimitrovsky, Levy-Shiff, &\nSchattner-Zanany, 2002). A common conceptualization\ndivides perfectionism into three dimensions. Self-oriented\nperfectionism is characterized by the standards one holds for\nthe self; socially prescribed perfectionism is defined by the\nstandards one thinks society holds for them; and other-ori-\nented perfectionism is characterized by the standards one\napproach is taken in the present study.\nPositive associations have been identified between self-\noriented perfectionism and depression (Hewitt & Flett,\n1991a), and between socially prescribed perfectionism and\ndepression (Shafran & Mansell, 2001).

Jackman1, Einar B. Thorsteinsson1,\nand Dominic G. McNeil1\n Keywords\nperfectionism, locus of control, postpartum depression, socially prescribed, self-orientated\n2 SAGE Open\n(1991a) claimed that both dimensions are pivotal to predict-\ning depression. It is argued that self-oriented perfectionists\ngenerate their own failures as they tend to set unrealistically\nhigh standards and stringently critique their performance,\nwhich leads to increased failure. Ashby, Rice, and Martin\n(2006) supported this claim by identifying moderate to\nstrong effect sizes (r = .38-.68) for maladaptive perfection-\nism (defined as self-oriented perfectionism) and major\ndepression. The researchers concluded that self-worth and\nself-criticism play a central role for perfectionists with\ndepression. While this research has focused on the link\nbetween perfectionism and depression, there is suggestion of\na similar relationship between perfectionism and PPD (e.g.,\nHain, Louwen, & Schermelleh-Engel, 2016). For example,\nMazzeo et al. (2006) identified a link between socially pre-\ntwins. The perfectionism\u00adPPD relationship also has to be\nunderstood in relation to perceptions of LOC as it may have\nimportant implications for identifying women at risk of PPD.\nLOC is characterized as an individual's perceived ability\nto exercise control over the outcome of life events (Rotter,\n1966). The theory purports that people with an internal LOC\n(\"internals\") believe they are in control of the outcomes in\ntheir life, whereas people with an external LOC (\"externals\")\nbelieve their life outcomes are left up to chance/fate (Rotter,\n1966). External LOC was later expanded to include an addi-\ntional dimension of \"powerful others,\" whereby control is\nplaced with other people such as parents, teachers, or doctors\n(Levenson, 1973). Internals do not have greater control over\ntheir life, just the perception that they do, consequently, they\nare more emotionally adjusted, whereas externals feel pow-\nerless to achieve their outcomes. Dimitrovsky, Perez-\nHirshberg, and Itskowitz (1987) concluded that externals\nmay be more sensitive to external influences and have\nextreme responses to critical life events such as childbirth.\nPerfectionism theory purports that high level self-oriented\nperfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism are mal-\nadaptive (Hamachek, 1978) due to self-oriented perfection-\nists generating their own failures and socially prescribed\nperfectionists experiencing cognitive dissonance (Hewitt &\nFlett, 1991a). LOC theory characterizes externals as mal-\nadaptive, as externals feel powerless (Rotter, 1966). Thus,\nthe concept of uncontrollability exists both in the literature\nfor LOC (external) and perfectionism (socially prescribed\nperfectionism). Despite this theoretical connection between\nmaladaptive perfectionism and LOC, few studies have inves-\ntigated this relationship alongside PPD.\nEmpirical evidence shows that socially prescribed perfec-\ntionism, self-oriented perfectionism, and external LOC are\nall independently linked with PPD (Hewitt & Flett, 1991a).\nHewitt and Flett (1991b) found external LOC to be posi-\ntively associated with socially prescribed perfectionism, r =\n.20. They asserted that self-oriented perfectionists with inter-\nnal LOC can be proactive in changing their standards,\nwhereas socially prescribed perfectionists with external LOC\nare more reactive (Hewitt & Flett, 1991b). Recent studies\nhave found similar results between maladaptive perfection-\nism and high levels of external LOC (Periasamy & Ashby,\nThe present study investigates (a) the associations\nbetween perfectionism, LOC, and PPD; and (b) whether\nLOC moderates the relationship between perfectionism and\nPPD. It is hypothesized that both self-oriented and socially\nprescribed perfectionism will be positively correlated with\nPPD and external LOC will be positively correlated with\nPPD. It is also hypothesized that LOC acts as a moderator on\nthe perfectionism and PPD relationship. Finally, it is pre-\ndicted that high internal LOC and low external LOC will\nreduce the impact of socially prescribed perfectionism and\nself-oriented perfectionism on PPD.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA sample of 326 female participants, including those who\nhad recently given birth to those 9 months postpartum, par-\nticipated anonymously in the present study. Eighty-one\n(24.8%) participants were excluded from the final analyses\ndue to not completing all components of the questionnaires,\nthe sample (e.g., percentage postpartum, education, and rela-\ntionship status).\nMaterials\nThe demographic questionnaire included questions pertain-\ning to participants' age, sex, location, education level, mari-\ntal status, and history of depression.\nThe Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox,\nHolden, & Sagovsky, 1987) is designed to screen the likeli-\nhood of PPD and suicidality in postpartum women. It is a\n10-item scale with each item answered on a 4-point Likert-\ntype scale ranging from 0 to 3 with anchors varied in line\nwith the different questions (e.g., yes, most of the time to\nhardly at all). Participants respond to statements about how\nthey felt over the last 7 days. A score of 9 or below is consid-\nered unlikely to have PPD; 10 to 12, possible PPD; and 13 or\nabove, as likely PPD (Cox et al., 1987). The scale has high\nThe internal consistency for the current sample was excel-\nThe Hewitt and Flett Multidimensional Perfectionism\nmeasuring three subscales: Self-Oriented, Socially\nPrescribed, and Other-Oriented Perfectionism. Statements\nare answered on a 6-point Likert-type scale from 1 (disagree)\nJackman et al. 3\nto 6 (agree). Higher scores on any one dimension indicate\nunhealthier perfectionistic attitudes and behaviors. The\nHP-MPS is a reliable measure of the severity of perfection-\nism dimensions, and has adequate concurrent validity and\nstrong test\u00adretest reliability. Using Cronbach's alpha, the\ninternal consistency for the three dimensions in the current\nsample was excellent for the Self-Oriented Perfectionism\nsubscale ( = .93), Socially Prescribed ( = .88), and Other-\nOriented Perfectionism dimensions ( = .81).\nThe Internal-External Locus of Control Scale (Levenson,\n1973) is designed to determine LOC across three dimensions\nof internal, external (chance/fate), and powerful others. The\n24-item instrument consists of a series of attitude statements\nthat represent commonly held opinions. Participants rate\ndifferent statements on a 6-point Likert-type scale from -3\n(strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree). There are eight\nitems on each of the three subscales; the higher the score on\na dimension, the more likely that dimension is upheld.\nTwenty-four points were added to each score to reflect the 24\nitems. The scale has good construct validity (Levenson,\n1973). The internal consistency for the scales are considered\nmoderate to good and range between  = .64 and  = .78\n(Richardson, Field, Newton, & Bendell, 2012). For the cur-\nrent sample, the internal scale was acceptable ( = 66), and\ngood for the external ( = .77) and powerful others scales (\nProcedure\nEthical approval was obtained from the relevant university\nbody (approval code HE14-126). Participants were recruited\nover a period of 12 weeks from social media channels (e.g.,\npostnatal depression support websites such as PANDA and\nparenting forums on social media such as Canberra Mummy,\nBaby Centre, and Essential Baby), and PPD support organi-\nzations/groups with the facilitator's permission (e.g., posters\nin community-based parenting clinics). Participants pro-\nvided implied consent before commencing the surveys. The\ntesting materials for this project were conducted using an\nonline self-report questionnaire in English hosted by\nQualtricsTM Software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). The order of\nthe questionnaires involved the demographics questionnaire\nfollowed by the EPDS, HP-MPS, and LOC. At the conclu-\nsion of the questionnaire, participants were thanked for their\nparticipation and provided with information about PPD sup-\nport services. The data used in this study have been made\npublicly available (Jackman, Thorsteinsson, & McNeil,\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were run using SPSS (version 21).

The interaction, however, was not significant (raw b =\n-0.005, p = .13). Therefore, powerful others LOC did not act as\na moderator between self-oriented perfectionism and PPD.\nDiscussion\nSelf-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism were\npositively correlated with PPD, supporting the views\nthat high levels of self-oriented or socially prescribed\nperfectionism is a determinant to increased risk of hav-\ning PPD. This outcome also corresponds to previous\nresearch that suggested high levels of self-oriented and\nsocially prescribed perfectionism may be maladaptive\nand linked to depression (Shafran & Mansell, 2001).\nThere were also relationships between LOC and PPD in\nthe expected directions. There was only a weak relation-\nship between external LOC and PPD, but there were\nmoderate significant negative association between inter-\nnal LOC and PPD, and a moderate positive association\nbetween the powerful others LOC and PPD. As powerful\nothers LOC is an externally based dimension, these\nresults collectively signify a decreased likelihood of\nPPD for people who perceive themselves to be in control\ncompared with people who consider external factors\nresponsible for their life.\nFigure 1.

Participants with low external LOC had\na low likelihood of PPD, but only when they were low on\nperfectionism. In contrast, participants with high external\nLOC had a high likelihood of PPD, irrespective of their level\nof perfectionism. Internal LOC strengthened the relationship\nbetween perfectionism and PPD. Powerful others LOC had a\nsimilar relationship with socially oriented perfectionism and\nPPD as external LOC, an unsurprising result given they are\nboth externally based loci of control.\nThe moderation is consistent with the perfectionism\nsupports the claim that perfectionism at high levels is mal-\nadaptive (Hamachek, 1978), as shown by the positive asso-\nciation between self-oriented and social-prescribed\nperfectionism and PPD. It appears this relationship only\nmanifests when external LOC is high or when internal LOC\nis low. This outcome reinforces Rotter's (1966) argument\nthat internals are more emotionally adjusted than externals. It\nis possible that self-oriented perfectionists align their self-\nworth with their performance; therefore, when little control\nis perceived, they are more likely to have PPD (Hewitt &\nFlett, 1991a). Socially prescribed perfectionists may fear\nsocietal failure and experience cognitive dissonance, which\nin turn makes them more vulnerable to depressive episodes\nwhen minimal control is perceived (Hewitt & Flett, 1991a).\nThus, it is possible that perfectionists may be protected by\ntheir internal LOC and that they are, consequently, less likely\nto have PPD.\nSocially prescribed and self-oriented perfectionism had\nsimilar relationships with LOC but this goes against\nexpectations. The association between self-oriented per-\nfectionism and LOC provides support for the literature\n(Hewitt & Flett, 1991a). However, the socially oriented\nperfection and LOC relationship outcome contradicts pre-\nvious research (Periasamy & Ashby, 2002; Stewart & De\nGeorge-Walker, 2013), where socially prescribed perfec-\ntionism was positively associated with internal LOC and\nnegatively associated with external LOC. It is possible\nthat socially prescribed perfectionists experience cogni-\ntive dissonance and attempt to reduce the discrepancy\nbetween their \"ideal\" and \"actual selves\" by perceiving an\ninternal LOC (Festinger, 1957). While this explanation is\nplausible, it is more likely that these similarities are due to\nthe perfectionism dimensions being similar constructs\nresulting in a high correlation (r = .90). Previous studies\nhave found mixed results with some finding overlapping\nbetween self-oriented and socially prescribed perfection-\nism (Hewitt & Flett, 1991b), while others finding them\ndifferentiated (Shafran & Mansell, 2001). These varia-\ntions in outcome highlight the limitations of the perfec-\ntionism literature failing to delineate clear dimensions of\nperfectionism.\nLimitations\nThe results of the present study are bound by the limitations\ntypical of cross-sectional self-report study designs. Some\nwomen may have underestimated their symptoms due to a\nsocial desirability bias (Boyce, 2003), while others may have\noverestimated their symptoms due to a demand characteris-\ntics bias (Gelabert et al., 2012). Information about previous\nhistory of diagnosed depression (\"Do you have a history of\ndiagnosed depression?\") was sought in the survey. However,\nanalyses controlling for previous history of depression were\nnot conducted as such analyses would be underpowered as\nthe sample size would effectively be halved. The partici-\npants' mental health literacy levels may also have affected\nthe outcome (Thorsteinsson, Loi, & Moulynox, 2014) as\nwell as their beliefs and attitudes toward mental illness\n(Gibbons, Thorsteinsson, & Loi, 2015). However, the effi-\ncient nature of the self-report questionnaires contributed to a\nlarge sample being recruited. Furthermore, the question-\nnaires used were reliable and valid suggesting that the data\ncollected are indicative of the concepts being investigated.\nFuture Research\nFuture research investigating the triad relationship between\nperfectionism, LOC, and PPD should include a longitudinal\ndesign that recruits pregnant women to determine if the rela-\ntionship changes during pregnancy and through the postpar-\ntum period. There is a need to increase our understanding in\nthe clinical realm of how perfectionism and LOC interact to\npotentially contribute to PPD, which may lead to women\nbeing screened for perfectionism during pregnancy. Future\nstudies might also measure time since delivery to examine if\nthis interval has any impact on PPD relationships.\nConclusion\nThe results indicate that a complex yet intuitive relationship\nbetween LOC, perfectionism, and PPD exists. LOC exacer-\nbates the perfectionism and PPD relationship indicating\nwomen at risk of PPD are those who have self-oriented and\nsocially prescribed perfectionism with high external LOC or\nlow internal LOC. These results may be attributed to the self-\ndirected nature of self-oriented perfectionists. Powerful oth-\ners had a similar moderating relationship to external LOC on\nsocially prescribed perfectionism and PPD. This may be due\nto these two loci of control being externally based. The asso-\nciation that LOC strengthens the relationship between per-\nfectionism and PPD may be an important factor in the\nlikelihood of PPD occurring, and is a relationship that merits\nfurther investigation.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nJackman et al. 7\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
