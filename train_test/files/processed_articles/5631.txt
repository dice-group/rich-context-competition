Specifically, 28.6% or 18.9 million people eligible for Medicaid/CHIP and 17.1% or 5.5\nmillion people who appeared likely to shop for a QHP did not have high-speed Internet in the home. For both the Medicaid/\nCHIP eligible and those likely to shop for a QHP, the proportion of people living in households without Internet varied\nsubstantially by race, geography, and other socio-demographic characteristics.\n",

The online Marketplaces\nfacilitate eligibility determination for Medicaid/Children's\nHealth Insurance Program (CHIP) and for tax credits that\nsubsidize private insurance. They also provide a central loca-\ntion to compare and shop for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs).\nDuring the 2015 open enrollment period, the Marketplaces\ntelephone contacts.1\nThe online Marketplaces appear to have been successful\nat attracting visitors, but people without Internet in the home\nface additional application burdens that could dissuade appli-\ncation and enrollment. The \"digital divide\" has narrowed in\nrecent years, but there are still gaps in residential Internet\nthat could cause barriers to health plan enrollment under the\nACA.2,3 Only one previous study, to our knowledge, has\nexamined Internet availability among populations targeted\nby the online Marketplaces.4 That study, a 2013 survey spon-\nsored by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), found that\nnot easily access the Internet from home or another location,\ncompared with 98% of those with income above 400% of the\nFederal Poverty Level (FPL).\nThe KFF study suggested that a substantial share of adults\nwho could likely benefit from an online Marketplace lacked\neasy access to the Internet. However, the study had limita-\ntions. The survey excluded children even though children are\nan important population served by the online Marketplaces.\nChildren could have different levels of Internet availability\ngiven that they tend to live in poorer households compared\nwith childless adults.5 Compared with large federal surveys,\nthe KFF study had a moderately sized sample (n = 8762).\nFurthermore, 50% of their sample was concentrated in\nCalifornia, Missouri, and Texas. The authors were unable to\nexamine how Internet access varied across different demo-\ngraphic groups.

Boudreaux, University of Maryland, School of Public Health\nEmail: mhb@umd.edu\nrisk of lacking Internet is important for tailoring ACA out-\nreach to specific consumer groups.\nThis article expands on the KFF study using new data\nfrom recently added questions on the American Community\nSurvey (ACS). Using these data, we estimate the number\n(and percentage) of people who lack residential high-speed\nInternet, within populations that otherwise appear likely to\nbenefit from an online Marketplace. For those who do report\nresidential Internet, we estimate the share that relies exclu-\nsively on a mobile connection. Not only do those who rely\nsolely on mobile connections tend to have less stable access\nto the Internet due to data limits and service interruptions,6\nbut applying for and choosing a plan from a mobile devise\n(when a Marketplace is mobile compatible) might pose\nunique challenges as well. For example, whereas 35% of all\nHealthCare.gov visits were from a mobile device, only 15%\nof consumers who signed up for coverage during the second\nenrollment period did so through a mobile device.7 This sug-\ngests that consumers may find mobile enrollment difficult.\nFinally, we leverage the large sample size of the ACS (n =\navailability varies across subgroups, before and after adjust-\ning for covariates. Our results inform ongoing outreach\nactivities and speak to how recent proposals to subsidize\nInternet access could have important implications for health\npolicy initiatives.\nMethods\nData come from the 2013 ACS--a household survey con-\nducted annually by the US Census Bureau. In 2013, the\nCensus Bureau added new questions that assessed the pres-\nence and type of residential Internet service (eg, dial-up,\ncable, mobile).2 We used these new data to identify people\nwho did not have high-speed Internet in the home. We\nfocused on high-speed Internet because the constraints\nimposed by dial-up service are often prohibitive.\nWe identified two distinct groups of non-elderly individu-\nals (aged 0-64) deemed most likely to benefit from the online\nMarketplaces: those enrolled or otherwise eligible for\nMedicaid and those who appeared likely to shop for a QHP.\nBoth groups were defined using information on health insur-\nance coverage held on the day of interview and annual fam-\nily income. Family income was obtained by summing\npersonal income within health insurance units--a collection\nof related individuals who could be covered under the same\nprivate health insurance plan (ie, a nuclear family).\nThe first group was composed of non-elderly people who\nwere either currently enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP or appeared\neligible because they were uninsured and had family\nincomes below 2014 state specific Medicaid/CHIP income\nthresholds.8 The income thresholds varied by state and by\ncategorical eligibility type. The eligibility types included\nchildren, pregnant women (identified in the ACS as women\nthat gave birth in the last year), parents, and childless adults.\nThe second group we considered included people who\nappeared likely to shop for a QHP (called \"potential\nMarketplace participants\" in the tables below). We defined\nthis group as people who had incomes above state-specific\nMedicaid/CHIP income thresholds or 100% of poverty,\nwhichever was higher, and were either uninsured or insured\nthrough the individual market. We excluded the population\nbelow 100% of FPL(people not eligible for Medicaid because\nthey lived in a state that had not expanded Medicaid) because\nQHPs are likely unaffordable for this group and they are not\neligible for financial assistance. Finally, we also considered a\nhigher socioeconomic status group--people who had\nemployer-sponsored insurance and family incomes above\n400% of poverty. This group was used as a reference group.\nIn each of these groups, we estimated the number and per-\ncentage of people who lived in a household without high-\nspeed Internet, overall and for selected socio-demographic\ngroups. Our choice of groups was informed by previous\nresearch examining the digital divide. 1,2 Specifically, racial\nminorities, the less educated, those living in rural areas, and\nother traditionally vulnerable groups tend to be less likely to\nhave Internet in the home compared with their counterparts.\nOne of the most important predictors we examine is family\nincome relative to the federal poverty guidelines (FPG).\nEach group has different income distributions by definition\nso we use different poverty levels depending on the group.\nFor the Medicaid/CHIP group, we use 0% to 49%, 50% to\nlabel the categories low, moderate-low, moderate-high, and\nhigh for each group.\nWe report both unadjusted and adjusted rates (ie, pre-\ndicted probabilities scaled to the percent scale) that were\nobtained from logistic regression. Standard errors and statis-\ntical tests were adjusted for the complex sample design of the\nACS.9 We defined statistical significance using a critical\nvalue of 0.05. Like all survey data, ACS estimates are subject\nto non-sampling error. However, the new Internet estimates\ntrack closely with other sources, including widely used data\nfrom the Pew Internet Project.10\nResults\nOverall we found that among all those who could potentially\nbenefit from access to an online Marketplace (\"potential\ntial Internet (Figure 1). More than 1 in 4 non-elderly people\n(18.8 million) who were either currently enrolled or other-\nwise appeared eligible for Medicaid/CHIP lacked high-speed\nInternet in the home. An additional 5.5 million potential\nMarketplace participants lacked residential Internet (17.1%).\nComparatively, having high-speed residential Internet was\nnearly universal for high\u00adsocioeconomic status individuals\nwith employer-sponsored health insurance.\nBoudreaux et al 3\nWe found that roughly 10% of Internet users who were\nMedicaid eligible and 8% of Internet users who were likely\nto participate in a Marketplace depended solely on a mobile\nconnection (data not shown). Comparatively, only 4.7% of\nInternet users in the high\u00adsocioeconomic status group were\nmobile users only.\nBy definition, the Medicaid/CHIP eligible and potential\nMarketplace participants differ according to income. In\nTable 1, we explore other population characteristics for each\nsample. Nearly half of the individuals currently enrolled or\npotentially eligible for Medicaid/CHIP are children, and over\nhalf are also living in households where the householder is\nworking part-time or not working at all. Meanwhile, poten-\ntial Marketplace participants were more likely to be older\nindividuals (35-64 years of age), and they were more likely\nto live in households with only adult residents and to live in\na household where the householder had at least some college\neducation and was working full-time.\nIn Table 2, we show what socio-demographic groups were\nmore and less likely to lack high-speed residential Internet.\nWe present unadjusted and adjusted rates (ie, predicted prob-\nabilities scaled to the percent scale) that were obtained from\nlogistic regressions that controlled for the predictors shown\nin Tables 1 and 2, in addition to a full set of state of residence\ndummies. Controlling for both rural/urban and state of resi-\ndence helps to account for the fact that the supply of Internet\nconnections varies across geography. We omit the coeffi-\ncients on sate of residence to simplify presentation and\nbecause the independent contribution of each state to the pre-\ndicted rate is not our main focus.\nAs shown in the first set of columns in Table 2, older indi-\nviduals (aged 45-64) who were eligible or enrolled in\nMedicaid/CHIP were more likely to lack residential Internet\ncompared with younger individuals, but the relationship\nbetween age and the presence of residential Internet was not\nlinear. For example, there was not much variation by age for\nthose under 45, but then there was a substantial increase for\nthe 45- to 64-year-olds and this relationship remained after\nadjustment.\nNon-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives (AIANs)\nwere 1.8 times more likely to lack residential Internet com-\nNon-Hispanic Asians, however, were significantly less likely\nto lack residential Internet, compared with Non-Hispanic\nwhites. After adjusting for covariates, there remained sub-\nstantial racial disparities in residential Internet in the\nMedicaid/CHIP population, particularly for Non-Hispanic\nblacks, non-Hispanic AIANs and Hispanics. The presence of\nhigh-speed Internet in the home also varied substantially and\nsignificantly by household structure, education, employ-\nment, language ability, and rural status. Differences by citi-\nzenship did not persist after adjustment. Even in this\nrelatively low-income group, family income was predictive\nof home Internet. The lowest income group (below 50% of\nFPL)was 8 percentage points more likely to lack residential\ninternet compared to the highest income group (above 138%\nof poverty).\nThe second set of columns in Table 2 considers the popu-\nlation that appeared likely to shop for a QHP. Although the\noverall share that lacked residential Internet was lower for\nthe QHP population compared with the Medicaid eligible\npopulation, both groups had similar demographic patterns.\nFor example, Non-Hispanic blacks, AIANs, and Hispanics\nwere significantly more likely to lack Internet compared\nwith Non-Hispanic whites. Just over 10% of those with at\nleast some college experience lacked residential Internet\ncompared with 29.9% of those with less than a high school\neducation (P  .05). There were also statistically significant\nFigure 1. Percentage of non-elderly individuals who live in a household without high-speed Internet, by health insurance eligibility\ngroup.\nNote.

These differences remained even after control-\nling for income and for potential differences in supply across\ngeography (as captured by our rural/urban and state of resi-\ndence variables). Our study had limitations. Our data were\nbased on self-reports, and though the ACS has been shown to\nproduce health insurance and income estimates that are of\nequal quality as other surveys,11,12 the quality of the new\nInternet questions has not been as rigorously evaluated. We\nalso did not have individual data on health insurance enroll-\nment facilitated by the Marketplaces so were unable to\ndirectly test the hypothesis that having residential Internet\nincreases the probability of signing up for coverage. That\nremains an important area for future research.As future years\nof the ACS become available, it may be possible to examine\nif the ACA increased insurance coverage in Internet-\nconnected households to a different degree than non-con-\nnected households. However, such work will need to\novercome the fact that a household's Internet status could be\ncorrelated with unobserved factors that also help determine\ninsurance coverage. Simply comparing connected and non-\nconnected households may not represent the causal impact of\nthe Internet.\nMillions of people have gained coverage since the open-\ning of the online Marketplaces in January of 2014, but mil-\nlions of others have yet to sign up.13-15 Those interested in\nobtaining coverage may utilize other application channels\n(eg, phone) or may seek out the Internet away from home.\nHowever, enrolling the remaining eligible will partially\ndepend on minimizing the non-financial costs of application.\nResidential Internet might be the easiest option for many\nconsumers. Stigma associated with calling or visiting a\n\"social-service\" office, travel time, and inconvenient office\nhours are 3 barriers that residential access to online\nMarketplaces could help to alleviate. Our results suggest that\na suite of new initiatives to subsidize Internet for rural popu-\nlations, public housing residents, and other low-income pop-\nulations may play an important role in the ACA.1 However,\nensuring universal access to high-speed residential Internet\nshould not be viewed as a panacea. The groups that we iden-\ntified as being the most at risk of lacking high-speed Internet\n(ie, older, low-income, less educated, linguistically isolated,\nand racial/ethnic populations) are likely to experience mul-\ntiple barriers to enrollment, including financial and time\ncost, misinformation, and distrust. Navigators and applica-\ntion assisters will continue to play important roles in both\ninforming consumers about the benefits of coverage and edu-\ncating them about appropriate health plans given family\ncircumstances.\nFinally, though our interest centered on health insurance\nenrollment under the ACA, the Internet clearly plays a much\nbroader role in population health. The Web is quickly\nbecoming an irreplaceable health resource that is essential\nfor managing personal health records, learning about disease\nsymptoms, and comparing provider quality.16,17 Our results\nhighlight the idea that efforts to achieve health equity should\ninclude minimizing disparities in residential Internet access.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nresearch was supported, in part, by a grant from the Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation to the State Health Access Data Assistance\nCenter.\nReferences\n1.
