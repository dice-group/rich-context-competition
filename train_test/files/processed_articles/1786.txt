Melamed, Paul Muntner, Erin D. Michos, Jaime Uribarri, Collin Weber,\nJyotirmay Sharma, Paolo Raggi\nObjective--The purpose of this study was to determine the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels\nand the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the general United States population.\nMethods and Results--We analyzed data from 4839 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nquartiles of 25(OH)D, from lowest to highest, the prevalence of PAD was 8.1%, 5.4%, 4.9%, and 3.7% (P trend\n0.001). After multivariable adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, physical activity level, and laboratory\nmeasures, the prevalence ratio of PAD for the lowest, compared to the highest, 25(OH)D quartile (17.8 and 29.2\nConclusions--Low serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with a higher prevalence of PAD. Several mechanisms have been\ninvoked in the literature to support a potential antiatherosclerotic activity of vitamin D. Prospective cohort and\nKey Words: 25-hydroxyvitamin D  peripheral arterial disease  phosphate  PTH  cardiovascular disease\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects approximately 5\nmillion US adults, and it is associated with a high risk of\nmorbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease.1,2 Es-\ntablished risk factors for PAD include typical atherosclerosis\nrisk factors such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperten-\nsion, smoking, and reduced kidney function.2,3 In addition,\nnontraditional cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated\nC-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen have been associated\nwith PAD.4\nBasic science research indicates that low vitamin D levels\nmay be linked with cardiovascular risk. Vascular smooth\nmuscle cells possess the 1- hydroxylase enzyme that locally\nactivates circulating vitamin D.5 In animal models, active\nvitamin D is an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system6 and\nmyocardial cell hypertrophy.7 Cellular experiments show that\nactive vitamin D and its analogs exhibit anticoagulant activ-\nity.8 Conflicting data are available on the association between\nlow 25(OH)D levels and cardiovascular disease in the general\nAmong adults, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels\n30 ng/mL are considered optimal.12 These levels are asso-\nciated with reduced fracture rates and have been postulated to\nbe associated with better health outcomes.12 The goal of the\ncurrent study was to evaluate the association between serum\n25(OH)D levels and the prevalence of PAD in the general\npopulation. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed data from a\nnationally representative sample of the United States adult\naddition, elevated serum calcium, phosphate, and intact\nparathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels have been associated with\ncardiovascular disease in the general population.13,14 Because\nthese serum markers are associated with vitamin D levels, we\nassessed the association between these serum markers and\nPAD in a secondary analysis.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nsectional survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized United States\npopulation performed by the National Center for Health Statistics.\nAll participants underwent standardized interviews, physical exam-\ninations, and laboratory testing.

Of relevance to the current\nanalysis, variables collected during the in-home interview included\nage, gender, race-ethnicity, cigarette smoking, education, leisure-\ntime physical activity, and a history of diabetes mellitus and\nmyocardial infarction. For the current analysis, self-reported race-\nethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Mexican-American, and other. Participants who reported\nhaving smoked 100 cigarettes during their lifetime were classified\nas current or former smokers if they answered affirmatively or\nnegatively, respectively, to the question \"Do you smoke cigarettes\nnow?\" Diabetes mellitus was defined as a self-report of a physician\ndiagnosis, not during pregnancy, with concurrent use of oral hypo-\nglycemic or insulin medication. A history of myocardial infarction\nwas based on participants' self-report of a previous physician\ndiagnosis on the medical history questionnaire. Being physically\nactive was defined as participating in 30 or more minutes of\nmoderate or vigorous activity or strength training in the 30 days\npreceding the NHANES visit.\nmeasurement of height, weight, and blood pressure. Body mass\nindex (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height\nin meters squared. Normal weight, overweight, and obesity were\nrespectively. Three blood pressure measurements were taken during\na single examination visit by a physician using a protocol adapted\nfrom the American Heart Association. Based on the average of all 3\nblood pressure measurements, hypertension was defined as systolic\nor diastolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or 90 mm Hg, respectively,\nor self-reported current use of blood pressure lowering medication.\nMedication and supplement use data were obtained for use of statins,\nantihypertensives, antidiabetes medications, and vitamin D supple-\nmentation through questionnaires and pill bottle reviews.\nDetailed descriptions of blood collection and processing proce-\ndures are provided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technolo-\ngists Procedures Manual.15 Serum creatinine concentration was\nmeasured using the modified kinetic method of Jaffe, calibrated to\nthe assays used for the development of the Modification of Diet in\nRenal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, and glomerular filtration\nrate was estimated with the simplified MDRD equation.16 Partici-\npants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min/\n1.73 m2 were considered to have chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nHigh-sensitivity CRP was measured by latex-enhanced nephelome-\ntry. Elevated CRP was defined as 1.0 mg/L. Total plasma homo-\ncysteine levels were measured by the Abbott Homocysteine assay.\nTotal and HDL-cholesterol, serum calcium, and phosphate levels\nwere measured on the Beckman Synchron LX20. Serum calcium was\ncorrected for serum albumin using the formula: adjusted\ncalciummeasured calcium[(4.0serum albumin in g/dL)0.8].\nwere available for analysis in 6984 participants. Serum intact\nparathyroid hormone (iPTH) was measured on an Elecsys 1010\nautoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics) using a electrochemiluminescent\nSerum vitamin D was measured using the Diasorin (formerly Incstar)\n25(OH)D assay. Three levels of control specimens were used to\nassess the quality of each 25(OH)D run. Coefficients of variation for\nserum 25(OH)D remained less than 10% throughout the study\nperiod.\nOutcome\nThe primary outcome for the current study was PAD defined using\nABI. Details of the methods used to measure ABI in NHANES have\nbeen described previously.17 In brief, for participants with at least 1\narm and weighing 400 pounds, systolic blood pressure for the ABI\nwas measured via blood pressure cuffs on the right brachial artery\nand both posterior tibial arteries. For participants aged 40 to 59 years,\n2 measures were taken and averaged at each site, whereas for\nparticipants aged 60 years, 1 measure was taken. For individuals\nwith conditions precluding measurement of the right arm, left\nbrachial artery systolic blood pressure was taken. ABI was calculated\nas the ratio of the average ankle systolic blood pressure to arm\nsystolic blood pressure. The smaller of the 2 measurements was\nconsidered the ABI for this study. Participants with ABI 1.5 may\nhave severe arterial rigidity and were therefore excluded from all\nanalyses (n10). PAD was defined as ABI 0.9.\nStatistical Analysis\nParticipant characteristics were calculated by PAD status. The\nstatistical significance of differences for these characteristics was\ndetermined using least squares and maximum likelihood for contin-\nuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Next, the prevalence\nof PAD was calculated by quartile of 25(OH)D, with the statistical\nsignificance of trends across quartile assessed using maximum\nlikelihood. Prevalence ratios of PAD associated with quartile of\nserum 25(OH)D were calculated using log binomial regression\nmodels. An initial model included adjustment for age, gender, and\nrace-ethnicity with a subsequent model including additional adjust-\nment for education, current and former cigarette smoking, leisure-\ntime physical activity, diabetes mellitus, total to HDL cholesterol\nratio, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, log homocysteine,\nglycohemoglobin, statin use, antihypertensive medication use, vita-\nmin D supplement use, history of myocardial infarction, elevated\nCRP, and chronic kidney disease. To further explore the dose\u00ad\nresponse relationship of 25(OH)D with PAD, we used restricted\nquadratic splines with knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of\nmultivariable-adjusted association between 25(OH)D, as continuous\nvariable, and PAD was determined overall and for subgroups defined\nby age, gender, race-ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, diabetes\nmellitus, a history of myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease,\nand vitamin D supplement use. For analyses as a continuous variable,\nthe prevalence ratio of PAD was calculated for 1 standard deviation\nlower serum 25(OH)D (10 ng/mL). Differences in the association of\n25(OH)D and PAD across subgroup were tested by using a multi-\nplicative term in the regression models. Additionally, the associa-\ntions between serum calcium, phosphate, and iPTH, each modeled\nby quartile and as continuous variables, and PAD were determined.\nData were analyzed using SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research Triangle\nInstitute) to account for the complex NHANES sampling design\nincluding unequal probabilities of selection, oversampling, and\nnonresponse.\nResults\nParticipant Characteristics\nParticipants with PAD were older, more likely to be non-\nHispanic black, have less than a high school education, be a\nformer smoker, and have diabetes mellitus, higher glycohe-\nmoglobin levels, hypertension, a history of myocardial infarc-\ntion, chronic kidney disease, use statins, and have elevated\nhomocysteine and CRP (Table 1). Additionally, those with\nPAD were less likely to be physically active. There was no\ndifference in serum calcium, phosphate, or iPTH levels\nbetween participants with and without PAD. In contrast,\nmean 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower among par-\nAssociations Between Serum 25 (OH) Vitamin D\nLevels and PAD\nA graded association was present between lower 25(OH)D\nlevels and a higher prevalence of PAD (Table 2). This\nassociation was present after age, gender, race-ethnicity, and\nmultivariable adjustment. Compared to their counterparts in\nthe highest 25(OH)D quartile (29.2 ng/mL), participants in\nhttp://atvb.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\ntimes more likely to have PAD, after age, gender, race-\nethnicity, and multivariable adjustment, respectively. In a\nmultivariable adjusted spline regression model, a progressive\nincrease in PAD was evident at lower levels of 25(OH)D\nlevels (Figure 1).\nSubgroup Analysis\nAfter multivariable adjustment, the prevalence ratio of PAD\n25(OH)D and PAD was similar (probability value for inter-\naction 0.10) in all subgroups except physical activity.\nSpecifically, the prevalence ratio of PAD per each 10 ng/mL\nactive, respectively (P interaction0.06).\nAssociations of Serum Calcium, Phosphate, and\niPTH Levels and PAD\nHigher quartiles of serum calcium, phosphate, and iPTH\nlevels were not associated with PAD (Table 3). Additionally,\nmodeled as a continuous variable, there was no association\nbetween serum calcium, phosphate, or iPTH and PAD,\noverall, or in subgroups (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nIn this nationally representative sample of US adults, there\nwas a strong, graded association between lower levels of\n25(OH)D levels and PAD. This association was present after\nadjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors and poten-\ntial confounders. In contrast, no association was present\nbetween elevated serum calcium, phosphate or iPTH levels,\nand PAD in this population.\nTable 1.

Additionally, in another trial,\npatients randomized to ultraviolet light exposure 3 times a\nweek experienced a 180% increase in 25(OH)D levels and\nimproved blood pressure control.21 However, another small\nstudy did not show this effect on blood pressure.22\nThe association of 25(OH)D deficiency with glucose in-\ntolerance23 and the metabolic syndrome24 is another potential\nmechanism for increased cardiovascular disease risk. In 1\nstudy of older adults with impaired fasting glucose, supple-\nmentation with vitamin D and calcium attenuated the pro-\ngression of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.25 However,\nin the current study, a graded association between 25(OH)D\nand PAD remained present after adjustment for diabetes\nmellitus and glycohemoglobin.\nvitamin D\nlevels with cardiovascular events remains controversial. In\nsome studies, low 25(OH)D levels have been associated with\nincreased prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD),9\nstroke,26 and congestive heart failure.27 However, low\n25(OH)D has been associated with a protective association in\nother studies. For example, in a case\u00adcontrol study of 143\npatients with CHD by Rajasree, 25(OH)D levels 89 ng/mL\nwere associated with a multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for\ncase\u00adcontrol study of acute myocardial infarction by Scragg,\nprotective against CHD (multivariable adjusted odds ra-\n25(OH)D levels were notably lower than in the study by\nAmong 1739 Framingham Offspring Study participants\nfree of cardiovascular disease at baseline, a 25(OH)D level\n15 ng/mL was associated with a multivariable-adjusted\n62% higher hazard of developing a first cardiovascular\nevent.11 Interestingly, PAD, defined as the onset of new\nclaudication, was included in the outcome definition. How-\never, PAD only comprised 8 of the 120 events in the study.\nThere are several lines of evidence suggesting that vitamin\nD may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular\nTable 2.

Cardiac myocytes possess vitamin D receptors.28\nSeveral in vitro studies have shown that active vitamin D\ninhibits cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.7,29 Paricalcitol, an\nactive vitamin D compound, attenuated the development of\nleft ventricular hypertrophy in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.30\nVitamin D has been shown to be an inhibitor of the renin\u00ad\nangiotensin system.6 In addition, several small studies have\nshown that supplementation with various forms of vitamin D\nmay improve the cytokine profile (CRP, TNF- levels) of\npatients with vitamin D deficiency31 and congestive heart\nfailure.32 Cellular experiments showed that active vitamin D\nand its analogs exhibit anticoagulant activity.8 Finally, the\nvitamin D-24-hydroxylase transgenic rat, a model of vitamin\nD deficiency attributable to continuous degradation of active\nvitamin D, develops aortic atherosclerosis.33 Interestingly, an\nearly experimental model of atherosclerosis was the choles-\nterol and vitamin D\u00adfed rat. These rats were given an\nextremely high dose of vitamin D2 (1.8 million units/kg), and\ndeveloped aortic atherosclerosis.34 It is interesting that animal\nmodels of both excessive and insufficient vitamin D develop\natherosclerosis and that there is conflicting human data on\nvery high levels and very low levels of 25(OH)D being\nassociated with cardiovascular disease9\u00ad11 suggesting that\nthere may be an optimal level that is neither too high nor\ntoo low.\nThe results of the current study show that the association\nbetween low 25(OH)D levels and the prevalence of PAD was\nconsistent across multiple subgroups. In the subgroup analy-\nses, the association was stronger for non-Hispanic whites and\nfor participants without diabetes mellitus. However, the\ninteraction terms were not significant for non-Hispanic blacks\nversus whites (P interaction0.31) or diabetes status (P\ninteraction0.19). Although one should be cautious inter-\npreting the results from subgroup analyses because of the\nreduced sample size and statistical power, these results are\nsimilar to those reported by Scragg et al.35 This line of\ninvestigation deserves further research.\nThe association we report is cross-sectional, similar to 2\nprevious smaller studies of 25(OH)D and PAD.36,37 In a study\nof 161 patients with angiographically proven PAD, those with\nStage II PAD, defined as the presence of claudication\nsymptoms, had higher mean 25(OH)D levels (23.4 ng/mL)\ncompared to patients with Stage IV PAD, defined as the\npresence of ulcers (9.4 ng/mL).37 Similarly, in a separate\nstudy of 95 patients with angiographically proven PAD,\npatients with Stage II PAD had higher 25(OH)D levels\ncompared to Stage IV PAD.36 The results of the current study\nextend these findings to a large nationally representative\npopulation with clinical and subclinical PAD.\nHigh iPTH levels have been associated with cardiovascular\ndisease in the general population.13 Elevated serum phosphate\nlevels have also been associated with cardiovascular events, a\ncomposite outcome which included peripheral vascular dis-\nease, in a community-based study.14 Despite these suggestive\nfindings, we did not find an association between serum\ncalcium, phosphate, and iPTH levels and the prevalence\nof PAD.\nMale\nFemale\nNon-Hispanic white\nNon-Hispanic black\nMexican-American\nNormal weight\nOverweight\nObese\nNever\nFormer\nCurrent\nActive\nInactive\nNo\nY\nes\nNo\nY\nes\nNo\nY\nes\nNo\nY\nes\nAge, years\nSex\nRace-ethnicity\nBody Mass Index\nSmoking\nPhysical Activity\nDiabetes Mellitus\nHistory of MI\nChronic Kidney Disease\nVitamin D Supplement Use\nPrevalence ratio\nFigure 2.

Most\nnotably, the study was cross-sectional. As in any cross-\nsectional study, one must be cautious in interpreting the\ndirection of the association. It has been hypothesized that\npatients with PAD may be less mobile and therefore receive\nless sun exposure and have lower 25(OH)D levels. Although\nthis may be the case for severe PAD, all participants in the\ncurrent study were noninstitutionalized and mobile enough to\nattend the NHANES visit. An additional limitation is the lack\nof data in NHANES on sun exposure, geographic location,\nand the season during which participants attended their study\nvisits. Another potential limitation is that angiography was\nnot used to detect PAD, which was impractical in a large,\npopulation-based survey. Despite these limitations, the cur-\nrent study maintains several strengths. Using the ABI allowed\nus to identify the presence of subclinical PAD. NHANES\nincluded a broad range of data collection. This allowed us to\nstudy 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphate, and iPTH and perform\nstatistical analyses after adjustment for several potential\nconfounding factors. Additional strengths include standard-\nized protocols with rigorous quality control for data collec-\ntion and inclusion of a large nationally representative study\nsample. The large sample size allowed the investigation of the\nassociation between 25(OH)D and PAD in several important\nsubgroups. The consistency of the results in these subgroups\nis noteworthy.\nIn summary, in this nationally representative study, US\nadults with low 25(OH)D levels had a higher prevalence of\nPAD. This association was strong, graded, and present after\nadjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Prospec-\ntive and mechanistic studies are needed to confirm these\nassociations.\n"
