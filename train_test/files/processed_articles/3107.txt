Past attempts at examining LND\nfood intake in children have included ex-\namination of the contribution of added\nsugar or carbonated beverages to the di-\nets of children.11-18 There is some evi-\ndence that food selection patterns fa-\nvored in childhood may track through\nadult years19; therefore, a better under-\nstanding of patterns of food consump-\ntion is clearly warranted. The purpose of\nthis study was to examine nationally rep-\nresentative data from the third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nsumption of LND foods by 8- to 18-year-\nold American children and adolescents.\nARTICLE\nFrom the Department of\nFamily, Nutrition, and Exercise\nSciences, Queens College of the\nCity University of New York,\nFlushing.\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.

The examination at the\nmobile examination center included physical and dental ex-\naminations, dietary interview, body measurements, and col-\nlection of blood and urine samples. Body weight, height, and\ncircumference at various body sites were measured by stan-\ndardized procedures in the mobile examination center.20\nA 24-hour dietary recall was collected by a trained dietary in-\nterviewer in a mobile examination center interview with the\nuse of an automated, microcomputer-based interview and cod-\ning system.20 The type and amount of foods consumed were\nrecalled with recall aids such as abstract food models, special\ncharts, measuring cups, and rulers to help in quantifying the\namounts consumed. Special probes were used to help the re-\ncall of commonly forgotten items such as condiments, accom-\npaniments, fast foods, and alcoholic beverages.\nAll NHANES III respondents aged 8 to 18 years with a 24-\nhour recall considered complete and reliable by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics were eligible for inclusion in this\nrespondents were excluded, to result in a final analytic sample\nTo determine the intake of LND foods, it was necessary to iden-\ntify foods belonging in this category from those reported in the\n24-hour dietary recall. As a first step, the 2578 foods reported\nby the analytic sample were classified as belonging to 1 or more\nof the 5 major food groups (dairy, fruit, grain, meat, and veg-\netable) or the LND food group by methods described previ-\nously.10,21,22 Briefly, the assignment of foods into the various\ngroups was dependent on their nutrient content and uses in\nthe diet. The dairy group included milk, yogurt, cheese, and\nbuttermilk, but excluded butter, cream cheese, and dairy des-\nserts. The fruit group included all fresh, frozen, dried, and canned\nfruits and fruit juices, but excluded fruit drinks. The grain group\nincluded all breads, cereals, pastas, and rice, but not pastries.\nThe meat group included meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and meat\nalternates such as dried beans, nuts, and seeds. The vegetable\ngroup included all raw or cooked fresh, frozen, and canned veg-\netables and juices. Mixed dishes containing foods from several\ngroups were grouped into all the relevant groups. Foods ex-\ncluded from these major food groups were grouped into the\nLND foods group. The LND foods were further placed into 5\nsubgroups as follows: (1) visible fat: butter, oil, dressings, gra-\nvies, etc; (2) sweeteners: sugar, syrup, candy, carbonated and\nnoncarbonated sweetened drinks, etc; (3) baked and dairy des-\nserts: cookies, cakes, pies, pastries, ice cream, puddings, cheese-\ncakes, etc; (4) salted snacks: potato, corn, and tortilla chips,\netc; and (5) miscellaneous: coffee, tea, condiments, etc.\nThe LND foods variable was operationalized in 3 differ-\nent ways: (1) number of mentions of LND foods and bever-\nages in the recall, (2) amount (in grams) of LND foods and bev-\nerages, and (3) percentage of total energy from LND foods and\nbeverages.\nThe NHANES III nutrient database for individual foods,\nwhich is derived from the US Department of Agriculture's Sur-\nvey Nutrient Database, was used for determining energy and\nnutrient content of all foods.23 We examined the mean intake\nof selected micronutrients (vitamins A, E, C, B6\n, and folate, and\nthe minerals calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc) by tertiles\nof the reported number of LND foods. The reported intake of\neach nutrient was also examined with reference to the most re-\ncent age-sex\u00adspecific standard available, the estimated aver-\nage requirement.3-6 As an estimate of dietary misreporting, the\nratio of reported energy intake to energy expenditure for basal\nneeds was computed. Energy expenditure for basal needs was\nestimated by prediction equations developed by the Dietary Ref-\nerence Intakes Committee for normal and overweight or obese\nData on serum concentrations of vitamin C, folate, and ca-\nrotenoids were obtained from the National Center for Health\nStatistics public release compact disks.25,26 The methods used\nfor measurement of these serum analytes and their associated\nerrors have been described.25,26 Serum folate, ascorbate, and the\ncarotenoids---carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein-\nzeaxanthin, and lycopene--were chosen because the dietary in-\ntake of each nutrient is believed to be a major determinant of\nserum concentration of the respective nutrient and can thus\nserve as a biomarker of dietary exposure.4,5 Serum homocys-\nteine has been reported as an independent predictor of coro-\nnary heart disease risk and may have dietary determinants.27,28\nThe number, amount, and proportion of daily energy contrib-\nuted by all LND foods and subgroups were computed, and each\nLND food variable was examined as weighted tertiles. The mean\ndaily energy, percentage of energy from macronutrients, and\nmean percentage of the population meeting the dietary refer-\nence intake of selected nutrients were obtained by tertiles of\neach LND foods variable. The estimates of nutrient and food\ngroup intake were adjusted for age (continuous), race (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other),\ngrade), and total energy intake (in kilocalories). Adjusted mean\nconcentration of serum analytes by tertiles of the reported num-\nber of LND foods was obtained separately for boys and girls.\nThese models were adjusted for age, race, dietary intake of the\nrelevant nutrient, supplement use in the 24 hours before phle-\nbotomy, supplement use in the past month, and hours of fast-\ning before phlebotomy.\nThe procedure used for obtaining covariate-adjusted es-\ntimates and SEs from survey data is based on Taylor lineariza-\ntion methods according to Graubard and Korn.29 All statistical\nanalyses were performed with SAS30 and software designed for\nanalysis of survey data (SUDAAN).31 This software generates\nvariance estimates that are corrected for multistage stratified\nprobability design of complex surveys. Sample weights pro-\nvided by the National Center for Health Statistics to correct for\ndifferential probabilities of selection, noncoverage, and non-\nresponse were used in all analyses to obtain point estimates.20\nThe independent association of each LND foods variable\nwith food and nutrient intake was examined by regression pro-\ncedures to adjust for covariates mentioned above. Linear re-\ngression procedures were used when the outcome variables were\ncontinuous (eg, dietary nutrient intake or serum analyte\nconcentration). For categorical outcomes, such as whether the\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\namount meeting the standard of a nutrient intake was re-\nported, logistic regression procedures were used. Most of the\nresults shown in the article are for the LND foods variables ex-\npressed as number of mentions.\nRESULTS\nMore than 30% of daily energy in the diets of 8- to 18-\nyear-old US children and adolescents was contributed by\nLND foods, with sweeteners and desserts jointly account-\ning for nearly 25% (Table 1). The third tertile of the\nnumber of LND foods mentioned had a higher propor-\ntion of non-Hispanic whites, respondents with higher fam-\nily income, and supplement users (Table 2). The 2-day\naverage number of hours of television watched, the weekly\nhours reportedly spent on physical activity, body mass\nindex, self-perceived body weight status, or history of at-\ntempted weight loss in the past year were unrelated to\nthe reported number of LND foods (Table 2).\nTable 3 presents the adjusted mean\u00b1SE of energy\nand macronutrient intake by tertiles of the reported num-\nber of LND foods. Intakes of total energy and percent-\nage of energy from carbohydrate and fat were positively\nrelated, but percentages of energy from protein and di-\netary fiber were related inversely to the number of LND\nfoods mentioned. Percentage of energy from saturated\nfat was not related to the reported number of LND foods.\nThe total amount of all reported foods and beverages,\namount of LND foods, and percentage of energy from LND\nfoods related positively, but the amounts of foods and\nbeverages from the 5 major food groups (grain, fruits,\nvegetables, meat and alternates, dairy) were related in-\nversely to the reported number of LND foods (P.001).\nTable 4 shows the mean amount of selected food\ngroups and nutrients, and percentage of US children and\nadolescents meeting the dietary reference intake for se-\nlected nutrients on recall day, by tertiles of the reported\nnumber of LND foods. The mean amounts of foods from\nthe fruit and dairy groups declined with increasing LND\nfood tertiles in both boys and girls. The odds of mention-\ning any food from the fruit or the dairy groups on recall\nday were also lower in girls in the third tertile of number\nof LND foods mentioned. The odds of mentioning a food\nfrom the grain, vegetable, and meat or alternate groups did\nnot differ among tertiles of number of LND foods (data\nare shown for dairy and fruit groups only).\nIn girls, the reported mean amounts of all micro-\nnutrients examined (except vitamin E) declined with ter-\ntiles of reported number of LND foods (P.05). In boys,\nthe reported mean amounts of folate, vitamin B6\n, cal-\ncium, and magnesium declined with tertiles of reported\nnumber of LND foods. The percentage of children and\nadolescents meeting the respective standard of intake of\nfolate, vitamins B6\nand A, and the minerals magnesium,\niron, and zinc on recall day decreased with increasing ter-\ntiles of number of LND foods. Children and adolescents\nin the highest third of LND food reporting had at least\n50% lower odds of meeting the estimated average re-\nquirement for folate, vitamin B6\n, magnesium, iron, and\nzinc on recall day.\nThe independent association of the reported num-\nber of LND foods with the serum concentrations of se-\nlected vitamins and carotenoids was also examined. In\nmultiple regression models, the number of LND foods\nwas not an independent predictor of serum concentra-\ntion of most of the analytes examined. Serum homocys-\nteine concentration was available for 1209 children and\nadolescents in the analytic sample. Multicovariate-\nadjusted serum homocysteine concentration for the\nfirst, second, and third tertiles of number of LND foods\ntively (P for trend=.009). It is noteworthy that dietary\nvitamin C and folate were significant positive predictors\nof serum concentration of vitamin C and folate, respec-\ntively, in both boys and girls. Dietary carotenoid intake\nrelated positively to serum concentration of -carotene\nand -carotene, but was unrelated to serum -cryp-\ntoxanthin and lycopene. (Data on serum analyte con-\ncentration are not shown and are available from the\nauthor.)\nThe results presented above were largely the same\nwhen the LND food variable was expressed as amount\nreported (in grams) or as percentage of total energy\nintake.\nCOMMENT\nAmerican children and adolescents reported nearly a third\nof their daily energy intake from relatively energy-\ndense, low-nutrient foods, with sweeteners, candy, car-\nbonated or noncarbonated beverages, and desserts pro-\nviding approximately a quarter of the total daily energy\nintake. A third of the 8- to 18-year-old population ex-\namined reported 6 or more LND foods on the recall day,\nproviding an average of 41% of the total daily energy in-\ntake. To my knowledge, few other directly comparable\nestimates have been published. Differences in methods\nused to group foods make comparisons difficult to in-\nterpret. In the National Adolescent Health Survey, nearly\n60% of those surveyed reported having consumed \"junk\nfood snacks\" on the previous day.32 The proportion re-\nporting LND food intake was similarly high in the Youth\ncents studied by Bandini and colleagues34 reported ap-\nproximately 20% to 27% of their total daily energy in-\ntake from chips, candy, soda, baked goods, and ice cream.\nFrom the list of food sources of energy in 24-hour re-\ncalls of 2- to 18-year-olds reported by Subar et al,35 it can\nbe estimated that approximately 30% of the energy came\nfrom foods comparable to those considered LND in the\npresent study. Other available estimates of consump-\ntion of LND foods are limited to carbonated beverages\nAlthough the percentage of energy from carbohy-\ndrate increased with the reported number of LND foods,\ngrams of fiber decreased, confirming higher consump-\ntion of refined carbohydrates and lower consumption of\nfruits, vegetables, and grains that provide dietary fiber\nand complex carbohydrates. Furthermore, increasing car-\nbohydrate intake in association with the reported num-\nber of LND foods was accompanied by a lower percent-\nage of energy from protein but not fat. Instead, the\npercentage of energy from fat increased slightly with in-\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nTable 1.

It is likely that more of\nthe fat in the diets of those reporting a high intake of LND\nfoods came from prepared snack foods. Such foods may\ncontain more of hydrogenated fats that include trans\u00ad\nfatty acids.36 Trans\u00adfatty acids are also believed to be ath-\nerogenic and have been implicated in increased risk of\ncoronary heart disease.37\nIt is evident from the data presented in Tables 3 and\n4 that there were both qualitative and quantitative differ-\nences in dietary patterns of children who reported high\nLND food intake. Foods from the dairy and fruit groups\nwere less likely to be mentioned and the amount of all nu-\ntrient-densefoodsreporteddecreasedwithincreasingnum-\nber of LND foods. These data suggest that, on the aver-\nage, reporting of LND foods was associated negatively with\nreportingofnutrient-densefoods.However,thesearecross-\nsectionaldataanddonotallowdefinitiveconclusionsabout\ndisplacement of nutrient-dense foods by LND foods.\nGiven the food intake data, it is not surprising that\nthe proportion of children and adolescents, especially girls,\nmeeting the dietary reference intakes of most examined\nmicronutrients (except vitamins C and E) on recall day\nalso declined with increasing tertiles of number of LND\nfoods reported. The positive association of dietary ascor-\nbate, folate, and carotenoids with serum ascorbate, fo-\nlate, and selected carotenoids, respectively, validates the\nreported dietary intakes of these micronutrients. The pub-\nlished literature on nutritional implications of LND food\nintake is limited to examining the relationship of sugar in-\ntake (or carbonated beverages) with nutritional quality of\ndiets, with equivocal results.11-18 Nutritional quality of di-\nets was found to be negatively impacted by carbonated bev-\nerage consumption by some,11,12 while others have con-\ncludedthathighsugarconsumershadhigherenergyintake\nThe reported hours spent on exercise or watching\ntelevision varied little by the number of LND foods re-\nported. These data do not support the widely held belief\nthat a high LND food intake is associated with more tele-\nvision time or limited physical activity. However, the num-\nber of LND foods mentioned was an independent posi-\ntive predictor of energy intake; increased energy intake\nin association with LND food intake without a concur-\nrent increase in energy expenditure would play a role in\npromoting a positive energy balance.38\nIn this study, the reported number of LND foods did\nnot relate to sex-age\u00adadjusted body mass index. Ban-\ndini et al34 also found that obese adolescents did not re-\nport more energy from LND foods relative to nonobese\nadolescents. Others have similarly found no association\nbetween reported body mass index and added sugar in-\nof sweetened drinks to be related to obesity in children.\nThe observed lack of an association between body mass\nindex and LND food intake may partly be attributable\nto dieting by overweight respondents as well as measure-\nment error (discussed in the next paragraph).\nAll methods of dietary assessment including the 24-\nhour dietary recall used in NHANES III are subject to mea-\nsurement errors.40 Data from a 24-hour recall are believed\nto be suitable forestimating usual dietary intakes ofgroups,\nbut not individuals.24 Prevalence of micronutrient inad-\nequacy in particular is likely to be overestimated in 24-\nhour recall data because of intraindividual variation in food\nintake.41 Therefore, this study makes no claims to estimat-\ning prevalence of marginal nutrient intakes in association\nwith LND reporting. It is preferable to interpret the re-\nsults presented in Table 4 as indicating that 8- to 18-year-\noldAmericansgroupedinthehighestthirdofreportednum-\nber of LND foods consumed reported lower amounts of\nnutrient-dense foods and were more likely to report less\nthan the estimated average requirement of several nutri-\nentsontherecallday.Dietarymeasurementerroroftencon-\ntributes to the inability to find significant associations\nTable 3.

In the\npresent study, a ratio of reported energy intake to esti-\nmated basal energy expenditure was calculated as a mea-\nsure of reporting status and found to be positively re-\nlated to LND food intake (P for trend, .001). Finally,\nthere may be differential misreporting of LND foods be-\ncause of the social desirability bias. However, it is note-\nworthy that in adults in the NHANES III, ratio of re-\nported energy intake to energy expenditure for basal needs\nrelated positively to reporting of both nutrient-dense and\nLND foods.43 Nevertheless, there is a possibility that es-\ntimates of reported LND food intake from the present\nstudy may be lower than actual intakes.\nThe results indicate that LND foods are widely con-\nsumed by American children and adolescents, and sug-\ngest opportunities for improving nutrient intake profiles\nby interventions to moderate LND food intake. In my opin-\nion, the needed interventions to change this behavior must\nbe from several directions. Consistent with the philoso-\nphy of not labeling foods \"good\" or \"bad,\" the food guide\npyramid groups many LND foods (eg, desserts and salty\nsnacks) as part of the dairy or grain groups.44 The extent\nto which most consumers comprehend and implement the\nrecommended fat and sugar substitutions necessary to in-\nclude foods such as baked or dairy desserts in the diet is\nnot known. Nevertheless, simplification of dietary guid-\nance messages regarding inclusion of LND food in the diet\nmay be useful. Second, interventions need to target fami-\nlies and children. A recent study45 suggested that family-\nbasedinterventionsthatfocusedonincreasingfruitandveg-\netable intake were also effective in reducing the intake of\nLND foods for parents and children. Practitioners may find\nthe strategy of emphasizing nutrient-dense foods useful for\nmoderating the intake of LND foods, with a resultant de-\ncrease inenergy intakes and improvementof intakeofcriti-\ncal micronutrients. However, interventions targeting chil-\ndren and adolescents to lower LND food intake may need\na more creative approach; there is preliminary evidence to\nsuggest that children perceive foods labeled \"healthy\" as\nnot being \"tasty.\"46 Because taste is a major determinant\nof food consumption,47 nutritionmessages forchildrenand\nadolescents have to promote the nutrient-dense foods with\na different marketing angle. Third, as has been suggested\nelsewhere, marketing of soft drinks, candies, and pre-\npared baked or fried snacks in school cafeterias and vend-\ning machines should be discouraged and alternate foods\nincluding milk and fruit should be promoted.7,48 Finally,\nthe food industry should be a partner in these interven-\ntions by avoiding aggressive marketing of food products\nwithout nutritionally redeeming qualities.\nIn conclusion, the results suggest that LND food\nmentions by 8- to 18-year-old Americans were accom-\nWhat This Study Adds\nThere has been no systematic, comprehensive study of\nthe extent of contribution of LND foods to the diets of\nAmerican children and adolescents or the nutritional and\nhealth implications, if any, of consumption of such foods.\nNearly a third of the total daily energy in the diets of 8-\nto 18-year-old American children and adolescents was\ncontributed by LND foods (sweeteners, beverages, des-\nserts, discretionary fats, and salty snacks). Increasing men-\ntions of LND foods on the recall day were associated with\nhigher energy intake but lower amounts of nutrient-\ndense foods and high-risk micronutrients.\nTable 4.
