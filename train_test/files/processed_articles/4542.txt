Plasma peak con-\nintravenous injection and at 30min during\ncontinuous infusion.17 Although the minimal\neffective concentration of nefopam is not\nknown, its usual daily dose for postoperative\nceiling effect at approximately 90mg/day.18\nThe effect of nefopam in the prevention of\npostoperative pain has been reviewed,19 and a\nlarge number of clinical studies have explored\nthe use of nefopam in various perioperative\nadjunctive or main agent for postoperative\nintravenous PCA has only been evaluated\nin limited patient groups, 20-22 and to our\nknowledge, has not been evaluated after\nlaparotomy.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the\nopioid sparing effect of nefopam when\nadministered intravenously with fentanyl as\nPCA, and to evaluate any adverse events\n(AEs) that occurred over a 24 h period\nfollowing surgery in patients who had\nundergone laparotomy.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited patients aged 20 \u00ad 65\nyears and classified as American Society\nof Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status\nI\u00adII,25 who were scheduled for elective\nopen laparotomy under general anaesthesia\nat Seoul National University Hospital,\nand September 2013. Exclusion criteria were:\nthe presence of renal or hepatic disease; high\nrisk of urinary retention; seizure history;\nknown allergy to any of the medications\nused; current history of psychiatric disorder,\nor taking psychotropic medications or mono-\namine oxidase inhibitors. Patients who could\nnot understand the verbal rating scale (VRS)\nand/or the 11-point numeric rating scale\n(NRS)26 were also excluded.\nEthical approval for the study (IRB\nInstitutional Review Boards in Seoul\nNational University Hospital on 1 October\n2012. Written informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients.\nStudy design\nThe study was double blind and patients\nwere assessed pre- and postsurgery for 24 h.\nPatients were randomly allocated between\ntwo treatment groups using a computer\ngenerated code. Both groups were provided\nwith 50 ml of intravenous PCA: SF group,\nnefopam in normal saline (25 mg/ml fentanyl\nand 2.4 mg/ml nefopam). The dose of nefo-\npam was based on its maximum recom-\nmended daily dose. The randomization\ncodes were kept by an independent anaes-\nthetist and were only opened after study\ncompletion or in the case of an emergency.\nOn the day before surgery, pain intensity\nwas evaluated using the VRS (0, no pain; 1,\nmild pain; 2, moderate pain; 3, intense pain)\nand NRS (numbers from 0 to 10 represent-\ning `no pain' to `worst pain imaginable'),\nand were shown how to use the PCA device.\nOn the day of surgery, electrocardiography,\nnoninvasive blood pressure (BP), peripheral\noxygen saturation and end tidal carbon\ndioxide monitors were attached to each\npatient for continuous monitoring.\nAnaesthesia was induced with 30 mg lido-\ncaine and 2 mg/kg propofol iv, followed by\n0.9 mg/kg rocuronium for facilitation of\ntracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was main-\nair in oxygen. A PCA device (APM\u00d5,\nAbbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) was\nconnected to the intravenous line but\nremained turned off while the patient was\nin the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU).\nFor both treatment groups, the intravenous\nPCA was provided without a background of\ncontinuous infusion and with limits of 1 ml\nbolus, 8 min lockout time (maximum of\nPCA was refilled if required and was avail-\nable throughout the 24 h study period.\nAn anaesthetist not involved in the study\nassessed pain intensity using the VRS score\nat 5 min intervals as soon as the patient\nawoke. If the patient reported VRS ! 3, the\nanaesthetist administered a rescue bolus\ndose of 1 mg/kg fentanyl iv. Additional\nrescue bolus doses of fentanyl were admin-\nistered until VRS < 3. The patient was with-\ndrawn from the study if the score did not fall\nbelow 3 despite five rescue doses of fentanyl\nand after 30 min in PACU. For those\npatients with VRS < 3, the PCA device was\nturned on and the patient was encouraged to\nuse the preset bolus doses of study treat-\nments. After 30 min in PACU, patients were\ntransferred to a ward and a research fellow\nanaesthetist not involved in the study rec-\norded NRS pain score at rest and on moving\nData on the cumulative PCA dose as dis-\nplayed on the PCA device were recorded and\ntransferred to a computer for interpretation.\nNo additional analgesics, antipyretics, or\nanti-inflammatory drugs were permitted\nduring the study.\nSedation was assessed by the independent\nresearch fellow anaesthetist using the\nObserver's Assessment of Alertness and\nSedation (OAA/S) scale (5, responds readily\nto name spoken in normal tone; 4, lethargic\nresponse to name spoken in normal tone; 3,\nresponds only after name is called loudly or\nrepeatedly; 2, responds only after mild\nprodding or shaking; 1, does not respond\nto mild prodding or shaking; 0, does not\nrespond to noxious stimulus).27 Patients\nwere considered sedated if the OAA/S scale\nscore was < 4 at any one time point during\nthe PACU stay, and < 5 on the ward.\nAny AEs observed during the 24-h study\nperiod were recorded by the independent\nresearch fellow anaesthetist. Patients were\nasked if they had experienced any of the\nfollowing: hypertension; tachycardia;\nsweating, shivering; nausea; vomiting; sed-\nation; pruritus; dry mouth. Hypertension\nand tachycardia were also defined as BP or\nheart rate (HR) changes of ! 20% from\npreoperative baseline values on more than\ntwo consecutive evaluation points. Patients\nwho experienced nausea and vomiting\nreceived 0.075 mg palonosetron iv. In spite\nof satisfactory pain control, if the patient\npersistently complained of any of the above\nadverse events, PCA was stopped and the\npatient was withdrawn from the study.\nPatients were also withdrawn from the\nstudy if, on the OAA/S scale, they scored\nzero at any time point or 1 at more than two\nconsecutive time points. Additionally, a\nsystolic BP > 160 mmHg, a diastolic\ntwo consecutive time points or intolerable\npalpitations were also criteria for\nwithdrawal.\nSatisfaction of the analgesia achieved\nwith intravenous PCA was assessed at the\nend of the study (24 h after surgery) using a\n4-point VRS (0, no satisfaction; 1, mild\nsatisfaction; 2, moderate satisfaction; 3,\nintense satisfaction).\nStatistical analyses\nThe primary study endpoint was the cumu-\nlative dose of fentanyl administered via\nPCA. Secondary endpoints were the com-\nparison of pain intensity and occurrence of\nAEs.\nBased on previous data,1 32 subjects per\ngroup were required to detect a 20% reduc-\ntion in fentanyl requirements in the first 24 h\nafter surgery, with an alpha level of 0.5 (two-\ntailed) and a beta level of 0.1 (90% power).\nTherefore, estimating a dropout rate of\ngroup. Patient characteristics, intraopera-\ntive data, cumulative fentanyl consumption,\nmean BP and HR, were analysed using\nStudent's t-test. Analysis of covariance\n(ANCOVA) was used to adjust for baseline\ndifferences between the two groups. The\nincidence of AEs and patient satisfaction\nwere analysed using 2 test. Pain and sed-\nation scores were analysed using Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test.\nP-values < 0.05 were considered to be\nstatistically significant, and statistical ana-\nlyses were performed using SPSS\u00d5 version\n19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5.\nResults\nThe study recruited 73 patients (NF group\nwhich were withdrawn from the NF group\n(one had unstable vital signs and the other\nwas accidently enrolled into another study).\nDemographic, surgical and fentanyl con-\nsumption data for the remaining 71 patients\nare shown in Table 1.

In addition,\ntransferring from PACU to the ward and\nmoving from bed to bed may cause add-\nitional stress for the patient. We conclude\nthat more care should be given to improve\nthe pain status during this transition period\nand that preoperative patient instructions\non PCA use should be emphasised and\nperhaps a PCA bolus dose be given imme-\ndiately before patients leave the PACU.\nWith the exception of dizziness and dry\nmouth, adding nefopam to the intravenous\nPCA did not appear to increase the inci-\ndence of opioid-related side effects such as\nnausea, vomiting, sedation, shivering,\nsweating and itching. Others have shown\nthat AEs commonly associated with nefo-\npam include tachycardia, sweating, nausea,\nvomiting, drowsiness, light headedness,\nasthenia, and pain at the injection site, but\nthese are often transitory and moderate in\nthe central nervous system and has no\nrespiratory depressive effect.29 Moreover,\nnefopam has a clear advantage over\nNSAIDs in that it does not cause gastric\nmucosal erosion or affect platelet aggrega-\ntion.24 Although HR was significantly\nincreased in the NF group compared with\nthe SF group during the first 2 h and 24 h\nafter surgery in the present study, there was\nno between-group difference in the incidence\nof tachycardia. The incidence of sweating,\nanother commonly reported adverse event\nassociated with nefopam, was not signifi-\ncantly different between groups, although\ntwo patients in NF group versus one in SF\ngroup experienced moderate-to-severe\nsweating. Tachycardia, sweating and, to a\nlesser extent, postoperative nausea and\nvomiting may be due to the antimuscarinic\nand sympathomimetic activity of nefo-\npam,30 and related to its maximal concen-\ntration and rate of increase in plasma\nconcentration.28 The dose of nefopam\nchosen for our study was relatively low\n(approximately 50 mg/day), and this may\nhave influenced the occurrence of AEs\nreported here.\nAlthough nefopam is considered well\ntolerated in therapeutic dose ranges, uncom-\nmon and sometimes fatal adverse events\nhave been reported with this drug.31,32 For\nexample, a case of postoperative permanent\nblindness31 and several cases of fatal intoxi-\ncation.32 In addition, one study reported an\nunexpected increase in its plasma levels even\nthough the doses were within the therapeutic\nrange.33 Currently, there is no formal guid-\nance for adjusting the dose of nefopam in\ncases of renal disease or in the elderly.28\nHowever, decreased kidney function or end\nstage renal disease (ESRD) may result in\nabnormal accumulation of nefopam. The\ndrug was found to exhibit a lower clearance\nand higher peak concentrations in patients\nwith ESRD compared with healthy volun-\nteers.34 The pharmacokinetics of nefopam\nmay also be affected by age; one study\nestimated that for the same infusion dur-\nation of 20 mg of nefopam, three times lower\ntotal clearance and three times higher\nplasma concentrations of nefopam were\nobserved in the elderly compared with\nyounger subjects.28 Therefore, an infusion\ntime of > 45 min for a single dose of nefo-\npam and a 20 mg dose for the elderly are\nrecommended to decrease the side-effects of\nnefopam.28 A limitation of the present study\nwas the small sample size. Further, larger\nstudies are therefore required to confirm\nthese findings and provide more safety data.\nIn conclusion, intravenous PCA using\nnefopam \u00fe fentanyl following laparotomy\nhas an opioid sparing effect and is associated\nwith a low incidence of some of the typical\nopioid related AEs. The use of\nnefopam \u00fe fentanyl was associated with\ndecreased intensity of pain, both at rest\nand on moving, and increased patient satis-\nfaction at 24 h postsurgery, compared with\nfentanyl alone. Further studies with more\npatients are required to confirm these results\nand define the recommend dose and regimen\nof nefopam for intravenous PCA after\nlaparotomy and other types of surgery.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nYC Kim had support from Pharmbio Korea Co.,\nLtd., Korea for the submitted work.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Pharmbio Korea\nCo., Ltd., Korea [grant number PBK1106ACU].\nReferences\n1.
