    "abstract": "Abstract\nMany empirical studies in the area of foreign direct investment (FDI) exclusively focus on\nflows between industrialized countries. This article makes a contribution to the still relatively\nsparse literature on FDI in emerging markets by estimating determinants of German FDI\nflows to Latin America and Asia during the past decade. Using data contained in a newly\navailable Bundesbank microdatabase, an FDI flow variable, constructed from year-to-year\ndifferences in FDI stocks adjusted for certain otherwise distorting factors, is empirically tested\nwith respect to several exogenous variables previously found to be significant in the literature.\nThese include so-called non-traditional factors such as country risk and agglomeration effects\nwhich are widely regarded as influential for FDI in emerging market economies. This study\ntherefore focuses on estimating the effects of various risk measures and finds that country\nrisk, and partially political risk, is indeed detrimental to investments of German enterprises.\nMoreover, German FDI in Latin America are found to have been market-seeking while those\nin emerging Asia tended to exploit low factor costs. Methodically, this paper uses the SUR\nestimation technique which allows for the contemporaneous correlation of disturbances as\nwell as first-order autocorrelation of the time series disturbances and cross-sectional\nheteroskedasticity. In arriving at a parsimonious regression for each region, an Extreme\nBounds Analysis (Leamer, 1983 & 1985) is performed to select individual variables robust to\nthe inclusion of other explanatory variables. Making empirical use of German firm-level data,\nadditional estimations are performed for direct investment of the manufacturing sector and\nthree of its sub-sectors. Regarding the latter, the hypothesis that capital-intensive industries\nreact particularly strongly to the changes in the regulatory environment of the host country is\nconfirmed by the data.\n",

Introduction\nWith hindsight, the 1990s were the decade of initial emerging market exuberance and\nsubsequent disillusionment. Foreign direct investment flows to prospering regions such as\nLatin America and, most prominently, Asia grew by leaps and bounds \u00ad from about the mid-\n1980s to the second half of the 1990s average annual worldwide FDI flows to developing\ncountries increased eightfold1 \u00ad nourishing hopes for sustainable growth by transforming the\nhost countries' infrastructure and enhancing their ability to withstand global economic\ndownturns. As a matter of fact, German FDI stocks (at book values) in the six largest Latin\nAmerican economies more than doubled between end-1989 and end-1997, while those of\nGerman subsidiaries in the eight largest markets in Asia almost quadrupled during that period.\nHowever, when the Asian crisis broke out, the long-held belief of these fast-growing\neconomies' invulnerability was shattered, and it became apparent that warning signs such as\nreal overvaluation of the currency, high short-term foreign indebtedness of the country as a\nwhole or of individual sectors, as well as the absence of long-overdue structural reforms may\nnot have been heeded by a majority of foreign enterprises.\nThe question then is: were those \"red flags\" in the sense of worsening country and/or political\nrisk assessments \u00ad representing a subjective probability of certain adverse outcomes2 \u00ad\nperceived by international investors? This study aims at identifying the determinants of\nGerman FDI in the emerging economies of Latin America and Asia throughout the past\ndecade, and, in particular, those relating to \"governance\" aspects, measured by indices of\ncountry or political risk. Governance issues have consistently been, and still remain a major\nchallenge for emerging market economies. Despite having undertaken substantial stabilization\nor liberalization efforts3 and pursuing appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, many of these\ncountries are suffering from a wide range of political and regulatory deficiencies which need\nto be tackled to appease investors. At first glance, emerging economies feature proper\ninvestment regimes when in fact obscure licensing procedures and discretionary\nadministrative regulations characterize the true nature of the country's investment policy.\n3 Lora (2001) provides cross-country evidence on the extent of trade, tax, labor and financial market reforms as\nwell as privatization in Latin America (see section 2.2.2).\nEven willing governments are thus often unable to convey credible signals to foreign\ninvestors.4\nMost empirical research using German FDI data5 has been undertaken with respect to\nindustrialized economies. Only a few studies are devoted exclusively to the investment\nbehavior of German enterprises in developing countries or emerging markets. Hubert and\nPain (1999) find in regressions restricted to non-EU countries, i.e. essentially developing\ncountries, that only stocks of research & development, unit labor costs in Germany relative to\nthe host country and real exchange rate volatility turn out to be significant with the expected\nsigns.\nSimilarly, only some German FDI studies employ political risk variables. Agarwal et al.\n(1991), in a very comprehensive study of the traditional and risk-related determinants of\nGerman investment abroad, generally find no deterring effect of political risk (composite risk\nand, separately, strikes and lockouts) on FDI flows to developing countries in the 1980s.\nMoore (1993) identifies an index of labor unrest in the 17 OECD countries examined.\nSurprisingly, the number of days lost in strikes is mildly significant and positively correlated\nwith FDI flows. Jost and Nunnenkamp (2002) run cross-section and pooled regressions for\nusual results for host country per-capita GDP and population, they find good scores for\ncountry risk as measured by the Euromoney index and an openness measure (adjusted for\ncountry size) as well as, in separate regressions, low political risk and a skill variable (rate of\nsecondary schooling) to exert a strong positive influence on FDI stocks.6 Interestingly, the\nimportance of country risk and a skill variable is shown to rise over the course of the last\ndecade.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The subsequent section first explains how the FDI flow\nvariable used in this study is derived. It then gives an overview of the literature on\ndeterminants of FDI in emerging markets, and, particularly, those factors relating to risk\naspects. Section three provides details on the econometric approach and the selection process\nused for identifying robust variables among a pool of exogenous variables. The regression\nresults are presented in section four, with a distinction being made between the country, sector\nand sub-sector level. Section five has the concluding remarks.\n5 For a good overview of German studies on FDI, see Fischer (2000).\n6 It is quite likely, however, that most of the series containing the FDI stocks are non-stationary \u00ad a\nphenomenon that is not appropriately accounted for in the purely static estimation. The authors additionally\nexamine flow data from the German balance of payments (note that the openness measure turns insignificant, p.\n63) which is doubtful considering the conceptual shortcomings (see section 2.1.1 of this paper, second\nindentation mark).\n2.1 Endogenous variable\nThere is no unanimously agreed method of measuring FDI. Different studies proceed in\ndifferent ways. It, therefore, seems important to make as clear as possible how FDI has been\ndefined here and why this particular definition has been chosen. In this study, the endogenous\nvariable is the net inflow or outflow of direct investment capital of German investors into\nemerging market economies during a given calendar year. Depending on how one looks at it,\nforeign direct investment may be understood purely as a flow variable or as a stock variable.\nThe IMF Balance of Payments Manual does not exclusively recur to the cumulative stock of\nFDI capital but defines direct investment as comprising \"not only the initial transaction\nestablishing the relationship between the investor and the enterprise but also all subsequent\ntransactions between them and among affiliated enterprises, both incorporated and\nunincorporated\".7\nThe direct investment capital flows used in the estimations are derived from the direct\ninvestment stock statistics compiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank since 1976 as an annual\ncomplete survey and published on a partly aggregated basis in Special Statistical Publication\nNo. 10 (\"Kapitalverflechtung mit dem Ausland\" \u00ad \"International capital links\"). These data\nare now also available in the form of a computer-aided microdatabase for the years 1989 to\n2000.8 During the sample period, German enterprises reported minority interests (of at least\n10% but less than 50%) in foreign enterprises if the balance-sheet total of the investment\ntarget exceeded DM 10 million (in 1999: 5 million). Controlling interests (50% or more) had\nto be reported if the investment target's balance-sheet total exceeded DM 1 million (in 1999:\n0.5 million). In 2002 the threshold for both categories became 3 million. Indirect participating\ninterests likewise must be reported if a \"dependent\" (i.e. majority-owned) enterprise itself\nholds a stake of at least 10% in another enterprise. It should be stressed, therefore, that foreign\ndirect investment merely represents the provision of financial capital \u00ad in this case by German\nenterprises to their foreign subsidiaries.9\nThe direct investment stocks included in the database are book values and are calculated as\nthe sum total of the investor's share in the nominal capital of the investment target, the capital\n7 IMF (1997), p. 86. \"Direct investment capital transactions include those that create or dissolve investments as\nwell as those that serve to maintain, expand, or reduce investments\"; ibid., p. 88.\n8 In the 1989 reporting year methodological changes were made which eliminated the comparability of the\n9 Thus, the term \"direct investment\" has to be clearly distinguished from the neo-classical concept of\ninvestment which is based on the change in value of capital goods (i.e. property, plant & equipment) on the\nreserves, and the retained profits/profits brought forward (cumulative reinvested earnings).\nLoans granted by the capital owners or affiliated enterprises are added to this equity capital.\nTo finally obtain the direct investment stock pursuant to the IMF's \"directional principle\", the\nsubsidiary's lending to or claims on the parent company must be subtracted.10 It should be\nnoted that the stock data quoted in foreign currency by the enterprise subject to reporting\nrequirements have to be converted into German currency at the current exchange rate on the\nindividual balance-sheet date (as mandated by the OECD Benchmark Definition).11\nThe use of stock data for estimating a flow variable is an imperfect approach due to several\ndistorting factors. Here is why this is and how the distortions are minimized:\n- In the Bundesbank's stocks statistics the acquisition of assets is recorded in the form of\nbalance-sheet book values. However, in the case of takeovers, an additional amount\n(goodwill) is frequently paid on top of the pure book value of the assets. These additional\nsums were particularly significant in recent years in cases of technology company\ntakeovers. Therefore, evaluating the transaction data, which are recorded at market values\nin the balance of payments, would be preferable \u00ad yet this raises other problems (see\nbelow). However, as advanced developing countries rather than industrialized countries are\nat the heart of this study, it may be assumed that, owing to the relatively uncertain profit\nexpectations and a political environment which is often difficult to gauge, the difference\nbetween market and book values may not be substantial. In the case of newly established\nsubsidiaries (i.e. greenfield investment) these problems do not arise to begin with.\n- While transaction-based balance of payments data in this respect seem superior for\nstudying FDI flows, they have other serious shortcomings. For one thing, the FDI flows in\nthe German balance of payments statistics do not list the individual recipient abroad which\nis a precondition for the sectoral analysis in (see section 4.2). What is more, only\n10 See Lipponer (2003), p. 219. The \"directional principle\" requires the direct investments to be separated\naccording to the direction of the capital flow. Loans from subsidiaries to the investor therefore have to be\ndeducted from the direct investment capital; see IMF (1997), p. 81. This practice contrasts with the asset liability\nprinciple, which presents such assets as autonomous \u00ad counterbalancing \u00ad direct investments.\n11 There is also the question of whether or not the stock data and thus also the FDI stock differences (which, after\nsuitable correction, are interpreted as flow data), should be adjusted for inflation in the host country \u00ad as is done\nby Moore (1993), who deflates the stock differences using foreign price indexes for capital goods \u00ad or for\nexchange rate effects as recommended by Wagner (1991), who eschews Bundesbank stock data for these\nimplicit effects. Accordingly, previous-year FDI stocks or, more correctly, the stocks of fixed assets and other\nlong-term assets, would have to be adjusted for both inflation and the change in the bilateral exchange rate in the\nreporting year. Alternatively, one might rightfully assume that relative purchasing power parity holds and the\ninflation differential between Germany and the host country in question is absorbed by the exchange rate, having\nboth distorting factors cancel each other out. To be sure, most empirical studies do not test nominal values but\neither deflate the FDI variable or relate it either to GDP or some other scaling factor (see section 2.1.3).\nimmediate direct investment relationships (as to equity capital) are recorded under\nparticipating interests in the German balance of payments statistics, but not indirect ones,\ni.e. those held via a holding company, which likewise compulsorily fall under the FDI\ndefinition. Reinvested earnings stemming from indirect capital links are not included,\neither. On balance, and leaving accounting issues aside, merely considering balance of\npayments data means failing to use a fully consolidated system encompassing indirect\nownership and, therefore, in all likelihood greatly understating actual FDI capital.12\nTherefore, in measuring the investment activity of German multinationals, the only\n\"relevant\" flow variable \u00ad if there is one to be had \u00ad should be derived from (adequately\nmodified) differences in stocks and not by using flows recorded in the balance of\npayments. Accordingly, this study uses a modified FDI \"flow\" variable, i.e. the difference\nin FDI stock from one year to another, adjusted for actual participation rates, deviating\nreporting years, balance-sheet depreciation and repatriated profits.13 This variable\nnevertheless corresponds \u00ad apart from the distortions mentioned above \u00ad to the basic\ndefinition of direct investment capital transactions contained in the IMF's Balance of\n- The balance-sheet values are shown in the stock statistics at the respective reporting date of\nthe direct investment enterprise concerned, which sometimes differs from the end of the\ncalendar year. For practical reasons the unadjusted figures are not divided between the two\ncalendar years included in the reporting year of such enterprises.15 Instead, all balance-\nsheet values of enterprises whose reporting date falls before June 30 \u00ad i.e. whose reporting\nyear therefore mostly does not coincide with the current reporting year of the stock\nstatistics \u00ad are included in the preceding calendar year.\n2.1.2 Adjustment for Participation Rates, Balance-Sheet Depreciation, Repatriated Profits\n- The FDI microdatabase contains participation rates for indirectly owned interests (usually\nheld via a holding company) which need to be adjusted for the share of FDI capital that\n14 \"The components of direct investment capital transactions ... are equity capital, reinvested earnings, and other\ncapital associated with various intercompany debt transactions\"; IMF (1997), p. 87. Hausmann and Fern\u00e1ndez-\nArias (2001) explicitly adhere to the flow concept: \"FDI is defined as the increase in the equity position of a\nnon-resident owner...\" (p. 33).\nwould be possible in these cases to include the balance-sheet values in the previous year linearly with the period\nnot coinciding with the year under review (for example, if May 31, 1999, were the reporting date, seven-twelfths\nof the balance-sheet values originally included in 1999 would be assigned to the 1998 reporting/calendar year,\nwith the value for 1999 being adjusted accordingly). For technical reasons \u00ad this breakdown would require a\n\"matching\" of the reporting numbers of the investor and the investment target over all of the sample years at the\nmicrodata level, which is not feasible \u00ad this is not an option.\nGerman investors effectively hold. That is, the \"real\" participation rate is calculated as the\nproduct of the vertical ownership shares. Doing so is necessary to account for multiple\nownership in holding companies. For example, if a holding company has a 50% stake in a\ndirect investment company and is itself equally owned by two German investors, the\nadjusted participation will be 25% for each parent.\n- As the assets are recorded as book values and are depreciated by a certain rate mandated by\nforeign tax regulations, the left-hand side of the balance sheet does not correspond to the\nactually existing (historical) capital stock. This pure taxation effect needs to be removed.\nAccordingly, by using a perpetual inventory model,16 FDI stocks are adjusted for the\noriginal tax depreciation undertaken when calculating the profit of the subsidiary; the aim\nof this adjustment is to determine which fixed assets are available for production each year.\nTo this end, the net capital stock (fixed assets) of the investment target is marked up for\neach year using a notional depreciation rate of 8%,17 which is multiplied by the share of\nFDI capital in total assets. The resulting gross capital stock of the following period is\nadjusted for increases or decreases in productive capital. By contrast, write-downs of\nfinancial assets, especially those of service providers, are not adjusted because the\ndepreciation rate is uncertain. The inflow of direct investment capital in a given period\ntherefore is the difference of the stocks18 between the current year's stocks and preceding\nyears' stocks plus the imputed depreciation of the adjusted capital stock.19\n- The resulting flow variable still includes the total annual surplus rather than merely the\nprofits remaining in the investment target after transferring the parent company's share of\nthe profit \u00ad i.e. reinvested profits. Accordingly, the profits of the previous year repatriated\nin the current year would need to be deducted from this flow variable.20 As this\ninformation cannot be extracted directly from the FDI stock statistics, a suitable\napproximation is called for: in the case of direct participating interests, the item \"income\n17 The rate of 8% used here is calculated as the average of economic depreciation rates for \"industrial buildings\" (3.6 %)\nand for \"industrial plant and machinery\" (12.3%). These rates were suggested by Chennels and Griffith (1997), p. 92.\n18 In this connection it should be noted that, in the case of direct participating interests, those in dependent\nholding companies which themselves hold at least a 10% stake in another company have to be excluded from the\nstock of direct investment capital in order to avoid double counting \u00ad these own participating interests are\nrecorded separately as indirect FDI. This approach is not applied to dependent holdings without participating\ninterests required to be reported or to minority-owned holdings with their own participating interests; see\n19 To give an example, the inflow (exclusive of repatriated profits) for the year 1991 is calculated as follows:\nwhere\nFDI = difference between the \"original\" direct investment stocks in the reporting year and the previous year\nFA = fixed assets * percentage share of assets (i.e. investor's share of capital)\n = notional depreciation rate (8%)\nfrom dividends and other profits\" relating to German outward FDI (as recorded in the\nGerman balance of payments statistics21) is used. For indirect participating interests,\nunfortunately, no such information is available.22 For simplicity, a full profit transfer from\nthe investment target to the holding company (by virtue of a corresponding agreement) is\nassumed.23 Accordingly, total profits are subtracted from the indirect FDI capital in each\nyear, yielding reinvested earnings as the difference between the following year's retained\nprofits/profits brought forward and those of the current year. This difference is already\nreflected in the variation of FDI stocks across years.24 A comparison of the flows derived\nfrom \"raw\" and adjusted differences in FDI stocks illustrates that while these deviations\nmay not dramatically alter the econometric outcome, they can cause individual variables to\ngain or lose significance.25\n2.1.3 Absolute and Normalized FDI Flows\nThe study uses a principal endogenous variable, FDIGDP, defined as outflows of German\nforeign direct investment to a given host country as a percentage of its GDP (both in nominal\nvalues (D-Marks)). The countries comprise the largest emerging market economies26 in Latin\nAmerica (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) as well as South and\nSoutheast Asia (People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,\nthe Philippines, Singapore and Thailand). Given that larger economies have consistently been\nshown to receive larger FDI inflows (see section 2.2.1, market size), the above normalization\nis performed to eliminate size effects and thus to determine the linkage between FDI flows\nand the variations in external factors over and above absolute market size as implied by GDP.\nCorrespondingly, estimations are centered on deviations from an implied average value of\nFDI flows and size of host countries. In addition, a related variable, FDIFLOW, is defined in\nabsolute values, adjusted for inflation differentials and nominal exchange rate changes, i.e. the\n21 Deutsche Bundesbank, Statistical Supplement No. 3, Table 5b \"Factor income \u00ad income from direct\ninvestment\", column 2.\n24 In principle, retained profits/profits brought forward would have to be subtracted in the case of newly acquired\ndirect investment companies. However, it is only for 1997-1999 that such positions can be identified in the\nmicrodata by checking whether an investment target surfaces in the database the following year. This is no\nin order to avoid additional bias due to incomplete adjustments, these equity positions are left unchanged.\n25 Referring to regressions in section 4, at the country level (Latin American sub-sample) the trade taxation\nvariable drops from a 1% level of significance (unadjusted flows) to the 5% level (adjusted flows) while the\nreverse is true for the agglomeration variable. Similarly, at the sector level (Asian sub-sample), country risk and\nexchange rate volatility now lose their respective weak significance (otherwise significant at the 10% level if\nunadjusted), and trade barriers suddenly matter somewhat.\n), at constant 1995 US dollars (World Development\nIndicators). The cut-off point was arbitrarily set at an average GDP of US$ 60 billion (next in line were Pakistan\n($ 58.4 billion) and Peru ($ 50.0 billion)). Taiwan and Hong Kong were excluded owing to data insufficiencies.\nFDI inflows are measured in constant 1990 US dollars.27 In anticipation of quantitative results\nin section four, note that in the tentative regression for FDIFLOW (see Table 10, Appendix)\nsize effects contained in the exogenous variables clearly govern the econometric outcome: for\nLatin America, only absolute real GDP, in addition to country risk, tested significant. The\nAsian sample also exhibits fewer significant variables than if the other and arguably more\nmeaningful variable FDIGDP is used. Moreover, both regressions exhibit a comparatively low\nR-squared.\nApart from log-linearizing FDI stocks, use of normalized FDI variables (FDI inflows as share\nof GDP) is relatively widespread in the literature on foreign direct investment. Froot and Stein\nGDP ratio proposed in this study. Similarly, Pistoresi (2000), Chakrabarti (2001) and\nNunnenkamp (2001b) link their FDI variable to host country population, i.e. per-capita FDI,\nwhile Lehmann (1999) computes country shares in total U.S. capital expenditures as an\ninvestment variable. Wheeler and Mody (1992) relate FDI in a given sample country to\ninvestment in an arbitrarily chosen numeraire country. Desai et al. (2003), while incorporating\nabsolute GDP in their regressions, do not even bother to report the estimates for the market\nsize variable because of the intuition that larger economies tend to receive greater volumes of\nforeign direct investment.\nAs Figure 1 shows, developments in the build-up of German FDI positions differed markedly\nbetween the two regions. Emerging from a small base, Asia experienced a pronounced, yet\nstable inflow of direct investment in the 1990s that eventually almost closed the huge initial\ngap to Latin America, which, partly due to the 1995 Mexican crisis, displays more volatile\nFDI flows. This fact corresponds to the fluctuations of global FDI flows to both regions.28\nThe fast recovery from the Asian crisis, at least as far as FDI inflows are concerned, has to be\ncredited to hurried liberalization efforts on the part of crisis countries in the region. For\nexample, South Korea, formerly hesitant to allow foreign investors to exert a controlling\ninfluence, swiftly opened the economy to FDI after the crisis had hit. Other countries set in\nmotion a wide range of structural reforms.29\n29 For example, Singapore: strengthening of competitiveness, Malaysia: reform of banking system, Thailand and\nIndonesia: institutional and regulatory reforms; see Thompson and Poon (2000), pp. 2-3.\nMore importantly, though, reform expectations might have been the driving force behind\nrebounding FDI flows: Thompson and Poon (2000), surveying multinational companies\noperating in the ASEAN countries, show investors anticipated that reforms would bring about\noperational benefits at firm level, likely making the region a more attractive location for sales\nand production over the longer term. The long-term orientation of foreign investors taking\ncontrolling stakes in host country firms is the unique quality of FDI, according to\nMallampally and Sauvant (1999), who observe that overall FDI flows to the five most\naffected Asian countries declined only slightly in 1997, contrasting sharply with negative\nflows for bank lending and portfolio investment. Mody and Murshid (2002) furnish evidence\nof the resiliency of FDI flows going to those emerging markets temporarily in distress. For\npositive coefficient for a crisis dummy that captures the interaction between lagged crises and\nFDI inflows which points to the persistence of FDI inflows in the aftermath of a crisis relative\nWithin the regions, Latin America displays a relatively stable distribution of German FDI\nstocks throughout the 1990s, with Brazil's startling dominance reaching its maximum of two-\nthirds of total German FDI in the mid-1990s and receding thereafter (figure 2).\n30 See also Nunnenkamp (2001a), pp. 19-21, who reports much higher volatilities of portfolio and other invest-\nment (mostly bank loans) relative to FDI flows to 13 Latin American and Asian nations in the 1980s and 1990s.\nFigure 1: German FDI Stocks and Flows\nYears\nGerman FDI Stocks (columns)\n(in billions of DM)\nGerman FDI Flows (lines)\n(in % of either region's GDP)\nFDI stock Latin America FDI stock Asia FDI/GDP Latin America FDI/GDP Asia\nIn the Asian emerging markets, Singapore's traditional supremacy gradually gave way to\nChina's FDI boom in the latter part of the decade (figure 3). In both regions, the distribution\nof FDI stocks is generally quite uneven across countries. This is especially true for Latin\nAmerica where Brazil, Mexico and Argentina comprise roughly 90% of German FDI stocks.\nFigure 3: Distribution of German FDI Stocks Across Asia\n(in % of sample country total)\nYears\nPhilippines\nChina\nThailand\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nIndia\nKorea\nSingapore\nFigure 2: Distribution of German FDI Stocks Across Latin America\n(in % of sample country total)\nYears\nVenezuela\nChile\nColombia\nArgentina\nMexico\nBrazil\n2.2 Exogenous Variables\nIn the vast FDI literature a great many explanatory variables are employed to explain cross-\nborder capital flows. Over time, however, a distinctive set of factors frequently used in\neconometric modeling has emerged. Lim (2001), surveying the FDI literature, comes up with\na list of seven important factors: size of the host market, agglomeration effects, factor costs,\nfiscal incentives, business/investment climate, trade barriers/openness, and economic\ndistance/transport costs. The latter factor can be neglected in this study as the host countries\nincluded are all located overseas and thus more or less equally far away from the country of\nFDI origin, Germany. Theory and empirical evidence on the determinants cited above are\nreviewed in the following section (for details on the variables used see table 11, Appendix).\nMarket Size/Level of Income\nAmong the traditional variables, GDP or GDP per capita is widely used in the literature as a\nproxy for market size or purchasing power. Lim (2001) finds market size in terms of the size\nof the whole economy (absolute real GDP) or the level of income (GDP per capita) to be the\nmost robust determinant, although both factors depict quite different market characteristics. In\nvirtually all the studies surveyed, either indicator of market size is highly positively\nsignificant. This finding is validated by Chakrabarti (2001) for 18 studies in the past 30 years.\nSince the endogenous variable is already scaled to GDP and as absolute real GDP, by virtue\nof favoring large populations, is a rather poor indicator of market potential, the paper includes\nGDP per capita, GDPCAP, following Chakrabarti (2001) who finds this variable strongly\npositively related to scaled (per-capita) FDI in an extreme bounds analysis (see section 3.2)\nWage Competitiveness\nCost competitiveness \u00ad especially relevant for efficiency-seeking FDI \u00ad is probably best\nexpressed by productivity-adjusted real wages, assuming that labor is largely immobile and\nlabor costs therefore differ across countries, while other cost drivers such as capital and\nintermediate goods are traded on international markets with price-equalizing effects.31\nMoreover, measuring capital productivity is more difficult than deriving unit labor costs, due\nto the widespread unavailability of capital stocks at market values and capital goods price\nindices as suitable deflators.32\nAmong empirical studies, Barrell and Pain (1996) find a much smaller long-run elasticity for\nrelative capital costs than for relative labor costs. Using unit labor cost indices, the authors\nalso detect a positive relationship between U.S. unit labor costs relative to those abroad and\nthe level of outward FDI, i.e. a negative impact of rising relative labor costs seen from the\nangle of the host countries. Hubert and Pain (1999) argue that unit labor costs already include\n\u00ad apart from deviations from average productivity levels \u00ad differences in labor quality. For\nthis reason, Lehmann (1999) negates the necessity of including an educational attainment or\n\"skill\" variable when testing unit labor costs in his regressions. Mody et al. (1999) find for\nJapanese FDI in Asia that it is mainly driven by high-quality labor and not merely by cheap\nlabor abroad, the coefficients of which are, in fact, insignificant. Measuring labor quality by\nsecondary schooling rates may, as they argue, be misleading, as quality is more related to\nindustrial experience \u00ad i.e. on-the-job performance \u00ad rather than formal educational\nattainments.33 Also, one should not underestimate the time lag with which improvements in\nschool enrollment are manifested in a more productive workforce. Testing for effects of\nsecondary school enrollment on FDI inflows to 36 developing countries, Noorbakhsh et al.\n(2001) report strong significance for this skill variable \u00ad but only if productivity-adjusted\nwages are excluded from the regression. While educational attainment does seem to matter,\nthis particular finding leads to the conclusion that a skill variable may not add a great deal of\nnew information in the presence of labor productivity measures. By contrast, Wheeler and\nMody (1992) and Wei (2000) find a positive relationship between wages (not productivity-\nadjusted) and FDI inflows to developing countries.\nHere, the wage variable is unit labor costs, ULC, which is defined as the labor costs per\nworker in manufacturing divided by the gross value added per worker in manufacturing.34\nIdeally, weighted labor costs for all sectors of the economy should be used, but it is only for\nthe manufacturing sector that data are available across all countries in the sample. Still, such a\nlack of reliable time series data on indigenous costs (p. 203).\n33 Survey results reported by the authors allegedly indicate that, despite lower secondary enrollment rates, labor\nquality in Thailand is higher than in the Philippines.\n34 This measure conforms to the definition recommended by the Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches\ncompute unit labor costs on the basis of total earnings of labor in manufacturing expressed in US dollars divided\nby value added in manufacturing at current prices expressed in constant purchasing power parity (PPP) rates.\nThis ratio allows for relating labor costs to output per unit of time, with the resulting unit labor costs being\nexpressed in terms of a common currency. The merit of this approach is that currency fluctuations influencing\nthe value added are excluded. However, computing unit labor costs on this basis would require data on pure host\ncountry output (i.e. units produced per year) which is generally not available for less developed countries; see\ngeneralization is not uncommon in FDI research.35 Barrell and Pain (1999) also use\nmanufacturing unit labor costs for their country-level estimations, and later in their paper run\na separate regression for Japanese FDI flows to manufacturing sectors abroad.\nTrade Barriers/Openness of the Economy\nTraditionally, direct investment was used by foreign firms to circumvent trade barriers\n(\"tariff-hopping\") and thus to establish market presence by physically erecting production\nfacilities or buying existing ones abroad. It has been argued that host country governments\nwill be more likely to establish trade barriers if a particular domestic industry facing import\npenetration is still at an infant stage or if the product life cycle is already beyond the hump.36\nOn the other hand, incipient trade restrictions may prompt anticipatory or \"quid pro quo\"\ndirect investment. In that sense, the possibility of FDI, or \"threat of FDI\", may limit the level\nof trade protection that the government can impose.37 In the past, import protection instituted\nby host governments promised such high rates of return to foreign investors that the efficiency\nof the subsidiaries was not viewed as a major concern. However, as the majority of emerging\neconomies have chosen to ease restrictions on imports, so-called \"market-seeking\" or\n\"horizontal\" direct investment is likely to have fallen over time38 (greater openness coinciding\nwith lower FDI inflows), giving way to \"efficiency-seeking\" or \"vertical\" direct investment\nthat requires a liberal trade environment. This newer form of direct investment aims at\nexploiting sources of competitiveness such as lower (unit) labor costs, a skilled workforce or\na more conducive business environment.39 A high degree of openness is required for\nstimulating vertical FDI which relies on substantial flows of intermediate inputs and goods in\nand out of the host country. In sum, the overall impact of trade barriers is uncertain and\ndepends on the nature of FDI (horizontal versus vertical) undertaken in each case.\nWhile the case for trade barriers fostering FDI inflows appears quite convincing, the\nrelationship between traditional openness measures and FDI is less clear. The \"natural\"\nopenness or outward orientation of an economy can be thought of as the trade intensity absent\nany interventionist policy measures. Thus, the ordinary openness proxy, trade intensity in\n35 Unit labor costs are not widely available for services despite that sector's growing importance in emerging\n38 As Nunnenkamp (2001b) notes, FDI was formerly preferred to trade by resource-abundant countries for\naccessing large amounts of capital necessary for resource extraction and foreign technical skills unavailable at\nhome. With the advent of trade liberalization and more integrated financial markets, \"resource-seeking\" FDI\nmay have decreased in importance relative to joint ventures or arm's-length trade deals that make use of growing\ndomestic expertise (p. 11).\ncategory: \"resource/asset-seeking\" FDI trying to capture host country advantages in raw materials, skilled labor,\ninnovative assets or physical infrastructure.\nterms of either share of imports or exports (or both) in GDP, constitutes a trade flow outcome\nmeasure and is confirmed as being influential for FDI inflows to developing countries by, for\nexample, Noorbakhsh et al. (2001) and Hausmann and Fern\u00e1ndez-Arias (2001). However,\nopenness measure be adjusted for structural, non-policy determinants of trade intensity such\nas geographic size, per-capita income or resource endowment.40 Doing so, Lehmann as well\nas Jost and Nunnenkamp find a significantly positive impact of trade openness in panel\nestimations for developing countries, whereas Wheeler and Mody (1992) report a negative\ncorrelation of their openness measure (index by Business International) with relative FDI\ninflows to manufacturing sectors. At any rate, the overall flow of trade relative to domestic\nactivity does not reveal the degree of trade distortion caused by other factors.41\nFurthermore, non-tariff barriers, existing in the form of quantitative restrictions, subsidies to\ndomestic producers, standards and regulations on import good characteristics, government\npurchasing policies and arbitrary customs procedures (commonly known as \"red tape\"), act in\na trade-distorting manner. Evidently, many of the aforementioned incidents are difficult to\nmeasure quantitatively42; in particular, a cross-country comparison would appear\n\"forbidding\".43 While price-impact measures (tariff equivalents, subsidy measures, effective\nrates of protection) undertaken by international organizations such as the OECD might\nprovide an answer, there are numerous data and information problems in isolating the\nimmediate impact of non-tariff restrictions, largely relating to the influence that market\nimperfections and exchange rate fluctuations exert on the price differentials surveyed.44 Even\nif it were possible to comprehensively quantify non-tariff barriers to trade, the severity of the\ndistortions would not be determined as those restrictions are generally not transparent in their\nPritchett (1997) cautions that none of those openness measures can compare trade policies\nboth across countries and over time because each of them was constructed to compare\ncountries during a different time period. This implies that they cannot plausibly used in a\npanel setting. Therefore, this study uses as a measure of trade barriers the share of taxes on\ninternational trade in current government revenue, DUTY, whereby a positive coefficient can\nbe expected for horizontal FDI. This very definition is used by Singh and Jun (1995), who\n40 The aforementioned authors suggest the use of residuals from a trade intensity regression which employs\nstructural country characteristics indicating the amount by which a country's openness differs from that expected\nfor a country of its size; see, for example, Pritchett (1997), p. 312.\n42 Barrell and Pain (1996) rightfully note in this context that \"such barriers are notoriously difficult to measure,\nespecially as the most effective barriers are those that are anticipated but not yet (if ever) implemented\" (p. 202).\nreport it as significantly positively correlated to relative FDI inflows for a set of 31\ndeveloping countries. A similar measure, namely the average level of tariffs (UNCTAD data),\nis tested by Pritchett (1997) in regressions for 72 developing countries. It is the only variable\nto be significantly correlated to both the openness measure by Leamer (1988)46 and an\nindicator of non-tariff barriers.47 In addition, this study checks the validity of a conditioned\nopenness variable, OPEN, i.e. modified trade intensity measured by the residuals of regressing\nthe logs of GDP per capita and population on a given host country's trade intensity (imports\nand exports as share of GDP). The coefficient should be positive for vertical FDI.\nExternal Indebtedness\nDespite being an important indicator of a country's solvency often foreshadowing an\nimminent financial crisis, measures of foreign indebtedness are used in FDI research less\noften than for analyzing other capital flows. At the theoretical level, Ghura and Goodwin\n(2000) argue that a rising external debt ratio, indicating a debt overhang, induces economic\nagents to anticipate future tax liabilities to service the debt. If the integration of capital\nmarkets is rather low, the ensuing capital flight would then raise the domestic cost of capital.\nApart from conceivable political reverberations, this effect is likely to negatively impact the\noverall profitability of foreign subsidiaries. Arguments from corporate finance theory48 may\nbe transposed to the macro level in the sense that a relatively high degree of risky debt may\nweaken a country's ability to realize growth possibilities via new investment. A valuable real\noption may be forgone if the additional investment and payments to bondholders (in case the\noption is exercised) exceed the value of the investment. On the other hand, if the debt level of\nthe host country is still below a certain level perceived critical by investors, this consideration\nmay not apply and FDI flows may actually increase with rising external indebtedness.\nThe aforementioned profitability argument is also put forward by Agarwal et al. (1991) who\nin addition advance the notion that unbearable indebtedness may lead to an arbitrary default\non sovereign debt and, subsequently, to expropriations and restrictions on the capital account.\nThe authors test their hypotheses empirically by including in their estimations for German\nFDI to developing countries in the 1980s a variable that proxies debt overhang. For lack of\ndata on market valuation of emerging market debt, they, methodically questionably, employ\nthe change in undifferentiated country risk49 throughout the decade and find that, unlike\n46 Leamer (1988) constructs both an openness and a trade distortion index that measure deviations from trade\nflows predicted by a modified Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model, using data from 1982.\nweighted percent of tariff codes lines covered by various types of non-tariff barriers (licenses, quotas,\nprohibitions) as a percentage of all tariff code lines within the aggregate (p. 314).\n49 Risk index used is by Institutional Investor. To differentiate the supposed debt overhang variable from the one\nused for measuring country risk (see section 2.2.2), in that estimation only sample countries with initially\nfavorable index ratings were included; see Agarwal et al. (1991), p. 81.\nforeign investors as a whole, German firms did not restrict their exposure when country\nratings plummeted. Among the few empirical studies to consider the level of external debt,\nPistoresi (2000) reports a significantly negative coefficient for emerging markets' foreign\ndebt per capita which is especially relevant for the Latin American sub-sample.\nAs the measure of external indebtedness carries only a minor weight in the composite PRS\ncountry risk rating (5%), a separate variable, DEBT, measuring the ratio of host country\nexternal debt to GDP, was added to the regressions in recognition of the postulated impact of\nrising indebtedness on FDI outcomes.\nA further issue in the area of public finances relates to taxation. The case for measuring the\nnegative influence of high corporate tax rates abroad appears clear: by depressing after-tax\ninvestment returns, high tax rates discourage FDI inflows. The problem with using statutory\ntax rates or the share of corporate tax receipts in GDP is that the former is generally biased\nupward because of numerous tax exemptions (apart from not being a good variable in a panel\nsetting because of little variation from year to year) while the latter effectively measures\ngovernment collection of taxes in a given year that may differ from the year in which German\ncompanies actually pay their taxes. Moreover, in the taxation literature effective marginal tax\nrates incorporating data on statutory corporate tax rates, inflation rates, depreciation\nallowances for assets and discount rates for financing are increasingly utilized. The obstacle\nto an empirical investigation of the distorting effects of fiscal policy on FDI is that these\nmarginal tax rates are readily available only for industrialized or at best OECD countries as\nthe computation of marginal tax rates for developing economies for cross-section applications\nis seriously hampered by data availability.50 Hence, a taxation variable is omitted in this\npaper.\n2.2.2 Non-Traditional Variables\nThis section gives an overview of the literature on non-traditional factors, with emphasis on\nthe research previously undertaken in the area of governance.\nCountry Risk/Political Risk\nMost studies reviewed here control for specific measures of host country political risk. Only\nsome refer to a broader definition of country risk, as is the case in the aforementioned study\nby Jost and Nunnenkamp (2002). For example, Mody/Srinivasan (1998) find a strong\ncorrelation between country safeness (measured by the Institutional Investor index) and host\ncountry share of U.S. FDI outflows by means of the within estimator.\nThe issue of political risk has attracted more interest among researchers. In a pioneering paper\nSchneider and Frey (1985) furnish evidence that in emerging markets political and\nsocioeconomic factors are relevant on top of the \"classical\" macro factors. As the authors\nshow, estimation results for FDI inflows into industrial as well as developing countries are\nsignificantly improved if also controlling for governance variables such as political instability\nand the ideological thrust of government. Similarly, Beyer (2002) in a study of transition\ncountries shows that the fit of his regressions improves when combining both economic and\npolitical variables relating to the base year of transition. The author finds political factors\ndepicted by the Freedom House Economic Freedom Index or the efficacy of privatization\nbureaus to have great explanatory power. Stevens (2000), investigating plant and equipment\nspending of U.S. corporations in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, shows that the inclusion of\npolitical factors detrimental to the operations and earnings of U.S. investors \u00ad occasional hostile\nattitude of government towards FDI, occurrence of a debt crisis, devaluations in a fixed-\nexchange-rate system, existence of exchange controls or repatriation restrictions \u00ad improves\nthe regression's goodness-of-fit for Argentina greatly (R-squared rises from 0.19 to 0.90).51\n\"Headline\" political risk, or rather the absence thereof, is found to be a driving factor of\ndeveloping country FDI inflows by Singh and Jun (1995), who subject a composite variable\nmerging six internal causes of political risk (as defined by BERI) to econometric testing.\nBrunetti and Weder (1997) examine the most prominent uncertainty measures in investment\nregressions using the same specifications while holding constant the sample of 60 countries as\nwell as the time period (1974-1989). They find a number of categories (with individual\nvariables) \u00ad government instability (revolutions), political violence (political executions/war\ncasualties), political uncertainty (black market premium on foreign exchange, variation of real\nexchange rate distortion) \u00ad that are consistently significant at least at the 5 percent level and\nthus robust to changes in specification. Comparable insights are related by Pfeffermann et al.\nWithin the set of political risk measures one can distinguish between corruption alias\nadministrative deficiencies and governmental instability in the host country. The question of\nhow devastating corruption can be is investigated by Wei (2000) who evaluates OECD data\non industrial countries' FDI flows to 45 economies. Higher taxation and higher corruption are\nshown to reduce inward FDI by 4.8% and 26%, respectively (using the Business International\nrisk index). The author asserts that corruption and political stability are negatively correlated,\narguing that corruption may breed public discontent which may eventually topple the\ngovernment or alternatively induce short time horizons among officials. Studying the impact\nof wide-spread corruption on the rate of private investment in developing countries, Everhart\nand Sumlinski (2001) find an indirect negative effect of corruption via the quality of public\n51 The regression for Brazil shows a lesser improvement; for Mexico the adjustment is only marginally positive.\ninvestment. Put differently, any given level of public investment will be characterized by a\nhigher quality than would be the case with a higher degree of corruption present.52 As\nLehmann (2002) argues, poor governance introduces asymmetric information, thereby raising\nagency costs of market participants incurred in dealing with supervisory agencies.\nConsequently, increasing capital costs obstruct inflows of FDI substantially.\nBubnova (2000) contends that corruption acts to prevent democratic development and results\nin poor infrastructure. In relating governance to risks facing private infrastructure investment\n(measured by spreads of emerging market infrastructure bonds) she identifies four clusters of\nstrong positive relationships in the set of explanatory variables: in addition to economic\nperformance and religion-induced tensions, which play a lesser role in the sample countries\nhere, political factors include regulatory risk (corruption/bureaucratic delays/contract\nenforceability) and political disorder risk (domestic conflict/expropriation risk). Corruption\nand autocracy risk account for most of the bond spread variation. For a subset of weak-\ngovernance countries the political risk measure has the largest influence on the bond spread,\nand the R-squared is significantly higher than for the set of stable countries.\nBy contrast, Singh and Jun (1995) and Hubert and Pain (1999) fail to find significance for the\noccurrence of strikes53 in developing and non-EU countries, respectively. The same goes for\nGerman FDI flows to developing countries in the 1980s, as shown by Agarwal et al. (1991).\nSingh and Jun do, however, report a significantly negative coefficient for strikes in a sub-\nsample of \"low FDI countries\" where standoffs are more frequent.\nIn light of this overwhelming evidence, the bottom line of research on governance issues is\nthat high country/political risk does represent an obstacle to higher inflows of FDI capital.\nAccordingly, several measures of country and, more specifically, differentiated political risk\nare used here. The risk data were obtained from two professional providers of country risk\nestimates, the Political Risk Services Group (in short: PRS) with its International Country\nRisk Guide54 and the business magazine Euromoney with its bi-annual country risk surveys.55\n52 See also Tanzi and Davoodi (2000), p. 12, who argue that poor public infrastructure due to corruption is likely\nto reduce private productivity and thus depress a country's growth prospects. Interestingly, the authors find that\nof 53 countries in the 1990s, those with high corruption tended to have a higher ratio of lawyers to engineers.\nThus, they conclude: \"Ceteris paribus, it would seem that a more corrupt society needs more lawyers\" (p. 13).\n53 Number of work days lost in each of the host countries through strikes (Hubert and Pain) or industrial and\n54 The PRS Group uses estimates based on information collected by its own staff which results in the publication\nof 22 variables in three subcategories for 140 countries on a monthly basis. For more information see\nhttp://www.prsgroup.com/commonhtml/methods.html#_International_Country_Risk and, more specifically,\nhttp://www.icrgonline.com/icrgMethods.asp.\n1992, no such variable could be derived from the Euromoney data. The country risk score is calculated using\nnine individual, weighted categories; for explanation of the different categories see Euromoney (1997), pp. 60-\n62. The individual scores are based on a survey of economists at leading financial and economic institutions.\nBoth indices assign high scores to \"safe\" countries. Far from being the only sources of\ncountry risk information,56 these publications enjoy a good reputation among researchers\nSumlinski (2001); Euromoney data used by Ramcharran (1999) and Jost and Nunnenkamp\n(2002)) and supply continuous data for the relevant time period. Inevitably subjective, the\nsurvey data often provide the best information available on the less visible aspects of\ngovernance, and such perceptions are frequently as important as hard-to-obtain evidence.58\nFigure 4 illustrates how country risk in both regions evolved throughout the last decade. Note\nthat both country risk measures include the respective political risk rating. To isolate genuine\nmacroeconomic risk, which, incidentally, could also be picked up by the variation in other\nvariables, the variable PRSERISK was formed. Following the approach of Bubnova (2000)\n56 As already hinted at, there are in fact many more, such as Freedom House, Business International, Transparency\nInternational, to name just a few professional ones. Furthermore, risk indices have been developed by academics\nand international development institutions (such as the World Bank's Country Policy Institutional Assessment).\nSome of the risk indices could not be used in the first place, either because the period covered did not match this\nstudy's time frame or because the index did not report data for the emerging markets examined in this study.\n57 For example, Brunetti/Weder (1997) find PRS' corruption measure more comprehensive (and more\nsignificant) than that of Business International because the former does not focus on narrow business\ntransactions but rather \"asks whether high government officials are likely to demand special payments and\nwhether illegal payments are generally expected throughout lower levels of government\" (p. 14). Conversely,\nWei (2000) criticizes that PRS does not reveal how the ratings are derived (p. 3). The PRS Group itself \u00ad at\nwww.idrgonline.com/icrgMethods.asp \u00ad asserts that its measure of corruption is \"more concerned with actual or\npotential corruption in the form of excessive patronage, job reservations, `favor-for-favors', secret party funding,\nand suspiciously close ties between politics and business\".\n58 See Bubnova (2000), p. 11. Inherent subjectivity makes comparisons of individual risk assessments difficult,\ninspiring Kaufmann et al. (1999) to embark on aggregating indicators from several sources into a meta index.\nFigure 4: Country Risk in emerging Latin America and Asia\n(regional averages)\nYears\nRisk score\nPRS Group/Latin America PRS Group/Asia Euromoney/Latin America Euromoney/Asia\ndescribed above, in this paper the political risk dimension is further divided into subcategories\nof orderly business dealings, i.e. corruption and autocracy risks, called PRSADMIN, and of\npolitical disorder risks, PRSSTAB (see figure 5 for average political risk scores).59 Grouping\ncorruption and \"red tape\" due to their connectivity was brought up by Mauro (1995) as a more\nprecise measure of corruption than corruption alone.60\nAccordingly, the variable PRSADMIN can be thought of as a measure of administrative\nuncertainty surrounding official decisions that immediately affect foreign investors (at the\n\"micro-level\"). It involves subjective assessments of the degree of corruption (with a high\nrating meaning a low degree of \"sleaze\"), the quality of the bureaucracy (high score for\ncountries where the bureaucracy has the strength and expertise to govern without drastic\nchanges in policy or interruptions in government services), and the so-called investment\nprofile (measuring risk of expropriation, restrictions on profit repatriation61 and payment\ndelays, again with high points for low-risk countries). This exact specification was tested by\nPistoresi (2000) who, as expected, finds a significantly negative relationship between FDI\ninflows to a similar set of emerging markets and this combined administrative quality\nvariable, which, in that case, depicts an inefficient and undependable bureaucracy.\nThe same result holds true in Pistoresi's estimations for a measure of political instability.62 In\nthis study, the corresponding variable PRSSTAB is composed of \"macro-level\" factors foreign\nfirms have to put up with: the stability of the government (assessing both of the government's\nability to carry out its declared programs and its ability to stay in office), the aspect of law and\norder (evaluating the strength and impartiality of the legal system as well as the degree of\npopular observance of the law), and the prevalence of internal conflict (the highest rating\nbeing given to countries without armed opposition to the government and absence of arbitrary\ngovernmental violence, direct or indirect, against its own people; lowest rating given to a\ncountry embroiled in an on-going civil war). Figure 5 describes the development of political\nrisk scores and their sub-components across regions.\n59 Other subcategories of PRS' political risk measure \u00ad external conflict, socioeconomic conditions, military in\npolitics, religion in politics, ethnic tensions, democratic accountability \u00ad were omitted because they largely\npertain to developing countries and do not seem to play a decisive role in the countries assessed in this study.\n60 Wide-spread corruption may lead to further bureaucratic delay as a result of officials \"dragging their feet\"\nuntil receiving the expected bribe.\n61 The issue of repatriation restrictions facing multinational enterprises, a specific facet of political risk, is\nshe employs is able to capture the effect of such restrictions on capital investment and technology transfer to the\nBrazilian subsidiaries. Partial remittance restrictions are shown to cause multinationals to remit funds to the\nhome country, whereas full blocking, logically, prompts reinvestment of funds. However, the Brazilian case\nsuggests that countries who notoriously impose restrictions or threaten to do so can increase foreign capital\ninvestment if they credibly abolish these restrictions.\nAgglomeration Effects\nThere is considerable disagreement in the literature as to what exactly constitutes\nagglomeration. Some authors equate clustering effects of that kind with the size of the\nexisting FDI stock (perhaps lagged) or \"herding\" of foreign firms, whereas others perceive the\nquality of the host country's infrastructure as a suitable proxy.63 Positive spillover effects\nthrough the widespread establishment of foreign subsidiaries play a prominent role.\nCommonly, once a large multinational corporation sets up shop in one location, others will\nquickly follow suit (\"follow-the-leader\" effect). This is because foreign firms unable to enter\nin the same period as the leader does will incur a large welfare loss compared to a scenario\nwhere all firms enter more or less simultaneously. In the extreme, potential late entrants may\nnot get a foothold in the market because of the productivity advantage already attained by the\nfirst mover.64 Well-known examples of such positive agglomeration effects are typified by\nautomobile production in Mexico or the Asian electronics industry65 as well as high-tech\nmanufacturing FDI in Ireland.66\nIn an innovate study on that issue, Wheeler and Mody (1992) check both factors \u00ad clustering\nof FDI inflows and quality of the infrastructure \u00ad on their validity for 42 developing and\n63 See Lim (2001), p. 7. As an example for quality-of-infrastructure-proxies, Razin (2002) finds a high positive\nsignificance of developing country telephone density for FDI inflows (p. 10).\n66 Respondents to a survey among foreign investors in several technology-oriented manufacturing industries\nstated that their location decision was influenced by the fact that other key markets were already located in\nFigure 5: Political Risk and its components\n(regional averages)\nYears\nRisk score\nPRSPRISK/Latin America PRSADMIN/Latin America PRSSTAB/Latin America\nindustrialized countries. Both coefficients are of the same magnitude and highly significant\nfor the manufacturing sector. The quality of infrastructure seems especially important for\ndeveloping countries, and specifically the electronics industry. Mody and Srinivasan (1998)\nexamine data on U.S. FDI to 35 countries and posit that the stock of past FDI is strongly\npositively correlated with current FDI inflows in all estimations, whereas the infrastructure\nvariable (output of electricity per GDP) is found to be significant only if measured by the\n\"between\" estimator, having the authors conclude that only major infrastructure investment\nmay act to attract investors. Lehmann (1999) uses lagged U.S. total investment as proxy for\nagglomeration and finds it to be significantly positive in all regressions. A first-mover effect\nis observed by Mody et al. (1999) in a strong partial correlation between a Japanese firm's\nplans to invest in elsewhere in Asia and its expectation of competitors having similar plans.\nBraunerhjelm and Svensson (1996) examine agglomeration effects on the industry level,\nregressing the relative share of a particular industry in total manufacturing employment. The\nresults of a Tobit estimation imply that in terms of agglomeration \"the more important the\nindustry of the investing firm is in the host country, the more the firm's affiliate will produce\nin that country\" (p. 837) or, interpreted differently, the higher the probability that FDI has\noccurred. Agglomeration effects are found to be most pronounced in high-tech industries.\nThe agglomeration variable used here, AGGLO, is defined as the moving-three year average\nof contemporary and lagged total FDI inflows relative to respective host country GDP. Note\nthat this is not simply a partially lagged endogenous variable since it recurs to FDI flows from\nthe rest of the world and not just Germany. The variable aims at capturing both first-mover\nadvantage effects (by including contemporary flows) and the magnitude of privately supplied\ninfrastructure abroad over the past couple of years.\nCorporate Financing Conditions\nRarely used in empirical research, the varying availability of relatively low-cost internal\nfinancing should intuitively play a fundamental role in the magnitude and timing of corporate\ninvestment decisions, particularly with respect to efficiency-seeking FDI. Cushman (1985)\nincludes a corporate cash flow variable which he lags by one year and finds significantly\npositively correlated to U.S. FDI to industrialized countries. Barrell and Pain (1996) add to\ntheir regressions for outward U.S. FDI lagged corporate profits (significantly positive).\nThe relevance of the level of corporate profits for Germany is underscored by Heiduk and\nHodges (1992) in a case study of the investment activity of German multinationals. The\nauthors purport that, given the higher volatility of foreign compared to domestic investment,\nGerman firms facing financial distress tend to trim FDI before they decrease domestic\ninvestment.\nAs using cash flows generated within the firm is arguably the most inexpensive way of\nfinancing investment, this study incorporates the lagged aggregated cash flow of German\nfirms normalized to total corporate assets, CFLOW. Note that there is logically no variation\nacross host countries such that the variable can be rendered significant only by fluctuations\nover time. Put differently, CFLOW resembles a time dummy of changeable magnitude.\nReal Exchange Rate (Volatility)\nThere are opposing views on the impact of the real exchange rate (RER) on FDI inflows. An\nupward movement in the host country's RER may stir fear of protectionism among foreign\ninvestors and lead them to invest abroad in anticipation of additional trade barriers.67\nConversely, Froot and Stein (1991) show that under credit rationing, i.e. imperfect capital\nmarkets, a (real) exchange rate depreciation induces foreign investors' wealth to rise, enabling\nthem to outbid their competitors abroad for information-intensive assets having monitoring\ncosts. Therefore, aggregate FDI flows will increase in proportion to a depreciation of the\ndomestic currency.68 Razin (2002) illustrates a similar wealth effect: foreign firms would be\nput at an advantage over domestic borrowers by being able to post more valuable collateral in\nborrowing from domestic banks.69 Yet, as Ghura and Goodwin (2000) point out, the overall\nimpact of a real depreciation is uncertain, as imported inflation raises the price of investment\ngoods and consequently depresses investment.70 In the arguably most relevant empirical\ninvestigation on exchange rate volatility with respect to this study, Goldberg and Klein (1997)\nfind that a depreciation in the bilateral RER of large Asian countries to the yen attracts FDI\ninflows from Japan while FDI from the U.S. falls. Interestingly, U.S. flows do not react to\nchanges in the bilateral RER to the dollar,71 nor are there significant effects for the Latin\nAmerican sub-sample. To avoid colinearity with the unit labor cost variable,72 the main model\nforgoes a particular exchange rate variable in levels. However, the significance of the\nbilateral real exchange rate, RER, is tested in a separate regression excluding labor costs.\n68 See Froot and Stein (1991), p. 1202. This shift in relative wealth is caused by nominal exchange rate\nmovements that not matched by domestic price level adjustments, rendering deviations from purchasing power\nparity possible.\n69 This effect naturally applies mostly to mergers and acquisitions and less to greenfield investment. However,\nthe latter can be expected to grow, too, as (nominal) exchange rate depreciations \u00ad according to the \"relative\nlabor cost theory\" \u00ad give foreign production a competitive edge in labor costs over domestic output and will thus\n70 Generally speaking, a widely-perceived deviation of the real exchange rate from its estimated equilibrium\nlevel may affect long-run investment decisions via a shift in relative production costs; see Barrell and Pain\n71 This may be due to the fact that real and nominal exchange rates of the sample countries were closely related\nas the observed weight of the US dollar in Asian currency baskets was often between 90 and 100 percent; see\nGoldberg and Klein (1997), p. 21. Hence, movements in RER to the dollar were either caused by very strong\nshifts in exchange rates to other currencies within the basket or by bilateral inflation differentials.\n72 This would expressly apply to those countries with fixed exchange rate regimes or de facto nominal exchange\nrate stability over the sample period.\nIt is, however, quite justified to look beyond pure level effects. The expectation of short-term\nchanges in exchange rates may influence the timing of investment transactions: for example,\nfirms may precipitate payments in currencies expected to appreciate.73 In the area of exchange\nrate volatility, several theoretical studies show that higher variability is positively correlated\nand Kolstad (1995), and Sung and Lapan (2000)). In a theoretical model based on the view\ntaken in the real options literature, Sung and Lapan demonstrate that by erecting more than\none production facility, i.e. opening another plant abroad, and postponing the decision as to\nwhere to produce, a multinational firm acquires a real option whose value increases with\ngreater exchange rate fluctuations.75 They posit that more volatile exchange rates induce the\nrelative value of opening the foreign plant to rise. This contradicts the traditional view that\nfirms would then reconsider foreign investment to reduce their risk exposure.76 Depending on\nthe degree of volatility, firms will open only the foreign plant or both.77 Therefore, high\nexchange rate variability will promote FDI outflows to alternative production sites.\nThis hypothesis is confirmed by several empirical studies. Stockman and Vlaar (1996)\nobserve that higher exchange rate volatility significantly increases the growth rate of Dutch\nFDI outflows.78 A similar result is found by Hubert and Pain (1999) who test both real and\nnominal exchange rate fluctuations separately for German data and find that nominal\nexchange rate volatility negatively impacts FDI outflows, whereas the reverse holds for the\nreal exchange rate. The latter finding is, as the authors point out, consistent with the\nproduction shifting hypothesis. Love and Lage-Hidalgo (2000), testing whether past volatility\nin the US$-peso rate affects FDI flows to Mexico, also report a strongly positive coefficient.79\nIn this study, exchange rate volatility is therefore modeled along the lines of Hubert and Pain\n(1999) by constructing a two-year moving average of past real exchange rate fluctuations. It\nis important to note that, contrary to some of the previously mentioned studies that simply\n74 Aizenman (1992) shows that under a flexible exchange rate higher volatility of monetary shocks induces\ndisparities in the real wage at home and abroad, and thus induces geographic diversification via foreign direct\ninvestment, while concurrently lowering aggregate investment (pp. 909, 914).\n75 The real option's value is calculated as the expected value of additionally opening the plant abroad, i.e. value\nof the firm with both plants exclusive of the value of merely the home plant, minus the sunk cost incurred by\nopening the foreign plant. It is shown that the differential profits increase with higher exchange rate volatility;\n78 The authors do not specify whether they test nominal or real exchange rate fluctuations.\n79 Furthermore, Barrell and Pain (1996) find that an expectation of a depreciation in the host country's currency\nwill postpone US investment. Cushman (1985) reports rising U.S. FDI to G7-countries in response to an increase\nin the standard deviation of the expected change in the real exchange rate. By contrast, Sin and Leung (2001) do\nnot find a strong impact of the nominal exchange rate on flows to developing countries up to 1992.\nfirst-difference the exchange rate, here volatility is measured as the variance of the indexed\nreal exchange rate over past years, i.e. regardless of the direction of the individual change:\n\u00e5\n= +\n-\n+\n-\n-\n\u00f7\n\u00f7\n\u00f8\n\u00f6\n\u00e7\n\u00e7\n\u00e8\n\u00e6 -\n=\n,\n,\n,\n,\nlog\n.\nk k\nt\ni\nk\nt\ni\nk\nt\ni\nt\nRER\nRER\nwhere RERi,t\nis the real exchange rate between Germany and the ith country in a given year.80\nStructural Reforms\nRecent studies have been increasingly incorporating structural reform measures in FDI host\ncountries. The intuition is that current or envisaged reforms in the regulatory realm will\npositively affect investment conditions for foreign firms over the longer term. However,\nduring such adjustment periods FDI flows may actually dwindle, as is shown by Tuman and\nDuring a given year of implementing economic adjustments, the sample countries received an\naverage of roughly $30 million less in FDI. Agarwal et al. (1991) fail to find a positive impact\nof lagged World Bank adjustment loans on total German FDI flows to developing countries.\nA genuine measure of structural reform has been developed by Lora (2001, drawing on earlier\nwork of 1997). This unique meta-index for Latin American countries consists of five\nsubcategories (trade, financial, tax and labor market reforms, and privatization) measured by\nindividual indices and now covers the period from 1985 to 1999. Lora himself does not\nsubject his data to econometric testing, but Fern\u00e1ndez-Arias and Montiel (2001) do so,\nexploring how structural effects, which the index measures, relate to growth in Latin America\nup to 1995. Reassuringly, they find that Lora's structural policy index contains independent\ninformation not already captured by four other stabilization regressors.81 In fact, the index's\ncoefficient is significantly positive and eliminates the unexplained excess of Latin American\ngrowth (low growth despite reforms)82 observed in their baseline regressions. To test whether\nthis holds true for the impact of structural reforms on FDI flows, Lora's recently updated\nindex, called STRUCT, is included in the estimations for the Latin American sub-sample.\n80 Real exchange rates computed using consumer price indices. The RER itself is normalized to base year 1990.\nAn increase in the RER denotes a real appreciation of the host country's currency. The variances are measured as\nthe squared annual differences relative to the previous year. One could have used unit labor costs as indicator of\nthe real exchange rate as proposed by Hubert and Pain (1999, p. 174) but doing so would mean neglecting\nchanges in the nominal exchange rate and thus a greater degree of noise; see Barrell and Pain (1996), p. 202.\n81 These are: lower public consumption (relative to GDP), lower inflation, financial deepening (broad money to\nGDP), exchange rate unification (black market premium), and, allegedly, trade intensity (imports and exports to\n82 This often-voiced \"puzzle\" is discarded by the authors \"in the sense that unidentified region-specific factors\ndepressed growth in Latin America during the 1990s, offsetting the large positive growth impetus of the\nreforms\". They conclude that \"the growth response of recent reform in Latin America \u00ad that is, its marginal\n3. Methodology\nIn the following sections, the estimation method selected for the study is described, followed\nby a presentation of the procedure of selecting robust variables and, finally, the econometric\nresults at both the country and industry level.\n3.1 Estimation Method\nIn principle, the parameters for each country could be estimated, however inefficiently, by\nordinary least squares (OLS). Given the geographic proximity of the countries in question to\none another, it would be a strong assumption that each cross section behaves entirely\nindependent of the others, particularly given the fact that the model assigns the same\nparameter vector to all units (countries).83 Therefore, the error terms in the FDI equations are\nlikely to include factors common to all sample countries and thus to be correlated between\ncross sections at a given time. This supposition renders a pooled analysis of FDI data using\nthe SUR84 estimation method more efficient than applying OLS to each country separately\nsince the common, immeasurable influences are accounted for. The SUR technique allows for\nintegrating contemporaneous correlation by estimating the full variance-covariance matrix of\nthe system's disturbance vector. This, of course, requires that the panel be balanced. Another\nprerequisite for using SUR estimation is that T be greater than N, otherwise the feasible GLS\nestimator cannot be calculated.85\nTo obtain general results for each region, only one coefficient per regressor is estimated (and\nthe subscript of \u00df dropped). Thus, in the stacked form the regression model is:\n.\n\nX\ny\ny\ny\n\n\n\n\u00df\nX\nX\nX\ny\ny\ny\nM\nM\nM\nM\n+\n=\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\n+\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\n=\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\nM\nM\nL\nO\nL\nL\nM\nor (II)\nUnder the assumption that the disturbances are uncorrelated across observations, the\ndisturbance system becomes:86\n84 Seemingly Unrelated Regressions. For a good overview on SUR techniques see Dielman (1989), pp. 29-47,\n85 See Greene (2003), p. 322.

The GLS estimator in the SUR case, therefore, is:\n[ ] .\n^ y\nV\nX\nX\nV\nX\n-\n- \n\n= (IV)\nIn addition, the SUR estimation with STATA provides for including a first-order\nautoregressive (AR(1)) process.

With these, the SUR estimation method does, in a sense,\ncontain dynamic elements which would substitute for a full-fledged dynamic estimation if,\nsay, the common AR(1) coefficient were sufficiently small (less than 0.2, for example).\nTherefore, FDI panel data may be estimated by a static model if the influence of lagged\ncoefficients and thus the dynamics of the source data are shown to be weak.\nTo test whether the off-diagonal elements of V are indeed non-zero, a likelihood ratio test,\nwhich is based on the likelihood ratio statistic88\n)\n^\nlog\n^\n(log\n)\nlog\n(log\nr\nu\nr T\nL\nW -\n=\n-\n-\n=\n (VI)\n88 See Greene (2003), p. 349.

The likelihood ratio statistic is\nasymptotically 2-distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the number of imposed\nrestrictions.\nIn sum, the SUR model allows for contemporaneous correlation of disturbances as well as\nfirst-order autocorrelation of the time series disturbances and cross-sectional\nheteroskedasticity. The log likelihood function will be instrumental in arriving at the correct\nspecification of the final model, as will be shown in section four.\n3.2 Selection of Variables\nSection 2.2 has illustrated that a wide variety of potential exogenous variables have been\ntested in the literature. While the merits of using a theoretical model as a basis for estimating\ndeterminants of direct investment are obvious, this study nonetheless employs an ad-hoc\nestimation, which tests an array of variables that in the literature have previously been found\nto be crucial for FDI flows. The problem of converting structural approaches to modeling FDI\ninto testable hypotheses lies primarily in the scarcity of economic data in developing\ncountries, both across years and types of determinants. This shortcoming has led authors\npursuing such an approach (inter alia, Lehmann (1999) and Stevens (2000)) to simplify their\nmodels, as the variables contained in the structural models were not readily available and thus\nneeded to be substituted by proxy variables in the subsequent regressions. Hence, while most\nresearchers would agree that apart from classical macroeconomic variables one has to account\nfor location factors such as agglomeration effects or idiosyncratic \"political\" risks pertaining\nto the maintenance of property rights, it is less clear exactly which of these factors belong in\nthe true regression in any one case.\nAlthough ad-hoc estimations are used here, the approach to selecting the model variables is\nnonetheless structural in the sense that only those variables are that are found to be robust in\nan iterative procedure based on the Extreme Bounds Analysis (EBA), originally suggested by\nLeamer (1983, 1985), are included in the final model. This test, as modified by Levine and\nRenelt (1992), defines those variables of interest, z, as robust if, in a regression of the form\n\n\n\n\n\n +\n+\n+\n+\n= \n\n j\nxj\nzj\nyj\nj x\nz\ny , (VII)\nthey are always significant when combined with each of the other variables, with y being a\nvector of fixed (\"free\") variables that are always included and xj\na vector of up to three\nvariables taken from the pool of N variables. The EBA performs alterations in this subset xj\nto\nfind the widest range of coefficient estimates on the variables of interest z, which is then\ndefined as robust if the lower extreme bound, being the lowest value of z j\n(slope\nparameter minus two times the standard deviation), and the corresponding upper extreme\nbound, z j\n, are either both negative or both positive.89 In other words, a statistical\nrelationship between the FDI flow variable and a variable of interest z is deemed robust if the\nlatter remains statistically significant at the five percent level with an unchanged sign when\nthe conditioning set of variables is subjected to changes (see figure 6, Appendix, for further\nclarification). Otherwise, one has reason to lack confidence in the relationship with the\nendogenous variable. Such a variable of interest is to be called \"fragile\" because it does not\ndisplay enough independent variation to explain cross-country differences in FDI.90\nThe method used in this study to arrive at the regression  differs from the proposed approach\nin that there is no vector of commonly used (fixed) variables in FDI research,91 with the\nexception of market size, usually proxied by GDP or GDP per capita. The lack of universally\nacknowledged standard regressors thus calls for preselecting fixed variables, much in the\nsame fashion as proposed for choosing the variables of interest, z. Accordingly, the set of\nfixed variables must first be determined by running the EBA solely with the variable of\ninterest and the conditioning information set. In some cases this initial procedure will turn out\nonly one robust variable in the \"first round\", which is then set as a fixed variable in the next\nround of regressions in order to find another variable that by virtue of this inclusion now\nbecomes robust as well. Now having a \"critical mass\" of regressors in place, these two\nvariables \u00ad not three, given the rather limited number of conditioning factors \u00ad will then be\nused in a \"full\" EBA to detect more robust factors.\nBecause of the normalization of the endogenous variable by relating it to GDP, market size\nhas effectively been rendered negligible and thus GDPCAP is included to control for\npurchasing power in the host country. Even so, this variable should not routinely be assumed\nto be one of the fixed variables but must also be subjected to the Extreme Bounds Analysis.\n89 See Sala-i-Martin (1997), pp. 2-4. The author criticizes this test as too strong because only one regression in\nwhich the coefficient sign changes suffices to reject the variable in question, thereby almost guaranteeing that all\nof the variables tested are labeled as non-robust. He suggests to consider the distribution of the z\nand use the\nfraction of the cumulative distribution function lying of each side of zero as robustness criterion. In the present\nstudy, however, the Extreme Bounds Analysis turns out to work nicely in accepting only a narrow number of\ntruly robust variables.\n91 Mauro (1995) applies the Levine/Renelt approach and a similar one by Barro (1991) to growth rates of\ninvestment to GDP and includes as fixed variables GDP, population growth and secondary education. The two\nlatter ones are, however, clearly non-standard in the FDI literature.\n4. Econometric Results\nFollowing a \"general-to-specific\" approach, first a model that includes all explanatory\nvariables is estimated. Subsequently, the list of variables is narrowed down to the ones found\nrobust in the Extreme Bounds Analysis. In addition, alternative variables for risk, cost, and\nopenness measure are estimated separately. The estimation outcome contains standardized\ncoefficients j\n* = j\n(sxj\n/sy\n) with sxj\nbeing the standard deviation of the jth exogenous variable\nand sy\nthe standard deviation of the endogenous variable.92 As a double-log linear model\nallowing the coefficients to be interpreted as elasticities was not feasible due to the occurrence\nof negative FDI flows, this standardization allows for comparing the \"weights\" with which\nthe individual variables enter the equation. The measure of goodness-of-fit has to be derived\nfrom the Wald test statistic and is therefore usually called \"pseudoR2\".93\nThe regression results for Latin America in table 1 provide a number of valuable insights.\nMost importantly, it is shown that country risk clearly matters in the region. Both risk indices,\nPRSCRISK in (1) and EMCRISK in (2), are strongly significant with the expected sign and carry\nthe greatest weight among the explanatory variables. Further decomposition of the risk aspect\nreveals that the economic risk measure, PRSERISK, if chosen instead of headline country risk\nis strongly positively significant and robust (coefficient = 0.3132, z-ratio = 4.68); upper\nthe political risk components, the index of administrative quality, PRSADLEA (replacing\nheadline political risk) is significant and correctly signed (\u00df = 0.2084, z = 2.37), whereas\nPRSSTAB, measuring domestic stability, is negatively correlated with FDI inflows.\nSecond, German FDI in that region seems to have been geared towards tapping markets\nprotected against imports94 over the sample period since the tariff variable, DUTY, is robustly\npositively significant while ULC, an indicator of efficiency-seeking FDI, is not. In addition,\nagglomeration effects have clearly spurred German FDI flows with a view to securing market\naccess in the face of strong competition from abroad. An alternative model (3) using the real\nexchange rate, RER, and the conditioned openness measure, OPEN, instead of unit labor costs\nuse of the likelihood ratio statistic (LR) which is asymptotically equivalent to the Wald test statistic (W).

Closer inspection of the data series\nreveals that there is a persistent improvement in index scores for almost all of the Latin\n95 On the other hand, as illustrated in section 1, even expectations of structural reforms suffice to prompt\ninvestment decisions. Therefore, one can expect actual reforms depicted in the index to contemporaneously\naffect decision-making.\nAmerican sample countries which contrasts sharply with the relatively high volatility of\nGerman FDI flows to the region. The negative correlation between FDI and the reform index\ncould also owe something to the fact that index scores rose excessively in the early 1990s\nwhen a wave of privatization set in. This is true of all sample countries with the exception of\nChile, whose privatization had already begun in the early 1980s.96 Soaring scores are,\nhowever, not mirrored by German FDI flows to the region in the early 1990s, presumably\nbecause German firms participated less in the privatization process than did investors from\nThe parsimonious \"final\" regression (4) shows that of the eight original variables, only three\nare robust according to the Extreme Bounds Analysis (see table 2). PRSCRISK and AGGLO\nhaving been selected by the initial procedure98 as the two fixed variables, the following EBA\nproduces only one more robust variable, namely DUTY. For Asia, the case is more clear-cut:\nULC and DUTY test robust in the initial procedure, and subsequently CFLOW is found to be the\nonly truly robust variable in addition.\nTable 2: Extreme Bounds Analysis \u00ad Country Level\nFixed variables: Latin America \u00ad PRSCRISK, AGGLO; Asia \u00ad ULC, DUTY.\nRegressions include the fixed variables plus one of those listed below (variables of interest) and three\nof the pool of remaining variables at a time. Bounds are derived from non-standardized coefficients.\nVariable Upper bound Lower bound Variable Upper bound Lower bound\n denotes robust variable as defined by the Extreme Bounds Analysis (in addition to the fixed variables listed above)\nRegarding country risk, the outcome of the estimations for Asia paints a similar picture to the\nLatin American case (see the following table):\n98 In fact, in the \"first round\" only PRSCRISK is found to be robust, while AGGLO (upper bound: 0.0525, lower\nbound: -0.0069 with PRSCRISK as the free variable) is the variable clearly \"next in line\" in terms of consistency.\nAGGLO is nonetheless a robust variable since an EBA using PRSCRISK and DUTY as fixed variables to bring\nabout a critical mass of regressors now yields two positive bounds for AGGLO (upper: 0.0486, lower: 0.0021).\nTable 3: ASIA; Country Level\nFGLS estimation, with individual country effects, heteroskedastic with cross-sectional correlation\nDependent variable: FDIGDP; number of observations: 80\nNote: z-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\nAgain, both risk measures are significantly positive, with EMCRISK in this case being\nmarginally more significant but likewise worsening the fit of the regression slightly.\nHowever, PRSCRISK is not a truly robust variable (minor violation of EBA, see table 2) and is\nthus omitted from the parsimonious regression in (8). The question as to what accounts for the\nnon-robustness is answered by testing for the other risk sub-components. Even though, at\nfirst glance, PRSERISK is (with \u00df = 0.2936 and z = 4.70) as significant as in the Latin American\nis, strictly speaking, non-robust. Headline political risk is again insignificant (PRSPRISK: \u00df =\n0.0059, z = 0.98) while its sub-component PRSADMIN carries the expected positive sign (\u00df =\n0.0009). Lastly, aspects of political stability cannot be shown to play a major role in the Asian\nAnother important finding is that for Asia the signs of the coefficients for ULC and DUTY are\nreversed in comparison to Latin America, as both are significantly (robustly) negative. These\nresults are clearly in line with the efficiency-seeking hypothesis as FDI in the Asian emerging\nmarkets was indeed driven by low costs and open borders to trade (OPEN significant and\ncorrectly signed in (7)). This interpretation is backed by the strong results for CFLOW, implying\nthat the availability of low-cost financing does matter for investments in emerging Asia.\nInterestingly, AGGLO carries an unexpected negative sign. Evidence from the data series\nsuggests that German multinationals tended to exhibit a counter-cyclical investment behavior.\nIn some country cases they were the front-runners, well ahead of investments by the rest of\nthe world. In others, they apparently \"missed the boat\", gaining access to markets much later\nthan the average foreign investor. Finally, German companies reacted to the Asian crisis in a\nmuch more volatile manner than did other investors. At any rate, the agglomeration variable is\nnot robust against the inclusion of other variables in the Asian case. The positive coefficient\nof DEBT should not come as a surprise considering the arguments put forward in section 2.2.1,\nbecause foreign debt ratios were lower on average and thus less critical than in Latin America.\nSpecification tests for the imposed restrictions \u00ad individual country effects, heteroskedastic\nerror terms, cross-sectional correlation and within-group autocorrelation \u00ad were run one by\none, with each additional restriction being compared to the one marginally less restrictive\n(e.g. merely heteroskedastic error terms). The statistics of the likelihood ratio test (see section\n3.1 for derivation) of no individual country effects, solely homoskedastic error terms and no\ncross-sectional correlation consistently exceeded the critical values for the 2-distribution,\nthus rejecting the null hypotheses. However, the hypothesis of no autocorrelation could not be\nrejected, corresponding to the result that  was generally less than 0.10.\nTo check whether regional country sample ought to be estimated separately, a t-test is applied\nto the sub-samples of Latin America (superscript: 1) and Asia (superscript: 2) , see equation (VIII)\nbelow.

The clearly insignificant t-ratios for the three remaining variables are\ndue to non-robustness of the variables themselves in both regional cases (GDPCAP, DEBT,\nRERVOL) and should be disregarded accordingly.\nMaking use of the firm-level data available in the Bundesbank FDI stock statistics, the above\ncountry-level regressions are re-estimated for the manufacturing sector and several of its sub-\nindustries to check for the influence of sectoral GDP per capita, and sectoral labor costs, and\nin the case of sub-sectors, the relationship between capital intensity and political risk. While it\nwould have been interesting to investigate other sectors of the economy such as agriculture or\nservices, data on labor costs in those sectors are available only for some sample countries.\nInevitably, econometric work on individual emerging market industries suffers from scarcity\nof comparable sectoral data. Apart from the unit labor costs already utilized in the previous\nregressions, manufacturing GDP abroad and sector-specific cash flows of investing German\nmanufacturers are the only readily accessible data at the industry level. As there was no\ncompelling reason to exclude individual country-level factors, the whole set of remaining\n\"global\" variables was included to control for economy-wide effects. Again, an Extreme\nBounds Analysis was performed to identify robust variables (see table 5).\nTable 5: Extreme Bounds Analysis \u00ad Manufacturing\nFixed variables: Latin America \u00ad GDPCAP, PRSCRISK; Asia \u00ad GDPCAP, AGGLO.\nRegressions include the fixed variables plus one of those listed below (variables of interest) and three\nof the pool of remaining variables at a time. Bounds are derived from non-standardized coefficients.\nVariable Upper bound Lower bound Variable Upper bound Lower bound\n denotes robust variable as defined by the Extreme Bounds Analysis (in addition to the fixed variables listed above)\nBy and large, the estimation results for the whole manufacturing sector (see table 6) do not\ndiffer greatly from those found at the country level. Again, the PRS country risk variable\nturns out to be robustly positive for the Latin American sub-sample, being joined in this\nrespect by GDPCAP (significantly negative), while AGGLO and DUTY lose their previous\nsignificance. For Asia, all variables found robust at the country level as well as AGGLO and\nGDPCAP pass the robustness check for the manufacturing sector. Interestingly, while PRSCRISK\nand RERVOL now display a negative sign for that region, GDPCAP becomes highly significantly\npositive, carrying by far the greatest weight in the regressions. The joint significance of unit\nlabor costs and per-capita GDP indicates that while \"cheap labor\" is an important determinant\nof FDI flows from Germany, the Asian manufacturing market is an attractive location for\nGerman investors in its own right.\nSpecification tests yielded results comparable to those at the country level, except for the one\non autocorrelation in the Latin American sample. For regressions (9) and (10), the hypothesis\nof no autocorrelation in the residuals was rejected \u00ad a logical result given a common AR(1)\ncoefficient of  = -0.201. Accordingly, the estimations for the Latin American sample include\nthe aforementioned adjustment mechanism to incorporate first-order autocorrelation.\nTable 6: LATIN AMERICA / ASIA: Manufacturing\nFGLS estimation, with individual country effects, heteroskedastic with cross-sectional correlation\nDependent variable: FDISEC; number of observations: 60 / 80\nNote: z-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\n4.2.2. Sub-Sectors in Manufacturing\nIt has been argued that capital-intensive industries \u00ad measured by fixed investment per\nemployee \u00ad are more sensitive to shifts in political risks because of considerable plant-\nspecific sunk costs. Agarwal et al. (1991, p. 85) contend that \"the risk of selective\nexpropriation is related to the technological diversity of FDI that renders industry-specific\nfactors important for the expropriation decision.\" Lehmann (1999, p. 20), studying the capital\nexpenditures of U.S. affiliates in the chemical and electronics sectors of lower-income\ncountries, finds that the coefficient of political risk is larger for the relatively capital-intensive\nchemical industry. This finding along with other evidence100 appears to be consistent with the\nreal option theory that stipulates the negative influence of an restrictive investment regime on\ninvestment decisions of foreign investors. According to Lehmann's model, investors face an\nincentive to delay an investment abroad the greater the taxes on local production and the\nhigher the probability of a reversal of initial investment liberalization. Therefore, a credible\n100 Among studies of sectoral FDI flows, Froot and Stein (1991) find negative correlations between FDI inflows\nto 13 US separate industries and the real value of the US dollar. The result for the (capital-intensive) chemical\nindustry turns out to be the strongest within the manufacturing sector.\npolicy with regard to maintaining a favorable investment environment is needed to stimulate\nfirm owners to go ahead with sizable capital expenditures. Viewed from this angle, it is clear\nthat political risk will exert a negative stimulus to investment in cases of large entry costs in\nterms of outlays for plant construction.101 On the other hand, so-called footloose industries\nsuch as electronics with comparatively low set-up costs and, correspondingly, high locational\nflexibility will favor a cost-efficient production environment, i.e. good infrastructure and low\nlabor costs. In turn, as such investment is vertical in nature and re-export of assembled\nproducts is intended, host country market size or purchasing power should be of secondary\nGerman firm-level investment data confirm Lehmann's observation of sizable differences in\ncapital endowment per worker, as can be inferred from the following table:\nTable 7: Capital Intensity of German Manufacturing Industries in the Sample Countries\nRegion Industry Average fixed assets per worker\n(thousands of DM)\nThus, the chemical sector is compared to each of the other two industries in terms of the\nsignificance of the appropriate political risk variable. Here, PRSADMIN is selected because it\ndepicts the occurrence of unfavorable action by the host country's authorities to the\nimmediate detriment of investors. Worsening scores should act as a deterrent to FDI flows of\ncapital-intensive industries. Along the lines of the above sector estimations, regressions are\nrun for the three sub-sectors listed above, using as controls the same country-level exogenous\nvariables with the exception of sub-sector cash flows and wages. Unit labor costs had to be\nreplaced by real wages as information on sub-sector productivity was not available.104\n103 Including the sub-sector \"Manufacturing of equipment for the production and distribution of electricity\".\n104 This certainly represents a limitation, and at first glance this bias seems to enter into the results of the sub-\nsector regressions for Latin America with RWAGE being significantly positive in each case (see table 8).\nHowever, tentative regressions for Latin America (not shown here) incorporating real wages adjusted for overall\ngrowth of value added in manufacturing (i.e. not differentiated by sub-sector, which also adds a certain bias) did\nnot reveal major differences to the regressions reported in table 8: the coefficients of RWAGE for CHE and MAE\nThe regression results in tables 8 and 9 confirm the hypothesis that investors in capital-\nintensive industries react more decisively to variations in the investment climate than do those\nin the more labor-intensive information/communication technology (ICT) sector. In both\nregions, the regression coefficients on administrative risk confirm the postulated differences\nbetween chemical and the other two sectors, perhaps with the seeming exception of ICT in\nLatin America for which the coefficient is significant at the 5 % level. Still, the hypothesis\nholds as the standardized beta coefficient for the chemical sector is twice as high as the one\nfor ICT, apart from the slight difference in significance levels. The results for MAE\nconsistently conform to the hypothesis with the outcome being insignificant in both cases. No\nclear pattern emerges for the other control variables which may owe something to the\npossibility that country-level variables may not pick up characteristics of the sub-sectors.\nTable 8: Sub-Sector Level \u00ad LATIN AMERICA\nFGLS estimation, with individual country effects, heteroskedastic with cross-sectional correlation\nDependent variable: FDISUBSEC; number of observations: 60\nNote: z-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\nkept their positive significance levels, and only the coefficient for ICT, while remaining positive, turned\ninsignificant.\n105 As in regressions (9) and (10), the hypothesis of no autocorrelation in the residuals was rejected ( = -0.384).\nHence, the estimation for MAE in the Latin American sample countries again includes adjustment for first-order\nautocorrelation.\nTable 9: Sub-Sector Level \u00ad ASIA\nFGLS estimation, with individual country effects, heteroskedastic with cross-sectional correlation\nDependent variable: FDISUBSEC; number of observations: 50/60 (see below)\nSample countries India, Korea, Malaysia,\nPhilippines, Thailand\nIndia, Korea, Malaysia,\nPhilippines, Singapore,\nThailand\nIndia, Korea, Malaysia,\nPhilippines, Singapore\nNote: z-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\n5. Conclusion\nThe contribution of this study to the FDI literature lies in an innovative definition of an\ninvestment flow variable and in the affirmation that the issue of country risk does matter in\nthe case of German FDI flows to Latin American and Asian emerging markets in the 1990s.\nAs to the former, the endeavor to virtuously combine fully-consolidated FDI data from the\nBundesbank stock statistics with the evident merits of considering flow data has yielded a\nquasi-flow variable embodying first differences of annual direct investment stocks corrected\nfor effective participation rates, previously included balance-sheet depreciation and\nsubsequently repatriated profits. Put plainly, this new variable seeks to emulate overall FDI\nflows \u00ad unavailable from the balance of payments \u00ad at near-market prices and pursuant to the\nIMF's directional principle as well as the comprehensive OECD benchmark definition of\nforeign direct investment.\nRegarding empirical results, the regression outcome for the size-adjusted FDI flow variable\nconfirms the widely-held hypothesis that a high degree of economic and political risk is\ndetrimental to cross-border equity participation. Aiming to put this verdict on a broader\nfoundation, the study uses two professional country risk indices, both of which turn out to be\nhighly significant for the Latin American and Asian sub-samples. This finding thus confirms\nthe presumption that international investors indeed perceive impending changes in the\nmacroeconomic and regulatory environment. Subdividing country risk into its components, it\nis found that economic risk represents the main driving force behind this unequivocal result,\nwhereas the evidence for headline political risk is best described as erratic owing to its\ndisparate individual elements. While, for both regions, the measure of administrative quality\nalias corruption and malfeasance by the host government is consistently strongly associated\nwith marginal FDI inflows, the variable of host country political stability turns out\ninsignificant or even displays a negative sign. Investors' dislike of unwarranted government\nbehavior, inter alia excessive payment of bribes, restrictions on intra-company transfers or\noutright expropriation, is especially pronounced in the Asian sample countries, with the\nadministrative risk variable being robust against the inclusion of other controls.\nWith respect to these control variables, the regression results differ markedly between the two\nregions. In Latin America, FDI inflows throughout the last decade are to be called \"market-\nseeking\" in that German firms were apparently impelled to establish a presence abroad by the\nnecessity to overcome critical host country tariff barriers and, in a sense, to react in a timely\nmanner to rising direct investment on the part of foreign competitors. By contrast, German\nmultinationals accessing the Asian markets seemed to have been in search of low labor and\nfinancing costs as well as an open trade regime since their direct investment is clearly vertical\nin nature. These differences cause a test on identity of coefficients between regions to be\nrejected, implying that factors determining FDI flows have differed between Latin America\nand Asia. Hence, as far as Germany is concerned, there does not seem to be a unique pattern\nof foreign direct investment across regions of emerging market economies. Incidentally, real\nexchange rate volatility apparently propelled German FDI in Asia, and, in fact, in none of the\ncountry-level regressions does this measure end up being significantly negative. These\nfindings tend to strengthen the hypothesized positive impact of exchange rate fluctuations on\nthe willingness of investors to establish production facilities abroad.\nIn addition, the availability of firm-level data allows for sectoral and sub-sectoral analysis.\nFDI flows to manufacturing sectors abroad generally mimic the characteristics of those at the\ncountry level with the main exception of GDP per capita being negatively related to inflows\nto Latin America and strongly positively related to those to Asia. Moreover, the measure of\ntrade barriers loses its significance in the Latin American sample, while for the Asian\ncountries the agglomeration variable now also passes the robustness test. Lastly, the\nhypothesis that capital-intensive industries react more strongly to deteriorating investment\nconditions is confirmed by German data, as the administrative political risk variable carries\nstrongly positive coefficients in the regressions for the capital-intensive chemical sector in\nboth regions while those for the labor-centered information/communication technology\nindustry are found to be insignificant each time.\nIn sum, researchers studying foreign direct investment in emerging market economies ought\nto take increased account of non-traditional variables such as country risk or agglomeration\neffects. The econometric results of this study affirm that the discernible trend towards\nfactoring in measures of the regulatory environment facing foreign investors is clearly called\nfor. As \"soft\" locational factors become more material in the eyes of investors, analyses\nincorporating qualitative assessments of host countries are likely to gain further prominence\nin FDI research.\nAppendix\nTable 10: Absolute FDI-Flows, LATIN AMERICA/ASIA; Country Level\nFGLS estimation, with individual country effects, heteroskedastic with cross-sectional correlation\nDependent variable: FDIFLOW; number of observations = 60 (Latin America), 80 (Asia)\nNote: z-values in parentheses; ***=significant at the 1% level, **=significant at the 5% level, *=significant at the 10% level\nFigure 6: An Example of the Extreme Bounds Analysis\n|---------y--------| z |------------------xj\n-----------------|\n(check: is \u00df3\nhigher (lower) than the upper (lower) extreme bound so far?
