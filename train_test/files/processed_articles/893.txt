To identify the proportion of community-dwelling elderly persons (70+) who could affect their eligibility for\nMedicaidfinancingof a nursing home stay through the use of a trust and to quantify the prevalence and predictors of trusts.\nMethods. State-specific Medicaid eligibility regulations were used to determine eligibility and to identify those who could\naffect the same through the use of trusts. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify correlates of having a trust. Wave\n1 of the Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD) data base was used.\nResults. Four in 10 elderly community dwellers could potentially qualify for Medicaid by using a trust; however, less than\n10% had a trust. On average, wealthier persons had trusts. Avoidance of probate and controlling assets after death appear to be\nstronger motivations for trust creation among the elderly than achieving Medicaid spend down.\nDiscussion. The use of trusts was not common, and motives other than spend down were more important for those with\ntrusts. Our results suggest little need for policy efforts to limit the use of trusts to achieve spend down.\nMOST nursing home cost is bome in equal proportions by\nthe individual or family (private-pay), or by Medicaid\nafter an individual has become very poor (Murtaugh, Kemper,\nlong-term care insurance covers just 2% to 3% of all nursing\nhome expenditures in the United States, whereas Medicare fi-\nnances 6% to 7% of the total (Murtaugh et al., 1997). This mix\nof self-pay and public financing has led to concerns about equity\nand quality among some but has been deemed \"almost optimal\nMedicaid requires elderly persons to deplete virtually all\nnonhousing wealth before financing nursing home care. The\nconventional wisdom is that persons enter a nursing home as a\nprivate-pay resident, spend virtually all of their nonhousing as-\nsets on such care, and then qualify for Medicaid, a process\ncalled spend down. However, empirical evidence indicates that\nthis occurs less frequently than is often alleged (Norton, 1995;\nAlternatively, elderly persons may take several actions to\nqualify for Medicaid without first spending their assets on nurs-\ning home care. Such actions include transferring assets to chil-\ndren and creating trusts to shelter assets in order to qualify for\nMedicaid-financed nursing home care (Barreira, 1989; Bickel,\ntrary to the Medicaid program's intent--to provide a safety net\nfor the needy. Thus, Medicaid financing of nursing home care\nmay create a moral hazard problem.\nRecent public policy efforts, such as the Omnibus Budget\nReconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, the Kennedy-Kassebaum\nthe use of trusts for this purpose more difficult, and potentially\nKlein, 1997). These steps were motivated by the belief that such\nactions to qualify for Medicaid, particularly the use of trusts,\nwere common (e.g., Landsman & Klein, 1997). However, the\nfrequency with which trusts are used to achieve spend down is\nunknown. This study: (a) estimates the proportion of the com-\nmunity-dwelling elderly who could alter their Medicaid eligi-\nbility through the use of a trust, (b) quantifies the prevalence of\ntrusts among the elderly, and (c) tests for the strength of several\ncompeting motivations for trust creation.\nMotivationsfor Creating Trusts\nA trust is a device that transfers legal title of one's property\nto another person (or to oneself) as trustee to hold for the bene-\nfit of a beneficiary (Orman, 1997). From our review of both the\nacademic and nonacademic literature (American Association of\nRothberg, 1993), there are four primary motivations for the el-\nderly to create a trust: (i) to spend down to Medicaid; (ii) to\nminimize inheritance tax; (iii) to avoid probate, either for cost\nor privacy concerns; and (iv) to control the distribution of assets\nupon death or disability.\nMedicaid.--Assets placed in certain trusts are not counted\nagainst an individual for the purpose of qualifying for Medicaid\n1993). A trust must have four features to allow it to provide\nasset protection from Medicaid (Table 1).\nIn short, the trust must be irrevocable and the trustor must\npermanently relinquish access to be principal in the trust,\nalthough he or she may receive income from it.\nTax reduction.--Reduction of inheritance taxes is another\nmotive for trust creation. Until 1997, federal inheritance tax law\nexempted the first $600,000 of an estate from inheritance tax;\nAttribute\nTable 1. Attributes of Medicaid Qualifying Trusts\nEffect on Spend Down\nIrrevocable or Revocable\nCreation and Funding of Trust\nTrustee\nDistribution ofAssets\nIrrevocable means the terms cannot be\nchanged and the trustor loses complete con-\ntrol over the principal forever. A revocable\ntrust can be changed at any time and provides\nno spend down benefit. Being irrevocable is a\nnecessary, although not sufficient, condition\nfor Medicaid spend down protection.\nTo achieve spend down protection, assets\nmust be placed in a trust well before the ap-\nplication for Medicaid. The Omnibus\nReconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993 estab-\nlished a federal requirement of a 60-month\n\"look back\" period between the creation of a\ntrust and application for Medicaid. A trust\nthat is created and funded at death, or created\nbefore death but not funded until death is not\nMedicaid qualifying.\nTo achieve spend down protection, the trustee\nmay be neither the trustor nor their spouse;\nloss of control over the principal by the\ntrustor must be complete. A trust may be\nstructured with the trustor or spouse also\nserving as trustee. This provides no spend\ndown benefit but can provide tax and other\nbenefits.\nA trust may provide income to the trustor dur-\ning his or her lifetime as stipulated in the cre-\nation of the trust. However, the trustor may\nnot have access to the principal contained in\nthe trust for it to be Medicaid qualifying.\nNotes: Trustor is the person relinquishing control of assets and setting up the\ntrust. Trustee is the person who owns and controls the assets and administers\nthem as stipulated in creation of the trust. Beneficiary is the person for whom\nthe trust is designed to benefit.\nthe marginal tax rate ranged from 37% to 60% for estates\nvalued at $20 million and over (Espereti, et al., 1996). Thirty-\nfour states have no inheritance tax, and those that do vary in\nboth marginal rates and size of estate that is exempt from tax,\neach of which typically varies according to whom is inheriting\nassets (children, sibling, nonfamily member; Advisory Com-\nOstberg, 1990). Trusts can double the federal and state exemp-\ntions for inheritance taxes (Orman, 1997).\nAvoiding probate.--Reasons for avoiding probate include\ncost to the estate, delays in clearing probate, and public access\ncost of probate varies among states, from a low of approxi-\nmonths in several states to 1.5 years in Indiana to complete the\nDirect expenditure.--A final competing motivation for trust\ncreation is the desire to control expenditure of one's assets. Trusts\nare often used to bequeath wealth unequally to children, to give\nto charitable organizations, and to control spending in the event\nthe person becomes disabled or is unable to make decisions\n(Espereti, et al., 1996). A trust can remain in force after death.\nMETHODS\nApproach.--This study tested for Medicaid moral hazard by\nestimating whether being able to qualify for Medicaid was an\nimportant reason for creating a trust in a national community-\ndwelling sample of elderly persons, while controlling for other\nmotivations. If policymakers' concern that Medicaid moral haz-\nard induces elderly persons to create trusts is correct, then we\nexpect to find that individual characteristics related to needing\nnursing home care would be positively correlated with having a\ntrust.\nFirst, we estimated the number of elderly persons living in\nthe community who would potentially benefit from creating a\nMedicaid-qualifying trust. Next, we estimated a model to test\nthe competing motives for trust creation on the probability of\nhaving a trust. Finally, to place our investigation of trusts in\ncontext of other spend down mechanisms, we identified those\nelderly persons who achieved Medicaid eligibility by giving as-\nsets directly to children, over a 2-year period.\nData.--We used the Asset and Health Dynamics of the\nOldest Old (AHEAD) database, Wave 1. AHEAD was designed\nfor research on changes in assets and wealth, and their interrela-\ntionship with health among the elderly population after their\nmain working years have ended (Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, &\nWallace, 1997). AHEAD has a panel design with respondents\nbetween the ages of 70 and 90 years. Data collection for Wave 1\nthousand two hundred twenty-four respondents, 2,560 of whom\nwere over 85 years of age, were included in Wave 1. Blacks,\nHispanics, and residents of the state of Florida were oversam-\npled.\nOur multivariate analysis was conducted at the household level.\nthe full battery of questions. There were 2,072 couple households\nson for missing values was the lack of a state identifier for house-\nholds, which prevented us from assessing Medicaid eligibility and\nseveral other state-specific covariates. We compared those house-\nholds missing state identifiers with those having them. They were\nsimilar on basic demographic variables. We presented our data at\nand 3,617 single households) to illustrate the distribution of total\nrespondents according to Medicaid spend down status (Figure 1).\nWe analyzed the existence of a trust for couples and singles\nseparately. In the case of couples, characteristics of both the\nmale and female members of the household were included as\nexplanatory variables.\nDependent variable.--The dependent variable was having a\ntrust in Wave 1, as reported by the primary respondent of a\nhousehold, whether a single or a couple.\nEmpirical specification.--We included explanatory variables\nfor the four motivations for establishing trusts, demographic\ncharacteristics of respondents, and household wealth.\nResp. in States\nwith Income Test\nAHEAD\nResp. in States\nwithout Income\nBelow limit,\napply asset test\ny\n-\n--\n^\nUp to 5 years to spend down\nGreater than 5 years to spend\ndown @ avg.

Medicaid spend down status for community-dwelling elderly persons, Wave 1 AHEAD (7,761 individuals; 2,072 couples; 3,617 singles).\nTo measure spend down motivation, we included three binary\nvariables that determined potential to use a trust to become\nMedicaid eligible. The first identified those households never el-\nigible based on income, the second those with assets greater\nthan a 5-year stay in a nursing home, and, finally, those for\nwhom spend down would occur in less than 5 years, but who\nwere not eligible for Medicaid at the time of the survey. The ref-\nerence group was eligible households in the community based\non income, assets, and spousal impoverishment provisions at the\ntime of the survey. Only 8% of the elderly entering a nursing\nhome remain longer than 5 years (Murtaugh et al., 1997). We\nprice, inflated to 1994 dollars using the medical Consumer Price\nIndex. Persons never eligible based on income were those with\nincomes above a fixed state income limit, or those with incomes\ngreater than the average nursing home price in states with no in-\ncome limit but that apply medical expenses against income for\npurposes of establishing eligibility for Medicaid.\nPersonal characteristics relating to the probability of needing\nnursing home care were measured separately for both the male\nand female member of a couple. The first was each respon-\ndent's estimate of the probability of needing nursing home care\nwithin 5 years, and the second was the self-assessed probability\nof living for at least 10 years. We included a binary variable\nequal to 1 if a respondent had a missing value for either subjec-\ntive assessment question, because of a substantial number of\nmissing values for these two variables. Among couples, 552\nWe also used number of limitations in activities of daily liv-\ning, measured on a scale from 0 to 6. Cognitive status was a bi-\nnary variable, with 1 when respondents answered 10 or more\nitems of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status correctly.\nFinally, we included a binary variable for self-assessed health\nstatus equal to 1 when respondents reported their health was\n\"good\" to \"excellent\" relative to others their age, with \"fair\"\nand \"poor\" the omitted reference group, a measure shown to\npredict survival (Dasbach, Klein, Klein, & Moss, 1994) and use\nof personal health services (Pope, 1988). However, the effect of\nhealth status on long-term care coverage is ambiguous (Kumar,\nTo measure tax motivations for creating trusts, we included\nvariables for the combined federal and state inheritance tax rate\ngiven respondent net worth and number of children. We con-\ntrolled for number of children since persons with more may\nhave a higher bequest motive and are thus more likely to try to\navoid inheritance taxes.\nTo measure the motive for avoiding probate, we created binary\nvariables for whether a state had stringent lawyer fee regulation\nfor probate, whether a respondent's assets would qualify for an\naffidavit estate transfer in the respondent's state (which generally\ndoes not allow for transfer of a house), and whether a respon-\ndent's assets would qualify for a summary probate procedure.\nThe dollar value for the size of estate qualifying for a summary\nadministrative costs of probate are lower because of summary\nprobate or affidavit transfer, fewer elderly persons should want to\ncreate trusts to circumvent probate. However, to the extent that\nthe state statutes are a binding constraint on lawyers' fees,\nlawyers may push trusts for which there is no fee regulation.\nFor the motive of controlling one's assets, we included bi-\nnary variables for whether the household donated at least $500\nin the past year to charity, whether the will provided for un-\nequal shares of the bequest for children (we used the will of\nmen for couples), and whether the will provided for charity.\nPersons with charitable motives and with wills that benefited\nchildren unequally would be expected to be more likely to have\na trust to control assets.\nWe included demographic characteristics for race (White),\neducation (less than high school), age, and whether the inter-\nview was completed by a proxy. The analysis was run sepa-\nrately for married couples and singles. For singles, a binary\nvariable equal to 1 was included if they were widowed, as was\na control for gender (female =1).\nFinally, we included variables for household net worth other\nthan primary housing wealth, net worth in primary place of res-\nidence, and nonearnings household income in the previous year.\nA binary variable was also included for missing income in the\npast year. We specified wealth in this way because Medicaid\nexcludes housing wealth from the asset screen for eligibility if\nthere is a positive probability that the nursing home resident\nwill return there (see e.g., Budish, 1995).\nEstimation.--Mulitvariate logistic regression was used to es-\ntimate the probability of a household reporting a trust in Wave 1\nAHEAD. Robust estimates of standard errors were obtained\nusing the Huber-White sandwich estimator procedure (STATA\nCorporation, 1997). Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square and ROC\nstatistics were used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the models.\nRESULTS\nApproximately 40% of the respondents could potentially\nalter their Medicaid status by creating a trust (Figure 1). A\nroughly equal proportion were eligible for Medicaid financing\nof a nursing home stay while in the community, and 1 in 5\ncould not alter their Medicaid status through the use of a trust\nbecause their nonearning income was too large.\nported a trust in Wave 1, with 6.3% of single households and\n10.4% of couples reporting a trust. We compared the characteris-\ntics of respondents with and without a trust at Wave 1, for both\nthe single and couple sample (Table 2). Most of the mean values\nwere significantly different. Those with a trust were wealthier,\nfaced a higher combined inheritance tax rate, were more edu-\ncated, were more likely to be White, and were more likely to have\na will that leaves money to a charity and which was designed to\nbenefit children unequally, contingent upon having children.\nAmong couples, male and female values of individualized ex-\nplanatory variables were generally similar, both in terms of mag-\nnitude and statistical significance, when comparing those with and\nwithout a trust. However, in the case of expectations of needing\nnursing home care within 5 years, and of living at least 10 years,\nthis pattern did not hold. Men in couples with a trust were signifi-\ncantly more likely than those without a trust to believe they would\nmove to a nursing home within 5 years, but women did not differ\nin this respect. Women in couples with a trust had a higher expec-\ntation of survival, but there was no difference among men.\nHaving more assets to protect were the strongest predictors\nof having a trust in multivariate models (Table 3).

For singles, both mea-\nsures of wealth and yearly income were significant predictors of\nhaving a trust, with persons with higher wealth being more\nlikely to have a trust. For couples, there was no independent\nwealth effect once the couple's spend down status was assessed.\nWe conducted sensitivity analysis of the way in which income\nand wealth were entered into the model, specifying the variables\nas quartiles. The results for couples were not sensitive to the func-\ntional form of these variables, but among singles, when wealth\nand income were entered as quartiles, the variables representing\ntime to spend down were not statistically significant.\nThere are other ways in which an individual may purposefully\nachieve spend down to Medicaid. Between Waves 1 and 2, a 2-\nyear time interval, 113 respondents achieved Medicaid eligibility\nafter giving a substantial gift (in terms of proportion of their\nwealth) to children. Twelve of these persons reported a subjective\nprobability of needing nursing home care within 5 years of 0.5 or\nbetter. These twelve cases combined potential spend down moti-\nvation with an act that achieved spend down eligibility. Only 1 of\nthe 113 persons gave away assets that were equal to more man a\n5-year stay in a nursing home to achieve spend down.\nDISCUSSION\nWe do not find much evidence that Medicaid spend down is\ncommonly achieved by the use of a trust. Trusts were rare among\ncommunity-dwelling elderly persons--less than one in 10 had\nthem--in spite of several motivations for their creation and a cot-\ntage industry that touts the various benefits of trusts for the elderly\ncomparison, 1 in 100 members of the total sample gave assets to\ntheir children between Waves 1 and 2 that qualified them for\nMedicaid financing of a nursing home stay. Comparison of wealth\ndistributions with the Health and Retirement Study (respondents\n51-61) rule out prior inter vivos transfers before persons reach the\n(roughly 40%) were poor enough to qualify for Medicaid financ-\ning of a nursing home stay while living in the community.\nWhile several of our findings are consistent with the hypoth-\nesized Medicaid spend down motivation, it appears that trust\ncreation is generally most strongly associated with high wealth.\nFor example, our finding that those with assets equal to more\nthan a 5-year nursing home stay are more likely to have a trust\ncould be construed as support for a hypothesis that trusts are\nused by the wealthy to achieve spend down. However, having\nincome which would preclude ever spending down, regardless\nof asset level, was also predictive of having a trust, although\nsuch a trust could never achieve spend down. Finding that level\nof wealth is related to having a trust is in line with other re-\nsearch on a less restricted age group (Wolff, 1994). On balance,\nwe also found evidence supporting trust creation for the pur-\npose of avoiding probate and preserving control of assets after\ndeath.\nSeveral differences between men and women and between cou-\nples and singles provide some evidence regarding trust creation be-\nhavior. Couples in which the man expected to live longer were less\nlikely to have a trust, the opposite effect being true for women.\nThis suggests couples are more likely to plan for the future with a\ntrust when the woman is seen as likely to live relatively long and\nface the prospect of being widowed for a longer time. Men who\nexpect to live longer do not appear to see a need for trust creation,\nsuggesting they believe they will be aroundto\"take care ofthings.\"\nHowever, when the man was more disabled, net of other factors,\nthe couple was more likely to have a trust, possibly anticipating the\nneed for long-term care (theADL limitation variable may be pick-\ning up some of this type of effect for men with missing nursing\nhome expectation information, which was substantial).\nThe decision of singles to create a trust is not affected by\nlongevity expectations, probably showing they do not have to\nworry about widowing a spouse. However, single trust creation\ndoes appear to be related to a person's history of making charita-\nble donations, and of creating a will to benefit children un-\nequally, suggesting past experience with detailed financial/estate\nplanning (having a will specifying unequal bequest to children).\nSingles are also more likely to create a trust given a higher ex-\npectation of moving to a nursing home in the near term. The\nmost likely motive given other findings is that singles are mov-\ning to maximize their estate available, either to children, or to\ncharitable concerns, whereas among couples, the spouse, not the\nchildren, is foremost in motivating estate planning via a trust.\nOur research is subject to several important limitations. First,\nwe analyzed the existence of a trust in a cross-section. In pre-\nliminary analysis, we looked at trust creation and found it to be\nextremely rare between Waves 1 and 2 of AHEAD (a 2-year\nperiod). The next several waves will allow for a more complete\nfollow-up to identify those respondents that ultimately enter\nnursing homes, allowing for a link between estate planning ac-\ntivities, family structure, perceptions of need, and actual behav-\nior. Second, all trusts do not achieve Medicaid spend down pro-\ntection. The AHEAD data in Wave 1 did not ascertain whether\na trust was irrevocable, a necessary but not sufficient condition\nfor spend down protection. In Wave 2, such information was\nascertained, but preliminary attempts to link Waves 1 and 2 to\ninfer the type of trust present in Wave 1 proved to be too inac-\ncurate. Further, the proportion of trusts in Wave 2 that were ir-\nrevocable was so small as to make multivariate analysis im-\npractical, as well as to suggest that virtually no one had a trust\nthat could achieve spend down. Third, it is possible that elderly\npersons who have created trusts for the purpose of achieving\nspend down protection may be understandably unwilling to\nadmit this. However, the question regarding existence of a trust\nwas not asked in the context of Medicaid estate planning, less-\nening the risk of purposeful nonreporting.\nThe study sample consisted of elderly persons 70 years of age\nand older who lived in the community. A community sample is\nbest to investigate trust creation to spend down because a nurs-\ning home-based sample would not be able to observe the for-\nward-thinking actions necessary for an elderly person to qualify\nthemselves for Medicaid. Even before the provisions of OBRA\n1993 took effect (which expanded the look back for trusts to 60\nmonths), the vast majority of the group most likely to benefit\nfrom the use of trusts to spend down did not have one.\nOur results suggest that there is limited rationale for further\npublic policy efforts designed to limit the use of trusts to\nachieve spend down, because such behavior is rare. However,\nthe baby boom generation has accumulated large amounts of\nwealth over the past three decades, particularly in relatively liq-\nuid forms of retirement savings, such as 40IK or 403B ac-\ncounts, as opposed to nonbequeathable pensions. This means\nthat the potential motivation of sheltering such assets from use\nto pay nursing home costs may increase. Monitoring future use\nof trusts for purposeful spend down may be necessary to ensure\nthat the purpose of the Medicaid program, to provide a safety\nnet for the poor, is not circumvented.\n"
