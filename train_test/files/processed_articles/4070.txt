    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The results of segmental venous resection (VR) combined with pancreatoduode-\nnectomy (PD) are controversial but may be promising. Few studies have described reconstruction\nof the portal/superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV) with the iliac vein harvested from donation after\ncardiac death (DCD).\nMethods: From January 2014 to April 2016, PD combined with segmental excision of the PV/SMV\n(VR group) was performed in 21 patients with adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas\n(ADHP). The authors established a new technique of venous reconstruction using the iliac vein\nfrom DCD and analysed patients' long-term survival.\nResults: The tumour dimensions and tumour staging were greater and the operation time was\nlonger in the VR than PD group; however, no differences in the resection degree, blood loss,\ncomplications, reoperation rate, or mortality rate were found. The median survival was similar\nbetween the VR and PD groups. The long-term patency of the donor iliac vein was 90%. The\ndegree of resection was a strong predictor of long-term survival.\nConclusion: Segmental PV/SMV resection combined with PD is applicable to selective patients\nwith venous invasion by ADHP if R0 resection has probably been achieved. An iliac vein obtained by\nDCD provides an effective graft for venous reconstruction.\n",

On the basis of this\nprevious work, the current study was per-\nformed to evaluate the safety and long-term\nresults of excision of the PV/SMV combined\nwith PD and identify the potential factors\ninfluencing survival.\nMaterials and methods\nEthics statement\nThe need for the iliac vein as a homograft was\nregistered in the China Organ Transplant\nResponse System and then harvested by\nDCD by the assigned coordinator of this\nsystem. This study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of Chaoyang Hospital Affiliated to\nCapital Medical University. After obtaining a\nfull understanding of the details of the vascu-\nlar allografts, all patients provided written\ninformed consent to undergo the operation.\nPatients\nwho underwent PD for treatment of ADHP\nwere reviewed in the Hepatobiliary and\nPancreatic Department of Chaoyang\nHospital. The enrolled patients were divided\ninto two groups: the PD group and the VR\ncombined with PD group (VR group). In the\nPD group, PD was performed without\nvenous reconstruction. In the VR group,\nvenous graft interposition following seg-\nmental resection of the PV/SMV was per-\nformed in combination with PD. The three\nexclusion criteria were as follows. First,\narterial invasion is associated with a lower\nsurvival rate and higher perioperative mor-\ntality rate; therefore, arterial invasion was\nregarded as unrespectable, and such patients\nwere excluded.9 Second, patients who had\nreceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy were\nexcluded. Finally, patients who underwent\nother venous reconstruction techniques such\nas direct suturing, end-to-end anastomosis, or\npatch repair were excluded. The demographic\ndata, perioperative details, pathologic find-\nings, and survival data were collected from\nour database. Enhanced computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) or three-dimensional vascular\nreconstruction was performed to determine\nthe local status of the PV/SMV and tumour\nbefore the operation. Survival was evaluated\nfrom the date of postoperation to death or the\nend of the follow-up period.\nSurgical management\nEn bloc PD was performed in both groups.\nDissection of the retropancreatic lymph\nnodes and skeletonization of the hepato-\nduodenal ligament were routine procedures.\nChild's type digestive tract reconstruction\nwas performed. The anastomotic pancrea-\ntojejunostomy techniques in the two groups\nincluded the placement of running sutures\nfrom the pancreatic parenchyma to jejunal\nserosa, the placement of sutures from the\nduct of Wirsung to the jejunal mucosa,\nand stenting of the main pancreatic duct.\nA >1-mm negative resection margin,\n<1-mm negative resection margin, and the\nmacroscopic presence of a residual tumour\nwere considered R0, R1, and R2 resection,\nrespectively.\nVenous reconstruction\nThe iliac vein was harvested by DCD and\npreserved at \u00c080C in accordance with the\nexisting standards in the authors' hospital.10\nThe duration of cryopreservation did not\nexceed 6 months. On the day of surgery, the\ncryopreserved donor iliac vein was\nimmerged in saline at 37C. After thawing\nfor 5 minutes, the iliac vein was rinsed and\nplaced in lactated Ringer's solution at 4C\nfor subsequent use.\nAfter segmental excision of the PV/SMV\ntogether with the specimen, frozen\npathologic examination of the ends of the\nresected vein was performed to ensure that\nthe venous extremities were cancer-free.\nThe patients in the VR group were clas-\nsified into two types based on the sites of\nPV/SMV invasion. In type I, the preopera-\ntive enhanced CT images showed that the\npancreatic tumour had invaded the lumen of\nthe SMV and that the splenic vein (SV) was\nintact. Intraoperatively, after cutting off\nthe pancreas, we confirmed invasion of the\nSMV and clamped this vein. The tumour\ncombined with the SMV was removed, and\nend-to-end anastomosis of the internal or\nexternal iliac vein (harvested by DCD) to the\nSMV was performed (Figure 1). In type II,\ninvasion of the pancreatic malignancy to the\njunction of the SMV and SV was suspected\non the preoperative CT angiography images\nand then verified by surgical exploration.\nThus, occlusion of the PV, SV, and SMV\nwas performed simultaneously, and the\ntumour was resected together with the\ninvaded segmental vessels. Finally, the allo-\ngraft was pruned into three branches, and\nthe common iliac vein, external iliac vein,\nand internal iliac vein were connected to the\nrecipient PV, SMV, and SV, respectively\n(Figure 2). Both the anterior and posterior\nwalls of the recipient's PV/SMV were ana-\nstomosed to appropriately interposition the\niliac vein with running 6-0 polypropylene\nsutures. Approximately 100 ml of static\nblood was exsanguinated to prevent aero-\nembolism and acidosis before the last suture\nwas placed.\nAnticoagulation strategy\nLow-molecular-weight heparin (0.3 ml,\n2850IU anti-Xa activity) was subcutaneously\ninjected twice a day during the first week after\nsurgery for anticoagulation treatment. This\ndrug was then changed to oral enteric-coated\naspirin tablets (100mg) once a day for up to\n6 months postoperatively. Ultrasonography\non day 3 postoperatively and enhanced CT\non day 7 postoperatively were applied to\nevaluate the patency of the homograft.\nStatistical analysis\nAn independent-samples t-test and a chi-\nsquare test were used to compare the\ncontinuous and categorical variables,\nrespectively, of the two groups. The log-\nrank test based on the Kaplan\u00adMeier curve\nwas applied to evaluate survival in the two\ngroups. Multivariate Cox regression ana-\nlysis was performed to identify factors\nimpacting survival. A P value of 0.05 was\nFigure 2.

SPSS ver-\nsion 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used\nto perform the data analysis.\nResults\nIn total, 106 patients were enrolled in this\nretrospective study (21 in the VR group, 85\nin the PD group). The overall survival\nduration was 20.8 months during the aver-\nage follow-up period of 18.2 months. The\nclinical, laboratory, and pathologic results\nare summarized in Table 1. The tumour\ndimensions were significantly greater and\nthe rate of regional lymph node metastasis\nwas significantly lower in the VR than PD\nstage was significantly more severe in the VR\nthan PD group (P \u00bc 0.01). The duration of\nthe operation was significantly prolonged\ndue to VR and venous reconstruction (510\ncant differences were found between the VR\nand PD groups in terms of blood loss (938\nreoperation (14% vs. 7%), or mortality (5%\nvs. 2%). Pancreatic fistula (PF) was the most\ncommon and serious complication in the\ncurrent study. PF was diagnosed in seven\npatients of the PD group and in three\npatients of the VR group following the\nInternational Study Group of Pancreatic\nFistula criteria.11 In the PD group, four\npatients with a grade C PF developed a\nsubsequent abdominal infection that\nresulted in intra-abdominal bleeding in\nthree patients. Similarly, two patients in\nthe VR group underwent an emergent\nreoperation because of infection caused by\na grade C PF. Delayed gastric emptying,\nmild abdominal infection, and grade A and\nB PFs prolonged the hospitalization dur-\nation without inducing serious consequences\nin the two groups. The overall R0 resection\ndegree of resection, especially the R0\nresection rate, was similar between the two\ngroups. According to the Kaplan\u00adMeier\ncurve (Figure 3), there was no significant\ndifference between the VR and PD groups in\nthe median survival time (15 vs. 19 months,\nrespectively). In the Cox regression model,\nthe degree of resection was the only pre-\ndictor of long-term survival (P \u00bc 0.004)\n(Table 2). There were fewer risks following\nR2 resection.\nIn the VR group, type I and II venous\nand 7 (33.3%) patients, respectively. No\nanastomotic bleeding or stenosis occurred in\nassociation with type I or II venous recon-\nstruction as indicated by enhanced CT in the\nearly postoperative period. By the end of\nfollow-up period, the graft patency rate was\nhospitalized for transient ascites following\ntype I venous reconstruction and subse-\nquently diagnosed with SMV thrombosis\nby CT angiography at 6 and 8 months after\nsurgery, respectively. Because of the devel-\nopment of collateral circulation, these\npatients survived without serious complica-\ntions. In addition, no patients in the VR\ngroup showed symptoms of infection or\nrejection caused by the allograft vein\nduring the follow-up period.\nDiscussion\nVenous resection combined with PD pro-\nvides a radical treatment opportunity for\npatients with borderline resectable ADHP;\nhowever, its outcomes remain controver-\nsial.12 Although this technique has been\nshown to be safe and feasible without\nincreasing the postoperative mortality and\nand long-term survival following VR are\nundesirable.15 Osamu et al.16 reported that\nbilateral and >1.2-cm invasion of the PV/\nSMV by a pancreatic tumour was associated\nwith a very poor prognosis. In contrast,\nKure et al.17 showed that even in patients\nwith PV involvement, >5-year survival\ncould be achieved if complete tumour extir-\npation (R0 resection) was achieved by PV\nresection. Perhaps PV/SMV involvement\nis not correlated with tumour invasion and\na poor prognosis but can be regarded as\nfunctional adjacency.18 In the present study,\ntumour invasion of the PV/SMV was histo-\npatients in the VR group. There were some\ndifferences in venous involvement between\nthe imaging and histological examination\nresults. Consequently, Reddy and Hoffman19\nquestioned whether venous involvement\nshould be included in the category ``border-\nline resectable disease.'' Similar to a previ-\nous study,20 the median survival time in\npatients of the VR group in the present\nstudy was not significantly lower than that\nin patients of the PD group. Several studies\nhave found that the long-term survival was\nsimilar between patients who underwent\nPV/SMV resection combined with PD and\nR0 resection has been widely accepted as a\nstrong predictive factor for long-term sur-\nvival.1 The R0 resection rate was compar-\nable between the VR and PD groups in the\npresent study (P \u00bc 0.726), which perhaps\nresulted in the comparable long-term survival.\nIn a recent report, the International Study\nGroup of Pancreatic Surgery strongly recom-\nmended the limitation of VR and venous\nreconstruction to high-volume centers.5\nGenerally, venous grafting is considered a\nnecessary method if the length of the\nresected segment is >5 cm.24 In the current\nstudy, if the PV/SMV was involved by a\nmalignancy of >3 cm, venous conduits were\ninterposed to achieve a negative margin and\ntension-free anastomosis. Two sources of\ninterpositional venous grafts can be used for\nTable 1.

Other\nadvantages of external iliac vein grafts\ninclude better histocompatibility, a lower\nincidence of thrombosis, and no need for\nlong-term anticoagulation. However, exter-\nnal iliac vein grafts also have some disad-\nvantages. First, the unavailability of donor\niliac vein grafts restricts the application of\nthis technique, especially for centres without\nDCD. Additionally, in type II reconstruc-\ntion, the branch of the external and\ninternal iliac vein may not match the\nCumulative Survival (%)\nTime (months)\nFigure 3.

In contrast,\na suitable synthetic graft can be used for\nvenous reconstruction in most cases because\nof the broad choices available. Second, the\nlong-term patency of iliac vein grafting\nremains unclear because of the shortage of\nlong-term observation data and few reported\ncases. Third, the use of an allograft inevitably\nleads to additional infectious and epidemical\nrisks compared with the use of a synthetic\ngraft. Overall, however, use of the donor iliac\nveins in the present study achieved satisfac-\ntory long-term patency and did not lead\nto stenosis following antithrombotic treat-\nment. Because of the lack of antigenicity in\ncryopreserved grafts, blood matching and\nimmunosuppression are not needed. The\ntechnique performed in the present study\ndecreased the operation time and avoided\nedema and deep venous thrombosis because\nan autologous vein graft was not used. In\naddition, the cryopreserved iliac vein was long-\nlasting; therefore, it offered a ready-to-use\nconduit for venous grafting. One limitation\nof the present study is that the results of using\nthe iliac vein as a graft were not compared with\nthe results of using an autologous or synthetic\ngraft. Additionally, the difference in throm-\nbosis between the two types of venous recon-\nstruction could not be estimated because of the\nsmall number of patients.\nThe iliac vein can serve as a patch when a\nportion of the PV/SMV has been resected. An\nexperienced specialist operator and meticu-\nlous perivascular anatomy are indispensable\nfactors in ensuring high safety and smooth\nperformance of this surgical approach. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first study to\nevaluate the long-term results of reconstruc-\ntion of the PV/SMV using the iliac vein\nobtained by DCD in patients undergoing\nPD for treatment of ADHP.\nConclusion\nSegmental PV/SMV resection combined\nwith PD is comparable with PD in terms\nof R0 resection and long-term survival.\nTherefore, this technique is applicable to\npatients with ADHP if R0 resection has\nprobably been achieved. The iliac vein\nobtained by DCD is appropriate as a con-\nduit for PV/SMV reconstruction.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe Authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
