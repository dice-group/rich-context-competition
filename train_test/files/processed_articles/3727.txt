    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe current study examined the impact of active duty service members' symptoms following a combat deployment on child\nmental health symptoms. Soldiers from a brigade combat team (N = 974) participated in the study 2 months following return\nfrom a 15-month combat deployment to Afghanistan, of which 169 soldiers (17.3%) reported having at least one child living\nat home. Results supported two research hypotheses examining the interrelationship between parental posttraumatic stress\ndisorder (PTSD) symptoms, general aggression, and marital distress on child mental health. First, the study documented\na moderate association between parental PTSD symptoms and child mental health symptoms during the postdeployment\nreintegration period. This association was significant even after accounting for marital distress. Second, the study demonstrated\nthat the impact of PTSD symptoms on child mental health symptoms may be explained by parental general aggression such\nthat aggression mediated the PTSD symptoms\u00adchild mental health association.\n",

Aside from Vietnam, Operation Enduring\nFreedom (OEF) in Afghanistan has been the longest war the\nU.S. military has fought to date, and Operation Iraqi Freedom\n(OIF) the third longest (Hosek, 2011). More than 2.1 million\nservice members have deployed in support of these missions.\nparents, with 48% of these deployed parents having deployed\nmore than once (Department of Defense, 2010). In this time,\nnearly 2 million children experienced a parent's absence due\nto deployment (Flake, Davis, Johnson, & Middleton, 2009).\nStudies conducted with military families indicate that the\npsychological effects of a service member's deployment\nextend to their children. For example, the Survey of Army\nFamilies (Orthner & Rose, 2005) reported that approximately\n25% of school-age children were depressed because of\ndeployment separation and 37% reported fear of harm to the\ndeployed parent. Further evidence comes from a retrospective\ncohort study that linked health care visit records of children\nwith parents' deployment records (Gorman, Eide, & Hisle-\nGorman, 2010), and found that for children aged 3 to 8 years\nold, behavioral disorders increased 19% and stress disorders\nincreased 18% when the military parent was deployed.\nOther studies of child psychological adjustment and\nparental deployment have found that children aged 3 to 5\nyears with a deployed parent had significantly higher exter-\nnalizing behavior scores and clinically elevated internalizing\nbehavior when compared with same-aged peers without a\ndeployed parent (Chartrand, Frank, White, & Shope, 2008).\nChildren with a deployed parent also experienced more emo-\ntional and behavioral difficulties than civilian samples, and\n1Alpen-Adria-University Klagenfurt, Austria\n2U.S. Army Medical Research Unit-Europe, Walter Reed Army Institute of\nResearch, Sembach, Germany\n3Clemson University, South Carolina, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nHeather M.

Wright2\n Keywords\nchild mental health symptoms, general aggression, postdeployment, posttraumatic stress disorder, military populations\n2 SAGE Open\nthese difficulties tended to increase with deployment length\n(Chandra et al., 2010). Child attachment behaviors also have\nbeen related to length of deployment and number of deploy-\nments (Barker & Berry, 2009), and cumulative length of\nparental deployment during the child's lifetime predicted\nchild depression and externalizing behaviors (White, de\nBurgh, Fear, & Iversen, 2011). In one of the few studies\nincluding the previously deployed service member (Lester\net al., 2010), total number of months deployed and parental\ndistress (both at-home spouse and returned soldier) indepen-\ndently predicted child adjustment problems. The returned\nsoldier's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms\npredicted child depression as well as internalizing and exter-\nnalizing behaviors. Although these studies support the rela-\ntionship between child psychological adjustment and\nparental deployment, they do not explain the reasons why\nthese effects occur. In addition, many studies focus on psy-\nchological effects on the family during the deployment sepa-\nration time period rather than on the postdeployment\nreintegration period when the service member transitions\nback into the family.\nTo investigate the association between mental health\nsymptoms in returning service members and the effects on\ntheir children, a targeted assessment to determine possible\npathways and mediators is needed. To this end, the current\nstudy examined the interrelationship between the active duty\nservice member's PTSD symptoms, general aggression, and\nmarital distress following a combat deployment on child\nmental health symptoms. Two research questions were\nexamined:\nResearch Question 1: Can the parental PTSD\u00adchild\nmental health association be documented for a sample of\nactive duty service members who had just returned from a\ncombat deployment, and is the association significant\neven after accounting for a known risk factor for child\nmental health problems--marital distress?\nResearch Question 2: Is the impact of PTSD symptoms\nin returning service members on child mental health\nexplained by general aggression of the parent?\nPTSD and Child Outcomes\nMuch of the literature that explores psychological symptoms\nin returned war veterans and emotional and behavior conse-\nquences for their children has focused on PTSD symptoms as\nexacerbating risk for children (Dekel & Goldblatt, 2008).\nSeveral studies have examined parenting behaviors that may\nbe affected by PTSD symptoms. For example, a longitudinal\nstudy of returned National Guard soldiers and reintegration\neffects on the family system (Gewirtz, Polusny, DeGarmo,\nKhaylis, & Erbes, 2010) found that PTSD symptoms during\ndeployment influenced couple adjustment and parenting 1\nyear later. Positive parenting behaviors, child discipline and\nsupervision, and involvement and interest in the child's\nactivities were affected by the soldier's symptoms and\nresulted in impaired parent\u00adchild interactions.\nA review of the literature (Galovski & Lyons, 2004) sum-\nmarizing the effects of exposure to violence during combat\nconcluded that PTSD symptoms resulting from such expo-\nsure affected family relationships and psychological adjust-\nment. Numbing and arousal symptoms, as well as anger,\nwere predictive of family distress and secondary traumatiza-\ntion. The arousal cluster of PTSD symptoms promoted anger\nand hostility toward both spouses and children, and disrupted\nmarital and parental relationships (Wadsworth, 2010).\nCombat exposure, PTSD symptoms, and aggressive behav-\nior have also been related to violence and hostility in the\nfamilies of veterans as well as increased aggression in their\nchildren (Glenn et al., 2002). This research was conducted\nwith an older cohort of children of Vietnam veterans and\nrevealed a possible continuity of risk of behavioral problems\ninto adolescence and early adulthood.\nAdditional support for the negative effects of PTSD on\nparenting comes from studies of spouses and partners of vet-\nerans (Manguno-Mire et al., 2007) who were secondarily\ntraumatized by the service members' PTSD, and reported\nnegativeconsequencesforparentingbehaviors.Psychological\neffects have also included secondary traumatization for chil-\ndren (Rosenheck & Nathan, 1985) and higher risk of devel-\noping behavioral or psychiatric problems (Davidson, Smith,\n& Kudler, 1989). One study compared Vietnam combat vet-\nerans with and without PTSD, and found significantly more\nbehavioral problems among those children of veterans with\nPTSD than among children of veterans without PTSD\n(Jordan et al., 1992). More specifically, research from the\nVeteran Center counselor survey (Matsakis, 1988) reported\nthat the most common problems among children of veterans\nwere low self-esteem, aggressiveness, developmental diffi-\nculties, impaired social relationships, and symptoms charac-\nteristic of secondary traumatization.\nThese findings suggest that PTSD symptoms in the\nreturned service member contribute to negative mental health\noutcomes in their children; however, the link requires further\nexplanation. One possibility is the association between\nPTSD and aggression (e.g., Taft et al., 2007). As there is evi-\ndence that aggression in a parent predicts child outcomes\n(Jouriles, Barling, & O'Leary, 1987; Margolin & Gordis,\n2000), aggression could be a mediating factor explaining the\nPTSD\u00adchild outcome link.\nPTSD, General Aggression, and Child\nOutcomes\nPopulation-based cross-sectional studies of service members\nhave documented anger and aggression as frequently\nreported problems for combat veterans returning from war in\nIraq and Afghanistan (Jakupcak et al., 2007; Killgore et al.,\naggressive behaviors as comorbid with PTSD (Forbes,\nForan et al. 3\nCreamer, Hawthorne, Allen, & McHugh, 2003; Thomas\net al., 2010), and found that combat experiences such as\nexposure to human trauma, combat violence, and killing pre-\ndicted verbal and physical aggression toward others (Killgore\net al., 2008). Combat veterans with PTSD symptoms, but not\nmeeting full diagnostic criteria for PTSD, also reported sig-\nnificantly higher aggressive behaviors when compared with\nthe non-PTSD group, thus increasing the potential magni-\ntude of postcombat adjustment problems for service mem-\nbers returning home to their families (Jakupcak et al., 2007).\nAmeta-analysis examined the association between anger and\nPTSD (Orth & Wieland, 2006). The authors found larger\neffect sizes in samples with military war experiences com-\npared with samples exposed to other types of trauma, sug-\ngesting that anger may be a more likely response for those\nexposed to combat.\nAlthough very little research has explored the link\nbetween general aggression and child outcomes in families\nof returning service members, findings from the civilian lit-\nerature indicate that parental aggression is a risk factor for\nchild behavioral and emotional problems (Jouriles et al.,\nsion may affect the child even if it is not directed at the child\nbut at the spouse or other nonfamily members (Galovski &\nGiannetta, 2001). A parent's display of anger/aggressiveness\nmay manifest in several ways that affect the child (e.g., ver-\nbal outbursts, marital conflicts, angry facial expressions, and\nother visible displays). Children who are exposed to angry\ninteractions between their parents may become more sensi-\ntized to marital conflict and more vulnerable to its effects\n(Faircloth, 2012). This, in turn, may lead to the child having\nlower thresholds for exposure to aggression and experienc-\ning increased arousal, distress, and fear which can affect\ntheir mental health. Anger and general aggression rather than\nmore covert symptoms of PTSD may be important in under-\nstanding the impacts on children and families. Thus, one\nmechanism by which PTSD symptoms have an effect on a\nchild's mental health symptoms may be via increased aggres-\nsion in the parent.\nMarital Distress and Child Outcomes\nFrom the civilian literature, there is substantial evidence\nthat parental marital distress and conflict can increase risk\nof child mental health problems (Rhoades, 2008).\nConsequently, the impact of marital distress on children in\nmilitary families is an important consideration as marital\nproblems have been reported as significant, negative out-\ncomes of combat deployment. An extensive review of\nresearch on readjustment needs for service members and\ntheirfamilies(CommitteeontheAssessmentofReadjustment\nNeeds of Military Personnel, Veterans, and Their Families,\n2013) identified several key studies documenting the impact\nof deployment on marital and family quality. For example, a\npopulation-based longitudinal study of service members\nreturning from Iraq andAfghanistan (Milliken,Auchterlonie,\n& Hoge, 2007) found an increase in reported interpersonal\nproblems (including those with family members) from the\nreintegration period up to 6 months later. Additional popula-\ntion-based assessments of family and marital problems were\ndocumented in the Army Gold Book Report (Department of\nin counseling. Therefore, the consequences of marital dis-\ntress and conflict should be considered in the assessment of\nchild outcomes to determine whether parental relationship\nproblems are the key mechanism affecting psychological\nadjustment in children of returning service members.\nMarital Distress, General Aggression,\nand Child Outcomes\nMarital distress is a robust predictor of anger and aggressive\nbehaviors, particularly directed at the spouse (Stith, Green,\nSmith, &Ward, 2008; Stith, Rosen, McCollum, &Thompson,\n2004). Marital conflict also has been identified as a strong\npredictor of adults seeking mental health services and of\npoor psychological adjustment for children, with severity of\naggression linked to marital functioning for the couple and to\ndepression, delinquency, aggression, and declines in psycho-\nsocial functioning for children (Faircloth, 2012). Research\nconducted with a nationally representative sample (Vissing,\nStraus, Gelles, & Harrop, 1991) found that children who wit-\nnessed verbally aggressive conflict between their parents had\nhigher rates of interpersonal problems, aggression, and\ndelinquency than other children. This finding suggests that\nan atmosphere of anger and conflict in the family can lead to\nmental health problems for children.\nMarital distress also may increase risk of angry and\naggressive behaviors toward children and aggression in\ngeneral. As a result, chronic patterns of violence or an\natmosphere of anger and aggression in the home may affect\nfamily relationships and the psychological adjustment of\nfamily members. For example, anger in postcombat veter-\nans has been associated with family relationships marked\nby distress and emotional conflict, with the veteran's anger\ndirected at a variety of targets and not necessarily at their\nspouses and children (Galovski & Lyons, 2004). In a\nreview of family risk and resilience in the context of war,\nWadsworth (2010) reported that OIF/OEF veterans at post-\ndeployment felt uncertain of their family roles and believed\ntheir family members were afraid of them, with many\ndescribing conflicts involving shouting, pushing, and\nshoving. Thus, not only abuse or aggression directed at the\nspouse but also other types of aggressive or angry behav-\niors may increase in response to marital distress. Taken as\na whole, this literature suggests that parental aggression\nrepresents one of the possible causal mechanisms linking\nparental PTSD symptoms and marital distress to child\nmental health problems.\n4 SAGE Open\nCurrent Study\nThe current study examined the interrelationship between\nparents' PTSD symptoms, general aggression, marital dis-\ntress, and military children's mental health. While many\nstudies have focused on the civilian spouse during the sepa-\nration period, the current study examined the impact of the\nactive duty service member's symptoms following a com-\nbat deployment on child mental health symptoms (hyperac-\ntivity, conduct, and emotional problems). We hypothesized\nthat the service member's PTSD symptoms and marital dis-\ntress would both predict child mental health symptoms.\nHowever, we expected general aggression of the parent\nwould mediate the impact of PTSD symptoms and marital\ndistress in returning service members on child mental\nhealth.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nActive duty soldiers from a brigade combat team (N =\n1,068) were invited to participate in the study 2 months\nfollowing return from a 15-month combat deployment to\nAfghanistan. The study was approved by the local\nInstitutional Review Board, and informed consent was\nobtained for all study participants, similar to other studies\nwith active duty soldiers (e.g., Wright, Foran, Wood,\nEckford, & McGurk, 2012). Surveys were administered to\nlarge groups of soldiers and required approximately 1 hr to\ncomplete. After being briefed on the purpose and proce-\ndure of the study, 91% consented to participate (N = 974)\nand were administered the anonymous paper-and-pencil\nsurvey. Participants in the current study included only\nthose who reported having at least one child between the\nsample). This rate is expected as this was a study of sol-\ndiers who served in a heavy combat deployment of which\nhalf of the overall sample was below 24. Sample demo-\ngraphics are presented in Table 1.\nMeasures\nParental PTSD symptoms. The widely used 17-item Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL; Blanchard,\nJones-Alexander, Buckley, & Forneris, 1996) was used to\nassess PTSD symptoms. This measure has been validated\nwith active duty military personnel (Bliese et al., 2008) and\nshown to have high internal consistency (e.g., Cronbach's \n= .96, current sample). Participants rated symptoms in the\nlast month using a 5-point scale from 1 = not at all to 5 =\nextremely. Possible scores range from 17 to 85 with scores\ngreater than 34 indicating a positive screen for PTSD symp-\ntoms among active duty military populations (Bliese et al.,\nChild mental health symptoms.The Strengths and Diffi-\nculties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997) was used to\nassess child behavioral difficulties in children aged 3 to 17.\nIn addition to an overall score, the SDQ includes three sub-\nscales that assessed emotional problems (five items), conduct\nproblems (five items), and hyperactivity/inattention (five\nitems) rated on a dichotomous scale (0 = symptom absent,\n1 = symptom present). This measure has good psychometric\nhas previously been used to assess child mental health symp-\ntoms among military samples (Chandra et al., 2010). Partici-\npants reported on symptoms for up to six children; symptoms\nscores were averaged across children. In addition, scores\nwere computed using responses for the child with the highest\nscores reported within the family. Results were similar, so\nonly average scores will be presented. In the current sample,\nthe subscale alphas were .69 for hyperactivity/inattention,\n.58 for conduct problems, and .64 for emotional problems.\nThese low to moderate alphas are not surprising, given that\neach subscale consists only of five items that are relatively\nbroad in symptom content (Cortina, 1993). Cronbach's  for\nMarital distress. Marital distress was examined with three\ndichotomous items: \"Are you having marital problems?\"\n\"Have you and your spouse gotten into frequent arguments\nor disagreements?\" and the reverse-scored item, \"Is your\nrelationship strong?\" This measure was developed based\non item response theory analysis of commonly used mari-\ntal distress items in military samples (Bliese, Wright, Adler,\nTable 1. Participant Characteristics.\nVariable %\nRank\n Officer/warrant officer 8.9\nAge (years)\nNumber of children\nUnit type\nForan et al. 5\nscale from 1 to 2, with higher scores indicating more marital\ndistress. These items have been used in other studies with\nmilitary samples (Foran, Wright, & Wood, 2013). Internal\nconsistency was .81.\nGeneral aggression.General aggression was assessed\nwith eight items developed by the Walter Reed Army Insti-\ntute of Research based on longer anger and aggression\n1999) and used in previous studies with military populations\n(Cabrera, Bliese, Hoge, Castro, & Messer, 2010; Wilk et al.,\n2013). The items asked about angry feelings and aggressive\nbehaviors during the past month (e.g., \"threaten someone\nwith physical violence,\" \"get into a fight with someone and\nhit the person,\" \"get angry at someone and yell or shout at\nthem,\" \"boil inside with anger,\" \"feel like smashing some-\nthing,\" \"get angry with someone and kick or smash some-\nthing,\" \"slam the door,\" and \"punch the wall\"). The items\nwere rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 = never to\n5 = five or more times. The internal consistency of the scale\nwas .89. The aggressive behaviors may have been directed\nat the spouse, child, or nonfamily member. The scale was\nnot meant to assess a specific type of aggression (i.e.,\nspouse aggression) but rather aggression in general, which\nis a common presenting problem among combat veterans\nseeking mental health services (e.g., Taft et al., 2009). As\nexpected, this measure was significantly but not perfectly\ncorrelated with a two-item measure of spouse aggression\nResults\nSample Descriptives and Bivariate Correlations\nAlmost one third of the sample reported PTSD symptoms\nabove the cutoff of 34 or higher (31%). This high rate of\nPTSD symptoms is expected, given that there was a high\nlevel of combat exposure during the deployment. For exam-\nple, 64% of the sample reported being attacked or ambushed,\n79% reported that an improvised explosive device (IED) or\nbooby trap exploding near them, and 51% reported a mem-\nber of their own unit was killed in action.\nIn terms of child mental health symptoms, 50.9% of par-\nticipants reported at least three hyperactivity symptoms for\none of their children, 11.8% reported at least three emotional\nsymptoms, and 9.3% reported at least three conduct symp-\ntoms. As shown in Table 2, parental PTSD symptoms, child\nmental health, marital quality, and general aggression of the\nparent were all significantly correlated as hypothesized.\nModel of Parental PTSD Symptoms, Marital\nDistress, and Child Mental Health\nStructural equation modeling was used to test the multi-\nvariate model of parental PTSD symptoms, marital dis-\ntress, and child mental health. Mplus 7.1 statistical\nsoftware was used to conduct the analyses (Mplus, 2010).\nModel fit was evaluated with a variety of fit indices,\nincluding comparative fit index (CFI) > .95, Tucker\u00ad\nLewis Index (TLI) > .95, root mean square error of\napproximation (RMSEA) < .08, and standardized root\nmean square residuals (SRMR) < .08 (Browne & Cudeck,\nFirst, we tested a model in which PTSD symptoms and\nmarital distress predicted latent child mental health to deter-\nmine whether they both accounted for unique variance in the\ncontext of each other. Because child mental health symptoms\nwere strongly correlated, we analyzed them as a single latent\nconstruct in the model, treating each dimension as a separate\nindicator in the model. For latent child mental health, the fac-\ntor variance was fixed to 1.0 and factor loadings were freely\nestimated. Analyses were conducted with full-maximum-\nlikelihood estimation with robust statistics to adjust for\npotential bias due to multivariate nonnormality (Asparouhov\n& Muth\u00e9n, 2005); notably, missing data on the various mea-\nsymptoms and marital distress were free to covary. Results\nare presented in Figure 1. The model was a good fit to the\nTable 2. Descriptive Statistics and Bivariate Correlations (n = 169).\n1. Parent PTSD symptoms \nNote.

Both parental PTSD symptoms\nand marital distress uniquely predicted child mental health in\nthe context of each other, and the size of the association was\nsimilar and of moderate magnitude; total variance accounted\nfor in child mental health symptoms was 21%.\nTo test our hypothesis that general aggression may be a\nmediating factor that explains the association between parental\nPTSD symptoms and child mental health and between marital\ndistress and child mental health, we tested a second model in\nwhich aggression was a mediating variable. Maximum likeli-\nhood with bootstrapped standard errors was used to test the\nmodel (1,000 draws). The model was a good fit to the data: 2(6,\nSRMR = .03. Results are presented in Figure 2. In Table 3,\nunstandardized estimates and confidence intervals for each path\nare reported.The direct paths from PTSD symptoms and marital\ndistress to child mental health were no longer significant once\nparent general aggression was added to the model. Furthermore,\nwhen the direct paths from PTSD symptoms and marital dis-\ntress to child mental health symptoms were removed from the\nRMSEA = .06, SRMR = .04, it did not significantly reduce\nindirect paths from both PTSD symptoms and marital distress to\nchild mental health via parent aggression were significant. The\nmodel accounted for 28% of the variance in child mental health.\nThese results suggest that parental general aggression may be\none mechanism through which parental PTSD symptoms and\nmarital distress influence child outcomes.\nFigure 1. Parental PTSD symptoms, marital distress, and child mental health following deployment.\nNote. Standardized regression coefficients. PTSD = posttraumatic stress disorder.\nForan et al. 7\nDiscussion\nResults from the current study supported the two research\nquestions examining parental PTSD symptoms, general\naggression, marital distress, and mental health of their chil-\ndren among active duty service members returning from a\ncombat deployment. For the first research question, the\nstudy documented the association between parental PTSD\nsymptoms and child mental health symptoms during the\npostdeployment reintegration period. This association was\nsignificant even after accounting for marital distress (see\nTable 2 and model depicted in Figure 1). For the second\nresearch question, the study demonstrated that the impact\nof PTSD symptoms on child mental health symptoms\namong returning military personnel may be explained by\nparental general aggression such that aggression mediated\nthe PTSD symptoms\u00adchild mental health outcomes (see\nFigure 2).\nThis study extended the literature by focusing on the con-\nditions for children in the military family during postdeploy-\nment as the returning veteran transitions home from combat.\nCombat-related trauma as expressed by PTSD symptoms,\nand the anger and general aggression found to mediate PTSD\nsymptoms, may pose a significant problem for the psycho-\nlogical adjustment of children exposed to deployment transi-\ntion challenges. The possibility of increased risk of negative\nmental health outcomes for these children suggests the need\nfor early intervention, given the large numbers of veterans\nreturning from combat deployment and the numbers of their\nchildren who may face exposure to reintegration adjustment\nproblems. Future studies are recommended to address how\nthe effects of combat trauma on family relationships can be\nreduced, and how children can be better protected during the\nadjustment period following return from deployment\n(Wadsworth, 2010). Some recently planned intervention\nprojects designed to help military families through the\ndeployment process are promising (Gewirtz, Erbes, Polusny,\nForgatch, & DeGarmo, 2011) as they focus on intervention\nstrategies to support at-risk families by improving parenting\npractices and child adjustment.\nTo build on the findings from the current study, research\nshould be conducted to further explore the connections\n(pathways and mediating variables) between general aggres-\nsion in the returning veteran and effects on their families.\nThe importance of such research is illustrated by studies con-\nducted with an older cohort of children of Vietnam veterans\n(Glenn et al., 2002) that revealed a possible continuity of risk\nof behavioral problems into adolescence and early adulthood\nfor those families exposed to violent and hostile interper-\nsonal interactions, suggesting the potential for long-term\nnegative mental health outcomes.\nThere are some important limitations to our study that\nneed to be acknowledged and that raise interesting questions\nfor future research. Our sample was composed predomi-\nnantly of fathers. The high proportion of men in the sample\nis consistent with known characteristics of service members\nwith combat deployment experience who are mostly male.\nNevertheless, it is possible that our results might not gener-\nalize to mothers, for whom the parent\u00adchild mental health\nrelationship may differ. For example, in the Morris, Gabert-\nQuillen, and Delahanty, (2012) meta-analytic review of the\nrelationship between adult PTSD and child PTSD symp-\ntoms among civilian families exposed to trauma concluded\nthat this relationship was stronger for mothers than for\nfathers. Thus, our findings might underestimate the effects\nin a sample with greater proportions of mothers. The path-\nways linking PTSD and marital distress to child mental\nhealth symptoms also could differ by gender, such that\naggression could be a more important factor for men than\nfor women. These possibilities highlight the need for contin-\nued attention to how sample characteristics affect study\nfindings in this research domain.\nAnother important issue concerns the fact that we only\ngathered data from the deployed spouse and not from the\nnondeployed spouse. Our study offers a unique perspective\non child mental health as studies typically only obtain infor-\nmation from the nondeployed spouse. However, an assess-\nment from both parents would provide a more complete\npicture of child outcomes. For example, the nondeployed\nspouse would have greater opportunities to observe their\nchildren's mental health symptoms, whereas the deployed\nspouse may only hear about issues when they become prob-\nlems. However, child mental health may be a more salient\nconcern to the nondeployed spouse, leading them to be more\naware of their children's symptoms and/or more affected by\nthem. Moreover, assessment of the nondeployed spouse to\ndetermine patterns of coping, stress level, and psychological\nsymptoms during the deployment and following the service\nmember's return home would provide important information\nto better address risk and protective factors from a family\nsystems perspective. These possible differences in reporting\npatterns between service members and nondeployed spouses\nraise several interesting questions for future research.\nFurthermore, we assessed aggression broadly and did not\ninclude a distinct measure of anger or types of aggression\n(e.g., parent-to-child aggression, spouse aggression). There\nis substantial literature that indicates anger as a risk factor for\naggressive behaviors (Anderson & Bushman, 2002), and\nboth anger and aggression are more frequently experienced\namong combat-exposed veterans with PTSD symptoms\nassessment of anger and aggression broadly maps onto treat-\nment strategies in which both are typically addressed together\n(e.g.,angermanagementprogramsforveterans).Nonetheless,\nthere are also important differences between anger and sub-\ntypes of aggression, and these should be evaluated further in\ntheir relation to child mental health following deployments.\nAnother potential limitation concerns the cross-sectional\nstudy design. One important issue is that there may be bidi-\nrectional effects of adult and child mental health as well as\n8 SAGE Open\nmarital distress and aggression. Both marital distress and\ngeneral aggression may have been elevated prior to deploy-\nment. This may have in turn increased the risk of PTSD\nsymptoms following return from deployment. We are, how-\never, unable to demonstrate this in the current study, and can-\nnot conclude whether there are long-term effects on family\nadjustment. Prospective, longitudinal studies with larger\nsamples are recommended that would provide data on preex-\nisting child behavior concerns, marital distress, aggression,\nand PTSD symptoms to identify either improvements or\nexacerbation of problems over the course of the deployment\ncycle.\nSummary\nA particular strength of the current study is that it included an\nassessment of redeploying service members during a unique\ntime frame immediately following their 15-month combat\ndeployment with data collected from the perspective of the\nreturning service member. In addition, the study highlights\nthe importance of parental general aggression as a potential\nmechanism of transmission of mental health symptoms from\nparent to child. There is evidence of an association between\nPTSD and general aggression in returning service members,\nand the study now demonstrates that the impact extends to\nchild mental health outcomes. Future research should explore\nthe possible bidirectional effects of child outcomes on the\nreturning soldier and impacts on other family members from\na family systems perspective (Minuchin, 1985).\nAuthors' Note\nThe findings described in this article were collected under a Walter\nReed Army Institute of Research Protocol.
