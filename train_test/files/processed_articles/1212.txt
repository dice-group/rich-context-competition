In this study, we examined whether\ndifferences in care patterns exist on a lon-\ngitudinal basis for individuals with glau-\ncoma enrolled in the Medicare program.\nFirst, we determined whether the rate of di-\nagnosis of glaucoma according to race com-\nportswiththemostrecentestimatesbyPre-\nvent Blindness America and the National\nEye Institute.15 Second, we investigated\nwhether longitudinal care patterns, once\nglaucoma is diagnosed, vary according to\nrace.

The sample of 21 644 persons was further reduced\nin those years in which the person was enrolled in a Medicare\nHMO for more than 6 months in a particular year. For ex-\nample, if a beneficiary was enrolled in an HMO for more than\n6 months during 1993 but was in an HMO for less time than\nthis in the other years, the person would have been excluded\nfrom the analysis sample only in 1993. This adjustment was\nnecessary because Medicare did not receive information about\nutilization of services of beneficiaries in HMOs until after 1999.\nInformation about whether a beneficiary belonged to an HMO\neach month was obtained from separate Medicare enrollment\nfiles. The number of persons excluded from the analysis be-\ncause of HMO enrollment varied each year and ranged from\n2000, but no persons diagnosed as having glaucoma were added\nto the original sample after 1999 to allow for at least 1 year of\nfollow-up data.\nTo identify persons with glaucoma, we searched for glau-\ncoma-specific diagnosis codes in the Medicare claims data\n(Table 1, Panel A). Persons entered the sample in the year\nafter diagnosis, but not before 1991, the first year in which di-\nagnosis codes were available in Medicare physician carrier data.\nWe identified medical records of eye examinations and surgi-\ncal procedures performed for glaucoma treatment by using Cur-\nrent Procedural Terminology and International Classification of\nDiseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) pro-\ncedure codes (Table 1, Panel B). We identified the individual's\nrace from Medicare vital statistics information linked to our data\nset. We excluded 685 persons (3.2%) who were not explicitly\nclassified as either black or white.\nEach person entered the database repeatedly every year af-\nter the year of diagnosis until 2000 or death, whichever oc-\ncurred first. We calculated annual prevalence as the number\nof persons with glaucoma diagnosed before year end, divided\nby the total number of persons, excluding those alive for fewer\nthan 6 months or those covered by Medicare HMOs for more\nthan 6 months during the year.\nwith glaucoma diagnosed, for at least 1 year from 1992 through\n2000, including those persons with codes for suspected glau-\ncoma status (Table 2).

Blacks were less likely to have other forms\nof glaucoma (suspected glaucoma, the omitted refer-\nence group, and other glaucoma), cataracts, and ARMD.\nCompared with white persons in the sample, black per-\nsons were slightly older (1 year on average) and were\nmore likely to be female, live in urban areas, be less edu-\ncated, have a lower income, be less likely to be married,\nbe more likely to have children living within 1 hour dis-\ntance, and have more comorbidities. Black persons were\nalso more likely to have a diagnosis of dementia, re-\nported more limitations in activities of daily living, were\nless likely to be in a nursing home, and were more likely\nto die during any given year.\nRates of diagnosed glaucoma among those who sur-\nvived the year increased over time for both blacks and\nwhites (Table 4). Rates for blacks increased from 11.2%\ncreased from 8.8% to 26.0%. Prevalence was signifi-\nP  .001). As the cohort aged, the ratios of black to white\nin 1999. Rates of narrow-angle glaucoma were higher\nbut there were no statistically significant differences in\nprevalence of other and suspected glaucoma.\nHaving other major eye diseases in combination with\nglaucoma may not only complicate therapy but also lead\nto poorer visual outcomes on average than having glau-\ncoma alone. Joint prevalence of glaucoma and DR was\nthe same for blacks as for whites in 1991, but the joint\nprevalence of glaucoma and DR increased substantially\ncoma also had DR diagnosed, compared with 5.4% for\nwhites. Joint prevalence of glaucoma and ARMD and joint\nprevalence of glaucoma, DR, and ARMD were generally\nlower for blacks than for whites, but the differences were\nnot statistically significant at conventional levels.\nIn the second phase of the study, we examined use of\neye care services conditional on a diagnosis of glau-\ncoma. The purpose of limiting this analysis to persons\nwith diagnosed glaucoma was to obtain a better sense of\nwhether racial disparities existed in the provision of ser-\nvices after initial access barriers were overcome and blacks\nentered the health care system with a diagnosis of some\nform of glaucoma.\nBlacks with glaucoma (including suspected glau-\ncoma) diagnosed were 32% (P  .001) less likely to un-\ndergo eye examination during the year, not accounting\nfor other factors likely to affect use (Table 6). Control-\nling for the other covariates reduced this difference in\nhalf to 16% (P=.09). Thus, it appears that more blacks\nthan whites were likely to be sporadic in their care pat-\nterns, and the nearly identical mean annual utilization\nrates (Table 2) suggest that blacks who received care did\nso in a more intense fashion.\nBlacks were 88% more likely to have eye surgery for\nglaucoma during a year than were whites (P  .001).\nWhen we controlled for other covariates, the difference\nremained high--64% (P  .001). Rates of eye examina-\ntions were not significantly different between blacks and\nwhites, whereas rates of surgery were 83% higher for\nblacks than for whites diagnosed as having glaucoma with-\nTable 4.

Controlling for the other factors changed the\nglaucoma patients overall, there was no difference be-\ntween blacks and whites in the mean number of annual\nexaminations, but surgery rates were 71% to 76% higher\nfor blacks than whites (P  .001).\nCOMMENT\nBlacks were more likely than whites to have a diagnosis\nof glaucoma. However, our study estimates of preva-\nlence according to race demonstrated a lower ratio than\nexpected of diagnosed glaucoma in blacks than in whites\namong those 65 years and older.1,5 The rate of suspected\nglaucoma was lower for blacks than whites at all inter-\nvals as the cohort of survivors grew older. If patients with\na definite POAG diagnosis are combined with those sus-\npected of having glaucoma, the ratio of rates for blacks\nto whites decreases further below the 1.8 ratio esti-\nmated by Prevent Blindness America; the race-specific es-\ntimates and ratios from the Baltimore Eye Survey, which\nexceed 4 in the Medicare age group; and ratios from other\nThe longitudinal ratio of glaucoma diagnosis rates\namong blacks compared with that among whites was less\nthan that estimated in cross-sectional studies. Unlike the\nauthors of studies in which cross-sectional data were used\nto demonstrate differences in rates of diagnosis relative\nto population-based estimates,1,5,19 we longitudinally fol-\nlowed up a nationally representative cohort of persons\n65 years and older to estimate these rates of glaucoma\n(particularly POAG) diagnosis. Our analysis revealed\nlower glaucoma diagnosis rates among blacks in gen-\neral, and of POAG in particular, than did analyses in ear-\nlier studies.\nThe present study, moreover, also provides some in-\nsights into why this shortfall relative to the expected ra-\ntiomightormightnotbeanimportantproblem.Thepreva-\nlence rates among blacks in this cohort, whose average age\nthan 30%, an expected level based on findings in the Bar-\nbados Eye Study population.22 In contrast, relative to find-\ningsintheBaltimoreEyeSurvey,19 rateswerenearly3times\nhigheramongblacks,andtheywerealmost10timeshigher\namong whites in our study relative to the Barbados Eye\nStudy22; the resulting ratio is less than might be expected\nfrom results of either previous study. Whether this find-\ning represents overdiagnosis among whites or underdiag-\nnosis among blacks, or both, cannot be answered from our\ndata. In fact, it may be neither of these but a manifesta-\ntion of the longitudinal nature of our study--as opposed\nto findings with cross-sectional estimates--and the larger\nsample sizes involved in this study relative to those in the\npopulation-based studies. (The Baltimore Eye Survey19 in-\ncluded only 11 black and 4 white patients with definite\nPOAG cases among persons 80 years and older.) At a mini-\nmum, our estimates provide an alternative estimate of\nprevalence rates.\nFinally, as noted in an earlier study,16 the influence of\nusingphysician-baseddiagnosticcriteriaasopposedtospe-\ncific study criteria may affect our reported rates, so it is less\ncertain whether there is a significant degree of underdiag-\nnosis of glaucoma among blacks. The study results sug-\ngest that it would be worth examining actual rates of glau-\ncoma diagnosis to determine if access is being garnered in\nthe health care system so that diagnoses can be made.\nOur study results also indicate that there are 2 dis-\ntinct groups once blacks have received a diagnosis of glau-\ncoma. First, there is a group that does not obtain access\nto regular care, as is evident by the larger share of black\nindividuals without annual examinations. There is, how-\never, also a second group for whom the rate of visits to\nTable 6.

The rates of surgery are much higher among blacks\non per person and subpopulation bases, confirming the\ndirection of findings in earlier cross-sectional studies.\nIn our study, blacks were much more likely to un-\ndergo glaucoma surgery once they had glaucoma diag-\nnosed. Compared with authors of previous cross-\nsectional studies, we were able to monitor surgical use\nper person across time. Thus, in contrast to conclusions\nof prior studies such as that of Wang et al,5 our conclu-\nsions do not indicate a lower rate than expected of glau-\ncoma surgery among blacks with glaucoma; instead, we\nfound a higher rate among blacks, so we cannot draw any\nsignificant conclusions about underservice.\nHigher rates of glaucoma surgery reported for blacks in\nour study most likely reflect the greater clinical severity of\ndiseaseamongblacks.Although,toourknowledge,therec-\nommendation of surgery according to race has not been\nstudied within ophthalmology, research in other fields of\nmedicine suggests that blacks are less likely than whites\nto be offered invasive or surgical therapies.23,24 To the ex-\ntent that this result generalizes to ophthalmology, there is\nthe implication that the higher rates of surgery for blacks\nin our study reflect greater clinical severity of glaucoma for\nblacks than for whites at diagnosis. Unfortunately, we did\nnot have direct information about the clinical severity of\nglaucoma among black patients.\nThe results of this study demonstrate the value of lon-\ngitudinal data for learning about the roles of race and other\ndemographic factors in use of health services. Because\nof the relatively larger sample sizes of individuals in the\nolder age cohorts compared with those in population-\nbased studies, rate estimates may be robust in different\nways in longitudinal than in population-based studies.\nCounterbalanced against this gain is the loss of preci-\nsion of disease definition. However, prevalence and in-\ncidence estimates from this study population provide es-\ntimates similar to those in population-based studies for\nglaucoma,16 suggesting that this case identification is-\nsue may not be overly problematic.\nIn conclusion, the present study results demonstrate\nthat, to the extent possible with administrative data, no\nclear pattern of significant undertreatment of glaucoma\namong blacks exists. Although the ratio of diagnosed cases\nin blacks compared with that in whites is lower than ex-\npected from the Baltimore Eye Survey,19 there is a some-\nwhat surprising finding in that the rate of glaucoma among\nthe white population is relatively much higher, which re-\nduces the ratio. Additional investigation as to the clini-\ncal severity of disease and the resulting influences on pat-\nterns of care are the next step. We hope that other\ninvestigators also will pursue these studies.\nSubmitted for Publication: December 4, 2003; final re-\nCorrespondence: Frank A.
