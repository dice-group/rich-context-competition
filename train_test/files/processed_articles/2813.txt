Ecological legacies from post-settlement\nland-use in Eastern North America are documented at the plot [1\u00ad4] and regional levels [5\u00ad7].\nSettlers did not randomly scatter across the landscape, but rather, conditioned their choices to\na set of criteria that reflected the demands of contemporary cultural, economic and agricultural\nsystems. The land these settlers encountered was not pristine untouched wilderness, but a\nlandscape that was shaped and modified by Native American populations for thousands of\nyears [8]. In this paper, we argue that the settlement patterns and persistent legacies of the\nEuro-Americans were themselves conditioned by the land use legacies of the Native Americans\nthat preceded them. To explain the significance of this patterning, we draw on the concept of\necological inheritance from niche construction theory [9].\nInfluences of Native American land use on the\nColonial Euro-American settlement of the South\nEditor: Sergi Lozano, Institut Catal\u00e0 de\nPaleoecologia Humana i Evolucio\n\u00b4 Social (IPHES),\nSPAIN\nCopyright: \u00a9 2018 Coughlan, Nelson.

In Europe, where inten-\nsive agricultural land use has been practiced for millennia, the ubiquity of land use legacies is\nwell established [14\u00ad17]. On a much smaller scale, ecologically significant land use legacies\nhave been detected in South America [18\u00ad20] and in Mexico and Central America [21, 22].\nNative American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajecto-\nries of many North American landscapes [8, 23\u00ad27]. Paleoecological and coincident archaeo-\nlogical data from some locations support this argument [28\u00ad31].\nHowever, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of the land use legacies\nof prehistoric Native Americans. Some scholars argue that the ecological legacy effects of past\nNative American land use were significant and nearly ubiquitous [26, 32]. Others maintain\nthat the effects were highly localized and therefore insignificant at broader scales [33\u00ad36]. At\nthe core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly\n\"wild\" landscape or an already \"humanized\" landscape. Progress in eastern North America has\nfocused on resolving issues of pattern and scale of prehistoric and historical Native American\nland use. This work suggests that localized patches of anthropogenic disturbance were embed-\nded in a broader, heterogeneous landscape matrix [37, 38]. As a consequence, the vast majority\nof the prehistoric North American landscape was dominated by natural rather than anthropo-\ngenic forces. Even so, at any scale, empirical analyses of material legacies of past Native Ameri-\ncan land use in contemporary socioecological systems remains relatively limited [6, 39\u00ad41].\nHere, we test the hypothesis that cumulative, environmental legacies of Native American\nland use influenced the location and timing of Euro-American settlement events for individual\nparcels of land in the landscape surrounding the confluences of the Broad, Enoree, and Tyger\nRivers of South Carolina. We use an event-history analysis [42, 43] to statistically model spatial\nand temporal associations between archaeological evidence of prehistoric Native American\nland use and Colonial Euro-American settlement processes in the Southern Piedmont Physio-\ngraphic Region of eastern North America. Historical narratives suggest that Native American\nagricultural legacies (successional old fields, floodplain canebrakes, semi-cultivated nut and\nfruit bearing trees) were important in the Euro-American settlement process [44, 45].
