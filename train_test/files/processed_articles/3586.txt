Elections may be the\neasy case. They come around fairly regularly and generally\nhave set rules for their resolution that are observable.\nHowever, leaders of countries often change for irregular\nreasons. In late February 2014, pro-Russian President\nViktor Yanukovych of Ukraine fled the capital after mass\nprotests erupted into violence, and parliament appointed an\ninterim President to rule until the May elections. A month\nearlier, in the Central African Republic, Muslim President\nMichel Djotodia was forced out of office in the face of\nescalating violence between the Muslim S\u00e9l\u00e9ka regime and\nthe largely Christian anti-balaka coalition. In July 2013, the\nmilitary in Egypt staged a coup and removed democrati-\ncally elected Mohammed Morsi from the Presidency, fol-\nlowing waves of protest against Muslim Brotherhood rule.\nEach of these three events \u00ad a successful mass protest\ncampaign, a successful rebellion, and a coup d'\u00e9tat \u00ad all\nshare the same outcome: the sudden removal of a sitting\nleader by means outside the \"normal\" range of political\ncompetition. We call this outcome irregular leadership\nchange (ILC): the unexpected removal of the principal\npolitical leader through means that contravene a state's\nconventions and laws. Instead of addressing specific mech-\nanisms that drive different types of ILCs, such as narrow\nconspiracies, mass protests, or armed insurrections, we\ninstead focus on what leads to the common outcome of\nILC. Viewed this way, there have been about four dozen\nbeginning with Mullar Omar's seizure of power in\nAfghanistan in 2001 and ending with Yanukovych's depar-\nthese are coups d'\u00e9tat.\nWhat causes irregular leadership\nchange?\nEarly interest in coups began in political science during the\n1984). Inspired by a wide range of coups that took place in\nAfrica, early work focused on the structural determinants\nof coups. Goemans and Marinov (2011) note three distinct\nclasses of arguments for why coups occur: political insta-\nbility resulting from rapid economic modernization\n(Deutsch, 1961); political illegitimacy following lacklus-\nter economic performance and development (McGowan,\nEnsemble forecasting of irregular\nleadership change\nAndreas Beger, Cassy L Dorff and Michael D Ward\n Keywords\nPredictions, coups, rebellions, protests\nDuke University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nMichael D Ward, Duke University, 140 Science Drive, 208 Gross Hall,\nEmail: michael.d.ward@duke.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \n2003); and conditions that increase the likelihood of mili-\ntary intervention in politics (Jenkins and Kposowa, 1990;\nJohnson et al., 1984). These arguments are not disjoint:\nwhile one set informs us about the conditions under which\na coup might occur, for example as a result of certain struc-\ntural conditions like the political system, factionalism, or a\npoliticized military, the other provides traction on when a\ncoup may occur if the structural conditions are ripe.\nThe wave of revolutions that brought down communism\nin Eastern Europe in the early 1990s and the wave of revo-\nlutions during the Arab Spring in 2011 have each led schol-\nars to attempt to explain how these revolutions could have\nso unexpectedly affected monumental change in once \"sta-\nble\" regimes (e.g. Kuran, 1995). Explanations for the sud-\ndenness and apparent unpredictability of such revolutions\nhave focused on tipping points that lead to cascades of pro-\nCoups are very different from revolutions affected by\nmass protests, but they have common explanations: conflict\nbetween the government and dissidents, bad civil\u00admilitary\nrelations, and a distinction between general risk and imme-\ndiate triggers. Empirical work has focused on general risk\nusing static or slow-moving variables such as regime types,\neconomic performance, or military budgets. These might\ntell us whether there is widespread dissatisfaction with a\npolitical system, or troubled civil\u00admilitary relations and a\npoliticized military, but do not tell us much about the spe-\ncific timing of events. Triggering events have received less\nattention, but plausible candidates include indicators sensi-\ntive to escalating confrontations between the military or\nprotesters and the reigning government.\nILCs, like coups, revolutions, and rebellions, are appar-\nently heterogeneous processes. The selectorate theory of\npolitical survival (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2005) hints at\nthe possibility of a general framework. It approaches transi-\ntions from the leader's decision-making perspective in\nwhich coalition partners must be placated in order to stay in\npower. Whether it is just a few groups, or a large slice of the\npopulation, if those who keep the status quo leaders in\npower are unhappy, then there is likely to be a turnover.\nHowever, even this theory does not draw the distinction\nbetween regular and irregular changes.\nIn short, no one has a unified theoretical explanation of\nwhy ILCs occurs.\nImmunity and risk\nIn modeling ILCs, we address the split between structural\nrisk and immediate triggers. Many approaches to modeling\nconflicts and abrupt transitions look at all possible cases,\nand identify variables that can help explain the underlying\ndata. One should not just analyze the cases where there is\nan ILC (known as selecting on the dependent variable). Yet,\nwe need to gain leverage on the timing of events in those\ncountries that are unstable. We use split-population models\nto help with these two issues in studying the irregular and\nabrupt nature of leadership changes.\nSplit-population duration models posit that not all cases\nare at risk of failure. For all practical purposes, countries\nlike Canada are unlikely to experience ILC within our time\nperiod of interest, whereas many countries in Africa and the\nMiddle East have experienced ILCs over the past decades.\nThe important point from a modeling perspective is to con-\nceptually separate at-risk countries from those that are\npractically immune. Once separated, the hazard of an ILC\ncan be better evaluated for all countries.1\nOne advantage of this modeling approach is that it\nallows covariates to have both a long-term and short-term\nimpact, depending on where they enter the model. Variables\nthat enter the immunity equation have a very long-term\nimpact because they change the probability of being at risk\nat all. Variables in the duration equation have a short-term\nimpact that modifies the expected duration until the next\nfailure. We use this approach to estimate the duration of\nregimes over the period from 1955 to the present.\nA strategy for prediction\nRather than engage in testing hypotheses or conducting a\nhorserace of statistical significance (Ward et al., 2010), we\ninstead develop a suite of different models, each capturing\ndifferent insights. We then see how well these perform on\ndata that we have held back and develop a set of weights\nthat tell us how well each model performs in these calibra-\ntion data. Then, we use the calibration weights to help con-\nstruct a probability density that combines all the individual\nmodels in the suite into one single estimate, which is then\nexamined with an additional set of data that we have held\nback for this specific purpose. This general approach has\nproven useful in a number of areas. It is called Ensemble\nBayesian Model Averaging (EBMA; Montgomery et al.,\nonstrations of this kind of ensemble wisdom was a compe-\ntition to guess the weight of an ox at the West of England\nFat Stock and Poultry Exhibition. Galton (1907) famously\ndemonstrated that, while individual entrants were often\nwildly inaccurate, aggregating these into an average\nresulted in a remarkably accurate estimate.\nWe measure ILCs using the Archigos data on political\nleaders, which includes the duration of leadership and\nwhether it starts or stops in an irregular fashion. We have\nupdated these data to the present and they provide the dura-\ntion data we model. These data are combined with our\ncovariates at the monthly level, focusing on the period\nbetween 2001 and the present. Our covariates fall into three\nbroad categories. The first are structural variables such as\nGDP per capita, the Amnesty Political Terror Scale, or\nregime types. These variables tend to be measured at the\ncountry\u00adyear level, and mostly vary between countries, but\nvary less within any particular country. Thus they are more\nBeger et al. 3\nuseful for distinguishing risk sets than predicting the timing\nof particular events.\nThe structural variables include several economic and\nfinancial indicators such as GDP, population, mortality,\nmilitary expenditures, broadband subscribers, cell service\nsubscribers, foreign direct investment and consumer price\nindex (CPI) from the World Development Indicators (World\nBank Group, 2013), the Polity regime variables (Marshall\nand Jaggers, 2002), indicators for the number and power\nrelationships of ethnic groups from the Ethnic Power\nRelations data (Cederman et al., 2009), and the Political\nTerror Scale (Wood and Gibney, 2010), as well as second-\nary measures constructed from the Archigos data, such as\nindicators for leaders who entered irregularly or through\nforeign imposition (Goemans et al., 2009).\nThe behavioral variables are constructed from the\nIntegrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) event\ndata, and record the number of certain types of events in a\ncountry over the course of a month, for example protests\ndirected at the government. The ICEWS event data are\nbased on (machine) coded media reports that are parsed for\nactors, locations, and actions to create event records, using\nthe conflict and mediation event observations (CAMEO)\nontology. We include aggregations of events, particularly\nso-called quad variables that capture verbal and material\nconflict and cooperation within government and between\ngovernment and dissidents. For example, verbal coopera-\ntion includes making positive public statements, appeals, or\nconsultations, while verbal conflict captures reports of\ninvestigations, public demands, or threats. These variables\nchange over time within countries, making them useful for\ntiming the onset of events.\nThe third set of variables includes spatial lags of the\nbehavioral, event-based variables. A spatial lag captures\nneighborhood effects, for example the average level of pro-\ntests in Egypt's neighbors at the time of the uprisings (Ward\nand Gleditsch, 2008). There are different ways to define\nwhat constitutes a country's neighborhood, and we include\nweights constructed on the basis of the four nearest neigh-\nboring countries, the distance between country centroids,\nand Gower distances (Gower, 1971) of country's similarity\non either political, economic, or event measures.\nFrom these variables we construct seven models, each\nconcentrating on substantive themes we believe relevant in\nunderstanding political survival.\nLeader characteristics\nDrawing on the literature on leadership tenure (Acemoglu\nSvolik, 2012), we build a model that captures the leaders'\nindividual characteristics, as well as internal regime coop-\neration. The literature on leadership survival focuses not\nonly on a leader's ability to consolidate power over time,\nbut also considers that as a leader consolidates power, they\nare more likely to create discontent among those who are\nnot politically represented by the regime. The risk equation\nthus includes a count of the months a leader has been in\npower. To capture the legitimacy of a leader and by associa-\ntion his or her government, we include two further varia-\nbles in the risk equation that indicate whether the current\nleader of a state entered power through irregular means or\nby foreign imposition. Leaders who entered through ille-\ngitimate, irregular means might themselves be more likely\nto suffer the same fate. The duration equation uses the\nmaterial behavior of dissidents, whether cooperative or\nconflictual, to capture the timing. We use material rather\nthan verbal actions to model the timing of an ILC against\nillegitimate leaders.\nPublic discontent\nThe public discontent model focuses on verbal interactions\nas well as protests to provide an early warning indicator of\nILCs. We also examine verbal cooperation within govern-\nment, primarily but not exclusively as an indicator of the\nhealth of civil\u00admilitary relations. Since the level of public,\nverbal interactions in a society is related to access to media\nand the ability to voice demands, for the model in the risk\nequation we include per capita measures of Internet users\nand cell subscribers. Many authoritarian governments\nimplement censorship to control the information available\nto citizens. We also include the fraction of excluded popula-\ntion in a country as a control, since minority governments\nfacing a large opposition have strong incentives to display\nunity.\nGlobal instability\nOur third model is loosely based on the main components\nof the Goldstone et al. (2010) model. Using these findings\non what factors drive global instability, we have created a\nmodel loosely based on theirs, but necessarily different\ngiven our different modeling strategy and data resolution.\nIn our version, the partial democracy with factionalism\nindicator did not perform as well as simply including the\nPolity participation of competitiveness variable, which cap-\ntures whether \"alternative preferences for policy and lead-\nership can be pursued in the political arena.\" Echoing the\nGoldstone approach, we include GDP and the percentage of\nthe population excluded from the political process into the\nrisk equation. Then, to predict the timing of ILC, we include\nparticipation competitiveness, a measure of conflict within\nthe four nearest neighbors, as well an indicator of female\nlife expectancy at birth.\nAnti-regime protests\nThis thematic model is entirely focused on protest. Civil\nresistance campaigns are an effective means for achieving\n4 Research and Politics \nleadership change. The literature on both coup-proofing\nresistance campaigns (Chenoweth and Stephan, 2011)\ndescribe a key force behind protest movements: their abil-\nity to influence the military. A pivotal movement in many\ncivil resistance campaigns is the moment when state forces\nstop obeying orders from the head of state, and refuse to\nopenly repress protestors. This model captures the basic\nintuition of this argument by including slower moving\nstructural variables, such as low levels of domestic crises\nand military expenditure, into the risk equation. This model\nis structured by the argument that the least satisfied militar-\nies will be most likely to resist commands to repress. In the\nduration equation we account for protest and conflict in dif-\nferent forms: ethnic-religious violence, rebellion, protest\nevents, and nearby rebellion events in other countries.\nContagion\nThis model captures the concept of conflict contagion. To\nmodel the risk for successful contagion of mass protests or\nother conflict that may lead to an ILC, we include the coun-\ntry's Amnesty International Political Terror Scale value,\nwhich captures overall repressiveness, as well as opposi-\ntion resistance, which counts the number of events con-\nducted by groups associated with armed anti-government\ngroups. The latter largely varies between rather than within\ncountries, and we thus include it as a static variable. These\ntwo variables capture the overall security climate in a coun-\ntry. To further refine the general risk posed in a repressive\nsociety with ongoing terror or political violence, we include\nan indicator of temporally proximate elections. This varia-\nble identifies whether an election will occur in the near\nfuture or has occurred in the near past. Finally, we include\nthe country's population size as an indicator of society's\ninertia and resistance to outside influences.\nHaving specified risk, we use two spatial weights of\nopposition resistance and state repression in neighboring\ncountries to model the timing until contagion, and hence\nincreased chance of ILC, occurs.\nInternal conflict\nThe internal conflict model uses GDP per capita, the prox-\nimity of the next national election, and the level of\nAutocracy in the country as general indicators of risk,\nwhile focusing on intra-governmental conflict and the\nwidespread use of cell technology as duration triggers.\nIntra-governmental tensions, protests to the government,\nand the number of cell phones are taken to interact to influ-\nence the duration of leadership tenure and the likelihood of\nan irregular transfer. First-order components of this inter-\naction also are included in the duration equation, but the\nsecond-order interactions (e.g. the two-way interactions)\nare excluded as they cause instabilities in the likelihood.\nFinancial risks\nThis model assumes that financial instability may unseat\nleaders who are already in a precarious situation. The base-\nline risk is determined by GDP per capita, as a measure of\ngeneral prosperity and the looming presence of the next\nelection, as well as the size of the country as measured by\npopulation. In addition, it includes the Amnesty assessment\nof terrorism (stability) and the degree of anti-government.\nIf a country is in the high risk set, it is the degree of infla-\ntion, as measured by consumer prices, and the health of the\ncountry's international financial reserves (taken from the\nInternational Monetary Fund's (IMF's) International\nFinancial Statistics (IFS)) that affect most directly the dura-\ntion of leadership.\nSummary of modeling strategy\nPrior to statistical estimation, we divide our data into sepa-\nrate partitions. A fourth partition is the data yet to be\nobserved: that is, the future. We use this tripartite division\nto guard against overfitting (see Figure 1).\nEach theme is estimated separately in the training data\nusing a split-population estimator that we have created. The\nseven streams of predictions from these models for the\nFigure 1. Data partitions.\nBeger et al. 5\ncalibration period are examined with the EBMA approach\nto calibrate a set of performance weights. These weights\nand the underlying theme prediction combine to form the\nensemble. Finally, we examine the performance of each\ntheme as well as the ensemble in a final partition of the\ndata, the test partition. In this short presentation, we spare\nthe reader all of these details, and turn to the actual fore-\ncasts made by this approach.2\nAt the request of several readers of this work and in\nhonor of Christopher Achen (2005), we ran a \"garbage can\"\nlogit regression with the 39 covariates from our theme\nmodels. The findings are not surprising. Such models typi-\ncally have the characteristic of over-fitting the in-sample\ndata. Much social science seems to stop there and declare\nvictory. However, such garbage can models almost always\nare terrible at out-of-sample predictions. That is exactly\nwhat we found: our theme models (as well as the ensemble\ncomposite) are about one-third better in terms of recall and\nprecision. We could not estimate a similar all-in split-\nduration model due to convergence issues, but a version\nthat includes the 13 covariates from the two models that\nreceive the largest weights in the ensemble, contagion and\ninternal conflict, also performs worse out of sample. Table\n1 illustrates this fit of the two baseline models versus our\nensemble model.\nExamining predicted change\nUsing the ensemble model and data from March 2014 we\ncreate forecasts for the probability of ILC over the period\nfrom April to September 2014. We aggregate the monthly\nforecasts produced by this model to an overall probability\nof ILC anytime during this time period, and Table 2 shows\nthe 10 highest forecasts that result.3\nThese predictions were made in March 2014.\nProbabilities are not certainties. For every 20 estimates that\nthere is a 0.05 chance of rain; for a properly calibrated\nmodel, one should expect it to rain at least once. ILCs are\nvery rare events. Our top five predictions include Ukraine,\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Yemen, Egypt, and Thailand.\nUkraine lost the Crimea to Russia this spring, but the pro-\ntests in the winter of 2013 continued into the new year and\nviolent protests occurred in the middle of February 2014\nthat were in part a response to the so-called Anti-Protest\nlaws enacted in the previous month. By the end of February,\nParliament essentially ousted the President and scheduled a\nMay 25 election. This created a succession crisis in which\nthe deposed president, Yanukovich, and his supporters in\nRussia began to create a larger conflict in Ukraine. Russian\ninvolvement spawned further local conflict within Ukraine.\nContinuing conflict within the government and separatist\nactivities in the east, in combination with a new govern-\nment, place Ukraine at the top of our model predictions.\nPoroshenko won the May 2014 elections, but several thou-\nsand have been killed and many more have fled the violence\nin Eastern and Southern Ukraine.\nBosnia and Herzegovina has been the site of substantial\nand widespread anti-government protests in early 2014, the\nso-called Bosnian Spring. These were organized in large\npart because of the frailty of the economy, the high level of\nunemployment, and the non-payment of pensions. Prime\nMinister Vjekoslav Bevanda has minimized the protests.\nHowever, as the leader of an increasingly weak central gov-\nernment, the greatest instability may reside in the locally\ngoverned regions.\nYemen is the site of protests accompanied by the pres-\nence of a very powerful Al-Qaeda army. That, alongside a\nset of rulers widely reported to be corrupt, creates an unsta-\nble situation. Yemen is in the throes of (another) reorgani-\nzation in which central authority seems likely to devolve to\nregional ruling coalitions.\nEgypt sees an outbreak of protests and violence every\nyear in February to celebrate the resignation of Mubarak\nand the start of the so-called revolution in the early spring\ncoup d'\u00e9tat that displaced Morsi. In mid-2013 Mansour\nwas appointed as acting president. In early 2014 a new con-\nstitution was overwhelmingly ratified by Egyptian voters,\neven though roughly two-thirds of the potential voters\navoided participating. In May 2014, a presidential election\nwas won by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian commander-\nin-chief. Tension remains high and the legitimacy and pop-\nularity of the current regime is tenuous, at best.\nTable 1. Comparing the ensemble model to two simple\nbaseline approaches.\nIn-sample Out-of-sample\nF: harmonic mean of precision/recall; AUC: area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve.\nTable 2. Top 10 forecasts for irregular leadership change\nbetween April and September 2014 (six months) using March\nCountry Probability\n6 Research and Politics \nThailand has been a puzzling cauldron of political con-\nflict for over a decade. Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown\nby a coup d'\u00e9tat in the fall of 2006, and the resulting junta\ninstituted martial law and forbade many political activities\nuntil mid-2007. Things continued to be contentious and\nviolent, but by mid-2011 things had calmed down and\nYingluck Shinawatra handily won the election. Toward the\nend of 2013, protests heated up quite a bit as did demands\nfor the resignation of Yingluck. Scheduled elections were\nnot held in 2014, as the listing of candidates outraged anti-\ngovernment forces. As this was written, on May 7, the\n(Supreme) Constitutional court ruled that Yingluck had\nabused power and was to be removed from the Prime\nMinistership. It is unclear how this will turn out, except to\nnote that this will constitute another ILC in mid-2014.\nModel fit statistics\nAny probabilistic model for ILCs will have a tradeoff\nbetween false positives and false negatives. In a random\nguess this tradeoff is even, leading to the receiver operat-\ning characteristic (ROC) curve shown in red in Figure 2.\nAny useful model should exceed it. The ROC curves for\nthe ensemble \u00ad in-sample (dashed) and out-of-sample\n(solid) \u00ad show good fit with areas under the curve (AUCs)\nannualize our predictions for comparison with work at the\ncountry\u00adyear.\nWith infrequent events such as ILCs it also makes sense\nto evaluate recall and precision. Recall is the fraction of\nevents accurately predicted by a model, and precision is\nhow many positive predictions turn out to be actual events,\nor how believable the predictions are. As before, there is a\ntradeoff between the two depending on the cutoff one\nchooses for separating probabilistic predictions to 0/1 val-\nues. The ensemble obtains a recall of 0.5 with a precision of\nannualized data. With data as sparse as ours, a model needs\nto perform extremely well by conventional standards in\norder to make predictions we can take at face value.\nConclusion\nWe used new, temporally disaggregated data that included\nbehavioral variables derived from event data. We also\nemployed split-population duration and ensemble mode-\nling approaches to examine ILCs over the period from 1955\nto the present. Each of these aspects is novel in the study of\nleadership change. In so doing we also developed a suite of\nnew empirical models that were measured monthly. In\naddition, we then combined the forecasts of each of these\nempirical models using EBMA to produce a single proba-\nbility estimate that benefits from the so-called \"wisdom of\nthe crowds.\" Along the way, we updated the dependent\nvariable over the past two and a half years.\nThe suite of models we developed is examined in his-\ntorical training data and was evaluated in test data that were\nnot used in the initial data construction. In both contexts,\nthe models are accurate and well calibrated. Finally, we use\na weighted ensemble combination of these models to pro-\nduce six-month forecasts of the conditional hazard over the\ndictions are discussed above, but in summary seem plausi-\nble. Indeed, two of the top 10 forecasts are Ukraine and\nThailand, both currently in the throes of transition crises.\nIn our attempt to forecast ILCs, we have created a com-\nplex framework that breaks with many conventions in pre-\nvious scholarship. This opens us to many criticisms, such as\nquestions about the rigor of the thematic models in our\nsuite, or the utility of the ILC concept. We tried to root the\nmodels in themes notable in the literature on regime change.\nHowever, our approach is inherently modular and open to\nthe inclusion of other models with the ensemble as arbiter\nof their usefulness in prediction. This study may serve as a\nfoundation for future inquiry and to encourage scholars to\nconduct similar investigations at the country\u00admonth level.\nMany months pass in each country without an ILC. They\nare rare. Our modeling approach has the goal to accurately\nforecast ILCs, and the rarity of these events has led to the\nnovel aspects we have presented here. Still, we are looking\nfor needles in a haystack. Even our 10 highest predictions\nhave low probabilities of ILC. However, someone once\nsaid, \"reality is a low probability event.\"\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Political Instability Task Force\n(PITF).
