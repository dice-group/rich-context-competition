On the one hand, inflation differentials within the euro area\ncould also reflect price level convergence movements, and thus would represent an\ninnocuous convergence of competitiveness towards a PPP-type equilibrium.

Introduction: Inflation differentials within EMU and international\nprice competitiveness\nEconomic policymakers rarely pay much attention to inflation differentials\nbetween regions that share a common currency. The European Monetary Union (EMU),\nhowever, represents a notable exception to this general observation. The annual\ninflation rates of many EMU member countries, measured by the harmonised index of\nconsumer prices (HICP), have deviated by more than half a percentage point annually\nfrom the EMU average in most years since the introduction of the euro in 1999. In some\ncases, the differential to the average exceeded two percentage points (see ECB, 2005b).\nAt first sight, inflation differentials of this magnitude may not appear to be a matter of\nconcern. Indeed, the European Central Bank emphasises that, at the start of the nineties,\ninflation differentials among current EMU members were much more pronounced and\nthat they have decreased continuously over the following decade. Moreover, it is shown\nthat the dispersion of annual inflation in the euro area since 1999 hardly differs from\nthat of 14 US metropolitan statistical areas for the same period.\nThe ECB (2003b), however, points out that EMU inflation dispersion is\ncontinuously twice as large as that of corresponding measures for German regions,\nSpanish regions or Italian cities. It suggests that larger geographical distances and a\nlower degree of policy decentralisation may be the reasons for the higher inflation\ndispersion in the United States and the euro area compared with EMU member\ncountries. As is highlighted in ECB (2005b), there is, however, also a fundamental\ndifference between inflation differentials within the euro area and those within the\n* The paper represents the author's personal opinions and does not necessarily reflect the views of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank.

EMU countries' inflation deviations from the euro-area average are much\nmore persistent than those of US metropolitan statistical areas compared with the US\naverage. For the first six years of monetary union, a majority of EMU member states\nbelonged either to the group of countries whose annual inflation rates were continuously\nabove the EMU average or to the group of countries whose inflation rates were\ncontinuously below.\nIn the economic policy debate, the major concern associated with persistent\ninflation differentials is that firms from high inflation countries may accumulate an\nincreasing competitive disadvantage compared with their competitors from EMU\npartner countries with persistently lower inflation rates. Relatively high rates of\ninflation may reflect a rise in the prices of domestic factors that are used in the\nproduction of output which is traded in an internationally competitive environment. If\nnot offset by a corresponding increase in productivity, domestic competitiveness suffers\ninasmuch as the average profitability of domestic firms falls relative to those abroad,\nand the trade balance tends ceteris paribus to deteriorate.1 In a monetary union, neither\nnational monetary policy nor the exchange rate can be used as a policy instrument to\nreduce the disparities. The economic adjustment process, therefore, will probably be\nslow and painful.\nInflation differentials, however, may be the consequence of creating the common\ncurrency area. After all, EMU founders hoped that the common currency would increase\nprice transparency across euro-area countries, leading to rising competition and, finally,\nto convergence towards a highly competitive price level of internationally tradable\nInflation differentials of this sort, which reflect price convergence movements, should \u00ad\ninstead of being seen as detrimental \u00ad rather be classified as being beneficial for all\nEMU countries concerned.\n1 The relationship between international competitiveness and average profitability is highlighted and\n(1996) holds a much more critical view, which is, to be sure, based on models of a frictionless world\nwithout adjustment costs, unemployment or even trade imbalances. His main point, however, to warn\nagainst using the term competitiveness in a mercantilist sense (for example, by considering foreign\noutput growth or a deterioration in the trade balance as a threat to domestic welfare, or as reflected by\nthe tendency to react to such developments with the imposition of trade restrictions) is, of course,\nworth being emphasized.\nGoldberg/Verboven (2005) confirm the existence of price level convergence in Europe\nin the 1990s. Their evidence, however, does mainly apply to the period before the\nintroduction of the euro. Focussing in contrast on price developments in EMU since its\ninception, Engel/Rogers (2004) found no evidence of price convergence in an analysis\nof Economist Intelligence Unit data, neither in general nor a specific convergence\nmovement due to the introduction of the euro. Similar results are reported by Lutz\n(2004), who investigates four alternative datasets of disaggregated prices. Allington et\nal (2005), by contrast, assert that these conclusions were premature and, using a broad\nEurostat dataset, claim to have found robust evidence for price convergence in EMU\nwhich was triggered by the introduction of the euro.\nA second reason for qualifying the conventional negative assessment of inflation\ndifferentials within the euro area is the possibility that they might not be associated with\na loss of competitiveness of the high inflation countries' economies. The comparatively\nhigh inflation could have been caused by an asymmetric increase in productivity in the\nrespective economy and thus represent a (Balassa-Samuelson type) equilibrium\nphenomenon. According to the estimations of the German Council of Economic Experts\nEMU inflation differentials are due to Balassa-Samuelson effects. Honohan/Lane's\nperiod the nominal depreciation of the euro against the US dollar affected national\ninflation rates within the euro area heterogeneously, raising inflation especially in those\ncountries which trade heavily with non-EMU partners. Arnold/Verhoef (2004),\nhowever, demonstrate that their results no longer hold either if lagged inflation is added\nas regressor or as soon as the outlier Ireland is eliminated from the panel.\nevolution of price competitiveness within EMU is measured as the cumulative change\nin a respective real effective exchange rate which, in a monetary union, boils down to a\nweighted average of inflation differentials. While this measure clearly has its merits, the\nfirst part of the discussion so far has shown that movements in such an indicator should\nbe qualified as long as they are due to price level convergence. They would then\nrepresent a convergence of competitiveness out of a state of disequilibrium in the base\nperiod towards a PPP-type equilibrium level. The second part of the discussion stressed\nthat EMU inflation differentials may, to a degree, themselves represent equilibrium\nphenomena which were not detrimental for the competitiveness of the high inflation\neconomies. Both strands of thought imply that an assessment of trends in price\ncompetitiveness requires a relevant equilibrium concept for the respective real exchange\nrate.\nThe present paper's main contribution consists in the use of three alternative,\nsimple equilibrium concepts of the real exchange rate to determine for each of the EMU\neconomies whether its international price competitiveness improved or deteriorated\nsince monetary union was created in 1999. Focus is especially placed on whether the\ncomputed change in competitiveness represents divergence from the respective\nequilibrium and is, therefore, a genuine matter for concern. It is found that, regardless of\nthe equilibrium concept used, Germany enjoyed a remarkable increase in\ncompetitiveness against its trading partners within the euro area while Italy, Portugal,\nSpain, Ireland and Luxembourg lost price competitiveness. Results concerning\ncompetitiveness convergence with (or divergence from) its equilibrium value, however,\nturn out to depend decisively on the equilibrium concept used.\nSection 2 presents three equilibrium concepts for the real exchange rate and shows\nhow they will be used to assess the international price competitiveness of an economy.\nResults for the three approaches are shown and discussed in section 3. Section 4\nconcludes the analysis.\n2. Three simple concepts of equilibrium exchange rates\nFor the assessment of euro-area countries' international price competitiveness,\nrelative purchasing power parity (PPP), absolute PPP and a Balassa (1964) and\nSamuelson (1964) type model have been used as alternative equilibrium concepts.\nThese three concepts have been chosen especially because of their simplicity. More\ncomplex models are not only far more difficult to implement, they may also be\nunsuitable to yield measures of competitiveness and equilibrium values that are\ncomparable across all EMU countries. Moreover, all the approaches used in the present\nstudy benefit from being able to provide a theoretically well-founded equilibrium value\nwhich may be much more appealing to policymakers as a normative guideline than, for\ninstance, the commonly used but rather eclectic BEER approaches (see eg MacDonald,\ngenerally seen as providing particularly long-term equilibrium values which may be the\nmost relevant given that the only adjustment variables in a currency union, relative\nprices, move rather slowly.\nRelative purchasing power parity claims that real exchange rates should be mean\nreverting in the long-run. Since the nominal exchange rate is irreversibly fixed in a\nmonetary union, this implies that the relative price level between the domestic and the\nforeign economy should converge to some constant value. In a PPP model, changes in\nthe real exchange rate indicate changes in competitiveness and, in a monetary union, a\nhigh-inflation economy loses competitiveness. The real exchange rate can thus be used\ndirectly as a competitiveness indicator.\nWhile the relative PPP model thus easily allows an assessment of the direction\nand the magnitude of a change in competitiveness, it is more difficult to use to assess\nwhether such a change represents a convergence movement and, therefore, is desired, or\nwhether some high-inflation economies accumulate potentially highly persistent\ncompetitive disadvantages. Since, in a relative PPP model, price indices are used to\ncompute real exchange rates, the calculated relative price level arbitrarily depends on\nthe normalisation of the index. In other words, the real exchange rate converges to some\nmean in a relative PPP model but the model is silent on the value of the mean.\nThe theoretical gap may, however, be closed empirically. If the relative PPP\nhypothesis is confirmed statistically, a long-term average of the real exchange rate\nshould approximate the mean to which the real exchange rate reverts. The empirical\nvalidity of relative PPP has in fact been such a prominent issue in recent research that\nnumerous survey studies have been published, for example Froot/Rogoff (1995), Rogoff\nconclude that relative PPP holds in the long run, and even opponents may admit that\nrelative PPP is at least a comparatively good approximation of reality. The long-term\naverage of a real exchange rate may, therefore, be interpretable as a rough indication of\nits equilibrium value.\nFor the analysis, real effective exchange rates as calculated by the Deutsche\nBundesbank are used because price competitiveness should, of course, be defined\nmultilaterally, ie against a group of (EMU) partner countries. They are computed as\ngeometric trade-weighted averages of bilateral rates against all the trading partners in\nFor the calculation of these competitiveness indicators, different types of price\nand cost indices have been used. The appropriateness of different indices in reflecting\nprice competitiveness of an economy has been discussed inter alia in Deutsche\nstudies, a rather broadly defined price index such as the price deflator of total sales\nshould be the most suitable since such indicators are the only ones that reflect price\ndifferentials in intermediate inputs that make up a significant part of differences in price\ncompetitiveness. As an alternative to the price deflator of total sales, competitiveness\nindicators based on consumer price indices as well as those based on unit labour costs in\nthe enterprise sector have been used in the present study, bearing in mind that\nmeasurement problems should be much more prevalent in unit labour cost indices than\nquarterly frequency. The cost index-based variables differ by starting in 1976:3.\nBearing in mind the possible limitations of their adequacy as expressed in\ncountry panels of real effective exchange rates have been performed. Real exchange\nrates are often found to be correlated (cf O'Connell, 1998, for example), a property\nwhich will obviously also pertain to real effective exchange rates which are just\nweighted averages of the former. Therefore, it is advisable to apply second generation\npanel unit root tests in the sense of Breitung/Pesaran (2005) which take heterogeneous\ncross-sectional correlations into account. More specifically, Harvey/Bates' (2002)\n2 The computation methodology follows Buldorini et al (2002).\n3 According to Deutsche Bundesbank (1998, 2004), the occasionally proposed real effective exchange\nrates based on unit labour costs in the manufacturing sector are less suitable as competitiveness\nindicators.\nmultivariate homogeneous Dickey-Fuller (MHDF) test and Breitung/Das' (2005) and\nJ\u00f6nsson's (2005) panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) test are used. Denoting it\nz\n~ as\nbeing a pre-whitened series, each of which is computed from the original series zit\nusing\na procedure suggested by Breitung/Das (2005) in order to eliminate possible constant\nterms and short-run dynamics, the MHDF t statistic is calculated as\n \n\n \n\n\n=\n+\n=\n-\n-\n-\n+\n=\n-\n-\nT\nt\nt\nt\nT\nt\nt\nt\ngls\nz\nz\nz\nz\nt\nl\nl\n~\n^\n~\n~\n^\n~\n\n\nand the PCSE t statistic as\n \n\n \n\n=\n+\n=\n-\n-\n+\n=\n-\nT\nt\nt\nt\nT\nt\nt\nt\nrob\nz\nz\nz\nz\nt\nl\nl\n~\n^\n~\n~\n~\n\nwhere ]\n~\n,...,\n~\n,\n~\n[\n~\n\n=\nNt\nt\nt\nt\nz\nz\nz\nz , ]\n~\n,...,\n~\n,\n~\n[\n~\n\n=\nNt\nt\nt\nt\nz\nz\nz\nz \n\n\n , N is the number of cross-\nsectional units in the panel,  is the covariance matrix of the system, and  is the\nnumber of lags used in the pre-whitening procedure. Harvey/Bates (2002) and\nBreitung/Das (2005), respectively, provide critical values.\nResults are shown in the upper part of Table 1 for panels containing series for\neach of the 12 EMU members present since the accession of Greece, N = 12, except in\nthe case of the real effective exchange rates based on unit labour costs in the enterprise\nsector where N = 10 because no data were available for Greece and Luxembourg. There\nis strong evidence for the real effective exchange rate based on ULCs to be stationary\nand reasonable evidence for CPI-based series. Real effective exchange rates based on\ndeflators of total sales, however, appear rather to be non-stationary. The mixed and\nsomewhat inconclusive results adequately reflect the discussion on the validity of\nrelative PPP in the post-Bretton Woods era, although, in general, panel unit root tests\nare often more supportive of relative PPP, O'Connell (1998) being one of the few\nexceptions. In spite of the large differences with respect to the panel unit root test results\non stationarity, it will be shown that the assessment of competitiveness levels and trends\nis hardly affected by the choice of the underlying price or cost index.\nLong-term averages of the series have been formed over the entire observation\nperiod and thus cover the required long-term span of data. Deutsche Bundesbank (2004)\nfinds that a reduction in the length of the period hardly affects the value of the long-term\naverage of German price competitiveness.\nIt is common knowledge that it would be very hard to find any empirical evidence\nin favour of absolute purchasing power parity. Generally, even developed countries'\nreal exchange rates show deviations from absolute PPP values that can last for decades.\nSuch long-run deviations from absolute PPP are usually explained by structural and\ninstitutional impediments to adjustment such as regulations, taxes, transport costs or\ntariffs. These factors, however, usually affect the competitiveness of an economy. If\nproduction is expensive because of high real estate prices, decrepit infrastructure, an\ninsufficient education system or high taxes, then competitiveness is low. Absolute PPP\nmay, therefore, be seen as a very long-term normative concept. In any case, absolute\nPPP is probably the superior macroeconomic concept to investigate whether inflation\ndifferentials in EMU are reflections of price level convergence.\nAs with relative PPP, the real exchange rate can be used as a competitiveness\nindicator. As opposed to relative PPP, absolute PPP requires the real exchange rate to be\ncalculated with relative price levels. Price indices are insufficient. Relative price levels\ncan be computed from \"purchasing power parities\", which are provided by the\nEuropean Commission in their annual macro-economic database (AMECO). The term\n\"purchasing power parity\" indicates the amount of national currency which is required\nfor the purchase of that unit of a basket of goods in the domestic country which costs\none currency unit in the base country. The common basket of goods consists of several\nthousand tradable and non-tradable products whose prices are collected by national\nstatistical institutes. Annual data starting from 1960 are available.\nThe price level in country j relative to country i at time t, Pi,j,t\nis computed as\nt\nj\ni\nt\nj\ni\nt\nj\ni W\nK\nP\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nwhere Ki,j,t\ndenotes the \"purchasing power parity\" of country j against country i\nand Wi,j,t\nthe corresponding nominal exchange rate between these two countries.4 The\ntrade weights that have already been used for the computation of real effective exchange\nrates in the relative PPP framework, gi,j\n, have been employed to calculate the effective\nrelative price level of country i against its 11 euro-area trading partners, Pi,t\n, as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= \n=\n,\n,\n,\n,\n)\n(\n/\nj\ng\nt\nj\ni\nt\ni\nj\ni\nP\n,\n=\n\n=\nj\nj\ni\nA value of Pi,t\nlarger than 1 implies that the price level in country i is higher than\nthe trade-weighted average price level of its EMU trading partners if all prices are\nexpressed in a common currency. This can be interpreted as country i having a\ncompetitive disadvantage in an absolute PPP framework, where long-term equilibrium\nwould require Pi,t\n2.3 The productivity approach\nAn important advantage of measures of international price competitiveness based\non absolute PPP is that relative price levels allow for an excellent comparability across\ncountries. They may, however, be criticised as being less relevant if domestic prices of\ninternationally non-tradable goods can deviate permanently and significantly from those\nabroad without triggering adjustment processes. In this context, reference is often made\nto the productivity approach which goes back to Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964)\nand is usually discussed in a model like that of Froot/Rogoff (1995). Balassa and\nSamuelson suggest that the relative price level should be higher in those countries\nwhich display a higher level of productivity. The productivity approach implies that real\nexchange rate movements do not necessarily reflect changes in international price\ncompetitiveness because they could have been caused by asymmetric changes in\nproductivity. Such real exchange rate movements would represent equilibrium\nphenomena unrelated to competitiveness issues.\n4 Nominal exchange rate movements are relevant for the observation period before the euro was\nThe evidence on Balassa-Samuelson effects in developed countries is mixed (see\neg Canzoneri et al, 1999, or DeLoach, 2001). However, one might suspect that the\nsuccessful catch-up process of countries like Ireland or Spain over the past decades may\nhave resulted in Balassa-Samuelson effects and in corresponding real appreciation\ntendencies. If this were the case, theories like absolute or relative PPP, which suggest a\nconstant equilibrium real exchange rate, would tend to rate the present international\nprice competitiveness of these countries too low.\nBalassa-Samuelson effects can be eliminated by regressing the real exchange rate\non relative productivity. It should be stressed that the purpose of such a regression in the\npresent context is not to give a comprehensive explanation of inflation differentials in\nEMU. Instead, the aim is to adjust the real exchange rates' evolution for movements\nwhich do not represent changes in price competitiveness within the framework of the\nproductivity approach.\nThe choice of the productivity variable has been governed by data availability.\nThree alternative variables have been considered: nominal GDP per person employed\nmeasured in purchasing power parities, nominal GDP per head of population measured\nin purchasing power parities and real GDP per hour worked. The first two measures are\nprovided by the AMECO database, the third one is available from the Groningen\nexcept in the case of GDP per hour, where observations span the 1968-2004 period.\nAmong the three productivity measures, real GDP per hour may be the closest to the\nproductivity concept of the theoretical approach. This variable, however, suffers from\nbeing the only one in which 2002 US dollars (instead of purchasing power parities) are\nused to convert national values into a common currency. This may negatively affect\ninternational comparability. Productivity series, denoted by X, are normalised on a\ncommon non-EMU base country c which yields measures of relative productivity5\n5 The normalisation is associated with an additional benefit: two of the productivity variables are\nexpressed in terms of nominal GDP in purchasing power parities while the productivity approach\nactually requires real values in purchasing power parities. The conversion into purchasing power\nparities will not only eliminate possible nominal exchange rate movements but also the effect of\ninflation differentials on the productivity measures. Any remaining average inflation across countries\nwill be cancelled out in the normalisation process.\nt\nc\nt\ni\nt\nc\ni X\nX\nX\n,\n,\n,\n,\nRelative price levels are rebased on the same country c,\nt\nj\nc\nt\nj\ni\nt\nc\ni P\nP\nP\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nDenoting logged values in lower case letters, the effect of relative productivity on\nrelative price levels has been estimated in a panel approach based on the equation\nt\nc\ni\nt\nc\ni\nt\nt\nc\ni\nx\np\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n +\n\n+\nNote that equation (7) includes fixed time effects but not fixed country effects for\nthe individual series of the panel. This is not only in line with the numerous cross\nsection studies on the productivity approach (a cross-section version of (7) had already\nbeen estimated by Balassa, 1964),6 it is also necessary to maintain the relationship\nbetween the relative price level of a country and its relative productivity level.7 The\nstandard cross-section fixed effects approach could yield results on the effect of\nproductivity changes on real exchange rate movements but not on the corresponding\nlevels. The use of time dummies in equation (7), finally, eliminates the effect of\n(possibly unrepresentative) individual movements of the base country on the estimation\n6 A cross-section version of (7) had already been estimated by Balassa (1964). To be sure, the theoretical\nmodel assumes an increase in total factor productivity in the tradables sector in order to yield the\nproposed positive value for  in (7). Nevertheless, empirical studies regularly use measures of\nproductivity for the total economy since technological progress is assumed to be concentrated in the\ntradables sector. In view of the ICT revolution, one might doubt such an assumption. However, with\nthe technological advances in the ICT sector, its products and services have increasingly become\ninternationally tradable. Moreover, since the share of capital is obviously lower in the non-tradables\nsector,  may even be positive if technological progress is smaller in the tradables sector than in the\nnon-tradables sector; cf equation (3.7) in Froot/Rogoff (1995).\n7 Some institutional conditions, however, may result in deviations of relative price levels from the values\ndetermined by productivity levels even in equilibrium. In the case of EMU countries, this pertains in\nparticular to the differing value added tax (VAT) rates which affect relative price levels (but not\nrelative productivity) because the destination principle is applied for intra-euro-area trade. The ensuing\ndifferences in price levels, however, are probably rather small. Anyway, they could be eliminated by\nfixed effects only if the VAT rates had been kept constant in all EMU countries over the last three to\nfive decades, which has clearly not been the case.\nresults because they should not play any role in the assessment of competitiveness\nwithin the euro area. More generally, the time dummies capture homogeneous cross-\ncorrelations in the panel.\nThe second line of Table 2 presents estimates of  obtained with a static fixed\ntime effects approach. The estimated coefficients turn out to be remarkably independent\nof the productivity variable used. According to the estimated value of , a relative\nproductivity level of country i being one percent greater than that of country j is\nreflected on average in a 0.55 to 0.59 percent higher value of the relative price level.\nThe Durbin Watson statistics, however, suggest that the residuals are highly positively\nautocorrelated and that the estimated variances of  are not reliable. Nevertheless, if\nrelative productivity and relative price levels are integrated and cointegrated, the static\nestimators are superconsistent and thus valid.\nSecond-generation panel unit root tests (MHDF test and PCSE test) are used to\ncheck whether the first of these conditions is fulfilled. The lower part of Table 1 shows\nthat non-stationarity of relative productivity levels can generally not be rejected. For\nrelative price levels, it is found that test results depend on the choice of the num\u00e9raire\ncountry, a result which is typically found in real exchange rates (cf Coakley/Fuertes,\ngenerally rejects the null of non-cointegration between relative productivity and relative\nprice levels at a five percent significance level, regardless of which test statistic, which\nnum\u00e9raire country and which productivity variable is used. The obvious stationarity of\nthe residuals implies that the rejection of non-stationarity in one of the relative price\nlevel panels must have been erroneous.9 A further implication is the validity of the\nstatically estimated  coefficients.\nIn order to corroborate these results, on the one hand, and to obtain valid estimates\nof the variances, on the other, equation (7) has been re-estimated in a dynamic setting.\nTwo alternative panel cointegration estimation methods are used, Pedroni's (1996)\n8 The four DF and the ADF panel cointegration test statistics of Kao (1999) have been used as well as\n9 This could be due to biases which typically arise in real exchange rate series, as suggested by\nfully-modified OLS (FMOLS) and the dynamic OLS (DOLS) estimator suggested by\nKao/Chiang (2000). The common cross-section intercept and fixed time effect setting of\nthe static approach is retained. In the DOLS specification, two leads and two lags are\nemployed. As might have been expected given the panel cointegration test results, all\nthe dynamically estimated  coefficients shown in Table 2 deviate only very slightly\n(and insignificantly) from those obtained in the static estimation. The t-values imply\nthat the  coefficients are statistically significant.\nThe residuals of equation (7) may be interpreted as (logged) deviations of the\nrelative price level from the value which is fundamentally justified by the corresponding\nrelative productivity level. Therefore, they are Balassa-Samuelson type competitiveness\nindicators. As usual, they are combined into an effective indicator,\n[ ]\n\n=\n=\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n)\n^\nexp(\n)\n^\nexp(\n^\nj\ng\nt\nc\nj\nt\nc\ni\nt\ni\nj\ni\n\n\n3. Results on price competitiveness within the euro area\n3.1 Competitiveness according to the concept of relative PPP\nTable 3 presents the results obtained by applying the concept of relative PPP.\nColumns (2) to (4) are concerned with the accumulated change in competitiveness since\nthe start of EMU in January 1999. In a PPP framework, such a change in\ncompetitiveness is entirely due to inflation differentials in a monetary union. The\nmovements of competitiveness based on consumer price indices as shown in column (4)\ncorrespond conceptually more or less with those in the middle column of Lane's (2006)\nTable 3, in line with the observations by the ECB (2005b), corroborates the view\nthat, in spite of their rather small size in a given year, the persistence of inflation\ndifferentials has led to remarkable changes in competitiveness in the euro area within\n10 They refer, however, to a slightly different observation period. Moreover, the ECB's (2007) figures are\nnot confined to intra-EMU trade partners. Nevertheless, the emerging competitiveness trends are\ngenerally very similar.\njust seven years, which in some cases can reach double-digit percentage rates. For the\nmajority of countries, the computed direction of the accumulated change in\ncompetitiveness is robust with respect to the choice of the price or cost index.\nIt turns out that it is especially Germany which, according to all measures, has\nbeen able to improve significantly on its price competitiveness. According to some\nmeasures, this may also apply to Austria, Finland and France, albeit to a much lower\ndegree. Price competitiveness in all of the other EMU countries has been deteriorating\nmore or less. To some degree, this reflects the fact that Germany is the most important\ntrading partner for most euro-area economies. Thus German competitiveness receives a\nhigh weight in the calculation of their respective real effective exchange rates.11\nFrom columns (5) to (7) it can be seen that today's price competitiveness exceeds\nits long-term average especially in Finland and Germany but also in France. Again, only\nin a minority of cases, competitiveness measures based on different price or cost indices\ndisplay different directions of deviation from the long-term average. Austria, Belgium,\nIreland, and the Netherlands belong to this group of countries.12 Indicators based on the\nconcept of relative PPP unanimously judge the competitiveness of Greece, Italy,\nLuxembourg, Portugal and Spain as rather low.\nThe fact that countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain, which were catching up\nover the past decades, are rated as being rather uncompetitive if a relative PPP measure\n11 Similar results are reported in Felettigh et al (2006). Farina (2001) is one of the few economists who\nwarned against possible persistent inflation differentials within the emerging EMU and its\nconsequences for national competitiveness developments. Interestingly, however, he predicted high\ninflation and a loss in competitiveness for Germany and low inflation and the concomitant\ncompetitiveness gains for EMU's \"periphery\", eg for Italy.\n12 For the Irish economy, the deviation of unit labour cost-based from other indicators of competitiveness\nis particularly pronounced. Taking note of the fact that the denominator of unit labour costs is labour\nproductivity, this is probably due to a severe upward bias in the measurement of Irish labour\nproductivity, which is identified by Honohan/Walsh (2002). They reveal that the high Irish labour\nproductivity figures can be traced back to a small number of multinational corporations which\napparently took advantage of low taxes and standard transfer pricing rules to locate \" ... a very high\nfraction of the enterprise's global profits in Ireland\" (Honohan/Walsh, 2002, p 40).\nFor the Italian economy, Gros (2007) presumes that unit labour cost-based indicators overstate the loss\nof competitiveness. He argues that Italian productivity growth has been higher than recorded because\nthe recent increase in measured Italian employment is largely due to the regularisation of formerly\ninformal work while Italian output already contained a large allowance for the underground economy.\nThe change in price-based measures of competitiveness shown in columns (2) and (4), however, is\nunaffected by such measurement problems, and one of them displays a loss of Italian\ncompetitiveness which is comparable to the unit labour cost-based figure.\nAny mismeasurement of productivity would, of course, also affect indicators of price competitiveness\nbased on the productivity approach.\nis applied, may indicate that a long-term average might fail to take sufficient account of\nthe low price levels which prevailed in these countries in earlier years. This points to the\nrelevance of the absolute PPP concept and the productivity approach for assessing price\ncompetitiveness.\nTurning to the fundamental question of whether the intra-EMU movements in\ncompetitiveness represent a convergence process and thus should not be regarded as\nproblematic, Table 3 conveys a sobering picture. Apart from Austria, Belgium and the\nNetherlands, where the corresponding results are rather mixed, competitiveness of all\ncountries must be classified as diverging from the equilibrium value provided by\nrelative PPP. This is illustrated vividly in Figure 1 which depicts the unweighted\ncoefficient of variation of EMU countries' price competitiveness. Instead of\ndiminishing, the dispersion of price competitiveness increased obviously from a value\nFrom a long-run perspective, the dispersion of price competitiveness was low at the\nstart of monetary union and thus the time to introduce the euro appeared well chosen.\nToday, on the contrary, competitiveness dispersion is high even for pre-EMU standards.\n3.2 Competitiveness according to the concept of absolute PPP\nTable 4 displays the results obtained when applying the concept of absolute PPP.\nColumn (2) reveals a pattern of movements in competitiveness similar to that found\nusing the concept of relative PPP. Again, it is in particular Germany which has been\nable to improve its competitiveness relative to its trading partners since the introduction\nof the euro. A group of countries comprising Austria, Belgium, Finland and France has\nnot been subject of any significant change in competitiveness within this period. All\nother EMU countries have suffered from a loss of competitiveness, a tendency which\napplies especially to Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal.\nContrary to the quite similar assessment of recent movements in competitiveness,\nindicators based on absolute PPP judge the current level of EMU countries'\ncompetitiveness quite differently than indicators based on relative PPP. Column (3) of\nTable 4 shows that Ireland, Luxembourg, Germany and Finland have rather low levels\nof competitiveness in the sense that relative price levels in these countries are distinctly\nhigher than in their trading partner countries within the euro area. While the price\ncompetitiveness of Austria, Belgium, France and the Netherlands is rather close to its\nequilibrium absolute PPP level, Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy still benefit from a\nrelatively low price level.\nIt is striking that these countries are exactly those whose current competitiveness\nis assessed as being rather unsatisfactory when relative PPP measures are applied. For\nthe past decades, Greece and Portugal, being typical catch-up countries within the euro\narea, have had low price levels which have been increased only slightly by the recent\ncomparatively modest losses in competitiveness. In Italy and Spain, relative price levels\nstarted rising much earlier, in the late 1970s. This development was reversed, however,\nin the first half of the 1990s when both the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta\ndepreciated significantly in the turmoil of the European ERM I crisis. Although\nrelatively high inflation started eroding the newly gained competitiveness again, current\nrelative price levels are still favourable in these countries. As a reflection of these\ndevelopments, Germany lost competitiveness when the D-Mark appreciated during the\nERM I crisis, and it has since steadily been regaining lost ground through relatively low\ninflation rates.\nThe opposing results of relative and absolute PPP concepts concerning current\ncompetitiveness of EMU countries also entail an opposing assessment of whether\ncompetitiveness in the euro area is converging or not. Figure 2 shows the dispersion of\nEMU countries' price competitiveness based on absolute PPP indicators. As before, the\ndispersion is calculated as the coefficient of variation. This variable has obviously been\non a decreasing long-term trend for decades, and it continued on this course after the\nstart of monetary union, reflecting converging price levels and thus, in an absolute PPP\ninterpretation, converging competitiveness. The concept of absolute PPP, therefore,\nsuggests that the inflation differentials in the euro area, in spite of being persistent, are\nhardly a reason for concern.\n3.3 Competitiveness according to the productivity approach\nAs is shown in Table 5, results for the competitiveness of EMU countries based\non the productivity approach depend on the productivity variable used in the regression.\nThe sign of the calculated values, however, is in most cases robust to the choice of the\nproductivity regressor. Columns (2) to (4) reveal that Germany, Greece, Belgium,\nFinland and France gained competitiveness since the start of EMU by all productivity\nmeasures, ie these countries' relative price levels fell by more than one would expect\nfrom their increase in productivity. Germany and Greece displayed especially\npronounced improvements. Interestingly, Germany, Belgium, Finland and France are\nthose countries for which the indicator based on absolute PPP also displayed gains in\ncompetitiveness. Therefore, developments in productivity did not overcompensate the\nmovements in relative prices except in the case of Greece. A severe loss in\ncompetitiveness is found, in particular, for Italy and Ireland but also for Spain, Portugal\nand the Netherlands by some measures. The results are comparable to those obtained\nwith the concept of relative PPP, except in the cases of Greece, Belgium and\nLuxembourg.\nAccording to columns (5) to (7), competitiveness has recently been rather high, at\nleast by one of the measures, in Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Luxembourg and,\npossibly, in Italy and Austria. In these countries, relative price levels are low compared\nwith at least some of their productivity levels. Germany, Finland, Ireland and, according\nto one productivity measure, also Portugal suffer from a rather low competitiveness\ndefined by posting high relative price levels compared to their productivity levels. Apart\nfrom Luxembourg, where high productivity levels apparently make up for the high\nrelative prices, and Portugal, where low relative price levels can be accounted for by\nlow productivity levels, the picture is quite similar to the one that emerges when the\nabsolute PPP concept is applied, and thus competitiveness levels are distinctly different\nin many cases from those obtained with the concept of relative PPP.\nThese similarities and differences are reflected in the development of dispersion\nof EMU countries' price competitiveness based on the productivity approach, as can be\nseen from Figure 3. Competitiveness converged in the 1960s, remained more or less\nconstant in the 1970s and 1980s and has been converging again since the start of the\n1990s. Inflation differentials in the euro area would thus be qualified as rather\ninnocuous in the framework of the productivity approach.\nSince they are coefficients of variation, the calculated levels of dispersion can be\ncompared across concepts. The dispersion based on the concept of relative PPP turns\nout to be almost continuously lower than the dispersion based on either of the other two\nconcepts. This may, however, be a quite natural outcome because the procedure of\nassigning the role of the equilibrium value to the long-term average of the real effective\nexchange rate entails a kind of minimisation of deviations of competitiveness against\nEMU trading partners for every EMU country. The use of country-specific fixed effects\nin the productivity approach regression would have had a similar effect.\nIn a comparison of the development of competitiveness dispersion over time,\nseveral similarities between the dispersion measures based on different concepts attract\nattention. Up to the start of the 1970s, competitiveness dispersion declined. The turmoil\nof the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, however, was again associated with\nrelatively high dispersion rates. The formation of the European Monetary System in the\nlate 1970s was able, apparently, to soothe dispersion further. According to all measures\nof dispersion, competitiveness converged rapidly within today's euro area at the start of\nthe 1990s. This process, however, was interrupted by the EMS crisis in late 1992. All\nmeasures displayed a local maximum of dispersion in 1995 when the Italian lira, the\nGreek drachma and the Spanish peseta depreciated considerably against most of the\nother currencies of today's EMU countries. This observation possibly indicates\novershooting phenomena at work. Sharp exchange rate adjustments such as this one and\nthe one in the 1970s are obviously not associated with a reduction in possible\nmisalignments but instead with an increasing dispersion from equilibrium rates.\nAll these similarities between different concepts of equilibrium real exchange\nrates contrast starkly with the period since the formation of EMU in January 1999\nwhich is characterised by a steadily increasing dispersion according to relative PPP\nmeasures while both the concept of absolute PPP and the productivity approach\ndiagnose a decrease in competitiveness dispersion. This raises the issue of which of the\nthree concepts may be the most plausible.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the productivity approach, being the most\ncomprehensive, realistic and elaborate argument, may appear to be the most appealing\nof the three equilibrium concepts used. It turns out, however, that this approach yields\nrather curious results, while especially results from the concept of relative PPP are\nmostly rather intuitive. As an example, Figures 4 shows the development of the price\ncompetitiveness of the German economy based on the productivity approach, where\nproductivity per hour worked is used in the regression. This indicator suggests that\nGermany's price competitiveness has continuously been below equilibrium since the\nstart of the 1970s, ie the German relative price level has been higher than productivity\nwould justify for more than thirty years. This contrasts starkly with the persistently high\ntrade surpluses of Germany in (extra and) intra-EMU trade.\nOf course, it is not only price competitiveness which determines the trade balance.\nMovements in relative demand and non-price competitiveness factors, for instance,\naffect the trade balance as well. These factors, however, can hardly explain the\npersistence of the discrepancy between the apparent low competitiveness, as indicated\nby this particular productivity measure, and the trade surplus of Germany. Similar\ninconsistencies can be found for many other countries in the sample. Such\ninconsistencies could arise, in principle, if measurement errors biased the calculations.\nIn the present case, the collection of prices as well as the computation of GDP and of\nthe total number of man-hours worked could have been affected by measurement errors,\nespecially as far as international comparability is concerned.\nIf the total number of man-hours worked were the culprit, however, one would be\nleft to explain why the two alternative productivity measures (GDP per head of\npopulation and GDP per person employed) that do not use the total number of man-\nhours worked yield rather similar results concerning, for instance, the apparent low\ncompetitiveness of the German economy. These two productivity measures, in turn, use\nGDP values in purchasing power parities. Honohan (1998), however, claims that using\nGDP based on purchasing power parities biases upwards the productivity of poorer\neconomies. In fact, the productivity approach assesses the competitiveness positions of\nthe less wealthy EMU countries Greece, Portugal and Spain much more positively than\nthe concept of relative PPP. The argument is still not particularly convincing because\nthe highly wealthy Luxembourg economy displays the same pattern and because\nabsolute PPP yields even more upbeat competitiveness values for Greece, Portugal and\nSpain than the productivity approach. This may imply that quality of some sort has not\nbeen adequately taken into consideration in the price variables.\nAccording to some observers, the methodological treatment of German unification\nmay account for the rather implausible results of the productivity approach calculations.\nIn the early 1990s, West German data were replaced by unified German data which\nnoticeably reduced productivity but did not affect the relative price level. In order to\ncheck for the effect of German unification, the calculations were reperformed by using\nWest German productivity for the entire observation period.13 The modified and the\noriginal panel regression results are virtually the same. They deviate, however, in that\nthe estimated residuals for West Germany after unification decrease markedly. A\ncompetitiveness indicator, constructed from these residuals along the lines described in\nsection 2.3, assesses recent German competitiveness as being more or less neutral, ie\nrelative price levels hardly deviate from the estimated equilibrium value. The\ncorresponding deviations from equilibrium of the other euro-area countries show a 2 to\n4 percentage point fall in competitiveness depending on the weight of Germany in their\nexternal trade. From our point of view, however, it is generally questionable whether it\nis sensible to still ignore the eastern part of Germany 16 years after reunification.\n4. Conclusions\nThe persistent inflation differentials between countries of the euro area raise\nconcerns that they may constitute a continuous divergence of competitiveness of EMU\nmember countries. The present study addresses this issue by using three different\nconcepts of equilibrium real exchange rates to assess trends in international price\ncompetitiveness among EMU countries. Relative PPP, absolute PPP and the\nproductivity approach are chosen as equilibrium concepts especially because they are\nsimple and enable a straightforward comparison between different economies.\nIt is found that the choice of the equilibrium concept has hardly been affecting the\ndirection of change of price competitiveness since the start of monetary union in\nJanuary 1999. Regardless of the concept used, the analysis reveals that the German\neconomy was able to improve its price competitiveness compared with the euro-area\ntrading partners while Italy, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg lost\n13 A West German series for GDP per hour worked is available up to 1997. More recent observations\nhave been constructed through extrapolation under the assumption of equal productivity growth in East\nand West Germany. This assumption is, of course, debatable.\ncompetitiveness to varying degrees. The results concerning the current level of\ncompetitiveness, however, depend heavily on the equilibrium concept used. Relative\nPPP, for instance, suggests a relatively high competitiveness of the German economy\nand a rather low one for Italy, Greece and Spain. Absolute PPP and the productivity\napproach suggest exactly the opposite.\nThe fact that different concepts assess the development of competitiveness\nsimilarly but the level of competitiveness differently entails a different judgement of\nrecent developments in the dispersion of competitiveness among EMU countries. While\nmeasures based on relative PPP show a continuous increase in dispersion since the start\nof EMU, competitiveness in the euro area converges according to measures based on\nabsolute PPP or the productivity approach. Compared with pre-EMU standards, current\ncompetitiveness dispersion is very high if judged from a relative PPP point of view but\nit is very low in the framework of the two alternative concepts. The differences are all\nthe more puzzling as the movements of all the dispersion measures, including those\nbased on relative PPP were broadly similar in pre-EMU times.\nIn sum, the persistent inflation differentials between current EMU member\ncountries could be considered rather innocuous when judged from an absolute PPP or\nproductivity approach perspective. According to these two concepts, inflation\ndifferentials simply reflect price convergence movements which are an intended\nconsequence of the formation of monetary union and which should level out as soon as\nconvergence is completed. From a relative PPP perspective, however, intra-euro-area\ninflation differentials are a genuine reason for concern because, in this framework, some\neuro-area countries accumulate a continuously increasing competitive advantage\ncompared with their trading partners within EMU. In such a case, the absence of\nnational monetary policy instruments could make the necessary adjustment process\nslow and painful for euro-area economies that suffer from a low competitiveness.\nWhile the productivity approach may be theoretically most appealing, it yields\nless plausible results than a relative PPP-based approach. Trade balance movements, for\ninstance, are much more in line with results based on relative PPP. The use of more\ncomplex equilibrium concepts of the real exchange rate does not appear to be a\nparticularly promising way to solve the puzzle since complexity would probably reduce\ninternational comparability. Instead, the puzzle may have its origin in systematic\nmeasurement errors in the variables used for the calculation of the competitiveness\nindicators. A careful investigation of the potential presence of measurement errors,\npossibly by using much more disaggregated price data, as well as an in-depth analysis\nof the relationship between different measures of competitiveness and the movements in\nforeign trade variables may thus be the obvious next steps in the assessment of\ncompetitiveness trends in the euro area.\nReferences\nAllington, N F B, P A Kattuman and F A Waldmann, 2005, One market, one money,\nArnold, I J M and B A Verhoef, 2004, External causes of euro zone inflation\nBalassa, B, 1964, The purchasing-power parity doctrine: a reappraisal, The Journal of\nBanerjee, A, M Marcellino and C Osbat, 2004, Some cautions on the use of panel\nmethods for integrated series of macroeconomic data, Econometrics Journal, 7,\nBanerjee, A, M Marcellino and C Osbat, 2005, Testing for PPP: Should we use panel\nBreitung, J and S Das, 2005, Panel unit root tests under cross sectional dependence,\nBreitung, J and M H Pesaran, 2005, Unit roots and cointegration in panels, Deutsche\nBuldorini, L, S Makrydakis and C Thimann, 2002, The effective exchange rates of the\neuro, ECB Occasional Paper No. 2.\nCanzoneri, M B, R E Cumby and B Diba, 1999, Relative labour productivity and the\nreal exchange rate in the long run: evidence for a panel of OECD countries,\nCoakley, J and A-M Fuertes, 2000, Is there a base currency effect in long-run PPP?,\nCorden, W M, 1994, Economic Policy, Exchange Rates, and the International System,\nOxford University Press.\nDeLoach, S B, 2001, More evidence in favor of the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis,\nDeutsche Bundesbank, 1998, The indicator quality of different definitions of the real\nDeutsche Bundesbank, 2004, Purchasing power parity theory as a concept for\nDriver, R L and P F Westaway, 2005, Concepts of equilibrium exchange rates, in R\nDriver, P Sinclair and C Thoenissen (eds.), Exchange Rates, Capital Flows and\nECB, 2002, Price level convergence and competition in the euro area, Monthly Bulletin,\nECB, 2003a, Developments in the euro area's international cost and price\nECB, 2003b, Inflation differentials in the euro area: potential causes and policy\nimplications, Mimeo.\nECB, 2005a, Indicators of euro area cost and price competitiveness: similarities and\nECB, 2005b, Monetary policy and inflation differentials in a heterogeneous currency\nECB, 2007, The introduction of harmonised competitiveness indicators for euro area\nEngel, C and J H Rogers, European product market integration after the euro, Economic\nEuropean Commission, 1990, One market, one money: an evaluation of the potential\nbenefits and costs of forming an economic and monetary union, European\nEuropean Commission, 1996, The 1996 single market review: background information\nfor the report to the Council and European Parliament, Commission Staff\nFaber, R P and A C J Stokman, 2005, Price convergence in Europe from a macro\nperspective: product categories and reliability, DNB Working Paper No 34.\nFarina, F, 2001, Monetary policy and competitiveness in the euro area, in M Franzini\nand F R Pizzuti (eds.), Globalization, Institutions and Social Cohesion, Springer,\nFelettigh, A, R Lecat, B Pluyaud and R Tedeschi, 2006, Market shares and trade\nspecialisation of France, Germany and Italy, in O de Bandt, H Herrmann and G\nParigi (eds.), Convergence or Divergence in Europe?
