The\ndietary intake of PUFAs was analyzed by peripheral neuropathy status. Multivariate logistic\nregression models were used to estimate the odds of having peripheral neuropathy in higher\nquintiles of PUFA intake compared with the lowest quintile.\nRESULTS -- The mean dietary intake of linolenic acid was 1.25  0.07 g among adults with\nperipheral neuropathy, significantly lower than the 1.45  0.05 g intake among those without\nperipheral neuropathy. After controlling for potential confounding variables, adults whose lin-\nolenic acid intake was in the highest quintile had lower odds of peripheral neuropathy than\nCONCLUSIONS -- Among adults with diagnosed diabetes, dietary intake of linolenic acid\nis positively associated with lower odds of peripheral neuropathy.\nThe prevalence of peripheral neurop-\nathy is 28.5% among adults aged\n40 years with diabetes in the U.S.\npopulation (1). Besides improving glyce-\nmic control, few available therapeutic\nchoices for peripheral neuropathy can in-\nfluence its natural history (2). Identifica-\ntion of additional modifiable factors that\nmay be related to the progression of pe-\nripheral neuropathy is important. This\nstudy investigated whether dietary poly-\nunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake is\nassociated with measured peripheral\nneuropathy.\nMETHODS\nThis study used data from the National\n \nself-reported diagnosed diabetes, periph-\neral neuropathy measurement, and com-\nplete and reliable 24-h dietary recall data.\nMeasurements of peripheral\nneuropathy\nPeripheral neuropathy was assessed by\ntesting foot sensation using a 5.07-gauge\nSemmes-Weinstein nylon monofilament\n(3). Three plantar metatarsal sites (hallux\nand first and fifth metatarsal heads) were\ntested on each foot in random order. Pe-\nripheral neuropathy was defined as hav-\ning one or more insensate sites (1).\nAssessment of PUFA intake\nDietary nutrient intake estimates were ob-\ntained from a single in-person interview\nof 24-h dietary intake.

A logistic re-\ngression model was used to estimate the\nodds of having peripheral neuropathy\namong adults in higher PUFA intake\nquintiles relative to adults in the lowest\nPUFA intake quintile (Q1), first adjusting\nfor energy intake and then further adjust-\ning for previously identified covariates.\nAnalyses were conducted using SUDAAN\nRESULTS\nAdults with peripheral neuropathy were\nsignificantly older, taller, and more likely\nto be male and had lower education and\nlonger duration of diabetes than adults\nwithout peripheral neuropathy.\nAmong adults with peripheral neu-\nropathy, the mean daily total PUFA intake\nintake of linolenic acid (C18:3) was\nspective values among adults without pe-\nripheral neuropathy. Intake of other\nPUFAs was not statistically different by\nperipheral neuropathy status.\nRelative to adults in Q1 of total PUFA\nintake, the odds of having peripheral neu-\nadults in Q5 after adjusting for previously\nidentified covariates (Table 1).

The asso-\nciation between taking supplements con-\ntaining PUFAs and the risk of peripheral\nneuropathy was not estimated because of\nsmall sample size. Inclusion of supplement\nusageinregressionmodelsdidnotaffectthe\nassociation between dietary PUFA intake\nand peripheral neuropathy.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first study to explore whether\nhigh dietary PUFA intake is associated\nwith lower risk of peripheral neuropathy.\nWe found that dietary intake of linolenic\nacid C18:3 (undifferentiated) is nega-\ntively associated with the odds of periph-\neral neuropathy among adults with\ndiabetes. Studies have shown that -lin-\nments have a protective effect on diabetic\never, GLA is seldom found in foods. The\nmajor form of C18:3 in food is -linolenic\nacid (C18:3 n-3) (ALA). Thus, it is reason-\nable to expect that the negative associa-\ntion between C18:3 and peripheral\nneuropathy in this study is due to ALA.\nNo study has examined the associa-\ntion between ALA and diabetic peripheral\nneuropathy. However, high dietary intake\nof ALA was found to reduce the risk of\ncoronary heart disease (15\u00ad17) and to be\nassociated with lower risk for hyperten-\nsion (18). Vascular factors are important\nin the pathogenesis of peripheral neu-\nropathy (2,19). The protective effect of\nALA on macrovascular diseases and its\nassociation with diabetic peripheral\nneuropathy may be due to similar bio-\nlogical mechanisms.\nOne limitation of this study is that the\nPUFA intake was classified based on a sin-\ngle 24-h dietary recall. Due to daily vari-\nation in dietary intake, adults may be\nmisclassified with respect to their usual\nPUFA intake, but the effect seems to be\nrandom across the groups. In NHANES,\nonly tactile peripheral neuropathy is mea-\nsured, and the association of PUFAs to\nother sensory functions, such as temper-\nature sensitivity, cannot be considered.\nHowever, monofilament is an inexpen-\nsive and well-accepted tool for measuring\nperipheral neuropathy. It has a sensitivity\ndicting foot ulcer (20).\nIdentification of prevention methods\nfor peripheral neuropathy can help reduce\nthe prevalence of peripheral neuropathy\nand its complications. More work is needed\nto study the association between ALA and\nperipheral neuropathy reported here and to\nclarify the biological mechanisms.\nReferences\n1.
