We used multiple logistic regression to model three risk\nreduction behaviors (controlling or losing weight, increasing physical activity, and reducing the\namount of dietary fat or calories) with family history of diabetes.\nRESULTSdOverall, 36.2% of U.S. adults without diabetes had a family history of diabetes.\nAmong them, ~39.8% reported receiving advice from a physician during the past year regarding\nany of the three selected behaviors compared with 29.2% of participants with no family history\n(P , 0.01). In univariate analysis, adults with a family history of diabetes were more likely to\nperform these risk-reducing behaviors compared with adults without a family history. Physician\nadvice was strongly associated with each of the behavioral changes (P , 0.01), and this did not\ndiffer by family history of diabetes.\nCONCLUSIONSdFamilial risk for diabetes and physician advice both independently\ninfluence the adoption of diabetes risk\u00adreducing behaviors. However, fewer than half of par-\nticipants with familial risk reported receiving physician advice for adopting these behaviors.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) recently reported\nthat 25.8 million people in the U.S.\n(8.3% of the population) have diabetes\n(1). A total of 1.9 million new cases of\ndiabetes were diagnosed in people aged\nmillion (11.3%) people in this age-group\nhave diabetes. Worldwide, it is estimated\nthat 280 million people had diabetes in\nhave reported strong and consistent evi-\ndence that lifestyle factors might prevent\nor delay type 2 diabetes among people at\nhigh risk, including those with a family his-\nHealth Report (5) identified risk-reducing\nbehaviors (such as controlling or losing\nweight, increasing physical activity, and\nreducing fat or calories) as important life-\nstyle risk factors for a number of chronic\ndiseases, including diabetes, cardiovascu-\nlar disease, and cancer.\nMany variables, including genetic,\nenvironmental, medical, and socioeco-\nnomic factors, influence the development\nof diabetes (6). The association of family\nhistory of diabetes with risk for the dis-\nease has been well documented (7).\nHealth State of the Science conference\nconcluded that there was insufficient evi-\ndence to support the routine use of family\nhistory as a screening tool for risk of com-\nmon complex conditions in primary care\n(8), an individual patient's family history\nremains a critical element in risk assess-\nment for many chronic conditions, in-\ncluding diabetes (9). While accurate and\ncomplete family history information needs\nto be collected to identify high-risk individ-\nuals, substantial barriers exist to obtaining\nthis information in primary care practice,\nthough cliniciansare trained todo so.These\nbarriers include lack of time to collect the\ninformation, lack of proper training to in-\nterpret the information, and lack of reim-\nEvidence also supports the effective-\nness of physician advice on lifestyle mod-\nifications to prevent or delay the risk of\nchronic diseases (11). A recent study on di-\nabetes risk reduction behaviors found that\nthe proportion of adults with prediabetes\nwho reported performing risk reduction\nbehaviors was higher among those who re-\nceived physician advice compared with\nthose who did not receive such advice (12).\nIn light of the evidence summarized\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey(NHANES),a large population-\nbased and nationally representative\nsurvey of the U.S., to test the hypotheses\nthat a family history of diabetes is associ-\nated with greater adoption of diabetes\nrisk\u00adreducing behaviors and that the asso-\nciation is strengthened by the receipt of\nphysician advice regarding these behaviors,\nin addition to other commonly known fac-\ntors associated with diabetes risk.\nMETHODSdNHANES is a complex,\nmultistage cross-sectional sample survey\nconducted annually by the National Center\nc c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c\nFrom the 1Office of Public Health Genomics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; and\nthe 2Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.\nCorresponding author: Man-huei Chang, mdc9@cdc.gov.\nThis article contains Supplementary Data online at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10\nThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official\nposition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\u00a9 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.

All participants were asked whether\nthey are now 1) controlling their weight or\nlosing weight, 2) increasing their physical\nactivity or exercise, or 3) reducing the\namount of fat or calories in their diet. Par-\nticipants were also asked whether they had\nbeen told by a physician or health profes-\nsional in the past 12 months to perform\neach of these behaviors.\nDemographic factors included in the\nyears), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nother), and education (either less than\nhigh school or greater than or equal to\nhigh school). Clinical factors were obtained\nfrom medical examination and laboratory\ndata. BMI was dichotomized as $25 or\n,25 kg/m2. Participants with systolic\nblood pressure $140 mmHg or diastolic\nblood pressure $90 mmHg or currently\ntaking antihypertension medication were\ndefined as hypertensive.

All models in-\ncluded NHANES sample weights for the\nvariables included in the model (sex, age,\nrace/ethnicity, education, BMI, hyperten-\nsion, hypercholesterolemia, and physician\nadvice). We tested interactions between\nfamily history and commonly known fac-\ntors associated with diabetes risk, including\nphysician advice, to further examine\nwhether the adoption of each of the three\nbehaviors varied by family history of diabe-\ntes and whether the included participants\nreceived physician advice on these behav-\niors. We used x2 statistics based on the log\nodds ratio to determine the significance of\nthe selected characteristics of the partici-\npants by family history of diabetes.

When\nexamining the participants who did not\nreceive physician advice (Supplementary\nTable 3), fewer than half reported per-\nforming these risk-reducing behaviors.\nThe performance of one or more of the\nbehaviors in the past year varied by edu-\ncational attainment, BMI, and hyper-\ntension status among those with and\nthose without a family history of diabetes\nCONCLUSIONSdOur data suggest\nthat slightly more than one-third of U.S.\nadultswithout diabetes had a familyhistory\nthan half reported receiving a physician's\nor health professional's advice during the\npast year about diabetes risk\u00adreducing be-\nhavioral changes. Although there is sub-\nstantial evidence that diabetes can be\nprevented by healthy lifestyle changes,\nour data show that no more than one-\nhalf of U.S. adults without diabetes repor-\nted trying to perform these risk-reducing\nbehaviors in the past 12 months. How-\never, when physician advice was received,\n.70% of U.S. adults without diabetes re-\nported following the advice and engaging\nin one or more of these behavioral\nchanges. In contrast, a smaller percentage\nof people who did not receive physician\nadvice acknowledged making these\nchanges.\nConsistent with prior studies (11),\nour study confirms independent associa-\ntions of physician advice and diabetes risk\nfactors, including familial risk for diabe-\ntes, with diabetes risk\u00adreducing behav-\niors in the general adult U.S. population\nwithout diabetes. However, the effect of\nfamily history of diabetes on risk-reducing\nbehavior changes was diminished after\naccounting for all commonly known asso-\nciated risk factors for diabetes.\nFamily history is an important risk\nfactor that reflects inherited genetic sus-\nceptibility, shared environment, and\ncommon behaviors. Valdez et al. (7) re-\nported that approximately one of every\nthree adults in the U.S. population has a\nmoderate or high familial risk of diabetes.\nPeople with a family history of diabetes\nhave been found to have two to six times\nhigher risk of having type 2 diabetes (16).\nStudies have suggested that the use of\nfamily history as a screening tool to detect\ndiabetes and cardiovascular diseases is an\ninexpensive method of extracting geno-\nmic information (17). Regardless, a re-\ncent study on the impact of a positive\nfamily history and genetic risk variants\non the incidence of diabetes reported a\ndifference in diabetes incidence accord-\ning to family history in the early years of\nintervention but that this difference dis-\nappeared upon follow-up (18). Our data\nsuggest that people with a reported fam-\nily history of diabetes participate more in\nrisk-reducing behavior changes than\nthose with no family history (without ac-\ncounting for all commonly known asso-\nciated risk factors, including the reception\nof physician advice). This could be because\nFHx+ individuals are more aware of their\nrisk of diabetes than are FHx2 individuals\nIn agreement with other studies (20),\nour data suggest a strong effect of physician\nadvice on the adoption of risk-reducing be-\nhavioral changes in the previous year,\nwhich varied by demographic characteris-\ntics. However, the prevalence of perform-\ning risk-reducing behaviors did not differ\nby family history of diabetes for those who\nreceived and followed physician advice on\nbehavioral changes. Given the high per-\ncentage of people performing these behav-\niors if in receipt of advice, our data suggest\nthat this advice was effective but that the\nknowledge of a positive family history did\nnot increase the already high percentage of\npeople adopting the preventive behaviors.\nA prior study on lifestyle modification to\nimprove blood pressure control in indi-\nviduals with diabetes concluded that phy-\nsician advice is effective at changing\nhypertension-related lifestyle factors\namong people with diabetes, regardless\nof sex or race/ethnicity (11). Studies also\nreported that patients with type 2 diabetes\nmight visit their family physicians up to\nnine times yearly (21), giving physicians\nand other health care professionals many\nopportunities to assess and to encourage\npatients to engage in risk-reducing behav-\niors. In spite of the influence of family\nhistory in risk-reducing behavior changes\nand the important role of physician advice\non lifestyle changes, our data suggest that\nmore than one-half of people at high risk\n(i.e., with a positive family history of di-\nabetes) had not received physician advice\non lifestyle changes in the past 12 months.\nUsing our data and data from a recent\nCDC diabetes report (1), we estimate\nthat there are .49 million people aged\n$20 years who do not have diabetes but\nwho are at high risk because of a positive\nfamily history who have not received\nphysician advice on lifestyle changes or\nrecommended interventions. These find-\nings indicate a great challenge in diabetes\nprevention, particularly for high-risk\nindividuals.\nPrevious studies have reported that\nnumerous factors may influence the rou-\ntine provision of physician advice on life-\nstyle changes, for example, lack of time for\ncounseling, physician training and educa-\ntion, limited staff support, reimbursement\nfor preventive services, knowledge of suc-\ncessful strategies, community resources,\nlimited English proficiency, and perceived\nsuccess rate (11). Despite these barriers,\nadoption of these risk-reducing behaviors\ncould be substantially promoted if physi-\ncian advice is provided (22). Therefore, as\nphysicians are increasingly encouraged to\noffer preventive care, effective strategies\nneed to be developed to promote lifestyle\nchanges and to help physicians overcome\nbarriers to promoting a healthy lifestyle.\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study has several strengths. First, we\nconducted this study using data from a\nnationally representative sample of the\nU.S. population, making our estimates\ngeneralizable to the entire population\nof U.S. adults without diabetes. Second,\nNHANES provides substantial data on\nbiological and lifestyle factors, all of\nwhich were collected using standard labo-\nratory and physical measurements. Fi-\nnally, our study includes 4 years of data\nand, thus, a large sample size, powering\nour statistical ability to detect associa-\ntions. However, there are several limita-\ntions. First, NHANES is cross-sectional,\nso we could not formally assess the tem-\nporal relation between physician advice\nand family history with behavior changes\nor assess these factors in relation to di-\nabetes incidence. We were only able to\nevaluate how risk-reducing behaviors\nassociated with family history and how\nmuch of this association is due to physi-\ncian advice. We accessed the association\nChang and Associates\nof family history on reports of behavioral\nchanges for the preceding 12 months.\nNevertheless, it is unclear whether these\nlifestyle changes would continue long term.\nSecond, there may be substantial social de-\nsirability bias introduced by self-reported\nresponses regarding lifestyle changes and\nthe receipt of physician advice. There are\nno separate methods in NHANES to vali-\ndate self-reported variables, including\nfamily history of diabetes. Third, family\nhistory of diabetes could only be defined\nbased on first-degree relatives, since infor-\nmation for other relatives was not asked in\nprevious study (23), differences in the def-\ninition of family history between studies\nmay lead to inconsistent findings. Fourth,\nthe terms \"physician advice\" and \"physi-\ncian counseling\" may not be interpreted\nconsistently (11). Therefore, there should\nbe some caution when comparing our es-\ntimates of the effect of physician advice on\nthe adoption of diabetes risk reduction be-\nhaviors with the findings of other studies.\nIn addition, other factors affect the influ-\nence of physician advice, such as the use of\neffective counseling techniques, the dura-\ntion of counseling, how often patients\nhave physician visits and get counseled,\nand the physician's attitude and percep-\ntions (24). These factors were not consid-\nered in the current study. Finally, the\nresults of this study may be influenced\nby the misclassification of diabetes (25).\nWe did not use measures of fasting plasma\nglucose or results from glucose tolerance\ntests because these tests were performed\nin only a subset of NHANES participants,\nwhich would have largely reduced our sam-\nple size. Therefore, we defined diabetes by\nself-report and by using the new HbA1c\ncri-\nteriarecentlyrecommendedbytheAmerican\nDiabetes Association (14).\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that\nfamily history of diabetes and advice\nfrom a health professional both influence\nthe adoption of diabetes risk\u00adreducing be-\nhaviors. Our data also indicated that peo-\nple with family history are more likely to\nhave a discussion with their doctors on\nbehavior changes. There is room for im-\nprovement regarding the proportion of\nadults who actually receive such advice.\nHowever, once the advice is provided, fa-\nmilial risk does not seem to affect the\nadoption of these behaviors. It appears\nlikely that the continued development of\npractical methods and effective strategies\nto promote behavioral changes is needed\nto contain, and perhaps reverse, the mod-\nern epidemic of diabetes.\n"
