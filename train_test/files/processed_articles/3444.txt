Testamentary litigation was generally believed\nto be on the rise in the 19th century as reflected in the textual\nanalysis of contemporary law reports, treatises, and medico-\nlegal literature (Blumenthal, 2006; e.g., the American Journal\nof Insanity, a predecessor of the American Journal of\nPsychiatry, published at least seven \"will cases\" during the\nfirst decades of publication beginning in 1844); however,\nexact numbers need yet to be studied (Eigen, 2006). In an era\nwhere capacity of self-government was presumed for all, the\nbounds of testamentary freedom (absolute liberty of the testa-\ntor vs. the domestic rights of his family) were debated\n(Blumenthal, 2006). In legal practice, the extent of the liberty\nof testation would hinge on the legal meanings of a \"sound\nand disposing mind and memory\" (Blumenthal, 2006). It was\nexactly this niche, comprising cases of \"unnatural\" or deviant\nwills that attracted the interest of the early alienists. As scien-\ntific experts, they could opine on the observable manifesta-\ntions of insanity, capable of drawing the line between insanity\nand mere eccentricity, but also demonstrated a \"palpable\ncuriosity regarding the motives that animated the eccentric,\nthe singular, and the socially--if not mentally--irrational\"\nThe Oliver Smith will case (1847) offers an opportunity\nto examine the practical application of the theoretical basis\nof insanity in a civil case. A newspaper article, \"The Case of\nOliver Smith's Will\" (Anonymous, 1847) and a short book\nwere the first reports of the case. The book provides a com-\nprehensive account, including a biography of Oliver Smith,\na copy of his will, and the proceedings in the Probate Court.\nThey were followed by an article titled \"AWill Contest on the\nGrounds of the Insanity of One of the Attesting Witnesses,\"\nrunning title \"Oliver Smith's Will\" (Anonymous, 1848), the\nsecond account of a will contest published in the American\nJournal of Insanity (henceforth, the Journal), preceded only\nby a translated abstract of a French will case (T. R. B, 1846).\nThe anonymous author of the report might have beenAmariah\nBrigham, the Journal founder and first editor, who wrote\nmany of the articles that appeared in the earliest volumes\nGazette for the report of the trial, of which only a substance\n(italics in original) of the testimony was included. He was\nalso one of the experts involved at the trial.\nBased on these, other sources (Amherst College, 1927;\ntions, we introduce Oliver Smith, his will, the attacks to the\nwill, and the participants at the trial.

He was the youngest of six brothers, all\ndeceased before him; his father died when he was 1 year old,\nand he was raised by his mother. Having a very limited for-\nmal education, at the age of 21 he took his share in the\npatrimony, in land, at the value of US$500. In course of\ntime, being an industrious, hard working man, who made\ngood investments as well as other successful financial deci-\nsions, while spending little (Sttebins, 1898), he accumulated\na significant fortune.\nOliver Smith was a charitable man, directing his assistance\ntoward poor young women, the building of school houses in\npoordistrictsofhisnativetown,andtheAmericanColonization\nSociety. Given his personal history, and because \"his kindred\nwere in good circumstances\" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline\n2008], p. 8), it was anticipated that the \"bulk of his estate\nshould be applied to public uses\" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline\nAs early as 1832, with the aid of a local judge, a draft of\nthe first will was prepared, and completed the same year by\nCharles P. Phelps, a successful lawyer of nearby Hadley.\nVarious codicils were added from year to year, reflecting the\nfluctuations in the value of his property. Accordingly, the\nnumber of the beneficiary towns varied from 8 to 12, and\n\"some individual legacies were occasionally inserted, or\nCharles P. Phelps prepared another will, which was executed\n1845, with further specifications on how to invest the funds,\nhowever without changing the will's beneficiaries. In his\nfinal will, a detailed and thoughtful document, Oliver Smith\nnominated Austin Smith, a nephew (\"a shrewd man of busi-\nness, honest, keen, and clear in his dealings\"; Sttebins, 1898,\np. 174), as executor to the will, and for his past and future\nservices was given the testators' homestead in Hatfield.

The latter claim was subsequently\ndeclined, and in December 1846, Judge Conkey approved the\nwill and codicil.\nShortly thereafter, Smith's heirs-at-law filed a probate\nappeal to the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) claiming that\n(a) Oliver Smith was not of \"sound and disposing mind and\nmemory\" at the time of the execution of the will and codicil\nand (b) the will and codicil were not \"attested and sub-\nscribed in the presence of the testator by three competent\nwitnesses;--competent at the time of attestation\" (Boyden,\nThe first claim was dropped (Smith's neighbors \"promptly\ntestified they had never known a more sensible, saner man\";\nAnonymous, 1907), and it was agreed by all that the testator\nwas of sound mind.

Choate\nwere two of the most prominent lawyers of the time. Witnesses\nincluded the father, the brothers, and Theophilus himself (evi-\ndently considered competent by the court to testify at the time\nof the trial), as well as 13 or 14 laymen and nonexpert physi-\ncians.

His mother was the daughter of famous Chief Justice\nTheophilus Parsons of the Massachusetts State Bench. He\nprepared for college at local schools and in 1837 went to\nAmherst College. The descriptions and opinions concerning\nTheophilus made by the objecting and proponent witnesses\nof agreement and other available data permit a coherent\naccount. Theophilus, a rather reserved and shy boy, was not\nfond of company and changed conspicuously during his last\nyear of college. He was in poor health (dyspepsia, pain in the\nhead), generally depressed, and even more asocial. His phy-\nsician told him the complaints were of nervous character.\nConsequently, he left college in the summer term of his junior\nyear and the last part of his senior year, and did not complete\nhis requisite assignments for commencement. Nevertheless,\nbeing a good student, he eventually graduated college in 1841.\nThereafter, considering himself physically disqualified from\n4 SAGE Open\npursuing a profession, he lived at home working on the family\nfarm. Although not usually at the dinner table when company\nwas present, he could discuss freely many subjects and was\na voracious reader. In the summer of 1843, he told his uncle\nthat he experienced peculiar feelings, extraordinary eleva-\ntions of spirits and fullness about the head. Another uncle\n(a reverend), who met him on July 1, 1843, thought he\nwas under \"high religious excitement\" (Anonymous, 1848,\np. 231), confessing to taking pears from a tree near the road\nwhen 10 or 12 years old. In August of the same year, shortly\nafter his father broke a thigh in an accident, Theophilus\nstarted to claim that some people, including his brother,\nintended to injure him, and he was in a state of nervous\nexcitability. He became reluctant to enter the nearby woods,\nlocked the windows during the day, and got up at night to see\nif there were people around.\nIn this state, he was advised by his father to go to Worcester\nAsylum, accompanied by another brother. Woodward\ndescribed him on August 1843 as follows:\nTheophilus was still and silent, answering only in\nmonosyllables. . . . I found his health poor. . . . com-\nplained of dyspeptic symptoms, of uncomfortable\nfeelings in his head, not exactly headache, but an\noppression. . . . at times, he seemed anxious, walked\nabout the room, looked out of the windows and doors,\nand admitted his apprehension that some one was in\npursuit of him. He said, that he was afraid that people\nwould dissect him, that there was a conspiracy, that\nindividuals were about the house, suspected of evil\nintentions, and . . . suspected a brother of being in\nconspiracy. While I was conversing with [brother],\nTheophilus came to me, walking rapidly, and asked,\n\"Doctor, do you think me a pig?\" I thought this totally\ndisconnected with anything said previous. . . . I asked\nhim why he said so. He replied that it occurred to him,\nat that moment, that I thought so. (Boyden, 1847\nWoodward, thinking it would be better for Theophilus to\nstay at home, rather than in the asylum with \"other eighteen\np. 25) apparently in worthier conditions, prescribed for\nTheophilus, who was not better. On Sabbath, after his\nreturn, under some delusion and in a state of excitement,\n\"he threw himself into the water\" (Anonymous, 1848,\np. 229), probably trying to \"drown himself in the river\"\nwithin several months, a change for the better took place.\nAccording to Theophilus, he was more rational and had no\nfears or delusions anymore. His mind, however, had been\nsomewhat more depressed since then, and he more frequently\navoided company. In Spring 1844, he wrote a history of the\nFive Books of Moses for Sabbath School that was accepted by\nthe Committee of Publication. In the following years, he\ncontinued to read new books, occasionally wrote short pieces,\nand managed his \"little gains\" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline\nAt the time of the execution of the will (July 1844),\nTheophilus said, his \"bodily health was not much improved,\"\nbut his mind \"was good\" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline\nAt trial, Theophilus's testimony \"was given with remark-\nable clearness and precision.

All four agreed\nthat Theophilus was insane in August 1843. However, the\nthe experts were able to observe but not examine him.\nTherefore, the legal question dictated that those contesting\nthe will would claim that insanity was present in July 1844,\nby trying to expand its scope, whereas the parties supporting\nthe will would try to limit its definition, or deny its existence.\nThis becomes apparent in the lawyers'arguments to the court\nto be summarized in the next section. Thus, the experts were\ninterrogated as to presence of insanity, its characteristics,\nduration, causation, relationship to peculiarities of behavior,\ncompetence at daily activities, body complaints, not to men-\ntion their opinion concerning Theophilus's reliability at trial\nand his competency at the crucial legal time.\nWoodward thought Theophilus was ill during the 2 years\npreceding their first meeting. At Worcester, the alienist was\ncertain that Theophilus suffered from at least one delusion\nand was influenced by it, and that this was a form of insanity,\ninsane melancholy different from hypochondriasis. He was\nnot impressed by Theophilus's literary and work accom-\nplishments claiming that many insane persons write coher-\nent letters, essays, poetry, or even books. Avoiding society,\nhe proclaimed, was not necessarily the effect of delusion.\nHeinik and Shulman 5\nWoodward was convinced that Theophilus's condition was\ncaused by hard study\u00adinduced dyspepsia that produced a\nmorbid condition of the brain and nervous system, that is,\ninsanity. He saw no evidence of delusions in 1844, maybe\ndue to a lucid interval. Woodward argued that insanity is not\nalways dependent on the delusion. Rather, because the dys-\npepsia that caused the \"aberration of mind\" (Anonymous,\nnot legally responsible.\nBrigham thought Theophilus was insane at Worcester in\n1843, and that his delusions and attempt to drown himself\nin the river after his return from Worcester confirmed the\npresence of insanity. He regarded his \"religious revivals\"\n2008], p. 26) a reflection of a developing insanity, but was\nless convinced that Theophilus's dyspepsia, headache, shy-\nness, or writing an essay, caused or perpetuated his insanity.\nHe noticed that dyspepsia very frequently precedes, but gen-\nerally subsides, at the commencement of insanity and that\nthere is very little headache in the insane. He mentioned, as a\ngeneral fact, that when the minds of the insane recover, their\nbodies recover, although their minds are sometimes relieved\nbefore they recover their bodily health. Brigham was not\nimpressed by Theophilus's literary activities and indicated\nthat an insane person could still write a book, unless there is\naccount of his recovery and concluded that there was no evi-\nRay, similarly impressed by Theophilus's testimony,\nfound his frank and open account the strongest proof of his\nmental stability. He agreed that there were delusions for a\nlimited time in 1843; however, they were no longer present\nin 1844. He claimed that those delusions were the only proof\nof insanity in 1843. Nothing further indicative of insanity\nwas observed. Consequently, Ray said that Theophilus was\nperfectly competent to attest the will in 1844.\nBell, in agreement with the other experts, had no doubt\nconcerning Theophilus's insanity at Worcester, in 1843; how-\never, he presumed that it gradually disappeared in 2 to 3 months.\nHeadache was not an essential component of insanity, and\nthus it was concluded that Theophilus was capable to attest\nA Brief Summary of the\nLawyers' Arguments, the\nVerdict, and Epilogue\nChoate raised an expanded and comprehensive account\nconcerning Theophilus's insanity, which, rhetoric excluded,\nmight seem derived from a contemporaneous textbook\non insanity, whereas Webster argued for a limited one\nAccording to the plaintiffs' lawyer, a change in personality\nstarted when Theophilus went to college, in the end of the 3rd\nor the beginning of the 4th year; this culminated into manifest\ninsanity during the summer of 1843, when he was \"not mad for\nthe first time, but differently mad\" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline\nmind was not there; he was brooding over some delusion\"\n\"try the testators' mind\" and to \"protect\" him (Boyden,\ning to his interpretation of the law, an incompetent witness.\nFor Webster, the case turned a good deal on the \"character\nand if insanity has been proved, then it might be \"temporary or\nor curable.

By 1847, the 3-year-old\n6 SAGE Open\n\"Association\" had its third annual meeting that provided a\nforum for the exchange of ideas. The proceedings were pub-\nlished regularly in the Journal, the first periodical in the\nEnglish language to be devoted exclusively to psychological\nmedicine (Overholser, 1944), that also published both trans-\nlated and original articles by European authors and reported\nnews from Europe. Rush's textbook of 1812, Ray's \"Treatise\"\npublished. The alienists who participated in the trial were\nactively involved in the formation of American mental\nmedicine. They all contributed to the literature and debate on\ninsanity. With the exception of Woodward, all had visited\nthe institutions for the insane in Europe, and all were inspired\nby French and English alienists (Overholser, 1944). The\nAmerican view of insanity was therefore very similar if not\nidentical to the European perceptions (Dain, 1964).\nDefinition of insanity. Nineteenth-century writings reflected\na very broad definition of the faculties impaired in insanity\n\"Definition of Insanity--Nature of the Disease,\" published\nin the first volume of the Journal, most probably by Brigham,\ndescribed \"a chronic disease of the brain, producing either\nderangement of the intellectual faculties or prolonged change\nof the feelings, affections, and habits of an individual\"\ntion of insanity, departing from overt delusions and frenzied\nbehavior, was inherently problematic (Bucknill & Tuke, 1858;\n\"insanity belongs to a class of phenomena that may be\ndescribed and explained, but are not the proper object of a\nlegal setting where lawyers would ask for a definition of\ninsanity to confound and discredit the expert witness (Ray,\nthe four alienists would avoid defining insanity as much\nas possible.

One does not know if any other diagnosis was\nascribed to Theophilus by the other alienists involved.\nDiagnostic symptoms. Analyzing symptoms that characterize\ninsanity was considered fundamental (Ray, 1839). In addi-\ntion to disorders of sensibility, understanding, intelligence\nand will, change in habits, tastes, and passions, which could\nappear a long time before an individual was regarded as\ninsane, were important diagnostic elements (Esquirol, 1845).\nFor Ray a change of character was a proof of insanity (Ray,\n1839), a view sustained over the next decades (Bucknill &\nThe mental phenomena demonstrated by Theophilus could\nbe subdivided into delusions and nondelusions (e.g., change\nof disposition and habits, depression/melancholy, behavioral,\netc.). It is remarkable that only the overt delusions expressed\nby Theophilus were considered central indicators of insanity\nby all four experts. Other morbid phenomena were not men-\ntioned, or mentioned only in conjunction with a delusion\n(e.g., the attempt to drown himself in water), or considered\nnonspecific (e.g., headache as a good explanation for avoid-\ning company).\nCauses of insanity.

He theorized that\nprolonged moral causes continuously irritate the brain, fol-\nlowed by dyspepsia and insanity. At trial, however, he tried\nto diminish the causative role for dyspepsia and headache\nin this case. Woodward suggested hard study as a cause for\nTheophilus's dyspepsia. However, as the evidence showed,\nTheophilus had dyspepsia and headaches before, during, and\nafter the summer of 1843, long after he graduated college.\nNeither Theophilus himself nor any of the alienists attributed\nmuch importance to his father's accident; consequently, it was\nnot considered a \"shock\" or a moral cause.\nHeinik and Shulman 7\nDuration of insanity. All alienists of the time agreed that the\nduration of the disease in cases terminating favorably was\nconsidered by Pinel to range from 5 to 6 months and by\nEsquirol and Tuke to be as long as 1 year (Bucknill & Tuke,\n1879). Associated with duration was the idea of \"incubation\"\nof insanity that was developed by French alienists in the first\nthird of the 19th century for clinical and forensic reasons\ncognizant of the state preceding insanity and seemed to have\nadopted Pinel and Georget's opinions on incubation of men-\ntal alienation during which the true state of the patient is\ngenerally misunderstood, or not appreciated and may last\nfor a long time.\nThe medical opinions at trial varied on the duration of\nTheophilus's delusions. The shortest notion (Bell) considered\nit to have continued for 2 or 3 months. Ray referred to its\nof a similar opinion. Theophilus himself said the delusions\nterminated in winter. If it was winter (January, February),\nthen the duration of the delusions was 6 to 7 months.\nFrom a broader medical point of view, the question was\nnot purely whether there was a clear delusion in 1844, but if\nthere was evidence of insanity or other nondelusional morbid\nphenomena in 1844. The medical experts were also interested\nin the morbid phenomena that preceded August 1843 cover-\ning the period of \"religious revival\" (Anonymous, 1848,\nelevations of spirits and excitement, and changes of habits\nand disposition described by some witnesses at the end of\ncollege. Whether regarded as an incubation period, indic-\native of approaching insanity, or as forming a part of a\nbroader definition of insanity, they surely indicate a period of\nmental turmoil, distress, and morbidity, ranging from 1 month\nto 2 years, preceding the delusional period, which Theophilus\nexperienced.\nCourse of insanity.

Therefore, Theophilus apparently would not\nhave met the criteria for a \"diagnosis of recovery\" (Bucknill &\nPrognosis. For Ray (1839) the circumstances favorable to\nrecovery included constitution, good moral and intellectual\neducation, hereditary predisposition for insanity, and early\nmedical treatment. Other factors favoring recovery would\nbe the occurrence of certain moral or physical impressions\n(e.g., intense fright, attack of fever).\nWere there factors that would predict favorable prognosis?\nWhile good moral and intellectual education, lack of heredi-\ntary predisposition for insanity (other than hypochondriasis/\ndyspepsia), and absence of an exciting moral or physical\ncause might be assumed as favorable circumstances, there are\ndoubts concerning the issues of constitution and appropriate\nearly treatment. Theophilus's frail constitution has already\nbeen discussed. As for early treatment, he was subjected to\nthe prevailing home/community management, however not\nexposed to the applauded asylum moral treatment (Moran,\n1998). We know that he was prescribed leeching and bleed-\ning by Dr. Gridley in July 1843 and again after his return\nfrom Worcester, but it might have been for the dyspepsia, as\nGridley saw nothing indicating insanity (Anonymous, 1847,\nTheophilus with medications at Worcester. He was consid-\nrelied, perhaps too heavily, on opiates and stimulants as rem-\nWoodwards's \"too stimulating\" (Boyden, 1847 [HeinOnline\nDiscussion\nThe \"Oliver Smith will case\" turned on the legal competency\nof one of the attesting witnesses to the will. The alienists\ninvolved were primarily questioned as to his insanity at the\ntime of attestation. Based on the available material, we con-\nclude that three out of the four alienists took a restricted view\nof insanity, equating it with the presence of delusions. The\nevidence, however, indicated that Theophilus experienced\nmorbid phenomena characteristic of insanity even before he\nmanifested delusions, and there were several indicators to\ndoubt his complete recovery from insanity in July 1844.\nWoodward took a broader view. However, even for him, the\nnondelusional phenomena were not crucial.\nPresent day practitioners have at their disposition a broad\ndefinition of \"mental disorder\" (\"a clinically significant\nbehavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern\";American\nPsychiatric Association, 1994, p. xxi), under which catego-\nries, criteria, and textual descriptions are prescribed. As for\nTheophilus, in modern eyes, a mental disorder consisting of\na prodromal period, followed by an active stage with promi-\nnent delusions and terminating in a residual phase, would be\nunderstood as probably belonging to the schizophrenia cate-\ngory (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). However,\n8 SAGE Open\nthe clinician is cautioned as to the use of the clinical diagnosis\nin forensic settings where additional information beyond that\ncontained in the diagnosis is needed in determining \"whether\nan individual meets a specified legal standards\" (American\nPsychiatric Association, 1994, p. xxiii).\nTheoretically speaking, the trial represented an opportu-\nnity for these influential alienists to present to the court all the\nbroad natural phenomena of insanity as reflected in this case,\nand which formed part of a contemporaneous broad view of\ninsanity, especially vis-\u00e0-vis criminal responsibility (Weiss,\nadvocated that incompetence to testify is not necessarily con-\nnected with insanity. He felt it would be appropriate to con-\nsider the former an independent fact to be established by a\ndistinct order of proofs.After the German jurist Hoffbauer, he\nmaintained that even a subject with lower degrees of imbecil-\nity, partial intellectual mania, or partial moral mania, and old\nmen in the early stages of dementia, under some restrictions,\ncan still testify if (a) senses are sufficiently sound to take cog-\nnizance of the facts to which he testifies, (b) the impressions\nare really what he believes they are, (c) testimony coincides\nwith his belief, and (d) he is able to convey to others his own\nideas without fear of being misinterpreted. These criteria\nestablished a distinction between diagnosis and its symptoms\non one hand and the capacities necessary for the appropriate\ncompletion of a specific legal task on the other hand.\nConsistent with Ray's reasoning, Theophilus could be broadly\ndefined as insane however still a competent witness.\nNonetheless, in this case, the experts gave primacy to the\nexistence of delusions, whose presence or absence tradition-\nally constituted the \"true test\" of insanity for legal purposes\ncontradiction with the prevailing tendency of the early alienists,\nincluding their own views (Bucknill & Tuke, 1858; Esquirol,\nin favor of a broad definition of insanity.\nWe suggest three explanatory sets of factors:\nA. Available medical knowledge: The alienists thought\nthat this case represented a short-term insanity.\nAll the great alienists described cases of relatively\nshort episodes of insanity (Esquirol, 1845; Prichard,\neral belief of a good prognosis for some recent cases\nof insanity as the statistics of asylum admissions\nand discharges demonstrated (Grob, 1962), but\nsocially, a \"cult of curability\" prevailed (Luchins,\n1992). Alternatively, a more specific diagnosis other\nthan insanity was difficult to formulate. Theophi-\nlus's case was more characteristic of lypemania/\nmelancholia (Woodward's diagnosis) according to\nEsquirol. This suggested monomania according to\nPrichard, and partial intellectual mania accord-\ning to Ray. The period preceding the confirmed\ninsanity and the one that followed it were difficult\nto classify because the appropriate terminology and\nthe lack of a longitudinal view of disease (Berrios,\n2007), clear concepts of personality and personality\ndisorders (Berrios, 1996) and recovery, would have\nrendered a specific diagnosis difficult. Nevertheless,\nthey could have regarded Theophilus's eccentricity\na lifelong process complicated by insanity, a change\nof character indicative of insanity, or insanity result-\nB. Courtroom restrictions and the case itself: The\nmedical men in the courtroom were subpoenaed\nby the judge, the parties involved, and their attor-\nneys (Eigen, 1995). In court, the medical expert can\nbe subjected to \"yes\" or \"no\" answers by experi-\nenced lawyers. Thus, they would have preferred\nto distinguish between solid clinical findings, the\nso-called \"pathognomonic signs\" of insanity (delu-\nsions; Mohr, 1993), as opposed to the theoretical\nconstructs. For example, when Woodward was pro-\nceeding to append remarks to one of his replies, he\nwas reminded that Webster did not want \"a speech\np. 21]). Theophilus's other symptoms did not con-\nstitute decisive evidence for insanity. In fact, the\nbelief that dyspepsia was a form of insanity was\none accepted that hypochondriasis was equivalent\nto insanity and disease of the brain (Anonymous,\nnot find classifications of insanity useful in treat-\ning the disease as the various forms tended to blend\ninto one another, and Bell (Bucknill & Tuke, 1879)\nabandoned his etiological classification. The alien-\nists were free within the judicial arena, to make up\ntheir own minds and to pick and choose aspects of\ntheory that were consistent with their practice and\nexperience and appealed to them. They might not\nhave found the courtroom as the appropriate forum\nto expand on \"textbook\" concepts and theories. The\nconvincing testimony offered by Theophilus himself\nat trial might have served to strengthen this view.\nC. Mid-19th-century relationship between mental med-\nicine and the law: This period was a \"golden era\"\nbetween mental medicine and the law, although this\nstate of affairs would soon change (Mohr, 1993;\nTighe, 2005). Medical experts knew more about the\nmanifestations and varieties of mental illness. The\nchallenge was how the courts could be educated to\nthe levels of understanding of experts in mental ill-\nness (Mohr, 1993). Judges and lawyers were initially\nreceptive to these \"scientific means of accounting\"\n(Blumenthal, 2006). There was a sense that they\n\"should and could share a definition of insanity,\nHeinik and Shulman 9\nif only they could clearly articulate how `the best'\npractitioners of their respective professions under-\nwas presumably easier to achieve in civil cases such\nas a will contest (Zilboorg, 1944), especially in an\nuncomplicated case (short duration, small number\nof witnesses) where the best practitioners on both\nsides were involved, as was the \"Oliver Smith will\ncase.\" Using a narrow definition, with a focus on\nthe presence or absence of delusions, would seem\na step in that direction of consensus on the con-\ncept of \"insanity\" in mid-19th century. The medi-\ncal discourse would have been different if the legal\nquestion concerned Theophilus's criminal respon-\nsibility, with its potentially serious consequences.\n"
