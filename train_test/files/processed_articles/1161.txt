Ethnic disparities in\ndiabetes prevalence that are well docu-\nmented in the community (6) continue\ninto the nursing home setting. The odds\nof diabetes were about two times higher in\nblack and Hispanic nursing home resi-\ndents relative to white residents. To the\nextent that demographic shifts and popu-\nlation projections will apply to nursing\nhomes, it is likely that nonwhites, partic-\nularly persons of Hispanic origin, will be-\ncome more highly represented in the\nnursing home population in the future\nDiabetic nursing home residents had\na somewhat more \"postacute/rehabilita-\ntion\" profile than nondiabetic residents.\nThey were admitted more often from\nacute care hospitals, were slightly more\nlikely to have stays of 100 days at the\ntime of the survey, and paid for care with\nMedicare more often than nondiabetic\nresidents.\nDiabetic residents were younger than\ntheir nondiabetic counterparts, and dia-\nbetes decreased as age increased.

Nev-\nertheless, the evidence base supporting\nclinical decision making for diabetes in\nnursing homes is sparse, partly because of\nthe difficulty of conducting clinical trials\nin this population. Given the expected in-\ncrease in the number and complexity of\nnursing home residents with diabetes in\nthe coming decades and the paucity of\nclinical research providing guidance for\ntheir care, future efforts should focus on\nfilling the knowledge gap by first defining\nend points that are appropriate for dia-\nbetic people in nursing homes and then\ndesigning clinical trials around these out-\ncomes.\nReferences\n1.
