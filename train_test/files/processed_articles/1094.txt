Politicians and\nthe mass media have highlighted crimes and drugs as\nthe cause of many social problems, and have thereby\nstigmatized criminals and, in particular, drug users [3,4].\nPerhaps as a consequence of these arguments and stigma-\ninducing activities, there has been a great increase in\nthe USA in state and local law enforcement personnel\nments in the USA in recent decades (jail and prison\nin 2001) [5]. Much of this repressive effort has focused on\nthe `War on Drugs'; arrests for drug possession in the\nPunishment and stigmatization may have unanticipated\neffects on public health in general and on drug-related\nharm in particular. As injection is a more efficient means\nof taking drugs than intranasal use, a number of resear-\nchers have suggested that punishment and stigmatization\nmight increase the pressures on non-injecting heroin\nusers and perhaps cocaine users to take up injection drug\nFrom the aNational Development and Research Institutes, New York, New York, the bDepartment of Epidemiology, Bloomberg\nSchool of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, the cMedical and Health Research Association of New\nYork/National Development and Research Institutes, Inc., New York, the dColumbia Mailman School of Public Health, New York,\nand the eBeth Israel Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.\nCorrespondence to Samuel R.

Others have found that aggressive police tactics\nand/or stigmatization may lead injection drug users\n(IDUs) to engage in hurried injection behaviors, to share\nsyringes more often, and/or to inject in high-risk\nenvironments [9\u00ad16] and, in addition, to impede the\ncreation or functioning of syringe exchange [17\u00ad20],\ndrug treatment or other programs to improve users'\nThis study investigated whether three measures of legal\nrepressiveness in large US metropolitan areas were\nassociated with the population prevalence of injection\ndrug use and with HIV prevalence among IDUs.\nMethods\n`Sample' and its statistical implications\nThe sample was the 96 largest metropolitan statistical areas\n(MSA) in the USA in 1993. MSAs, as defined by the US\nCensus Bureau, are contiguous counties that contain a\ncentral city of 50 000 people or more and that form a\nsocio-economic unity as defined by commuting patterns\nand social and economic integration within the\nconstituent counties [22,23]. The paper thus studies a\n`population' rather than a sample, so there is no sampling\nerror (although there is measurement error). The relevance\nof statistical inference is debatable. Some researchers\nstudying similar populations use `P-values' or `confidence\nintervals' as heuristic devices to avoid over-interpreting\nmodel parameters [24\u00ad29] (We refer here to `pseudo-\nconfidence intervals'.) Other analysts might view the\npopulation as a random sample of `possible universes'; in\nthis interpretation `pseudo-confidence intervals' has a\nprobabilistic interpretation.\nMissing values on the three measures of legal repressive-\nness reduced the number of MSA (N) to 89.\nVariables\nDependent variables\nAs the derivations of both dependent variables (injectors per\ncapita and HIV prevalence among injectors) have been\ndescribed previously, they are described only briefly here.\nDrug injectors per capita in the MSA population in 1998. This\nwas estimated in a three-step process [30]. The number of\npersons who had injected drugs in the USA in 1998 was\nfirst estimated by adjusting and averaging others' prior\nestimates [31,32]. This number was then allocated to each\nMSA using four multipliers (using data on drug injectors\namong drug abuse treatment populations, HIV counsel-\ning and testing clients, and AIDS cases, and estimates of\nnumbers of injectors and HIV prevalence among them in\neach MSA were then averaged; and the mean divided by\nthe MSA population.\nHIV prevalence. This was defined as the proportion of\nIDUs who were HIV positive among IDUs in 95 MSAs\nin 1998, and was estimated by taking the mean of\ntwo estimates [33]. The first estimate was calculated by\nmodifying Centers for Disease Control (CDC) voluntary\nHIV counseling and testing data to correct for their\ninherent underestimation of prevalence. Research-based\ndata on HIV prevalence for 25 MSAs were used to\ncalculate regression equations to perform these adjust-\nments. The second estimate was based on methods\ndeveloped by Lieb et al. [34]. Briefly, the estimated total\nnumber of HIV-positive IDUs (including those who\nare also men who have had sex with men) living in\nan MSA was designated as k (and estimated by adjusting\ndata on AIDS cases). The estimated numbers of IDUs (a)\n[30] and the estimated HIV prevalence among IDUs (b)\nwere variables related by the function, k \u00bc ab; thus,\nb \u00bc a/k.\nAlmost all of the independent variables precede the\ndependent variables in time so that the temporal sequence\nis correct. (This does not, of course, take account of\nthe high degree of autocorrelation over time in many of\nthese variables.)\nIndependent variables\nThe main independent variables were the three measures of\nlegal repressiveness. They are: (1) arrests for possession or\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) data; (2) police\n[35,36]; and (3) `corrections' expenditures per capita\n(1997), taken from United States Census Bureau data on\ngovernment finances [37].\nArrest of drug users may be an indicator of pressures on\npolice; and the fear of arrest may encourage drug users to\nbecome or remain drug injectors and also may lead\nPolice employees per capita. This may reflect a public\nwillingness to spend money and person-power on\npolicing. It may also indicate more direct effects on\nHIV risk; for example, Davis et al. [20] found that police\npresence, as distinct from arrests, was associated with less\nuse of syringe exchanges in Philadelphia.\nCorrection expenditures per capita. These are an indicator of\npublic willingness to spend resources on local incarcera-\ntion and probation systems as well as an indicator of the\nnumber of people arrested and the average time they\nspend in jail before and after trial, which would tend to\nincrease fear of arrest and thus to risk of using drugs by\ninjection in unsafe ways (as discussed above).\nConsideration was given to using factor analysis as a data\nreduction strategy, but the three variables had inter-\ncorrelations that were too low for the resulting single\nfactor to be meaningful (it captured slightly less than 50%\nof the variance; correlations were 0.08 between police\nemployees per capita and corrections expenditures per\ncapita; 0.19 between police employees per capita and\nheroin and cocaine arrests per capita; and 0.36 between\nheroin and cocaine arrests and corrections expenditures\nper capita.).\nControl variables\nBased on a review of relevant literature, a number of\nvariables were included in the analyses as control variables\nbecause they might affect the dependent variables at the\nmetropolitan area of analysis. These included the follow-\ning items.\nRegion. US regions differ politically and culturally, and\non mean values of both dependent variables and the\nthree legal repressiveness measures. In order to make our\ncategories for regions more homogeneous politically,\nculturally and economically, US Census categories for\nRegion were adjusted by moving Maryland, Delaware\nand Washington, DC, to the Northeast Region; Texas\nto the West; and Oklahoma to the Midwest. Midwest\nwas treated as the reference category because it had\nthe lowest mean value on drug injectors per capita. (It\nhad the second lowest mean value, 4.85%, on HIV\nprevalence, which was statistically indistinguishable\nthe West.)\nPresence of laws against over-the-counter sales of syringes.

To assess the\nsensitivity of results to such error, we re-ran the\nregressions based on two different logics. First, we re-\nran them for each dependent variable after removing the\ntwo metropolitan areas with the highest and the two with\nthe lowest values on that dependent variable. (Hence,\nN \u00bc 85 for each of these analyses.)\nSecond, each dependent variable had been created as the\nmean of separate partial estimates \u00ad four separate esti-\nmates of drug injectors per capita [30] and two separate\nestimates for HIV prevalence [33]. We thus re-ran the\nanalyses separately using each of the separate partial\nestimates in turn as the dependent variable.\nBetween analyses removing the extreme values and those\nusing the separate partial estimates, the sensitivity analyses\nproduced three separate regression equations for HIV\nprevalence, each of which estimated the regression\ncoefficients for each of the three indicators of repres-\nsiveness, and five equations for injectors per capita. The\nnine estimated parameters for HIV prevalence were all\npositive in the three sensitivity regressions for that\ndependent variable, with seven of them significantly so.\nNone of the 15 parameters in the five sensitivity\nregressions for injectors per capita was significantly diffe-\nrent from zero.\nWe then compared the parameter estimates for the new\nequations with those in the original run, using t-tests and\nTable 2.

Of the 24 compari-\nsons, one was significant at P < 0.05, and another at\nP < 0.10, which is approximately what would be\nexpected from a set of random numbers. Thus, the\nmodels do not appear to be very sensitive to likely errors\nin the dependent variables.\nDiscussion\nLegal repressiveness is not independently associated with\nhigher rates of injectors in metropolitan populations but is\nassociated with higher HIV prevalence among injectors.\nThese findings are subject to a number of limitations.\nFirst, causal mechanisms are hard to study at a single level\nof analysis as both higher-level and lower-level variables\nmay affect observed relationships. Similarly, although\nalmost all independent variables precede the dependent\nvariables in time, all variables are subject to considerable\ntemporal autocorrelation. Thus, causal inference would\nhave been stronger if longitudinal data had been used.\nSuch analyses are planned for the relatively near future,\nincluding further study of the possibly two-directional\nrelationships between legal repressiveness and injectors\nper capita. `Police employees per capita' is not the same as\npolice on duty in drug-using areas or in drug squads,\nwhich may or may not have attenuated the effects of this\nvariable. As police squads that exclusively target drug\nactivities have been found to have particularly deleterious\neffects on HIV risk behaviors [10], future research should\nstudy the effects of particular categories of police\npersonnel on drug injection and on HIV.\nThese data offer no support for deterrence theories that\nhold that legal repressiveness reduces levels of injection\ndrug use since the multiple regression coefficients had\npseudo-P values above 0.2. In this, they parallel the\nfindings of Reinarman et al. [51] that legal repressiveness\nis not associated with patterns of cannabis or other drug\nuse (among cannabis users) in a comparison of two cities\nwith different drug policies.\nThe main finding of this paper is that higher rates of three\nmeasures of legal repressiveness are associated with higher\nHIV prevalence among injectors. This may be because\nfear of arrest and/or punishment leads drug injectors to\nhurriedly [9,10,16] or to inject in shooting galleries or\nother multiperson injection settings [53] to escape\ndetection. Numerous studies have found that hurried\ninjection and injection in shooting galleries and similar\nlocations, as well as injecting while incarcerated [54,55],\nare associated with riskier injection practices\nthe association between police employees per capita and\nHIV prevalence suggests that the total size of police\ndepartments may be an important factor in heightening\nthese risks. In addition, the stigmatization side of legal\nrepressiveness may create, among drug users, lowered self-\nconcepts and other psychological or social conditions\nconducive of greater risk [56]; and may lead to public\nopinion that makes it more difficult to set up, fund, or find\nlocations for syringe exchanges and drug treatment\nIt is critical to note that although large numbers of police\nemployees and high expenditures on corrections may\ngenerally be associated with high rates of HIV among\ninjectors, they do not always preclude implementation of\neffective HIV prevention programs. Although New York\nCity is high on the measures of legal repressiveness, New\nYork State legalized and funded large-scale syringe\nexchange programs carried out by non-profit organiz-\nreduction in HIV incidence among IDUs in the city [59].\nFrom our experience, we would suggest that the\ndevelopment of co-operative working relationships\nbetween public health authorities and law enforcement\nauthorities to promote HIV prevention programs for\nIDUs was crucial. Although policy and legal changes\nfacilitated this co-operation, the existence of co-\noperation at the street level was key to this success.\nThe implications of this paper are clear. In terms of\nresearch, more study is needed to determine the sequelae\nof legal repressiveness (including determining whether\nthe associations found in this paper are causal) and the\nmechanisms through which these sequelae arise. In terms\nof policy and practice, these findings suggest that legal\nrepressiveness may have little deterrent effect on drug\ninjection and may have a high cost in terms of HIV and\nperhaps other diseases among injectors, their partners,\nand the broader community, and that alternative methods\nof maintaining social order should be investigated.\n"
