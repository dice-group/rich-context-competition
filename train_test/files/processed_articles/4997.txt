We\nthus aimed to evaluate and compare three different assays for the detection of IFX and ADAs\nand to clarify the impact of the presence of circulating IFX on the accuracy of the ADA assays.\nMethods: Blood samples from 79 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients treated with infliximab were\nassessed for IFX levels and ADAs using three different assays: an in-house assay and two\ncommercial kits, Immundiagnostik and Theradiag. Sera samples with ADAs and undetectable\nlevels of IFX were spiked with exogenous IFX and analyzed for ADAs.\nResults: The three assays showed 81\u00ad96% agreement for the measured IFX level. However,\nthe in-house assay and Immundiagnostik assays detected ADAs in 34 out of 79 samples,\nwhereas Theradiag only detected ADAs in 24 samples. Samples negative for ADAs with\nTheradiag, but ADA-positive in both the in-house and Immundiagnostik assays, were positive\nfor IFX or IgG4 ADAs. In spiking experiments, a low concentration of exogenous IFX (5 \u00b5g/\nml) hampered ADA detection with Theradiag in sera samples with ADA levels of between 3\nand 10 \u00b5g/ml. In the Immundiagnostik assay detection interference was only observed at\nconcentrations of exogenous IFX higher than 30 \u00b5g/ml. However, in samples with high levels\nof ADAs (>25 \u00b5g/ml) interference was only observed at IFX concentrations higher than 100 \u00b5g/\nml in all three assays. Binary (IFX/ADA) stratification of the results showed that IFX+/ADA-\nand IFX-/ADAs+ were less influenced by the assay results than the double-positive (IFX+/\nADAs+) and double-negative (IFX-/ADAs-) combination.\nConclusions: All three methodologies are equally suitable for measuring IFX levels. However,\nerroneous therapeutic decisions may occur when patients show double-negative (IFX-/ADAs-\n) or double-positive (IFX+/ADAs+) status, since agreement between assays is significantly\nlower in these circumstances.\n",

Indeed, a rational evidence-\nbased and tailored therapy according to individual\nneeds may reduce delays in effective treatment\nAwareness of the value of TDM has led to the\ndevelopment of different techniques for assessing\nlevels of infliximab and anti-infliximab antibodies\n(ADA) in patients, but these different methodol-\nogies have distinctive limitations and may yield\ndifferent results. This potential bias may have a\nsignificant impact on TDM results and interpre-\ntation. There is still little information allowing us\nto compare different assays, in particular in rela-\ntion to ADAs detection, which is likely to be sub-\nject to interference by detectable levels of IFX\nIn order to incorporate therapeutic drug moni-\ntoring into clinical practice it is pertinent to\nrecognize the potential for assay heterogeneity\nand accuracy.

Compari-\nsons showed that ICC varied from a moderate\nImmundiagnostik and Theradiag up to an excel-\nthe in-house ELISA and Immundiagnostik kit.\nJ Afonso, S Lopes et al.\nMean differences (bias) confirmed the ICC evalu-\nation. Moreover, a Bland and Altman plot analysis\n(graphics not shown) indicate that the significant\nbias between in-house and Theradiag is a result of\ndispersion of values along all of infliximab concen-\ntration, even for minor concentrations. Regarding\nin-house and Immundiagnostik, bias is more sig-\nnificant for concentrations higher than 15 \u00b5g/ml.\nThe Pearson correlation between different assays\nin-house versus Immundiagnostik.\nIn order to quantify the qualitative agreement of\nthe different methods, two different cutoffs were\napplied to the measured concentrations: one used\nthe limit of detection determined by the manufac-\nturers for each assay as the cutoff, conveying an\nanalytical perspective; and the other used clini-\ncally relevant cutoffs, as defined in the literature\nRegarding the analytical approach, IFX was con-\nsidered positive when above 0.1 \u00b5g/ml using the\nin-house and Theradiag methods.

However, different methodologies\nreturn different results. There is still little informa-\ntion comparing different assays, in particular for\nADA detection, which is susceptible to interfer-\nence in the presence of detectable levels of IFX.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate and com-\npare three different assays for detecting IFX and\nADAs and to clarify the importance of the pres-\nence of detectable levels of IFX on the accuracy\nof the ADA assays.\nCutoffs for a qualitative evaluation of the assays\nare difficult to establish, particularly for ADAs\nassays. In fact, ADAs results are expressed in dif-\nferent units by the different assays. In addition,\nImmundiagnostik defines a cutoff for positivity\nthat is different from the limit of detection and not\nsuggested by all commercial assays. The manufac-\nturers' instruction for Theradiag do not contain\nany suggestion for a cutoff for ADAs positivity\nbesides the limit of detection of 0.01 \u00b5g/ml. Van\nSchouwenburg and colleagues have shown that BE\nassays (Theradiag methodology) performance is\ndepend not only of the amount of antibody in the\nserum but also of the affinity of ADAs to the assay\n[Van Schouwenburg et al. 2016]. This indicates a\npossible source of intervariability of the assay,\nnamely for values near the limit of detection. In\nfact, our results show that with Theradiag 70% of\nthe values considered to be positive, with analytical\nmight be a reflection of the intervariability of the\nassay, rather than a faithful quantification of the\npresence of antibodies. Taking this into considera-\ntion, we have decided to perform two different\napproaches in the qualitative analyses of the results:\nan analytical one, in which cutoffs were defined by\nthe manufacturers' instructions; and a clinical one,\nin which the cutoffs were defined according to the\nliterature.\nFrom an analytical perspective, IFX assays\nshowed a substantial agreement and a good\naccuracy, although the in-house and Theradiag\nmethods had only a moderate agreement. On the\nother hand, upon applying a cutoff of 1 \u00b5g/ml,\nthe behavior of the three assays is very similar.\nTable 6.

Levels of IFX and IgG4 in samples that were\nADA-negative in Theradiag and ADA-positive in both\nthe in-house and Immundiagnostik assays.\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 9(6)\nThis suggests that using the limit of detection as\na cutoff may decrease the quality agreement\nbetween assays.\nThe behavior of the three assays in terms of IFX\ndetermination was very similar. In fact, an accu-\nracy of over 92% for IFX was observed when ana-\nlyzing the agreement between the three assays. An\nagreement of 100% (data not shown) was\nobserved between the in-house and\nImmundiagnostik assays for IFX-negative sam-\nples, while the Theradiag assay identified four\nIFX-positive samples that the other two assays\nreturned as negative. Casteele and colleagues also\nevaluated three IFX assays based on the sandwich\nELISA principle and found good correlation\nbetween them [Casteele et al. 2012]. The authors\nused the same commercial kit as used here\n(Theradiag). In fact, Theradiag returned 11 posi-\ntive samples that were negative according to the\nother two assays, showing that this assay can\ndetect nonspecific binding. Overall, high titers in\none assay were also high in the other two assays.\nNevertheless, the Immundiagnostik and in-house\nassays were able to detect higher levels of IFX in\nsera samples, which may indicate the use of a\nmore specific anti-human IgG antibody in the\ndetection step in these assays than in Theradiag.\nThe agreement between the three assays seemed\nto be more qualitative than quantitative. The\nthree methodologies use the same ELISA sand-\nwich principle, but there are some idiosyncratic\ndifferences that can explain the small discrepan-\ncies in quantitative evaluation: different detection\nlimits and test sensitivity; reagent stability; differ-\nent calibration standards and curve adjustment;\nand different sample dilution, manipulation and\nprocessing (e.g. different incubation times).\nNevertheless, from a clinical point of view, the\ninformation given by the three assays (presence of\npositive/negative levels; low/therapeutic/high lev-\nels of the drug) showed acceptable interassay\nagreement. However, clinicians should be aware\nthat changing drug level assays during patient fol-\nlow up could induce errors in the interpretation of\nresults and subsequent therapeutic strategies.\nADAs were evaluated using three methodologies:\nin-house AHLC, Immundiagnostik SFPE and\nTheradiag BE. These three assays have different\nmethodological principles. The in-house AHLC\nis a sandwich ELISA that uses anti-human\nlambda chain conjugate antibody in the detection\nstep, benefitting from IFX kappa chain exclusive\ncomposition [Kopylov et al. 2012]. The Theradiag\nBE uses a double-antigen bridge: ADAs create a\nbridge between IFX immobilized on the plate\nand IFX enzyme-linked conjugate. The\nImmundiagnostik SFPE uses an initial acid buffer\ntreatment to dissociate the IFX\u00adADA immune\ncomplexes and two IFX conjugates with different\ntypes of conjugates. Acidified samples are incu-\nbated with an IFX\u00adbiotin conjugate, which\nimmobilizes ADAs to the plate, whilst an IFX\u00ad\nperoxidase conjugate is used for detection.\nA total of 79 samples of sera were compared using\nthe three assays. The analytical approach showed\nthe same moderate agreement for the three assays\nthan the clinical approach. However, and from\nthe analytical perspective, Theradiag was able to\ndetect 37 positive ADAs, whereas from a clinical\nperspective only 24 patients were considered to\nbe positive for ADAs. Conversely, the in-house\nassay detected almost the same number of ADA-\npositive patients with the two approaches (34 for\nanalytical versus 37 for clinical). The results\nobtained using a clinical perspective with the\nTheradiag kit suggest a high rate of false-negative\noutcomes. This high prevalence of false-negative\noutcomes with Theradiag was reported previ-\nously by other authors [Imaeda et al. 2012;\nSteenholdt et al. 2013]. Kopylov and colleagues\nreported that BE was unable to detect ADAs in\nthe presence of IFX [Kopylov et al. 2012]. Our\nresults showed that 22 out of 24 ADA-positive\nsamples were IFX-negative. Only three patients\nshowed a double-positive status with Theradiag,\nhowever neither was confirmed as IFX-positive in\nthe in-house or Immundiagnostik assay. These\nsamples were probably false positive for IFX. In\nfact, the disagreement of the in-house and\nImmundiagnostik assay with Theradiag for dou-\nble-positive status (IFX+/ADAs+) was 100%.\nSince Theradiag uses labeled IFX as the detec-\ntion antibody, the presence of IFX may compete\nwith the detection of the ADAs. On the other\nhand, the BE is unable to detect monovalent\nIgG4 ADAs, contributing to the false-negative\nresults. Our results were consistent with these two\nstatements and showed that samples positive for\nADAs with the in-house and Immundiagnostik\nassays, but negative with Theradiag, one of two\nsituations occurred: (i) sera samples were IFX-\npositive; or (ii) ADAs were IgG4 antibodies. The\ninability to detect antibodies in the presence of\nthe drug is important as two recent studies have\nshown that patients with IFX levels >3 \u00b5g/ml but\nwith positive ADA have significantly higher levels\nof C-reactive protein (CRP) and less mucosal\nJ Afonso, S Lopes et al.\nindicating a reduced control of inflammation\nmediated by these antibodies even when drug lev-\nels are adequate.\nIn order to understand the influence of drug pres-\nence on ADA detection, we designed an experi-\nment using IFX-negative sera that were incubated\nwith different concentrations of exogenous IFX.\nThe in-house assay was slightly affected by 5 \u00b5g/ml\nexogenous infliximab but was able to detect anti-\nbodies up to 100 \u00b5g/ml of IFX. Kopylov and col-\nleagues described the same drug concentration\ndependency for the AHLC assay [Kopylov et al.\n2012]. However, our results permit us to define\nwhich concentration of IFX decrease the assay\ncapacitytodetermineADAs.TheImmundiagnostik\nassay showed the best behavior in the presence of\nexogenous IFX. Interference was observed above\n100 \u00b5g/ml of exogenous IFX but the assay was able\nto detect ADAs even at the higher concentration of\n300 \u00b5g/ml of IFX. However, the results obtained in\nsera with high levels of ADAs were surprising and\nto the best of the authors' knowledge have not\nbeen reported previously. Even the Theradiag BE,\nwhich is widely described as being unable to detect\nantibodies in the presence of the drug, was able to\nidentify ADA-positive samples in the presence of\nhigh levels of exogenous IFX. The results indi-\ncated that assays are not only limited by the levels\nof drug in the sera but also by the concentration of\nADAs. These phenomena could be explained as\nfollows: (i) in Theradiag, ADAs bind to all free\ndrug in serum but there is still enough ADAs to\nbind to the plated IFX and bridge it to the conju-\ngated one; (ii) in Immundiagnostik high levels of\nADAs are most likely to diminish free IFX\ninterference.\nIn summary, for IFX drug level determination,\nthe three methodologies are equivalent, however\nthe agreement between them seems to be more\nqualitative than quantitative. Regarding ADAs,\ndespite being equally effective, the three assays\nshow significant differences. Disagreement\nincreased when samples had a double-positive or\ndouble-negative status, probably related to the\nspecific limitations of each assay. The choice of\ncutoff to discriminate positive versus negative also\nenhances disagreement. This led us to define two\ndifferent approaches with different cutoffs and\npresent both evaluations. Clinical approach seems\nto highlight inabilities of the assays. In fact,\nTheradiag showed inability to detect positive\nADA levels in samples with IFX (<5 \u00b5g/ml) or a\nhigh percentage of IgG4 ADAs. IgG4 ADAs are\nmonovalent and unable to create a bridge with the\nlabeled IFX used in detection step. In contrast,\nboth the in-house assay and the Immundiagnostik\nassay are able to detect ADAs in the presence of\nIFX up to levels of >100 \u00b5g/ml which conform\nwith the therapeutic concentrations observed in\npatients receiving IFX. Unexpectedly, in samples\nwith high levels of ADAs (>25 \u00b5g/ml), the pres-\nence of IFX was not as important and even\nTheradiag was able to detect antibodies.\nNevertheless, Immundiagnostik was least affected\nby IFX, followed by the in-house assay. In conclu-\nsion, our results indicated that assays are not only\nlimited by the levels of drug in the sera but also by\nthe concentration of ADAs.\nClinicians must be aware when optimizing treat-\nment that binary (IFX/ADAs) stratification of\nresults as positive and negative can differ accord-\ning to the assay used. There is a strong agreement\nbetween assays for IFX+/ADAs- and IFX-/\nADAs+ status. The choice of assay will probably\nhave little influence on therapeutic decisions to\nchange the class of drug (IFX+/ADA-) or change\nanti-TNF antibody (IFX-/ADAs+). However,\nerroneous therapeutic decisions may occur when\npatients show double-negative or double-positive\nstatus, since agreement between assays is signifi-\ncantly lower in these circumstances. Treatment\nintensification (IFX-/ADAs-) and change of drug\nclass or concomitant use of immunomodulators\n(IFX+/ADAs+) should take into account the fact\nthat the results are assay dependent.\n"
