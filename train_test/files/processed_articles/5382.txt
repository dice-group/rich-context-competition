We also reported that treat-\nment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) increased the UNa\nV during the daytime, and restored the non-dipper\nblood pressure (BP) rhythm into a dipper pattern. However, the circadian rhythm of UK\nV during ARB treatment has not\nbeen reported.\nMaterials and methods: Circadian rhythms of UNa\nV and UK\nV were examined in 44 patients with CKD undergoing treat-\nment with ARB.\nResults: Whole-day UNa\nV was not altered by ARB whereas whole-day UK\nV decreased. Even during the ARB treatment,\nthe significant relationship persisted between the night/day ratios of UNa\nV and UK\nV/\nV ratio (p=0.0007) and trans-tubular potassium concentration gradient (p=0.002) were attenuated but their night/\nday ratios remained unchanged. The change in the night/day UK\nV ratio correlated directly with the change in night/day\nV ratio (F=20.4) rather than with the changes in aldosterone, BP or creatinine clearance.\nConclusions: The circadian rhythm of UK\nV was determined by the rhythm of UNa\nV even during ARB treatment. Changes\nin the circadian UK\nV rhythm were not determined by aldosterone but by UNa\nV.\n",

The study was approved by the ethics review\ncommittee of Nagoya City University Graduate School of\nMedical Sciences, and was conducted in accordance with\nthe Declaration of Helsinki, as with our previous report.6\u00ad10\nwere enrolled consecutively after providing informed\nconsent.\nStudy protocol\nThe subjects received nutritional instructions to eat a regu-\nlar sodium diet containing <8 g/day of salt for at least four\nweeks before enrollment. Twenty-four hour ambulatory\nBP monitoring (ABPM) and urinary sampling were per-\nformed on the last day of a seven-day hospitalization\nperiod, during which subject diets included 7.0 and 1.3\u00ad\n2.0 g/day of sodium chloride and potassium, respectively.\nThe diet provided 30\u00ad50 g protein per day. The subjects\nThroughout the study period, no additional medications or\nchanges in the dosages of concomitant drugs were allowed.\nAfter the baseline examinations, the participants received\nsingle daily doses of an ARB, olmesartan, in the morning.\nThe dose of olmesartan medoxomil was increased to the\nhighest possible dose (2.5\u00ad40 mg/day) in order to attain\nBP was monitored noninvasively every 30 min using a\nvalidated automatic device (model ES-H531, Terumo,\nTokyo, Japan) with a standard BP cuff (240 mm long and\n130 mm wide; Japanese Industrial Standards) on the last\nday of a seven-day hospitalization period at the baseline\nand eight weeks after treatment with olmesartan. The BP\nvalues were not considered valid for analysis, if data\nwere missing continuously for 2 h, or if the patients\nawoke during the night and had difficulty falling asleep\nagain. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as\ndiastolic BP plus one-third of the pulse BP. Daytime BP\nwas calculated as the average of the 30 readings between\nremaining 18 readings. The night/day MAP ratio was\nobtained as the ratio of the above averages as an indicator\nof the circadian BP rhythm. Nocturnal hypertension was\ndefined as a night-time BP of >120/70 mmHg and the\nnon-dipper BP rhythm defined as a night/day MAP of\n>0.9. Urinary samples were collected for both daytime\ncircadian rhythm of urinary excretion rates of sodium\n(UNa\nV, mmol/hr) and potassium (UK\nV, mmol/hr). In par-\nticular, an increase in UK\nV ratio is known to reflect\nthe effect of aldosterone on renal tubular reabsorption of\nNa and secretion of K at the primary sites of potassium\nsecretion.15 The trans-tubular potassium concentration\ngradient (TTKG) was calculated as follows:16\n)/(Uosm\n/Posm\n)\nWhere, UK\n, PK\n, Uosm\nand Posm\nwere the urine and serum\npotassium concentration, and urine and serum osmolality,\nrespectively. The collected urine samples were combined\nto calculate the 24 h creatinine clearance (CCr\n, ml/min),\nwhich was used as a measure of glomerular filtration rate.\nThe adequacy of 24 h urine collection was judged by the\namount of urinary creatinine excretion: for men aged <50\nIncomplete or excessive urine collection in either the day-\ntime or night-time samples were judged on the basis of the\nnight/day ratio of the urinary creatinine excretion rate <0.5\nor >2.0. Blood samples were collected only once at 6:00,\nwhich was the marginal point between the daytime and\nnight-time. To evaluate plasma renin activity (PRA), and\nplasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), blood samples\nfrozen immediately and stored at \u00ad35\u00b0C until assay. PRA\nand PAC were then determined using radioimmunoassay at\nan external analysis center (SRL, Inc., Hachioji, Japan).\nStatistical analysis\nThe results are expressed as the mean\u00b1standard deviation\n(SD). Data distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test, and variables that were not normally dis-\ntributed were analyzed after log-transformation. The\ndifferences in parameters between baseline and ARB\ntreatment were examined using the Student's t-test for\npaired samples. Correlations among variables were\nevaluated by the least-squares method. Relationships\nbetween the changes in the variables were analyzed by\nlinear regression through the origin. Stepwise forward\nmultiple regression analysis was also applied to identify\nthe factors that contributed independently to the decreases\nin night/day UK\nV ratio by ARB. p-values <0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nThe demographics of the study participants are shown in\nTable 1.

Consistent with our previous report,5 the\nnight/day UK\nV ratio exhibited an inverse relationship with\nday UNa\nUK\nV correlated directly with whole day TTKG\nEffects of ARB\nAs shown in Table 1, the ARB decreased the night/day\nratios of SBP, DBP, MAP, UNa\nV and UK\nV. During the treat-\nment with ARB, 20 subjects (45%) exhibited the non-dip-\nper BP rhythm. Specifically, among 32 patients whose\ncircadian BP rhythm was non-dipper at baseline, the BP\nrhythm restored into dipper pattern in 14 patients but\nremained non-dipper in 18 patients. On the other hand,\namong 12 patients whose circadian BP rhythm was dipper\nat baseline, 10 patients remained dippers and two patients\nturned into non-dippers. Whole-day UNa\nV was not altered\nby ARB, reflecting the constant amount of sodium\nintake. On the other hand, whole-day values of UK\nV were\ndecreased. ARB significantly decreased both daytime and\nnight-time UK\nV and increased daytime UNa\nV but night-time\nV was unchanged. Consequently, ARB decreased the\nnight/day ratios of UNa\nand UK\ndaytime and night-time values of urine volume (V, ml/h)\nThe night/day ratio of urine volume was also significantly\nreduced (p=0.05): the ratio correlated directly with that of\nUK\nwith night/day UK\nV ratio during theARB treatment (r=0.29,\np=0.05). Whole day, and daytime values of urinary osmolar\nexcretion rate (Uosm\nV, mOsm/h) were not altered by ARB\n(p=0.3, and 0.5, respectively), whereas night-time Uosm\nV\nsignificantly decreased (p=0.002). Even during the ARB\ntreatment, the significant relationship persisted between the\nnight/day ratios of UNa\nV and UK\nFigure 1). Whole-day, daytime and night-time values of\nboth UK\nV and TTKG were all attenuated by ARB\ntreatment. Even during the ARB treatment, whole day\nUK\nV correlated directly with whole day TTKG\nV\nand TTKG were unchanged. Multiple regression analysis\nday ratio of UK\nV was determined by the change in night/\nday UNa\nV ratio (F=21.3), rather than the changes in\naldosterone (F=0.5), CCr\nV/\nV ratio (F=0.4), or the night/day MAP ratio (F=1.3).\nDiscussion\nThe present study demonstrated that the circadian rhythm\nof UK\nV was associated with the rhythm of UNa\nV before and\nduring the treatment with ARB. ARB decreased the UK\nV/\nV and TTKG, indicating that the ARB could diminish\nthe effect of aldosterone on renal tubular reabsorption of\nNa+ and secretion of K+ at the primary sites of potassium\nsecretion. However, the change in the night/day ratio of\nUK\nV was determined by the change in night/day UNa\nV\nratio, rather than the changes in aldosterone, CCr\nUK\nV ratio, or the night/day MAP ratio.\nPotassium is excreted into urine primarily through\nsecretion from tubular cells rather than filtration across the\nglomerular capillary wall because almost all of the filtered\npotassium is reabsorbed passively by the proximal tubule\nand loop of Henle: and potassium is secreted into urine\nfrom the principal cells of the cortical collecting tubules\nand from the cells in the adjacent connecting segment or\nouter medullary collecting tubules.17 Under physiologic\nconditions, tubular potassium secretion is mediated by\naldosterone, the plasma potassium concentration, the distal\nflow rate and the transepithelial potential difference: in the\npresence of aldosterone, tubular potassium secretion is\nenhanced as the delivery of sodium to the distal nephrons\nis augmented.18\u00ad22 On the basis of these findings, we\nFigure 1. Relationship between the night/day ratios of urinary\nexcretion of sodium and potassium before and during treatment\nwith angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).The night/day urinary\npotassium excretion (UK\nV) ratio correlated directly with night/\nday urinary sodium excretion (UNa\nV) ratio before and during\ntreatment with the ARB.

The ratio cannot strictly\nrepresent the relationship between distal flow and potassium\nsecretion but an increase can roughly indicate the effect of\naldosterone on renal tubular potassium secretion. The pre-\nsent study demonstrated that 24 h values of the UK\nV\nratio and TTKG were attenuated, indicating that the ARB\nalso reduced the sodium reabsorption via epithelial sodium\nchannels (ENaCs). In fact, ARBs are known to diminish\nthe secretion of adrenal aldosterone, and to decrease the\nnumber23 and activity24 of ENaCs, independent of circulat-\ning aldosterone. Interestingly, during the ARB treatment,\nthe night/day ratio of TTKG and UK\nV were both\nunchanged and the change in the circadian UK\nV rhythm\nwas not attributed to the change in UK\nV ratio or\nTTKG, but was determined by the change in the circadian\nV rhythm.\nThe present study has some limitations. It was reported\nthat aldosterone can contribute to UK\nV only under the con-\ndition of supraphysiologic levels due to hyperkalemia.25 In\naddition, recently, it was reported that dietary potassium\nintake was sensed in the gut, and an unidentified gut factor\nis activated to stimulate renal potassium.26 Dietary potas-\nsium was constant and relatively low in this study proto-\ncol. Potassium can also be secreted into feces (5\u00ad10 mmol/\nday) and sweat (0\u00ad10 mmol/day). As renal function dete-\nriorates, aldosterone secretion is stimulated independent of\nangiotensin,27 resulting in enhanced potassium excretion\ninto feces.28 Therefore, we could not confirm the amount\nof potassium intake or total body potassium balance, based\nsolely on the 24 h UK\nV. During the data collection period,\nthe amount of dietary sodium, potassium and protein were\nconstant for individual subject. However, because we\nmeasured data only at the single point, potential day-to-\nday variability of BP or urinary electrolytes excretion\ncould not be considered.\nIn conclusion, the present study is the first to report that\nin patients with CKD, changes in the circadian rhythm of\nUK\nV during ARB treatment were based on the change in\ncircadian UNa\nV rhythm, rather than the changes in aldoster-\none, CCr\nV ratio or circadian BP rhythm.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
