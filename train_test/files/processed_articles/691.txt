This article examines how financial strain and social relations may independently and jointly influence\npsychological distress among older people in four nations.\nMethods. Data from four Western Pacific nations (N = 3,277) are used to test additive and multiplicative models of\nthe relationships between financial strain, social relations, and psychological distress.\nResults. Financial strain is associated with higher levels of psychological distress in three of the four nations. Inter-\nactive models of the effects of financial strain and social relations on distress were uncovered in three of the four na-\ntions, but the type of social relation influencing the strain-distress relationship varied. Subjective health and IADLs\nwere significant predictors of psychological distress in all four nations.\nDiscussion. Findings suggest that although financial strain is quite likely to lead to psychological distress among el-\nders, this can be mitigated, at least in part, by social relationships. Modernization was not associated with higher psy-\nchological distress.\nTHE question of how social relations influence the psy-\nchological distress of elders has attracted considerable\nattention in the past two decades, much of it as part of the\navalanche of research on caregiving. The findings from this\nliterature have been both insightful and inconsistent. Per-\nhaps the greatest inconsistencies arise regarding the effects\nof social exchanges on morale and well-being. Some stud-\nies have shown that giving aid increases elders' psycholog-\nical well-being (Stoller, 1985), whereas others have shown\nthat giving aid decreases elders' psychological well-being\n(Mutran & Reitzes, 1984). Findings concerning the receipt\nof aid are also inconsistent. The link between receiving aid\nand psychological well-being has been reported as positive\n(Mutran & Reitzes, 1984), negative (Lee, Netzer, & Cow-\nAlthough the inconsistency in findings from the litera-\nture points to the need for further research, there have also\nbeen notable insights from research in the past decade. We\nsuggest that four recurrent findings are especially useful for\nresolving the inconsistencies and advancing the research,\nespecially as it pertains to the link between social relations\nand psychological distress. First, it is now clear that the\ncomplexity of social relations makes it imperative to differ-\nentiate integration in social structures from relational con-\ntent (House, Umberson, & Landis, 1988). Social integra-\ntion refers to the quantity of relations and frequency of\ncontact, whereas relational contact refers to social ex-\nchanges and the quality of relations (Schwarzer & Leppin,\n1991). With this distinction in mind, the literature points\nincreasingly to how social integration influences the types\nand consequences of exchange. A second major finding\nfrom the literature is importance of negative interactions in\nheightening psychological distress among older adults\n(Krause, 1995; Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, & Antonucci,\n1997). Negative interactions are less prevalent as age in-\ncreases, but more consequential to psychological distress\nis related to psychological distress and may also shape the\ncontent of social relations (Krause & Liang, 1993; Whelan,\n1993). The material wealth of an elder may well compen-\nsate for aid received in other domains because the cost to\nthe other partner(s) is minimized.\nFinally, although main effects of social relations on psy-\nchological distress are anticipated (Schwarzer & Leppin,\n1991), recent research shows the importance of testing con-\nditional relationships. The types of conditional relations\nuncovered vary, but two forms have been noted repeatedly.\nFirst, psychological distress among older people is often\ninfluenced by the interaction of giving and receiving (e.g.,\nKrause, 1995). If people give help, then the effect of re-\nceiving help is typically positive (i.e., balanced exchange\nrelations). On the other hand, if the older person is unable\nto offer assistance, then receiving help may lead to a nega-\ntive outcome (Wethington & Kessler, 1986). Second, social\nrelations often interact with stressors in shaping psycholog-\nical distress. Beyond what one would expect on the basis of\nmain effects, previous research has shown that social rela-\ntions are likely to moderate distress as people face health\nproblems, the death of a spouse, or financial strain (e.g.,\nMoreover, financial strain involves anxiety about subsis-\ntence but it may also lead to problems in social function-\ning, especially with family and friends (Krause & Liang,\n1993). Thus, social integration and exchange are important\nfor understanding how financial strain influences psycho-\nlogical distress.\nMost of these recent contributions to the understanding\nof social relations and psychological distress derive from\nstudies in the United States or other modern, Western soci-\neties. In contrast, the present study uses a cross-cultural\nperspective for understanding how social relations influ-\nence psychological distress among older people. Given the\ndearth of studies examining the joint effects of financial\nstrain and social relations on psychological distress, these\nrelationships are highlighted here. The rationale for the\ncomparative analysis of four Western Pacific nations is\ntwofold.\nFirst, the comparative perspective may shed new light on\nthe understanding of social relations and psychological dis-\ntress, especially discussions of the universality of cross-\ngenerational support and its consequences for older adults\n(Bengtson, 1995). There are studies that examine social re-\nlations and either well-being or distress in other developed\ncountries such as France (Grand, Grosclaude, Bocquet,\namong Korean immigrants to Canada (Noh, Wu, & Avison,\n1994), but little attention has been given to less-developed\nnations. Moreover, cross-cultural studies of these relation-\nships, especially quantitative ones, are rare (Krause, Jay, &\nLiang, 1991). The approach taken here is to determine\nwhether social relations influence psychological distress\nin a similar way among older adults in diverse societies\n(Hashimoto, 1993). The strategy is to \"increase the diver-\nsity in sociocultural factors and look beyond the boundaries\nconsistent across societies and observed in the extant litera-\nture merit special attention.\nSecond, Dowd's (1975) widely cited article on develop-\ning a social exchange theory of aging concluded by offering\ntwo propositions, one of which focused on the comparative\napproach. Noting how exchanges may operate differently in\ntraditional and modern societies, Dowd argued that the\n\"amount of power resources possessed by the aged relative\nto other age strata is inversely related to the degree of soci-\ncase, elders in more modern societies may be especially\nvulnerable to financial strain and both social and economic\ndependency. The four nations studied in the present re-\nsearch are at different stages of modernization, thereby per-\nmitting us to examine how the effects of financial strain and\nsocial relations on psychological distress may vary by de-\ngree of societal development.\nAging and Exchange in Comparative Perspective\nAs people enter advanced old age, they face the risk of\nbecoming dependent on others for help. They may not face\nthe risk of dependency in every area of life--from finances\nto personal care--but the question of dependency is a piv-\notal one in the everyday lives of older people and has been\ndiscussed at length in several sociological theories of aging.\nSocial exchange theory focuses on the give-and-take of so-\ncial life, but does not presume that human interaction is a\nsimple matter of quid pro quo. Instead, stable relationships,\nespecially those among kin, are dependent to some degree\nupon investments in the relationships that may not be com-\npensated directly (Yamagishi & Cook, 1993). The willing-\nness to provide help to older people may be due to many\nreasons, but it is most often seen in light of the contribu-\ntions the elder has made over the life course. In a sense,\npeople develop \"credit\" from the contributions they make\nto others. Blau (1964) observed, \"As individuals regularly\ndischarge their obligations, they prove themselves trust-\nworthy of further credit\" (p. 98).\nAfter a lifetime of typically giving more to younger per-\nsons than they received from them, elders must increas-\ningly come to accept beneficence, especially if they lack\npower resources such as wealth (Dowd, 1984). The benefi-\ncence most often comes from family members--spouses,\nsiblings, adult children--but in some situations it may come\nfrom community or government initiatives. Although most\nelders have established social credit from past contribu-\ntions, receiving beneficence is nonetheless difficult for\nmany. Receiving beneficence reveals the commitment of\nthe giver to the elder, and this is often reassuring to the\nolder person (Krause, 1995). At the same time, however, it\nshows that the elder has less to offer to balance the relation-\nship (Wentowski, 1981). In cases where the elder perceives\nan imbalanced exchange, the inability to reciprocate may\nmake the elder feel awkward, and may perhaps even lead to\ndepressed affect. It appears elders have fared reasonably\nwell by drawing from social credit in traditional societies\nensues on whether this applies to non-Western societies and\nhow modernization may alter filial piety and the structure\nof beneficence to older people (Cox, 1990; Haber & Grat-\nFindings from major U.S. studies show that most elders\nhave at least one adult child living within 35 miles of them\nand that geographic location shapes not only face-to-face\ncontact but telephone contact and emotional support as well\n(Rossi & Rossi, 1990). The prevalence of routine assistance\nis described in most U.S. studies as \"modest,\" with between\n25% and 33% of all parents receiving some type of support\nfrom their adult children; advice and emotional support are\nthe most common (Bengtson & Harootyan, 1994; Eggebeen,\nadult children is generally less prevalent, but Cooney and\nUhlenberg (1992) show that the frequency of such aid varies\nsubstantially over the life course. Using data from the Na-\ntional Survey of Families and Households, they found a\nfairly sharp decline in support from parents after their chil-\ndren reached 30 years of age. The role of older American\nparents and grandparents appears to be that of providing\nhelp when major needs or emergencies arise, leading schol-\nars to describe them as \"family watchdogs\" (Troll, 1983) or\nthe \"family national guard\" (Hagestad, 1985).\nIn contrast to the United States and other Western na-\ntions, most Asian and Western Pacific nations display a\nmuch higher rate of intergenerational coresidence and a\ngreater flow of intergenerational support. Just how much of\nthis is due to modernization as opposed to filial piety and\ngenerational norms is difficult to determine, but even in\nmore modernized societies such as Japan, Hong Kong, and\nthe Republic of Korea, routine aid to elders is typically\nmore prevalent than in the West (Keith & Hong, 1994;\nKeith et al., 1994). Whatever the reason, the differences are\nstriking, especially with regard to financial exchanges.\nWhile only about 3^1-% of adult American children regu-\nlarly provide financial assistance to their parents (Egge-\nbeen, 1992), about one third of the Chinese elders in Krause\nand Liang's (1993) study reported such financial assistance.\nIn Shi's (1993) study of rural Chinese, approximately two\nthirds of the elders reported receiving financial aid (see also\nTreas & Wang, 1993). The rates are lower in Korea (Ahn,\nin most American families, suggesting the confluence of\nculture and modernization on intergenerational exchanges.\nModernization ushered in not only longer life, but a\nlonger period of \"old age,\" including retirement (Cowgill,\nPeople reaching advanced older ages in modern societies,\ntherefore, are more likely to risk depleting major power re-\nsources accumulated over the life course (Cox, 1990; Pal-\nfour basic power resources: money (and material goods),\napproval, esteem, and compliance. Compliance, or yielding\nto the will of others, is very costly, and is typically used as\na last resort in exchanges. Dowd (1975) argued that it may\nbe one of the few power resources that elders have avail-\nable for exchange relations. Compliance by elders usually\nmakes them more dependent, and their growing depen-\ndency may make them feel awkward. Indeed, some re-\nsearch shows that unbalanced relationships--when elders\nfeel that they are receiving more than they can give--have\ndetrimental effects on morale (e.g., Lee et al., 1995).\nAlthough money is but one of the power resources, it is\nclearly one of the most influential to exchange processes.\nMoreover, material wealth of an elder may well compen-\nsate for aid received in other domains. Krause and Liang\n(1993) showed that financial strain was the strongest pre-\ndictor of psychological distress among Chinese older per-\nsons, and Whelan (1993) reported a parallel finding in Ire-\nland. Despite the importance of financial adequacy to the\nexchange processes, most studies simply use education\nReitzes, 1984). These indicators are limited for understand-\ning socioeconomic status and exchange processes in a sin-\ngle country (Henretta & Campbell, 1976) and of limited\nutility in cross-cultural comparisons. The present study\nconsiders financial strain, along with aid given and aid re-\nceived, to understand how social relations influence psy-\nchological distress.\nTo summarize, the approach used in this article is com-\nparative, permitting an examination of how sociocultural\ncontext shapes the way in which social relations influence\npsychological distress. If relationships are found to exist in\neach of the four nations studied, this would provide evi-\ndence pointing to universality, or at least greater generaliz-\nability. We articulate several hypotheses for this investiga-\ntion. First, we hypothesize that financial strain is directly\nand positively related to psychological distress among older\nsistent with many previous studies, we hypothesize that\nsocial integration will be directly and negatively related to\nThird, because contributions to the social order by elders\noften help balance exchanges, we anticipate that elders who\ncontribute to family and community function will have\nFourth, we hypothesize that elders receiving family finan-\ncial support will have higher psychological distress, due to\nwhat Krause (1997) refers to as the \"downside of received\nsupport.\" Although receiving support may intuitively be\nseen as reducing distress--because of needs being met--\nthere is evidence from previous research that reception of\naid may carry with it a realization of growing dependency or\neven failure (Wethington & Kessler, 1986). Krause observes\nthat this downside of received support is even more likely\nwhen financial strain is the issue at hand. Fifth, we expect\nhigher psychological distress among elders in the more\nmodernized societies due to the emphasis upon productivity\nFinally, we expect that the effect of financial strain on\npsychological distress will be either dampened or exacer-\nbated by social relations. Three interaction hypotheses are\narticulated: (a) financial strain coupled with low levels of\nsocial integration will lead to higher psychological distress;\n(b) financially strained elders who report giving to family\nand community relationships will be less likely to manifest\ndistress; and (c) financially strained elders who report re-\nceiving family financial support will manifest higher psy-\nchological distress. Given the different social and cultural\ncontexts considered and multicollinearity among the prod-\nuct terms, it is unlikely that all three interaction hypotheses\nwill be supported in all nations. However, at least one form\nof social relations is expected to condition the effect of fi-\nnancial strain on psychological distress in each nation.\nMETHOD\nSample\nsurvey Social and Health Aspects of Aging in Fiji, Korea,\nMalaysia, and the Philippines (N = 3,577), which was spon-\nsored by the World Health Organization. The same ques-\ntionnaire was used to study older people living in house-\nholds in all four countries. To improve comprehension and\nvalidity of the questionnaire across different cultures, the\nquestionnaire for each nation was translated into the appro-\npriate language and dialect, and then back-translated into\nEnglish to compare the differences and minimize problems\nassociated with cultural differences (Andrews, Esterman,\nBraunack-Mayer, & Rungie, 1986). Different sampling de-\nsigns were used for each country, and response rates were\ngenerally quite high--over 90%, except for the urban\nPhilippines sample (metro Manila), which had a response\nrate of 83.5%. Although the survey was conducted more\nthan a decade ago, its suitability for cross-national compar-\nisons and tests of social theories of psychological distress\nmake it unique for the present study.\nThe Republic of Korea had the only multistage random\nsample designed to cover the entire country (N =981). The\nsurvey for Malaysia covered Peninsular Malaysia only, with\npurposive sampling of five subregions (N = 1,000; Andrews\net al., 1986). Malaysia is a multiethnic society; the three\nmain ethnic groups are Malays, Chinese, and Indians, but\nthe majority of the citizens from where this sample was\ndrawn are Malay Bumis (and Muslim). In the Philippines,\nthe Tagalog Region of Luzon (21% of the Philippine popu-\nlation) was sampled with a three-stage stratified cluster de-\nsign (N = 981). About two thirds of the Tagalog-region resi-\ndents live in urban areas, including metropolitan Manila,\nwhereas rural residence is predominant elsewhere in the\nPhilippines. Fiji is an archipelago of about 300 islands di-\nvided into four government geoadministrative areas. A mul-\ntistage sampling design within each area was applied so\nthat both urban and rural populations were represented (N =\n769). The samples, except in Fiji, were weighted to be rep-\nresentative of the populations for these areas for persons\naged 60 years and older, by sex, and by rural and urban res-\nEsterman and Andrews (1992) showed that living ar-\nrangements in the four countries are fairly similar: respon-\ndents \"Jived in households which had an average size rang-\ning from 5.1 persons in Malaysia to 6.0 in the Philippines\"\n(p. 276). There were relatively few elders who lived alone\nin these four countries during the time of the survey, and\nthis pattern persists in all four countries. The percentage of\nelders living alone ranges from 2.0% in both Fiji and\nPhilippines to 5.7% in Malaysia (where Islam specifies\nstrong family support). As suggested by Esterman and An-\ndrews (1992), this is in direct contrast to the situation in\nmost Western nations, where as many as 60% of elderly\npeople live alone.\nDespite the similarities in living arrangements, there is\nconsiderable variability in social structure and culture\namong the four nations, especially as pertains to the position\nrecently profiled the four nations on 11 ecological indicators\nTheir analysis showed that the Republic of Korea was\nclearly the most modernized of the four at the time of the\nsurvey; this was especially evident on indicators of energy\nconsumption, telephones, TV, and physicians per capita.\nAnn (1982) argued that the structural changes accompany-\ning modernization in Korea have decreased the influence of\nthe teachings of Confucius, especially as they relate to filial\npiety and respect for older people. The Philippines is proba-\nbly the least modernized of the four, and the Filipino value\nof \"utang-na-loob\" or thankfulness is widely applicable to\nparents, especially elderly parents (Abaya, 1982). Malaysia\nis probably closer to South Korea in terms of modernization\n(McCallum, 1992). Fiji is less developed and more similar\nto the Philippines except that filial piety and elder benefi-\ncence are not as salient in Fijian culture, perhaps due to a\nhistory that includes cannibalism, witchcraft, and a utilitar-\nian philosophy (McCallum, 1992; Williams & Calvert,\n1870). Fiji has been known as the \"Cannibal Isles\" because\ncannibalism was observed there even into the mid-to-late\n19th century (the practice was customary to show revenge\nover adversaries or to dedicate a temple; Williams &\nof important change during the decade (e.g., declining infant\nmortality, increasing urbanization), but the level of modern-\nSubjects were screened for eligibility based on psychi-\natric impairment. The measures of psychiatric impairment\nincluded \"hearing things that other people could not,\" \"see-\ning things that other people could not,\" \"believ[ing] that\nother people are watching you, or spying on you, or plot-\nting against you,\" and \"feel[ing] that special messages are\nbeing sent to you on the TV or radio.\" Twenty-nine percent\nof the sample reported one or more of these symptoms.\nGiven cultural differences in the interpretation of these\nitems and the widespread practice of witchcraft in Fiji and\nmysticism in several of the countries, respondents who re-\nported three or more problems of psychiatric impairment\nwere deleted from the analysis. Using this decision rule, a\ntotal of 208 (6%) cases were deleted from the analysis be-\ncause of psychiatric impairment that might affect the valid-\nity and reliability of responses on other items (most of these\ncases were from Fiji and Korea).\nThe present analysis is based on a sample of 3,277 non-\nof all respondents are female. As one might expect, popula-\ntion age parallels levels of modernization, and this is re-\nflected in the study samples. The average age for all respon-\ndents is 70.24 years, but Koreans and Malaysians are\nslightly older than Filipinos and Fijians. Educational attain-\nment among respondents is modest because it refers to for-\nmal, school-based education, and many of the current co-\nhorts of elderly persons in these nations began work after\nprimary school. Thus, although most respondents are liter-\nate, their years of schooling are limited. Educational attain-\nment in the samples from Fiji and the Philippines is higher\nthan in Korea and Malaysia, probably due to the purposive\nsampling of urban areas in the former two nations (An-\ndrews et al., 1986). Although three of the samples were\nweighted to ensure accurate representation, some caution is\nwarranted when combining the surveys because of bias due\nto different sampling designs.\nMeasures\nThe surveys asked a number of questions that were re-\nlated to the concepts under investigation. With the excep-\ntion of the status characteristics, multiple measures for each\nconcept were available. The analysis began by creating a\nseries of additive indexes with the items for the proposed\nindexes selected based on extant research and theory (Fil-\nMost of the indexes manifested fairly high reliability, but\nsome Cronbach alpha values were below .70. Therefore, in-\nstead of using additive indexes, factor analysis was used to\noptimize the linear relationship among the items. The same\nsets of items were identified in the factor analyses as were\nspecified a priori in the additive indexes.\nPsychological distress.--Seven items were designed to\nmeasure psychological distress, several of which were\ntaken or adapted from the Center for Epidemiological Stud-\nies-Depression index (Radloff, 1977). The seven distress\nitems include sleep difficulties, worried-tense, lost interest,\nvery depressed, tired, forget things, and loneliness. Re-\nsponses for the first six items were coded yes (1) and no\n(0). The loneliness item was coded almost never (0), some-\ntimes (1), and quite often (2). A factor analysis was per-\nformed on the seven items of distress, yielding one factor\nsuitable for the analysis (i.e., all loadings greater than .5).\nDescriptions of all variables in the analyses for each coun-\ntry and the four countries together are presented in Table 1\nwith ranges of variables, means, standard deviations, and\nfactor loadings where appropriate. The highest and lowest\nmean values for psychological distress are not consistent\nwith modernization hypothesis; Fiji has the highest distress\nand the Philippines has the lowest.\nSocial integration.--Consistent with the recent research\nliterature, social integration and social exchange were\nmeasured separately (Schwarzer & Leppin, 1991). The\nsurvey included a number of indicators of social integra-\ntion that reflect the quantity of social relations and fre-\nquency of contact. Seven measures were used to tap two\ndomains of social integration (House et al., 1988). As\nshown in Table 1, the first domain, labeled voluntary asso-\nciations, was based on three items: whether the respon-\ndent belongs to a social group; the respondent's degree of\nparticipation (a leader, active, some, or no participation);\nand whether the respondent belongs to a group for elderly\nadults. The second domain was conceptualized as integra-\ntion in family and friends and was constructed with four\nitems: how often the respondent attends family functions;\nhow often he or she sees relatives; number of people he or\nshe knows well enough to visit; and whether the respon-\ndent sees family and friends enough. Missing data in\nsmall proportions on the social integration indicators were\nrecoded to the mean for respondents from each country\nSocial exchange.--In addition to social integration, four\nitems were used to measure common social exchanges with\nthe older respondents in these nations. Two items probe help\noffered in family networks. The first, provision of child care\nby elders, is widely used as a measure of intergenerational\nmaking family decisions, has also been used as a measure of\nsocial contributions by elders (Grant, Patterson, & Yager,\ntions, elders, particularly elderly men, are often seen as\nreservoirs of the wisdom of ancestors--unique intermedi-\naries between the present and the past (Gutmann, 1977;\nSimmons, 1945)--and this item taps this function. A third\nitem asked the respondent if he or she is consulted with re-\ngard to community problems, and the fourth item taps eco-\nnomic exchanges. Older adults were asked to identify their\nmain source of income. If an elder received the major source\nof his or her income from the family, the respondent was\nidentified as receiving family financial support, implying at\nleast some degree of economic dependency. Responses\nwere coded yes (1) and otherwise (0).\nThe four items used in this survey were selected because\nof their frequency of occurrence in these Western Pacific\ncultures (see Table 1; Andrews et al., 1986). Although the\nthree items on providing help do not exhaust the types of\nexchanges made, they span both family and community re-\nlations and focus on culturally defined roles for elders. Ex-\ncept for Fiji, elders in the Western Pacific have historically\nrelied heavily upon financial support from children, but this\ntance from elders to children in these four nations is rare,\nbut the other direction of financial exchange is widespread.\n(Home ownership was considered in penultimate models,\nbut was deleted from the final analysis because it was not\nsignificant in any of the multivariate models). Treating the\nfour items separately seemed the best way to use them\ngiven (a) the modest correlation among the four items and\n(b) the value of differentiating which types of exchanges\nare most predictive of psychological distress. One conse-\nquence of treating the four items separately, however, is\nthat more equations are necessary to test the hypotheses\nstated earlier.\nOf course, the ideal strategy is to have parallel measures\nfor giving and receiving across domains of exchange activ-\nity as is the case in recent studies by Krause (1995) and Lee\nand colleagues (1995). Unfortunately, those procedures\nwere not employed when this cross-cultural study was im-\nplemented. The strategy adopted by the investigators of this\ngeneral social survey emphasized prevalent practices in\nthese Western Pacific cultures (Andrews et al., 1986). This\napproach has merits, but the lack of parallelism limits the\ngeneralizability of the results presented later in this article.\n(For instance, it would be very useful to test hypotheses re-\ngarding the interaction of giving and receiving aid with par-\nallel measures.)\nFinancial strain.--Respondents were asked about finan-\ncial strain with this question: \"Thinking about your money\nsituation, would you say you: do not have enough for basic\nrequirements, have just enough to get along on, or are you\ncomfortable?\" This subjective appraisal of financial situa-\ntion was coded 1 to 3 so that higher scores refer to higher\nlevels of financial strain. Given the link between financial\nstrain and both social relations and psychological distress,\ninteractions between financial strain and various measures\nof social relations were also created and will be described\nHealth.--Whereas health is often closely related to psy-\nchological distress among older adults, a number of mea-\nsures of health status spanning four domains were consid-\nered in this research. The first domain, subjective health,\nwas measured with two items: \"How do you feel about\nyour present health: do you feel quite healthy?\" (Responses\nwere yes and no, coded 2 and 1, respectively.) The second\nquestion was very similar to the widely used self-rating of\nhealth: \"How would you evaluate your present health; is\nit\": very good (5), fairly good (4), average (3), fairly bad\nThe next two domains concern physical functioning. One\ndomain, activities of daily living (ADLs) was defined by\nTable 1.

Responses were coded\nunable (0), able with help (1), and able without help (2).\nThe other domain of physical functioning, labeled instru-\nmental ADLs (IADLs), was defined by the following items:\nability to get to places out of walking distance, to go shop-\nping for food and clothes, and to handle money. The coding\nscheme was identical for ADLs and IADLs.\nFinally, the fourth domain of health measures sick days\nand is composed of two items: (a) how many days in the\nlast month the respondent was so sick that he or she could\nnot carry on usual activities--such as going to work or\nworking around the house, and (b) how many days in the\nlast month the respondent was in a hospital for physical\nhealth problems. The distributions for these two items were\ngrouped into five categories ranging from none (coded 5) to\n22-31 days (coded 1). All health items were coded so that\nhigh values reflect better health.\nStatus and social characteristics.--The measurement of\nother variables is fairly straightforward and is depicted in\nTable 1. Education is a seven-category variable of years of\nschooling ranging from 0 (no years) to 6 (17 or more\nyears). Each of the status characteristics considered has\nbeen shown in previous research to be important in predict-\ning psychological distress.\nRESULTS\nAs a way of introducing the analysis, Table 2 presents\ncountry-specific correlation matrices among selected vari-\nables: financial strain, the six variables for social relations,\nand psychological distress. As hypothesized, financial strain\nis positively related to psychological distress in all four na-\ntions. Receiving financial support is positively related to\ndistress in three of the four nations. The relationships be-\ntween social relations and distress are more complex, but\nthe overall pattern is one of integration and social contribu-\ntions associated with lower levels of distress.\nTable 2.

Psychological distress\nThe multivariate analysis was conducted in two stages: (a)\nmain effects of the independent variables on psychological\ndistress were estimated, assuming an additive model, and (b)\ninteraction terms of financial strain and social relations were\ntested sequentially. Table 3 presents ordinary least squares\n(OLS) regression coefficients, both unstandardized and stan-\ndardized, for the first stage of the analysis. The first three\ncolumns display the additive model for all nations combined.\nA Chow test of the equality between sets of regression coeffi-\ncients across nations suggested the appropriateness of sepa-\ncountry-specific OLS regression analyses were conducted to\ntest for different associations between the predictor variables\nand psychological distress as well as interactions across the\nnations. (Standardized coefficients are provided for interpre-\ntations within a given country but should not be used for\ncross-cultural comparisons.) Rather than simply comparing\nslopes, differences of slopes were tested (t value) for all inde-\npendent variable contrasts where at least one slope was sta-\ntistically significant (Marascuilo & Levin, 1983). Korea\nserves as the reference group for the analysis of differences\nin slopes. Thus, no t values are presented for Korea.\nThe analysis of the four nations combined reveals that,\nconsistent with the simple relationships shown in Table 1,\npsychological distress is highest in Fiji and lowest in the\nPhilippines (i.e., modernization does not lead to higher lev-\nels of distress). Women have slightly higher distress levels\nas do people who are not married, live with fewer household\nmembers, are under financial strain, and are in poor\nhealth--findings consistent with previous studies conducted\nin other nations (e.g., Krause & Liang, 1993; Whelan,\n1993). Indeed, standardized coefficients show that subjec-\ntive health, IADLs, and financial strain have the strongest\neffects on psychological distress. Integration in family and\nfriend networks, but not in voluntary associations, is associ-\nated with lower levels of psychological distress. There is no\nmain effect of social exchange on psychological distress for\nthe four nations combined.\nTable 3.

Social ex-\nchanges are quite consequential among Korean elders; psy-\nchological distress is higher among those who are not\ninvolved in family decision making but are consulted on\ncommunity problems and receive family financial support.\nThe results for Malaysia show that household size and\nfinancial strain are not significant predictors of psychological\ndistress. Integration in voluntary associations in Malaysia is\nassociated with lower levels of psychological distress, but\nnone of the exchange relationships considered is consequen-\ntial. The equation for Fiji has the lowest R2 value of all four\nnations. Psychological distress there is explained by financial\nstrain, health, and integration in family and friend networks.\nAgain, no form of social exchange influences distress.\nTurning to the equation for the Philippines, it is apparent\nthat the determinants of psychological distress are quite dif-\nferent from those seen in Korea. The Philippines is the only\nnation in the multivariate analysis where women have\nhigher levels of distress. Three of the four indicators of\nhealth influence psychological distress in the Philippines,\nand the consistency of effects due to subjective health and\nIADLs across the four nations is remarkable. In other\nwords, health shapes distress regardless of social context.\nHousehold size, community consultation, and receiving\nfamily financial support are not associated with psychologi-\ncal distress in the Philippines, but providing child care and\nhelping with family decision making are. The provision of\nchild care is associated with elevated levels of psychologi-\ncal distress presumably due to the physical and mental\nchallenges of taking care of grandchildren (Domingo &\nAsis, 1995). On the other hand, helping with family deci-\nsion making is associated with lower levels of psychologi-\ncal distress.\nThe final stage of the analysis is the test of multiplicative\nmodels, where it was hypothesized that financial strain\nwould interact with at least one type of social relations in\nshaping psychological distress in each of the four nations.\n(Models for the interaction of giving and receiving on dis-\ntress were also tested, but none of 15 conditional relation-\nships was significant.) Rather than load the equations with\nmultiple interaction terms, interaction terms were tested\none at a time (Jaccard, Turrisi, & Wan, 1990; Southwood,\n1978). Those that were significant are reported in Table 4.\nTable 4.

It\nshould be noted that the interpretation of interaction effects\nrelies on considering the main effects along with the prod-\nuct term (and the contribution to R2 by adding the product\nterm; Jaccard et al., 1990). Although the main effect for\nfamily and friend networks is no longer significant, the F\ntest for contribution to R2 indicates that there is a significant\ninteraction: financial strain heightens psychological dis-\ntress, but solid integration in family and friend networks\nserves as a buffer (p < .05). Consistent with the hypothesis,\npsychological distress is most acute for those who face fi-\nnancial strain and report being integrated weakly in family\nand friend networks.\nThe results for Malaysia indicate that financial strain is\nsignificant only when combined with the provision of child-\ncare. Neither of the main effect variables are significant in\nTable 4, but the F test reveals that this is, nonetheless, a\ncase of significant statistical interaction (p <. 05). This is\nthe only instance where intergenerational aid given by the\nelder coupled with financial strain is associated with psy-\nchological distress. As hypothesized, psychological distress\nis lower among Malaysian elders who report financial strain\nand the provision of childcare. Table 3 showed that provid-\ning child care was associated with psychological distress in\nthe Philippines, but the results here show that providing\nchild care in Malaysia decreases the effect of financial\nstrain on psychological distress. We view this effect in\nMalaysia as a way for elders to balance or offset financial\nstrain by providing tangible help to the family. Islam is the\nmost popular religion in Malaysia, and it expects strong\nfamily contributions (Tracy & Tracy, 1993). Although\nMalaysia shows how financial strain coupled with intergen-\nerational giving leads to lower psychological distress, the\nresults from Fiji point to the process of financial support re-\nceived by elders interacting with financial strain to heighten\npsychological distress. The F test for contribution to R2,\nhowever, indicates that the interaction is not statistically\nsignificant (p > .05). Given that the R2 is lowest in Fiji, we\nbelieve the interaction between financial strain and receiv-\ning support merits further attention, but there is insufficient\nevidence in these data to claim that the two interact in Fiji.\nThus, of the three interaction hypotheses specified, this is\nthe only one for which there was no support in any of the\ncountries.\nFinally, the test of interaction effects in the Philippines is\nconsistent with the hypothesis and parallels those for\nKorea: financial strain heightens psychological distress, and\nelders who are integrated weakly in family and friend net-\nworks suffer the most. (Whereas this conditional relation-\nship was manifest in Korea and the Philippines, a test for a\nsecond-order interaction was also performed, but found to\nbe nonsignificant.)\nDISCUSSION\nConsiderable research has examined the ways in which\nsocial relations influence psychological distress in the\nUnited States, but cross-cultural analyses of such relation-\nships are rare. This study used a cross-cultural approach to\nimprove understanding of how social relations and financial\nstrain influence psychological distress. Based on the most\nrecent literature on stressors and social relations, we hy-\npothesized that social relations and financial strain would\nmanifest both main and interactive effects on psychological\ndistress.\nResults from the four nations showed that financial strain\nis common in these nations, especially in Fiji and the\nPhilippines (the less-developed nations). Financial strain\nwas also higher among persons with limited education and\npoor health. As is the case in many studies in the United\nStates, the impact of financial strain on psychological dis-\ntress is clear. Financial strain was associated with higher\nlevels of psychological distress in all of the nations studied,\nexcept Malaysia. These findings add to the literature re-\ngarding how financial strain is important to psychological\ndistress, but do so with impressive cross-cultural evidence\nstatus of older people varies by level of societal develop-\nment, even in the Philippines, the least modern society\nstudied here, financial strain was linked to psychological\ndistress.\nFinancial strain involves anxiety about subsistence, and\nconfronting the daily exigencies of survival may erode feel-\nings of control and self-worth. Indeed, the connection be-\ntween the psychological anxiety associated with financial\nstrain and feelings of psychological distress is well estab-\nlished, even in cross-cultural research (Krause et al., 1991).\nAn emerging literature, however, suggests that a second\nmechanism may also be at work in which financial strain\ninfluences the quality of social life, sometimes precipitating\nmore negative interactions (Kim & Rhee, 1997; Krause &\nLiang, 1993). In this sense, it would be helpful if future\nstudies considered the independent and joint effects of fi-\nnancial strain and quality of social relations on psychologi-\ncal distress. Findings from our analysis reveal that financial\nstrain was associated with less integration in family and\nfriend networks, but these data do not permit a test of the\nquality of social relations being affected by financial strain.\nAlthough financial strain directly and positively influ-\nenced psychological distress in three of the four nations,\nnone of the other variables pertaining to the main-effect hy-\npotheses demonstrated such a consistent pattern. Six mea-\nsures of social relations were considered across four na-\ntions, resulting in 24 tests; 8 of these 24 were significant,\nbut only 6 were consistent with the hypotheses. Each mea-\nsure of social relations was significant in at least one na-\ntion, but only two were significant in more than one nation:\npsychological distress was lower for respondents with fam-\nily and friend integration and help with family decision\nmaking. From another perspective, psychological distress\nin Korea was related to four measures of social relations,\nbut only one or two of the six measures were significant in\neach of the remaining nations.\nBeyond main effects, analyses of these Western Pacific\nelders provide some evidence that financial strain and inte-\ngration in family and friend networks interact in shaping\npsychological distress: although financial strain heightens\npsychological distress, solid integration in family and friend\nnetworks serves as a buffer in two of the four nations. For\nthose individuals who lack such integration and report\nfinancial strain, psychological distress is much higher. We\nuncovered another case of statistical interaction--financial\nstrain interacted with the provision of child care in Ma-\nlaysia. Although some might argue that providing child\ncare might increase distress for those experiencing financial\nstrain, the opposite effect was observed in Malaysia; finan-\ncially strained elders who helped with child care had lower\nlevels of psychological distress. We see this as a compen-\nsatory mechanism--one way for elders to balance or offset\nfinancial strain by providing tangible help to the family\n(Tracy & Tracy, 1993). Also, recall that the vast majority of\nMalaysians sampled are Muslim and that Islam is the na-\ntional religion. According to Islam, family members are ex-\npected to support the family. Thus, providing child care\nmay lower psychological distress because of the unique re-\nligious and cultural expectations of family support among\nthe Muslim Malays (Chan & Davanzo, 1996). The data are\nnot sufficient to test hypotheses about religious identity and\nexpectations, but it is clear that among the four samples\nstudied, Islam is prevalent in Peninsular Malaysia.\nTaken together, these findings point to this study's three\nmajor conclusions about how financial strain and social re-\nlations affect psychological distress among older people.\nFirst, the main effect due to financial strain on psychologi-\ncal distress is important. By using a cross-cultural frame-\nwork, financial strain was found to heighten psychological\ndistress in some fashion for three of the four nations con-\nsidered. The gravity of structural inequality in power re-\nsources on psychological distress is hard to underestimate.\nThis is not to suggest a simplistic notion of socioeconomic\ndeterminism on the psychological state of elders. Instead,\nwe see socioeconomic resources as key influences on the\nintricate process of how social relations shape distress.\nSecond, the effect of social relations on psychological\ndistress is rarely as simple as may be detected when esti-\nmating main effects only. Rather, the effect of social rela-\ntions on psychological outlook is shaped in conjunction\nwith the stressors experienced by the older person (Silver-\nstein & Bengtson, 1994). The same measures of social rela-\ntions did not interact with strain in all four nations. Thus,\nthere is no simple conclusion that generalizes across all of\nthe nations considered; the interaction findings are not\nconsistent across the nations. What we uncovered, how-\never, was that strain interacts with different measures of so-\ncial relations in three of the four nations. We believe it is\nnoteworthy that in three of four Western Pacific nations,\nfinancial strain interacts with one of two forms of social re-\nlations in shaping psychological distress. These results\ndemonstrate more convincingly that although the main ef-\nfects of strain and social relations are important, it is also\nlikely that the two phenomena interact in shaping psycho-\nlogical distress. The precise dimensions of social relations\nthat interact with strain vary by the unique cultural context,\nbut interaction effects should be examined. Failure to ac-\ncount for conditional relationships between stressors, social\nrelations, and psychological distress means that one does\nnot adequately capture the richness of the links between\nthese concepts.\nThird, the types of social relations with which financial\nstrain interacts vary by cultural context and appear to be in-\ndependent of the status of modernization. Some theories re-\ngarding the effects of modernization suggest that elders in\nmore modern societies may be especially vulnerable to fi-\nbut we found no clear pattern along levels of moderniza-\ntion. Indeed, three important findings run counter to what\none would anticipate from modernization theory. First, psy-\nchological distress was higher among elders in Korea who\nreceived family financial support (Table 3), perhaps be-\ncause they feel inadequate by receiving the aid (Lee et al.,\n1995). Second, the interaction of financial strain and family\nand friend integration on psychological distress was ob-\nserved in Korea and the Philippines, the most and least\nmodernized nations, respectively. Third, the influence of in-\nvolvement in family decision making on psychological dis-\ntress was significant in the Philippines and Korea. It may\nseem intuitive that the risk of social dependency may be\nmore consequential to psychological distress in more mod-\nern societies where utilitarian values are more common.\nYet, the effect of modernization on the both the status of\nolder people and their psychological distress appears to be\nmore contingent on cultural heritage than modernization\nalone (Haber & Gratton, 1994). The modernization hypoth-\nesis is not supported by these data.\nFour limitations of the present study should be kept in\nmind when interpreting the results. First, the results are de-\nrived from cross-sectional data reflecting degrees of mod-\nernization, but results from long-term, longitudinal studies\nof societies undergoing modernization would be more in-\nsightful. With that said, the cost and organization needed\nfor such an endeavor would be truly extraordinary when\nstudying a subject such as psychological distress. All four\nnations experienced major changes in their economies and\nquality of life during recent years, but the rank order of\nmodernization is probably the same now as when the sur-\nveys were conducted. Second, for Malaysia and the Philip-\npines, the surveys cover only selected geographic regions\nof the nation. This is not a serious flaw given the compara-\ntive emphasis here and the dearth of related research, but\nit does constrain external validity for those two nations.\nThird, because different sampling designs were used in the\nfour nations, some caution is needed regarding external va-\nlidity. Finally, although the measures of social exchange tap\na range of interactions, the lack of parallelism for giving\nand receiving is important. Given this limitation, studies\nwith parallel measures that examine the independent and\ninteractive effects of social relations and financial strain (or\nother stressors) on psychological distress would prove es-\npecially useful. Despite the shortcomings of this research,\nthis is the first cross-cultural study of which we are aware\nthat systematically examines these relationships. The data\nclearly show the importance of how the effects of social re-\nlations and financial strain jointly influence psychological\ndistress.\nIn conclusion, the findings of the present investigation\nadd to the literature on how social environments and func-\ntioning influence the psychological state of elders. It is\nclear that some social and economic conditions are likely to\nlead to psychological distress among elders, but our find-\nings suggest that this can be mitigated, at least in part, by\ngreater social integration and/or involving elders in family\ndecision-making processes. In addition, the fact that subjec-\ntive health and IADLs were significant predictors of psy-\nchological distress in all four nations underscores the im-\nportance of health factors in shaping distress regardless of\nsocial or cultural context.\n"
