A search for the dietary risk factors for colon\ncancer is warranted in order to reduce colon cancer\nincidence and the healthcare costs of this disease.\nTea has a history of human use of over 4000 years and is\nthe second most commonly consumed beverage in the\nworld.

In brief, NHANES I was\nconducted by the National Center for Health Statistics\ncharacteristics, medical history, diet, and biochemical and\nanthropometric measures were collected from a US\nnational probability sample of non-institutionalised\npersons aged 25 to 74 years. Population subgroups\nthought to be at `nutritional risk' were over-sampled. Four\nwaves of follow-up for the 14 407 subjects who underwent\nthe medical examination were conducted in the NHEFS\ndied were followed up by proxy interview. Of the 14 407\nsuccessfully traced through 1992. Death certificates were\ncoded according to the ninth revision of the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD-9).\nColon cancer cases\nCancer morbidity was self-reported in four follow-up\ninterviews; cancer mortality was ascertained through\nproxy interview and information from the National\nDeath Index. In rare situations where the year of first\ncancer diagnosis was not available, the midpoint between\ntwo interviews was used as the year of cancer incidence.\nThe cause of death was validated by referring to the\nprimary cause of death listed on the death certificate by the\nNCHS. International Classification of Diseases ICD-9-CM\ncode 153 was used to identify colon cancer morbidity as\nthe first cancer incidence other than skin cancer. Cancer\ncases that reported having had other cancers previously\nwere excluded from the analysis. If subjects reported\nmultiple cancers in the same year and colon cancer was\namong the cancers, colon cancer was selected as the\nprimary cancer incidence. Overall, colon cancer cases\nwere determined primarily from the morbidity infor-\nmation. If subjects died of colon cancer but never reported\ncolon cancer morbidity, the subjects were assigned as\ncolon cancer cases and the time of death was identified as\nthe cancer incidence. The follow-up time of cases was\ncalculated by subtracting the month and year of the\nbaseline interview from the mid-year of the `incidence' of\ncolon cancer. Similarly, for lost subjects, the follow-up\ntime was estimated as the total number of months between\nbaseline interview and the time of censoring. The\ncensoring time was either the time of dropout (loss to\nfollow-up or cancer of other sites) or the end of the study\nTea consumption\nTea consumption status was based on a 24-hour dietary\nrecall data and one question on consumption of tea\nfollow-up survey. The baseline questionnaire did not\ndistinguish between tea and coffee consumption. There-\nfore, if subjects reported tea drinking in the 24-hour\ndietary recall regardless of the response to the single\nquestion in the questionnaire, the amount of tea\nconsumption is used as daily tea intake. However, if\nsubjects responded `yes' to the question but reported no\ncoffee consumption in the 24-hour recall, the average\namount of tea consumed by tea users in the NHEFS is used\nto define the amount of tea consumption. The food-\nmuch more detail about tea drinking practices and\nfrequency of consumption. We are able to directly\ncalculate the amount of daily tea consumption.\nAnalytic cohorts\nTwo distinct analytic cohorts were defined. Cohort I was\nbased upon the initial interview with its baseline\nCohort II was followed for approximately 10 years\nDietary intakes\nDietary records were obtained from a single 24-hour recall\ninterview at the baseline survey for 10 220 members of the\nNHEFS cohort. Intakes of 13 nutrients for the foods\nconsumed in the NHANES I baseline survey were\ncalculated by the NCHS. Intakes of total calories, calcium,\ntotal fat and dietary fibres were included as covariates to\nassess possible confounding effects of these on the\ntea\u00adcolon cancer relationship.\nOther covariates\nSociodemographic variables obtained from the baseline\nsurvey (age, education, race, gender and poverty index)\nwere included in the examination as possible confounders\nor effect modifiers. Questions on alcohol consumption\nwere asked at the baselines of both cohorts. Non-drinkers\nwere defined as those who reported no alcohol\nconsumption in the past year. The average number of\ndrinks consumed per week was derived by multiplying the\nfrequency of drinking by the average amount usually\nconsumed. The calculation of body mass index (BMI,\nkg m22) was based on self-reported weight and height at\nand 1992 interviews whether any close family members\n(parents/siblings/children) had cancer and, if so, the types\nof cancer. The information from both waves of interviews\nwas then combined to create the variable for familial colon\ncancer history. Aspirin use over the 30 days prior to the\nbaseline interview was entered as a dichotomous (yes/no)\nvariable; the use of vitamin or mineral supplements in the\npast month was also assessed and coded as yes/no.

Vitamin and mineral use,\naspirin use, alcohol consumption and baseline smoking\nstatus were missing for some subjects. Covariate inclusion\nwas based on whether inclusion of a covariate changed\nthe coefficient for the main variable by more than 10%.\nFamily history of colon cancer, vitamin and mineral use,\nphysical activity and smoking at baseline were thus not\nincluded in the final models. Both continuous and\ncategorical tea consumption variables were used to\nmodel colon cancer risk. Gender and race were assessed\nfor possible effect modification.\nResults\nThe summary demographic characteristics of the\nNHEFS Cohorts were stratified by tea consumption\nstatus (Table 1). After the exclusion of subjects with\nincomplete information, this study consisted of 3884\nsubjects reporting no tea drinking at both baseline\nreporting tea consumption at either baseline or first\nfollow-up, and 1919 subjects reporting tea consump-\ntion in both surveys. The mean age was significantly\nhigher in non-tea users than in tea users \u00f0P , 0:01\u00de:\nMen were more likely to be non-tea users than women\nin this study. A higher percentage (57.9%) of non-tea\nusers had less education (,12th grade) than users\nrespectively). Long-term tea users were more likely to\nbe white, had family history of colon cancer, and take\na vitamin/mineral supplement.\nTea consumption at baseline and the risk of colon\ncancer adjusted for confounders are summarised for the\nNHEFS Cohort I (Table 2). Although there is generally an\ninverse relationship between colon cancer risk and\nwhether subjects consume tea or not, the relationship\ndid not achieve statistical significance when the data for\nmen and women were combined or analysed separately.\nWhen the association between tea consumption and colon\ncancer risk was examined based on the amount of tea\nconsumed each day, a non-significant inverse trend\nTable 1 Demographic characteristics of the NHEFS population, by tea consumption status*\nNon-tea users\nShort-term tea users\nLong-term tea users\nColon cancer case\nEducation\nRace\nFamily colon cancer history\nVitamin/mineral use\nAlcohol consumption\nPhysical activity\n* Subjects who reported no tea consumption in both baseline and first follow-up are coded as `non-tea users'; subjects\nwho consumed tea either at baseline or first follow-up are coded as `short-term tea users'; subjects who consumed tea\nat both surveys are considered as `long-term tea users'.\n Tea consumption information was not available for 21 cases and 2051 non-cases.\n Physical activity information was not available for 10 subjects.\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

These studies have found tea to be\neither preventive19, a risk factor20, or to have no\nassociation with colon cancer21. The current study found\na significantly reduced risk for habitual tea consumers\nwhen compared with non-users in the NHEFS Cohort II. In\nthe male population in the study, the inverse dose\u00ad\nresponse relationship was significant. The risk reduction\nas 70% for men who consumed more than 1.5 cups of tea\neach day. The relationship for women in the NHEFS\nCohort II and for the entire NHEFS Cohort I did not reach\nstatistical significance.\nThe NHEFS has some powerful advantages as a cohort.\nSince it reflects the underlying diversity of the US\npopulation as a whole, it has greater power to detect an\neffect than a more homogeneous cohort. In addition, the\nresults from this cohort have great external validity to the\nUS population. Concerns about recall bias are excluded in\na cohort design as dietary data are collected prior to the\ndisease diagnosis.

The questionnaire at baseline asked whether\nsubjects drank tea or coffee in one question. Thus it is\nunclear whether subjects who had a positive answer to this\nquestion were tea drinkers, coffee drinkers or drinkers of\nboth coffee and tea. Besides, no specific information was\nobtained regarding either the frequency or the portion of\nthe beverage consumed. In order to avoid misclassification\nbias, the information was cross-checked with the 24-hour\ndietary recall data. If an individual reported drinking any\ncoffee but not tea on the particular day of recall, the\nsubject was then categorised as a non-user of tea. If an\nindividual was determined as a tea user in the question but\nno specific amount of consumption was given in the recall\ndata, the average daily consumption amount among tea\nusers was assigned to that subject. These two approaches\nto code tea consumption data at baseline aim to minimise\npossible differential misclassification. Twenty-four hour\nrecall is a valuable tool for capturing frequent (daily) tea\nconsumption but is less reliable in appropriately\ncharacterising infrequent consumers. Therefore, the\nanalyses of baseline tea consumption in this study may\nnot capture those who consumed both tea and coffee\ninfrequently in the baseline period, or even tea drinkers\nwho happened not to drink tea at the particular day of the\n24-hour dietary recall assessment. As a result, the estimates\nfor the relationship between tea and colon cancer may be\nbiased towards the null and thus weaken the observed\nassociations.\nOn the other hand, tea consumption in the NHEFS\nCohort II was assessed using a semi-quantitative food-\nfrequency questionnaire (FFQ) for average dietary intakes\nover the past year. Tea consumption and coffee\nconsumption were queried in separate questions and the\nfrequency, as well as portion size, were assessed\nseparately. The FFQ provides a better quantitative estimate\nfor habitual tea consumption than the 24-hour dietary\nrecall used in the NHEFS Cohort I. The results of this study\nnot only reflect the ability of the FFQ to quantify the\nhabitual tea consumption, but also demonstrate a\nconsistent and stronger preventive effect of tea consump-\ntion on colon cancer compared with findings from Cohort\nI. This is a secondary data analysis study. It is impossible\nfor us to assess the validity of tea consumption data. There\nis no way to compare the findings from Cohort I and\nCohort II to determine which one is more valid. It is,\nhowever, clear that the method used to assess tea\nconsumption in Cohort II is a better instrument to capture\nhabitual dietary intake22 \u00ad25. Besides, findings from both\ncohorts show an inverse relationship between tea\nconsumption and colon cancer risk. In addition, categori-\ncal analysis based on tea consumption pattern over the\ntwo-survey period, as ordered in Table 1, suggests that\nrisk for men and women, respectively, when comparing\nsubjects who never drank tea with long-term tea drinkers\n(data not shown). This finding indirectly supports that the\nCohort II results may be more representative of the effect\nof tea consumption on colon cancer risk.\nData from laboratory studies suggest that specific types\nof tea have different impacts on carcinogenesis26,27.\nUnfortunately, neither cohort of the NHEFS assessed\nvarious types of tea. Lacking information regarding the\ntypes of tea used, the results of this study might be prone\nto misclassification. Given that even the NHANES III\ntea consumption in the US population, it is reasonable to\nassume that the majority of the population in the USA\nconsumed black tea at the time that the NHEFS surveys\nwere conducted in the early 1970s and again in the early\n1980s. Therefore, the degree of misclassification for types\nof tea consumed should be minimal. The results seen in\nthis study should be mostly from the effect of black tea.\nIt is not clear why the preventive effect of tea\nconsumption is stronger in men than women in this\nstudy. One explanation may be that the women in this\nstudy are significantly younger than are the men. Besides,\nthe risk of colon cancer is lower for women than for men\nto start with28. The non-significant result observed in\nwomen may simply be the result of the lower susceptibility\nto colon cancer risk among this particular population. On\nthe other hand, this study found that the percentage of\nalcohol users is higher in women than in men in both\ncohorts. This finding is contradictory to the finding from\nanother US study29. It is possible that men in this study\nmay be more likely to underreport alcohol drinking than\nwomen30. Since alcohol drinking has been linked to colon\ncancer risk31 \u00ad34, insufficient control for alcohol use may\nbias the study results. The finding of a higher percentage\nof women reporting drinking alcohol is consistent across\nboth baseline and first follow-up surveys. The finding of a\nstronger effect of tea on colon cancer in Cohort II should\nnot be attributed as the result of residual confounding due\nto insufficient controlling of the self-reported alcohol\nconsumption information.\nThis study excluded subjects who developed cancer\nbefore the study for each of the cohorts. However, Cohort\nII subjects may have modified their lifestyle and health\nbehaviour simply because they are enrolled in the study.\nGiven the lengthy latent period for colon carcinogenesis,\nthe information collected at the first follow-up survey used\nas `baseline' data for Cohort II may have reflected the\nmodified behaviour, especially after close to 10 years in\nthe study since they entered the study in the early 1970s.\nFortunately, NHEFS did not actively contact study\nparticipants between each survey, as did another\nprospective cohort study35. Subjects did not receive\nupdated health information from the NCHS. Besides, tea\nconsumption was not considered beneficial during the\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The\ndirect effect from participation should be minimal.\nHowever, residual confounding effects from other lifestyle\nfactors may exist.\nIn conclusion, this study found a significant inverse\nassociation between habitual tea consumption and colon\ncancer risk among men. The association is less strong in\nwomen. Infrequent tea consumption based on a single\n24-hour dietary recall with a longer follow-up period did\nnot show significant association. Although the study\nresults should be interpreted cautiously given the nature of\nthe study limitations, an apparent colon cancer prevention\neffect was seen for men who consumed more than 1.5\ncups of tea per day. Considering the increased popularity\nof the consumption of both green and black tea, this study,\nalong with experimental data, suggests that the preventive\neffect of tea on colon cancer merits further study.\n"
