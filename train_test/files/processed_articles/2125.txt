Large population studies carried out in the United States, while addressing refractive error prevalence, have\npublished little addressing the modes of refractive correction. As such, there are little data in the biomedical literature\nconcerning the characteristics of the contact lens wearing population in the United States. The purpose of this project was\nto develop estimates of the demographic characteristics of a cross section of contact lens wearers in the United States\nbased on those who wore contact lenses on the day of their National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nexamination.\nMethods. The NHANES is a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population. As part of NHANES, the type of\nrefractive correction used is collected during a mobile medical clinic examination along with demographic variables.\nDemographic characteristics of the U.S. population using contacts during the medical clinic examination were derived.\nAssociations between demographic variables and contact lens use were explored in age-stratified univariate and\nmultivariate analyses taking into account the complex sampling frame.\nResults. In univariate analysis, age (p  0.001) and the availability of health insurance (p  0.007) have negative\nassociations with contact lens use, while female gender (p  0.001), higher socioeconomic status (p  0.001), and higher\neducational attainment (p  0.001) are associated with increased contact lens use. In multivariate analysis, age (p \nsocioeconomic status with education (p  0.002) are associated with contact lens use.\nConclusions. Four demographic variables, age, socioeconomic status, age-gender interaction, and socioeconomic\nstatus-education interaction, defined those likely to be using contact lens on any given day in the United States. Together,\nthese four variables identify almost 9 of 10 contact lens users.\n",

The NHANES is\na nationally representative sample of the U.S. population and each\nyear enrolls about 5000 people.

The exami-\nnation component consists of medical, dental, and physiological mea-\nsurements as well as laboratory tests.4 NHANES data have been used\npreviously to estimate the prevalence of refractive error and undercor-\nrection of refractive error in the United States.4\u00ad6 The purpose of this\nproject was to develop estimates on the demographic characteristics of\ncontact lens users based on NHANES data.\nMETHODS\nNHANES Methods\nIn each NHANES cycle, a subsample of participants aged 12\nyears and older is selected for examination within the mobile med-\nical clinics. As part of the mobile clinic examination, distance visual\nacuity (Snellen) is measured for all participants while near acuity is\nmeasured only for participants older than 50 years. Before any\nvisual acuity testing, participants are asked whether they use glasses\nor contacts for distance vision activities such as watching television\n(Fig. 1). If the subject answers yes to using glasses or contacts for\ndistance tasks, a composite response of using corrective lenses is\nnoted. Participants are then asked whether the corrective lenses\nwere available at the clinic visit. If yes, it is noted whether the\ncorrection is contacts, glasses, or whether both together are used for\nacuity testing. For all participants having spectacles with them, the\nspectacles are measured by automated lensometry. Similar meth-\nods are applied for near acuity. Each participant regardless of\nwhether corrective lenses are reportedly used has distance refractive\ncorrection estimated by autorefraction.\nStatistical Methods and Variable Definitions\nThe NHANES is a probability sample intended to be represen-\ntative of the U.S. population with a complex sampling scheme\nusing stratification, clustering, and oversampling of some demo-\nNHANES were obtained from the National Center for Health\nStatistics.

An age-stratified cross-sectional\nstudy was carried out. All statistical analyses were carried out on the\nappropriate 4-year weighted sample accounting for the complex\ndesign (SAS survey) using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC). Chi-squared and logistic regression methods were used to\nevaluate associations between the demographic and measured vari-\nables. Variance estimations and 95% CI were calculated using the\nTaylor linearization method. Rao-Scott 2 values are given where\nreported. In multivariate association analyses, each individual de-\nmographic variable and age interaction terms were entered into\nregression equations. Due to the well-known associations of eth-\nnicity with income and education with income, both were added as\npotential interaction terms. Stepwise reductions of variables not\napproaching statistical significance (p  0.1) were done until the\nmost parsimonious model with highest concordance was achieved.\nSubjects were considered to be contact lens wearers if they used\ncontact lenses for the entering distance visual acuity task. This\nincluded individuals who used a combination of spectacles and\ncontacts for acuity testing. A convenient categorical variable for age\nrepresent a combination of common clinical divisions and col-\nlected data categories. Although the NHANES sample is extremely\nlarge, contact lens wear becomes infrequent in older adults neces-\nsitating categorical grouping, further NHANES truncates age at 85\nand true linear analysis is not possible. The developed age categories\nwere used in univariate and multivariate analyses except as noted for\ndescriptive statistics. NHANES classifies race into five categories:\nMexican, other Hispanic, white, African-American, and other race\nincluding those of mixed race. White race and other race were used as\nthe reference categories for comparative analyses unless otherwise\nnoted. The variable poverty to income ratio (PIR) was used as the\nmeasureofsocioeconomicstatus.PIRisacontinuousmeasureusedby\nthe U.S. government to assess poverty status and takes into account\nincome, expenses, and family size. Those with PIR 1.0 have income\nbelow the federal poverty level for families, while those with PIR 4\nareconsideredhighincome.Afive-levelcategoricalvariableofPIRwas\ncreated based on criteria used in reporting data from the Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey.8 High income was used as the reference for\nanalyses except as noted. Educational attainment was categorized into\nfive categories 9th grade, 9th to 11th grade, high school graduate or\nGeneral Educational Development equivalent, some college or asso-\nciatedegree,andcollegegraduateorabove.NHANEScollectsdataon\nwhether each subject is covered by health insurance as a dichotomous\nresponse. This dichotomous response to having insurance was used in\nunivariate and multivariate tests. For those having health insurance,\nsubjects are asked a series of questions to determine whether they are\ncovered by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, or military- and\nstate-sponsored plans. The type of insurance was only evaluated in\nunivariate analysis with contact lens wear for general demographic\ninformation. An age-limited analysis of those younger than 65 years\nwas carried out to evaluate the impact of Medicare.\nUse of contact lenses during the near acuity task was considered\nseparately to develop estimates of type and use of presbyopic con-\ntacts in the United States. Near-contact use was divided into three\nbroad categories: those who used a combination of glasses and\ncontacts, those who used only contacts (presumed multifocals),\nand those who used contacts that were likely prescribed as mono-\nvision. Estimates of presumed multifocal contact lens wear were\nderived by calculating those who used only contact lenses for the\ndistance and near acuity testing and did not use glasses with the\ncontacts for either task or have monovision correction coded. A\nspecific coding comment is found in NHANES data denoting\nwhether subjects were wearing monovision in either spectacles or\ncontact lenses. As a part of NHANES protocol, this comment\nshould be queried for each subject. The coding of both the distance\nand near acuity included an option for subjects using both glasses\nand contacts together during testing. If the subject used glasses\nwith contacts for either task, they were classified as using both.\nRESULTS\nFor the U.S. population older than 12 years in the aggregate\npopulation reported using either glasses or contact lenses for dis-\ntance vision. Of those reported using distance vision correction, a\npopulation estimate of 89.8% had verifiable corrective lenses with\nthem at the time of the NHANES mobile health clinic examina-\ntion. Characteristics of those with corrective lenses are found in\nTable 1. Those who did not have corrective lenses with them were\nmore likely to be younger, be of non-white race, have lower edu-\ncational attainment, and have lower socioeconomic status.\nThe current data provide a cross-sectional assessment of lens\nwear in the United States.

The estimated size of the U.S. pop-\nulation using contact lenses from the NHANES data is far smaller\nthan that reported from other sources.1\u00ad3 These smaller estimates\nare likely related to a number of design and implementation factors\nin both the NHANES and industry data. Most data from the\ncontact lens industry appear to be from practitioner surveys, ran-\ndom telephone surveys, and sales data extrapolated to the U.S.\npopulation. Practitioner surveys and sales data are inherently bi-\nased. In recent years, the validity of the traditional random digit\ndialed telephone survey has been questioned as more Americans\nscreen calls with caller identification and the transition away from\nlandline to cell phone-only households.9\nNHANES has a complex sampling frame explicitly intended to\nbe representative of the U.S. population; however, as with any\nadministrative data set, there are limitations and advantages. The\nNHANES data used represents an amalgamation of the U.S. pop-\nsize U.S. population than comparable 2008 estimates from indus-\ntry sources. Mobile medical clinic participation, where contact lens\ndata is generated, was limited to those aged 12 years and older as\npart of the NHANES design. While the population younger than\n12 years using contacts is likely relatively small, it will lead to some\nunderestimation error. The NHANES question sequence does not\nask each interviewee or medical clinic participant directly whether\nthey wear contacts lenses. The lead question to participants (Fig. 1)\nonly records whether refractive correction is used and not the spe-\ncific type. Correction type is recorded only if participants have\ntheir corrective lenses at the time of the medical evaluation. Due to\nthis question sequence, about 10% of the weighted U.S. popula-\ntion who reported using refractive correction was not classified as\nto the type of correction. It would be anticipated that at least some\nof this segment of the population would be contact lens users.\nThose who did not have correction with them were younger, more\nlikely an ethnic minority than white, and had lower education level\nand lower socioeconomic status. Younger Americans are more\nlikely to use contacts which would contribute to a larger total\ncontact lens wearing population, but this is balanced by the lower\nprevalence of use among those with lower socioeconomic status\nand lower education levels.\nThe total contact lens wearing population in the United States\ncomprised those who wear lens every day and those who wear\nlenses on a less than a daily basis. On any given day, a part-time\nwearer may choose to use spectacles or no correction at all rather\nthan contacts. Less than every day wear is common and known to\nvary with lens type.10 The NHANES medical examination itself is\nrelatively innocuous and subjects are not dilated. As such, partici-\npants would not necessarily be biased against contact lens wear\nanticipating dilating drops. Given the question sequence,\nNHANES likely captures all every day wearers and a random prob-\nability sample of those part-time wearers likely to use contact lenses\non any single given day. This would lead to some degree of under-\nestimation of the number of part-time wearers.\nUsing the NHANES data does have merits. Both the actual and\nweighted sample sizes are extremely large eliminating many poten-\ntial sources of selection bias. With the highly defined sampling\nframe, CIs can be calculated around the estimates, something that\nis not reported in data from industry sources. The NHANES relies\non actual lens wear rather than self-report and as such is not subject\nto reporting bias. Self-report data that does not specify time peri-\nods (e.g., \"have you worn contacts in the last week, six months,\netc.\") could be subject to significant individual variation in those\nidentifying themselves as a contact lens user given the high rate of\ncontact lens discontinuation. The NHANES is now administered\non continuous 2-year cycles opening the possibility of long-term\nmonitoring. Overall, it is likely that while the NHANES data\nunderestimates the size of the U.S. contact lens population, it likely\ndoes give an accurate picture of its composition.\nAs expected, age had an inverse association with contact lens use.\nThe pattern of age-related decline in contact lens use does follow\nthat seen from other data sources,1\u00ad3 with the decline in contact\nlens use appearing well before presbyopia. Estimates from\nNHANES for both the percentage of the U.S. population using\nrefractive correction and those using contact lenses were smaller\nacross each age demographic group than is generally reported from\nindustry data. One of the additional limitations of NHANES is the\nlack of data on near vision correction use in the early presbyopic\nage group 40 to 50 years. This appears to be a period when the\nprevalence of contact use declines significantly at least for distance\nvision wear. Unfortunately, how this relates to near vision cannot\nbe evaluated due to the lack of near acuity testing for this group. It\nis unfortunate that these data are unavailable as it would allow not\nonly calculation of contact lens use but also exploration of factors\nrelated to the onset of presbyopia. Among those aged 50 years and\nolder, the breakdown of the use of spectacle and contacts combi-\nnation, multifocal and monovision lens appears to generally follow\nthe pattern reported by Morgan et al.11 from a recent international\nprescribing survey. Some caution should be used with interpreta-\ntion of the modality of contact use at near. The data are highly\ndependent on the accurate coding of the number of monovision\nusers at the time of the NHANES examination. Also, CIs around\nthe modality type are large. Aside from the direct association with\ncontact lens use, the impact of age was seen across all the other\ndemographic variables.\nMost reports indicate that women are far more likely to use\ncontacts than men.1,2 Although this is true, it gives an incomplete\npicture as gender differences in contact lens use are largely depen-\ndent on age. Assuming that most contact lens users began lens wear\nin adolescence and early adulthood, NHANES data suggest that\nmen leave contact lens wear much younger and at a faster rate than\ndo women. Dropout among contact lens users is an important\nissue for practitioners. Most studies of lens dropouts have concen-\ntrated on lens-patient interaction factors such as dryness and com-\nfort. While these factors are undoubtedly important, demographic\ndata suggest that gender-specific differences leading to lens discon-\ntinuance may exist. Further research is needed to clarify what these\ndifferences may be.\nAlthough almost all adults older than 50 years who use contact\nlenses are white, after accounting for other factors ethnicity appears\nto play little role in contact lens use. Non-whites appear at least as\nlikely as whites to use contact lenses. This bodes well for the future\ngiven the changing demographics of the U.S. population. Some\ncaution should be exercised in interpreting the ethnicity data. De-\nspite the large sample size and oversampling of some ethnic groups,\n846 U.S. Contact Lens User Demographics--Swanson\nprecision of the estimates in some subgroups (age by ethnicity,\n\"other\") is poor. The U.S. population is more diverse than the five\nNHANES ethnic groups. Most data presented on ethnicity related\nto contact lens wear list the Hispanic population as a single group.\nBased on the current data, Mexican Americans were more likely to\nuse contacts than non-Mexican Hispanics. While these differences\nappear to be related to factors beyond ethnicity, it suggests that the\nHispanic population is not homogenous related to refractive cor-\nrection use. The Hispanic population in the United States is in fact\ncomposed of 28 subgroups for census purposes based on the coun-\ntry of origin.12 Given the rapid growth of this population, future\nstudies may need to be planned to account for differences within\nthose of Hispanic ethnicity. Obviously, it would be incorrect to\nassume the group \"other ethnicity\" represents a single entity. The\nNHANES coding guide describes the \"other race\" category to\ninclude Asians, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and those who\nhave multiracial heritage. Based on census data, Asian Americans\nwould be the largest constituent of this group. The high use of\ncontact lenses in this group is likely driven by the high prevalence\nof myopia in those of Asian descent.13 It should also be considered\nthat almost 15% of all marriages in the United States are currently\nbetween persons of different ethnicity, and the multiethnic popu-\nlation is growing rapidly.14 Little is known about refractive error in\nthose of multiethnic descent.\nHaving health insurance has been associated with higher rates of\nuse of eye examination and better vision outcomes.15 Knowing\nthis, the inverse association of contact use and health insurance\nmight seem puzzling. The association of health insurance and con-\ntact lens wear is distorted in the U.S. population by the near-\nuniversal coverage of older adults by Medicare. After taking into\naccount the large impact of Medicare, by evaluating adults younger\nthan 65 years, no association with having health insurance and\ncontact lens use was found. The absence of an association is likely\ndue to the relatively high percentage of younger adults in the age\ngroup 18 to 40 years who do not have health insurance com-\npared with teens and older adults. Also, vision insurance or vision\ndiscount plans likely have a more direct association with contact\nlens wear. Census data estimate that about 21% of working age\nadults have vision insurance.16 Data on ancillary insurance such as\ndental and vision are not collected as part of NHANES.\nPerhaps the most interesting associations with contact lens use\nin the U.S. population were those with socioeconomic status and\nthe interaction of education and socioeconomic status. Higher\nsocioeconomic status being associated with contact lens use makes\nintuitive sense given that a large percentage of contact lens-related\nexpenses are out of pocket. While education level was associated\nwith contact lens use in univariate analysis, it is not surprising it\nwas not significant in multivariate analyses. Socioeconomic status\nand education level are known to co-vary with each other.17 Par-\nticularly curious is the increase in contact lens use by those whose\nincome is at the poverty level. A number of possible explanations\nmight account for why those in poverty have increased contact lens\nuse including higher use of medically necessary contacts, coverage\nof contact lenses by state or federal indigent insurance plans, or a\nhigher cost-benefit valuation in this group for contact lenses. Ed-\nucation level clearly plays a role in contact lens use among this\ngroup. Low-income persons with higher education might logically\nrepresent college students or young professionals beginning ca-\nreers; however, the mean age of this group is well past the typical\ncollege years. Equally curious is the increased use of contacts seen\namong those with high socioeconomic status but low educational\nattainment compared with those in the same socioeconomic class\nbut with higher education level. Older contact lens users do gen-\nerally show higher income with lower education level which could\nexplain this relationship. However, when age is looked at across the\nspectrum of education level among those with high socioeconomic\nstatus, no dramatic age affects are seen. The reasons why those with\nhigh PIR and low lower education have higher contact lens use are\nunclear.\nWithin the limitations of the data, the NHANES provides an\nunbiased source of demographic information on cross-sectional\ncontact lens use within the United States. From the data, a number\nof broad conclusions can be drawn. Contact lens use in the United\nStates is associated with four demographic variables: age, socioeco-\nnomic status, age-gender interaction, and socioeconomic status-\neducation interaction. Together these four variables identify\nalmost 9 of 10 contact lens users. The U.S. population shows no\nethnic bias in contact lens use. Socioeconomic status and educa-\ntional level should be looked at in conjunction with each other\nrelative to contact lens use. Gender differences in contact lens use\nmay be due to differential dropout of lens wear by men.\n"
