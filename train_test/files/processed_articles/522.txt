Sixty-two RECs\nwere set up across the nation and awarded $657 million in federal funding\nin 2010.3 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) also have\nset up incentives for adoption and meaningful use of EHRs and penalties\nfor lack of provider engagement.4\nThe realization of EHR benefits depends heavily on health providers'\nuptake of this technology. The Triple Aim initiative aspires to improve pop-\nulation health and health care delivery in the United States while control-\nling costs.5 The federal e-health directives outlined in the Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the American Recovery\nand Reinvestment Act (ARRA) support the Triple Aim and complement\nhealth delivery and payment reform initiatives specified in the Affordable\nImam M.

Family physicians constitute an important case\nbecause they are the largest group of primary care\nphysicians, and they distribute themselves more pro-\nportionately to the population than do other physician\nspecialists, providing frontline health services at the\ncommunity level.7\nConsiderable variation in EHR adoption has been\ndocumented. Simon et al reported 18% of office\npractices having an EHR in Massachusetts in 2005.8\nStream found a 58% adoption rate by family physi-\ncians in Washington State in 2007.9 Menachemi et al\nstudied the increased use of EHRs by physicians in\noutpatient practices in Florida10,11 and found the overall\nadoption rate for office-based physicians reached 57%\nIn this study we used national data from 2 inde-\npendent sources to estimate EHR uptake by family\nphysicians and compared trends. We then compared\nadoption rates by family physicians with rates by other\noutpatient physicians and also investigated geographic\nvariation in EHR adoption at the state level.\nMETHODS\nFor this study, we used data from a census survey\ncompleted by candidates applying for the American\nBoard of Family Medicine (ABFM) Maintenance of\nCertification examination and the National Ambula-\ntory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). Eighty-five per-\ncent of family physicians are certified by the ABFM.13\nBeginning with the December 2005 Maintenance of\nCertification examination, the ABFM added a question\nregarding EHR adoption to its demographic question-\nnaire, specifically asking all candidates: \"Do you use\nan electronic medical record system in your office?\"\nThe 2005 ABFM sample size was smaller than usual\nbecause the EHR question was first added for the\nsample sizes were also smaller than usual because\n76% of family physicians who certified or recertified\nMaintenance of Certification cycle and will not return\nence was observed in terms of age and sex, however,\nBecause candidates cannot proceed to examination\notherwise, response rates are 100%.\nThe NAMCS, conducted by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS), is an annual nationally\nrepresentative survey of visits to office-based physi-\ncians and collects information on the adoption and use\nof EHRs. NAMCS estimates are weighted to account\nfor nonresponse. Statistical testing involving NAMCS\ndata took into account the complex sample design. For\nany EHR adoption among family physicians with that\nof all other office-based physicians.\nWe tested for differences between EHR adoption\nrates among family physicians in the NAMCS survey\n(NAMCS-FP) and ABFM rates for family physicians\nbetween ABFM and NAMCS adoption rates for family\nphysicians (NAMCS-FP) and NAMCS adoption rates\nfor physicians other than family physicians (NAMCS-\ndata using a 2 independent samples t test. Statistically\nsignificant differences were determined at P=.05 level.\nWe then examined the most recent data available\nfor variation in family physician EHR adoption rates\n2011 NAMCS data for office-based family physicians\nand other specialty office-based physicians. We used\na 1-sample t test to compare state adoption rates by\nfamily physicians and physicians from other special-\nties with their respective national averages. State rates\nwith a sample size of less than 15 or with a relative\nstandard error of greater than 0.3 were considered\nunstable rates and thus omitted in state-specific com-\nparisons. We then compared ABFM, NAMCS-FP, and\nNAMCS-NonFP rates for each state using the 2 inde-\npendent samples t test.\nRESULTS\nThe EHR adoption rates based on both ABFM and\nNAMCS data rose steadily and doubled from 2005 to\nin 2011. NAMCS-FP and ABFM adoption rates were\nAdoption rates for family physicians were significantly\nhigher than for other office-based physicians (ABFM\nSignificant variations in EHR adoption were observed\nacross states. Rates reported by the ABFM ranged\nfrom a low of 47.1% in North Dakota to a high of\n94.9% in Utah (Figure 2a). Georgia, Massachusetts,\nMinnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Wash-\nington, and Wisconsin had significantly higher EHR\nadoption rates than the 2-year, pooled ABFM national\naverage of 62.6%. On the other hand, Florida, Illi-\nnois, Michigan, and Ohio had significantly lower\nEHR adoption rates than the ABFM national average.\nNAMCS-FP rates (Figure 2b) ranged from a low of\n44% in North Carolina to a high of 87.6% in Hawaii.\nIt also showed a strong regional clustering for adop-\ntion. Although most states had rates similar to those\nreported by NAMCS-FP and ABFM, significant dif-\nferences were observed for North Carolina and South\nCarolina for adoption rates as estimated using ABFM\nand NAMCS-FP data (Supplemental Table 1, available\nDC1). Significant state variations in EHR adop-\ntion among other office-based physicians were also\napparent. States with higher EHR adoption among\nfamily physicians generally had higher EHR adoption\nfor other office-based physicians, consistent with a\nstate-level effect.\nFigure 1.

Adoption by family physicians exceeds that of\nother office-based physicians as a group, conform-\ning to what many have reported--that primary care\nphysician adoption rate is higher than that of other\nspecialists.8,16,17 The NAMCS EHR adoption rate by\nfamily physicians based on a random sample was not\nsignificantly different from the ABFM adoption rate\nbased on recertifying family physicians, lending cred-\nibility to these estimates. Significant state variation in\nthe adoption of EHRs existed for both family physi-\ncians and other office-based physicians, inviting fur-\nther research and policy making.\nNAMCS has included data on EHR adoption since\ncific features of computerized systems. Since 2010,\nthe sample size for the NAMCS supplemental mail\nsurvey increased fivefold to provide overall state-level\nestimates, but not by subpopulations, such as single\nphysician specialty, because of small sample sizes in\nthe subpopulations. ABFM's EHR survey question has\nbeen consistent, with 100% response rates throughout\nour study period, but it lacks a predetermined opera-\ntional definition of an EHR and data about specific\nfeatures, precluding more granular comparisons. Hsaio\net al reported a 34% national adoption rate for all phy-\nsicians having a system that met the criteria for a basic\ntions about the capacities of adopted EHRs.\nThe multispecialty NAMCS survey allows exami-\nnation of differential adoption trends among different\nmedical specialties, and the large sample sizes within\nthe ABFM data set allow adoption rate estimation at\nsmaller geographic units. Our study exemplifies how\na federally funded data set and medical board data\nset with different capacities can be used together to\nextend analyses relevant to important contemporary\nissues.\nWhat explains the significant variation in fam-\nily physician EHR adoption rates among states is\nUnreliable rate (6)\nSignificantly higher (8)\nSignificantly lower (4)\nCompared With National Mean\nPercent\nData source: ABFM Demographic File\nABFM=American Board of Family Medicine; EHR=electronic health record.\nNote: Number in parentheses in the legend indicates the number of states in each category.\nunknown. It is possible that initiatives may not exist\nto help physicians adopt EHRs in low-adoption states.\nAngst and colleagues identified 4 consistent themes\nwith regard to embracing health information technol-\nogy (HIT) among states.18 One of these themes was\n\"innovative HIT funding mechanisms,\" which offer\nfinancial support for HIT adoption, such as EHR\nimplementation, prescription drug tracking, and qual-\nity data reporting. They found substantial variation\nin states' commitment to these issues. Variation in\nthe penetration of health maintenance organizations\nor other integrated health systems among states may\nalso explain some of the variation. Large practices and\norganizations may be more prevalent in some states\nand able to more easily adopt EHRs. Whatever the\nexplanation, the interstate variability could help iden-\ntify areas for targeted interventions, eg, adjustments to\nfederal funding for various RECs.\nTwo independent data sets yielded convergent\nresults, showing that adoption of EHRs by family phy-\nsicians has doubled since 2005, exceeds other office-\nbased physicians as a group, and is likely to surpass\nmonitoring of trends in EHR adoption and character-\nizing their capacities are important to achieve compre-\nhensive data exchange necessary for health care. Now\nthat EHRs are common, important research is both\nincreasingly plausible and essential to determine how\nEHRs can improve health care and population health\nand help contain costs.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/content/11/1/14.\n",
