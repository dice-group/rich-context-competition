In 2006, women\naccounted for 27% of new HIV diagnoses, and high-risk\nheterosexual contact was the source for 80% of these infec-\ntions.1 Minority women are disproportionately affected by\nHIV infection. In 2006, the HIV diagnosis rate for African\nimplicated as an important risk factor for HIV infection in\nwomen.3,4 Understanding how the dynamics of sexual vio-\nlence affects HIV risk is imperative to develop comprehensive\nintervention and prevention efforts to combat the epidemic.\nSexual violence, including a forced first sexual in-\ntercourse, has been consistently shown to be associated with\na number of HIV risk behaviors, including sex with multiple\npartners, inconsistent condom use, higher rates of sexually\ntransmitted diseases (STDs), unprotected anal sex, and sub-\nstance abuse.5\u00ad14 However, due to the wide range of experi-\nences often grouped under the category of \u00d4sexual violence\u00d5\nin HIV research, we cannot determine whether HIV risk\nbehaviors are different for women based on the how they were\ncoerced into sex (eg, through the use of verbal coercion,\nthreats without injury, physical force, and/or use of alcohol or\ndrugs). Researchers have proposed that it is important to\nconsider behavioral specific types of sexual violence on\na continuum of severity in reporting prevalence estimates and\nFrom the *Department of Community and Public Health, The Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Nursing, Baltimore, MD; and Department of\nEpidemiology, The Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of\nPublic Health, Baltimore, MD.\nSupported by grants from the US National Institute of Mental Health\nfollowing programs and agencies of the US Department of Health and\nHuman Services: the National Institute for Child Health and Human\nDevelopment; the Office of Population Affairs; the Center for Disease\nControl and Prevention National Center for Health Statistic; the CDC's\nNational Center for HIV/AIDS, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention; the\nCDC's Division of Reproductive Health; the Center for Disease Control\nand Prevention National Center's Office of Women's Health; the Office of\nPlanning, Research, and Evaluation of the Administration for Children\nand Families (ACF); the Children's Bureau of the ACF; and the Office of\nthe Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.\nInterviewing and other tasks were carried out by the University of Michigan's\nInstitute for Social Research.\nPresented in part at the 41st annual Society for Epidemiologic Research\nThe contents of this article are solely the responsibility of the authors and do\nnot necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of\nHealth.\nCorrespondence to: Jamila K.

Among 602 adult women reporting\ncoerced sex by an intimate partner, variations in lifetime\nprevalence estimates were observed that ranged from 12%\nfor women who had unwanted sex after verbal threats to 38%\nfor women who thought it was their duty to have sex. Of\nnote, 17% of women reported unwanted sex after the use of\nThe proposed mechanisms linking sexual violence to the\nengagement of HIV risk behaviors include heightened sexual\nbehavior, easy arousal, and/or psychopathology (eg, depres-\nsion, posttraumatic stress disorder, and low self-esteem)\nleading to the inability to negotiate safe sexual behaviors.3,4,25\nIn addition, women who experience sexual coercion are more\nlikely to abuse alcohol and/or drugs as a coping mecha-\nnism.6,26 Previous research has identified higher depression\nscores, lower self-esteem, and lower self-assertiveness among\nwomen experiencing verbally coerced sex compared with\nthose experiencing physically forced sex.26\u00ad28 These findings\ncoupled with the mediating effects of psychopathology in the\npathway between sexual violence and HIV risk behaviors\nmake it plausible that women who experience less severe\nforms of sexual coercion (verbal coercion and threats without\ninjury) may have increased rates of psychopathology resulting\nin increased risk of HIV risk behaviors compared with those\nwho experience more severe forms of sexual coercion\n(physically forced sex).\nDespite the significance of the intersecting epidemics of\nsexual violence and HIVas public health problems, knowledge\nof this association has largely been limited to convenience\nsamples and has used variable definitions of sexual violence.\nThis has hindered the ability to fully characterize this\nassociation and generalize findings to the US population.\nThis study examines history and types of sexual coercion in\na nationally representative sample of heterosexually active\nwomen aged 18\u00ad44. The objectives were to (1) examine the\nassociation between history of sexual coercion and HIV risk\nbehaviors and (2) assess the strength of associations between\ntypes of sexual coercion and HIV risk behaviors among\na subsample of women reporting sexual coercion.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThe study population was drawn from the 2002 National\nSurvey of Family Growth (NSFG). The NSFG is conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention to investigate topics related to\nchildbearing and reproductive health for US women (and for\nincludes a nationally representative sample of civilian\naged 15\u00ad44 years. Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, and teens\nwere selected with higher probability than other individuals to\nproduce more reliable statistics for these groups.\nData were collected through household interviews\nresponse rate of 80% for women. Interviews were conducted\nin person using computer-assisted personal interviewing.\nHowever, to collect sensitive information on respondents'\nsubstance use, HIV/STD risk behaviors, and unwanted sexual\nexperiences, audio computer-assisted self-interviewing was\nused. Participants who completed the interview received $40\nfor their participation.\nThe study population for this study was restricted to\nwomen aged 18 years and older at the time of interview and\nwho reported a male sex partner in the past year. Women under\n18 years of age were excluded because they were not asked\nquestions about their history of sexual coercion. Of 7643\nreported ever having vaginal sex with a male, of whom 480\n(7.5%) did not report a male sex partner in the past year.\nInformation regarding sexual coercion and HIV risk behavior\nmeasures were missing from 52 women who were excluded\nthe inclusion criteria and form the study population for this\nanalysis. This secondary data analysis was considered exempt\nfrom review by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional\nReview Board.\nMeasures\nThe outcome measures were 3 HIV risk behaviors: (1)\nmultiple sex partners, (2) no condom use at last vaginal sex,\nand (3) substance abuse. Multiple sex partners were defined as\n2 or more male sex partners in the past year. No condom use at\nlast vaginal sex was assessed by reporting whether or not\na condom was used at last vaginal intercourse. Substance\nabuse was defined as use of crack, cocaine, nonprescription\ninjection drugs, or 5 or more alcoholic drinks within a couple\nof hours (binge drinking)30 at least once a month, all in the past\nyear. A summary dichotomous variable for substance abuse\nwas derived by combining dichotomized responses to the drug\nuse and binge drinking questions.\nThe exposure of interest was sexual violence character-\nistics. Sexual violence variables included history of sexual\ncoercion and types of sexual coercion. History of sexual\ncoercion was determined by a series of questions. Participants\nwere first asked to assess the degree to which the first vaginal\nintercourse was wanted using the following categories:\nwanted, unwanted, or mixed feelings. Participants were then\nasked, ``Would you say that the first vaginal intercourse was\nvoluntary or not voluntary, that is, did you choose to have sex\nof your own free will or not?'' Participants who reported their\nfirst vaginal intercourse as not voluntary, unwanted, or with\nmixed feelings were asked additional questions on the\nbehavioral specific nature of the experience; those who\nreported being threatened with injury, physically injured,\nJ Acquir Immune Defic Syndr  Volume 53, Number 1, January 1, 2010 Sexual Violence and HIV Risk Among Heterosexual Women\nphysically held down, or given alcohol or drugs at the time of\ntheir first vaginal intercourse were classified as having\na coerced first sexual intercourse experience. To assess\nsubsequent coerced sexual intercourse experiences, partic-\nipants with a history of a coerced first sexual intercourse were\nasked, ``Besides the time you already reported, have you ever\nbeen forced by a male to have vaginal intercourse against your\nwill?'' Because only 287 participants (5.0%) reported both\na coerced first sexual intercourse and subsequent experience,\nthese women were grouped with those having only a coerced\nfirst sexual intercourse experience. Participants who reported\na first sexual intercourse that was voluntary were asked, ``Have\nyou ever been forced by a male to have vaginal intercourse\nagainst your will?'' Participants who reported a first sexual\nintercourse that was voluntary and a subsequent experience\nthat was forced were classified as experiencing a coerced\nsexual intercourse experience after sexual debut. Types of\nsexual coercion consisted of the following dichotomous\ngroups: (1) verbally pressured, without threats of harm; (2)\nthreatened with physical injury; (3) physically injured or held\ndown; and (4) given alcohol or drugs, all assessed during\na woman's lifetime. These groups were not mutually exclusive.\nFurther, there was no information on the frequency of\nexperiencing each type of coercion.\nPotential confounders included in the analysis were\ndemographic and first sexual relationship variables. De-\nmographic variables examined were age, race/ethnicity, educa-\ntion, poverty level, health insurance, marital status, and\nnumber of children younger than 18 living in the household.\nThe first vaginal intercourse variables included age at first\nvaginal sex, age difference of first partner, and type of\nrelationship with partner. Type of relationship with partner was\ncategorized into 2 groups: committed (``married to him,''\n``engaged to him,'' ``living together in a sexual relationship,\nbut not engaged,'' or ``going with him or going steady'') and\nless committed (``going out with him once in a while,'' ``just\nfriends,'' ``had just met him,'' or ``something else'').\nStatistical Analysis\nWeighted percents and Rao-Scott x2 test were used to\ndescribe the relationships among the demographic, first\nvaginal intercourse, sexual violence variables, and HIV risk\nbehavior outcomes. A series of logistic regression analyses\nwere conducted for the following dependent variables: (1)\nmultiple sex partners in the past year, (2) no condom use at last\nsex, and (3) substance abuse in the past year. Factors\nconsidered statistically significant at a P value of 0.05 or\nlower in bivariate analyses or were theoretically relevant were\nincluded in the final multivariate regression models. For each\ndependent variable, 2 sets of multivariate regressions were\nperformed to determine the independent effects of history of\nsexual coercion among the entire study sample and types of\nsexual coercion among women reporting sexual coercion.\nEstimates of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were\nobtained using sampling weights provided by National Center\nfor Health Statistics. Weighted estimates are generalizable to\nthe US population of women 18\u00ad44 years old. All statistical\nanalyses were performed using SAS 9.1.31\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of Participants\nThe majority of women were non-Hispanic white\n(67.4%) and equal proportions were non-Hispanic black and\nHispanic. Over three-fourths were at least 25 years of age.\nApproximately 90% of women had at least a high school\npoverty level. Even so, only 15.5% of women were medically\nuninsured. Nearly two-thirds (63.3%) had at least 1 child\nyounger than 18 in the household, and 67.9% were married or\nliving with a male partner. Most women had their first vaginal\nexperiencing this before age 16; however, most of the\nof women had a partner who was of the same age or younger or\nwas at least 5 years older.\nApproximately 1 in 4 women reported a lifetime coerced\nsex experience, of whom 12.5% experienced a coerced first\nsexual intercourse. Among 1408 women reporting sexual\ncoercion, 34.6% were 15 years old or younger at the time of\ntheir first coerced sex. The largest proportion of this group of\nwomen reported being physically injured or held down\n(67.2%). The next largest group of women reported being\npressured with words but without threats of harm (57.2%).\nTwo fifths of women (41.0%) were threatened with injury at\nthe time of their coerced sex experience. Approximately, 30%\nof women were given alcohol or drugs.\nPrevalence of individual HIV risk behaviors varied in\nthe study population. Sixteen percent of women had multiple\nsex partners in the past year, and 15.3% engaged in substance\nabuse (Table 1). Women with multiple sex partners were more\nlikely to be aged 18\u00ad24, non-Hispanic black, low poverty\nlevel, young age at first sex, have a less committed first partner,\nand an older first partner. Women who reported substance\nabuse were more likely to be aged 18\u00ad24, young age at first\nsex, and have a less committed first partner but were less likely\nto have a college degree. Because almost 70% of the sample\nwas married or cohabitating and having a main partner has\nbeen shown in the literature to be associated with decreased\ncondom use,32 only women who reported more than 1 male sex\npartner in the past year (n = 1085) were included in the\nanalysis for no condom use at last vaginal sex. Among 1085\nwomen with more than 1 male sex partner in the past year,\n69.0% reported no condom use at last vaginal sex. These\nwomen were less likely to be aged 18\u00ad24 and non-Hispanic\nblack, but more likely to be married.\nHistory of Sexual Coercion and HIV\nRisk Behaviors\nWomen with history of a coerced first sexual intercourse\nwere 2.2, 1.4, and 2.1 times more likely to have multiple sex\npartners, unprotected vaginal sex, and engage in substance\nabuse, respectively, compared with women without a history\nof sexual coercion (Table 2). Those with a history of sexual\ncoercion after sexual debut were 1.9, 1.6, and 1.6 times more\nlikely to have multiple sex partners, unprotected vaginal sex,\nand abuse substances, respectively. After adjusting for\nStockman et al J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr  Volume 53, Number 1, January 1, 2010\ndemographic and first sexual relationship characteristics,\nhistory of sexual coercion was significantly associated with\nmultiple sex partners and substance abuse. Women who\nexperienced a coerced first sexual intercourse had a 1.9-fold\nincrease in having multiple sex partners compared with\nwomen without a history of sexual coercion; those who\nreported sexual coercion after sexual debut had a 1.7-fold\nincrease in risk. In addition, women who reported a coerced\nfirst sexual intercourse had a 1.6-fold increase in engaging in\nsubstance abuse compared with women without a history of\nTABLE 1.

These\nfindings are consistent with previous research addressing the\nimportance of coerced first sexual intercourse and life-\ntime coerced sex on adverse health effects, including the\nengagement of high-risk behaviors.33\u00ad35 Additionally, this\ndemonstrates the association between a history of sexual\ncoercion and HIV risk behaviors in a nationally representative\nsample of heterosexually active reproductive aged women,\nwhich adds to existing research that has been limited to\nconvenience samples.5\nAmong the subsample of women reporting sexual\ncoercion, only being given alcohol or drugs at coerced sex was\nindependently and significantly associated with multiple sex\npartners and substance abuse. These women may feel more\nvictimized than others because of lack of control due to\nintoxication. Attempts to regain a sense of control may be\nachieved by engaging in risk behaviors such as having sex with\nmultiple partners and exchanging sex for money or drugs.\nFuture substance abuse is also likely because it serves as\na coping mechanism.6,36 Women who are given substances at\ncoerced sex may have a different risk profile than their\ncounterparts. Certainly, further research is needed to in-\ncorporate the entire context of alcohol-induced or drug-\ninduced coerced sex events such as the location, type of\nsex partner, and partner's use of substances at the time of\nBeing threatened with injury at coerced sex was only\nsignificantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex in\nbivariate analyses but not in multivariate analyses. This is\nconsistent with previous research that found verbally coerced\nwomen more likely to have reduced self-esteem,27,28 reduced\nself-assertiveness,27 and higher rates of depression28 compared\nwith women physically forced into sex, often linked to a lack\nof condom negotiation skills. Lack of significance in the\nmultivariate analysis may be related to a mediated relationship\nwith these kinds of psychosocial variables not measured\nand/or a reduction in sample size and consequent statistical\npower to detect significant differences after subsetting to\nwomen at risk for this outcome.\nThe large nationally representative sample of hetero-\nsexually active women aged 18\u00ad44 and detailed assessment of\nhistory and type of sexual coercion are strengths of the current\nstudy. In particular, the data allowed for the assessment of\nnonconsensual first intercourse on HIV risk behaviors, which\nhas been shown to influence subsequent sexual decision\nmaking and risk behaviors. However, the study is not without\nlimitations. Although the response rate was high, there still\nmay be unmeasured bias present from women who refused to\nparticipate. Further, women who were not sexually active and\nexcluded from the analyses differed from those reporting\nsexual activity. However, the prevalence of women reporting\ntreatment for STDs in the past year in the 2002 NSFG was\n3.5%--higher than both the National Health Interview Survey\n(2.7%), which asked about treatment in the previous 5 years39\nand the 2002 US national estimate of women treated for\ntively captures the potential risk for acquiring HIV infection\ngiven the STD prevalence.\nAlthough HIV risk behavior outcomes were assessed in\nthe previous year or at last event, the cross-sectional design\nlimited the ability to establish relative temporality of\ncontinuums of sexual coercion and women's HIV risk\nbehaviors. The data relied on self-reports from interviews,\nand it is likely that history of sexual coercion and participation\nin risk behaviors were underreported; however, because audio\ncomputer-assisted self-interviewing techniques were em-\nployed to collect this information, it is likely that under-\nreporting was reduced. In addition, there was no information\non HIV status, so multiple sex partners, substance abuse, and\nunprotected vaginal sex were chosen as proxies for HIV risk.\nAlthough the proxy, multiple sex partners, is one element of\nthe risk and does not take into account the timing and\noverlapping nature of sexual partnerships, the literature on\nwomen with a history of sexual violence indicates that the risk\nof HIV is highly associated with heterosexual sex through\nmultiple relationships. Similarly, the proxies, substance abuse\nand unprotected vaginal sex are consistent with those used in\nthe literature addressing the intersecting epidemics of sexual\nhowever, that different patterns of relationships between drug\nuse and sexual coercion and alcohol abuse and sexual coercion\nhave been documented. Also, the available measures of sexual\ncoercion were not comprehensive. These questions were\nlimited to women aged 18 years and older, so we do not know\nif similar associations exist for females aged 15\u00ad17, also\ntargeted and oversampled in the 2002 NSFG. For each type of\nsexual coercion, there was no information on when the\nincident occurred; if it occurred multiple times; and for those\nexperiencing more than 1 type of coerced sex experience,\nwhether the same male partner perpetrated each act. In\nparticular, assessment of women given alcohol or drugs at the\ntime of sexual coercion was limited because of the inability to\ndetermine if these women were forced by their partner to use\nsubstances or willingly accepted the offer to use substances.\nBecause types of sexual coercion were not mutually exclusive\nevents, it was difficult to determine their isolated effects on\nHIV risk behaviors. The NSFG did not allow for assessment\nof physical intimate partner violence, which has been shown\nto co-occur with sexual intimate partner violence for some\nwomen. The interacting effects of these 2 forms of violence,\ntaking into account types of sexual coercion, may result\nin differential risks for engaging in HIV risk behaviors.\nDespite these shortcomings, the 2002 NSFG provided\nvaluable information on the dynamics of sexual coercion\nand its association with women's HIV risk behaviors in the\nUnited States.\nFurther research is needed to replicate and expand upon\nthese findings. The context of the partner relationship to sexual\nviolence should be explored. For instance, it is possible that\nsome abusive male partners may use less severe tactics to\nJ Acquir Immune Defic Syndr  Volume 53, Number 1, January 1, 2010 Sexual Violence and HIV Risk Among Heterosexual Women\ncoerce women into forced sex at the beginning of a relationship\nbut may transition to progressively more severe tactics over\ntime. These cumulative effects of sexual violence may result in\ndifferent HIV risk profiles for women at different stages of\na relationship. Future research should also use behavioral-\nspecific sexual violence measures to examine associations\nbetween forced anal sex and HIV risk behaviors. Longitudinal,\ntheory-driven research with the incorporation of depression\nand posttraumatic stress disorder as potential mediators in the\npathway of continuums of sexual coercion and HIV risk\nshould be examined with mediation analyses. Finally, although\nrecognizing the utility of prior qualitative research addressing\ncontinuums of sexual violence,15,21 additional qualitative and\nmixed methods approaches are imperative to advance un-\nderstanding of these intersecting epidemics.\nAlthough preliminary in nature, these findings have\nimportant implications for interventions targeted toward\nreducing the risk of HIV infection among women. As public\nhealth practitioners work to develop interventions designed to\nsimultaneously reduce HIVand partner violence and attendant\nsubstance abuse, continuums of sexual coercion should be\naddressed. HIV prevention for women coerced into sex by\ntheir partners may require different strategies based on the\nhistory, especially a coerced first intercourse experience, and\ntype of sexual coercion experienced. Future research may\nassist clinicians and practitioners in how they address sexual\nviolence, especially with the recognition of less severe forms\nof sexual violence contributing to the engagement of HIV\nrisk behaviors, and potential intervention opportunities at\nmultiple points if mental health outcomes are identified as\nmediators in the relationship. A more discriminating under-\nstanding of the nature of sexual violence as it relates to HIV\nwill assist in development of structural level changes to\nenforce condom use by male perpetrators, empowering women\nto improve their self-esteem and self-assertiveness, and\nencourage the use of female-controlled prevention methods\nsuch as vaginal microbicides.\n"
