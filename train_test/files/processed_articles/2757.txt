It was\nfound that whereas confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) did not provide an acceptable\nfit to the data, exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) provided an accept-\nable fit. The results of ESEM revealed that the a priori five-factor structure of person-\nality was generally consistent with the data, and all items had salient loadings on\ntheir target factors. ESEM also revealed that some of the items contributed signifi-\ncantly to more than one personality factor. The results are in line with previous\nresearch, and indicate that ESEM is more suitable than CFA for the study of person-\nality traits.\n",

This model posits that most\npersonality traits can be classified into five\nbroad domains: Extraversion (E), Openness to\nExperience (O), Neuroticism (N), Agreeable-\nness (A), and Conscientiousness (C). There\nhas been a constant demand for short Big Five\nmeasures. This need is most salient in contexts\nin which the respondents' time or energy is\nlimited. The Midlife Development Inventory\n(MIDI) Personality Scale (Lachman &\nWeaver, 1997) is among the briefest Big Five\nmeasures.1 The scale has been developed\nbased on a need to measure personality traits\nin less than 5 min to be used in national sur-\nveys where time is usually limited. The authors\nof the scale created a list of adjectives com-\nmonly used in prior personality scales to mea-\nsure the five personality traits. In pilot studies,\nthe items that had low variances, factor load-\nings, or item-to-total-scale correlations were\nomitted, and new items were added to\nincrease reliabilities on some scales\nThe resulting scale has been included in the\nNational Study of Midlife in the United States\n(MIDUS), and over 110 publications have\nused it so far. Lachman (2005) reports correla-\ntions ranging from .42 to .81 between the sub-\nscales of the MIDI Personality Scale and\nthose of the 60-item NEO-Five Factor Inven-\nFor four of the traits, the correlations were\n*Correspondence concerning this article should be sent to: Mohsen Joshanloo, Department of Psychology,\n(E-mail: mjoshanloo@hotmail.com)\n1The scale also measures a sixth trait called agency, which is not of interest in the present study.\n\u00a9 2018 Japanese Psychological Association.

However,\nthe correlation between the Agreeableness\nsubscales was relatively low (.42). This may\nbe due to the fact that the MIDI Agreeable-\nness items are largely focused on trust and\naltruism, whereas the NEO Agreeableness\nsubscale has a broader conceptual coverage\nApplying confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA), Zimprich, Allemand, and Lachman\n(2012) investigated the factor structure of the\nscale using the first wave of the MIDUS data\nfound that the fit of the original five-factor\nmodel to the data was not acceptable. After\nremoving one of the items, and allowing five\ncross-loadings and six item residual covari-\nances, the fit of the model met the conven-\ntional criteria. That traditional CFA has failed\nto support the a priori structure of the MIDI\nPersonality Scale is consistent with a large\nbody of evidence showing CFA's constant fail-\nure to support the five-factor model across\nmeasures, populations, and languages\n(e.g., Chiorri, Marsh, Ubbiali, & Donati, 2016;\nCFA's failure to represent personality traits\nresults from the assumption that each indica-\ntor should load on a single factor, and non-\ntarget factor loadings should be fixed at zero.\nThis assumption has been found to be too\nrestrictive in practice (Marsh et al., 2010).\nWhat available data show is that many indica-\ntors of complex constructs have significant\nrelationships with more than a single factor.\nExploratory structural equation modeling\nproved to be a useful substitute for CFA,\nbecause it allows all indicators to load freely on\nall factors. This results in more accurate esti-\nmates and better fit. Prior research comparing\nCFA and ESEM has shown that ESEM repre-\nsents the factor structure of personality traits\nconsiderably better than CFA (e.g., Booth &\nWhen there are no outcomes and/or predic-\ntors for the factors in a factor analytic model,\nan ESEM is basically identical to an explor-\natory factor analysis (EFA). However, ESEM\noffers a lot of advantages over EFA. Specifi-\ncally, it\nshares many characteristics with CFA that\nfundamentally distinguish it from traditional\napproaches to EFA, such as tests of predic-\ntive relations between latent constructs\nadjusted for measurement error, method\nfactors, correlated uniquenesses, complex\nerror structures, bifactor models, full mea-\nsurement invariance over groups or occa-\nsions, latent mean structures, differential\nitem functioning (i.e., noninvariance of item\nintercepts), extension of factor analysis to\nSEMs, auto-regressive path models of causal\nordering, and multiple-indicator multiple-\ncause (MIMIC) models of relations of latent\nfactors with background and predictor vari-\nables (Marsh, Morin, Parker, & Kaur,\nOf crucial importance in the context of the\npresent study is that ESEM yields model fit\nindices that can be compared across ESEM\nand CFA models.\nBuilding on the recent developments in the\nfield of personality research, the present study\nsought to reinvestigate the factor structure of\nthe MIDI Personality Scale with a recently\ncollected American data set, using both CFA\nand ESEM. Given that ESEM has never been\nused with short measures of the Big Five, the\npresent study is expected to contribute evi-\ndence on the potential usefulness of ESEM\nfor brief measures of personality.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe MIDUS III data set (Ryff et al., 2014)\nwas used. The data were collected between\n(54.9% females) with a mean age of\npants, 574 were excluded because of missing\n\u00a9 Japanese Psychological Association 2018.\ndata on all of the personality items. Hence,\nparticipants.\nMeasure\nThe scale has 26 items, which are presented in\nTable 1. Respondents indicate how well the\nitems describe them, on a scale from 1 (a lot)\nto 4 (not at all). The items were reverse-coded\nsuch that higher scores indicated higher levels\nof the traits. As shown in Table 1, internal\nconsistencies ranged from .668 (C) to\nStatistical analysis\nThe CFA model was specified based on the a\npriori factor structure of the scale. In CFA,\nbecause the items are constrained to a single\nfactor, only 26 factor loadings were freely esti-\nmated, and the 104 non-target loadings were\nconstrained to zero. In contrast, all possible\nfactor loadings are freely estimated in ESEM.\nThe mean- and variance-adjusted weighted\nleast squares (WLSMV) estimator was used,\nbecause the indicators are categorical. An\noblique geomin rotation ( = .5) was used in\nESEM. A minimum cutoff of .90 for the com-\nparative fit index (CFI) and a maximum cutoff\nof .08 for the root mean square error of\napproximation (RMSEA) were considered as\nindicative of acceptable fit. The conventional\ncutoff point of .30 for size of loading was used\nto identify salient loadings to be emphasized\nin defining constructs (e.g., Joshanloo, 2016;\nResults\nFit indices for both the CFA and ESEM\nmodels are presented in Table 2. As can be\nseen, whereas the fit of the CFA model was\nunacceptable, the ESEM model provided\nacceptable fit. The Bayesian information crite-\nrion (BIC) serves as an important index to\ncompare the fit of the CFA and ESEM models\nbecause it imposes penalties for model com-\nplexity. Hence, we can make sure that the fit\nadvantage of ESEM is not merely due to hav-\ning more free parameters. However, the BIC\nis not reported in Mplus when the WLSMV is\nused. Therefore, separate analyses were con-\nducted comparing the same CFA and ESEM\nmodels using a robust ML estimator (MLR) to\nobtain the BIC. The BIC value of the ESEM\ncating that the fit advantage of the less con-\nstrained ESEM model is enough to offset the\npenalty for having more free parameters than\nthe CFA model. Five alternative ESEM\nmodels were also tested with different num-\nbers of factors. As shown in Table 2, the fit of\nthe one- to four-factor models was not accept-\nable. The six-factor model fitted the data bet-\nter than the five-factor model. However, one\nof the factors in the six-factor model had only\ntwo salient indicators (Creative and Imagina-\ntive). It is recommended to restrict the num-\nber of factors to those having at least three\nsalient variables, because two variables lack\nreliable variance to form a nontrivial construct\nIn addition, the five-factor model is more the-\noretically sensible. Therefore, the five-factor\nmodel was considered as superior.\nStandardized factor loadings for the 5-factor\nmodels are presented in Table 3. In CFA, all\nof the factor loadings were over .30 with the\nexception of Careless. In ESEM, all of the\nitems had loadings over .30 or very close to\nTable 1 The items and internal\nconsistencies\nDimension  Item\nE .756 Outgoing, Friendly, Lively,\nActive, Talkative\nN .714 Moody, Worrying, Nervous,\nCalm (R)\nC .668 Organized, Responsible,\nHardworking, Careless (R),\nThorough\nSofthearted, Sympathetic\nIntelligent, Curious, Broad-\nminded, Sophisticated,\nAdventurous\n\u00a9 Japanese Psychological Association 2018.\n.30 on their target factor. In addition, the\nresults of ESEM revealed 78 significant non-\ntarget loadings. However, the target loadings\nwere considerably stronger than the non-\ntarget loadings. More specifically, disregarding\nthe direction of the loadings, the 26 target\ntarget loadings averaged .101. Seven of the\nsecondary loadings exceeded or were very\nclose to the cutoff point of .30. These included:\nWarm, Sophisticated, and Adventurous on E;\nCareless on N; Active and Intelligent on C;\nand Friendly on A. The factor correlations are\npresented in Table 4. The ESEM correlations\n(irrespective of the direction) averaged .18,\nwhereas the CFA correlations averaged .41,\nindicating that CFA yielded decreased factor\northogonality.\nIn sum, ESEM provided better fit and\nrevealed a large number of non-trivial cross-\nloadings, which are fixed at zero in CFA.\nThus, ESEM provided more nuanced and\ncomprehensive information on the relation-\nships between the items and factors.\nDiscussion\nConsistent with many previous studies with\nother personality measures (e.g., Chiorri et al.,\n2011), the ESEM model provided a better fit\nthan did CFA. Inspection of the factor load-\nings (Table 3) suggests that the emerging fac-\ntors in ESEM correspond to the five\npersonality factors, in that each factor is\nclearly dominated by items related to one of\nthe Big Five. All of the factors are predomi-\nnantly loaded by their target items. To a con-\nsiderably smaller degree, the factors are also\nloaded by non-target items. Thus, based on\nthe results of ESEM, it can be concluded that\nthe five-factor model of personality is largely\ncompatible with the data in the present\nsample.\nO had no salient loadings from non-target\nitems. The other four factors, however, had\nfactor loadings from non-target items that\nwere larger than or close to .30 (i.e., three\nnon-target loadings on E, one on N, two on C,\nand one on A). These salient secondary load-\nings should be considered when interpreting\nthese factors. It is also important to note that\nfive items had larger secondary than primary\nloadings, or their primary and secondary load-\nings were almost equal. These items include\nSophisticated, Adventurous, Intelligent,\nActive, and Friendly. Each of these items is\ncontributing almost equally to two personality\ntraits. If these results are replicated in future\nlarge-scale studies, researchers may consider\nremoving these five items or replacing them\nwith other items.\nCFA models of the personality traits have\nregularly been found to provide poor fit\n2007), and the present CFA model did not\nfare any better. In fact, many researchers\nhave questioned \"the adequacy of CFA\nin the study of personality structure\"\nconcluded that CFA is \"too restrictive to\nTable 2 Fit indices\nModel 2 df CFI RMSEA\nLow High\nNote. All 2 values are significant at p < .001.

For example, McCrae,\nZonderman, Costa, Bond, and Paunonen\n(1996) state that \"there is no theoretical rea-\nson why traits should not have meaningful\nloadings on three, four, or five factors\"\n(p. 553). The present ESEM results and those\nof previous research with longer personality\nTable 3 Standardized factor loadings for the 5-factor modified models\nESEM\nCFA\nNote. Loadings > .29 are shown in boldface.\nTable 4 Factor correlations\nNote. CFA and ESEM correlations are presented above and below the diagonal, respectively.\n\u00a9 Japanese Psychological Association 2018.\nmeasures confirm that items with more than\none salient loading are far from rare in the\nfive-factor structure of personality traits\nResearch in other fields of psychology also\nindicates that completely pure items of\npsychological constructs with no correlations\nwith other constructs are hard to come by\nJoshanloo, 2016). Therefore, from both sub-\nstantive and statistical standpoints, the\nrestriction of zero cross-loadings imposed by\nCFA can often be considered unwarranted\nand misleading, which can also bias the esti-\nmation of non-constrained parameters. Thus,\nthe present ESEM results converge with the\nbulk of previous research to intensify the con-\ncern over using CFA for analyzing measure-\nment models of personality.\nPrevious CFA studies of personality traits\nhave often relied on post hoc modifications\nto reach an acceptable fit. However, making\nexploratory use of CFA in personality\nresearch has been criticized. Post hoc adjust-\nments are usually misleading unless the ini-\ntial model provides a reasonably good fit\n(MacCallum, 1986). If the initial model is\nmarkedly different from the true model, as\nwas the case in the present study and in\nmany previous CFA studies of personality,\npost hoc adjustments are unlikely to lead to\nthe correct measurement model (Brown &\nMoore, 2012). Given that the initial CFA\nmodels in prior research have been typically\nill fitting, extreme caution should be exer-\ncised when interpreting the modified models.\nMoreover, it is usually ignored that con-\nstraining many non-trivial factor loadings to\nzero can make the discovery of truly misspe-\ncified loadings even more difficult. Even\nextensive post hoc adjustments of CFA\nmodels of personality may fail to provide\nan acceptable fit (Borkenau & Ostendorf,\n1990). Therefore, to achieve simple struc-\nture, using rotation of the factor matrix\n(as in ESEM/EFA) seems to be more effec-\ntive than relying on post hoc modification as\ncommonly performed in CFA (Browne,\n2001). ESEM usually provides better-fitting\nmodels, and reduces researchers' reliance on\npost hoc modifications.\nThe present ESEM results are different\nfrom the CFA results of Zimprich et al. (2012)\nin many important ways (it is notable that the\nitem Thorough was not used in their analyses,\nbecause the item has been added in later ver-\nsions of the scale). Zimprich et al. omitted the\nitem Careless from the scale due to a small\nfactor loading, which is consistent with the\npresent CFA results. However, in the present\nESEM analysis, this item had a salient loading\non C, offering no justification for removing\nit. Secondly, Zimprich et al. permitted five\ncross-loadings in their CFA model based on\nCFA modification indices, of which only one\nmatches the pattern of seven salient\ncross-loadings in the present ESEM model\n(i.e., Friendly on A). Third, Zimprich\net al. also allowed six residual covariances to\nimprove fit, which was not needed in the pre-\nsent ESEM analysis, because the fit of the\nmodel was already acceptable. This shows that\nif all of the cross-loadings are freely estimated,\nthe need for specifying item residual covari-\nances may be largely eliminated. Finally, they\nfound the factor correlations to be consider-\nably higher than those found in the present\nESEM analysis. This elevation of factor corre-\nlations is a result of the constraints on second-\nary loadings in simple-structure CFA.\nConstraining non-trivial cross-loading enlarges\nthe \"burden on the factor correlations to\nreproduce the correlations among indicators\nloading on different factors because there are\nno cross-loadings to assist in these model-\nresult is that factor correlations are usually of\ngreater magnitude in CFA than ESEM\nIn view of the pattern of factor loadings,\nresearchers are encouraged to use ESEM\nwhen studying this personality measure to\nobtain more accurate estimates. The ESEM\nmeasurement model can be readily expanded\nto include predictive relations between the fac-\ntors and directional relations between the fac-\ntors and external variables (Marsh et al.,\n2014). If using ESEM is not possible, an\n\u00a9 Japanese Psychological Association 2018.\nalternative option would be to specify CFA\nmodels based on the results of previous ESEM\nanalyses in the same population (Joshanloo,\n2017). For example, researches can include the\nsalient secondary loadings found in the present\nstudy in their future CFA models in American\nsamples. The ESEM results can also be used\nwhen analyzing composite measures (e.g., sum\nscores). An item with two salient loadings can\nbe used in calculating the scores of both of the\ntraits on which the item loads. When using\ncomposite measures, some researchers may\nalso choose to discard items with salient cross-\nIt is noteworthy that although simple-\nstructure CFA has virtually always failed to\nsupport the measurement models of personal-\nity, CFA still has great potential in personality\nresearch. The general conclusion from studies\nthat have used both ESEM and CFA in this\nfield is that CFA should not be abandoned\n(Booth & Hughes, 2014; Furnham, Guenole,\nAlthough ESEM has proved to be a better\nanalytic strategy in the field of personality, it\nshould be acknowledged that ESEM is an\nexploratory method, and is most useful in ini-\ntial stages of model building and scale devel-\nenough information on the loadings is accumu-\nlated by ESEM studies with large and diverse\nsamples, CFA studies can utilize the emerging\ninformation to develop more parsimonious\nmodels. Therefore, the main concern is not\nthe usage of CFA in the field. Instead, the\nmain concern is that more exploratory tech-\nniques, such as ESEM, are underused.\nAccordingly, personality researchers are\nencouraged to use exploratory techniques\nuntil enough information is accumulated on\nvarious personality measures to ensure that a\ntransition from exploratory to confirmatory\nanalysis is warranted.\nIn sum, given that the a priori five-factor\nstructure of the scale was replicated, and all of\nthe items had salient loadings on their target\nfactors, it can be concluded that the scale mea-\nsures the intended constructs. This study also\nillustrates that ESEM can serve as a useful\ntool in the study of brief measures of personal-\nity traits. It will need to be borne in mind,\nhowever, that some of the items of the scale\ncontribute substantially to non-target factors, as\nis the case with many other psychological scales\nence of secondary loadings necessitates the use\nof ESEM in future research with the scale.\nThese findings, if replicated in additional\nresearch, may also be considered as the main\nsource on which to rely for optimizing the scale.\nReferences\nAsparouhov, T., & Muth\u00e9n, B.
