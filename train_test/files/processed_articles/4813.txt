An extensive literature review was\nconducted, supported by field observations, individual depth interviews, and small and large focus group meetings. The\nprocess framework identified four sets of processes: national policy formulation and legislation; inventory, classification,\nevaluation, and ranking of VA; general operations management involving project management activities; and site specific\nactivities of development, operations, and maintenance. The value of the framework lies in the fact that no similar framework\napplicable to small islands was covered in the literature and validation was obtained from a panel of experts and a cross\nsection of tourism stakeholders in Tobago.\n",

TT is a country\ncomprising two small islands with Trinidad as the main\npopulation of 1.3 million people, and Tobago significantly\nwith a population of 55,000 people. The economy of Trinidad\nis based on the drilling and production of crude oil and natu-\nral gas, whereas Tobago is tourism oriented. The economy of\nthe country is based on the petroleum sector that accounted\nfor an average of 42% of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nthe Government of the Republic of TT (GORTT; 2011).\nThe argument presented in this article is that the small\nislands of the Caribbean cannot continue to rely on market-\ning efforts to sustain tourism based on natural resource assets\nsuch as beach and marine resources, but must embrace a\nmore holistic approach that includes the identification and\ndevelopment of a broad range of attractions within an effective\nprocess framework. Such a properly developed and profession-\nally managed portfolio of VA will add significant value to TT\nas a tourist destination and will strengthen the destination man-\nagement system. One of the foremost researchers of VA,\nSwarbrooke (2002), indicated that attractions are generally\nindividual entities, separate sites, or small geographical\nareas. Destinations, however, are physically larger and com-\nprise a series of attractions with relevant support services.\nImportantly, when attractions develop they evolve into desti-\nnations in themselves with services, such as hotels, restau-\nrants, and shops, complementing the attraction activity\n(Swarbrooke, 2002). The justification for VA management,\naccording to Swarbrooke, is the frequent conflict among dif-\nferent activities at sites which require a management system\nthat reconciles the needs of users with the conservation\nimperative.\nThe rationale for pursuing this study is the declared strat-\negy of the government of TT to use tourism as a major devel-\nopment pillar in the quest to diversify the economy away\nfrom heavy reliance on hydrocarbon resources as the main\nsource of public revenue (Ministry of Planning and the\nNeaves, 2012). This strategy will present a challenge\nbecause, based on the latest available data, visitor arrivals to\nreflecting the continuing impact of the global recession that\n1University of the West Indies, Mount Hope, Trinidad and Tobago\nCorresponding Author:\nHaven Allahar, Arthur Lok Jack Graduate School of Business, University\nof the West Indies, Mount Hope Campus, Trinidad and Tobago.\nEmail: havenallahar4@gmail.com\nSmall Island Visitor Attractions: A\nDevelopment Process Framework\nHaven Allahar1\n Keywords\nvisitor attractions, tourism, tourism models, island tourism, destination management\n2 SAGE Open\ncommenced in 2008 (Tourism Development Company\nThe study concept is that a major gap exists in the\napproach to tourism development in TT, which the creation\nand execution of marketing strategies will not fill. This gap\nwas indentified in the study as the absence of an explicit pro-\ncess that can be adopted by the relevant stakeholders for pro-\nviding an acceptable tourism product. In this regard, the\narticle suggests that the focus should be on developing an\nappropriate process framework that integrates the insights on\ntourism development obtained from the literature and exami-\nnation of the various frameworks and models proposed, and\nprimary research involving interviews with tourism practi-\ntioners, focus group meetings with key stakeholders, and\nconsultation with an expert panel of academics and practitio-\nners in the field of tourism.\nThe portfolio of VA in the small islands of the Caribbean\nusually comprises natural assets such as beaches, nature\nparks, historical/heritage sites, and festivals and events with\nlimited man-made attractions. The traditional approach of\ntourism promotion is to focus on destination issues such as\nexternal advertising, attendance at fairs, and entertaining air-\nline and tour operators. This approach contributes to the gap\nidentified that results in a relative neglect of the condition\nand management of the existing portfolio of VA. The focus\non VA is supported by the literature on tourism that asserts\nthat VA are the core of any tourism industry but an under-\nthe basis of the tourism destination product but have not been\ngiven the attention deserved, and a consequence of this treat-\nment is that potential VA are not of interest to tourism\nresearchers and practitioners (Kusen, 2010).\nThere is a reasonably vast body of literature on the gen-\neral subject of tourism and several journals address different\naspects of the subject, but the focus tends to be on areas, such\nas destination marketing and management, ecotourism, sus-\ntainability, cultural/heritage tourism, and generalized devel-\nopment models, which were one-dimensional treating with a\nspecific element or groups of elements of the tourism system\n(Brown & Cave, 2010). The specific area of VA is generally\nunder-researched, and the review of the relevant literature\nwas undertaken against this background.\nIn terms of the sequence followed in the article, the fol-\nlowing sections are presented: a review of the relevant litera-\nture on island tourism, destination planning and management,\nand development models, frameworks, and systems to ensure\nthe novelty of the study output; the case of TT as representa-\ntive of a SIDS; method; results; discussion of the proposed\nVA process framework and operations management process\nstructure; results verification; limitations of the study; and\nconcluding remarks.\nThe main output of the study is the completion of a VA\ndevelopment process framework (FVA) that addresses the pol-\nicy/legal superstructure, inventory and classification system,\nevaluation and ranking system, and operations management\nrequirements as these activities specifically relate to the\ndevelopment and management of VA. The framework adds\nto the body of research on VA which focused mainly on site-\nspecific management requirements despite "
