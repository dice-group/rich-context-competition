Data from population-based surveys such as the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) are the gold standard, but are obtained infrequently\nand include only small samples from certain minority groups.

Blood donor venous and fingerstick hemoglobin values were compared to 10,254 NHANES\n2005-2008 venous hemoglobin values using demographically stratified analyses and ANOVA.

Cigarette smoking increased hemoglobin by\nagreed well with NHANES hemoglobin (weighted mean hemoglobin of 15.53 g/dL for donors and 15.73 g/dL\nfor NHANES) with similar variation in mean hemoglobin by age. However, compared to NHANES, the larger\ndonor data set showed reduced differences in mean hemoglobin between Blacks and other races/ethnic-\nities.

Hematol. 87:496\u00ad502,\nV\nIntroduction\nPopulation-based measures of hemoglobin are important\nfor surveillance of anemia, which has attracted increasing\ninterest as a significant public health concern [1]. Anemia is\nassociated with reduced cognitive function in women of\nchild-bearing age [2] and increased cardiovascular morbid-\nity/mortality in those older than 65 years [3,4]. Anemia\ndisproportionately affects women and minorities [5]. In addi-\ntion, the prevalence of anemia increases significantly with\nof those older than 85 years [6]. The importance of anemia\nin the elderly will increase in the next 20 years as baby\nboomers age. In persons of all ages, amelioration of\nanemia has been shown to decrease the morbidity and\nmortality of associated disease [2].\nNational estimates of hemoglobin and anemia are usually\ncalculated using data from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Surveys (NHANES) [5,7]. This survey utilizes\nsophisticated samples designed to be representative of the\nUS population, but is limited by moderate sample size and\nperiodic sampling in time. In contrast, blood donors are a\nvery large population ranging in age from 16 to older than\n80 years who are routinely tested for hemoglobin as part of\nthe predonation qualification process. Although most blood\ndonors are white, there are also large numbers of donors\nfrom minority groups. In recent years, point-of-care mea-\nsurement of quantitative fingerstick hematocrit or hemoglo-\nbin has replaced the qualitative copper sulfate density\nmethod, and the data are now being captured in large\nblood donor databases.\nof whole blood in the United States. Of these blood donors,\n2.7 million (28.5%) were first-time donors [8]. In addition to\nthese successful donors, approximately 1 million individuals\npresent to donate each year but are ineligible to do so\nbecause of hemoglobin below the 12.5 g/dL cutoff required\nfor blood donation. Tracking demographic variation and sec-\nular trends in hemoglobin values provides an opportunity to\nreadily identify the changes in the prevalence of anemia in\nthe United States. If the prevalence of anemia in the blood\ndonor population reflects that of the overall population, the\npublic health value of this readily available laboratory data\nis significant.\nWe therefore addressed, in a stepwise fashion, the\nresearch question of how closely hemoglobin data from four\nregional blood centers correlate with contemporaneous\nNHANES data. First, we compared venous hemoglobins in a\nsubset of well-characterized donors to NHANES venous\nhemoglobins. Next, we performed a much larger comparison\nof donor fingerstick hemoglobin and hematocrit measure-\nments using a correction factor to approximate venous he-\nmoglobin. Our finding that blood donor data correlate well\nwith NHANES data validates blood donors as a new and\nreadily available source of hemoglobin measurement for pub-\nlic health surveillance of anemia among otherwise healthy,\ncommunity-dwelling individuals in the United States.\nMaterials and Methods\nData were collected as part of the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor\nStudy-II (REDS-II) from four of six REDS-II blood centers: the American\nConflict of interest: Nothing to report.\n*Correspondence to: Edward L.

The other two\nREDS-II centers followed similar procedures but were excluded from this\nanalysis because they did not perform complete blood count analyses on\nan automated hematology analyzer. Three sources of data were used for\nthis analysis and are discussed in the following paragraphs: (1) Quantita-\ntive venous hemoglobin from blood donors enrolled in the REDS-II Donor\nIron Status Evaluation (RISE) study; (2) Quantitative fingerstick hemoglo-\nbin/hematocrit from a larger set of REDS-II blood donors; and (3)\nconsent, and protocols were consistent with ethical standards and\napproved by institutional review boards at each center.\nQuantitative venous hemoglobin from blood donors in the RISE\nstudy. The RISE study enrolled 1,624 subjects, 18 years of age or\nolder, and who donated a unit of whole blood or double red cells at the\nenrolled donors had a fingerstick hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL. Of these\nsubjects, 621 were first-time donors or reactivated donors (no dona-\ntions in the previous 24 months). The remaining 1,003 subjects were\nregular whole-blood donors, men with three or more donations in the\nprevious 12 months and women with two or more donations in the pre-\nvious 12 months. Further details regarding RISE including the enroll-\nment procedures and donor demographics for the entire sample have\nbeen reported [9,10]. Hemoglobin values were measured on venous\nblood on samples obtained at enrollment using ADVIA1 2120 or\nADVIA1 120 Hematology Autoanalyzers (Siemens, Tarrytown, NY).\nQuantitative fingerstick hemoglobin/hematocrit from blood donors in\nthe REDS-II database. Shared data on all blood donations and defer-\nrals of REDS-II donors are compiled into a centralized research data-\nbases at the REDS-II coordinating center (Westat, Rockville, MD). In\naddition to information on the donation or deferral such as donation\nprocedure, donation type or deferral codes, the database also contains\ndonor demographic data, including gender, race/ethnicity, and date of\nbirth. For two of the years of REDS-II data collection, quantitative fin-\ngerstick hemoglobin (two centers) or hematocrit (two centers) values\nfor both donations and deferrals were reported by REDS-II centers on\nthe majority of both their accepted donors and deferred donors. This\nanalysis was limited to the donation and deferral records of first-time\nthese centers. There were 51,091 first-time donor records of which\n36,793 had a quantitative fingerstick measure. Donors were classified\nas first-time based on their response to the question ``Is this the first\ntime you've ever given blood'' on a self-reported form.\nthe Centers for Disease Control conducts the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2-year cycles. NHANES\nparticipants are selected using a stratified, multistage probability design\nto represent the total civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. The\nprocedures for consent, data collection and analysis are published\nelsewhere [11,12]. The sampling weights for the NHANES data include\na poststratification adjustment so that the NHANES distribution is\nstandardized to the March Current Population Survey (CPS) estimate\nof the US population distribution (Sylvia Dohrmann [Westat, Rockville,\nData for NHANES are collected through household interviews and\nphysical examinations at Mobile Examination Centers.

This was performed to increase the statistical\nwomen). Self-reported pregnancy status was used to exclude pregnant\nwomen.\nStatistical analysis--comparison of RISE to NHANES. The RISE\ndata set was restricted to donors at enrollment at the four selected\nblood centers. To compare the RISE and NHANES hemoglobin distri-\nbutions, it was necessary to adjust for the different characteristics of\nthe two populations. A weight variable was developed for the RISE\ndata set such that these strata (i.e., gender, age, race, and smoking\nhabit distributions) in RISE were standardized to the CPS estimate of\nthe US population distribution. Hemoglobin probability density functions\n(Fig. 1A,B) are based on the standardized population (i.e., the RISE\nfirst-time/reactivated donor sample, the RISE repeat donor sample, and\nNHANES samples are each standardized to the US population).\nIn separate analyses, mean hemoglobin values were calculated for\nRISE first-time/reactivated donors, RISE repeat donors and NHANES\nsubjects at the strata level. The mean and standard errors for the\nNHANES strata were calculated using Proc Surveymeans (SAS version\n9.1) to properly account for the complex survey design (i.e., NHANES\ndata were weighted). RISE donors were treated as self-representing\n(i.e., RISE data were not weighted). Mean differences were calculated\nfor each stratum and aggregated for the combinations of gender and\ndonor status (e.g., first-time/reactivated or repeat males compared to\nNHANES males), using the RISE sample to weight the calculations.\nStandard errors for the mean differences were calculated based on the\nsum of standard errors from the two mean analyses and assumed to\nbe independent.\nFinally, RISE FT/RA donors and NHANES data were combined into\na single data set and analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) as\nshown in Appendix. For this analysis, no weight variable was used\n(each record was self-representing). The motivation for this analysis\nwas to test for a center effect relative to NHANES after controlling for\ngender, age, race/ethnicity, and smoking intensity. NHANES is used as\na reference group for analyzing the center effect.\nStatistical analysis--Comparison of REDS-II to NHANES. The\nREDS-II data set was restricted to first-time donors who donated in\nfrom fingerstick hemoglobin and hematocrit were converted to esti-\nmates of venous hemoglobin using a regression model that estimated\nvenous hemoglobin from fingerstick values from the RISE data [15].\nFor each center, a separate regression model was developed for the\nconversion of fingerstick measurement to venous hemoglobin using the\nfingerstick measurement and gender as predictors.\nThe REDS-II quantitative fingerstick values were missing or not\nrecorded in the database in 28% of the records, and thus the analysis\nwas performed on 36,793 donors. As blood centers vary in the order of\noperations in qualifying blood donors (i.e., the order of donor history\nquestionnaire or fingerstick hemoglobin), some donors were deferred\nfor behavioral characteristics before their hemoglobin could be deter-\nmined. To compensate for missing values, a weight variable was calcu-\nlated for each record with nonmissing fingerstick values to mitigate bias\nin the analysis. A separate weighting procedure was used based on\nthe order of qualifying operations at blood centers. A weight class was\nFigure 1.

Demo-\ngraphic characteristics of the three-study populations are\nsummarized in Table I. First-time REDS-II donors were\nyounger and slightly more likely to be female than RISE or\nNHANES subjects. Minority representation was greatest in\nNHANES, followed by REDS-II and then RISE.\nComparison of RISE blood donor venous hemoglobins\nTo determine the validity of comparing blood donor he-\nmoglobin values to those of the general population, we first\ncompared the venous hemoglobins measured by autoana-\nlyzers in the RISE study to similar data from NHANES\ntant factor (ANOVA analysis) in explaining hemoglobin. As\nthe smoking rate is generally lower in blood donors than in\nthe general population, smoking intensity was included in\nall three RISE analyses. Distributions of hemoglobin values\nfrom the subset of blood donors enrolled in the RISE study\nwith a venous hemoglobin measured by autoanalyzer and\nmen and women, respectively. For males, values from\nRISE first-time and repeat blood donors closely approxi-\nproportionally fewer RISE than NHANES subjects with high\nhemoglobin values in the right ``tails'' and more RISE than\nNHANES subjects with lower hemoglobins in the left ``tails''\nof the curves. For females, again the RISE data approxi-\nmate the NHANES data although there are proportionally\nmore RISE than NHANES females near mean hemoglobin\nvalues, as indicated by higher peaks and narrower tails of\nthe RISE distributions. Distribution curves for female RISE\nrepeat blood donors are shifted slightly to the left compared\nto female RISE first-time donors, indicating lower hemoglo-\nbin values likely owing to the previous blood donation.\nOverall differences in mean hemoglobin were calculated\nafter stratifying each study population according to sex,\nage, race, and cigarette smoking intensity. Compared to\nmoglobin values that were overall 0.23 g/dL lower in men,\nand 0.01 g/dL higher in women. Again, compared to\nhemoglobin values that were overall 0.40 g/dL lower in men\nand 0.25 g/dL lower in women, reflecting losses owing to\nthe previous blood donation. Finally, center-to-center vari-\nability was observed between the four RISE centers after\ncontrolling for sex, age, race, and cigarette smoking inten-\nsity, with relative differences compared to NHANES 2005\u00ad\ndespite all four centers using the same methodology of\nobtaining venous hemoglobin results (Appendix). This anal-\nysis also highlighted the importance of adjusting for ciga-\nrette smoking when comparing the two databases. In the\ncombined RISE and NHANES ANOVA analysis, persons\nsmoking 10 cigarettes per day had hemoglobin 0.26 g/dL\nhigher and those smoking 11 or more cigarettes per day\nhad hemoglobin 0.59 g/dL higher than nonsmokers.\nComparison of REDS-II blood donor fingerstick\nThe overall agreement between RISE blood donor and\nled us to extend the comparison more broadly to a much\nlarger blood donor data set of fingerstick hemoglobin meas-\nurements obtained using point of care devices or microcen-\ntrifuge spun hematocrit. For all comparisons, estimated\nvenous hemoglobin values were derived from fingerstick\nhemoglobin values using a correction factor obtained from\na regression analysis of RISE blood donors with simultane-\nous venous and fingerstick hemoglobin measurements.\nHemoglobin values of demographic subgroups for both\ndata sets were compared using separate ANOVA models\n(Table II and Figs. 2 and 3A,B). Comparison by smoking\nintensity was not possible because this variable is not avail-\nable for the REDS-II data set. Generally, similar associa-\ntions between hemoglobin and age and sex were observed\nfor both data sets. For men, mean hemoglobin declined\nwith age with small differences between NHANES and\nREDS-II data except for the oldest ages (Fig. 2). For\nwomen, differences in mean hemoglobin were smaller\nbetween the two data sets and hemoglobin did not vary\nmuch with age, although a slight uptick was observed in\npostmenopausal women for both data sets (Fig. 2). The\nmain exception to similarity between the REDS-II and\ndifferences in hemoglobin between Blacks and other\nraces. Specifically, Black men had hemoglobin values only\n0.29 g/dL less than White men in the REDS-II data set,\nwhereas their hemoglobin was 0.89 g/dL less than White\nmen in the NHANES data set. For Black women, their\nhemoglobin was 0.48 g/dL less than White women in the\nREDS-II data set, whereas hemoglobins were 1.03 g/dL\nset (Table II). In other words, the differences between\nREDS-II and NHANES were reduced or reversed in Blacks\ncompared to other races/ethnicities (Fig. 3A,B).\nTABLE I.

As hemoglobin measurements\nobtained at blood centers are increasingly becoming avail-\nable through electronic databases, these data represent a\npre-existing and economical resource that is currently\nunderutilized for public health assessment of hemoglobin\nand the prevalence of anemia in the United States.\nAlthough the majority of blood donors are white individuals\nnumbers of minority as well as younger and older blood\ndonors [16]. Thus, it would be possible to statistically adjust\nfor under representation of different demographic groups\nand obtain a nationally representative sample of community\ndwelling people in United States.\nTo standardize for differences in demographic variables,\nit was necessary to adjust for imbalances in age, sex, and\nrace/ethnicity between blood donors and the general US\npopulation. It was also necessary to convert fingerstick\nhemoglobin measurement to that of venous blood [17]. We\nwere able to use data from concurrent fingerstick and\nvenous measurements obtained from blood donors enrolled\nin the RISE study to obtain adjustment factors [15]. Our\nanalysis also revealed center-to-center variability in finger-\nstick hemoglobin measurement that was relatively modest\nin scale, but nevertheless will be important to quantify in\nfuture studies. The source of such variability is likely owing\nto different point-of-care devices, differences in fingerstick\nblood sampling technique, training of operational staff and/\nor geographical variation in hemoglobin [18]. As quantita-\ntive hemoglobin measurement by fingerstick sampling\nbecomes more widespread among blood centers, it is likely\nthat operational research and quality control measures can\nbe implemented to limit the effect of such variability [19].\nDespite demographic stratification and other statistical\nadjustment of the data sets, blood donor and NHANES\ndata diverged among certain subgroups. First, the mean\nhemoglobin values for men were slightly lower in blood\nTABLE II.

Black bars are REDS-II; Stippled bars are\nAmerican Journal of Hematology 499\nresearch article\ndonors than in NHANES. This may have resulted from\nthe lack of adjustment for smoking in the REDS-II donor\ndatabase as male blood donors likely have lower smoking\nintensity than the male NHANES subjects. In our smaller\nRISE-NHANES comparison that did include donor smoking\ninformation, we found that cigarette smoking can raise he-\nintensity, values that are similar to those previously\nreported (0.4 g/dL) [20]. In the future, it may be possible to\nimpute smoking status from population surveys or to collect\nsmoking status as a routine variable on blood donors,\nwhich would also be of use for cardiovascular risk screen-\ning that is often provided by blood centers to donors\nThe hemoglobin differences between Blacks and other\nraces/ethnicities were also smaller in blood donors than in\ntheir NHANES counterparts. Lower hemoglobin values in\nBlacks are well described and persist at various degrees of\niron deficiency and following correction for disease status\nand behavioral risk factors [23,24]. As minorities are under-\nrepresented among blood donors, [16] positive selection for\nhealthy individuals among Black first-time blood donors\ncompared to the general population could explain the rea-\nson why racial differences in hemoglobin are muted among\nblood donors. Further research to determine why this differ-\nence is smaller in blood donors than in the general popula-\ntion may help to further understand the genetic and physio-\nlogical factors underlying the differences in hemoglobin\nvalues among races/ethnicities [25].\nAlthough there is good agreement of mean hemoglobin\nvalues between REDS-II blood donor and NHANES data\nsets among different demographic groups (Figs. 2 and 3),\nthere were more evident differences in the prevalence of\nanemia in Black men and women between the two data\nsets (Fig. 4). This is because anemia, by definition, focuses\non the leftward tail of the distributions shown in Fig. 1\nwhere differences between the REDS-II and the NHANES\ncurves are more accentuated. As noted above, possible\nreasons for these discrepancies include selection for\nhealthier minority persons as blood donors, lack of adjust-\nment for smoking and perhaps failure of our fingerstick-to-\nvenous conversion algorithm to account for race/ethnicity.\nFuture research can be directed at understanding these\nissues. Nevertheless, changes in anemia prevalence over\ntime should still be evident in the blood donor sample,\nallowing the identification of trends relevant to public health.\nStrengths of this study include its large size owing to the\ninclusion of electronically recorded, routine hemoglobin and\nhematocrit values from four blood centers in the REDS-II\nblood donor database. Data were collected within a Food\nand Drug Administration regulated environment, with atten-\ntion to quality control. Race and ethnicity information was\navailable from all of the blood donors participating in the\nREDS-II research study. Although this may not be the case\nfor all blood centers nationwide, increased collection of\nthese data are likely to occur at blood centers in the future,\nparticularly if new donor demographic-based blood donation\nintervals are developed. Finally, the availability of pre-exist-\ning data allowed a low-cost analysis, important if such an\napproach is to be considered for routine public health moni-\ntoring.\nWeaknesses of the study include the potential for selec-\ntion bias inherent in the utilization of a blood donor popula-\ntion that are self-selected ``healthy'' individuals and\nscreened for behavioral practices to remove those at high\nrisk for HIV or hepatitis infection. This ``healthy donor effect''\nis analogous to the ``healthy worker effect'' well known in\nthe occupational health literature [26,27]. Sources of such\nbias may include deferral of the prospective blood donor by\nthe blood center, self-deferral of the donor for perceived ill\nhealth prior to presentation at the blood center, and socioe-\nconomic and behavioral factors associated with the dona-\ntion. Blood donors are also better educated than the gen-\neral population, but educational status has little impact on\nblood donor hemoglobin values in the United States\n[23,24,28]. We believe that our statistical adjustments have\nminimized the effects of selection bias, but its effects need\nto be better understood. Another weakness is that the four\ncenters where the study was conducted are in the North-\neast and Midwest and, therefore, the study sample lacks\npopulations of donors that may be of particular interest in\nthe study of hemoglobin values, such as those that live at\nhigh altitude. Finally, although we developed a correction\nfactor for fingerstick vs. venous hemoglobin levels, mea-\nsurement error attributable to the point-of-care devices and\ncenter-to-center variability needs to be better quantified.\nDespite these limitations, hemoglobin measurement in\nblood donors represents a large scale and continuous sam-\npling of the US population. It will allow for the identification\nand tracking of population subgroups (age, sex, and race/\nethnicity groups) with increased risk for anemia. Ongoing\nas opposed to episodic measurement will allow for the\nassessment of response to public health interventions such\nas changes in iron and folate supplements to food [29]. In\naddition, continuous tracking of blood donor hemoglobin\ndata may be useful in monitoring the unexplained decline in\nanemia identified in women through the study of NHANES\npendent indicator of poor outcomes in the elderly, blood\ndonor data may also prove valuable to track trends in the\nprevalence of anemia in the elderly as the baby boomer\npopulation becomes senior citizens [4].\nFigure 4. Prevalence of anemia by race/ethnicity for first-time REDS-II blood\ndonors vs. NHANES among (A) males and (B) females. Solid bars are REDS-II,\nstippled bars are NHANES. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <13.5 g/dL for\nmales and <12.0 g/dL for females. Ninety-five percent upper confidence limits on\nprevalences are indicated by whiskers above each bar.\n500 American Journal of Hematology\nresearch article\nThe availability of hemoglobin data as well as other\nhealth screening tests such as cholesterol and hemoglobin\nA1c is consistent with the concept of the blood center as a\nhealth-screening resource for the community [21]. Conceiv-\nably, large-scale blood center data could be used to study\nthe effects of altitude and other environmental influences\non hemoglobin levels and other health parameters [30]. In\naddition, the robustness of the data may allow for improved\nassessment of current diagnostic values for anemia in spe-\ncific demographic subgroups [31].\nThe growing availability of large databases of fingerstick\nhemoglobin has also implications for the management of\ndonors by blood centers. First, blood collection itself clearly\nhas an impact on hemoglobin balance, as demonstrated in\nthe shift toward lower mean hemoglobin among frequent\nfemale blood donors shown in Fig. 1B. Analyses of trends\nin hemoglobin data in repeat donors over time may allow\nbetter management for blood collection to prevent iron\ndeficiency [32,33]. The RISE cohort study from which our\nvenous hemoglobin data were derived is attempting to cor-\nrelate hemoglobin levels with iron status and the ability of\ndonors to meet the current donation criteria of hemoglobin\n12.5 g/dL. Once this relationship is understood by more\nintensive measurements on a subset of donors, broader\nscale monitoring of small changes in hemoglobin levels\nover time could allow the assessment of minimum hemo-\nglobin cutoffs or recommendation of blood donation inter-\nvals based on the hemoglobin patterns in different blood\ndonor populations.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of uti-\nlizing fingerstick hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements\non first-time blood donors to approximate hemoglobin levels\nin the general US population. We have identified specific\nareas of potential bias and measurement error that are\namenable to further research and correction by better qual-\nity control of the fingerstick hemoglobin measurement\nwithin the blood center. Nevertheless, we believe these cur-\nrently existing data that are available at very low cost will\nbe useful for public health surveillance of anemia, within\nspecific demographic subgroups of the population. Blood\ncenters may also be able to use similar hemoglobin\nanalyses on a real-time basis for better prevention of iron\ndeficiency anemia among frequent blood donors and for\nincorporation into donor health-screening strategies while\nserving as an incentive to retain blood donor participation.\n"
