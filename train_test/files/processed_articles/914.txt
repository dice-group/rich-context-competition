Analytic results indicated that\nnon-Anglo ethnicity was not a significant predictor of disability status but that being African\nAmerican was a strong significant predictor of being a past versus current worker. The\nprimary predictors of disability and work status were health behaviors, effects of health\nconditions, job characteristics, and workplace adaptations, factors that lend\nthemselves to policy manipulation.\nKey Words: Disability, Work, Ethnicity, Public policy\nThe Role of Ethnicity in the Disability\nand Work Experience of Preretirement-\nAge Americans1\nLinda Ann Wray, PhD2\nThe literature has shown that although disability\nmay not preclude work, people with disabilities are\nmore likely to be unemployed, to work fewer hours,\nor to retire earlier from the workforce than are peo-\nRies, 1991). A disability, however, may not be the\nonly -- or even main -- factor in determining\nwhether (or the extent to which) a person works.\nInstead, the workplace may pose a greater barrier to\nwork status. Other factors (e.g., ethnicity, gender)\nmay further cloud the employment picture (see Ap-\npendix A).\nThe underlying reasons for different work experi-\nences among individuals with disabilities are not well\nestablished. For example, the incidence and severity\nof disability tends to be associated with certain\nhealth conditions as well as advancing age, ethnicity,\nbehaviors and environmental adaptations may re-\nduce the risk or experience of disability (Becker,\nSuifbergen, Ingalsbe, & Sands, 1989; Daly & Bound,\nIn addition to pathology, health behaviors, and\nenvironmental adaptations, work status among per-\nsons with disabilities is associated with preexisting\n1Support for this research was provided by the National Institute on\nAging.

Recent research on disability and work among\npreretirement-age Americans found that non-Anglos\nwere disproportionately represented in the states,\nindicating greater disability and noncurrent workers\n(Wray, 1995). Given the links between work status\nand pre- and postretirement economic security,\nthese findings may signal greater dependence on\npublic assistance programs in postretirement years\n(Crimmins & Pramaggiore, 1988; Crystal, Shea, &\nThis study's primary objectives are: (1) to investi-\ngate the effects of sociodemographic, health, and\njob characteristics on disability and work status\namong preretirement-age Americans with work his-\ntory, and (2) to discern the extent to which non-\nAnglo ethnicity, in particular, affects disability and\nwork status.\nIn the following section, the study's research de-\nsign and methods are described. The results of the\ndescriptive and multivariate analyses on current dis-\nability and work status are then presented. In the\nthird section, the consequences of the analytic\nresults for the study's research objectives are dis-\ncussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and areas for\nfuture research are proposed.\nMethods\nThis article's conceptual framework, deriving from\nVerbrugge and Jette's (1994) model of disablement,\nhypothesizes that disability status is a product of\nsociodemographic risk factors, life situation, and pa-\nthology. Individual health behaviors, symptoms, or\nenvironmental adaptations may also ameliorate or\nexacerbate one's disability status and, thereby, affect\none's work status. Disability and work status may\nthen be further modified by job characteristics, or\nwork- or society-level environmental adaptations.\nAnalyses are conducted using the Beta release data\n(pre-public use) of the 1992 Health and Retirement\nStudy (The Health and Retirement Study, 1995) de-\nsigned by University of Michigan researchers and a\npanel of national experts on employment, health and\nfunction, family and social supports, as well as eco-\nnomic status. The nationally representative HRS sam-\nto rectify past research weaknesses (e.g., insufficient\ndata on women, couples, and ethnic groups), some\n5,000 households included married couples; in the\nremaining households, women outnumbered men.\nAfrican Americans and Latinos were oversampled.\nSample Selection\nThe ever-worked study sample includes 8,701 per-\nsons who: (1) were age 51-61 at the time of the HRS\nsurvey interview; (2) reported a current work status\n(e.g., retired, worked in the past but not currently\nworking, working); (3) reported that they work(ed)\nfor others or were self-employed (as minimal confir-\nmation of their work status); and (4) reported suffic-\nient job-related data to estimate hourly wages. A\nwork-impaired subsample included 1,269 ever-\nworkers who reported that they could no longer\nwork or had some work limitations because of a\nhealth problem.\nDependent Variables\nCurrent disability status is operationalized as the\ndegree to which a person is limited in his or her\nphysical function, based on HRS questions on diffi-\nculties with selected mobility/muscle skills and per-\nsonal care:\n1 = great difficulty with or cannot do ADLs (e.g.,\ntransferring, bathing/showering, dressing,\neating without help)\n2 = great difficulty with or cannot do mobility/\nmuscle skills (e.g., walking several blocks,\ngetting up from a chair after an extended\nperiod, climbing one flight of stairs without\nrest, lifting or carrying at least ten pounds,\npushing or pulling a large object) or some\ndifficulty with ADLs\n3 = some difficulty with mobility/muscle skills\n4 = no difficulty with function\nCurrent work status among preretirement-age\nAmericans is operationalized as:\n1 = never worked\n2 = retired\n3 = worked in the past but currently laid off, on\nsick leave, or unemployed and looking for\nwork and does not receive disability benefits\n(e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance,\nSupplemental Security Income, Veterans Ad-\nministration, and/or Workers Compensation)\n4 = worked in the past but currently laid off, on\nsick leave, or unemployed and looking for\nwork and receives disability benefits\n5 = working\nIndependent Variables\nThe analytic models include independent variables\nthat the literature identifies as correlates (or poten-\ntial correlates) of disability and work status: sociode-\nmographic risk factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity),\nlife situation (e.g., marital status, education), pathol-\nogy (e.g., specific disease, injury, or congenital con-\ndition), health behaviors (e.g., smoking, problem\ndrinking, regular exercise, obesity), symptoms (e.g.,\nchronic pain, impaired vitality), and current or last\njob characteristics (e.g., tenure, occupation, bene-\nfits). The disability and work status models for the\nwork-impaired ever-worked subsample include\nthose same measures plus workplace adaptations in\nthe current or last job. Table 1a describes the inde-\npendent variables in greater detail.\nAnalyses\nTwo sets of analyses are conducted to answer the\nstudy's research questions on disability and work sta-\ntus: (1) univariate and bivariate procedures provide\nimportant descriptive information on the study sam-\nple and test regression assumptions; and (2) re-\ngression procedures test the effects of ethnicity,\nnet of other sociodemographic factors, life situation,\nhealth conditions and behaviors, as well as job\ncharacteristics.\nBecause the dependent variables are categorical,\nthe models are tested using multinomial logistic re-\ngression, using the following equation:\nln[P(Y = j)/P(Y = J)] = aj\n+ bjXi\n,\nwhere Y is the outcome variable (e.g., disability or\nwork status), J is the number of states in the outcome\nvariable (e.g., 4 states in disability status, 4 states in\nwork status) and j takes values from 1 to J-1, and X is\nthe vector of independent variables. The resulting\ncoefficients estimate the probabilities of being in\none of J-1 disability or work states relative to the J\nstate for each of the model's independent variables.\nFor more readily understood table presentation, the\nresulting coefficients are transformed to odds ratios\nthrough exponentiation:\nodds ratio = ex,\nwhere e represents the antilog of x and x is the\nparameter estimate for each independent variable in\nTable 1a.

For example,\nsomewhat more than one-quarter of all persons cur-\nrently smoke, compared with nearly one-third of\nAfrican Americans and less than one-quarter of Lati-\nnos. Nearly half of African Americans can be de-\nscribed as obese, compared with about one-third of\nAnglo/others.\nIn general, African Americans report more poten-\ntially disabling health conditions, greater difficulties\nwith function, and more severe health symptoms\nthan do other ever-workers. Although Latinos tend\nto have fewer health conditions than other groups,\nthey report disproportionately greater direct effects\nof those conditions (e.g., functional difficulty), as\nwell as more severe indirect effects (e.g., chronic\nTable 1.

Anglo/others and African\nAmericans report they are retired more often than do\nLatinos. Both African Americans and Latinos are dis-\nproportionately nonretired past workers (whether\nreceiving disability benefits or not).\nJob Characteristics. --Anglo/others are more likely\nto have been employed in higher status current or\nlast jobs (e.g., professional, management, other\ntechnician or administrative support), while African\nAmericans and Latinos are more likely to have been\nemployed in lower status jobs (e.g., service work or\nmanual labor).\nAfrican Americans report disproportionately\nlonger job tenure than either Anglo/others or Lati-\nnos. Despite the longer tenure, however, the me-\ndian hourly wage for African Americans ($9.00) was\nwell below that of Anglo/others ($11.30), likely a\nresult of lower status jobs. Hourly wages for Latinos\nwere even lower ($8.00). Similarly, Anglo/others tend\nto report more generous employee benefit packages\n(e.g., pensions, retiree health insurance) than do\nnon-Anglo/others.\nWorkplace adaptations were provided by current\nor last employers somewhat more often for African\nAmericans than for Latinos or Anglo/others. Given\nthat the 1992 HRS data were collected before total\nimplementation of the 1990 Americans with Disabili-\nties Act (ADA) employment provisions, it will be\ninteresting to examine later waves of HRS data to see\nwhat adaptation changes transpired after 1992.\nAnalytic Results on Current Disability Status\nTables 2 and 3 present the relative probabilities of\nbeing in one of three disability states versus no\nTable 2.

Given\nthe preceding descriptive statistics, one might ex-\npect to see African Americans and Latinos reporting\ngreater levels of disability than would Anglo/others.\nThese expectations are borne out in Table 2 if one\ncontrols only for age and gender. Once life situation\nmeasures and health and job characteristics are con-\ntrolled for, however, the effects of ethnicity disappear\n(Table 3). The stronger predictors of functional diffi-\nculty are negative health behaviors, health condi-\ntions, moderate pain, low energy, and tiredness (see\nAppendix B). The odds of having functional difficul-\nties versus no difficulties are affected by few job\ncharacteristics. For example, the odds of having diffi-\nculties increase for age, from 3.4% per year (some\ndifficulty with mobility) to 7.7% per year (great diffi-\nculty with personal care). As one might expect, higher\nstatus nonprofessional jobs (e.g., managers, techni-\ncians, administrative support) and higher hourly\nwages are negative predictors of having great difficul-\nties with mobility. Although other job benefits are\nlargely not significant predictors of functional difficul-\nties, spousal retirement benefits increase the odds of\nhaving great difficulty with personal care by 158%.\nAnalytic Results on Current Work Status\nTables 4 and 5 present the relative probabilities of\nbeing in one of three nonworking states versus cur-\nrently working in the full sample for two sets of\ncharacteristics: (1) sociodemographic risk factors\nonly, and (2) sociodemographic, life situation, and\nhealth behaviors, as well as other health and job\ncharacteristics.\nControlling only for age and gender, non-Anglo/\nother ethnicity -- particularly being Latino -- is a\nsignificant predictor of not currently working (Table\n4). For example, the odds of being retired versus\ncurrently working decrease by 38% if one is Latino.\nBy contrast, the odds of being a past versus current\nworker increase by 87% for Latinos not receiving\ndisability benefits and by 106% for Latinos receiving\ndisability benefits. Similarly, the odds of not working\nand receiving benefits increase 200% for African\nAmericans.\nOnce other life situation, health, and job charac-\nteristics are controlled for, however, the effects of\nnon-Anglo ethnicity on work status nearly disappear.\nAs shown in Table 5, the odds of being retired versus\ncurrently working increase quite markedly for age\n(by 24% per year), for problem drinkers, for three of\nfive health conditions, and for great difficulty with\npersonal care, and decrease for infrequent exercise\n(see Appendix B). Non-Anglo/other ethnicity (e.g.,\nAfrican American) only affects the odds of being a\npast worker who receives disability benefits.\nMost of the remaining variables are significant pre-\ndictors of being a past versus current worker, regard-\nless of disability benefit status. For example, being\nunmarried decreases the odds of not working and not\nreceiving benefits but increases the odds of not work-\ning and receiving benefits. Higher education de-\ncreases the odds of being a past worker. Negative\nhealth behaviors are important predictors of being a\npast worker without disability benefits. Histories of\ncirculatory and heart conditions as well as of diabetes\nalso increase the odds of being a past versus current\nworker. Similarly, the direct and indirect effects of\nthose health conditions (e.g., function, pain, im-\npaired vitality) are strong predictors of not currently\nworking, both with and without disability benefits. In\nparticular, great functional difficulties increase the\nodds of not working and receiving benefits.\nLonger condition duration decreases the odds of\nbeing a past worker with no benefits but increases\nthe odds of being a past worker with benefits. Non-\nprofessional occupations are not significant predic-\ntors of previously working. Additional years of job\ntenure as well as pension and retiree health insur-\nance coverage increase the odds of being a retiree\nbut decrease the odds of being a past versus current\nworker. The odds of being a retiree or past worker\nreceiving disability benefits increase strongly if one's\nspouse received retirement income (e.g., Social Se-\nSimilar patterns are repeated in the analysis of\nbeing a past versus current worker among persons\nwho are work-impaired.

The\nodds of not working and not receiving disability\nbenefits also increase notably for women relative to\nmen. As illustrated in Table 7, however, once other\nsociodemographic, health, and job characteristics\nare controlled for, the effect of being Latino drops\nout altogether and the effect of being African Ameri-\ncan decreases considerably. For example, the odds\nof not working and receiving benefits increase 109%\nfor African Americans (compared with 273% in Table\n6). Interestingly, the effect of being female strength-\nens the odds of not working and not receiving bene-\nequal.\nEducation, health behaviors, and most health con-\nditions are not significant predictors of being a past\nversus current worker among persons with work\nimpairments (as they were among ever-workers).\nSimilarly, the direct and indirect effects of the health\nconditions are no longer as important. For example,\ngreat difficulty with function increases the odds of\nnot working with disability benefits but has no effect\non- the odds of not working without benefits.\nChronic pain significantly predicts being a past\nTable 4.

As with the full ever-\nworked population, the odds of being a past worker\nwith disability benefits increase markedly for spousal\nretirement benefits. Importantly, the odds of being a\npast versus current worker decrease strongly for\nemployer-provided workplace adaptations that help\nto compensate for one's work impairments.\nDiscussion\nWhat do these results imply for the study's central\nquestion of the effect of non-Anglo ethnicity on\ndisability and work status among ever-workers? The\ndescriptive statistics clearly showed that African\nAmericans and Latinos had disproportionately more\npotentially disabling health conditions, greater diffi-\nculties with function, and more severe symptoms. In\naddition, African Americans and Latinos tended to\nreport lower job status and wages as well as fewer job\nbenefits than did Anglo/others.\nThe study's analytic results, however, showed that\nnon-Anglo ethnicity was seldom a significant predic-\ntor of relative disability or work status. For example,\nonce sociodemographic, health, and job characteris-\ntics were controlled for, non-Anglo/other ethnicity\n(particularly being Latino) was not the significant\npredictor of disability overall that the literature and\ndescriptive statistics suggest. In fact, being African\nAmerican actually reduced the odds of having some\nmobility difficulties versus no functional difficulties.\nIn contrast, net of controls, being African Ameri-\ncan relative to Anglo/other was linked to being a\nnonretired past versus current worker who receives\ndisability benefits. Two points are worth noting.\nFirst, the analyses clearly showed that disability ben-\nefit receipt was associated with greater functional\ndifficulties and health symptoms (likely the result of\nthe greater functional difficulties) as well as longer\njob tenure, as program eligibility criteria require.\nPerhaps, as suggested by Gibson (1987), older Afri-\ncan Americans with work impairments choose to opt\nout of the labor force by drawing disability benefits\nrather than by retiring because of the economic\nadvantages of the disability benefits relative to retire-\nment benefits based on their lower-wage jobs.\nSecond, other factors -- medical and social -- may\nexplain why being African American still predicted\nbeing a past versus current worker. The medical\nexplanation posits that there may be greater severity\nor co-morbidity among African Americans that is not\naccounted for in this study's models. Certainly, a\nwide body of literature has shown a continuing dis-\nadvantage in disease-specific mortality and morbid-\nity among African Americans relative to their Anglo\ncounterparts (e.g., Anderson & McManus, in press;\nJohnson, Clover, & Treasure, 1988; Rogot, Sorlie,\nJohnson, & Schmitt, 1992). Given that the effects of\nhaving more than one health condition are often not\nsimply additive but rather exponential (Verbrugge &\nJette, 1994), the model may not be picking up the\nextra hardship incurred with either the single or\nmultiple conditions of African Americans.\nIn addition, the results also support two related\nsocial hypotheses. A loose construction of double\njeopardy holds that minority status individuals suffer\ncontinuing and pervasive discrimination across the\nlifecourse that results in poorer health in general,\nunemployment or underemployment (e.g., occupa-\ntional segregation), and more precarious economic\nsecurity in later life. If one is non-Anglo and also has\na potentially disabling health condition, multiple\njeopardy may result in even more dire health and\neconomic circumstances in the pre- and post-retire-\nment years. Similarly, the cumulative disadvantage\nperspective contends that health, economic, and\nsocial disadvantages early in life may interact\nthroughout the life course to persist -- and perhaps\nintensify -- later in life (Crystal & Shea, 1990).\nIf non-Anglo ethnicity is seldom a significant pre-\ndictor of disability or work status (at least in cross-\nsection), what characteristics are? The study's pri-\nmary findings focus on four individual- and\nwork-level factors that the study hypothesized either\nmediate or exacerbate disability and work status:\n(1) health behaviors, (2) direct and indirect effects of\nhealth conditions, (3) job characteristics, and (4)\nTable 5.

These factors can lend them-\nselves to policy manipulation if borne out in future\nlongitudinal analyses.\nFor example, obesity was a strong predictor of\nhaving functional difficulties among ever-workers.\nSimilarly, problem drinking and smoking increased\nthe odds of being a nonretired past worker not re-\nceiving disability benefits. These results support\nhealth promotion programs aimed at improving\noverall health and worker productivity.\nEven more important, the effects of specific health\nconditions, rather than the health conditions them-\nselves, were more often the stronger predictors of\nwhether a person is limited in function or currently\nworks. This finding leads to two conclusions: (1) the\neffects would be nonexistent or lessened in the ab-\nTable 6.

In\nhighlighting the links between chronic symptoms,\nfunction, and work, findings of this study support\nrecent legislative and employer moves to provide for\nchronic as well as acute care in Medicare, Medicaid,\nand private health care policies. Such chronic care\nmay include disease prevention, health promotion,\npain management, and environmental supports.\nThe study also found that more generous job ben-\nefits -- particularly pension coverage, retiree health\ninsurance, and spousal retirement benefits -- ap-\npeared to afford workers the opportunity to retire\nearlier than the traditional \"on-time\" retirement age\nor to be otherwise unemployed (particularly when\ndrawing disability benefits as well). As future waves\nof HRS data are available, it will be important to\ndetermine the extent to which these benefits affect\nretirement decision making, as well as both pre- and\npost-retirement economic security.\nFinally, workplace adaptations were shown to\nbe powerful predictors of whether work-impaired\nindividuals remained in the workforce. This impor-\ntant and timely -- although preliminary -- finding\nsupports recent studies on the effectiveness of em-\nployer-provided accommodations (Daly & Bound,\n1996), as well as the intentions of the employment\nprovisions of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities\nAct.\nConclusions\nThis study found that health behaviors and condi-\ntion effects as well as job benefits and workplace\nadaptations -- rather than non-Anglo ethnicity -- are\nthe stronger predictors of whether a person is lim-\nited in his or her physical function or whether that\nperson works. These results have potentially impor-\ntant implications for modifying current disability pol-\nicies in this country.

Are all workplace adapta-\ntions equally effective in keeping workers on the\njob? How do changes in physical or psychological\nfunction affect work status? Will the structural shifts\nin the labor market (i.e., from manufacturing to ser-\nvices, with a corresponding increase in demand for\nworkers with greater education and job skills) exac-\nerbate the work experiences of persons with disabili-\nties in the future?\nThis study also found some disparities in work\nstatus for non-Anglo ethnicity that may be inter-\npreted as troubling indicators of postretirement ec-\nonomic /nsecurity, pointing to several future re-\nsearch questions. What factors -- other than those\npresented in the study models -- might explain the\nrole of ethnicity in disability and work status? If\nchronic conditions are appearing at younger ages for\nnon-Anglos than for Anglos (Crimmins, Saito, & In-\ngegneri, 1987), it may be that the conditions are\nexperienced differently across ethnic groups as well\nas by gender within groups. Do social support sys-\ntems vary, \"affording\" some individuals with work\nlimitations the opportunity to not work at all or leave\nthe workforce earlier, regardless of job benefit pack-\nages? Teasing out what may be true biological differ-\nences in the expression and experience of health\nconditions from other individual-level factors (e.g.,\nhealth behaviors) and society-level factors (e.g., po-\nsition in the social stratification system, lingering\nracism, sexism, or prejudice toward those with dis-\nabilities) remains an important research goal.\nPresident Clinton asserted in both his 1995 and\n1996 State of the Union addresses that people who\nare able to work should work. Although he was\ntalking more specifically about welfare benefit recipi-\nents, he could just as easily have been talking about\ndisability benefits recipients. According to consist-\nent evidence in the literature, the majority of persons\nin both groups (as well as many older adults) would\nprefer working over not working, providing there are\ndesirable jobs available. Just as it is important to add\nmuscle to the welfare-to-work directives, it is also\ncritical to add muscle to the disabled-to-work direc-\ntives in the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act as\nwell as other disability policies.\nReferences\nAnderson, N.

The author uses the labels African American,\nLatino and Anglo/other throughout this article as ethnic\nidentifiers.\nAppendix B\nBecause this study is cross-sectional, we cannot know\nfor certain the causal order of some of these measures,\nparticularly between health conditions or behaviors and\nfunction. For example, lack of exercise may foster func-\ntional difficulty; conversely, functional difficulty may pre-\nclude certain types of exercise.\nSimilarly, the causal ordering of health characteristics,\njob characteristics, and work status may also be unclear.\nFor example, although certain health conditions may limit\njob type or work status, job type may contribute to health\nconditions. Repetitive tasks and decreased authority are\ncharacteristic of both lower status jobs (e.g., service work,\nmanual labor) and high blood pressure, a major contribu-\ntor to heart disease and stroke. That non-Anglos are dis-\nproportionately represented in lower status jobs may\npartly explain the higher rates of high blood pressure,\nheart disease, and stroke (Anderson & McManus, in press;\nWashington Sheraton\nWashington, DC\nThis one-day conference, organized by the National Academy on Aging,\nwill bring together health care practitioners, planners, and researchers to evaluate\nthe state of providing medical care for seniors in managed care plans.\nFor more information, call or FAX:\nLinda Harootyan, National Academy on Aging"
