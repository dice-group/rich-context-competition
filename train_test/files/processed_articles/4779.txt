In Hans Thoma's painting (Figure 1 left), the banding is also a dominant aspect\nof the composition. This painting also illustrates the canonical color scheme that one encounters in\nWestern landscape painting, namely roughly a brown-foreground, a green-middle ground, and a blue-\nbackground (Clark, 1949; Gurney, 2010). Moreover, one usually encounters a brightness gradient\napproximately running from dark (below) to light (top). The omnipresence of this scheme in the arts\nsuggests that it may be a template in the psychogenesis of visual awareness.\nIndeed, abstract paintings that show the banding and the colors readily call landscapes to mind.\nThis is exploited by the artist Jason Salavon, who extracts the colors and banding for a common core of\nabout a hundred photographs (see Figure 2). The detailed content of the individual images is lost, the\naverage merely contains \"the gist\" of such pictures (Oliva & Torralba, 2006), the gist being an abstract\nentity that might well be called a \"generic landscape.\"\nAntonio Torralba and Aude Oliva (Xiao, Hays, Ehinger, Oliva, & Torralba, 2010) consider such\naverage, gist-like structures in the context of automatic image interpretation. We thankfully exploited\ntheir database of 256 \u00d7 256 pixel images randomly collected from the Internet, selecting the ones\nlabeled \"open country.\" Averaging even small subsets immediately reveals the banding and the color\nHue contrast and the sense of space\n*Corresponding author.\n68 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Albertazzi L, Wagemans J\nFigure 2.

For clarity, we also show the average as \"full colors\" (Appendix B), which are the colors\nwithout their white and black content (see Figure 3).\nThe physical reasons for the banding are obvious enough (see Figure 4). In a generic open land-\nscape, the scene is divided along the horizon into ground and sky. The sky canopy tends to be blueish,\nthe \"sky blue\" being due to Rayleigh scattering (see below). Such an environment has probably been\nimportant in human evolution (Cerling et al., 2011; Stringer, 2011). The ground is low in a typical\nimage, whereas the sky is high in the image. A part of the ground is seen at a distance that is roughly\ninversely proportional to its horizon dip, and viewed at an oblique angle that is proportional to its\nhorizon dip. Near your feet, you see earth, at a distance you see vegetation. That is why \"the grass is\ngreener at the other side of the fence\"; this is a pure perspective effect, already described by Leonardo\nfor the case of colonnades (Pirenne, 1970).\nAn additional factor in the natural color scheme is the \"air light\" (Koschmieder, 1924). The dis-\ncrete structure of air--mainly a mixture of 78% N\n(nitrogen) and 21% O\n(oxygen) molecules--\nimplies that there are appreciable density fluctuations in volumes of about a cubed wavelength of\nelectromagnetic radiation in the visual band. This implies refractive index fluctuations, and thus a\nscattering of the radiation. The scattering cross section is proportional to the inverse fourth power of\nare that the color of dark objects, that is the generic case, approaches the color of the horizon sky.\nIn clear air that means blueish. In contradistinction, the color of (very) light objects approaches its\nHue contrast and the sense of space 69\ncomplement, in clear air yellow to red. Thus, distant mountains will appear blue, whereas the setting\nBecause of pure perspective effects alone, one predicts the horizontal banding. Since the earth\ncolors are dark reds and yellows, the vegetation colors green, yellows, and occasional reds, and the\nmaximum of the Rayleigh scattering cross section lies in the blue, one predicts a color scheme from\nyellow-brown, over green-yellow, to whitish-blue, and finally deep blue, as one goes from bottom to\ntop in the visual field.\nSome colors, like reds and purples, do not figure at all in this overall scheme. They can easily be\nfitted in though. Because they mainly occur as the colors of smallish details, such as flowers, they can\nonly be expected in the lower parts of the image. Moreover, due to the air light, purples are bound to\noccur above reds in the visual field. One expects their abundance to be very variable, unlike the abun-\ndances of the yellows and blues, which are largely fixed.\nWhereas the ecological physics is thus fairly trivial, the qualities and meanings in visual aware-\nness are hardly understood, but certainly interesting. It seems likely that the psychogenesis of visual\nFigure 3. At top left 144 \"open country\" images from Torralba's SUN database (Xiao et al, 2010).

Both the banding and the color scheme are immediately apparent. The average landscape is blue and\nlight on top, yellow and dark at bottom. Notice that reds and purples do not appear in the overall average.\n70 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Albertazzi L, Wagemans J\nawareness involves a template-like gist that \"means\" something like a generic open country, perhaps\nof the savanna variety. Since this is supposedly where early man evolved, this is perhaps not too sur-\nFrom the viewpoint of theoretical ethology one might consider visual awareness to be an \"optical\nuser interface\" that maximizes our biological fitness (Hoffman, 2009). Thus, visual awareness is not\nabout \"representing the physical world.\" Rather the opposite: effective interfaces shield the user from\nunnecessary complexity. The interface is made up of abstract objects (Meinong, 1899) and internal\nfunctional relations, that are constructions of the mind, conducive to efficacious action planning. This\nis the \"counter world\" as proposed by Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll (1921). The \"open landscape\" object may\nwell be a \"generic gist,\" or template, that is of use to start off the psychogenesis. Such a notion is\nconsistent with a number of recent theories in neuroscience that propose that high-level templates are\nAccording to the neurologist Brown (2002), the psychogenetic process is best understood to origi-\nnate from hallucinations, or dreamlike states that progressively diversify and mutually compete in an\nevolutionary process, so as to eventually \"account for\" the neural activity in the visual areas, with the\nprimary visual cortex as \"end station.\" This is \"controlled hallucination,\" or \"analysis by synthesis\"\naccording to whether you are from a psychological or engineering background (Neisser, 1976; for\nsome computational models of psychogenesis, see Beal & Sussman, 2008; Bever & Poeppel, 2010;\nYuille & Kersten, 2006). The final \"visual objects\" in visual awareness are like the rigidified crust of\nthis process, unfit to further articulation. They are experienced as objects of reality. Perhaps perversely,\nmainstream thought considers them as the causes of visual awareness, putting reality on its head, so\nto speak.\nAll this may serve to explain the focus of the present research. We are interested in whether visual\npsychogenesis indeed deploys landscape-like, gist-like template structures. We intend to investigate\nthis through abstract, at first blush unlandscape-like test images. This avoids possible interference with\nsemantic associations, and specific memories.\nIn this study, we have to depend upon a large group of inexperienced observers. It was desirable to\nhave these na\u00efve observers use binocular viewing, as this saves session time, and is very likely to\ndecrease the fraction of inevitably unreliable results. However, the chromostereopsis effect (Kishto,\n1966) might conceivably necessitate the use of monocular viewing. (See below.) Hence, we piloted\nwith three experienced observers of which two are very familiar with the effects of chromostere-\nopsis and do experience its generic effect, whereas the third is experienced in many kinds of visual\nFigure 4.

The light ray from the distant mountain Q never makes it to the\neye because it is scattered out of the beam. (Notice that \"light\" and \"visual\" rays have opposite directions!) In\ncontradistinction, the light ray from the sun P is scattered into the beam and reaches the eye from the direction\nof the mountain. The sky canopy fills the upper part of the visual field.

As expected in our stimulus configuration (see below), we did\nnot find any significant differences between monocular and binocular viewing. Thus, we decided on\nbinocular presentation.\nThe participants were 15 students from Trento University who participated in order to gain credits for\ntheir study program, as well as 20 postgraduate students, postdocs, and staff from the University of\nLeuven, who participated as volunteers. In all cases, we obtained affirmed consent. Thus, our study is\nbased on a total of 35 participants.\n2.2Experimental procedure\nThe stimuli were presented on an LCD screen measuring 15\" over the diagonal, subtending 1,280 \u00d7\n800 pixels. The screen was calibrated and linearized via the SuperCal program (BergDesign, 2014).\nDetails of the calibration can be found in Appendix A.\nThe screen background pattern had 1,500 polygonal cells of random shape and gray values. The\nobservers sat at 57 cm from the screen in an otherwise darkened room. Viewing was binocular.\nThe stimuli were 500 pixels square, that is 12.5\u00b0 square in the visual field, positioned at the center\nof the screen. The response device was a keyboard.\nThere were necessarily (very) minor physical differences between the Trento and Leuven setups,\nbut these are unlikely to be of importance. The task is a very global one, and minor details of the pro-\ncedure are not likely to matter much.\n2.3Stimulus configuration\nA typical stimulus image is shown in Figure 5 left. It is made from a texture of random, convex poly-\ngons, randomly filled with either of two colors, the probabilities changing gradually so as to form a\nfuzzy, ragged edge. Such a configuration is somewhat reminiscent of a painting, it looks \"material,\"\nwhereas a two-panel array of flat colors would look flimsy and immaterial in comparison. In Figure 5\nleft, the fuzzy edge is vertical. Each such pattern will reappear four times, with the yellow on the right\n(shown), the top, the left, and the bottom.\nThe basic patterns are defined by a pair of colors. These colors are selected from the set {yellow,\nyellow-green, green, green-cyan, cyan, cyan-blue, blue, blue-magenta, magenta, magenta-red, red,\nred-yellow}, all pairs being presented in equal numbers. The RGB-coordinate values are either 0, 0.5,\nFigure 5. Left: One of the stimulus patterns. In this one, the separation (\"fuzzy edge\") is vertical, with the yellow\non the right. In the experiment, this pattern will reappear four times, with the yellow on the right side (shown),\nthe top side, the left side, and the bottom side. Correct responses are \"left side\" and \"right side.\" Thus, \"top side\"\nor \"bottom side\" indicate \"sloppiness\" in this example. Right: One of the catch trials. The stippled line divides\nthe two panes, taking over the role of the hue boundary. Here, the correct response is \"top side.\" Anything else\nindicates \"sloppiness.\"\n72 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Albertazzi L, Wagemans J\nor 1. Notice that red-yellow = {1, 0.5, 0} is usually called orange, and so forth, but we are not inter-\nested in color naming issues here. Thus, there are 4 \u00d7 12(12 - 1)/2 = 264 distinct stimulus pairs. The\nstimuli were presented in an overall randomized order.\nFor the 20 observers of the Leuven group, the regular trials were interspersed with 10% catch trials\n(Figure 5 right). The catch trials were monochrome photographs in which the nearest image side was\nimmediately obvious because the division into two \"panels\" was made graphically explicit (Figure 5\nright). There were catch trials for each fuzzy edge, and the catch trials were presented in all four ori-\nentations. They were randomly intermixed between the regular trials.\nAs all observers got all catch trials right, these were not further used in the analysis. Importantly,\nthis indicates that the observers indeed understood the task.\nThe task of the observer was to decide which side of the square is closest, and to indicate this judgment\nby way of the corresponding left, right, up, or down arrow keys. Observers were asked to react imme-\ndiately, on their gut feeling, since their reflective thought would be useless anyway. They were told to\nproceed at their own pace, and that they would be presented with hundreds of instances--this serves to\ndiscourage reflective thought. In practice, they went quickly through all trials, and, in retrospect, and\naccording to their reactions, apparently enjoyed it. The patterns appear visually attractive.\nPerhaps surprisingly, no one complained that the task made no sense. After all, it really does not\nmake much sense, for it is far from obvious why one color should appear \"closer\" than another. When\nobservers come up with essentially random answers that would be fully acceptable to us.\n2.5Experimental data\nThe single-observer data from a session yields 264 answers in the range {right, top, left, bottom}. We\nattempt to account for the results through a linear order of \"closeness\" of the 12 colors.\nFinding the best linear order for a full set of pairwise comparisons is a standard problem. Of\ncourse, such a best order is not likely to account for the data exactly, reason being that one attempts to\naccount for 264 answers through only 11 degrees of freedom. We quantify this through an appropriate\nfigure of merit.\nFrom a simulation we know the distribution of this figure of merit for a randomly responding\nobserver, which enables us to judge the significance of a result. It is an objective measure of the self-\nconsistency of an observer's response. We present further detail below.\nA total of 35 observers completed the experiment. Their data can be checked in various ways. For\ninstance, since it is always visually obvious whether the \"fuzzy edge\" is horizontal or vertical, observ-\ners should (ideally) never respond with \"left\" or \"right\" for a horizontal fuzzy edge, or with \"up\" or\n\"down\" for a vertical fuzzy edge. Yet, they sometimes do; it happened in 0\u00ad31% of the cases. Nine ob-\nservers show more than a 1% fraction of such slips, we mark them as \"type B observers.\". Notice that\nit is perfectly possible that these type B observers are indeed unable to detect the transition between\nthe two hues. But, although admittedly possible, we doubt it on the basis of our own experiences. Type\nB observers are perhaps to be considered \"sloppy.\"\nFor each observer, we determine the best linear order for the depth of the hues. We do this by way\nof a simple voting procedure. For each hue, we count how many times the hue was judged as closer.\nThis yields a voting order.\nGiven the voting order, we test whether observers respond systematically on a given hue-pair\nindependently of orientation. We find that observers vary widely in the coherence of their data, with\none, evidently extreme, observer essentially responding randomly. The coherence is expressed in\nterms of the figure of merit, which is defined in analogy with Kendall's tau, on the basis of the number\nof actual judgments that were correctly postdicted on the basis of the fitted linear order. The figure of\nAs a first step in grading the data, we defined the lower quartile range of the figure of merit as\n\"type C observers,\" and set them apart from the main overall analysis. Notice that it is perfectly pos-\nsible that these type C observers have no particular association between depth order and hue differ-\nences at all. In the context of our study, they might perhaps be considered \"weak\" observers. The lower\nquartile value for the figure of merit is 0.383. We find that there are nine type C observers.\nHue contrast and the sense of space 73\nThe significance limit for the figure of merit, as determined through simulation of a virtual \"ran-\ndom observer,\" is 0.27. We find that four of the nine \"type C observers\" have figures of merit that are\nnot significantly different from 0. Moreover, four of the nine type C observers are also in the \"type B\"\ncategory. One of these observers does not respond significantly different from a simulated fully ran-\ndom observer. We take this as an indication that these nine observers should be excluded from the main\noverall analysis of the data, so we decided to treat them as a special group. Seven of these are from\nthe Trento location (47% of the Trento observers), two from the Leuven location (10% of the Leuven\nobservers). This is perhaps not too surprising, given the fact that the Trento group was composed of\nstarting students working for credits, whereas the Leuven group was composed of postgraduate stu-\ndents, postdocs, and staff working in vision research.\nOf the 35 observers there are 21 that are neither type B, nor type C. We refer to them as \"type A\nobservers\". Notice that \"type B\" and \"type C\" may mean that these observers have difficulty detecting\nthe orientation of the division between the hues, and/or that they have no associations between depth\norder and hue differences. The terms are only used in the context of the method, in order to sort varie-\nties of observers.\nThe second step is more complicated. An initial analysis of the individual observers suggested to\nus that they come in two categorically different groups. In order to investigate this, we performed a\ncluster analysis using the squared Euclidean distance function on the votes, and applying Mathemati-\nca's default method. This indeed results in two clusters of roughly similar size (16 and 10). There is no\nmarked relation between location (Trento or Leuven) and cluster membership (Table 1).\nWe find that the clusters are well separated (Figure 6 left) as seen from a variety of directions.\nIntercluster distances between point pairs are significantly larger than intracluster pairwise distances.\nApparently, there exist two categorically distinct groups of observers. Either cluster is evidently dis-\ntinct from the set of type C observers (Figure 6 right).\nWe discuss the data for the three groups (type C observers, cluster I, cluster II) separately. Notice\nthat both the detection of the type C observers, as well as the clustering was done fully automatically,\nwithout any subjective intervention.\nFigure 6. Left: The projections of all observers on a number of principal component planes. The observers in\ncluster I plotted in red, those in cluster II in blue. The centers of the clusters were defined as their barycentra.\nNotice that the first four principal components explain more than 80% of the variation in the voting orders,\nthus this figure yields a fair impression of the clusters. Right: Smooth histograms of the figure of merit (FOM)\ndistribution over the type C observers, and the two clusters (black: type C observers; red: cluster I; blue: cluster II).\nTable 1.

Four of these are also in the \"type B\" category. One observer\ncannot be differentiated from an observer responding randomly.\nThe color fuzzy edge is evidently not the only depth cue. An obvious candidate is position in the\npicture. One expects the lower side to have a bias to be seen as \"nearer.\" There is indeed evidence that\nthis played a role. From the 2,376 responses, we counted\ncases, whereas one expects 594 in each case. We expect observers to make a binary choice for\neach trial, that is either between left side/right side, or between lower side/upper side. Thus, the stand-\nard deviation from the binomial distribution is 17.2. Apparently, position in the picture is a rather\npowerful cue. The lower side is much more likely to be judged closer than the upper side, the differ-\nence is almost 16 standard deviations. Notice that there is also an overrepresentation of right over left\nof about 5 standard deviations.\nOf course, we designed our method to be insensitive to these strong biases, which were to be\nexpected.\nThe voting orders for this group of observers do not mutually correlate very well (pairwise Kend-\nall tau's vary between -0.75 and +0.85), as is to be expected since their individual figures of merit are\nvery low to begin with. The median value of 0.17 is not significantly different from zero (the standard\ndeviation for random observers is 0.23). A conservative assessment is that this group of participants\ngives no reason for one to assume that color is a significant factor in the observed depth-orders at all.\nThis group involves 16 participants. Three of these observers are in the \"type B\" category.\nWe again check the distribution over sides. From the 4,224 responses, we counted\ncases, whereas one expects 1,056 with standard deviation 23.0 for each case. Apparently, position\nin the picture is a rather powerful cue. The lower side is much more likely to be judged closer than the\nupper side, the difference is more than 16 standard deviations. Right-left bias is not significant, the\ndifference being less than a third of the standard deviation.\nAs expected, the orders derived for the participants in this cluster correlate well with each other.\nThe range of the pairwise rank correlations (Kendall's tau) is -0.27 to 0.89, median 0.44, interquartile\nrange from 0.27 to 0.61. The lowest value is evidently an outlier, being lower than the 5% quantile\nIn Figure 7, we show the overall linear depth order for the cluster as a whole. The interquartile\nranges are much smaller than the total range, thus the hue order indeed \"resolves\" the depth range to\nsome extent. The brightness of the colors carries hardly any relation to the height in the picture.\nThe hue index range between 0 and 5 occurs in the averaged landscape photographs. In this range,\nheight in the picture increases monotonically with the hue index (Kendall's tau 0.73; p-value 0.011).\nThere appears to be no obvious relation between height and brightness (Kendall's tau -0.36; p-value\n0.038). Note that the rank correlation is negative in this case (see below).\nThis group involves 10 participants. Two of these observers are in the \"type B\" category.\nWe again check the distribution over sides.

Apparently, position\nin the picture is a rather powerful cue. The lower side is much more likely to be judged closer than the\nupper side, the difference is about 16 standard deviations. There is also an overrepresentation of right\nover left, of a little over 4 standard deviations.\nAs expected, the orders derived for the participants in this cluster correlate well with each other.\nThe range of the pairwise rank correlations (Kendall's tau) is -0.03 to 0.88, median 0.53, interquartile\nIn Figure 8, we show the overall linear depth-order for cluster II as a whole. The interquartile\nranges are much smaller than the total range, thus the hue order does \"resolve\" the depth range to some\nextent. The order in the range of hue indices 0\u00ad5 is indeterminate (Kendall's tau 0.07; p-value 0.42).\nFor cluster II, the brightness increases monotonically with the height in the picture (Kendall's tau 0.64;\np-value 0.002). Note that this contrasts with the direction of the correlation in Cluster I.\nWe obtain three groups, a group of participants for which hue and depth appear unrelated (type C), and\ntwo groups (clusters I and II) for which there is a significant relation, although the latter two groups\nare mutually quite different.\nFigure 7.

The reds occur mainly in the bottom half, the\npurples in the midrange. This is indeed to be expected on generic ecological grounds, since these\ncolors are due to various stray foreground details, such as flowers. We have no statistics to corroborate\nthis speculation.\nAn alternative explanation for the hue dependence will immediately occur to those with some\nbackground in color science. It is generally understood in the art world that \"warm colors come for-\ndifferent group from the participants in the present study, all from the University of Trento) on a five-\npoint \"warm\" to \"cold\" scale. Perhaps surprisingly, this yields very coherent data (Figure 10). Appar-\nently, even a group of fully na\u00efve observers is spontaneously able to make warm\u00adcold distinctions.\nIn Figure 11 top, we present scatter plots of the range-normalized fore-aft against the warm\u00adcool\nvalues for all clusters. None of the rank correlations is impressive. Given that the Kendall's tau rank\ncorrelations between weak observers range from -0.75 to 0.85, one concludes that the warm\u00adcold\ndimension is irrelevant for this group. For both clusters I and II, more than half of the correlations\nbetween observers is higher than that between the warm\u00adcold values and the median fore-aft values.\nThe highest interobserver correlations are more than 0.8, whereas the correlation with the warm\u00adcold\ndimension is only 0.41 (cluster I) or 0.42 (cluster II). The latter values are slightly larger than the 95%\nquantile of the rank correlation between two random observers, which is 0.364. Thus, there exists only\na marginal correlation.\nA combined plot of the median fore-aft values and the warm\u00adcool values against the hue index\n(Figure 11 bottom) suggests that the rank correlations may not reveal the full story, since a well-chosen\n\"phase shift\" would very likely increase them significantly. We return to this issue in the general con-\nclusions section.\nThe so-called \"chromostereopsis\" (Kishto, 1966), mentioned above, is another factor to consider.\nIt is due to the influence of the chromatic aberrations of the eye. Three core cluster I observers did\nthe experiment both monocularly and binocularly, with no significant difference in the result, which\nalready suffices to rule the effect out as a relevant causal factor. Moreover, chromostereopsis fails to\nexplain the fact that we find distinct clusters of observers, since all observers necessarily agree in the\nFigure 9.

Furthermore, we find no significant differences between the verti-\ncal and horizontal presentations, so disparity does not play a role.2 In the pattern of cluster II, red is\nnearest, yellow and cyan most remote, blue in the middle, which is fully at odds with the chromatic\naberration predictions. Thus, we are convinced that chromostereopsis fails to account for our findings.\n5 Conclusions\nOur results clearly indicate that hue differences evoke impressions of depth-order in the majority of\nobservers. This happens independently of factors such as orientation, or location in the image. As an\nobjective empirical fact, one might take it as the main result of the study.\nA striking effect, present in all participants, is that the lower side of an image is far more likely to\nbe judged closer than the upper side is. This is perhaps not all that surprising, but it is certainly a strik-\ning feature of our data. It is unlikely to have to do with color, because informal observations reveal the\nsame effect in monochrome photographs, or even line drawings. Although generally acknowledged,\nand often mentioned in drawing or painting instructions, we have not seen it documented from exten-\nsive psychophysical data. More surprising is that the right side is more likely to be judged closer than\nthe left side in all cases, except for cluster I. Although less marked than the top\u00adbottom asymmetry,\nthis is also a remarkable bias.\nThe strong top\u00adbottom bias is very likely due to a major ecological asymmetry, related to the basic\nfact that we tend to view the scene in front of us while standing upright--at least most of the time. It\nis evidently a template structure deployed in the psychogenesis of visual awareness.\nThe left\u00adright bias, does not easily yield to such an argument. It might well be a response bias.\nOtherwise, one expects that it might be culturally determined, but we really can't say. Only cross-\ncultural studies might prove the validity of such expectation/assumption.\nThe standard account in the visual arts is that warm comes forward, whereas cool recedes. This is\nused in the articulation of pictorial relief by spatially selective \"warming\" or \"cooling\" the color. We\ndo not clearly see that in the results, there exists only a minor correlation. On the basis of this finding,\nwe did not pursue this hypothesis.\nOf course, it is not evident why the warm\u00adcold dimension should be interpreted to at least partially\n\"explain\" the fore-aft dimension, instead of the other way around. We notice merely some correlation.\nAlthough the correlations between the fore-aft and warm\u00adcold dimensions are indeed minor, \"eye-\nballing\" the combined plots shown in Figure 11 bottom suggests that there might be a relation different\nfrom a mere monotonic dependence. It appears that there exists a \"phase shift\" between these relations\nthat accounts for much of the low correlation. This shift is in different directions for clusters I and II.\n1The chromatic aberration is due to the dispersion of water, which is the effective optical medium for the cornea,\nlens, and vitreous body.\n2We tested the blue/cyan against the red/yellow pairs, the two spectral limits. This involves 128 cases, and should\nshow up possible chromatic aberration effects. The Wilson score intervals (Wilson, 1927) for the vertical and\nhorizontal separations overlap by 56% at the 5% level. Thus no chromatic aberration effect is detectable.\nFigure 10. Judgment of color quality on a warm\u00adcold scale. Warm is up, cold down. Red is the warmest color,\nblue the coldest. Green and magenta are neutral. Notice that we plotted two full hue-index cycles for the sake of\nvisual clarity.\n78 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Albertazzi L, Wagemans J\nThe shifts are quite large, amounting to the difference between yellow and green. This seems a poten-\ntially rewarding topic for future research. The \"warm\u00adcold\" dimension is likely to be another template\nwhose evolutionary origin deserves to be studied.\nIt is tempting to speculate that the hue dependence reported in this study might also be related\nto ecological factors. Of course, there is not really a way to show this conclusively, it can at best be\nforged into a reasonable proposition. Although we do not have the extensive databases one would\nprefer, it is at least possible to predict the hue order from theoretical ecological physics. Moreover,\nthere exist plenty of photographs on the Internet that allow one to collect some statistics. The distribu-\ntion of white, black, and color content, including hue, for the set of 144 open landscape photographs\n(Xiao et al., 2010), is shown in Figure 12. It is evident that both the yellow\u00adblue and the black\u00adwhite\ngradients correlate well with the low\u00adhigh position in the image.\nWe find that the statistics on sets of random landscape photographs yield very robust results\n(Figure 12), which correlate well with the expectations from theoretical ecological optics. When con-\nfronting such data with our data, we find that there exist two groups of observers, roughly of equal size,\nsuch that one (our cluster I) correlates with the predicted hue dependence, and the other (our cluster II)\nwith the predicted brightness dependence.\nSo much for the facts, what to make of them? We venture that many human observers have either\na generic hue, or a generic brightness--or perhaps both--template that shows up in the results of their\npsychogenesis of visual awareness. Such a template might act as a \"gist\" that could serve to start up an\nopen landscape oriented \"analysis by synthesis\" cycle (Neisser, 1976). Confronted with the \"abstract\npaintings\" in our experiment, this might well lead to the observed effects. Such a template might\nconceivably be a remnant from the period that early prehumans roamed the African savannah (String,\nIn order to investigate such a possibility, it would be of interest to study the influence of field\nsize, whether observers have both a hue and a brightness template depending upon the situation, and\nso forth. It is perhaps remarkable that we detect significant trends even in the case of only moderately\nlarge pictures. One would expect such trends--if any--primarily in large field displays. It is equally\nFigure 11. Top: Scatterplots of the median fore-aft against the warm\u00adcool values for the three groups. All values\nwere normalized to the [0,1] range, in order to aid in the visualization. The blue lines are best linear fits, their\nslopes are 0.63 (cluster I), 0.49 (cluster II), and 0.46 (weak observers). The Kendall's tau rank correlations are\nII), and 0.55 (weak observers). Bottom: Here, the median fore-aft (red) and warm\u00adcool (blue) values have been\nplotted both, as a function of the hue index. One believes to spot \"phase shifts\" that are quite different for the\nvarious clusters.\nHue contrast and the sense of space 79\nremarkable that the template works in other than the \"standard\" orientation. Moreover, it seems a\npriori likely to us that the two modes--hue and brightness--are part of the make-up of virtually any\nobserver, and that the dichotomy here is at least partly induced by the particular setting. This suggests\na number of further studies, involving a much more extensive sample from the population than could\nbe used here.\nWe suggest the existence of a generic \"landscape template\" in human vision. Of course, this can-\nnot be more than a suggestion. This should not detract from the main finding of the study though: most\nhuman observers associate depth order with hue differences or brightness gradient in a remarkably\nsystematic manner.\n"
