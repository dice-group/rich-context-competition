Particpants\nwere interviewed about sociodemographic and medical data, including whether they had been\ndiagnosed with diabetes, and were examined for height, weight, and fasting plasma glucose level\n126 mg/dl or by previous physician diagnosis. After categorizing participants into normal\nweight, overweight, and obese according to BMI, the prevalance and diagnosis of diabetes across\nBMI categories was compared using 2.\nRESULTS -- Of the 9.8% (weighted sample) of participants who had diabetes, based on\nfasting glucose levels and self-reported diagnosis, 28.1% were undiagnosed, translating to an\nestimated 5.2 million people in the U.S. population. The proportion undiagnosed was not\nsignificantly different among normal-weight (22.2%), overweight (32.5%), or obese adults\n(27.4%). Nevertheless, obese adults comprise more than half of the undiagnosed diabetes cases\n(2.7 million). Relative to normal-weight adults, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for having undi-\nCONCLUSIONS -- Despite a higher underlying risk of diabetes and widespread clinical\nrecognition of this higher risk, obesity does not increase the likelihood that an individual's\ndiabetes will be diagnosed.\nThe rise in obesity has led to a com-\nparable rise in type 2 diabetes, a ma-\njor cause of death, morbidity, and\ndisability (1,2). National guidelines dif-\nfer, however, on whether screening\nasymptomatic individuals is recom-\nmended (3,4). The American Diabetes As-\nsociation advocates screening adults aged\n45 years and older, whereas the U.S. Pre-\nventive Services Task Force found insuf-\nficient evidence to recommend mass\nscreening (3,4). Lack of uniform screen-\ning guidelines and potential delays in di-\nagnosing diabetes is of particular concern\nin obese populations, not only because of\ntheir high risk for developing diabetes but\nalso because evidence suggests that obese\nindividuals experience healthcare dispar-\nities that include delays in receiving pre-\nventive care (5). We examined whether\nBMI category affects the likelihood of hav-\ning undiagnosed diabetes among U.S.\nadults.\nMETHODS --We used data from the\ntion Examination Survey (6). Participants\nwere interviewed about sociodemo-\ngraphic and medical data, including\nwhether a doctor had diagnosed them\nwith diabetes, age at diagnosis, and\nwhether they were taking medications for\ndiabetes. Physical and laboratory exami-\nnation included measured height and\nweight and, in half the sample, fasting\nblood plasma glucose; our study included\nall adults 20 years of age with recorded\nfasting plasma glucose.\nWe calculated BMI from measured\nheight and weight and classified partici-\nexcluded underweight (BMI 18.5 kg/\nm2) participants and women who were\npregnant.\nParticipants were defined as having\nevidence of diabetes if a doctor told\nthem they had diabetes or if their fasting\nglucose was 126 mg/dl based on\nAmerican Diabetes Association criteria\n(7). We classified participants with dia-\nbetes as diagnosed if they were aware of\ntheir condition.\nWe compared the prevalence and di-\nagnosis of diabetes across BMI categories\nusing 2 tests. We developed multivari-\nable models to examine the association\nbetween BMI and undiagnosed diabetes\nadjusting for relevant confounders (Table\n1). The National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey does not distinguish\ntype 2 (adult onset) diabetes from type 1\ndiabetes; therefore, we repeated our pri-\nmary analyses excluding participants di-\nagnosed before age 30 years who were on\ninsulin.

Obese adults account for 2.7 mil-\nlion cases, or more than half of the 5.2\nmillion cases, of undiagnosed diabetes\neach year in the U.S.\nOur findings complement those of\nGregg et al. (8) who examined trends in\ndiagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes by\nweight category. While that study did\nnot specifically compare the likelihood\nof having undiagnosed diabetes across\ndifferent BMI groups, Gregg et al. did\nfind that adults with moderate to severe\nobesity had the largest relative decline\nin the ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed\ndiabetes.\nThe finding that adults with higher\nBMI are no more likely than those with\nlower BMI to have their diabetes diag-\nnosed is somewhat unexpected given\nthe widespread recognition of obesity's\npredisposition toward diabetes. One\nreason may be that a disproportionate\nnumber of normal-weight adults identi-\nfied with diabetes have type 1 diabetes,\nwhich often produces symptoms earlier\nin the disease course. Delays in diagno-\nsis in overweight and obese adults who\nare at higher risk of type 2 diabetes may\nreflect delays in experiencing, recogniz-\ning, and presenting symptoms of diabe-\ntes in a timely manner. Competing\nhealth concerns, social stigma, and\nhealth system bias, however, may also\ncontribute to this phenomenon (9,10).\nFurthermore, because some guide-\nlines do not recommend systematic\nscreening, clinicians may place lower\npriority on screening for diabetes in fa-\nvor of more established preventive mea-\nsures. Given the higher risk of diabetes,\nlack of systematic screening has greater\nimplications for obese adults. Even\nthough obese adults comprise only one\nthird of the general population, they\ncomprise more than 50% of U.S. adults\nwith undiagnosed diabetes. Studies\nsuggest that routine screening for dia-\nbetes is highly cost-effective (11). How-\never, whether pharmacologic treatment\nof early type 2 diabetes yields benefits\nthat outweigh the potential costs of\nscreening and early diagnosis is unclear.\nNevertheless, timely diagnosis may lead\nto indirect benefits, especially among\nthose with overweight and obesity, by\nmotivating efforts to control weight and\nenact lifestyle changes such as improv-\ning diet and exercise, which have been\nshown to reduce the risk of developing\ndiabetes (12). Future studies are needed\nto examine the public health impact of\nscreening strategies that incorporate a\nnuanced consideration for overweight\nand obesity.\nOur study has limitations. Formal di-\nagnosis was based on self-report. Stan-\ndardized BMI cut points tend to\nunderestimate risks of higher weight in\nAsians (13). In addition, our sample size,\nparticularly among normal-weight adults\nwith evidence of diabetes, was relatively\nmodest; it is possible that we were under-\npowered to detect meaningful differences\nin the likelihood of having undiagnosed\ndiabetes across different BMI groups.\nIn summary, obese adults are no\nmore likely to have their diabetes diag-\nnosed than normal-weight or over-\nweight adults. Because of their higher\ndisease risk, obese adults account for\nmore than one-half of those with undi-\nagnosed diabetes in the U.S. Clinicians\nand policy-makers may want to con-\nsider the underlying risk of diabetes as-\nsociated with body weight in making\ndecisions concerning whom should be\nscreened for diabetes.\n"
