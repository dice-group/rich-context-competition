The available studies showed that despite these\nknown benefits, inadequate numbers of persons with clini-\ncal indications for RAAS blockade use an ACEI or ARB.4,5\nTo shed more light on this issue we performed four\nindependent retrospective surveys to check the use of\nRAAS blocking agents in CKD patients under specialist\ncare during the last 15 years and to find out how these treat-\nments were managed.\nManagement of renin-angiotensin system\nblockade in patients with chronic\nkidney disease under specialist care.\nRetrospective cross-sectional study\nLeszek Tylicki1, Agnieszka Jakubowska2, Slawomir Lizakowski1,\nDariusz wietlik3 and Boleslaw Rutkowski1\n Keywords\nRenin-angiotensin system, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, management, blockade\nDepartment of Nephrology Transplantology and Internal Medicine,\nMedical University of Gdansk, Poland\n2NZOZ Diaverum Dialysis Center Gdynia, Poland\nInterfaculty College of Medical Informatics and Biostatistics, Medical\nUniversity of Gdansk, Poland\nCorresponding author:\nLeszek Tylicki, Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and\nInternal Medicine, Medical University of Gdask, Dbinki 7 St., Gdask\nEmail: leszek.tylicki@gumed.edu.pl\nOriginal Article\n146 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nMethods\nThe study was performed at the Outpatient Unit of the\nDepartment of Nephrology Transplantology and Internal\nMedicine, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland. It was a\nretrospective, cross-sectional study analysing data from\nmedical records in four independent surveys. Data were\nlysed 1952 medical records of all non-dialysed and non-\ntransplanted adults patients treated in the unit. Four\nindependent cross-sectional analyses at four different\ntime-points were performed. The first survey analysed\ndata from 1996. The second, third and fourth surveys ana-\nlysed data of patients who received outpatient care in\nin the year was gathered for the analysis. The authors ana-\nlysed demographic status and clinical information includ-\ning renal, cardiovascular and diabetic status as well as\ncurrent antihypertensive treatment. Data concerning serum\ncreatinine and potassium concentration referred to a single\nassessment, the first in the year. Serum potassium above\n5.1 mmol/l was treated as hyperpotassaemia. In particular,\nthe use of RAAS blocking agents was analysed. Subgroup\nanalysis was performed to check the usage of ACEIs and\nARBs in combination with the presence of proteinuria,\ncardiovascular complications and/or diabetes, CKD stage,\nsex and age. Dosing of ACEIs and ARBs was determined\nas the % of patients receiving drugs in the following ranges\nThe implementation of a combination RAAS blockade\nincluding simultaneous usage of an ACEI and ARB was\nanalysed.

This year, however, what we\nobserved is an increasingly more frequent use of ARBs, a\nmore recent group of RAAS inhibitors, which were intro-\nduced into Polish clinical practice in the late nineties. The\nstratified analysis of the use of RAAS blocking agents\ncontrolled by age did not reveal any differences. Patients\nwith proteinuria, cardiovascular complications and/or dia-\nbetes and men, however, were more commonly treated\nwith an ACEI and/or ARB as compared to others.\nThe matter of the ACEI and ARB administration in\npatients with impaired glomerular filtration has caused\nnumerous controversies.14 To this day, some clinicians\nreluctantly administer the RAAS inhibiting agents in\npatients with chronic renal failure due to a risk of sudden\nrenal function deterioration or hyperkalaemia. The post-\nhoc, secondary analysis of the REIN trial shed new light\non this intriguing issue. The study clearly established that\nthe renoprotective effect of ACEI is independent of renal\nfunction and provided a strong background for the recom-\nmendation to administer the RAAS-inhibiting agents to all\npatients with proteinuric chronic nephropathies, regardless\nof renal function.15 This seems to be reflected in the results\nof our study. The use of ACEIs and ARBs in the most\nadvanced CKD stages increased in subsequent surveys.\nUntil now, the optimal nephroprotective dosing of\nACEI and ARB has not been established and, therefore,\nthe dosages used in the treatment of arterial hypertension\nare commonly administered. The results of our previous\nstudies clearly showed that even very low ACEI or ARB\ndoses, which have been found not to produce significant\neffect on arterial pressure, decrease proteinuria.16 The evi-\ndence exists, however, that blockade of the RAAS is a\nclosely dose-related phenomenon and the enhancement of\nthe RAAS inhibition by increasing the dosage of ACEI or\nARB allows for a greater decrement of proteinuria and\nattenuation of tubular injury.17 Therefore, considering the\nprognostic impact of proteinuria reduction on renal out-\ncome, it has been commonly recommended to uptitrate the\nACEI or ARB for maximal antiproteinuric effect regard-\nless of BP. The tendency to increase dosing of ACEIs was\nobserved in subsequent years of our observation. In 2011\nmost patients received these agents in the highest range of\ntheir doses. ARBs were used most commonly in the range\n25\u00ad50% of their maximal doses. The reason for limiting\nthe dosing of ARBs in our population as compared to the\ndosing of ACEIs may derive from economic factors in\nPolish conditions in these years.\nThe combination therapy of ACEI and ARB has been\nstudied extensively for some years with respect to renal\nprotection. Several clinical studies have investigated dual\nRAAS blockade in nondiabetic, diabetic or mixed renal\npatients and documented a greater antiproteinuric effect\nof such a combination in comparison with monother-\napy.9,18 Given these results, the dual RAAS blockade was\nconsidered for a time even as a gold standard of treatment\nfor chronic proteinuric kidney disease.19 In the world lit-\nerature there is little data on the frequency of use of such\na therapy. In Italy the use of dual RAAS blockade was in\nIn 1996 there were no patients treated with ACEI plus\nARB in our population whereas 1% and 8% of patients\nDecrease of enthusiasm for the combination therapy and\nthe inhibition of growth trend in use of it in 2011 was\nprobably associated with the results of the ONTARGET\nstudy, which not only showed no long-term benefits\nresulting from such therapy, but drew attention to a num-\nber of its dangers including the risk of life-threatening\nhyperkalaemia and acute renal failure.21 To shed some\nlight on this issue we analysed potassium serum levels in\npatients treated with RAAS blocking agents as monother-\napy, those who received dual RAAS blockade of an ACEI\nplus ARB and subjects without such treatment. Patients\non the combination therapy ACEI plus ARB had a numer-\nically higher concentration of serum potassium and the\nfrequency of hyperkalaemia regarded as serum potas-\nsium level above 5.1 mmol/l, nevertheless, the differ-\nences did not reach significance level. The results may\nsuggest that careful management of CKD patients treated\nwith RAAS inhibitors, even with dual RAAS blockade,\nmay prevent a dangerous rise of the potassium level.\nSubgroup analysis confirmed that special attention\nshould be paid to patients with advanced CKD which are\nat highest risk of hyperkalaemia during such treatment.\nOf note, a potential limitation of this analysis is the fact\nthat data concerning serum potassium concentration\nreferred only to a single assessment.\nThe hypotensive and antiproteinuric effect of RAAS\ninhibitors is impaired with a high salt intake, thus,\npatients treated with an ACEI or ARB are commonly\ninstructed to follow a low salt diet and their treatment\nshould be accompanied by diuretics.22 Awareness of this\nfact seems to increase slightly in nephrologists as the use\nof diuretics among patients receiving ACEI and/ or ARB\nwas increasing in subsequent years of our observation.\nOne should take into account the fact, however, that\nalmost every other patients was unfortunately not treated\nIn summary the use of RAAS blocking agents was\nincreasing in CKD patients under the care of nephrologists\nment was gradually improved.\n152 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
