Introduction\nNon-maternal child care for infants and young children has increased rapidly over\nthe last few decades. Today, for the majority of young children in the United States,\nchild care has become an important part of their life before they enter kindergarten\nor first grade. In 2002, 63% of children under age five were placed in some type of\nnon-maternal child care setting (US Census Bureau 2005). The increased use of\nnon-maternal care is most pronounced for children in their first year of life: most\ninfants were placed in some sort of non-maternal care by four months of age\n(National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Early\nChild Care Research Network (ECCRN) 1997). Major changes have also taken place\nin the relative popularity of different types of child care. The use of relatives for child\ncare declined as parents began to rely more on family day care homes and day care\ncenters (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine 2003).\nThese significant changes in the use of child care have generated substantial\nresearch interest in the effects of various types of child care, particularly in the\nfirst year, on child development. Psychologists have suggested that the first year\nof a child's life is crucial to child development, because of early influences on\nbrain development, learning skills, self-esteem and emotional security (Lewis and\nchildren's early achievement is correlated with a variety of later life economic\noutcomes, such as educational attainment and earnings (Currie and Thomas 2001;\n*Corresponding author. Email: probins@miami.edu\nhttp://www.informaworld.com\nJournal of Children and Poverty\nBernal and Keane 2006; Fronstin, Greenberg, and Robins 2006). Because of the link\nbetween early child development and later life economic outcomes, the determinants\nof early development have been receiving increasing attention in the economics\nliterature.\nUnderstanding the effects of infant child care on child development is\nparticularly important in light of recent welfare reform and child care policies.\nUnder the current policy regime, large numbers of low-income single mothers who\nformerly relied on government assistance are being pushed into the workforce. The\nlabor force participation rate of single mothers increased from 43.5% in 1990 to\nunder one year of age, are being placed in non-maternal child care. In addition, child\ncare subsidies have increased substantially since welfare reform, in an effort to\nfacilitate greater labor force participation. Growth in child care subsidies has spurred\nan even greater demand for non-maternal child care, especially center-based care\n(Loeb et al. 2003). It is crucial to provide insights into the effects that these welfare\nand child care policy changes have on the development of low-income children. If\nmothers join the workforce and their children end up in a type of care that has\ndetrimental effects on their development, then pushing mothers to work may harm\nthe development of low-income children.\nAlthough it is well documented that center-based early intervention programs,\nsuch as Head Start, have positive effects on children's cognitive development (see\nCurrie 2001 for a review), research that compares the effects of different types\nof child care has received less empirical attention, and has proven controversial.\nA major challenge in estimating the effects of child care on child development is\naccounting for non-random selection of children into different types of child care.\nA mother's choice of child care may depend on some unobserved maternal and/or\nchild characteristics, which may also correlate with child outcomes. Most previous\nstudies fail to control for potential biases caused by the unobserved heterogeneity of\nboth mothers and children.\nThis paper examines the relationship between various types of child care during\nthe first year of a child's life and child language and social development at age three,\nusing data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a birth\ncohort of children born to predominantly low-income single mothers. Five types of\nchild care are considered: relative in a child's home, relative in another home, non-\nrelative/family day care home, day care center, and maternal care. The paper focuses\non two sets of questions: (1) `What are the differential effects of each type of infant\nchild care on child development?' and (2) `How do these effects vary by child's\ngender and race?' The main contributions of this paper are as follows.\nFirst, many existing studies on the effects of different types of child care include\nonly a small number of children from low-income families, making it difficult to\nestablish robust findings for these families. In addition, most previous studies use\ndata that predate the welfare reform policies of the 1990s. Evidence from these earlier\nstudies may not be applicable under the new policy regime. The FFCWS used in this\npaper is a large representative sample of children born to predominantly low-income\nbe affected by current welfare reform and child care policies. Findings from this\npaper may fill gaps in our knowledge regarding the effects of early child care types on\n2 D. Peng and P.K. Robins\nthe development of low-income children as their mothers move from welfare to the\nworkforce.\nSecond, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply a\ngeneral selection model (originally developed by Lee 1983) to address the potential\nendogeneity of mother's choice of child care type on child development. Child care\nchoice is estimated using a multinomial logit model, with the inclusion of a mother's\neligibility for child care subsidy as an identifying instrument. This approach enables\nus to detect the existence of selection bias and estimate the potential selection\neffects for each type of child care. Moreover, this empirical strategy provides a useful\nway of evaluating the child development impact of a child care subsidy through its\neffect on child care choice.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of\nthe literature. Section 3 presents the conceptual framework and econometric model\nused in the paper. Section 4 describes the data and provides summary statistics.\nSection 5 presents the empirical results. Section 6 discusses the findings and offers\nour conclusions.\n2. Previous literature\nThe effects of child care on child development have been widely studied in the\npsychology, sociology, and economics literature. Most of these studies focus on\nthe effects of three aspects of early child care \u00c1 quality, quantity, and type of care\nreview). Studies of child care type have primarily focused on the effects of center care\nor center-based early intervention programs, such as Head Start (see Currie 2001 for\na review). Although some studies have compared the effects of different types of care\non child development, research on the effects of infant child care has received less\nempirical attention, and proven controversial, with researchers drawing different\nconclusions about the patterns of the effects.\nStudies of the effects of infant child care on child development\nThe majority of early studies in the developmental psychology literature that analyze\nthe effects of infant child care suffer from small sample sizes, few or no measures of\nhome environment, and no control for non-random selection of children into various\nchild care settings (Bayder and Brooks-Gunn 1991; Caughy, DiPietro, and Strobino\nThe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early\nChild Care (NICHD-SECC), which is one of the better studies in this literature,\nexamines the effects of early child care on children's development for over 1300\nchildren at 10 sites in the United States from birth in 1991 through age six. The study\ncontains rich data on child, family, and child care characteristics, which may reduce\nthe extent of the biases associated with omitted variables (NICHD ECCRN 1998,\nfrom white, non-Hispanic families with high income and maternal education level,\nand thus the results may not be applicable to children in lower-income and/or\nminority families. Moreover, the studies do not examine whether the relationships\nJournal of Children and Poverty 3\nbetween different types of child care and cognitive outcomes vary by family income,\nhome environment, child gender, or race.\nDevelopmental psychology theory suggests the potential detrimental impacts of a\nmother's absence in the first year of a child's life for child cognitive and socio-\nemotional development (Belsky 1988). However, the effects of non-maternal care\nduring infancy on child development are likely to vary by family's socio-economic\nstatus. For low-income children, the environment provided by non-maternal care\nmay be more optimal than that which is provided by the home environment. If so,\nnon-maternal care during early childhood may serve as a protective factor to\npromote the development of low-income children (Desai, Chase-Lansdale, and\nMichael 1989; Caughy, DiPietro, and Strobino 1994). This explanation is consistent\nwith the `compensatory education' notion that children from low-income families\nwill obtain more benefits from high-quality non-maternal care than will children\nfrom more advantaged families. Evidence from previous research on the protective\neffects of non-maternal care for low-income children is inconclusive (Lamb 1997;\nThe effects of different types of child care on child development may vary by\nchild gender or race/ethnicity. First, there is a good deal of evidence that boys in\nnon-maternal care are at higher risk than girls in cognitive and behavioral\n2003). Second, there may be racial or ethnic differences in mother\u00c1child interactions\nand/or in substitute care types, so the effects of child care on child development may\ndiffer by racial or ethnic groups (Burchinal et al. 2000).\nMany of the previous studies do not rigorously account for non-random\nselection of children into different types of child care. A few recent studies consider\nthe possibility that mothers select child care types on the basis of unobserved\ncharacteristics of mothers and children. Gamoran, Mare, and Bethke (1999) use data\nfrom the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to analyze the effects\ndifferent types of care had on a child's verbal skills at age three and on math skills\nmeasured between the ages of three and six. They address the selection bias by\nestimating a mother fixed-effects model (within-family estimator), by exploiting the\nfact that a large number of mothers in the NLSY have more than one child. The\nmother fixed-effects method rules out both observed and unobserved variables that\ndo not change within a family, and therefore controls for possible bias caused by\nunobserved heterogeneity of mothers. Blau (1999) adopts the same estimation\napproach to examine the effects of various characteristics of child care including type\nof care on a series of cognitive test scores and a behavioral problems index. This\nmodel controls for a large number of background variables, including measures of\nthe quality of home environment.\nAlthough mother fixed-effects estimates are free of bias caused by fixed\nfamily-level unobserved heterogeneity, the potential bias caused by child-specific\nunobserved heterogeneity or time-varying family-specific unobserved heterogeneity\ncannot be controlled by this approach. The NICHD ECCRN and Duncan (2003)\nuses the fact that cognitive test scores are measured in different years for a child to\nestimate a child fixed-effects model (within-child estimator), which accounts for fixed\nchild-specific unobserved heterogeneity. One limitation of the child fixed-effects\nestimation is that time-variant unobserved heterogeneity cannot be controlled,\n4 D. Peng and P.K. Robins\nthough it is likely that the impact of the omitted variables vary over time. Moreover,\nthe study only analyzed the effects of center-based care.\nBernal and Keane (2006) is the only prior study that employs an instrumental\nvariables (IV) approach to examine effects of child care use on children's cognitive\ndevelopment. They construct a comprehensive set of welfare policy variables at\nindividual and state levels and use them as instruments to estimate cognitive ability\nfunction for children of single mothers from the NLSY.\nAnother common characteristic of the previous studies is that most of them use\ndata from the pre-welfare reform period. We know little about the type of child care\nselected under the new policy regime by mothers moving from welfare to work, and\nthe effects of these types on their young children's development. One recent study by\nLoeb et al. (2003) investigates the developmental effects of child care type and\nquality in poor communities in three major US cities, by following a group of\nprograms. However, due to a non-representative sample, generalizing their results to\nthe national population of low-income families is difficult.\nA certain type of child care can affect a child's development through the quantity\nof time the child spends in that type, and the quality of that type. A substantial body\nof research has found that higher-quality care is significantly associated with better\nchild development, and the quality of care is related to the structural features of the\nchild care settings including child\u00c1adult ratio, group size, caregivers' specialized\ntraining and formal education level (Blau 2001; Love, Schochet, and Meckstroth\ntypes of child care are not available in the FFCWS. Thus, the reader should keep in\nmind that the differential effects by child care type estimated in this study may reflect\nvarying quality of those settings in addition to other factors.\nChild care choice\nThere is a large body of literature examining the effects of child care prices on either\nthe employment or child care choice decisions of mothers with young children. Some\nstudies model the choice of child care conditional on the mother working based on\nthe assumption that her employment decision is exogenous to the child care choice\nendogeneity of mother's employment in the demand for child care by including\npredicted employment status in their demand models. A few studies jointly examine\nmother's labor supply decision and child care choice decision (Blau and Hagy 1998;\nthe demand for child care use a multinomial logit model with categories defined by\ntype of care or by cross-classifying employment status with child care modes. The\nprice of child care is typically the predicted value from an estimated parent-reported\nhourly child care expenditure equation, corrected for selectivity on paying for care.1\nResearchers have used child care regulations, average wages of child care workers,\nand other factors that vary across geographic locations as identifying variables. One\nproblem with this approach is that, if a family chooses the quality of care, it becomes\nimpossible to find justifiable exclusion restrictions to identify the selection effects\n(Blau and Currie 2004). To avoid the difficult problem of estimating the price of child\nJournal of Children and Poverty 5\ncare in a structural model, this paper follows Blau and Tekin (2003) and Tekin (2004)\nby estimating a reduced-form model in which the determinants of child care prices,\nincluding household characteristics and child care subsidies, are substituted into the\ndemand model.\nPrior research has found evidence on the impacts of child care subsidies on a\nwelfare reform while others use data during the early post-welfare reform period.\nThe empirical evidence from these studies suggests that it might be fruitful to use a\nmother's eligibility for a child care subsidy or a hypothetical subsidy amount a\nmother would receive, if eligible, as an instrument to identify the effects of child care\ntypes on child development.\nAlthough there is a large body of research on the overall effects of child care in\nthe pre-school years on child outcomes, the important question of what types of\nearly child care can be most helpful for children from different socioeconomic\nbackgrounds has received limited attention. In the remainder of this paper, we\nestimate a model of the effects of various types of infant child care on child\ndevelopment outcomes using data on children born after the most recent welfare\nreform. A large proportion of children in our study sample are from social-\neconomically disadvantaged families, a group that has been less studied in prior\nresearch and are likely to be affected more than higher-income families by current\nwelfare reform and child care policies. To account for non-random selection of\nfamilies into different types of child care, we use a general selection-correction\nmodel, which has not been applied in previous studies.\n3. Conceptual framework and econometric model\nIn economic models, the households are assumed to maximize a utility function that\nincludes child outcomes as one argument, subject to a budget constraint and a\nestimate an early child development production function, which is a cumulative\nprocess depending on the history of inputs applied by families and other care types,\nas well as on children's inherited endowments (Todd and Wolpin 2003). Consider a\nproduction function of development outcomes for child i at age t (Yit\n) as\nYit\n[Hi\n(t); Ci\n(t); m\ni\n; o\ni\nwhere H is a vector of family inputs, C is a vector of child care inputs, Hi\n(t) and Ci\n(t)\nare the vectors of their respective input histories up to child i's age t, mi\nis child i's\nendowment, and oi\n(t) is a vector of disturbance terms capturing production shocks\nnot otherwise controlled for. Child outcomes depend on both the quantity and\nquality of family and child care inputs (Blau 1999; James-Burdumy 2005). Because\nwe lack quality measures of the various types of non-maternal child care, the effects\nwe estimate may be partially reflecting varying quality of care in addition to other\nfactors.\nOur empirical specification relates the effects of child care type during the first\nyear of a child's life to child development outcomes at age three, controlling for the\nchanges in child care type between the first and third year and other determinants of\nchild development. Controlling for changes in child care type is important because\n6 D. Peng and P.K. Robins\nprevious studies find that instability in early child care is negatively associated with\nchild social development (NICHD ECCRN 1998).\nThe empirical model is as follows:\nYi\n'uIi\n'bXi\n'ei\nwhere Yi\nis a measure of child i's development outcome at age three, Ci\nis a vector\nof type of child care at age one, Ii\nis a binary variable indicating whether child\ni experienced any change in child care type between age one and age three, and Xi\nis a vector of family and child characteristics that are thought to affect child\ndevelopment.\nA causal interpretation can only be applied to the parameter estimates on child\ncare type if X controls for all other determinants of child outcomes. However, even\nan extensive set of explanatory variables in X may not fully account for all of the\nimportant sources of heterogeneity in family or child characteristics. If mothers\nchoose a child care type based on some unobserved maternal or child characteristics,\nwhich are also correlated to the outcomes, then estimates that do not account for\nunobserved heterogeneity would be biased. For example, mothers' unobserved\nchild-rearing attitudes may not only play a role in their child care choice, but may\nalso directly affect child development. In this case, the error term would be correlated\nwith child care type, i.e., cov(ei\n,Ci\n)\"0, which will produce biased results.\nThe estimation procedure accounts for non-random selection into different child\ncare types in two steps. First, an ordinary least squares (OLS) model is used with the\ninclusion of a rich set of explanatory variables that reflect differences among families\nusing different child care types. Second, a multinomial logit-OLS two-stage\nestimation model, originally developed by Lee (1983), is applied to control for the\npossible selection bias of child care choice. Lee's model extends the classical\nHeckman's probit-OLS two-step estimator (also known as Heckit) to a multinomial\nlogit-OLS (mlogit-OLS) two-step estimator to allow selection correction for\npolychotomous choices, i.e., individuals have more than two alternatives. For its\nability to correct selection in polychotomous choices and computational ease, Lee's\nmlogit-OLS two-step estimation framework has been widely used in empirical\nstudies on sample and self-selection in polychotomous choice models (Gyourko and\nknowledge, this paper is the first application of such a generalized selection model to\nanalyze the effects of child care type on child development.\nThe multinomial logit-OLS model is estimated in two stages. In the first stage,\nchild care choice is estimated by a multinomial logit model. Then the correction\nterms of variables correlated with child care choice are calculated and included in the\nsecond-stage child outcome equations, which are estimated by OLS for each type of\nchild care. The results are then used to calculate the difference in child development\noutcomes between one type of non-maternal care and maternal care. Full details of\nthe estimation procedure are presented in Appendix 1.\nFFCWS data\nTo estimate the model, we use data from the FFCWS and its associated In-Home\nmodule. The FFCWS follows a cohort of 4898 children born in 20 US cities with\nJournal of Children and Poverty 7\nof non-marital births.2 The sample is both racially and ethnically diverse (51% of the\nsample is African-American and 22% is Hispanic), and includes large numbers of\nchildren from low-income families (33% had incomes below 100% of the poverty line\nat birth, with another 26% with incomes between 100 and 200% of the poverty line).\nThe core study consists of interviews with both mothers and fathers at the time\nof child's birth and again when the focal child is one (N04271) and three years\nold (N04140). The parent interviews collected information on child care along\nwith other detailed information on family characteristics, parent relationships,\nparenting behavior, economic and employment status. At age three, the child's\nprimary caregiver participated in an additional In-Home Assessment (the 36-Month\nIn-Home Longitudinal Study of Pre-School Aged Children), which is composed of\ntwo parts: a parent survey questionnaire and an activity booklet. The parent survey\nquestionnaire covers a broad range of topics on child's health, child's behavior\nproblems, parenting, and home environment. The activity booklet is used to\nrecord the mother and child's Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) scores and\nobservations about the child's home environment, child's behavior, and parent\u00c1child\ninteraction. More than 79% of the respondents of the 36-month Core survey\nparticipated in the 36-Month In-Home module (N03288). The main sample used\nfor this paper consists of children whose families completed the In-Home\nAssessment and for whom we have key information of child care types that can\nbe identified at age one. Sample sizes range from 2312 to 2986 depending upon the\nextent to which there were missing values for each child outcome.3\nVariables analyzed\nChild development outcomes\nThe outcomes we analyze are measures of language and social development at age\nthree. They include the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) score, and two\nbehavior problem indices. All development outcomes are measured at the 36-Month\nIn-Home Study. The PPVT is a widely-used measure of receptive vocabulary that\nmeasures the size and range of words that the respondent understands (Berger,\nearly childhood correlate with literacy outcomes in young adulthood (Bayder,\nBrooks-Gunn, and Furstenberg 1993). We focus on the age-standardized PPVT\nscores, which have been commonly used by previous researchers (Bayder and\nsample has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. In our sample, the mean is\n86.7, which is lower than 100, since the FFCWS sample tends to over-represent\nchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds. The age-standardized TVIP (Test de\nVocabulario en Imagenes Peabody) scores are used for Spanish-speaking children.\nThe two behavior problems variables measure internalizing and externalizing\nchild behavior problems. The internalizing (anxious/depressed and withdrawn) and\nexternalizing (aggressive and destructive) child behavior problems are based on items\nfrom the Achenbach 1992 Child Behavior Checklists for two- to three-year-olds\n(CBCL/2\u00c13). Achenbach's CBCL are widely used scales for assessing problematic\n8 D. Peng and P.K. Robins\nhave been shown to be predictive of outcomes in later childhood (Achenbach,\nEdelbrock, and Howell 1987; Shaw et al. 1998). Items were read to each mother, who\nwas asked to indicate whether the statement was not true (0), sometimes or\nsomewhat true (1), or very true or often true of her child (2). Scores for each measure\nof child behavior problems are calculated by averaging item scores. In this study, the\ninternalizing scale consists of the mean responses of 24 items, with a mean of 0.40\nand standard deviation of 0.24. The externalizing scale consists of the mean\nCronbach's alpha is 0.81 for the internalizing scale and 0.88 for the externalizing\nscale. For ease of interpretation, all child outcomes have been normalized to\nhave mean 0 and standard deviation 1, so that the regression coefficients can be\ninterpreted as the standard deviation change in the outcome predicted by a one unit\nchange in the explanatory variable.\nTypes of child care\nThe key explanatory variable in this paper is the type of child care. When the child\nwas age one, the parent was interviewed about the current child care types being\nused. Non-maternal care is defined as the care of a child by someone other than the\nchild's mother for at least 10 hours a week on a regular basis. Most previous child\ncare studies only analyze working women. However, non-maternal child care is also\nused by many non-working mothers.4 In this paper, 18% of non-working mothers\nand 62% of working mothers used some type of non-maternal care for their children\nat age one. Therefore, children with both working and non-working mothers are\nincluded in the analysis sample. The choice of child care type is classified as: (1)\nrelative5 in child's home, (2) relative in another home, (3) non-relative6/family day\ncare home, (4) day care center (including Head Start/Early Head Start), and (5)\nmaternal care. Relative care and non-relative care in the child's home or in another\nhome are considered as home-based care or informal child care types, while day care\ncenter is considered a formal child care type. For children in multiple child care\nsettings, the type of care in which the child spends the most time is considered\nprimary. Children not receiving regular non-maternal care were grouped into the\ncategory of maternal care. At age one, 42% of the children were regularly receiving\nnon-maternal child care. Relative care in another home and day care center were\nused most often, with 14% each. Relative care in the child's home accounted for 8%.\nOnly 6% of the children were cared for by non-relatives/family day care at home. A\ndichotomous scale indicating whether the child has ever experienced any changes in\nchild care type is used to measure instability in child care between age one and three.\nControl variables\nTo capture the influences of family inputs and child endowments on child\ndevelopment, as suggested by the economic model, we exploit the extensive child,\nmaternal and household information available in the FFCWS. First, a vector of\nparent and child background variables is included, which has been widely used in the\nprevious literature. Child background characteristics include the child's age (in\nmonths, at the time of the In-Home assessment), gender, birth order, and whether the\nchild's birth weight was low (less than 2500 g). Parental background characteristics\nJournal of Children and Poverty 9\ninclude the ages of the mother and father at the child's birth, mother's race/ethnicity\n(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other), whether the\nfather's race is different from the mother's, and the mother's immigrant status.\nSecond, to control further for the family's socioeconomic status, each parent's\neducational attainment (less than high school, high school diploma, some college or\ntechnical training, and college or more), mother's score on the PPVT,7 and the\nlogarithm of average household income between the child's first and third years of\nlife are included. Each parent's work status and weekly hours worked when the child\nwas one and three are also included to account for parental time investment on the\nchild. A parent's work status and hours of work can also affect a mother's choice of\nchild care type. Mother's employment would be potentially endogenous in both\nstages of estimation, if the mother decided the choice of child care and labor force\nparticipation simultaneously. It is difficult to find proper instruments to control for\nthe potential endogeneity of mother's employment. Therefore, this paper assumes\nthat the mother's employment decision is exogenous to the child care choice\ndecision.8 Moreover, the number of adults and the number of children by age in the\nhousehold and the mother's marital status (married at birth and age three, not\nmarried at birth or age three, only married at birth, only married at age three) are\nincluded.\nThird, we control for parental health and health behavior that may affect a\nparent's ability to care for the child. The mother's overall health status is defined on\nthe basis of her self-assessment of health at the child's birth. A dichotomous scale is\ncreated for poor/fair health versus good/very good/excellent health. The three\nmaternal health behavior variables include dichotomous measures of the mother's\nreport of smoking, drinking, and drug use at child's birth. We control for the father's\nhealth using three dichotomous measures: having any physical or mental health\ncondition that limits his ability to work, smoking, and having problems keeping a job\nor holding relationships because of alcohol or drug use at child's birth.\nFourth, to control for the quality of the home environment, we include several\nmeasures of parenting behavior and a measure of household food security (from\nthe USDA scale9). All of these measures are from the 36-Month In-Home Study. We\nuse five measures of parenting behavior and mother\u00c1child interaction. Four of\nthese are derived from the infant-toddler version of the Home Observation for\nMeasurement of the Environment (HOME) inventory (Bradley 1993), and include\nemotionally responsive, not punitive, verbal/social skill, and language stimulation.\nThe scale of each measure is generated using the mean responses of the items\nincluded, such as parent responded verbally to child's vocalizations, parent did not\nshout at child, parent's speech was distinct and audible, and parent provided books\nfor child. The Cronbach's alpha is 0.74 for emotionally responsive, 0.76 for not\npunitive, 0.69 for verbal/social skill, and 0.53 for language stimulation.\nThe fifth measure of parenting behavior is based on the `Neglect' subscale from\nthe Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS) (Straus et al. 1998). Since most mothers did\nnot report any neglectful behaviors at all, this measure is coded as a binary\nvariable indicating whether any of the neglectful behaviors occurred in the past year.\nThe measure of food security reflects home income and the priority of food\nexpenditure at home. Since few mothers admitted food insecurity, this measure is\ncoded as a binary indicator of whether food insecurity exists in the household.\n10 D. Peng and P.K. Robins\nFinally, we control for several additional background characteristics, including\nwhether the mother had been on welfare prior to the child's birth, whether she lived\nwith both parents at age 15, and whether the mother's father was involved in her\nlife while she was growing up. Other factors included the education level of the\nmother's parents and city dummies that control for city-specific differences.

The explanatory variables with missing values are set\nInstruments\nTo identify a mother's choice of child care type, her eligibility for a child care subsidy\nunder the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is included as an instrument\nin the choice equation.11 A mother's potential eligibility for a child care subsidy is\nconstructed based on two criteria under state rules: family income and parental work\nstatus (US Administration for Children and Families 2001). First, a family must have\nmonthly income below the income eligibility threshold for a family of the same\nsize established by the state of residence. We compared the household's monthly\nincome to the appropriate income threshold for the same household size to\ndetermine income eligibility. Most states set income eligibility limits substantially\nbelow the level by law, 85% of the state median income (SMI). Three states set the\nincome eligibility limit at less than 50% of SMI. When measuring the household's\nmonthly income, we take account of the variation in definitions of income used by\nthe states. For example, some states do not count income from Temporary\nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or\nfood stamps in their determination of CCDF eligibility. Second, both the mother and\nthe father (if there is a spouse present) must be either working or attending a job\ntraining or educational program. Three states require the parent to work at least a\nminimum number of hours per week (e.g., 20 hours) to be eligible for CCDF\nsubsidies. Other states do not require minimum hours of work. If these two criteria\nare satisfied, then the mother is eligible for a child care subsidy in this paper. About\n34% of the mothers in the sample are estimated to be eligible for a CCDF subsidy at\nchild's age one. Among them, 27% actually received child care subsidies. The US\nAdministration for Children and Families (2000) predicts that about 12\u00c115% of all\neligible families received a CCDF subsidy in 1998\u00c12000. However, the national figure\nincludes all children under age 13, while this study includes only children at age one.\nSince younger children are more likely to receive child care subsidies, and children\nfrom low-income families are served at a higher percentage, the eligibility estimates\nin this study are reasonable.\nDescriptive statistics\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for all variables by child care type at age one.\nUsing the sample of children exclusively in maternal care as the reference group,\nTable 1 also reports the results from t-tests on the equality of sample means across\nchild-care types.12 Children in non-maternal care, except for relative care in the\nchild's home, are reported to exhibit less internalizing behavior problems than\nJournal of Children and Poverty 11\nTable 1.

The internalizing scale is the lowest for children in day\ncare centers. The same pattern is found with respect to children's PPVT scores,\nalthough the differences in the means are not statistically significant. Children in\nrelative care in another home or day care centers at age one are reported to have\nless externalizing problems at age three. The differences, however, are also not\nstatistically significant.\nThe child care turnover rate is highest for children in non-relative/family day\ncare (FDCH) home at age one, with 78% of mothers reporting having switched to\nanother type of care by age three. Center care seems to be the most stable type of\ncare during the first three years. Among those mothers who used center care at\nchild's age one, only one-third changed to another type of care at child's age three.\nCompared to mothers who chose maternal care in the first year, mothers who\nchose any non-maternal care types, on average, are more likely to be better\neducated, employed, and have higher household income. At the same time, they are\nless likely to be continuously married, to be in poor health, to be on welfare prior\nto child's birth, and to have more children under age five. In addition, young\nparents are more likely to choose relative care in the first year. Black mothers are\nmore likely to choose day care centers or relative care in another home, while\nHispanic mothers or mothers born outside the United States are less likely to\nchoose these two types. Mothers who chose center care at age one are more likely\nto be good at parenting skills than mothers who chose any other child care types.\nFinally, mothers who used any type of non-maternal care are more likely to be\neligible for a child care subsidy. For example, 64% of mothers who chose day care\ncenters are eligible for a child care subsidy, compared with 24% of mothers who\nused maternal care.\n5. Results\nThe estimation results from the OLS model are discussed first, followed by the\nresults from the multinomial logit-OLS two-stage model accounting for the potential\nselection bias. Finally, the differences in child development outcomes between one\ntype of non-maternal care and maternal care are calculated based on the selection\nmodel estimates, and are compared to the OLS results.\nOLS estimates\nThe simplest way to analyze the effects of child care types on child development\noutcomes is to estimate Equation (2) by OLS, in which dummy variables are included\nindicating the various types of child care used. Three child outcome measures are\nregressed separately on a rich set of child and family characteristics and city\ndummies. Results from OLS regressions are shown in Table 2.13 Children show less\ninternalizing behavior problems in center care, and more externalizing behavior\nproblems in non-relative/FDCH. Compared to the reference category of maternal\ncare, center care is associated with a 0.095 standard deviation decline in the\ninternalizing scale, while non-relative/FDCH is associated with a 0.192 standard\ndeviation rise in the externalizing scale. Non-relative/FDCH is associated with a\nlower PPVT score, but the effect is not statistically significant.\n16 D. Peng and P.K. Robins\nSelection model estimates\nAs discussed above, the OLS estimates are potentially subject to bias due to the\nomission of unobserved variables correlated with child care choice. Therefore, a\nmultinomial logit-OLS two-stage estimation model is adopted to address the\npotential selection bias. The framework involves the estimation of a reduced-form\nmultinomial logit child care choice model, calculation of correction terms of\nvariables correlated with child care choice from this model, and the inclusion of these\ncorrection terms in the child development outcome equations estimated separately\nfor each type of child care.\nReduced-form multinomial logit child care choice model\nIn estimating the multinomial choice model [Equation (A.6) in Appendix 1],\nvariables are included in the z vector that are believed to be important in a mother's\nchild care decision. These variables include child and parent background character-\nistics, parent's education, household income, number of household members, work\nstatus and hours of work of each parent, marital status of the mother, parents'\nhealth, additional background characteristics, city dummies that account for\ncity-specific differences in the stock of child care options available, and average\nprice of care. Mother's eligibility for a child care subsidy is also included to help\nidentify the choice equation. It must be noted that a structural choice model would\nnormally include the price of each type of child care. However, because price effects\nare not the focus of this paper, the model estimated can be thought of as a reduced\nform model in which the determinants of child care prices are substituted into the\nTable 2.

Peng and P.K. Robins\nThe implied marginal effect of each variable on the probability of selecting each\nchild care type is given in Table 3.14 Most of the results from this first-stage equation\nare consistent with the findings of previous studies (see Blau and Currie 2004, for a\nreview). Black children have a 5% higher probability than white children of being in\ncenter care, primarily because black American mothers are much more likely to work\nfull time (Michalopoulos and Robins 2000). Foreign-born mothers are less likely to\nuse day care centers. Mother's education appears to be an important factor\nexplaining the choice of child care. Increased levels of mother's education raise the\nprobability of a child being in non-relative/FDCH and reduce the probability of\nbeing in maternal care. Graduating from college, for example, reduces a mother's\nchance of selecting maternal care by 16%. As expected, a mother's work status has a\nsignificant effect on her use of non-maternal care. Being employed reduces mother's\nchance of choosing maternal care by 38%. A mother's hours of work are also\nsignificantly related to her choice of child care mode. However, the effects tend to be\nsmall. The presence of another adult in the household has a significant positive\nimpact on the probability of using relative care in home, and the presence of young\nchildren significantly increases the probability of using maternal care. Being single\nreduces a mother's chance of choosing maternal care by 17% and increases her\nchance of selecting relative care in her home by 7%. Children from families who had\nbeen on welfare (TANF) prior to the child's birth have a 6% higher probability of\nbeing in maternal care.\nMother's eligibility for a child care subsidy (the identifying instrument in the first\nstage) is a significant determinant of child care choice. Eligibility for a subsidy raises\nthe probability that the child is in center care, a family day care home, and in-home\nrelative care by 19, 3, and 3%, respectively, while it reduces the probability that the\nchild is in maternal care by 24%. This result is consistent with the findings in prior\nresearch that child care subsidies increase the use of non-maternal care, especially\nday care centers (Tekin 2004). In order to provide further evidence on the validity of\nthe instrument, subsidy eligibility is included in the second-stage outcome equations,\nand none of the coefficients are found to be significant.\nAn assumption of the multinomial logit model is that the choice categories for\nthe model have the property of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). The IIA\nproperty assumes that the inclusion or exclusion of the choice does not affect the\nrelative probabilities of choosing any two remaining options. In other words, the\nIIA assumption implies the error terms, hij\ns, are independent across alternatives. To\nexamine the validity of the IIA assumption, the Hausman test (Hausman and\nMcFadden 1984) is performed. The Hausman test indicates that the IIA assumption\ncannot be rejected for each of the four choice equations. Hence, on the basis of this\ntest, use of the multinomial logit model in the first stage is justified.\nChild development outcome equations\nEstimates of the three second-stage child development outcome equations in the\nsecond stage are presented in Tables 4\u00c16. Because these outcome equations are\nestimated separately for each type of child care, they have the advantage of not\nconstraining the coefficients of the control variables to be the same across child care\ntypes. The Wald test is employed to test the equality of the coefficients between any\ntype of non-maternal care and maternal care in each of the three child development\nJournal of Children and Poverty 21\nTable 4.

The test statistics are reported in the last rows of each table. The\ntest indicates that equality constraints are not binding in all three outcome\nequations.\nOne objective of this paper is to explore variations in the effects of child care type\nby child gender and race. Significant racial variation is only observed in the models\nof children's PPVT scores. The results indicate that black or Hispanic children suffer\na significant cognitive disadvantage in maternal and in-home relative care. For\nexample, compared with white children, black and Hispanic children are 0.879 and\n0.999 standard deviations lower in PPVT performance if cared for by relatives at\nhome. With respect to differential effects by child gender, the results indicate that\nboys generally suffer a developmental disadvantage in all care types in the first year.\nHowever, for children's language development, significant variations by gender are\nonly found in maternal care, and for children's externalizing behavioral development,\nsignificant gender variations are shown in center care and in-home relative care.\nThere is no evidence that the cognitive effects of different types of non-maternal care\nare significantly greater for boys than for girls.\nConsistent with prior research, family and child characteristics and measures of\nhome environment are found to play an important role in child development. In\nthe models of children's PPVT scores, mother's PPVT score has a significant and\npositive effect in four out of the five types. Even after controlling for the mother's\ncognitive ability, having a college degree still exerts a large positive effect on a child's\ncognitive development in non-relative/FDCH and maternal care. Previous studies\nhave found that highly educated mothers devote more time with their children to\nactivities which are particularly beneficial for the children's cognitive development,\nfor example, reading to the children rather than watching television with them\n(Bianchi et al. 2004). In the models of children's behavior problems, center care is\nsignificantly more beneficial than maternal care for high-income children in their\ninternalizing behavioral development. Children from immigrant families enjoy an\nadvantage in in-home relative care. Mother's parenting skills have significant effects\non children's behavioral development. For example, non-punitive behavior is\nassociated with less internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, while neglect\nbehavior is related to more behavior problems. Finally, a change in child care type\nbetween age one and age three only has significant impacts on the language\ndevelopment of children in maternal care in the first year. Children who are cared for\nby their mothers at age one achieve higher PPVT scores when they are placed in non-\nmaternal child care at age three, compared with children persistently receiving\nmaternal care. This result is consistent with prior research that finds beneficial effects\nof non-maternal care at age three on children's cognitive development (NICHD\nThe extent of a child's nonrandom selection into each child care type is indicated\nby the estimated coefficients on the selectivity terms ls.15 No evidence of selection\nbias is found in the models of children's internalizing and externalizing behavior\nproblems. In the model of children's PPVT scores, the selectivity coefficients are\nstatistically significant and negative in non-relative/FDCH and maternal care, which\nimply a positive selection into these two types. Children selected into non-relative/\nFDCH have on average a 2.287 standard deviation increase in PPVT scores relative\nto a child drawn at random with identical observable characteristics would be\nexpected to have in that type.16 One potential explanation for this nonrandom\n34 D. Peng and P.K. Robins\nselection is that mothers with more developmentally advantaged children are more\nlikely to use non-relative care, such as FDCH or center care. By contrast, if children\nare less able or developmentally challenged in the first year, mothers may trust\nrelative care more than non-relative care. If mother's use of non-relative/FDCH is\ncorrelated with some unobserved child developmental or health characteristics, not\naccounting for the selection effects will lead to biased findings. The results suggest a\nnegative selection into relative care and a positive selection into center care, although\nthe selection effects are not statistically significant. The positive selection is also\nsignificant for maternal care. Children selected into maternal care have on average\n0.157 standard deviation rise in PPVT scores than an `identical' randomly selected\nchild would have in that type. One possible explanation for this positive selection is\nthat mothers who hold traditional childrearing beliefs, and who are willing to devote\nmore time with their children, are likely to choose exclusive maternal care. The\npresence of selection effects in the model of children's PPVT scores suggests that\nthe OLS estimates are biased due to the omission of unobserved mother or child\ncharacteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to employ the generalized two-stage\nselection model to adequately control for the endogeneity of a mother's choice of\nchild care.\nChild development outcome differentials\nFollowing the standard practice in selection models of calculating the differentials of\nchild outcomes of one type of non-maternal care relative to maternal care on the\nbasis of the selection model estimates (Maddala 1983; Trost and Lee 1984; Main and\nReilly 1993), the measure of child development outcome differential is given by:\nDy(j; k)0E[yi\n(j)(yi\n(k)]0E[E[yi\n(j)(yi\n(k)\u00bdxi\n(j)\u00bdxi\n](E[yi\n(k)\u00bdxi\n]]\ni\n^\nb\nj\n(x?\ni\n^\nb\nk\nx?( ^\nb\nj\n( ^\nb\nk\nwhere j refers to one of the four types of non-maternal care, k refers to maternal care,\nyi\n(j) and yi\n(k) are the outcomes that a child i would have obtained in care type j and\nk, respectively, ^\nb\nj\nand ^\nb\nk\nare the coefficient estimates from the general selection\nmodel, and \u00af\nx is a vector of sample means of the explanatory variables.\nGiven unbiased estimates of bj\nand bk\n, the child development outcome\ndifferential17 reflects the true varying effects of types of child care on child\ndevelopment outcomes. The differential corresponds to an experiment in which a\nchild, having observable characteristics that are the same as the average child in\nthe sample, is taken at random from the population. The differential indicates the\nexpected difference in the outcomes that this child would have obtained in one type\nof non-maternal care relative to maternal care. Table 7 reports the differentials for\neach of the three child development outcomes.\nFirst, focus on the PPVT differentials listed under column 2 in Table 7.\nCompared to maternal care in a child's first year of life, relative care in a child's\nhome and relative care in another home are associated with a 0.43 standard deviation\nrise in PPVT scores. By contrast, non-relative/FDCH is associated with a 2.053\nstandard deviation reduction in PPVT scores compared to maternal care. There is no\nsignificant difference between first-year center care and maternal care in their effects\non children's PPVT scores.\nJournal of Children and Poverty 35\nThe patterns of the effects suggested by the child development outcome\ndifferentials are in sharp contrast to those indicated by the OLS estimates. Because\nthere are no appreciable selection effects for relative care, but a positive selection\neffect for maternal care, the OLS results underestimate the effects of relative care\ncompared with maternal care. After controlling for selection bias, relative care is\nfound to be significantly more beneficial than maternal care for children's language\ndevelopment. Second, the positive selection effect for non-relative/FDCH is much\nhigher than that for maternal care. Therefore, after accounting for self-selection of\nchildren into these two child care types, the detrimental impact of non-relative/\nFDCH becomes significant and relatively large in magnitude.\nThe internalizing and externalizing differentials are shown under columns 3 and\n4 of Table 7. Center care is more beneficial than maternal care in the first year for\nchildren's behavioral development. Compared to maternal care, center care is\nand externalizing scales, respectively. The differentials also indicate a detrimental\neffect of relative care in the first year on children's behavioral development. For\nexample, relative care in the child's home is associated with 0.496 and 0.123 standard\ndeviation increases in internalizing and externalizing scales, compared to maternal\ncare. Non-relative/FDCH is also found to be significantly associated with more\nexternalizing behaviors than maternal care at child's age one. Note that, despite the\nabsence of significant selection effects in the models of children's behavior problems,\nthere is still a difference between OLS estimates and the child development outcome\ndifferentials.18 However, both results indicate significantly beneficial effects of\ncenter-based care on children's internalizing behavioral development, and signifi-\ncantly the detrimental impact of non-relatives/FDCH on children's externalizing\nbehavioral development.\n6. Conclusions\nOverall, the findings of this study suggest that in low-income families, non-maternal\ncare during the first year of a child's life may be more beneficial developmentally\nTable 7.

This is consistent with the `compensatory education' hypothesis\nproposed in prior research that non-maternal care may serve as a protective factor\nfor poor children with developmental risk (Desai, Chase-Lansdale, and Michael\n1989). Relative care is found to be more beneficial than maternal care in the first year\nfor children's language development. We find no significant difference between center\ncare and maternal care in their effects on children's PPVT scores, consistent with the\nfindings of Bernal and Keane (2006), but in contrast to other studies that find\npositive effects of day care centers on the language and cognitive development of\nWith regard to children's social development, our results indicate that center-\nbased care is more beneficial than maternal care during the first year.

Therefore, children from low-income families may benefit from\nhigh-quality center-based care in their social development while children from\nhigher-income families may not.\nThe advantages of center-based care may arise for several reasons. First, children\nin centers have greater opportunities to interact with peers. Prior research has\nfound that more experience with groups of children is related to less behavior\nproblems and more cooperative functioning (Clarke-Stewart, Gruber, and Fitzgerald\nauthoritarian childrearing beliefs (child-centered), which lead them to have more\npositive interactions with infants, and to be more likely to foster children's\nexplorations than do caregivers with authoritarian beliefs, such as fathers and\ncaregivers' education is a strong predictor of children's social development (Loeb\net al. 2003), and center caregivers typically have higher levels of education. Because\nquality measures of the various child care types are not available in the FFCWS, it is\nnot clear what characteristics of center-based care are more supportive of children's\nbehavioral development than home-based care. Further analysis along the lines\npursued here is needed using data sets where quality measures of various child care\ntypes are available in addition to data on early child development.19\nWe also find variations in the effects of child care type by the child's gender and\nrace-ethnicity. Center-based care has larger beneficial effects on externalizing\nbehavioral development for girls than for boys. Black and Hispanic children suffer\nsignificant and large cognitive disadvantages from receiving in-home relative care\nand maternal care during the first year.20 The race-ethnicity results suggest that the\nhome environments in black and Hispanic families are less conducive to children's\ncognitive development. As a result, the opportunities for learning provided by non-\nmaternal care out of child's home for black and Hispanic children may be better than\nthose that are provided by their own homes. The race-ethnicity difference in child\ncare effects is an important topic that warrants future research.\nJournal of Children and Poverty 37\nOur findings have some implications, albeit somewhat speculative, for current\nwelfare reform and child care policies. Tougher work requirements under the current\nwelfare system result in more children from lower-income families being placed in\nsome type of non-maternal child care, even during the first year of their life.\nEvidence from this study suggests that children might benefit during infancy from\ntheir experiences in certain types of non-maternal child care. Therefore, the increased\nuse of non-maternal care as a consequence of welfare reform may not adversely\naffect the development of children in low-income families.\nThis study has several limitations that should be addressed in future research.\nFirst, if possible, incorporating measures of the quality of the various child care\ntypes into the empirical model might improve our understanding of the mechanisms\nunderlying the effects of different types of child care. Second, in this study, we use a\nmother's eligibility for a child care subsidy as the sole instrument in estimating the\nchild care choice model. Although this instrument is enough to identify the model, it\nmay be unduly restrictive. Future studies should investigate other approaches that\nuse multiple instruments, possibly as many as one for each type of child care being\nused. Third, our analysis does not take into account the possibility that the mother's\nemployment decision might be endogenous. Recent studies have argued that a\nmother's employment decision is made simultaneously with her child care choice\njoint analysis in which it is possible to test for the endogeneity of employment is\ntherefore an important topic for future research. Finally, in this paper we have\nanalyzed child development outcomes measured at age three. Further analysis using\nchild development outcomes at later ages will help in understanding the longer-run\nconsequences of early child care on children's development.\n"
