The goals\nof population health care are achievable only with information on indiviuals, their\nhealth status, and the quality of their medical care. An organization that practices\npopulation health care attempts to maximize the health of individuals in a de-\nfined population given available resources and thus shares the perspectives of both\npersonal health care and public health.\nThe ultimate goal of measuring quality is to improve health outcomes by stim-\nulating improvements in health care. An increasing recognition of deficiencies in\nthe quality of health care has spawned interest in making more measurements of\nquality as a spur to actions to improve health outcomes (7, 32, 40). The increasing\nfocus on measuring and improving quality has occurred at the same time that there\nhas been a demand to demonstrate the value of health care services and to monitor\nthe performance of insurance companies, managed care organizations, and health\ncare providers in delivering services.\nInthispaper,wedescribethedefinitionsofqualityhealthcareandtheframework\nfor measuring quality, with emphasis on the performance of organizations involved\nin population health care. We describe quality measurement sets and systems,\ncriteria for the choice of measures (or indicators) within sets and systems, and\ndata sources. We also describe how quality measurements are used to improve\nhealth care and outcomes. Throughout, the paper emphasizes the importance of a\npopulation perspective in defining quality and in the choice of quality measures.\nPopulation health care is health information and clinical services provided to indi-\nviduals of a defined population. In population health care, surveillance occurs and\nindividuals are targeted for interventions based on known or predicted risk. The\nindicators of success are population statistics in the form of quality of care and\norganizational performance measures. Population health care can be practiced to\nsome extent by any entity that delivers or assures the delivery of health services to\na defined group of individuals. These organizations include insurers, whose pop-\nulation is defined according to enrollment; provider systems, whose population is\ndefined by membership via insurers, corporations, or individual's choice; or by\ngovernment providers of care, such as the Veteran's Administration, or payers of\ncare, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), whose pop-\nulations are defined by eligibility for services. Organizations that pay for or assure\nthe delivery of care, such as CMS, have the regulatory or financial capability to\nmonitor and affect the care of their defined populations. However, by nature of their\norganizational structure, integrated health care delivery systems that function as a\nunit across health care disciplines (e.g., primary and specialty providers, nurses,\nhealth educators) and settings (e.g., outpatient, inpatient, at home) are currently\nmost involved in the practice of population health care.\nPopulation health care seeks to maximize the health and well-being of persons\nin the defined population given a set of fixed resources and operational constraints.\nOrganizations voluntarily take on responsibility for population health--it is rarely\nimposed externally or mandated contractually. The orientation to populations is in-\ndicative of an organization's culture, values, and philosophy of care. Other forces\nthat motivate population health care include marketplace incentives to provide\nmore efficient care, the health professions' mission to provide more effective care,\nthe demands by payers that providers demonstrate the quality of care, and infor-\nmation technology (17).\nLinkages to Public Health\nSeveral linkages exist between public health and personal health care, such as\nthe provision of immunizations, cancer screening, and treatment of tuberculosis\n(2, 43). Population health care broadens these linkages by expanding personal\nhealth care services to a population level, and thus population health care shares\nseveral features in common with public health. Most important, both seek to main-\ntain or enhance health in a defined group. The methods of surveillance developed\nin public health are used to monitor the clinical care and health status of persons\nin population health care. Each relies on programs that deliver specific services to\nachieve the goal of health maintenance and promotion and emphasizes outreach\nand prevention. For example, a subpopulation with a high-prevalence condition\nsuch as hypertension can be targeted for prevention services that promote healthy\nhabits by means such as flyers or posters. Both operate within systems of con-\nstrained resources and must therefore allocate resources to achieve an optimal\neffect. However, unlike public health services, population health care targets in-\ndividuals with some common characteristic that selects them, such as enrollment\nin a health plan, and not geographic boundaries. Unlike public health, population\nhealth care generally does not attempt to change the physical, social, or economic\nenvironment unless done in cooperation with public health agencies.\nLinkages to Personal Health Care: Population\nHealth Care Management\nThere is a set of population health care interventions that share much in common\nwith personal medical care and utilization management. Termed population health\ncare management, these interventions focus on individual risk assessment, indi-\nvidually targeted interventions, and modification of practice patterns. Population\nhealthcaremanagementprogramsaretoolstoextendthereachofaproviderorgani-\nzation beyond the clinician's office by using data and systems to influence both\nproviders and patients to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical care. For\nexample, information can be automatiaclly generated for physicians at the time\nof a patient visit and can include reminders about overdue screening tests and the\nrisk of a cardiovascular disease event for persons with diabetes. Organizations that\npractice population health care management have access to data and, under favor-\nable circumstances, the means to change clinical practice that are often beyond\nthe reach of public health organizations, less integrated health systems, or small\nprovider groups.\nMeasurement and Perspective\nTable 1 describes some of the distinguishing characteristics of quality and perfor-\nmancemeasurementfromtheperspectiveofpersonalhealthcare,populationhealth\ncare, and public health. While the primary responsibility in personal health care\nis the individual patient, population health care and public health must consider\nthe maximization of health across individuals. Thus, the latter use epidemiological\nmethods such as surveillance to explicitly consider costs and target interventions\nat groups of people. The performance of health care organizations is also assessed\nto inform consumers. Population health care management, as a distinct set of\nTABLE 1 Distinguishing characteristics of quality and performance measurement from the\nperspective of personal health care, population health care, and public health\nPersonal health care Population health care Public health\nResponsibility Individuals Enrollees Residents of an area\nPurpose of Clinical care Surveillance of Surveillance of\nmeasurement population health population health\nOrganizational Support programs and\nperformance assessment services for the general\nSupport clinical systems population and for\ninterventions for high-risk\nhigh-risk subpopulations subpopulations\nCare management: focus\non high-risk individuals\nHow decisions Application of clinical Prioritization of population Prioritization of\nare made evidence base health problems and population health\nconsequences of resource problems and\nallocation consequences of\nresource allocation\nCare management: Application of public\napplication of clinical health evidence base\nevidence base\napproaches to health care delivery within the domain of population health care,\nuses personal health information, population statistiscs (e.g., the distribution of\nglycosylated hemoglobin scores among diabetics), risk assessment (i.e., by ap-\nplying prediction formulas), and evidence-based clinical guidelines to manage the\nhealth care of individuals.\nExperts struggled for decades to formulate a single concise, meaningful, and gen-\nerally applicable definition of the quality of health care (3). There are now several\ncommonly cited definitions (9, 12, 28), which differ in their emphasis on quality\nof life, the delivery of services, and processes of care as components of quality.\nA 1990 definition from the Institute of Medicine, which was arrived at after col-\nlecting and considering over 100 definitions of quality from the literature, appears\noften in discussions of the quality of medical care. The Institute of Medicine de-\nfined quality as \"the degree to which health services for individuals and populations\nincrease the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current\nprofessional knowledge\" (28). This definition is important in the context of this\npaper because of its explicit recognition of the population perspective in quality.\nDonabedian first suggested that there is more than one legitimate formulation of\nquality depending on the system of care and the nature and extent of responsibilities\n(11). Blumenthal clarified the relationship between different perspectives and the\ndefinition of quality of care (3). He describes four main perspectives on quality--\nthe health care professional perspective, the patient perspective, the perspective of\nhealth care plans and organizations, and the purchaser perspective--which lead to\ndifferent definitions of quality. Health care providers tend to view quality in terms\nof the attributes of care and the results of care, leading to definitions of quality\nthat emphasize technical excellence and the characteristics of patient/professional\ninteraction (11, 35). Patients tend to view quality in terms of their own preferences\nand values, leading to definitions of quality that encompass satisfaction with care,\nas well as outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, and functional status. Health care\nplans and organizations that deliver services tend to place greater emphasis on\nthe general health of the enrolled or covered population and on the function of\nthe organization (26), leading to a definition of quality that takes into account the\nability of the plan to meet the needs of enrollees. This perspective encompasses\ndecisions to limit some care to assure essential services for all and acknowledges\nthe reality of fixed resources. Purchasers, such as health care organizations, tend\nto be concerned about population-based measures of quality and organizational\nperformance (3). The purchaser perspective leads to a definition of quality that is\nsimilartothatofhealthcareorganizations.However,purchasersareveryconcerned\nabout the \"value\" of care, and this concern incorporates the price of care and the\nefficiency of the delivery of care.\nA Population Perspective on Quality and Performance\nThe distinction between quality and performance measurement is not clear in the\npublished literature. Performance measurement is the term usually applied when an\norganization is being assessed (as opposed to a hospital or an individual) and when\naccess, cost, and efficiency are being assessed as a component of quality. Org-\nanizational performance measures from a population health perspective are more\nencompassing than indicators typically encountered in personal health care quality\nassessment, where the focus is on the individual patient-provider interaction.\nPerformance measures of cost and efficiency include, for example, the number\nof people a diabetes education program serves and the cost per service. These are\nalso considered to be measures of utilization and can be unrelated to the quality of\ncare of individuals. However, a large amount of resources for an education program\nthat reaches few persons with diabetes might dictate a new approach to outreach\nor referral or a redirection of resources to prevention. From a population health\ncare perspective, performance measures include indicators of access to care (e.g.,\nwaiting time for an appointment, outreach educational letters) because the entire\npopulation, and not just those who receive care, is of concern. Other types of per-\nformance indicators especially relevant from a population health care perspective\ninclude measures of the effectiveness of prevention and patient-centered measures\nof risk behavior (19). Examples include the proportion of persons in a population\nwith obesity, the proportion of persons in a population who smoke, and the propor-\ntion of a health plan's established members who have newly diagnosed diabetes.\nQuality of care must be objectively measured to be useful in crafting strategies\nfor improving health. The alternative is subjective judgments and thus unclear\nevidence to guide decisions. Organizations must objectively measure performance\nto engage in successful performance improvement since systems and providers can\nbe held accountable only for things that are measured. Thus, discussions of quality\nof care and performance quickly transition to discussions of ways to measure\nquality and performance.\nStructure, Process, Outcome\nQuality of care can be measured based on structure, process, or outcome (12\u00ad14).\nStructural measures are the characteristics of the resources in the health system\n(e.g., the number of beds in a hospital, the number of registered nurses per patient\nin the intensive care unit). Processes embody what is done to and for a person (e.g.,\nimmunization, prescription for a medication, recommendation to cease smoking).\nOutcomes are the end results of care or the effect of the care process on the health\nand well-being of patients and populations (e.g, death, satisfaction with care, health\nstatus). Implicit in the use of structure and process to measure quality is a link to\noutcomes.\nStructure, process, and outcome measures all can provide valid information\nabout the quality of health care (4, 5, 12, 28). Organizational structure may be a root\ncauseofseveraldownstreamqualityproblemsandcriticaltothesuccessofprovider\norganizations. The main advantage of structural measures of quality is their relative\nease of measurement. The disadvantage is the often indirect link between the\nstructural variable and desired outcome. For example, staffing of intensive care\nunitswithphysicianstrainedasintensivistsisbeingusedasaperformanceindicator\nby the Pacific Business Group on Health, a consortium of insurance purchasers\noperating in California. The explicit purpose of this staffing pattern is to improve\nthe outcome of patients cared for in an intensive care unit. There is some empiric\nevidence of a correlation between staffing and better outcome. But the link between\nstaffing and better outcome clearly is indirect--it must be the things that are done\nby the intensivist or a system or institution that uses intensivists and not strictly\nthe presence of the intensivist that improves outcome.\nProcess measures are appealing to providers because they are directly related\nto what providers do. They are actionable, often pointing directly to areas where\ncare needs to be improved. The appeal of a measure to providers is critical because\nchanges in what providers do and say often determines the success or the failure of\nefforts to change outcomes. However, there are several arguments against process\nmeasures as measures of quality of care. Processes are not necessarily important\npredictors of outcome, and directing resources at processes that do not affect\noutcomes may increase health care costs without producing health improvements\n(16). It may be difficult to achieve consensus on the correct process for many\nclinical problems, especially when the evidence-base is poor.\nOutcome measures also appeal intuitively to providers and can also be used\nto target quality improvement efforts. But some outcomes (e.g., cancer mortality)\nare rare and thus comparisons of quality based on rare outcomes are often of low\nstatistical power (4). Many outcomes are not under the control of the health care\nproviders, and conclusions about the quality of care based on them may be invalid.\nMoreover, it may be difficult to assign responsibility for outcomes to a single\nprovider or a system of care when there are no clear points of entry or exit to the\nhealth care system (28). For example, a case of hepatitis B in an adult member\nof a health care organization might occur because of failure of the pediatrician in\nanother organization to vaccinate appropriately during infancy.\nA performance measurement set or system is an \"interrelated set of process and/or\noutcome measures that facilitate internal and external comparisons of an organi-\nzation's performance over time\" (27). Specific performance measurements within\na set measure the quality of care or some other desired attribute of care delivery\n(i.e., access, efficiency).\nPerformance measurements sets are developed by regulatory bodies, such as\nstate and federal governments; agencies that accredit health care organizations,\nsuch as the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations\n(JCAHO); voluntary organizations representing disease constituencies, such as the\nAmerican Diabetes Association; professional societies, such as the American Col-\nlege of Cardiology; and organizations that themselves deliver health care services.\nThe motivation for developing measurement sets is generally the same for each\ntype of organization involved in developing them--to define quality and drive its\nimprovement and to create accountability for demonstrating and improving quality.\nQuality measures are used for accreditation of institutions, to provide accountabil-\nity to payers of care, to educate consumers, for internal quality improvement, and\nfor research into care delivery.\nThere are several measurement systems for evaluation and comparison of hos-\npital care (27). A set of quality indicators developed specifically for use with\nhospital discharge abstract data have been developed in the Healthcare Cost and\nUtilization Project (HCUP). JCAHO has recently begun to require reporting of\nsome measures of quality and outcome and to take performance on these measures\ninto account in making decisions about accreditation. To the extent that persons\nhospitalized for a given condition constitute a population, the JCAHO measures\nare indicators of population health care performance.\nThe Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS\u00ae), first estab-\nlished in 1991, is a performance measurement system (8) that has been used by\nthe National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) to compare the quality of\ncare of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). HEDIS\u00ae measures have been\nextended to other kinds of insurance schemes. Medicare and Medicaid require re-\nporting of HEDIS\u00ae measures separately for beneficiaries in HMOs. Table 2 shows\ntopic items under two types of HEDIS\u00ae measures, \"effectiveness of care\" and\n\"access/availability of care,\" which are selected from the 2001 HEDIS\u00ae measure-\nment set (33). To follow these HEDIS\u00ae topics, a potential measure of childhood\nimmunization status is the proportion of children who have had all immunizations\nrecommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics by 24 months of age. An-\nother potential measure, of breast cancer screening, is the proportion of women\nage 50 years and older who have had a mammogram in the past two years. These\nmeasures qualify as population health care measures. HEDIS\u00ae performance is con-\nsidered in decisions of NCQA to accredit health plans. HEDIS\u00ae scores form the\nbasis for report cards, which are widely publicized for the use of consumers and\norganizations in choosing a health plan.\nPerformance measurements to be used in public health settings have also been\ndeveloped (10, 23, 36), and a national initiative is under way to assess local and\nstate public health system quality (39). Many states and localities have developed\nor conducted performance assessment (29), although internal, quantitative quality\nassessment in local health departments is not yet routine.\nEffectiveness of care\nChildhood immunization status\nAdolescent immunization status\nBreast cancer screening\nCervical cancer screening\nChlamydia screening in women\nControlling high blood pressure\nBeta blocker treatment after a heart attack\nCholesterol management after acute cardiovascular events\nComprehensive diabetes care\nUse of appropriate medications for people with asthma\nFollow-up after hospitalization for mental illness\nAntidepressant medication management\nAdvising smokers to quit\nFlu shots for older adults\nPneumonia vaccination status for older adults\nMedicare Health Outcomes Survey\nAccess/availability of care\nAdults' access to preventive/ambulatory health services\nChildren's access to primary care practitioners\nPrenatal and postpartum care\nAnnual dental visit\nAvailability of language interpretation services\nDifferent perspectives and definitions of quality, as described above, call for dif-\nferent approaches to quality measurement (11). It is helpful to clarify the purpose\nof measurement in order to guide the selection and development of measures. We\nfocus our discussion here on the purposes of organizations involved in population\nhealth care. Measures are chosen or developed for internal performance improve-\nment by provider organizations. Measures for accreditation or external reporting\naredevelopedbyagenciesthatassurecaredelivery,suchasNCQA.Manymeasures\ncan be used for both purposes.\nMeasures of population health care inevitably involve consideration of data\nresources. Measures developed by care providers may emphasize operational con-\nstraints and the organization's capacity to effect change, and may include perfor-\nmance indicators that are specific to the care delivery system and the problems\nfacing the population or the organization. Population health care measures devel-\noped by agencies that assure care delivery must be applicable across a wide variety\nof settings.\nThe quality of clinical care for populations is generally assessed by either\nprocess or outcome measures, since structural quality measures are the most distant\nfrom outcomes and have their effect through changes in processes. Organizational\nsystems performance also can be assessed by carefully considered measures of\nutilization (such as hospitalization rates among diabetics), access to care (such\nas waiting time for a mental health appointment), and time-efficiency (such as\nthe turn-around time for medical test reports). The meaning of these measures\nmust be carefully considered because they can be dissociated from quality (e.g.,\nhigh quality may exist with either high or low utilization) or have a complex\nrelationship to quality. For example, there might be an optimal range for number of\nphysicians and the size of their patient panels that preserve organizational viability\nin a competitive marketplace (having fewer physicians and larger panels) while not\nreducing needed access to care (having more physicians and smaller panels) and\nnot encouraging medical errors due to time constraints (having smaller panels).\nAlthough perfect measures and measurement systems do not exist, more or less\nuseful measures do. Several criteria are helpful to guide the choice of performance\nmeasures. These criteria (e.g., meaningfulness or relevance, feasibility, actionabil-\nity, reliability, validity) have been expressed in a variety of ways in published\nsources, but all revolve around similar key concepts (15, 30, 31, 36). Key issues\nfor measuring quality and performance from a population health care perspective\nare discussed below.\nTopic Areas for Measurement\nOrganizations providing or assuring the quality of population health care will chose\ntopic areas for measurement where a potential exists to significantly improve heath-\nrelated quality of life and decrease morbidity and mortality among members of the\ndefined population. An assessment of the cost effectivness of care associated with\na potential topic area will help determine its relative importance for measurement.\nOne starting place for identifying areas of importance for quality assessment and\nimprovementisthehealthcaregoalsdefinedbyHealthyPeople2010(34)andmany\ncomplementaty plans by state and local health agencies. These goals are chosen\nto improve the quality and length of life, as well as decrease health disparities,\nin the U.S. population. Specific population subgroups may have needs that differ\nfrom the entire U.S. population. National data sources, such as the Morbidity and\nMortality Weekly Report and publications from the National Center for Health\nStatistics (both under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), provide\ngeographically based population health information. Information on members of\na health plan is often available from electronic administrative and clinical care\ndatabases and can include causes of mortality, morbidity, and utilization. Using\nsources such as these, the significance of the conditions and risk factors (such as\nsmoking) on morbidity, mortality, and health resource use can be estimated for a\ndefined population (30).\nEvidence Base\nMeasures are most successful in driving improvements in care when the actions\nthey represent are evidence-based (or have a clear, logical link to outcomes). For\nexample, a performance measure for diabetes care that is based on data from\nwell-conducted randomized trials (e.g., use of ACE-inhibitors in diabetic patients\nwith microalbuminuria) is a better candidate for successful quality improvement\ninterventions than measures based on currently weaker evidence, such as screen-\ning everyone with hypertension for chronic kidney disease. In recent years, the\nevidence base with which to make personal health care decisions has received\nincreasing emphasis. During the latter half of the twentieth century, randomized\ncontrolled trials became the standard of medical knowledge, and systematic re-\nviews that synthesize the results of multiple scientific investigations have grown\nin influence (7).\nThe evidence base for population health care is essentially the evidence base\nfor personal health care, rather than a combination of personal and public health\nevidence. As the evidence base for public health becomes more established (45),\nand if cooperation between public health agencies and health plans grows, the\npublic health evidence base likely will gain influence on the practice of population\nhealth care.\nPopulation health care management applies the generalizable results of scien-\ntific studies to estimate the risks an individual faces and the benefits of interventions\nto modify those risks--the traditional domain of the health care professional. A\nwealth of evidence exists to support important population health care interventions.\nFor example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Study (HOPE) provides strong evi-\ndence for the beneficial effect of angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nin persons with diabetes over the age of 55 years and who have cardiovascular dis-\nease or another established cardiovascular risk factor (20). On the basis of this\nevidence, patients who satisfy these criteria but are not on the recommended med-\nication can be identified, and information or prompts to action for physicians\nor patients can be delivered. For example, a specific intervention used at Kaiser\nPermanente Southern California is a computer-generated datasheet for scheduled\nappointments that lists medications, relevant lab data, other useful information,\nand specific recommendations for care that are evidence-based, tailored to the in-\ndividual patient (e.g., ACE inhibitor by HOPE study criteria, as described above),\nand easy for providers to act upon at the point of service to the patient.\nFor clinical quality improvement, it is helpful to clarify the objectives and pro-\ncess of care. Evidence-based guidelines that explicitly state actions for specific\nobjectives can help define performance measures and provide a model for improv-\ning the process of care. Rigorously developed guidelines, such as those of the U.S.\nPreventive Services Task Force (47), are an excellent source of information. How-\never, the evidence base, and guidelines produced from evidence, are necessary but\nnot sufficient for identifying measures that have the potential to improve quality.\nActionability\nActionability--the ability of resources applied by the health care provider or sys-\ntem to significantly affect the measure--is also an important consideration in\nchoosing measures that can be used to drive performance improvement. For ex-\nample, computerized reminders to physicians at the time of an appointment have\nthe potential to produce improvements in routinely scheduled services, such as\ncancer screening tests (41) or monitoring tests for a person with diabetes (e.g.,\nLDL, HgbA1c). Providers and managers are much more supportive of proposed\nmeasures when change for the better is possible. Measures may also be more ac-\ntionable when supported by other stakeholders, such as payers of care (business,\nthe government), or patients, whose preferences provide justification for additional\nresource diversion into the area of concern.\nAn example of an actionable measure, developed by the Picker Institute (38) for\nassessing hospital care, is \"Were you given enough privacy when discussing your\ncondition or treatment?\" The responses are \"Yes, always,\" \"Yes, sometimes,\" and\n\"No.\" This type of question can lead directly to actions that improve care. Compare\nthis to a common type of satisfaction measure, \"How satisfied are you with your\npain management?\" with a five-point response from \"Very dissatisfied\" to \"Very\nsatisfied,\" and it is obvious that the latter measure is not readily actionable because\nreasons for the level of satisfaction are not specified by the question.\nHigh levels of performance sometimes can be associated with diminishing\nreturns for increasing costs, or a level can be reached at which the cost associ-\nated with achieving better performance in one area may negatively affect quality\nin other areas. For example, resources may be better used to screen previously\nuntested members for cervical cancer than to increase the return rate for repeat\nmammography screening. These considerations affect resource distribution and\nthe actionability of measures.\nWhen comparing the performance of organizations or providers, it is essential that\nany differences in the measurements are not due to differences in measurement\nmethodology and thus permit valid conclusions about variations among the units\nbeing compared. The validity of comparisons is achieved by standardization of the\nmethods for making the measures. This is done by provision of detailed rules for\ndata collection and reporting and development of protocols for collecting data for\nthe measures. These descriptions and protocols are called \"specifications.\" Table 3\ngives example specifications for three measures from a diabetes measurement\nset used to compare performance across Kaiser Permanente. Kaiser Permanente\nis America's largest not-for-profit health maintenance organization, serving 8.1\nmedical centers in nine states.\nValid conclusions about time trends in performance requires that the method-\nology for the measure be stable over time. Changes in the definitions of numerator\nor denominator for a clinical performance measure will change the measure. In\naddition, changes in the accuracy or completeness of the data that generate the\nmeasure can affect trendability. For example, improvements in the recording of\nimmunizations in health plan medical records of immunizations received outside\nthe health plan would results in an improvement in a measure that is not accurately\nindicative of improvement in the quality of care, only improvements in the quality\nof the data.\nQuality and performance measurements in some performance sets are subject\nto routine audit by external agencies. Audit is especially likely when the measures\nwill be publicly reported and might affect decisions of individuals or organizations\nto purchase or pay for health care from the reporting organizations. For example,\nHEDIS\u00ae clinicalmeasuresareauditedbyalargeaccountingfirmandonlymeasures\nthat pass the audit can be publicly reported.\nComputer-Stored Administrative and Clinical Data\nIt is attractive to use already collected computer-stored data for quality and perfor-\nmance measures because there are no costs associated with collecting these data,\nthe data are easily accessible, the number of people or events included in many\ndatabases is large, and the data are often \"population-based.\"\nComputer-stored data available to health systems can be divided broadly into\ntwo categories--administrative data and clinical data. Administrative data are col-\nlected for business purposes and include information collected at the time of enroll-\nment or premiums/dues payment (e.g., name, address, date of birth, social security\nnumber) and information used for billing and claims processing (e.g., dates\nTABLE 3 Example specifications of year 2000 diabetes performance measures from Kaiser\nPermanente\nMeasure Specification\nThe percentage of members with Denominator: The number of members identified as\ndiabetes who were tested with a having diabetesa\nhemoglobin A1c test during Numerator: The number of members in the denominator\nthe reporting period who had at least one of the following tests for glycemic\ncontrol with a test date during the reporting period:\nHemoglobin A1c or total glycated hemoglobin\nCalculation: Laboratory data are used to identify those\nmembers with diabetes who receive at least one test for\nhemoglobin A1c during the reporting period (one year)\nThe percentage of members with Denominator: The number of members identified as having\ndiabetes whose LDL-C is (a) diabetes who were 18 years of age by 01/01 of the\n<130 mg/dl for patients without reporting period\ncoronary artery disease (CAD), Numerator: The number of members in the denominator\nand (b) <100 mg/dl for patients with a most recent LDL-C value that is (a) <130 mg/dl\nwith CAD for patients without CAD,\nand (b) <100 mg/dl for patients with CAD\nCalculation: A CAD case-identification database is\nused to identify members with CAD.

Clinical data are collected to support\nclinical practice and patient care and include information collected in electronic\nmedical records. There is overlap, and some data collected mainly for adminis-\ntrative purposes have clinical uses. For example, data from prescriptions may be\ncomputer stored to facilitate administrative functions such as refills and drug cost-\naccounting, but the information may also be used clinically to manage patients.\nFor many types of computer-stored data, there is no clear distinction between ad-\nministrative and clinical uses. For example, the use of hospital discharge data used\nto monitor hospital discharges for procedures is both administrative and clinical.\nComputer-stored data collected strictly for administrative reasons generally do\nnot contain clinical detail (see Table 4). The accuracy of both computer-stored\nadministrative and clinical data is uncertain until evaluated because of the cir-\ncumstances under which the data are collected. Data in both computer-stored\nadministrative and clinical databases may not be complete. Data fields (e.g., birth\ndate, race/ethnicity) may be missing in a membership database. Information on\nservices received outside the system may not be captured. For example, influenza\nshots given at a community clinic may not be recorded in a health plan's immu-\nnization database. Prescriptions filled in the local drugstore will not be recorded in\nthe prescription database. Other well-recognized limitations associated with coded\ndata from hospital discharges and ambulatory visits include imprecise coding of\ndiagnoses and procedures, lack of specificity of codes, undercoding of comor-\nbidities and complications, and different levels of coding completeness across\ninstitutions. All of the sources of inaccuracy and incompleteness affect the useful-\nness of computer-stored data for quality and performance measurement and the\nvalidity of conclusions based on the measure.\nDatafromoutsideahealthsystemmaybeofinterestformeasuringperformance,\nespecially for research purposes. Linking these data to those available within a\nhealth plan poses the problem of matching individual records since unique person\nTABLE 4 Strengths and limitations of administrative versus clinical data\nCharacteristics of data Administrative data Clinical data\nClinical detail Low High\nAccuracy Uncertain Uncertain\nLower if judgment Higher if a system of\nor memory is required standardization exists (e.g.,\nfor coding laboratory test calibration)\nCompleteness Varies Varies\nHigher if data is required, Higher if data entry is automatic\nentry is automatic, there or access to health plan\nare significant financial services is good\nimplications, or access to\nhealth plan services is good\nidentifiers are not shared. Moreover, it may be difficult for health plans to assess\nthe accuracy of data external to their systems, and data like those on mortality can\nbe delayed up to a year.\nMedical Records\nMedical records, both paper and electronic, are an important source of information\nfor performance measurement. Information from the medical records may be the\nsole basis for a performance measure or it can be used to supplement computer-\nstored data. For example, the accuracy of a measure of beta-blocker use after acute\nmyocardial infarction as a measure of quality could be improved by reviewing the\npaper charts or the electronic medical records of people who did not receive a beta-\nblocker to determine whether this is because of a contraindication to beta-blocker\nuse.\nMedical records, both paper and electronic, are not good sources of data on mor-\ntality outcomes, functional status, or patient satisfaction unless special attention\nhas been placed on collecting such information in the course of clinical practice.\nMedical records may not themselves be complete. For example, the contraindica-\ntion to beta-blocker use may not be recorded in the medical record. Finally, there\nis almost never a protocol for the recording of information in a medical record.\nProviders may differ in their threshold for recording whether the patient had a\ncomorbid condition or may use different criteria to make a diagnosis.\nPatient Report\nStatements from individuals about care or about their perceptions are another\nsource of information on processes and outcomes. They are the only source of\ndata on satisfaction with care and most measures of functional status. Performance\nmeasurement based on reports from individuals can be costly when based on\nsurveys of large populations.\nAll surveys are subject to bias due to nonresponse. Nonresponse tends to be\nhigh in surveys done for measurement of the quality of care. For example, in\nKaiser Permanente, the Picker Institute survey of hospital performance (18, 38)\nhad a response rate of 40%, and an internal survey of satisfaction with pregnancy\nand newborn care had a response rate of 33% (25). Little work has been done to\ndetermine whether respondents to surveys of the quality of care are representative.\nFinally, problems exist with the accuracy of self-reported data. Patients do not\nalways accurately report their receipt of services. For preventive services, there is a\ntendency to \"telescope,\" reporting receipt of services more recently than they were\nactually performed (44). Some individuals may not know which services they have\nreceived. A person may, for example, know that they had a \"shot\" but they do\nnot whether the shot was for influenza or pneumococcal pneumonia. Consumer\nsatisfaction ratings may not always be reliable indicators of quality because con-\nsumers cannot always deem whether services are appropriate or technically good\n(1), and the ratings may not reflect the outcome for the entire population at risk\n(e.g., a patient with a contagious disease may dislike a treatment program even\nthough it is beneficial to the patient and others).\nPopulation health care is dependent on performance measures to objectively assess\nthe effectiveness of its programs. In clinical medicine, one-on-one patient-provider\ncontact and individual test results are used to judge the status and progress of\npatients. In population health care, individuals are risk-assessed and interventions\nprompted, but the measures of success are population statistics. Success is judged\nby comparisons with past performance, benchmarks, or the performance of similar\norganizations.\nPopulation health care measures generally do not delve into the mechanism\nof action of complex care interventions, such as the diverse effects of a self-care\neducational program for a chronic disease. Detailed analysis of such interventions\nis the realm of program evaluation. Rather, the receipt of services, the immediate\nresults they produce, and ultimate outcomes are monitored over time. Performance\nmeasures thus point toward opportunities for improving care. Since it is imprac-\ntical to measure all aspects of care, even by rotating measures periodically into\nand out of use, performance measures cannot reveal every reason for a given level\nof performance. For that, subject matter knowledge and creativity are required to\nextract information that is useful for performance improvement. For example, if\nsatisfaction with sexually transmitted disease and birth control counseling services\nis low among teens, then use of these services may decline and disease or unin-\ntended pregnancies may result. Efforts should be made to understand the reasons\nfor low satisfaction, such as fear of an overly visible waiting area, so that corrective\nmeasures can be taken and result in improved performance.\nInvalid conclusions can sometimes be drawn from measures that are not fully\ninterpretable without understanding data limitations, potential confounding fac-\ntors (i.e., covariates), and what constitutes good performance. For example, an\ninfluenza outbreak can significantly change hospitalization rates among diabetics,\nbut without that knowledge, an increase in rates might be attributed to a variety\nof reasons, and may not include a discussion of rates of influenza immunization.\nThus, the users of performance results need to be educated about the limits and\ninterpretation of results.\nOrganizational Conditions for Performance Improvement\nFor performance measures to have an effect on performance improvement, clear\nobjectivesmustexist,andtheremustbeaninfrastructureofindividualswithsubject\nmatter knowledge and an ability to change the system of care. Objectives are often\nchosen that require a strong effort but are potentially achievable, with an idealized\ngoal in mind. For example, a goal for breast cancer screening might be to maximize\nmammography rates among eligible women, recognizing that there will always be\nmembers who chose not to be screened or continually defer making a conscious\nchoice even after appropriate outreach is made. The objective for a given period\nof time might be to raise the absolute screening rate from 75% to 85% after\nconsidering the current rate, what screening rate is potentially achievable given\nthe resources at hand, and the opportunity costs involved.\nThe question of what organizational structure will achieve the best results is\nnot well understood and may depend on the organization's mission, culture, lead-\nership, resources, and accountabilities. Integrated health systems with hospitals,\nclinics, primary care, specialty care, comprehensive data systems, and a focus on\nprevention are clearly in a position of strength to act on and alter care relative to\nother organizations that are more fractionated, have less access to comprehensive\ndata, and focus less on the long term. In addition, accountability to shareholders\nor the needs of one large payer may limit an organization's response to prob-\nlems regarding current and future performance by focusing improvement only on\npublicly reportable performance measures or a subpopulation of their member-\nship. Population health care is focused on risk reduction and therefore is more\nlikely to be practiced by organizations with a long-term, broad view of health\ncare.\nThere is no question that health professionals who understand medical evidence\nand ways to create changes in the care delivery system are needed to accomplish\ncontinuous, positive change within any provider system. Such experts should work\nwithin an organizational structure that supports both creativity and the reaching of\nconsensus, the authority to overcome stasis and take action, and the responsibility\nto monitor and be accountable for results. One example is a model employed at\nKaiser Permanente Southern California, in which lead physicians, nurses, pharma-\ncists, educators, and others form teams in each of several areas served by a Kaiser\nFoundation Health Plan medical center. These teams meet periodically to com-\npare performance across sites, discuss programs in place, identify problems and\nopportunities for improvement, brainstorm solutions, plan a response, and monitor\nthe results in a continuous cycle. Because the members are leaders within their\nclinical areas (e.g., diabetes care), and the organizational culture to support this\napproach exists, they are able to create positive changes in this large and complex\nhealth care system. For example, with a host of interventions employed for dia-\nbetes care, improvements in several measures of screening for dyslipidemia and\nmicroalbuminuria, and therapy for dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, were seen\nover several years, and are believed to be largely due to performance monitoring,\nfeedback, and multifaceted population health interventions, rather than simply\ndue to changes in practice patterns over time (22). A longstanding and success-\nful population-based approach to chronic illness care and prevention has been\ndescribed at Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (19, 46, 48).\nPerformance feedback, at a group or individual provider level, is one method\nof creating change (24, 37, 49). Sometimes, incentives accompany performance\n(21). Using the method of feedback, the details of change are often left to the\nprovider groups whose performance is assessed. Although engaging providers by\nfeedback or incentives may be an important incitement to change, additional meth-\nods exist in integrated delivery systems. These other methods include population\nhealth care management programs that assist providers to perform better and more\neasily by removing aspects of care delivery, such as tedious chart reviews for test\ndata, scheduling routine care, or making health education referrals. Computerized\nreminders of individually tailored prevention services or of drug interactions, tar-\ngeted to providers or patients, are an example of systems used to reduce workload,\novercome human error, and improve performance.\nThere are many dozens of organizations and entities that are or want to be involved\nin creating measures of quality and performance. There are hundreds, if not thou-\nsands, of measures of quality and performance that could be and are proposed.\nIncreasingly, entities such as purchasers are asking for performance measures that\npertain only to their own employees.\nThe panoply of measures and parties involved in defining quality measures cre-\nates an increasing burden for health systems that must produce the data that are\nused in measurement. The volume of work and the amount of resources that would\nbe required to meet all of the requests for all of the measures that have been or\nare in development are staggering. More important, even if data were available for\nevery measure, systems would not be able to act on all areas of performance assess-\nment simultaneously. The measures need to be prioritized. Nationally standardized\npopulation health care measures--process, outcomes, and efficiency--that allow\nbenchmarking and comparisons across health systems are preferrable to multiple,\nindependent, and incongruous indicator sets.\nMajor changes in measurement specifications too often occur and result in mea-\nsures that are untrendable. In the absence of trendability, the effect of changes made\nto improve performance cannot be assessed. Entities that promulgate measurement\nspecifications would enhance the impact of the measures on care if the importance\nof trendability were better appreciated and the effect of changes in specifications\non trendability were better recognized.\nThe Federal Privacy Rule, promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act (HIPAA) (6), will undoubtedly affect the use of popu-\nlation health care measures because these measures are made up of protected\nhealth information. For health care operations, including population-based activi-\nties relating to improving health or reducing health care costs, where the data are\nheld within the provider organization that collected them, no prior consent from\nmembers or tracking of data accessions is required. When individual-level pro-\ntected de-identified health data are released to another organization, consent and\ntracking data accessions are again not required. It seems unlikely that identified\nprotected health information would be required for summary measures moni-\ntored by external organizations or reported to the public. However, the collection\nandpreparationofidentifiedorpotentiallyidentifiablehealthdata,whenperformed\nfor external reporting, will require the additional privacy safeguards described in\nHIPAA, including patient consent or waiver of consent by an institutional review\nboard, on-site de-identification of data, and special business contracts that provide\nassurances of data privacy when external organizations collect or prepare iden-\ntifiable data held by providers. By April 2003, full compliance with HIPAA is\nrequired.\nCONCLUSION\nPopulation health care is a movement toward a population orientation among or-\nganizations providing or assuring personal health care services. The perspective of\nthese organizations is to consider the health and welfare of their entire population.\nProviders, in particular, must consider how the resources at their disposal can be\nbrought to bear to create a health return on investment. Performance, in terms of\nhealth status, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, receives great emphasis. Measures\nof performance, whether for internal quality improvement or external reporting,\nare measures of success.\nAs information technology improves and disseminates, more useful measures\nwill become possible at reasonable cost, but efforts still must be made to obtain\nmeaningful, valid, reliable, and actionable measures if clinical quality is to be\nimproved. The adoption of performance measures--many of them standardized--\nby many organizations has increased the capacity for research on organizational\nsystems and quality. Although unbiased comparisons are difficult across health\nsystems, this avenue of systems research has the potential for large gains in the\nquality of medical services (7). In addition, the compilation of data by large health\nplans on populations that lie within the jurisdictions of state and local health\ndepartments suggests that data sharing for specific purposes (e.g., immunization\nrate tracking) might assist community health planning and, ultimately, general\npopulation health outcomes. Data sharing has been described as one attribute of a\nsocially responsible HMO (42).\nPopulation health care management, when practiced with clinical goals in mind,\nis an exciting area for clinical quality improvement. These programs use a team\napproach and resources not readily available during the doctor-patient interaction\nto extend the clinical reach of the provider organization. Increased opportunities for\nimproving access to care, identifying and preventing medical errors, and applying\nrisk-appropriate screening and treatment services are created for patients when\npopulation health care is layered over traditional clinical practice.\nThe Annual Review of Public Health is online at\nhttp://publhealth.annualreviews.org\nfaction: what we know about and what we\nstill need to explore.
