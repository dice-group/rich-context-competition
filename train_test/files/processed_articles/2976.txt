Risk factors iden-\ntified as nonmodifiable are age and family\nhistory of premature CHD. Both modifi-\nable and nonmodifiable risk factors can be\npresent for many years before clinical CHD\ndevelops.

Whether a patient reaches an NCEP target goal\nfor risk reduction from CHD depends on several factors, in-\ncludingthepotencyofthedrugintervention,thestartingLDL\nlevel of the patient, the target LDL level, genetic variations,\nand potential differences in drug metabolism. For this evalu-\nation, appropriate patient identification strategies, interven-\ntions, and counseling on lifestyle modifications are assumed\nto have occurred; whatever benefit there was from diet and\ncounseling has been achieved; and the drug therapy is the\ncause of further LDL reduction. The target goals for modifi-\ncation of the LDL risk factor are defined by the second re-\nport of the NCEP's Expert Panel1 and are stratified for pri-\nmary prevention (patients without established CHD) and\nsecondary prevention (patients with established symptom-\natic CHD). Although there is evidence of the beneficial ef-\nfects of reducing total cholesterol and/or increasing HDL lev-\nels,27 total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios or LDL-HDL\nratios were not included in the NCEP guidelines,1,2 and thus\nwere not evaluated in this analysis.\nPatients were stratified by risk categories, and target\nreductions in LDL concentration to reach treatment goals\nwere based on data from the National Health and Nutri-\ntional Examination Survey III (NHANES III) (National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics, unpublished data, 1993) and NCEP\nguidelines, which assume an LDL reduction of 10% with\ndiet therapy alone.1,28,29 Primary and secondary preven-\ntion patients were assumed to respond to drug interven-\ntion with a similar percentage decrease in LDL level.30\nA MEDLINE search was conducted of the English-\nwith emphasis on articles published since 1991. The spe-\ncific intent of the search was to gather data on drug thera-\npies classified as \"major classes\" by NCEP to evaluate the\neffect of the drug therapy on LDL levels in patients. Data\non the response of different subgroups of patients, ie, those\nwith CHD vs a general population cohort, were reviewed\nfor evidence of a difference in LDL reduction.\nSearch terms included hyperlipidemia, hyperlipid-\nemia/drug therapy, coronary heart disease, HMG-CoA\nreductase inhibitors, niacin, and bile acid sequestrants. The\nsearch was limited to the English language, human sub-\njects, randomized controlled trials, and drug therapy.\nArticles meeting these criteria were reviewed for poten-\ntial data extraction.\nArticles were reviewed by one reviewer (K.L.B.). A deter-\nmination of study quality was made on the basis of scien-\ntific rigor, study design, and publication in peer-reviewed\njournals, with the exception of data reviewed by the Food\nand Drug Administration as a component of the drug-\napproval process. General principles for reporting results\nof clinical trials in biomedical literature were applied to the\nstudies.31 Large studies with randomization, blinding of in-\nvestigators, and parallel placebo control, or crossover de-\nsigns were preferred over small open-label studies. Data were\ncollected on sample size, LDL reduction, mean LDL reduc-\ntion, drug therapy, serial measurements of LDL reduction\nif a dose-titration study, and length of study. A weighted\nmean LDL reduction was calculated and used as a variable\nfor the percentage of patients who reach target goal. The\nweighted mean was calculated from the total number of pa-\ntients per study, multiplied by the mean LDL reduction.\nThe number was summed with the result of similar calcu-\nlations for other studies examining the same drug inter-\nvention. The resultant number was divided by the total\n(pooled) number of patients. An expert panel of practic-\ning clinical consultants consisting of a cardiologist, an in-\nternist, a family practitioner, 2 pharmacists, and a dieti-\ncian reviewed the reference selection to validate an\nappropriate representation of the literature. The physi-\ncian consultants were selected from a list of consultants\nmaintained by the military services offices of the surgeons\ngeneral. The pharmacists and dietician were selected based\non clinical reputation within the Department of Defense.\nobtained from the US Department of Health and Human\nServices, Public Health Services. These data contained risk\nfactor information and LDL values for persons older than\n20 years. The risk factors were stratified by presence of CHD,\n2 or more risk factors without CHD, fewer than 2 risk fac-\ntors without CHD, sex, and ethnicity. A cumulative fre-\nquency curve of LDL values for each risk category was con-\nstructed (Figure). This curve was used to estimate the\npercentage of patients expected to achieve the minimum\nLDL reduction to meet the NCEP guidelines.\nTo forecast patient outcomes, a spreadsheet (Lotus 1-2-3,\nrelease version 4.01 for Windows; Lotus Development Corp,\nCambridge, Mass) was constructed to determine the maxi-\nmum LDL level a person may have and still reach NCEP\ntargets given the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention\n(Table 1). The formula was as follows:\nMaximum LDL Level =\n% LDL Reduction\nThe mean percentage LDL reduction was obtained from\nTable 2,32-93 and the maximum LDL level to reach NCEP\ntarget was read from Table 1. This maximum LDL level was\nthen plotted in the Figure, the intersection of the LDL level\ndistribution curve was determined, and the cumulative per-\ncentage of patients reaching NCEP target for a particular\ndrug therapy was determined.\nFor example, from Table 2, the mean percentage of\nLDL reduction for 20 mg of pravastatin sodium is 24.8%.\nIn Table 1, the 24.8% (round the percentage to the nearest\nwhole number) reduction in LDL corresponds to an ap-\nmg/dL) is noted and, moving vertically, the intersection of\nthe \"High-Risk Male\" curve is determined. A horizontal line\nis drawn to the y-axis and the cumulative percentage of high-\nrisk males who will achieve a target NCEP LDL level with\n20 mg of pravastatin is noted to be approximately 87%.

The\npurpose of this analysis is to approximate the number\nof patients from a population perspective that would reach\nNCEP target LDL levels based on drug intervention.\nRESULTS\nPublished data from the clinical trials on the LDL reduc-\ntion provided by a drug therapy, merged with data from\nNHANES III, provide a useful scale for estimating the\npercentage of a patient population who will reach the\ntarget LDL level with a given therapy under ideal con-\nditions (Table 3).\nThe anticipated outcome varies based on the inter-\nvention strategies for the patient risk category. While male\nand female have some small numerical differences in the\npercentage of population reaching target goal of therapy,\nit cannot be determined at this time if this is a true dif-\nference, an artifact of the imprecise risk factor classifi-\ncation of the NCEP guidelines, difference in drug therapy,\nor some other reason. The studies included in our analy-\nsis did not necessarily report data by sex of patients, and\nsome studies did not include women in their protocols.\nIn addition to directly reading forecast outcomes for\nmonotherapy from Table 3, it can also be used to fore-\ncast the outcomes of combination therapy.

With the\nexception of high-risk females, patients with estab-\nlished CHD apparently have a lower mean LDL level than\ndo patients in most other cholesterol groups (Figure).\nHowever, since the LDL target is lower than in the other\npatient groups, the overall percentage of LDL reduction\nrequired is greater. To reach the treatment goal in this\ngroup, the use of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coen-\nzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor is required.

A wide range of therapeutic\ninterventions are available to the clinician.\nMost patients with moderate primary hypercholes-\nterolemia, with fewer than 2 risk factors, and without a\ndiagnosis of CHD or without heterozygous familial hy-\npercholesterolemia can be effectively treated with virtu-\nally any intervention. Clinical judgment should dictate\nwhether diet therapy alone can reach treatment goals be-\nfore initiating individualized drug therapy.\nPatients who require a substantial reduction in LDL\nmay not achieve it with monotherapy. This is because\nthere is a diminishing return in LDL reduction expected\nfrom increasing the dose of a drug (Table 2). The lipid-\nlowering effects of many drugs, especially the HMG-\nCoA reductase inhibitors, tend to follow a log-linear re-\nlationship and reach a dose plateau. As the dose is\nIn applying the results of this analysis, the limita-\ntions of the methods and the extrapolation into clini-\ncal practice must be considered. The first limitation is\nthe trials evaluated for inclusion in the analysis. Since\nwe primarily focused on randomized controlled trials\nfrom 1991 to the present, earlier trials are underrepre-\nsented. Seven years of clinical trials may not provide\nsufficient patient sampling to draw conclusions since\nsome trials had very few patients. The second limita-\ntion is using a mean percentage LDL reduction to esti-\nmate the percentage of population who will reach tar-\nget NCEP goal. In this study, we made the assumption\nthat the observed mean percentage of LDL reduction\napproximated a true population mean percentage of\nLDL reduction, and there are minimal deviations of\nobservations from the mean. The appropriateness of\nusing a mean percentage of LDL reduction increases as\nthe amount of deviation from the mean decreases. The\nthird limitation is the extrapolation of sex difference\nfrom the studies. Many of the studies used in develop-\ning Table 3 are based on male-only data. We assumed\npatients in either of the 3 NCEP risk categories\nrespond with a similar LDL level lowering with the\nsame drug therapy. It is not clear if both male and\nfemale patients will have similar LDL level lowering\nwith the same drug therapy. In a recent review, Walsh\nand Grady103 noted that women have been underrepre-\nsented in clinical trials of the treatment of hyperlipid-\nemia. The authors conclude that since the natural his-\ntory of CHD differs in men and women, data from\nstudies in men should not simply be extrapolated to\nwomen. A fourth limitation is that data were extracted\nby one reviewer (K.L.B.). While this makes the extrac-\ntion process consistent, perhaps a better method\nwould be to have 2 or more reviewers extract data\nfrom each study, then compare for deviations between\nTable 2.
