It has been\nrecently reported that GD3, a b-series ganglioside, is a\nmarker molecule for identifying and isolating mouse NSCs.\nHowever, the expression of gangliosides in human NSCs is\nlargely unknown. In the present study, we analysed the\nexpression of gangliosides, GD2 and GD3, in human NSCs\nthat were isolated from human brains at gestational week\n17 in the form of neurospheres, which are floating clonal\naggregates formed by NSCs in vitro. Employing immuno-\ncytochemistry, we found that human NSCs were strongly\nreactive to anti-GD2 antibody and relatively weakly reac-\ntive to anti-GD3 antibody. Treatment of these cells with an\norganic solvent such as 100% methanol, which selectively\nremoves glycolipids from plasma membrane, abolished the\nimmunoreactivity with those antibodies, indicating that the\nreactivity was due to GD2 and GD3, but not to GD2-/GD3-\nlike glycoproteins or proteoglycans. The immunoreactivity\nof human NSCs to antibody against SSEA-1 (stage-specific\nembryonic antigen-1), a well-known carbohydrate antigen\nof NSCs, was not decreased by the treatment with 100%\nmethanol, indicating that SSEA-1 is mainly carried by\nglycoproteins and/or proteoglycans in human NSCs.

For studying their basic biological properties\nand clinical applications, it is important to characterize\nmarker molecules for identifying and isolating NSCs from\nbrain tissues. To date, a number of marker molecules have\nbeen found in NSCs, e.g., nestin, Sox2, Musashi-1, SSEA-1\n(stage-specific embryonic antigen-1; also known as Lewis x\nmore systematically and thoroughly, however, it is still\nessential to explore other cell-surface marker molecules of\nGSLs (glycosphingolipids) are lipids that contain at least\none monosaccharide residue and either a sphingoid base or a\nat least one sialic acid residue in their carbohydrate chains\nare referred to as gangliosides.

Thus, GSLs can be useful as stage-specific cell surface\n1 Correspondence may be addressed to either of these authors (email ryu@georgiahealth.edu or myanagisawa@georgiahealth.edu).\nAbbreviations: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; GSL, glycosphingolipid; LAMP-1, lysosome-associated membrane protein-1; NSC, neural stem cell; SSEA-1,\nstage-specific embryonic antigen-1.

In mouse NSCs, GD3\nganglioside is such a marker molecule.\nis a b-series disialoganglioside that is frequently expressed\nin immature proliferative cells (Seyfried and Yu, 1985). In\nrodent brains, GD3 is heavily concentrated in the subven-\ntricular zone of the lateral ventricle (Goldman et al., 1984),\nwhere adult NSCs are localized (Doetsch et al., 1999). Also,\nGD3 has been reported to be expressed in mouse\nneuroepithelial cells that are rich in NSCs (Yanagisawa\net al., 2004) and mouse radial glia, bipolar cells transiently\nappearing in the neuroepithelium and playing roles as NSCs\nat the embryonic stage (Cammer and Zhang, 1996). These\nobservations suggest the expression of GD3 in rodent NSCs.\nIn fact, we have recently provided direct evidence that GD3\nis expressed in bulk-isolated mouse embryonic, postnatal\nand adult NSCs (Nakatani et al., 2010). Interestingly, GD3+\ncells isolated from mouse brains by FACS have all the\ncharacteristics of NSCs (Nakatani et al., 2010). Our study\nclearly indicates the importance of GD3 as a biomarker of\nmouse NSCs. On the other hand, it has been reported that\nhuman NSCs were recognized by an antibody against GD2\nanother b-series disialoganglioside (Klassen et al., 2001).\nHowever, the possibility that the immunoreactivity is\nattributed to other glycoconjugates such as proteoglycans\nand glycoproteins that have the epitopic structure of GD2\ncannot be ruled out. In addition, it has not been shown\nwhether GD3 is also expressed in NSCs prepared from human\nembryonic brain. In the present study, therefore, we\nanalysed the expression of gangliosides (i.e., GD2 and GD3)\nin addition to SSEA-1 in NSCs prepared from human\nembryonic brains.\nHuman NSC culture\nNSCs isolated from human brains at gestational week 17 in\nthe form of neurospheres and stored in liquid nitrogen\n(Poetic Normal Human Neural Progenitors; catalogue no.

As shown in Figure 2(A),\nhuman NSCs were immunoreactive with anti-GD2 antibody as\nKlassen et al. (2001) have previously reported. However, there\nwas a possibility that the anti-GD2 antibody cross-reacted with\nglycoproteins or proteoglycans that have carbohydrate\nstructures similar to those of GD2 in human NSCs. It is well\nknown that lipids, including glycolipids in the plasma mem-\nbrane, are easily washed out by treatment of the cells with an\norganic solvent before immunocytochemistry (Kinoshita et al.,\n2009). To confirm that the immunoreactivity of human NSCs\nwith anti-GD2 antibody was attributed to GD2, we treated\nthese cells with 100% methanol for 10 min to wash out plas-\nma membrane lipids, including gangliosides. As shown in\nFigure 2(A), human NSCs thus treated lost completely their\nimmunoreactivity to anti-GD2 antibody. This result indicates\nthat the immunoreactivity against anti-GD2 antibody was\nattributed to GD2, but not to glycoproteins or proteoglycans\nhaving the same epitopic structure of GD2. In contrast, the\nimmunoreactivity of human NSCs to anti-SSEA-1 antibody\nwas resistant to the treatment with 100% methanol\n(Figure 2B). This clearly indicates that the SSEA-1 epitope in\nhuman NSCs is mainly carried by glycoproteins and/or\nproteoglycans, but not by glycolipid antigens. As shown in\nFigure 2(C), human NSCs were also reactive with an antibody\nagainst GD3, a predominant ganglioside in mouse NSCs\n(Nakatani et al., 2010) (Figure 2D). The immunoreactivity of\nhuman NSCs to anti-GD3 antibody was relatively weaker than\nthat to anti-GD2 antibody (results not shown). The sensitivity\nof the GD3 immunoreactivity to methanol treatment\n(Figure 2C) indicates that GD3, but not glycoproteins or\nproteoglycans having carbohydrate structures of GD3, is\nexpressed in human NSCs.\nFrom mouse NSCs and neural precursor cells, certain\ngangliosides other than GD3 such as GT1b, GQ1b, GT1aa\n[originally designated GTx (Nakamura et al., 1988); Chol-1a\nantigen] and GQ1ba (Chol-1a antigen) have been identified\nnot been biochemically detected in mouse NSCs. Then, we\nevaluated whether mouse NSCs express GD2 ganglioside as\nhuman NSCs. As shown in Figure 3, mouse NSCs were posi-\ntive for not only GD3 but also GD2. As previously reported\n(Yanagisawa et al., 2005), the GD3 immunoreactivity disap-\npeared in mouse NSCs treated with methanol (Figure 3).\nSimilarly, the GD2 immunoreactivity disappeared in mouse\nNSCs treated with methanol (Figure 3), suggesting that GD2\nimmunoreactivity in mouse NSCs is also attributed to GD2,\nbut not to glycoproteins or proteoglycans having the same\nepitopic structures of GD2. There have been results suggest-\ning that the expression of GD2 in mouse NSCs is less than the\namount required for chemical detection based on TLC\n(Nakatani et al., 2010). The finding in the previous study\nand the result in the present study establish that GD2 is\nunequivocally expressed in mouse NSCs, albeit at a lower\nconcentration.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we analysed the expression of gang-\nliosides in human NSCs. As Klassen et al. (2001) have\npreviously reported, human NSCs were reactive with antibody\nagainst GD2. In addition, these human NSCs were relatively\nweakly reactive with antibody against GD3, a predominant\nganglioside in mouse NSCs (Nakatani et al., 2010). No\nimmunoreactivity of the human NSCs to antibodies against\nGD2 and GD3 after treatment with methanol to wash out\nlipids of plasma membranes confirmed that GD2 and GD3\ngangliosides were expressed in human NSCs.\nSSEA-1, which is expressed in mouse NSCs (Klassen et al.,\nThe carbohydrate determinant of this antigen [Galb1-4\n(Fuca1-3)GlcNAcb1-] is usually carried by proteoglycans,\nFigure 3 Effect of methanol on GD2 and GD3 immunoreactivity in mouse\nembryonic NSCs\nMouse embryonic NSCs were stained with anti-GD3 antibody (green) and\nanti-GD2 antibody (green). No immunoreactivity to antibodies against GD2\nand GD3 in cells treated with 100% methanol (MeOH) for 10 min indicates\nthat the GD3 and GD2 immunoreactivity is attributed to GD3 and GD2\ngangliosides, but not to glycoproteins or proteoglycans.

The nature of the carrier molecules\nof this epitope in human NSCs, however, has not been fully\ncharacterized. The immunoreactivity of SSEA-1 in human NSCs\nwas resistant to the methanol treatment, suggesting that SSEA-1\nis mainly carried by glycoproteins and/or proteoglycans, but not\nby glycolipids. This result is consistent with the analysis of SSEA-\n1 in mouse neuroepithelial cells (Yanagisawa et al., 2005).\nRecently, LAMP-1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein-1)\nwas identified as a major SSEA-1 carrier protein in mouse NSCs\n(Yagi et al., 2010a). There is a possibility that LAMP-1 is also a\nmajor SSEA-1 carrier protein in human NSCs.\nRecently, we have reported that GD3 can be a marker\nmolecule for isolating NSCs from mouse embryonic, postnatal\nand adult brains (Nakatani et al., 2010). Also, some researchers\nhave found that GD2 is useful as a marker molecule for\nisolating mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent stromal cells\nthat can differentiate into cells of the mesodermal lineage\nsuch as myocytes, osteocytes, adipocytes and chondrocytes,\nfrom human bone marrow (Martinez et al., 2007) and umbilical\nis anticipated that GD2 and GD3 confirmed to be expressed in\nhuman NSCs in the present study also can be marker molecules\navailable for identifying and isolating NSCs in human brains\nespecially in adulthood; in adult human brains, GM1, GD1a,\nGD1b and GT1b, but not GD2 and GD3, are predominantly\nexpressed (Svennerholm, 1963). Further systematic studies of\ngangliosides in human NSCs should be important for the\nprogress of stem cell biology.\n"
