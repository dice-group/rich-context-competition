This ratio is calculated by dividing\nregulatorily specified liquid assets that are available within one month by short-term payment\nobligations that are callable within this period. Savings banks have almost three times as many\nliquid assets available for their payment obligations than the regulator requires. This paper\ninvestigates whether sight deposits, which are not only factored into the payment obligations at\n10% but which are also an important funding source for savings banks, contribute to liquid asset\nholdings in excess of the regulatory requirements.\nWe investigate two effects which may induce savings banks to hold more liquid assets for each\nunit of sight deposits than is regulatorily required with the result that they would not transform\nsight deposits into illiquid assets as intensively as the regulator permits. The first effect, which\nwe will call the underestimation effect, occurs when the regulator underestimates the likelihood\nof deposit withdrawals and when liquidity shortages are expensive. The second effect, which we\nwill call the lending effect, occurs when savings banks are subject to limits in their lending to\nnon-banks which they do not offset through investments in other illiquid assets, such as\nmedium-term interbank lending and/or securities held to maturity.\nOn the basis of bank reports for 2000-2006 and taking into account that banks determine their\nassets and payment obligations simultaneously, we find that savings banks hold far more\nregulatory liquid assets for each unit of sight deposits than are regulatorily required. Our\nfindings produce no evidence of the underestimation effect: The regulatorily specified\nwithdrawal rate of sight deposits of 10% can be considered as a conservative measure for actual\ndeposit withdrawal rates in our sample. Our findings suggest, however, that a lending effect is at\nwork: Savings banks with low lending to non-banks transform sight deposits less intensively in\nilliquid assets than savings banks with high non-bank lending. This finding suggests that it is\nunprofitable for savings banks with low non-bank lending to achieve the same degree of\ntransformation as their counterparts engaged in high non-bank lending. Principally, savings\nbanks with low lending to non-banks could achieve a similar degree of transformation by\ngranting medium-term interbank loans and/or holding securities to maturity.\nWhile our analysis is primarily focused on how regulatory liquid assets depend upon sight\ndeposits, it also provides information on how these assets vary according to bank size and the\nindividual bank's position in the interbank market, both of which we find to be inversely related\nto liquid assets. Overall, our results indicate that there is no single factor determining the\namount of regulatory liquid assets. Instead, regulatory liquid assets are determined by a\nmultiplicity of factors, some of which should be the subject of further research.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nDie in Deutschland geltende Liquidit\u00e4tsverordnung (ehemals Grundsatz II) fordert die\nmonatliche Meldung einer Liquidit\u00e4tskennzahl, die mindestens eins betragen muss. Diese\nKennzahl ergibt sich aus dem Verh\u00e4ltnis der innerhalb des n\u00e4chsten Monats verf\u00fcgbaren\nZahlungsmittel einer Bank und ihren in diesem Zeitraum abrufbaren Zahlungsverpflichtungen.\nSparkassen verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber fast dreimal so viel Zahlungsmittel, wie sie f\u00fcr ihre Zahlungs-\nverpflichtungen laut der Liquidit\u00e4tsverordnung halten m\u00fcssen. Die vorliegende Forschungs-\narbeit untersucht, ob Sichteinlagen, die mit 10% in die abrufbaren Zahlungsverpflichtungen\neingehen, und eine wesentliche Finanzierungsquelle f\u00fcr Sparkassen darstellen, zu dem hohen\nBestand an Zahlungsmitteln beitragen.\nDiese Arbeit untersucht zwei Effekte, die Sparkassen dazu bringen k\u00f6nnen, mehr Zahlungs-\nmittel pro Einheit Sichteinlage zu halten als regulatorisch gefordert, so dass Sichteinlagen\nweniger zur Finanzierung von illiquiden Aktiva verwendet werden als die\nLiquidit\u00e4tsregulierung erlaubt. Der erste Effekt, den wir als Untersch\u00e4tzungseffekt bezeichnen,\ntritt auf, wenn die regulatorisch spezifizierte Marke der Einlagenabz\u00fcge die tats\u00e4chlichen\nAbz\u00fcge untersch\u00e4tzt. Der zweite Effekt, den wir als Krediteffekt bezeichnen, tritt auf, wenn\nSparkassen Grenzen bei der Kreditvergabe an Nichtbanken ausgesetzt sind, die sie nicht durch\nInvestitionen in andere illiquide Aktiva, z.B. mittelfristige Interbankkredite und im Anlagebuch\nbilanzierte Wertpapiere, kompensieren.\nber\u00fccksichtigt, dass Banken ihre Aktiva und Zahlungsverpflichtungen gleichzeitig festlegen.\nDie Ergebnisse belegen, dass Sparkassen f\u00fcr jede Einheit an Sichteinlagen \u00fcber wesentlich mehr\nZahlungsmittel verf\u00fcgen als gem\u00e4\u00df der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Liquidit\u00e4tsregulierung erforderlich w\u00e4re.\nWir finden keine Evidenz f\u00fcr einen Untersch\u00e4tzungseffekt: der Vergleich der tats\u00e4chlichen\nEinlagenabz\u00fcge mit der regulatorisch spezifizierten Marke von 10 % deutet an, dass die\nregulatorische Marke in dem von uns verwendeten Datensatz als konservativ zu bezeichnen ist.\nWir finden jedoch Hinweise auf das Wirken eines Krediteffekts: Sparkassen mit wenigen\nKrediten an Nichtbanken transformieren Sichteinlagen weniger intensiv in illiquide Aktiva als\nSparkassen mit vielen Nichtbankkrediten. Generell k\u00f6nnten jedoch auch Sparkassen mit\nwenigen Krediten an Nichtbanken einen \u00e4hnlichen Transformationsgrad erzielen, in dem sie\nz.B. mittelfristige Interbankkredite vergeben oder im Anlagebuch bilanzierte Wertpapiere\nhalten. Dies scheint jedoch f\u00fcr sie nicht profitabel zu sein.\nAuch wenn der Fokus unserer Arbeit auf der Rolle von Sichteinlagen liegt, gibt sie zudem\nwertvolle Hinweise, welche anderen bankspezifischen Faktoren das Halten von Zahlungsmitteln\nbeeinflusst. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass gro\u00dfe Sparkassen bzw. Sparkassen mit vielen\nInterbankverbindungen weniger Zahlungsmittel halten als kleine Sparkassen bzw. Sparkassen\nmit wenigen Verbindungen. Die H\u00f6he der Zahlungsmittel l\u00e4sst sich somit nicht durch einen\neinzelnen Faktor, sondern vielmehr durch eine Vielzahl bankspezifischer Faktoren erkl\u00e4ren, von\ndenen einige Untersuchungsgegenstand k\u00fcnftiger Forschungsarbeiten darstellen sollten.\nContents\nList of Tables\nList of Figures\n1 Introduction\nIn Germany, the Regulation on the Liquidity of Institutions (Liquidit\u00e4tsverordnung) and its\npredecessor Principle II (Grundsatz II) require banks to have regulatorily specified liquid assets\nat least equal to their regulatorily specified short-term payment obligations. Table 1 shows that\nsavings banks have, unlike big banks and state banks, almost three times as much liquid assets\nfor their payment obligations than the regulator requires. This paper investigates whether sight\ndeposits, which are not only factored into the payment obligations with 10% but which are also\nan important funding source for savings banks but less so for big banks (Memmel and Schertler\n2008), contribute to the high amounts of savings banks' liquid assets. They do so when\ntransforming sight deposits into illiquid assets at the degree permitted by the liquidity regulation\nis unprofitable for savings banks. The regulator permits banks with sufficient repayments from\nloans to use all their sight deposits to finance illiquid assets, since regulatory liquid assets also\ncontain repayments from loans and advances maturing within the next month.\nWe investigate two effects that may induce savings banks to hold more liquid assets for each\nunit of sight deposits than regulatorily required so that they would not transform sight deposits\ninto illiquid assets as intensively as the regulator permits. The first effect, which we call the\nunderestimation effect, occurs if the regulator underestimates the likelihood of deposit\nwithdrawals and when liquidity shortages are expensive. The second effect, which we call the\nlending effect, occurs when savings banks have limits in non-bank lending which they do not\noffset through investments in other illiquid assets, such as medium-term interbank lending\nand/or investments in fixed assets. Disentangling these two effects is important because both\neffects can induce savings banks to use sight deposits less intensively to finance illiquid assets\nthan allowed and because they require different responses by the regulator. If the first effect is at\nwork, the regulator may want to re-specify regulatory weights to capture potential deposit\nwithdrawals adequately, while if the latter effect is at work, there is currently no necessity to\nchange the weighting of sight deposits used by the liquidity regulation.\nLooking at bank reports of German savings banks for 2000-2006, we find evidence that a higher\namount of sight deposits is associated with much more liquid assets holdings than the regulator\nrequires, while a higher amount of other short-term payment obligations is associated with an\namount of liquid assets holdings closer to the one required by the regulator. To investigate\nwhether the regulation underestimates deposit withdrawals, we look at historical changes in\nsight deposits. Our findings suggest the liquidity regulation captures actual deposit withdrawals\nquite adequately in our sample. Thus, the withdrawal rate of sight deposits specified in the\nliquidity regulation can be considered as conservative and does, therefore, not explain why\nsavings banks hold much more liquid assets than the regulator requires. To investigate whether\nthe lending effect force savings banks to hold more sight deposits in liquid assets than required,\nwe test whether savings banks with high shares of loans to non-banks use sight deposits more\nintensively to finance illiquid assets than savings banks with low shares of loans to non-banks.\nUsing an interaction term within a dynamic panel data approach and controlling for non-bank\nlending and the deposit-liability ratio, we find liquid assets depend negatively on the interaction\nbetween non-bank lending and sight deposits. This finding suggests that it is not profitable for\nsavings banks with low lending to non-banks to transform sight deposits into other illiquid\nassets such as medium-term interbank lending or securities stated as fixed financial assets. It\nmay imply that it is more profitable for savings banks with low non-bank lending to hold liquid\nassets than to grant medium-term interbank loans or to hold securities to maturity to use the\nadvantages of financial reporting (i.e., gemilderte Niederstwertvorschrift).\nOur paper expands the recent literature on banks' liquidity, which has, broadly speaking,\nfocused on reserve requirements (Bartolini et al. 2001, Jallath-Coria et al. 2002), securities\nholdings and cash balances (Aspachs et al. 2005, Freedman and Click 2006), and the creation of\nliquidity (Berger and Bouwman 2006), i.e., transforming short-term liabilities into illiquid\nassets, but not on regulatory liquidity requirements.1 In our paper, we consider insights gained\nin this literature, such as the role of the interbank market: if banks' liquidity shocks are\nimperfectly correlated, banks can protect themselves against liquidity shortages by being active\nin the interbank market (Rochet and Tirole 1996). Therefore, we control for savings banks'\nactivity in the interbank market. Other insights, such as the role of central banks as a lender of\nal. 2006), are not particularly relevant for our paper, since we focus on savings banks that are\norganized in a liquidity network.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the\ncurrent and past prudential regulatory framework for liquidity in Germany. In Section 3, we\npresent predictions on the relationship between regulatory liquid assets and sight deposits. In\nSection 4, we describe the dataset and Section 5 presents our estimation methodology and\nfindings. Section 6 summarizes our main findings and suggests topics for future research.\n1 Recent literature dealing with the liquidity regulation is primarily descriptive. For example,\nMoch and Sch\u00f6ning (2008) provide some evidence that savings banks use Principle II (in addition to\nother methods) to monitor their liquidity positions.\n2 Prudential Liquidity Regulation in Germany\nRevisions in liquidity regulation\nIn recent years, the German liquidity regulation for banks has undergone several revisions.\nBanks' liquidity requirements are specified in Section 11 of the Banking Act, which state that\nbanks \"must invest their funds in such a way as to ensure that adequate liquidity for payment\nAct has been made concrete by the Regulation on the Liquidity of Institutions\nBanking Act was made concrete by Principle II (Grundsatz II), while before 2000 it was made\nconcrete by the original Principle II and Principle III (Grundsatz II and III).\nThe Regulation on the Liquidity of Institutions encompasses Principle II by requiring banks to\ncalculate and to report liquidity ratios (Standardized Approach, stated in Sections 2-7), but\nexpands on Principle II by allowing banks to use their own liquidity models (Section 10) that\nhave to be approved by the regulator. Thus, for those banks not opting to use their own liquidity\nmodel, the requirements of the liquidity regulation \u00ad apart from some smaller changes \u00ad did not\nThe Regulation on the Liquidity of Institutions, as did Principle II, does not only require the\ncalculation of regulatory liquidity ratios (RLRs) but also three observation ratios on the basis of\ninstitutions, not groups of credit institutions (FBSO 1998a). All of these ratios are to be reported\nat the end of each month. The RLR is the quotient of assets available within the next month and\npayment obligations callable within the next month (FBSO 1998a). The liquidity of a bank is\ndeemed as adequate if the RLR is at least one. The observation ratios are calculated for three\ndifferent time bands: from one to three months, from three to six months, and from six to twelve\nmonths. The purpose of these ratios is to provide information on possible refunding problems;\nthese ratios do not need to be greater than one. Excess liquidity in one time band can\ncompensate for a liquidity shortage in the next higher time band.\nPrinciple II was intended to adapt the German regulatory structure to international standards by\ntaking into account not only the style of EU liquidity schemes but also recent developments in\ncredit institutions' business environment (FBSO 1998a). Therefore, Principle II differed from\nthe original Principle II and Principle III in several respects. First, it was built on the proposition\nthat a solvent and profitable bank should face no obstacles in ensuring medium- and long-term\nrefunding (Deutsche Bundesbank 1999, p. 29). In the short run, however, solvent and profitable\ninstitutions may face the risk of liquidity shortages (FBSO 1998). It focuses, therefore, on\nwithdrawal risks of liabilities and refunding risks in the short run (Sch\u00f6ning 2004a, Sp\u00f6rk and\nAuge-Dickhut 1999). The original Principle II and Principle III, in contrast, focused on the\nmiddle and long-term liquidity needs of banks and put emphasis on refunding risks resulting\nfrom banks' maturity transformation (Hartmann-Wendels and Wendels 1999, Sp\u00f6rk and Auge-\nDickhut 1999). In so doing, they expanded on (i) the golden banking rule by specifying that\nlong-term (medium-term) assets were to be financed by long-term (medium-term) liabilities, (ii)\nthe deposit base theory by assuming that callable deposits were not withdrawn at once, but were\navailable to the banks for a longer period, and (iii) the shiftability theory by specifying that\nparticular asset types did not need to be funded by liabilities with the same maturity (Sch\u00f6ning\n2004a). A third source of liquidity risk, the time risk, was not captured by Principle II and the\noriginal Principle II and III (Grelck and Rode 1999). Second, Principle II was based on residual\nmaturities, while the original Principle II and III were founded on original maturities.2 Third,\nPrinciple II allowed market values to be taken into consideration for particular liquid assets,\nwhile the original Principles II and III were based on book values only. The information content\nof the regulatory liquidity and observation ratios can be improved when market values instead\nof book values are used (Sp\u00f6rk and Auge-Dickhut 1999). Thus, Principle II combined a\nmaturity-mismatch approach (since residual maturities of liquid assets and payment obligations\nare used when calculating regulatory liquidity and observation ratios) with a stock-market\napproach (since securities traded on a regular stock market are classified as highly liquid assets)\nMain positions in savings banks' RLRs\nWhile the liquidity regulation requires many liquid assets and short-term payment obligations to\nenter the RLR (see Table 2 for a detailed overview), there are only few main positions in\nsavings banks' liquid assets and payment obligations. The liquidity regulation considers several\non-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet liquid assets and payment obligations. For\nexample, regulatory liquid assets comprise debt and equity securities not stated as financial\nfixed assets that are admitted for trading on a regular market, repayment from loans maturing\nwithin the next month, as well as irrevocable lending commitments received by credit\ninstitutions. Regulatory short-term payment obligations comprise a regulatorily specified\npercentage of liabilities that are either due on demand or mature within the next month as well\nas payment obligations in the form of placement and underwriting commitments or undrawn\nirrevocable credit facilities. To gain insights into their relative importance, Table 3 presents the\nmost relevant regulatory liquid assets and short-term payment obligations as a percentage of the\n2 An amendment to Section 39 (4) of the Regulation on the Accounting of Banks and Financial\nServices Institutions (Verordnung \u00fcber die Rechnungslegung der Kreditinstitute, RechKredV) requires\nthat banks' post-1998 balance sheets have to be based on residual maturities, whereas previously they\nwere based on original maturities. Section 7 of Principle II defines residual maturities as the time between\nthe reporting day and the respective due date.\nnumerator and denominator of the RLR. All the assets and obligations listed in Table 2 but not\nin Table 3 play a minor role for savings banks.\nThe most relevant regulatory liquid assets are debt securities (33%), followed by securities\nlisted in a regular market (16%), shares in money market and securities funds (16%), and loans\nmaturing within the next month to customers (16%) and credit institutions (11%). Off-balance\nsheet positions, such as irrevocable lending commitments received by credit institutions, are not\nvery important for regulatory liquid assets. The regulatory liquid assets selected account for\nalmost 95% of the numerator of the RLR.\nThe most relevant short-term payment obligations entering into the denominator of the RLR are\ncustomer liabilities maturing within the next month (37%), savings deposits (28%), customer\nliabilities that are due on demand (15%), and liabilities to credit institutions that will mature\nwithin the next month (5%). Thus, the denominator of the RLR is dominated by customer\nliabilities \u00ad which is, as we are looking at savings banks, not much of a surprise. Off-balance\nsheet positions are not very important for short-term payment obligations. The regulatory short-\nterm payment obligations selected account for about 92% of the denominator of the RLR.\n3 Predictions\nPredictions are gained from the literature focusing on reserve requirements since these\nrequirements are, from an economic point of view, comparable to regulatory liquidity\nrequirements (for models dealing with reserve requirements, see Freixas and Rochet (1997),\nchapter 8, Baltensperger and Milde (1987), chapter 2). As in the case of reserve requirements,\nwe can think of prudential regulatory liquidity requirements as an additional constraint in a\nbank's profit maximization problem (in addition to the internal liquidity constraint). The\nliquidity regulation requires banks to fulfill the following constraint:\n= +    +\nwhere LAT denotes regulatory liquid assets, LBS denotes regulatory sight deposits (i.e., 10% of\nthe sight deposits at the bank's disposal), and LBO denotes the amount of other regulatory short-\nterm payment obligations (including, e.g., 10% of its savings deposits and 100% of its customer\nliabilities maturing within the next month).\nWhen the liquidity regulation introduces a binding constraint, i.e., RLR=1, we expect banks will\nhold one unit of regulatory liquid assets for each unit of regulatory short-term payment\nobligations. This unit of regulatory liquid assets can be in the form of either securities holdings\nor repayments from loans maturing within the next month. If the repayments from loans\nmaturing within the next month are sufficiently high to meet the regulatory liquidity constraint,\nthe regulator permits banks to use as much as 100% of the sight deposits at their disposal to\ngrant illiquid loans to non-banks or credit institutions and/or to invest in securities stated as\nfinancial fixed assets (both of which are not factored in the numerator of the RLR).\nThe regulator intervenes when the bank fails to meet the requirements specified by the liquidity\nregulation.3 This is not in the interest of the bank managers, since they either loose control of\ntheir banking operations or are restricted in conducting them. The bank can reduce the\nprobability of a regulatory intervention by having regulatory liquid assets for each unit of short-\nterm payment obligations in excess of regulatory requirements. Thus, the danger of a regulatory\nintervention may induce the bank to build up and to keep a liquidity buffer. Then equation (1)\nchanges to:\n( ) with 1.\n \n= + >\nLA LB LB (2)\nWe bring forward two effects, both of which can induce savings banks to hold an amount of\nliquid assets per unit of sight deposits that exceeds the one per unit of other short-term payment\nobligations. The first effect, which we call the underestimation effect, exists when the liquidity\nregulation underestimates actual deposit withdrawals, while the second effect, which we call the\nlending effect, exists when savings banks with low non-bank lending hold more liquid assets\nthan savings banks with high lending to non-banks. Disentangling these two effects is essential,\nbecause the regulator may want to change the weighting in the liquidity regulation only if it\ncurrently underestimates actual withdrawal rates.\nAs to the underestimation effect, the bank will hold excess regulatory liquid assets for each unit\nof sight deposits when the liquidity regulation underestimates deposit withdrawals and when\nliquidity shortages are expensive. The liquidity regulation underestimates deposit withdrawals,\nwhen the actual deposit withdrawal rate,  W\nm\nD , exceeds the monthly sight deposit withdrawal\nrate of 10% specified in the liquidity regulation. Such underestimated deposit withdrawals\ninduce savings banks to hold more sight deposits in securities and cash balances than\nregulatorily required, if the price per unit of the liquidity shortage exceeds the price for sight\ndeposits.\nBanks that mainly store liquidity (Saunders and Cornett 2006) are not only interested in\nmonthly deposit withdrawal rates, they also care about the correlation of deposit withdrawals\nover time. To sketch the implications on liquid assets of a bank being hit by deposit withdrawals\nin several subsequent months, we assume the bank, which has only sight deposits and equity at\nits disposal, initially has an RLR of 2 and is hit, ceteris paribus, in all subsequent months by\ndeposit withdrawals amounting to either 2% or 10%. When the bank is only hit by a 2% deposit\n3 The regulator does not necessarily intervene if the bank fails to meet the regulatory requirements\nin a single month. If, however, liquidity problems are somewhat persistent, the regulator will intervene.\nwithdrawal in all subsequent months, the bank meets the regulatory liquidity requirement in all\nup to the sixth month. However, when the bank is hit by a 10% deposit withdrawal in each\nperiod, it meets the regulatory liquidity requirement in the first but not in the second month.\nThus, when the bank mainly stores liquidity and when it expects deposit withdrawals in\nsubsequent months,  W\ns\nD , that exceed the regulatory withdrawal rate, it holds, on average,\nmore liquid assets than a bank that expects deposit withdrawals not to be correlated over time.\nIn this case, the regulatory constraint will force banks to hold excess liquidity even if the\nobserved average RLR does not indicate that it is binding. This brings us to our first prediction.\nPrediction 1: How intensively sight deposits are used to finance illiquid assets depends upon\nbanks' deposit withdrawal rates. Banks with higher deposit withdrawal rates in\na single month or within subsequent months than assumed by the regulator, i.e.,\n >  >\nm s\nD D hold more regulatory liquid assets for each unit of\nsight deposits than their respective counterparts.\nAs to the lending effect, the degree to which the bank transforms sight deposits into illiquid\nassets may depend upon its lending to non-banks, L. At first sight, one might argue that a higher\nlending to non-banks will be negatively correlated with liquid assets since a bank with low non-\nbank lending will naturally opt for more liquid asset holdings, which leads to regulatory liquid\nassets in excess to the regulatory requirements. But a bank with low non-bank lending can\nrealize the same degree of transforming sight deposits into illiquid assets than a bank with high\namounts of non-bank lending when it invests more into securities not stated as fixed financial\nassets and/or when it grants loans to other credit institutions with an initial maturity of more\nthan 1 month. Both, interbank lending with an initial maturity of more than 1 month and\nsecurities stated as financial fixed assets are not regulatorily specified as liquid assets.\nTo identify whether such an effect is at work, we measure the relationship between liquid assets\nand sight deposits for those banks with high lending to non-banks and those banks with low\nnon-bank lending separately. For all banks, we expect the amount of liquid assets held for each\nunit of sight deposits, 1\n\nS\n, will be strictly larger than one, while for those banks with high non-\nbank lending, we expect that they will use sight deposits more intensively to grant illiquid loans,\nso that they have fewer liquid assets for each unit of sight deposits, i.e., 2\n <\nS\n. Our second\nprediction summarizes the effects of lending to non-banks on regulatory liquid assets.\nPrediction 2: How intensively sight deposits are used to finance illiquid assets depends upon\nbanks' lending to non-banks. Banks with high non-bank lending, DL=1, hold\nfewer regulatory liquid assets for each unit of sight deposits than banks with\nlow non-bank lending, DL=0:\n    \n    \n= + +   +   + \n< < <  <\n4 The Data\nRegulatory liquid assets and short-term payment obligations\nWe analyze the regulatory reporting data on savings banks' liquidity for the period 2000-2006.\nWe focus on savings banks for two reasons. First, to perform a dynamic panel data analysis, we\nneed a sample of banks that are relatively homogenous and whose number is sufficiently large.\nSavings banks are relatively homogenous with respect to their business model for granting loans\nand raising funds and they are a large group of banks. Second, the Regulation on the Liquidity\nof Institutions encompasses Principle II by requiring banks to report RLRs but it extends\nPrinciple II by allowing banks to use own liquidity models to calculate and report on their\nliquidity. While we expect large banks with complex business models will start using their own\nmodels, we expect smaller banks \u00ad such as savings banks \u00ad to continue to report RLRs.\nTherefore, we expect that a study built on data originated by Principle II, such as ours, will\nprovide information on transforming sight deposits into illiquid assets that will be observed\nunder the Regulation on the Liquidity of Institutions.\nOur measures of regulatory liquid assets and short-term payment obligations are based on\nDecember reports under Principle II. We use the following three measures for regulatory liquid\nassets: (i) total regulatory liquid assets, LAT, (ii) debt and equity securities holdings, LAS, and\n(iii) cash balances, LAC. These three measures allow us to identify whether savings banks have\nexcess total regulatory liquid assets for their regulatory short-term payment obligations, which\nwould imply they hold liquidity buffers, and whether they have securities holdings and cash\nbalances for each unit of sight deposits in excess to regulatory requirements. Since all these\nmeasures are size-sensitive, we scale them as a percentage of total assets. Table 4 shows that, on\naverage, regulatory liquid assets account for approximately 36% of total assets, debt and equity\nsecurities for 24% and cash balances for about 2.3%.\nFor regulatory short-term payment obligations, we use the following measures: (i) total\nregulatory short-term payment obligations, LBT, (ii) regulatory sight deposits of non-banks, LBS,\n(iii) and other regulatory short-term payment obligations, LBO. All measures for regulatory\nshort-term payment obligations used in our empirical analysis are the regulatory amounts\nrelative to total liabilities (in percent), i.e., regulatory sight deposits, LBS, are calculated as\n(0.1\u00d7sight deposits)/(total assets). Total regulatory short-term payment obligations account for\nmore than 13% of bank assets; the minimum is as low as 5% and the maximum is as high as\n29%. Regulatory sight deposits account for 1.9% of savings banks' total assets (i.e., 19% of\nsavings banks' total assets), on average; the minimum is as low as 0.7%, while the maximum is\nbelow 4%. Other regulatory short-term payment obligations account for more than 11%, on\naverage, ranging from 2% to more than 27%.\nControls\nOur control variables, which we introduce in the following, capture bank-specific characteristics\nand the macroeconomic environment.\nConcerning bank-specific characteristics, we control for the ratio of loans to non-banks relative\nto total assets, L, and the annual growth in loans to non-banks, L. On average, as Table 4\nshows, savings banks use almost 60% of their assets to grant loans to non-banks. However, this\nnumber varies from as low as 12% to almost 90%. The stock of loans to non-banks grows on\naverage by 1% per year.\nWe control for bank size, SIZE, measured by the logarithm of a bank's total assets, because we\nexpect it to be correlated with using sophisticated liquidity management techniques which\nimpact on liquid assets. In particular, large banks are more likely to use sophisticated techniques\nof managing liquidity risk than small banks because the costs of implementing such a technique\nmight be independent of bank size, while the benefits certainly do. Banks that use sophisticated\nliquidity techniques likely hold smaller volumes of liquid assets. In addition, bank size may be\ncorrelated with using purchasing liquidity techniques, since using such a technique may have\nfixed-cost character.\nFinding a more precise measure than size for capturing whether savings banks employ\npurchased liquidity techniques is difficult, since savings banks are part of liquidity networks\nthat they use to manage their liquidity when monetary policy conditions change (Ehrmann and\nWorms 2004). Thus, per se, all savings banks have access to purchased liquidity. However, we\nexpect the positions of savings banks within the liquidity network in terms of price and quantity\nconditions to differ and therefore we count the number of connections the bank has as a\nborrower in the interbank market. The number of these interbank connections is greater than one\nbecause the formerly strong single relationship between savings banks and their head\ninstitutions has become much weaker in the past few years so that head institutions in northern\nGermany also offering liquidity to savings banks in southern Germany. We expect the number\nof interbank connections relative to total assets, IB, to be negatively related to liquid assets.\nSuch a negative relationship arises when interbank connections are negatively related to the\nconditions of purchasing liquidity. However, a negative relationship can also arise when some\nbanks faced a strong loan demand in the past, which forced them to shift liquid assets into\nilliquid loans first (as much as the regulator permits) and afterwards to raise additional funding.\nIn either case, we expect a bank with many interbank connections will hold fewer liquid assets.\nMoreover, we control for the interest margin, IM, which measures the banks' opportunity costs\nof holding liquid assets in terms of forgone higher returns from loans (Aspachs et al. 2005).\nTherefore, we expect the interest margin will affect regulatory liquid assets negatively.\nConcerning the macroeconomic environment, we control for the change in the short-term\ninterest rate, i, and the real GDP growth rate, GDP. Because an increase in short-term interest\nrates increases the opportunity costs of holding cash, we expect regulatory liquid assets will\nchange from being cash balances towards being securities holdings. An increase in GDP growth\nlikely coincides with an increase in the loan demand. Therefore, we expect savings banks will\nreduce their securities holdings. The effect on total regulatory liquid assets is undetermined,\nsince securities holdings may decrease, while repayments from loans and advances maturing\nwithin the next month may increase if the economy expands (since companies' failure rates go\ndown). Additionally, we include year dummies to further control for time-fixed effects.\n5 Underestimated Deposit Withdrawals or Limits in Non-\nBank Lending?\n5.1 Underestimated Deposit Withdrawals\nAccording to our first prediction, savings banks may hold more regulatory liquid assets than\nregulatory required because the liquidity regulation underestimates the likelihood of sight\ndeposit withdrawals. To identify whether this underestimation effect is at work requires\nidentifying those banks with higher withdrawal rates than regulatorily specified. Figure 1 plots\nthe changes in sight deposits calculated from monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual stocks\nof sight deposits since savings banks may not only care about deposit withdrawals within one\nmonth but within subsequent months. The left upper plot in Figure 1 suggests a relatively low\nlikelihood of experiencing a monthly change in sight deposits above the regulatory value of\n10%. In addition, the other three plots for quarterly, semi-annual, and annual changes in sight\ndeposits do not indicate negative changes that would add up to more than 10% of initial sight\ndeposits in subsequent months. These changes differ from the one which the regulator specifies,\nsince the changes presented in Figure 1 are not controlled for growing sight deposit bases.\nHowever, even if we control for growing sight deposits bases, the distributions of sight deposit\nwithdrawals do not change substantially.\nAs Figure 1 suggests, the historical changes in sight deposits seldom exceed the weight for\ndeposit withdrawals specified by the regulator during our sample period. Thus, the regulatory\nvalue for expected deposit withdrawals of 10% can be regarded as a conservative value. The\ndeposit withdrawal rates depicted in Figure 1 imply that we cannot classify a group of savings\nbanks that experience higher than regulatorily specified deposit withdrawals. Therefore, we\ntentatively conclude that underestimating actual withdrawal rates cannot explain why savings\nbanks hold more regulatory liquid assets for their payment obligations than required.\nHowever, we have two cautionary notes on this strict interpretation of our findings. First,\nsavings banks may be risk-averse and they may not decide on the basis of historical withdrawal\nrates but rather may take into account that all sight deposits can be withdrawn at once. Second,\nthe stock of sight deposits reported at the end of each month (which we used in Figure 1) can be\nsubstantially higher than if it was averaged over each month. If wages and salaries are mainly\npaid at the end of the month, savings banks will store part of the sight deposits in liquid assets\nthat they can easy transform into cash to be prepared for deposit withdrawals. Of course, a\ndeposit withdrawal from a customer's perspective does not have to coincide with a deposit\nwithdrawal from the bank's perspective since money often changes from one account to another\nand since withdrawn sight deposits are compensated for by other sight or savings deposit\ninflows. Nevertheless, we do not know how intensively sight deposits fluctuate between the two\npoints in time at which banks report their liquidity to the regulator.\n5.2 Limits in Non-Bank Lending\nAccording to our second prediction, savings banks may hold more regulatory liquid assets than\nregulatory required because it is unprofitable for them to offset limits in their lending to non-\nbanks by investing in other illiquid assets, such as medium-term interbank lending. To test\nwhether such an effect is at work, we interact a dummy variable, DL, which is equal to one if the\nsavings bank has a high ratio of loans to non-banks relative to total assets and zero otherwise,\nwith the variables capturing short-term payment obligations. The interaction terms are\npotentially endogenous and we, therefore, instrument them by using past values. To yield\nappropriate instruments for these potentially endogenous interaction variables, we employ a\ntime-invariant dummy variable.\nThe econometric models\nThe baseline econometric models that we use to test our second prediction takes into account\ndynamic changes in liquidity by including a lag of the dependent variable in the list of the RHS\nvariables. The baseline models have the following form:\n, ,\nlog( )\n{ , , }\n    \n     \n- -\n= =\n- -\n= + +  + +  +\n+ + +  +  + +\n\n\u00a6 \u00a6\nj L j\ni t i t j i t j i i t i t i t\nj S O j S O\ni t i t i t t t i t\ny y LB D LB L L\nSIZE IB IM i GDP Time Dummies\nwith y LA LA LA\nwhere yi,t\ndenotes the dependent variable of interest for bank i at time t. We assume i,t\n=i\n+i,t\n,\nwhere i\nis a bank-specific fixed effect and i,t\nis a disturbance term.\nOur baseline models include only those bank-specific characteristics that we discussed in\nSection 4, some of which are correlated as Table 5 shows. For example, interbank connections\nare correlated with bank size. In our baseline models, we consider only those variables that are\nnot sensitive to alternative specifications. Thus, the effects of interbank connections and bank\nsize on liquid assets do not depend on whether or not these variables are included jointly in the\nmodels. In extensions of these baseline models, presented below, we introduce further bank-\nspecific characteristics, such as bank capital, and discuss their effects on regulatory liquid\nassets.\nTo estimate the baseline and extension models, we take into account that some RHS variables\nare endogenous; some variables have even been used as dependent variables in other empirical\nstudies. For example, the growth in loan stocks is analyzed by Kashyap and Stein (2000),\nBank capital and its interdependency with risk-weighted assets is analyzed by Shrieves and\net al. (2004). To minimize endogeneity problems, we use lagged variables whenever the\nvariable under focus is related to one point in time only, i.e., we use the lagged ratio of loans to\nnon-banks relative to total assets, interbank connections, and capital, while we instrument those\nvariables that are calculated from two points in time, i.e., loan growth.\nWe estimate all following models by using the dynamic panel data estimator (which is a\ngeneralized method of moments estimator) proposed by Blundell and Bond (1998) and a finite\nsample correction proposed by Windmeijer (2005). Estimation results will be consistent if we\nuse appropriate instruments for the lag of the dependent variable and RHS variables, and if there\nis no higher-order autocorrelation. We vary instruments in a systematic way and use a test for\noveridentifying restrictions to select the models presented in Table 6 (Arellano and Bond 1991,\nBlundell and Bond 1998). Since we estimate a dynamic model, each variable has both first-\nround and second-round effects. For example, an increase in the ratio of loans to non-banks\nrelative to total assets in t impacts liquid assets in t, which in turn impacts liquid assets in t+1.\nTherefore, we also report the long-run coefficients.\nResults of the baseline models\nWe present estimation results of the baseline models for the three measures of liquid assets in\nThe interaction terms between the dummy variable equal to one for those savings banks with\nhigh lending to non-banks and the two types of short-term payment obligations shed light on the\nrelevance of our second prediction. We estimate each interaction term in a separate equation\nbecause the two terms are highly correlated. The interaction term of sight deposits impacts\nsignificantly negatively on total regulatory liquid assets (column 1), suggesting that savings\nbanks with high non-bank lending use a greater amount of sight deposits to finance illiquid\nassets than banks with low non-bank lending. In the long-run, in which second-round effects are\ntaken into account, regulatory liquid assets held for each unit of sight deposits are 1.3 units\nlower for savings banks with high non-bank lending than for banks with low non-bank lending.\nSince total regulatory liquid assets comprise repayments from loans and advances maturing\nwithin the next month, the results for total regulatory liquid assets do not provide information\non whether savings banks actually store more sight deposits in liquid assets than regulatory\nrequired. Therefore, we report results for securities holdings and cash balances. For each unit of\nregulatory sight deposits, savings banks with high non-bank lending store 1.8 units less in\nsecurities than savings banks with low non-bank lending (column 2), while the interaction term\nfor cash balances is insignificant (column 3). The interaction terms of other regulatory short-\nterm payment obligations are insignificant throughout (columns 4-6). These findings support\nour second prediction: savings banks do not transform sight deposits into illiquid assets to the\ndegree permitted by the regulator because they face limits in their lending to non-banks which\nthey do not offset by investing in other illiquid assets.\nOur findings also indicate that savings banks with low and high non-bank lending hold\nsignificantly more regulatory liquid assets per unit of sight deposits than required by the\nregulator. For savings banks with low non-bank lending, one unit of regulatory sight deposits is\nassociated with 5.69 units of regulatory liquid assets in the long-run. For savings banks with\nhigh non-bank lending, one unit of regulatory sight deposits is associated with 4.38 (=5.69-1.31)\nunits of regulatory liquid assets in the long-run. Thus, even savings banks with high non-bank\nlending do not transform sight deposits into illiquid assets to the extent permitted by the\nliquidity regulation. This effect might be caused by a lower availability of sight deposits within\none month.\nNoteworthy is also the long-run coefficient of other regulatory payment obligations, since it\nindicates each unit of these obligations is associated with more regulatory liquid assets than\nrequired: For each unit of these obligations, savings banks have 1.7 times the amount of total\nregulatory liquid assets required by the liquidity regulation. This finding indicates that savings\nbanks hold a liquidity buffer. However, the liquidity buffer we estimated seems to be rather\nlarge. One reason for such a large liquidity buffer might be that savings banks manage their\nliquidity in such a way that they can meet regulatory liquidity requirements even if they are\nseeking to expand their loans to non-banks. Savings banks aiming at expanding their loans to\nnon-banks may reserve the repayments from loans and advances (which are factored into the\nnumerator of the RLR) for the funding of new illiquid loans (which are not factored into the\ndenominator of the RLR). In line with this reasoning is the less pronounced effect of other\nshort-term payment obligations on debt and equity securities and cash balances: one unit of\nother regulatory obligations is associated with 0.66 units of securities and 0.05 units of cash\nbalances. Thus, with respect to securities and cash balances, savings banks do not, per se, hold\nliquidity buffers. This implies savings banks need some of the repayments from loans and\nadvances maturing within the next month to meet the requirements in the liquidity regulation.\nSeveral of our control variables related to bank-specific characteristics and the macroeconomic\nenvironment help in explaining regulatory liquid assets. Total regulatory liquid assets,\nsecurities, and cash balances are lower when savings banks have higher shares of loans to non-\nbanks relative to total assets. Additionally, savings banks reduce their securities holdings when\nthey increase loans to non-banks, while they do not reduce their cash balances significantly\nirrespective of whether or not cash balances contain lending commitments received by other\ninstitutions. This might be because cash balances are kept at a minimum and that this minimum\nis necessary to meet reserve requirements.\nBank size, i.e., the logarithm of total assets, and savings banks' interbank connections relative to\ntotal assets impact significantly negatively on regulatory liquid assets. Thus, larger savings\nbanks and savings banks with more connections in the interbank market in the last period have a\nsmaller volume of regulatory liquid assets in the current period. As argued in the last section,\nsavings banks with multiple connections may hold a smaller amount of liquid assets either\nbecause they do not have to prepare for liquidity shortages as much as their counterparts do or\nbecause they used their liquid assets in the past to grant illiquid loans before they started to raise\nadditional funds in the interbank market which increased their number of connections.\nAs to the macroeconomic environment, coefficients have the expected signs: an increase in\nGDP growth or in the short-term interest rate reduces total regulatory liquid assets. However,\nthe types of regulatory liquid assets are differently affected by changes in the macroeconomic\nenvironment. An increase in the short-term interest rate, which increases the opportunity costs\nof holding cash, results in higher securities holdings, while it leads to lower cash balances. An\nincrease in GDP growth, which may be associated with increasing loan demands, results in\nsmaller securities holdings, whereas it results in larger cash balances. Thus, when the economy\nexpands, savings banks change their composition of liquid assets towards those assets that we\nclassified as being more liquid. This might be because savings banks need liquidity to be\nprepared to provide additional loans to non-banks.\nTo further test the robustness of our findings, we use a sample in which only savings banks not\ninvolved in mergers and acquisitions are included. This sample is a balanced panel data set, i.e.,\nthe number of observations is equal for each bank included. Using this sample allows us to\nfigure out whether banks involved in mergers and acquisitions drive the estimation results in\nTable 6. Employing this sample confirms our estimation results: the coefficients of sight\ndeposits and other short-term payment obligations do not change at all.\nSince actual withdrawal rates do not induce savings banks to hold more regulatory liquid assets\nthan required, the question arises why savings banks do not reduce the amount of sight deposits\nwhen they cannot use it to finance illiquid assets as intensively as permitted by the regulator.\nWe have three reasons to explain this behavior. First, the costs per unit of sight deposits may be\nless than the returns per unit of liquid assets, giving savings banks an incentive to collect as\nmany sight deposits as possible and hold them in liquid assets. This strategy is, however, not\nriskless, as it is subject to market risks. Second, reducing the amount of sight deposits might not\nonly lower the number of depositors but also the number of other customers (cross-selling).\nFinally, reducing the amount of sight deposits implies banks' size may shrink which may not\nmesh with the interests of managers, who may equate bigger with better (empire building).\nExtensions\nWe use extensions of the baseline models to gain insights on whether bank capital and risks in\nthe loan portfolio, impact on regulatory liquid assets significantly. None of the model extensions\nalters the insights we gained with respect to the short-term payment obligations and, more\nspecifically, with respect to sight deposits. The results of these extensions are not reported but\nare available upon request.\nAs for bank capital, CAPITAL, the recent literature hypothesizes that it absorbs risks. When\nbanks mainly employ purchased liquidity techniques, banks' capital is expected to affect\nsecurities holdings negatively. A well-capitalized bank may raise funds at a lower cost, as\ncapital absorbs risks and expands a bank's risk-bearing capacity (the risk-absorption hypothesis,\nsee Bhattacharya and Thakor 1993, Repullo 2004). As a consequence, a well-capitalized bank is\nexpected to have only the amount of regulatory liquid assets required by the regulator and to use\nthe remaining funds for lending. Since savings banks purchase only a relatively small amount of\ntheir liquidity (see Table 3),4 it is, however, unlikely that bank capital has a tremendous risk-\nabsorbing effect for them.\nAlternatively, Principle I, which implemented the Basel I Accord in Germany and was in force\nduring our sample period, may cause a negative relationship between bank capital and liquid\nassets. A bank very close to the regulatory threshold of the prudential capital rules may not\n4 Liabilities to credit institutions account for only about 6% of short-term liabilities maturing\nwithin the next month. In the case of a liquidity shortage, savings banks might, of course, purchase\nliquidity in the medium term, which would not show up in the data we use.\nincrease loans, since it would then fail to meet regulatory capital requirements (except if it can\nincrease regulatory capital). Thus, the bank would hold each additional unit of debt liabilities in\nthose liquid assets that enter the regulatory liquid assets specified under the liquidity regulation\nbut not the risk-weighted assets specified under Principle I. By contrast, a well-capitalized bank\ncan decide whether or not to increase loans or securities. In our model extensions, we do not\nemploy the Basel I capital ratio, but rather loans, which determine the denominator of the\ncapital ratio, and bank capital, which is the numerator of the capital ratio.\nWe run several regressions to test the impact of bank capital on liquid assets. However, the\nresults are inconclusive. When bank capital is additionally included in our baseline models, it\nturns out to be significantly positively related to liquid assets, contrasting with the view of risk\nabsorbing capacity. When the loan-asset ratio is removed from the baseline models, bank capital\nhas no significant impact on total liquid assets and securities, while it impacts on cash balances\nsignificantly negatively.\nAs for risks in banks' loan portfolio, we use new loan loss provisions and loan write-offs\ndivided by loans to non-banks, LL, and a Herfindahl-Hirschman index based on exposures to 23\nsectors, HHI. New loan loss provisions and loan write-offs are used to approximate credit risk\n(e.g., Merkl and Stolz 2006) that determines the certainty of repayments from loans maturing\nwithin the next month. The Herfindahl-Hirschman index is used to approximate concentration\nrisk that may impact on regulatory liquid assets since the degree of diversification of a loan\nportfolio determines banks' resilience against sectoral shocks. Banks with lower concentration\nrisk due to a well-diversified loan portfolio may hold fewer liquid assets since they are less\nexposed to sectoral shocks than banks with a specialized loan portfolio. However, when we add\nthese risk measures to our baseline models, we do not gain further insights.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we analyzed the relationship between regulatory liquid assets and sight deposits, a\nrelationship that gives insights into whether savings banks transform sight deposits into illiquid\nassets as intensively as permitted by the regulator. For each unit of sight deposits, banks have to\nshow 0.1 units of regulatory liquid assets that contain, e.g., securities holdings, the cash\nbalances and repayments from loans maturing within the next month. Thus, if banks receive\nsufficient repayments from loans maturing within the next month, they can use all sight deposits\nat their disposal to grant illiquid loans to non-banks and credit institutions or to invest into\nsecurities stated as fixed financial assets. We formulated two predictions of why savings banks\nhold an amount of regulatory liquid assets for each unit of sight deposits that is higher than\nrequired by the regulator: (i) the actual withdrawal rate for sight deposits is higher than the\nregulator assumes (underestimation effect), and/or (ii) savings banks have limits in their non-\nbank lending that they do not offset by medium-term interbank lending or investments in other\nilliquid assets (lending effect).\nOur analysis showed that savings banks actually hold an amount of regulatory liquid assets for\neach unit of sight deposits that is much higher than required by the regulator. As to the\nunderestimation effect, we documented that in our sample the deposit withdrawal rate assumed\nby the regulator can be regarded as conservative. Thus, the underestimation effect is not present\nin our sample. As to the lending effect, we investigated whether non-bank lending impacts on\nhow much sight deposits banks hold in liquid assets. Our findings suggest that savings banks\nwith high lending to non-banks relative to total assets do not only have fewer liquid assets but\ndo also hold a smaller volume of sight deposits in liquid assets than banks with low lending to\nnon-banks. These findings indicate that it is more profitable for savings banks to hold liquid\nassets than to invest in illiquid assets, such as medium-term interbank lending to other credit\ninstitutions. However, even savings banks with high shares of loans to non-banks hold more\nregulatory liquid assets per unit of sight deposits than regulatorily required. We discussed\nseveral alternative explanations for why even savings banks with high shares of loans to total\nassets hold more regulatory liquid assets per unit of sight deposits than regulatory required. One\nexplanation was that banks report the amount of sight deposits available at the end of the month,\nmonthly averages of sight deposits might be lower.\nOur findings suggest two areas for further research. First, while the impact of prudential capital\nregulation on bank behavior has been well analyzed for banks located in several countries, such\nas the United States and Germany, little is known about the impact of prudential liquidity\nregulation on bank behavior. Of particular interest is whether prudential liquidity regulation puts\nbanks under pressure to increase their liquid assets or to decrease their short-term payment\nobligations as they converge to the regulatory threshold of the liquidity ratio. Second, the\npotential interaction between prudential capital and liquidity regulation is a relatively\nunexplored research area. Our findings show no clear relationship between savings banks'\nregulatory bank capital and regulatory liquid assets. However, we might only identify how\nprudential liquidity and capital regulations interact when regulatory pressure caused by capital\nor/and liquidity regulation is modeled jointly. In our paper, we did not focus on these questions\nbut leave them for future research.\nReferences\nAggarwal, R. and K. T. Jacques (2001).

Since small savings banks are likely connected to their head institution only, we set their number\nof interbank connection equal to one.\n6 Deutsche Bundesbank (2004) gives a detailed definition of the loans in the borrowers statistics\nand the group of borrowers. According to this definition, we use loans plus mortgage loans.\nTreatment of mergers and acquisitions\nDuring the sample period, the German banking sector underwent a substantial consolidation\nwave. Because bank-specific variables can jump substantially when banks merge or acquire\nanother bank, it is essential to treat mergers and acquisitions (M&A) adequately. Generally,\nthere are three ways to handle M&A:\n(i) The two pre-M&A banks are consolidated even prior to the M&A. This procedure\nis inadequate if the two banks are expected to have behaved differently prior to the\nM&A transaction.\n(ii) The two pre-M&A banks and the post-M&A bank are dropped from the dataset.\nThis procedure can result in a substantial information loss but it produces a\nbalanced dataset, i.e. the number of observations over time is identical for those\nbanks that remain in the dataset.\n(iii) The two pre-M&A banks are separated from the post-M&A bank and the resulting\nthree banks are handled separately. This procedure minimizes the loss of\ninformation but it produces an unbalanced panel dataset.\nDescriptive statistics and estimation results presented throughout the paper are based on a\nsample constructed by using the third procedure. In order to avoid double counting of banks in\nthe year of the M&A transaction, we drop banks in the year of the transaction. Moreover, in\norder to estimate dynamic responses in liquid assets, we need at least three observations per\nbank.\nIn our robustness section, we also employ a dataset constructed by using the second procedure,\nwhich gives useful insights into whether our estimation results are sensitive to changes.\nFigure 1: Changes in sight deposits\nThis figure shows the changes in sight deposits calculated from monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and\nDensity\nMonthly change\nDensity\nQuarterly change\nDensity\nSemi-annual change\nDensity\nAnnual change\nTable 1: Liquidity ratios by banking groups\nThis Table shows mean values and standard deviations of regulatory liquidity ratios calculated from\nmonthly reports.

Weights are given in parentheses if they are not equal to 100%.\nThe assessment basis of liquid assets is either the current market value, the repurchase price, the amount\nrepayable, or the book value.
