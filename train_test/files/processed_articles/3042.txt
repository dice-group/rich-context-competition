Most hearing loss was unilateral and slight in severity (16-\nto 25-dB hearing level). Of those with measured hearing loss, 10.8% were reported\nto have current hearing loss during the interview.\nConclusions.--This analysis indicates that 14.9% of US children have low-\nfrequency or high-frequency hearing loss of at least 16-dB hearing level in 1 or both\nears. Among children in elementary, middle, and high school, audiometric screen-\ning should include low-frequency and high-frequency testing to detect hearing loss.\nA CHILD'S ABILITY to hear influ-\nences the development of communica-\ntion and behavioral skills that affect\neducational experience and relation-\nships with other people.1,2 Public health\nscreening and intervention play an im-\nportant role in improving the health (in-\ncluding hearing status) and well-being\nof children. Children are most often ad-\nministered audiometric evaluations at\nspeech frequencies as part of routine\nphysical examinations or in school set-\ntings. The majority of conductive hear-\ninglossaffectsthelowfrequencies,while\nthe majority of sensorineural hearing\nloss affects the high frequencies.3 Im-\npacted cerumen, a foreign body, edema\nof the auditory canal, and otitis media\nare just a few of many possible causes of\nconductive hearing loss among chil-\ndren.2,3 Noise, medications, meningitis,\nand congenital syphilis are among the\nmany possible causes of sensorineural\nhearing loss among children.2,3 Studies\nhave shown that high-frequency hear-\ning loss from noise exposure during\nchildhoodcanleadtofurtherhearingloss\nfrom acute or chronic noise exposure at\nolder ages.4\nThe effect of noise in the environment\non hearing levels has gained increased\nrecognition.5 In the United States, few\nstudies have included a range of high-\nfrequency audiometry (3 kHz) from\nwhichhearinglossprevalenceestimates\ncan be derived for children.6-9 Recent\ndata from the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease\nControlandPrevention,offertheoppor-\ntunity to examine both low and high au-\ndiometric frequencies and to evaluate\nthe presence of hearing loss by sociode-\nmographic characteristics in a national\nsample of children aged 6 to 19 years.\nMETHODS\nNHANES III Sample Design\nNHANES III used a stratified multi-\nstage probability design.10 The sample\nwho were representative of the US ci-\nvilian noninstitutionalized population 2\nmonths of age or older.10 National popu-\nlation estimates, as well as estimates for\nthe3largestracialandethnicsubgroups\nin the US population (non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican\nAmerican), can be derived from the 6-\nyear survey.10 Data were collected\nthrough household interviews, and\nstandardized audiometric examinations\nwere conducted in a mobile examination\ncenter.11 The NHANES III protocol for\naudiometryincludedpersonsaged6to19\nyears, and did not include otoscopic ex-\naminations.\nAudiometric Measures\nAudiometry was conducted in a\nsound-treatedroominthemobileexami-\nnation center by trained examiners us-\ning a standardized protocol.

Prior to the audio-\nmetric examination, a screening ques-\ntionnairewasadministeredtodetermine\ntestexclusionsandtoassessfactorsthat\nmay affect test results (draining ears,\ncold, sinus or earache problems, expo-\nsure to music through use of earphones\nor headphones, and exposure to very\nloudnoisewithinthepast24hours).Par-\nents or guardians responded to these\nquestionsforchildrenaged6to12years.\nfor themselves.

Because of the very small numbers\nin these finer categories, the categories\nwere collapsed. Categories of hearing\nwere examined by left and right ear, and\nby better ear (ear with lower PTA) and\nworse ear (ear with higher PTA). The\nbetter ear definition includes children\nwith unilateral hearing loss as normal,\nwhereas the worse ear definition does\nnot. Hearing thresholds were evaluated\nat each tested frequency.

This differ-\nence may be explained by several fac-\ntors. First, a child with transient or tem-\nporary hearing loss at the time of audio-\nmetric testing may not have had the\nhearing loss at the time of the household\ninterview, which could have been as\nmany as 8 weeks prior to the examina-\ntion. In addition, a child may have had\ntemporary or transient hearing loss at\nthe time of the interview, but not at the\ntime of the examination. Second, hear-\ning loss was reported by a parent or\nguardian for youths aged 6 to 16 years\nandthus,maynothavereflectedthetrue\nhearingstatusasrecognizedbythechild.\nThird, because the majority of detected\nhearing loss was in the slight range, par-\nyears who answered questions on hear-\ning loss for themselves, may not have\nrecognized hearing loss.1,24 Although\nsome children do not recognize hearing\nloss, these children may be missing\nlistening information and are at risk\nfor learning disabilities.1,2 The overall\nprevalence of hearing difficulty by self-\nreport (3.4%) from the NHANES III\nhousehold interview is almost double\nHealth Interview Survey Hearing\nSupplements for children aged 3 to 17\nOtherstudieshavereportedresultsof\nhigh-frequency testing9,24; however, to\nour knowledge, no nationally represen-\ntative study has examined hearing at\nhigh frequencies in children since the\nNational Health Examination Surveys\nThe documentation of the results of\nNHES audiometric testing are present-\ned in a different format with different\ndefinitions and methods than the pres-\nentstudy.Thus,theresultsofthisanaly-\nsis cannot be compared with docu-\nmented analyses of NHES audiometric\ndata.

These findings are\nsimilar to our findings that 7.1% of US\nchildren aged 6 to 19 years had either\nunilateral or bilateral LFHL, and 12.7%\nhad HFHL. Cozad et al24 found that\n10.6% of their sample of children aged 6\nto 18 years in Kansas had hearing loss\ngreater than 10-dB HL at the individual\nkHz in 1 or both ears, with 34.4% of the\n10.6% failing low-frequency screening\nquency screening.\nIncluding3,4,and6kHzforaudiomet-\nric screening and PTA calculations re-\nsults in a more accurate measurement of\nhearing loss throughout childhood and\nadolescence, especially among those\nchildren who do not recognize that they\nmay be detected early by looking at each\ntested frequency, particularly for noise-\ninduced hearing loss, which initially in-\nvolves 1 or more frequencies in the 3- to\n6-kHz range.4 The audiometric screen-\ning questions regarding noise did not\nshow an association with temporary\nthreshold shifts.
