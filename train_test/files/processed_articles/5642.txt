    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper explores the variety of ways that emerging sources of (big) data are being used to re-conceptualize the city,\nand how these understandings of what the urban is shapes the design of interventions into it. Drawing on work on the\nperformativity of economics, this paper uses two vignettes of the `new urban science' and municipal vacant property\nmapping in order to argue that the mobilization of Big Data in the urban context doesn't necessarily produce a single,\ngreater understanding of the city as it actually is, but rather a highly variegated series of essentialized understandings of\nthe city that render it knowable, governable and intervene-able. Through the construction of new, data-driven urban\ngeographical imaginaries, these projects have opened up the space for urban interventions that work to depoliticize\nurban injustices and valorize new kinds of technical expertise as the means of going about solving these problems,\nopening up new possibilities for a remaking of urban space in the image of these sociotechnical paradigms. Ultimately, this\npaper argues that despite the importance of Big Data, as both a discourse and practice, to emerging forms of urban\nresearch and management, there is no singular or universal understanding of the urban that is promoted or developed\nthrough the application of these new sources of data, which in turn opens up meaningful possibilities for developing\nalternative uses of Big Data for understanding and intervening in the city in more emancipatory ways.\n",

First, we are faced with\nan explosion of interest in, and debates about, cities\nand urbanization. From the repeated invocation of the\n(pernicious) fact that over half of the world's popula-\ntion is currently living in cities for the first time in\nhuman history, to the emergence of a kind of `pop\nurbanism' ranging from the work of Richard Florida\nand Ed Glaeser, to increasingly public debates about\nthe purported benefits and ills of gentrification, cities\nare on the agenda (cf. Brenner and Schmid, 2014;\nPeck, 2016). But the bigness of cities and the discourse\nsurrounding them is matched only by the bigness of\ndata used to understand them. At the same time as\ncities have taken center stage as an object of concern,\nwe have at our disposal a wider array of data and\ntools of analysis to help us understand social\nprocesses, technologies which are thought to be revo-\nlutionary for the way we conduct research and dis-\ncover previously unforeseen knowledge. Emerging\nsources of so-called `Big Data' are seen as enabling\nnew kinds of discoveries unhampered by longstanding\ntheoretical approaches, which only work to constrain\nour abilities to interpret the data as it actually is (cf.\nIn concert, these two trends have produced a multi-\nbillion dollar a year industry around the provision of\nso-called `smart cities' strategies.

Batty,\n2014). But, contrary to the dominant discourses about\nthe potential for these new smart city strategies to revo-\nlutionize urban governance and management, there\nisn't a single, linear pathway through Big Data that\nproduces a greater understanding of cities and urban\nprocesses, much less inherently better outcomes.\nIndeed, the dominant framing of the smart city offered\nup by multinational technology companies remains just\none way among many that data is being applied to the\nunderstanding of cities (cf. Barns, 2016; Leszczynski,\n2016). While the overarching ethos of Big Data prom-\nises to provide a single, scientific, more all-encompass-\ning, universal and rational explanation of social\nprocesses that is lacking in the broader scholarly litera-\nture on cities, the urban geographical imagination pro-\nduced with the aid of Big Data remains a deeply\nvariegated and often contradictory one. Far from\nsuperseding longstanding debates about the nature of\nthe urban, the pluralism of this data-driven urban geo-\ngraphical imagination actually validates contemporary\nclaims within urban geography that ``there can be no\nsingle urban theory of ubiquitous remit'' (Leitner and\nfor an argument in favor of a more pluralistic approach\nto urban theory, contra Scott and Storper's, 2015 call\nfor a more unified understanding of the urban based\naround the ideas of agglomeration and the urban land\nnexus).\nIt is worth noting, however, that while `Big Data'\nremains the buzzword du jour in the emerging model\nof data-driven urbanism, in many ways, it is not the\n`bigness' of the data that matters. Drawing on\nKitchin and McArdle's (2016) typology of Big Data,\nit isn't even the velocity or `exhaustivity' of the data\nin question that makes its application to understanding\nand planning cities powerful; rather, it is simply import-\nant that it is `data'. I would argue that the dominant\ndiscursive framing that valorizes Big Data has actually\nvalorized data of all shapes and sizes--big or small,\ndigital or analog, volunteered or captured, structured\nor unstructured. As such, data writ-large has been\nuniquely invested with a substantial power to not\nonly understand but, as I will describe in more detail\nthroughout this paper, also shape our world. So even\nthough we live in an ongoing `age of Big Data', it is\nimportant to broaden our collective view to the way the\nbroader discourse around Big Data has reconfigured a\nrange of dynamics beyond the relatively narrow pur-\nview of what we might be able to define with some\nspecificity as distinctly `Big' Data.\nThe rest of this paper explores the ways that the city\nhas been (re-)conceptualized through the use of (Big)\nData, the kinds of understandings promoted by these\nuses, and how these understandings shape the kinds of\ninterventions into the urban that emerge from such\ntrajectories. As Rose-Redwood (2012) has argued\nrecently,\n``whereas much is known about the history of quanti-\nfication as a method of geographical analysis, far less\nresearch has explored how numerical calculation itself\nhas historically reshaped political practices and the geo-\ngraphies of everyday life. This distinction between\nquantitative methods in geography and the geography\nof calculation is significant, because it draws attention\nto the way in which calculative rationalities have been\nused to refashion the world in their own image'' (300)\nWhile this particular characterization constructs a\nsomewhat artificial binary between the ways that quan-\ntification is reproduced in scholarship and how quanti-\nfication reproduces particular kinds of socio-spatial\nrelationships outside of the academic realm, Rose-\nRedwood is certainly right to draw attention to the\nrelative lack of understanding of the broader impacts\nof quantification and computation. The fact that ``[w]e\nlive in an increasingly quantitative world'' (Sheppard,\nthe `academic' and the `practical', as is evidenced by the\nincreasing prominence of Big Data, a discourse and\npractice largely originating in the private sector,\nwithin the academy itself.\nIn order to understand the interplay between these\ndifferent domains and their shared mode of data-centric\nknowledge production, this paper utilizes two distinct\ncase studies in order to highlight how particular uses of\ndata help to refigure our understandings of the urban,\nand shape the realm of possibilities for interventions\ninto these spaces. While these two vignettes, one\nfocused on the emerging field of `urban science' and\nthe other on the use of data by a municipal government\nin order to understand vacant properties, are largely\nunrelated, they are selected to highlight the diversity\nof ways that Big Data is deployed in order to under-\nstand cities. These two cases operate at different spatial\nscales, ranging from the macro-scale redefinition of\nwhat the urban actually is to a more meso-scale focus\non how we understand particular social problems as\nsituated in particular partitionings of urban space,\nwhile also operating in different socio-institutional con-\ntexts, from scholarly knowledge to urban planning and\n2 Big Data & Society\npublic administration. Indeed, these differences\nbetween the two cases are manifest in the ways that\nthey point towards contradictory and competing under-\nstandings of urban processes, despite their shared focus\non the ostensibly straightforward use of data to reveal\nunforeseen insights into the city. Ultimately, drawing\non work on the performativity of economics, this paper\nargues that the mobilization of Big Data in the urban\ncontext doesn't produce greater understandings of the\ncity as it actually is, but rather produces a series of\nessentialized understandings of the city that render it\nknowable, governable and, ultimately, intervene-able in\nparticular ways. Or, in the language of James C Scott\n(1998), these techniques render the urban `legible',\nthough not simply to the state, but also simultaneously\nto citizens and to capital. The understanding of `the\nurban' promoted by these projects or initiatives is, at\nbest, extremely partial, but yet still powerful and influ-\nential. Through the construction of new urban geo-\ngraphical imaginaries, these projects have opened up\nthe space for urban interventions that work to depol-\niticize urban injustices and valorize new kinds of tech-\nnical expertise as the means of going about solving\nthese problems, opening up new possibilities for a\nremaking of urban space in the image of these socio-\ntechnical paradigms.\nPre-histories of Big Data and the city\nAlthough the emergence of a data-driven urban geo-\ngraphical imagination has become more pronounced\nin the last several years, it is important to recognize\nthat these particular interminglings of scientific ideol-\nogy, new technologies and urban problem-solving\naren't all that new (Barnes, 2013). Appeals to `science'\nand `quantification' (the two are usually seen to be\nequivalent) as leading to higher forms of knowledge\nhave a long history in the social sciences in general,\nand in geography and urban studies in particular, lead-\ning Doreen Massey (1999) to argue against the perva-\nsive `physics envy' in human geography.1 Indeed, it is\nworth noting that some of the earliest forms of quan-\ntitative geography emerged out of an adoption of con-\ncepts and methods from the emerging field of social\nphysics, which prefigure some of the contemporary\ntrends, and theories, seen in data-driven urban research\n(cf. Barnes and Wilson, 2014). Even though social sci-\nentists of all stripes have long maintained a tense rela-\ntionship with `science', as such, some of the earliest\nsocial scientific scholarship on the city, conducted by\nWEB DuBois and Emile Durkheim in the late 19th\ncentury emphasized the use of quantitative methods\nas a way of appealing to the newly emerging standards\nof a scientific sociology. Similarly, the seminal works of\nRobert Park, Ernest Burgess, and much of the rest of\nthe Chicago School of Urban Sociology mobilized both\nthe quantitative methodology of social surveys and\nexplanatory metaphors taken from the biological sci-\nences, signaling a longstanding trading zone between\nthe `hard' sciences and the ostensibly non-scientific\nstudy of cities and urban places (Bulmer, 1981;\nThe more practically driven work of planning and\ngoverning cities has long fallen under similar ways of\nthinking. And though the emergence and availability of\nBig Data has brought with it a pervasive sense that\n``something important has changed'' (Graham and\nhistory of the planning profession, ``[i]nformation has\nemphasis added). Were one to go all the way back to\nthe birth of town and regional planning, the importance\nof such scientific, data-driven approaches to planning\ncan be seen in Patrick Geddes' Camera Obscura and\nthe notion of the civic survey (Hall, 2002). More expli-\ncit calls for a scientific approach to planning were being\nmade as early as the second decade of the 20th century,\nas seen in George Ford's claim that ``city planning is\nrapidly becoming as definite a science as pure engineer-\nurban planning and management have long been\nshaped by a range of technocratic experts drawing on\nthe powerful discourses associated with the production\nof a `scientific' approach to cities inspired by the likes of\nFrederick Taylor and others (Fairfield, 1994; Schultz\nAs historian Jennifer Light (2003) has documented,\nthe contemporary application of emerging scientific and\ntechnological innovations to the problems of cities is\nfirmly rooted in similar trends in the Cold War era\nimmediately following World War II. Although\nLight's book predates much of the more recent atten-\ntion built around the smart cities movement, she makes\nclear that even for those mid-20th century efforts at a\ntechnoscientific approach to planning, ``[t]he quest for a\ncoherent science of the city was not new'' (Light, 2003:\n48). It should be evident that this is even more the case\nin the present day. That being said, while there is a\nmuch longer history to this kind of data-driven urban\nplanning and governance than is often recognized, this\ntendency has not been entirely persistent over the\ncourse of the last century. As LeGates et al. (2009)\nargue:\n``The revolution in digital spatial technology has cre-\nated a new wave of enthusiasm for `scientific' urban\nplanning--the third in the 100-year history of modern\nurban planning. Since the beginning of the last century\nurban planners have alternately embraced rational\nplanning, rigorous scientific methods, and exploitation\nof technology, only to reject scientific city planning\nwhen the application of the technology and the\ntheory of the day failed to produce the overly optimistic\nresults advocates had promised'' (763)\nIndeed, one of the strongest statements against these\nrepeated attempts to make the study and planning of\ncities more scientific came in the form of Douglass Lee's\n(1973) ``Requiem for Large-Scale Models'', an excori-\nation of precisely the type of `hyper-comprehensive'\nplanning approaches being promoted by contemporary\nsmart cities advocates. And while one of Lee's primary\npoints of contention was that these models were con-\nstrained by a lack of available data, a problem it would\nseem would be substantially less relevant in the present\nmoment, his arguments remain prescient and applic-\nable to the broader scientific modeling impulse\nbeing applied to cities in the present day (cf. Batty,\n\u00a8 mmelstroet et al., 2014). Although practices\nof quantification have always held a certain power\ndue to their air of objectivity (cf. Porter, 1996), the\ncontemporary moment surrounding Big Data seems\nrelatively novel in that it is data itself that is fore-\ngrounded, rather than particular techniques or\napproaches to analyzing it. Data is increasingly ima-\ngined as providing a fundamentally unique and sub-\nstantive insight into the world around us, regardless\nof the particular form of data or the particular ques-\ntions being asked of it.\nAs these historical examples highlight, both the\n`urban'--as a process and ideal--and the `city'--as a\njuridical construct and material reality--are always in a\nprocess of being re-imagined and re-made through\nsocio-technical practices and processes. The urban as\nwe are able to know it doesn't preexist these forms of\nknowledge production, but comes into being through\nthem. Inspired by the work of Donald MacKenzie and\nTimothy Mitchell, among others, the rest of this paper\napplies the insights of work on the social construction\nand performativity of the economy to the social\nconstruction and performativity of the urban, focusing\non how the constitutive discourse and practice of\nBig Data is reshaping what we understand the\nessential nature of the urban to be, and therefore,\nhow we imagine ourselves to be able to change it. As\nMitchell writes, ``[t]he economy came into being as a\nself-contained, internally dynamic, and statistically\nmeasurable sphere of social action, scientific analysis,\nand political regulation'' (Mitchell, 2002: 4); so too is it\nthe case with the urban. Using two vignettes, the fol-\nlowing section documents the different ways in which\nthe contemporary focus on data is producing new kinds\nof representations and understandings of the urban,\ngiving way to different ways of intervening in these\nspaces.\nUnpacking the data-driven urban\ngeographical imagination\nKey to the rethinking of data's role in contemporary\nprocesses of urban planning and governance is the rec-\nognition that data does not inherently ``offer a higher\nform of intelligence and knowledge that can generate\ninsights that were previously impossible, with the aura\nof truth, objectivity, and accuracy'' (Boyd and\nBig Data--incredibly partial and value laden, but it is\nalso more than just a reflection, even a distorted one.\nIndeed, drawing on work on performativity we can say\nthat data of all kinds does not simply capture the world\nas it actually is, but in the process of representing it,\nalso transforms it. In his seminal analyses of the per-\nformative role of economics, Donald MacKenzie writes\nthat ``Financial economics . . . did more than analyze\nmarkets; it altered them. It was an `engine'. . . an\nactive force transforming its environment, not a\nIndeed, the same can be said of any such mobilization\nof data, though the effects of the performativity of data\nare in many ways increasingly masked by an ideology\nthat continues to frame data as an objective and value-\nfree way of assessing the world as it actually is. While\nsimilar currents of thought have long been applied to\nquestions of mapping (cf. Harley, 1989), recent work by\nAalbers (2014a) has explicitly brought together the\napproaches of critical cartography and performativity,\narguing that ``cartographers do not simply produce\nknowledge about geography; they produce geography\nthrough their observations and measurements.\nMapping contributes to the making of geography\nrather than simply describing geography . . . the act of\nmapping a place becomes part of shaping that place.\nMapping performs, shapes and formats geography,\nrather than merely observing how it functions''\nseeing the map as a neutral transmitter of information\nto seeing the map as the product of power relations (cf.\nCrampton, 2001), the performativity thesis argues, in\neffect, that ``it is the map that precedes the territory''\nAs MacKenzie and others argue, ``It is not (only)\nabout economics being `right' or `wrong' but (also,\nand perhaps more important) about it being `able' or\n`unable' to transform the world'' (MacKenzie et al.,\n2007: 2). Again, the same can be said for how data-\ndriven analyses construct new understandings of the\nurban; it is less important that these analyses be correct\nor comprehensive, per se, but rather that through such\nanalyses, these technologies (and the systems of human\nknowledge organized around them) enable a particular\nway of seeing social processes and understanding them\n4 Big Data & Society\nas problems to be (and that can be) solved. While much\nof the literature on the performativity of economics\nfocuses on how ostensibly detached scholarly know-\nledge about the economy has come to influence the\nactual practices and functioning of the economy, my\nfocus here is not exclusively on the construction of\nthe urban by scholars, though that is certainly a\npart of it. Given that one feature of the ongoing\n`data revolution' is a blurring of the boundaries\nbetween academic, industry and governmental know-\nledges through the widespread application of data to\na variety of problems, any analytical separation\nbetween these spheres is tenuous at best. As such, the\ntwo vignettes that follow explore ways that both schol-\narly interpretations of the urban, as well as more\n`applied' or practical mobilizations of data to under-\nstand urban processes in fact work to construct the\nurban as we know it.\nThe `scientific' redefinition of the city\nAlthough much of the contemporary discourse around\nthe application of Big Data to cities has focused on the\nrole of multinational technology corporations active in\nthe nascent smart cities industry (cf. Greenfield, 2013;\n\u00a8 derstro\n\u00a8 m et al.,\nthe more prominent examples of how Big Data\nhas been mobilized to rethink the urban is in the\nform of the more academic `new urban science'\n(cf. Townsend, 2015). Led largely by the likes of physi-\ncists and computer scientists working in new start-up\nacademic research centers like NYU's Center for\nUrban Science and Progress or the University of\nChicago's Urban Center for Computation and Data,\nthis nascent academic field attempts to apply the ana-\nlytical tools of the `hard' sciences to what they see as the\ninsufficiently `scientific' field of urban studies. Though\nsome more conventionally trained social scientists have\nattempted to push forward the call for a more `scien-\ntific' approach to urban studies (cf. Solecki et al 2013\nand Batty 2013, who has been arguing for such a scien-\ntific approach from within a more conventional geo-\ngraphic framework for several decades, or similar\nsuch calls being made a half-century ago by Berry\n1964), arguably the most prominent boosters and exem-\nplars of this approach have been the Santa Fe Institute-\naffiliated physicists Geoffrey West and Luis Bettencourt.\nThanks to the media-friendly packaging of their research\nas the search for a single `universal law' of urbanization,\nWest and Bettencourt's work has led to a New York\nTimes profile in 2010, a feature on the popular NPR\nradio program RadioLab, a widely viewed TED Talk\nin 2011 and a range of other recurring media inquiries\nabout urban issues in the years since.\nThough much of the supporting discourse around\nthis new urban science tends towards a hubristic dis-\nmissal of all previous scholarly research into cities and\nurban processes, such as the aforementioned work by\nmid-20th century quantitative geographers and urban-\nists like Berry and Batty, what is most important about\ntheir work from my perspective is that it highlights how\nthe epistemological position associated with much of\nthe conventional Big Data research leads directly to a\nparticular ontological position about what the city\nactually is. For West and Bettencourt, the epistemo-\nlogical commitments of quantification require them to\ndevelop an ontology of the urban that is constrained\nentirely by that which is most easily counted. In their\ncase, a range of relatively accessible (if geographically\nuneven) data on patents, crime, gross domestic product,\nand income (presumably among other things), points to\nthe fundamental role of population size in determining\nthe nature of the city. The city as imagined by urban\nscience is one of, quite simply, little more than a mass\nof population. As Bettencourt and West say plainly,\n``size is the major determinant of most characteristics\nof a city; history, geography and design have secondary\none of several papers reporting on their research, they\nattempt to walk back these claims by saying that\n``population size is not so much a causal force''\n(Bettencourt et al., 2010: 6), such a statement pales in\ncomparison to their repeated focus, even within the\nsame paper, on arguing that ``population size plays a\nfundamental role in this approach'' (Bettencourt et al.,\n2010: 6), and even going as far as to admit that the\nentire research project is analytically predetermined to\nbe about population: ``Our primary analytical focus\nhere was concerned with the consequences of popula-\ntion size on a variety of urban metrics'' (Bettencourt\nBut the urban geographical imaginary developed by\nWest and Bettencourt isn't defined entirely by popula-\ntion size, but also by universality. Throughout their\npublished findings, West and Bettencourt are at pains\nto emphasize just how universal and fundamental their\nlaw of superlinear scaling is. There is, however, little to\nno reflection on how their theorizations are the result of\nunstated assumptions about geographic processes that\nare an artifact of their data collection procedures. In his\nwidely viewed 2011 TED Talk, West claims that ``This\n15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the\nplanet--Japan, Chile, Portugal, Scotland, doesn't\nmatter. Always, all the data shows it's the same, despite\nthe fact that these cities have evolved independently.\nSomething universal is going on'' (West, 2011). It is\nunclear, however, whether the data West and\nBettencourt mobilize actually substantiates such\nclaims to universality. In one of their earlier papers\non the subject, they described having ``obtained data-\nsets at this level of detail mostly for the US, where\ntypically more data are available and in more particular\ncases for European countries and China'' (Bettencourt\nonly about a third of the global population. It is unclear\nfrom their website and published papers whether data\ncollection was entirely limited to these countries, or\nwhether cities in Latin America, Africa, and Asia\nwere also included, and if excluded, what impact\nthese cities might have on the supposedly universal scal-\ning laws. Paraphrasing a recent intervention by Susan\nParnell and Edgar Pieterse (2016), ``either [these places]\nmust be ignored, or the theory, method and data of\nurban [science] must change'' (p. 241). Similarly,\nthrough the use of statistics aggregated to either jurid-\nical or functional urban boundaries, West and\nBettencourt fail to consider that the social processes\nembodied in their metrics may be geographically\nuneven within each city. For instance, in their invoca-\ntion of patent registrations as a proxy measure for\ninnovation, West and Bettencourt assume that such\ninnovation is distributed equally across the city,\nrather than concentrated in particular sub-urban local-\nities. The same could be said for their use of data on\nincome, crime, pollution, and so on. Unless each of\nthese variables corresponded appropriately with popu-\nlation aggregates at finer spatial resolutions, which is\nhighly unlikely given the increasingly splintered nature\nof contemporary cities (cf. Graham and Marvin, 2001),\nthe superlinear scaling ideal would seem to break down\nat any other scale of analysis, further suggesting that\nthe theory itself seems to be more an artifact of the data\nused to create it than the objective identification of a\nfundamental socio-spatial process.\nBorrowing from Timothy Mitchell, these flaws in\nWest and Bettencourt's logical construction do not so\nmuch matter,\n``Since these calculations were helping to bring into\nbeing the world they calculated, success d[oes] not\nnecessarily depend on having the most accurate figures.\nWhat mattered more was whether the calculations\nenabled the network to be conceived and built . . . suc-\ncessful calculative devices are not necessarily those that\nare the most statistically complete or mathematically\nrigorous. They are those that make it possible to con-\nceive of a network, or market, or national economy, or\nwhatever is being designed, and assist in the practical\nIndeed, West and Bettencourt's redefinition of the\nurban isn't important simply because of the attention\nit has gotten or its attempts to supersede existing urban\ntheories, but because its understanding of what the\nurban actually is, in turn shapes the way we can under-\nstand what is and isn't possible in terms of policy inter-\nventions in important ways. Ultimately, the effect of\nWest and Bettencourt's population-centric theory of\nurban scaling is a naturalization of the status quo.\nof quantitative geography's valorization and natural-\nization of stylized models of urban land use, the logical\nresult of arguing that the quintessential urban problems\nof wealth inequality, crime, pollution, and so on, are all\ndirectly tied to a single universal law or model--in this\nFigure 1. Visualizing the law of urban scaling, from Bettencourt and West (2010).\n6 Big Data & Society\ncase, population size--is to say that there's nothing we\ncan do to change these things.\nWhen asked in an interview about the practical\nimplications of their theories, West responded that\n``The scaling laws tell you that despite all of the efforts\nof planners, geographers, economists, architects, and\npoliticians, and all of the local history, geography,\nand culture, somehow cities end up having to\nobey these scaling laws. We need to be aware of\nthose forces when we design and redesign cities''\n(Greenwood, 2012). Or, as they argue in one of their\nearlier papers, ``The realization that most urban indi-\ncators scale with city size nontrivially, implying\nincreases per capita in crime or innovation rates and\ndecreases on the demand for certain infrastructure, is\nessential to set realistic targets for local policy''\nBettencourt argue that all cities are, at their core, the\nsame, and that there is nothing we can particularly do\nto change that fact. `Realistic' in this sense would seem\nto mean an acceptance of such fundamental laws and a\nretreat from meaningful, substantive efforts to change\nthem. Although West and Bettencourt's influence on\nbroader urban debates isn't so great that planners\nand policymakers around the world are likely to aban-\ndon their efforts entirely and simply let cities run their\n`natural' course, their redefinition of the urban as an\nessentially unchangeable biological organism provides\na kind of cover or justification for the lack of meaning-\nful improvements in urban life from what are, in most\ncases, neoliberal policy interventions. In a New York\nTimes profile of West, it is said that West believes\nthat ``creating a more sustainable society will require\nour big cities to get even bigger'' (Lehrer, 2010). It\nwould seem to follow, however, that if we were to\ndesire minimizing the range of negatives that come\nwith increased city size, the only solution would not\nbe to further grow cities, but to depopulate them, a\nfact that seems much more in tune with West's admit-\ntedly neo-Malthusian thinking (Greenwood, 2012).\nRegardless, such a laissez faire approach to urban\npolicy remains grounded in a theoretical construct\nthat is itself significantly the product of uneven, and\nin some cases potentially incommensurate, data, but\nwhich is widely accepted due to its appeals to the sup-\nposed objectivity and rationality inherent in Big Data\nanalytics, and its ability to reinforce the contemporary\npolicy status quo.\nVacant property mapping and the\n(re)production of territorial stigma\nWhile the example of urban science's attempts to\nreshape our understandings of the urban at a macro-\nlevel demonstrates how the data-driven urban\ngeographical imagination is being produced in very\npublic and visible ways, our understandings of the\nnature of urban space are also being shaped at finer\nspatial scales, and in much more mundane ways. In\nparticular, I am interested in the mobilization of new\nweb mapping tools to produce quick snapshots of dif-\nferent datasets on urban processes, which has allowed\nfor a solidification of urban geographical imaginaries\noriented around the idea of `problem areas'. While this\nparlance is not particularly novel, through this phrasing\nI hope to draw attention to the double meaning of the\n`problem area' and the increasingly important role of\ndata in its construction: on the one hand, different\nactors and institutions are able to understand that\nurban social problems are `of a place' and rooted in\nparticular geographic contexts, while, on the other\nhand, simultaneously understanding particular places\nas defined through and by their association with these\nproblems.\nIn many ways, the growth of simplistic map mashup\nvisualizations is tied to an increasing awareness of the\nimportance of geography to understanding social issues,\nand the growth of municipal data that is (or can be)\nexplicitly georeferenced to particular places within the\ncity. That is, these visualizations are the result of simul-\ntaneously social and technical processes. But these visu-\nalizations, and the kinds of questions that spur them on,\nare problematic in that they tend to treat social and\nspatial processes in isolation. Focusing on questions\nlike ``where is x?'' or ``where are the y located?'', repro-\nduces the kind of `spatial fetishism' long critiqued by\ngeographers, defined as ``the creation in the structure\nof spatial relationships of an autonomous determinant\nto history and human action separated from the struc-\nture of social relations and the production process that\nto the issue of collecting and representing spatial data,\nWilson (2011) argues that ``the pervasiveness of counting\nin these kinds of urban data practices . . . fixates on the\noccurrence, while displacing the conditions of that\noccurrence. Counting decontextualizes. Counting does\nnot remove meaning . . . counting matters too much''\n(865). That is, in simply focusing on mapping the\nlocations and concentrations of x or y urban problem,\nthese visualizations fail to attend to how these problems,\nand certainly any meaningful solution for them, goes\nbeyond a set of latitude and longitude coordinates or a\nparticular bounded spatial unit like a census tract or\nmunicipal boundary. As the geographer Nik Blomley\nhas written, ``Mapmaking and maplike visualizations\nplay a central role in power relations and the construc-\ntion of space, property, and social identity. . . to help\nmake possible the very idea of `space' as an abstract\ncategory, separate from the processes by which it is por-\nTo draw again on theories of performativity, the act\nof mapping a given urban problem doesn't necessarily\nproduce a meaningful understanding of the problem,\nthough it does, however, help to produce the problem\nitself, and particular understandings of space underly-\ning it. In the case of vacant and abandoned properties\nin Louisville, Kentucky, a variety of public-facing map-\nping platforms help to construct a geographical imagin-\nary of this problem as being in many ways synonymous\nwith the city's predominantly poor and African-\nAmerican West End. Initially developed in the early\n20th century as a white, working-class suburban area,\nthe West End underwent significant racial transition in\nthe mid-20th century, due in large part to a combin-\nation of urban renewal programs targeting what were\nthen predominantly black neighborhoods, as well as the\nwidespread enforcement of housing desegregation laws\nin predominantly white areas for the first time. As\nCummings and Price (1997) note, white flight from\nthe West End resulted in a halving of the area's white\npopulation throughout the 1960s, and again through\nthe 1970s, leading the West End to be, at present,\napproximately 80% African-American. While the\nWest End has long been neglected by the municipal\ngovernment, like countless other impoverished and\nmajority\u00adminority neighborhoods across the country,\nrecent years have brought a renewed attention to the\nWest End, and an attempt to address the so-called `9th\nStreet Divide' that separates the West End from the rest\nof the city (Crutcher, 2013). When one prominent local\nurbanist was asked during a talk at a local historical\nsociety what issue he would tackle if he had a magic\nwand, he responded simply with ``the West End'',\na comment important for simultaneously denoting the\nimportance the area holds to the city's future, as well as\nfor its synecdoche, or the way a variety of problems\ncome to be represented in the figure of the West End\nas a whole.\nOne of the key means through which this attention\nto the West End has been focused is through Mayor\nGreg Fischer's initiative to address the growth of\nvacant and abandoned properties in the city, the major-\nity of which are concentrated within the West End.\nIn early 2013, Fischer articulated a goal of reducing\nthe city's number of vacant and abandoned properties\nby 40% over three years, and 67% over five years\n(Bailey, 2013), and developed VAPStat, a spin-off of\nthe city's much-touted LouieStat performance improve-\nment program focused entirely on tracking, and pub-\nlicly reporting on, the city's progress on meeting\nvarious goals related to the vacant properties cam-\npaign. Fischer even assigned key responsibilities\nfor the vacant properties campaign to the city's\nInnovation Delivery Team, a group of experts funded\nby Bloomberg Philanthropies to introduce more\n`innovative' approaches to municipal governments\naround the country, with a particular focus on the\nuse of data to understand and solve problems facing\nmunicipal governments. As such, the question\nof vacant properties, and the West End more generally,\nbecame intimately intermingled with the city's broader\nfocus on the use of new data sources and analytics. But\nthe application of these data-driven and data-\ncentric approaches to understanding vacant\nproperties has not been entirely straightforward, as\nthe tools being used to more rationally manage the\nproblem also have a considerable hand in shaping the\nproblem itself.\nBeginning in early 2014, Louisville Metro\nGovernment partnered with the nascent technology\ncompany OpportunitySpace in order to serve as a\ntest case for their platform, listing city-owned land\nbank properties as part of a government-sponsored\n`Lots of Possibility' contest, in which innovative\nideas for redeveloping vacant properties could be sub-\nmitted for the chance to receive both the deed to a\nproperty and an additional grant to fund the proposed\nproject (Louisville Metro Government, n.d.).\nOpportunitySpace is a web-based platform, developed\nby then-graduate students in Harvard's Kennedy\nSchool of Government, that aims to leverage munici-\npal open data about vacant properties, especially those\nthat are publicly owned through land banks, in order\nto stimulate private investment in these properties.\nOpportunitySpace allows users to sort or gather\nmore information on these properties according to a\nrange of characteristics: their size, location, cost,\nzoning classifications, etc. (see Figure 2), in order to\nmake data that's technically publicly available more\npublicly accessible (Capps, 2014). And while some\nMetro government employees involved with the city's\nvacant properties campaign didn't see\nOpportunitySpace as providing the kind of single\nportal for property data that could rationalize the\nvacant property redevelopment process, they did see\nthe platform as being potentially important for the\nultimate goal of raising awareness about the city's\nstruggle with vacant properties and drumming up\ninterest in the Lots of Possibility competition and\nother government initiatives. That is, rather than pro-\nviding a comprehensive information portal about\nvacant properties, OpportunitySpace sees itself as\n``reflect[ing] cities' proactive posture related to redevel-\nopment'' (Capps, 2014), focused primarily on the\nchanneling of interest and energy related to these\nissues into the solution of market-based redevelop-\nment of these properties.\nAnd while the OpportunitySpace example is interest-\ning in that it is tied explicitly to a particular set of inter-\nventions, perhaps more interesting is the visualization\n8 Big Data & Society\nFigure 3. Heatmap of vacant properties in Louisville.\nFigure 2. The OpportunitySpace Interface for Louisville.\nof vacant properties seen in Figure 3. Taken from the\nLouisville Metro Government website--and lauded as\na centerpiece of the city's vacant properties campaign\n(Louisville Metro Government, 2013)--this heatmap\nview of vacant properties provides arguably the most\nsuccinct visual summary of the geography of vacant\nproperties in Louisville. While it is evident that the\nWest End certainly isn't the only place in the city with\nconcentrations of vacant properties, the map does\nmake it clear that the problem is acutely concentrated\nwest of 9th Street, a fact confirmed by analysis of open\ndatasets provided by Louisville Metro. Though the\nproperties listed in the OpportunitySpace database of\nlandbank properties are more acutely concentrated in\nthe West End neighborhoods of Portland, Russell and\nPark Hill, this city-produced heatmap seems to expand\nthe scope of the problem to encompass practically the\nentire West End as a whole.\nThat being said, this map doesn't simply represent\nthe geography of vacant properties in the city, but it\nalso works to produce a particular, and I would argue\noverly simplistic, socio-spatial imaginary of inequality\nin Louisville, one that in turn re-produces the territorial\nstigma developed around the West End. Because the\ncontours of the map place the most significant concen-\ntrations squarely within the conventional boundaries of\nthe West End, the problem of vacant properties is quite\neasily extrapolated to be just one part of the broader\nproblem presented by the West End and encapsulated\nin the imaginary of the 9th Street Divide. Even though\nthese kinds of public-facing, interactive web map inter-\nfaces have been thought to provide an alternative form\nof knowledge politics, emphasizing a kind of ``knowing\nthrough exploring [that] stands in contrast to the carto-\ngraphic narratives approach that relies more upon a\n`receive and believe' paradigm'' (Elwood and\ncases of vacant property mapping in Louisville do any-\nthing but. Even though there always remains an open\npossibility of the same, ostensibly authoritative, map\nbeing interpreted differently by different people (cf.\nElwood, 2006), the structuring of these maps, and the\ninability of users to contribute to, or reconfigure, or\ncross-reference the data being represented in these\ncases, tends to minimize such possibilities for alterna-\ntive forms of knowledge production. Instead, following\nElwood and Mitchell (2013), we can see these represen-\ntations serving as sites for both ``the formation of pol-\nitical subjects [and] the formation of interpretive frames\nthat can mobilize these subjects for action'', although in\na manner that channels the map reader into a single\ninterpretive frame, rather than allowing for a plurality\nof representations. In this case, these visualizations\nreinforce what Wacquant et al. call ``the mistake of\nartificially insulating the poor in social space'' (2014:\n1271), reifying the `blemish of place' associated with\nliving in a predominantly poor and African-American\narea such as the West End. In effect, these kinds of\nvisualizations implicitly blame the people living there\nfor everything from redlining to property speculation\nand the foreclosure crisis that fed into the production of\nthe city's vacant property problem, cordoning off such\nareas from their surrounding social and spatial context\nin order to understand them as somehow separate and\napart from the rest of the city, despite the fact that\nmany of these problems originate in the desires and\nactions of more affluent whites living elsewhere in\nthe city (or even outside of it altogether). As Doreen\nMassey has written ``How many times has the\n`inner city problem' been `explained' in terms of char-\nacteristics totally internal to those areas?--to a sup-\nposed lack of skilled labor, to the actions of planners,\nor, worst of all, to the psychological propensities and\nsociological characteristics of their inhabitants?''\nBy seeing these problems as restricted to a particular\nterritory, and as the result of an engrained socio-spatial\npathology, the logical solutions offered by civic leaders\nrarely, if ever, address the root causes of these prob-\nlems. From larger scale projects like the building of a\nWal-Mart and a methane biodigester plant in the area\nto the more piecemeal efforts associated with the Lots\nof Possibility competition and one local developer's\nartist-led gentrification of vacant shotgun houses in\nthe Portland neighborhood, the reproduction of the\n`reputational ghetto' becomes itself the impetus for par-\nticular kinds of `revitalization' initiatives (Slater and\nment around the way that maps can prescribe policies\nof planned shrinkage and the withdrawal of services\nfrom already neglected urban areas, these maps actu-\nally promote more active engagements with the West\nEnd, albeit still in a way that tends to disempower\nexisting residents in favor of outsiders with capital\nwho are privileged in municipal decision-making\nprocesses.\nBut the use of data in order to map and track vacant\nproperties in Louisville is less than straightforward.\nDespite Mayor Fischer's plan to reduce the number\nof vacant properties by a certain percentage at certain\ntimes, the actual numbers of vacant properties provided\nby the city have been described by some as ``just\nguesses'' that are divorced from the on-the-ground real-\nity of the city's vacant properties problem (Carter,\n2013). Because the classification of vacancy and aban-\ndonment by the Metro government relies on a series of\ndiscrete indicators, such as properties without water\nservice, with unaddressed code violations or unpaid\nproperty taxes, there is a tendency to undercount the\nnumber of properties that may actually be vacant or\n10 Big Data & Society\nabandoned at any given time. One community organ-\nization's on-the-ground participatory mapping project\nfound that Metro government was underestimating the\nnumber of vacant properties in some neighborhoods by\nor comprehensive counts of the city's vacant properties\nmay only show the problem to be further concentrated\nin the West End, this contention over the actual way\nthat vacant properties are counted in order to be\nmapped ``highlights that data is never simply an object-\nive representation of the world and always a possible\nforum for political contestation'' (Shelton et al., 2015b:\n18). It also further underscores a key element of the\nperformativity thesis as applied to the question of the\nproduction of urban territories: data need not be\nentirely accurate in order to produce an actionable\nunderstanding of particular spaces and social processes.\nUnlike the reimagining of the urban at the core of\nWest and Bettencourt's new urban science, which nat-\nuralizes the status quo for the sake of non-intervention,\nthese maps of vacant properties in Louisville seem to\npresuppose intervention by positioning the question of\nvacant properties as a kind of information problem.\nOpportunitySpace is explicitly conceived of as a way\nto encourage private investments in vacant and\nabandoned properties by providing otherwise difficult-\nto-access information to potential investors.\nImportantly, however, OpportunitySpace isn't targeted\nat, for instance, the long-term residents of the West End\nwho are surrounded by vacant properties and must live\nwith their deleterious effects, but rather at a largely\nwhite, middle-class population from outside these\nneighborhoods who are able to capitalize on the\nlonger-term disinvestment occurring in the West End\nin order to benefit themselves and realize their own\nvisions for what the West End ought to look like.\nAnd though the Louisville Metro Government's heat-\nmap of vacant properties is less directly tied to a par-\nticular kind of intervention, the reproduction of a\nsocio-spatial imaginary that sees the West End as some-\nhow separated from the rest of the city, as a kind of\n`problem area', helps to justify practically any policy\nintervention into it, even if these interventions tend to\naddress the symptoms or effects rather than the causes.\nConclusion\nUltimately, this paper has argued that despite the\nimportance of Big Data as both a discourse and prac-\ntice to emerging forms of urban research and manage-\nment, there is no singular or universal understanding of\nthe urban that is promoted or developed through the\napplication of these new sources of data. Like contem-\nporary conceptualizations of both the urban (Robinson\nand Roy, 2016) and Big Data (Kitchin and McArdle,\n2016), more generally, the urban geographical imagin-\nation in the age of Big Data is complex, contradictory\nand highly variegated, operating across multiple scales\nthrough different kinds of interpersonal and institu-\ntional networks. Despite claims that ``with enough\ndata, the numbers speak for themselves'' (Anderson,\n2008), providing a single, optimal understanding of\nany given social phenomenon, the data-driven urban\ngeographical imagination causes us to understand the\ncity simultaneously as something both fundamentally\nunchangeable, as in the work of West and\nBettencourt, and as something imminently intervene-\nable (assuming we have access to the right informa-\ntion), as demonstrated by the case of vacant property\nmapping in Louisville. Setting aside the pervasive issues\nof data quality that are seen in both of the cases dis-\ncussed above, this contradiction between the vision of\ndata `speaking for itself' and the reality of a plurality of\nvoices emanating from different mobilizations of data,\npoints towards a fundamental flaw in the belief that\ndata necessarily leads to improved understandings of\ncities, or any other given phenomena. Regardless of\nthese contradictions, there remains a general tendency\nin these particular strands of data-driven analysis to\nneglect the fundamental underlying processes at work,\nisolating the issue in question from broader social and\nspatial contexts that influence the outcomes of any\ngiven intervention. Despite Big Data's\nrelationality--understood in this instance as the ability\nto combine and cross-reference disparate\ndatasets--dominant usages and interpretations of\nsuch data remain fundamentally non-relational in the\nsocial sense, failing to identify or understand the con-\nnections between seemingly separate or isolated\nphenomena.\nWhile these dominant data-driven imaginaries have\nlargely failed to produce a substantively better under-\nstanding of urban processes, these kinds of intellectual\nprojects have accomplished something akin to what\nTimothy Mitchell describes as the ``transferr[al of]\nthis knowledge to new sites . . . open[ing] up a certain\ndistance, the distance between the field and the comput-\ning office, between the farmer and the colonial survey\nofficer, between the iron triangulation marker and the\nledge is increasingly removed from the urban itself,\ncodified only in a series of quantifiable measures that\nallow for an increasingly detached, and putatively\nobjective and scientific understanding of its true\nessence. As with earlier attempts to understand cities\nthrough scientific methods, it is unlikely that many of\nthese experiments in applying Big Data to our under-\nstandings of the city will reveal previously unforeseen\ninsights (Light, 2003). It is almost assured, however,\nthat these new ways of studying and intervening in\nurban processes will reshape our conceptions of how\ncities ought to be understood and planned, resulting\nin a privileging of new forms of data and methods of\nanalysis at the expense of more historically and geo-\ngraphically complex and grounded insights.\nOf course, just as historical connections between\nquantitative methodologies, positivist epistemologies\nand reactionary politics were contingent circumstances\n(Wyly, 2009), so too is the contemporary constellation\nof smart cities, urban science, and other urban data\ninitiatives. While the above vignettes highlight the\nways that dominant mobilizations of data tend to\ndepoliticize certain ways of understanding and inter-\nvening in urban spaces, many of the same sources of\ndata and new mapping technologies offer significant\npotential for pushing back against such representa-\ntions. From the speculative mappings of Neil\nBrenner's Urban Theory Lab (cf. Katsikis, 2014;\nUrban Theory Lab-GSD, 2013), which demonstrate\nthe incredibly partial understanding of the urban pro-\nmoted by the likes of West and Bettencourt, or\nattempts to connect the seemingly discrete, segregated\nspaces of Louisville's West End to the broader social\nand spatial context that gave rise to problems like\nthose of vacant properties (cf. Shelton, 2015; Shelton\nmappings of the West End and the geographies of\nLouisville's vacant properties problem), mapping and\ndata visualization maintains a significant potential for\nshaping more complex and emancipatory understand-\nings of urban space.2 So while the production of the\ndata-driven urban geographical imaginary may tend\ntowards a kind of post-political naturalization of the\ncontemporary urban condition, such an imaginary is\nin no way inherent or uncontested. Indeed, through\nthe creative analysis and visualization of these new\nsources of data, alternative understandings and inter-\nventions can be proposed and pursued, potentially\nenabling more democratic and egalitarian ways of\nactually producing the urban as we know and experi-\nence it.\n"
