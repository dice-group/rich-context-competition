Identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 paved the way\nfor personalized medicine and created a new paradigm for\nhereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome diag-\nnosis and prevention (Easton, Ford, & Bishop, 1995; Ford\net al., 1998). Likewise, discovery of the molecular basis of\nLynch syndrome led to a clearer definition of the syndrome's\nclinical spectrum and improved our ability to identify individ-\nuals at high risk of hereditary colon and endometrial cancers\n(Espenschied et al., 2017). Identification of mutation carriers is\ncritical, as it enables the administration of interventions that\nare proven to confer significant survival benefits, particularly\nfor highly penetrant genetic mutations (Domchek, Friebel,\nBeyond these two well-known syndromes, numerous other\ngenes associated with hereditary cancer syndromes have been\nidentified in recent years. Concurrently, advances in next-\ngeneration sequencing (NGS) technology have made it possible\nto test multiple genes simultaneously. Inherited cancer testing\nis now being offered by a variety of specialists in a multitude of\nclinical settings for both affected and unaffected individuals\nGenetic counseling and testing is often performed by health-\ncare providers with specialized training in clinical genetics.\nThese providers include board-certified genetic counselors,\nboard-certified clinical geneticists, and advanced practice\ngenetic nurses who are certified by the American Nursing\nCredentialing Center based on minimum practice hours within\nthe specialty and continuing education hours (www.nursecre\ndentialing.org). However, because of their consistent and sus-\ntained interactions with patients, nurses of various backgrounds\nare well positioned to educate, support, and advocate for\npatients throughout the genetic testing process by effectively\nobtaining family histories, identifying test candidates, helping\npatients and families understand results, and incorporating\ngenetic test results into ongoing care (Calzone et al., 2010).\nAll registered nurses have received broad training in genetics,\nwhile master's-level nurses achieve a more rigorous set of\ngenetic and genomic proficiencies (www.ncsbn.org), but given\nthe rapid changes in this field, ongoing education is imperative.\nThis article reviews how multigene testing is performed using\nNGS technology and highlights counseling considerations\nassociated with multigene hereditary cancer testing.\nOverview of Sequencing Technologies\nNGS refers to a collection of technologies that allow for the\nparallel sequencing of millions of DNA fragments.

Traditional Sanger sequencing compared with next-generation sequencing technology. In each method, dyed, unextendable bases are\nutilized to create a fluorescent signal that can be translated into a sequence of nucleotides. Subtle differences in the two methods lead to vast\ndifferences in throughput. This image was reproduced from figure 1 in Muzzey, Evans, and Lieber (2015).

NGS sequencers\ncan perform hundreds of such cycles, yielding millions of\nDNA-fragment sequences, each up to several hundred bases\nin length. Although at the molecular level NGS and Sanger\ntechnologies subtly differ, this difference makes NGS clini-\ncally groundbreaking. NGS throughput and quality has greatly\ndecreased both the cost and time involved in sequencing,\nallowing patients access to testing for multiple genes at a frac-\ntion of the cost of traditional single-gene testing.\nDepth of Coverage on NGS\nThe goal of genetic testing is to resolve the sequence of a\npatient's genes such that any pathogenic mutations can be\nidentified. Therefore, it is important to sequence molecules\noriginating from each chromosome many times over to have\nconfidence in the result. Depth, or coverage, refers to the num-\nber of sequenced fragments that are generated from a given site\nin the genome or simply the number of times a certain base was\nsequenced. In general, as depth increases, so does the confi-\ndence that the identified mutation is real. Most commercial\nlaboratories establish a minimum depth between 20\u00c2 and\n50\u00c2 for targeted inherited cancer panels, which means that at\neach genomic position, a base is read at least 20\u00ad50 times\nVariant Identification and Classification\nPathogenic mutations can occur when nucleotides, varying\nfrom a single base to thousands, are altered, inserted, or deleted\n(Figure 2). Any sequencing method used for clinical testing\nmust be able to identify this wide variety of mutation types\nthat can lead to human disease. Once a genetic alteration is\nidentified, a laboratory must then determine the biological sig-\nnificance of that alteration through the process of variant cura-\ntion. The American College of Medical Genetics and\nGenomics (ACMG) sets standards for classifying genetic\nalterations into five categories: pathogenic, likely pathogenic,\nuncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. These clas-\nsifications are based on multiple lines of evidence including\npublic and private databases as well as population, computa-\ntional, functional, segregation, de novo, and allelic data\n(Richards et al., 2015). Because of the difficulty of developing\nrigid guidelines that encompass all nuances of genetic varia-\ntion, there is the potential for differences in classifications\nbetween laboratories, and based on analysis of public database\nsubmissions, such differences in classification have occurred\n(Gradishar, Johnson, Brown, Mundt, & Manley, 2017). How-\never, authors report overall high interlaboratory concordance\nfor hereditary cancer results when the clinical actionability of a\nvariant and quality of a database submission is considered\n(Lincoln et al., 2017). Concordance will continue to increase\nwith ongoing data sharing efforts among researchers and\ncommercial laboratories. Genomic data sharing, through con-\ntribution to public databases such as ClinVar (www.ncbi.nlm.\nnih.gov/clinvar), is supported by ACMG as a crucial practice\nin improving genomic health care (ACMG Board of Directors,\nConfirmation of NGS Findings\nIn its early usage, NGS was limited by low depth of coverage\nand error rates that were unsuitable for routine clinical testing.\nConfirmation of results through traditional methods, such as\nSanger sequencing, was common laboratory practice. Although\nNGS can now be optimized for low error rates and high depth\nof coverage, some laboratories still rely on orthogonal confir-\nmation of positive findings (Chong et al., 2014; Judkins et al.,\nstudy, authors analyzed data from 20,000 clinical samples\nFigure 2. Next-generation sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome demonstrate two mutation types: a single-nucleotide polymorph-\nism where a guanine has replaced a thymine and, further downstream, a deletion of an adenine.

However, many other\nreports have demonstrated that NGS alone produces results\nwith high sensitivity and specificity and that the need for ortho-\ngonal confirmation is dependent on the specific NGS assay and\nis not a general limitation of all NGS protocols (Beck,\net al., 2017). Nonetheless, the purpose of orthogonal confirma-\ntion is to reduce false positives. It is important, therefore, for\nlaboratories to establish a protocol for addressing the potential\nfor such results, especially in difficult-to-sequence regions of\nthe genome, and to demonstrate the efficacy of these protocols\nin published validation studies (Mu et al., 2016).\nAssessing Quality of NGS Testing\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Clinical\nLaboratory Improvement Amendment program stipulates stan-\ndards for analytic validity of NGS assays but does not address\nthe accuracy of individual aspects of these methods such as\ndepth of coverage, bioinformatics for variant calling, results\ninterpretation, or reporting (Robson et al., 2015). Most com-\nmercially available assays report greater than 99% sensitivity,\nspecificity, and accuracy but use varying methods to achieve\nto carefully select a laboratory for testing but give little gui-\ndance for how to assess laboratory quality (Fecteau, Vogel,\nHanson, & Morrill-Cornelius, 2014). Laboratories can demon-\nstrate their test performance through a published validation\nstudy. Analytical sensitivity, analytic specificity, repeatability,\nand reproducibility are all characteristics that a test validation\nOverview of Multigene Testing\nMultigene testing for cancer susceptibility became commer-\nmany laboratories now offer these tests using similar NGS\ntechnologies, panel design (e.g., panel size, how genes are\nselected for inclusion, design of syndrome-specific panels) can\nvary greatly between laboratories (Cragun et al., 2014;\nDomchek, Bradbury, Garber, Offit, & Robson, 2013; Hall\nCancer Network (NCCN) recommends consideration of multi-\ngene testing when a patient's personal and/or family history is\nsuggestive of an inherited cancer syndrome that could be caused\nby more than one gene or when an individual has tested negative\nfor a single syndrome, but their personal and/or family history\nremains suggestive of an inherited cause (NCCN, 2017). How-\never, due to decreasing cost and turnaround time, multigene\npanels are more often being used as a first-line test for any\npatient suspected to have an inherited cancer syndrome.\nAlthough BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most recognized her-\neditary cancer genes, mutations in these genes only account for\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that multigene testing\nidentifies more individuals with hereditary breast cancer than\ntesting for BRCA1/2 alone. For individuals suspected of having\nhereditary breast cancer who previously tested negative for\nBRCA1/2, testing for additional genes results in a positive\nAnother common indication for hereditary cancer testing is a\npersonal or family history of colon cancer. In the first large clin-\nical series of patients tested for inherited colorectal cancer (CRC)\nwith multigene panel testing, 10% of high-risk patients tested\npositive for a mutation in 1 of the 14 genes associated with nine\nCRC syndromes; the majority of these results were expected to\nchange clinical management (Cragun et al., 2014). In a larger,\nsubsequent series, 1,260 patients with suspected Lynch syndrome\nhaveapathogenicmutation;38% ofmutationswereinnon-Lynch\nOverlapping phenotypes and complex guidelines may lead\nto patients being missed with the traditional single-gene testing\napproach. In a study of 9,000 individuals referred for hereditary\ncancer testing, 30% of patients tested for Lynch syndrome also\nmet criteria for HBOC testing, and inversely, 7% of patients\nsent for HBOC testing also met criteria for Lynch syndrome\ntesting (Saam et al., 2015). Multigene tests may offer a simpli-\nfied and efficient option for clinicians needing to select appro-\npriate genes for a given patient. A growing body of evidence\nalso suggests that adhering to a guidelines-based approach,\ntesting solely for a gene or syndrome for which a patient meets\ncriteria, can lead to missed mutations. In a study of 475 patients\nreferred for genetic counseling and testing at an academic cen-\nter, 15.6% were positive for a mutation identified through mul-\ntigene testing (Ricker et al., 2016). Based on provider-recorded\ndifferential diagnoses, the authors determined that nearly half\nof these mutations (47.3%) would have been missed with a\nsingle-gene, stepwise approach. The potential missed muta-\ntions included those in high-penetrance genes with atypical\npresentations as well as those in moderate-penetrance genes\nwhere the phenotype is less well defined. Other studies have\nreported similar findings, with 6.6\u00ad17% of individuals referred\nfor multigene testing being found to carry a pathogenic muta-\ntion in at least one gene (LaDuca et al., 2014; Selkirk et al.,\nDespite the advantages of multigene testing, some argue that\nnew DNA testing technology is outpacing evidence for clinical\nutility and consideration of proper implementation. Multigene\ntests may include genes with ill-defined lifetime cancer risks,\nunclear clinical management guidance, and increased rates of\nresults with uncertain significance (Axilbund, 2016; Domchek\nstudies with large sample sizes are needed to demonstrate the\nclinical validity and clinical utility of multigene testing (Easton\nCategories of Risk\nCancer predisposition genes included on multigene tests can be\ngrouped into three categories of disease penetrance: high, mod-\nerate, and low. There is also a growing category of genes that\nhave been associated with risk of cancer, but the magnitude of\nthis risk is unknown due to limited available data.\nThe likelihoods of the development of cancer due to genetic\nmutations can be discussed in terms of relative risk (RR) or\nlifetime risk (LTR). RR, also called a risk ratio, is the like-\nlihood of an event's occurrence in one group compared with\nthat in another group. For example, the RR of developing breast\nmeaning that a woman with a pathogenic PALB2 mutation is\n5.3 times more likely to develop breast cancer compared to a\nwoman in the general population. Absolute risk refers to the\nprobability of an event happening over a defined period of\ntime, for example, the likelihood of breast cancer manifestation\nin the next 5 years or over a lifetime.\nCalculations of lifetime cancer risks are influenced by risk\nfactors, such as family history, environmental exposures, or\nhormonal factors, and can overestimate risk of genes where\nrisk ratio may decrease as carriers age (Easton et al., 2015).\nHowever, absolute risks may be more relevant in clinical prac-\ntice since guidelines cite 5-year risk and LTR in recommenda-\ntions for interventions such as chemoprevention and magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) screening for breast cancer (Saslow\net al., 2007). Table 1 displays a list of genes commonly found\non multigene cancer tests and respective lifetime cancer risks.\nIt is important to note that individuals who test negative for a\ngenetic mutation may still have an elevated risk of cancer based\non personal or family history. Multiple risk models are avail-\nable to calculate breast cancer risk in families who do not\nharbor an identifiable mutation (e.g., Claus model, Claus,\nRisch, & Thompson, 1994, Tyrer\u00adCuzick model). However,\ncurrent risk models have limitations, and it is important to\nunderstand the specific limitations of each model when calcu-\nlating risk of a given patient (Amir, Freedman, Seruga, &\nAlthough risk categories are somewhat arbitrary, high pene-\ntrance describes genes conferring an RR greater than 4 times\nthe risk of the general population (Easton et al., 2015). Exam-\n2\u00ad4 times the general population risk. Examples include\nEaston et al., 2015). Genes that confer cancer risks less than 2\ntimes the general population risk may be referred to as low-\npenetrance genes or risk alleles. Most commercially available\nmultigene tests include only moderate- and high-penetrance\ngenes. However, not all mutations within a moderate- or\nhigh-penetrance gene confer equal risks of cancer. For exam-\nple, a common mutation in CHEK2, 1100delC, confers an\napproximate 3-fold RR of breast cancer (Weischer, Bojesen,\nEllervik, Tybj\u00e6rg-Hansen, & Nordestgaard, 2008), but another\nwell-documented mutation in the same gene, I157T, is\nassociated with only a 1.58-fold RR of breast cancer (Han,\nAlthough it is controversial, many commercially available\ninherited cancer panels also include genes with limited or\nconflicting evidence for association with cancer risk and the\nmagnitude of that risk. For example, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1\n(MRN) complex, which includes the genes MRE11A, RAD50,\nand NBN, is involved in double-strand break repairs. Data have\nshown that mutations in genes that make up the MRN complex\nconfer either a moderately increased risk of breast cancer\n(Damiola et al., 2014) or no increased risk (Couch et al.,\n2017). All three genes are included on many multigene cancer\ntests, but currently, only the NBN gene has corresponding con-\nsensus guidelines for management (NCCN, 2017). More stud-\nies are needed to establish the appropriate evidence threshold\nfor inclusion of a specific gene in clinical testing.\nCounseling Considerations\nAlthough NGS technology has brought significant benefit to\nclinical genetics, genetic counseling in the era of panel testing\ncan be more complex than for single-gene testing. These com-\nplexities come in the form of new challenges but more com-\nmonly stem from traditional challenges in genetic counseling\nthat are amplified by testing for many genes simultaneously. It\nis important that all clinicians who order hereditary cancer\npanels are equipped with the knowledge to navigate these com-\nplexities, stay up to date with rapidly changing guidelines, and\nmaintain a network of genetics professionals to refer patients to\nwhen required.\nPretest Education and Informed Consent Considerations\nThe informed consent process for genetic testing, whether for\nsingle-gene testing or multigene testing, requires the same\nbasic elements: description of its purpose, general information\nabout the genes being tested, potential test results, accuracy,\nfinancial considerations, potential for genetic discrimination,\nconfidentiality, actionability of test results for patient and fam-\nily members, psychological implications of a test result, and\nalternatives to genetic testing (Riley et al., 2012). Health-care\nproviders or genetics professionals may want to consider mod-\nifying this traditional approach to informed consent in the case\nof multigene testing to ensure that patients have a high-level\nunderstanding of the genes for which they are being tested as\nwell as a heightened awareness of the potential to find an\nunexpected, uncertain, or unclear result (Robson et al., 2015).\nPretest counseling for single-gene or single-syndrome test-\ning historically included a comprehensive discussion of the\nhereditary cancer gene(s) for which the patient is being tested.\nFor example, a candidate for Lynch syndrome testing may have\nformerly received a detailed explanation of each of the genes\nassociated with Lynch syndrome, the cancer risks associated\nwith a positive result in each gene, as well as the medical\nmanagement guidelines for carriers. In order to remain\neffective, pretest counseling for multigene tests requires\nTable 1.

Instead, bucketing genes into categories of risk can\nprovide the necessary education without information overload\nDiscussing the potential for uncertain findings has been an\nintegral part of pretest education and informed consent since\nthe beginning of clinical testing for hereditary cancer (Petru-\nvariant of uncertain significance (VUS) rate for BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 alone was as high as 12.8%, but it decreased to 2.1% as\nknowledge accumulated on the effects of specific genetic\nalterations (Eggington et al., 2014). The likelihood for a VUS\nto be identified on a multigene cancer test varies based on many\nfactors including the number of genes tested, the quantity of the\nregion of interest being sequenced (i.e., how much of the\nintrons, or noncoding region, is included), and the ethnic diver-\nsity of the population being tested, but it can range from 19.7%\npatients for the possibility of an uncertain result prior to testing\nmay help to normalize this result and alleviate patient anxiety\nwhen a VUS is identified. It is important to recognize that, as\nlabs and clinicians collaborate and participate in broad data\nsharing practices, VUS rates will continue to decrease, which\nwill benefit patient care in genetics (ACMG Board of\nThe potential for genetic discrimination is another aspect of\npretest counseling that is not new but has become a more\nimportant issue as more individuals, particularly those who\nhave not had cancer, gain access to genetic testing services.\nMultigene tests are more likely to return a positive result than\nsingle-gene tests and therefore may introduce more potential\nfor genetic discrimination. The Genetic Information Nondiscri-\nmination Act (GINA) is a federal law passed in 2008 that\nprovides protections against genetic discrimination in health\ninsurance and employment. The law disallows use of genetic\ninformation by a health insurer to make determinations about\npremiums and states that health insurers may not require sub-\nscribers undergo genetic testing. The law does have some\nlimitations in its protections. For example, GINA does not\napply to life insurance, long-term care insurance, or disability\ninsurance. It also does not apply to employers with fewer than\n15 employees, members of the U.S. military, veterans acces-\nsing health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs, or federal employees enrolled in the Federal\nEmployees Health Benefits program (The GINA, 2008). The\nAffordable Care Act, the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act, and numerous state laws provide addi-\ntional protections against genetic discrimination in health\ninsurance (National Human Genome Research Institute,\n2017). It is important to discuss the protections, and the limita-\ntions in protections, with patients prior to their undergoing\ngenetic testing.\nPosttest Counseling Considerations\nPosttest, a discussion with a patient on results includes sensi-\ntivity, specificity, and limitations of the test; the patient's can-\ncer risks based on the result; medical management\nrecommendations; and implications for family members.\nReferral to other health-care providers as well as assessment\nof psychological impacts and provision of emotional support\ncan also be vital parts of this process (Riley et al., 2012).\nSimilar to pretest counseling, posttest counseling with multi-\ngene testing is at the core very similar to that for single-gene\ntesting, but it does pose a few unique challenges.\nIdentifying unexpected results. While rare, \"unexpected findings\"\noccur when individuals test positive for a mutation in a gene\nthat is not associated with their personal or family history. For\nexample, pathogenic mutations in CDH1 are associated with\nincreased risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer and lobular\nbreast cancer (Pharoah, Guilford, Caldas, & the International\nGastric Cancer Linkage Consortium, 2001), and experts rec-\nommend genetic testing in families that have multiple cases of\ndiffuse gastric cancer, diffuse gastric cancer diagnosed in an\nindividual younger than 40 years of age, or individuals with a\npersonal history of both diffuse gastric cancer and lobular\nTable 2.

It is not possible to effectively screen for all cancer risks conferred by a high-penetrance\ngene. For example, TP53 mutations cause risk of many cancer types, and screening options are of unknown efficacy.\nbreast cancer (Fitzgerald et al., 2010). However, since\npan-cancer multigene tests have become available, there have\nbeen multiple case reports of patients found to carry pathogenic\nmutations in CDH1 with no reported personal or family history\nof diffuse gastric cancer (Huynh & Laukaitis 2016). Risks of\ncancer and guidelines for management of individuals with\nCDH1 mutations were developed based on data from families\nwith significant histories of gastric cancer. It is unclear whether\nCDH1 carriers without a significant history have the same risks\nand should be managed in the same way. The conservative\napproach, guided by studies of BRCA mutations identified in\nlow-risk families (Gabai-Kapara et al., 2014), assumes the\nsame level of cancer risk of any CDH1 mutation carrier, but\nmore studies are needed to better understand the appropriate\nmanagement of these individuals and individuals in other fam-\nilies with unexpected findings from multigene testing.\nPathogenic mutations in multiple genes. Multigene testing intro-\nduces the possibility of identifying pathogenic mutations in\nmultiple genes in one individual. In a cohort of more than\n2,000 patients, investigators found that 2.9% carried two patho-\ngenic mutations (LaDuca et al., 2014). Although this finding\nsuggests that individuals with known familial mutations iden-\ntified by single-gene testing may still benefit from a multigene\ntest, limited data exist to guide the management of individuals\nwith more than one inherited cancer predisposition syndrome.\nLarge, prospective studies are needed to define cancer risks in\nindividuals who carry mutations in two or more genes, so that\nappropriate management recommendations can be developed.\nIn the meantime, management of both syndromes according to\ntheir independent guidelines is a reasonable approach.\nManagement and moderate-penetrance genes. Many moderate-\npenetrance genes, like CHEK2, were discovered long before\nclinical testing of these genes was common (Meijers-Heijboer\net al., 2002). With single-gene testing, limited value was out-\nweighed by incremental cost. NGS technology allows these\ngenes to be included in multigene tests with little additional\ncost. While the addition of moderate-penetrance genes to mul-\ntigene cancer tests preceded the existence of clinical manage-\nment guidelines, experts have now established a framework for\ncounseling carriers about their risk (NCCN, 2017; Tung,\nDomchek, et al., 2016). However, while guidelines for manag-\ning carriers develop, establishment of cancer risks of family\nmembers remains challenging. Prior studies support that when\na family member tests negative for a known familial high-\npenetrance mutation, like a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, they\nare considered to be a \"true negative\" and their risk of cancer\napproaches that of the general population regardless of family\nhistory (Domchek, Gaudet, et al., 2010). It may not be appro-\npriate to apply this same approach to moderate-penetrance\ngenes. Moderate-penetrance genes, like ATM, may not account\nfor all cancer risk in a family, as gene/gene and gene/environ-\nment interactions may also contribute (NCCN, 2017). For this\nreason, family members who test negative for a familial\nmoderate-penetrance mutation may still have an increased risk\nof cancer based on their personal and family history and should\nbe counseled accordingly (Tung, Domchek, et al., 2016).\nInclusion of genes with limited or conflicting evidence of\ncancer risk can pose additional challenges to multigene testing.\nConsensus guidelines state that genetic testing is most appro-\npriate when results of testing will have a direct impact on the\nmedical management of the patient or their family members\n(NCCN, 2017). Therefore, genetic testing with a guidelines-\nbased panel is a reasonable approach. Genes that have uncer-\ntain clinical utility should be included in clinical testing with\ncaution, and the involvement of a provider with expertise in\ncancer genetics and risk assessment is important in these cir-\nCounseling about variants of uncertain significance. Rates for VUS\nidentified on multigene hereditary cancer panels range from\none report of a VUS rate of 88% for a 42-gene panel (Kurian\net al., 2014). Although multigene panels have higher VUS rates\nthan traditional single-gene testing, posttest counseling and\nmanagement of patients with VUS identified with either tech-\nnology are similar. Because most VUS results that are reclas-\nsified are found to be benign, VUS results should not be used to\nalter clinical management (Easton et al., 2007). Instead, a\npatient with a VUS should receive individualized recommen-\ndations based on their personal and family history (NCCN,\nTable 3.

Providers can encourage patients to enroll in research\nstudies that are working collaboratively toward improved inter-\npretation of genetic variants such as ClinGen (www.clinicalgen\nome.org), PROMPT (www.promptstudy.info), ENIGMA\n(www.enigmaconsortium.org), or InSIGHT (www.insight-\ngroup.org).\nCounseling for reproductive risks. Discussion of reproductive risks\nwith carriers is another complex issue that is not unique to, but\nmay be increasing in frequency because of, multigene testing.\nMany genes cause increased risk of cancer when carriers inherit\none mutation from one parent but lead to a different genetic\nsyndrome when they inherit two mutations, one from each par-\nent. Reproductive risks should be discussed with carriers of\nmutations in the genes in Table 3, and carriers should be made\naware of the availability of partner testing to clarify the risk of\nconceiving a child with a clinically distinct genetic condition.\nOngoing Communication\nProviders ordering hereditary cancer testing of any type must\nbe aware of changing guidelines, and this imperative is espe-\ncially true for multigene panel testing. Patients' family his-\ntories, guidelines for testing criteria, interpretation of\nvariants, and management recommendations for mutation car-\nriers are all evolving. Clinicians must establish a protocol to\nensure that patients have access to current recommendations\nsurrounding their hereditary cancer risk.\nConclusions\nMultigene testing allows for increased detection of hereditary\ncancer syndromes by utilizing the benefits of high-throughput\nNGS. Genetic counseling complexities may arise on a more\nfrequent basis with panel testing; however, these challenges\nare not novel to counseling for inherited cancer. Nurses of all\nlevels and specialties can play an integral role in identifying,\ntesting, and managing patients with inherited risk of cancer. All\nhealth-care professionals who offer inherited cancer testing\nmust engage in ongoing education as the field is continuously\nevolving as new data become available. Future research oppor-\ntunities are many in this field and include analysis of clinical\nutility for moderate-penetrance genes, delineation of cancer\nrisks and management for individuals positive for mutations\nin multiple genes, development of robust standards to assess\nlab quality, and data collection to further refine cancer risks\nconferred by more newly described genes, especially in diverse\npopulations. While these data will undoubtedly improve upon\nthe usefulness of multigene testing, the current landscape rep-\nresents an opportunity to expand the number of individuals who\ncan receive timely and appropriate clinical guidance.\n"
