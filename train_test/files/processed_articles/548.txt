Despite frequent media coverage and increas-\ning scholarly writings on China's air pollution threats,\ncomprehensive analysis of the air pollution and health link\nis not adequate. A handful of studies (5\u00ad7) relied on eco-\nlogical time-series data to evaluate the effects of air pollu-\ntion on aggregate health in China. There is a need for\ngreater clarity on health effects at the individual level.\nMoreover, in order to detect chronic effects of air pollution\non health, it is essential to conduct prospective studies using\nlongitudinal surveys to characterize how exposure to air\npollution is subsequently linked to health and mortality.\nThis type of research has emerged in the West (8\u00ad11),\nalthough still inadequate in general and much lacking in\nAlthough adverse health effects of air pollutants appear\nto affect all age groups (13\u00ad16), there has been a recent call\nfor a focus on air pollution research in the elderly popula-\ntion as they are the principal group at risk for morbidity and\nmortality and are particularly vulnerable to air pollutants\n(17). With the aging trends sweeping across developing and\ndeveloped societies including China, healthy longevity is\nbecoming a growingly important goal for older adults, their\nfamilies, and the society as a whole. Hence, modifiable\nenvironmental factors of health, mortality or life expectancy\n(LE), and health expectancy (HE; the average lifetime that a\nperson can expect to live without a health condition) should\nbe rigorously investigated in different settings with results\ndisseminated to the public, environmental activists, and\npolicy makers.\nAir Pollution Shortens Life Expectancy and Health\nExpectancy for Older Adults: The Case of China\nMing Wen1 and Danan Gu2\n1Department of Sociology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City.\n2Department of Economics and Social Affairs, Population Division, United Nations, New York, New York.\nAddress correspondence to Danan Gu, PhD, Population Division, United Nations, Two United Nations Plaza, DC2-1910, New York, NY 10017.\nEmail: gudanan@yahoo.com\nBackground. Outdoor air pollution is one of the most worrying environmental threats China faces today. Comprehen-\nsive and quantitative analyses of the health consequences of air pollution in China are lacking. This study reports age- and\nsex-specific life expectancy and health expectancies (HEs) corresponding to different levels of air pollution based on\nassociations between air pollution and individual risks for a host of health conditions and mortality net of individual- and\ncommunity-level confounders.\nMethods. This is a multilevel prospective cohort study based a nationally representative sample of Chinese elders. The\nmain outcome measures in this study include life expectancy estimated from mortality and HEs based on five health\nconditions including activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily living, cognitive status, self-rated health, and\nchronic conditions.\nResults. Net of the controls, exposure to outdoor air pollution corresponded to subsequent reductions of life\nexpectancy and HEs for all five health conditions. These detrimental pollution effects were stronger for women. The gap\nin life expectancy between areas with good air quality and moderately heavily polluted areas was 3.78 years for women\nof age 65 and 0.93 years for men. The differences in HEs at age 65 were also large, ranging from 1.47 years for HE for\ngood self-rated health in men to 5.20 years for activity of daily living disability-free HE in women.\nConclusions. Air pollution has devastating health impacts on Chinese elders reducing longevity and shortening HEs.\nWomen are more vulnerable than men. More strict air policy should be implemented to pursue sustainable development\nin China.\nKey Words: Aging--Air pollution--China--Health expectancy--Life expectancy.\nDecision Editor: Luigi Ferrucci, MD, PhD\nUsing data from a nationally representative longitudinal\nsurvey recently conducted in China, this study reports gender-\nspecific LE and HEs at different ages corresponding to dif-\nferent levels of air pollution based on the associations\nbetween community-level air pollution and individual risks\nfor a host of health conditions and mortality. Many previous\nstudies of environmental epidemiology have focused on\nacute pulmonary or respiratory diseases (18\u00ad23). To the\nbest of our knowledge, this study is one of the first few\nnationally representative studies using prospective multilevel\ndesign to quantify the mid- or long-term effects of outdoor\nair pollution on age- and sex-specific LE and HEs in China.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nData used in this study are from the third and fourth\nwaves of the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey\nfirst two waves, covered 22 provinces in China where more\nthan 85% of the national population resided. Starting from\n2002, the third wave of the CLHLS added younger elders\naged 65\u00ad79 years in addition to those followed-up respon-\ndents. The CLHLS aimed to interview all centenarians in\nthe sampled counties or cities with informed consents. Lists of\ncentenarians were obtained from the local aging institutes.\nFor each centenarian interviewed, one octogenarian, one\nnonagenarian, one septuagenarian, and one person aged\n65\u00ad69 years were randomly chosen to be interviewed based\non a random code assigned to the sampled centenarian. If\nthe random code assigned to a centenarian was an odd\nnumber, one female elder from each of four age groups was\ninterviewed. Otherwise, four male elders were interviewed.\nThe ages of the targeted persons aged 65\u00ad99 years were pre-\ndesignated to match the last digit of the random code of the\nsampled centenarian. If there were no such appropriate tar-\ngeted persons available in the village or street of the sam-\npled centenarian, the CLHLS team recruited respondents\nfrom nearby villages, towns, streets, or city districts. The\nCLHLS is representative of the elderly population in Main-\nland China because the respondents are randomly sampled,\nand the distributions of key variables are comparable to\nthose reported in other national surveys, such as the National\nHealth Service Survey and the Sampling Survey of the\nAged Population in Urban\u00adRural China (24). The CLHLS\ndata include a weight variable reflecting the sampling\ndesign and ensuring the weighted sample distributions to\nmatch those in the population in the 22 sampled provinces\nin terms of age, sex, and urban\u00adrural residence. Therefore,\nweight is always applied when we estimate the distributable\nfrequencies or means for the whole sample. Excluding\nthose centenarians aged 106 years or older whose self-\nreported age is less reliable (25), the 2002 wave interviewed\nwomen and 6, 793 men. Excluding those who died or were\nmation was obtained through in-home interviews. System-\natic assessments of the CLHLS indicate that the data quality\nMeasurements\nAir pollution was measured by the Air Pollution Index\n(API) at the prefecture or city level, shared by individuals\nand communities within the same prefecture or city. API is\nwidely used in environmental research as a measure of the\ngeneral air pollution (28\u00ad30). The China National Environ-\nmental Monitoring Center calculates API to assess the con-\ncentration of five pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen\ndioxide (NO2), particulate matter less than 10 microns in\ndiameter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3)\n(31). These five pollutants are among the most common air\npollutants found in China as well as in other developing\ncountries (32\u00ad34). Air quality of a community is then cate-\ngorized into seven ordinal air pollution levels (APL) with\nlower scores indicating better air quality: excellent (API 0\u00ad50),\nheavily polluted (API  300). We obtained these APL data\nThe detailed procedures of calculating theAPI and converting\nthem to the APL are listed in the Appendix. We focus on\n1995 to capture air pollution exposure because it was the\nonly year during the 1990s that the APL data were publi-\ncally accessible and also because health consequences of air\npollution exposure likely take time to manifest. Research\nhas shown that air pollution could yield significant mid- or\nlong-term effects on health or mortality (11); but the time\nlag or latency period has not been well taken into account in\nthe current literature of air pollution epidemiology, which is\nmore focused on acute or short-term health impacts of air\npollution.\nBased on the CLHLS sample of survivors in 2005, age- to\nsex-specific death rates by the level of air pollution were\nestimated from sex-stratified proportional Cox hazard\nmodels. The CLHLS collected the interview date of the\nfollow-up wave in 2005 for those survivors and the date at\ndeath for those who died during the follow-up. With these\ndeath rates, we used conventional method to construct life\ntables (36) and obtain the age- and sex-specific LEs. As\nshown in Figure 1, the overall age- and sex-specific death\nconsiderably similar to those in the 2000 census. The drop-off\ngenders was likely due to age exaggeration in the 2000 Census\nin this age group (27).\nHealth conditions were measured by five self-reported\nvariables capturing several key dimensions of health in later\nlife: Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activi-\nties of Daily Living (IADL), cognitive impairment, self-\nrated health (SRH), and chronic disease conditions. ADL\nrefers to the following basic personal-care activities: (a)\nbathing, (b) dressing, (c) eating, (d) indoor transferring, (e)\ntoileting, and (f) continence. Because the ADL distribution\nwas highly skewed in this sample, with 66% reporting no\ndifficulty performing any of these activities, we dichoto-\nmized it into \"disabled\" (having at least one ADL limita-\ntion) and \"no limitation,\" with the latter as the reference\ncategory.\nIADL refers to the following activities: (a) visiting neigh-\nbors, (b) shopping, (c) cooking, (d) washing clothes, (e)\nwalking one kilometer, (f) lifting 5 kg, (g) crouching and\nstanding up three times, and (h) taking public transportation.\nChoices for each item were: \"able to do without help,\" \"need\nsome help,\" and \"need full help.\" In a similar vein, we\ndichotomized IADL into disabled (having at least one IADL\nlimitation) and nondisabled.\nCognitive impairment was measured by the Mini-Mental\nStatus Examination (37), covering the following aspects of\ncognitive functioning: orientation, registration, duplication\nand design, calculation, recall, naming, and language, with\na total score ranging from 0 to 30. It was adapted to the\ncultural and socioeconomic circumstances in China (38).\nFollowing previous work (37,39), we classified the respon-\ndents into cognitive impaired (score <18) and cognitive\nunimpaired (score 18). Different from the traditional one\nused in the Western nations (37), this cut-off point arguably\nbetter captures the cognitive function of the Chinese elderly\npopulation considering more than 85% of Chinese old\nadults aged 65 years or older did not receive more than\nSelf-rated health has been shown to be an effective mea-\nsure of individual health status and has a strong predictive\npower of comorbidity and mortality (40). It is assessed by a\ngeneral question: \"In general, would you say your health is:\n(1) very good, (2) good, (3) so so, (4) bad, or (5) very bad?\"\nTo account for distributional skew, we combined the self-\nrated health responses into the following two categories:\n\"poor\" (combining [3] to [5]) and \"good\" (combining [1]\nand [2]), with the latter as the reference category.\nThe CLHLS collected information on more than 20 chronic\nconditions (eg, cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia, and\narthritis). For this analysis, chronic disease was operational-\nized as having at least one disease (coded 1) compared with\nno disease (coded 0). The validity of this measure has been\nconfirmed elsewhere (27).\nSullivan's method was employed to estimate the five\nHEs, namely LEs free of a specific health condition (eg,\nfunctional disability or cognitive impairment), which have\ndrawn increasing attention in aging studies (41). The formula\n(42) for calculating HEs is as below:\nHE\nh\nx x x\nx\nx x\nx L x L h\nl l\n \n= =\n\u00a6 \u00a6\nwhere HEx\nrepresents HE at age x; lx\nindicates the number of\nliving persons in the life table at age x; Lx\nis person-years\nlived at age x; hx\nis the prevalence of a healthy state (eg,\nADL active) at age x; and Lh\nx\nis person-years lived in a\nhealthy state at age x. Using the Sullivan method, expected\nLE in IADL or ADL disability-free, cognitive impairment-\nfree, good or very good self-rated health, and disease-free\nstates were calculated by applying the corresponding cross-\nsectional age- to sex-specific prevalence rates in 2002 to\nthe person-years lived in different age categories derived\nStatistical Analysis\nTwo sex-specific models were fit for all the dependent\nvariables including mortality and the five health outcomes.\nModel I controlled for age and APL only and Model II added\nFigure 1.

In the survival\nanalysis of the longitudinal data of the CLHLS from 2002 to\n2005, where death was the outcome variable, age was catego-\nrized into seven 5-year groups to account for the nonlinearity of\nthe age effect on mortality. For the five health outcomes,\nmultilevel logistic regression analyses of the cross-sectional\ndata of the CLHLS in 2002 were performed to estimate the\nprevalence rates and effects of the predictors. Given that the\nsampling weight variable in the CLHLS data set is calculated\nbased on the age- to sex-urban/rural residence-specific distri-\nbution of the population and does not capture other important\ncompositional variables (eg, marital status, living arrange-\nment), we did not apply sample weights in the regression anal-\nyses. Research has indicated that inclusion of variables\nrelated to sample selection in the regression produces unbi-\nased coefficients without weights; additionally, weighted\nregression results are likely to enlarge the standard errors\nResults\nSample statistics are shown in Table 1. The overall death\nrate in the 3-year follow-up is 14%. The averageAPL across\nall the prefectures and cities is 3.3, indicating slight pollu-\ntion (see Appendix). Table 2 presents results of survival\nanalysis. Air pollution is a significant risk factor of mortal-\nity for women with one higher level of air pollution corre-\nsponding to a 13% increase in mortality risk, independent of\nindividual-level sociodemographic factors or community-\nlevel per capital gross domestic product (see model II).\nAir pollution did not appear relevant for men's mortality\nrisk.

For both men and women, air\npollution strongly increases odds of having health prob-\nlems. For example, in women, one level higher in air pollu-\ntion is associated with an 11% increase in the odds of being\nIADL-disabled, 47% for ADL disability, 15% for cognitive\nimpairment, 17% for self-rated poor health, and 7% for having\nat least one chronic condition.

The effects are all positive and net of\nmultilevel controls.\nTable 4 illustrates sex-specific LEs estimated by survival\nanalyses for each age stratum. Two areas of different pollution\nlevels were compared, one with an APL of two representing\nareas of relatively good air quality and an APL of six denoting\nmoderately heavily polluted areas. Based on model I, in the\nabsolute value, LEs in women in areas of good air quality\n65 greater than those living in moderately heavily polluted\nareas (APL = 6). The corresponding figures were much\nrespectively. However, proportionally speaking, the detri-\nmental effects of air pollution were greater in groups older\nthan 85 years of age. These patterns continued to hold after\nother sociodemographic covariates were accounted for (see\nmodel II).\nTable 5 shows reductions in HEs linked to air pollu-\ntion. For example, in the absolute value, the gap in HEs\nfor ADL in women between areas with good air quality\nand moderately heavily polluted areas was 5.2 years at\nto air pollution based on other outcomes were smaller\nalthough also notable. These patterns are graphically illus-\ntrated in Figures 2 and 3, where the stronger effects of air\npollution on women are visible for most outcomes.

Hence, causality in this link remains elusive and\npollution effects on other health outcomes are largely\nunknown. The literature is particularly thin in China--a\nrapidly developing country that has been exhibiting large-\nscale environmental deterioration concomitant with an\nunprecedented continued economic miracle.\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to report\nprospective and contextual effects of outdoor air pollution\nModel I Model II\nLife Expectancies (LE (x); y)\nDifference in Life\nExpectancies Life Expectancies (y)\nDifference in Life\nExpectancies\nAges APL = 2 APL = 6 E (x) E (x)% APL = 2 APL = 6 E (x) E (x)%\nWomen\nMen\nNote: APL = air pollution level; CLHLS = Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey; Model I controlled for age and APL, whereas model II further\ncontrolled for urban residence, education, financial independence, marital status, health practices, and county-level per capita Gross Domestic Product.

Net of a range of\ncontrol variables, exposure to outdoor air pollution led to a\nreduction of LE and greater reductions of HE. These detri-\nmental pollution effects seemed to be stronger for women\nthan men, although for men, the pollution effect on LE was\nin the same direction, and the pollution effects on HEs were\nremarkable as well. The largest gap in LE between areas\nwith good air quality and moderately heavily polluted areas\nwas about 4 years for women of age 65, and the correspond-\ning largest gap in HE was 5 years based on ADL for women\nof age 65. Proportionally speaking, the pollution effects\nwere greater among the oldest old (aged 85 years or older).\nAdding up to the population level, these human and health\ncosts can be tremendous. Clearly, the detrimental health\neffects of environmental pollution in China need to be\nurgently addressed.\nThe stronger contextual effect of outdoor air pollution on\nwomen's health is consistent with evidence that women's\nhealth and behavior are more responsive to a host of resi-\ndential environmental factors reported in the neighborhood\neffects on health research (46). It is also consistent with\ngrowing evidence of interaction between gender and air\npollution in affecting respiratory health (47). The finding\nfrom the present study indicates that women's greater sus-\nceptibility to air pollution is not limited in respiratory health\nbut also applicable to a wide range of conditions prevalent\namong the elderly population. Both biological and nonbio-\nlogical mediators of this gender/sex gap have been pro-\nposed. For example, women's smaller lung size and airway\ndiameter may lead to increased airway reactivity and exac-\nerbate particulate deposition (48,49). As to nonbiological\nfactors, gender differences in socioeconomic status and\nstress experiences (50,51) and other sociodemographic factors\nsuch as marital status (52) may help explain the gendered\nresponses to air pollution (47). In addition, residence-based\npollution exposure may be captured more accurately for\nwomen than for men considering that women tend to spend\nmore time near home being more likely to be caregivers and\nless likely to have full-time jobs (46,53). These explana-\ntions remain largely speculative, however. Most studies in\nthe neighborhood effects on health literature have not spe-\ncifically investigated gender modification of neighborhood\neffects; rather, they simply control for gender in regression\nanalyses (54,55). Arguably, compared with adjustment for\ngender/sex, reporting gender/sex-stratified results can better\nreveal different associations in the pollution-health link\nbetween men and women. Air pollution epidemiology\nshould incorporate more detailed gender/sex analysis in the\nAnother modification factor of the pollution-health link\nis age. It is not surprising that older elders are more vulner-\nable to air pollution compared with younger elders due to\ntheir impaired physiological functioning and cumulative\nexposure to air pollution (17). The same pattern may well\nhold true when older adults are compared with younger-\nand middle-aged adults. Therefore, in a society aging fast,\nthe dire health consequences of air pollution observed today\nlikely gets exacerbated over time. In other words, the\nhuman and health costs of air pollution currently experi-\nenced likely foreshadow a more devastating picture in the\nforeseeable future.\nAmong health outcomes examined, ADL stuck out show-\ning the largest pollution-induced reductions in HE for both\nmen and women. This finding is novel. Compared with\nother health conditions, ADL is the most debilitating condi-\ntion that entails daily care giving and is often shortly fol-\nlowed by mortality. Mechanisms underlying the particularly\nstrong ADL-pollution link need to be elucidated.\nThis study is limited in several ways. Misclassification of\npollution exposure is unavoidable given uncounted residential\nmobility, which may underestimate the pollution effects.\nWith a relatively short follow-up period (ie, 3 years), this study\ncannot detect longer-term pollution effects. In addition,\nrelative impacts of the five different components of air pol-\nlution on individuals' mortality risk and health outcomes\nwere not distinguished. A study conducted in the United\nStates showed that particulates were the most damaging\npollution, whereas ozone and other pollutants had much\nsmaller effects (56). This finding seems to suggest air quality\nstandards should be more targeted on controlling the ambient\nparticulate levels. It can be expected that this pattern also\nFigure 3. Comparisons of age-specific proportions of selected health conditions between areas with good air quality (air pollution levels [APL] = 2) and areas\nwith poor air quality (APL = 6).\nholds in China. However, evidence is not readily available\non this hypothesis, and the present study is not equipped to\nexamine this issue either. In other words, this study cannot\nprovide evidence-based policy recommendation as to which\naspect of air pollution should be prioritized to ameliorate.\nThat said, insofar as many pollutants are highly correlated\nand often share common sources (56,57), mandatory sig-\nnificant reductions in emissions from many sources should\nbe implemented to reduce air pollution in densely populated\nand rapidly developing China.\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the prospective and\ncontextual effects of exposure to outdoor air pollution on\nmorbidity, mortality, LE, and HE in China. Evidence is clear\nto support policies and programs developed and imple-\nmented to address high levels of air pollution in China to\nreduce pollution-induced burden of morbidity and mortality.\nDespite its remarkable economic growth and overarching\nimprovement in standard of living in the reform era, China\nhas suffered significant environmental degradation, grow-\ning health disparities, and mounting public dissatisfaction\nwith equity issues in recent years (2,58). To halt this down-\nward trend, perhaps one viable solution is to ameliorate air\nquality to impede one pathway leading to slower health\ngain and greater health inequality recently looming large\nin China.\n"
