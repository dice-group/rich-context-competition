Student opinion of these policies is not known, and concern about student opposition is one\nbarrier that deters administrators from adopting the policies. This study measured student support for\nrecommended college tobacco control policies.\nDesign: Mailed survey of US college students (2001 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol\nStudy).\nSetting: 119 nationally representative, four-year colleges and universities in the USA.\nParticipants: 10 904 randomly selected undergraduate students enrolled at participating schools.\nMain outcome measures: Students' opinion of 7 proposed tobacco control policies.\nResults: A majority of students supported each policy. Over three quarters of students favoured smoke-\nfree policies for all college buildings, residences, and dining areas, while 71% supported prohibiting\ntobacco advertising and sponsorship of campus social events, 59% favoured prohibiting tobacco sales\non campus, and 51% supported smoke-free campus bars. All policies had more support among non-\nsmokers than smokers (p < 0.001). Among smokers, support for policies was inversely related to inten-\ntion to quit and intensity of tobacco consumption. Because college students' tobacco consumption is\nlow, a majority of smokers favoured banning smoking in college buildings and dining areas and pro-\nhibiting tobacco marketing on campus.\nConclusions: Student support for proposed campus tobacco control policies is strong, even among\nsmokers, and broadly based across demographic subgroups. These findings should provide\nreassurance to college administrators who are considering adopting these policies.\nTobacco use among young adults aged 18\u00ad24 years is a\nadults attended a college or university, making these\ninstitutions important channels for influencing young adult\nbehaviour.2 The prevalence of cigarette smoking among US\nson for this increase is unclear, but elements in the college\nUS colleges banned smoking in all buildings including student\nresidences.5 Tobacco products were readily available on college\ncampuses, and access to tobacco treatment services was\nlimited.5 Furthermore, a growing body of evidence from\ntobacco industry documents demonstrates that the industry\nmarkets actively on and around college campuses, advertising\nin college and alternative newspapers and sponsoring social\nevents on campus and at nearby bars where free cigarettes and\nother brand items are distributed.6\u00ad8 Exposure to tobacco pro-\nmotions at social events has been associated with increased\ntobacco use by college students.9\nTo discourage tobacco use among college students, a similar\nset of tobacco control policies for US colleges and universities\nwas recommended by the American College Health Associ-\nation and American Cancer Society.10 11 These organisations\ndeveloped their recommendations independently, each adapt-\ning to the college environment tobacco control policies that are\neffective in the general population. Both groups recommended\nthat colleges prohibit smoking in all campus buildings\n(including student residences and eating areas), prohibit\ntobacco advertising on campus and in college publications,\nprohibit tobacco sponsorship of campus events, prohibit the\nsale of tobacco on campus, and provide ready access to smok-\ning cessation treatment. While there is limited evidence for\nthe efficacy of these recommended policies in the college envi-\nronment at present, data are beginning to appear. For\nexample, one cross-sectional study found an association\nbetween smoke-free policies in student residences and lower\nsmoking prevalence, especially among students who did not\nenter college as regular smokers.12\nreported a low prevalence of recommended tobacco control\npolicies, despite a recent increase in the prevalence of smoke-\nfree policies in student residences.13 There is little other infor-\nmation about the prevalence of recommended tobacco control\npolicies or about which factors facilitate and impede their\nadoption. Existing data indicate that college administrators do\nnot regard tobacco use to be a high priority problem, in part\nbecause it has less immediate morbidity and mortality than\nother problems, such as alcohol use.5 14 Furthermore, adminis-\ntrators do not perceive strong student demand for strengthen-\ning tobacco control policies, and some are concerned about\npotential student opposition to changing campus tobacco\ncontrol policies.14 15 Students' opinion of the proposed tobacco\ncontrol policies has not been measured, but it could provide\nvaluable information with the potential to influence adminis-\ntrators' policy decisions.\nWe analysed survey data from a large, nationally represen-\ntative random sample of US college students to identify the\nextent and predictors of student support for recommended\ncampus tobacco control policies. We hypothesised that support\nfor all policies would be stronger among non-smokers than\nsmokers.\nMETHODS\nSample\nWe analysed data from the 2001 Harvard School of Public\nHealth College Alcohol Study (CAS), which surveyed a\nSee end of article for\nauthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nNancy A Rigotti, MD,\nTobacco Research and\nTreatment Center,\nMassachusetts General\nHospital, 50 Staniford\nStreet, 9th floor, Boston,\nnrigotti@partners.org\nReceived\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nwww.tobaccocontrol.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nrandom sample of students enrolled in 120 four-year US col-\nleges and universities.16 For the survey, each school provided a\nlist of 215 randomly selected students from all full time\nyear. One college was excluded from analysis because its\nresponse rate was substantially lower than the others, leaving\nThe schools, located in 38 states and the District of Colum-\nbia, were selected to create a nationally representative sample\nof four-year US colleges and universities.17 Sixty nine per cent\nof respondents attended public colleges and 31% attended\nprivate colleges; the corresponding US distribution is 68% and\n32%, respectively.18 Forty seven per cent of respondents\nattended small colleges (< 5000 students); the national\nare over represented in the CAS sample because they were\nselected with probability proportional to size. Thirteen per\ncent of students attended schools with a religious affiliation,\nThree separate mailings were sent within three weeks: a ques-\ntionnaire, a reminder postcard, and a second questionnaire.\nResponses were anonymous. Cash prizes were offered to\nQuestionnaire and measures\nThe questionnaire assessed students' demographic character-\nistics, tobacco use, opinion of proposed tobacco control\npolicies, awareness of their school's policy about smoking in\nstudent residences, and the current smoking policy of their\nresidence. Demographic factors assessed were age, sex,\nethnicity, year in school, marital status, and residence\n(on-campus or off-campus). Students were asked if they lived\nin housing designated as smoke-free, and if not, whether they\nwould like to do so. Students who reported smoking a\ncigarette in the past 30 days were defined as current smokers.\nCigarette smokers were asked to specify daily cigarette\nconsumption and frequency of smoking (\"On how many of\nthe past 30 days did you smoke cigarettes?\").\nTo assess attitudes regarding tobacco control policies on\ncampus, students were asked, \"To what extent do you support\nor oppose the following possible school policies about\nsmoking?\" Response options were strongly support, support,\noppose, and strongly oppose. Students were asked about three\ntypes of tobacco control policies: clean indoor air (four items),\ntobacco marketing restrictions (two items), and tobacco sales\nrestrictions (one item). Clean indoor air policies tested were\nsmoking prohibitions in: (1) all campus buildings; (2) all parts\nof residence halls including student sleeping quarters; (3)\non-campus restaurants or dining areas; and (4) on-campus\nbars or pubs. Marketing restrictions assessed were prohibi-\ntions on tobacco industry sponsorship of school parties or\nevents and tobacco advertisements in student newspapers.\nStudents were also asked their opinion of prohibiting the sale\nof tobacco products on campus.\nA separate written questionnaire was sent to administrators\nat each school in the sample. In 2001, two questions asked\nabout the school's smoking policies. Administrators were\nasked whether smoking was prohibited everywhere on\ncampus, and if not, whether smoking was prohibited in\nresidence hall private rooms and common areas. Responses\nwere obtained from all schools.\nAnalysis\nStatistical analyses were carried out using STATA.19 Data were\nweighted to account for colleges' different sampling fractions\nand to match each college's distribution of sex, race\nyears). Analyses were conducted to examine the potential bias\nintroduced by non-respondents. Response rates did not differ\nbetween colleges that did and did not (1) prohibit smoking\neverywhere on campus (p=0.85) or (2) prohibit smoking in\nstudent residences (p = 0.60). The Spearman correlation\ncoefficient between a college's current smoking rate and its\ndifference in current smoking rates between students who\nresponded before and after the second mailing (24.8% v 26.0%,\np = 0.19). College response rate was included as a continuous\ncovariate in all multivariate regression models to control for\nnon-response bias.\nAttitudes toward policies were dichotomised into two\ncategories: support or oppose. Bivariate analyses identified\nstudent level and college level characteristics associated with\nattitudes toward tobacco control policies. Significance was\nassessed with 2 tests and 2 tests of trend for categorical vari-\nables and t tests for continuous variables. Multivariate models\nwere created to identify student level and college level factors\nthat were independently associated with each proposed policy.\nAll models adjusted for each schools' survey response rate and\nincluded student age, sex, ethnicity, year in school, marital\nstatus, and current cigarette smoking. College level factors\nincluded in models were size of enrollment (< 5000,\nversus private status, competitiveness for admission (based on\npercentage of applicants accepted), school smoking policy (for\ncollege residences), and school smoking rate (divided into ter-\ntiles). We used the generalised estimating equations (GEE)\napproach to fitting the logistic regression models to account\nappropriately for clustered outcomes arising in our sampling\nscheme.20 21 Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence limits\nare reported.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the sample\nrespondents and compares their age, sex, and racial distribu-\ntion with the distributions of these characteristics among all\nfull time undergraduates at the 119 participating schools and\namong a national sample of full time undergraduates.18\nRespondents' age and race were comparable to the compari-\nson populations, but a greater proportion of respondents were\nfemale than in the comparison populations. Of the 119 schools\nin the sample, 22 (18%) prohibited smoking everywhere on\ncampus. An additional 31 schools (26%) prohibited smoking\nin private rooms in college residences but not everywhere on\ncampus.\nAttitudes about tobacco control policies\nA majority of students supported each of the seven proposed\npolicies (table 2). More than three quarters of students\nsupported a ban on smoking in all campus buildings, includ-\ning residence halls and dining areas. Nearly as many\nsupported restrictions on tobacco marketing on campus. Sixty\nper cent supported banning tobacco sales on campus and half\nfavoured banning tobacco in campus bars.\nSupport for all policies was significantly stronger among\nnon-smokers than smokers (table 2). However, even among\nsmokers, a majority favoured five of the seven policies, includ-\ning smoke-free residence halls and dining areas, and bans on\ntobacco sponsorship of campus social events and tobacco\nadvertising on campus. Table 2 also shows that among smok-\ners, support for each policy was inversely related to tobacco\nconsumption.\nAdditional support for smoke-free residences is found in\nstudents' responses to questions about their preferences for\nliving quarters. Of the 39% of respondents who lived in a cam-\npus residence, 59% reported that their housing was designated\n252 Rigotti, Regan, Moran, et al\nwww.tobaccocontrol.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nas smoke-free, and over half (58%) of those who did not live in\nsmoke-free housing stated that they would prefer to do so.\nFactors associated with support for tobacco control\npolicies\nTables 3 and 4 display independent predictors of student sup-\nport for the proposed tobacco control policies. Support for all\npolicies was most strongly associated with student smoking\nstatus, even after adjustment for other student and college\nlevel factors.\nWhen these multivariate analyses were repeated among\ncurrent smokers only, support for all tobacco control policies\nwas greater among smokers who planned to quit in the next\n30 days than among smokers not planning to quit (for exam-\nple, for prohibiting smoking in all campus buildings: adjusted\nresidences, dining areas, campus bars, and all campus\nbuildings was greater among lighter smokers (< 10 cigarettes/\nday) than among heavier smokers (for example, for prohibit-\nport for marketing restrictions and for banning tobacco sales\non campus did not vary by intensity of tobacco use.\nTables 3 and 4 demonstrate that all policies were more\npopular among females and married students than among\nmales or unmarried students. Student support for all policies\nwas higher at colleges in western states, at colleges with a\nlower smoking prevalence, and at schools that had already\nbanned smoking in student residences.\nSmoke-free policies for student residences and campus\nbuildings were also more popular among schools in the north\ncentral states. These policies were less popular among\nstudents who live in campus residences. Smoke-free bars had\nmore support among students in higher grades and among\nstudents at smaller schools. Support for tobacco marketing\nand sale restrictions, unlike smoke-free policies, varied by\nrace, being more popular among non-whites than whites.\nThese policies were also more popular at smaller schools. Age\nwas a factor only for one policy: tobacco sales restrictions.\nYounger students were less supportive of this policy than older\nstudents, independent of grade level.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to report college stu-\ndents' opinions about the campus tobacco control policies rec-\nommended by the American College Health Association and\nAmerican Cancer Society. The study found strong support for\nall proposed policies among a large, nationally representative\nsample of US college students. College administrators and\npolicymakers may not have previously been aware of the\nbreadth and depth of student support for tobacco control poli-\ncies. Our findings should reassure officials who may have been\nconcerned about student opposition to the policies.\nAs we hypothesised, support for tobacco control policies\nwas stronger among non-smokers than smokers. Even so,\nmost policies had substantial support among smokers,\nbecause support was inversely related to tobacco consump-\ntion, and 76% of the smokers in the sample were either occa-\nsional smokers or light daily smokers. The multivariate analy-\nses indicated that opposition to tobacco control policies was\nTable 1 Respondent characteristics\nRespondents at\nparticipating schools\nStudents enrolled at\nthe participating\nschools (%)\nNational sample of\nundergraduates* (%)\nYear in school  \nMarried 6  \nResidence  \nOn-campus housing 39\nOff-campus housing 58\nFraternity/sorority 3\n* US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics.

It is possible that the inverse rela-\ntion between policy support and tobacco consumption may\napply to populations beyond college students. If so, the finding\nwould have special relevance for populations with few heavy\nsmokers, such as young adults in general. In these popula-\ntions, support for tobacco control policies may be higher than\nmany policymakers assume if they use tobacco prevalence as\na rough measure of opposition to tobacco control policies.\nMultivariate analyses further demonstrated that support\nfor proposed tobacco control policies was broad and strong in\nall sociodemographic groups and types of colleges. Some col-\nleges have voiced concern that the adoption of a smoke-free\npolicy in student residences might discourage prospective stu-\ndents who smoke from choosing to attend the school. Our data\nsuggest otherwise. Even among smokers, 45% preferred a\nsmoke-free dorm policy, and the majority of students who\ncurrently lived in a residence that permitted smoking stated a\npreference for a smoke-free residence. We did observe that\nstudents who lived in dormitories were less in favour of\nsmoke-free residence policies than students who lived in off-\ncampus housing. Students who do not live in dormitories may\nfind it easy to favour a policy that does not affect them, while\nstudents who live in a dormitory may be more reluctant to\nimpose rules on classmates.\nSupport for tobacco control policies of all types was stronger\namong students attending colleges with a low smoking preva-\nlence. The relative absence of smokers on these campuses may\nfoster positive attitudes toward proposed tobacco control poli-\ncies. Support for all types of tobacco control policies was also\nstronger among students who reported that housing on their\ncampus was already smoke-free. One interpretation is that\nstudents who live in smoke-free residences like them and may\nfind it easier to support additional tobacco restrictions. Alter-\nnately, colleges with smoke-free residences may attract\nstudents with more support for tobacco control policies.\nBecause this is a cross-sectional survey, it is impossible to dis-\ntinguish between alternate interpretations of the finding.\nSmoking bans in campus bars and prohibiting tobacco sales\non campus were the least popular tobacco control policies. This\nmay reflect the fact that both policies directly impact smokers.\nSmoke-free bar policies make it difficult for students to smoke\nin one of the last places where smoking has been allowed,\nwhile banning tobacco sales on campus makes access to\ntobacco products less convenient. In this context, smokers'\nstrong support for bans on smoking in campus buildings,\nhousing, and dining areas is remarkable. It probably reflects\nstudents' perception of social norms about where smoking is\nnow acceptable in US society. It also reflects larger public\nopinion; state and community smoke-free bar laws face\nstronger opposition than do smoking bans for public places,\nworksites, and restaurants.\nProposed restrictions on tobacco marketing, which have\nlittle direct effect on students, had little opposition, even\namong smokers. Tobacco company sponsorship of campus\nevents is a new tobacco industry strategy for recruiting young\nadult smokers.6\u00ad8 It occurs widely and students who attend\nthese events have higher rates of tobacco use than students\nwho do not.9 Our survey suggests that students will not oppose\nefforts to stop these promotional activities.\nThe prevalence of smoke-free dormitory policies in 2001 in\nour sample (44%) was substantially higher than the 27%\nprevalence observed in 1999 in a larger national sample of US\ncolleges.5 This apparent discrepancy probably represents an\nincrease in smoke-free policy adoption between 1999 and\nfound a doubling in the prevalence of smoke-free dormitories\nThe results of this study are subject to several limitations.\nThe survey response rate of 52% raises the potential for selec-\ntion bias. However, the sociodemographic characteristics of\nTable 3 Student support for recommended clean indoor air (smoke-free) policies: multivariate analysis\nEvery building on campus All parts of residence halls Campus bars or pubs Campus dining areas\nStudent factors\nInstitutional factors\nSize\nRegion\nSchool smoking prevalence\nAlso adjusted for school response rate and degree of competitiveness for admission to school.\nRespondent reports smoking is banned in college residences.\nAOR, adjusted odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.\n254 Rigotti, Regan, Moran, et al\nwww.tobaccocontrol.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ntobaccocontrol.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nthe sample resembled those of a national sample, and\nresponse rates did not correlate with smoking prevalence or\ndiffer between schools with and without smoke-free policies.\nThese facts suggest that selection bias is not a large concern.\nSecond, our results are generalisable to students enrolled in\nUS four-year colleges and universities but cannot be assumed\nto represent the opinions of students attending two-year col-\nleges. Nonetheless, the results do apply to a large number of\nyoung adults--an estimated 5.3 million young adults attend\nfour-year colleges.2 Finally, because of survey length limita-\ntions, we did not assess all proposed campus tobacco control\npolicies. We did not solicit student opinions of bans on smok-\ning outside building entrances or at all campus events, about\nthe provision of free smoking cessation treatment, or on free\ndistribution of tobacco products on campus.\nIn summary, this study elicited student opinions about a\nrange of policies and derived data from a large, random sam-\nple of students at a nationally representative sample of US\ncolleges. These data provide strong support for tobacco control\npolicymakers, advocates, and college administrators who are\nconsidering whether to adopt policies to discourage tobacco\nuse among college students. Policy strategies are important for\nthe college population because of their broad reach. They can\ndiscourage both the uptake and continuation of tobacco use\nand they have the potential to affect a much larger number of\nstudents than traditional smoking cessation interventions in\nthis setting. Future research should include surveillance of the\nprevalence of college tobacco control policies, identification of\nfactors that facilitate and impede policy adoption, and evalua-\ntion of the impact of specific tobacco control policies on\ntobacco use prevalence. In the meantime, this study provides\nsupport for adopting college tobacco control policies, which\nshould be a high priority for college administrators, public\nhealth policymakers, and practitioners.\n"
