In\naddition, the hormonal changes associated with meno-\npause may be related to various chronic conditions,\ne.g., osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases (1).\nMenopause is also the outcome of hysterectomy--the\nmost common nonobstetric surgery in the United\ngone this operation annually (2). Because of the large\nnumber of women who have had hysterectomies and\nbecause women who have undergone this operation\nare not at risk for certain other conditions or proce-\ndures, e.g., endometrial cancer or surgical sterilization,\ninformation on hysterectomy is basic in estimating\npopulations at risk for such conditions (3, 4).\nBecause age at menopause is an important demo-\ngraphic and epidemiologic determinant, we examined\nthe reliability of age at menopause reported at two\nReceived for publication July 13, 1995, and accepted for publi-\nAbbreviations: NHANES I, First National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey; NHEFS, National Health Examination Followup\nStudy.\n1 Epidemiology Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, GA.\n2 Marshfield Medical Research Foundation, Marshfield, Wl.\nReprint requests to Dr. Robert A.

We examined four hypotheses:\n1. Women with hysterectomy-induced menopause\nwill more reliably report their age at menopause\nthan women who have undergone natural meno-\npause.\n2. Reliability of recall declines with time elapsed\nsince menopause.\n3. Reliability declines with age, independent of\ntime since menopausal event.\n4. Women with higher educational levels report\ntheir age at menopause more reliably than\nwomen with lower levels of education.\nWe also examined digit preference in reported age\nat menopause, i.e., a preference for reporting ages\nwith years ending with \"0,\" \"5,\" or \"2.\"\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\naged 25-74 years from the noninstitutionalized civil-\nian population of the United States was interviewed\nsons from regions affected by poverty, older persons,\nand women of childbearing ages were oversampled.\nwithout oversampling, to increase the total sample\nsize.\nmade in the National Health Examination Follow-up\nStudy (NHEFS) to recontact, reinterview, and briefly\nreexamine the NHANES I population (6). Follow-up\npersons in the original sample; of these initial respon-\nsubjects who had died or were disabled was provided\nby proxies.\nAt initial interview, women were asked, \"How old\nwere you when your periods or menstrual cycle start-\ned?\" They were then asked, \"Have they stopped en-\ntirely?\" and \"At what age?\" At follow-up, women\nwere asked, \"At what age did you have your last\nperiod?\" and \"Did your periods stop naturally, because\nyou had surgery or for some other reason?\" In this\nstudy, we refer to women who reported that their\nmenstrual cycles had stopped naturally as menopausal\nand to women who reported that their menopause\nresulted from surgery as having undergone a hyster-\nectomy.\nThe study sample included women who reported at\nboth intake and follow-up interviews that their menses\nhad stopped. We excluded subjects whose menopausal\nhistory was reported by proxies as well as women who\nwere pregnant at initial interview. We also excluded\ntwo women in the sample whose reported chronolog-\nical age at first interview was less than their age at\nmenopause reported at the same interview.\nWe measured the reliability of reported age at\nmenopause by the difference between the age reported\nby menopausal women during their follow-up inter-\nview and the age reported in the NHANES I interview\n(i.e., age reported at follow-up -- age reported at first\ninterview). We focused on the absolute difference as a\nspecific outcome measure.\nTo test the four study hypotheses, we used multiple\nlinear regression models (7) in which the absolute\ndifference between age at menopause reported at first\nand follow-up interviews was the dependent variable;\nage, hysterectomy status, years from menopause\nto final interview, and education were independent\nvariables. Because the hypothesized decline in reli-\nability over time might be different for women with\nand without hysterectomies, we included an interac-\ntion term for hysterectomy and time-since-menopause.\nNonsignificant terms (p > 0.05) were removed from\nthe model one at a time, and the model was retested.\nWe also used the Pearson product moment correlation\n(8) to compare age at menopause reported at first and\nfollow-up interviews; we compared correlations be-\ntween women with natural menopause and those with\nhysterectomy-induced menopause. Because data were\ncollected by using a complex sample survey method-\nology, sampling weights were taken into account in\nthe analysis by using SUDAAN software (9). The\ndesign effect observed in this analysis ranged from\nbeen taken into account, variances would have been\nunderestimated by approximately one half.\nFinally, we examined digit preference in reported\nages, e.g., a preference for ages ending in \"0,\" \"5,\" or\n\"2.\" Under the assumption of unbiased reporting, it is\nreasonable to expect close to 10 percent of the age\nreports to end in each of the digits \"0\" through \"9.\" To\ntest this assumption, we used a chi-square goodness of\nRESULTS\nIn the NHANES I cohort of 7,011 nonpregnant\nwomen aged 25-74 years who responded for them-\npercent) reported being menopausal at both inter-\ncent) had undergone natural menopause and 1,072\n(42.1 percent) had experienced hysterectomies (table\n1). Among women who reported a natural menopause,\nthe median age at menopause was reported at first (and\nfollow-up) interviews to be 50 years. Among women\nwho reported menopause by hysterectomy, the median\nage at menopause was reported at first interview to be\n40 years. Women who had undergone a hysterectomy-\ninduced menopause were younger and had less time\nTABLE 1.

Among women who had under-\ngone a natural menopause, median time from meno-\npause to follow-up was 24 years. Among women who\nhad undergone a hysterectomy, median time from\nmenopause to follow-up was 21 years. Among women\nwho had undergone natural menopause, 26.5 percent\nreported the same age at first and follow-up inter-\nviews, and 8.8 percent reported ages that differed by\n>10 years (table 2, figure 1). Among women who had\nexperienced hysterectomy-induced menopause, 32.6\npercent reported the same age at first and follow-up\ninterviews, and 5.6 percent reported ages that differed\nby >10 years (table 2, figure 1). The median differ-\nence in reported age was approximately zero both for\nwomen with natural and hysterectomy-induced meno-\npause. Both for women with natural and hysterectomy-\ninduced menopause, there was no systematic tendency\nfor reported ages at menopause to increase or decrease\nfrom first to follow-up interviews.\nIn a regression model including terms for age, hys-\nterectomy status, years from menopause to follow-up\ninterview, the interaction of hysterectomy and years\nsince menopause, and education, only hysterectomy\nsignificantly associated with the absolute difference\nbetween first and follow-up reported ages at meno-\npause (figure 1). There was no association between\neither a woman's age or her education and the absolute\ndifference in reported age at menopause.\nTABLE 2.

The correlation of ages given\nat first and follow-up interviews was 0.57 {p <\ninduced menopause (figure 1).\nChi-square goodness of fit test indicated digit pref-\nerence for reported age at menopause for both the\ninitial survey and for the follow-up {p < 0.0001). The\npattern of overall preference was greatest for those\nnumerals ending in \"0,\" followed by \"5,\" \"2,\" and \"8.\"\nAt first interview, women with hysterectomy-induced\nmenopause were 1.2-1.3 times more likely than\nchance to report an age ending in \"0,\" \"5,\" or \"8\";\nwomen with natural menopause were 2.1 times more\nlikely than chance to report an age ending in \"0,\" and\n1.4-1.5 times more likely to report an age ending in\n\"5\" or \"2.\" Only among women with hysterectomy-\ninduced menopause, digit preference increased\nslightly from initial to follow-up interviews.\nComparison of responses to questions regarding re-\nproductive characteristics in the follow-up cohort in-\ndicates that the questions asked may have been con-\nfusing to respondents. Among 1,749 women who\nreported at follow-up having had a hysterectomy (and\nwho also answered questions about their womb and\ntheir wombs; of these women, 126 also reported that\nthey still had both ovaries. In addition, of 2,425\nwomen who reported not having had a hysterectomy,\nDISCUSSION\nAmong women who had experienced natural meno-\npause and who were interviewed on two occasions, 44\npercent reported their age at menopause within one\nyear from the first to second interviews, while among\nwomen who had undergone hysterectomy-induced\nmenopause, 59 percent reported their age at meno-\npause within one year from first to follow-up inter-\nviews. Among women who had undergone a natural\nmenopause, 9 percent differed in age at menopause\nreported in two interviews by ^10 years, and among\nwomen who had undergone a hysterectomy-induced\nmenopause, 6 percent differed in age at menopause\nreported in two interviews by ^10 years. The finding\nthat the median difference in reported age was approx-\nimately zero suggests that there is no systematic age\nmisclassification, i.e., women do not tend to recall\ntheir menopause either earlier or later from first to\nfollow-up interviews.

There was\na marked preference in recalled ages ending with\ndigits \"0,\" \"5,\" and, to a lesser extent, \"2.\"\nIn the absence of medical or physiologic documen-\ntation, this study could not address validity--that is,\nreported versus true age at menopause. With discrep-\nant reported ages, although both may be erroneous,\nboth cannot be true. Because reporting may be more\naccurate when it occurs soon after an event (rather\nthan later) and because recall generally declines with\nincreasing age, ages reported more proximal to meno-\npausal events may be more valid than ages reported\nlater.\nThe questions asked about menopausal status in first\nand follow-up interviews were not identical and might\nhave been interpreted differently. The question at ini-\ntial interview, \"Have they [i.e., your periods or men-\nstrual cycle] stopped entirely?\" (followed by a ques-\ntion of the age at this event) more clearly indicates\nmenopause than does the question asked at follow-up,\n\"At what age did you have your last period?\" How-\never, the next question in the follow-up interview, i.e.,\n\"Did your periods stop naturally, because you had\nsurgery, or for some other reason?\", clarifies the ref-\nerence of the preceding question to menopause. Nev-\nertheless, there is evidence of misunderstanding in\nresponses to some of the questions asked. At follow-\nup, 12.6 percent of women who claimed to have had a\nhysterectomy also reported still having their \"womb or\nuterus,\" and 8.5 percent of women who claimed not to\nhave had a hysterectomy also reported not having their\n\"womb or uterus.\" The likelihood that a woman re-\nported having had a hysterectomy and still having a\nwomb did not differ substantially among those with\nand without a high school education.\nBased on small, regional samples, two previous\nstudies have assessed the reliability of reported age at\nmenopause. Bean et al. (11) recorded menstrual his-\ntory events reported near the time of their occurrence\nand found that 83.4 percent of college-educated\nwomen who had undergone a hysterectomy reported\n  775\ntheir age at hysterectomy within one year from first to\npercent of women with a natural menopause report-\ned their age at menopause within one year from first\nto follow-up interviews a mean of 7.6 years later.\nPaganini-Hill and Ross (12) compared the age at last\nmenstrual period reported by older, affluent women\nwith the medical records of the same women. These\nauthors found that 48.4 percent of women who had\nundergone a natural menopause agreed on their age at\nmenopause within one year, and 67.7 percent agreed\nwithin 3 years. Among women with a hysterectomy,\n67.8 percent were within one year of reported age at\nhysterectomy, and 81.4 percent were within 3 years.\nThe reliability reported here is substantially less\nthan that reported by Bean et al. (11) and slightly less\nthan that reported by Paganini-Hill and Ross (12). The\ngreater reliability reported by Bean et al. may be a\nresult of the college education and/or the frequent\ninterviewing of the cohort whose menstrual histories\nwere updated in ongoing surveys, resulting in repeated\nprompting to recall menstrual events. The lower reli-\nability may also result from different wordings and\ndifferent understandings (or misunderstandings) by\nNHANES and NHEFS subjects.\nOur results suggest the need for caution in research\ninvolving reported age at menopause, and particularly\ngreater caution for reported age among women who\nhave undergone a natural menopause and among\nwomen who report their menopause many years since\nthe event. Our results also provide a means for con-\nducting sensitivity analyses in studies using reported\nage at menopause (11); they indicate the range of\nvariability in reporting that may be expected. Such\ncaution may enhance our understanding of this critical\nevent in the lives of women.\nREFERENCES\n1. Belchetz P. Hormonal treatment of postmenopausal women.\n2.
