This article focuses on the online memory practices of this self-dubbed\n\"latchkey generation\" by investigating an emerging life writing genre--the Facebook generatiography--and\nits reliance on the archiving of communist memorabilia in the shape of photographed objects. How do\ngenerational frames of remembrance, members of a specific generation, and the sociotechnical affordances\nof Facebook pages intra-act to produce this genre? And what does it \"do\" in the context of post-communist\nRomania? This article sets about answering these questions while arguing for the renewed need to think\nabout generations as generically actualized discursive strategies in the age of social media.\n",

Beginning\nas a form of resistance and protest by an elite minority against the new democratic state's failure to\n\"work through\" the traumatic history of communism, the discourse of \"memory as justice\" became\ncommunism as its only legitimate inflection. As a result, public memory discourses polarized the\nintellectual elite as righteous \"watchdogs\" of memory against the amnesiac political class and the\noblivious masses. The anti-communist discourse propagated by the former meant that suffering\nand national victimization were the only morally acceptable narratives about the past.\nCorresponding author:\nCodrua Pohrib, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Maastricht University, Grote Gracht 90-92, 6211 SZ, Maastricht,\nThe Netherlands.\nEmail: codruta.pohrib@maastrichtuniversity.nl\nArticle\nIn the 2000s, alongside the duty to remember approach to the recent past emerged a focus on the\nright to remember one's childhood and adolescence in communist Romania as an experience char-\nacterized by innocence and free play despite the poor living standards and political violence.4 This\ndiscourse comes in the shape of generational life writing authored by Romania's self-dubbed\n\"latchkey kids.\" In socialist Romania, the strict pronatalist legislation5 and few day-care facilities\nmeant that many children were left unsupervised after school while parents were at work, hence the\ngenerational label. As opposed to the general usage in the West, being a latchkey kid does not\nimmediately involve grim upbringing and parental neglect, but is rather associated with learning\nself-reliance and responsibility as a result. Although the emergence of a \"latchkey generation\" is a\nrelatively recent discursive phenomenon, it has resulted in a churn-out of autobiographies and\nautofictions,6 the launch of a television guest show of the same name,7 series of newspaper arti-\ncles,8 and a vibrant \"web sphere\"9 (Foot et al., 2005) of generational memories focused on memo-\nrabilia from communist Romania. A large part of these material memories are archived on highly\npopular Facebook pages, where the grassroots heritage of communist \"things\" in the shape of\nphotographs is driving a positive generational discourse. These Facebook \"generatiographies\"10\nare the focus of this article.\nOne of the tenets of digital memory studies is that \"a new `living archive'is becoming the organ-\nizing and habitual condition of memory\" (Hoskins, 2015: 663), and Facebook itself has been defined\nas \"an archive of human relationships\" (Richardson and Hessey, 2009). Romanian Facebook gen-\neratiographies function as what Ann Cvetkovich (2003) has called \"archives of feelings\"--\n\"repositories of feelings and emotions, which are encoded not only in the content of the texts\nthemselves but in the practices that surround their production and reception\" (p. 7). On Facebook,\nproduction and reception and the affective engagement with memories leave traces in the digital\n\"text.\" The particular type of intra-action between users and platform results in a new way of gen-\nerational identification but also in an adaptation of a software genre--the Facebook page--which is\nturned into a grassroots heritage project.As Eichhorn (2008) notes, in the digital age, \"to write in the\narchive\" might mean writing \"for and even like the archive\" (p. n.p.). Constructing generational\nidentity on Facebook is a process of co-construction which prompts a series of questions that I tackle\nin this article: How do generational frames of remembrance, Facebook users, and the sociotechnical\naffordances of Facebook pages intra-act to produce a new memory genre? What does this genre\n\"do\" in the context of post-communist Romania? What is its role in negotiating post-communist\nidentities and memory cultures on Facebook as a translocal (Kyt\u00f6l\u00e4, 2015) platform?\nI address these questions with reference to two media objects from the latchkey generation web\nsphere: the Facebook community pages \"Generaia cu cheia la g\u00e2t\"/\"The Latchkey Generation\"\nand \"Copilria anilor 80\u00ad90\"/ \"Childhood in the 80s\u00ad90s,\"which I analyze as exemplary cases\nselected on the criterion of popularity.11 I have conducted participant observation of \"latchkey\"\nFacebook groups starting with 2011/2012. I used my free Facebook account to join these groups\nout of personal interest, which turned into a research interest several months afterwards, as part of\na bigger research project. At first, I followed posts in my newsfeed, then I selected the option \"Get\nnotifications\" but I also regularly browsed through the albums of photos stored in these groups in\nthe \"Albums\" sections. Throughout the initial period of observation, I worked inductively, tracing\nand noting the rhetoric strategies used by page admins in the framing of the posts, categories of\ncomments and the general dynamics of the groups. Beginning with 2015, I downloaded the most\npopular 50 wall posts using screen grab browser add-ons, saved them as PDF files, and re-read\nthem four times. I identified recurrent framings of posts by the page admins as well as clustered\ntypical forms of engagements by members of the two Facebook communities. The examples fea-\ntured in this article are the most popular posts and were chosen as typical strategies of display and\nframing of visual material.\nConnect to remember: \"doing\" generation on Facebook\nResearch in media and communication studies has revealed that in journalism \"common narrative\ndevices and themes of youth and nostalgia\" (Kitch, 2003: 185) are used in a way that gives indi-\nvidual stories generational appeal and makes generational identity a matter of social memory,\n\"newsworthiness,\" and commercial marketing potential. Carolyn Kitch's research, for example,\nhas shown how American newsmagazines constructed generational identities over the last two\ndecades of the twentieth century in culturally, commercially, and politically driven ways. In the\nmeantime, the ways in which generational memory is mediated and mediatized have been increas-\ningly influenced by everyday digital media (Hoskins, 2009) and the sociotechnical practices asso-\nciated with them (Van House and Churchill, 2008). With advent of social media in the 2000s and\nthe \"discovery of generation as news\" (Kitch, 2003) in newsmagazines and on television, the\nRomanian \"latchkey generation\" became a popular marker of generational identification.Although\nresearch into post-socialist generational discourses has been steadily emerging (e.g. Berghoff et al.,\nresearch has been done about Romanian generational landscape (Petrescu, 2014; Petrescu and\nPetrescu, 2014). Likewise, research on Facebook mnemonic communities (e.g. De Bruyn, 2010;\ndespite the fact that Facebook groups dedicated to generational life writing have cropped up in a\nvariety of national contexts.12 This article comes to fill this gap, drawing on scholarly work that\nlooks at how generational discourses are constructed and used as discursive strategies (Foster,\ngeneration, seeing it as a \"generationality\" (Reulecke, 2008), a discourse comprising characteris-\ntics that individuals or \"`generational units'collectively claim for themselves\" and/or are \"ascribed\nto such units from the outside\" (Reulecke, 2008: 119). This perspective I find avoids the pitfalls of\na tradition of generational thinking (Kansteiner, 2012) that sees generations as objective and\nobservable social groups. Generations are therefore discursive formations, prone to being rewritten\nand remediated in flux with historical, political and socio-technical dynamics in a \"mutual consti-\ntution of entangled agencies\" (Barad, 2007: 33). The Romanian Facebook pages that I analyze here\nare a case in point since, as I argue in the following sections, a new genre of generational discourse\nemerges through the dynamic intra-action (Barad, 2007) between generational frames of remem-\nbrance, members of a specific generation, and the sociotechnical affordances of Facebook pages.\nBefore going into the analysis of the case studies, a caveat about how genre is used in this article\nis needed. Digital media genres have been attracting scholarly attention, but there are still a host of\nproblematic issues concerning the special relationship between medium, software, and genre which\nare far from being resolved (Askehave and Nielsen, 2005; Crowston, 2010; Dillon and Gushrowski,\nShepherd, 2004, etc.). A proper discussion of the many, at times conflicting, viewpoints on how to\ntheorize digital genres falls outside the scope of this article. I will content myself to saying that I\nfind Stieg Lomborg's (2011) focus on \"what genres do and how genres are done and socially nego-\ntiated in actual communicative practice\" (p. 62) productive. I also find useful Lomborg's differen-\ntiation of genres on the software and functional levels: the former are defined by their\n\"communicative characteristics and interactive functions\" and the latter, according to \"specific\ncommunicative purposes and social uses on various levels of specificity\" (Lomborg, 2011: 58).\nThus, I treat the Facebook generatiography as operating within the software subgenre of the\nFacebook page and see its pragmatic use as that of constructing a mnemonic community focused\non co-creating a generational identity by sharing, evoking, and reflecting upon popular culture\nitems and photographs of objects from one's formative years.\nBy far the most popular Facebook generatiography, \"The Latchkey Generation,\" was set up 29\nrepresenting communist material culture with \"folk wisdom\" and miscellanea posts. The adminis-\ntrator of the page also uses the page to advertise products of small companies.14 These unrelated\ntopics take up approximately two thirds of the posts. However, while posts featuring communist\nmemorabilia attract tens of thousands of likes, thousands of shares, and hundreds of comments,\nadvertisements enjoy very little popularity, showing that the members' real interest is in \"produs-\ning\" childhood memories. There has also been noticeable fluctuation in content throughout the\nyears, with much more focus on advertising in 2013\u00ad2014 and a return to the theme of childhood\nexperiences of communism in 2015, presumably as a result of a dramatic drop in the number of\nlikes, shares, and comments.\n(Figure 1).15 Much more focused on visually recycling communist memorabilia, this page none-\ntheless features a significant number of photographs of idyllic rural life, thus also apparently\ndeparting from its announced purpose. Unless, that is, one bears in mind that with the fast pace\nof industrialization in communist Romania, a large percentage of the population moved from\nrural areas into cities.\nBoth these groups don clear generational markers: the cover photo of \"The Latchkey Generation\"\npage shows a group of children playing in the street and features the condition for belonging to the\n\"in-group\"--\"If you grew up in the `80s\u00ad`90s, then you are one of ours.\" The profile picture fea-\ntures a man dressed in a T-shirt branded with the URL of the community page, hinting at a genera-\ntional identity engineered by an anonymous \"author.\"17 With an ice cream cone profile picture and\na still frame from one of the most popular teen flicks of the 1980s--Liceenii/The Graduates\n(1987)--as a cover photo, \"Childhood in the 80s\u00ad90s\" also asks for proof of identification:\n\"Welcome (back)!!! Like us if you also remember what things were like back in the day ...\" These\n\"paratextual\" features are calls for performing belonging algorithmically, getting users to boost the\npopularity of the page. The generation is thus rendered visible on Facebook where communicative\nremembering leaves material traces that form the \"text\" of the generatiography, making it a \"medi-\nated remembering community\" (Jones, 2013). Although quantitative data are not available, based\non clues provided in comments, the majority of users are people born in the 1970s\u00ad1980s into\nworking-class or middle-class backgrounds.\nAccording to Bohnenkamp, the generatiography is characterized by the style of essays, by a\ngenerational paratextual framing and a focus on generational identity constructed through a\ncommon media culture that is canonized in hindsight. As such, it is conceptualized as a highly\nperformative genre, helping to not only describe the commonalities of a generation but to actu-\nally write a generation into being. (Bohnenkamp, 2010; Weingarten, 2013). As danah boyd\n(2007) argues, social networking presupposes that users must \"write themselves into being\" (p.\n13), so the inherent performativity of social networking sites (SNSs; Liu, 2007) enhances that of\ngenerational life writing, making it a demonstrably collective discourse. As members articulate\n\"their digitally material connections through various forms of affective exchange\" (Van Doorn,\n2011: 534), they produce the Facebook generatiography; in turn, the Facebook platform, through\nthe enabling constraints of its software genres--in these two cases the Page--\"produces\" these\ncommunities, which would otherwise never form offline. This mutual determination reshapes\nshowing how \"`technologies of the self' can simultaneously function as `technologies of affect'\nthat reinforce and demarcate social ties\" (Van Doorn, 2011: 540). The \"explicit and tacit models\nof social and personal memory\" that are \"baked into\" the design of platforms such as Facebook\ncome to play a part in the construction and performance of generational memory (Van House and\nChurchill, 2008: 297). These Facebook groups show how online memories are not \"simply\nshared and told, but creatively constructed\" (Garde-Hansen et al., 2009: 12) at the intersection\nof multiple agencies.\nFigure 1. Screen grab of the Albums section of the Facebook page \"Childhood in the `80s\u00ad`90s.\"\nThe generational collective is determined and rendered visible by the connective (Hoskins,\n2009, 2011). By conditioning generational belonging on medium-specific discursive elements,\nthe admins make members co-creators of the generatiography. Although the administrators of\nthe pages are the most frequent posters, posts by other members are allowed upon \"editorial\"\nacceptance. The admin of \"The Latchkey Generation\" is careful to highlight the most popular\nposts and ask for them to be liked again or check that the members are connected and interested\nby posting \"verification\" status updates such as in Figure 3: \"If you remember then you are\nsurely part of the Latchkey Generation.\" The post had indeed garnered 6668 likes and had been\nshared 735 times. \"Childhood in the 80s\u00ad90s\" focuses more sharply on archiving memorabilia\nthrough concerted efforts, with posts by members viewed separately in the \"Posts to page\" sec-\ntion of the timeline making for a more varied input. The two groups contrast quite sharply in\nterms of \"authorial\" control: members' intervention is limited to commenting and liking in the\nformer and expanded to posting in the other. For \"the Latchkey Generation,\" \"network sociality\"\nand demonstrating generational strength in figures through a mostly phatic dimension (Wittel,\n2001) seem to be more in focus. It is worth remembering that \"Phatic messages potentially carry\na lot more weight to them than the content itself suggests\" (Miller, 2008: 395). In Figure 3, the\ntext links generational belonging to material culture, the visual element makes the post instantly\nrecognizable and shareable, and the community is created and reinforced through liking in\nresponse to the phatic function of the text.\nAs recent scholarship shows, the like button fulfills much more than a constative function--it is\nperformative, \"a conscious rationalized action that connotes an external tag of connection between\nan individual, a discursive element, and a social stance.\" (Peyton, 2014: 113) Through liking,\nFacebook \"favours instant, gut-fired, emotional, positive evaluations\" (Van Dijck, 2013: 13) but\nalso determines exposure. For example, users can simply \"Like this page,\" allowing posts to enter\ntheir newsfeed according to algorithms set by Facebook or choose to receive notifications for every\npost by selecting the option \"Get notifications.\" The more active they are in liking, sharing, or\ncommenting the more posts will be present in their newsfeed. What is more, \"liking\" appears in\nother friends' newsfeed as part of a \"social awareness stream\" (Naaman et al., 2010), leading to a\nsnowball effect. The same goes for sharing posts from the Facebook groups to personal Walls:\nmembers not only enmesh them into the self-narrative of their individual Facebook profiles, but\nalso mediatize generational discourse and engage non-members. They \"activate relational impulses,\nwhich are in turn input for algorithmically configured connections--relationships wrapped in\ncode--generating a kind of engineered sociality\" (Van Dijck, 2011). The Facebook generatiogra-\nphy operates in the interplay between the \"technological unconscious\" (Beer, 2009; Hoskins, 2009)\nand the members' desire to connect generationally.\nWhile recent scholarship has revealed the intense debates about the recent Soviet past going on\nin social media in the genre of the \"web war\" (Rutten, 2013), Romanian generatiographies are\nmore about harmonizing generational identity then actually debating multiple interpretations and\ntemporalities of (post)communism. A high degree of conformism marks the generational Facebook\ngroups belonging to the latchkey web sphere. For example, the group \"The nostalgia of our child-\nhood in the Golden Age\" states up front what on other Facebook pages remains hidden between the\nlines, namely the reluctance to have various perspectives juxtaposed:\nMy parents were not involved in communist politics, being part of the plain and simple working class.\nThey were not persecuted by the former regime or not more \"persecuted\" than the majority of Romanians.\nThey simply raised their kids in a town in a region of a communist country, Romania, trying to offer them\na carefree childhood. A lot of respect and compassion for those whose childhood was difficult, whose\nparents suffered at the hands of the regime, etc ... this group is maybe not for you. (\"About\" section)\nThis is obviously more than a precaution against vexing other sensibilities. It is also a means to\nensure that those who do join the group share the same outlook and can create a coherent genera-\ntiography. More importantly, it is an indication of class belonging that remains largely unarticu-\nlated and only vaguely traceable in comments.\nBy now, it is a foregone conclusion in memory studies scholarship that \"quotidian, technolo-\ngized and digitized activities are inherently commemorative\" (Crownshaw, 2012: 237). Scholars\nlike Morris-Suzuki (2005) have attempted to differentiate between types of mnemonic engage-\nments facilitated by sociotechnical affordances of different media, concluding that some \"seem\nreadily adaptable to the tasks of interpretation and analysis, others [...] seem more readily given to\ntasks of evoking identification with the experience of the past\" (p. 23). The Facebook generatiog-\nraphy falls in the latter category. By facilitating the sharing and archiving of visual memorabilia\nand promoting instant identification through liking, sharing, and commenting Facebook generati-\nographies configure an alternative yet fairly uniform affective re-attachment to the past.\nGeneratiographical objects\nIn this section, I would like to turn to the ways in which users of Facebook latchkey communities\ncurate generational identity through material memories. In Facebook generatiographies, the com-\nmunist past is \"personal, visual and collectable\" (Kitch, 2006), a socially curated archive of photo-\ngraphs, where the archiving affordances of Facebook play a big role in what is being remembered\nand how the \"story\" is written. So, then, what stories get told around or through objects? What\nprecisely happens when \"the print autobiography is no longer the only medium,\" to paraphrase\nAnn Rigney? In her article, Rigney (2010) claims that \"the possibilities afforded by hypertext gen-\nerate connections that are associative rather than chronological, and that [...] often rely on the\nsame iconic images as placeholders for new stories\" (p. 115). It is communist memorabilia that\nplay this role of placeholders for the generational stories of Romania's \"latchkey kids, as digital\nmemory objects that are distributed throughout the network\" (Van Doorn, 2011: 540). Proper nar-\nratives are few and far between on these Facebook groups. Instead, members discuss the biography\nof the objects posted, reminisce about the practices surrounding them, inquire into their availability\nor state whether they owned them or still do. Posts sometimes trigger archival responses from\nmembers, whose photo-comments are meant to add to a series (Figure 3: one commenter adds the\nphotograph of another cigarette brand in response to the post and garners 231 likes) or to contribute\nunrelated iconic items that are felt to be missing.\nSeeing that communist memorabilia is conspicuously absent offline,18 these groups afford a\nnew form of remembering together through these shareable and spreadable \"icons of failed time\"\n(Bartmanski, 2011), which are heavily imbued with nostalgic attachment. This is more clearly the\ncase with \"Childhood in the 80s\u00ad90s\" where the \"About\" section invites visitors to browse albums\nat their leisure. \"The Latchkey Generation\" features albums put together towards the beginning of\nits online presence, but has become considerably more random and disjointed, focusing more on\n\"folk wisdom,\" possibly a sign of the exhaustion of the archive of memorabilia and a continuation\nof archiving feeling \"by other means.\"\nPost-communist generationalities are often associated with nostalgic remembrance. One only\nhas to think of the film Goodbye Lenin (dir. Wolfgang Becker, 2003) to understand how different\ntypes of nostalgia have been linked with generational identities in post-communist memory dis-\ncourses. Theorizations of post-communist nostalgia are too rich to review here, but nostalgic affect\nis crucial in Facebook generatiographies, so a few distinctions are in order. Svetlana Boym's cat-\negorization in two discrete typologies (the restorative and the reflective) has been seminal in aca-\ndemic discourse until recently. In public discourse, another, less refined polarization exists between\nthe reactionary nostalgia of the retired working-class that wishes the social security of communism\nback as opposed to the more playful and ironic nostalgia of those coming of age in 1989, who know\nfull well communism was grim and can make fun of it tenderly, precisely because they are now\nsuccessful neoliberal subjects.19 Needless to say, empirically, things are fuzzier than this asym-\nmetrical binary and more recent academic work has challenged such enduring distinctions. For\nexample, the tendency to explain post-socialist nostalgia as a form of mourning of a failed utopian\nproject or the collective romanticizing of the past due to a failure to \"catch up\" (e.g. Buck-Morss,\nThere have also been calls for the \"de-essentialization and de-ontologization\" of nostalgia\n(Velikonja, 2008: 29). Echoing Karen Stewart's plea to treat nostalgia as a \"cultural practice, not a\ngiven content\" (Stewart, 1988), Nadkarni and Shevchenko (2015) warn against the belief that \"the\nvery structure of nostalgia endows it with a particular political meaning\" (p. 63). In the same vein,\nVelikonja (2008) defines nostalgia as \"a set of generally unconnected semiological strategies, oper-\nations and exchanges in various environments and among different groups of people engaging in\nthem with a special purpose, or even without any purpose\" (pp. 28\u00ad29). Emphasizing the mutabil-\nity of nostalgia, Velikonja (2008) notes the \"ahistoricity, ex-temporality, ex-territoriality, sensual-\nity, complementarity, conflicted story lines, unpredictability, polysemism and episodic nature\" (p.\n28) of nostalgic narratives. Post-communist nostalgia has been reconsidered as a search for icono-\nlogical consistency (Bartmanski, 2011; Oushakine, 2007), with the success of nostalgic icons\nattributed to them being \"mnemonic bridges to rather than tokens of longing for the failed com-\nmunist past\" (Bartmanski, 2011: 213). Serguei Oushakine defines it as \"an attempt to chronologi-\ncally enclose, to `complete' the past in order to correlate it with the present\" (Oushakine, 2007:\n455). Facebook generatiographies have a structuring effect on nostalgic forms of attachment to the\npast. Borrowing heavily on the retro style so present in social media at large, Romanian Facebook\ngeneratiographies blend in transnational generational templates (e.g. the listicles \"You know you\nwere born in the 1980s if ...\"), nostalgia for obsolete media, nostalgia for consumer practices, and\nnostalgia for the perceived innocence and stability of communism. Although there has been\nresearch into the diverse mediations of post-communist nostalgia (Todorova, 2010; Todorova and\nGille, 2010), closer engagement with media affordances as factors in nostalgic remembering is\nlacking. In Facebook generatiographies, multiple templates and semiotic practices are juxtaposed,\ncreating different patterns of generational nostalgia. I therefore find it more useful to withhold\ndiagnoses of nostalgia and instead focus on how users mediate various nostalgic modes or deflect\naccusations of reactionary nostalgia through engagement with materiality.\nBy sharing memorabilia from their communist childhoods, users turn them into \"mediated\nmemories that become socialized as digitally material artefacts which are durable as well as muta-\nble, reflexive as well as performative\" (Van Doorn, 2011: 541). In an environment that functions\nalgorithmically and where content is constantly recirculated and can pop up unexpectedly in one's\nnewsfeed, Schwartz observes that \"Rather than relations of possession, people then have neigh-\nbourly relations with the memory objects that populate their digital environments\" (Schwarz, 2013:\n7). Indeed, discussions often revolve around the ownership of the actual objects archived as photo-\ngraphs online, pointing to how these are rarely part of some purposeful collection, but rather the\nlackluster junk of the transition, rediscovered in the homes of parents or bottoms of cupboards.\nHowever, the amateur photographs show close-ups of objects displayed against non-descript back-\ngrounds, removed from their everyday material embeddedness and staged as iconic (see Figure 2),\nwhile others are clearly represented following the \"mash up aesthetics\" of the online, with collages\nfeaturing quite prominently (see Figure 3). Although the commercialization of communist memo-\nrabilia has never taken off in Romania as, for example, in Germany, in Figure 4, the photo bears the\nwatermark of a buying and selling site, okazii.ro, showing how content flows and is repurposed in\nFacebook generatiographies. This retreat into the realm of everyday materialities is shaped by the\nspecifics of Facebook remembrance practices. Little would Romanians in the 1990s have imagined\nthat communist \"things\" would ever be given a new lease of life. Nowadays, as the \"latchkey\"\nFacebook page is becoming typified, communist memorabilia have entered a new cycle of their\n\"social life\" (Appadurai, 1986), facilitated by the specific curatorial affordances of SNSs (Giaccardi,\n2012). These material memories enable an avoidance of a clear stance towards the past, a retreat\ninto the thingness of the objects on display, perhaps even a sort of \"infantile citizenship\" (Berlant,\nThere are few instances where users engage with the multimodal objects posted in ways other\nthan the performative actions baked into the Facebook interface. One such example is one com-\nment to the post in Figure 2. For one user, the insignia of the Falcons of the Motherland communist\nyouth organization triggered the recounting of an anecdotic episode:\nWow. The Falcons of the Motherland. Here's a really funny experience related to these falcons. I remember\nI was well past the \"falcon\" age, but comrade Ceausescu was organizing a march and there were not\nenough falcons (they needed more), so our teacher made us wear the Falcon uniforms (although we were\nPioneers and the Falcon uniforms looked shrunken) and off we went. I distinctly remember that the teacher\nasked me and my mate Alexandru (maybe because we were the brightest or maybe because our parents\nwere family friends of the teacher's :D) to march in the first line and shout out slogans. Thing is I can't\nremember what the slogans were, but at some point Alex and I deviated from them and I think it came out\nas something \"against the government\" because I can still remember the teacher, the colour of her face\nalternating between white as a sheet and red as beetroot, pulling us to the last ranks, saying \"let's hope\nnobody heard you. So ... the times of the falcons were really good ones.\" (D Z 19.04.2011)\nMembership in \"The Falcons of the Motherland\" organization is remembered ambivalently:\ndespite the anecdotic style, the hypocrisy of the system and the fear it could instill are not eschewed.\nHowever, communist childhood experiences are framed as facilitating mischief, playful--or\nFigure 2. Photo of a \"Falcons of the Motherland\" insignia.\nSource: https://www.facebook.com/#!/Generatia.Cu.Cheia.La.Gat (accessed 16 June 2014).\ninvoluntary--subversion, protected by age from any of the moral implications of participating in propa-\ngandistic activities that accounts of adult experiences.\nMost comments are often repetitive (sometimes tens of members will comment confirming they\nowned/own the objects in the photos with very little variation in phrasing), and one might rightly\npresume that the aura of the rediscovered object is worn away through repetition. However, this\ncanonizing of communist memorabilia proves crucial to identity construction. Facebook generati-\nographers construct themselves as collectors and consumers of the discredited junk of commu-\nnism, involved in \"socially distributed curation\" (Liu, 2012), working against the silencing of the\nbanal, the trivial, the everyday of late socialist Romania, and salvaging \"ordinary affects\" (Stewart,\n2009). Symbolically recuperating these \"generatiographical objects\"--to paraphrase Janet Hoskins\n(1998)--is tantamount to recuperating one's biography from a period that has been stripped of any\npositive association and demonstrating valuable insider's knowledge:\nSome are too young to know that the bottle cap contained CO2 cartridges to turn water into syphon ... that thieves\nleft the car resting on four milk bottles when they stole the tyres ... that these cups were proof that you had been\nto the mountains, and you'd display them at home after you \"collected' them from the resorts ... or that if you\nsmoked snagov, especially the filter cigarettes, you were cool ... MEMORIES. (Mihai Tabrea 27.02.2014)\nSuch comments affirm the enviable material culture knowledge of those who are \"old\nenough\" to remember the whole world of associations around everyday objects, which comes\nFigure 3. A collage of photos representing a seltzer water bottle, milk bottles, a coffee cup marked with\nthe logo of a Romanian mountain resort hotel and a pack of Romanian cigarettes.\nSource: https://www.facebook.com/Generatia.Cu.Cheia.La.Gat (accessed 14 October 2014).\nto contrast sharply with previous discourses which operated with the trope of communism as\ndisease, and concluded that \"several generations have to pass\" before the nation can be\n\"healthy\" again. For example, the queuing experience--a commonplace of representations of\ncommunism, the totem of humiliation, poverty or, at best, forcible solidarity--is re-signified\nas joyful adventure:\nOh, those were the days!!! At 21 h on the dot, a gang of fifteen-twenty children would gather outside the\napartment building, holding bags with empty milk bottles ... and surprisingly we weren't the first to queue.\nWe'd be so upset and disappointed ... but we'd soon get over it. We were going to spend the night queuing\nlest someone should throw our bags out of the line ... moments I'm sure we all dearly remember.\nThese memories of how fun was had despite and to spite the shortcomings with childlike verve\nact as a palliative for dominant accounts about the utter senselessness of the recent past.\nSince the discourse on the communist past has been \"confiscated\" by intellectual elites after\n1989, this is also an exercise in articulating the sensibilities of other socio-economic classes.\nGeneratiographies introduce a sort of nostalgia for deprivation that is paradoxically quenched by a\nvisual consumerism of the kind afforded by Facebook. This type of symbolic consumerism is only\napparently paradoxical. As Jonathan Bach (2002) notes with reference to German post-unification\nidentities: \"the socialist system worked to constantly deprive and stimulate consumer desire in an\nongoing cycle\" (p. 550). This ambivalence towards consumption continued in post-communism\nonce the market was flooded with the formerly fetishized because inaccessible products, triggering\na re-valuation of the once despised domestic \"substitutes\" as \"a strategy [...] to not be speechless\nin a discursive field of cultural production that is dominated by the West\" (Bach, 2002: 554). In\nFacebook generatiographies, the construction of counter-narratives of consumption is afforded by\na new type of sociality--the connective sociality of SNS mediated by multimodal objects, which\nreplaces the sociality of solidarity and competition in \"making do\" with the little that was availa-\nble. Complex materialities are therefore part and parcel of nostalgic re-attachments to the past in a\nFigure 4. Photo of a milk bottle and an associated text written from the point of view of the object.\nglobalized culture of consumption, where a dialectic fetishism of consumer goods is used to nego-\ntiate the spatio-temporal constellations of post-communism.\nIn one particular example, the centrality of generatiographical objects goes so far as to make the\nobject \"do the remembering.\" The post in Figure 4 surprisingly borrows the voice of the object in\nan act of ventriloquism, speaking for a whole generation:\nHello ... I am the milk bottle and in my day the country was muuuch cleaner, why? Because there were no\nplastic bottles or bags to discard, these were made of paper and even though paper is made out of tree\ntrunks there were a billion times more of those than there are now! Not to mention the taste! Taste and\naromas are kept intact in glass or paper as compared to plastic or aluminum! And yes, the Latchkey\nGeneration was used to recycling paper, cleaning up the workspace or the playground ... You could say:\nWhat, did you work? Yes, we did hours of industrial or agricultural practice and that's how we got an idea\nabout what work really is and we were also able to compare; only by comparing can you know what's good\nfor you and what isn't!\nBlending in environmental concerns with reflections on preparedness for the labor market (rem-\niniscent of the Generation X vs the Millenials discourse), this post uses the voice of the object to\ndeflect potential accusations of actual support for the communist regime. One comment breaks the\ngenerational sense of pride amply supported by many of the posts and comments by introducing a\n\"latchkey\" identity that is characterized by doubt and uncertainty:\nI speak in the name of those born in 1973, we didn't kill Ceauescu, we were too young, but we remember\nhim ... we would have received housing and holidays ... we are the first to have lost, we didn't understand\nmuch from democracy either, it rolled over our lives ... if it's good or bad, I don't think the latchkey\nAlthough infrequent, the argumentative exchange above points to potential ethical controver-\nsies. Because it seems to display \"restorative nostalgia\" (Boym, 2001) instead of keeping in line\nwith the \"apolitical\" generatiographical nostalgia, one commenter takes issue with the page admin\nover the post in Figure 4: \"admins of the latchkey generation, other posts and comments are inter-\nesting, but this one sounds like you're siding with Ceausescu's nostalgics, better go to North Korea\npm).An interesting temporal layering can be read between the lines here: members of the Facebook\nlatchkey generation may be nostalgic, but the commenter pleas distancing from \"Ceauescu's nos-\ntalgics\"--generally associated with the older generation. Different generations, different nostal-\ngias, the comment seems to imply. This is quite a common rhetorical move, as Nadkarni and\nShevchenko (2015) note, \"in order to retain an aura of authenticity, nostalgia has a stake in insist-\ning on its political neutrality\" (p. 80). Dissociation from the nostalgia of older generations doubles\nas both a generational marker, as well as a refusal to admit to the politics of nostalgia inherent in\nthe \"lighter\" and more \"youthful\" recollections of the latchkey generation. Projecting \"political\nbackwardness onto nostalgic practices elsewhere\" (Nadkarni and Shevchenko, 2015: 81), in this\ncase onto the older generation serves to further deflect.\nThe examples discussed in this section have revealed the compelling interdependence between\nsocial media grassroots heritage practices and identity construction in Romanian generatiogra-\nphies. Through the iconic reconstruction of personal and collective biographies via the biography\nof objects, members of Facebook communities are aestheticizing memory and creating templates\nthat perform a semiotic and axiological re-framing of communism. Their discourse is not so much\noppositional to previous or contemporary anti-communist ones as it is concerned with valuing\ngenerational structures of feeling. This generatiographical mode of remembering is an attempt at\nsense-making through things, an exercise in mapping out the ruins of the past and rediscovering\ntheir use-value for present identity-construction needs.\nIn Facebook generatiographies, generationality is defined by knowledge of material culture\nas well as by various rhetorical moves meant to keep accusations of instrumentalizing nostalgia\nat bay. Members and admins aim to separate themselves from the older nostalgics in not claim-\ning outright that \"communism was better\" but at the same time they do not indulge in a postmod-\nern game of blasphemous irony. They seem to approach the past with a \"new sincerity\" (Yurchak,\nFacebook generatiographies in a \"translocal\" perspective\nAs we have seen so far, Romanian Facebook generatiographies advocate the latchkey generation's\nrelevance in genealogical as well as social terms as a dynamic, adaptable generation. In post-\ncommunist Romania, this generational discourse fulfills particular functions. But are its means\nidiosyncratic? To what extent is this, strictly speaking, a post-communist generational discourse?\nAs I have noted at the beginning of this article, the generatiography is a genre that has surfaced in\nGermany, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States alike. A simple Facebook search\nusing keywords such as \"80's childhood,\" \"80's kids,\" \"80s nostalgia\" yields a wealth of western-\nbased generatiographies: \"80s kids rule,\" \"Raising 80s Awareness,\" \"70s &80s kids That's how we\nrolled\"--to name a few evocative examples. Let us zoom in on one example. The Facebook com-\nmunity page\"70's &80's kids, That's how we rolled,\" set up in August 2012 states its purpose in its\nAbout section: \"This page is based in Glasgow uk it's for everyone who grew up in the `70s & `80s.\nFeel free to share your favorite toys, sweets, tv shows ect[sic]& whatever else you remember. hope\nyou all enjoy this page xx.\" The mixed function of archiving material culture and the memory\ndiscourse around it is strikingly similar to what we have seen in the Romanian examples. The page\nhas garnered 230,637 likes20 and features mostly timeline photos, but also three albums specially\ndedicated to collecting photographs of childhood sweets and foodstuff, home ware and fashion.\nThe members of the `70s\u00ad`80s Facebook community \"'70s\u00ad`80s, that's how we rolled.\" are\nengaged in similar generational life-writing processes (compare Figures 4 and 5).\nFigure 5, for example, presents a different cultural setting to the milk bottle, this time occurring\nin Thatcher's 1980s, also generating more political comments alongside evocations of sensory\nexperiences. The ambivalence of the poor quality of the product and the disappointment of not\nreceiving it anymore invites interesting parallels with the complex relationship Romanian children\nhad with the milk bottle and the everyday practices around it. However, there is no disagreement\namong commenters and no sense of entering a potential ethical minefield of nostalgia, which goes\nto show how post-communist nostalgia even when focused on \"childhood things\" remains more\nproblematic than its \"western\" counterpart.\nGiven the clearly identifiable generic features present in Facebook generatiographies across\nnational borders, it is perhaps safe to claim that a return to genre, particularly within a platform\nsuch as Facebook, might invite fruitful exchange and comparison between \"western\" and \"eastern\"\nbrands of nostalgia or even destabilize these awkward dichotomies. However, I am by no means\nsuggesting that this should be done at the expense of local sensibilities by isolating genres from the\nrhetorical contexts in which they operate or by neglecting national or regional social networking\nplatforms. Instead, my claim is that further research into the translocal dynamics of cultural tem-\nplates would be fruitful, also in view of recent appeals for reconceptualizing \"post-communist\nnostalgia\" in the economy of affect afforded by social media.21 As Dirk Uffelmann (2014) notes,\n\"Only an integrated approach to genre, which encompasses technical conditions as well as rhetori-\ncal rules and cultural particularities, can help us understand how memory emerges and changes\nonline\" (p. 1), given that genre is a \"decisive mediator\" on the transnational (or perhaps better said,\ntranslocal) social media stage (Uffelmann, 2014: 16). Facebook generatiographies operate on a\nmiddle ground negotiating between the \"global\" online media and \"local\" nostalgic modalities.\nEspecially when dealing with social media where these tensions endure in even more challenging\nforms, the type of reflection on form-content-context that genre invites can thus open new spaces\nfor discussion.\nConclusion\nThis article has investigated the generational discourse of the Romanian latchkey generation as\nmediated and rhetorically constructed on Facebook, paying close attention to its generic actualiza-\ntion. Genre has been shown to be analytically useful in understanding the mediated nature of\nmemory as it brings together cultural and media templates, discursive contexts and users, revealing\nhow they co-construct each other. Operating as a welcome middle term between content analysis\n(which can lack medium-specificity) and media technology analysis (which risks media determin-\nism), genre is methodologically useful in the expanding field of digital memory studies, particu-\nlarly in light of recent focus on transcultural memory processes and re-evaluations taking place in\npost-communist studies. Although the scope of the article does not allow for a proper investigation\nof these potentials, I hope to have made a case for the need for further study.\nThe latchkey generation discourse as actualized in Facebook generatiographies has been shown\nto be predicated upon the interdependence between alternative affective engagements with the past\nand a new relationship with communist materialities. The members of the latchkey generation act as\nproud virtual collectors-consumers of communist memorabilia justify their curatorial practices\nthrough their specific generational location, which allegedly allows a more detached perspective.\nRutten cogently explains how post-soviet fighters in \"web memory wars\" would be wrongly labeled\ndigital \"tourists of history\" (Sturken, 2007) and more aptly described as \"digital archaeologists'\nFigure 5. The post asks \"Who remembers free school milk?\" and has garnered around nine thousand\nlikes.\n(Rutten, 2013). In Romanian generatiographies, it appears that both concepts help to illuminate dif-\nferent aspects of the mnemonic and affective labor (Hardt, 1999) on Facebook.\nIn Romanian latchkey kids' approach to online heritage practices lies implicit the claim that\ntheirs is a liminal generation--well-versed in Cold War realities but also conversant with capital-\nism and democracy. However, \"material success and fluency with the new transnational `rules of\nthe game' does not preclude a resistance to fitting seamlessly within the new global order.\"\n(Nadkarni and Shevchenko, 2015: 79) and Facebook generatiographies give some insight into how\nthis negotiation plays out within a specific social media genre.\nConstructed as a generation of hope in 1989 and as a disappointed generation in the 1990s, a\ngeneration who would have to simply wait it out until the past is erased from Romanian collective\nmemory, the latchkey generation has been rediscovered as \"news\" in the 2000s and reinvested with\ndifferent social significance. Generational (re) attachments to the communist past are highly medi-\natized and mediated discursive formations that are very much in flux and whose capacity for politi-\ncal mobilization deserves further investigation.\n"
