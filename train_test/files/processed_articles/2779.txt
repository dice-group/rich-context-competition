To date, no large-scale study has examined the comorbidity and continuity of\npsychiatric disorders after youth leave detention.\nOBJECTIVE To determine the comorbidity and continuity of psychiatric disorders among\nyouth 5 years after detention.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective longitudinal study of a stratified random\nwhite, 524 Hispanic, and 4 other race/ethnicity) recruited from the Cook County Juvenile\nTemporary Detention Center, Chicago, Illinois, between November 20, 1995, and June 14,\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES At baseline, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children\nVersion 2.3. At follow-ups, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (child\nand young adult versions) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version IV (substance use\ndisorders and antisocial personality disorder).\nRESULTS Five years after detention, when participants were 14 to 24 years old, almost 27% of\nmales and 14% of females had comorbid psychiatric disorders. Although females had\nsignificantly higher rates of comorbidity when in detention (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7),\nmales had significantly higher rates than females at follow-up (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI,\n1.6-3.3). Substance use plus behavioral disorders was the most common comorbid profile\namong males, affecting 1 in 6. Participants with more disorders at baseline were more likely to\nhave a disorder approximately 5 years after detention, even after adjusting for demographic\ncharacteristics. We found substantial continuity of disorder. However, some baseline\ndisorders predicted alcohol and drug use disorders at follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although prevalence rates of comorbidity decreased in youth\nafter detention, rates remained substantial and were higher than rates in the most\ncomparable studies of the general population. Youth with multiple disorders at baseline are at\nhighest risk for disorder 5 years later. Because many psychiatric disorders first appear in\nchildhood and adolescence, primary and secondary prevention of psychiatric disorders offers\nthe greatest opportunity to reduce costs to individuals, families, and society. Only a\nconcerted effort to address the many needs of delinquent youth will help them thrive in\nadulthood.\nSupplemental content at\njamapsychiatry.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Health\nDisparities and Public Policy,\nDepartment of Psychiatry and\nBehavioral Sciences, Northwestern\nUniversity Feinberg School of\nMedicine, Chicago, Illinois (Abram,\nWelty, Hershfield, Teplin); Houston\nOCD Program, Houston, Texas\n(Zwecker); Department of Preventive\nMedicine, Northwestern University\nFeinberg School of Medicine,\nChicago, Illinois (Welty); Department\nof Psychiatry and Behavioral\nSciences, Northwestern University\nFeinberg School of Medicine, Ann &\nRobert H.

User on 11/20/2015\n \nThe prevalence of psychiatric disorders among juvenile\ndetainees has been well established.1,2 Almost two-\nthirds of males and three-quarters of females entering\njuvenile detention have 1 or more psychiatric disorders.2 Co-\nmorbid disorders are also common in this population, affect-\ning approximately half of the youth in detention.3,4\nFar less is known about youth after they leave detention.\nTeplin et al5 found that after detention prevalence rates of psy-\nchiatric disorders decreased but were still substantially higher\nthan general population rates. Five years after detention, half\nof the males and 40% of females had 1 or more psychiatric dis-\norders. However, longitudinal studies to date have examined\nonly the prevalence and persistence of specific disorders such\nas major depression or alcohol use disorders. To our knowl-\nedge, no study has examined the comorbidity and continuity\nof psychiatric disorders after youth leave detention.\nMany excellent general population studies have exam-\nined the comorbidity and continuity of disorders. However,\nfindings are not generalizable to detained youth for 2 rea-\nsons. First, the demographic characteristics of youth in de-\ntention are different from those of the general population.6\nYouth in detention are disproportionately poor, and racial/\nethnic minorities are overrepresented.6,7 More than any other\nracial/ethnic group, African Americans are disproportion-\nately incarcerated,6 comprising about 14% of the general\npopulation8 but about 40% of youth and young adults in cor-\nrectional facilities.9,10 Second, delinquent youth are system-\naticallyunderrepresentedingeneralpopulationinvestigations.5\nSchool-based samples exclude youth who are truant, have\ndropped out, or are incarcerated. Household surveys exclude\nincarcerated youth. Samples drawn from pediatric clinics ex-\nclude those who do not receive medical treatment. Even if\nsampled initially, delinquent youth may be lost to follow-up\nwhen they are incarcerated because they cannot be found and\nbecausestudyingprisonersrequiresspecialproceduresandap-\nprovals from the Secretary of Health and Human Services.11\nData on the comorbidity and continuity of disorders in de-\nlinquent youth are needed for 3 reasons. First, comorbid dis-\norders present significant challenges.12,13 Persons with comor-\nbid disorders are less responsive to traditional treatments than\nthose with only one disorder12 and are more difficult to place\nintreatmentbecausetheirneedscrosstraditionalboundaries.13\nSecond, identifying diagnostic predictors of later disorder has\nramifications for secondary prevention, treatment, and policy\ninthecommunity.14,15 Juveniledetaineeshaveamedianlength\nof stay of only 2 weeks.16 After release, juvenile detainees be-\ncome the responsibility of the community. Third, longitudi-\nnal studies of correctional populations provide needed data\nto address health disparities, a priority of the Institute of\non females are especially needed because they are a growing\nminority in the juvenile justice system, now comprising 30%\nof juvenile arrests.19\nThisisthefirstarticlefromtheNorthwesternJuvenileProj-\nect to examine the comorbidity and continuity of psychiatric\ndisorders after youth leave detention; a prior article exam-\nined the prevalence and persistence of single disorders.5 We\nexamine3questions.Whatarethepatternsofcomorbidity,and\nhow do they change over time? Among youth with a specific\ndisorder at baseline, what are the odds that they will have the\nsame disorder at follow-up (homotypic prediction)?14 Among\nyouth with a specific disorder at baseline, what are the odds\nthat they will have a different disorder at follow-up (hetero-\ntypic prediction)?14\nMethods\nThe most relevant information on our methods is summa-\nrizedbelow.AdditionalinformationisavailableintheeMethods\nin the Supplement and is published elsewhere.2,3,5,20\nProcedures to Obtain Assent and Consent at Baseline\nand Follow-up\nThe Northwestern University Institutional Review Board and\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Institutional\nReview Board approved all study procedures and waived pa-\nrental consent for persons younger than 18 years, consistent\nwithfederalregulationsregardingresearchwithminimalrisk.21\nFor all interviews, participants signed either an assent form (if\n<18 years old) or a consent form (if 18 years old).\nSample and Procedures\nWe recruited a stratified random sample of 1829 youth at in-\ntake to the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Cen-\nter in Chicago, Illinois, between November 20, 1995, and June\n14, 1998, who were awaiting the adjudication or disposition of\ntheir case. The Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention\nCenter is used for pretrial detention and for offenders sen-\ntenced for less than 30 days.\nTo ensure adequate representation of key subgroups, we\nstratified our sample by sex, race/ethnicity (African Ameri-\ncan, non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, or other), age (10-13 or 14\nyears), and legal status at detention (processed in juvenile or\nadult court). Face-to-face structured interviews were con-\nducted at the detention center in a private area, most within 2\ndays of intake.\nFollow-up interviews were scheduled for 3 and 4\u00bd years\nafter baseline. For each follow-up, we interviewed partici-\npants whether they lived in the community or in correctional\nfacilities. Table 1 lists characteristics of the sample.\nMeasures\nBaseline\nWe administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Chil-\nmostrecentEnglishandSpanishversionsthenavailable,which\nassesses disorders in the past 6 months. Because the DISC-2.3\ndid not include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we used\nthe module from the DISC-IV when it became available 13\nFollow-up Interviews\nWe administered the DISC-IV (child and young adult ver-\nsions), based on the DSM-IV, to assess schizophrenia, mood\ndisorders, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity\nPsychiatric Disorders in Youth After Detention Original Investigation Research\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc. User on 11/20/2015\n \ndisorder (ADHD), and disruptive behavior disorders in the past\nyear.25 To assess past-year substance use disorders and anti-\nsocial personality disorder (APD), we administered the Diag-\nnostic Interview Schedule Version IV.26 As in our group's prior\nwork,5 we checked that changes in prevalence rates over time\nwere not due to changes in measurement.\nVariables\nWeconductedanalysesofspecificdisordersand2derivedvari-\nables. The first variable is the number of disorders, including\nthe count of disorders among mania, major depression, hypo-\nmania, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic\ndisorder,PTSD,ADHD(if17yearsold),conductdisorder(if17\nyearsold),oppositionaldefiantdisorder(ODD)(if17yearsold),\nAPD (if 18 years old), and alcohol and drug use disorders. The\nsecond variable comprises categories of disorder, including in-\nternalizing (mania, major depression, hypomania, dysthy-\nmia, GAD, panic disorder, and PTSD), substance (alcohol and\ndrugusedisorders),andbehavioral(conductdisorder,ODD,and\nAPD). Participants self-identified their race/ethnicity (African\nAmerican, Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, or other).\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using commercial software\n(STATA, version 12; StataCorp LP) with its survey routines.27\nTo generate prevalence rates and inferential statistics that re-\nflect the population of the Cook County Juvenile Temporary\nDetention Center, each participant was assigned a sampling\nweight augmented with a nonresponse adjustment to ac-\ncount for missing data.28 Taylor series linearization was used\nto estimate standard errors.29,30 Because mental health needs\nof youth in detention differ by sex,2,3 we conducted separate\nanalyses for males and females.\nWe present prevalence rates of disorder at 3 time points:\nbaseline (time 0), time 1, and time 2. As in our group's prior\nwork,2 time 1 is the first follow-up interview but excludes in-\nterviews that occurred more than 18 months after the inter-\nview due date. The median time between baseline and time 1\nTime 1 follow-up interviews were conducted between Novem-\ntime 1 interview as occurring approximately 3 years after base-\nline. Table 1 summarizes the sample's demographics and re-\ntention; 90.7% of participants had a time 1 interview.\nTime 2 is the 4\u00bd-year follow-up interview. As with time 1,\nwe excluded interviews that occurred more than 18 months\nafter this due date. The median time between baseline and the\nrange, 4.3-6.0 years). Time 2 follow-up interviews were con-\nity, we subsequently refer to the time 2 interview as occur-\nring approximately 5 years after baseline; 82.2% of participants\nhad a time 2 interview (Table 1) (see the eMethods in the\nSupplement for additional details on time 2).\nWe used logistic regression for 2 analyses. First, we exam-\nineddemographicdifferencesincomorbidity(2disorders[yes\nor no]) at time 2. Second, we examined whether the number\nof disorders at baseline was associated with having at least 1\ndisorder at time 2.\nModels for Continuity of Disorders Over Time\nWe used a sequence of logistic regression models to examine\ncontinuityofdisordersovertime.First,intheunadjustedmodel\nthe disorder at baseline was the single predictor of the disor-\nder at follow-up. For example, is major depression at baseline\nassociatedwithalcoholusedisorderattime2?(Modelsinwhich\nthe baseline disorder predicts the same disorder at follow-up\narereferredtoashomotypicprediction.Modelsinwhichthebase-\nline disorder predicts a different disorder at follow-up are re-\nferred to as heterotypic prediction.) Second, in the adjusted\nmodel (heterotypic prediction only) we included whether the\ndisorder being predicted at follow-up was present at baseline\nas well. For example, is major depression at baseline associ-\natedwithalcoholusedisorderattime2,evenafteradjustingfor\nhaving alcohol use disorder at baseline? To determine whether\nconduct disorder predicted APD, we used a modified diagno-\nsisofAPDthatdidnotrequireadolescentconductdisorder.How-\never, because findings were not substantially different from\nTable 1.

All models predicting substance use disor-\nders at follow-up were adjusted for time in corrections (linear\nand quadratic terms for the number of days incarcerated in the\nyear before follow-up) because access to substances is typi-\ncally restricted in correctional settings.\nResults\nComorbidity of Psychiatric Disorders\nNumber of Disorders\nTable 2 lists prevalence rates of the number of disorders. One-\nthird of males at time 1 and more than one-quarter of males at\ntime 2 had 2 or more disorders. Although females were more\nlikely to have 2 or more disorders at baseline (odds ratio [OR],\nlikely than females to have 2 or more disorders at time 1 and\ncans had the lowest rates of comorbidity. At time 2, among\nmales non-Hispanic whites were more likely than African\nCI, 1.2-3.2) to have 2 or more disorders. At time 2, among fe-\nto have 2 or more disorders than African Americans.\nCategories of Disorder\nFigure 1 shows the overlap of 3 categories of disorder (inter-\nnalizing, substance, and behavioral) at baseline, time 1, and\ntime 2 for males and females. These figures show decreasing\noverlap of categories of disorder over time, especially for\nfemales. Among males, the most common comorbid profile\nat time 2 was substance use plus behavioral disorders (16%).\nContinuity of Disorders Over Time\nParticipants with more disorders at baseline were more\nlikely to have a disorder at time 2, even after adjusting for\ndemographic characteristics. For every additional disorder\nat baseline, the odds of having a disorder at time 2 increased\namong females. Among participants with all 3 types of dis-\norder at baseline (internalizing, substance, and behavioral),\nat time 2.\nFigure 2 (males) and Figure 3 (females) list prevalence\nrates of disorder at time 2 among those who did and did not\nhave a disorder present at baseline (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in\nthe Supplement list rates at time 1). Odds ratios contrast the\nprevalence of disorder at time 2 between those who had the\ndisorder at baseline compared with those who did not have\nthe disorder at baseline. The first OR is unadjusted, and the\nsecond OR is adjusted for the disorder at baseline (see the\nStatistical Analysis and Models for Continuity of Disorders\nOver Time subsections of the Methods section). Predictions\nbetween disorders belonging to the same category (eg, PTSD\nand GAD) are considered homotypic. We could not examine\ncontinuity of disorder for mania or hypomania because\nthere were too few cases at baseline. We could not predict\nmania, hypomania, dysthymia, panic disorder, or GAD at\ntime 1 or time 2 because prevalence rates were too low for\nstable estimates.\nMales\nSame Disorder at Follow-up (Homotypic Prediction) | Figure 2\nshows significant homotypic prediction of disorder among\nmales for major depression, APD (from baseline conduct\ndisorder), and alcohol use disorder.

Some argue\nthat neurobehavioral disinhibition underlies both behavioral\nandsubstanceusedisorders,suggestingasharedmechanism.40\nMood disorders may also lead to the abuse of substances (self-\nmedicationhypothesis).41 Finally,moodandsubstanceusedis-\norders may also stem from a common neurobiological path-\nway, increasing vulnerability to both disorders.42\nAmong females, no diagnostic profile predominated at fol-\nlow-up.Wefoundsubstantialcontinuityforalcoholanddruguse\ndisorders, APD (from conduct disorder), and anxiety disorders\n(GAD to PTSD).

In general population studies,14,43,44\nanxiety and depression commonly cross-predict.\nAlthough females were significantly more likely to have\ncomorbidity at baseline, 5 years after detention males were\nmore likely than females to have comorbid disorders. Be-\ncause males comprise more than 85% of youth in the juvenile\njustice system, mental health services for males are critical.10\nThe prevalence of comorbidity over time may differ by sex for\n3 reasons. First, female arrestees may be treated more leni-\nently by the courts than males and are more likely to be di-\nverted from detention (chivalry hypothesis).45 Therefore, fe-\nmales who are detained may be more dysfunctional and have\nmore problem behaviors and disorders than their male coun-\nterparts. Second, after detention females are more likely to re-\nceive mental health services than males.46 Third, females are\nless likely to persist in delinquency than males.47,48\nRacial/ethnic differences were similar to those for spe-\ncific disorders.5 African Americans had the lowest preva-\nlence of comorbidity, and non-Hispanic whites had the\nhighest. As noted in prior studies,2,5 these differences may\nreflect racial/ethnic disparities in criteria for detention.\nLimitations\nOur data are subject to the limitations of self-report. Moreover,\nit was not feasible to study more than 1 jurisdiction; generaliz-\nability may be limited to detained youth in urban centers with\nsimilar demographic compositions. Participants may have had\ndisorders that we did not examine; hence, overall prevalence\nrates may be higher than reported. We changed measures dur-\ning the follow-up period because of updates to the DSM and its\nassociated measures and because of the aging of our partici-\npants. We could not adjust for all comorbid disorders in predic-\ntive models owing to small cell sizes. Although retention rates\nwerehighandhypomaniawastheonlydisorderassociatedwith\ndropout, participants who missed interviews might be more\nlikely to have had disorders than those who were interviewed.\nThesamplewasrecruitedinthelate1990s;however,criticalfea-\ntures of the population (demographic characteristics, the in-\ncrease in delinquent females, and the disproportionate incar-\nceration of minorities) have not changed. Our findings do not\ntake into account any mental health services received.\nImplications for Mental Health Policy and Research\nProvide Coordinated Treatment for Youth Leaving Detention\nRecent efforts to improve interventions for delinquent popu-\nlations have highlighted several empirically supported mod-\nels to address not only their complex mental health needs (in-\ncluding comorbidity) but also their considerable psychosocial\nimpairments.49,50 These models have in common a system-\noriented, family-based approach that integrates treatment\nacross service sectors and settings.49,50 The Institute of Medi-\ncine's quality chasm series concluded that treatment of youth\n(and adults) with comorbid disorders continues to be compro-\nmised by our fragmented systems of care.51 The Patient Pro-\ntection and Affordable Care Act offers an opportunity to im-\nprove treatment by expanding access to care, payment reform,\nand information technology (to increase communication), as\nwell as integrating services such as medical homes that focus\nImplement Early Interventions to Prevent Substance Use Disorders\nBy the time youth are detained (age range, 10-17 years), it is\ntoo late for primary prevention.
