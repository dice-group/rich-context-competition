The Look\nAHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study [4]\ndesigned to be the definitive test of the long-term\nhealth benefits of a lifestyle intervention aimed at\nweight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes.\nThe primary hypothesis was that the lifestyle inter-\nvention would reduce the incidence of a composite\nendpoint of incident CVD defined as cardiovascular\ndeath (including fatal myocardial infarction and\nstroke), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal\nstroke. The secondary hypothesis was that the lifestyle\nintervention would reduce the incidence of a com-\nposite endpoint of all-cause death or incident CVD-\nrelated secondary outcomes defined in aggregate as\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery bypass\ngraft (CABG) surgery or percutaneous coronary (PC)\nintervention, hospitalization for congestive heart\nfailure (CHF), carotid endarterectomy, or surgical\nbypass or percutaneous intervention for peripheral\narterial disease.\nThe sample size was based on the aim of detecting\nan 18% difference in the primary endpoint in the\nintensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) compared to the\nDiabetes Support and Education (DSE) control group.\n(During the design of the trial, targets of 15%\u00ad20%\nfor interventions were identified as conveying sig-\nnificant public health benefit. The Steering\nCommittee selected an 18% intervention effect on\nwhich to base power projections because this\nappeared feasible and required a cohort sufficiently\nlarge to meet other objectives of the trial.) We made\nthe following assumptions: (1) The rate of incident\nCVD in the DSE group would be 3.125% per year\n(corresponding to the projected rate of incident CVD\nin a population of overweight and obese adults with\ntype 2 diabetes eligible for participation in Look\nAHEAD); (2) the cohort would be recruited uniformly\nover 2.5 years of follow-up; (3) in all, 2% of partici-\npants would be lost to endpoint ascertainment annu-\nally; and (4) participants lost to follow-up would be\nsimilar to their counterparts in regard to both treat-\nment and endpoint risk. Based on these assumptions,\nwe determined that 5000 participants followed up\n(with two-sided  = 0.05) to detect an 18% relative\ndifference in the composite primary endpoint (i.e.,\nin the DSE group versus an absolute event rate of\nThe 3.125% event rate was a best estimate based\non reported CVD event rates among individuals\nsimilar to those who were to be recruited for the\nstudy. Specifically, we used longitudinal data\nfrom diabetic participants in the Atherosclerosis\nRisk in Communities (ARIC) study [5] and the\nCardiovascular Health Study (CHS) [6]. We assumed\nthat 75% of Look AHEAD participants would have\nno history of CVD and that their age distribution\nwould represent an equal mixture of the ARIC (45\u00ad\nThe overall event rate for the combined ARIC + CHS\ndiabetic population was estimated to be 3.72%.

The\nSteering Committee therefore reconsidered the\npower projections in light of this lower-than-\nexpected event rate. For example, at a hypothetical\n2% event rate in the DSE group over 11.5 years of\nfollow-up (considerably lower than the anticipated\ndetect an 18% effect on the primary endpoint \u00ad less\nthan the originally planned 90% power but still\nacceptable. However, as Look AHEAD reached the\n3-year mark, the DSMB observed that the event rate\nin the DSE group was only 0.7% per year. In response\nto continuing DSMB concern, the Steering\nCommittee created an Endpoint Working Group\n(EPWG) to carefully consider the ramifications of\nthe lower-than-expected event rate and to recom-\nmend alternative approaches to preserve the study's\nintegrity and maximize its scientific value.\nEPWG\nThe EPWG included five Look AHEAD clinical\ninvestigators well versed in clinical trials, three\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists, and\ntwo clinical trials experts not affiliated with Look\nAHEAD (Table 1). Two members also served on the\nstudy's Adjudication Committee, responsible for\nascertaining endpoints. All EPWG members were\nmasked to study results, including the three NIH sci-\nentific officers (Evans, Kaufman, and Geller). The\nEPWG was charged with evaluating all relevant aspects\nof the study bearing on the lower-than-expected\nMidcourse correction when the event rate is underestimated 115\nevent rate, including the duration of follow-up and\ndefinition of the primary endpoint. To avoid bias\nand to maximize masking of the study investiga-\ntors, the EPWG only examined outcome data from\nthe DSE control group and shared only summary\ndata when making its recommendations to the\nSteering Committee. Neither the EPWG nor the\nSteering Committee was ever privy to the overall\nevent rate (DSE and ILI combined), so data on the\nevent rate in the DSE group did not effectively\nunblind them. The EPWG convened regularly to\ndeliberate and to review updated event rates. A\ntimeline of events and key study dates are provided\nin Figure 1.\nWhy Look AHEAD event rates\nwere lower than expected\nThe EPWG identified three possible reasons for the\nunexpectedly low CVD event rates:\n1. Secular trends have resulted in lower CVD inci-\ndence and CVD mortality in the United States:\nThe downward trend in CVD appears to result\nfrom (a) improved control of dyslipidemia and\nhigh blood pressure, which have reduced the\nrisk of clinically significant atherosclerosis and\n(b) improved care of chronic and acute coro-\nnary syndromes that have reduced CVD mortal-\n2. Study participants were even healthier than\nexpected: During trial design, the Coordinating\nCenter and Steering Committee relied heavily\non data from cohort studies like ARIC [5] and\nCHS [6]. The pattern of enrollment in cohort\nstudies, however, is markedly different from tri-\nals: cohort studies like these enroll 50% or more\nof eligible individuals in the community,\nwhereas trials forego representativeness in favor\nof motivation to participate fully in study\ninterventions.\n3. The Graded Exercise Test (GXT) excluded par-\nticipants most likely to develop CVD events: The\nstudy included a GXT as an inclusion criterion\nbased on concerns about safety and liability\nrelated to initiating an exercise program in\nadults with type 2 diabetes at high risk for CVD.\nThe GXT effectively excluded some higher-risk\nparticipants (e.g., those with prevalent sympto-\nmatic CVD) who demonstrated electrocardio-\ngraphic or blood pressure abnormalities during\nthe test. The prospect of a GXT may have also\ndiscouraged some individuals with exercise-\ninduced symptoms from attempting to enroll in\nthe trial.\nThe Steering Committee weighed all three of these\nhypothetical concerns during the design phase and\ndeflated the projected event rate by 20%. In retro-\nspect, however, the original event rate projections\nwere simply not conservative enough.\nOptions considered by the EPWG\n1. Watchful waiting: Because of the healthy vol-\nunteer effect, incident CVD events may be\ndelayed, yielding low event rates early in the\nstudy. To determine whether the lower-than-\nexpected event rates were accurate and firm,\nthe EPWG recommended watchful waiting\nwaiting, the event rate remained low. To be\ncertain that the persistently low event rate was\nnot related to delays in endpoint ascertain-\nment and reporting, the EPWG recommended\na `Data Sweep' in late 2007. The Data Sweep\nconfirmed that the cumulative event rate in\nthe DSE group had remained nearly linear\n2. Extend study duration: Absent a substantial\nincrease in event rates, extending the duration of\nTable 1.

However, with a stable\nevent rate that was about one-third of the pro-\njected rate and trending linear, a two- to three-\nfold extension of the study's duration would be\nrequired to obtain the required number of events.\nA more feasible and acceptable extension (e.g.,\n1\u00ad2 years) would provide too few events to\nachieve the required power.\n3. Broaden definition of the primary endpoint:\nThe third option considered by the EPWG was\nto broaden the definition of the primary end-\npoint. Such consideration was not taken lightly,\nsince adherence to primary endpoints as speci-\nfied in the original protocol is generally consid-\nered to be a cornerstone of clinical trial\nmethodology. However, the EPWG considered\nthe following:\na.

After Look AHEAD was initiated, there was a\nshift in the consensus among CVD trialists re-\ngarding standard study endpoints, prompted by\nadvances in diagnostic testing and downward\nsecular trends in myocardial infarction and\nc. An influential paper provided a roadmap for\nmodifying endpoints midstream in a long-term\nclinical trial when made by trialists blinded to\ntreatment effect [12]. The framework addressed\nthe possibility of extending duration and/or re-\ndefining study endpoints.\nd. All things considered, the DSMB deemed it\nscientifically more informative to evaluate the\neffect of the Look AHEAD intervention on a\nbroader endpoint rather than to terminate the\ntrial for futility, especially since the interven-\ntion had produced and sustained a substantial\ncontrast between study groups in body weight\nand physical activity.\nAdditional endpoints considered\nby EPWG to expand the original\ncomposite endpoint\nAs the EPWG considered expanding the primary\ncomposite endpoint to include additional end-\npoints, it posed the following five questions: (1)\nDoes obesity consistently predict the occurrence of\nthe endpoint in longitudinal epidemiologic studies?\n(2) Is the endpoint of sufficient clinical importance\nto serve in a composite endpoint alongside myocar-\ndial infarction, stroke, and CVD death? (3) Is the\nendpoint related to atherosclerotic CVD? As origi-\nnally written, the protocol enshrined atheroscle-\nrotic CVD as the study's main focus. Insofar as `new'\nprimary endpoints fall under this general category,\nthey fit more naturally with the original conceptual\nframework. (4) How susceptible is the endpoint to\nascertainment bias? It is crucial to avoid including\nin the primary endpoint any event that might be\nsusceptible to ascertainment bias; for example,\nchronic stable angina might be differentially\ndetected in the Lifestyle Intervention Group,\nbecause of more frequent exercise (which might\ninduce symptoms) and more frequent contact with\nstudy staff (which might trigger safety measures\nleading to medical evaluation and treatment). (5)\nHow acceptable is the endpoint to the study's\nstakeholders and scientific and clinical audience?\nMidstream changes in primary endpoints are apt to\nbe viewed with some suspicion by Look AHEAD's\nstakeholders and audience: the less traditional or\nfamiliar the endpoint, the more suspicious they\nmight be.\nCriteria for an `ideal' additional\nendpoint\nThe ideal additional endpoint(s) would therefore fit\nthe following five criteria: (a) related to obesity, (b)\nhigh clinical importance, (c) related to atheroscle-\nrotic CVD, (d) low risk of ascertainment bias, and\n(e) acceptable to stakeholders and audience. With\nthese criteria in mind, the EPWG reviewed the fol-\nlowing nine endpoints:\n1. All-Cause Mortality \u00ad Already a secondary end-\npoint. Since cardiovascular mortality was\nalready a primary endpoint, moving `all-cause'\nup from secondary to primary would amount to\nadding non-CVD deaths (e.g., cancer death and\naccidental death).\n2. Hospitalized Angina \u00ad Angina of sufficient con-\ncern to warrant hospitalization (see Figure 2).\n3. Urgent Revascularization \u00ad Angina of sufficient\nconcern to warrant revascularization during the\nhospitalization (i.e., surgery and angioplasty).\n4. Hospitalized CHF.\n5. Incident Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) \u00ad\nBased on serum creatinine at annual follow-\nup visits.\n6. Incident Obesity-Related Cancer \u00ad Defined as\ncancer of the prostate, corpus uteri or endo-\nmetrium, cervix, ovary, colon/rectum, biliary\ntract, esophagus, liver, pancreas, kidney, and\nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma, all of which\nappear to occur more frequently in obese\nadults.\n7. Incident Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) \u00ad\nBased on study electrocardiograms (ECGs).\n8. Deep Venous Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism \u00ad\nAs abstracted from hospital records.\n9. Fractures \u00ad Hip, upper leg, pelvis, knee, lower\nleg, ankle, foot (but not toe), coccyx, spine,\nlower arm, wrist, hand (not finger), elbow,\nupper arm, or shoulder.\nThe EPWG members selected these nine endpoints\nbased on their experience in other trials of diabetes\ntreatment and CVD prevention and on their knowl-\nedge of the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes and\nobesity.\nDeliberations regarding possible\nadditional endpoints\nThe EPWG evaluated each of these possible addi-\ntional primary endpoints in detail. These delibera-\ntions are summarized in Table 2, with particular\nattention to how each endpoint might meet the five\ncriteria listed above.\nThis deliberation led the EPWG to narrow the\nrange of potentially acceptable endpoints to four:\nall-cause mortality, hospitalized angina, urgent\nrevascularization, and hospitalized CHF. The ration-\nale for excluding other endpoints was as follows: (1)\nIncident CKD, as defined by using serum creatinine\nto estimate glomerular filtration rate, was consid-\nered to have insufficient clinical importance; (2)\ncancer was too incongruent with our original end-\npoints and the evidence to determine which cancers\nare `obesity related' was still unsettled; (3) LVH is\nprimarily asymptomatic and suffers from disagree-\nment about definition; (4) deep venous thrombosis/\npulmonary embolism has a wide range of gravitas,\nis less related to atherosclerosis than are other\nvascular endpoints, and has not been widely used in\ntrials or epidemiologic studies as part of a composite\nvascular endpoint; and (5) fractures have a wide\nrange of severity and are inversely associated with\nbody mass index.\nThus, the EPWG carefully considered the four\nremaining endpoints: all-cause mortality, hospital-\nized angina, urgent revascularization, and hospital-\nized CHF. These were reduced to three when the\nEPWG determined that virtually all of the urgent\nrevascularizations in Look AHEAD occurred in par-\nticipants who otherwise met criteria for hospitalized\nangina. The deliberations regarding all-cause mor-\ntality, hospitalized angina, and hospitalized CHF\nare summarized below.\nAll-Cause Mortality \u00ad The argument in favor was that\nall-cause mortality is the bottom line for patients\nand physicians and would provide a way to capture\neffects on important non-CVD events, like cancer\nor liver disease. The argument against was that (1)\nthese non-CVD events are best treated as secondary\nendpoints, since the primary hypothesis focuses on\nFigure 2.

[11]); and is fully congruent with\nthe original hypothesis. The argument against was\nthat (1) it might be difficult to distinguish `urgent'\ncases from `chronic' cases, the latter of which would\nbe susceptible to ascertainment bias in an unblinded\nTable 2.

However, the current Look\nAHEAD definition of hospitalized angina (see Figure\n2) mitigated both concerns: the definition clearly\nexcluded chronic stable angina and the definition\nhad already been smoothly implemented by the\nAdjudication Committee for several years without\ngenerating significant disagreements among com-\nmittee members.\nHospitalized CHF \u00ad The argument in favor was that\nCHF is common and important, it was already a\ncomponent of the composite secondary endpoint,\nand it might be improved by weight loss along a\nvariety of physiologic pathways (e.g., better exer-\ncise tolerance, reduced reliance on thiazolidinedio-\nnes, and improved lung function). The argument\nagainst was that (1) CHF is a heterogenous syn-\ndrome related not only to atherosclerosis but also to\nhypertension, renal disease, and other causes (e.g.,\nvalvular heart disease) generally not discernable\nfrom the records available to the study adjudicators,\nand (2) it is often difficult to distinguish from other\ncauses of acute dyspnea, especially chronic obstruc-\ntive pulmonary disease and pneumonia.\nAfter deliberation, the EPWG unanimously favored\nhospitalized angina and unanimously rejected hos-\npitalized CHF. A large majority was against all-cause\nmortality, but a minority favored it. Further discus-\nsion led to a consensus that the additional primary\nendpoint plus all-cause mortality should be an addi-\ntional major secondary analysis in the main results\nof this study.\nEvent rates if primary endpoint\ndefinition were expanded\nHaving evaluated the possible options for expand-\ning the primary endpoint on purely scientific\ngrounds, the EPWG then turned to the practical\nmatter of whether the potential additional end-\npoint occur frequently enough to augment the\noverall event rate. The coordinating center deter-\nmined that adding hospitalized angina to the pri-\nmary endpoint definition would approximately\ndouble the event rate in the DSE (control) group to\nFinal EPWG recommendation for\nresponse to lower-than-expected\nevent rate\nAfter over 2 years of monitoring, research, and\ndeliberation, the EPWG made the following recom-\nmendations to the Look AHEAD Steering Committee\nas a means to address the lower-than-expected event\nrate:\n1. Expand the primary endpoint to include hospi-\ntalized angina\n2. Extend the duration of the study by 24 months\n3. Specify two additional secondary endpoints\na. Original primary composite endpoint\nb.\nExpanded primary composite endpoint\nplus all-cause mortality\nNet effect of these\nrecommendations on statistical\npower\nEither (a) expanding the primary endpoint to\ninclude hospitalized angina without extending\nstudy duration or (b) extending study duration by 2\nyears without expanding the primary endpoint\nwould increase statistical power to detect an effect\nboth recommendations would push statistical\npower to roughly 75%, assuming no change in the\nevent rate in the second half of the study. If the\nunderlying event rate increased in the second half\nof the study, then adoption of both recommenda-\ntions would increase power to above 80% \u00ad that is,\ninto the conventional range for randomized con-\ntrolled trials. EPWG members recommended apply-\ning the same effect size (18% difference in risk of\nthe composite primary endpoint) to the expanded\nendpoint, because the causal pathways to hospital-\nized angina were so similar to the pathways leading\nto myocardial infarction and CVD death. The\nchange in the definition required an adjustment in\nthe formal statistical monitoring of the trial to pre-\nserve the prior level of  spending while transition-\ning to rules based on the expanded endpoint.\nAcceptability of recommendations\nto the scientific audience outside\nEven with the strongest scientific rationale, the\nEPWG considered how these recommendations\nmight be viewed by the scientific audience outside\nLook AHEAD. In the end, the EPWG consensus was\nthat the recommended modifications to the study\nprotocol would be well accepted for the following\nfour reasons: (1) they are responsive to generally\nrecognized secular trends in CVD, (2) they are\nconcordant with the study's original conceptual\nframework and primary hypothesis, (3) they were\ndeveloped and proposed by a group that was aware\nonly of event rates in the comparison group and\nMidcourse correction when the event rate is underestimated 121\notherwise fully blinded to treatment effects, and (4)\nthey were proposed 4 years the original before the\noriginally planned date of study close-out (December\nFinal decision by the Look AHEAD Steering\nCommittee\nThe EPWG presented its recommendations to the\nCommittee unanimously supported the recommen-\ndation. Throughout the decision-making process,\nthe DSMB chose to remain silent on the specifics of\nthe protocol change, because it believed that its\nunblinded status could otherwise introduce bias.\nBeyond asking the Steering Committee to review the\nlow event rate in the DSE group, the DSMB never\nindicated (a) whether it would have ended the trial\nfor futility had the protocol not been changed or (b)\nwhether the specific changes allayed its original con-\ncern. Although neither the EPWG nor the Steering\nCommittee were privy to DSMB deliberations, both\ngroups recognized that the DSMB was in the awk-\nward position of having prompted an inquiry into\nevent rates and endpoint definition without having\nthe latitude to comment on the investigators find-\nings or response. From the perspective of the EPWG\nand the Steering Committee, the investigators had\nresponded to the DSMB and saw only that the DSMB\ncontinued to allow the trial to continue.\nReview of prior literature\nModifying endpoints after launch\nRigorous adherence to study protocol is an acknowl-\nedged cornerstone of trial methodology. In practice,\nhowever, it appears that many trialists modify their\napproach after the study goes into the field. In fact,\none-third of properly registered trials undergo a\nmodification of the primary outcome(s) following\nregistration. That such changes often appear to\nfavor the intervention [15] heightens the fear that\nfailure to adhere to predetermined endpoints can\ninflate type I error rate.\nNonetheless, trialists do recognize that there may\nbe appropriate reasons for modifying endpoints\nargued for some `agility' in study design, especially\nfor long-term trials that may see secular trends in\nstandard of care or relevant endpoints, or that may\nsimply have been underpowered based on a priori\ncalculations. Indeed, over the past decade, several\nlarge trials have changed endpoints after launch.\nTable 3 summarizes changes made in six major trials\nover the past 7 years. Most have done so apparently\nwithout sacrificing integrity, impact, or acceptabil-\nity. The one possible exception is the PROActive\ntrial [16], which drew criticism for relying heavily\non a secondary endpoint that was introduced only a\nfew weeks before the trial was closed [17,18]. In two\nof these trials (FIELD [19] and PEACE [20]), the defi-\nnition of the primary endpoint was expanded to\nincrease the event rate in the face of unexpectedly\nlow power \u00ad similar to the situation in Look AHEAD.\nIn two trials, the primary endpoint was narrowed in\nlight of new data that came to light after launch\nWittes [12] and Evans [24] agree that individuals\nwho are blinded to trial results should be the ones\nwho decide about changing the primary endpoint;\nunblinded individuals might be tempted to modify\nendpoints so as to favor positive results. Evans [24]\nposes a series of questions to trialists who are con-\nsidering a change: (1) What data triggered the\nreview? (2) Have interim results been reviewed? (3)\nWho is making the decision? Ideally, endpoint\nreviews would be triggered by factors other than\nlow event rates (e.g., secular trends in endpoint clas-\nsification) and there would be no review of interim\nresults. In Look AHEAD, internal data (lower-than-\nexpected event rates) triggered the review and the\nDSMB and unblinded Coordinating Center investi-\ngators had reviewed interim results. However, the\ndecision makers were investigators in the EPWG\nand Steering Committee and NIH project scientists,\nall of whom were fully blinded. From Evans' per-\nspective, therefore, these answers seem to put Look\nAHEAD in a `gray zone' with regard to propriety \u00ad\nhence we prepared this article to make our decision-\nmaking process fully transparent [24].\nModifying study duration after launch\nIn studies of CVD, extending the duration of follow-\nup is a logical remedy for decreased power related to\nlower-than-expected event rates. Because CVD is the\nleading cause of death in the general population,\nlonger follow-up will inevitably lead to more events,\nespecially in middle-aged and older populations\nwith underlying CVD risk factors, like type 2 diabe-\ntes and obesity. Less has been written about decision\nmaking leading to a change in study duration.\nLonger duration poses a special challenge in tri-\nals designed to test a behavioral intervention for\ntwo reasons: (1) It may be difficult to maintain the\ncontrast between the intervention group and the\ncomparison group in later years; (2) as the cohort\nages, the accumulating comorbid conditions might\ninterfere with adherence. The decision to increase\nLook AHEAD's duration by 2 years required recon-\nsenting participants for extended duration, but the\nintervention was otherwise unmodified.\nTable 3.

To create a new stand-\nard for CVD endpoints across studies, an interna-\ntional panel of experts representing the American\nHeart Association, the National Heart, Lung, and\nBlood Institute (NHLBI), and the Centers for Disease\nControl, the World Heart Federation, and the\nEuropean Society of Cardiology released a scientific\nstatement on `Case Definitions for Acute Coronary\nHeart Disease in Epidemiology and Clinical Research\nStudies' [11]. The statement identifies a standard\napproach in using `unstable angina pectoris' as part\nof a component definition of coronary heart disease\nalong with nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).\nAccording to this scheme, `unstable angina' is\ndefined as new or changing cardiac symptoms with\npositive ECG findings. The additional Look AHEAD\nprimary endpoint of `hospitalized angina' (see\nFigure 2) is designed to capture episodes of unstable\nangina as part of a composite definition of CVD.\nIndeed, over the past decade, most major cardiovas-\ncular trials have used composite endpoints, typi-\ncally with three or four components [26]. This is\ncertainly true for trials of diabetes treatment [27].\nLessons learned\nThe experience regarding endpoint modification in\nLook AHEAD teaches several lessons for long-term\ntrials.\nFirst, in a long-term trial, it would be prudent to\nprespecify plans for checking event rates during the\ncourse of the trial. The plans should include options\nthat could be triggered if the observed rate is much\nlower than expected. The options might include (a)\nextending duration, (b) expanding the endpoint, or\n(c) stopping the trial for lack of statistical power. In\nLook AHEAD, the Coordinating Center conducted\nregular rate checks under the supervision of the\nDSMB, but there was no prespecified plan to react\nwhen the rates were low.\nSecond, even absent low event rates, it might be\nuseful to prespecify a point at which the endpoint\ndefinition is reexamined in light of secular trends\nand prevailing practice.\nThird, it might be helpful to use the number of\nevents to drive duration, rather than setting dura-\ntion a priori based on estimated event rates. Of\ncourse, this approach requires that the funding\nsource makes a somewhat open-ended commitment\nin terms of duration, which may not be feasible in\nsome circumstances.\nFinally, it is good to be as conservative as feasible\nabout projected event rates.\n"
