Only a few studies\nhave attempted to examine body fat distribution as a\nrisk factor for incidence of hypertension.5,6 In a cohort\nof white women aged 55\u00b169 y, increased self-mea-\nsured waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) increased the risk of\nself-reported hypertension over a 2 y follow-up.5 In\nanother study, incident cases of hypertension had a\nhigher ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thick-\nness (SFR) than persistently normotensive controls\nselected from persons undergoing repeated health\ncheck-ups.6 In both studies, the association of central\nobesity with hypertension risk was independent of\nbody mass index (BMI). Dif\u00aeculties in interpreting\nsuch studies arise from the existence of competing\nschemes for measurement and classi\u00aecation of body\nfat distribution and the likelihood that skinfold ratio\nand WHR may not measure the same aspect of body\nfat distribution. Nevertheless, it is important to use the\nfew available large, longitudinal data sets to better test\nthe hypothesis that measures of body fat distribution\nare predictive of future hypertension risk.\nIn order to replicate these \u00aendings and to examine\nvariation in the association by gender, race and base-\nline body mass, data from a longitudinal follow-up\nstudy of a national sample were analyzed to test the\nhypotheses that persons with a ratio of subscapular to\ntriceps skinfolds (one measure of body fat distribu-\ntion) and subscapular skinfold thickness (one measure\nof absolute truncal fat mass) in the highest quintile,\nwere at increased risk for development of hyperten-\nsion over the follow-up period compared to subjects in\nthe lowest quintile independent of baseline BMI.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThe \u00aerst National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES I) collected data on a nationwide,\nCorrespondence: Richard F. Gillum, M.D., Of\u00aece of Analysis,\nEpidemiology, and Health Promotion, National Center for Health\nStatistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6525\nmultistage, probability sample of the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized population aged 1\u00b174 y of age in the\nUnited States, excluding Alaska, Hawaii and reserva-\ntion lands of American Indians.7\u00b19 Details of the\nsample design, survey procedures and response rates\nhave been published previously, as were the proce-\ndures used to obtain informed consent and to maintain\ncon\u00aedentiality of obtained information.7\u00b19 The aged,\nwomen of childbearing age and persons residing in\npoverty areas were oversampled.\nThe NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up study\n(NHEFS) participants were those participants in\nNHANES I who were aged 25\u00b174 y at the time of\ninterviews, physical and laboratory examinations of\nfor the NHEFS. This analysis was based on the\nincluded the determination of vital status, personal\ninterviews in the home with each participant or a\nproxy, and collection of death certi\u00aecates and hospital\nrecords. At the end of the participant interview in\ncutive blood pressure readings and a weight measure-\nment were attempted by the trained interviewer.\nBlood pressure was measured with the subject\nseated using a sphygmomanometer of the mercury\ntype. An arm cuff of child, adult or large adult size\nwas selected according to American Heart Associa-\ntion criteria.10 If a proper \u00aet could not be obtained,\nblood pressure measurement was not performed. For\ndiastolic pressure the level was recorded at the level of\ncomplete cessation of Korotkoff's sounds or, if there\nwas no cessation, the point of muf\u00afing. Measurements\nwere recorded to the nearest 2 mm on the scale. Blood\npressure was measured in the right arm with the bell\nof the stethoscope used for auscultation. Blood pres-\nsure measurement procedures were adapted from\nthose of the American Heart Association and Hyper-\ntension Detection and Follow-up Program.10 No phy-\nsical measurements were attempted for 303 subjects\nwho were incapacitated or completing an interview by\ntelephone. Blood pressure could not be measured for\nto medical contraindications or other reasons and\nunsuccessful in 80).10 The failure rate was related to\nage, gender and race.10 The completeness of follow-\nup data collection has been reported.11 People who\nbecame institutionalized after the baseline examina-\ntion were included in NHEFS. Age, race and gender-\nspeci\u00aec mortality among the NHEFS cohort has been\nquite similar to that expected for the US population.12\nThe length of follow-up in the NHEFS for this\nwhite and 10.2 y for black survivors.\nThis analysis is limited to 14 235 white and black\nother races excluded). Of these subjects, 992 (7%)\nwere lost to follow-up and deleted from the study. To\nexclude participants with hypertension at baseline,\n3808 subjects were eliminated who had baseline\ndiastolic, or were regular or occasional users of\nmedication for high blood pressure at baseline. Parti-\ncipants who had ever been told by a doctor that they\nhad high blood pressure but who had blood pressure\nwere not users of medication for high blood pressure\nwere considered at risk for development of hyper-\ntension. However, baseline blood pressure was con-\nsidered as a possible confounder in the analysis.\nParticipants were excluded who had no in-person\ninterview, for whom blood pressure was not measured\nat follow-up and who had missing baseline data on\nskinfolds, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse\nrate, BMI, alcohol intake, recreational physical activ-\nity, education, diabetes history, or history of medica-\ntion use for blood pressure. Women pregnant at\nbaseline were deleted. Also excluded were partici-\npants who did not survive until the follow-up\nblack subjects remained for analysis.\nHypertension criteria\nIncident hypertension cases met the following criteria:\n(1) a follow-up blood pressure (\u00aerst reading)\na follow-up history of currently taking medication for\nhigh blood pressure. The date of incidence was\nestimated as the date of follow-up examination in\nments were not available.\nBaseline variables\nDuring the baseline physical examination in a mobile\nexamination center, trained technicians measured\nskinfolds on the right side of the body using a\nLange skinfold caliper. The subscapular skinfold\nwas measured at the inferior angle of the scapula.\nThe triceps skinfold was measured posteriorly at the\nhalfway point between the outer edge of the acromion\nprocess and the olecranon process of the ulna. Tech-\nnicians also measured height and weight.13 The ratio\nof subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness (SFR) was\nused as an indicator of truncal vs peripheral distribu-\ntion of body fat.6 Unfortunately, neither waist nor hip\ngirth were measured in NHANES I. Pulse was taken at\nthe beginning of the examination with the pulse\ncounted for 30 s and multiplied by two to give the\nbeats/min. Next, a physician measured blood pressure\nonce with the examinee seated using a standard\nsphygmomanometer of the mercury type or aneroid\ntype.14 With a few exceptions, a standard mercury\nsphygmomanometer was used. A 13 cm or 9.5 cm cuff\nwas chosen that was at least 20% wider than the\ndiameter of the arm. American Heart Association\nguidelines were followed. A standardized protocol\nwas used for all participants. A history of doctor-\ndiagnosed hypertension, educational attainment (y),\nBody fat distribution and hypertension\nRF Gillum et al\nrecreational physical activity level (much, moderate,\nlittle or no exercise), and alcohol consumption\n(drinks/d) were obtained during the household inter-\nview on all persons.2\u00b14 History of pregnancy and\ncurrent use of oral contraceptives was obtained for\nwomen. Smoking status (cigarettes/d) was obtained at\nbaseline for the subsample that received the detailed\nexamination.7\u00b19 For the remaining persons, smoking\nstatus and number of cigarettes smoked at baseline\nwas derived from questions on the follow-up inter-\nview about lifetime smoking history or imputed.15,16\nThe validity of this approach has been documen-\nted.15,16 Other baseline variables were measured as\ndescribed elsewhere.7\u00b19\nStatistical analysis\nEstimates of the risk of hypertension for persons with\ngreater SFR relative to those with lower SFR derive\nfrom Cox proportional hazards models and the SAS\nprocedure PHREG.17 Gender- and race-speci\u00aec quin-\ntiles of SFR and subscapular skinfold were used in\nthese analyses performed within gender- and race-\ngroups, because of the well-known gender dimorph-\nism in body fat distribution and the race differences in\nbody fat distribution previously reported for\npoints are shown below. Because the number of\ncases limited the power of such analyses in blacks,\nCox regression analyses with SFR entered as a con-\ntinuous variable with and without a SFR6BMI inter-\naction term were also performed. Persons who died\nand hence could not be examined at follow-up were\nexcluded as described above. Survivors were censored\nat the date of the follow-up examination. All models\nincluded age at baseline in single years as a covariate.\nResults are also presented for whites of models which\nincluded baseline BMI, systolic blood pressure, pulse\nrate and change in BMI, as continuous variables and\nsmoking status here categorized as never, former, 1\u00b1\nb 2 drinks/d), diabetes history (yes, no), and recrea-\ntional physical activity (much, moderate and little or\nno exercise) as indicator variables. For example, the\nnumber of cigarettes smoked was controlled for by\nusing four indicator variables to denote \u00aeve exposure\nlevels. Due to the small sample size and computa-\ntional requirements of PHREG, models for blacks\nincluded age, smoking , BMI, pulse rate, systolic\nblood pressure and diabetes history, only. A time-\ndependent covariate and inspection of -log(-log) sur-\nvival curves for parallelism were used to assess\nproportional hazards assumptions.17 To assess the\neffect of the sample weights on the results, regression\nanalyses were done using sample weights and taking\nthe complex survey design into account using the\nSUDAAN procedure.18 The results were consistent\nwith minimal effects of weighting on the main con-\nclusions derived from the unweighted estimates,\nwhich have smaller variances. Therefore only the\ndata from the unweighted Cox regression models are\npresented.\nResults\nTable 1 shows mean values or percents for baseline\nvariables by level of baseline SFR for each gender and\nrace group. Mean systolic blood pressure, age and\nBMI tended to increase with increasing SFR. Table 2\nshows the number of incident cases of hypertension\nby gender, race and age at baseline. Compared to\nnoncases, cases of hypertension detected at follow-up\ntended to have higher SFR, subscapular and triceps\nskinfolds, BMI, age, systolic blood pressure, and a\ngreater frequency of baseline history of diabetes.\nFigure 1 shows higher hypertension incidence rates/\n1000 person-years in subjects in the top two quintiles\nof SFR than in the lowest quintile in white women\nIn white women aged 25\u00b174 y, age- and BMI-\nadjusted relative risk (RR) were signi\u00aecantly\nincreased for women with SFR levels in the \u00aefth\nquintile compared to the \u00aerst quintile: RR  1.52,\n(Table 3).

In white\nmen, the association of subscapular skinfold with\nhypertension incidence did not attain statistical sig-\nni\u00aecance after controlling for age and BMI or all risk\nvariables (Table 4).\nIn black women aged 25\u00b174 y, age- and BMI-\nadjusted hypertension risk tended to be higher with\n(lowest quintile) but the difference did not attain\nstatistical signi\u00aecance (not shown). Age- and BMI-\nadjusted risk tended to be highest in the third and\nfourth quintiles of subscapular skinfold thickness. No\nsigni\u00aecant positive association was seen between SFR\nor subscapular skinfold thickness and hypertension\nincidence controlling for age and BMI, or age, BMI\nand other risk variables in black men overall or within\nage groups.\nApparent interactions of SFR with BMI were\ninvestigated further in women. In both white women\nsigni\u00aecant interaction of SFR and BMI was observed\nin regression models with SFR and BMI entered as\ncontinuous variables with interaction terms. To better\nillustrate this effect, these regression models were\nused to compute the relative risks associated with a\none standard deviation increase in SFR (0.3) for\nwomen with BMI below and above the 50th percen-\ntiles for each group: white women aged 25\u00b144 y with\ning BMI in black women.\nDiscussion\nThis paper reports one of the \u00aerst demonstrations that\ntruncal obesity predicts the subsequent development\nof hypertension even after controlling for baseline\nblood pressure, thus providing evidence for a temporal\nsequence consistent with a causal association.

The age- and BMI-adjusted RR was\neven greater comparing the \u00aefth to the \u00aerst quintile of\nsubscapular skinfold thickness. There was an apparent\ndose-response relationship of SFR with age- and BMI-\nadjusted risk in white women (Table 3). Effect mod-\ni\u00aecation of SFR by BMI level was observed in\nwomen, effects being greatest at low BMI in black\nTable 1 Levels of hypertension risk factors (means or percents) by quintile of subscapular/triceps skinfold ratio (SFR)\nVariable Women Men\nWhite\nBlack\nasubscapular skinfold (mm)/triceps skinfold (mm).\nBody fat distribution and hypertension\nRF Gillum et al\nwomen.

These latter may produce hyperten-\nsion.21\u00b124 Previous reports have demonstrated abdom-\ninal obesity to be an independent risk factor for\ncoronary heart disease and stroke, diseases strongly\nIt is likely that SFR measures a somewhat different\naspect of relative body fat distribution than other\nmeasures such as WHR.24,27 Although likely it is\nnot an optimal measure, its great advantages are\nlong-established standardized methods and wide\navailability in data sets from large population surveys.\nSubscapular skinfolds measure subcutaneous truncal\nfat, a somewhat different aspect of absolute truncal\nbody fat than measures such as waist girth, which\nmeasures subcutaneous and intraabdominal fat, or\nintraabdominal fat on computerized tomographic\nscanning for visceral fat. Unlike the girth or radio-\ngraphic measures, skinfolds do not directly re\u00afect\nvisceral fat. However, reported associations with\nblood pressure have been similar. The \u00aendings of\nthe present study of SFR are consistent with those\nof two previous reports of fat distribution and inci-\ndence of hypertension in women5 or in a multiracial\npopulation of both genders.6 Cross-sectional positive\nassociations of abdominal or truncal obesity and\nhypertension prevalence and blood pressure, indepen-\ndent of overall obesity, have been reported in many\nstudies, mainly among middle-aged or younger white\nination Survey indicated a signi\u00aecant positive associa-\ntion in black women but not black men after\ncontrolling BMI.1 In NHANES I, for subjects aged\n30\u00b159 y, the positive association of subscapular skin-\nfold with blood pressure was not found to vary\nsigni\u00aecantly by race.3 However, no association of\nWHR with hypertension was found in elderly\nLimitations of this study include possible bias\narising from the relatively large number of subjects\nexcluded because of death, loss to follow-up and\nmissing data at follow-up. However, such losses are\ninevitable in any study of hypertension incidence in\nwhich blood pressure measurement is used to establish\nincident case status. Rate of loss to follow-up and\nmissing data in this study compare favorably with\nother published studies.5,6 Among subjects without\nhypertension at baseline and complete baseline data,\n915 died before the follow-up. Since cardiovascular\ndeaths would be expected to be more frequent in\nupper than lower quintiles of SFR,25,26 bias arising\nTable 2 Number of incident cases of hypertension and mean\nlevel of risk factors by age, race and gender in subjects aged 25\u00b1\n74 y at baseline in the analysis cohort\nAge and race Cases Non-cases At risk (n)\nWomen\nMen\narecreational physical activity.\nFigure 1 Incidence of hypertension per 1000 person-years by\nquintile of subscapular/triceps skinfold thickness ratio (SFR) in\nBody fat distribution and hypertension\nRF Gillum et al\nfrom exclusion of these deaths would tend to be\ntowards the null, that is towards showning no effect\nof SFR on hypertension incidence. This could partly\nexplain negative \u00aendings in blacks.\nA further source of possible bias was misclassi\u00aeca-\ntion due to assessment of hypertension at a single visit\nbased on a single reading. Only the \u00aerst follow-up\nreading was used for greater comparability with base-\nline data in which only a subsample had multiple\nreadings.7 However, the choice of de\u00aenite hyperten-\nsion as the endpoint rather than de\u00aenite and borderline\nhypertension might reduce this problem. The criteria\nselected also have the advantage of allowing direct\ncomparison with previous studies which used these\ncriteria with the NHEFS data base.29 In whites, over\n500 subjects reported a history of hypertension at\nfollow-up interview without a matching elevated\nblood pressure or medication history that established\nthe diagnosis.29 It should also be noted that bias due to\ndiffering measurement methods at follow-up com-\npared to baseline (that is, blood pressure measurement\nin the home vs examination center; blood pressure\nmeasured by a physician vs an interviewer) cannot be\nexcluded; however, it seems likely that these systema-\ntic differences would not affect the estimated associa-\ntion of SFR with hypertension incidence.\nIt was not possible to assess changes in SFR over\nfollow-up, however, control for change in BMI may\nhave reduced bias due to such changes. Nevertheless,\nbias from this source cannot be excluded. Nor was it\npossible to validate SFR or skinfold thickness against\nradiographic or ultrasound measures of subcutaneous\nor abdominal fat mass or distribution. The relatively\nlarge number of participants taking antihypertensive\nmedication at follow-up limited the ability of the\nstudy to assess an association of baseline SFR with\nchange in blood pressure between baseline and\nfollow-up. For example, among white male hyperten-\nsives at follow-up, the mean change in systolic blood\npressure was only 3.4 mm Hg in subjects on blood\npressure medication compared to 27.8 mm Hg for\nhypertensives not on medication.29\nIn order to perform survival analysis, the year of\nonset was taken as the year of follow-up examination,\nthis approximation being necessary because of the\nlack of interim examinations. A limitation of this\nestimate was that subjects were likely to develop\nhypertension before it was recorded in the study.\nThis resulted in an increase in the number of\nperson-years, since the subjects were surviving\nTable 3 Relative risks (RR) for hypertension associated with\nquintile of subscapular/triceps skinfold ratio (SFR) in white per-\nAge and baseline Age-BMI adjusted Risk-adjusted *\nWomen\nMen\n*Adjusted for baseline age, smoking, systolic blood pressure,\nbody mass index (BMI), change in BMI, pulse rate, alcohol\nintake, physical activity, history of diabetes and education.\nBMI  body mass index; 95% CL  95% con\u00aedence interval.\nFigure 2 Incidence of hypertension per 1000 person-years by\nquintile of subscapular skinfold thickness in white women and\nBody fat distribution and hypertension\nRF Gillum et al\nlonger before experiencing the hypertension event.\nConsequently, the effect of hypertension was under-\nstated in survival analysis. Since such errors would\nlikely not be related to the SFR, the effect would\nlikely be bias towards the null (no effect of SFR) of\nthe observed association of SFR and hypertension\nincidence. Survival analysis using Cox regression,\nstill had the advantage of taking into account the\nconsiderable variation in intervals between baseline\nand follow-up examinations. Bias due to use of\nsurvival analysis techniques is unlikely since essen-\ntially the same results were obtained in whites using\nlogistic regression analyses, in which date of onset\nand length of follow-up play no role.\nThe analysis of effects of survey design and use of\nsample weights on regression coef\u00aecients, described\nabove, generally supported the validity of using\nunweighted data. Confounding by variables not mea-\nsured cannot be excluded; however most important risk\nfactors were available with the exception of parental\nhistory of hypertension. No convincing evidence for\nnonlinear (quadratic) effects was demonstrated.\nStatistical power was lower for black than for\nwhites because of smaller sample sizes. Because of\nthe small sample of blacks, examination of RR by age\nand SFR quintile had low statistical power and vari-\nables with several categories had to be omitted from\nthe models with SFR entered as a continuous vari-\nable.17 Therefore, the results for blacks must be\ninterpreted with caution and the analyses repeated in\nstudies with larger numbers.\nConclusions\nData from NHEFS con\u00aerm the reported association of\nhigher SFR with a mildly increased incidence of\nhypertension in white women. Reasons that this asso-\nciation was limited to white women are unknown but\nmay include lower statistical power in blacks, gender\nand/or racial differences in the pathophysiology of\nessential hypertension. Several possible mechanisms\nfor such an association in white women have been\nsuggested. More studies of this association are needed,\nespecially in women and blacks. Studies are needed to\nclarify the relationship of subcutaneous truncal fat to\nintraabdominal fat and its relative importance in the\npathogenesis of hypertension and disorders of meta-\nbolism.\n"
