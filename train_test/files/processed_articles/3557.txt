    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn response to the five commentaries on our paper `Comparative approaches to gentrification: lessons from\nthe rural', we open up more `windows' on rural gentrification and its urban counterpart. First, we highlight\nthe issues of metrocentricity and urbanormativity within gentrification studies, highlighting their employ-\nment by our commentators. Second, we consider the issue of displacement and its operation within rural\nspace, as well as gentrification as a coping strategy for neoliberal existence and connections to more-than-\nhuman natures. Finally, we consider questions of scale, highlighting the need to avoid naturalistic concep-\ntions of scale and arguing that attention could be paid to the role of material practices, symbolizations and\nlived experiences in producing scaled geographies of rural and urban gentrification.\n",

Our interlocu-\ntors provide positive commentary, noting we have\nopened a `window into a wider (than English speak-\ning) world' (Bernt, 2018: 2) as well as making crit-\nical points. Here, we respond to these latter\ncomments, through clarifying our original argu-\nments and using the comments to develop some\nfurther arguments, which we have structured around\nthree themes.\nRurality and urbanity\nThe two urban scholars raise questions about the\nsignificance of our paper for studies of urban gen-\ntrification, suggesting that we failed to produce\n`much lessons' for this research (Bernt, 2018: 3),\nand questioning whether conceptualizations of rural\ngentrification `nurture important ongoing debates\nrelated to the expansion of cities and urbanization\nCorresponding author:\nMartin Phillips, Department of Geography, University of\nLeicester, University Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK.\nEmail: mpp2@le.ac.uk\nDialogues in Human Geography\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/dhg\nprocesses' (Lo\nargues that we `play it too safe' and fail to `make use\nof the ammunition collected' to `directly name'\nwhat we view as `false projections and misled con-\nceptualisations'. While rather sceptical that such\nlanguage creates the `fresh atmosphere' that Bernt\ndesires, we begin this response by reiterating that a\nkey argument of our article was that gentrification\nstudies have tended to employ a `metropolitan cen-\ntricity', not only through privileging a narrow range\nof cities in the Global North but also through setting\nup the urban as a privileged viewpoint through\nwhich to interpret the world.\nThomas et al.'s (2011) concept of `urbanorma-\ntivity' is useful in elaborating this argument, as it\nrefers to the practice of taking urban space, or, par-\nticular subsets of it, as constituting the `normal'\nspace of operation of social processes, while alter-\nnative locations are `othered' as spaces of absence\nor abnormality. Such arguments can be applied to\ngentrification studies, where a range of `other geo-\ngraphies of gentrification' (Phillips, 2004) have\nbeen identified. Moreover, we would argue that the\ncommentaries of Bernt, Lo\n\u00b4pez-Morales and Nelson\nprovide enactments of metrocentricity/urbanorma-\ntivity. Bernt, for example, appears to identify New\nAge professionals as an urban phenomenon, an\nargument that neglects the significance of rurality\nin many forms of `new-ageism' (e.g. Chevalier,\n(2018: 4) suggests that rural changes should be con-\nceptualized as `part of the re-configuration of the\nurban', a viewpoint that gives no scope for agency\nto emerge from within rural areas. Nelson also\nseems to view rural gentrification as a process ori-\nginating in the urban, albeit one that has moved\ndown the urban hierarchy into rural locations in\ncountries such as the United Kingdom and United\nStates, a diffusionist claim we explicitly contested\nin our article, both empirically for its neglect of sites\nof rural gentrification dated soon after coinage of\nthe term by Glass (1964) and more theoretically\nthrough the concept of genetic comparisons.\nLo\n\u00b4pez-Morales develops very similar claims to\nBernt and Nelson, drawing explicitly on the notion\nof planetary urbanization that has informed his work\nsuggest that rural/urban divisions may not make\nsense `in a world where everything is essentially\nurban' (Lo\n\u00b4pez-\nMorales and ourselves make reference to the work\nof Brenner and Schmidt, although we do as an illus-\ntration of how the urban is often elevated to a privi-\nleged position. While there is value in their work,\nplanetary urbanization `effectively erase the rural'\nvia constructing spaces that may be identified as\n`rural' as completely entwined with the dynamics\nof urbanization, a perspective which he claims is\nproblematic as `the rural \"Other\" has not been fully\ninternalized by the urban' (see also Roy, 2016).\nWalker adds that recognizing rural otherness\ndoes not imply such spaces are disconnected from\nthe urban, but rather that the presence of relational\nconnections does not reduce localities to urbanity.\nSuch arguments have a long history in rural studies,\nwhere there have not only been repeated calls to\nrecognize encompassing relations with urban spaces\narguments about the need to recognize the specifi-\ncities of rural spaces and places. Here, connections\ncan be made to Hines' (2018) favouring of particu-\nlarist ethnographies, although his desire to identify\nrecurrent stories invokes universalistic or generic\nelements. Reference might also have been made to\ncalls for multisite or global ethnographies (Marcus\nparisons. Comparative strategies, hence, cannot be\nequated to the adoption of particular methodologies.\nLo\npaper exhibited a `lack of sensitiveness regarding\nthe challenging different geographies and analytical\ncategories a properly comparative reflection should\npresent' also raises questions concerning the con-\nduct of comparative research. His assessment seems\nto be based on a privileging of North\u00adSouth com-\nparisons over all other comparisons. We were there-\nfore heartened by Bernt's (2018: 2) assessment that\nour paper `productively demonstrate that a North\u00ad\nSouth binary which has become customary in much\nof the urban studies world is neither necessary, nor\nsufficient for making comparison work as a strat-\negy'. This is not to say that North\u00adSouth compar-\nisons are unimportant, with rural scholars asking\nmany of the same questions that Lo\n\u00b4pez-Morales\nraises concerning the applicability of conceptions\nof space and transformation produced in the Global\nNorth to the Global South (e.g. Korf and Oughton\nneed for a `comparative ruralism' that, like its urban\ncounterpart, extends its focus across the Global\nNorth and South, although would also point to the\nsignificance of other forms of spatial differentiation.\nLo\n\u00b4pez-Morales himself has raised the issue of\nregional differentiation in his discussions of `Latin\nAmerican gentrification' (Lo\n\u00b4pez-Morales et al.,\nThere is research on rural gentrification in each of\nand we ourselves are exploring gentrification in the\ncontext of the Global East (Phillips, 2016; Smith,\n2017). Having said this, we would suggest that there\nis value and challenge in comparisons even within\nthe Global North, not least in relation to the issue of\nlanguage raised by Gkartzios (2013) and discussed\nHalfacree's commentary also provides an illus-\ntration of how arguments over rural specificity may\nbe enacted within gentrification studies, remarking\nthat a simple appropriation of gentrification from\nurban studies might be viewed as a `colonizing'\nattitude towards the rural. As we noted in our article,\nmany studies of rural gentrification include caution-\nary remarks about direct transfer of the concept of\ngentrification from urban to rural contexts. We sus-\npect that many rural scholars refrain from employ-\ning the concept because of its perceived connections\nto urban space.\nHalfacree also argued that rural population\nchange needed to have been mapped before\nresearchers began to engage with the concept of\nrural gentrification. This is an interesting claim, par-\nticularly given Nelson et al.'s (2010) view that there\nis `scant understanding of the extent of rural gentri-\nfication at a more macroscale'. We would, however,\nargue that mapping is itself conditioned concep-\ntually, and, hence, by the associated circulatory\nsociologies of translation. We would also point to\nreferences to rural gentrification prior to the study of\nFitchen, 1991) as well as the `feet on the ground'\nrecognition of `class-based \"up-scaling\"' made\nwithout reference to gentrification outlined by Half-\nacree (2018: 2). For us, it is important to not only\nrecognize the presence of rural gentrification where\nthe term is not employed but also consider reasons\nas to why the term was not employed.\nRural gentrification and questions of\ndisplacement\nHalfacree provides arguments as to why the term\nmight have been resisted by rural researchers, sug-\ngesting that reservations might stem from uncertain-\nties relating to the presence of displacement as well\nas the concept's perceived connections to urban\nspace discussed above, and the postmodern and cul-\ntural turns discussed in our paper. Specifically,\nHalfacree argues that working class displacement\npreceded the arrival of middle class residents, and\nhence these were not causally related as implied in\ngentrification. These are important issues to con-\nsider and Halfacree may well be right to signal these\nas possible barriers to the incorporation of gentrifi-\ncation into rural studies.\nDisplacement has, indeed, been a facet of gentri-\nfication that has been rather neglected within rural\nstudies, despite claims as to its critical significance\nto the overall concept of gentrification (Slater, 2006,\n2008). Having said this, it is important to note that\nthe points Halfacree makes could be seen to have\nrelevance to both urban and rural space and, hence,\narguably do little to explain differences between\nurban and rural scholars. Many accounts of urban\ngentrification, for instance, have pointed to the\nabandonment of areas prior to gentrification, with\nMarcuse (1985) providing an insightful discussion\nof the extent of abandonment in New York and its\nrelationship to gentrification and displacement. In\nneed to situate discussions of demographic change\nwithin a wider framing of `ongoing renewal of class\npolarisation within society as a whole', Marcuse\npresents abandonment and gentrification as distinct\nmanifestations of class restructuring, whereby there\nwas a decline in working class employment oppor-\ntunities and associated effective demand for hous-\ning, which led to property abandonment in some\nPhillips and Smith 53\nneighbourhoods, alongside growth of professional\nservice employment that led to demands for office\ndevelopment and gentrified properties. While Half-\nacree points to the presence of a different, and in\nmany instances, earlier phase of restructuring linked\nto reductions in agricultural work, Marcuse high-\nlights how gentrification may occur alongside aban-\ndonment and, indeed, may involve replacement in\nareas that have been abandoned. As discussed in\nPhillips (2005), abandonment can be seen as one\nway that spaces are `made ready for gentrification',\nnot least because it indicates the devalorization of\nproperties that can constitute the emergence of a\nrent gap that comes to be closed through\ngentrification.\nMarcuse also discusses how displacement may\noccur in a range of forms. We feel this discussion\nmight be of value to rural studies, pointing to how\ndisplacement may operate both over time and in far\nfrom direct ways. Marcuse, for instance, notes how\nresidents can be displaced quite immediately and\ndirectly, through combinations of physical force,\nmaterial neglect and economic pricing \u00ad or what\nhe identifies as `direct last-resident displacement'\nhousing (e.g. Newby, 1977; Bowler and Lewis,\n1987) as well as the outbidding of `local people'\nin housing markets (e.g. Shucksmith, 1991; Liu and\nRoberts, 2013) might be viewed as illustrative of the\npresence of this form of displacement. Marcuse\nadds, however, that displacement can occur across\na series of residents, with several residents leaving\nprior to the departure of the final non-gentrifier resi-\ndent. Such a concept has not, to our knowledge,\nbeen applied to rural gentrification but would seem\nto be of potential relevance. Cloke et al. (1995), for\ninstance, make reference to people accessing rural\nareas through `marginalised channels of entry'\nincluding staying with family and friends (see also\nCloke et al., 2000), and many of these `rural resi-\ndents' appear likely to move away from these places\nof residence and hence could be viewed as dis-\nplaced. There is also clear evidence that some off-\nspring of contemporary rural residents are unable to\naccess housing in these localities and move away in\nsearch of affordable homes. Hence, while in many\nvillages, there may currently be a continuing\n`working-class' presence, this may not continue into\nthe future. This connects to a third form of displace-\n`exclusionary displacement', focused on how the\ngentrification of properties prevents replacement\nof non-gentrifier households by other non-\ngentrifier households. There may even in some\ninstances not be any direct displacement, but there\nis exclusion of certain forms of in-migration, a\ndescription that might be applicable not only to the\n`re-filled emptied' rural space of Halfacree's com-\nmentary but also to the brownfield sites of urban\nnew-build gentrification, where authors such as\nemployed Marcuse's notion of exclusionary gentri-\nfication as well as his fourth form of displacement,\n`displacement pressure'. This relates to the chang-\ning character of places and how this can result in a\nlocation becoming `less and less liveable' (Marcuse,\ndeclining liveability may be quite material in form,\nsuch as, for instance, when the loss of bus services\nprevents rural residents accessing work, retail or\nwelfare services. It also takes more experiential and\naffective dimensions, whereby people come to feel\nthat they do not belong to a place.\nWe feel that a series of `new windows' between\nurban and rural studies could be opened-up through\nthese notions of displacement. The notion of `dis-\nplacement pressure' quite directly connects to the\nethnographic perspective outlined by Hines (2018),\nwhich, in turn, exhibits parallels to Halfacree's\n(2018: 4) call for gentrification to be viewed as a\n`coping strategy' to deal with contemporary `neo-\nliberal existence', albeit conjoined with recognition\nof their impacts on other people, a call that has\nstrong resonances with the work of Schlichtman\net al. (2017). The concept of displacement pressure\nalso highlights how displacement does not necessa-\nrily involve movement of people, an argument that\ncould be considered in relation to the literature on\nboth `new-build' and `green'/`ecological'/`low-car-\nbon' gentrification. The latter forms of gentrifica-\ntion are mentioned by Bernt in relation to\nelaborating an argument about a blurring of rural\nand urban spatial distinctions, although his argu-\nment in our view reduces rurality to a space of\nnature. While we have both argued that notions of\nnature and the natural may be important constituents\nof symbolizations and senses of rurality (Phillips\nand rurality are complexly and variously con-\nstructed and apprehended (Phillips, 2014). Just as\nwe have argued that attention could usefully be\npaid to the significance of different rural land-\nscapes in processes of gentrification (Phillips and\nwould argue that the presence and differences in\n`more-than-human' natures or environments need\nto be recognized. The restored natures of formerly\npolluted `brownfield' sites exhibit differences, as\nwell as similarities, with the natures of public\nparks, intensive agriculture and wilderness, and\nthese are probably poorly served by dualistic con-\nstructions of rurality and urbanity. Furthermore, as\ndisplacement are extended to include the more-\nthan-human, even new-build developments of land\nnot previously used for residential use could be\nviewed as creating displacement, of both direct and\nin-direct kinds, in that spaces are rarely uninhab-\nited by `plants, animals and other forms of biodi-\nversity'. Such spaces of nature, as well as the\nenvironments of buildings, are often the focus of\nexperiential and affective attachments and hence\ncan be the foci of `displacement pressure' linked\nto the transformation of place, or as Davidson\ndegger and Lefebvre, the `transformation of lived\nScaled geographies of gentrification\nNelson (2018: 2) argues that a `sensitivity to scale\ncan expand our understandings of gentrification'.\nScale is, however, a highly contested concept, with\ncalls to both do away with the concept (Marston\ncisms are made about scale being `naturalized' as a\nconceptual pregiven. We were, therefore, surprised\nthat Nelson's commentary contained little reflection\non the meaning and construction of scale, as well as\nbeing uncertain about some claims made about the\nemployment of scale within gentrification studies.\nFor instance, there seems to be a suggestion that\nanalysis at the interurban scale of `a system of cities'\nphrase only to the latter study. We would also ques-\ntion Nelson's illustration of how scale can inform\nunderstandings of the `geography of the concept of\nrural gentrification', which implies that the presence\nof studies of gentrification within London acted to\nproduce `heightened awareness' of gentrification in\nthe surrounding urban and rural areas, while in the\nUnited States scholars preferred to make use of con-\ncepts such as `\"counterurbanization\" or \"amenity\nhave conceptions of counterurbanization been more\nwidely adopted in the United Kingdom than rural\ngentrification (Phillips, 2010a), but early references\nto rural gentrification emerged in areas of the United\nKingdom quite distant to London, such as Devon\nand Warwickshire (Cloke, 1979), Nottinghamshire\nLikewise, the claim that studies of rural gentrifica-\ntion in the United States had to travel greater dis-\ntances from their urban centres might be questioned\nboth through reference to the work of Fitchen (1991)\nin New York state and Frieberger (1996) in Texas,\nand by asking why the concept of gentrification\nseemingly travelled so strongly to spaces remote\nfrom urban centres without being applied to spaces\nmore proximate to urban areas. More generally, we\nwould caution against too direct a reading of the\ngeography of rural gentrification from the geogra-\nphy of rural gentrification scholarship.\nThere also seemed in Nelson's commentary to be\na sense that scale is constitutive of different senses\nof rurality. This is a further interesting new `win-\ndow' through which researchers might usefully\npeer. Having said this, we are mindful of Brenner's\n(2001) comments about the unreflective conflation\nof conceptions of scale with concepts such as space\nand place, and would argue that scale is not strongly\nconstitutive of all senses of rurality, and that in con-\nsidering its significance, attention needs to be paid\nas to how scale is being viewed.\nNelson's discussion of scale is, we would sug-\ngest, very Cartesian in tone, making repeated\nPhillips and Smith 55\nreferences to measures of travel times and distances,\nas well as settlement size. Such a sense of scale is\nconsistent with what Lefebvre (1991) has described\nargues can be viewed as a representation of space in\nwhich material spatial practices and lived spaces of\nrepresentation `recede in importance'. Much of the\ncritique of naturalized conceptions of scale has\nfocused on detailing the material practices and rela-\ntions through which scales come to be socially con-\nstructed, and it may be that Nelson's discussion of\nproduction-side and demand-side interpretations of\ngentrification could connect to such perspectives.\nPersonally, we find the differentiation of interpreta-\ntions into such sides overly dualistic and also do not\nconsider that particular forms of comparison are tied\nto particular scales of analysis as Nelson seems to\nimply. There are, however, scalar dimensions to the\nremarks made in our paper about metrics within com-\nparative studies that we should have highlighted:\nmany instances of gentrification may go unrecog-\nnized because indicative material is obscured within\ndata sets constructed at a greater spatial scale than\ngentrification is being realized at within a locality.\nWe would also argue that in any scaling of gen-\ntrification studies, attention needs to be paid to the\npresence of a range of scalar representations, includ-\ning ones that that take less abstracted forms, and also\nto lived experiences of scale. We have recently\nmade use of indices of low-population density and\nlow-connectivity to urban centres of employment to\nidentify areas of wilderness gentrification (Smith\net al., 2018), stressing that while these indices con-\nnect to popular representations of wilderness as\nplaces devoid both of the presence of and connec-\ntions to centres of large scale human settlement,\nthese locations are symbolized in a range of ways\nand people can find wilderness experiences in areas\nrelatively proximate in abstract space. Howitt's\n(2002) argument that consideration of scale needs\nto connect to studies of lived experiences would\nseem to be of clear significance here, with a further\nwindow of opportunity being to inject scale into\ndiscussions of lived space and representations of\nspace that have emerged in gentrification studies\nConcluding comments\nWe have sought to open up more windows on rural\ngentrification to bring, to borrow Bernt's phraseol-\nogy, some `fresh air' into this subject of study, and\nits urban counterpart. Our first window highlighted\nissues of metrocentricity and urbanormativity\nwithin gentrification studies, as well as discussing\nthe spatial framings of comparative study and argu-\ning for the development of a comparative ruralism.\nThrough the second window, we examined displa-\ncement and its operation within rural space as well\nas considered gentrification as a coping strategy for\nneoliberal existence and gentrification and more-\nthan-human natures. The final window related to\nquestions of scale, highlighting debates about the\nsignificance and meaning of the concept of scale,\nas well as considering the role of scale in the forma-\ntion of rurality and gentrification.
