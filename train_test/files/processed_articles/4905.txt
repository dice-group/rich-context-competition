A major challenge is how to facilitate this under-\nstanding.Atypical strategy is to collect data and then provide\nsome kind of interpretation as to its meaning and significance\nfor the client organization. Every change agent knows that\nwhile it is easy to interpret data, it is much more difficult to\nget the client to own the interpretation and to act on it. This\nis due, in part, because the author of the data (system agents)\nand the reader (the change agent) live in different worlds and\ncome to different conclusions about the underlying meaning\nof a set of data.\nA Better Way\nThis is where PathMAP\u00ae comes into play. PathMAP\u00ae is an\ninterpretation strategy by which the authors of the data and\nthe reader of the data share a common language about what\nthe data mean because they are both members of the same\nsystem for a brief time. PathMAP\u00ae is a process for engaging\nagents within a system in the process of data interpretation.\nWhat follows is a case study describing how this was done.\nThe purposes of the case study are to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Introduce readers to PathMAP\u00ae.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Show how it can be used to engage diverse groups in\ninterpreting survey data.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Demonstrate that the results of a PathMAP\u00ae are an\nincreased understanding of the variables that influ-\nence system dynamics, an increased appreciation of\nhow they interact, and an increased understanding of\nhow to change the system.\nPathMAP\u00ae enables the change agent to get an accurate\npicture of the current state of an organization, as seen by sys-\ntem agents, by identifying the key issues facing the organiza-\ntion, understanding their interrelationship, and using this\nknowledge to create meaningful action plans, plans that make\ndeep and intuitive sense to the organization's members. The\nsystem influence mapping process of PathMAP\u00ae is\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Fast--It enables you to rapidly identify and address\nthe actual root cause of an issue and create a sustain-\nable action plan in less time than traditional methods.\n1Somerset Consulting Group, Austin, TX, USA\n2University of Texas at Austin, USA\n3Texas State University, San Marcos, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNorvell Northcutt, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station\nEmail: n.northcutt@mail.utexas.edu\nEngaging Employees in Interpreting\nSurvey Results: Using PathMAP\u00ae as a Tool\nto Drive Understanding and Change\nKeith Owen1, Norvell Northcutt2, and A.

Following a\nseries of financial setbacks, there was a mandate for creating\na more effective transparent, employee-oriented organiza-\ntional culture. This mandate led to large-scale changes in the\norganization and its leadership. A number of initiatives were\nundertaken to transform the organization including one to\nrealign the organization around a new set of values. Senior\nleadership team felt it was appropriate to survey the organi-\nzation to find out what employees felt and to gather their\nopinions on how things were working.\nTo accomplish this, a census survey was undertaken to\nbenchmark the current organization and identify indicators\nto track goal-oriented progress. To design the employee sur-\nvey, a series of employee interviews were conducted, the\nanalysis of which enabled the research team to identify a\nnumber of variables for assessment, including confidence in\nsenior leadership, degree of transparency, valuing employ-\nees, empowerment and participation, relationship with\nsupervisor, teamwork, and measures of satisfaction and com-\nmitment. Items to assess each of these variables were devel-\noped and the resulting survey was then administered to\nemployees via the Internet. Two weeks after data were col-\nlected, a preliminary report was provided to senior manage-\nment and following this presentation, interactive feedback\nsessions were commenced.\nFindings of the Survey\nQuantitative analysis of the survey data revealed a number of\ninteresting yet contradictory findings. First, employees indi-\ncated they were highly committed to the organization, were\nproud to be a part of it, and wanted to remain employees for\nthe foreseeable future. However, survey results also indi-\ncated a number of potentially threatening issues held by\nemployees:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 There was little confidence in senior management.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 There was little trust for those in leadership roles.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It was perceived the organization did not genuinely\ncare for or value its employees.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 There was very little openness.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 HR systems were rated unfavorably, especially related\nto pay and compensation, performance management,\nand due process.\nWhile employees reported they were highly committed to\nthe organization, they also felt as if they were not valued by\nthe organization. In short, employees felt victimized and\nunderappreciated. Because the data were so unfavorable in\nmost respects, the research team used PathMAP\u00ae as a means\nof engaging employees in a nonthreatening, open environ-\nment for the purpose of interpreting the data. To better under-\nstand why PathMAP\u00ae was used as it serves as a great tool\nfor clarifying the underlying causes of these issues. Following\nis a brief discussion of the theories underlying PathMAP\u00ae.\nOrganizations as Phenomenological\nSystems\nPathMAP\u00ae is a systems approach to a kind of qualitative\nresearch called \"grounded theory\" which has three major\ncharacteristics:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It is a phenomenological approach, meaning that it\nrepresents a phenomenon from the perspective of\nthose experiencing the phenomenon (the emic view-\npoint), rather than from some external or imposed per-\nspective (the etic viewpoint). In this particular case,\nthe employees of the organization were asked to\nbecome active participants in the interpretation of\ntheir own survey data, in contrast to the more tradi-\ntional approach of the external observer or researcher\nwho conducted the survey determining the meaning\nof the data.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 PathMAP\u00ae representation is based on systems theory,\nwhich means that phenomena as perceived by a par-\nticular constituency are represented as systems. These\nphenomenological systems, like all systems, have two\ncomponents:\n|\n|\nElements: a group of closely related constructs\nthat can be given a single name.\n|\n|\nRelationships Among Elements: the perceived pat-\nterns of influence or causation.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Consequently, the phenomenon can be represented as\na system map that shows how the various elements of\nthe system are connected, in the minds of a constitu-\nency, in a pattern of influence. This representation\ncreates a number of different interpretive possibilities,\nthe most important of which are as follows:\n|\n|\nAn understanding of the relative \"importance\" of\nthe system elements, depending on their place-\nment within the system map and how they are\ninterconnected to other elements.\n|\n|\nAn opportunity to ask \"what if\" questions that can\nlead directly to implications and suggestions for\nimprovement. These questions are of four kinds:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Prospective: We can describe the existing states of the\ndrivers of the system (elements that determine the\nOwen et al. 3\nstates of all or most of the other elements of the sys-\ntem) and determine the likely effects on the outcomes\n(elements whose states are largely determined by\nother elements within the system).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Retrospective: We can describe a hypothetical desir-\nable set of outcomes and \"work backwards\" through\nthe system map to determine what set of precondi-\ntions the system must obtain to reach the desirable\nstate.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Internal dynamics: We can examine the internal\ndynamics of the system, typically in terms of the\neffects of feedback loops (recursive cycles of influ-\nence among a set of elements in which a change in the\nstate of one element creates a cycle, usually self-rein-\nforcing), to better understand, for example, how\nchanges in one element may \"rebound\" throughout\nthe entire system in often surprising ways.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 External dynamics: We can examine the effects of\nhypothetical elements external to the system; for\nexample, \"At what juncture in the system or what\nwould be the resulting internal dynamics if a class-\naction lawsuit were filed by the customers of the\norganization?\"\nFurthermore, PathMAP\u00ae is a process by which a constit-\nuency (a group of people who are similar in distance from\nand power over a situation and therefore may be presumed to\nhave a relatively homogeneous understanding of the situa-\ntion) defines their own collective understanding of a phe-\nnomenon as a system consisting of clusters of meaning and\nrelationships among those clusters.\nFour major theoretical streams of thought inform the\nPathMAP\u00ae research process (Northcutt & McCoy, 2004):\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Grounded Theory. The purpose of grounded theory\n(Glaser & Strauss, 1967) is essentially the classical\nempirical task of inferring patterns or regularities (a\ntheory) from a mass of observations. The theory thus\ninduced is not a grand metanarrative that makes\nclaims about how humans make meaning regardless\nof context, but is more modest in its goals in that it is\nfairly highly constrained by the contextual limits of\nthe observations themselves.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Phenomenology. Phenomenology is usually attributed\nnificant intellectual provenance going back to\nthe structure of the mind (consciousness) determined\nto a significant degree the nature of reality itself.\nHusserl, following Kant's lead, advocated that the\nproper focus of philosophy ought to be phenomeno-\nlogical in the Kantian sense, which led to a major\nmovement in psychology that emphasizes the subjec-\ntive experience, rather than the experience as inter-\npreted or understood by an external observer.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Systems Theory. The \"father\" of systems theory is\ngenerally recognized to be Karl Ludwig von\nBertalanffy (1969). PathMAP\u00ae, while not subscrib-\ning to many of the implications of von Bertalanffy's\ntheorizing about biological systems, is certainly one\nexample of many applications of his ideas to social\nsystems in that PathMAP\u00ae represents social phenom-\nena as systems consisting of elements and relation-\nships among these elements; furthermore, these\nrelationships are neither random nor willy-nilly, but\nare systemic, meaning that they follow a consistent\ninternal logic or structure.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Hermeneutics. The classical hermeneutical model that\nwas refined into its highest form by the Scholastics of\nthe high Middle Ages provides the intellectual foun-\ndation for the entire PathMAP\u00ae research process\n(Dietz, 2010). The tripartite hermeneutical model of\nauthor\u00adtext\u00adreader is used as a metaphor and a guide\nfor the research process itself.\nPathMAP\u00ae and Hermeneutics\nWhile the concepts implied by systems theory and phenom-\nenology are widely familiar, the appearance of \"hermeneu-\ntics,\" traditionally reserved for religious texts, may be a\nsurprise. We use the term in its wider sense of interpreting\nany text at all, whether the \"text\" be a book, an interview, or\na set of observations. In other words, all human activity that\ninvolves symbolic exchange is grist for the hermeneutic mill.\nHowdoesthishermeneuticalprocessapplytoPathMAP\u00ae?\nTaking the word text literally, the hermeneutical model,\nwhich is a three element system consisting of the text, the\nauthor, and the reader, raises the following issues or\nquestions.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What is the intent of the author; or alternatively, is the\nintent of the author even a legitimate concern?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Does the text \"speak for itself\"?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What, if anything, does the reader bring to the herme-\nneutical task? Is the reader simply a mechanical\n\"recorder\" of the text, in which case all readers would\nbe expected to derive the same meaning from the\nsame text? Or is the meaning of the text entirely\ndependent on the reader's subjective reaction to it?\nFurthermore, as the reader has no immediate access to\nthe writer's consciousness or intent, what part does\nauthorial intent play in the model?\nThese questions have been debated for decades and no\ndoubt will continue to be points of contention. Different\n\"schools\" of literary criticism and of social \"science\" inquiry\nclearly tend to privilege one apex of the hermeneutical tri-\nangle over another (Figure 1). This article is not the place for\na detailed examination of how different disciplines of social\ninquiry privilege either the author, the text, or the reader, but\n4 SAGE Open\nit is important to understand how PathMAP\u00ae uses the her-\nmeneutical model as a metaphor, and how PathMAP\u00ae rec-\nognizes that each of the three apexes should be emphasized\nor privileged, depending on the stage of development of the\nresearch study.\nFirst, the \"author\" is not the researcher; rather, the author\nis the person or group that the researcher is \"studying\"; that\nis, the researcher's job is to understand the meaning of a phe-\nnomenon in the terms of the \"subjects\" of the study. As the\nresearcher has no direct access to the consciousness of the\nsubjects, she or he must depend on some kind of \"text,\"\nwhether the text comprises interviews, focus groups, sur-\nveys, or any of the variety of ways that social researchers\n\"gather data.\"\nThe researcher is the hermeneutical reader; the \"subjects\nof the study\" are the authors, and the text is whatever means\nthe researcher uses to make inferences about the meaning of\nthe phenomenon to the subjects. Once understood in this\nway, a conclusion seems to emerge quickly: It is not a matter\nof choosing which of the three apexes to privilege; rather, an\neffective research methodology must privilege the appropri-\nate element at the appropriate stage of the research project\nin such a way as to achieve some kind of balance. PathMAP\u00ae\nachieves this balance in the following way:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research Design. The earliest phase of research, that\nof deciding just what will be the subject of inquiry,\nmust of necessity privilege the \"reader\" (the\nresearcher). It is the researcher who decides to con-\nduct the project and process being used in the first\nplace.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Data \"Collection\" or Observation. This phase, if the\npurpose of the study is to represent the emic dimen-\nsion of a phenomenon, must of necessity privilege the\nauthor (the subjects).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Analysis or Data Aggregation. This stage should priv-\nilege the \"text\" (the data). This objective accom-\nplished by making a clear distinction between analysis\nand interpretation, a distinction that is made clear by\nensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, analysis\nis deductive and rule- or algorithm-driven.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Interpretation privileges first the reader--after all, it is\nthe obligation of the researcher to tell an audience\nwhat she or he thinks the study means--and then the\n\"author,\" in that the subjects can and should be brought\nback into the study to help create and interpret what\ntheir own mind map means--a participatory praxis.\nPathMAP\u00ae is structured to recursively privilege each of\nthe three apexes of the hermeneutical triangle in a systematic\nway under the assumption that doing so will provide the\nmost credible and robust description and interpretation of the\nphenomenon. Indeed, the application of PathMAP\u00ae method-\nology to the organization is an example of how robust the\nmethodology is.\nOverview of the PathMAP\u00ae Process\nFigure 2 shows the structure of a typical PathMAP\u00ae study. A\nshort discussion of the steps in this diagram is given, fol-\nlowed by a description of how the process was adapted for\nthe present study.\nPathMAP\u00ae studies begin with a focus group in which the\ngroup brainstorms their reactions to an issue statement or\nsome general stimulus (in the case of the organization, this\nwas the results of the employee survey). The results of the\nbrainstorming session are invariably a large number of\nthoughts. Members of the group, with the researchers acting\nas neutral facilitators, engage in three kinds of \"coding\" or\nsynthesis/analysis of the data represented by the cards:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Open\" coding which results in a categorization of the\nauthor's thoughts. The major point here is that the\nauthors are creating their own categories, rather than a\nset of categories being imposed by a third party.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Axial\" coding (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), the purpose\nof which is to clarify and to define the range of mean-\ning for each of the elements.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Theoretical\" coding, after all affinities are identified,\nthe facilitator queries the author group about their per-\nception of the influences among all affinities. This is\nworthy of note because (a) this level of coding is typi-\ncally missing from many qualitative studies, (b) theo-\nretical codes are the source material for transforming\na simple laundry list of affinities into a true system,\nand (c) once again, the judgments of relationships are\nmade by the authors, not the reader.\nIn a more robust PathMAP\u00ae study, the list of system ele-\nments provides the structure for an interview protocol in\nwhich individual members of the constituency are inter-\nviewed to provide more in-depth understanding of the phe-\nnomenon (represented in the right-hand track of Figure 2).\nThe present study used only the focus group track. After the\nfocus group has completed the element production and an\nFigure 1. The hermeneutical arc and PathMAP\u00ae.\nOwen et al. 5\nanalysis of relationships among all possible pairwise ele-\nments, PathMAP\u00ae provides a formal set of protocols or\nalgorithms that are used to analyze the system relationships.\nThese protocols are strictly deductive and the implication is\nthat once a set of theoretical codes has been produced, differ-\nent researchers will produce the same system. By separating\nanalysis from interpretation, IQA eliminates a common\nsource of confusion in qualitative studies. The final product\nof a PathMAP\u00ae study is a system map. The map represents\nthe elements and their relationships as a coherent system,\nstarting with drivers and ending with outcomes from which\nconclusions and implications are drawn.\nUsing the PathMAP\u00ae Approach\nFeedback sessions were designed such that the participants\nin each group were relatively homogeneous with respect to\nstatus.\nProcess\nData presentation. The data presented below reflect the out-\nput from eight PathMAP\u00ae group sessions. Each group had\n12 to 15 participants and each session was run according to a\nprearranged script. First, the facilitator welcomed partici-\npants and discussed the aims and ground rules for the ses-\nsion. The rules included, confidentiality of the discussion, no\ntalking during brainstorming and clustering, and freedom to\nmove the cards at will. These rules were strictly reinforced\nduring the feedback sessions. Second, a summary of the\ngroup and the overall survey data were presented. This pre-\nsentation highlighted the 10 most and least favorably rated\nitems for the location as well as the scores for each factor\nmeasured by the survey. If a given location had any score\nthat was significantly higher or lower than the overall score\nfor that factor and/or item, these scores were highlighted and\ndiscussed. This was done to show that some of the results\nwere specific to a given location and some were more sys-\ntemic in nature.\nIssue identification.After answering any questions about the\ndata, participants were asked to silently think about the fol-\nlowing question: \"What are the issues that produced the sur-\nvey results we have just presented?\" The group then engaged\nin a silent brainstorming process during which they wrote\ntheir thoughts and feelings on post-it note cards, one thought/\nFigure 2. PathMAP\u00ae research system.\nNote. SID = Systems Influence Diagram\n6 SAGE Open\nfeeling per card. These cards were collected and posted by\nthe facilitator on a large white board. Each group generated\nan average of 15 cards per participant. For this study, these\ncards provided the narrative for understanding the meaning\nand effectiveness of each element.\nClustering and naming.Following the brainstorm, partici-\npants silently clustered the issue cards into affinities, groups\nof cards believed to have the same underlying meaning. Par-\nticipants could move cards about ad libitum until there was\nagreement regarding the particular group into which a given\ncard was placed. Once all the cards were clustered, each\ncluster was discussed. This discussion was led by a volunteer\nfrom the group. The result of this discussion provided each\ngroup of cards (an element) with a unique label. The label\ncaptured the underlying meaning of each element.\nEstablishing the relationships among elements.After the nam-\ning was done (Table 1) the facilitator led the group in a pair-\nwise assessment of the relationship among the elements\nduring which participants had to decide which element\ncaused the other.\nValencing. After the naming exercise, participants were asked\nto evaluate the quality of each element of the system as posi-\ntive, neutral, or negative.\nAnalysis of Data\nStep 1: Construction of the interrelationship table (IRT).To\nfacilitate construction of the system map, the judgments of\nthe relationships among system elements are summarized in\nan Interrelationship Table (IRT) as shown in Table 2. This\ntable has been sorted horizontally in descending order from\ndrivers to outcomes. Each of the elements is listed in column\n1, its relative rank is shown in column 2, and the column\nlabeled  reflects the difference between the number of \"in\"\narrows subtracted from the number of \"out\" arrows (no. of\nouts - no. of ins = ). The element with the greatest number\nof \"outs\" is called the primary driver, the one with the next\nmost a secondary driver, and so on. The box with the greatest\nnumber of \"ins\" is called the primary outcome and the box\nwith the next most number of ins is called a secondary out-\ncome, and so on. A given element can be a driver, an out-\ncome, or both. Drivers and outcomes can further be\ndeconstructed into primary, secondary, tertiary, and so on\ndepending on their relative position in the chain of\ninfluence.\nStep 2: Construction of the system map.The data from the\nIRT were used to construct the system map as shown in\nUsing the rules of simplification, the pattern of relation-\nships is reduced in complexity so that it is more easily inter-\npreted. This process produces a system map that is\n1. entirely consistent with the data; that is, there is no\nlink in the IRT that is not represented, either directly\nor indirectly, in the system map likewise, there is no\nlink in the system map that is not in the IRT.\n2. the simplest possible representation of the IRT con-\nsistent with Criterion Number 1; that is, it meets the\nrequirement for parsimony.\nIn short, this simplification process is entirely consistent\nwith the two basic criteria of any good theory.\nStep 3: Interpretation of the system map. There are three main\noutputs from a PathMAP\u00ae:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The elements identified by participants,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The underlying name of constructs which explain the\nmeanings of the element to participants, and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The interrelationships among the elements, that is, the\nsystem map.\nTable 1. Elements of the Organizational System as Perceived by\nConstituents.\nIssue Meaning\n1. Pay and raises This element referred to the process\nby which pay and raises were given to\nemployees.\n2.HR This element referred to typical HR\nsystems, for example, performance\nmanagement, pay and compensation,\nand career development processes,\nand the degree to which they were\nbelieved to be effective.\n3. Board management This cluster all related to the\nrelationship between the Board of\nDirectors and the senior leadership\nteam.\n4. Leadership skills This cluster referred to level of ability\nof those in leadership roles to lead.\n5.Climate This cluster referred to the level of\ntrust and respect characteristic of the\norganization.\n6. Confidence in leaders This element referred to the perceived\nlevel of leadership competence.\n7. Leadership integrity This cluster referred to the consistency\nand style with which leaders/\nsupervisors carried out their job\nduties.\n8. Career development This element referred to the availability\nof learning and growth opportunities\nfor employees.\n9.Communications The communications element\ncaptured to quantity and quality of\ncommunications in the organization.\nprocedures\nThis element captured to existence\nand effectiveness of policies and\nprocedures.\n11.Congruence The element captured to degree to\nwhich values and behaviors were\nbelieved to be aligned.\nNote. The numbering of affinities is strictly nominal. No ranking is implied. The\nimportance of affinities will be discussed in the context of the system as a whole.\nOwen et al. 7\nThe system map reflects the shared understandings and\nmeanings attached to the observations and experiences of\nemployees working for the organization. People in this orga-\nnization understood this influence map to be the \"truth\"\nabout the reality of the current organizational culture. In\nother words, the data correspond to the facts as experienced\nby the participants, thus they were empirically true. Second,\nthe data were in agreement with the \"rules of conduct\" as\nagreed on by the participants, that is, they were coherent with\nthe values espoused by the participants. Finally, the data\nwere true from a pragmatic perspective in that the partici-\npants were in almost 100% agreement the data portrayed the\ninner dynamics of the organization.\nWhat this means is that the system map reflects the cate-\ngories and linkages that belong to the individuals who cre-\nated them. Likewise, all the relationships perceived by the\nconstituents are included in the structure of the system map.\nIn other words, the system map contains nothing that is not\nthe data. The system map thus represents a coherent theory\nfrom which hypotheses can be derived and tested. With this\nin mind, let's consider the meanings inherent in the system\nmap and their relationship to existing theories and data\nrelated to organizational effectiveness.\nThe final system map shown in Figure 3 reflects the rela-\ntionships among the issues identified by employees. The\nboxes are the elements of the system, and the meaning attrib-\nuted to each (i.e., the element's name) is derived from the\ncards generated by participants. The arrows show the direc-\ntion of the influence, from cause to effect. The amber color\nreflects the fact that each element was evaluated as having a\nnegative valence. The names of the affinities have been\nchanged to reflect this evaluation. The system map is inter-\npreted from left to right.\nIn the broadest sense, this system map tells us that\nemployees of the organization believe a vicious cycle of inef-\nfective leadership (Vicious Cycle 1) causes a cycle of distrust\n(Vicious Cycle 2). In fact, the perceived lack of leadership\ncompetence was seen to be the cause of a host of related\nproblems, including unfair pay, a lack of leadership direc-\ntion, unclear or ineffective policies, and lack of growth\nopportunities. These problems interact with one another and\ncreate an arc of distortion or certainty gap between what is\nsaid and what is delivered. It is this arc of distortion that\ncauses the cycle of mistrust and suspicion to evolve.\nMcDonald, Kessel, and Fuller (1972) found there are three\ncomponents to trust: self-disclosure, competency, and\nrespect. He found that trust evolves in an atmosphere of\ntransparency but only when leaders can effectively carry out\ntheir message and only when their execution enables people\nto meet their work needs for autonomy, purpose, mastery,\nand belonging. Clearly, in this organization, senior leader-\nship was perceived not to be transparent, competent, or\ncaring.\nThis cycle of suspicion and mistrust \"caused\" or led to\nwhat employees referred to as the Loss of Leadership\nIntegrity. No one in a position of power was believed to be\nwilling or able to look out for the best interests of employee\nand,overtime,thiscausedorledtoFeelingsofPowerlessness.\nFinally, these feelings of powerlessness created the final out-\ncome of a Climate Apathy.\nWith these general comments in mind, let's take a more\ndetailed look at the system map. The first thing that stands\nout in the map is its structure, which has three distinct seg-\nments. The first segment reflects a closed loop feedback\ninvolving four drivers: board management, a lack of leader-\nship skills, ineffective human resource policies, and poor\ncommunications. These four affinities form a closed feed-\nback loop that reflects a vicious cycle--the cycle of leader-\nship incompetence. Vicious means that the loop produces a\nrange of negative and unintended consequences, the over-\narching effect was the belief that leaders, especially senior\nleadership, were believed to be incompetent.\nThe influencers comprising the first segment produced or\ncaused a second closed feedback vicious cycle--the cycle of\ndistrust--which also comprised four affinities: a lack of con-\nfidence in leaders, ineffective policies and procedures, lack\nof career development opportunities, and unfair promotions\nand raises. The cycle of distrust led to or caused the final seg-\nment of the map--the belief in this organization that leader-\nship lacked integrity which led to the development of feelings\nof powerlessness. This perceived powerlessness resulted in\nthe development of feelings of apathy and resignation.\nNow let's interpret each segment of the map and discuss\nthe implications of each for the effectiveness of then\norganization.\nSegment 1: The Cycle of Leadership\nIncompetence\nFigure 4 shows that the Cycle of Leadership Incompetence\ncomprised four affinities: the perceived ineffectiveness of\nthe board of directors and its policy making, the lack of\nTable 2.

These four affini-\nties interacted to create a closed feedback loop that eventu-\nally led to the perception that the organization was essentially\nleaderless. The hiring of a new CEO was created with the\nexpectation that the work environment would show signifi-\ncant improvement in openness and transparency and in the\nway employees were treated; instead, just the opposite\noccurred. The day to day experiences generated by the new\nleadership team were perceived to be at variance with the\nvalues espoused by them and not to be in the best interest of\nemployees.\nIneffective board management drove lack of leadership\nskills.Figure 5 shows the relationship between board man-\nagement and lack of leadership skills. The board had replaced\nthe previous CEO, who had been very dictatorial, a person\nwho gave orders and expected them to be obeyed without\nFigure 3. Systems Influence Diagram representing interpreted survey data.\nFigure 4. Relationship between Vicious Cycle 1 and Vicious Cycle 2.\nOwen et al. 9\ndebate, with a CEO believed to be very employee centric. On\nthe surface, the new GM appeared to be a good fit with the\norganization, but his practices turned out to be aloof, uncom-\nmunicative, and most problematic, indecisive. In addition,\nrather than getting rid of the old guard leadership, the new\nGM decided to retain many of them. This led to the percep-\ntion of a lack of leadership skills, and, in the minds of\nemployees, it was ineffective board management that resulted\nin a failure to hire a GM who had the competencies required\nto lead the organization out of the turmoil in which it was\nmired.\nLack of leadership skills drove ineffective HR policies. One of the\nmanifestations of ineffective leadership was ineffective HR\npolicies (see Figure 6). By HR policies, we refer to the deci-\nsions related to getting people into the organization, develop-\ning, promoting, empowering, recognizing and rewarding\nthem, and providing them due process. Policies are only\neffective if they are designed, implemented, and carried out\nproperly, which was not believed to be the case. In fact, there\nwas no policy regarding career development nor was there a\npolicy regarding salary advancement. In addition to this, the\nHR staff was believed to represent senior management and\nnot employees.\nIneffective HR policies drove perception of poor communica-\ntions. It is not likely a function that is perceived to be ineffec-\ntive would be perceived to communicate openly; thus, it was\nnot surprising that HR was believed to be misleading in its\ncommunications. With regard to their role implementing and\nenforcing relevant HR policies and procedures, HR was\nbelieved to be very ineffective (Figure 7). The organization\nwas rife with miscommunication about what the policies and\nprocedures were and they were believed to be unevenly and\nunfairly implemented across the organization.\nPoor communications drove the perceived ineffective board man-\nagement. Finally, poor communications between HR and the\nemployees as well as between leaders and employees further\nexacerbated the general belief that the Board was ineffective\n(Figure 8). Uniformly, employees felt they had no input into\nthe formulation of board policy nor any access or channel to\nFigure 5. Ineffective board management caused lack of leadership skills.\nFigure 6. Lack of leadership skills was the perceived cause of ineffective HR processes.\nFigure 7. Ineffective HR was the perceived cause of poor communications.\nvoice their concerns to the board. This led to the belief the\nBoard was not the least bit interested in looking out for\nemployees' interests and were thus unwilling to help them\nresolve major issues they had with members of the leader-\nship team.\nA study by Owen, Culbertson and Mink (2004) provided\na view of the cycle of leadership incompetence. In this study,\nthe aim was to examine the relationship between employee\noutcomes and leadership practices. Figure 9 (adapted from\nrelationship model that was the outcome of this study. The\nmain point is that when leaders are perceived to be compe-\ntent, the result is that employees are enthusiastic about their\njobs and the organization; when not, employees are apathetic\nand lack energy--and this is what we observed in the current\norganization.\nThe four elements described above interacted in a vicious\ncycle to cause a related vicious cycle, the cycle of distrust\n(Figure 10). The means by which this seems to have hap-\npened was the frequent breaking of agreements, the lack of\nFigure 8. Poor communications reinforced perception of board mismanagement.\nFigure 9. The leadership influence model.\ntransparency, and the lack of alignment between words and\ndeeds.\nSegment 2: The Cycle of Distrust\nThe cycle of distrust (Figure 11) was created by the interac-\ntion of four affinities: lack of confidence in leaders, ineffec-\ntive policies and procedures, lack of career development\nopportunities, and unfair rewards and recognitions. These\nfactors are in a constant state of interaction and this creates a\nself-reinforcing cycle that consistently communicated the\nmessage that leaders were not able and/or willing to provide\nemployees fair rewards and recognition, which thus rein-\nforced the lack of confidence in leadership.\nThis interpretation is supported by the work of McDonald\net al. (1972) who found that at the behavioral level, trust is\ndetermined by the degree to which leaders are transparent,\nkeep their commitments, and ensure employees' health and\nsafety. Underlying these behavioral manifestations of trust\nare leaders' intentions and competence. When leaders\nconsistently go back on their word and consistently fail to\ndeliver on their promises, employees start to question their\ntrue intentions and/or their ability to execute their intentions.\nWinter, Owen, Read, and Ritchie (2010) showed that an\nimportant determinant of safety excellence was the degree to\nwhich employees had confidence in leaders to execute the\nsafety strategy. In other words, safety results were influenced\nby the degree to which employees perceived their leaders to\nbe competent and to genuinely care about their safety.\nLack of confidence in leaders drove ineffective policies and proce-\ndures. Lack of confidence in leadership and the lack of clear\npolicies and procedures concerning promotions and salaries\nboth had the same number of ins and outs (see Table 2). This\nunderscores the fact that in an organization, management is\nresponsible for developing policies and procedures that take\ncare of employees'needs, especially with respect to develop-\ning, rewarding, and treating employees equitably. These\nthree concepts are central to employees being able to meet\ntheir needs at work. This was not taking place in the current\nFigure 10. Leadership incompetence caused the cycle of distrust.\nFigure 11. The cycle of distrust caused the loss of integrity.\norganization. Policies and procedures were hopelessly obso-\nlete and were seen to be unfair to employees. More impor-\ntantly, they were seen to be at variance with the promises of\nthe new management team. Instead leaders regularly said\none thing and did another. For example, employees were\npromised a cost of living raise; however, this decision was\nsuddenly reversed without explanation. This decision vio-\nlated the espoused value of transparency. Employees came to\nbelieve the values were no more than a publicity gimmick of\nthe new leadership team (Figure 12).\nIneffective policies and procedures drove lack of career develop-\nment opportunities.There was a total lack of policies and\nprocedures regarding career growth in the organization. This\nwas in part due to the history of the organization--the orga-\nnization was very stable for many years. In any case, no clear\npolicies regarding career development existed, nor was there\na career ladder for any position. As a result, employees felt\ntrapped into a completely arbitrary process that was con-\ntrolled by a manager, whom they typically did not trust to\nhave their best interest at heart (Figure 13). This lack of a\ncareer path meant that employees perceived themselves as\nlocked into a pay grade indefinitely.\nLack of career development opportunities led to unfair promo-\ntions and pay raises. The fact that there were no adequate or\nmeaningful policies and procedures regarding career growth\nmeant that there was no rational basis for giving employees\npromotions or pay raises. In the past, this had not been a\nproblem, for every year each employee got a cost-of-living\nadjustment and this seemed to have sufficed; however, in the\nmidst of the current financial crisis caused by the outgoing\nCEO, the cost-of-living adjustment was eliminated and\npromised raises were delayed. The effect of this was an\nintense feeling among employees they were not being treated\nfairly or equitably. Research by Sirota, Mischkind, and Melt-\nzer (2005) showed that equitable treatment is the single most\nimportant determinant of satisfaction with an organization.\nWhen employees perceive a lack of equity, they become\nintensely dissatisfied with their organization and many, if\ngiven the opportunity, will leave the organization. Unfortu-\nnately, for the employees of this organization, leaving was\nnot a generally viable option and this led to the further ero-\nsion of confidence in leaders (Figure 14).\nLack of promotions and pay raises eroded confidence in leaders'\ncompetence.Figure 15 shows the relationship between the\nlack of promotions and raises and the loss of confidence in\nleaders. There was more than 90% agreement among the\nrank and file employees that senior and middle-level man-\nagement in this organization could not be counted on to do\nwhat was right for employees. Research shows that when\nemployees do not feel as if they are valued by their organiza-\ntion, they develop feelings of hostility and/or despair. Fur-\nthermore, they begin to feel trapped. Ironically, at this\norganization, employees felt an intense loyalty to their cus-\ntomers and this loyalty amplified the already intense level of\nanxiety and anger toward the organization and its leaders.\nThe cycle of distrust produced what employees referred to\nas a loss of perceived integrity. In effect, senior leaders (and\nthe board) were perceived to have betrayed the covenant that\nhad long defined the relationship between employees and the\nFigure 12. Lack of confidence in leaders drove perception that policies and procedures were ineffective.\nFigure 13. Lack of effective policies drove the lack of career development opportunities.\norganization (Figure 16). Dictionary.com defines integrity as\n\"adherence to moral and ethical principles; soundness of\nmoral character.\" Leadership was perceived to lack this\nmoral character. It was not that they were believed to lack\ncharacter per se but that they lacked the ability to fulfill their\npromises. As a result, each day, employees would come to\nwork and expect to be treated with indifference.\nSegment 3: The Perceived Loss of Integrity\nCreated a Sense of Powerlessness and Eventually\nApathy\nLeadership incompetence was believed to produce a cycle of\ndistrust which was perceived to result in a loss of organiza-\ntional integrity and eventually feelings of powerlessness and\napathy. This set of relationships represents the third segment\nof the system map.\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies. The first element in Figure 17 repre-\nsents a generalized expectation. An expectation is a psycho-\nlogical prediction that something will occur. The effects of\nsuch expectations have been widely researched. For one\nthing, it is known that expectations tend to be self-fulfilling\n(Bandura, 1997). If I believe that leaders have little integrity,\nand if I believe there is nothing I can do about it, then I tend\nto act in accordance with this set of beliefs. Furthermore, I\ntend to see only those features of the environment that rein-\nforce this belief (this is referred to as belief bias).\nLet's look at this phenomenon from the perspective of\nmotivation theory. A widely accepted theory is that people\nbring to work each day three basic needs: achievement,\net al., 2005). Each day, the organization and its leaders create\na range of experiences, some of which provide an opportu-\nnity to meet these needs, through the job, through relation-\nships with others, through the character of the organization,\nand so forth, and some of which do not. At our subject orga-\nnization, employees found it impossible to meet these needs.\nThis state of affairs leads to the predictable effects of learned\npowerlessness. Learned powerlessness has three compo-\nnents. Cognitively, it is the belief that there is nothing\nin one's power that can be done to meet one's needs;\nFigure 14. Lack of career development opportunities drove unfair pay and raises.\nFigure 15. Unfair pay and raises further eroded confidence in leaders.\nFigure 16. The cycle of distrust led to the perceived loss of integrity.\nemotionally, it is the expectation of failure; and behaviorally,\nit is acting in a manner that is consistent with the belief.\nillustrates the self-fulfilling nature of beliefs and the expecta-\ntions and actions that are created as a result.\nFeelings of powerlessness lead to apathy and resignation.There\nwas 100% agreement among our PathMAP\u00ae groups that the\ncurrent climate of the organization was characterized by low\ntrust and high fear. This emotional state was the experience\nof a majority of employees who worked for this organization\nthe determinants of self-esteem, found that three conditions\nactivate expectations: self-efficacy (I can), response efficacy\n(I'll be successful), and outcome expectation (I'll get some-\nthing I value). In the organization, the latter of the three con-\nditions was lacking. No matter how hard one worked or how\nwell one performed, there was no commensurate reward or\nrecognition. In fact, many believed wages were kept deliber-\nately low.\nA Disconnect Between Effort and\nOutcome\nSeidman (2007) showed that when people fail to see a rela-\ntionship between effort and outcome, a generalized expecta-\ntion of powerlessness and learned helplessness develops (the\nresponse is elicited by a wide array of situational cues that\nbear some degree of similarity to the original cue). For exam-\nple, when my effort consistently fails to produce an increase\nin pay, I come to doubt all my interactions with an\norganization.\nMuch has been written about the vicious cycle of distrust\nin organizations as opposed to a virtuous cycle of trust. The\nresearch by Gibb (1978) and his students sheds the most\nrevealing light on the root causes and effects of the cycle of\ntrust versus mistrust. According to Gibb, there are two pri-\nmary processes available to any human interaction: an open-\ning and a defending process. Which of these becomes part of\nan organization's culture depends on the level of trust and\ntransparency perceived to characterize the organization\nFigure 17. Relationship between leadership integrity and congruence.\nFigure 18. Beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies.\n(Table 3). In a trusting environment, opening is the norma-\ntive process and a positive inner work life the outcome. In a\ndistrusting environment, defending is the normative process\nand a negative work life the outcome. Clearly, in our \"sub-\nject\" organization, defending was the norm.\nWhat are the effects of this climate? We can think of\neffects in terms of the short term and the long term. In the\nshort run, employees feel betrayed by the company's leader-\nship. The implicit covenant between employees and the orga-\nnization was one based on the belief the organization would\nlook out for its employees; this covenant was broken when\nemployees were consistently treated as if they were not\nvalued.\nIn the long run, the betrayal employees experienced was a\nviolation of what McDonald et al. (1972) called contract\ntrust (unilaterally breaking an agreement). From the victim's\npoint of view, a betrayal of trust produces shock, disappoint-\nment, and eventually a reevaluation of one's belief system.\nThis is because every betrayal makes the victim look back\nover their past to try to determine what caused it. This reflec-\ntion almost inevitably leads to self-blame and guilt.Although\nemployees may express anger and indignation at not being\ntreated well, underneath this anger, there is a loss of self-\nworth, of feelings of efficacy and the ability to control one's\nenvironments and produce outcomes that will enable people\nto meet their needs. This path between betrayal and unwor-\nthiness is how deception causes so much damage. Because\nbetrayal causes the victims to feel bad about themselves,\nthey are hit twice--first, the social contract has been broken\nand second, they think poorly of themselves.\nBetrayal, then leads to and reinforces feelings of power-\nlessness as the victims come to believe there is no way they\ncan fix the situation. Such powerlessness leads to what\nHarvey (1988) referred to as anaclitic depression--the loss\nof the sense of self at work that is caused by a separation or\nloss. Sometimes the loss of power leads to fantasies of\nrevenge. The movie \"Inglorious Bastards\" demonstrates this\nfantasy. As Daniel Mendelsohn (2009) said, \"Tarantino\nindulges this taste for vengeful violence by--well, by turn-\ning Jews into Nazis.\" Being passive is so painful that we\noften want to turn passive into active. The victim becomes\nthe perpetrator. More often than not, in the workplace, the\nloss of power leads to apathy and resignation.\nWhat Can Change?\nClearly, there is a need for change in this organization. The\nquestion is what should be changed. When answering this\nquestion, two issues must be analyzed. First, while it might\nbe tempting to focus on Low Integrity, by designing a feed-\nback system and holding those in leadership roles account-\nable for how they are perceived, doing this might turn out to\nbe akin to treating the symptom and not the disease. It may\nproduce a short-term relief from the pain, but it may not\neliminate the root cause of it. One could expect the disease to\nworsen over time, even though its symptoms may not be as\nobvious. The fact is this element is the predictable outcome\nof other more pernicious issues at work in this system. The\nbest strategy, all else equal, is to focus on drivers as close to\nthe primary driver as possible.\nThe decision as to which driver to focus on is, in part,\ndetermined by the driver's malleability. Dictionary.com\ndefines this concept as adaptable or tractable such as the mal-\nleable mind of a child. Malleability, then, refers to which of\nthe primary drivers are most susceptible to change. Based on\nthis concept, we propose the most obvious intervention is to\nstrengthen the leadership capability of the system. Figure 20\nshows a system of leadership development that bridges the\ngap between the lack of confidence in leadership and the\ncycle of distrust. This system is based on a study of best prac-\ntices in leadership development conducted by the Research\nBoard of the Corporate Leadership Council (2004). As can\nbe seen, the process starts with the development of behavior-\nally based leadership descriptions. By focusing on what lead-\ners are expected to do as opposed to focusing on some\nTable 3.

Feelings of powerlessness result in a climate of apathy.\nabstract trait or style, it is possible to create expectations and\nstandards that are actually observable and measurable. This,\nthen makes it possible to formatively evaluate current role\noccupants and provide them coaching and mentoring prior to\nholding them accountable for their practices.\nConclusion\nThis article presents an in-depth look at an organization with\ndeep systemic issues that need to be addressed in order for\nthe organization to move forward in a healthy manner.\nPathMAP\u00ae was used, in conjunction with a quantitative\nemployee survey, to take this deep look into the inner dynam-\nics of this organization. While the organization has a unique\ncontext and culture, it is not alone in having problems;\nPathMAP\u00ae can be fruitfully used in other organizations to\ncreate a shared understanding of organizational reality and\nhow to make significant improvements in organizational\nfunctioning. PathMAP\u00ae can be used to identify the mallea-\nble elements that can be manipulated to improve the organi-\nzation and to generate heuristic validity for the solution.\nPathMAP\u00ae reflects a recent evolution of organizational\nassessment tools that have a heritage in the work of Deming\nand others (for a representative list of such tools, see\nCambridge University Institute for Manufacturing, n.d.).\nThis heritage is important. Organizations today are inher-\nently more complex than the manufacturing environment of\n1950s Japan. The tools used by organizational experts must\nkeep pace with the complexity of the organizations they are\ntrying to assist. PathMAP\u00ae provides a stable systemic pic-\nture of influencers in the organization and provides a picture\nof empirical truth (correspondent truth) as perceived by those\nliving it day to day. It provides a picture that allows practitio-\nners (both internal and external) to compare the \"truths\"\nfrom the population of authors and come to a shared sense of\nvalidity for the organization.\nIntheprecedingpages,wehavedescribedhowPathMAP\u00ae\nwas used to accomplish three important aims from the per-\nspective of the change agent:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Involving stakeholders in interpreting the data they\nauthored.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Deepening understanding of the system of which the\nparticipants are a part.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Facilitating the design and execution of change and\ntransformation.\nWhat makes PathMAP\u00ae so useful and powerful in\naccomplishing these three aims? There are a variety of rea-\nsons, both pragmatic and theoretical.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It gets the people who wrote the text engaged in the\nprocess of telling the reader what she or he really\nmeant (heuristic validity or shared meaning).\nFigure 20. A model for developing confidence in leaders.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It builds commitment.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It provides a picture of system influences and effects\nand thus provides a qualitative estimate of concurrent\nvalidity (in comparison with survey multivariate\nanalysis).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It provides a picture of empirical truth (correspondent\ntruth).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It provides a picture of the coherent truth as it allows\nus to compare the \"truth statements\" from the popula-\ntion of authors.\nThe case study is an important initial step in exploring\nPathMAP\u00ae as a tool for better understanding the systemic\ninfluences that affect an organization; however, there are two\ncautions to take away from this study. First, the PathMAP\u00ae,\nlike any other point in time assessment, is just that--a point in\ntime. It is obvious that the organization continues to move in\ndynamic ways that are unpredictable to some extent. That being\nsaid, after a first series of interventions are conducted, it would\nbe important to conduct a subsequent PathMAP\u00ae to determine\nthe effectiveness of the interventions. Second, there is clearly\nneed for more focused research to be conducted on PathMAP\u00ae\nprocess, results, and the effectiveness of organizational inter-\nventions that come from an interpretation of the results.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBandura, A.
