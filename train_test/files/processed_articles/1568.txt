In adults, the metabolic syndrome\nhas been defined by criteria established by 3 different\nauthorities: the National Cholesterol Education Panel:\nAdult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) (7), the World Health\nOrganization (8), and the International Diabetes Federa-\ntion (9). In the United States, the metabolic syndrome is\nestimated to be present in 22% of adults (10) and 4% of\nadolescents overall, with 28% among overweight and\n0.1% among normal-weight adolescents (11). The ado-\nlescent data, however, are limited by inconsistent adap-\ntations of adult metabolic syndrome definitions to the\npediatric population and lack of a pediatric specific\nThe association between metabolic syndrome and\nNAFLD has been well described in adults (17\u00ad21) and\nin a limited number of non-nationally representative\npediatric studies (22\u00ad24).

However, this specific\nassociation has not been clearly established in studies\nof ethnically diverse US adolescents, who present with\nmany phenotypical differences from adults. The aim of\nthis study was to test, in a nationally representative and\nmultiethnic sample of US adolescents, the hypothesis that\nadolescents with the metabolic syndrome are 4 or more\ntimes more likely to have ALT>40 U/L, as a surrogate\nfor NAFLD, compared with adolescents without the\nmetabolic syndrome. The directionality and magnitude\nof this hypothesis were based on estimates from the adult\nliterature (25), the lower limit of the CI found in the\nStrauss et al study (6), and what the investigators con-\nsidered a priori as clinically significant.\nThis cross-sectional study evaluated a nationally represen-\ntative sample of adolescents living in the United States between\nNHANES includes in-person interviews, physical examina-\ntion, and laboratory testing. Participants are sampled using\na stratified, multistage, probability sampling method with\nover-sampling of low-income families, adolescents, blacks,\nand Mexican Americans. Subjects included in this study were\n12 through 19 years of age, with available anthropometric,\nrelevant questionnaire, and fasting (>8 hours) laboratory data.\nSubjects were excluded for lack of data for any of the 5 meta-\nbolic syndrome components, hepatitis B surface antigen or\nhepatitis C antibody positivity, total bilirubin >1.5 mg/dL,\ncurrent use of systemic steroids or any potentially hepatotoxic\nmedications, any past or current alcohol use, or pregnancy. This\nstudy was exempted from review by The Children's Hospital of\nPhiladelphia institutional review board. The original NHANES\nresearch protocol was approved by a human subjects review\nboard and written informed consent was obtained from all\nsubjects 18 years of age or older or from a parent/legal guardian\nof subjects younger than 18 years. Written assent was also\nobtained from adolescents younger than 18 years.\nInterview data included age, sex, ethnicity/race, household\nincome, number of household members, alcohol intake, medi-\ncation history, hepatitis A vaccine status, and dietary intake\n(26). Ethnicity and race were determined from a series of\nquestions that began by asking subjects to identify their national\norigin as Mexican American, other Hispanic, both Mexican and\nother Hispanic, or not Hispanic. Then, subjects were asked\nto identify their race as American Indian/Alaska Native,\nAsian Black/African American, native Hawaiian/other Pacific\nIslander, White, or Other. Because the literature has suggested\nmore common in people of Hispanic ethnicity, an interaction by\nHispanic ethnicity in the association between metabolic syn-\ndrome and elevated ALT was hypothesized and thus ethnicity/\nrace was dichotomized into Hispanic and non-Hispanic. The\npoverty\u00adincome ratio (PIR) (29), calculated as household\nincome divided by poverty threshold, with a maximum value\nof 5, was used as a continuous variable from 0 to 5. A PIR 1\nindicated poverty and a PIR >1 indicated nonpoverty (29).\nAlcohol intake data were collected via self-administered com-\nputer questionnaire with subjects, isolated from study staff and\nfamily members, being asked to identify at what age they had\ntheir first alcoholic drink. Only subjects who reported never\ndrinking alcohol were included. Those who reported any intake\nand those who did not answer this question were excluded.\nDietary fat and energy intake were measured from a 24-hour\ndietary recall performed either in-person at the time of health\ninterview or over the telephone, 4 to 10 days later. Total dietary\nfat was transformed into percent of total energy from fat using\nthe formula: ([{fat, g} \u00c2 {9 kcal/g}/{total kcal}] \u00c2 100).\nPhysical examination data included body weight, standing\nheight, and abdominal waist circumference at the level of the\nileac crest (30). Body mass index was calculated using the\nstandard formula: ([body weight, kg]/[height, m2]). Weight,\nheight, and BMI were converted into z scores and percentiles for\nsex and age using the LMS method (31) and the pediatric\nanthropometric references from the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention growth charts (32,33). Waist circumference\nmeasurements were classified as above or below the 90th\npercentile according to age- and sex-specific references derived\nfrom NHANES III (34). One to 4 blood pressure (BP) measure-\nments were obtained manually with a sphygmomanometer\naccording to the 1993 American Heart Association blood\npressure\u00admeasuring guidelines (30,35).

There is currently no universally\naccepted pediatric definition of metabolic syndrome (16). An\nabnormal ALTwas defined as <40 U/L on the basis of clinically\nExamples of clinically used normal reference ranges for ALT\n4 to 36 U/L for either sex (39). Although lower cutoffs have\nbeen used in several older studies (6,27), most recent studies\nDescriptive analyses were performed using the Pearson x2\ntest for dichotomous variables and the adjusted Wald test for\ncontinuous variables. For all regression analyses, ALT >40 U/L\nwas the dichotomous dependent variable. Univariable and\nmultivariable logistic regressions were used to evaluate the\nmain effect of metabolic syndrome on ALT elevation and to\nexplore several potential effect modifiers and confounders\ndetermined a priori. Age, sex, and ethnicity/race were con-\nsidered potential effect modifiers and were tested in that order\nusing interaction terms in logistic regression and checking with\na stratified analysis. Age, sex, ethnicity/race, poverty\u00adincome\nratio, dietary fat intake, and BMI z score were considered\npotential confounders and were also tested using logistic\nregression. Initially, the association of each potential confound-\ning factor was assessed separately with each exposure and\noutcome variable. If a positive association was found with\neither the exposure or outcome, then that factor was tested in\na regression model. If its inclusion in the model resulted in a\nchange in point estimate of the OR by more than 10%, then that\nfactor was considered a confounder and included in the final\nmodel (41). Appropriate sampling weights, stratum, and popu-\nlation sampling unit factors were applied for all analyses to\naccount for the sampling methods of NHANES, as well as for\nthe likelihood of nonresponse, for the results to be representa-\ntive of the US population of adolescents. Statistical significance\nwas defined as P < 0.05.

To our\nknowledge, this is the first report of the association\nbetween pediatric metabolic syndrome and elevated\nALT in a US population\u00adbased sample of adolescents\nas well as the first description of a significant interaction\nby sex and ethnicity for this association in a pediatric\npopulation.\nThe association between metabolic syndrome and ALT\nelevation in the pediatric population was previously\ndescribed by Park et al (22) in Korean adolescents. In\nthat study, the age and BMI adjusted OR for the asso-\nciation between elevated ALT (>40 U/L) and metabolic\nparable to our findings. The Korean study also found\nthat the association between metabolic syndrome and\nALT>40 U/L was independent of BMI (22), similar to\nour findings among non-Hispanic males. However, a\npotential interaction by sex was not evaluated in that\nstudy (22). Another study by Burgert et al (24) performed\nin a multiethnic cohort of obese adolescents in the United\nStates also demonstrated a positive association between\nmetabolic syndrome and ALT>35 U/L, although the\nstrength of the association was not reported. Although\nthe association between metabolic syndrome and NAFLD\nmost pediatric studies have focused on the association\nbetween obesity or hyperinsulinemia, rather than meta-\nbolic syndrome, and elevated ALT or NAFLD (6,27,28,\n47\u00ad49). However, a recent case-control study among\nobese children 5 to 17 years of age found that those with\nbiopsy-proven NAFLD were 5 times more likely to have\nmetabolic syndrome than those without NAFLD (50).\nA significant interaction by sex for the association\nbetween metabolic syndrome and ALT elevation was\nfound in the present study. Although such interaction\nhas not been previously reported in the pediatric age,\nseveral adult studies have shown sex differences in the\nassociation between metabolic syndrome and NAFLD\nindependent association of metabolic syndrome with\nhepatic steatosis by ultrasound in both sexes; however, the\nassociation between metabolic syndrome and elevated\nALT was present in males but not females. Hamaguchi\net al (17) reported a sex difference in the strength of the\nassociation of metabolic syndrome with NAFLD by\nultrasound among Japanese adults (adjusted OR 11.20\nfor males; adjusted OR 4.00 for females). Sorrentino et al\n(52) showed that, among Italian adults with metabolic\nsyndrome, female sex was associated with ``silent-\nNASH,'' for which ALT was normal but liver histology\nshowed NASH. Our results in adolescents and data from\nadult studies suggest the possibility of a biological\ndifference between the sexes in the degree or timing\nof ALT elevation or in the susceptibility of the liver to\neffects of metabolic syndrome.\nThe interaction by Hispanic ethnicity noted for the\nassociation of metabolic syndrome with ALT elevation\namong males has not been previously described in the\npediatric or adult literature. However, several studies\nhave reported a disproportionately higher prevalence\nof NAFLD among Hispanic adults compared with other\nethnic groups (51,53). In the pediatric literature, preva-\nlence estimates of metabolic syndrome in overweight\nHispanic children living in the United States have been\nsimilar to that of overweight children of other ethnicity\nation between metabolic syndrome and elevated ALT\nbetween Hispanic and non-Hispanic adolescent males, as\nwell as our finding in non-Hispanic males of an inde-\npendent effect of metabolic syndrome on the odds of\nelevated ALT regardless of BMI, suggests potential\nenvironmental, biological, or genetic modifiers in the\ndevelopment of NAFLD that differ between people of\nHispanic versus non-Hispanic ethnicity. Further study of\nthese ethnic variations is warranted because this could\nhave implications for prevention and therapy.\nThe independent association of metabolic syndrome\nwith elevated ALT beyond the effect of overweight has\nnot been specifically described in pediatric studies.\nHowever, insulin resistance, which is closely linked to\nmetabolic syndrome, has been strongly associated with\nNAFLD independent of BMI in adults (56).

The data are derived\nfrom a nationally representative sample of adolescents,\nwhich allows for generalizability to the US population\nof adolescents. The multiethnic/racial population and\noversampling of Mexican Americans allowed for direct\ntesting of interaction by Hispanic ethnicity. The measure-\nment of several potential confounding variables also\nallowed for either exclusion of or direct testing and\nadjustment for these factors.\nThe limitations of this study include its observational,\ncross-sectional study design, which does not allow a\ncause\u00adeffect relation between metabolic syndrome and\nelevated ALT to be determined. The lack of consensus for\na pediatric definition of metabolic syndrome is a potential\nlimitation (16). The modified ATPIII criteria have been\nused in several prior pediatric studies (54,57) and were\nadapted here to provide a conservative definition of\nmetabolic syndrome. The use of ALT as a surrogate\nmarker for presumed NAFLD is an important limitation.\nHowever, this limitation should be weighed against the\nadvantage of studying a large nationally representative\ndatabase, for which liver biopsy and imaging data are not\navailable and would be difficult to obtain. Because data in\nthe pediatric literature support a strong relation between\nwere able to exclude or account for most alternate\nexplanations for elevated ALT, we believe this to be a\nreasonable surrogate for this study. Although the analysis\nused a statistical significance level of P < 0.05, the use of\nmultiple comparisons could have resulted in some asso-\nciations being spuriously identified; however, the\nstrength of the main effect is so large that it is unlikely\nthat this would invalidate our main findings. The main\naim of this study was to evaluate the association of\nmetabolic syndrome and elevated ALT among US ado-\nlescents, rather than to assess the prevalence of elevated\nALT, and therefore, the inclusion and exclusion criteria\nused in this study were designed to maximize the internal\nvalidity of this association and the prevalence data pro-\nvided here may not be representative of the entire US\npopulation of adolescents. Exclusion of subjects with any\nor unknown alcohol use, lack of fasting blood sample,\nand other exclusion criteria may affect generalizability of\nour findings but are unlikely to affect validity of our\nfindings in the association between metabolic syndrome\nand elevated ALT. This would only be the case if the\nassociation between metabolic syndrome and elevated\nALT was different between included and excluded sub-\njects. We believe that this is unlikely to be the case.\nFor example, by excluding subjects for alcohol intake,\nwe may have excluded more of the older adolescents;\nhowever, because there was no interaction by age, we do\nnot believe that exclusion of older adolescents likely\nbiased the results. If subjects were to have underreported\ntheir alcohol intake and stated that they never ingested\nalcohol but really had, then this could have led to the\ninclusion of some subjects who would have otherwise\nbeen excluded.\nIn conclusion, metabolic syndrome was strongly\nassociated with elevated ALT, a surrogate for NAFLD,\nin a nationally representative sample of US adolescents.\nA significant interaction by sex was found with a strong\nassociation in males but no statistically significant asso-\nciation in females. Among Hispanic males, the asso-\nciation between metabolic syndrome and elevated ALT\nwas largely explained by BMI; however, among non-\nHispanic males, metabolic syndrome was associated with\n11-fold increased odds of elevated ALT, independent of\nBMI. Future research is warranted into the sex and ethnic\neffect modification within the relation between metabolic\nsyndrome and accurately measured NAFLD in children.\nAcknowledgement: The authors gratefully acknowledge the\ncontributions of Kathleen J.
