The criteria were revised to apply to all\npeople older than 65 years. This study used the revised\ncriteria in ambulatory settings to quantify potentially\ninappropriate prescription of psychotropic agents and\nidentify associated characteristics.\nMethods: The 1996 public use data files of the Na-\ntional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the Na-\ntional Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were ana-\nlyzed for inappropriate prescription of psychotropic\nmedications for the elderly in office-based settings and\noutpatient departments. Disease-independent and disease-\ndependent criteria were analyzed.\nResults: Elderly patients were prescribed a psycho-\ntropic agent in 8.7% of all visits, antidepressant and an-\ntianxiety agents being the most frequently prescribed\nmedications. Commonly, elderly patients receiving psy-\nchotropic agents were female, white, aged between 65 and\n74 years, and received health care in a metropolitan area.\nPotentially inappropriate psychotropic agents were pre-\nscribed in 27.2% of all visits involving a psychotropic agent\nfor the elderly. Disease-independent criteria (eg, anti-\ndepressant agents and long-acting benzodiazepines) ac-\ncounted for most of the potentially inappropriate pre-\nscriptions. Factors positively associated with potentially\ninappropriate prescriptions included older age, \"seen be-\nfore\" status, and antidepressant drug class, while enroll-\nment in Medicaid, antipsychotic drug class, living in the\nNortheast region, and receiving health care in a metro-\npolitan area were negatively associated.\nConclusions: Potentiallyinappropriateprescriptionofpsy-\nchotropic agents is very common for the elderly patient\nin the ambulatory setting.

A detailed list of medica-\ntionsundereachpsychotropicclass17-19 isprovidedinTable 1.\nThe psychotropic agent classification was based on standard\nreferences and published literature. The explicit criteria de-\nveloped by Beers9 were used to define potentially inappro-\npriatepsychotropicusebytheelderly.Thepsychotropicdrugs\nconsidered potentially inappropriate for this study entailed\nmedications that should be generally avoided in the elderly\n(disease-independent inappropriate medications) and medi-\ncationsthatshouldbeavoidedbecauseofpreexistingdisease\norcondition(disease-dependentinappropriatemedications).\nThedisease-independentanddisease-dependentinappropri-\nPsychotropic drugs considered potentially inappropriate\nbased on dose were not examined because of limitations of\nthe data sources.\nData extraction, coding, and analysis involved 3 steps.\nFirst, visits involving psychotropic drugs for patients aged\n65 years or older were abstracted. Second, single-entity and\ncombination drugs, along with the diagnoses, were exam-\nined for the potentially inappropriate psychotropic medi-\ncations. Third, certain variables including patient, visit, and\nprovider characteristics were recoded for analytical pur-\nposes. Extracted data sets from the NAMCS and NHAMCS\nwere combined to analyze potentially inappropriate psy-\nchotropic agent prescribing in ambulatory settings. From\nthe 2 national surveys, 1373 records involving psycho-\ntropic agents were extracted in the first step and 309 rec-\nords involving potentially inappropriate psychotropic agents\nwere extracted in the second step.\nNational visit estimates were derived based on the pa-\ntient sampling weight provided by the NCHS to examine\nthe nature and extent of potentially inappropriate psycho-\ntropic prescribing in ambulatory care settings (N=309). All\nthe visit estimates, visit rates, and percentage distribu-\ntions were calculated based on the information provided\nby the NCHS for the national surveys.11,12 To examine pre-\ndictors of potentially inappropriate psychotropic prescrip-\ntion, multiple logistic regression methods were applied to\nmodified weights to account for the complex design of the\nmodel were patient characteristics (ie, age, sex, race, in-\nsurance status, and payment method), visit (ie, referral, \"seen\nbefore\" status, injury, and surgery), medication (ie, num-\nber of medications, number of psychotropic agents, and psy-\nchotropic class), and provider characteristics (ie, nonphy-\nsician, ambulatory setting, region of the country, and\nmetropolitan location of health care).

The psychotropic prescribing patterns for the\nelderly in ambulatory settings are given in Table 4.\nApproximately 4.5 million visits (27.2% of all visits in-\nvolving psychotropic agents prescribed for the elderly)\ninvolved at least 1 potentially inappropriate psycho-\ntropic agent. The percentages of visits involving pre-\nscription of potentially inappropriate psychotropic agents\nin office practice and outpatient departments were 27.95%\nand 19.28%, respectively. Disease-independent poten-\ntially inappropriate agents accounted for 94.14%, and dis-\nease-dependent potentially inappropriate agents ac-\ncounted for 12.13% of all visits involving potentially\ninappropriate psychotropic agents (Table 5). A visit was\ncounted more than once if multiple criteria were met. An-\ntidepressant agents and antianxiety agents constituted\nmost of the potentially inappropriate prescribing in dis-\nease-independent situations, whereas antidepressant\nagents and sedative/hypnotic drugs made up most of the\npotentially inappropriate prescription in disease-\ndependent situations. Overall, potentially inappropri-\nate psychotropic prescribing most often involved anti-\ndepressant agents and antianxiety agents, and the least\nlikely involved drugs were antipsychotic agents. Beers'\ncriteria9 also included a severity rating scale that incor-\nporated the probability of the adverse outcome occur-\nring and the clinical significance of the problem (Table\n2 and Table 3). According to this severity rating scale,\n95.34% of the visits involving potentially inappropriate\npsychotropic medications cause a high-severity type of\nadverse outcome.\nThe logistic model was used to evaluate the factors pre-\ndicting potentially inappropriate psychotropic agent pre-\nscribing in ambulatory settings.

However, a larger effect would have been\nexpected from the expanded 1997 criteria, which\nincluded both disease-dependent criteria and more\ndisease-independent criteria.\nMost potentially inappropriate psychotropic medi-\ncation visits are accounted for by the disease-\nindependent criteria. Since the disease-dependent crite-\nria are much more restrictive, this category would be\nexpected to constitute a smaller percentage of visits. The\nsmall percentage may also be because of the limited\nnumber of diagnoses (ie, up to 3) that were available in\nthe data source. This research suggests that disease-\nindependent criteria are an important aspect to con-\nsider when attempting to have the greatest impact on the\nprescription of potentially inappropriate psychotropic\nagents.\nAntidepressant and antianxiety classes were the most\ncommonly involved potentially inappropriate psycho-\ntropic medications prescribed in this study as well as in\nthe 7 disease-independent criteria and 5 of the 8 disease-\ndependent criteria. Therefore, it would be anticipated that\nthey would account for most of the potentially inappro-\npriate prescribing. More specifically, most potentially in-\nappropriate psychotropic agent visits involved amitrip-\ntyline, an antidepressant agent that can cause substantial\nanticholinergic effects and sedation.9 The antianxiety\nagents considered potentially inappropriate were pri-\nmarily composed of the long-acting benzodiazepines,\nwhich are associated with sedation, falls, and fractures.9\nTherefore, by focusing on amitriptyline and long-acting\nbenzodiazepines, physicians can significantly change\ninappropriate prescribing for and quality of life of the\nelderly.\nThe importance of these 2 classes of medications\nin potentially inappropriate prescription was further\nvalidated by a large consensus panel in Canada.37 The cri-\nteria produced by this panel also included the avoid-\nance of amitriptyline to treat depression and of long-\nacting benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, insomnia, or\nagitation in dementia. While the Canadian criteria are\nmore disease specific, the indications associated with the\nTable 6.

The odds of prescribing a po-\ntentially inappropriate psychotropic medication in-\ncreased by 2% for each additional year of patient age or\n10% for every 5-year increment of an elderly patient's age.\nPrevious studies examining all criteria for inappropriate\nprescription have reported higher rates in patients older\nthan 80 years.7,39 The positive association of seen before\npatients suggests that previously seen patients are more\nthan twice as likely to receive potentially inappropriate\npsychotropic medications than new patients. Consis-\ntent with a previous study, our study found the highest\nodds of potentially inappropriate psychotropic prescrip-\ntion were for antidepressant agents.36 Amitriptyline con-\nstituted most of these potentially inappropriate prescrip-\ntion cases, and its use is rarely justified for the elderly\nbecause safer antidepressant agents are available.9 Be-\ncause of the consistent findings, efforts focusing on these\npatient and drug characteristics could provide the great-\nest impact on inappropriate psychotropic medication\nprescribing.\nCharacteristics associated with a decreased likeli-\nhood of a visit involving prescription of a potentially in-\nappropriate psychotropic agent included antipsychotic\ndrug class, Medicaid status, metropolitan area, and North-\neast region location. The antipsychotic class was least\nlikely to be associated with potentially inappropriate pre-\nscription. This may be owing to increased awareness\namong prescribers or limited use of antipsychotic agents\nin patientswith seizure disorders. The relationshipofMed-\nicaid status to decreased usage of potentially inappro-\npriate medications may be partially explained by pre-\nscription benefit plans. Medicaid programs involve some\nsystemwide control mechanisms such as prospective and\nretrospective drug utilization reviews to improve physi-\ncian prescribing practices.40 Consistent with a previous\nstudy,8 our study found that physicians practicing in met-\nropolitan areas were less likely to prescribe inappropri-\nately, yet no clear explanation exists for this difference.\nAnother geographic factor negatively associated with po-\ntentially inappropriate psychotropic prescription was the\nNortheast region. However, prescribing patterns in other\nregions might raise some concerns. Therefore, the re-\ngion and location characteristics associated with lower\nodds of potentially inappropriate psychotropic use re-\nquire further examination to understand the relation-\nship before the most effective strategy for modifying pre-\nscribing patterns can be deployed.\nAlthough our study provided greater insight into po-\ntentially inappropriate psychotropic prescribing pat-\nterns for the elderly in outpatient settings, the results were\nlimited by the definitions and data sources used. Be-\ncause of the limitations of the data sources, our study did\nnot examine psychotropic agents considered poten-\ntially inappropriate based on excessive dosage. There-\nfore, this probably underestimated the extent of inap-\npropriately prescribed psychotropic medications in the\nelderly. In addition, data collection limitations such as a\nmaximum of 6 medications and 3 diagnoses may have\nyielded an underreporting of the total number of poten-\ntially inappropriate medications prescribed. The inde-\npendent variables included in the logistic analysis were\nlimited to those available from the data sources. Further-\nmore, the analyses explored associations between the\nindependent variables and potentially inappropriate\nprescription, and did not address cause-and-effect rela-\ntionships between them. In this study, the overall an-\nnual visit estimates are considered stable by the NCHS.\nHowever, extrapolation of national visits from the sub-\nsamples could create potential problems regarding the\nreliability and confidence level of smaller estimates.15,16\nThe inherent disadvantages of using secondary data, such\nas difficulty in evaluating accuracy caused by errors in\ndata collection, analysis, and reporting, were also limi-\ntations of this study.\nIn summary, potentially inappropriate prescrip-\ntion is a major issue in the effort to optimize care for the\nelderly while avoiding excessive costs associated with ad-\nverse outcomes. Future research should quantify the\nhealth care impact of prescribing these potentially inap-\npropriate agents. Currently, inappropriate prescription\nof psychotropic agents is very common for the elderly\nin the ambulatory setting, with 27.2% of all psycho-\ntropic agent\u00adrelated visits involving a potentially in-\nappropriate psychotropic agent. A small number of\npsychotropic medications (ie, amitriptyline and long-\nacting benzodiazepines) were involved in most of the\nvisits involving potentially inappropriate psychotropic\nagents. By focusing on these agents and some of the pro-\nvider characteristics (eg, location) and patient features\n(eg, patient age), the greatest impact on potentially in-\nappropriate prescribing can be achieved.\nCorresponding author: Jane R.
