    "reduced_content": "Despite the many emotional and social benefits of sexual\nbehavior in relationships, there is also the threat of contract-\ning STDs, including HIV. Rates of heterosexual transmission\nof these diseases remain unacceptably high. The need for\nSTD prevention is especially great for nonresidential partners\n(unmarried and noncohabiting dating couples), who are less\nlikely than married or cohabiting couples to be monoga-\nmous and who may engage in riskier sexual behaviors.1\nMuch of what we know about sexual and contraceptive\nbehaviors as risk factors for STDs, as well as pregnancy,\nis based on women's or men's separate reports of their\nattitudes and behaviors. Relatively little research has been\nbased on reports obtained from both partners in a couple,\neven though sexual behavior is inherently dyadic. At most,\nstudies obtain proxy reports from one partner about the\nother partner's characteristics, behavior and attitudes. Here,\nwe address this limitation by using data from the National\nCouples Survey to examine how the self-reported charac-\nteristics, attitudes and behaviors of each partner are related\nto dating couples' sexual risk-taking. Specifically, we exam-\nine whether the couple had anal sex during the four weeks\nprior to the interview and whether they did anything dur-\ning that time to protect themselves from STDs.\nOur analyses advance prior research in two other impor-\ntant ways. First, we include measures of the respondent's\nand partner's prior sexual risk-taking behaviors and\nperceptions of AIDS risk and severity, to examine the ex-\ntent to which these framing events and perceptions are\nassociated with recent sexual risk-taking. Second, we\nexamine how relationship power, defined along several\ndimensions, and perceived level of control over sex and\ncontraception moderate, or condition, the associations be-\ntween respondent and partner characteristics and sexual\nand contraceptive behaviors.\nOne reason for the prior research focus on individuals'\nsexual and contraceptive behavior is the lack of couples\ndata. The few studies that have had couples data have\ntended to be based on small, purposive samples of mainly\nwhite, middle-class, married, college-age or young at-risk\nminority couples.2\u00ad6 Most studies have focused not on\nsexual behavior and sexual decision making, but on fer-\ntility behavior and intentions, and contraceptive use.7\u00ad15\nMore research now stresses the importance to STD risk\nof couples' relationship characteristics, such as length and\ntype of relationship,16,17 gender and power dynamics with-\nMost of these studies, however, have limited findings be-\ncause of the specific populations available for analysis. An\nCONTEXT: Knowledge of sexual and contraceptive behaviors as risk factors for STDs is largely based on women's or\nmen's separate reports of their attitudes and behaviors. Little research has been based on couples.\nMETHODS: Data from the 2005\u00ad2006 National Couples Survey were used to examine the sexual risk-taking behavior\nof 335 dating couples. Associations between each partner's characteristics and the couple's probability of recently\nhaving had anal sex and of having done something to protect themselves from STDs were assessed using logistic\nregression analyses. Models included measures of power dynamics and partners' perceptions of who controls sexual\nand contraceptive decisions.\nRESULTS: Couples in which the female partner reported that her male partner made the decisions about sex\nand contraception had increased probability of having had anal sex during the four weeks prior to the interview.\nIn addition, partners' relationship power and their perception of control over sex and contraception moderated\nassociations between couples' behavior and partners' characteristics, experiences and beliefs. For example, although\ncouples in which the male partners had known someone with AIDS were less likely than others to engage in anal sex,\nthat association was much greater for males with high income--and thus greater power--than for those with low\nincome.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sexual behaviors are not controlled by any one individual in a relationship; characteristics of each\npartner are important. Couples-based interventions that take into consideration relationship--especially power--\ndynamics may enable individuals to initiate and sustain safer-sex practices.\nBy John O. G.

First, most\nsexual behavior occurs within a close relationship and\ncannot be separated from that relationship.25,26 Research\nthat uses information from both partners can examine\nindividual and relationship variables that combine to de-\ntermine interdependent decision making.27,28 Second, re-\nlying on reports from only one partner forces one to draw\nconclusions about a couple's behavior on the basis of that\nperson's perspective, which can lead to a distortion of the\nindividual and joint characteristics of the partners that af-\nfect the couple's behavior.4,29\nThird, adopting a couples perspective allows exami-\nnation of the effects on sexual risk-taking of a range of\npotentially important factors, including power within the\nrelationship. In general terms, power refers to the relative\nability of one partner to act independently, to dominate\ndecision making, to engage in behavior against the other\npartner's wishes or to control a partner's actions.21 Power\nplays a role in determining what, when and how sexual\nand contraceptive behaviors take place.30 Despite the norm\nof egalitarianism in romantic relationships in the United\nStates, power imbalances occur.31 One source of power\ndifferences between partners is gender role ideology. Indi-\nviduals who have an egalitarian gender role orientation are\nmore likely than others to adopt traits and behaviors that\nare nontraditional for their gender.32,33 As such, they will\nhave more balanced dependencies in their relationships,\nand each partner's sexual preferences will have a similar\nlevel of influence in the decision making. In contrast, in a\ntraditional gender role orientation, the man's power may\nbe greater and decisions about sex may therefore be more\nstrongly influenced by his preferences.34,35 To our knowl-\nedge, no study has examined the gender role ideologies of\nboth partners and how these beliefs influence a couple's\nsexual risk-taking behavior.\nNor has gender role ideology been considered jointly\nwith other dimensions of power within the relationship.\nStructural power may arise from individual characteristics\nthat are linked to inequality in the larger social structure,\nsuch as education or income.2,21 Power also emerges from\ndifferences between partners in their level of commit-\nment to the relationship. The more highly committed a\npartner is, the more dependent, and thus less powerful\nin sexual decision making, he or she will be.36 Similarly,\nwhen individuals believe they have little trouble in attract-\ning potential partners, they will perceive more alternatives\nto their current partnership, be less dependent on it and\nthus have greater power.27 A final source of power are the\ncompliance-gaining strategies (e.g., manipulating, bully-\ning, distancing and bargaining) used by each partner when\nnegotiating decisions and wanting the other partner to do\nsomething he or she does not want to do.37\nIn this article, we examine how power weights the\ndecision-making process toward one partner or the other,\nby elevating or reducing the importance of a person's be-\nliefs or characteristics. Power differences between partners\nin gender role ideology and other dimensions of power\ncan also lead to differences in beliefs about level of control\nover sex and contraception. Hence, we also examine how\nthese beliefs moderate the impact of each partner's charac-\nteristics on the couple's sexual risk-taking behaviors.\nMETHODS\nData and Study Population\nOur data are from the dating couples sample of the\npartners of 335 dating heterosexual couples completed\ninterviews; dating was defined as currently being in an\nunmarried, noncohabiting sexual relationship of at least\none month's duration. Because the primary purpose of the\nsurvey was to provide information on couples' decisions\nabout contraception, females were eligible if aged 20\u00ad35\n(the ages during which most childbearing occurs), not\nsterile and not pregnant or trying to get pregnant; male\npartners had to be not sterile and 18 or older, so that both\npartners were adults and parental informed consent was\nnot necessary.\nComputer-assisted self-interviewing was used to collect\ndata from an area probability sample of household resi-\ndents in four cities (Baltimore; Durham, NC; St. Louis; and\nSeattle) and the U.S. census\u00addefined county subdivisions\nimmediately adjacent to them. These sites provide diverse\npopulations with respect to race, ethnicity, economic sta-\ntus and other factors associated with sexual and contra-\nceptive decision making. Within the four study sites, we\nstratified segments by the percentage of population who\nwere black and oversampled segments with high minor-\nity concentrations. This procedure yielded a large enough\nsample of couples in which one or both partners were\nblack to provide stable estimates of both their behaviors\nand the antecedents of those behaviors. Participants were\nrecruited through door-to-door visits from female inter-\nviewers; where possible, the race of the interviewer was\nmatched with that of the respondent.\nDuring the survey effort, 65% of households were suc-\ncessfully rostered (i.e., all adult residents were listed by age).\nTwenty-seven percent of rostered households had at least\none age-eligible person;* if a household contained more\nthan one age-eligible person, one was randomly selected\nfor eligibility screening on the other survey criteria. Eligi-\nbility screening was completed for 79% of selected poten-\ntial respondents. Those who were eligible for the study and\nwere defined as dating were asked to recruit their partners;\n77% of partners were screened, and 94% of eligible dating\n*Only 18\u00ad45-year-old males were included in the roster, because men\nof this age were the most likely to have age-eligible female partners.\nIf a female was selected for screening, there was no upper limit on her\npartner's age as a selection criterion.\n \n76 Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health\ncouples completed the survey. Partners were scheduled to\ntake the survey contemporaneously and were restricted\nfrom communicating about their answers. The question-\nnaires for males and females were nearly identical.\nAnalysis weights were constructed for each study site;\nthe sampling weights reflected the probability of selec-\ntion of each sampled address and of the couple sampled\nfrom that address, and were adjusted to account for non-\nresponse. The weights were then readjusted such that each\nsite impacted the analysis equally.\nMeasures\nOutcomes. We examined two couple behaviors that\nincrease a person's risk of STD infection. The first was\nwhether the couple had had anal intercourse during the\nfour weeks prior to the interview. Even though anal inter-\ncourse is generally recognized as being riskier than vaginal\nsex in terms of HIV transmission,38,39 it has received little\nresearch attention in heterosexual populations. The sec-\nond outcome concerned whether a respondent and his or\nher partner had decided to do anything in the last four\nweeks to protect themselves against STDs. We defined\na trichotomous measure with categories \"did nothing,\"\n\"used condom\" and \"engaged in less risky sex practices\"\n(i.e., decided not to have sex with other partners, to have\nfewer partners, to have sex with each other less often or\nnot to have certain kinds of sex that are \"more risky\").\nIndividual and couple characteristics. We considered the\nfollowing socioeconomic and demographic characteristics\nof both partners: age (in years), race and ethnicity (Hispanic,\nnon-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic other), completed\neducation (in years), personal income (logged) during the\nlast calendar year and religiosity (a dichotomy defined\nas not religious at all versus somewhat or very religious).\nAlso included were mother's education and father's educa-\ntion (less than high school graduate, high school graduate,\nsome college, college graduate and \"no man [woman] who\nmostly raised you\"). Finally, we included relationship dura-\ntion, measured as the number of months that the partners\nhad been \"seeing each other on a regular basis.\"\nMeasures for three personal framing events--behaviors\nor experiences that may affect an individual's subsequent\nSTD risk-taking behavior--were examined. Lifetime num-\nber of sex partners was a continuous measure, truncated\nat the point where the distribution became highly skewed.\nSTD infection prior to first sex with the current partner\nand ever having known someone with AIDS were dichoto-\nmous measures.\nWe measured perceptions of AIDS risk with variables\nrepresenting beliefs about the percentage chance a man\nwill get AIDS and the percentage chance a woman will\nget AIDS \"if they have intercourse only once without us-\ning any contraception with a partner who has AIDS or the\nvirus that causes AIDS.\" Perception of AIDS severity was a\nsummative scale based on respondents' level of agreement\n(1=\"very strongly disagree\" to 5=\"very strongly agree\")\nwith eight statements about how bad it would be to get\nAIDS (e.g., \"People who get AIDS always develop many\npainful symptoms\"). The higher the score, the greater the\nperceived severity.\nRelationship power and control. We included several\nmeasures of the underlying sources of relationship power.\nFirst were measures of structural power based on personal\neducation and income (defined above). Another power di-\nmension was relationship commitment, based on respons-\nes to the question \"Compared to your partner, who is more\ncommitted to making your relationship last?\" (1=\"definitely\nme\" to 5=\"definitely him/her\").36 Another power dimension\nwas relationship alternatives, based on responses to three\nquestions--e.g., \"If you broke up this month, how likely\nis it that you could find another partner better than him/\nher?\" (1=\"impossible\" to 4=\"certain\").40 These questions\nwere factor-analyzed, and we constructed a scale on which\na more positive score indicates more perceived alterna-\ntives. Traditional gender role ideology was measured using\nitems from the Sex Role Egalitarianism Scale.41 The eight\nitems in this summative scale asked how strongly respon-\ndents agreed with statements about the roles of husbands\nand wives: for example, \"A wife's career is less important\nthan her husband's\" (1=\"very strongly disagree\" to 5=\"very\nstrongly agree\"). The higher the score, the greater the tradi-\ntionalism. Finally, two variables captured the strategies the\nrespondent and his or her partner used to gain compliance\nfrom each other.37 Respondents were first asked how often\ntheir partner used six specific tactics (e.g., manipulation,\nbullying and distancing) to get what they want (1=\"never\"\nto 9=\"always\"). They were then asked about the tactics they\nused with their partner, using parallel questions and the\nsame response set. Responses were factor-analyzed, and we\nformed two scales, one reflecting the respondent's strategy\nand one reflecting the partner's strategy. The higher the\nvalue, the more often coercive tactics are used.\nControl over sex was measured using a summative scale\nbased on a set of questions asking for level of agreement\n(1=\"very strongly disagree\" to 5=\"very strongly agree\")\nwith 10 statements about the individual's perceived level\nof control over the sexual activity of the couple (e.g., \"I\noften take the initiative in beginning sexual activity\"). The\nhigher the score, the greater the control over sex. Similarly,\ncontrol over contraception was measured using a summa-\ntive scale based on level of agreement (1=\"very strongly\ndisagree\" to 5=\"very strongly agree\") with three statements\n(e.g., \"My partner makes most of the decisions about what\nbirth control the two of us will use\").42 A final composite\nmeasure of control over sex and contraception was based\non four questions on who usually makes the final deci-\nsion about \"when to have sex,\" \"what the two of you do\nwhen you have sex,\" \"whether you use birth control at\nany particular time when you have sex\" and \"what kind\nof birth control to use.\"43 Responses (1=\"I always decide\"\nto 5=\"he/she always decides\") were factor-analyzed, and\na scale of decisions about sex and contraception was cre-\nated. The higher the value, the greater the likelihood that\nthe respondent's partner makes the decisions.\nAnalytic Approach\nTo maintain the couple as the unit of analysis and to be\nable to assess the impact of each partner's characteristics\non the couple's sexual risk-taking behavior, we selected the\nfemale partner as the index respondent. We then examined\nhow her characteristics and reports and those of her male\npartner were related to her report of each outcome.\nMultivariate models of the dichotomous measure of anal\nsex were estimated using the logit procedure in STATA.\nModels of the trichotomous STD protective behaviors out-\ncome were estimated using the multinomial logit proce-\ndure. Although the level of nonresponse was low (less than\n5% for almost all items), selection bias because of missing\ndata may have affected our results. To deal with this is-\nsue, we employed multiple imputation procedures44,45 to\nestimate our models over the full sample of 335 dating\ncouples.\nFor each outcome, we first estimated a main effects\nmodel that included relationship duration as reported by\nthe female, both partners' social and demographic char-\nacteristics, their reports of framing events, and their per-\nceived risk and severity of AIDS. Next, we interacted each\nvariable in the main effects models with each power mea-\nsure, to determine how relationship power conditioned\nassociations between the independent variables and out-\ncomes. We then derived a final model that included the\nsignificant power interaction terms, which most succinctly\ndescribe how the multiple dimensions of power condition\nthe associations of the other variables with the outcome,\nas well as all the significant main effect terms. To maintain\na minimum level of social and demographic background\ncontrol, relationship duration and the female respondent's\nage and race and ethnicity were retained regardless of sig-\nnificance level.\nIn additional analyses, we repeated the same procedures,\nexcept testing for interactions between each partner's char-\nacteristics and his or her beliefs about his or her control\nover sex and contraception. Doing so allowed a compari-\nson with the model containing power interactions, to see\nhow similarly measures of relationship power and beliefs\nabout controlling sex and contraception are associated\nwith each risk-taking behavior.\nAlthough the coefficients in these models adequately\nconvey the direction of the effects and whether they are\nstatistically significant, they are difficult to interpret sub-\nstantively. Thus, we calculated predicted probabilities of\nthe extent to which a couple with a certain characteristic\nengaged in each risk-taking behavior.* For continuous\nmeasures, we calculated predicted probabilities for \"low\"\nTABLE 1.

Notes: SD=standard\ndeviation. For continuous measures, higher scores indicate respondents' greater perceived severity, lower\nperceived relationship commitment relative to their partners, greater perceived relationship alternatives,\nmore traditional gender role beliefs, more frequent use of coercive tactics and greater perceived likelihood\nthat their partners make the decisions about sex and contraception.\n*In performing these simulations, we gave each respondent her and\nher partner's own value on all of the characteristics included in the logit\nmodel, except on the characteristic of interest. For example, to get the\npredicted probability that a couple whose female partner is black, His-\npanic or of another race or ethnicity had had anal sex in the previous\nfour weeks, we gave all couples their actual values on all characteristics\nand beliefs, except race and ethnicity. We then calculated a predicted\nprobability from the parameter estimates in the model.\n \n78 Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health\nand \"high\" values, defined roughly as one standard devia-\ntion below and above the mean value of the measure.*\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Statistics\nTwenty-two percent of women and 27% of their male\npartners reported that they (the couple) had had anal sex\nin the prior four weeks (Table 1, page 77). Sixty-two per-\ncent of women reported that the couple had done noth-\ning in the prior four weeks to protect themselves from\nSTDs; 30% had used condoms, and 8% had decided\nto engage in less risky sex practices. The proportions\nreported by male partners were 61%, 32% and 7%, re-\nspectively, indicating, as with anal sex, some discrepancy\nin reporting. As noted above, the outcome measures in\nthe multivariate analyses reported here are based on the\nfemale partner's reports.\nThe average relationship duration was 34 months as re-\nported by the female partner and 35 months as reported\nby the male partner. The mean age of females was 27 and\nof males was 29. Nearly half of the couples were black, as\ndefined by either partner; the rest were mostly nonblack\nand non-Hispanic. On average, both women and men had\nhad 13 years of schooling; distributions with respect to\nparental education were similar. Males had a higher mean\npersonal income than females, and a greater proportion of\nmales than of females reported not being religious (48%\nThe mean lifetime number of sexual partners was 14\nfor women and 22 for men. Roughly one-fifth of males\nand females had had a STD; 44% of females and 51%\nof males had known someone with AIDS. On average,\nfemales perceived that men's and women's chances of get-\nting AIDS from an infected partner were 73% and 77%,\nrespectively; males perceived men's and women's risk\nat 63% and 72%. Females' perception of AIDS severity\nwas only slightly higher than males'. Females and males\nhad similar average commitment to making their rela-\ntionship last and perception of relationship alternatives.\nMales tended to report having a more traditional gen-\nder role ideology than females. On average, females were\nless likely than males to report that their partner uses\nmore coercive tactics to get what he wants; they were\nalso less likely than males to report that they use those\ntactics themselves. On average, females reported having\nmore control over sex and less control over contracep-\ntion than males; females were less likely than males to\nsay that their partner makes the decisions about sex and\ncontraception.\nAnal Sex\nThe probability that a couple had had anal sex in the prior\nfour weeks was not associated with relationship duration,\nthe female partner's age or her race and ethnicity (Table 2).\nThe probability of anal sex was significantly lower, how-\never, if the female partner perceived women's chance of\nacquiring AIDS from an infected partner to be 75% rather\nity of anal sex decreased with increased education of the\nmale partner's father (from 0.37 for men whose fathers had\nnot graduated from high school to 0.07 for men whose\nfathers had graduated from college), suggesting that anal\nsex is practiced by couples of lower socioeconomic origin.\nFurthermore, the probability of anal sex was higher if the\nTABLE 2.

Finally, among men who reported that their\npartners made the decisions about sex and contraception,\nmale's prior STD status had little effect; but when males\nreported making such decisions, prior STD infection was\nmarginally associated with a lower probability of taking\nno preventive measures and with a greater probability of\ndeciding to engage in less risky practices.\nUsing Male Reports of the Outcomes--Does It Matter?\nAs in any couples survey, partners' reporting of the out-\ncomes examined disagreed somewhat. To determine\nwhether we would have come to the same conclusions if\nwe had used the males' reports of the outcomes instead\nof the females',* we estimated models corresponding to\nthose presented in Tables 2\u00ad5 that included both men and\nwomen in individual-level models, used their respective\nreports of each outcome and adjusted the standard errors\nfor clustering at the couple level. We then added a main\neffects term indicating the respondent's gender, along with\ninteraction terms of gender with every other variable.\nWe then assessed whether the introduction of these vari-\nables significantly improved the fit of the model without\nthe gender main effect and interaction terms. This pro-\ncedure is equivalent to estimating separate models using\nthe female's and male's reports of each outcome and then\ncomparing the results, but has the advantage of provid-\ning information about whether any differences by gender\nin the relationships of personal and partner characteristics\nwith the outcome are statistically significant.\nWe found no improvement in the overall fit of the mod-\nels after taking respondent gender into account. Further-\nmore, the gender main effect term was never significant,\nand only a few of the gender interaction terms were sig-\nnificant in any model. Thus, overall, our results were rela-\ntively unaffected by using female reports of the outcomes.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results show that a couple's sexual behaviors are not\ncontrolled totally by either partner. Therefore, relying\nsolely on women's or men's reports would miss important\npartner influences, and proxy reports might be inaccurate\nenough to distort the partner's influence.\nSeveral of each partner's characteristics are significantly\nrelated to the couple's sexual risk-taking. Importantly,\npartners' power and perception of control over sex and\ncontraception are significant moderators of some of\nfemales' and males' characteristics, experiences and beliefs.\nIndeed, without taking relationship power into account,\nwe would miss the importance of knowledge of someone\nwith AIDS, prior STD and perception of AIDS severity, for\nexample, which are related to sexual risk-taking only if\na certain partner has enough relationship power to influ-\nence the sexual situation.\nWe find that couples of lower socioeconomic status, as\nmeasured by the male partner's own and his father's edu-\ncation, have an elevated probability of having engaged in\nanal sex in the last four weeks. Some previous research\nsuggests that increased socioeconomic status is associated\nwith increased willingness to engage in a variety of non-\ntraditional sexual activities, including nonvaginal sex.46,47\nTypically, such findings have pertained to ever having ex-\nperienced anal sex. Individuals of higher socioeconomic\nstatus may be more likely than others to experiment with\n*Differences in reports of the outcome by females and males are the only\nthing that can change the results,because all of our models contain pre-\ndictor variables based on each partner's reports.\nFull results of these analyses are available from the authors.\nTABLE 5.

Power of one partner or the other and perceived control\nover sex and contraception are also important. Anal sex is\nnegatively related to the female's perception of AIDS severity\nonly when the female has more control over sex. Further, a\nmale's greater perception of AIDS risk and his having known\nsomeone with AIDS are most strongly related to anal sex\nwhen he has more power or has more control over sex.\nThe gender role ideology of the male partner is very\nstrongly related to whether the couple has anal sex; cou-\nples in which the male has a more traditional gender role\nideology have a higher probability of engaging in this be-\nhavior. Males overall may have a stronger preference for\nanal sex than females, as evidenced by females' reports\nthat they are more likely to have anal sex when their part-\nner decides about sex and contraception.\nIncreased lifetime number of sex partners reported by\nfemales is associated with increased probability that the\ncouple has decided to engage in less risky sex practices.\nThis suggests that a woman who has had many partners\nbetter understands that she and her current partner may\nbe at increased risk of STD infection because of her history.\nHigher male education and income are associated with a\ncouple's increased probability of doing nothing to protect\nagainst STDs and reduced probability of deciding to engage\nin less risky sex practices, suggesting a lower perceived risk\nof infection among those of higher socioeconomic status.\nWomen of different races and ethnicities may use their\nrelationship power differently. Hispanics and other women\nwho have more egalitarian gender role ideology may give\ntheir partners more say in regard to condom use, and their\npartners may opt not to use condoms because condoms in-\nterfere with sexual pleasure.48 Black women who have less\ntraditional gender role ideology, however, may be more in-\nsistent about condom use; greater use among blacks is con-\nsistent with the literature.49 A standard interpretation is that\nblacks perceive themselves as having a higher risk of STDs\nthan whites because they have a higher disease prevalence.\nOur findings may help inform new couples-based pre-\nvention interventions, to more effectively fight STD trans-\nmission. Most STD prevention messages direct little atten-\ntion toward the relationship status of sex partners and the\nneed to promote safer sex within affectionate rather than\nImportantly, although using condoms and being monog-\namous certainly reduce the incidence of new infections,\npublic health efforts have largely underestimated the dif-\nficulty people have in following these recommendations.\nIndividuals, especially women, may find it difficult to\nintroduce or sustain safer-sex practices because of partners'\nnegative reactions, such as terminating the relationship or\nengaging in intimate partner violence.52 In addition, inter-\nventions that expect participants to share new knowledge\nwith their sexual partner assume that they have the neces-\nsary communication skills.51 Individuals may be unable to\npractice safer-sex behavior with their partner because of\nfactors such as gender role expectations or power imbal-\nances in the relationship.\nCouples-based interventions that take into consideration\nrelationship, especially power, dynamics may enable indi-\nviduals to initiate and sustain safer-sex practices. Several\nSTD prevention interventions for heterosexual couples\nhave been efficacious in reducing risky sexual behavior\nand increasing safer sex practices.52\u00ad54 Furthermore, they\nshow that it is feasible to recruit for and conduct couples-\nbased STD prevention interventions. Couples-based inter-\nventions further grounded in research that accounts for\nthe many relationship influences forming the context for\nhuman sexual behavior and attitudes may help redress the\ncontinuing problem of STD infection in the United States.\nREFERENCES\n1.
