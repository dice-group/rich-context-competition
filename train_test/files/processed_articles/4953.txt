There are sparse data on the long-term\noutcome, especially in elderly patients. We studied whether elderly patients benefit to the\nsame extent compared with younger patients and at long-term follow up as compared with the\ngeneral population.\nMethods: Between 2001 and 2010, data from all patients presented to our hospital after\nOHCA were recorded. Elderly patients (75 years) were compared with younger patients.\nNeurological outcome was classified as cerebral performance category (CPC) at hospital\ndischarge and long-term survival was compared with younger patients and predicted survival\nrates of the general population.\nResults: Of the 810 patients admitted after OHCA, a total of 551 patients (68%) achieved return\nof spontaneous circulation, including 125 (23%) elderly patients with a mean age of 81 \u00b1 5\nyears. In-hospital survival was lower in elderly patients compared with younger patients with\nversus 86% of the younger patients (p = 0.031). In 7.3% of the elderly patients, a CPC >2 was\nobserved versus 2.5% of their younger counterparts (p = 0.103). Elderly patients had a median\nyears of the general population (p = 0.019).\nConclusions: The survival rate after OHCA in elderly patients is approximately half that\nof younger patients. Elderly patients who survive to discharge frequently have favorable\nneurological outcomes and a long-term survival that approximates that of the general\npopulation.\n",

A driver with a paramedical back-\nground and a nurse staff each ambulance, and\nboth are trained and qualified to perform\nAdvanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) accord-\ning to the European Resuscitation Council guide-\nlines, such as advanced airway interventions,\nadministration of inotropic drugs and use of a\ndefibrillator.27 In case of resuscitation, a backup\nambulance is always sent. The nurse staff always\ncommences CPR but has the discretion to dis-\ncontinue if the patient has a `do not attempt CPR'\ndecision or a nonshockable rhythm present for\nmore than 20 minutes. Except for these patients,\nall other OHCAs including EMS-witnessed\narrests are transported to our center where resus-\ncitation is continued or postresuscitation care is\ngiven following ACLS guidelines.27 When patients\npresent with an ST-segment elevation myocardial\ninfarction (STEMI) after OHCA we perform per-\ncutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients\nwith return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC),\nincluding elderly patients.28 Patients requiring\ncontinuous mechanical ventilation were trans-\nferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postre-\nsuscitation care. Treatment was left at the\ndiscretion of the attending physicians. If brain-\nstem reflexes (i.e. absent pupillary light response\nand corneal reflexes) and motor scores were\nabsent, no further life-sustaining treatment was\ndelivered. In all other cases, additional soma-\ntosensory-evoked-potential (SSEP) monitoring\nwas done and in the case of absent bilateral nega-\ntive 20 (N20) SSEPs, active treatment was also\nwithdrawn. Electroencephalography (EEG) anal-\nysis was performed when seizures or myoclonus\nwas present. Seizures were treated with antiepi-\nleptic drugs; in the case of myoclonus status epilep-\nticus, treatment was also stopped.29,30 In these\npatients, active therapies were discontinued, and\ntreatment was altered to comfort care. The insti-\ntutional review board [Medisch Ethische\nToetsingscommissie (METc) of the UMCG]\napproved the study and waived the need for\ninformed consent due to the observational nature\nPatients\nWe studied all adult ( 18 years) patients who\nwere transferred to our hospital after OHCA dur-\nrospectively from the medical records of the\nAmbulance System. During the study period,\nmild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) was initi-\nated if patients had a Glasgow Coma Score < 8.\nand thereafter, passively rewarmed to 36\u00b0C.\nIn this cohort, we defined patients with an age of\n 75 years as elderly and used the younger patients\nfor comparison of outcomes in both categories.\nData on prehospital characteristics, medical his-\ntory, electrocardiography (ECG), SSEP, EEG\nand laboratory values were gathered from the\nhospital information system. Neurological status\nwas classified using the cerebral performance cat-\negory (CPC) from the clinical patient notes made\nduring outpatient follow-up assessments by cardi-\nologists, rehabilitation specialists or, when indi-\ncated, neurologists. Survival status of patients\ndischarged alive was obtained from the municipal\nwith a maximum follow up of 16.4 years.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous data are presented as either means \u00b1\nstandard deviation for normally distributed varia-\nbles or medians and interquartile ranges for\nskewed data, or as group percentages with 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI) for categorical variables.\nWe determined outcome in subgroups dependent\non initial rhythm [ventricular fibrillation (VF) ver-\nsus no-VF] and implemented treatment (PCI ver-\nsus no PCI, MTH versus no MTH). We recorded\nage, sex and known factors associated with out-\ncome: initial rhythm and in-hospital treatment\n(PCI and MTH) and left ventricular function.\nB Hiemstra, R Bergman et al.\nhttp://tac.sagepub.com 3\nStatistical analysis was performed using the chi-\nsquare test for categorical and the Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U test or Student's t test for skewed\ncontinuous and normally distributed variables,\nrespectively. Kaplan\u00adMeier survival analysis was\nused to assess long-term survival and the log-\nrank test was used to compare survival across\nsubgroups. For each OHCA patient, the actual\nsurvival was compared with the predicted sur-\nvival rates of the general population standard-\nized for age, sex and calendar year. These\npredicted survival rates were obtained from the\nDutch Census Bureau, which predicts general\npopulation survival annually.31 We identified\nindependent predictors of in-hospital mortality,\ncoronary angiography (CAG), PCI and MTH\nusing multivariable logistic regression analyses.\nUnivariable analyses were conducted on all\nknown predictors for mortality, which were\nadded without any transformation. A p < 0.25\nwas used for inclusion in the multivariable\nmodel. Calibration of the multivariable models\nwas checked with Hosmer\u00adLemeshow tests and\nby plotting observed proportions against the\npredicted risks of 10 equally sized groups. We\nused complete-case analyses because all variables\nin our multivariable models had fewer than 5%\nmissing values.32 Statistical significance was\ndefined as a two-sided p value of < 0.05.

The major\ncause of death was neurological damage that was\ndeemed not compatible with survival. Other\nimportant causes of death were secondary circu-\nlatory failure and multiorgan failure (Table 2). Of\nthe 35 patients with a known malignancy, only\none survived until end of follow up (p = 0.003).\nDiscussion\nFrom the long-term follow up of a cohort of 810\npatients after OHCA, two main observations\nemerged. First, despite similar percentages of\npatients regaining spontaneous circulation, in-\nhospital mortality was considerably higher in\nelderly compared with younger patients. Second,\nwe add to the current literature, that elderly\npatients who were discharged alive had a median\nsurvival of 6.5 years compared with 7.7 years in\nmatched controls in the general population.\nMoreover, in these elderly patients, the neuro-\nlogical outcome was good in a high percentage of\npatients, with less than 10% with a poor neuro-\nlogical outcome.\nOur findings confirm that elderly patients have\nworse outcomes than younger patients: Funada\ndescribed worse outcomes of elderly patients after\n> 65 years),14 Sulzgruber and colleagues (n =\npatients Wong and colleagues showed in 2014\nthat over time, the survival of the elderly at 1 year\nhas increased.36 The favorable outcome trend for\nfunctional outcome reflected by good CPC scores\nat 1 month was recently shown in large Japanese\nshowed worse survival and equally favorable\nfunctional outcome in survivors compared with\n1-year survival in patients discharged alive was\n88% and neurologic outcome, as defined by a\nCPC of 1 or 2, was good in 90% of patients.\nWinther-Jensen and colleagues showed that 70%\nof the very elderly patients (i.e.  80 years) had\nCPC scores of 1 or 2 at 30-day follow up, which\nis comparable with the observed 70% elderly with\na CPC score of 1 in our cohort.17 Studies are\nunanimous on the worse short-term outcome of\nelderly after OHCA, but we observe that healthy\naging among the survivors seems possible.\nIn our study, several factors were associated with\nboth mortality and unfavorable neurological out-\ncome. In line with observations of others, the\nelderly have a higher cardiovascular risk profile and\nmore comorbidities.39\u00ad41 We also observed a higher\nincidence of an initial rhythm other than VF, which\nis associated with a poor outcome, in the elderly\npatients.42 Similar to Sulzgruber and colleagues,\nthe initial rhythm and other known prognostic fac-\ntors such as witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, arte-\nrial glucose, base excess and lactate levels were not\nassociated with outcome in the elderly.15 More\ndata are needed to identify early prognostic varia-\nbles, as other cohort studies did find associations\nCompared with other studies, the incidence of\nROSC in the elderly in our population was high\nand almost equal to younger patients.47,48 A selec-\ntion bias could be present as referral to our hospi-\ntal may have been considered futile in patients\nwith very poor early prognostic variables or a non-\nshockable rhythm present for more than 20 min-\nutes. Like in the study of Winther-Jensen and\ncolleagues, CAG and PCI were employed less\nfrequently in the elderly patients.17 Our data show\nthat in elderly patients, OHCA less frequently has\nan acute cardiac origin. Elderly patients less often\nsuffer from a myocardial infarction, initial rhythm\nof VF and have lower cardiac biomarkers. Also,\nthe higher incidence of previous myocardial\ninfarction in the elderly might underlie secondary\nrhythm disturbances that cause OHCA. The dif-\nferent underlying pathology makes them less suit-\nreason could be that elderly patients tend to\nreceive a less aggressive diagnostic work up com-\nemployed equally in both groups in our cohort.\nTreatment decisions can be particularly difficult\nfor clinicians caring for elderly patients. CPR for\nCPR in the elderly is a decision that is affected by\nsometimes conflicting opinions for what is best\nfor the patient, and these opinions may vary from\ncountry to country. It involves not only medical,\nbut also ethical decisions, especially when there\nare important associated comorbidities that\ndirectly affect the patient's prognosis.21 As shown\nTherapeutic Advances in Cardiovascular Disease 00(0)\n10 http://tac.sagepub.com\nin our study, the incidence of malignancies is sig-\nnificantly higher in the elderly. Since long-term\nsurvival of elderly hospital survivors is reasonable\nwith a median survival of 6.5 years, our data thus\ndo not support the withholding of resuscitation\nbased on age only.16\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, it was per-\nformed retrospectively on data of patients admitted\nto our hospital. Detailed data are lacking on the\npersonwhowitnessedthearrest(EMSorbystander)\nand time frames of initial treatment, such as time to\nCPR, ACLS and ROSC for instance. Second, not\nall treatment was standardized; various potential\nsources of unidentified bias such as confounding by\nindication in the care of older and younger patients\nmay be present. However, highlighting this poten-\ntial bias is also an important finding in this study.\nFinally, these results only relate to patients present-\ning to the emergency unit of a single center. This\nlimits the external validity of our findings. Some\npatients who were resuscitated during the study\nperiod in our region may not have been referred to\nour hospital, since PCI was not deemed necessary\nfor some patients. This may explain differences in\nour patient population in comparison with other\nstudies.10,56 As such, the outcome data we present\ndo not pertain to the total population of patients\nsuffering OHCA in our region.\nConclusion\nDespite similar rates of ROSC after OHCA in\nelderly and younger patients, hospital survival for\nelderly patients was approximately half that of\nyounger patients. However, the majority of elderly\npatients who survived initial treatment had a CPC\nscore of 1 and a lifespan that approximates that of\nthe general population.\n"
