The main character has been diagnosed\nas everything from a schizophrenic, to an autistic, from a\nperson with borderline personality disorder to one with\nAsperger's syndrome. He has been described as a melan-\ncholic, a schizoid, a Job/Christ figure, a passive aggressive,\nan alienated worker, and an innocent victim, as well as an\nindividual manifesting \"pure potentiality . . . someone whose\nactions we ourselves should strive for\" (Giles, 2007, p. 88).\nHe has likewise been viewed as a symbol for Melville who,\nlike his famous character, alienated himself from society by\npreferring not to copy the formula for the kinds of popular\nworks that dominated the literary market of his day. All of\nthese critics admit, however, that Bartleby, inspiring or not,\nis \"the most provoking test of brotherhood one is ever likely\nto encounter either in fiction or in life,\" an individual whose\n\"power to exasperate is the kind that inspires legends\"\nhas likewise been the subject of a similar number of varied\ncritical perspectives. Thus, he has been described as self-\nserving in some articles, but well-meaning in others. He has\nbeen characterized as everything from psychotic to comical,\nfrom being nihilistic and devoid of social conscience to being\nChristlike. It is no wonder that Lewis Leary (1979) observed\nyears ago that \"no one key opens [the story] to a simple, or\nsingle, precise meaning\" (p. 15). Indeed, like few other\nworks of fiction, Melville's \"Bartleby the Scrivener\" seems\nto draw critics--of all persuasions--like a magnet. Perhaps\nthis is because, as Milton Stern (1979) has observed, \"The\nstory offers numerous `ideological possibilities' and thus the\nseer of psychiatric, political, literary, metaphysical or reli-\ngious positions is sure to find in the tale a paradigm for his\nown advocacy\" (p. 19).\nA view of the story that heretofore has not received any\ncritical attention is one that applies the methodology of social\nscience to literary analysis by focusing on the narrative's\noffice setting as a site of social organization. As members\ninhabiting a specific cultural space, the narrator and his\nemployees operate, as the sociologist Dorothy Smith (1990)\nhas described it, within a framework of shared understand-\nings and an organized sequence of actions that are \"constitu-\ntive of the formality of a formal organization\" (p. 219).\nWithin this organization, they adopt protocols and patterns in\ntheir social relationships, which facilitate the functioning\nthat is integral to the organization's day-to-day operation.\nFraming the narrative within this perspective opens up new\n1Carroll University, Waukesha, WI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLori Duin Kelly, Carroll University, 100 N.

By\nrelying on peoples' actual experiences inside these organiza-\ntions, institutional ethnographers are able to demonstrate not\nonly how these institutions come to adopt specific organiza-\ntional patterns as essential to their functioning, but also how,\nas a consequence of that functioning, interpersonal and hier-\narchical relationships within these organizations are deter-\nmined and constituted. Because a reliance on individuals'\nactual experiences is central to its methodology, institutional\nethnography also provides a method for identifying and eval-\nuating linguistic markers that are helpful for understanding\nan individual's positioning within these structures. This\nmethod of analysis seems especially relevant to understand-\ning the interpersonal office dynamics at work in Melville's\nshort story, as it provides a workable methodology with\nwhich to explore issues like organizational communication,\nas well as the nature of work roles and relations among a\nspecific group of individuals. It also provides a way to track\nchanging patterns of behavior inside of an organization and\nthe way these changing behavioral patterns come to be\nreflected in hierarchies and language patterns inside of an\norganizational space.\nOverview of the Organization of the\nMaster of Chancery Office\nThe Office of the Master of Chancery in Melville's story has\none manager, a lawyer, who also functions as the omniscient\nnarrator of the story, and two employees with very distinct\nwork pathologies: an older worker, Turkey, who is most pro-\nductive in the early morning hours and less so as the noon\nhour approaches and his younger counterpart, the ambitious\nbut frustrated Nippers, who pushes the work forward when\nTurkey begins to falter. A third employee, Ginger Nut, func-\ntions mainly as an errand boy for the operation. The prevail-\ning personality trait of the lawyer who heads up the operation\nis caution. His preferred strategy for dealing with his employ-\nees appears to be an extraordinary willingness to order the\nway work is performed within the organization in a way that\naccommodates their eccentricities. It is obvious from what\nthe narrator reveals that this style of management has worked\nwell for him. His is, by the standards of 19th-century business\npractice, a successful operation. This is apparent when he dis-\ncloses that his work \"among rich men's bonds, and mort-\ndrawn the attention of no less a personage than John Jacob\nAstor who had \"no hesitation in pronouncing my first great\npoint to be prudence, my next, method\" (Melville, 1853a, p.\n547). It is worth noting here that the values Astor endorses, at\nleast as reported by the narrator, are ones associated with cau-\ntion and practicality in problem solving. As the narrator notes\nthat Astor himself is not prone to \"poetic enthusiasm\"\nextent to which Astor endorses individuals who display simi-\nlar personality traits to his own. At any rate, what is evident is\nthat Astor's endorsement of him has contributed in no small\nway to the success of the narrator's reputation. Appointment\nto the Master of Chancery office suggests that how the lawyer\noperates has won him the attention of those in a position to\nappoint him to a rather lucrative post. It also suggests that the\nlawyer has demonstrated an ability for organizing the work of\nthat office in a way that has been recognized and validated by\nprominent individuals within the larger work community.\nBartleby's hire is a result of the subsequent increase in work\nthat follows on that appointment. As neither of his current\nemployees puts in a full day's work, the narrator is drawn to\nBartleby because he anticipates that he will have a positive\nimpact on the personalities of the other employees in the\norganization. Describing Bartleby as \"a man of so singularly\nipates that his will be a calming presence that has the potential\nto \"operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey\nlong term, this amelioration of Turkey and Nipper's behav-\niors is a practical move that will contribute to their greater\nefficiency and as a consequence, to even greater productivity\nwithin the organization.\nHow Bartleby Functions Within This\nOrganization's Structures\nImpact on Workplace Product and Process\nAt first, the narrator's decision to hire Bartleby appears to be\na sound one. Consistent with the organization's role of pro-\nviding a steady delivery of product in a timely manner, the\nlawyer's hire seems to fit well into the organization's exist-\ning structure. As a copyist, Bartleby generates an extraordi-\nnary quantity of writing in a neat clear hand. He is the first\none in the office every morning and the last one to leave it\nevery night. The problem comes when Bartleby declines or\nmore accurately prefers not to discharge what the narrator\ncalls \"an indispensable part of a scrivener's business\"\ncopies. The practice of reading copies to check for errors is\nconstitutive. It directs social relations in the workplace, orga-\nnizes and facilitates their functioning because it is integral to\nthe successful discharge of the work performed there. As a\nstep in the organizational process, reading copies for accu-\nracy is an example of what Smith (1990) calls the \"appara-\ntus\" (p. 212) essential to the functioning of this specific\noperation as it coordinates the work process in ways that\ncontribute to productivity and insure quality control. Indeed,\nso essential is checking documents to the nature of the opera-\ntion that from time to time, the lawyer, in a symbolic show of\ncamaraderie with this shared task, decenters himself from the\nrole of manager to participate in it. By stating that he would\nprefer not to check copy, Bartleby derails this essential pro-\ncess. The narrator's characterization of his request as \"com-\nsuggests a normative stance of acquiescence within the orga-\nnization to this request. Thus, Bartleby's preference not to\nread copy identifies him as requesting an accommodation for\nwhich there is no precedent. Moreover, Bartleby's request to\nbe treated in a singularly unique way generates a profound\nconcern because with the increased workload, refusal to\ncomply with this normative practice has the potential to\nderail the smooth functioning of the lawyer's operation.\nImpact on the Other Employees\nIn addition to presenting a major challenge to the process\nand, ultimately, generation of product that is central to the\nlivelihood of the Chancery operation, another impact\nBartleby has in this workplace is on the other employees,\nNippers, Turkey, and Ginger Nut. It is apparent that the\nsenior clerks already manifest forms of hysteria \"in line with\nthe hypothesis of a pathogenic environment\" (Mander, 2005,\np. 220), long before Bartleby arrives on the scene: Turkey is\nan alcoholic and Nippers manifests recurrent stomach prob-\nlems in response to what appear to be extraordinary stress\nlevels. Bartleby's incomprehensible actions are of a magni-\ntude that has the potential to dissolve the smooth functioning\nof an operation that supplies them with a living while it has a\nproven history of successfully accommodating their idiosyn-\ncrasies. Even though accommodating the eccentricities of his\nemployees is central to how the manager has structured work\nassignments inside his operation, efforts to accommodate a\ngrowing list of preferences from Bartleby contribute to unan-\nticipated problems in the workplace. For one thing, accom-\nmodating Bartleby forces the lawyer to reassign Bartleby's\nworkload to his other employees, and in so doing, implement\na dramatic change in the routine of office duties. However, at\nno point along the way does the lawyer draw his other\nemployees into the decision by providing them with a con-\ntext and timeline for his action. He could, for example, sug-\ngest that the recusal of Bartleby from copying is temporary,\na move to accommodate the eyestrain suffered by overwork\nsustained in his early days on the job. Moreover, by dispens-\ning with the requirement that Bartleby share in the process of\nreading copy, the lawyer restructures the nature of how work\nis performed--and assigned--inside his operation.\nPredictably, the reactions of the other employees are over-\nwhelmingly negative. They range from expressions of frus-\ntration to threats of violence. In spite of the fact that Turkey\nand Nippers have received generous accommodations in the\nworkplace, neither employee supports the assignment of any\nworkplace accommodation to Bartleby. More importantly,\ntheir discontent with the lawyer's willingness to do so threat-\nens the smooth functioning that the lawyer strives to main-\ntain in his operation. Fueling their concerns is what scholars\nin business identify as a perception of inherent unfairness:\nBartleby, the newest hire, is given different treatment at work\nfrom other employees who have longer standing with the\ncompany. As a result of their perception of such treatment of\nBartleby as being exceptional, these employees begin to\nmanifest what Adrienne Colella (2001) has described as spe-\ncific attitudinal and behavioral reactions stemming from\ntheir sense of inherent unfairness. Nippers, for example, is\ncandid in voicing his displeasure about being forced to \"do\nanother man's business without pay\" (Melville, 1853a, p.\n551). For him, the solution to Bartleby's dysfunction is sim-\nThis is a solution that not only removes the impediment to\nthe office's heretofore smooth functioning, but is also reflec-\ntive of a sanctioned response to unproductive employees in\nthe larger work culture that exists outside this office. Indeed,\nas the manager hangs fire and continues to debate how he\nshould proceed, the hostility of Nippers and Turkey to\nBartleby escalates and on a couple of occasions, rises to the\nlevel of violence, with Nippers \"grind[ing] out between his\nset teeth occasional hissing maledictions against the stub-\nTurkey threatening to \"step behind [Bartleby's] screen and\ning hostility of his employees to Bartleby contributes to a\ngreater urgency of a response from the lawyer who manages\nthe Chancery operation. In effect, the negative behaviors his\nemployees manifest have the potential to disrupt employee\ncommitment to the organization which, in turn, would have a\nnegative impact on overall performance and productivity.\nImpact on the Manager\nAs the situation in the office escalates, the lawyer who runs it\nbecomes increasingly dysfunctional when it comes to incor-\nporating Bartleby into his organization. Temperamentally, the\nlawyer is conflict avoidant. This is perhaps why he has cho-\nsen to focus exclusively on reproducing accurate copies of\nlegal documents, thereby avoiding the \"turbulence\" (Mitchell,\ntrial lawyer. Before the arrival of Bartleby on the scene, the\nlawyer, whom some critics view as being a man of limited\ncomprehension, has been able to rationalize his solutions to\ntolerating both the disorder of his office and the eccentricities\nof his employees by making rather extraordinary concessions\n4 SAGE Open\nto his two primary workers. The most notable of these con-\ncessions is his willingness to let them put in half days of work\nfor a full day's pay. He also has set a precedent with them of\nexcusing careless errors that have the potential to imperil the\nprofessional reputation of his office. One example of this is\nhis willingness to back down from a decision to fire Turkey\nfor mistakenly putting a ginger wafer in place of a seal onto a\nlegal document. However, these concessions have taken place\nin secret, hidden from the eyes of colleagues and clients.\nMoreover, they are obscured by the fact that his office does,\nin spite of its inherent pathologies, get the work done both\nwell and expeditiously. However, as Bartleby, and in particu-\nlar, his growing list of \"preferences\" for what he will and will\nnot do expands, the manager is confronted with a new prob-\nlem: how to contain the growing resentment of his long-term\nemployees who see their employer's efforts to accommodate\nBartleby as extreme and unreasonable. While it is clear that\nhe has gone to extreme lengths in accommodating Turkey and\nNippers, it is also clear that his concessions to Bartleby have\nactually engendered new problems within his organization. In\naddition, his employees' responses to how he has proceeded\nwith Bartleby have complicated his own understanding of\nwhat constitutes reasonable limits for one of his favorite man-\nagement strategies. This is apparent in the lawyer's admission\nthat with Bartleby, he is offering \"privileges and unheard of\nacknowledges, of \"that wondrous ascendancy which the\nUltimately, however, even the process of creative accommo-\ndation that has worked for him so well in the past is inade-\nquate for dealing with Bartleby. Under no pretense can he\nkeep an employee who, as things escalate, prefers not to do\nwork of any kind and who will not take another job anywhere\nelse. Bartleby's presence in his office, where, ultimately, he\nextends his preferences of not complying to requests made by\nother residents in the building, imperils the lawyer's opera-\ntion because it renders visible an employment conundrum\nthat the lawyer as the manager of this specific operation has\nbeen unable to resolve. His inability to act decisively with\nBartleby highlights his failure as a manager and throws into\nquestion the viability of the entire operation.\nImpact on Workplace Discourse\nThe assigned roles and responsibilities characteristic of an\norganization are manifest in the discourse that is employed\nthere, and it is in insisting on consistently functioning out-\nside those discursive parameters that Bartleby presents the\ngreatest challenge to the organization. Workplace discourse\nreplicates organizational work practices and hierarchies.\nFrom an ethnographic perspective, ready compliance with\nthe language practices in a workplace reveals the extent to\nwhich employees are both trained in and accustomed to\nspeak within the discourse of their ruling institution.\nEvaluating how an employee mediates these discursive\nstructures lends insight into how effectively they fit into the\norganization's existing structures and hierarchies.\nThe other employees and workplace discourse.Turkey, Nip-\npers, and to a lesser extent, the office errand boy, Ginger Nut,\nconsistently function within the discursive parameters that\norganize operations within the Office of the Chancery. When\nasked to, these employees participate unquestioningly in\nwhat their employer has described as the \"common usages\"\nof the office, the most important of which is checking legal\ncopies for accuracy. The reiteration of the phrase \"common\nusages\"--it appears three times in the story--underscores its\nimportance as a linguistic marker in the discourse of the law-\nyer's operation. In addition, the use of the word \"common\"\nsuggests the extent to which this feature of the workplace is\nseen as natural and normative,\nas the way things are done and in some odd way as the only\nway they could be done, rather than as planned procedures and\nrules developed by individuals ensuring certain ideological\nways of interpreting and acting on a case. (DeVault & McCoy,\nThe lawyer's deployment of this term \"common usages\"\nserves an additional purpose when he is talking directly to\nBartleby. It not only reinscribes his identity as a member of\nthe legal system, but also suggests he is operating with care\nand deliberation when it comes to his newest employee, lay-\ning out the terms of understanding of the requirements of the\njob of scrivener, perhaps, as John Stark (1979) has suggested,\n\"as though he were protecting himself from legal liability\" (p.\n169). At the same time, the repetition of these terms in con-\nversations with Bartleby functions as a means of introducing\nhim to the narrative terms of the official discourse that guides\noperations within the office that now employs him.\nSo embedded are the other employees in the Chancery\noffice's work structures that when the lawyer turns to them\nfor validation that his request to Bartleby to check copies for\naccuracy is a reasonable one, they form what Foucault (1978)\nhas described as a \"moving substrate of force relations\" (p.\n93). Activated in response to a specific situation and repro-\nduced within the discursive structures that inform their\nunderstanding of how the organization functions, employer\nand employees converge to form a line of force that at that\nspecific moment unites them in their opposition to what they\nperceive as imperiling their shared operation. Employee\ncharacterizations of Bartleby's actions as \"quite out of the\nidentical to those of the lawyer, evidence of the extent to\nwhich their understanding of what is occurring inside the\noffice is actually mediated through his. This critical view of\nBartleby along with their unquestioning accession to what-\never the lawyer asks them to do manifest what Liza McCoy\n(2006) has characterized as a form of \"intellectual vassalage\"\n(p. 122). Accustomed to speaking and thinking within its rul-\ning discourse, the employees in the Office of the Chancery\nnot only share the lawyer's frustration with Bartleby's pref-\nerence for what he will and will not do; their statements\nabout Bartleby's actions align them with his view of the way\nwork inside this office traditionally has been organized and is\nto be performed. In advocating for Bartleby's termination\nand dismissal from the firm, these employees likewise reveal\ntheir endorsement and acceptance of standard employment\npractice within the larger work community.\nWorkplace discourse and the manager. Gilles Deleuze (1998)\nhas noted that by stating that he would prefer not to acqui-\nesce to the lawyer's varied requests, Bartleby presents a chal-\nlenge to how work is done because his response contributes\na \"new logic, a logic of preference\" (p. 73) to the discourse\nof the workplace. As Deleuze (1998) describes it, the for-\nmula \"I would prefer not to\" creates a new exclusionary, one\nthat distances itself from everyone and everything in the\noffice. The lawyer's hope of bringing Bartleby back into\ncompliance with how his organization has and must operate\nrests\non a logic of presuppositions according to which [he] . . .\n\"expects\" to be obeyed or . . . listened to, whereas Bartleby has\ninvented a new logic, a logic of preference which is enough to\nundermine the presuppositions as a whole. (Deleuze, 1998, p. 73)\nIndeed, his consistent response to the various requests posed\nto him by the lawyer that he would \"prefer not to\" constitutes\na language that is both new to the workplace and unprece-\ndented, one for which there are no clear rules or directives on\nhow to operate or respond.As the narrator observes, Bartleby,\nwhen delivering his response, is neither aggressive, nor\nimpertinent, nor confrontational, any one of which would\ninitiate a solution to his dilemma because they would consti-\ntute clear grounds for dismissal. Instead, Bartleby's response\nis fully transgressive because it is activated in response to\nrequests made in one realm while representing another. That\nis, in using the phrase \"I would prefer not to,\" Bartleby\nresponds to the request originated by the lawyer in a way that\nsimultaneously asserts his own visibility and avoids the pre-\nferred modality of how his employer desires to operate. His\nstatement stands in strict contraindication to the lawyer's\nlogical presupposition that within this organization, the\nrequests made by a manager regarding how the work process\nis organized will be obeyed. Bartleby's response of consis-\ntently refusing to engage in the way work is organized within\nthe office signals, linguistically, his outsider status because it\nconstitutes his attempt to maintain circulation in a discourse\nthat originates and ends with him. If, as Foucault has\nobserved, discursive production is productive of power and\nthe propagation of knowledge inside of organizational struc-\ntures, then Bartleby's repetition of his statement regarding\nhis preferences in response to all the requests of the lawyer\nalso underscores his desire to maintain power within the lin-\nguistic construction he himself engenders. Bartleby's utter-\nance of his preferences constitutes a narrative of resistance, a\nform of \"oppositional talk . . . that takes a stance that high-\nlights the differences between the institutional discourse and\nforms of knowing and being the speaker feels to be prefera-\ngenerate a critical perspective on the official narrative of\nhow the organization can and should function. The consistent\niteration of his preferring not to threatens the viability of the\nlawyer's operation because of its potential to dismantle exist-\ning hierarchies within the Office of the Chancery, thereby\nderailing the way the work of the organization is understood\nto be performed.\nThe Search for Other Discursive\nRealms to Address the Problem\nBartleby's insistence on maintaining an exclusionary status\nby operating outside the formal parameters of the Office of\nthe Chancery destabilizes not only the work of that office but\nalso the confidence of the manager who runs it. Unable to\ndevelop a strategy to contain this threat to his status within\nthe power relations of his organization, the lawyer manifests\nbehaviors that indicate he is becoming increasingly more\ndesperate and uncertain about how to act. Whitehead, Liese,\nand O'Dell (1990) have noted that the narrator begins to\nshow signs of psychopathology when he assumes on a walk\nto the office that everyone in the street is talking about him\nand his odd relationship with Bartleby. This culminates in his\n\"panic flight\" (Whitehead et al., 1990, p. 20) when he real-\nizes the futility of all his efforts to get Bartleby to leave the\nbuilding. But perhaps the strongest evidence of the narrator's\ndesperation is revealed by the number of knowledge fields he\ndeploys in an attempt to understand, presumably to contain\nand govern, his orthogonal employee. As Foucault (1978)\nhas noted, knowledge fields, like the law and medicine, per-\nform discursive functions that both contain and construct\nunderstandings. In the case of the narrator, these knowledge\nfields range from the frivolous--the speculation that\nBartleby's behavior is due to a diet limited to ginger nuts--to\nthe medical--inability to discharge copy work because of\neyestrain brought on by overwork. He likewise invokes a\nwide range of authorities, looking for direction in such var-\nied sources as the New Testament to philosophers, such as\nJoseph Priestly, on predestination. The lawyer maneuvers at\nrapid speed through this constantly evolving field of experts,\nevidence of his dissatisfaction with the ability of any one of\nthem to resolve his dilemma on how to integrate Bartleby\nmore effectively into his organization. After reading Priestly,\nfor example, the lawyer becomes convinced that he was des-\ntined to connect with Bartleby whom he views as sent by\nGod to make him a better human being. However, as pres-\nsure from his colleagues in the legal profession mounts, the\n6 SAGE Open\nlawyer just as quickly abjures that position because it\nbecomes apparent that any display of loyalty to Bartleby has\nthe potential to imperil his livelihood and reputation.\nBartleby's continuing insistence on excluding himself from\nthe performance of work activities by preferring not to par-\nticipate in them destabilizes the coherence of the official nar-\nrative that the lawyer has relied on to guide the relationships\nand work assignments in his office. Destabilizing the official\nnarrative imperils the continuance of the organization.\nMoreover, none of the knowledge systems he deploys,\nwhether medical, theological, or philosophical, provides the\nlawyer with guidance on how to construct an organization\nthat reconciles his desire to secure a comfortable life and the\nesteem of his employees with Bartleby as part of the opera-\ntion. The lawyer's maneuvering at rapid speed through a\nwide and varied realm of discursive fields not only illustrates\nthe destabilizing effect Bartleby has had on the organiza-\ntion's operation, it is also evidence of the lawyer's despera-\ntion to find a way to find an organizational structure that will\nallow him to continue to accommodate all of his employees\nwhile yet maintaining the steady output of product necessary\nfor the organization to continue.\nWhy Legal Discourse Is an Effective Solution\nThe solution to the Bartleby \"problem\" comes from the land-\nlord of the building that houses the lawyer's operation. The\nlandlord's organization is comprised of a number of lucrative\nrental spaces in this building. His ability to attract and retain\nrenters is compromised by the dysfunction within one of his\nrental units. To save his operation, which is his primary and\nonly concern, the landlord gets the court to arrest Bartleby on\ncharges of vagrancy, an action that results in his removal\nfrom the premises and consignment to prison at the Tombs.\nAlthough the lawyer debates whether the legal term \"vagrant\"\nwas even appropriate for someone who essentially inhabited\na single building, and who, in fact, had managed to support\nhimself, he complies with the legal decision, unwilling, as\nper usual, to make waves. The conviction and consignment\nof Bartleby to prison provides closure to a problem that the\nnarrator and the larger society within which he operates\nfaced: They now have a term whereby they can contain--and\ndelimit--a Bartleby as well as a mechanism for initiating a\nline of action that will ensure his erasure as an impediment to\nwork operations in the building. The law represents a sanc-\ntioned form of discourse, one which directs a specific course\nof action. The use of the term \"vagrant\" to describe Bartleby\neffectually displaces him from the context of one cultural\nspace and repositions him inside another, one with its own\nconstitutive structures.\nBartleby's arrest proves a boon for the lawyer on many\nlevels. For one thing, it insures that the organizational struc-\nture that had proven so successful to work activity in the\noffice can resume, in large part because of the removal of the\none impediment to its implementation. Bartleby's removal\nfrom the Office of the Chancery likewise contributes to the\nreauthorization of the discourse of that workplace, an action\nthat is not only essential to directing how that work is to be\nperformed but also to clarifying and structuring the power\nrelations essential to facilitating its operation. Indeed, per-\nhaps the greatest threat Bartleby posed to the lawyer's opera-\ntion was in this area. The growing frequency with which the\nother employees in the Office of Chancery begin to use the\nterm \"prefer\" in their conversations manifests not only the\nfacility with which that term has become incorporated into\nthe discourse of the workplace but also its potential to upend\nand transform the organizational structures within which the\nscriveners have traditionally operated. The term \"prefer\" is,\nas Friedman (1966) suggests, constitutive of an alternative of\nhow business operations generally occur, as linguistically, it\nrepresents a\nstrange reversal of situation that allows the employee rather than\nthe employer to stipulate the terms of work, especially when this\nstipulation is not based on any contractual agreement or mutual\nbargaining but upon an entirely unexplained and undefended \"I\nprefer not to.\" (p. 67)\nBartleby's removal from the office, facilitated by the deploy-\nment of the legal charge that he is a vagrant, insures that his\nfavored response will likewise disappear with him, thereby\nneutralizing its potency in narrative terms of an official dis-\ncourse for guiding work activities within the lawyer's\noperation.\nThe Lawyer' Fate: Fallout From a\nFailure to Act Decisively\nUltimately, even the removal of Bartleby from his office is\nnot enough to prevent the lawyer's professional downfall. At\nthe end of Melville's story, he reveals that he has lost his posi-\ntion in the Office of the Chancery, a position that he had\ncounted on as a lifetime appointment. Ironically, his fate mir-\nrors that of his orthogonal employee. Like Bartleby who came\nto the lawyer's operation after losing his clerkship in the Dead\nLetter Office in Washington because of \"a change in the\nlikewise lost his position as Master of Chancery because of a\nchange in the state of New York's Constitution. Like Bartleby,\nthen, the lawyer experiences firsthand what it is to be a subor-\ndinate within the moving substrate that characterizes all\nexchanges of power. In falling from favor, the lawyer has\ndirect experience of the conditionality and the fragility that\ncharacterize all subordinative relationships. Indeed, given the\nlawyer's turn from personal growth in caring for Bartleby to\nconcern for his own survival, perhaps the message of the\nstory is one which concerns the fragile presumption on which\nall relationships, both inside and outside the office, ultimately\nrest. At the same time, \"Bartleby the Scrivener\" is powerful\ntestimony to the threat inherent in simple declarations and to\nthe potential they have to upend and destabilize the coherence\nof official narratives that guide and organize sequences of\naction inside of ruling institutions.\nConclusion\nThe use of methodology from the social sciences, in particu-\nlar, the application of methods used by institutional ethnog-\nraphers to the analysis of the office setting in Herman\nMelville's \"Bartleby the Scrivener,\" provides a useful tool\nfor identifying and analyzing the nature of power relations\nwithin the organization that is the setting of the story. It also\nprovides a mechanism with which to identify how employ-\nees working within that environment mediate and negotiate\nits structure. At the same time, by making central to its meth-\nodology the voice of participants within the organization, an\nethnographic approach contributes to an understanding of\nthe role played by the discursive constructions that structure\nand organize work activities within such institutions as well\nas the roles and relationships that result as individuals func-\ntion within those organizational structures and discursive\nconstructions. As the narrative of Bartleby suggests, success\nin the Office of Chancery is manifested by a consistent and\nunreflective response to a specific sanctioned form of dis-\ncourse, in this case, an uncontested agreement to read docu-\nments for errors. Bartleby's continuing insistence on\npreferring not to do this as well as other work activities\ndeemed essential to the success of this organization, under-\nscores his outsider status as reflected in this dominant discur-\nsive paradigm, just as, over time, its unconscious insertion\ninto the casual conversations of the other employees in the\nChancery office signals its potential to dismantle the terms of\nunderstanding on which the business must operate to be suc-\ncessful. Indeed, as the concerted effort to remove him from\nthe Chancery office suggests, his behaviors, in particular, his\nutterance of a preference that is so at odds with the expecta-\ntion for how employees are to perform their work functions\nwithin the office's existing organizational hierarchies is pow-\nerful testimony to the threat inherent in simple declarations\nand to the potential they have to upend and destabilize the\ncoherence of official narratives that guide and organize\nsequences of action inside of ruling institutions.\nAn ethnographic approach to Herman Melville's short\nstory, \"Bartleby the Scrivener,\" also opens up new under-\nstandings of the office setting that is at the heart of the story.\nIt helps readers understand why the office, a site of social\norganization, adopts specific structures as crucial to its func-\ntioning. It also deepens an awareness of how roles and hier-\narchies within the organization are consequences of those\nchoices. Ethnography also provides tools for identifying and\nevaluating linguistic markers of an individual's positioning\nwithin organizational structures. In doing so, it provides a\ntheoretical context within which to understand the signifi-\ncance to the organization that Bartleby's linguistic mantra of\nconsistently preferring not to represents.At the same time, an\nethnographic reading of Melville's story provides a mecha-\nnism for identifying the larger institutional process at work\nin Melville's story, one that contributes to the reproduction of\na system of social relations in the workplace that requires\nsubordination and compliance to insure its success.\nAs this discussion of \"Bartleby the Scrivener\" suggests,\nthe application of social science methods can be a useful tool\nfor literary analysis. Characters in fiction occupy many orga-\nnizational spaces, from law courts and tribal structures to\nmedical and military institutions. The tools provided by eth-\nnographic institutional methodologies can be useful in open-\ning up an understanding not only of how these organizations\nare structured but also of how those structures determine\nhow the characters in those literary landscapes inhabit orga-\nnizational spaces and come to operate there.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnderson, W.
