While hearing loss could occur purely by noise\ninduction, it usually occurs from a combination of\ndifferent factors.\nOccupational noise exposure has been associated\nwith hearing loss, especially among workers with\nhigh noise exposure levels.3e7 Approximately 16%\nof hearing impairment worldwide is attributed to\nmillion workers are exposed to noise levels at work\nthat put them at risk of hearing loss.10\nHearing loss can be diagnosed through review of\nan audiogram, regardless of whether the hearing\nloss is caused by noise or other factors, such as\nageing.11 12 Noise-induced hearing loss usually\nbegins at 3, 4 or 6 kHz (higher frequencies). With\nnoise-induced hearing loss, thresholds at these\nfrequencies are higher (indicating hearing loss) than\nat that of 0.5 and 1 kHz (lower frequencies) and at\n8 kHz (recovery), which is named a noise notch.12 13\nIn contrast, the audiogram of age-related hearing\nloss shows substantial down-sloping (higher\nthresholds) in higher frequencies.11 13 The associa-\ntion between noise exposure and noise notch allows\nus to observe the distinct effect of noise exposure on\nnoise-induced hearing loss while excluding the\neffect of changes in hearing ability by other factors.\nAlthough previous epidemiological studies have\nconsistently shown a positive association between\noccupational noise exposure and hearing loss, few\nstudies have been able to measure cumulative\npersonal noise exposure in the general population.\n< Additional materials are\npublished online only.

The O*NET is the\nsurvey-based database system generated by the US Department\nof Labor providing information on skills, abilities, knowledge,\nwork activities and interests across occupational groups.19 Data\nwere collected through questionnaires from employees selected\nin every occupation group coded as the Standardized Occupa-\ntion Codes (SOC) and were scored by mean scales in each SOC\ngroup. Because a question about occupational noise exposure is\nincluded in the questionnaire, mean scores of such a question\nmay provide quantitative measures of occupational noise expo-\nsure in all occupation groups, those occupations with high noise\nexposure as well as those with low exposure. This allows us to\nevaluate the potential health effects of noise within various\noccupational groups of the general population. An important\nlimitation of this approach is the fact that it cannot be validated\nas a method of assessing occupational exposure without being\ncompared to direct measurements of workplace noise in each\noccupation. Nonetheless, if the O*NET noise estimates have\na significant association with hearing loss in a well-defined\npopulation with a wide range of occupation groups, the\napplicability of this method may be confirmed.\nThe aims of this study were to introduce a quantitative\noccupational noise exposure assessment tool using O*NET and\nto evaluate its applicability using data from the National Health\nthe general US population.\nO*NET noise exposure assessment\nThe O*NET is a publicly available on-line database that describes\noccupational features across SOC taxonomy. This study used the\nrecent version `O*NET 12.0' available at the O*NET website\n(http://www.onetcenter.org/database.html#download) or the\nNational Crosswalk Service Center (http://www.xwalkcenter.\norg). We extracted the data of the occupational noise scale scores\nas the element name `Sounds, Noise Levels are Distracting, etc'\n(element ID IV.C.2.b.1.a) across 801 SOC groups. Occupational\nnoise exposure was scored by frequency-type answers to the\nquestion, `In your current job, how often are you exposed to\nsounds and noise levels that are distracting and uncomfort-\nable?'.20 Five responses are possible, `never (1)', `once a year or\nmore but not every month (2)', `once a month or more but not\nevery week (3)', `once a week or more but not every day (4)' and\n`every day (5)'.21 An example of the O*NET database structure\n(O*NET SOC code, noise estimates, SE and survey sample size)\nis presented in supplemental table 1. We used the mean of\nresponses in each 801 SOC occupation as a proxy measure of\noccupational noise exposure. For example, the category\n(SE\u00bc0.24), whereas the category `construction carpenters' (SOC:\nworkers in that job category are exposed daily to `distracting and\nuncomfortable noise levels'. Likewise, if the score is close to 1,\nworkers in that category are almost never exposed to such noise\nlevels. The mean O*NET noise scores, therefore, represent the\nprobability of a worker in a certain job category being exposed to\n`distracting and uncomfortable sounds and noise' and do not\nreflect the loudness of sound wave (such as decibels).\nApplication of the O*NET noise estimates to a hearing loss study\nStudy population\nThe NHANES, conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS) since the early 1960s, is an ongoing series of\ncross-sectional surveys designed to assess health and nutritional\nstatus in the civilian non-institutionalised US population.\n20e69 years were randomly selected to participate in the Audi-\nometry Examination Component. Subjects were excluded if\nthey used hearing aids that were not able to be removed for\ntesting or had sufficient ear pain at the time of the examination\nthat they could not tolerate headphones.22 The eligible sample\nAudiometric measures\nAudiometry examination was performed in a sound-isolated\nroom in the mobile examination centre by health technicians\ntrained by a National Institute for Occupational Safety and\nHealth-certified audiologist. Instrumentation for the Audiometry\nComponent included an Interacoustics Model AD226 audiom-\neter with standard TDH-39 headphones and EtymoticEar Tone\n3A insert earphones.22 Pure-tone air conduction hearing thresh-\nand 8 kHz across an intensity range of \u00c010 to 120 dB. Partici-\npants with missing value at one or more frequencies were\nexcluded from analysis. Procedural details in collecting the\naudiometric data have been described elsewhere.22 23\nWe computed hearing thresholds (decibels) at speech\nfrequencies as a pure-tone average (PTA) of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz\nand the hearing thresholds at high frequencies as a pure-tone\naverage (high PTA) of 3, 4 and 6 kHz.24 According to classifica-\ntion by the WHO, hearing loss is defined as PTA greater than\n25 dB in either ear.24 25 Noise notch was defined as the hearing\nthreshold at 3, 4 and/or 6 kHz at least 10 dB greater than at 1 or\nOf the initial sample of 5742 participants eligible for inclusion\nin the audiometry examination, 324 (6%) were excluded from\nthe analysis because a test was not performed at all and 152\n(3%) were excluded because tests have missing values at one or\nmore frequencies. As an additional measure of reliability of\nparticipant responses, all audiograms tested the 1 kHz frequency\ntwice in each ear.22 Three participants were excluded because\nthere was >10 dB difference between the 1 kHz testeretest\nthresholds.24 An additional 452 participants were excluded\nbecause of unilateral hearing loss defined as >10 dB difference\nbetween the PTAs of left and right ears. Therefore, audiometric\nresults for 4811 participants were included for analysis in the\npresent study.\nOccupational noise estimates\nParticipant occupation information was obtained from the\noccupation questionnaire, which contains personal interview\ndata on employment and variables relating to the work envi-\nronment, such as workplace noise exposure history.26 We used\nthe participant's longest job as a measure of past noise exposure.\nThe longest job information was obtained by asking the\nExposure assessment\nquestion directly: `What kind of work were you doing the\nlongest?'.27 Occupation data were then coded by trained coders\noccupation, which are the three-digit NCHS Occupational\nClassification Source Codes.28 In the publicly available NHANES\ndata, these codes were collapsed into 41 occupation categories.27\nOf the 4811 participants with available audiometric measure-\nments, 4547 had information available on their longest\njobd2498 participants who answered their longest job plus an\nadditional 2049 participants who answered their longest job\nwere the same as their current job and for whom the current job\ncode was assigned as their longest job. To link the O*NET noise\nestimates to the 41 occupation categories, we grouped the 801\nO*NET SOCs available into the corresponding NHANES occu-\npation categories and computed the averages of the O*NET noise\nscores in each category. Because military occupations were not\nincluded in the O*NETsurvey, we could not generate an O*NET\nnoise score for the military occupation group and so resulted in\n40 occupation groups for analysis. After linking O*NET noise\nestimates to occupation categories, we assigned an average noise\nscore to each participant. Of the 4547 participants with available\nlongest job information, we excluded 66 participants whose\nlongest jobs were not coded to any of the 41 occupation groups\nand 59 participants who had military occupation, yielding 4422\nparticipants available for statistical analyses.\nWe also computed the weighted averages of O*NET noise\nscores for the 40 NHANES occupation groups, accounting for the\nSEs of the noise scores in each O*NET SOC group and which\nreflect the precision of the O*NETsurvey data (see supplemental\ntable 1). Because SEs were not available for 58 of the 801 SOCs, we\nused the unweighted averages as our primary index of occupa-\ntional noise and examined the weighted ones as a sensitivity\nanalysis. The unweighted and weighted average O*NETscores for\n40 occupation categories are presented in table 1.\nTable 1 Unweighted and weighted averages of O*NET occupational noise scores by 40 NHANES occupation groups\nNHANES code NHANES occupation group Participants number\nO*NET noise average score\nUnweighted Weighted*\n*Weighted average was defined +p\ni\u00bci\n\u00f0O*NETscorei\n+p\n\u00de\nas where i is an individual job title in O*NET Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) and p is the total number of O*NET SOCs\nclassified within the NHANES occupation group.\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; O*NET, Occupational Information Network.\nExposure assessment\nThe characteristics between participants with and without\nthe longest job information were similar in terms of prevalence\nof hearing loss, age, body mass index (BMI) and the status\nof hypertension and diabetes. Compared to included partici-\npants, excluded participants were less likely to be male, non-\nHispanic white and smokers, less educated, and less exposed to\noccupational noise (see supplemental table 2).\nDemographic and hearing-related variables\nOther demographic and hearing-related variables were obtained\nfrom the NHANES questionnaires. BMI was calculated as\nweight in kilograms/height in metres squared (missing for 49\nparticipants). Use of ototoxic medication was counted when\nparticipants reported medications of aminoglycoside, loop\ndiuretics, antineoplastic drugs or non-steroidal anti-inflamma-\ntory drugs (missing for five participants). Smoking pack-years\nwere computed and grouped into non-smokers, smokers who\nsmoked <20 pack-years or smokers who smoked >20 pack-years\n(missing for 392 participants). Hypertension was defined as self-\nreported physician diagnosis, use of antihypertensive medica-\ntion, systolic blood pressure $140 mm Hg or diastolic blood\npressure $90 mm Hg at the time of examination (missing for\n189 participants). Diabetes mellitus was defined as those who\nself-reported either previous physician diagnosis or use of anti-\nhyperglycemic medication (missing for two participants). Non-\noccupational noise exposures were determined by audiometry\nquestionnaires asking if the subject had ever been exposed\noutside of work to the noise of a firearm for a mean of at least\nonce a month for 1 year (missing for five participants) and if the\nsubject had ever been exposed outside of work to loud noise\n(eg, power tools or loud music) for a mean of at least once\na month for 1 year (missing for six participants). Socioeconomic\nstatus, such as education attainment, may be a potential\nconfounder, but we did not consider it because education is\nhighly correlated with job title used for our O*NET noise esti-\nmates, and controlling for such a socioeconomic status may\nresult in over adjustment for our exposure effect.\nOur study sample was limited to adults who had complete\ninformation on these important covariates, and therefore, a total\nof 3828 participants were available for data analyses.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS survey\nprocedures (SAS V.9.2) and the Rsurvey package (R V.2.9.1) to\naccount for the complex survey design of the NHANES.1 29\nSample weights for the combined 6-year sample were used as per\nNCHS recommendations in order to provide annual national\nestimates, which accounted for the unequal probabilities of\nselection due to over sampling and non-response.24\nLinear regressions were used for continuous hearing thresholds\nin each frequency and PTA. Hearing threshold outcomes were\nlog-transformed to normalise distributions. Eighty subjects\n(2.1%) with better-than-normal hearing had zero or negative\nhearing thresholds. We excluded these subjects to better interpret\nregression results of log-transformed thresholds in our primary\nlinear regression analyses. Linear regressions including all avail-\nable subjects were considered in sensitivity analyses to evaluate\nthe effect of the exclusion. In sensitivity analyses, a constant 6\nwas added before log-transformation to make all hearing\nthreshold values positive and the resulting data as normal as\npossible. We examined the O*NET noise score as a continuous\nvariable and in quintiles. For the latter, we tested for linear trend\nacross quintiles using ordinal terms. For dichotomous hearing loss\nand noise notch outcomes, we determined the OR and 95% CI\nusing logistic regression models. In multiple regression analyses,\nwe identified a priori those covariates that needed to be\ncontrolled for, based on biological consideration and the current\nstate of the literature: age (years), sex, race/ethnicity, BMI\n(kilograms per square metre), cigarette smoking (pack-years),\nototoxic medication, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, firearm\nnoise exposure and recreation noise exposure.30 We fit age and\nage-squared to capture non-linear effects of age. To identify\ninfluence of potential confounders, we developed sequential\nmodels: (1) age, sex and race/ethnicity adjusted; (2) additionally\nadjusted for BMI, ototoxic medication, cigarette smoking, current\ndiagnosis of hypertension and current diagnosis of diabetes and\n(3) additionally adjusted for recreational noise and firearm noise\nexposures. We examined subgroup analyses by age, sex and\nrace/ethnicity to identify the most susceptible subpopulations.\nRESULTS\nO*NET noise exposure assessment\nTable 1 shows the unweighted and weighted averages of O*NET\nnoise scores by 40 occupation groups. `Private household occu-\npations' had the lowest noise score in both unweighted (1.80)\nand weighted averages (2.02), whereas `extractive and precision\nproduction occupations' and `other transportation and material\nmoving occupations' were highest in unweighted (4.37) and\nweighted (4.63) averages, respectively. We used the unweighted\nscores in all subsequent analyses.\nApplication to hearing loss study\nGeneral characteristics\nTable 2 shows descriptive characteristics of study participants.\nOverall, 456 subjects (11.9%) had a mild or greater hearing loss.\nAfter accounting for sampling weights, cluster and strata of the\nNHANES complex design, the mean of O*NET noise scores in\nhearing loss had a significantly higher noise score than those\nmeans of O*NETscores in the entire population and for subjects\nwith and without hearing loss which were not considered\n(SD\u00bc0.59), respectively. Distributions of the O*NET noise\nscores in the NHANES participants are shown in supplemental\nfigure 1. Subjects with hearing loss were older (54.8 vs\nototoxic medication (24% vs 15%), less educated (percentage of\ngreater than high school diploma 43% vs 60%), more likely to be\nexposed to occupational noise (45% vs 32%) and firearm noise\nand diabetes (12% vs 3%) than those without hearing loss.\nTable 3 presents the distributions of participant characteristics\nby quintiles of the O*NET noise scores. Subjects with higher\noccupational noise were more likely to be male and of race/\nethnicity other than non-Hispanic white, more likely to have\nhigher hearing thresholds, less educated and more likely to be\nexposed to firearm and recreational noises than those with lower\noccupational noise.\nOccupational noise exposure and hearing thresholds\nTable 4 shows per cent changes in PTA in associations with the\nO*NETscore as a continuous variable and in quintiles in various\ncovariate-adjusted models. An increase in occupational noise\nexposure either as a continuous variable or in quintiles was\nsignificantly associated with higher (poorer) hearing thresholds.\nIn the fully adjusted model (model C), subjects in the highest\nExposure assessment\nhearing thresholds than those in the lowest quintile. A unit\nincrease in the O*NET noise score was associated with a 15.4%\nfully adjusted model.

It should be noted\nthat this study did not attempt to validate the O*NET scores as\na surrogate for personal occupational noise exposure levels.\nRather, we evaluated an applicability of the O*NET scores as\na proxy measure in association with occupational noise-related\nhealth effects in the general population, given available job title\ninformation. We found a significant doseeresponse relationship\nof O*NET noise scores with hearing loss and noise notch in\nNHANES, confirming that O*NET scores would be useful for\nexamining noise-related health effects in the absence of personal\noccupational noise exposure data. Our results also extend\nevidence of noise-induced hearing loss in workers with\nextremely high noise exposure to the general population with\nlow noise exposure, reinforcing occupational noise as an\nimportant risk factor for hearing loss. We found that men, non-\nHispanic white and the age group of 40e59 years were more\nsusceptible to occupational noise-associated hearing loss than\nother groups.\nIn fact, we ran regression analyses dealing with O*NETscores\nas a continuous variable and estimated the b coefficients corre-\nsponding to a one-unit increase in O*NET scores. The OR for\nrisk of hearing loss corresponding to a one-unit increase in\n2.13) in a multivariable-adjusted model. A significant dose-\ndependent relationship with O*NET scores was retained in\nsequential models after adjusting for socioeconomic factors,\nnon-occupational noise exposures and other potential risk\nfactors. This suggests that the association between occupational\nnoise exposure and hearing loss is independent of such risk\nfactors. This increased risk is roughly equivalent to 20 or more\nrecreational noise exposure (OR\u00bc1.62) (see supplemental table\n8). The estimated effect size of O*NET score is also similar\nto the effects of 5 years of ageing (OR\u00bc1.69) when age is fit\nlinearly.\nIt is difficult to compare our findings to other studies because\nthere are no studies of doseeresponse relationship between\noccupational noise exposure and hearing loss in the general\npopulation with low to high exposure as a continuous variable.\nA few previous investigations of noise and hearing loss have\nbeen made across crude occupational groups in the general\npopulation. In one such study, over 3500 older adults in Beaver\nDam, Wisconsin, were examined for hearing loss in six occupa-\ntion categories. A statistically significant increased risk of\nmanagement as a reference group.6 Another study mailed\na questionnaire over 22 000 adults of working age across Britain\nand examined the association between years worked in a noisy\njob and self-reported hearing difficulty. That study found an\nincrease in hearing difficulty by years worked in a noisy job and\na statistically significant increased risk of hearing loss in\nnon-exposed group.16 Our findings are broadly compatible with\nthese studies and confirm the evidence of increased risk of\nhearing loss with increase in occupational noise exposure in the\ngeneral population.\nIn addition to its relationship with hearing loss, the O*NET\noccupational noise score had a strong dose-dependent relation-\nship with noise notch. The presence of noise notch is one\ndiagnostic in determining that hearing loss is noise induced\nrather than the effect by other factors such as ageing.11 12 The\nORs of the risk of noise notch increased also gradually across the\nand 1.51). This suggests that the O*NET occupational noise\ncould be a good proxy for occupational noise exposure.\nThe main strengths of this study include (1) the use of\nrepresentative samples of the US general population, including\nover sampled minority populations, which enables the observed\nresults to be generalisable; (2) the adjustment for various\npotential confounding factors of the association between occu-\npational noise and hearing loss, especially noise exposure other\nthan workplace noise, such as firearm and recreational noise, and\nuse of ototoxic medication and (3) the use of NHANES data\nconducted with strict quality control procedures.\nThis study has several limitations that should be considered.\nBecause the O*NET database we used is based on the frequency\nof exposure to sounds and noise levels considered distracting and\nuncomfortable rather than on actual noise measurements,\nexposure misclassification may exist. Moreover, the O*NET data\nare classified only by occupation groups and do not account for\nvariations in noise exposure from different industry groups or\ndifferent job task groups within the same occupation classifi-\ncation. The assumption that jobs with the same title have\nsimilar occupational noise exposure could also lead to misclas-\nsification of exposure. Misclassification might also have occurred\nwhen 801 O*NET occupation groups were combined into 40\nNHANES occupation groups. Because the O*NET survey is\ntotally independent of the audiometry tests in NHANES,\nhowever, such exposure misclassification is likely to be\nnon-differential and leads to a true association towards the null.\nAlthough our study showed that as an exposure proxy,\nlongest job is better than current job in predicting occupational\nnoise-induced hearing loss, we could not account for the job\nhistory nor the duration of each job. Because the reported\nlongest job is more likely to be related to hearing loss, however,\nthe bias would be non-differential. Collecting information on\nfull job history and duration would improve validity and\nreliability of any noise exposure assessment using O*NET.\nAlthough we examined three cycles of the NHANES data,\nwhich offers significant power, causal inferences may not be\nmade because of the cross-sectional nature of the NHANES data.\nNevertheless, use of the longest job may be temporally relevant\nto current audiometry test results.\nOne might argue that there is selection bias in that the\nassociation between occupational noise and hearing loss is\ndifferent for subjects included in our analysis who provided\ninformation on their longest job and those excluded due to no\nlongest job information. We found that the prevalence of noise\nnotch for included subjects was significantly different from the\nprevalence for excluded subjects and that included subjects were\nmore likely than excluded subjects to have been exposed to loud\njob noise for at least 3 months on all previous jobs (supple-\nmental table 2). Most of the excluded subjects had never worked\n(75%), are currently housewives (67%, all women), disabled\npeople with no job history (10%) and students (8%). Although\nour results cannot be generalised to the non-included people\n(housewives, students and the disabled), we believe that the\nobserved associations are valid to conclude noise exposure at\nworkplaces as an important risk factor for hearing loss and that\nthe selection bias is unlikely.\nExposure assessment\nIn summary, the present study supports the hypothesis that\noccupational noise exposure increases the risk of hearing loss\nacross various occupations. Utilisation of the O*NET noise\nexposure data would allow us to perform epidemiological\nstudies of occupational noise exposure in the general population\nand to better understand the health effects of occupational noise\nexposure.\nFunding This study was supported by the National Institute of Environment Health\nSciences grants K01-ES016587.
