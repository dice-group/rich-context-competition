    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere is a growing need to assess the psychological outcomes of exercise referral and the National Institute of Health\nand Care Excellence has called for the routine assessment of life-quality. However, a quality of life scale specific to the\nrequirements of exercise referral is currently unavailable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to produce a quality of\nlife measure for this purpose. The Exercise Referral Quality of Life Scale is a 22-item measure comprising three domains:\nmental and physical health, injury pain and illness and physical activity facilitators. Exploratory factor analysis determined\nthe initial factor structure and was subsequently confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. Additional scale properties\nwere also assessed. The scale contributes to the global need for improved consistent psychological outcome assessment\nof exercise referral.\n",

A sub-\nsequent re-analysis of the 2008 data using the most recent\nper cent of men and\nper cent of women met the revised (DH, 2011) PA\nguidelines (HSE, 2012). As a result, PA is increasingly\nbeing considered the best investment in health and has been\nincluded into a series of public health policy publications\nExercise referral schemes have become a popular\nmethod of improving health outcomes and reducing physi-\ncal inactivity both within the United Kingdom and globally.\nIn response to the rapid growth of schemes from around the\nyear 2000, guidelines (the National Quality Assurance\nFramework (NQAF)) were produced to assist practitioners\nand researchers to design and evaluate such schemes (DH,\n2002). In the NQAF, it was also advised that psychological\nmeasures were more likely than physical measures to show\nThe typical duration of a UK exercise referral scheme is\nImproving the psychological evaluation\nof exercise referral: Psychometric\nproperties of the Exercise Referral\nQuality of Life Scale\nCharlotte Hilton1, Richard Trigg2 and Antoinette Minniti3\n Keywords\nexercise behaviour, health psychology, physical activity, public health psychology, quality of life\n1Coventry University, UK\n2Nottingham Trent University, UK\n3American Psychological Association, USA\nCorresponding author:\nCharlotte Hilton, Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences,\nFaculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University, James Starley\nBuilding, Room JS264, Priory Street, Coventry CV15FB, UK.\nEmail: charlotte.hilton@coventry.ac.uk\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \n10\u00ad12weeks, and because of the diversity in the level and\ntype of evaluation, schemes were advised that they should\nonly be endorsed by practitioners, policy-makers and com-\nmissioners when part of a properly designed and controlled\nresearch study to determine effectiveness (NICE, 2006b).\nSince these initial publications, a Standard Evaluation\nFramework for Physical Activity Interventions has been\ndeveloped (National Obesity Observatory, 2012), and more\nrecent guidance for the implementation and evaluation of\nexercise referral schemes has been produced which specifi-\ncally states the necessity to include health-related quality of\nlife (QoL) as an outcome measure (NICE, 2014).\nThere has been much debate regarding the efficacy of\nexercise referral schemes in terms of their ability to increase\nindividual PA levels and their contribution to health\ncally, in assessment of such schemes, it was often the case\nthat relevant psychological and environmental parameters\n(such as access to leisure services, suitable transport and\nhow well the environment outside of structured exercise\nsupports PA behaviour) were ignored (Dugdill et al., 2005).\nSince the earlier attempts to evaluate exercise referral\nschemes, efforts have been made to publish findings with\nrespect to the broader psycho-social outcomes of such\nschemes that also include life-quality (e.g. Murphy et al.,\n2010). However, because to date there has not been a scale\navailable that is designed to measure exercise-related life-\nquality within clinical populations specifically, practitioners\nand researchers have had to resort to the use of generic\nmeasures such as the EuroQoL (EQ-5D; Brooks and\nConsequently, the lack of a specific tool has also resulted in\nvaried generic tools being utilised in an attempt to measure\nexercise-related life-quality (e.g. SF-36; Brazier et al., 1992;\nWare, 1996) which makes comparisons between studies dif-\nficult (Pavey et al., 2011) and challenges efforts to draw\nclear conclusions regarding the psychological impact of\nexercise referral.\nStudies that incorporate more holistic health measures,\nthat include those specific to exercise-related life-quality,\ncan recognise the value of person-centred methods of\nhealthcare practice and focus on the person with the disease\nrather than the course of the disease itself (Bauman et al.,\n2003). Furthermore, QoL measures have been recognised\nas a valuable method of addressing a shift in attention from\ncontrolling a patient's disease to their experience of poten-\ntial suffering (Cohen et al., 1996). The inclusion of a QoL\ntool specifically designed for exercise referral is likely to\ncontribute to the necessity to build on the evidence base for\nthe effectiveness of exercise referral \u00ad particularly with\nrespect to health-related life-quality outcomes (NICE,\n2014). The Exercise Referral Quality of Life Scale\n(ER-QLS) documents the physical and mental health con-\nditions with which individuals have been referred, so there\nis capacity to compare total and sub-domain scores accord-\ning to these criteria. It is reasonable that perceived life-\nquality may be affected by health condition(s), so there is\na valuable opportunity to explore this further with the\nsame measure consistently which will allow for QoL scores\nthat are comparable across schemes, both nationally and\nglobally.\nSix stages of research were undertaken to produce the\nfinal measure. Stage 1 utilised a series of five focus groups\nto generate rich data for the purposes of item development\nand a conceptual framework of exercise-related life-quality\nthat would inform subsequent psychometric analyses. Stage\n2 employed best-practice recommendations from previous\nresearch to construct test items and formulate a test meas-\nure that was formatted in such a way so as to facilitate its\ncompletion and reduce respondent burden. Stage 3 cogni-\ntively pre-tested these test-pool items to ensure that they\nwere interpreted as intended and to establish appropriate\nface and content validity. Stage 4 employed a classical test\ntheory (CTT) approach to item reduction and also assessed\nthe initial reliability of the measure through test\u00adretest and\ninternal consistency analyses. Stage 5 of the development\nof the ER-QLS employed factor-analytic methods of test\nconstruction to further reduce the item pool and explore the\nstructure of the final measure. Internal consistency, test\u00ad\nretest reliability, acceptability, content validity and conver-\ngent and known-groups components of construct validity of\nthe final measure were also assessed in this stage, and the\nfinal sixth stage of development employed a confirmatory\nfactor analysis (CFA) to inform the final facture structure of\nthe new measure. This article reports the latter two stages of\nscale development.\nThe primary aim of the current study was to develop and\nvalidate the ER-QLS, a new QoL measure specific to exer-\ncise referral settings based on a UK population. The\nER-QLS is not intended to be prescriptive. Rather, the\nintention is to support opportunities to contribute to devel-\noping plans for PA promotion within supervised settings\n2014), contribute to the growing need to evaluate exercise\nand provide practitioners with the most appropriate tools\nfor the task.\nMethod\nParticipants\nEthical approval was obtained from the UK National\nResearch Ethics Service (NRES).All participants were pro-\nvided with an NRES template information sheet describing\nthe study and provided full written consent to their\nparticipation.\nFor the initial exploratory factor analysis (EFA), respond-\nents were recruited from 16 referral schemes across England.\nHilton et al. 3\nThe referral schemes that participated in the research\nprogramme were invited to do so via telephone. Of the 17\nschemes that were approached to act as test sites to generate\nthe respondent data, only one declined due to resource limi-\ntations, resulting in 16 schemes that participated in total.\nExercise referral instructors from each recruitment site con-\nveniently sampled individuals who were either at the start, in\nthe middle or who had been exercising for up to 12months\npost-referral to ask whether they would volunteer to com-\nplete the test questionnaire. Data from 278 respondents were\navailable and used for analyses. For the purposes of test\u00ad\nretest analysis, a nested convenience subsample of 25\nrespondents completed the questionnaire twice, 7days apart.\nThe complete cohort of participants ranged in age from 19 to\nA total of 20 respondents' ages were missing in the returned\ndata. A greater number of females (n=148) than males\n(n=128) were included in the analysis. Gender information\nfor two respondents was missing. The ethnicity of respond-\nents for both the EFA and the CFA and from both the total\nand the test\u00adretest subsample can be reviewed in Table 1.\nThe number of health conditions for which these respondents\nwere referred can also be reviewed in Table 1. These condi-\ntions were typical of those for which individuals are referred\nfor exercise (e.g. coronary heart disease risk factors).\nFor the EFA, the majority of respondents (54%) identi-\nfied that they were at the mid-stage of their referral pro-\ngramme (around 6weeks). While 26per cent identified that\nthey had completed their initial referral phase of exercise\nweeks and beyond), the least amount of respondents\n(20%) identified that they had just started their referral\nprogramme. Therefore, the majority of respondents (80%)\nhad been exposed to at least 6weeks of exercise and PA.\nOf the 25 respondents included in the test\u00adretest analy-\nsis, participants ranged in age from 36 to 73\nyears\n=\nyears). Participant age was pro-\nvided by all but one individual who was included in the\ntest\u00adretest analysis. A relatively equal number of females\n(n\n=\n=\n13) were represented in the\nanalysis.\nAs for the entire participant cohort (N=278), the major-\nity of test\u00adretest respondents reported that they were at the\nmid-stage of their referral (56%). In total, 36\nper cent of\nparticipants reported that they had completed their initial\nreferral phase of 12\nweeks, and 8\nper cent of respondents\nwere at the start of their referral.\nFor the subsequent CFA, participants from a single exer-\ncise referral scheme were recruited. Data from 1750\nrespondents were available and used for analysis. Five par-\nticipant ages were missing from the returned data. A greater\nnumber of females (n\n=\nincluded in the analysis and there were missing data for\neight participants with respect to gender. The ethnicity of\nrespondents from the CFA sample can be reviewed in Table\n1. The most commonly cited reasons for referral were\ndiabetes (n=116). Other commonly cited reasons included\nhypertension (n=77), obesity (n=66), weight maintenance\n(n\n=\n54), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\npain (n=23). It is important to note that leisure profession-\nals were not specific in documenting the type of diabetes\nTable 1. Ethnicity of participants and number of referred health conditions for total and subsamples.\nEthnicity \nNumber of referred health conditions \nCFA: confirmatory factor analysis; EFA: exploratory factor analysis.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nwith which individuals had been referred, and therefore,\nthis was unknown. However, subsequent amendments have\nbeen made to the reasons for referral section of the ER-QLS\nto allow for this to be more easily defined.\nThe majority of respondents (74%) identified that they\nwere at the start of their referral programme, only 0.3\nper\ncent were midway through and 26\nper cent identified that\nthey had completed their initial referral phase of exercise\n(12weeks and beyond).\nMaterials\nThe ER-QLS item pool for the final phase of development\ncontained 29 items. Each item comprised a question that\nrequired a response using a 5-point response scale. Question\ncontent broadly focussed on issues of physical and psycho-\nlogical well-being as well as issues that related more spe-\ncifically to the process of engaging in exercise. For\nexample, questions included `How would you rate your\nphysical health?', `How would you rate your ability to\nmanage stress?' and `How often do you feel you have\nachieved something in terms of your physical fitness?'\nThese 29 items remained from an initial pool of 50, which\nwas generated from a series of focus groups with partici-\npants from a local exercise referral scheme. Focus groups\nexplored the experiences of exercise that are of particular\nimportance to QoL before, during and upon completion of\na 12-week exercise programme. This pool of 50 items had\nbeen reduced to 29 through subsequent phases of question\npretesting, using cognitive interviewing techniques (Willis,\n2005), and a CTT approach to item analysis. These early\nstages of item development are reported elsewhere.\nThe WHOQOL-BREF (Skevington et al., 2004) was\nused as the comparative generic QoL measure with which\nto conduct analyses of convergent validity. The WHOQOL-\nBREF is a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100 assess-\nment and measures four domains: physical, psychological,\nsocial and environmental. Mean domain scores are scaled\nin a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher\nQoL) and the measure contains three reverse-scored items.\nThe psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-BREF were\nanalysed using cross-sectional data obtained from a survey\nof internal consistency, item-total correlations, discrimi-\nnant validity and construct validity through CFA indicated\nthat the WHOQOL-BREF had good to excellent psycho-\nmetric properties of reliability and performed well in pre-\nliminary tests of validity (Skevington et al., 2004).\nThe Subjective Exercise Experience Scale (SEES;\nMcAuley and Courneya, 1994) was also used for conver-\ngent validity testing because of the documented relation-\nship between perceptions of mood, mood management and\nexercise within clinical populations (e.g. Lehrner et al.,\nmeasure. Two of the three factors correspond with the\npositive and negative poles associated with psychological\nhealth, positive well-being and psychological distress,\nwhile the third factor represents subjective indicators of\nfatigue.Theinternalconsistencyofthemeasure(Cronbach's\nalpha) was reported for positive well-being (0.86), psycho-\nand discriminant validity of the SEES were established by\ncorrelations with the Positive and NegativeAffect Schedule\n(PANAS; Watson et al., 1988), the State Anxiety Inventory\n(SAI; Spielberger et al., 1970) and the Feeling Scale (FS;\nHardy and Rejeski, 1989). The SEES is scored dimension-\nally with a higher score for positive well-being reflecting a\nbetter state of well-being and a higher score for personal\ndistress and fatigue indicating greater distress and fatigue,\nrespectively.\nProcedure and analyses\nEFA. For the EFA phase of analysis, data were obtained by\nexercise referral instructors who were employed by one of\nthe 16 participating schemes across England. Participants\nwho had been referred for exercise for health improvement\nwere conveniently sampled (N=278) and self-completed\neach of the scales, including the one under construction.\nThe item pool was further reduced using factor-analytic\nmethods of test construction. A principal component analy-\nsis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to explore the\nstructure of the 29 items. Items were rejected if they failed\nto display loadings greater than 0.4 on any of the main com-\nponents. The number of components extracted was deter-\nmined by parallel analysis. After item rejection, the PCA\nwas re-run in order to explore the structure of the remaining\nitems and develop subscales within the ER-QLS. An assess-\nment of scale reliability included analysis of internal con-\nsistency (Cronbach's alpha and item-total correlations) and\ntest\u00adretest reliability over a 1-week period (intraclass cor-\nrelation coefficient).\nThe convergent construct validity of the ER-QLS was\nassessed by an analysis of Pearson's correlation coefficients\nbetween scores from the ER-QLS and those generated from\nthe dimensions of the WHOQOL-BREF and SEES. It was\nexpected that those individuals who reported higher per-\nceptions of exercise-related life-quality on the ER-QLS\nwould also perceive positive perceptions of generic QoL\n(WHOQOL-BREF and SEES). Due to the focus of items in\nthe ER-QLS, it was expected that it would demonstrate the\nstrongest associations with the physical and psychological\nhealth dimensions of the WHOQOL-BREF. Associations\nwith the social relationships and the environment dimen-\nsions of the WHOQOL-BREF were expected to be less\nstrongly correlated but significant. Similarly, the ER-QLS\nwas expected to show stronger associations with the posi-\ntive well-being and psychological distress dimensions of\nthe SEES and lower but significant associations with\nfatigue. Based upon the methods employed by previous\nHilton et al. 5\nQoL scale development research, the current study consid-\nered Pearson's correlation coefficients of less than 0.2 as\nvery weak, from 0.2 to 0.35 as weak, from greater than\nThe known-groups component of construct validity was\nassessed by a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) that\nassessed the level of total test score variance for those at the\nstart, midway and after completion of their exercise pro-\ngramme. It was expected that those who had completed\ntheir exercise programme would report the highest level of\nQoL because this group had the greatest amount of expo-\nsure to exercise (Laforge et al., 1999).\nConfirmatory factor analysis.Data from a single UK\nexercise referral scheme (N=1750) were used to confirm\nthe factor structure of the ER-QLS. Missing values were\nreplaced with median values before employing a good-\nness-of-fit approach to factor structure assessment with\nSPSS Amos (v20). It is generally accepted that confirma-\ntory models will be shown to be false when tested with\na large sample size such as that of the current study.\nConsequently, applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFS)\nresearch tends to employ sample size independent indices\nand the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI; Tucker and Lewis,\n1973) allow for the measurement of how much better the\nproposed model fits the data compared to a baseline model\nwhereby all variables are uncorrelated. For these indices,\nvalues above 0.90 indicate reasonable model fit and\nHu and Bentler, 1999). The root mean-square error of\napproximation (RMSEA; Steiger, 1990) was also consid-\nResults\nInitial factor structure\nPCA of the 29 items resulted in seven items being rejected\nfrom the item pool as they failed to load on any of the main\ncomponents. After rejection of these items, PCA was re-\nrun on the remaining 22 items. The 22 items were grouped\ninto a statistically and a conceptually coherent three-\ncomponent structure. Parallel analysis confirmed the pres-\nence of at least three components within the items. The\nthree-component solution explained a total of 50.68\nper\ncent of the variance, with Component 1 (mental and physi-\nper cent, Component\n2 (injury pain and illness) contributing 10.68per cent and\nComponent 3 (physical activity facilitators) contributing\n8.52per cent of the variance, respectively. Table 2 displays\nthe loadings of items on these three components. All 22\nitems included in the three-component solution also loaded\n(>0.4) onto a single component if a one-component solu-\ntion was forced.\nAs a consequence, the final scale may be scored dimen-\nsionally or as a single global score. The ER-QLS adopts a\nscoring system of 1 to 5 for each item with a higher item\nand scale score indicating a better perception of exercise-\nrelated life-quality. A reverse scoring of four items is\nrequired. Total scores are presented in the range of 22\u00ad110.\nTotal scores for the dimension mental and physical well-\nbeing are presented in the range of 11\u00ad55. Total scores for\nthe dimension injury pain and illness are presented in the\nrange of 4\u00ad20. Total scores for the dimension physical\nactivity facilitators are presented in the range of 7\u00ad35.\nReproducibility\nThe 7-day test\u00adretest reliability of the final 22 items scored\nas a single scale was assessed by the intraclass correlation\ncoefficient of scores across the time period. This indicated\nan acceptable level of reliability (r19\ntest\u00adretest reliability of the three subscales was excellent,\n<\nInternal consistency\nThe internal consistency of the 22-item ER-QLS was\ngood with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88. This value could\nnot be improved by deleting any of the items.Additionally,\nall 22 items met the item-total correlation criteria of r>0.3\n(Skevington et al., 2004). The internal consistency of the\nthree ER-QLS subscales was also good, with a Cronbach's\ninjury pain and illness and 0.77 for physical activity\nfacilitators.\nConstruct validity\nThe descriptive statistics of the data from the ER-QLS\n(total score and subscales) and each of the dimensions of\nthe SEES and the WHOQOL-BREF can be reviewed in\nThe convergent validity of the scale was also assessed\nby an examination of the correlations between scores on\nthe ER-QLS and those of the WHOQOL-BREF and the\nSEES (Table 4). The relative strength of associations var-\nied as predicted, supporting the construct validity of the\nnew measure. The strongest associations were between\nthe ER-QLS and the physical and psychological subscales\nof the WHOQOL-BREF. Lower but significant correla-\ntions were demonstrated with the social and environmen-\ntal subscales of the WHOQOL-BREF. Similarly, the\nstrongest association between the ER-QLS and the SEES\n6 Health Psychology Open \nwas with the psychological well-being subscale. The cor-\nrelation values observed between the new measure and\nthose of the WHOQOL-BREF and the SEES also support\nthe convergent validity of the ER-QLS. The variance in\nthe strength of the correlations between the ER-QLS\nscores and the respective dimensions of the WHOQOL-\nBREF would also suggest that the test instrument is meas-\nuring components of life-quality that differ to those\ngeneric dimensions assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF\nThe descriptive statistics of the data used to assess the\nknown-groups validity component of construct validity can\nbe found in Table 5.

The internal consistency of the ER-QLS as a single\nscale or three subscales, as assessed by Cronbach's alpha,\nwas good. The test\u00adretest reliability at scale level suggests\nthat scores on the ER-QLS are stable over a 1-week period.\nThe construct validity of the ER-QLS was supported by\npredicted correlations with the WHOQOL-BREF, the SEES\nand also the known-groups component of construct valid-\nity, whereby people at the beginning of an exercise referral\nprogramme displayed lower total QoL ratings than those at\nthe midpoint or end of the programme. This range of psy-\nchometric assessments is comparable with other newly\ndeveloped QoL scales reported within the literature (e.g.\nSkevington et al., 2004) and also reflects recommended\npsychometric procedures for evaluating health-related\nquality of life measures (Hays et al., 1993).\nThe sub-domain scores for mental and physical well-\nbeing and also physical activity facilitators were lower for\nstarters than completers. However, no such differences were\nobserved for the injury pain and illness domain. This would\nsuggest that the ER-QLS is particularly sensitive to detect-\ning changes in perceived exercise-related life-quality that\nare related to mental and physical health and also lifestyle\nfactors that facilitate PA. It is also plausible that pain and\ninjury could be associated with, or as a consequence of,\nexercise and in this respect, it would not have been surpris-\ning to observe scores that would reflect a higher incidence\nof pain and/or injury and therefore a lower perceived QoL\nfor this domain; however, this was not the case. Furthermore,\nthe injury pain and illness domain contains only four items\nand these results should be viewed with caution until further\nfield work to assess the responsiveness of the scale is com-\npleted. The small number of items would also account for\nthe lower factor loadings of these items when assessed as a\nsingle-factor solution for the purposes of global scoring\n(Table 7). However, given that frequency of pain (0.39), fre-\nquency of pain management (0.39) and frequency of illness\n(0.37) are approaching the critical value of >0.4, it makes\nmuch more practical sense to suggest that the ER-QLS be\nscored both sub-dimensionally and globally. Additional\nfield testing that is already underway will contribute to fur-\nther understanding the scales performance in this way.\nWith respect to the acceptability of the ER-QLS, the fre-\nquency of missing responses did not exceed the level of 4per\ncent suggested by Fayers and Machin (2000) as an\nacceptable level for QoL assessments. Data were missing\nmost frequently in response to levels of perceived confidence\nregarding the use of gym equipment (n\n=\n8). It is likely that\nthis item was missed by some respondents because not all\nthose who completed the test measure were referred to a lei-\nsure centre that required the use of gym equipment. Some\nrespondents were referred into group exercise classes or\nswimming, for example. While the ER-QLS is intended for\nuse in settings whereby it is typical that those referred make\nuse of gym equipment, further field testing may indicate that\nthe ER-QLS has the capacity to be used more broadly and if\nthis is the case, this question may require an amendment to\nreduce the potential for missing responses.\nThe ER-QLS is unique in that it represents the first\nmeasure of life-quality to be designed specifically for exer-\ncise referral. Angermeyer et al. (2001) have asserted that\ngeneric QoL assessments, such as the EQ-5D, cannot\nreplace specific instruments which cover the characteristic\nliving conditions of a particular patient group. This view-\npoint perhaps explains why there are so many measures of\nlife-quality available that have been designed to focus upon\na specific population or disease state (e.g. Kolotkin et al.,\nAt every phase of the current research, the ER-QLS was\ndesigned with the assessment of exercise-related life-qual-\nity in mind. This body of work employed a patient-/client-\nfocussed approach to item generation. Consequently,\nparticipants who were representative of the population for\nwhom the measure is intended have acted as the primary\nsource for shaping conceptual understandings of what indi-\ncators represent exercise-related life-quality. Each phase of\nscale construction and validation were purposefully tar-\ngeted towards establishing the final scale into a meaningful\nmeasure of life-quality, and the structural analysis and\nexploration of convergent validity have provided valuable\ninsights into the domains of life-quality that are particularly\nrelevant to the evaluation of exercise referral programmes,\nnamely, mental and physical well-being, injury pain and ill-\nness and physical activity facilitators.\nIn summary, these correlation analyses suggested that the\nmental and physical well-being domain of the ER-QLS is\nmost closely aligned with those aspects of QoL assessed by\nmore generic measures (e.g. WHOQOL-BREF). However,\nthe ER-QLS offers added value and specificity because it is\nlikely that the wording of items within the mental and physi-\ncal well-being domain will be more meaningful for respond-\nents as they specifically relate to exercise behaviour.\nConvergent validity analysis also suggested that the\ninjury pain and illness and the physical activity facilitators\ndomains both target indices of life-quality that distinguish\ntheER-QLSscalefrommoregenericmeasures.Specifically,\nconvergent validity analysis suggested that the injury pain\nand illness domain of the ER-QLS targets physical indica-\ntors of life-quality and the physical activity facilitators\ndomain targets primarily physical but also psychological\n10 Health Psychology Open \nand environmental aspects of life-quality. However, as\nmentioned previously, the wording of items contained\nwithin these domains results in a measure that is more\nsuited to exercise referral. For example, one of the items\ngrouped into the injury pain and illness domain asks, `How\nmuch does any injury you may have prevent you from\nbeing physically active?' One of the items grouped into the\nphysical activity facilitators domain asks, `How confident\nare you that you can exercise in a leisure centre with mini-\nmum support?'Therefore, the ER-QLS can measure aspects\nof QoL that are beyond the scope of generic measures and\nthus provide outcome measurement that is potentially more\nsuccessful in reflecting the concerns of those referred and\nwho implement exercise referral programmes.\nAgain, this is aligned with the aim of the development of\nhealth-related QoL measures that target indicators particu-\nlarly relevant to the ill-health condition for which they have\nbeen constructed (e.g. Doward et al., 2003; Las Hayas et al.,\n2006); although it is worth noting that the measurement of\nlife-quality and health-related life-quality is a complex phe-\nnomenon, and the experience of illness can further compli-\ncate endeavours to capture these valuable data. The ER-QLS\nis no exception to these challenges, particularly given that\nthe population for whom the scale is intended is likely to\npresent with a range of illnesses and co-morbidities as\nreflected in the samples of participants used to validate the\nmeasure. While the psychometric properties of the ER-QLS\nwould suggest that the scale can reliably measure exercise-\nrelated QoL (as demonstrated through the test\u00adretest analy-\nsis), and that known-groups validity indicates that the scale\nmay also detect changes in QoL over time, it is not unusual\nfor the course of some illnesses to affect a person's ability to\nmaintain exercise and therefore contribute to improvements\nin perceived life-quality. Furthermore, and as mentioned pre-\nviously, there is also the possibility that for some health con-\nditions, an increase in PA could increase perceptions of pain\nand discomfort, and this may be reflected in the global and\ninjury pain and illness sub-domain score of the ER-QLS.\nHealth and exercise practitioners have a growing inter-\nest in capturing more holistic outcomes from varied inter-\nventions designed to tackle health inequalities and reduce\ndisease. Consequently, measures of life-quality have been\nAlongside physiological indices, such measures have a key\nrole to play in monitoring health outcomes at the patient/\nclient level. However, generic QoL may be more difficult to\nmeasure than disease- or population-specific QoL, espe-\ncially given that there is little agreement regarding how to\nease- or population-specific measures attempt to navigate\nthis difficulty, inadequate explanations of precisely what\nthese instruments measure, and the lack of any theoretical\nor conceptual considerations, ultimately make the claims\nregarding the specificity and sensitivity of these QoL meas-\nures difficult to understand.\nThe ER-QLS is a reliable and valid measure of exercise-\nrelated life-quality that has been developed from a mixed\nmethodological research approach, which has included pur-\nposeful phases of research to meet the overarching research\naim. A particular strength of the resultant scale is that it\nresponds directly to recent NICE (2014) guidance regard-\ning the necessity for schemes to monitor quality of life out-\ncomes and provides practitioners with a tool specifically\ndesigned for this purpose. A 22-item scale means that it is\nnot overly burdensome on respondents or scheme person-\nnel and has the capacity to be combined with additional\nevaluative measures. However, a current limitation of the\nscale is that until data are collected from a number of\nschemes across the United Kingdom, which has started to\nintegrate the ER-QLS into practice, it is unknown what the\npractical application and feasibility of the scale will be.\nFeasibility considerations related to the integration of new\nscales into practice are shared by all newly constructed\nmeasures and these considerations will be addressed in fur-\nther field testing.\nWhile the ER-QLS is intended to support psychological\noutcome assessment, it is of critical importance that more\nprocess-related factors are not overlooked. This is particu-\nlarly important given that exercise referral schemes are\nessentially tasked with supporting changes in PAbehaviour.\nFor example, behaviour change counselling such as moti-\nvational interviewing (Miller and Rollnick, 2012) and the\nuse of qualitative methods should be encouraged to contrib-\nute to supporting exercise and PA behaviour in the long-\nterm. The ER-QLS is intended to contribute to the ongoing\ndevelopment of the evidence base for the broader impact of\nexercise referral schemes. More specifically, the scale\nresponds to recent recommendations to include health-\nrelated life-quality outcome measures within evaluation\nprotocols (NICE, 2014) but with the added value of rele-\nvance, appropriateness and the capacity for consistency of\nmeasurement across schemes globally.\n"
