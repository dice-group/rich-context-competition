    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This study simulated whether increased community health center (CHC) fund-\ning under the Bush administration narrowed racial/ethnic gaps in access to care among\nlow-income people. Expanded CHC funding resulted in small increases in access to care,\nmore so for minorities than for whites. Spanish-speaking Hispanics had the largest improve-\nments in access in the simulation. However, minorities experienced bigger drops in insur-\nance coverage. The net result was no improvements in the access measures for Spanish-\nspeaking Hispanics and slight decreases in access for whites, English-speaking Hispanics,\nand African Americans. Access gaps either remained the same or worsened slightly for Eng-\nlish-speaking Hispanics and African Americans relative to whites.

CHCs also disproportionately serve\ncent were African Americans.6\nThis study estimates the effects of CHCs and insurance coverage on access to\ncare by race and ethnicity, and it simulates whether expanded funding for CHCs\nnarrowed the gaps in access to care between whites and minority groups. Since ra-\ncial and ethnic minorities use CHCs more than non-Hispanic whites do, federal\ninvestments in CHCs should narrow differences in access. However, a growing\ngap in insurance coverage between whites and racial/ethnic minorities might frus-\ntrate this goal.\nn Previous studies. Marsha Lillie-Blanton and Catherine Hoffman reviewed\nfour multivariate analyses of the role of health insurance coverage in explaining ra-\ncial/ethnic disparities in access to health care.7 With one exception, these studies\nfound that differences in health insurance coverage between whites, Hispanics, and\nAfrican Americans accounted for a sizable share of the differences in having a usual\nsource of care. Two of these studies also examined the effects of area resources and\nfound that they explained very little of the difference in access to care.8 Another un-\npublished study also found only a weak relationship between a county's broadly de-\nfined safety-net resources and access to care.9\nThese studies shared two major limitations: They used indirect measures of\nsafety-net capacity, and, more importantly, they did not account for possible endo-\ngeneity bias in both insurance coverage and safety-net capacity. Endogeneity bias re-\nfers to the difficulty of disentangling the direction of causation between insurance\ncoverage, CHC capacity, and access to care. For example, CHCs might be more\nlikely to locate in areas with poor access or high rates of uninsurance, or greater lo-\ncal CHC capacity might influence some people to forgo insurance coverage.\nIn previous work, Jack Hadley and Peter Cunningham showed that safety-net\navailability, measured by the distance to the nearest safety-net provider, is in fact\nendogenous and that failure to adjust for endogeneity understated the estimated\nimpact of safety-net proximity on access.10 Using an appropriate statistical\nmethod, they found that greater proximity to safety-net providers has a statisti-\ncally significant and positive effect on several measures of access to care.11\nIn a study of the effects of insurance coverage and safety-net capacity on having\na usual source of care, Cunningham and Hadley used an improved measure of\nsafety-net availability (total grant revenues received by federally qualified CHCs\nwithin a five-mile radius of survey respondents) and treated both insurance cover-\nage and safety-net capacity as endogenous.12 After adjusting for endogeneity bias,\ntheir study concluded that both insurance coverage and safety-net capacity have\npositive effects on having a usual source of care.\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We based our simulations on statistical models that treat both in-\nsurance coverage and safety-net capacity as endogenous variables but used an im-\nproved measure of safety-net capacity: total CHC grant revenues per poor person\nwithin a five-mile radius of survey respondents. This measure captured both the ab-\nsolute capacity of nearby CHCs and the potential demand for care from CHCs by\npoor people. We extended this earlier work by allowing all effects to vary by race\nand ethnicity and by distinguishing between English- and Spanish-speaking His-\npanics (based on whether the interview was conducted in Spanish or English) in esti-\nmating the access models and comparing the effects of coverage and CHC capacity.13\nStudy Data And Methods\nn Data. The analysis used data from three rounds of the CTS survey, conducted\nvey conducted primarily in sixty randomly selected communities in thirty-four\nstates and the District of Columbia.14 Since CHCs primarily serve low-income peo-\nple, the analysis sample was limited to nonelderly people with incomes below 300\npercent of the federal poverty level. The total sample size is 47,992 people catego-\nrized into four racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics interviewed in\nEnglish, Hispanics interviewed in Spanish, and African Americans.15 We distinguish\nbetween English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanics because prior research indicates\nthat Spanish-speaking Hispanics have a much higher uninsurance rate, are much\nmore likely to be noncitizens, and generally have less access to public insurance or\njobs that offer private insurance than is true for English-speaking Hispanics.16 Span-\nish speakers might also be more likely than English speakers to use CHCs, which of-\nten provide on-site interpreters and might be more culturally sensitive.17\nn Access measures and statistical estimation. We analyzed two measures of\naccess to care: whether the person has a usual source of care, and whether the person\nhad any ambulatory care visits with a health professional in the previous year. Hav-\ning a usual source of care is an important indicator of whether a person is likely to be\nable to obtain care if needed, while having had at least one ambulatory care visit is a\nmarker for whether the person was able to realize a perceived need for care by actu-\nally seeing a health care provider.\nCHC capacity is defined as the amount of CHC grant revenue per poor person\n(family income less than 100 percent of poverty) within five miles of the survey re-\nspondent.18 We identified all CHCs within five miles of each respondent using in-\nformation on the latitudes and longitudes of CHCs' and survey respondents' five-\ndigit ZIP codes. We then summed the CHCs' grant revenues (obtained from the\nUniform Data System maintained by the Health Resources and Services Adminis-\ntration, Bureau of Primary Health Care) within a five-mile radius of each survey\nrespondent as an indicator of CHCs' financial capacity to provide care to unin-\nsured people.19 Total CHC grant revenue was then divided by the number of poor\nS a f e t y N e t\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

To allow the results to vary with race/\nethnicity, all of the models' independent variables were interacted with dummy\nvariables for race/ethnicity (English-speaking Hispanic, Spanish-speaking His-\npanic, and African American relative to non-Hispanic white).20 We estimated the\nmodels' parameters using instrumental variable estimation to test and adjust for\npotential endogeneity bias.21\nStudy Findings\nn Levels of access by race/ethnicity, insurance status, and CHC capacity.\nRegardless of race, ethnicity, and the level of nearby CHC capacity, insured people\nhave better access to care than uninsured people (Exhibit 1). In no case, moreover, is\nthe level of access for the uninsured with a high level of CHC capacity greater than\nfor the insured with no nearby CHCs. Within each of the two insurance-status\ngroups, non-Hispanic whites tend to have the best levels of access, while Spanish-\nspeaking Hispanics have the worst.\nD a t a W a t c h\nMean Percentages With A Usual Source Of Care Or An Ambulatory Care Visit, By\nInsurance Status, Community Health Center (CHC) Capacity, And Race/Ethnicity,\nInsured (%) Uninsured (%)\nDependent variable\nNo\nCHC\nLow\nHigh\nNo\nCHC\nLow\nHigh\nUsual source of care\nAll low income\nWhite non-Hispanic\nHispanic English-speaking\nHispanic Spanish-speaking\nAfrican American\nAmbulatory care visit\nAll low income\nWhite non-Hispanic\nHispanic English-speaking\nHispanic Spanish-speaking\nAfrican American\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations of data from the Community Tracking Study Household Surveys, Rounds Two\u00adFour, 1998\u00ad\na Less than or equal to the median value for those with positive CHC (community health center) availability.\nb Greater than the median value for those with positive CHC availability.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Among the uninsured, non-\nHispanic whites and English-speaking Hispanics with no CHCs within five miles\nappear to have better access than similar people with high levels of CHC availabil-\nity. However, for Spanish-speaking Hispanics and African Americans, the propor-\ntion with an ambulatory care visit increases monotonically as CHC capacity in-\ncreases. However, the usual-source-of-care measure suggests that there is little\ndifference between no CHC availability and a low level of CHC availability.\nThese ambiguities are indicative of endogeneity bias. Since CHCs are more\nlikely to locate in areas with poor access to care, the observed relationship be-\ntween CHCs and access probably understates the true effect. The association be-\ntween insurance status and access looks more clear-cut. However, its magnitude\ncould also be biased if people who have a strong preference for having a usual\nsource of care or who anticipate using medical services are more likely to seek in-\nsurance coverage.\nn Multivariate regression estimates. The statistical tests indicated the pres-\nence of significant endogeneity bias and supported the use of instrumental variable\nanalysis to estimate the multivariate regression models. The resulting parameter es-\ntimates are generally much larger in magnitude than parameters estimated without\nthe adjustment for endogeneity bias.22 The multivariate results indicate (1) that the\nuninsured are much less likely than the insured to report having either a usual\nsource of care or an ambulatory care visit in the past year, and (2) that people who\nlive in areas with greater CHC capacity are more likely than those not living in such\nareas to have a usual source of care and an ambulatory care visit in the past year.\nThe multivariate results also imply that insurance status has the same effects on\naccess in each of the racial and ethnic groups. However, CHC capacity appears to\nhave a bigger impact on minorities' reporting that they have a usual source of care\nthan it does for white non-Hispanics. The CHC capacity measure shows smaller\ndifferences across racial and ethnic groups in affecting ambulatory care visits: The\nonly statistically significant difference is between African Americans and non-\nHispanic whites.\nn Simulations of changes in insurance status and CHC capacity. To provide\ninformation about associations between variations in insurance status and CHC ca-\npacity and the relative magnitudes of changes in the access measures, we used the\nmultivariate regression models to simulate the effects of four hypothetical policy\nchanges: (1) reduce the uninsurance rate by 5 percent for each racial/ethnic group;\n(2) eliminate uninsurance (enact universal coverage); (3) increase aggregate CHC\ngrants by about $250 million, which mimics the Bush administration's increase in\nsimilar to the national changes between 2000 and 2004 and simultaneously increase\nCHC capacity by $250 million. (This fourth simulation approximates the national\nexperience since 2000 and addresses the primary policy question raised here.)\nS a f e t y N e t\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The effects are some-\nwhat larger on the probability of reporting a usual source of care than on the prob-\nability of having an ambulatory care visit, and also larger for minorities than for\nnon-Hispanic whites. Thus, the simulations also suggest that with one exception,\nboth policies would reduce disparities in access between non-Hispanic whites\nand racial/ethnic minorities. (The one exception is that an increase in CHC capac-\nity increases the probability of having an ambulatory care visit by the same\namount for English-speaking Hispanics as for non-Hispanic whites.)\nSpanish-speaking Hispanics appear to benefit the most from both policies. If\nuninsurance were eliminated, access would increase the most for Spanish-speak-\ning Hispanics because they by far have the highest initial level of uninsurance.\nHowever, even these substantial improvements in access would reduce the gap be-\ntween them and non-Hispanic whites by only about half.\nD a t a W a t c h\nPolicy Changes' Simulated Effects On Community Health Center (CHC) Access\nPercent with access measure, by race and ethnicity\nAccess measure and policy change\nNon-Hispanic\nwhite\nHispanic\nEnglish-\nspeaking\nHispanic\nSpanish-\nspeaking\nAfrican\nAmerican\nBaseline (simulated)a\nSimulated change in access (percentage points)\nReduce uninsurance by 5%b\nEliminate uninsurance\nIncrease CHC grants by $250 millionc\nand $250 million increase in CHC grants\nBaseline (simulated)a\nSimulated change in access (percentage points)\nReduce uninsurance by 5%b\nEliminate uninsurance\nIncrease CHC grants by $250 millionc\nand $250 million increase in CHC grants\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations of data from the Community Tracking Study Household Surveys, Rounds Two\u00adFour, 1998\u00ad\na Assigns people the average probability of being uninsured for their racial/ethnic group (.216 for non-Hispanic whites, .285 for\nEnglish-speaking Hispanics, .489 for Spanish-speaking Hispanics, and .25 for African Americans).\nb Assumes a 5 percent reduction in uninsurance for each racial/ethnic group.\nc Increases the value of the CHC capacity variable by $7.50 per poor person for all cases, including those in areas without any\nCHCs.

Moreover, mi-\nnority groups' access appears to be more responsive to changes in insurance cover-\nage and CHC capacity than non-Hispanic whites' access. Thus, if policy changes\nwere targeted equally to all low-income people, the gaps in access between whites\nand nonwhites should be reduced. However, although eliminating uninsurance\nwould have a sizable impact on minorities' access levels, it would not eliminate ac-\ncess gaps completely.\nThe simulations also suggest that the Bush administration's CHC expansion\nmight have offset much of the adverse effects on access of the recent increases in\nuninsurance. However, it is important to emphasize that the measures analyzed in\nthis study represent only the most basic forms of access. Although they are impor-\ntant indicators of access to primary and first-contact care, they might not capture\nvariations in access to specific types of care (such as specialists, prescription\ndrugs, expensive therapeutic procedures, or hospital care) or the total amount of\ncare received. Investigating the relationships between insurance status and CHC\ncapacity on these additional access measures is important for obtaining a com-\nplete picture of the extent to which CHCs fully substitute for insurance coverage.\nAnother limitation is that the simulations did not distinguish between effects\nin rural and urban areas. CHCs are less widely available in rural areas; when they\ndo exist, they tend to treat more privately insured and fewer Medicaid or unin-\nsured people than urban CHCs.23 (In the data used in this analysis, only 13.4 per-\ncent of nonmetropolitan residents lived within five miles of a CHC, compared\nwith 42.1 percent of metropolitan residents; among those within the five-mile ra-\ndius, 20.5 percent of the nonmetropolitan sample were uninsured and 16.9 percent\nS a f e t y N e t\n\"Although eliminating uninsurance would have a sizable impact on\nminorities' access levels, it would not eliminate access gaps.\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Thus, the impact of ex-\npanded CHC funding in rural areas might be more sensitive to whether new\nCHCs are established, compared to urban areas where existing CHC capacity\ncould be a more limiting factor.\nIt is also important to emphasize that the simulations of expanding CHC ca-\npacity were relatively crude and did not attempt to replicate the actual changes in\nCHC capacity resulting from the Bush administration's increases in CHC funding.\nNor did the simulations distinguish between expansions of existing CHCs and\nfunding new CHCs in areas that do not have any. Future research should examine\nthe impacts on access to care in communities that specifically expanded CHC ca-\npacity under the Bush administration's policy, distinguishing between rural and\nurban communities and between newly established CHCs and expansions of ex-\nisting CHCs.\nIn spite of these limitations, the simulations illustrate the importance of adjust-\ning for the endogeneity bias, which tends to be inherent in nonrandomized obser-\nvational data, when drawing policy implications from multivariate regression sta-\ntistical analysis. Without the adjustment for endogeneity bias, the analysis would\nhave implied that CHC capacity does not have a significant and positive effect on\naccess, especially for racial and ethnic minorities. By using an appropriate statisti-\ncal method, our analysis leads to the important policy implication that expanding\nCHC capacity would be valuable for helping to reduce access disparities even if\ninsurance coverage expands. The findings also suggest that further expansions in\nCHC capacity will be needed to maintain access to care if insurance coverage con-\ntinues to decline.\nTheresearchforthisstudywassupportedbyagrantfromtheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundationtotheCenterfor\nStudyingHealthSystemChange(HSC).TheauthorsgratefullyacknowledgeJamesReschovskyofHSCforhis\nhelpfulcommentsonapreliminarydraftofthispaper,CynthiaSaiontz-MartinezofSocialandScientificSystems\nforexcellentcomputerprogrammingassistance,andGretchenNowlinofHSCforhelpwithmanuscript\npreparation.\nNOTES\n1.
