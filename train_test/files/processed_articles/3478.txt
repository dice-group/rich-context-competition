    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article describes a series of studies of young children's experience of place in which parents\nacted as co-researchers, collecting and analysing data. This approach to research resulted in an\nemphasis on sensory engagement and embodied experience, for both adults and children. As my\nown young daughter accompanied me during this research, the boundaries between parent and\nresearcher were further blurred. As research progressed, parents became increasingly critical of\npathologising discourses about parenting, and stated more strongly the expertise they possessed\nin their own children. Collaborative research with parents opened up new possibilities for\nunderstanding the perspectives of very young children, by drawing on the expertise parents have.\n",

Largely as a solution to balancing my studies\nwith motherhood, my daughter Izzy would accompany me on my visits to the museum\nwith families during this research.\nThis article draws on five years of research with parents and their young children in\ncommunities in northern England. During my doctoral research and beyond it, I continue\nto research collaboratively with some of the same parents. Their participation in the\nresearch has increased over time, from traditional ethnographic participants to co-\nresearchers, working with me to shape research questions, collect and analyse data and\nmost recently, to act as a research advisory board for a project. Here I describe the pro-\ncesses of doing collaborative research with parents. In addition, I describe some of the\nfindings this research has surfaced. The decentring of academic knowledge in the meth-\nodology led to a foregrounding of materiality, emplaced knowing and children's and\nadults' sensory engagement with places. The presence of my own daughter during field\nwork and collaboration addressed power imbalances in the research encounter to some\nextent, by blurring the boundaries between researchers and participants (Tillman-Healy,\n2003). Over time, the parent-researchers also began increasingly to voice their own\nexpertise in their children, coupled with a growing critique of pathologising discourses\nabout parenting.\nWhat do parents know?\nInterested in the multimodal nature of young children's communication (Flewitt, 2005;\nKress, 1997), my attention in the video described in the above vignette was initially\ndrawn to Izzy's scant use of words and the importance of her gaze and facial expressions,\nas we exchanged ideas for several minutes about our planned museum visit. However,\nthis video interview also marked the beginning of my thinking about the expertise par-\nents have in their own children, and ways in which more collaborative approaches to\nresearch could be employed to connect with this knowledge.\nThere are multiple of ways in which parents have expertise in their young children\nthat differ from academic expertise. In the interview with Izzy described at the beginning\nof this article, I became aware of three aspects of parental expertise; firstly, I was better\nable to identify her words than a stranger (no one else could tell the words she was saying\nwere `mushroom, strawberry, grape'). Secondly, certain aspects of non-verbal communi-\ncation had established meanings for Izzy and I, which added context to our exchange. An\nexample of this is Izzy's `big smile', a grimace like expression, which she tended to\nmake every time she was asked to pose for a photo. Izzy made her `big smile' during our\nconversation to indicate how she would approach other children in the museum. Thirdly,\nparents often know the wider context of their children's lives best; `mushroom, straw-\nberry, grape' referred to dressing up outfits that used to be at a certain local museum and\nwere no longer there.\nMayall (2000) argues for the need to `extricate children, conceptually, from parents,\nthe family and professionals' (2000: 243) in order to fully understand childhood. Whilst\nI would concur, research seeking to understand the lives of very young children requires\ndifferent methods, and as a result, the social studies of childhood literature on the lives\nand experiences of children aged under five years is sparse (MacNamee and Seymour,\n2013; Warming, 2011). In working with parents as co-researchers, I do not attempt to\nprivilege the voices of parents over the children themselves. Rather, I propose co-research\nwith parents as a way of better understanding the realities of young children, by drawing\non their parents' accounts and interpretations in addition to other forms of knowing,\nparticularly participatory ethnographic research with the children themselves. Mayall\nunderstanding childhood. In my collaborative research with parents, tacit, experiential\nforms of knowledge were foregrounded, adding an additional perspective on how we as\nadults might know about the lives of young children.\nFive years of collaborative research with parents has expanded the initial observations\nI outlined above about what parents might know, to encompass a broader view of the\nexpertise parents can bring to research about their children. Parents know about their\nchildren through being with them, spending extended periods of time with them, and the\ndaily embodied experience of parenting them. In collaborative research with parents,\nchildren's lived, embodied experiences (Pink, 2009), the materiality of place (Hultman\nand Lenz Taguchi, 2010), and experiential and procedural forms of knowing (Niedderer,\n2007) became very significant in our findings.\nThe relationship between parents and childhood research\nSome of the earliest scientific studies of child development involved researchers making\ndetailed records of their own children's behaviour, Darwin and Piaget being two of the\nmost famous examples (Poveda, 2009). More recently, a growing need to re-balance the\nover-representation of white middle-class children in research on children's develop-\nment, learning and language (Ochs and Schiefflin, 1984) has led to ethnographic studies\nin which researchers have explicitly focused on under-represented groups and their lin-\nguistic, parenting and socialising practices. Within these more etic approaches to ethno-\ngraphic research, several researchers have discussed the implications of researchers\nbeing parents themselves while doing research with children and families (Cassell, 1987;\nLevey, 2009). For example, Theophano and Curtis (1996) describe how, during ethno-\ngraphic research in an Italian American community, they were positioned and treated\ndifferently by the community because Theophano was a married mother whilst Curtis\nwas single.\nResearchers who are perceived by participants as parents have found that this has led\nto opportunities to build rapport with other adults (McGrath, 1998; Wylie, 1987) and\noffered a way of connecting with other children (Adler and Adler, 1996; Poveda, 2009).\nMcGrath (1998) touches on this potential for a deeper connection with others in her\ndescription of parenting her own child alongside Tongalese mothers during fieldwork.\nThere is something deeper available, closer to empathy that emerges as a result of sharing\nFew studies have positioned parents as co-researchers. Adler and Adler (1996) describe\ntheir longitudinal research on pre-adolescent school children, through observing their\nown children and the children of others in their children's school and community. Loizou\n(2013) describes a parenting programme in which parents were invited to act as action\nresearchers, employing the tools of an action research methodology, in order to identify\nand explore solutions to various parenting issues they faced. Liebenberg's (2009) study\ninvolved asking teenage mothers to photograph their everyday mothering experiences,\ncreating a set of images which formed the basis of interviews. My research builds on this\nsmall body of research in which parents played a more active role in collecting and ana-\nlysing data about their own children, by placing a particular emphasis on foregrounding\nthe expertise parents themselves have.\nThe intensification of parenting within policy discourses (Gillies, 2007) has led to a\ntendency to hold parents accountable for their children's `proper'development (Nichols\net al., 2009). Parents may therefore be pathologised by research (Burman, 2007) and\npolicy (Clarke, 2006) for failing to parent in culturally specific ways. In this way, par-\nents may become positioned as a threat to their children's `proper' development, whilst\nchildhood research may be seen as the `solution' to these perceived risks to children's\nnormative development (Burman, 2007; Gillies, 2007). Rather than create an opposi-\ntional dichotomy between parents as unknowledgeable and a threat to children's devel-\nopment and research as a source of expertise and solutions, parents as co-researchers is\na methodology seeking to emphasise the commonalities between parenting and child-\nhood research. Both endeavours are emotional, engaged identity work, in which certain\nkinds of understandings about children's experiences may become apparent, whilst\nother aspects remain mysterious and unknowable (Elwick et al., 2014). Parents con-\nstantly observe their children and make interpretations about their behaviour (Nichols,\n2002). Researchers interested in the everyday lives of young children must also observe,\nshare experiences and try to make interpretations in order to begin to feel a connection\nwith their young participants' perspectives (for example, Warming, 2011). Researchers\nare sometimes also parents. Reflecting on the experience of her own children accompa-\nnying her during fieldwork, Joan Cassell describes the relationship between being a\nparent and a researcher thus,\nFieldwork is a profound and emotional experience.... In parenting, we also risk ourselves.\nChildren are fragile links between our past and future, fears and hopes... We are doubly at\nrisk, then, when our children are in the field. In attempting to learn and grow, we risk failure\nand sorrow, our own and theirs. In exposing ourselves, we expose them. (Cassell, 1987:\nParents as co-researchers: describing the methodology\nThe insights in this article are drawn from a series of ethnographic studies I carried out\nwith a small group of parents in northern England. Following an ethnographic doctoral\nstudy of 2 to 4 year-old children's meaning making in a museum (Hackett, 2014) and\ninspired by the literature on collaborative approaches to ethnography (Lassiter et al,\n2004; Pahl and Pool, 2011), I initially invited some of the parents from my original\nstudy to return with me to the museum. These three parents had younger children,\nsiblings of the original participants, aged between 13 and 18 months. As with the\noriginal study, I was accompanied in the field by my own daughter (by now 36 months).\nTherefore in this scenario, each adult was both a parent and a co-researcher in the field.\nDuring this follow up visit, all four parents (including myself) used a FLIP video cam-\nera to collect visual data, and wrote fieldnotes following the visit. We subsequently\nmet as a group at my house to share our different versions of the fieldnotes and analyse\nthem together.\nThe second study, `Parents as Researchers', involved three parents who had partici-\npated in my doctoral study. We jointly agreed a research question `How do our children\nlearn when they go to different places?', informed by parents' concerns that there were\nfew options for keeping their children busy and engaged during the summer holiday\nbreak. In this community, parents were generally on a low income, and no one in the\nstudy drove. Therefore, once the local Children's Centre scaled back its provision for\nthe summer break, options were limited to the local park or occasional soft play visit.\nTo address this concern, over a summer, we visited a park, a farm and the seaside with\nour children, aged between 24 and 48 months. All four of us collected visual data in the\nform of photographs which we compiled and annotated in scrapbooks, in order to record\nour children's learning and engagement in these different places. We met as a group\nthree times during and following these visits to share, discuss and analyse the\nscrapbooks.\nThe third study this article draws on was part of a wider Canada SSHRC funded pro-\nject, Community Arts Zone. My research within this project sought to understand chil-\ndren's emplaced meaning making through den building. In this study, two of the parents\ninvolved in the previous studies acted as a research advisory group, advising on the\ndirection of the project. In addition, these parents also collected data (fieldnotes and\nvideo footage) during some of the den building events and analysed the data through a\nseries of group meetings. Once again we were accompanied by some of our children,\naged between 10 months and 6 years, at some of the den building events. Table 1 sum-\nmarises the parent-researchers and children in each of the three studies, and the role each\nparent-researcher played in each study.\nThe dataset this article draws on has been collected and analysed by both myself and\nthe other parent-researchers, over a period of three years. It includes video footage, field\nnotes, annotated scrapbooks of photograph and notes from a series of group meetings in\nwhich we analysed the data. This dataset is summarised in Table 2.\nThroughout this research, parents collaborated with me in different ways, at different\ntimes. For example, in the first study, parents primarily contributed to data collection.\nThe second project expanded on the collaboration, with parents helping to frame the\nresearch questions, and collect and analyse data. In the third project, parents advised on\nthe research questions and direction of the project, as well as collecting and analysing\nsome of the data. There are some aspects of the research process which the parents have\nnot been involved in, in some cases because they don't have time or inclination, such as\nreviewing the literature. Other aspects of the research process, such as writing together,\nwe hope to do together in the future. Overall, the process of collaborating with parents as\nco-researchers has been slow, emergent and exploratory, rather than pre-planned. For me\nit has been an experiment in different approaches to collaboration. For the parents,\ninvolvement has built up incrementally, as individuals have felt their way into doing\nresearch, whilst deciding how and whether they want to participate. Tillman-Healy\n(2003) describes a methodology of friendship, during which the researcher works at `the\nnatural pace of friendship' (2003: 724), that is, committing enough time, over a long\nenough time period, for `profound relationships' to develop. In my research, approaches\nto collaboration have developed at the `pace of friendship'; there are ways of working\ntogether now we could not have envisaged five years ago. This way of doing research\ninvolves risk, as the direction of the research is not always predictable and researchers'\nown emotions and personal life become slowly more intertwined with the research site\nTable 1.

The implications of this are epistemological;\nembracing particularity of experiences, alternative interpretations and `points of impos-\nsibility' (2005: 15) and the role of the researcher within the research are starting points\nfor an ethical practice. The long term, collaborative nature of my research means that the\nexperiences, involvement and representation of the families in the study are of para-\nmount ethical importance. The families all invested a lot in this study and therefore,\n`fidelity to commitments made during a research event'(2005: 14) become, I argue, even\nmore important. In developing an ethical parents as co-researchers methodology, key\nconcerns included parents' time and ongoing involvement, consent of both parents and\nchildren, and developing an ethics of care (Banks et al., 2013), as ethical decisions were\nmade as the arose, over long term relationships and in unfolding contexts.\nConsent\nChristensen (2004) argues for the importance of developing an approach to research\nwith children that takes account of children's `cultures of communication' (2004: 166).\nWithin this research, `cultures of communication' for both adults and children were\nunderstood within an ethnographic process of sharing experiences and learning to\nempathise with the viewpoints of others (Pink, 2009). Throughout our collaborations,\nI adopted an approach of ongoing consent, in which individuals made choices about\nthe exact nature of their involvement as the project unfolded. For the young children\nthemselves, assent, by which I mean gaining children's agreement to participate, was\na more appropriate concept than consent (Cocks, 2006; Dockett et al., 2009). For\nCocks (2006), assent is a process of reflexivity for the researcher, and requires ongoing\nwork and attention to ensure the children are happy to be participating in a particular\nway at a particular moment in time. In practice, the children were well able to express\ntheir assent to be involved in the research. For example, children's hunger or tiredness\nwas often a cue for an activity to end. This relational and reflexive process was one that\ninvolved myself and the parent co-researchers throughout the study. We jointly aimed\nto tune in to the children's body language, actions, and words (Dockett et al., 2009), in\norder to make ongoing judgements about whether activities should continue, be can-\ncelled or cut short.\nTime, commitment and ownership\nBeing involved in this research involved considerable time and commitment from par-\nent-researchers over a sustained period. Doing fieldwork with one's young children in\nthe field and writing fieldnotes is hard work. The small number of parents who have\ncontinued to research with me in this way over a number of years have described the\nenjoyment, interest, satisfaction and also increase in confidence being involved has\nbrought them. Equally, there are many other families who have been involved in my\nresearch for shorter periods of time, or not opted to participate as co-researchers. The\nparent co-researchers are, therefore, a self-selecting group.\nBanks et al. (2013) describe the nature of ethical considerations in community\nbased research as going beyond the implementation of abstract rules to encompass\n`dynamic, complex and value-based' negotiations, with `responsibilities attaching to\nof everyday ethics, involving daily processes of negotiating ethical challenges. The\nconcept of everyday ethics resonates in the context of research with parents as co-\nresearchers, in which daily decisions, grounded in personal relationships and commit-\nments were and are made.\nI have described the particularity of the process of my collaborative research with\nparents, with an emphasis on how parents contributed to different aspects of the\nresearch process, and the ethical considerations involved. Next, I present some exam-\nples of the findings emerging from this research, by offering three lenses for under-\nstanding the process of knowledge production in this collaborative methodology.\nFirstly, I describe the importance of emplaced, embodied knowing (Pink, 2009) in the\nresearch findings, and the way in which this offered a counter to propositional notions\nof academic knowledge about children. Secondly, I describe the blurring of roles of\nparent and researcher in the study, drawing on Fine's (1994) notion of working the\nhyphens. This led to an engagement with the subjectivities of what adults can know\nabout young children. Thirdly, I outline the growing sense of entitlement parent-\nresearchers felt in articulating their dissatisfaction with pathologising discourses about\nparenting and the inherent assumptions these discourses make about who holds exper-\ntise about young children.\nEmplaced knowing, collaborative research and the\nde-centring of academic knowledge\nPahl and Pool (2011) describe an approach to collaborative research with young people\nin a school in which the children's different interpretations of the research led them to\nreframe their findings. In this case, approaches to collaborative research draw on post-\nmodernist critiques of dominant assumptions of knowledge as fixed, discoverable and\ndebate about what counts as academic knowledge, Vasudevan (2011) appeals for the\nimportance of `unknowing' in academic research, stressing the processes through which\nmultiple points of view can come to be known, and `unexpected trajectories' open up.\nNiedderer (2007) makes a distinction between propositional, procedural and experiential\nknowledge, pointing out that the privileging of propositional knowledge is common in\nacademia. In contrast, procedural and experiential knowledge are tacit forms of know-\ning, which can only ever be partially communicated in written or spoken language. As\nJohnson (2004) points out, collaborative ethnography is multi-voiced; in The Other side\nof Middletown (2004) this multi-vocality was realised through the writing process. In the\nresearch described in this article, I did not write with the parents, but multi-vocality is\nrepresented in the importance of parents' tacit, lived ways of knowing about young chil-\ndren, which came to dominate the findings of the research.\nMuch data collected during the research about children's experiences of places (muse-\nums, parks, farms, the seaside and cardboard dens) stressed the importance of the mate-\nriality of the place, which the children encountered through their bodies. Susie's account\nof her field notes, given at a group meeting, illustrates the significance of the materiality\nof the museum for her 13 month old daughter Olivia.\nSo she was just walking I think holding hands and doing a lot of crawling, fast crawling. She's\nvery inquisitive and I think like her brother loves people and just kind of watching and listening,\nin terms of what's going on. At the museum, she seemed to be quite excited about grates on the\nfloor, didn't she?... I think she was captivated by that, as well as the grate being on the floor,\nthe metal grate! I think she was making noises, or something with her fingers. And I think that's\nabout all I can remember. (Susie, group discussion, April 2012)\nThe embodied experience of different kinds of places was central to the concerns parents\nvoiced about the limited range of places to go with children during the summer holidays. In\ntalking about the planned trip to the seaside, Leila talked about the chance for her little girl\nLucy (3 years) to experience the sand as being a valuable, special opportunity. Lucy's usual\nexperience of sand was in a sand tray at nursery, and the group were clear that, as Leila put\nit `the sand they play with at nursery is different to the sand at the beach'. The wider context\nof the beach rather than the nursery changed the meaning or experience of the sand itself.\nThe importance of the materiality of place was picked up strongly in the data parent-\nresearchers collected during the beach trip. For example, Janice recorded examples of\nher 2 year old daughter Miriam's embodied experience of the beach. Miriam insisted on\ncrawling for most of the day on the beach with bare legs (despite normally choosing to\nwalk rather than crawl). One image which was particularly significant was a photograph\nJanice took of Miriam sitting on the sand staring out to sea. She appears lost in thought,\nbut for Janice, the significance of this photograph was that Miriam had her hands buried\ndeep in the sand, lifting her hands and running in through her fingers, repeating this\naction over and over again.\nBuilding on notions of embodiment as central to human experience, Pink argues for\nthe significance of emplacement in how people experience the world. Pink (2009: 25)\nargues for the need for research that\nattends to the question of experience by accounting for the relationship between bodies, minds\nand the materiality and sensoriality of the environment.\nHultman and Lenz Taguchi (2010) critique the emphasis post structuralism has placed on\nlanguage and discourse aspects of experience, leading to the creation of human/non-\nhuman binaries. Humans and the material environments are seen instead as `performa-\ntive mutually intra-active agents' (Barad, in Hultman and Lenz Taguchi, 2010: 527,\nemphasis in original), with agency emerging from the interaction between them. In their\nfieldnotes, parent-researchers were pre-occupied with the sand on the beach, and grates\nin the floor, and the ways these were experienced through fingers and knees. This privi-\nleging of the material and the embodied by parent-researchers in the study is related to\nthe kinds of knowledge being drawn on through this methodology, and particularly the\ntacit and relational ways in which parents know their children.\nAn interest in how children's bodies experience place was mirrored in the parent-\nresearchers' own experiences of being in places with their young children, whilst carry-\ning out fieldwork. Doing research with young children was frequently a physically\ndemanding experience, involving carrying, lifting, pushing buggies up hills and running\nafter small children in busy public places. These physical, embodied aspects of doing\nresearch with our young children were something which all parent-researchers in these\nstudies shared. For example, in the following extract from my own fieldnotes, I reflected on\nthese parallel experiences, as I describe holding Tina's daughter Sienna, aged 18 months,\nduring a field visit.\nI held Sienna for a long time, at a height that was awkward, so she could see the models and\nreach the buttons. It reminded me of when Izzy was that age. Tina and I stood next to each\nother, both talking to Sienna in the same sort of way, saying the same sort of things in the same\nslightly high pitched voice \u00ad it made me think about the way in which I am researching with\npeople whose lives I am share so much in common with. The voice, the phrases of speech and\nthe way in which I was holding this heavy little bundle so she could see the thing that was\nfascinating her, were all so familiar because I did all this with Izzy. (Fieldnotes, 15 February\nAs I touch on in these fieldnotes, ways of knowing about the field began for parent-\nresearchers in their own bodies, in the weight of a child in their arms, a certain tone of\nvoice, and in the experience of being in places as parents. As Susie comments\nI think you're just used to running around after them and going through the museum and getting\nto lunchtime's kind of an achievement isn't it, cos it's tiring at times!\n(Susie, group analytic discussion, April 2012)\nThe examples provided above of data collected in the field and chosen for analysis and\ndiscussion by parent-researchers, illustrate the relevance of emplacement for the parent-\nresearchers' ways of understanding young children's engagement with places.\nWorking the hyphens: both parents and researchers\nCoffey (2000) describes the relationship between identity and the field as not fixed, but\nshifting and re-created during the study. Fieldwork during which I researched children\nthe same age as my own, alongside parents who also had children the same age as mine,\nbrought specific aspects of my identity and experience to the fore. During fieldwork, I\nwas perceived as and enacted an identify that was equally parent and researcher, and as\nthe research progressed and I collaborated more and more with the other parents, the\nlines between parent and researcher became increasingly blurred.\nThis blurring of roles aligns this research with the work of feminist and queer scholar-\nship which has sought to resist hierarchical separation between respondent and partici-\npant (Tillman-Healy, 2003). Fine (1994) has used the term `working the hyphens' in her\ncritique of social science researchers' tendency to write about `others' while `occluding\nourselves and our own investments, burying the contradictions that percolate at the\nSelf-Other hyphen.' (1994: 70). For Fine, acknowledging the multiplicity of identities,\nincluding the researcher's and the relationship between these self-other identities is an\nethical practice.\nEroding the fixedness of categories, we and they enter and play with the blurred boundaries that\nproliferate... these `relationships between' get us `better' data, limit what we feel free to say,\nexpand our minds and constrict our mouths, engage us in intimacy, and seduce us into\ncomplicity, make us quick to interpret and hesitant to write. (Fine, 1994: 72)\nDuring analytic discussions, my positionality as a fellow parent was frequently refer-\nenced by the others, through comments such as `as you'll know yourself' and `it's prob-\nably the same with Izzy'. As I have discussed above, this shared sense of experience and\npositionality was embodied in the experience of being in places with children (carrying,\nholding, speaking in a certain way, keeping ever alert as to what the children were doing)\nas much as conceptualised as an identity category. A focus on the embodied experiences\nof children that we were seeking to understand aligns closely with Pink's (2009) approach\nto sensory ethnography, in which `sensoriality is fundamental to how we learn about,\nunderstand and represent other people's lives' (2009: 7). Within this understanding of\nethnography, ethnographers are constantly seeking to access experiences of others which\ncan never be fully accessed. This partiality and subjectivity is described by Pink in her\ndescription of research methodology.\nThis is not so much the gathering of data that the researcher will take away to analyse, but\nrather it is a process of bringing together which involves the accumulation of emplaced ways of\nknowing generated not simply through verbal exchanges but through, for example, cups of tea\nand coffee, comfortable cushions, odours, textures, sounds and images. By sitting with another\nperson in their living room, in their chair, drinking their coffee from one of their mugs, one\nbegins in some small way to occupy the world in a way that is similar to them. (Pink, 2009: 86,\nemphasis in original)\nDuring co-research with parents, two parallel processes of sharing experiences took\nplace. Firstly, as a group of parent-researchers, we shared embodied experiences of par-\nenting during fieldwork, and through this understood or `occupied' each other's worlds\nin a deeper way. Secondly, through research seeking to understand the experiences of our\nyoung children, we as a group of parent-researchers began to imaginatively empathise\n(Pink, 2009) with the emplaced experiences of the children themselves. Much of this\nimagining produced subjective statements about our children's everyday lives. One such\nexample was Janice's discussion of Natasha and Miriam's experiences in the park. She\ndescribed how `Natasha really likes holding ladybirds in her hand, but it's not just seeing\nthem in her hand, it's the feel of their legs, I realise that now'. In this statement, Janice\nmakes a claim to know about the feel of a ladybird's legs on her child's hand, and states\nher belief of the centrality of this embodied sensation to the importance of the trip to the\npark for Natasha.\nIn her discussion of methodological paradigms for researching multisensorily, Dicks\n(2014) makes the distinction between the interest in `looking, listening and touching' of\nmultimodality and ethnomethodology, and the `seeing, hearing and feeling' (2014: 667)\nwith which sensory ethnography is concerned. In attempting to understand inner experi-\nences which may not be observable through external actions, Pink engages with the\nsubjectivities of others' experiences. As Dicks (2014) points out, such ways of knowing\nare not accessible through `discursive representations (such as maps, texts, models,\ninscriptions) that suspend emplaced, moving, being-in-time and therefore abstract from\nThe distinction between discursive and non-discursive ways of knowing and repre-\nsenting takes on a new significance in research with very young children. While phe-\nnomenologically, it is perhaps not possible for anyone to truly understand the experiences\nof any other one (Dicks, 2014), at least in sensory ethnographic research with adults,\nparticipants can produce discursive representations to supplement researcher's sensory\nparticipation. In addition, a researcher's interpretations of the experiences of adults or\nolder children can be checked and discussed with participants themselves. Children aged\nunder three years are unlikely to answer direct interview questions, may not be writing\nor drawing representationally, are perhaps too young to use a camera (Hackett, 2014).\nTherefore, the non-discursive and subjective may take on a new significance in terms of\nhow researchers can understand young children's worlds.\nFollowing her description of ladybird feet, Janice went on to comment\nI do keep thinking more now about the idea that your child is taking something from every\nexperience. Like I was in the park the other day with Natasha and we were looking at the clouds\nand looking for shapes in them, and usually I wouldn't think anything of that, it's just something\nthat we are doing, but I was thinking this time, yes she is learning from this. (Janice, group\nDuring this research, parents' interpretations of the meaning of experiences they and\ntheir children were having in their everyday lives were shifting. At the same time, as co-\nresearchers, parents were attempting to engage with and articulate these shifting, emer-\ngent interpretations. Being co-researchers positioned parents in ways that enabled them\nto articulate these ways of knowing, and validated them.\nDe-pathologising parenthood and childhood: engaging\ncritically with parenting discourses\nBeing parent-researchers involved careful looking and paying attention to children for a\ndifferent reason (doing research) and making permanent records (video, fieldnotes,\nscrapbooks) of moments and incidences which are usually fleeting and given little atten-\ntion. Some examples of these fleeting and often overlooked moments have been pre-\nsented above; grains of sand running through fingers, the grimace meant to indicate a\n`big smile', the feel of ladybird's legs. As discussed above, making records of these\nthings required effort and commitment; it is challenging to parent, observe and record all\nat the same time. However, the lens of research and creation of field records offered\nparents new ways of knowing and talking about their children's experiences.\nTransformations in how parents viewed or interpreted their children's behaviour were\nstrongly articulated by the parents during analytic discussions.All parents were surprised\nwhen looking back over their data by how much was there, and how much their children\nseemed to have done and learned during the field visits.\nBut it's, it seems now she got out probably more than what I thought she'd got out of it. And it's\ninteresting because it makes you more aware by making the notes versus doing a trip\nindependently, and yeah they've been to the museum and they've had a nice time, you know,\nplayed with a couple of things. Makes you, I suppose, analyse and realise that they do actually\nget quite a lot out of these things that they do and things that they look at, makes you a bit more\naware I suppose. (Susie, group analytic discussion, April 2012)\nOne particularly striking example of this is Janice's interpretations of her daughter\nMiriam's quiet, reserved behaviour. The way in which Janice interpreted and gave mean-\ning to Miriam's non-verbal communicative modes changed during the course of her\ninvolvement as a co-researcher. At the beginning of the research in 2012, Janice felt that\nMiriam would be too young to get anything out of a museum visit for some time, and her\nfieldnotes from our museum visit reflected this.\nWe started off with the room that had the pheasant. At this point she didn't show any particular\ninterest in the contents of that room.\nWe then went into the room that housed Nelson the lion. She had a brief ride on the rocking\nzebra. She didn't show any overt reaction to Nelson, but her gaze at him was intent. (Janice's\nMiriam was reserved during the museum visit, and verbally quiet. Initially for Janice,\nMiriam's silence and reserve in the museum was a sign that she was not learning or par-\nticularly engaged during the visit. However, during group analytic discussions a few\nmonths later, Janice commented\nI picked up from your [author's] notes, just like the non-verbal communication, you know like\nthe leaning towards something, you know even if she's in arms, she sort of, you know, leaning\ntowards something to get something. And it's funny cos when we're at home and when it comes\nto feeding, changing, anything it's all non-verbal, you know as a mum you pick up what your\nkid's saying. So I don't know why I didn't link when we go out, to learning, that's why I never\nthought she would benefit from the museum initially, I just thought what's an 18 month-old\nFor Janice, reflecting on and analysing her observations of her daughter, and reading my\nfieldnotes of the same visit, led her to reinterpret the meaning of her daughter's behav-\niour, from disengaged, to rich non-verbal communication which parallels the way Miriam\nmakes her needs known at home. The parents in my research wanted to keep copies of\nthe fieldnotes and the scrapboooks because, they said, `they are important'. Loizou\n(2013) and Liebenberg (2009) both describe how for the parents in their studies, reflect-\ning on the challenges of parenting from the perspective of research helped them to think\nabout issues in a new way. For me, understanding Janice's evolving interpretations of her\ndaughter's behaviour, alongside my own fieldnotes, gave a richer and more nuanced\nunderstanding of Miriam's multimodal meaning making and emplaced engagement at\nthe museum in a wider context of home and family.\nIn Tillman-Healy's (2003) research, the space for participants to tell their stories and\nthink about identities through the production of written texts helped towards self-\nunderstanding and acceptance. The space and permanency of the field records offered\nparents in my study the opportunity to make sense of their own and their children's expe-\nriences in new ways. Over time this led to a growing sense of critical engagement with\npathologising discourses about parents, particularly mothers, and particularly mothers\nfrom poor communities (Clarke, 2006; Gillies, 2007). During Community Arts Zone, in\nwhich parents acted as a research advisory board, analytic discussions turned increas-\ningly from understanding our own children's experiences to commentary on early-years\npedagogy and political discourse. In this way, the fracture lines between the epistemo-\nlogical understandings of knowledge embraced by this research (for example, Vasudevan,\n2011), and the assumptions and narratives of mainstream UK early years policy dis-\ncourses (Clarke, 2006), became increasingly apparent.\nChildren's Centres have a remit to educate the parents, so you always feel, as opposed to you\nknowing your child better than anyone else, that you have to listen to the professionals who\nknow children better than you know children. And when we did the research with Abi, she kept\nemphasising, no one knows your child better than you, that's why I'm getting feedback from\nparents. And it does give you confidence, no it does. Because when you first asked me I was\nlike, uh that's a bit weird, I'm not really qualified to do it, you know. But you are qualified,\nyou're their mum, you're raising your children. (Janice, group discussion, September 2014)\nIn the context of teaching critical literacies to young children in the classroom, Jones\n(2013) makes the point that issues of power and identity are central to whether readers\nfeel `any sense of entitlement' (2013: 220) to analyse and critique dominant discourses.\nApplying Jones' argument about the need for participants to have a sense of entitlement,\nand the role of power and identity in this sense of entitlement, is useful for thinking about\nthe extent to which working with parents as co-researchers provided a sense of empower-\nment. Within discourses of parenting, parents in general, and mothers in particular, can\noften be marginalised (Clarke, 2005; Gilles, 2007). For Janice, the benefit of being a\nco-researcher was that `it reinforces your knowledge of your child'. Therefore, rather\nthan seeing empowerment as a product which could result from my research, I have\nfound it helpful, following Jones (2013) to see the shift in power and agency which par-\ntially came about when parents were positioned as co-researchers, and particularly when\nthey formed the research advisory board, as a process leading towards a growing sense\nof entitlement felt by parents to speak about their own children's learning and their role\nas experts in their own children.\nConcluding thoughts\nIn this article, I have described a way of doing ethnographic research collaboratively\nwith parents in order to understand the lives of young children better. This research is\ngrounded in an appreciation of multiple ways of knowing, and the significance of\nnon-propositional knowledge (Niedderer, 2007) for understanding, or beginning to make\ninterpretations about, the lives and perspectives of young children. For others seeking to\ncarry out similar research, exploring the self-other hyphens (Fine, 1994) between\nresearchers and parents, and adopting a certain kind of epistemological position seems\ncrucial. Mayall (2000) has described how underlying assumptions about the nature of\nchildhood have resulted in both a denial of children's right to be heard, and an increasing\ntendency for professionals to `tell mothers what to do' (2000: 244). During collaborative\nresearch, parent-researchers spoke about both the lack of fit between assumptions about\nchildhood and their own children's lived experiences, and their awareness of profession-\nals seeking to assert claims of authority over parents. Researching collaboratively with\nparents, an approach which attempted to deliberately disrupt the hierarchy between\nresearcher and participant (Tillman-Healy, 2003), foregrounded different kinds of knowl-\nedge (embodied, tacit, subjective), which added depth and texture to understandings\nabout how young children experience places. A recognition of the multiple ways of\nknowing that different adults might bring to understanding the perspectives of young\nchildren, is summarised by Janice, as follows.\nThe only thing I would say, like you did, and this was crucial to me taking part, was to emphasise\nthat the parent is in an equal position, if not greater, to be able to speak on observations about\ntheir child.
