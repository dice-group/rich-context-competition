According to these facts,\nthe distribution of real sales growth depends on the stance of the business cycle. In\nparticular, the skewness of the distribution of real sales growth has been found to be\nmarkedly counter-cyclical. These papers also found that firms in the extreme percentiles\n(i.e. firms with very sharp increases or deceases in real sales) reacted less strongly to\nbusiness cycle conditions than firms with moderate changes in real sales.\nHowever, the insights that may be obtained from this line of research appear to be\nlimited since only results for the whole distribution of firm's real sales growth have\nbeen considered. This is the motivation for the present paper.

Furthermore, we argue that extreme states (i.e. very large increases or\ndecreases of real sales) are prone to extreme movements across the states. In other\nwords, firms with high rates of absolute growth are more volatile than firms with\nmedium growth rates.\nMoreover, the results confirm that it is the change in real aggregated GDP growth,\nrather than its level, which influences firms' within-distribution dynamics. Firms with\nlow growth rates have a higher chance of improving their position during an\nacceleration of real GDP growth, whereas firms with high growth rates face an\nincreased risk of lower growth in the next period. These results are interesting, since\nprevious analyses concentrated on changes in the distribution rather then on the\ndynamics of individual firms' real sales growth.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nEine Reihe von aktuellen Papieren hat versucht, einen Ratschlag Schumpeters\naufzugreifen und stilisierte Fakten des Konjunkturzyklus auf der Ebene einzelner\nFirmen zu untersuchen.

Introduction\nSchumpeter's (1942: 83 ff.) interpretation of capitalism as a process of\n\"creative destruction\", formulated almost half a century ago, has recently been\ndrawn to attention by modern economists again (see, e.g., the work of Aghion and\ntheory of cycles and growth, Schumpeter (1951) emphasised that empirical\nresearch should be directed towards the business cycle behaviour of individual\nfirms. As is well known, macroeconomics took a different approach. The\nrepresentative firm became the workhorse in macroeconomic theory, and\nempirical research concentrated on the behaviour of aggregates. The assumption\nof a representative firm has been viewed with increasing criticism (see e.g.\nKirman, 1992). Models with heterogeneous agents are gaining in popularity (see,\ntry to follow Schumpeter's suggestion and established stylised facts at the firm\nlevel. In particular, these papers document stylised facts for the cross-section\ndistribution of real sales growth rates. According to these facts, the distribution of\nreal sales growth depends on the business cycle position: anti-cyclical skewness\nis a pervasive finding in all three papers. Another key result of those analyses was\n* The authors thank Claudia Buch, Michael Funke, Heinz Herrmann, Harald\nStahl, Ulf von Kalckreuth, an anonymous referee and seminar participants at the\nDeutsche Bundesbank for helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Conclusions from this fact\nwith regard to the behaviour of single firms may be misleading to some extend\nsince only results for the percentiles themselves were obtained. This is the\nmotivation for the present paper.\nFigure 1: Focus on individual firms rather than on distribution\nIn the aforementioned literature, the analysis was centred on the overall\ndistribution of real sales growth rates. In the present paper, we take a closer look\nat the within-distribution dynamics of real sale growth rates, i.e. at the behaviour\nof individual firms, taking the movement of the distribution as given (as in Figure\n1). The aim is to augment the already-established stylised facts with new ones in\nthe vein of Schumpeter. The analysis will be conducted by using non-\nhomogenous Markov chains and estimating the respective transition matrices.\nOur main results may be summarised as follows. We analyse stylised facts\nfor Germany's business cycle at the firm level. Based on longitudinal firm-level\ndata from the Bundesbank's balance sheet statistics covering, on average, 55,000\nfirms per year from 1971 to 1998, we estimate transition probabilities of a firm in\na regime of a certain real sales growth switching to another regime in the next\nDen-\nsity\nDen-\nsity\nBoom\nNormal\ncyclical\nsituation\nperiod. We find that these probabilities depend on the position in the business\ncycle.\nThe remainder of the paper is as follows. In the next section we will briefly\nexplain Markov chains and estimation techniques. Section 3 discusses the data\nset. Some descriptive results with regard to the cross section of transition matrices\nare presented in section 4. Section 5 then deals with the impact of business cycle\nfluctuations on transition probabilities. Section 6 concludes.\n2. Empirical methods\n2.1 Transition probabilities and Markov-chains\nA Markov chain is a stochastic process ^ `\nt\nx with the property that for all t\nk t\n)\nx\n|\nPr(x\n)\nx\n,...,\nx\n,\nx\n|\nPr(x t\nt\nk\nt\nt\nt\nt \n\n\nThe variable t\nx is a state, to be defined later, in which an object is at time t.\nAll m possible states are elements of the vector m\nR\nx  . The Markov property\nthen states that the probability of being in a state at time t+1, i.e. 1\nt\nx  , depends\nonly on the state which the object belonged to in the last period, i.e.\nt\nx . The\nprobabilities are summarised in a transition matrix P of dimension m\nmu where\neach element has the interpretation1\n)\nx\nx\n|\nx\nPr(x\nP i\nt\nj\nt\n1 For a more in depth discussion of Markov chains see Ljungqvist and\nMarkov chains can be either homogenous or non-homogenous2. A Markov\nchain is said to be homogenous if, for every t, the transition matrix   P\nt\nP . In\nthis paper we necessarily assume that the Markov chain is non-homogenous,\notherwise the change from one state to another would be purely random and, thus,\na business cycle interpretation would be pointless. Therefore we will only\nconsider the non-homogenous case. In this case  \nt\np\nij\nis the unobservable\nprobability of moving from state\ni\nx to\nj\nx at time t. What is observable is the\nnumber of objects that move from\ni\nx to\nj\nx at time t denoted by  \nt\nn\nij\n. The\nconditional distribution of   m\nj\nt\nn\nij\n,...,\n, given )\n(t\nn\nix\nis multinomially\ndistributed:\n \n \n   \n\n\nx\nm\nj\nt\nij\nn\nij\nm\nj\nij\ni t\np\n!\nt\nn\n!\nt\nn\nMaximising equation (3) with respect to  \nt\np\nij\n, subject to the constraints\nt\npij t and  \n\u00a6\nm\nj\nt\np , gives us the maximum likelihood estimates for\n \nt\npij :\n \n \n \nt\nn\nt\nn\nt\np\ni\nij\nij\nx\nwhich is the frequency of movements out of a given state\ni\nx to\nj\nx\n2 In earlier discussion this was termed stationary or non-stationary.\nSince nowadays these labels are associated with unit-root processes in time series\nanalysis, for clarity the terms homogenous or non-homogenous are preferable,\ndespite sometimes being used in a different context.\n2.2 Multinomial logit model\nTo gain further insights into the mechanisms that drive the transitions, one\ncan subdivide the population into groups according to characteristics which\nsupposedly influence the process. For each group the transition matrix can be\nestimated. The different matrices can then be compared. This is only possible with\na limited number of discrete characteristics and without inference. A more\npromising approach therefore is to use regression analysis. The appropriate model\nfor the present context is the multinomial logit model (McFadden 1974).\nIn this model, the data are divided into subsamples according to the state the\nobservations were in at time t. Let us define a variable\n^ `\ni\nt\nj\nt\nki x\nx\nx\nx\nif\nj\nY \n for the k-th observation. The state j the k-th\nobservation is in at t+1, conditional on the state i at t, is then a function of some\nindependent variables z: kj\nj\nkj\nki \n\nz\nY \nc . Assuming that the j error terms are\nindependent and identically Gumbel distributed, the probability of being in state j\nis\n\u00a6 c\nc\nJ\nj\ni\n\nk\nz\nj\n\nk\nz\nki\ne\ne\nj)\nProb(Y (5)\nThis is the multinomial logit model. Unfortunately, this model is\nindeterminate, since adding a constant to the E vector results in the same\nprobabilities. Therefore, the model is normalised by setting 0\n1 , leading to the\nprobabilities\n\u00a6\n c\nc\nI\ni\ni\n\nk\nz\nj\n\nk\nz\nk\ne\ne\nj)\nProb(Y (6)\nThis implies that we can compute j-1 log-odds ratios of the form\n)\n\n(\nz\np\np\nln h\nj\nk\nkh\nkj\n\nc\n\u00bb\n\u00bc\n\u00ba\n\u00ab\n\u00ac\n\u00aa\nThe parameters are calculated by maximising the log-likelihood function for\n(6). The estimates then show the change in the probability of being in a state in\nt+1 relative to some base state in t.\nAnother method to model changes across regimes was suggested by\nSpilerman (1972). The sample is again divided into subsamples according to the\nstate the observation is in at time t. A binary dependent variable is created with\nthe properties\n\u00af\n\u00ae\n\n\nz\n\n\n\ni\nt\nk\nt\ni\nt\nj\nt\nij\nx\nx\nj\nk\n,\nx\nx\nif\nx\nx\nx\nx\nif\nThe definition means that a subset of the population is created consisting of\nall observations that are in a specific state at the start of the period. In this subset,\nevery observation is coded as 1 if it moves from state i to j and zero for all other\nmovements. Spilerman suggested using OLS regressions; however, as we know,\nstandard OLS regression leads to heteroscedastic standard errors and to values\ngreater than one or less than zero for binary dependent variables. These problems\ncan be avoided by using a logit regression. The elements of the transition matrix\nthen consist of logistic functions  \nx\n\n c :\n   \n   \u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a9\n\u00a7\nc\nc\nc\nc\nx\n\n\ny\nx\n\n\ny\nx\n\n\ny\nx\n\n\ny\nP\nmm\nmm\n^\n^\n^\n^\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the necessary condition for the maximum of the likelihood function is:\n \n\u00a6 \nw\nw x\ni\nn\nk\nk\nk\nx\n\ny\n\nlnL\nand the vector\ni\nx contains a constant term, it follows that\n\u00a6\n\u00a6\nx\nx\n/\ni\ni n\nk\nk\nn\nk\nijk\nFrom the definition of y it follows that ij\ni\nn\ni\nijk n\ny\n\u00a6\nx\n, which implies:\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\u00a6\n\u00a6\ni\ni\nn\nk\nk\nij\ni\ni\nn\nk\nijk\nn\n\np\nn\ny\nThis means that the average of the predicted probabilities from the\nregression is equal to the predicted transition probability for the whole population.\nAs is clear, all probabilities of moving from one state to another have to add up to\none for each starting state. Therefore, if we use a regression technique for each\npossible movement on its own, we are not taking this dependency into account\nexplicitly. Thus, we estimate both the logit regressions as well as the multinomial\nlogit regressions which, in turn, only give us the relative change in probabilities.\n2.3 Stochastic kernel densities\nIn the previous discussion of the empirical approach, we assumed that the\npossible outcomes are discrete. For a continuous variable, any division into\ndiscrete states is necessarily arbitrary (Bulli 2001). In this case stochastic kernels\ncan be used for evaluating the transition probabilities (Quah 1997). The stochastic\nkernel is a conditional kernel density estimate resulting in the conditional density\nfunction\n \nij\ni\nt\nj\nt p\nx\nx\n|\nx\nx\nf  . This function can be calculated, as usual, by\ndividing the bivariate kernel density estimate for xt+1 and xt by the kernel density\nestimate for xt:\n)\nx\nf(x\n)\nx\nx\n,\nx\nf(x\n)\nx\nx\n|\nx\nf(x\ni\nt\ni\nt\nj\nt\ni\nt\nj\nt\n\nThe result is a three-dimensional plot showing the conditional probabilities of\nbeing in a state in t+1 conditional on being in a certain state in t.\nAfter describing our methodological set-up, we now turn to the empirical\npart of the paper. It proceeds as follows. After describing the data at hand (Section\n3), we estimate the transition probabilities for discrete states (Section 4) and then\nuse logit regression methodology to examine the business cycle impact (Section\n5.1). Since the logit regression is statistically inaccurate, we check these results\nwith the multinomial logit model in section 5.2. The results we will have attained\nby then are checked in section 5.3 by inspecting some of the stochastic kernel\ndensity estimates.\n3. The data\nFor the following analysis we use the Bundesbank's corporate balance\nsheets statistics database (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik).3 This is the largest\ndatabase for non-financial firms in Germany. Its data were collected by the\nBundesbank in the course of its rediscounting and lending operations. Credit\ninstitutions presented bills of exchange issued by non-financial firms to the\nBundesbank. To verify the creditworthiness of a firm, the Bundesbank bills of\nexchange issued by non-financial firms were frequently presented to the\nBundesbank by credit institutions. When a bill was presented for discounting, the\ncreditworthiness of the issuing firm and all other firms that previously held this\nbill needed to be determined. In the case of default, liability for payment of the\nbill fell on any firm that had held the bill. By law, the Bundesbank could only\naccept bills backed by three parties known to be creditworthy. This procedure\nallowed the Bundesbank to collect a unique dataset of information stemming from\nthe balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of firms. Up to 60,000 annual\naccounts have been collected by the Bundesbank. Because of the creditworthiness\nrequirements, the sample is not a random sample of German firms. This is\nillustrated by the fact that only 4% of the total number of enterprises in Germany\nis covered by the data set but about 60% of the total turnover of the corporate\nsector, resulting in underrepresentation of small firms (Stoess 2001). The latter\nfact also means that although the sample is non-random, it yet comprises firms\n3 The data set has been used frequently and fruitfully for scientific\nanalysis in various directions. For more details regarding the data set, see Stoess\nthat are very important for the evolution of German GDP.4 It is noteworthy that all\nmandatory data collected for this data base have been subject to double-checking\nby the Bundesbank's staff. Hence, for a micro-data set, the data at hand should\ncontain unusually few errors.\nmost of the analysis. In 1999, the introduction of the euro and the new refinancing\nframework made the deals underlying the dataset less relevant. Therefore, we\nhave substantially fewer observations after 1998, and, thus, we omit this time\nperiod in our analysis. Due to changes in the sector definitions, the dataset had to\nSince we are interested mainly in the pattern of real sales, we have relatively few\nlosses of data due to incomplete and inconsistent reporting. Real sales growth is\ncalculated for each firm by deflating the firms' sales with the deflator of real\nGDP.5 To take outliers into account we have employed a cut-off rate, i.e. a\nfraction of +/- 50% growth rate is truncated from the data to take into account\nmergers, for instance.6\nThe next thing to consider is how to define the states for the firms according\nto their real sales growth rate. One might choose an absolute criterion for the\nstates since we have restricted the range of possible values to the interval \u00ad50 to\nproblem with this definition is that distributional and within-distribution effects\nare mixed. During a recession, the whole distribution moves to the \"left\". This\nmeans that many firms move from their original state to a lower state when the\n4 This view is supported by the fact that the correlation coefficient\nbetween the GDP growth rate and the mean growth rate of the firms covered in\nthe sample is about 0.89. Therefore, the following analysis should be interesting\ndespite the underrepresentation of small firms. Caution is warranted with respect\nto extending the results beyond the enterprises covered in the sample.\n5 One might argue that each sector should be deflated with its\nrespective deflator. With the exception of only some sectors, e.g. computer\nmanufacturing, the sectoral deflators all move closely together; the GDP deflator\nhence appears to be a good approximation.\n6 The results also hold without any cut-off; we present the results with\ncut-off to show that they are not due to outliers. For a discussion of the cut-off\nwith the present dataset see D\u00f6pke et al. (2005).\nstates are defined as absolute values. The transition probabilities then would show\na lot of movement that is not within-distribution movement but a shift of the\ndistribution itself. Therefore states that move during recessions together with the\ndistribution have to be defined. Quantiles are natural candidates. By using\nquantiles, we can disentangle the distributional shift (changing quantiles) from the\nwithin-distribution movement (transition probabilities). Since the growth rate of\nreal sales is a continuous variable, the choice of the quantiles is somewhat\narbitrary. As a baseline scenario, we choose deciles as states. Choosing smaller\nquantiles would lead to a large number of results in the subsequent analysis,\nmaking interpretations difficult. To check for robustness we have performed the\nsame analysis for quintiles as well. The results are confirmed by this definition of\n4. Descriptive cross-sectional results\nUsing a 50% cut-off, i.e. dropping all observations with absolute real sales\ngrowth rates above 50%, the deciles were calculated for each year. Figure 2 shows\nthe evolution of the real growth rate of sales deciles over time.\nNot surprisingly, the deciles move during business cycles, having lower\nin the last section, each decile is regarded as a possible state for each firm. For\nevery year each firm is assigned a state and from these assignments the transition\nprobabilities are calculated for all year pairs. Conditional on the present state, we\nobtain probabilities of being in one of the ten possible states in the next year.\n7 The definition of states also makes the analysis more robust. This\nwould explain why using no cut-off does not change the results, as mentioned\nearlier.\nNote: The 10th decile denotes the firms with the largest increase in real sales.\nIn Figure 3 these conditional probabilities are plotted. Each single graph\nshows the transition probabilities conditional on the present state. In other words,\nif the graph is named 1.decile the present state is the first decile, the x-axis shows\nall ten possible states next period. Furthermore, the y-axis measures the\nprobability for moving from the first decile to another next year or staying in the\nsame decile, i.e. each curve represents one row of the transition matrix for a given\nyear.\nA clear pattern emerges. For the lowest and highest deciles a u-shaped curve\nemerges irrespective of the year under review. The less extreme middle deciles\nshow a clear hump-shaped pattern. Those patterns mean that firms with extreme\ngrowth rates are more volatile than firms with \"normal\" growth rates.\nA look at the first decile graph in figure 3 shows us that the probabilities of\nstaying in the first decile and moving to the tenth decile are the largest. This\nmeans that either the firm stays in the first decile, i.e. the firm will shrink also in\nthe next period, or it will make a big jump and grow at an exceptionally fast rate.\nFigure 3: Cross-sectional transition probabilities\nP\nro\nbability(%\n)\nP\nro\nbability(%\n)\nProbability (%\n)\nP\nro\nbability(%\n)\nProbability(%\n)\nProbability(%\n)\nProbability(%\n)\nProbability(%\n)\nP\nro\nbability(%\n)\nProbability(%\n)\nNote: the lines refer to the years under investigation.\nThe latter fact alone is not that surprising. When a firm is hit by a large negative\nidiosyncratic shock, it will experience a large negative real sales growth. Once it\nmanages to return to old real sales levels, in the next period it will necessarily grow at a\nfaster absolute rate than the rate by which it shrank the period before just by reaching\nthe pre-shock level of real sales.\nFigure 4: Mean size of firms by states\nState\nDM\nNote: \"1\" denotes the state of the firms with the lowest growth rate of real sales while\n\"10\" denotes the state of the firms with the highest growth rate of real sales.\nThe pattern for the first decile could therefore just be a statistical artefact.\nInterestingly, the pattern of either staying in the same state or making a big adjustment\nis also present in the tenth decile graph. Normally, one would expect firms entering a\nnew market with exceptional growth potential to display high growth rates. After some\ntime, the market becomes mature and the growth rates drop back to \"normal\" levels. In\nother words, one would expect a regression to the mean process. The transition\nprobabilities for the first and tenth decile suggest a different story. Firms with extreme\ngrowth rates are extremely volatile, having high probabilities of staying in their extreme\nstate or making a turnaround to the other extreme. Together with the hump-shaped\npattern for the middle deciles, this suggests a two-class firm society. Firms with\nmedium growth rates have high probabilities of staying in their respective state or\nmaking medium shifts to neighbouring states. The other class of firm has extreme\ngrowth rates and highly volatile shifts of growth rates from one extreme to the other.\nFigure 4 additionally considers whether there is a link between the sizes of the\nfirm and the states, i.e. the average growth rates of the firms. The figure shows the\naverage size of firms in each state measured by the level of real sales. We see that the\naverage size is hump-shaped, i.e. highest for the middle states, peaking at the sixth and\nseventh states. In Figure 1, those are the deciles with \"normal\" growth rates between 0\nand 10%. The extreme and volatile deciles have lower average sizes than the middle\ndecile firms. This finding is in line with several analyses in the industrial organisation\nliterature where an inverse relationship is found between the growth rate and the size of\nthe firm as well as between the standard deviation of the growth rates of firms and the\nGDP growth rate (left axis)\nShorrocks mobility index (right axis)\n%\nNotes: see main text for details.\nWhat is also apparent from Figure 5 is that the transition probabilities vary widely\nover the years. A 10\n10u transition matrix contains 100 elements and is therefore not\neasy to interpret, especially when comparing matrices from different years. One method\nis to use mobility indices to condense the information obtained from a transition matrix.\nn\ntrace(P)\nn\n(P)\nM\n\n\nThe index is one for perfect mobility and zero for no mobility at all. The result\ntogether with the growth rate of real GDP is shown in Figure 5.\nThe mobility index (red line, cross as a symbol) is very high and fluctuates around\n0.95-0.96, indicating high mobility. During the first half of the respective time period,\nthe mobility index is pro-cyclical, while for the second half a counter-cyclical pattern\nemerges. The simple mobility index therefore shows no clear pattern for business cycle\nimplications of the transition probabilities. In the next section we take a closer look at\nthe single probabilities.\n5. Business cycle impact on transition probabilities\n5.1 Results from transition probabilities and Markov chains\nTo gain insight into the behaviour of firms during business cycles, we use the\nlogit regression method introduced in part 2. We are interested in how business cycle\nconditions influence the behaviour of transition probabilities and therefore include, as a\nfirst step, the present and the lagged growth rate of GDP as regressors. From the\nindustrial organisation literature, it is well known that the size and age of firms affect\ntheir growth rate. We therefore include the absolute value of real sales as a measure of\nfirm size as regressor. Unfortunately, the data set does not include the age of firms. The\ndiscussion in the preceding section showed that the behaviour of firms with extreme\ngrowth rates differs markedly from that of firms with medium growth rates. This might\nbe due to some sectors being more volatile than other sectors. For this reason, we\nincluded a set of sectoral dummies as independent variables. The regression equation\ntherefore looks like this:\n)\n\nD\n\nz\n\nGDP\n\nGDP\n\n(\nY\nj\nit\nj\nj\nit\nt\nt\nit \u00a6 \n\n\n\nit\nY is the binary dependent variable stating that a firm i at time t is in a certain\nstate or not, t\nGDP\n' is the growth rate of real GDP at time t, it\nz is the value of real sales\nof firm i at time t. t\nD is the sectoral dummy taking the value one if firm i belongs to\nsector j and zero otherwise.\nThe estimation is conducted by a logit regression, as explained in section 2. Since\nboth heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation were present in the data, we calculated\nconsistent standard errors.8 The regressions were run for every possible dependent\nvariable, i.e. one regression was run for the variable staying in state one, another for the\nvariable moving from state one to state two, and so on. The results for the coefficients\nof the independent variables are shown in Figures 6 and 7. Each single graph shows the\nvalue of the coefficient moving to the state indicated on the x-axis depending on the\npresent state, which is indicated by the title of each graph. The lines around the dots\nrepresent a two-standard-error band around the coefficients.\nFigure 6 shows the coefficient of the contemporary GDP growth rate. The pattern\nthat emerges is not easy to see. For the firms in the first three states, i.e. firms with low\ngrowth rates, a boom increases the probability of moving to a higher state, i.e. to a state\nwith higher growth rate, and reduces the probability of staying in the original state. For\nthe other states, this effect is less clear but still present. Either the probability of staying\nin the original state is not affected (as indicated by the two-standard-error bands), or it is\nnegatively influenced by the growth rate of real GDP. What is interesting is that, for the\nmiddle states, the probability of moving to higher states as well as to lower states is\n8 As a check for robustness we also used other model specifications such as\nOLS, Fixed Effects, Population-Averaged Logit with robust standard errors, etc. The\nresults were all robust with respect to the different model specifications and are\navailable from the authors on request.\nincreased, meaning that a boom phase is not necessarily a phase of improvement for\nfirms with medium growth rates but might, in fact, lead to worse performance. This is\nparticularly the case for firms in higher states where the probability of moving to lower\nstates, especially for moving to state one, is positively affected by business cycle\nconditions.\nFigure 6: Influence of present business cycle conditions on transition probabilities\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nCoefficient 95 confidence band\nState\nState\nNote: \"1\" denotes the state of the firms with the lowest growth rate of real sales while\n\"10\" denotes the state of the firms with the highest growth rate of real sales.\nThis shows that booms increase the volatility of firms offering both opportunities\nfor improvement as well as risks for performance. The reverse is true for recessions, of\nThe behaviour of the coefficient of lagged GDP growth is clearer than the\nbehaviour of the coefficient of contemporaneous GDP. A boom in the last period\nincreases the probability for all states of staying in the same state or moving only to a\nneighbouring state while reducing the probabilities of extreme changes, as can be seen\nfrom Figure 7. A past recession will then decrease the probability of staying and\nincrease the probabilities of moving.\nThis suggests an interesting pattern for the behaviour of firms during business\ncycles. Consider an economy that enters a recession after a boom phase last year. Last\nyear's boom increases the probability of staying in the same decile for all states. This\neffect is strengthened by this year's recession. This means that a recession is a period of\nless movement within the distribution of firm growth rates.\nSince recessions on average last for about two or three quarters, the next year\nwould normally be a boom phase. During a post-recession boom phase, the probability\nof moving to other states increases dramatically both because of both this year's boom\nand last year's recession. If the economy stays in a boom phase for another year, the\ninfluence on the probabilities will be counteracted by this year's and last year's boom,\nresulting in a kind of settling-down effect for the distribution of firms. One must bear in\nmind, as was shown in Figure 1, that the deciles of growth rates themselves move in\naccordance with business cycle conditions. This means that, during a recession, the\nwhole distribution of the growth rates of real sales shifts to the left. The movement\nwithin the distribution is reduced. During the upswing the distribution shifts to the right\nand within movement is higher than during the recession.\n9 Since the coefficients are significant for most movements, it is clear that the\ntransition probabilities are indeed time-varying. This justifies our assumption of non-\nhomogeneity.\nFigure 7: Influence of past business cycle conditions on transition probabilities\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nCoefficient 95 % confidence band\nState\nNote: \"1\" denotes the state of the firms with the lowest growth rate of real sales while\n\"10\" denotes the state of the firms with the highest growth rate of real sales.\nFigure 8: Influence of changing business cycle conditions on transition\nprobabilities\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nCoeffcient 95 % confidence band\nState\nNote: \"1\" denotes the state of the firms with the lowest growth rate of real sales while\n\"10\" denotes the state of the firms with the highest growth rate of real sales.\nFigure 9: Influence of the firms' size on transition probabilities\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nCoefficient 95 % confidence band\nState\nNote: \"1\" denotes the state of the firms with the lowest growth rate of real sales while\n\"10\" denotes the state of the firms with the highest growth rate of real sales.\nTo underline the result, equation (10) was re-estimated using the first difference\nof GDP growth as the regressor instead of GDP growth and lagged GDP growth. The\nresult is presented in Figure 8. As we can see, it is indeed the changing business cycle\nconditions that lead to the aforementioned within-distribution pattern.\nIn Figure 9 the coefficients of the impact of the firms' size (measured in terms of\nthe level of real sales) on transition probabilities are shown. A general pattern of\nconvergence emerges: the larger the firm, the more likely it is to be and stay in a\nmedium decile. This result is a standard result in industrial organisation literature\nshowing that the discretisation of the continuous real sales growth at least can replicate\n5.2 Results from multinomial logit regressions\nAs mentioned in section 2, the results presented above do not ensure that the\nprobabilities are summing up to one and are, therefore, just approximations.\nAdditionally, we therefore present in Figure 10 a regression analysis with the\nmultinomial logit model. The same set of regressors, with differenced GDP growth, was\nused, and again consistent standard errors were calculated. The graph is like the\nprevious ones except for one feature: the number of states in t+1 excludes the base state\n(the state in t) since we only have results for the relative but not absolute change in the\nprobabilities.\nComparing Figure 10 with Figure 8, we see that the general pattern for the\ncoefficient is the same for all graphs except for the 10th decile. Here, we have the\nproblem that the multinomial logit model only shows relative changes. Since we know\nthat the probabilities of a relative decline in all states in Figure 10 all have to add up to\none, the 10th decile graph means that the absolute probability of staying in state 10 must\nhave increased (contradicting the result in Figure 8). This absolute rise in the probability\nof staying in state 10 means that we cannot say whether the probability of moving to\nstate 1 increases or decreases absolutely while declining relative to state 10.\n10 To take into account a possible endogeneity of real sales we have checked, whether taking into account\nthe lagged value alters the results qualitatively, which is not the case. Details are available upon\nrequest fro the authors.\nThe result for the 10th decile in Figure 8 therefore is not robust, while the \"right\" result\nis not interpretable in terms of absolute change. The rest of the graphs are consistent,\nwhich leads us to the conclusion that the results in the previous section show us the\nright development with respect to their absolute change.\nFigure 10: Results from multinomial logit regressions\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nState\nCoefficient 95 % confidence band\nState\nNote: \"1\" denotes the state of the firms with the lowest growth rate of real sales while\n\"10\" denotes the state of the firms with the highest growth rate of real sales.\n5.3 Results from stochastic Kernel densities\nAs a last check of robustness, the results for the stochastic kernel density\nestimates11 are presented in Figure 11. The upper part of the graph shows the 3D plot of\ntransition probabilities and the corresponding contour plot for the boom year of 1991. In\nthe lower part, the respective graphs for the recession year of 1993 can be seen. Both\ngraphs indicate that the extreme growth rates are indeed more volatile than the middle\ngrowth rates. Comparing both graphs, we see that the extreme positive growth rates\nhave a higher probability during recessions of moving to negative growth rates while\nthe opposite holds for the extreme negative growth rates.\nFigure 11: Results from stochastic Kernel densities\n11 For the estimation a Gaussian kernel was used. The bandwidth was selected\naccording to the Silverman bandwidth selection criterion (Silverman 1986).\n6. Conclusions\nWe analyse stylised facts for Germany's business cycle at the firm level. Based on\nlongitudinal firm-level data from the Bundesbank's balance sheet statistics covering, on\nof a firm in a regime of a given real sales growth switching to another regime in the next\nperiod. We find that these probabilities depend on the business cycle position.\nTwo findings emerge from our analysis. Firstly, extreme states are prone to\nextreme movements across the states, i.e. firms with high absolute growth rates are\nmore volatile than firms with medium growth rates; this result is confirmed by standard\nindustrial organisation literature. Secondly, the change of business cycle and not the\nbusiness cycle condition itself has a marked influence on the firms' within-distribution\ndynamics. Firms with low growth rates have a better chance of improving their position\nduring changed business cycle conditions, while firms with high growth rates face an\nincreased risk of degradation. Firms with medium growth rates face both risks as well as\nchances.\nThese results are important improvements over the previous analysis (D\u00f6pke et al.\n2005), which concentrated on the movement of percentiles rather then on the movement\nof firms themselves. Two important questions for further research emerge. The first\nquestion is that of causality.12 The pattern of movements across states could be the\nresult of a macroeconomic shock affecting firms in a different way. According to this\ninterpretation, the movement of firms is the result of the movement of GDP. The other\npossible explanation would reverse the causality. In this case, idiosyncratic shocks,\nthrough some sort of spillover effect (e. g. credit rationing due to bad debts for the\nbanking sector, as proposed in Delli Gatti et al. 2003), would cause a movement of\nGDP. In this case, it is the differing movements of firms which drive the GDP. A third\nexplanation might be a non-linear combination of both approaches. The distributional\nposition of the firms is more persistent during downturns and more volatile during\nupturns. One might reason that the downturn is then due to a traditional macroeconomic\n12 We estimated Granger causality tests for the transition probabilities and the\ndifferenced GDP growth rates but did not obtain a significant result. Progress towards\nanswering this question is possible using quarterly data, which were not available for\nthe present analysis.\nshock while the upswing is driven by idiosyncratic shocks since firms are affected in\ndifferent ways.\nAnother important question is the question of regression to the mean which is\nusually found in industrial organisation literature. As was shown in this paper, the\nbusiness cycle conditions affect the position of firms within the distribution. Therefore,\nthe business cycle effects should not be neglected in dealing with questions of\nconvergence between firms. It might well turn out that the different reactions of firms\nduring upswings might explain more about the convergence process than the variables\nof size and age traditionally used.\nReferences\nAghion, P. and P.
