According to the American\nAcademy of Family Physicians, since 1997 the\nnumber of US medical school students going into\nprimary care has dropped by 51.8%, and it is\nestimated that by 2020 there will be a shortage of\nmore than 40,000 primary care doctors in the United\nStates. Moreover, because universal health care is a\nreality and approximately 32 million currently unin-\nsured Americans have to be absorbed into the system,\nthe need for PCPs is bound to escalate.21\nThe role of PCPs is bound to take on a much\nhigher level of importance if the push toward patient-\ncentered medical homes gains steam.19,20 These med-\nical homes are designed to deliver better coordinated,\neasily accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-\ncentered, and culturally sensitive primary health care\nwith a focus on prevention, safety, quality, and ap-\npropriate reimbursement via a team approach.\nWithin such a system, much of the routine, time-\nconsuming tasks are performed by nurse practitio-\nners and physician assistants, leaving the PCPs\nmore time to listen to and adequately treat pa-\nPrevious studies regarding career satisfaction of\nPCPs have indicated some interesting trends and raised\nsome important questions.

Fifty-\nfive percent of all the PCPs had changed jobs\nduring the 5-year period, with 20% of the PCPs\nhaving left 2 jobs. Thus, they concluded that\nthere is a clear link between PCP job satisfaction\nand PCP turnover. They recommended that it is\nimportant for health care planners to understand\nthe main reasons for PCPs' discontent and to\ndevelop policies designed to reduce turnover.22\nAnother survey of PCPs conducted in 2006 for\nPhysicians Practice,23 a leading national medical\npractice management publication, found that\nmore than 50% of PCPs considered themselves\n\"second-class citizens\" compared with surgical\nand diagnostic specialists. In addition, almost two\nthirds of PCPs reported that they would choose\nanother field if they could do over their careers.\nsaid they would become surgical or diagnostic\nspecialists, whereas approximately 22% said they\nwould not choose medicine as a career.23\nIn an attempt to shed some light on the de-\nclining level of satisfaction,24 decreasing sense of\nprofessional autonomy,25 and \"feelings of pow-\nerlessness\"26 in the complex health care environ-\nment within which PCPs operate,27 Katerndahl\net al28 used Community Tracking Survey data\nthe relationships of both perceived autonomy and\nperceived complexity of care on PCPs career\nsatisfaction. They concluded that there is consid-\nerable interaction between perceived complexity\nof care, perceived autonomy, and career satisfac-\ntion of PCPs. However, they point out that,\nbecause the predictors of career satisfaction in\ntheir study explained less than 15% of the vari-\nance, there must be more factors involved in\nsatisfaction and perceived autonomy than those\nthey measured.\nGiven the significant role that PCPs play in an\nintegrated, complex health care system and the\nimpending shortage of PCPs that has been fore-\ncasted for the next decade, it is imperative for\nhealth care policy makers and medical school\ndirectors to have a good understanding of the\nfactors causing career dissatisfaction among\nPCPs. This knowledge will help health care pro-\nfessionals provide medical students with ade-\nquate career counseling, frame policies that will\nenhance the work environment, improve com-\npensation/reimbursement methods, and increase\nsatisfaction levels among PCPs, thereby improv-\ning the overall quality and access of primary care\nin the United States. The purpose of this study\nwas to conduct an empirical investigation of the\nrelationship between career satisfaction of vari-\nous PCP specialty groups and factors associated\nwith their work environment, practice quality,\ncompensation, and demographics. The findings\nhelped to establish a new baseline that can be\nused to track how various PCP specialty groups\nlike internal medicine, family/general medicine,\nand pediatrics organize and practice medicine.\nMethods\nSample\nThe Center for Studying Health System Change\n(HSC)'s 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey\nwas the source of the data used in this study.29 The\nHSC is a Washington D.C.\u00adbased organization\nthat is partly funded by the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation and that is affiliated with Mathematica\nPolicy Research. Part of its mission is to improve\nthe health of the public. This nonpartisan organi-\nzation conducts studies about the US health care\nsystem with the objective of ensuring that reliable\nand unbiased information is available to those mak-\ning policy decisions. The 2008 HSC survey was\nfunded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\nand the data files and documentation are available\nthrough the Inter-University Consortium for Po-\nlitical and Social Research.30 One of the objectives\nof this survey was to establish a new baseline to\ntrack how physicians organize and practice medi-\ncine.\nThe sample frame of this study was derived\nfrom a list of physicians from the American Med-\nical Association. The American Medical Associ-\nas of July 2007. After deletion of inaccurate and\nincomplete items in the data file, the HSC was\nThe HSC used stratification procedures to iden-\ntify a sample of physicians to be surveyed for the\nstudy. The procedure ensured that there was an\nadequate sample size for various populations and\nthat the respondents of the survey belonged to all\n50 states and the District of Colombia. The HSC\ndred thirty-six physicians refused to participate\nin the survey, and 2683 physicians did not re-\nspond to the survey. One thousand six hundred\neleven returned surveys were rejected because\nthey were from ineligible physicians. The survey\nexcluded residents, fellows, Federal employees,\nand foreign medical school graduates who were\ntemporarily licensed to practice in the United\nStates. It also did not include specialists whose\nprimary focus was not direct patient care. In the\nend, 4720 completed surveys were received from\neligible physicians. The HSC 2008 Health\nTracking Physician Survey Methodology Report\nprovides detailed information about the stratifi-\ncation procedure, target population, survey de-\nsign, and data collection procedures.31\nThis study used only responses of PCPs (inter-\nnal medicine, family medicine/general medicine,\nand pediatrics) from the Health Tracking Physician\nSurvey. After list-wise deletion for missing values\nwe were left with a usable sample of 504 internal\nmedicine physicians, 693 family/general medicine\nphysicians, and 363 pediatricians. More informa-\ntion about the variables used in this study is avail-\nable online.32 In addition, information about the\nmeasurement scale of each variable used in our\nstudy is provided in Table 1.\nDependent Variable\nCareer satisfaction was the dependent variable of\nthis study. The overall satisfaction of a physician's\ncareer in medicine was measured on a 5-point Lik-\nert scale, ranging from a high of very satisfied to a\nlow of very dissatisfied.\nIndependent Variable\nThe independent variables of this study were\ngrouped into 4 categories. They are (1) environ-\nmental issues, (2) practice quality, (3) compensa-\ntion, and (4) physician demographics.\nEnvironmental Issues\nEnvironmental issues consisted of degree of own-\nership, use of information technology, and if the\nphysicians worked most of their time in private\npractice (yes/no). Ownership was measured (from\nhigh to low) on a 3-point scale. Use of information\ntechnology consisted of 16 items. These items ex-\namined the use of information technology in the\nareas of clinical practice, patient information, and\nprescription drugs.\nPractice Quality\nPractice quality factors included inadequate quality\ncare, threat of malpractice, and patient interaction.\nInadequate quality care consisted of 8 items that\ncould limit a physician's ability to provide high-\nquality care to patients. These items included re-\njection of care decision by insurance, lack of qual-\nified specialists in the area, patients' inability to pay\nfor needed care, inadequate time with patients, not\ngetting reports in time, difficulty communicating\nwith patients, patients not complying with treat-\nment recommendations, and medical errors in hos-\npitals. These items were measured on a 3-point\nscale.\nThreat of malpractice was measured using 5\nitems. These items asked the respondents the ex-\ntent to which they agreed that (1) they were con-\ncerned that they will be involved in a malpractice\ncase sometime during the next 10 years, (2) they felt\npressure in their day-to-day practice by threat of\nmalpractice litigation, (3) they ordered tests or con-\nsultations to avoid any appearance of malpractice,\n(4) they asked for a consultation to reduce the risk\nof being sued, and (5) they rely less on clinical\njudgment than technology to make a diagnosis be-\ncause of the threat of a malpractice lawsuit. Patient\ninteraction measured the extent to which the re-\nspondents agreed that they have adequate time to\nspend with their patients during their office visit.\nCompensation\nCompensation consisted of income level of the\nphysicians and benefits provided by drug and med-\nically related companies. Income was measured on\na 6-point categorical variable presented in Table 1.\nBenefits provided by drug and medically related\ncompanies consisted of 7 items that measured food\nand/or beverages provided at work, free drug sam-\nples, honoraria for speaking, honoraria for partici-\npating in surveys, payment for consultation services,\ncost of travel to meetings, and other compensation\nfrom drug companies.\nPhysician Demographics\nDemographic variables selected were sex, race, and\nexperience. Scales of these variables are also pre-\nsented in Table 1.\nAnalysis\nEach of the PCP categories (internal medicine phy-\nsicians, family/general medicine physicians, and pe-\ndiatricians) was analyzed separately. Means and\nSDs were calculated for each variable. Cronbach's\n was used to calculate the internal consistency or\nreliability of variables with multiple items (infor-\nmation technology use, inadequate quality care,\nthreat of malpractice, and benefits from drug com-\npanies). Ordinary least square regression analysis was\ndone to examine the impact of various independent\nvariables on our dependent variable. Statistical anal-\nysis was done using SPSS Statistics version 17.0\n(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).\nResults\nTable 2 presents descriptive statistics of the data\nused in this study. An average internal medicine\nand family/general medicine physician was a white\nman who was \"somewhat satisfied\" with his career\nin medicine. An average pediatrician was a white\nwoman who was \"very satisfied\" with her career in\nmedicine. An average physician in all 3 specialties\nbegan his/her medical practice between 1991 and\n1995.

In fact, among all factors examined in this\nstudy, patient interaction had the greatest impact\non career satisfaction of all specialties.\nDiscussion\nThis is not the first nationwide study to examine\nthe career satisfaction of PCPs. However, most of\nthe nationwide studies in the past used the Com-\nmunity Tracking Survey, a predecessor to the 2008\nHealth Tracking Physician Survey used in our\nstudy. The Community Tracking Survey, a longi-\ntudinal survey, was first conducted in 1996 and has\nvarious limitations, which have been well docu-\nmented.28,29 Besides being more current, the\n2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey ad-\ndresses many policy issues related to physician\ncare that are important today and were not cov-\nered in the Community Tracking Survey. The\n2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey was cre-\nated to set up a new baseline for research about\nphysicians and included questions about many new\nissues such as malpractice and physician ownership.\nOur data indicates that 19% of PCPs have been\npracticing since at least 1980. These physicians\nwho have been practicing for 30 years or more may\nbe contemplating retirement at a time when there\nis a dire need in the United States for more PCPs.\nThis further emphasizes the need to create oppor-\ntunities and systems to encourage medical students,\nespecially women and minorities, to specialize in\nprimary care. Mentorship programs and formal so-\ncial support groups may help with recruiting more\nwomen and minorities. Previous research about\ncareer satisfaction of female physicians has indi-\ncated that some female physicians report that they\nhave fewer opportunities for advancement and are\npaid less than their male counterparts. Female\nmedical students are less likely to pursue those\nspecialties where these practices are prevalent.33,34\nThe attrition and \"burn out\" rate of PCPs also\nneeds to be addressed via better remuneration and\nreimbursement methods so that their overall level\nof career satisfaction can be significantly increased.\nMost experts believe that a real transformation of\nUS health care will only occur when quality, access,\ncoordination, and accountability are enhanced, all\nof which require excellent and motivated PCPs.\nOur analysis found that those internal medicine\nphysicians and pediatricians who had some degree\nof ownership in their practice were less satisfied with\ntheir careers. This suggests that those PCPs who\nworked as independent contractors or as employees\nwere more satisfied with their careers. Use of infor-\nmation technology in the areas of clinical practice,\npatient information, and prescription drugs and\nworking in a private practice had no impact on career\nsatisfaction. In addition, various benefits provided by\ndrug companies and working in private practice had\nno significant positive or negative impact on the ca-\nreer satisfaction of PCPs.\nPractice quality factors were the most important\npredictors of career satisfaction for PCPs in the 3\nspecialties. Inadequate quality of care had a signif-\nicant negative impact on the career satisfaction of\npediatricians. Thus, career satisfaction of pediatri-\ncians was negatively influenced by their inability to\nrefer a patient to a quality specialist, arrange non-\nhospital admissions, provide high-quality outpa-\ntient mental health services, and the absence of\ninterpreter services for non\u00adEnglish-speaking pa-\ntients. In our study, patient interaction had the\nbiggest impact on career satisfaction of PCPs, fol-\nlowed by the threat of malpractice. The income\nlevel of physicians significantly impacted career sat-\nisfaction of all types of PCPs. None of the demo-\ngraphic variables had a significant impact on career\nsatisfaction. It is possible that some of these non-\nsignificant variables had an indirect impact on ca-\nreer satisfaction. Future research needs to examine\nthe indirect impact of these factors using path anal-\nysis.\nBecause physician pay was associated with lower\nsatisfaction, this study suggests that increasing pay\ncould help attract more physicians to primary care\nfields. For example, changes in reimbursement\nhave been recommended by many experts in health\ndone to clarify the true relationship between in-\ncome and career satisfaction. For example, future\nresearch could examine if a PCP's career satisfac-\ntion is impacted by actual pay, pay relative to that of\nother specialties, or both. The number of medical\nstudents opting into a primary care specialty may\nbe able to be increased through the provision of\ntuition waivers or loan forgiveness programs.20,35\nGiven the negative view of liability by the physi-\ncians in this study, states may also increase the PCP\nworkforce by improving the professional liability\nclimate. Further, because satisfaction is dependent\non patient interaction, payment mechanisms that\nencourage time for patient interaction over vol-\nume--such as salary rather than fee per individual\nservice--could also increase the attractiveness of\nthe fields.\nThis study has several limitations. First, this\nstudy is based on self-reported secondary data. Sec-\nond, our independent variables accounted for\nonly16% of the variance in career satisfaction for\ninternal medicine physicians, only 17% of the vari-\nance in career satisfaction for family/general prac-\ntice physicians, and only 21% of the variance in\ncareer satisfaction for pediatricians. Although many\nresearchers would consider them low, these values\nare higher than what has been found in previous\nresearch examining the career satisfaction of\nPCPs.28 Because we used a secondary data set, our\nanalysis is limited to the variables studied by the\nprimary researchers. Clearly there are other signif-\nicant variables that were not included in our study.\nPrevious health care research has shown that, be-\nsides financial rewards, factors like ethical climate,\nrecognition, respect, empathy, and appreciation\ncan significantly impact job satisfaction and com-\nmitment of employees. Future research needs to\ninvestigate the impact of these factors on career\nsatisfaction. Research also needs to be done about\nthe impact on mentorship programs and formal\nsocial support groups on the recruitment of women\nand minorities. Third, the Cronbach's  for some\nof our variables were low. Cronbach's  is impacted\nby the number of items in the scale and the mag-\nnitude of the correlation among the items. Fourth,\nour regression model only accounts for direct ef-\nfects. A path model with indirect effects may give us\na better understanding of the true impact of these\nfactors on career satisfaction.\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that has\nexamined the factors that impact the career satisfac-\ntion of different types of PCPs using the 2008 Health\nTracking Physician Survey. Our study found that\npatient interaction, followed by the threat of malprac-\ntice and income, had the most significant impact on\nthe career satisfaction of PCPs. Use of information\ntechnology, the kind of practice, drug company bene-\nfits, sex, race, and experience had no direct impact on\nPCPs' career satisfaction. Although pediatricians re-\nported the highest level of satisfaction with their ca-\nreers, factors indentified in our study can guide future\ndoctors in their decisions regarding whether or not to\npursue a career in primary care. Given the need for\nmore PCPs, the result of this study can help health\ncare managers come up with strategies to not only\nensure that physicians don't quit but also to persuade\nphysicians to delay early retirement.\nReferences\n1.
