In\nresponse, we sought to determine whether WC predicts diabetes and cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) beyond that explained by BMI and commonly obtained cardiometabolic risk factors\nincluding blood pressure, lipoproteins, and glucose.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Subjects consisted of 5,882 adults from the\n1999\u00ad2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is nationally represen-\ntative and cross-sectional. Subjects were grouped into sex-specific WC and BMI tertiles. Blood\npressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and glucose were categorized using standard\nclinical thresholds. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds for diabetes and\nCVD according to WC tertiles.\nRESULTS -- After controlling for basic confounders, the medium and high WC tertiles were\nmore likely to have diabetes and CVD compared with the low WC tertile (P  0.05). After\ninclusion of BMI and cardiometabolic risk factors in the regression models, the magnitude of the\nodds ratios were attenuated (i.e., for diabetes the magnitude decreased from 6.54 to 5.03 for the\nhigh WC group) but remained significant in the medium and high WC tertiles for the prediction\nof diabetes, though not for CVD.\nCONCLUSIONS -- WC predicted diabetes, but not CVD, beyond that explained by tradi-\ntional cardiometabolic risk factors and BMI. The findings lend critical support for the recom-\nmendation that WC be a routine measure for identification of the high-risk, abdominally obese\npatient.\nIt is established that waist circumfer-\nence (WC) predicts increased risk of\nmorbidity (1\u00ad4) and mortality (5) be-\nyond that explained by BMI alone. Several\norganizations, including the National In-\nstitutes of Health (6), currently advocate\nfor the measurement of WC in clinical\npractice. However, a recent consensus\nstatement from the American Diabetes\nAssociation (ADA), the Obesity Society,\nand the American Society for Nutrition\nquestioned the clinical utility of WC mea-\nsurement (7). Opposition to the inclusion\nof WC measurement in clinical practice is\nhinged on the observation that it is un-\nclear whether WC predicts health risk be-\nyond that explained by BMI and\ncommonly evaluated cardiometabolic\nrisk factors (7). It is reasoned that clini-\ncians would be unnecessarily burdened\nby the measurement of WC if this mea-\nsure failed to explain health risk beyond\nthe risk factors routinely obtained in clin-\nical practice.\nLimited evidence suggests that WC\npredicts risk of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) after control for hypertension\n(1,2), hypercholesterolemia (2), and the\napolipoprotein B\u00adto\u00adA ratio (1). Absent\nfrom the literature is a clear demonstra-\ntion that WC predicts the risk of diabetes\nand CVD in men and women beyond that\nexplained by the commonly evaluated\ncardiometabolic risk factors (blood pres-\nsure, triglyceride, LDL and HDL choles-\nterol, and glucose levels) and BMI. We\naddressed this issue using data from the\nmost recent National Health and Nutri-\ntion Survey (NHANES).\nMETHODS -- The study sample was\nNHANES was designed to be a nationally\nrepresentative cross-sectional survey,\nwhich allows for two or three survey\nrounds to be combined, as done here.\nNHANES was conducted by the U.S. Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics to esti-\nmate the prevalence of major diseases,\nnutritional disorders, and risk factors for\nthese diseases.

Height was measured to\nthe nearest 0.1 cm and body mass to the\nnearest 0.1 kg (8). BMI was calculated as\nweight in kilograms divided by the square\nof height in meters. Subjects were divided\ninto sex-specific tertiles for WC and BMI.\nWe divided the subjects into WC and BMI\ntertiles instead of using commonly em-\nployed clinical thresholds to match the\ngroups for size both within (i.e., three\nequally sized WC groups) and across (i.e.,\nwith high WC group the same size as high\nBMI group) anthropometric measures. In\nmen, WC tertiles were defined by the fol-\nand 98.7 cm. In men, BMI tertiles were\ndefined by the following thresholds:\nThe corresponding values in women were\nMeasurement and classification of\ncardiometabolic risk factors\nBlood pressure.

Blood pressure was classified\naccording to established guidelines (9):\nmmHg), prehypertension (systolic 120\u00ad\nmmHg). When systolic and diastolic blood\npressures fell into different categories, the\nhigher category was selected for classifica-\ntion.

Blood samples\nwere obtained after an overnight fast for\nthe measurement of serum LDL choles-\nterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and\nglucose as described in detail elsewhere\n(8,10). Briefly, cholesterol and triglycer-\nide levels were measured enzymatically in\na series of coupled reactions hydrolyzing\ncholesterol ester and triglyceride to cho-\nlesterol and glycerol, respectively. LDL\ncholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyc-\neride levels were classified according to\nthe National Cholesterol Education Pro-\ngram guidelines (11). LDL cholesterol\nwas categorized as optimal (100 mg/dl),\n(160 mg/dl). Participants who reported\ntaking a cholesterol-lowering medication\nwere placed into the high LDL cholesterol\ncategory regardless of their LDL choles-\nterol level. HDL cholesterol was catego-\nmg/dl), or high (60 mg/dl). Triglycer-\nides were categorized as normal (150\nGlucose and diabetes.

Participants who reported that a\nphysician had ever told them they had a\nheart attack, stroke, angina, congestive\nheart failure, or coronary heart disease\nwere coded positive for CVD. All other\nparticipants were coded negative for CVD.\nConfounding variables\nConfounding variables included age,\nrace/ethnicity, sex, and smoking status.\nAge was included in the analysis as a con-\ntinuous variable. Race was categorized as\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nHispanic, and other. Subjects were con-\nsidered current smokers if they smoked\ncigarettes at the time of the interview, pre-\nvious smokers if they were not current\nsmokers but had smoked 100 cigarettes in\ntheir entire life, and nonsmokers if they\nsmoked less than this amount.\nStatistical analysis\nThe Intercooled Stata program (version 7;\nStata, College Station, TX) was used to\nproperly weight the sample to be repre-\nsentative of the U.S. population and to\ntake into account the complex sampling\nstrategy of the NHANES design. Initially,\nlogistic regression tests were used to ex-\namine associations among WC or BMI\ncategories, CVD, and diabetes. Three\nmodels were run for each disease out-\ncome. The first model controlled for the\nbasic confounding variables (age, sex,\nrace, and smoking). The second model\ncontrolled for the basic confounding vari-\nables and the risk factor categories for the\ncardiometabolic variables (glucose cate-\ngories were not controlled for in the dia-\nbetes analysis). The third model con-\ntrolled for the basic confounding vari-\nables, the cardiometabolic risk factor cat-\negories, and BMI (or WC) categories.\nNext, subjects were cross-classified ac-\ncording to WC (low, moderate, or high)\nand the number of metabolic risk factors\negories. Odds ratios (ORs) for CVD and\ndiabetes were then computed for these 12\ngroups. P for trend values were calculated\nto determine whether the WC and meta-\nbolic risk factor groups had independent\neffects on CVD and diabetes.\nTo further explore the added value of\nWC, we determined the discriminatory\nability of the diabetes and CVD models\n(e.g., ability to correctly separate those\nwho did and did not have disease) using\nthe c statistic. For each disease outcome,\nthe c statistic was calculated for three sep-\narate models that included the following\nTable 1--Descriptive characteristics of study participants\nVariable Total Men Women\nData are means  SE for continuous variables or prevalence SE (%) for dichotomous variables.\nWaist circumference and morbidity\nvariables: 1) demographics (age, race, sex,\nand smoking), 2) demographics plus tra-\nditional risk factors (blood pressure, LDL\nand HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride cat-\negories), and 3) demographics, traditional\nrisk factors, and WC categories. The c sta-\ntistic is identical to the area under the re-\nceiver operating characteristic curve, with\nvalues ranging from 0.5 (no better than\nchance alone) to 1.0 (perfect).\nRESULTS -- The descriptive charac-\nteristics of the study sample are contained\nwithin Table 1 . Table 2 presents the re-\nsults of the logistic regression models in\nwhich WC groups were used to predict\nthe likelihood of having diabetes and\nCVD.

We then cross-\ntabulated the WC and cardiometabolic\nrisk factor groups to form 12 WC  met-\nabolic risk factor groups. As illustrated in\nFig. 1A, both WC and cardiometabolic\nrisk factor groups were independent pre-\ndictors of diabetes (Ptrend\nfor a given number of cardiometabolic\nrisk factors, the likelihood of having dia-\nbetes increased when moving from the\nlow to high WC groups. Conversely,\nwithin a given WC group, the likelihood\nof having diabetes increased when mov-\ning from the group with no cardiometa-\nbolic risk factors to the group with three\nor more. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, cardio-\nmetabolic risk factor groups, but not WC\ngroups, significantly predicted CVD.\nThus, for a given number of cardiometa-\nbolic risk factors, the likelihood of having\nCVD was not different across WC groups\n(Ptrend\nTable 2--ORs for diabetes and CVD according to WC\nCovariates included in regression\nmodel\nWaist circumference tertile\nLow Medium High\nDiabetes\nAge, sex, race, smoking, and\nmetabolic risk factors\nAge, sex, race, smoking, metabolic\nrisk factors, and BMI\nCardiovascular disease\nAge, sex, race, smoking, and\nmetabolic risk factors\nAge, sex, race, smoking, metabolic\nrisk factors, and BMI\nData are OR (95% CI).

Conversely,\nBMI did not predict diabetes after consid-\neration of common cardiometabolic risk\nfactors and WC. Although both elevated\nWC and BMI were associated with greater\nCVD risk, these effects were eliminated\nafter control for cardiometabolic risk\nfactors.\nClinical guidelines for the assessment\nand/or management of obesity in the U.S.\nmeasurement of WC be used to identify\nthe need for further assessment including\nmeasurement of cardiometabolic risk fac-\ntors. The recent consensus statement of\nthe ADA, the Obesity Society, and the\nAmerican Society for Nutrition questions\nthe sequence of these clinical measures\nand, more importantly, the relevance of\nWC measurement in clinical practice (7).\nOur finding that WC predicts the risk of\ndiabetes beyond that explained by cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors and BMI extends\nprevious observations that document an\napproximately fivefold greater risk of di-\nabetes in the highest relative to the lowest\ncategory of WC in multivariate analysis\ncontrolling for lifestyle factors and BMI\n(3,4). Combined with the fact that the\nsex-specific WC cut points used in the\ncurrent study approximate those advo-\nin men and women, respectively), these\nobservations reinforce the utility of WC as\na first step in the identification of the\nhigh-risk, abdominally obese patient. In-\ndeed, although an elevated WC per se\nalerts the clinician to the need for further\nclinical assessment, we (16) and others\n(17) have shown that only patients with\nan elevated WC in combination with ele-\nvations in one or more cardiometabolic\nrisk factors represent those who are at\nsubstantially increased health risk and\nthus require aggressive treatment.\nThe mechanistic link that explains the\nassociation between WC and diabetes risk\nindependent of cardiometabolic risk fac-\ntors and BMI is unclear and remains the\nfocus of ongoing investigation (18). Al-\nthough the portal theory originally pro-\nposed a substrate-driven mechanism\n(19), recent evidence suggests that the\npathophysiology of abdominal adiposity\nmay result from the augmented secretion\nof various prothrombotic and proinflam-\nmatory cytokines from an expanded ab-\ndominal fat depot (20).\nAlthough WC was associated with\nCVD, such that individuals with a high\nWC were 73% more likely to have CVD\nthan those with a low WC, the association\ndid not remain significant after control for\nthe cardiometabolic risk factors. This\nfinding was not unexpected given that\nWC is a strong correlate of dyslipidemia,\nhypertension, and the metabolic syn-\ndrome (21), themselves established ante-\ncedents for CVD. Accordingly, this\nfinding does not indicate that a high WC\nis not a risk factor for CVD but, rather,\nthat WC predicts CVD via its influence on\ncardiometabolic risk factors. Indeed, the\nutility of WC to predict CVD risk will al-\nways be attenuated when metabolic risk\nfactors that lie in the causal pathway be-\ntween WC and risk of CVD are included\nin the prediction model. This observation\nagrees with the findings of the INTER-\nHEART study, wherein the strong associ-\nation between WC and myocardial\ninfarction was substantially attenuated af-\nter control for hypertension and the apo-\nlipoprotein B\u00adto\u00adA ratio (1).\nFrom a clinical perspective, it is note-\nworthy that in addition to the utility of\nWC measurement to identify the high-\nrisk, abdominally obese patient, WC is\nthe single best anthropometric measure\nfor detecting changes in abdominal obe-\nsity in response to treatment. It has re-\nFigure 1--ORs for diabetes (A) and CVD (B) according to WC  metabolic risk factor groups.\nBoth WC and metabolic risk factor groups were independent predictors of diabetes (Ptrend\n\n0.001). The metabolic risk factor groups were independent predictors of CVD (Ptrend\nwhereas the WC groups were not (Ptrend\nWaist circumference and morbidity\npeatedly been demonstrated that\nalthough WC is reduced consequent to\nweight loss, WC can also be reduced in\nresponse to treatment in obese individu-\nals who are resistant to weight loss or\nchanges in BMI (22). The implication is\nthat when considering the efficacy of\ntreatment strategies designed to manage\nabdominal obesity, practitioners are en-\ncouraged to look beyond body weight as\nthe measure of benefit and measure WC.\nThe analyses presented here are based\non a large and representative dataset and\nare therefore generalizable to the U.S.\nadult population. However, the cross-\nsectional nature of this study precludes\ndefinitive causal inferences about the as-\nsociation between WC and BMI with dia-\nbetes and CVD. Numerous studies,\nhowever, have shown that high WC and\nBMI precede the onset of morbidity (1\u00ad4)\nand mortality (5). The assessment of CVD\npresence in the current study relied on\nparticipant recall of previous diagnosis\nand thus may have been a source of error.\nAdditionally, as our assessment of diabe-\ntes was based on fasting plasma glucose\nvalues, a limited number of new diabetes\ncases may have been misclassified as non-\ndiabetes. Lastly, due to the limited sample\nsize, we were not able to perform ethnic-\nity- and/or sex-specific analyses.\nThe demonstration that WC predicts\nrisk of diabetes beyond that explained by\ncardiometabolic risk factors routinely ac-\nquired in clinical practice responds to\nprior criticism (7) and lends critical sup-\nport for the recommendation that WC be\na routine measure for identification and\nmanagement of the high-risk, abdomi-\nnally obese patient (14,15). Indeed, com-\nbined with the observation that WC is\nassociated with changes in abdominal\nobesity in response to treatment with or\nwithout weight loss (22), it is difficult to\nimagine a cogent argument against inclu-\nsion of WC in clinical practice.\n"
