    "abstract": "Abstract\nResearch methodology is the procedural framework within which the research is conducted. This includes the overall\napproach to a problem that could be put into practice in a research process, from the theoretical underpinning to the\ncollection and analysis of data. Choice of methodology depends on the primary drivers: topic to be researched and the\nspecific research questions. Hence, methodological perspectives of managing stakeholder expectations of PDHR context\nare composed of research philosophies, research strategy, research design, and research techniques. This research belonged\nto social constructivism or interpretivism within a philosophical continuum. The nature of the study was more toward\nsubjectivism where human behavior favored voluntary stance. Ontological, methodological, epistemological, and axiological\npositioning carried the characteristics of idealism, ideographic, anti-positivism, and value laden, respectively. Data collection\ncomprises two phases, preliminary and secondary. Exploratory interviews with construction experts in the United Kingdom\nand Sri Lanka were carried out to refine the interview questions and identify the case studies. Case study interviews during\nthe secondary phase took place in Sri Lanka. Data collected at the preliminary stage were used to assess the attributes of\npower, legitimacy/proximity, and urgency of stakeholders to the project using Stakeholder CircleTM software. Moreover,\nthe data collected at secondary phase via case studies will be analyzed with NVivo 8. This article aims to discuss these\nmethodological underpinnings in detail applied in a post-disaster housing reconstruction context in Sri Lanka.\n",

This\nresulted in a large number of post-disaster housing reconstruction\n(PDHR) projects. A wide array of stakeholders came together on\nsuch projects to execute the final outcome. In the aftermath of\nearly reconstruction efforts, dissatisfaction was expressed by some\nstakeholders. The areas of criticism included time, cost, quality,\ncoordination with infrastructure, and linkage to livelihoods (Haigh\nKarunasena & Rameezdeen, 2010; Keraminiyage, Amaratunga,\nRameezdeen, 2008). Nevertheless, the reconstruction provided an\nopportunity for the development of Sri Lanka. Thus, the industry\nsector of Gross National Product before and after the 2004 tsu-\nnami stood at 5.4 and 8.0, respectively. This was mainly due to\nthe growth of housing output. Moreover, several acts stipulate\nthat housing is one of the three basic requirements necessary for\na standard of living and personal security. Furthermore, Nissanka\nstakeholder expectations in PDHR as an under-researched\ndomain and where further in-depth studies are required. Only a\nfew studies have been carried out to explore the expectations and\nof stakeholders caught up in disasters in Sri Lanka.Accordingly,\nthis study was undertaken to achieve the objectives as stated in\nthe section \"Aim, Objectives, and Research Questions,\" using an\nappropriate methodology.\n1University of Colombo, Sri Lanka\n2University of Huddersfield, UK\n3The University of Salford, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nNuwani Amaratunga, Faculty of Management and Finance, Department of\nAccounting, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka.\nEmail: nuwaniu@yahoo.com\nPost-Disaster Housing Reconstruction in\nSri Lanka: What Methodology?\nNuwani Amaratunga1, Richard Haigh2, and Bingunath Ingirige3\n Keywords\npost-disaster housing reconstruction, research methodology, research philosophies, research strategy, research design\n2 SAGE Open\nWhat Is Research Methodology?\nSaunders, Lewis, and Thornhill (2009) describe that methods\nare techniques and procedures used to obtain and analyze\ndata, and methodology is the theory of how research should\nbe undertaken. However, Oliver (2008) included both theo-\nretical and practical matters of data collection in the term\nmethodology. The Oxford Dictionary definition uses the\nterm method, to represent both the terms: method and meth-\nodology. It states that \"a method is a way or order of doing\nsomething where theory and practice of acting in which the\nactor seeks to achieve a true interpretation of his part by\nmentally identifying himself with the character he is play-\ning.\" Therefore, it can be concluded that methodology is an\numbrella term where methods are a part.\nAim, Objectives, and Research Questions\nThe aim of this research is to explore and investigate how to\nidentify, classify, capture, and address the needs of stake-\nholders, and manage their expectations of reconstruction\nprojects, to deliver effective PDHR in Sri Lanka.Accordingly,\nthe following objectives and questions were devised\n(Table 1).\nResearch problems lay the foundation for the decision of\nselecting an appropriate philosophy, which is discussed in\nthe section \"Research Positioning.\"\nA research paradigm is a philosophical framework that\nguides how research should be conducted, based on people's\nphilosophies and their assumptions about the world and the\nnature of the knowledge (Collis & Hussey, 2009). They\nintroduce philosophies as the use of reason and argument in\nseeking truth. Thus, any research would belong to a philoso-\nphy. Research positioning in Figure 1 is the diagrammatic\nrepresentation of this premise.\nResearch Positioning\nEasterby-Smith, Thorpe, and Lowe (2012) identify research\nphilosophies as the base for effective research design and argue\nthat failure to adhere to philosophical issues can affect the qual-\nity of the research negatively. They highlight three important\nreasons behind understanding philosophical issues in the\nresearch process. First, it helps to clarify the research design.\nSecond, it helps the researcher to identify which research\ndesigns will work and which research designs will not work\nunder different circumstances. Finally, it helps the researcher to\nidentify and create research designs that may be outside his\npast experience. Furthermore, it may also suggest how to use\ndifferent research designs within different subject areas and dif-\nferent knowledge structures. Figure 1 diagrammatically posi-\ntions the research in a philosophical continuum.\nSocial science is a branch of science that studies society\nand the relationships of individuals within a society. It\nextends its knowledge toward human behavior and its impact\non the outside world. Society does indeed possess an objec-\ntive facility and is built up by subjective meaning. Research\non managing stakeholder expectations in PDHR revolves\naround \"human relationships,\" and PDHR activities include\na socio-psychosocial element, which has a link to the outside\nworld. Therefore, this research belongs to social sciences.\nThis study combines the views of Burrell and Morgan\nBurrell and Morgan (1998) have stipulated four sets of\nassumptions: ontology, epistemology, human nature, and\nmethodology. Collins and Guba and Lincoln underline axiol-\nogy in their assumptions apart from ontology and epistemol-\nogy. Accordingly, this research takes an account of human\nnature, ontology, methodology, epistemology, axiology, and\nthe nature of the society. These help to position the research\nwithin the philosophical continuum, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nTable 1. Research Objectives and Questions of the Study.\nObjective Research questions\nIdentify and classify the stakeholders of PDHR projects in\nSri Lanka and to explore the relationships\n\n\nWho is a stakeholder in a PDHR project?\nWhat are the bases for the classification for stakeholders in PDHR?\nWhat factors determine the salience of the stakeholders?\nWhat relationships exist between these stakeholders?\nCritically examine stakeholder requirements of post-\ndisaster housing reconstruction projects in Sri Lanka\nWhat strategies/programs are adopted in post-disaster housing?\n What are the needs/expectations and gaps of PDHR in Sri Lanka?\nCompare and contrast stakeholder needs and the\nexpectations of PDHR projects\nWhat needs and expectations are common to PDHR projects?\n What needs and expectations are unique to PDHR projects?\nCritically evaluate the strategies and mechanisms used by\nreconstruction projects to capture and address the needs\nof stakeholders and manage their expectations of PDHR\nHow do strategies and mechanisms varied between the projects?\nDevelop recommendations for effectively identifying,\nclassifying, and managing stakeholders to deliver\nsuccessful PDHR\nHow do successful PDHR help theory development?\nNote. PDHR = Post-Disaster Housing Reconstruction.\nAmaratunga et al. 3\nObjectivity and subjectivity. If the reality is an observable phe-\nnomena, with evidence it is said to be objective. The other\nextreme of the continuum, subjectivity, refers to the percep-\ntion of reality by individuals, which is influenced by per-\nsonal beliefs. Thus, Saunders et al. (2009) assessed that\nsocial entities exist in a reality external to social actors.\nDisasters triggered by natural hazards are most of the time\nunpredictable and do not exist to be perceived objectively.\nHowever, man-made and human-induced disasters are not\nunexpected all the time. The PDHR process, procedures, and\npolicies, however, are regularized but subject to change.\nTherefore, the study is more toward subjective axis of the\ncontinuum.\nHuman nature.Human nature is the subject and object of\nenquiry (Burrell & Morgan, 1979). These can identify the\nperspectives in social science, which entail a view of human\nbeings responding in a mechanistic or even deterministic\nfashion to the situations encountered in the external world\n(Burrell & Morgan, 1979). Human beings cannot be divorced\nfrom their natural environment. For example, during PDHR,\na variety of stakeholders emerge. Thus, these stakeholder\nexpectations vary from each other. This may depend on the\ntype of house they received, education and socio-economic\nbackground, values, and attitudes. Human behavior in the\nsocial scientific theory too varies between determinism and\nvoluntarism (Burrell & Morgan, 1979). Deterministic nature\ndepends completely on the situation, environment, or the\norganizational factors, which affects the behavior and activi-\nties of a human being. In voluntarism, it is expected that the\nhuman enjoys the autonomy and is free willed.\nIf PDHR is taken as a situation, the strategies to manage\nthe stakeholder expectations are determined partly by free\nwill and partly by the government and organizational/project\npolicies and procedures. Nevertheless, voluntary mecha-\nnisms could emerge because of the urgent and chaotic atmo-\nsphere after a disaster. It can be concluded that human nature\nin this study is a blend of determinism and voluntarism.\nOntology. Ontology refers to the assumptions that we make\nabout the nature of reality (Easterby-Smith et al., 2012).\nSocial scientists are faced with a basic ontological question:\nwhether the \"reality\" to be investigated is external to the\nindividual--imposing itself on individual consciousness\nfrom without--or whether it is a product of individual con-\nsciousness; whether \"reality\" is objective nature or the prod-\nuct of individual cognition; or whether reality is given out\nthere in the world or the product of one's mind (Burrell &\nBurrell and Morgan (1979) hold a viewpoint on realism,\nwhich is at one end of ontology that social world is external\nto individual cognition and is a real world made up of tangi-\nble and relatively immutable structures. The individual is\nseen as being born into a living, within a social world that has\na reality of its own, which exists out there. Idealists believe\nthat reality is made up of ideas or thoughts and individuals\nhave differing viewpoints. Thus, what counts for truth can\nvary from place to place and from time to time. Hence,\nnames, concepts, and labels created are regarded as artificial\ncreations whose utility is based on convenience for descrip-\ntion, making sense and negotiation in the external world\n(Burrell & Morgan, 1979). Accordingly, Morgan and\nSmircich (1980) recently developed a six-way classification\nof the nature of the social world: reality as a concrete struc-\nture, reality as a concrete process, reality as a contextual field\nof information, reality as symbolic discourse, reality as social\nconstruction, and reality as projection of human imagination.\nReality as a social construction is the most suited classifica-\ntion to this research due to the reasons stated below.\nIn this study, identification and classification of stake-\nholders of PDHR, exploring their relationships based on\nsalience, and strategies to manage the expectations depend-\ning on the type of housing project, are perceived differently\ndepending on the situation and usage. The researcher ana-\nlyzed the subject matters by being an observer of the project.\nFurthermore, the research environment is not expected to\ncontrol and simplify with assumptions. Thus, observation\npartially contributes in developing explanations and theories\nin relation to PDHR in Sri Lanka. Hence, this research favors\nidealism.\nMethod. Methodology is the technique used by the researcher\nto investigate the reality and obtain the knowledge (Burrell\n(2007) explained it as theory and analysis of how research\nshould proceed. As such, for this study, it is presumed to be\nthe process by which the research is carried out.\nFigure 1. Research positioning within the philosophical\ncontinuum.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe philosophical underpinning of methodology falls\nbetween Nomothetic and Ideographic stances. Nomothetic\ntheory depends on the scientific method, where the researcher\nfollows a protocol and testing of hypotheses by using quanti-\ntative techniques. The ideographic approach assumes that\none can understand the social world only by obtaining first-\nhand knowledge of the subject under investigation.\nGill and Johnson (2002) present a comparison between\nthe Nomothetic (realist) and Ideographic (idealism) method-\nologies, as summarized in Table 2.\nAccordingly, this research requires the researcher to be a\npart of the environment, and interaction with the stakehold-\ners is needed to unearth the viewpoints in relation to PDHR\nprojects. In this process, it is important to identify stakehold-\ners of PDHR projects and the strategies to manage the expec-\ntations of different type of housing projects. Hence, the\nresearcher cannot be an independent actor from the context.\nFurthermore, the research necessitates an in-depth analysis\nto gather detailed facts about the research environment.\nHowever, this study favors social constructivism and takes\nan ideographic stance.\nEpistemology. This is the relationship between that reality and\nthe researcher (Healy & Perry, 2000). Burrell and Morgan\n(1979) perceived it as how one might understand the world\nand communicate this knowledge to fellow human beings. A\nquestion can be posed as to whether the knowledge can be\nacquired or it has to be personally experienced. In other\nwords, what constitutes acceptable knowledge, either past or\npresent, in a field of study?\nPositivism is based on the assumption that there are uni-\nversal laws that govern social events, and uncovering these\nlaws enables researchers to describe, predict, and control\nsocial phenomena (Wardlow, 1989). Positivism assumes\nimplicitly or explicitly that reality can be measured by view-\ning it through a one-way, value-free mirror (Healy & Perry,\n2000). In positivism, the researcher can replicate the findings\nand emphasize on quantifiable observations that lend them-\nselves to statistical analysis (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill,\npositivism has different forms such as hermeneutics, inter-\npretive structuralist perspective but firmly set against utility\nof laws or underlying regularities. In contrast, this study was\nsubject to underlying laws and regulation of PDHR in Sri\nLanka. Furthermore, they state that social world is relativis-\ntic and can only be understood from the point of view of the\nindividual who are directly involved in the activities to be\nstudied. Also anti-positivistic researchers reject the stand-\npoint of the \"observer,\" a position that characterizes positiv-\nistic study.\nSocial constructionists believe that the reality is socially\nconstructed, where differing viewpoints have emerged. Thus,\npositivists believe that observer must be independent, human\ninterset must be irreevant, explanations demonstrate causalty,\nresaerch progresses through hypotheses and deduction, con-\ncepts need to be operationalized where these can be mea-\nsured, units of analysis should be reduced to the simplest\nterms, generalisation through statistical probability, sam-\npling is required where large numbers are selected randomly\n(Easterby-Smith et al., 2012). According to Easterby-Smith\net al., (2012) in social constuctionism observer is a part of\nwhat is being observed, human interests are the main drivers\nof the science, explanations aim to increase general under-\nstanding of the situation, research progresses through gather-\ning rich data where ideas are induced, concepts should\nincorporate stakeholder perspectives, units of analysis may\ninclude the compexity of \"whole\" situation, generalisation\nthrough theoretical abstraction and sampling requires small\nnumber of cases chosen for specific reasons. These set the\nscene for main differences between positivism and social\nconstructionism in this research too.\nBy considering the aforementioned characteristics, a\nsocial constructionism approach has been deemed to be more\nappropriate to this research than a positivist philosophy.\nBerger and Luckmann (1967) viewed that social constructiv-\nism as a blend of a social reality and symbolic interaction,\nwhere the reality we collectively experience has, in fact,\nbeen constructed by our social interactions. As set out in the\n\"Aim, Objectives, and Research Questions\" section, this\nresearch aimed to explore how to identify, classify, and man-\nage stakeholder expectations, so that construction enterprises\ncan deliver effective disaster housing reconstruction in Sri\nLanka, which necessitates the researcher to be a part of the\nenvironment. Thus, it is the journey of creating the reality\nwith and through relationships or interactions (with stake-\nholders) of the external environment, as it is believed that\nTable 2.

As\nsuch, it invalidates embracing a strong positivist approach.\nAxiology.Axiology discusses the values that are attached to\nknowledge and help to determine what are recognized as\nfacts and the interpretations that are drawn from them (Collis\n& Hussey, 2009). Positivists believe that science and the pro-\ncess of research is value free, in contrast to the social con-\nstructionists' viewpoint of research, which accepts values. In\nvalue-free research, the choice of what to study and how to\nstudy is determined by objective criteria, while in value-\nladen research, the choice is determined by human beliefs\nand experiences (Easterby-Smith et al., 2012). As this\nresearch is of an exploratory nature and interpretation of\nstakeholders forms a major component of understanding the\nreality, it is value laden. Hence, a social constructionist\napproach is more suitable.\nResearch on stakeholder expectations in a PDHR scenario\nrevolves around human (stakeholders) and organizational\nactivities (strategies and mechanisms), and thereby can be\nfound under the social science end of the research contin-\nuum. The research is positioned within the philosophical\ncontinuum in terms of human nature, ontology, epistemol-\nogy, methodology, and axiological assumptions. To capture\nthe reality (ontology) and human nature, certain methodolo-\ngies should be used. However, the tool of acquisition and\ndissemination of knowledge (epistemology) is the methodol-\nogy. The assumptions can be placed on two extreme ends,\ndepending on the objective or subjective nature of the study.\nPositioning of this study is not completely at one end because\na subjective as well as objective element is embedded in the\nphilosophical assumptions.\nResearch Strategy\nResearch strategy describes the directions or ways in which\nresearch is conducted (Remenyi, Williams, Money, &\nSwartz, 2003). A method is a way or order of doing some-\nthing in theory and practice, whereby the actor seeks to\n\"achieve a true interpretation of his part by mentally identi-\nfying himself with the character he is playing\" (Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, 1989). Hence research methods refer to\nways of testing the validity of phenomena, or theory(ies) or\nhypothesis(es). Yin (2009) identifies three conditions that\nhave to be considered when selecting the appropriate research\nstrategy. They are the type of research question posed, the\nextent of control an investigator has over the actual behav-\nioral events, and the degree of focus on contemporary event.\nResearch strategy also depends on the philosophical stances\non human nature, ontology, methodology, epistemology, and\naxiology. The research on managing stakeholder expectations\nof post-disaster housing projects in Sri Lanka favors social\nconstructivism as the research can be positioned due to the\nsubjective nature of the study. In addition to the research ques-\ntions and objectives, and the philosophical underpinnings of\nthe research, the choice of research strategy will be directed\nby the extent of existing knowledge, and the amount of time\nand other resources available (Saunders et al., 2009).\nResearch strategies commonly used by business and man-\nagement researchers are experiment, survey, case study,\naction research, and ethnography (Easterby-Smith et al.,\nExperiment and survey methods reside closer to the posi-\ntivism end of the continuum. Experiments are widely used in\nnatural science research where a test of hypothesis, theory,\nand law are involved. An experiment involves controlling\none \"input\" variable, holding all others constant (to the best\nof your ability), and measuring the effect on an output vari-\nable of a change in the control variable. Stakeholder expecta-\ntions of PDHR cannot be tested in a laboratory environment\nand cannot be manipulated. Thus, this strategy is not appro-\npriate for this study. However, a survey does not need a con-\ntrolled environment. The meaning of results from a survey\nwill be enhanced if an analysis plan is generated prior to data\ncollection; then interpretations of the results will more likely\nbe a reflection of patterns in the data and a basis for knowing\nmore about the essential \"what is\" of the world being sur-\nveyed. However, research on stakeholder expectations in\nPDHR requires in-depth study of construction project stake-\nholders. The survey method is therefore not a compatible\noption. In action research, the researcher tries to solve the\nproblem by being a part within the problem environment\nwith the goal to change the status quo of the situation by\nchanging attitudes or the behavior of participants (Waser &\nJohns, 2003). This needs partial control of the environment,\nagain making it unsuitable.\nEthnography is a holistic research method where the\nresearcher becomes a part and parcel of the environment\nbeing studied as a participant observer interacting with social\ngroups. These observations and interactions enable the eth-\nnographer to understand how the group develops a skein of\nrelations and cultural constructions that tie it together over a\nprolonged period of time. The time factor and the need to be\na participant observer are significant constraints that prevent\nits use for this study. Due to the constraints stated, the most\nappropriate approach for this research is case studies. Yin\n(2009) defines a case study as \"an empirical inquiry that\ninvestigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real life\ncontext, especially when the boundaries between phenome-\nnon and context are not clearly evident.\" Both \"what\" type of\nexploratory questions and \"why\" types of explanatory ques-\ntions are covered by this approach. Research on stakeholder\nexpectations from construction projects, in the context of\nPDHR, does not intend to control/manipulate the environ-\nment under examination and does not intend to interfere with\nthe attitudes, perceptions, or the procedures of the environ-\nment (as in the case of action research), but does analyze\ncontemporary events and requires an in-depth study on the\nselected environment. It will be advantageous to rely on mul-\ntiple sources of evidence, and the selection of a small sample\n6 SAGE Open\nto allow an in-depth study requires exploring and analyzing\nthe \"real-life\" context of stakeholder expectation of disaster\nreconstruction. Therefore, case study qualifies as the most\nappropriate strategy. Accordingly, the case study design is\nexplained in the next section.\nResearch Design\nYin (2009) created a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix for the basic types of case\nstudy designs, determining the choice between single versus\nmultiple case studies and a holistic versus embedded unit of\nanalysis. A single case study is appropriate over a multiple\ncase when the circumstances are critical, unique, representa-\ntive, revelatory, or longitudinal. The study in question does not\nfall under these categories, and thus multiple case studies are\npreferred over a single case study. Multiple case studies pro-\nvide a rich ground for the usage of replication logic through\nmultiple sources of evidence. Literature review supports the-\nory building via research questions. Thus, multiple case stud-\nies will verify them. It is intended to claim literal replication\nby comparing the findings from the multiple case studies, and\nthe study in question addresses generalization through analyti-\ncal generalization, rather than statistical generalization.\nThe second choice between holistic versus embedded\ncase study designs is based on the selection of the unit of\nanalysis of the study. The research questions of the study\nmainly reflect the requirement of delivering stakeholder\nexpectations, in PDHR leaving stakeholder expectation as\nthe main unit of analysis and housing reconstruction projects\nform the boundary of the study. The research questions are\ncomposed of \"what\" type of exploratory questions and\n\"how\" type of explanatory questions. However, the objec-\ntives on the whole are of an exploratory nature. Hence, the\ndesign adopted in this study is multiple, holistic exploratory\ncase studies. The next section elaborates on the research\ntechniques used in the case study.\nResearch Techniques\nResearch techniques can be described under two major\nphases of the study: the data collection and data analysis\ntechniques.\nData Collection Techniques\nThree principles for data collection can be identified in case\nstudy research (Yin, 2009). The first principle emphasizes the\nimportance of multiple sources of evidence, where six sources\nof data collection have been identified. Those are documents,\narchival records, interviews, direct observation, participant\nobservation, and physical artifacts. The rationale for using the\nmultiple sources of evidence has been described as the\nTriangulation (Yin, 2009). Data triangulation eliminates\nproblems related to construct validity that is an important\naspect when determining the quality of case study research.\nYin (2009) further states the fact that, the benefits from the\nabove six sources of evidence can be maximized, if the two\nprinciples--to create a case study database and to maintain a\nchain of evidence--are adhered to. The main purpose of the\ncase study database is that it provides the critical reader with\nan opportunity to go back to the raw data as and when required\n(Yin, 2009). The chain of evidence makes the case study more\nreliable where the case study reviewer is allowed to follow the\nderivation of the evidence from the research question forma-\ntion to the case study conclusions.\nData collection comprises two phases, preliminary and\nsecondary. Exploratory interviews with construction experts\nin the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka were carried out to\nrefine the interview questions and identify the case studies.\nCase study interviews during the secondary phase took place\nin Sri Lanka.\nData collected at the preliminary stage was used to assess\nthe attributes of power, legitimacy/proximity, and urgency of\nstakeholders to the project using Stakeholder CircleTM soft-\nware. Moreover, the data collected at secondary phase via\ncase studies will be analyzed with NVivo 8.\nCoding of textual data collected from interviews were\ncarried out through content analysis. This is a method that\ncompresses many words into fewer content categories\ndate that it involves codifying qualitative and quantitative\ninformation into pre-defined categories to derive patterns in\nthe presentation and reporting of information. Furthermore,\nGuthrie and Mathews (1985) noted that, content analysis has\nbeen widely used in corporate social responsibility (CSR)\nand corporate governance (CG) research (Ryan & Ng, 2000).\nCognitive mapping was used to display and identify relation-\nships of concepts derived from interviews and observations.\nConclusion\nResearch methodology is the key to conduct a social research.\nResearch philosophies are the core to a seminal piece of\nresearch. The discussion on Post-Disaster Housing\nReconstruction in Sri Lanka: What Methodology? has identi-\nfied social constructivism or interpretivism as the best-suited\nphilosophy. Multiple, holistic case studies form the research\nstrategy. Pilot interviews with experts who got involved in\nPDHR projects are used to formulate the research questions,\nand case study interviews were conducted to validate the\nsame. Data analysis will be carried out in aid of software,\nNVivo 8 and Stakeholder CircleTM.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nAmaratunga et al. 7\nReferences\nBerger, P.
