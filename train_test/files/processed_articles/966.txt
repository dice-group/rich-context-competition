The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between religious meaning and subjective well-\nbeing. A major emphasis is placed on assessing race differences in the relationship between these constructs.\nMethods. Interviews were conducted with a nationwide sample of older White and older Black adults. Survey items\nwere administered to assess a sense of meaning in life that is derived specifically from religion. Subjective well-being was\nmeasured with indices of life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism.\nResults. The findings suggest that older adults who derive a sense of meaning in life from religion tend to have higher\nlevels of life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism. The data further reveal that older Black adults are more likely to find\nmeaning in religion than older White adults. In addition, the relationships among religious meaning, life satisfaction, self-\nesteem, and optimism tend to be stronger for older African Americans persons than older White persons.\nDiscussion. Researchers have argued for some time that religion may be an important source of resilience for older\nBlack adults, but it is not clear how these beneficial effects arise. The data from this study suggest that religious meaning\nmay be an important factor.\nArapidly growing literature suggests that greater involve-\nment in religion is associated with better physical health,\nbetter mental health, and enhanced feelings of subjective well-\nbeing across the life course (Ellison, 1994; Koenig, McCul-\nwell-being, the potentially beneficial effects of religion have\nbeen observed with a wide range of outcomes, including life\nsatisfaction (Ellison, 1993), happiness (Poloma & Pendleton,\n1997). Although this research has provided many valuable\ninsights, it is less evident how the potentially beneficial effects\nof religion on subjective well-being arise. Part of the difficulty\nmay be traced to the fact that religion is a complex\nmultidimensional phenomenon that may affect well-being in\na number of different ways (Ellison & Levin, 1998). For ex-\nample, research indicates that religious coping (Pargament,\nsocial support (Krause, Ellison, & Wulff, 1998) may all play\na role in this process.\nTo understand more fully the relationship between religion\nand well-being, it is important to expand the scope of inquiry\nby turning to dimensions of religion that have been overlooked\nby other investigators. The purpose of the present study is to\nexamine one such facet of religion--religious meaning. A\nthorough review of the literature failed to uncover a satisfactory\ndefinition of religious meaning. Therefore, for the purposes of\nthis study, religious meaning is defined as the process of\nturning to religion in an effort to find a sense of purpose in life,\na sense of direction in life, and a sense that there is a reason for\none's existence. Although there has been little prior empirical\nwork with religious meaning, there is good reason to suspect it\nmay be associated with subjective well-being. Frankl (1963)\nargued that the desire to find a sense of meaning is the primary\nmotivational force in life. Moreover, a number of investigators\nbelieve that one of the basic functions of religion is to help\npeople fulfill this fundamental need. Evidence of this may be\nfound, for example, in the classic work of Clark (1958), who\nargued that, ``... religion more than any other human function\nsatisfies the need for meaning in life'' (p. 419). Similarly, in the\nprocess of developing his thought-provoking discussion of\nsignificance, Pargament (1997) observed that, ``In essence,\nreligion offers meaning in life'' (p. 49).\nSatisfying basic needs in life should be associated with\nenhanced feelings of subjective well-being (Maslow, 1971). If\nfinding meaning in life is a basic goal of human existence, and\nreligion helps people find meaning, it follows that religious\nmeaning should be associated with greater subjective well-\nbeing.\nThe first goal of the present study is to see whether religious\nmeaning is related to subjective well-being in late life. But\nrather than focus on this relationship alone, this study aims to\ncontribute to the literature by bringing the potentially\nimportant influence of race to the foreground. This line of\ninquiry is justified because an extensive literature suggests that\nolder African American persons are substantially more\ninvolved in religion than older White persons (Levin, Taylor,\n& Chatters, 1994). To the extent this is true, race differences\nmay arise at two key junctures in this study. First, older Black\nadults may be more likely than older White adults to derive\na sense of meaning in life from religion. Second, the impact of\nreligious meaning on subjective well-being may be stronger\nfor older Black than older White adults. There do not appear to\nbe any studies in the literature that evaluate the interface\nbetween religious meaning, race, and subjective well-being in\nlate life.\nThe discussion that follows is divided into three main\nsections. First, the theoretical underpinnings of the study are\ndeveloped in greater detail. Second, the study sample and\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2003 by The Gerontological Society of America\nmeasures are presented. The data analytic strategy is briefly\npresented at this juncture as well. Finally, results from\na nationwide survey of older Black and older White adults\nare reviewed and discussed.\nReligious Meaning and Subjective\nWell-Being in Late Life\nThe theoretical rationale for this study is developed below in\nfour components. First, an effort is made to clarify the nature of\nreligious meaning by showing how it differs from a construct\nthat has been examined more often in the literature--a general\nsense of meaning in life. Second, a rationale is provided for\nwhy religious meaning may be related to subjective well-being.\nThird, a case is made for why it is important to study religious\nmeaning and well-being in samples composed of older people.\nFinally, the reasons why there may be race differences in\nreligious meaning and subjective well-being are examined in\ngreater detail.\nReligious meaning and a general sense of meaning in life. --\nMost research in the field focuses on a general sense of\nmeaning in life (Reker, 1997). This construct is differentiated\nfrom religious meaning by its scope or focus. As Reker (2000)\npoints out, a general sense of meaning in life can arise from any\nnumber of sources, including personal relationships, work,\nhobbies, and religion. In contrast, religious meaning obviously\narises from one source alone. To date, most studies on religious\nissues rely on a general sense of meaning in life. For example,\nPetersen and Roy (1985) found that religious salience (i.e., the\nimportance of religion) is associated with a greater sense of\ngeneral meaning in life. However, they did not empirically\nevaluate meaning that arises specifically from religion, nor did\nthey assess whether religious meaning is associated with\nsubjective well-being. A major contribution of the present study\narises from the fact that an effort is made to address these gaps\nin the literature.\nResearch that focuses specifically on religious meaning is\nimportant for the following reason. The wider intent of this\nstudy is to find out why religion may be associated with\nsubjective well-being in late life. If meaning plays a role in this\nrespect, then it makes more sense to focus on meaning as it\narises specifically from religion. If a general sense of meaning\nwas used instead, it would be more difficult to know if the\neffects were from religion, work, interpersonal relationships, or\nsome other secular influence.\nReligious meaning and subjective well-being. --Berger's\n(1990) widely cited work on religion helps show why religious\nmeaning may influence feelings of subjective well-being.\nBerger maintained that people are inevitably confronted with\na series of painful and discrepant situations in life that often are\nnot amenable to change. Included among these difficulties are\nthe presence of evil and suffering in the world, as well as the\nunavoidable prospect of death. He argued that religion helps\npeople deal with these challenges by providing theodicies.\nTheodicies are religiously based world views that explain\nthings like death, and show how they fit into a larger cosmic\norder or purpose. Berger (1990) asserted that people who\nsubscribe to and internalize these theodicies derive a deeper\nsense of meaning and purpose in life. In contrast, he argued that\npeople who are unable to accept religious theodicies are more\nlikely to experience a state of anomy, which is a painful\nseparation from the wider social order that casts the individual\ninto a deep sense of inner turmoil.\nIt is surprising to find that there are relatively few empirical\nstudies that assess Berger's (1990) notion of theodicies. One\nnoteworthy exception is the work of Musick (2000). However,\nhis operational definition of theodicies was fairly narrow because\nit focused only on the degree to which individuals feel the world,\nand the people in it, are evil or sinful (i.e., sin theodicies).\nHis findings reveal that people who subscribe to sin theodicies\ntend to have lower levels of life satisfaction than individuals\nwho hold more positive views about the nature of the world.\nHowever, it is important to point out that these findings held for\nWhite study participants, but not Black study participants.\nAlthough the work of Musick (2000) provides valuable\ninsight into the potentially important role of religious\ntheodicies, more research is needed. More specifically, the\ninterface between religious theodicies and well-being needs\nto be evaluated with measures that encompass more than\njust beliefs about sin and evil. Consistent with the original\nformulation developed by Berger (1990), measures are needed\nthat assess beliefs about the wider meaning and purpose in life.\nThese broader measures of religious meaning form the focal\npoint of the analyses presented herein.\nSubjective well-being is assessed in this study with three\nmeasures: life satisfaction, self-esteem, and optimism. Conse-\nquently, it is important to show why religious meaning might\nbe related to each of these outcomes. There are good reasons\nto suspect that religious meaning may be related to life\nsatisfaction. One of the key functions of religious meaning is to\nprovide a better understanding of adversity and the challenges\nthat arise in life. But more than this, religious meaning helps\na person see the larger reasons for difficult situations that lie\nbeyond their own immediate concerns, expectations, and\naspirations. Attaining these insights, and believing their lives\nfit into a larger plan or purpose, may be a source of significant\npersonal growth for some individuals. Realizing that one has\ngrown in the face of adversity may, in turn, be an important\nsource of life satisfaction.\nThere are relatively straightforward reasons why religious\nmeaning may be associated with self-esteem. If older people\nbelieve that God has a purpose and a plan for their life, then it\nmust mean that God loves and cares for them. Because feelings\nof self-esteem arise, in part, from views of the self that are held\nby significant others, believing that God values, loves, and\ncares for them should bolster the self-esteem of older people.\nFinally, it seems reasonable to assume that if people believe\nreligion provides a sense of direction and purpose in life, they\nwill feel more optimistic about the future. In fact, this is one\nreason why Peterson (2000) argued that, ``Religion lends itself\nparticularly well to big optimism because of its certainty''\n(p. 51). Similarly, Seligman (1990) maintained that religious\nmeaning enhances feelings of optimism by helping people see\nthat their lives will follow a specific and beneficial plan that has\nReligious meaning and aging. --There are two reasons why it\nis important to study the relationship between religious meaning\nand well-being in samples comprising older people. First, as\ndiscussed previously, Berger (1990) maintained that religious\ntheodicies help people deal with painful life circumstances that\nare not changed easily. Older people are often confronted by this\ntype of difficulty. More specifically, as Nuland's (1993) book on\nthe physiology of aging reveals, physical decline is an unavoid-\nable part of growing older. Although it is true that the timing and\nrate of decline may vary from person to person, the fact that\ndecline will eventually occur is certain. In addition, there is some\nevidence that cognitive abilities tend to diminish as a number of\npeople go through late life. More specifically, research indicates\nthat approximately 29% of people aged 75 and older have\neither mild or severe cognitive impairment (George, Landerman,\nBlazer, & Anthony, 1991). Clearly, when coupled with the close\nproximity of death, finding a larger meaning and purpose in life\nthroughreligion may helpolder people deal more effectively with\nthese intractable physical and mental health changes.\nThere is also some evidence that the physical and mental\nhealth changes associated with aging may be accompanied by\ncertain psychological challenges, as well. This is evident in the\nwork of developmental theorists, such as Erikson (1959). He\nmaintained that, as people approach late life, they enter the final\nstage of development that is characterized by the crisis of\nintegrity versus despair. This is a time of deep introspection,\nwhen older people survey their lives, attempt to reconcile the\nthings they have done, and make sense of the experiences they\n1953). Viewed broadly, a common theme cuts across the work\non adult development. In particular, this literature suggests that,\nas people get older, they carefully re-evaluate the past in\nan effort to weave their lives into a more coherent whole.\nUltimately, the goal of this process is to imbue life with a deeper\nsense of meaning. It is especially important to point out that\neveryone does not resolve these developmental challenges\nsuccessfully, and as a Erikson (1959) argued, they may sub-\nsequently slip into despair.\nTornstam (1997) provides further evidence of how key\ndevelopmental challenges may shape a sense of meaning\nand well-being in late life. More specifically, his theory of\ngerotranscendence specifies that, as people grow older, they\nexperience a major shift, ``... from a materialistic and\npragmatic view of the world to a more cosmic and transcendent\none, normally accompanied by an increase in life satisfaction''\nthat this cosmic perspective involves adopting a wider view of\nthe nature and purpose of life.\nAlthough people of all ages engage in a search for meaning\nin life, there may be age differences in the function or goal of\nthis process. This may be seen by turning to the work of\nStaudinger (2001) on life reviews and reminiscence. She argued\nthat younger people reflect on the broad issues in their lives to\nfind solutions to a pressing life decision. In contrast, older\npeople engage in life reviews in an effort to strike a balance in\nlife and to integrate their lives more tightly as they have been\nlived. Even though reminiscence may help people of all ages, it\nappears to have a more immediate or pragmatic focus among\nthe young that does not typically involve wider insights that are\ngleaned from reflecting deeply on the past. In contrast, by using\nlife reviews to integrate a broad array of past experiences, older\nadults may be in a better position to see wider themes and\npurposes in life.\nIn addition to reviewing the work of developmental the-\norists, there is a second way to show why it is important to\nstudy religious meaning and well-being in late life. Some\ninvestigators maintain that people tend to become more\nreligious as they grow older. For example, using data that\nhad been gathered from the same respondents over a 40-year\nperiod, Wink and Dillon (2001) reported that the importance of\nreligion decreased through early and middle adulthood, but\nthen increased significantly during the later years of life. Based\non a comparable measure of the importance of religion, Argue\nand her colleagues also found a pattern of nonlinear change\nwith age, but the results were more complex (Argue, Johnson,\n& White, 1999). More specifically, these investigators found\nthat the age effect of religion was stronger for Catholics than\nProtestants. Ploch and Hastings (1994) reported that church\nattendance increases sharply up to about age 70. Like Argue\nchurch attendance increases with age, but the relationship\nbetween these measures varies by religious preference (see,\nIt is important to note that not all researchers would agree\nthat religiousness increases with age. For example, Davie and\nVincent (1998) review evidence suggesting that researchers\nmay merely be observing cohort and not age effects. Neverthe-\nless, when taken as a whole, there is some evidence in the\nliterature that religiousness increases with age. If this is true,\nand a central function of religion is to provide a sense of\nmeaning in life, then perhaps religious meaning may become\nincreasingly important as people grow older.\nRace differences in religious meaning and well-being. --The\ntheoretical rationale provided up to this point suggests that\nreligious meaning may promote a sense of psychological well-\nbeing among older people. But, consistent with the specific\naims for this study, it is important to think about how race\ndifferences may arise in this relationship.\nA considerable number of studies suggest that older Black\nadults are more deeply involved in religion than older White\nadults. In one of the more comprehensive studies, Levin and\ncolleagues (1994) explored race differences in religion across\nfour national surveys. Race comparisons were made on 21\nindicators of religion that were contained in these different data\nbases. The findings indicated that older Black adults were more\nreligious than older White adults in 19 of the 21 tests. This\nstudy revealed, for example, that compared with older White\nadults, older Black adults attend church more often, read\nreligious books more often, and feel that religion is more\nimportant in their lives.\nA key premise in the present study is that some fundamental\nunderlying factor must be at work for race differences to\nemerge in such a wide range of religion measures. The purpose\nof the discussion that follows is threefold: (1) to show that this\nunderlying factor is religious meaning; (2) to briefly trace the\nhistorical origins of this influence; and (3) to consider how the\neffects of religious meaning on well-being might be manifest\namong older White and older Black adults.\nIn a thought-provoking volume, Cooper-Lewter and Mitchell\n(1986) propose that, at the basis of Black culture, is a set of\ncore religious beliefs, or religious world views. Included among\nthe 10 core religious beliefs they identified are beliefs about the\nKRAUSE\nnature of God and His relationship to man, as well as beliefs\nabout basic human nature and the way people should relate to\neach other. They go on to point out that these core religious\nbeliefs, ``... are the bedrock attitudes that govern all deliberate\nbehavior and relationships and also all spontaneous responses\nto crises'' (Cooper-Lewter & Mitchell, 1986, p. 3). Although\nthese researchers do not use the term ``religious meaning''\nexplicitly, it is hard to imagine how these core religious beliefs\ncould function without fostering a deep sense of religious\nmeaning.\nSimilar views are expressed by Ellison (1993). He argues\nthat one of the primary functions of the church in the Black\ncommunity is to provide individuals with a sense of their own\ninherent uniqueness as individuals. Moreover, the church\npromotes and rewards a range of spiritual qualities, including\nwisdom and morality. These important functions are, in turn,\nlikely to promote a sense of meaning in life.\nA key issue at this juncture is to determine why these core\nreligious beliefs and functions achieved such an elevated status\nin the Black community. There are clear historical reasons why\nthis may be so. A number of investigators maintain that because\nof centuries of discrimination and prejudice, the church became\nthe social center of the Black community (Du Bois, 1903/\n2000). In addition to being the center of religious training and\nworship, the church also became the nucleus of social activities\nand a conduit for the dispersion of social services (Billingsley,\nassumed this pivotal position because it was the only institution\nin the Black community that was wholly owned and controlled\nby Black persons. But the wider historical forces that were at\nwork did more than just shape the organizational aspects of\nthe church. In addition, these historical influences shaped the\ncontent of Black theology as well. More specifically, Paris\n(1995) maintained that religion in the African American\ncommunity is guided by a ``survival theology.'' Arising from\ncenturies of slavery, discrimination, and prejudice, this survival\ntheology emphasizes, ``... the maintenance, preservation, and\nenhancement of meaningful life ... in the midst of the actual\nexperience of suffering and the existential threat of death ...''\n(p. 48). An insightful qualitative study by Black (1999) further\nhighlights the role played by meaning in Black theology. She\nfound Black women were able to find meaning in poverty and\nracism because they, ``... interpreted it as a measure of their\nstrength, imbued it with divine purpose, and foresaw a just\nAlthough religious meaning may play a more central role in\nthe lives of older Black people, it is important to reflect\ncarefully on how the effects of religious meaning may be\nmanifest. A basic premise in the present study is that there are\ntwo ways to think about this issue. First, older Black people\nmay be more likely than older White people to find a sense of\nmeaning in religion. This differential involvement perspective\nmay be evaluated by either looking at mean differences in\nreligious meaning for older White and older Black people or by\nregressing religious meaning on race.\nIn contrast, a second view specifies that the relationship\nbetween religious meaning and subjective well-being is\nstronger for older Black than for older White persons. This\nmeans that, even though older Black and older White people\nmay have the same religious meaning score, the relationship\nbetween religious meaning and well-being is stronger for older\nBlacks than older White people. This differential impact per-\nspective suggests there may be something qualitatively different\nabout the nature of religious meaning in the Black community,\nor that some unique facet of religious meaning is an espe-\ncially important source of resilience for older Black people.\nThe survival theology discussed by Paris (1995) provides one\nexample of how religious meaning may be qualitatively\ndifferent in the Black community. Evidence of the differential\nimpact perspective would be found by testing for a statistical\ninteraction effect between religious meaning and race on\nsubjective well-being.\nIt is important to point out that the differential involvement\nand the differential impact perspectives are not mutually\nexclusive and that both may be operating at the same time. In\ncontrast, only one of the two viewpoints may accurately capture\nthe underlying process that is at work. Either way, comparing\nand contrasting the two approaches should provide valuable\ninsight into the nature of the relationships among race, religious\nmeaning, and subjective well-being in late life. There do not\nappear to be any studies in the literature that either discuss or\nempirically evaluate these two perspectives. Doing so repre-\nsents another major contribution of the work presented below.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data for this study come from a nationwide survey of\nolder Whites and older African American people. The study\npopulation was defined as all household residents who were\neither White or Black, noninstitutionalized, English-speaking,\nand at least 66 years of age. Geographically, the study pop-\nulation was restricted to eligible persons residing in the co-\nterminous United States (i.e., residents of Alaska and Hawaii\nwere excluded). Finally, the study was restricted to people who\nwere currently practicing Christians, individuals who were\nChristians in the past but no longer practice any religion, and\npeople who were not affiliated with any faith at any point in\ntheir lifetime. Individuals who practice a religion other than\nChristianity (e.g., Jews and Muslims) were excluded, because it\nwould be difficult to devise a set of religion measures that are\nsuitable for persons of all faiths.\nThe sampling frame consisted of eligible persons contained\nin the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Medicare\nBeneficiary Eligibility List (HCFA is now called the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services). This list contains the\nname, address, sex, and race of virtually every person in the\nUnited States. It should be emphasized that people are included\nin this list even if they are not receiving Social Security\nbenefits. Nevertheless, some older people are not in the data\nbase because they do not have a Social Security number. This\nmay be because of factors such as illegal immigration.\nA five-step procedure was used to draw the sample. First,\nonce each year, researchers at HCFA draw a 5% sample of\nnames from their master file. These names are selected with\na simple random sampling procedure. The sampled names\ninclude individuals who are 65 years of age or older. However,\nby the time the field period for the present study began, subjects\nin the 5% file were at least 66 years of age. It is for this reason\nthat the study population was defined earlier as including\npeople who were 66 years of age or older. In the second step\nof the sampling procedure, the 5% file was split into two\nsubfiles--one containing older White and the other containing\nolder Black people. Each file was sorted by county and then by\nzip code within each county. Then, in the third step, an nth\ninterval was calculated for each file based on the total number\nof eligible records. Following a random start, 75 nth selections\nwere made in each file. In the fourth step of the sampling\nstrategy, primary sampling units (i.e., PSUs) were formed by\nselecting approximately 25 names above and 25 names below\neach case identified in step three. Finally, in the last step,\nsampled persons within each PSU were recruited for an\ninterview with the goal of obtaining 10 cases per PSU.\nInterviewing began in March 2001 and concluded in August\n2001. The data collection was performed by Louis Harris and\nAssociates (now Harris Interactive). A total of 1,500 interviews\nwere completed. Older Black participants were oversampled so\nthat sufficient statistical power would be available to explore\nfully race differences in religion. More specifically, the sample\nconsisted of 748 older White and 752 older Black adults. The\noverall response rate for the study was 62%.\nAfter using listwise deletion of missing values to deal with\nitem nonresponse, the number of cases used in the analyses\ngroup consisting of 1,247 individuals, preliminary analysis\nrevealed that 50% of the subjects were older White and 50%\nwere older Black people. The average age of these people was\nmen, and 50% were married at the time of the interview.\nFinally, these older adults reported they had successfully\nyears). These descriptive data, as well as the findings presented\nherein, are based on weighted data.\nMeasures\nTable 1 contains the survey items that are used in this study.\nTable 2 provides the means and standard deviations by race for\nall study measures. In addition, Table 2 contains the results of\nsimple t-tests that were conducted to see if the means differ\nsignificantly for older White and older African American adults.\nReligious meaning. --A series of questions were developed\nespecially for this study to assess religious meaning. It is\nimportant to discuss briefly how these items were written.\nBefore the nationwide survey was conducted, 3 years were\nspent conducting a series of focus groups, in-depth interviews,\nand cognitive interviews with a separate group of 399 older\nWhite and older Black adults (see Krause, 2002, for a detailed\ndiscussion of this item development strategy). The goal of this\nintensive item development program was to craft a set of\nreligion measures that capture the way older White and older\nBlack people experience religion in daily life. Throughout, the\nintent was to maximize the salience of the items by using the\nrespondents' own words to write the question stems.\nAs shown in Table 1, religious meaning is measured with six\nitems. Following the recommendations of the Fetzer Institute/\nNational Institute on Aging Working Group, these questions\nwere written so that they explicitly capture meaning that arises\nfrom religion, and not a more general sense of meaning that\nmight come from any number of sources (Fetzer Institute/\nIn addition to focusing specifically on religious meaning,\nthese indicators were crafted with a second measurement issue\nin mind. As the members of the Fetzer Institute/National\nInstitute on Aging (1999) Working Group observed, many\nmeasures that assess a general sense of meaning in life are\nconfounded with psychological well-being. Evidence of this\nmay be found in Reker's (1997) definition of a general sense of\nmeaning in life. In his view, meaning involves, ``... having\na purpose in life, having a sense of direction, a sense of order\nand a reason for existence, a clear personal identity ...'' (Reker,\n1997, p. 10). By specifying that a clear personal identity is part\nof a general sense of meaning in life, Reker (1997) may be\nconfounding meaning with self-esteem. Consequently, when\nthe religious meaning items were being developed for the\npresent study, an effort was made to avoid question stems that\ninclude direct references to well-being outcome measures.\nAs shown in Table 1, the indicators of religious meaning that\nare used in this study are coded so that a high score represents\na greater sense of religious meaning in life. An exploratory\nfactor analysis revealed that the six religious meaning\nindicators reflect a single underlying construct. The internal\nTable 1. Study Measures\n1. Religious Meaninga\nA.

These items assess whether study participants expect\nthe best in uncertain times and whether they are optimistic\nabout the future. The third item deals with feeling confident that\nthe rest of one's life will turn out well. This indicator was based\non insights provided by the respondents in the qualitative work\nthat was discussed earlier (Krause, 2002).

Two additional religion measures were\nincluded in the analysis for this purpose. As shown in Table 1,\nthe first assesses the frequency of church attendance, whereas\nthe second measures the frequency of private prayer. These\nindicators are coded so that a high score reflects more frequent\nchurch attendance or more frequent private prayer.\nDemographic control measures. --The relationship between\nreligious meaning and psychological well-being was assessed\nafter the effects of age, sex, education, and marital status were\ncontrolled statistically. Age is scored in a continuous format.\nSimilarly, education is coded in a continuous format reflecting\nthe total number of years of completed schooling. Sex is a binary\nvariable contrasting men (scored 1) with women (scored 0), and\nmarital status is a binary indicator in which a score of 1 is\nassigned to older study participants who were married at the\ntime of the survey, and a score of 0 stands for older people who\nwere not married when the interview took place.\nData Analysis Strategy\nThree hypotheses are evaluated in this study. The first two\nare designed to test the differential involvement perspective.\nThe first hypothesis states that older African American adults\nshould report higher levels of religious meaning than older\nWhite adults. The second specifies that religious meaning\nshould, in turn, be positively associated with life satisfaction,\nself-esteem, and optimism. Tests of these hypotheses will be\nconducted using ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple re-\ngression analysis. The first hypothesis will be evaluated by\nregressing religious meaning on race and the control variables,\nwhereas the second will be assessed by regressing well-being\non religious meaning and the other study measures.\nHypothesis 3 is more complex and is designed to evaluate the\ndifferential impact perspective. This hypothesis states that the\nrelationship between religious meaning and well-being will be\nstronger for older Black than older White people. Stated in more\ntechnical terms, this specification calls for a statistical interaction\neffect between race and religious meaning on well-being.\nHypothesis 3 will also be evaluated with OLS multiple regression\nprocedures. However, in this instance, the regression equations\nwill be estimated in a three-step hierarchical fashion. The additive\neffects of church attendance, private prayer, race, and the control\nmeasures will be entered in the first step. In the second step,\nreligious meaning will be added to the model. This makes it\npossible to evaluate an issue that has not been discussed up to this\npoint. More specifically, a good deal of research indicates that the\nfrequency of church attendance and private prayer are associated\nwith subjective well-being in late life (Koenig et al., 2001).\nHowever, it is not entirely clear why these behavioral measures of\nreligion are related to well-being. The second step in the\nhierarchical regression analysis tests the proposition that older\npeople who go to church often and pray frequently enjoy a greater\nsense of well-being, because these religious activities foster\na sense of meaning in life. Evidence of this would be found if the\nTable 2. Descriptive Data for Study Measures\nVariable\nOlder White\nAdults\nOlder African\nAmerican Adults\nSignificance\nLevel\nNote: ns 5 not significant; SD 5 standard deviation.\nstrength of the relationship between church attendance and well-\nbeing, as well as private prayer and well-being, is diminished\nafter religious meaning is entered into the equation.\nThe third step in the hierarchical analysis tests the proposed\nstatistical interaction effect between race and religious meaning\non well-being. This step is executed by adding a multiplicative\nor cross-product term to the model (religious meaning 3 race).\nThe size of this multiplicative term reflects the difference\nbetween the net effects of religious meaning on well-being for\nolder White people and the net effects of religious meaning\non well-being for older Black people. The procedures described\nby Aiken and West (1991) are used to interpret and evaluate the\ninteractions that emerge between race and religious meaning on\nwell-being. More specifically, these hand calculations yield\nthree estimates: (1) unstandardized regression coefficients\nrepresenting the relationship between religious meaning and\nwell-being for older Black and older White people, respec-\ntively; (2) t-tests that are designed to see if these coefficients\ndiffer significantly from zero; and (3) standardized regression\ncoefficients for the relationship between religious meaning and\nwell-being in each racial group.\nRESULTS\nThe findings are presented here in two sections. First, tests of\nthe differential involvement perspective are conducted. Fol-\nlowing this, the differential impact perspective is evaluated.\nDifferential Involvement\nTable 3 contains the findings from the regressions analysis\nthat were designed to see if levels of religious meaning are\nhigher in older Black than older White adults. These analyses\nwere performed in two steps. The demographic variables and\nthe binary race indicator were entered into the equation in Step\n1 (see Model 1 in Table 3). Then, the frequency of church\nattendance and private prayer were added to these independent\nvariables in Step 2 (see Model 2). The findings from Model 1 re-\nveal that, compared with older Black adults, older White adults\nare less likely to find a sense of meaning in religion (Beta 5\nmeaning continues to be statistically significant after church\nattendance and private prayer are entered into the equation, but\nthe size of the standardized regression coefficient is reduced by\nfindings from both models reveal that older Black people are\nmore likely than older White people to find meaning in religion,\nand this race difference is largely because older Black adults pray\nmore often and attend church more frequently than older White\nadults. Viewed more broadly, the data support an important facet\nof the differential involvement perspective: Older Black people\nare more likely than older White people to derive a sense of\nmeaning from their faith. However, for the differential in-\nvolvement perspective to be fully evaluated, it is important to\nshow that religious meaning is, in turn, associated with well-\nbeing. This issue is addressed in the next section in the process of\nevaluating the differential impact perspective.\nDifferential Impact\nLife satisfaction. --Table 4 contains the results of the\nanalyses that were designed to explore the relationships among\nrace, religion, and life satisfaction. The data in the left-hand\ncolumn of this table (Model 1) reveal that older adults who\na greater sense of life satisfaction than older adults who do not\ngo to church or pray often. However, two important findings\nemerge from the data when religious meaning is entered into\nthe equation (see Model 2). First, church attendance (Beta 5\na statistically significant influence on feelings of life satisfac-\ntion. This suggests that the frequently observed relationship\nbetween these behavioral measures of religion and life sat-\nisfaction may be explained by the new measure of religious\nmeaning that was developed for this study. The second major\nfinding to emerge from Model 2 has to do with the additive\neffects of religious meaning on well-being. More specifically,\nthe data suggest that, for the sample taken as a whole, greater\nreligious meaning is associated with greater life satisfaction\nsented in the previous section, these data provide support for\nthe differential involvement perspective. More specifically,\nthese findings suggest that, compared with older White adults,\nreligious meaning appears to play a larger role in shaping life\nsatisfaction among older Black persons.\nThe data on the right-hand side of Table 3 (Model 2) reveal\nfurther that the differential impact perspective may provide\nvaluable insight, as well. More specifically, the findings suggest\nthere is a statistically significant interaction effect between race\nand religious meaning on life satisfaction (b 5 2.145; p ,\n.001; unstandardized regression coefficients are discussed\nbecause standardized estimates are meaningless in this context).\nBased on the procedures provided by Aiken and West (1991),\nfurther hand calculations reveal that the size of the relationship\nbetween religious meaning and psychological well-being for\na half times larger than the corresponding estimate for older\nthese data indicate that, although religious meaning appears to\nTable 3.

The data in the left-hand\ncolumn of this table (Model 1) reveal that older adults who go\nto church often tend to have greater feelings of self-worth than\nolder people who do not go to church as frequently (Beta 5\nprayer is not significantly related to self-esteem (Beta 5 .050;\nns). Nevertheless, as the data provided by Model 2 reveal, the\nrelationship between church attendance, private prayer, and\nself-esteem changes once religious meaning is added to the\nequation. More specifically, the size of the relationship between\nchurch attendance and self-esteem is reduced by about 45%\n(Beta 5 .078; p , .05), but the relationship between private\nprayer and self-esteem changes in a way that initially is\nsomewhat surprising. In particular, the data indicate that older\npeople who pray more often tend to have lower feelings of self-\nsuggest that, as anticipated, older people who find a strong\nsense of meaning in their faith tend to have greater feelings of\nself-worth than older adults who do not derive a sense of\nTwo important findings emerge from the data provided by\nModel 3. First, the unanticipated relationship between private\nprayer and self-esteem disappears (Beta 5 2.049; ns) once tests\nare performed for the interaction between race and religious\nmeaning on self-esteem. This means that the unexpected finding\nthat emerged in Model 2 is because this model was misspecified\n(i.e., the relationship between race and religious meaning was\nnot assessed properly). The second, and more important, result\nto emerge from Model 3 suggests that the relationship between\nreligious meaning and self-esteem appears to be stronger for\nThe nature of these race differences may be illustrated more\nclearly with the procedures provided by Aiken and West (1991).\nThese additional analyses indicate that the relationship between\nreligious meaning and self-esteem among older Black adults\nTaken as a whole, the results presented in this section suggest\nthat both the differential involvement and the differential impact\nperspectives help explain why religious meaning plays a larger\nrole in shaping feelings of self-worth among older Blacks than\nolder White adults.\nOptimism. --The data in Table 6 reveal that older people who\ngo to church frequently tend to be more optimistic than older\nadults who do not attend church as often (Beta 5 .181; p ,\n.001; see Model 1). But, in contrast, private prayer does not\nappear to be significantly associated with a sense of optimism\n(Beta 5 .048; ns). However, as with the other well-being\noutcome measures, the relationship between church attendance,\nprivate prayer, and optimism changes once religious meaning is\nadded to the equation (see Model 2). More specifically, after the\neffects of religious meaning are taken into account, the size of\nthe relationship between church attendance and optimism is\nreduced by approximately 44%. This suggests that religious\nmeaning explains part of the reason why church attendance is\nassociated with optimism in late life. However, the data in\nTable 6 further reveal that once religious meaning is added to\nthe equation, private prayer appears to have a negative effect on\nTable 5. Relationships Among Race, Religious Meaning,\nVariable Model 1 Model 2 Model 3\n(Race 3 Religious Meaning) -- -- --\naStandardized regression coefficient.\nbMetric (unstandardized) regression coefficient.\nTable 4.

First, correctly\nspecifying the relationship between race and religious meaning\ntends to reduce, but not completely eliminate, the negative\nrelationship between private prayer and optimism (Beta 5\nunanticipated findings, it should be kept in mind that the size of\nthis relationship is not large (2.084). Perhaps these results\nreflect the possibility that older people with a low sense of\noptimism pray more often in an effort to feel more positive\nabout the future. This issue should be explored in future\nstudies. The second major finding to emerge from Model 3 has\nto do with the proposed interaction effect between race and\nreligious meaning on optimism. As the data in the right-hand\nside of Table 6 suggest (Model 3), the relationship between\nreligious meaning and optimism is significantly larger for older\nspecifically, the additional hand calculations reveal that the\nassociation between religious meaning and optimism is about\nDISCUSSION\nRecently, some investigators have argued that the literature\non race, religion, and psychological well-being is ``limited,''\nand that a number of facets of religion have yet to be explored\npresent study was to address this gap in the knowledge base by\nfocusing on the potentially important influence of one facet of\nreligion that has been overlooked in many studies--religious\nmeaning. It was hypothesized that religious meaning is\nassociated with a greater sense of subjective well-being in late\nlife. In addition, it was further hypothesized that the beneficial\neffects of religious meaning would be especially evident among\nolder Black people. As Frankl (1963) argued, ``... suffering\nceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning''\n(p. 135). Older African American adults have clearly experi-\nenced a good deal of suffering arising from decades of exposure\nto racial prejudice and discrimination (Kessler, Mickelson, &\nWilliams, 1999). As a result, a major function of the church in\nthe Black community has been to help African American people\nfind meaning in the face of racial oppression (Cone, 1997).\nViewed broadly, the data appear to support the hypotheses\nthat were developed for this study. More specifically, the\nfindings suggest that greater religious meaning is associated\nwith more life satisfaction, higher self-esteem, and more\noptimism for both older White and older Black adults.\nHowever, the data further reveal that religious meaning may\nplay a significantly larger role in shaping feelings of well-being\namong older Black adults. Two theoretical perspectives were\nevaluated to better understand the race differences that emerged\nfrom the data. The differential involvement perspective\nsuggests that older Black persons are more likely than older\nWhite persons to find meaning in religion, and that people who\nfind meaning in religion, in turn, enjoy a greater sense of well-\nbeing. In contrast, the differential impact perspective proposes\nthat the relationship between religious meaning and well-being\nwill be stronger for older Black adults than for older White\nadults, and the difference may be because of an underlying\nqualitative difference in the nature of religious meaning in the\nBlack community. The data provide strong support for both\nperspectives. More specifically, the findings indicate that older\nBlack people enjoy a greater sense of well-being because they\nderive a greater sense of meaning from religion than older\nWhite people, and because the impact of religious meaning on\nwell-being is stronger for older Black than older White adults.\nThe findings from this study are noteworthy for several\nreasons. First, the analyses are based on data provided by\na nationwide sample of older White and older Black adults.\nSecond, carefully crafted measures were used that focus\nspecifically on meaning that arises from religion. This appears\nto be the first time that anyone has explicitly evaluated the\nrelationship between religious meaning and well-being in late\nlife. Third, because a range of outcome measures were used, it\nwas possible to show that the positive influence of religious\nmeaning is fairly broad-based, instead of being manifest in one\nspecific outcome (e.g., life satisfaction only). Fourth, this\nappears to be the first time the differential involvement and\ndifferential impact perspectives have been evaluated empiri-\ncally within the context of religious meaning.\nAlthough the findings from this study may make a contribu-\ntion to the literature, a great deal of work remains to be done. To\nbegin with, it is important to know more about why religious\nmeaning may bolster feelings of well-being in late life.\nAlthough a number of factors are likely to be involved, stressful\nlife events may play an important role in this process. More\nspecifically, religious meaning may exert a positive influence on\nwell-being, because it helps older people cope more effectively\nwith the pernicious effects of stress (Musick, 2000).\nTable 6. Relationships Among Race, Religious Meaning,\nVariable Model 1 Model 2 Model 3\n(Race 3 Religious Meaning) -- -- --\naStandardized regression coefficient.\nbMetric (unstandardized) regression coefficient.\nKRAUSE\nIn addition, it is important to learn more about why religious\nmeaning enhances the subjective well-being of older Black than\nolder White people. The items used to assess meaning in this\nstudy ask whether religion provides a sense of purpose and\nunderstanding of life, but these indicators do not explicitly\ncapture the unique social circumstances that older Black adults\nmust grapple with to derive a sense of meaning in life. This was\nnecessary so that older White and older Black persons could be\ncompared and contrasted. But now it is time to take the next\nstep and explore more focused facets of religious meaning.\nPerhaps, as Paris (1995) and others have argued, religion helps\nolder African American adults better understand the suffering\nassociated with slavery, racial prejudice, and discrimination. To\nthe extent this is true, a stronger relationship may emerge if\nresearchers use measures of religious meaning that focus\nspecifically on these racial problems.\nIt would also be useful to know more about how a sense of\nreligious meaning arises in the first place. Earlier, evidence was\nprovided that older people who go to church more often and\nwho pray more often tend to find a greater sense of meaning in\nreligion. But there is likely to be more to it than this. For\nexample, a number of researchers have argued that religion has\na strong social foundation, and this communal or interpersonal\nemphasis is more evident in the Black community (Mattis &\nsupport (i.e., mutual encouragement to adopt and practice\nvarious tenets of religion) found in church settings may be an\nimportant source of religious meaning, especially for older\nAfrican American people.\nFinally, as noted previously, a number of studies indicate that\na general sense of meaning in life is associated with enhanced\nfeelings of well-being (Reker, 1997). However, the findings\npresented herein suggest that meaning arising specifically from\nreligion is also related to well-being. Consequently, research is\nneeded to compare and contrast directly the two measures of\nmeaning to see which is more strongly associated with well-\nbeing. This type of analysis should help resolve a long-standing\ndebate in the literature about whether meaning arising\nspecifically from religion is more important than a generalized\nsense of meaning that arises from a number of different sources\nIn the process of exploring this as well as other issues related\nto religious meaning, researchers would benefit from paying\nattention to the limitations in the present study. One is especially\nimportant. The analyses were based on data that were gathered\nat one point in time only. As a result, the temporal ordering of\nthe relationship between religious meaning and well-being was\nbased on theoretical considerations alone. The inherent problem\nin using cross-sectional data may be illustrated by turning to the\nliterature on a general sense of meaning in life and self-esteem.\nResearchers have specified the nature of the causal relationship\nbetween these constructs in nearly every possible way. For\nexample, some investigators argue that meaning is a source of\nself-esteem (Reker, 1997), others assert that self-esteem is\nactually a dimension or component of meaning (Park &\nFolkman, 1997), whereas other researchers maintain that high\nself-esteem promotes a sense of meaning in life (Hoyle, Kernis,\nLeary, & Baldwin, 1999). This issue can only be addressed with\na strong theoretical rationale and data that have been gathered at\nthree or more points in time.\nWriting in 1931, Jung noted that, ``The least of things with\na meaning is always worth more than the greatest of things\nsuggested that nothing in life has value, unless it is meaningful.\nAlthough there are a number of ways to find meaning in life\n(Fowler, 1981), religion may play a particularly important role\nin this respect. This is especially true given the nature of the\nchallenges that must be faced in late life, including death. Yet\nresearchers know so little about religious meaning. Relatively\nlittle evidenced-based research exists to show how it arises, and\nlittle is known about how it helps those who face significant\nadversity, such as older African American people. Viewed\nbroadly, the purpose of this study has been to bring religious\nmeaning to the foreground by showing that it may play\na significant role in shaping constructs of long-standing interest\nin social gerontology (i.e., life satisfaction, self-esteem, and\noptimism). Perhaps no facet of religion is as elusive as\nmeaning. Yet, no other dimension of religion may have the\npotential to capture the core issues involved in negotiating the\nfinal decades of life.\n"
