Fletcher1*, Nathan Tefft2\n1 Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America, 2 Department of Health Services,\nSchool of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America\n Introduction\nThere is a substantial body of evidence supporting an inverse\nassociation between resource scarcity and body size preference\nbased on the hypothesis that a larger body size may indicate\ngreater access to food or other resources [1]. This hypothesis has\nbeen generalized to motivate studies relating several forms of stress\nto body size preferences, much of which has been focused on\nstudying men's preferences for women's body size and type. For\nexample, hunger [2], psychological stress [1], socioeconomic status\n[3], and financial insecurity [4,5] have been suggested as potential\nmanifestations of resource insecurity affecting men's preferences,\ngenerally revealing a pattern that men under greater stress prefer\nheavier women.\nThe relationship between resource scarcity or stress and\nwomen's preferences for men's body types is less clear, with some\nevidence suggesting that hungry women exhibit a slightly higher\npreference for heavier, taller, and older men [2]. The paucity of\nconclusive evidence for women may be partly explained by women\nreporting personality characteristics as relatively more important\nthan body type than do men [6]. In addition, women could\nexpress partner preferences for body type along dimensions that\nmay be less immediately affected by resource scarcity such as\nheight [7] or waist-chest ratio [8]. Under the ``dual mating\nhypothesis'', which proposes that women's sexual preferences\nchange across the menstrual cycle [9], a greater variability in\nwomen's preferences could lead to greater variability in pairing\nacross physical characteristics. Furthermore, there is evidence that\nwomen's stated preferences about body type are less correlated\nwith their partner's actual characteristics than are men's stated\npreferences [10]. This may suggest that body mass index,\nspecifically, is less important in partner decisions for women than\nit is for men.\nThe long-term effects of stress on preferences for partner\ncharacteristics remain largely unknown. Child abuse is known to\nbe associated with a variety of long-term health-related behaviors\nand outcomes including depression, substance abuse, and suicide\n[11\u00ad13], any of which may affect partner choice. Evidence based\non ``betrayal trauma theory'' suggests that child abuse can have a\ndirect effect on partner choice when trauma leads to dissociation\nand a lack of betrayal awareness by leading a victim of abuse to\nignore signals about potential partner betrayal. Consistent with\nthis possibility, participants in a study who experienced high\ntrauma rated partner loyalty as less important than participants\nwho experienced medium or low trauma [14].\nThe ``cycle of violence'' hypothesis also predicts that violence\nthrough child abuse or other trauma will increase the likelihood of\nviolent acts later in life, and stress has been found to increase\naggression more acutely for persons with a history of child\nmaltreatment in an experimental setting [15]. A primary\nassumption underlying the theory of marriage and intra-household\nbargaining [16] is that partners select and maintain a relationship\nonly if the relationship is valued more by each partner than is the\nvalue of being single. An implication of this assumption is that\nrelationships which involve negative impacts on a partner's well-\nbeing, such as violence toward that partner, may involve a lower\n``threat point'' to leave the relationship. Partners who have what\nare considered more desirable characteristics, e.g. thinness in\nwomen [10], may be therefore less likely to join or more likely to\nend a relationship involving violence. In a large cross-sectional\nsurvey, women with any lifetime experiences of intimate partner\nviolence (IPV) reported a significantly higher prevalence of\nelevated body mass index (BMI) than women who had not\nexperienced IPV, but there was no significant difference for men\nacross IPV status [17].\nStudies that have tested the relationship between stress and sex-\nrelated or partner preferences for body weight typically only\nmeasure surveyed preferences and induce stress in an experimental\nsetting. To our knowledge, no study examines the relationship\nbetween reported long term stress and the body type profiles of\nmen and women who self-report as partners. By utilizing a unique,\nnationally representative data set of partner dyads we are able to\nstudy the relationship between early life stressors, such as abuse,\nexperienced by each partner pair and their effects on partner body\nweight characteristics in real world relationships.\nMethods\nEthical Statement\nThe human subjects committee at Yale University approved this\nstudy. Participants provided written informed consent to partic-\nipate in the Add Health.\nParticipants\nParticipants include nearly 1,500 pairs of individuals in the\n``Couples Sample'' collected in the third wave (2000/1) of the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Heath).\nOf these individuals, approximately 500 pairs were married, 500\npairs were cohabitating, and 500 pairs were dating. The Add\nHealth is a nationally representative study of 7th to 12th graders\nApproximately 750 individuals from the main study were sub-\nsampled and a ``romantic partner'' was recruited for the Couples\nSample. Each individual in the pairs were administered a similar\nsurvey. Participants ranged in age between 18\u00ad43 (the main Add\nHealth respondents ranged in age between 18\u00ad26, while their\npartners' ages were unrestricted). Each individual's body mass\nindex was measured; the male average was 27.05 and the female\nTable 1.

All information is known from\neach individual in each pair, allowing a dyadic analysis of current\npartners. Key measures for the analysis include each partner's\nweight, history of childhood mistreatment, and gender.\nChildhood mistreatment measures. Respondents were\nasked a series of retrospective questions about their parents and\nother adults' mistreatment before the respondent was in 6th grade.\nThese include: how often they were (i) left alone when an adult\nshould have been with them (ii) not taken care of in their basic\nneeds, such as keeping clean and providing food and clothing (iii)\nslapped, hit, or kicked (iv) touched in a sexual way (v) had social\nservices investigated the family or tried to take them out of their\nliving situation. Categorical answers for (i-iv) included: (A) one\ntime (B) two times (C) three to five times (D) six to ten times (E)\nmore than ten times (F) this never happened. Question (v) allowed\nany number to be reported (range 0 to 60). A small proportion of\nindividuals refused to answer these questions or responded they\n``don't know''. We combine these responses in the main analysis\nby using a factor analysis on items (i-iv) [13] and using item (v) as a\nsummary measure of abuse that was severe enough to be reported\nto social services, which occurred in approximately 6 percent of\nthe sample. In auxiliary analysis we also create ``ever measures'' of\ni-iv, where approximately 40% were ``left alone'', 10\u00ad15% had\n``unmet basic needs'', 30% were physically abused, and approx-\nimately 5% were sexually abused (see Table S1A).\nWeight measures. Respondents weights and heights were\nmeasured by interviewers. Body mass index is created by using the\nratio of weight (kilograms) and height (meters- squared). Over-\nweight status is defined as a BMI greater or equal to 25 and obese\nstatus is defined as a BMI greater or equal to 30.\nStatistical Analysis\nRecent experimental evidence has suggested that, for males,\ninduced stress increases preferences for larger body size [1]. The\ncurrent analysis extends this evidence by using OLS regression\nanalysis to estimate associations between partner weight and own\nchildhood mistreatment. This is accomplished with the following\nempirical specification:\nweightj\nmistreatmenti\nweighti\nwhere the vector X is a set of dyadic controls (e.g. age, education,\nmaternal education, race/ethnicity) and weighti controls the\nprocesses that generate homophily in partner characteristics\namong couples. As described above, we use three alternative\nmeasures of ``mistreatment'' when estimating equation (1)\u00ad(A) a\nprincipal component summary of our child mistreatment measures\n(B) the social services indicator and (C) each of the principal\ncomponent measures as separate predictors. Equation (1) is\nestimated separately for men and women (with respect to\nindividual i). All analysis was completed using Stata Version 11.0.\nResults\nTable S1 provides sample descriptive statistics and detailed\ninformation on the variables described above and studied in the\nanalyses. Table 1 presents results from equation (1) where the\noutcome is female weight and the key independent variable is male\nchildhood mistreatment. Each column reports a separate regres-\nsion and unstandardized beta coefficients are presented for each\nindependent variable. Column 1 shows that males with higher\nmeasures of childhood mistreatment are 3.2 percentage points\nmore likely to have a female partner who is obese. Column 2\nshows that males who were investigated by social services during\nTable 2. The Effects of Childhood Abuse in Males on Adult\nPartner Weight Status: Abuse Categories.\nOutcome\nFemale\nBMI\nFemale\nOverweight\nFemale\nObese\nStandard errors in parentheses.\nAdditional Controls: Constant.\nChild Stress and Partner Weight Characteristics\nchildhood are 9 percentage points more likely to have an obese\nfemale partner. Columns 3\u00ad6 show that these results are\nqualitatively similar for outcomes of female BMI and female\noverweight, though these results are not statistically significant.\nTable 2 examines more specific measures of childhood\nmistreatment by including four separate measures of whether the\nindividual was ever ``left alone'', had ``unmet basic needs'', was\never physically abused, and was ever sexually abused. Column 1\nsuggests that childhood experiences with unmet needs and physical\nabuse are positively related to female partner BMI during\nadulthood. Columns 2 and 3 suggests an increase in the likelihood\nof having an overweight female partner for those with unmet basic\nneeds and an increase in the likelihood of having an obese female\npartner for those experiencing childhood physical abuse. No\nsignificant relationships are found for being left alone or sexually\nabused.\nWhile the prior literature typically focuses on the effects of stress\non men in determining partner weight, we next examine the\nconverse\u00adwhat is the effect of long-term stress (as measured by\nchildhood mistreatment) on women in determining (male) partner\nweight? Table 3 repeats Table 1 specifications but transposes the\ngender of the partner\u00adnow we ask the relationship between\nwomen's exposure to childhood mistreatment and the weight\nattributes of their adult male partners. Unlike the results for the\neffects of stressful male childhoods, the results suggest that females\nwho experience stressful childhoods are less likely to have partners\nwho are overweight or obese. For example, in Column 2 in\nTable 3, we find that females who were investigated by social\nservices during childhood are nearly 12 percentage points less\nlikely to have an obese romantic partner as an adult than women\nwho report no such investigation. Likewise, Columns 3 and 4 show\nstrong negative correlations between the mistreatment factor and\nmale partner BMI as well as between the social services indicator\nand male partner BMI (1.5 units lower vs women not investigated\nby social services). Columns 5 and 6 again shows that women who\nexperienced childhood mistreatment are between 5\u00ad10 percentage\npoints less likely to have a romantic partner who is overweight\nthan women who did not have this experience. Unlike our results\nin Table 2, Table 4 shows little consistent evidence for the ``type''\nof stressor that is related to partner weight. Only one of the specific\nchildhood mistreatment variables are statistically related to male\npartner weight.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we examined the long-term effects of childhood\nstress, as measured by mistreatment, on preferences for body type.\nWe used a nationally representative sample of adults first\nTable 3.

We\ncompared partner weight characteristics for both men and\nwomen, including BMI, obese, and overweight status, among\nrespondents according to their experience of childhood mistreat-\nment after controlling for several potential confounders including\nown weight status, age, education, race, ethnicity, and marital\nstatus. Broadly speaking, the results suggest that men who\nexperienced child abuse tend to prefer a heavier female body size\nin their partners while women who experienced child abuse may\nprefer lighter male body size.\nMore specifically, men who experienced a high mistreatment\nfactor according to a factor analysis of questions describing several\naspects of parental and other adult abuse experiences had female\npartners with significantly greater BMI and were significantly\nmore likely to be in a relationship with an obese female partner.\nMen whose abuse was severe enough to be reported to social\nservices similarly had partners with greater BMI and who were\nmore likely to be obese, although only the latter effect was\nstatistically significant. When simultaneously comparing potential\nchild abuse experiences in a regression analysis, men whose basic\nneeds were not taken care of and men who were physically abused\nas children were those likely to have heavier partners.\nUnlike many previous studies, we also considered how child\nmistreatment among women affects their preferences for male\nbody type according to the weight and abuse measures described\nabove. Perhaps unexpectedly, women with a higher mistreatment\nfactor had male partners with lower average BMI and probability\nof being overweight, and women whose mistreatment was\nreported to social services exhibited preferences for lighter males,\naccording to every measure. When considering all of the\nunderlying types of child mistreatment simultaneously the results\nwere largely insignificant but the point estimates for the partner\nweight preference effect was consistently negative, in almost every\ncase.\nOverall these results in part confirm previous work on body type\npreference but also suggest opportunities for future research. In\nparticular, male preferences for romantic partners appear\nconsistent with the ``environmental security hypothesis'' [1,2] in\nthe long term, as measured by the effects of childhood stress on\nadult partner preference. Further supporting this confirmatory\nevidence is the finding that the strongest association between\nchildhood mistreatment and female body size arose for men who\nidentified their needs as not having been met as children. In this\nsense, prolonged experiences of unmet need may have similar long\nrun effects as immediate sensations indicating scarcity. That men\nwho experienced physical abuse as children similarly exhibited a\npreference for heavier body types also lends support to the\nhypothesis that the ``cycle of violence'' effect [15] may lead those\nmen to enter into relationships in which partner violence is more\naccepted.\nPerhaps the most unexpected results were for the effects of\nchildhood mistreatment on partner body size preferences among\nwomen. As described earlier, women tended to have partners with\nlower BMI and who were less likely to be overweight or obese if\nthey experienced child abuse. Interestingly, this relationship does\nnot appear to be concentrated among any subset of mistreatment\ntypes but is similar for women who were left alone, whose needs\nwere unmet, and who were physically or sexually abused. A\npotential explanation for this association may lie in the fact that\nBMI and, by implication overweight and obesity status, do not\nadequately distinguish between muscle mass and body fat when\nmeasuring the underlying weight component [18]. Since the\nsample used in the current analysis does not include other\nmeasures of body type we are not able to separately distinguish\nalternative potential explanations for female preferences for body\ntype, such as waist-chest ratio [8]. A more complete classification\nof body types may yield important evidence in future research in\nthis area.\nTable 4. The Effects of Childhood Abuse in Females on Adult\nPartner Weight Status: Abuse Categories.\nOutcome\nMale\nBMI\nMale\nOverweight Male Obese\nStandard errors in parentheses.\nAdditional Controls: Constant.\nChild Stress and Partner Weight Characteristics\nAn important strength of this study is that it is based on a\nnationally representative sample, so the findings herein may be\nbroadly generalized. In addition, this analysis offers to our\nknowledge the first ``real world'' study of actual partner pairings\nin a generalizable sample. Previous research in this area has\ntypically examined stated preferences for hypothetical ideal types,\noften in experimental settings. As such the findings from this study\nmay be particularly relevant for considering how child abuse and\nrelated circumstances including poverty and resource deprivation\namong men and women may affect the desirability of body types,\nboth self-perceived and perceived among others.\nThe primary limitations of this study result from common\ntradeoffs encountered when conducting observational studies,\nmore generally. At the expense of producing novel findings with\nrespect to ``real world'' partner choices, the current study may not\nadequately control for all relevant characteristics of the partner\ndyads. For example, it has been hypothesized that stress may affect\n``self-esteem, empathy, or related constructs'' [1] and it is\nindirectly through these channels, rather than directly, that stress\ninfluences partner weight preferences. Although we confirmed that\nour results are generally robust to the inclusion of other known\noutcomes of childhood mistreatment including depression and\nsubstance abuse (see Tables S2 and S3), more research is needed.\nThis general concern may be more relevant for women than men\nsince the results for the latter are broadly consistent with previous\nhypotheses and experiments, but it is not possible to know with\ncertainty. Additionally, our measure of childhood mistreatment is\nretrospective and could possibly be affected by reporting bias. We\nbelieve that any reporting bias would be unrelated to weight\npreferences and would have difficulty explaining the gender\ndifferences in weight preferences we report. However, future\nresearch able to access mistreatment (or other stressors) prospec-\ntively would be a useful next step. Future research leveraging\nnatural experiments or quasi-experimental designs may also more\naccurately estimate causal relationships in ``real world'' settings.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Sample Descriptive Statistics.\nTable S2 The Effects of Childhood Abuse in Males on\nAdult Partner Weight Status: With Behavioral Controls.\nTable S3 The Effects of Childhood Abuse in Females on\nAdult Partner Weight Status: With Behavioral Controls.\n"
