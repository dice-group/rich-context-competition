It\nis the leading reason for physician office visits, accounting for\napproximately 42 million ambulatory encounters each year, and is\namong the leading indications for the use of prescription drugs [3].\nWhile in general, women of reproductive age have relatively low\nrates of hypertension, it presents important clinical implications\nand challenges [4] in this population, not only because of its role as\na risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but also because of the\nissues associated with this condition and its treatment in\npregnancy.\nIt is well established that young women with hypertension have\nincreased risk for cardiovascular disease in both the short and the\nlong term [5]. Rates of cardiovascular disease in young women in\nthe U.S. appear to be increasing [6]. Analysis of U.S. vital statistics\ndata showed that the coronary heart disease mortality rate for\nincreased,[6] suggesting the need for further study of risk factors in\nthis group.\nEqually important, hypertension, estimated to complicate up to\n5% of the estimated 4 million pregnancies in the United States\neach year,[7] is a major source of maternal and fetal morbidity\nwill develop superimposed preeclampsia [9,10,11]. The risk of\nplacental abruption is also substantially elevated, approaching 2%\nin some series [9,10]. Life-threatening maternal outcomes,\nin women with chronic hypertension. Adverse fetal outcomes\nassociated with chronic hypertension include preterm birth and\nintrauterine growth restriction [10,11] and the perinatal mortality\nrate in offspring of mothers with chronic hypertension is elevated\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of hypertension in young\nwomen may help clinicians identify important modifiable risk\nfactors and public health officials target interventions, which in\nturn may improve pregnancy outcomes and prevent cardiovascu-\nlar disease. There are no recent nationwide data focusing on the\nepidemiology of hypertension in this important group. The\npurpose of this study is (1) to examine prevalence of hypertension\nin women of reproductive age, (2) to identify factors independently\nassociated with hypertension in this group, and (3) to analyze the\nmedications used to treat hypertension in this population utilizing\ndata from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nMethods\nNHANES is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey\ndesigned to assess the health and nutritional status of the U.S.\ncivilian, non-institutionalized population. NHANES became a\ncontinuous survey in 1999; data are released in 2-year cycles. All\nNHANES surveys include a personal interview in the household\nand a detailed physical examination in a mobile examination\ncenter (MEC). Additional data on the survey design, question-\nnaires, and laboratory methods are available elsewhere. (Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health\nStatistics. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nAvailable at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm. Accessed\nTo reliably estimate prevalence of hypertension and anti-\nhypertensive medication use among women of reproductive age,\ndata were analyzed from 5 survey periods collected from 1999 to\n2008. The overall examination survey response rates ranged from\nparticipated in the household and MEC examination. Among\nthose, 5,521 participants had complete data to determine\nhypertension status and medication usage.\nHypertension was defined using blood pressure measurements\nand/or self-reported anti-hypertensive use. Blood pressure was\nmeasured by a physician using an appropriately sized cuff.\nVolunteers rested at least 5 minutes before the blood pressure\nreadings were obtained. The average of up to 3 blood pressure\nmeasurements, obtained during the MEC examination, was used\nto assess blood pressure. Participants with an average systolic\nblood pressure $140 mmHg and/or an average diastolic blood\npressure $90 mmHg or those who self-reported currently taking\nprescribed medication for high blood pressure were defined as\nPrescription medication for respondents was obtained from the\nprescription medication section of the household interview.\nParticipants were asked whether they had taken any prescription\nmedications in the previous 30 days. Interviewers recorded\nprescriptions using their medication bottles. Medications recorded\nby NHANES are coded and classified using the Lexicon PlusH\ndatabase. (Cerner, Multum, Inc. Available at: http://www.\nmultum.com/Lexicon.htm. Accessed: May 9, 2011.) Anti-hyper-\ntensives were defined as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)\ninhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs), antiadre-\nnergic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and\ndiuretics. Combination drugs were re-categorized into the single\nmedication classes for each of the constituents of the combination\n(i.e., each constituent was counted towards the total number\nexposed for the class of the components). For those taking more\nthan one medication, each medication was separately counted\ntowards the total for each class. Prescription medication was only\nexamined among those who self-reported taking anti-hyperten-\nsives.\nFor each participant, potential risk factors for hypertension were\nabstracted from the dataset.

There was a near\nlinear increase in the prevalence of hypertension with rising BMI\nfrom 25. As shown in Figure 2, more than a quarter of all Black,\nnon-Hispanic women had stage II or greater obesity. Blacks had\nhigher prevalence of hypertension at every BMI compared with\nwhites; blacks with a BMI greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2 had a\nreproductive age used anti-hypertensive pharmacologic therapy.\nTable 3 shows the distribution of the anti-hypertensive used by\npatients reporting treatment for hypertension.

Including labetolol.\nChronic Hypertension in Women of Reproductive Age\ncians will be increasingly confronted with the issues of hyperten-\nsion.\nNon-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity and advancing age were\nnon-modifiable patient characteristics associated with increased\nrisk for hypertension. Multiple studies in the general population\nhave demonstrated that hypertension in blacks is more prevalent,\nearlier in onset, and more severe [21,22]. Hypertension, in part,\ncontributes to the large disparities between white and blacks in the\nUS in rates of cardiovascular disease [23] and adverse pregnancy\noutcomes [24]. Developing preventive measures for hypertension\naimed at this group may be one mechanism to help decrease these\ndisparities. It should be noted that nearly one-half of young black\nwomen were obese in this sample; preventative measures might\nconsider targeting obesity in this population.\nThe increased prevalence of hypertension with advanced age,\nlikewise, may explain some of the increased risk for some\npregnancy complications in women of advanced maternal age.\nThe problem of chronic hypertension in pregnancy is likely to\nbecome more common as the numbers of mothers of advanced\nApproximately 5% of women of reproductive age took\nantihypertensive medications. Most common among these were\ndiuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta blockers. Recent data\nregarding the risks of congenital malformations associated with\nantihypertensive exposure during the first trimester have been\nmixed, with some studies reporting increased risk while others\nsuggest that any observed risk is attributable to the underlying\nhypertension (``confounding by indication'')\ncurrently categorizes most antihypertensives as category C\u00ad\nmeaning that animal studies either show an adverse effect or are\nlacking and no well-controlled human studies exist, and that\nmedication should only be given when the benefit justifies the\npotential risk to the fetus [33]. As about half of all pregnancies in\nthe United States are unintended [34], medications prescribed to\nwomen of reproductive age are likely to be frequently taken during\nthe first trimester. Given the high prevalence of antihypertensive\nmedication utilization in women of reproductive age, further\nresearch into the safety of these medications in pregnancy is\nmerited to inform the selection of the safest antihypertensive for\nthis population.\nWe found a relatively stable rate of hypertension across the\nstudy period. Data suggest that the rate of obesity in the U.S. has\nbegun to plateau [19]. As shown in our study, obesity is an\nextremely important risk factor for hypertension in this population,\nand the lack of rise in obesity rates may explain the lack of rise in\nthe prevalence of hypertension.\nResults reported in this study should be interpreted with the\nfollowing limitations in mind. First, there are several patient\ncharacteristics that are known to be associated with hypertension\nfrom previous studies, including heavy alcohol use [35], OCPs use\nin our analysis of the NHANES sample. It may be that the effect of\nalcohol and smoking in contributing to hypertension occurs only\nafter many years of exposure and thus the association is less robust\nin young women, such as those considered in our study or that\nsome women with hypertension avoid tobacco and alcohol. In this\nstudy, OCP use in the univariate analysis was protective; however,\nOCP use was inversely correlated with advancing age, and after\nadjustment for this and other patient characteristics, OCP use was\nnot significantly associated with hypertension. It is also likely that\nclinicians are reluctant to prescribe OCP to hypertensive women\nor discontinue OCPs if women develop hypertension, which would\nlead to a lack of association or even an inverse association. An\nadditional limitation is that the lower age limit considered is 20 (as\ncertain variables of interest are not reported in the NHANES for\nyounger women). Likewise, in keeping with most epidemiologic\nstudies of women of reproductive age, we defined the upper age\nlimit for our population at 44\u00adbut women older than this can\nbecome pregnant through assisted reproduction, and hypertension\nis likely even more prevalent in this group. We were not able to\nanalyze the effect of physical activity on the risk of hypertension, as\nthe questions used to ascertain activity changed during the study\nperiod. Finally, NHANES is a cross-sectional study and it is\nappropriate for describing prevalence of conditions and associa-\ntions, but not temporal relationships. As with any observational\nstudy, it has a limited role in establishing causality.\nIn conclusion, hypertension occurs in about 8% of women of\nreproductive age. Obesity is a risk factor of particular importance\nin this population because it affects over 30% of young women in\nthe U.S., is associated with more than a 4 fold increased risk of\nhypertension, and is potentially modifiable. There are also\nremarkable differences in the prevalence of hypertension between\nracial/ethnic groups. Women of reproductive age are commonly\nexposed to antihypertensive medications and data regarding the\nfetal risks associated with first trimester exposure are conflicting; as\na large proportion of pregnancies are unplanned, further work is\nneeded to define the safest antihypertensive medications for these\npatients.\n"
