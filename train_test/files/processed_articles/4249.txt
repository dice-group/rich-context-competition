The use of intravascular catheters\nis, however, associated with the risk of bloodstream infec-\ntions (BSI); a leading cause of healthcare-associated infec-\ntions (HCAI).

The former term is often used in rela-\ntion to epidemiological studies on the surveillance of\nbloodstream infections and the latter where a high degree\nof confidence in the origins of the infection is determined.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nrecommends the CLABSI definition be used for surveil-\nlance of infections and defines it as: a confirmed BSI in any\npatient with a central venous catheter (CVC) present either\nat the time of or within a 48-h period before the detection of\ninfection. CLABSI are likely therefore to overestimate the\nincidence of CRBSI, as they do not fully confirm the source\nof infection as the intravascular catheter. CRBSI is more\nfrequently used in clinical research being a more precise\nand rigorous definition that requires isolation of the same\nmicroorganism from the catheter tip and peripheral blood\nor other validated methods including comparison of the\nnumbers of microorganisms present in peripheral blood\nwith samples obtained through the catheter or the differen-\ntial time to positivity of blood obtained via the catheter ver-\nsus peripheral blood (Chopra et al., 2013). For the purposes\nof this report we have used a single term and describe both\nThe risk of CRBSI is associated with a variety of factors\nincluding the site of insertion of the device and the severity\nof the patients underlying clinical condition. In 2009, the\nCDC estimated the number of CRBSI in intensive care\nunits (ICUs) across the United States to be 18,000\n(Srinivasan et al., 2011). In a pan-European survey of ICU\npatients, the incidence of CRBSI was in the range of 1\u00ad3.1\nincidence of CRBSI has decreased in more recently reported\nstudies following various interventions including a care\nbundle approach. For example, in a national critical care\nprogramme in the UK, the incidence of CRBSI fell from\nHowever, CRBSI are still associated with attributable mor-\ntality rates of up to 11.5% and may extend ICU stay by up\ninitiatives to reduce this complication raise the possibility\nof substantial savings (O'Grady et al., 2011).\nMore recently, improvements in quality of care have\nfocused on initiatives with a care bundle of evidence-based\ninterventions. For example, the introduction of a central\nvenous insertion bundle into multiple ICUs in Michigan,\nwhich included implementation and close monitoring of\nhand hygiene, the application of chlorhexidine skin prepa-\nrations and the use of the subclavian vein resulted in a\nMany interventions are included in the current guidelines\nfor insertion and care of CVCs. The guidelines available\ninclude those from the UK's National Institute for Health\nand Care Excellence (NICE) relating to infections in pri-\nmary care (NICE, 2012), epic3 which present national\nguidelines primarily for hospitals in UK (Loveday et al.,\n2014) and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices\nAdvisory Committee (HICPAC) guidelines in US (O'Grady\net al., 2011). The interventions recommended include: full\nbarrier precautions during insertion; use of a 2% chlorhex-\nidine gluconate in alcohol for care of the catheter insertion\nsite; the application of sterile transparent dressings to cover\nthe insertion site with replacement at least every 7 days; and\nthe use of alcohol to disinfect hubs and ports prior to access.\nAdditional approaches to prevent CRBSI have included\nthe introduction of new technological innovations, including\nantiseptic impregnated central catheters and chlorhexidine\nimpregnated sponge dressings, which have also been associ-\nated with significant reductions in infection rates (Casey\ntions, where both bundle interventions and technological\nsolutions have been implemented, the prospect of zero CRBSI\nis considered to be a potential goal. (Zingg et al., 2011).\nMore recently, the epic3 updated guideline included the\nrecommendation to use a 2% chlorhexidine gel dressing for\nintravascular catheters (Loveday et al., 2015). The purpose\nof the current study was to develop a model to evaluate the\neconomic value of implementing such a 2% chlorhexidine\ngel dressing in the care of insertion sites associated with\nCVC and arterial catheters in critically ill adult patients.\nThere is a paucity of studies which have demonstrated cost-\nsavings with individual infection prevention interventions.\nIn the UK, NICE (NICE, 2011) uses cost-consequence\nanalysis to evaluate medical devices. We therefore used a\nsimilar approach to estimate the cost impact of introducing\nTegaderm chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) dressing (3M\nHealth Care, Loughborough, UK) into clinical practice in\nadult critical care. The Tegaderm CHG dressing delivers\nchlorhexidine over 7 days from an integrated gel pad placed\nover the point of insertion of an intravascular catheter. A\nprevious study (Timsit et al., 2012) has suggested it is asso-\nciated with significant reductions in CRBSI compared to\nstandard, non-medicated, transparent film dressings (stand-\nard intravenous [i.v.] dressings). This paper describes a\ndecision analytic model, informed by parameters derived\nfrom published data, which has been used to estimate costs\nassociated with the use of Tegaderm CHG i.v. dressings\ncompared with standard i.v. dressings.\nMaterial and methods\nA decision analytical model (Petrou et al., 2011) was devel-\noped using Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft\nCorporation) to estimate the economic impact of a\nTegaderm CHG dressing when compared with standard i.v.\ndressings (defined as standard non-antimicrobial transpar-\nent film dressings) for patients admitted to an ICU requir-\ning an intravascular catheter. The economic perspective of\nthe model is the National Health Service (NHS) in England\nand Wales. The model used a short time horizon and the\nstructure of the model is shown in Figure 1.\nThe model assigned each patient with an indwelling\nintravascular catheter and a standard i.v. dressing, a base-\nline risk of associated dermatitis, local infection at the cath-\neter insertion site and CRBSI. The risks of these events for\npatients with a Tegaderm CHG were estimated by applying\nthe effectiveness parameters derived from the published lit-\nerature to the baseline risks. Costs were accrued through\ncosts of intervention (i.e. Tegaderm CHG or standard i.v.\ndressing) and hospital treatment costs depended on whether\nthe patients had dermatitis, local infection or CRBSI.\nResults were estimated as mean values of 10,000 probabil-\nistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) runs, each run with a differ-\nent estimate for the risks, hazard ratios (HR) and costs\nsampled from probability distributions representing uncer-\ntainty in the parameter estimates.\nBaseline risks\nBaseline risks were estimated using data from existing med-\nical literature. The outcomes included in the model were: (1)\nCRBSI; (2) local site infection; and (3) dermatitis.\nThe baseline primary outcome measure, CRBSI, was\nestimated from `Matching Michigan': a 2-year study of\ncentral venous CRBSI in ICUs in England (Bion et al.,\nrelated infections per 1000 adult catheter days, which is\nsimilar to the rate reported in other studies (Edwards et al.,\nICU for a patient with a catheter has been estimated to be\n10 days, a value that has been used in another economic\nanalysis (Ye et al., 2011). In the economic model, CRBSI\nrisk per patient was estimated by multiplying this length of\nstay by the CRBSI rate which resulted in a mean CRBSI\nA key secondary outcome measure of interest was the\nlocal site infection rate. There are substantially different esti-\nmates of incidence reported in various sources, with inci-\nlocal infection rate of 18.1% in their economic analysis and\nVokurka et al. (2009) reported a rate of local site infection of\nlocal site infection as 10% when using non-antimicrobial\ntransparent film dressings. This figure was also used in the\neconomic analysis by Ye et al. (2011) concerning an antimi-\ncrobial patch. In this current economic model, a conservative\nestimate of a mean local site infection rate of 10% was used\nas shown in Table 1 for the base case analysis.\nAnother outcome of interest was dermatitis. A dermatitis\nrate of 1.1% was associated with the use of Tegaderm CHG\nas compared to 0.29% for standard dressings (Timsit et al.,\n2012). However, this study was undertaken using a first\ngeneration version of the Tegaderm CHG dressing that\nappears to have a higher occurrence of this type of adverse\nevent compared to the current version of the dressing that\nutilises a higher permeability film backing. Indeed, the\nintroduction of a second generation Tegaderm CHG dress-\ning was associated with a reduction in the number of skin\nreactions reported in Manufacturer and User Facility\nwere comparable to CHG sponge dressings (Jenks et al.,\nuse of a CHG sponge dressing, a rate of device-related der-\nCHG dressing change protocol, respectively, was reported.\nThe rate of dermatitis in the current model was assumed to\nbe the average of these two dressing change frequencies. In\nthis current study, a mean dermatitis rate of 2.6/1000 cath-\neters associated with the use of Tegaderm CHG dressing\nwas therefore used as shown in Table 1.\nEffectiveness of Tegaderm CHG\nThe effectiveness parameters for Tegaderm CHG dressing\nwere estimated from Timsit et al. (2012), the only relevant\nstudy identified in a systematic review which was under-\ntaken in accordance with recommendations in the Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis\n(PRISMA) statement. The purpose of the review was to\nidentify studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of\n3M Tegaderm CHG dressings compared to standard i.v.\ndressings used in routine care of patients (age >18 years)\nFigure 1. Model structure.\nadmitted to a critical care setting such as an ICU who\nrequired intravascular access--via an arterial catheter or\nCVC or both--for at least 24 h. The details of the search\nstrategy used are provided in the appendix.\nHRs estimated from Timsit et al. (2012) were used as\neffectiveness parameters in the model for Tegaderm CHG\ndressing. As used in Ye et al. (2011), the HR for local site\ninfection was assumed to be the same as the HR for CRBSI.\nThe probabilities of developing a CRBSI and local infec-\ntions for patients given Tegaderm CHG dressing were esti-\nmated by applying the HRs to the baseline parameters. For\ndermatitis, the effectiveness of Tegaderm CHG dressing\nwas modelled as a relative risk (RR) and the probability of\ndermatitis for patients with Tegaderm CHG dressing were\nestimated by applying the RR to the baseline dermatitis\nprobability.\nCosts\nThe costs included in the model are the costs of the dress-\nings and those associated with the treatment, where appro-\npriate, for any local infections at the catheter insertion site,\nCRBSI and dermatitis. It was assumed that all other initial\ntreatment costs were the same and were not included in the\nmodel. The Tegaderm CHG dressing is readily adopted into\nclinical practice and can directly replace standard i.v. dress-\ning in the care pathways for arterial and CVCs. Therefore,\nno additional staff costs were included in the model.\nThe cost of standard care was estimated as the number of\nstandard i.v. dressings required multiplied by the unit cost of\nthis standard i.v. dressing. The number of dressings required\nwas estimated by dividing the average duration of stay of a\npatient with a catheter on ICU in situ by the average dress-\ning duration. The average length of stay for a patient with an\nintravascular catheter in situ on ICU was estimated to be 10\ndays (Ye et al., 2011) and with the prescribed time for stand-\nard i.v. dressing being between 3 and 7 days, this resulted in\nthree standard i.v. dressings required per patient. The unit\ncost of a standard i.v. dressing was \u00a31.34, as shown in Table\n1 and thus, in the model, the average cost of standard i.v.\ndressings per patient was calculated to be \u00a34.02.\nThe cost of using Tegaderm CHG dressings per patient\nwas estimated as the number of Tegaderm CHG dressings\nrequired multiplied by the unit cost of the Tegaderm CHG\ndressing. The unit cost of Tegaderm CHG dressing was\n\u00a36.21 for the NHS as shown in Table 1. Again, the number\nof dressings required was estimated by dividing the average\nlength of stay of a patient on an ICU with a catheter by the\naverage dressing duration. The average length of stay of a\npatient on an ICU with an indwelling intravascular catheter\nthree dressings per patient resulted in the average cost of\nTegaderm CHG dressings per patient being \u00a318.63.\nThe main cost driver included in the model was the cost\nof CRBSI, which included costs of diagnosis, catheter\nreplacement and the costs associated with increased length\nTable 1.

Lognormal distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose logarithm\nis normally distributed. Gamma (a, b) distribution, where a is the shape parameter and b is the scale parameter, is typically used for skewed distribu-\ntions and has a mean expected value of a \u00d7 b, e.g. the average value of the samples of distribution Gamma (198, 50) is 9900 (i.e. 198 \u00d7 50).\nof stay. Schwebel et al. (2012) reported that the mean addi-\ntional hospital length of stay for patients with CRBSI is 11\ndays, which resulted in a reported cost estimate of CRBSI\nIn Europe, additional length of stay in ICU has been\nwas regarded as longer than that seen in many ICUs in the\nUK by our clinical experts (the co-authors of this manu-\nscript), who considered that the average length of stay for a\nCRBSI patient will vary between 6 days (first 2 days in\nICU and the remaining 4 days in a general medical ward)\nand 10 days (first 3 days in ICU and the remaining 7 days\nin a general medical ward). In a UK hospital, the cost of an\naverage day in the ICU has been determined as being in the\nsultant time and consumables. This figure, in combination\nwith the extra ward based costs of \u00a3480 per day, results in\nan average extra total cost of around \u00a39750. Also, it is esti-\nmated that in clinical practice approximately 50% of intra-\nvascular catheters are removed due to suspected CRBSI\nand if they are subsequently replaced the cost is estimated\nto be \u00a3140 (acquisition cost of catheter \u00a335; X-ray for con-\nfirming position of catheter \u00a350 plus consumables of \u00a315\nplus staff costs to carry out the procedure at \u00a340). In view\nof this, a figure of \u00a3140 for catheter replacement has been\nincluded in the total cost of CRBSI, which results in the\noverall CRBSI cost of \u00a39890. This figure is very similar to\nthat used in a Health Technology Assessment (HTA)\n(Hockenhull et al., 2008) who reported a mean CRBSI cost\nof \u00a39148, that when inflated to present day costs using the\nhospital and community health services (HCHS) pay and\nCRBSI used in the model is \u00a39900 as shown in Table 1.\nThe cost of treatment for a local site infection was\nthat a cost of \u00a3250 for treatment of local infection in UK\nwas a reasonable estimate and was therefore adopted in the\nmodel as shown in Table 1.\nThe costs of treating dermatitis were taken from\nSchwebel et al. (2012), who reported that contact dermatitis\nrequires four standard i.v. dressings, removal of the catheter\nand insertion of a new catheter. They used a micro-costing\napproach to estimate the total costs as $228. We considered\nthat the equivalent cost of \u00a3150 for treatment of dermatitis\nwas acceptable and this was used in the model as shown in\nSummary of model parameters\nThe decision analytic model assigned a baseline risk of dif-\nferent events for each patient with standard i.v. dressing.\nThe risks of these events for patients with Tegaderm CHG\ndressing were estimated by applying the HRs from pub-\nlished literature to the baseline risks. A summary of the\nmodel parameters is provided in Table 1, along with their\nsources. The scope of this study was adult intensive care\npatients.\nResults\nFirst, we estimated the mean event rates that would be\nexpected in a typical patient if Tegaderm CHG dressing\nwere implemented instead of standard care. Tegaderm\nCHG dressing reduces the all event rates per patient except\nfor dermatitis (Table 2). It is of note that the formulation of\nthe Tegaderm CHG dressing was changed in 2011 to\ninclude a more permeable film on the back. The introduc-\ntion of second generation Tegaderm CHG dressing was\nassociated with a reduction in the number of skin reactions\nreported in Manufacturer and User Facility Device from\nWe then estimated the costs that would be expected in a\ntypical service for 1000 adult patients who require a short-\nterm intravascular catheter located in an ICU where\nTegaderm CHG dressing was the routine dressing instead\nof a standard i.v. dressing. Results were estimated as mean\nvalues of 1000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis runs, each\nrun with a different estimate for the risks, HRs and costs\nsampled from the probability distributions reported in\nTable 1. The model showed use of Tegaderm CHG dressing\nper adult patient. The Tegaderm CHG dressing therefore\nhas a 98.5% probability of being cost-saving compared to\nstandard i.v. dressings.\nThe total cost-savings is provided as a breakdown of the\nindividual cost differences as shown in Table 3. Most of the\nsavings described are due to a reduction in suspected and\nconfirmed CRBSI. There are higher costs associated with\nthe acquisition of CHG dressings but the savings in reduced\nevent rates more than offset these costs associated with the\ntechnology, as seen in Figure 2.\nOne-way sensitivity analysis was performed on all the\nmodel parameters. The baseline CRBSI risks and unit cost\nTable 2.

Thus, only the results of sensitivity analysis\nfor CRBSI risks and costs are presented here. At a lower\nmean cost savings were \u00a322,747 and at a higher estimate of\nmean cost savings were \u00a336,174 while the cost savings\nlower the CRBSI baseline risk and cost of CRBSI, the\nlower the cost savings. Similarly, the higher the baseline\nrisk of CRBSI and the cost of CRBSI, the higher the aver-\nage cost savings. Threshold analysis conducted suggested\nthat the baseline CRBSI risk has to be lower than 0.1 per\n1000 catheter days for Tegaderm CHG dressing to not be\ncost-saving.\nDiscussion\nOur analyses suggest that Tegaderm CHG dressing is a\ncost-saving strategy when implemented for care of adult\npatients with intravascular catheters in ICU. Tegaderm\nCHG dressing results in an overall savings of \u00a377,427 per\npatient compared to standard care with a 98.5% probability\nof being cost-saving compared to standard i.v. dressings. A\n12-bed ICU is estimated to admit approximately 770\npatients each year, the majority of whom will receive an\nintravascular catheter. The estimated cost savings for\nreplacement of standard i.v. dressings with Tegaderm CHG\ndressing in such a unit is \u00a359,600 per annum. The results\nwere robust to sensitivity analyses performed on the base-\nline CRBSI risks and unit cost of CRBSI. These average\ncost-savings reported are for units that follow the English\nnational trend for incidence of CRBSI reported by Bion\net al. (2013). Interestingly, the model also indicates that\ncost-savings can be found even in units with levels of\nDermatitis has been identified as an adverse event that\nhas a higher risk for CHG containing dressings compared\nto standard i.v. dressings. The results from this study indi-\ncate that the costs associated with the management of the\nrelated dermatitis per patient has a mean of \u00a34.66. Another,\nalbeit uncommon but potentially serious, adverse event\nassociated with the use of chlorhexidine containing prod-\nucts is anaphylaxis (MHRA, 2012). However, no systemic\nadverse events associated with use of Tegaderm CHG\ndressing were reported during a comparative study includ-\ntial costs associated with anaphylaxis were not included in\nthe model. It is of note that Tegaderm CHG dressing is not\nindicated for use in patients aged under 2 months and our\nstudy only included adult patients.\nThere are other published analyses studies of CHG\nimpregnated devices including CHG dressings, but to date\nnone of them included Tegaderm CHG gel dressing. The\nanalysis reported by Veenstra et al. (1999) compared the\nnumber of CRBSIs associated with CHG impregnated and\nstandard intravascular catheters and suggested that antisep-\ntic impregnated catheters are cost-saving. Crawford et al.\n(2004) performed a trial based evaluation and concluded\nthat CHG sponge dressings would reduce costs, local infec-\ntions and CRBSIs, and associated mortality. Similarly,\nHockenhull et al. (2008) developed a decision analytic\nmodel for patients requiring CVCs in the UK and suggested\nthat antimicrobial CVCs are cost-saving. More recently, Ye\net al. (2011) suggested that a CHG dressing is also a cost-\neffective CRBSI prevention treatment option. Furthermore,\nSchwebel et al. (2012) performed a trial based evaluation\nTable 3. Breakdown of cost results.\nStandard i.v. Dressing Tegaderm CHG Difference\nFigure 2. Breakdown of the different costs for standard and\nTegaderm CHG dressings (for a cohort of 10,000 patients).\ncomparing both 3- and 7-day CHG dressing with standard\ndressings and concluded that CHG dressings are associated\nwith financial savings. Our findings for Tegaderm CHG\ndressing are, therefore, in line with those reported in previ-\nous studies for antimicrobial devices used to prevent cathe-\nter-related infections.\nThe analysis reported in this paper has some limitations.\nAny modelling process involves simplifications and assump-\ntions that may not accurately reflect local clinical practice.\nOwing to the lack of detail of cost estimates in research stud-\nies included in the analysis, scenarios were developed and\ntheir costs were independently reviewed by members of the\nresearch team. The uncertainties about the assumptions made\nin the estimation of these costs (especially CRBSI costs)\nwere tested using scenario analysis and the conclusion that\nTegaderm CHG dressing is cost-saving remains valid in\nthese analyses. Threshold analysis performed suggested that\nthe findings are robust and that large fluctuations in the\nCRBSIratesandcostparametersareneededbeforeTegaderm\nCHG dressing becomes cost incurring.\nThe results of the current analysis have important impli-\ncations for the healthcare systems facing rising demand\nfrom emergency admissions into ICUs. The evidence sug-\ngests that the use of Tegaderm CHG dressing may substan-\ntially reduce the incidence of CRBSI and in doing so\nreduce the length of stay on an adult ICU and in subse-\nquent clinical areas. This would also reduce the need for\nthe use of antibiotic therapy and the risk of emergence of\nantimicrobial resistant microorganisms. The introduction\nof Tegaderm CHG dressings may also alleviate some pres-\nsure on acute beds and have associated consequent cost-\nsavings. In concurrence with these findings, NICE has\nrecently issued guidance suggesting that Tegaderm CHG\ndressing is cost-saving for the NHS in England and Wales\n"
