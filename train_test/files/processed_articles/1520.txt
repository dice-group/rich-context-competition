Peipert, MD, PHD\nBackground: To estimate the association between Trichomonas vagi-\nnalis infection (TV) and 6 sexually transmitted infections: chlamydia,\ngonorrhea, herpes simplex virus (Types 1 and 2), syphilis, and human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a nationally representative sample.\nMethods: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition\nto estimate the association between TV and sexually transmitted infec-\ntions (STIs) among women in the civilian, noninstitutionalized US\npopulation. The final sample included data from 3648 women, which\nbetween the ages of 14 and 49. Crude and adjusted relative risks were\nestimated using logistic regression for rare STIs (10%; chlamydia,\nsyphilis, and HIV) and Poisson regression for common STIs (herpes\nsimplex virus [HSV] Types 1 and 2). Statistical analyses were con-\nducted using Stata (version 9.2).\nResults: The prevalence of trichomoniasis was 3.2% with over 80%\nof cases asymptomatic in the past month. All STIs examined (chla-\nmydia, gonorrhea, HSV-1, HSV-2, syphilis, and HIV) were more\ncommon among women with a positive test for trichomoniasis. HSV-1\n2.32, 3.23) were significantly associated with trichomoniasis after\nadjusting for race/ethnicity, age, and recent sexual partners. In crude\ncommon among women with trichomoniasis, but these estimates were\ngreatly attenuated after adjustment for potential confounders.\nConclusion: Trichomoniasis is significantly associated with concur-\nrent STI.\nTrichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI)\ncaused by the protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), is the\nmost common curable STI in young, sexually active women.1\nExamination Survey (NHANES) found that 3.1% of women in\nthe United States have TV making it more common than\ngonorrhea and chlamydia combined.2 Another nationally rep-\nwere positive for trichomoniasis.3 Trichomoniasis was more\ncommon in black women with a prevalence ranging from\neducation beyond high school (6.3%) and those living below\nthe poverty level (5.4%).2 TV infections differ from other STIs\nin that the prevalence increases with increasing age among\nTrichomoniasis has often been considered a relatively be-\nnign infection, but given its association with other STIs, particu-\nlarly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and preterm delivery\nit is an important public health problem.3\u00ad6 For example, Kle-\nbanoff et al found that treatment of TV during pregnancy signif-\nicantly reduced active infection, but did not reduce preterm\ndelivery and, in fact, may have been associated with an increased\nrisk of preterm delivery.7 Disentangling whether these associa-\ntions are causal or simply the result of confounding by high risk\nsexual behaviors or other risk factors is essential.\nCoinfection of TV with other STIs is common; associ-\nations between TV infection and chlamydia, gonorrhea, syph-\nilis, and herpes simplex virus-Type 2 (HSV-2) have been\ndescribed.3,8\u00ad10 The correlation between increased risk of HIV\ntransmission and TV infection has been well supported by the\nliterature. HIV appears to be transmitted more easily with TV\ninfection; studies have shown that treatment of TV reduces\nviral shedding11,12 and potentially HIV transmission. Despite\nthe risks associated with TV infection, trichomoniasis is not a\nreportable disease and often is not included in routine testing\n(although may be detected during routine Pap testing).13\nIn this study, we examined the cross-sectional associa-\ntion between TV and 6 STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, HSV\nTypes 1 and 2, syphilis and HIV.

NHANES was designed to obtain nationally representa-\ntive information on the health and nutritional status of the\npopulation of the United States through interviews and direct\nphysical examinations. Methods describing this survey have\nbeen published elsewhere.14 This study was approved by the\nWashington University School of Medicine Human Research\nProtection Office.\nTrichomoniasis. Vaginal swabs were collected for the\ndetection of T. vaginalis. Detection was completed by perform-\ning polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing with primers from\na region of the 18S rRNA gene that produces a 312 base pair\nproduct. A sample was considered positive if it yielded a 102\nbase pair fragment after PCR amplification that was recognized\nby the Trichomonas-specific DNA probe upon Southern blot\nhybridization. A small percentage of swabs (2%) were catego-\nrized as not interpretable if both trichomonas and -globulin\nwere negative. The sensitivity and specificity for this test both\nChlamydia. Urine samples were analyzed for the pres-\nence of Chlamydia trachomatis via assay with ligase chain\nreaction TM amplification technology in the LCx Probe Sys-\ntem. Urine specimens were required to be first catch and\nspecimens that were moderately bloody or grossly mucoid were\nunacceptable.16 The sensitivity and specificity of this test using\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae. N. gonorrhoeae was evaluated\nfrom the same urine sample as chlamydia. This assay used\nligase chain reaction TM amplification technology in the LCx\nProbe System for the direct, qualitative detection of a specific\ntarget nucleic acid sequence in the opa gene of N. gonor-\nrhoeae.16 The sensitivity and specificity of this test using urine\nSyphilis. Multiple approaches were used for the detec-\ntion of syphilis. The Captia Syphilis-G enzyme immunoassay\n(EIA) was used as an indirect method for the detection of IgG\nantibodies to Treponema pallidum. If positive or equivocal, the\nrapid plasma reagin (RPR) was used to screen for syphilis. The\nSerodia TP-PA test detected antibodies to the various species\nand subspecies of pathogenic Treponema. In this analysis, a test\nwas positive if there was evidence recent or remote infection\n(positive or equivocal EIA plus one of the following: RPR, 8\nor RPR, 0\u00ad8 and TP-PA, positive).18 The sensitivity of the\nCaptia Syphilis-G EIA test is excellent (98.3%).19 Additionally,\na recent study found 97.7% agreement with the microhemag-\nglutination assay for T. pallidum.20\nHIV. Specimens were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2\nantibodies using the Synthetic Peptide Enzyme Immunoassay.\nSpecimens that were reactive in both tests were tested with the\nCambridge Biotech HIV-1 Western Blot Kit (Calypte Biomed-\nical Corporation, Rockville, MD). If the EIA and Western Blots\nresults did not agree, the Western result was used.21\nHSV-1 and HSV-2. Viral glycoproteins specific for\nHSV-2 (designated gG-2) and HSV-1 (designated gG-1) have\nbeen identified. Solid-phase enzymatic immunodot assays were\nused to detect antibodies reactive to these antigens,22 which has\ndemonstrated good sensitivity and discriminates HSV-1 and\nHSV-2.23 Serum samples testing positive for HSV-2 in the\nimmunodot assay were further confirmed by a gG-2 monoclo-\nnal antibody inhibition assay.24\nPotential Confounders. We examined a number of\npotential confounders including sociodemographic characteris-\ntics and reproductive and sexual history. Confounders were\nidentified via prior published associations or significant asso-\nciations (P 0.05) in univariate regression models. Age was\nincluded as a confounder due to prior published evidence of an\nassociation. Self-reported sociodemographic characteristics in-\nand 40\u00ad49), race/ethnicity (white, non-Hispanic; black, non-\nHispanic, Mexican American; or other race/other Hispanic),\nbirthplace (United States, Mexico, or elsewhere), marital status\n(married; divorced, widowed or separated; never married; or\nliving with a partner), education (high school, completed\nhigh school (or GED), high school), and poverty/income ratio\n( federal poverty level [PIR: 1[, PIR: 1\u00ad2, or PIR: 2).\nReproductive history variables included: age at first in-\ntercourse, STI history, use of hormonal birth control, pregnancy\nhistory, douching, and vaginal symptoms in the past month.\n15 years or later, or unknown. Douching was defined as any\ndouching within the past 1 or 6 months and vaginal problems\nwere defined as any itching, odor, or discharge in the last\nmonth. History of self-reported STI was defined 2 ways: (1)\nlifetime diagnosis genital herpes or warts or (2) diagnosis of\ngonorrhea or chlamydia in the last 12 months. A limitation of\nthe NHANES dataset is that it did not include questions on\nlifetime history of gonorrhea or chlamydia. Hormonal birth\ncontrol was defined as ever used birth control pills, injectable\ncontraception, or other female hormonal contraception. Preg-\nnancy history was described as ever pregnant, currently preg-\nnant, or self-reported delivery of a low-birth weight infant\n(5.5 pounds). NHANES also collects information on pre-\nscription medication use in the last month using a medication\ninventory method. We created an antibiotic use variable that\nwas defined as any antibiotic recommended for treatment of\nany of the STIs analyzed in this study (amoxicillin, ampicillin,\nazithromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, levo-\nfloxacin, metronidazole, ofloxacin, or penicillin).\nWomen who were 14 to 49 years also completed a\nsexual history questionnaire that included questions on history\nof sexual intercourse, lifetime, and last year sexual partners.\nHowever, due to confidentiality concerns, sexual history data\nfor individuals between the ages of 14 and 19 years are only\navailable at the National Center for Health Statistics Research\nData Center. Therefore, all analyses including these variables\nwere limited to women who were 20 to 49 years.\nStatistical Methods\nCategorical data were compared using  square tests.\nOdds ratios for associations with trichomoniasis and potential\nconfounders were estimated using logistic regression. Crude\nand adjusted relative risks for the association of individual STIs\nand trichomoniasis were estimated using logistic regression for\nrare STIs (10%; chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV) and Poisson\nregression with robust error variance for common STIs (HSV 1\nand 2).25 Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (ver-\nsion 9.2).26 The 2-year individual weights estimated by the\nNational Center of Health Statistics and made available as part\nof the NHANES dataset are adjusted to the entire US popula-\ntion, based on 2000 Census information. To accommodate the\nthe US population; the weight for each individual was divided\nby 2 to provide a single estimate for the entire US population.\nTrichomoniasis and Other STI\nTABLE 1.

Of note, there were too few events\namong non-Hispanic white and Mexican American women to\nmake inferences about chlamydia, gonorrhea, past syphilis, or\nHIV infection. For all racial groups, women with TV had\nsignificantly rates of HSV-2 than those without. A similar\nfinding was observed for HSV-1 for white and black women,\nbut not Mexican American women. Among Mexican American\nwomen 82.5% women with TV were positive for HSV-1 com-\npared with 80.8% among those without TV.\nFinally, the prevalences of both a positive treponemal\nP 0.001) were significantly higher among women with\ntrichomoniasis (Table 3).

In a prospective cohort study of female sex workers in\nKenya, the association of HSV-2 and trichomoniasis was ex-\namined and the incidence risk ratio for TV infection with\nHSV-2 was 2.3.27 Interestingly, there are no other studies, to\nour knowledge, that have shown an association between TV\nand HSV-1. The association between trichomoniasis and\nHSV-1 is modest after adjustment, however, this is likely an\nunderestimate of the true association because diagnosis of\nHSV-1 was determined through serological testing. Serological\ntesting does not allow differentiation among infection sites or\ntransmission pathways. Given that there is little biologic plau-\nsibility for the association of oral HSV-1 and vaginal tricho-\nmoniasis, it is possible that the association of genital HSV-1\nand TV is even greater than our estimate. Testing the infec-\ntion site and transmission pathway is important in getting a\ntrue estimate of the association as multiple recent studies\nhave found a shifting proportion genital herpes cases attrib-\nStark racial disparities in TV prevalence have been\ndocumented in examination of this sample2 as well as other\npopulation-based studies.3 Sample size prevented stratified\nanalysis, but we found that HSV-2 was more common in\nTV-positive women among all racial/ethnic groups. HSV-1 was\nmore common among TV-positive women among white and\nblack women, but not Mexican American women. The rate of\nHSV-1 for Mexican American was high compared to white and\nblack women and similar irrespective of TV status, but com-\nparable to estimates generated from NHANES.31\nThe association between chlamydia and TV infection\nalso proves to be interesting. When looking at all women in our\nanalysis there was not a clear association between these 2\ninfections, however, when categorized by age, an important\nrisk factor for chlamydial infection, the younger and higher risk\nage group (14\u00ad25) showed a statistically significant correlation\nof TV infection with chlamydia. It is possible that when com-\nbined with the low prevalence group of women 26 years of age\nand older, the effect estimate was attenuated, not accurately\nreflecting the prevalence in either age group. In a study by\nsimilar dampening of chlamydia rates were seen. Their results\nshowed that in women aged 14 to 19 the prevalence of chla-\nmydia was 4.6%, but among older aged women chlamydia\nprevalence was found to 1.9% with an overall rate of 2.5%.33\nA relationship between trichomoniasis and syphilis as\nwell as HIV was also seen. However, upon adjusting for\nrace/ethnicity and age the relationship was no longer signifi-\ncant. This may be due to small sample size and confounding\nfactors that play a role in HIV and syphilis transmission and\nacquisition. The correlation of TV infection and HIV has been\nwell-documented and therefore may still be clinically important\nregardless of confounders. As additional waves of NHANES\ndata are released this should be studied further.\nIt is hypothesized that TV infection may lead to easier\nacquisition of HIV or that TV and HIV coinfection may in-\ncrease transmission to sexual partners. Infection with TV re-\ncruits a local cellular immune response, leading to an increased\nnumber of white blood cells in the genital region and also often\ncauses lesions in the genital region; the presence of white blood\ncells and lesions can increase acquisition, allowing for easier\nentry of HIV and also having an increased number of target\ncells. This may also work to increase viral shedding by making\nviral exiting easier.34,35 The association could possibly be due\nto immunosuppression associated with HIV that may lead to\nbecoming infected with TV more readily.4\nOne of the strengths of our study is that the data are\ngeneralizable to the population of reproductive aged females in\nthe United States. Women eligible for this analysis were at\nslightly lower risk for STI based on demographic characteris-\ntics and lifetime number of sexual partners than the entire\nsample, possibly reflecting participation bias. As most studies\nof coinfection with TV are in higher risk populations, such as\nwomen attending STI clinics, this study provides important\ninformation on women in the general population who may be\nlow risk for STIs or may not seek health care. Finally, the\nmethod used to diagnose trichomoniasis was PCR detection,\nwhich is the most sensitive measure of TV infection.36\nOur study was cross-sectional in design and therefore it\nwas not possible to establish temporality between trichomoni-\nasis and concurrent STI. Therefore, it cannot be established\nwhether TV leads to increased infection with other STIs, or if\nthe other STIs increase TV infection. There are multiple pos-\nsible mechanisms through which TV may increase the risk of\nsubsequent STI. TV may increase infection through genital\nlesions and/or recruitment of white blood cells to the site of\ninfection. TV may increase vaginal pH reducing defense mech-\nanisms against STIs.37 An additional, noncausal explanation\ncould be that STIs are concurrent due to sexual risk factors that\nincrease the overall risk of infection. Moreover, as a cross-\nsectional study we have limited information on recent receipt of\nantibiotics, which may explain the low prevalences of chla-\nmydia and gonorrhea which are screened for during routine\ncare and easily treated. Another potential limitation could in-\nclude nondifferential misclassification of STIs, particularly of\nchlamydia (which has a sensitivity of 80.5 and specificity of\n98.4, respectively) that may have biased the results towards the\nnull. Moreover, as a number of the STIs examined were not\ncurable, this study may be influenced by incidence-prevalence\nbias, a form of selection bias. Certain demographic and repro-\nductive characteristics at the time of the survey may (e.g., age\nor number of recent sexual partners) have changed since the\ntime of viral infection. And finally, due to the rare outcomes of\nHIV and syphilis, there was inadequate power to determine\nwhether inferences could be made about TV coinfection.\nTrichomoniasis is the most common STI. It is typically\nasymptomatic and is associated with concurrent STIs among\nwomen in the general population. The associations we have found\nin this cross-sectional association were modest, but given that\nnondifferential misclassification may have led to underestimation\nof associations and the prevalence of genital herpes infections,\nthere may be significant public health impact. Given this associ-\nation it is important to rethink whether this infection should be\nincluded in targeted STI screening in high-risk women. The im-\nplications for adverse outcomes with TV suggest that more routine\ntesting for TV infection should be considered. Recognizing this\ninfection may help prevent further infection with other STIs and\nmay help avoid adverse reproductive outcomes.\nREFERENCES\n1. Weinstock H, Berman S, Cates W.
