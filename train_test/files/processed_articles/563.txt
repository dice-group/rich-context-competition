Such sub-\nsidies have come under heavy criticism on economic\ngrounds because of the often heavy financial burden\non governments and because subsidizing kerosene\ndirectly is not an efficient way to reach the poor [1, 2].\nOften heavily encouraged by international financial\norganizations, there have been attempts by govern-\nments to reduce kerosene subsidies that have some-\ntimes had to be reversed because of domestic political\ndifficulties due to heavy public resistance [3]. This\nillustrates a major problem with untargeted subsidies\n--they are difficult to take away. In addition, because\nof its similarity to diesel, with which it can be mixed,\nsubsidized kerosene is often diverted away from its\nintended recipients into other sectors [2]. This is a\nsignificant reason why the Government of India\nrecently announced placing kerosene under its direct\nbenefit transfer scheme [4]. Despite the good intent of\nsuch subsidy programs, the inefficiencies due to poor\ntargeting and diversion severely limit their effective-\nness [5], and likely do not promote the best or most\ncost-effective solution given the increased availability\nRECEIVED\nPUBLISHED\nOriginal content from this\nwork may be used under\nthe terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution 3.0\nlicence.\nAny further distribution of\nthis work must maintain\nattribution to the\nauthor(s) and the title of\nthe work, journal citation\nand DOI.\nof more efficient fuels and technologies for delivering\nthe same (or better) level of service even in areas with\npoor electricity coverage, such as liquefied petroleum\ngas (LPG) and solar lamps [6\u00ad8].\nIn recent years, it has become recognized that ker-\nosene subsidies pose other problems as well due to the\nincreased use they encourage. Evidence is accumulat-\ning that whether used as a cooking or lighting fuel, air\npollution emissions from simple kerosene-fueled\ndevices pose significant health risks, possibly greater\non a per-mass basis than biomass smoke [9]. In addi-\ntion, kerosene lighting is now understood to be a sig-\nnificant source of black carbon (BC) emissions--an\nimportant climate-altering pollutant--in several parts\nof the world including South Asia [10]. Finally, with\nthe rise of concern about fossil CO2\nemissions, there is\ngrowing criticism of subsidies for any fossil fuel [11].\nThe most successful elimination of kerosene sub-\nsidies in recent history was in Indonesia where in just a\nfew years starting in 2007, kerosene subsidies were\nphased out while slightly increasing LPG subsidies as\nwell as instituting a range of other facilitating actions.\nThe result was a massive shift from kerosene to LPG\nfor cooking apparently saving the Indonesian treasury\nbillions of dollars in net subsidy each year, increasing\nthe efficiency and convenience and lowering the cost\nof cooking for tens of millions of households [12].\nThe largest use of subsidized kerosene in the world\nis in India where there have been calls to follow the\nIndonesian example to relieve the approximate USD 5\nbillion [4] subsidy burden on the taxpayer each year, as\nwell as achieve other benefits [13]. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the kerosene situation in India is quite differ-\nent in that, unlike Indonesia, most kerosene is used for\nlighting not cooking. Thus reducing kerosene sub-\nsidies could potentially have considerable public wel-\nfare impacts on the large fraction of the poor who do\nnot have access to reliable electricity supply. Indone-\nsian households, on the other hand, were more than\n90% electrified at the start of their switch out of\nkerosene.\nThus, to facilitate a shift from kerosene to cleaner\nand more efficient alternatives in India, and poten-\ntially elsewhere, requires a detailed understanding of\nits role in lighting, which is the purpose of this paper.\nKerosene as a lighting fuel\nAchieving adequate household illumination chal-\nlenges many families in India as well as other develop-\ning countries. An estimated 1.2 billion people lacked\nmore experienced frequent supply interruptions. In\nthe absence of electricity, homes frequently turn to\nfuel-based light sources for illuminating their homes\nand businesses [15]. Often encouraged by government\nsubsidies, kerosene-fueled lamps are a common light\nprimary lighting [16], not including those reliant on it\nfor backup light. The most economically accessible\nand widely used kerosene lamps provide poor illumi-\nnation relative to electricity and can be highly ineffi-\ncient [17], converting as much as a tenth of the fuel\ncarbon to health-impacting and climate-altering parti-\nculate matter (PM) [10]. Even after electricity connec-\ntions are achieved, households may continue to rely on\nkerosene or other inefficient light sources, such as\ncandles, for some years [18].\nLack of residential lighting is recognized as a\nhousehold energy problem; however, compared to\nstudies of cooking, few efforts have quantified the\npotential impacts or benefits of kerosene replacement.\nConsequently, lighting activities are often absent from\nhealth and climate assessments that discuss improve-\nments to the `household' sector. Factors linked to resi-\ndential lighting, particularly electricity [7] and access\nto cleaner petroleum-based fuels [8], however, may\ninfluence other energy activities which co-exist in the\nsame household energy system. By strengthening the\nunderstanding of individual system components, it\nmay be possible to improve the effectiveness of future\nresidential energy programs.\nThis study aims to improve the understanding of\nwelfare impacts resulting from the most widely used\nfuel-based lighting source globally--kerosene--and\nto begin to estimate the potential impacts of efforts to\nreduce its use. We specifically examine the role of ker-\nosene for supplemental lighting within homes with\nelectricity, and the associated impacts of use in this\ncontext in India. This analysis is facilitated by a nation-\nally representative household survey with detailed\nenergy end-use information.\n\u00b7 From an analysis of a nationally representative\nhousehold survey from 2005, trends in kerosene\nconsumption for lighting are reported in relation to\nhousehold and energy access characteristics, to\nexamine drivers of use.\n\u00b7 Residential consumption of kerosene for lighting in\nscenario and alternate scenarios that modify the\nelectricity grid connection rate, electricity service\nreliability (hours of electricity available), kerosene\nprice (subsidization), and use of clean replacement\ntechnology.\n\u00b7 Pollutant emissions and adult health burden from\noutdoor particulate matter (PM2.5\n) exposures are\nscenario and alternate scenarios.

Survey-based trends informed a service\ndemand model for kerosene, which was linked to the\nwidely used integrated assessment model, Model for\nEnergy Supply System Alternatives and their General\nEnvironmental Impacts (MESSAGE) [23], to allow\nfor residential demand to be influenced by macro\nfeedbacks from the larger energy system, particularly\nvia energy prices. Alternate future scenarios were\nused to test the effect of fuel price, electricity\nconnection and electricity supply reliability on future\nconsumption of kerosene for lighting. Pollutant\nemissions from kerosene lighting and outdoor PM2.5\nconcentrations for calculating changes in health\nburden were estimated using the Greenhouse Gas\nand Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies\nFigure 1. Study workflow.\nSurvey and base year analysis\nThe IHDS obtains household expenditure and quan-\ntity of kerosene consumed in the previous 30 days, as\nwell as the activity for which it is mainly used,\nincluding options of `combination use' and `no use'.\nInformation on consumption and activity is collected\nregardless of the position of kerosene in the household\nenergy hierarchy (e.g. primary, secondary etc), thus\nproviding a measure of `any use'. We assume that all\nkerosene use reported is used to meet the specified\nservice or combination of services. `Primary users' are\ndefined as households without electricity connection\nusing kerosene for any lighting, and `supplemental\nusers' as having electricity connection, of any service\nlevel, using kerosene for any lighting. To facilitate\nanalysis, we disaggregated the population into thirteen\ngroups over three levels: geographic sector (urban or\nrural), total household expenditure ($/person-year)\nand electricity service level (no electricity, service less\nused for analysis was purchasing power parity of 2005\n($), unless specified otherwise.\nAlternate scenarios and future kerosene\nconsumption\nAlternate scenarios were developed to examine the\neffect of kerosene price, electricity connection rate,\ndemand for kerosene as a lighting fuel (table 1).\nKerosene demand in the future was adjusted for\nchanges in population size, household income, kero-\nsene price, and their associated feedbacks, based on\nmethods developed for the Global Energy Assessment\n[26, 27]. We include a replacement scenario (Solar)\nwhere primary and supplemental kerosene lighting\nservices are entirely replaced by 2030 with clean\nlighting technology independent of the grid. This\ntechnology is assumed here to be pico-solar LED\nlamps equivalent in price and performance to entry-\nlevel devices meeting the Lighting Global Minimum\nQuality Standards [6, 28], although we recognize that\nnumerous technological options for replacing kero-\nsene exist [6].

Impacts were\napportioned between primary and supplemental user\ngroups when possible.\nEstimated quantities of kerosene used for lighting\nservices were combined with device stock estimates\nand emission factors to add domestic lighting as a sec-\ntor within the GAINS emission inventory for India. As\npart of GAINS, outdoor concentrations of primary\nare estimated using a source-receptor relation-\nship derived from the TM5 model [29].

Exposures occurring\nindoors are likely an important contributor to kero-\nsene lighting impacts but are not evaluated here. Epi-\ndemiological evidence associating health risks with\nreported kerosene use in the home, or micro-environ-\nmental exposures are few [9], and require confirma-\ntion before the burden due to indoor exposure can be\nestimated with confidence.\nThe past economic impact of kerosene used for\nlighting in India was estimated by calculating its DWL.\nDWL is a measure of the economic inefficiency result-\ning from an imposed change in the price of a\nTable 1.

Fossil fuel\nsubsidies are also unique because of the potential for\ntheir emissions to impose social (external) costs. We\nvalue some of these external costs by calculating the\nsocial cost of CO2\nand BC emissions on climate,\nrestricting this to consumption of DWL kerosene.\nMethods used are informed by those described in [35].\nResults\nHistoric consumption trends in India\ntheir main end-use, with cooking reported by 20%,\nheating 2%, and combination use (assumed cooking\nand lighting) by 14%.

Changes\nKerosene demand\nUnder the baseline scenario (baseline), there is gradual\nreduction in kerosene consumption for lighting that\ncontinues beyond 2030, indicating a continued reli-\nance on non-grid lighting energy for the next decades\n(figure 4).

Complementing UC with better electricity\nsupply reliability (greater than 16 h d-1, UCS) reduces\nconsumption by an additional 20% over the same\nperiod. Kerosene reductions due to electricity access\nare attenuated in the future by an opposing effect of\nincome growth.\nThe largest deviations from baseline, without\nassumed replacement of kerosene (Solar), result from\ntotal demand is reduced by 80% from baseline as a\nresult of a steady annual removal of the subsidy (SPO\nscenario). High price sensitivity has a similarly strong\neffect under the full subsidy bounding scenario (FS),\nroughly doubling demand. While the magnitude of\nchanges is sensitive to demand elasticity, overall trends\nremain similar, with UAS yielding the greatest reduc-\ntion among the electrification scenarios, and removal\nof the subsidy yielding the greatest reductions in kero-\nsene overall. High price sensitivity is consistent with\nfindings from a village level pilot study in India, which\nmeasured an 85% reduction in kerosene sales several\nmonths after the replacement of the kerosene subsidy\nwith unconditional cash transfers [1]. Previous studies\nhave also found consumption of residential fuels to be\nhighly sensitive to price [38], and for cooking services\nUsing kerosene demand, we estimated the finan-\ncial benefit of an effort that would support residential\nlighting services using pico-solar lighting in place of\nkerosene.

This\nwork will benefit from refinement, but represents a\nstep towards understanding lighting within the house-\nhold energy system of developing countries as well as\nbenefits of replacement of kerosene subsidies for\nmeeting lighting services.\nThe use of multiple fuels and technologies to meet\nsimilar energy service needs, often termed `energy\nstacking', has been observed for residential cooking\nacterize stacking are often motivated by its attenuation\nof intervention or energy transition benefits. Few stu-\ndies, however, have quantified the impacts and oppor-\ntunities from addressing stacking practices,\nparticularly in the future or for non-cooking services.\nThe consumption of kerosene for supplemental\nlighting was approximately equal to the amount con-\nsumed for primary lighting (used in houses without\nelectricity). However, characteristics and contribu-\ntions of supplemental users may be overlooked, as they\noften are, if only `main/primary' sources of any house-\nhold service are measured. Top-down fuel estimates\nmay do a better job capturing total residential fuel use,\nbut then must be disaggregated across end-uses. Pro-\nviding a better accounting of supplemental fuel use\nand identifying the services the fuel provides will help\nto improve and constrain, for example, pollutant\ninventories used to study household energy policies or\nmitigation options being considered to reduce air pol-\nlution or climate impacts.\nClear differences in kerosene consumption for light-\ning are observed across groups differing in electricity\nFigure 5.

Our scenarios suggest that little\nchange in kerosene demand can be expected till 2030\n(less than 10%), if electricity coverage improves, but are\nnot accompanied by better supply reliability or access to\naffordable kerosene alternatives. In rural areas in part-\nicular, we find that while kerosene use reduces as elec-\ntricity reliability improves, kerosene consumption will\npersist. This suggests that, in addition to reliability,\nissues of affordability and latent lighting demand may\nensure continued reliance on kerosene and other non-\ngrid light sources. Thus, electrification programs may\nmaximize population benefits by simultaneously\nincreasing financial access to technologies resilient to\ngrid reliability--for example, providing affordable\naccesstosolarlampsandchargeableCFLbulbs.\nEfforts that simultaneously address primary and\nsupplemental lighting may also carry considerable eco-\nnomic co-benefits.

The analysis\nhere was performed using historical data from India,\nwhich may not be representative of allregions relying on\nkerosene for lighting services. Historical data and trends\nbut represented the most comprehensive data available\nfor a detailed assessment of lighting activities at a\nnational scale and for exploring supplemental lighting.\nWe have focused solely on lighting demand in this\nanalysis, without considering how changes in access to\nhouseholdenergy carriers for cooking and other services\nmight impact kerosene demand--and vice versa. This is\nan important consideration, given that new energy\nsources could conceivably alter other activities in the\nhome. We also do not consider how a more rapid\ndeployment of decentralized electrification solutions\nmight affect the rate of increase in electricity availability\nand reliability among rural households and their\ndemand for kerosene. However, a broader analysis of\nthesedevelopmentsmightbeanareaforfutureresearch.\nConclusions\nRecent national commissions [44] have called for\nsubstantial reduction of kerosene subsidies in India,\nbut have not yet been followed by strong action,\nperhaps partly because of concerns about the full\nimplications for the country, particularly for the poor.\nThe analysis presented here, however, should provide\nadditional support for such efforts. We have found\nthat there would likely be sizeable benefits of reducing\nkerosene lighting on population, economic, and\nenvironmental welfare in India. Solutions that reduce\nreliance on fuel based lighting for supplemental, as\nwell as primary uses, may provide the largest overall\nbenefits, especially in the next decade. Evenmore rapid\ntransitions away from kerosene subsidies than con-\nsidered in this study will likely accelerate the realiza-\ntion of benefits evaluated here, but should consider\nhow and if lighting services in houses are affected as a\nresult of such transitions. Support for cleaner lighting\ntechnologies not reliant on fossil fuel subsidies would\nappear to be `no regrets' or `co-benefits' options for\nIndia, and could be implemented in parallel with\nsubsidy removal, although careful monitoring and\nevaluation is necessary to verify the effectiveness of any\nproposed alternative.\n"
