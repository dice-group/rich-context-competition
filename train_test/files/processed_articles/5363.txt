RLS is\ndescribed as an urge to move the extremities\nthat may be accompanied by dysesthesias,\nwhich is referred to as an unpleasant, abnor-\nmal sensation while at rest. Uncomfortable\nsensations are relieved by movement and\ncommonly worsen at night.2 Epidemiological\nstudies show that RLS occurs in 3%\u00ad15% of\nthe population in adults.2\u00ad4\nThe majority of cases of RLS appear to\nbe idiopathic in origin (primary RLS).\nSecondary cases are encountered in patients\nwith various neurological and systemic dis-\neases2. RLS occurs with increased frequency\nduring the course of several systemic inflam-\nInflammatory diseases of the body are a\ngroup of systemic disorders, which are\ncharacterized by enhanced systemic inflam-\nmation and oxidative stress due to a defect\nin the innate immune system.12 Familial\nMediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited\ndisease that is characterized by attacks of\npolyserositis, arthritis, and fever. Recurrent\nnon-specific inflammation in different joints,\nthe peritoneum, and pleura causes clinical\nsymptoms. The prevalence of FMF is high\nalong the eastern Mediterranean coast and\nAlthough an increased frequency of RLS in\ndifferent systemic inflammatory diseases has\nbeen reported, an association between FMF\nand RLS has not been investigated. Therefore,\nthis study aimed to evaluate the prevalence\nrate of RLS in a sample of patients with FMF\nand compare this prevalence with that of a\nmatched normal population\nMaterials and Methods\nWe studied 60 patients with FMF at\nCumhuriyet Medical University Hospital\nDiagnosis of FMF was made according the\nTel\u00adHashomer criteria and MEFV gene\nanalysis (Table 1).15 Healthy age- and sex-\nmatched control volunteers were recruited\nfrom the general population.\nAll patients and control subjects underwent\na structured interview on concurrent similar\ndiseases that cause RLS symptoms. Subjects\nwith diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease,\nmalignancies, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), sys-\ntemic lupus erythamotosis (SLE), inflamma-\ntory gastrointestinal diseases, malignancies,\nand neurological diseases, including multiple\nsclerosis, polyneuropathy, and Parkinson's\ndisease, were excluded from the study.\nPatients and controls subjects who were\ntaking medications that could potentially\ninterfere with RLS and subjects with alcohol\ndependency were not included.\nThe study was approved by the local\nethics committee. All of the subjects gave\nwritten informed consent according to the\nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nTable 1. Diagnostic Criteria for Familial Mediterranean Fever.\nTel\u00adHashomer diagnostic criteria (15)\nMajor criteria Minor criteria\nRecurrent febrile episodes with serositis (peritonitis,\nsynovitis, or pleuritis)\nRecurrent febrile episodes\nAmyloidosis of AA type without a predisposing disease Erysipelas-like erythema\nFavourable response to regular colchicine treatment FMF in a first-degree relative\nDefinitive diagnosis: two major or one major and two minor criteria. Probable diagnosis: one major and one minor criteria.\nA detailed neurological examination was\nperformed by a neurologist in all subjects.\nThis examination included deep tendon\nreflexes, pathological reflexes, muscle power,\nperception of a pinprick, touch, joint position,\nand vibration, and extrapyramidal signs.\nDiagnosis of RLS was assessed in\npatients and controls according to the four\nessential diagnostic criteria established by\nthe international RLS Study Group. These\ncriteria were as follows: (1) an urge to move\nthe legs, usually accompanied or caused by\nuncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in\nthe legs; (2) the urge to move or unpleasant\nsensations begin or worsen during periods of\nrest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; (3)\nthe urge to move or unpleasant sensations\nare partially or totally relieved by move-\nment, such as walking or stretching, at least\nas long as the activity continues, and (4) the\nurge to move or unpleasant sensations are\nworse in the evening or night than during the\nday or only occur in the evening or night.16\nAll of the subjects who received a positive\ndiagnosis of RLS were asked to complete the\n10-item International Restless Legs\nSyndrome Rating Scale (IRLSRS) to assess\nthe severity of symptoms17. This rating scale\nwas developed based on questions proposed\nby the members of the International RLS\nStudy Group. Each question had a set of five\nresponse options that were graded from no\nRLS or impact (score \u00bc 0) to very severe\nRLS (score \u00bc 4). This produced a total score\nIn all of the participants, blood chemistry\nparameters, including a full blood count,\nmeasurement of iron, ferritin, glucose, urea,\ncreatinine, aspartate transaminase, alanine\ntransaminase, calcium, potassium, magne-\nsium, vitamin B 12, and folate levels, and\nthyroid hormone profiles were investigated.\nStatistical analyses\nData are presented as mean \u00c6 SD. Statistical\nanalysis was performed with the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences for Windows\n(SPSS version 15.0, Chicago, IL, USA).\nComparison of variables between the\ngroups was performed with the Student's t\ntest and the Mann\u00adWhitney U test for\nnumerical variables, and the chi-square test\nwas used for categorical data. For all com-\nparisons, P values less than 0.05 were con-\nsidered significant.\nResults\nIn the study group, there were 60 patients\nwith FMF (47 females and 13 males) and the\ncontrol group was composed of 60 healthy\nindividuals (47 females and 13 males) and\ndistribution of age and sex was not different\nbetween the groups.\nThe diagnosis of RLS was established in\n(16.7%) controls using the RLS question-\nnaire (Table 2). The prevalence of RLS was\nnot significantly different between patients\nwith FMF and control subjects. The mean\nTable 2.

Although the\nprevalence of RLS and the mean IRLSRS\nscores tended to be higher in patients\ncompared with controls, these differences\nwere not significant. Each item of the sever-\nity scale was then compared between the two\ngroups. Significantly higher scores were\nfound in items seven and eight of the\nIRLSRS in patients with FMF compared\nwith controls. Item seven rates the frequency\nof RLS symptoms and item eight rates the\nduration of symptoms. According to this\nresult, RLS symptoms of patients with FMF\nwere more frequent and lasted longer than\ncontrols (Table 3).\nBlood levels of iron, ferritin, and haemo-\nglobin, hormone profiles, and blood chem-\nistry parameters were not significantly\ndifferent between the groups.\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first to evaluate the fre-\nquency of RLS in patients with FMF. Many\nstudies have reported an increase in RLS in\nseveral inflammatory diseases, including\nRA, SLE, Sjogren syndrome, Behc\n\u00b8 et's dis-\net al.18 found an increased prevalence of\nRLS in patients with RA. Similar findings\nwere reported by Salih et al., Taylor-Gjevre\net al., and Ishaq et al.19\u00ad21 No studies have\nreported an interaction between an\nincreased frequency of RLS and serum\nferritin levels. Hassan et al.9 found that the\nprevalence of RLS in patients with SLE was\nsubjects. An association between RLS and\nSLE disease has been reported in a recent\nstudy10. Ediz et al.11 recently reported that\n\u00b8 et's disease had\nRLS compared with 4.8% of control sub-\njects. These authors evaluated serum iron,\nferritin, and haemoglobin levels, and mean\ncorpuscular volume in the RLS group. They\ndid not find any difference in these param-\neters between Behc\n\u00b8 et's disease and RLS with\nthose without RLS.\nThe exact pathophysiology of RLS\nremains unclear. The majority of RLS\ncases appear to be idiopathic in origin.\nSecondary cases are encountered in various\nunderlying medical conditions, such as iron\ndeficiency anaemia, renal failure, and preg-\nnancy.2 Approximately 40% of cases of\nRLS have a positive family history with\ndominant inheritance and several gene loci\nrelated to RLS have been\nidentified.2,22Although the pathophysio-\nlogical mechanism underlying this disease\nis not completely understood, defective\nbrain iron metabolism contributes to the\npathogenesis of RLS. The descending dien-\ncephalospinal dopaminergic neurons, which\nare considered to originate in the A11\nneurons of the hypothalamus, are proposed\nto play an important role in the pathophysi-\nThe role of inflammation in RLS has\nbeen suggested by several studies that\nshowed an increased ratio of small intestinal\nTable 3.

Upregulation of hepcidin leads\nto decreased absorption of iron and may\ndecrease availability of iron in the central\nForms of neurological involvement that\nmay be encountered in FMF or are related\nto FMF-related diseases or treatment com-\nplications are as follows. Common neuro-\nlogical manifestations related to FMF are\nheadaches and muscle pain.27 Creatine\nkinase and electromyography results of\npatients with FMF are normal in those\nwith myalgia. However, myopathy has also\nbeen reported in amyloidotic kidney trans-\nplant recipients with FMF.28\nCentral nervous system involvement is\nrelatively uncommon in FMF compared\nwith that of the peripheral nervous system.\nVarious types of seizures, cerebral venous\nsinus thrombosis, pseudotumour cerebri,\noptic neuritis, central nervous system vascu-\nlitis associated with systemic vasculitis,\ndemyelinating lesions, ischaemic stroke,\nand recurrent aseptic meningitis have been\nThe present study showed that the preva-\nlence of RLS in patients with FMF was\nhigher compared with that in controls, but\nthis difference was not significant. Our study\nmight have been underpowered regarding\nthe number of subjects. The IRLSSG sever-\nity scale total score tended to be higher in\npatients compared with controls. However,\nsignificantly higher scores were obtained in\nsome items of the scale in patients with FMF\ncompared with controls. According to this\nresult, RLS symptoms were more frequent\nand lasted longer in patients with FMF than\nin controls.\nRLS has a broad worldwide prevalence\ndifferent prevalence studies in Turkey, with a\nrelatively high prevalence in the centre of\nTurkey.33\u00ad37 The frequency of RLS in our\ncontrol group appears to be higher than that\nreported previously in prevalence studies in\nTurkey.34,35 One reason for this discrepancy\namong studies may be the geographical\nlocation of Sivas City. All of the cities in\nthese previous prevalence studies of RLS\nwere at a lower altitude than Sivas (altitude\nof Sivas is 1285 m). The prevalence of RLS is\ngreater among individuals who live in areas\nwith a higher altitude.38\nThe circadian rhythm of motor restless-\nness and sensory symptoms in RLS and the\nassociation of symptoms with endogenous\nmelatonin levels suggest that ultraviolet\nradiation may be related to RLS expres-\nsion32. Our study was conducted in a region\nwith long-lasting winters, and people trad-\nitionally wear concealing clothing. These\nfactors likely reduced sunlight exposure\nand this could affect the frequency of RLS.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study to investigate the prevalence of\nRLS in patients with FMF. We did not find\nan increased frequency of RLS in patients\nwith FMF. However, results of this pilot\nstudy show that RLS symptoms in patients\nwith FMF are more frequent and last longer\nthan those in controls. Further investiga-\ntions are needed to examine the potential\neffect of severity of symptoms on sleep and\nquality of life, and to assess the prevalence\nof RLS in a larger number of patients with\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
