It summarizes key findings from preliminary analyses, and\ncontextualizes these results with extant sociomedical literature to recommend directions for future research.\nMethods: Cross-sectional data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) were used to\nexplore these relationships. Inflammation was assessed via the biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined\nassociations between CRP levels and two different domains of QoL: happiness with life in general and happiness\nwith intimate relationships. We used ordinal logistic regression with companion OLS models and Sobel-Goodman\ntests to assess potential mediation, and also conducted a variety of sensitivity analyses.\nResults: Findings suggest that mediation pathways for the overall association between chronic inflammation and\nQoL may differ markedly across particular outcome constructs. Specifically, it shows mediation potential for the\nclinical sequelae of chronic inflammation in frameworks using happiness as an outcome measure, but not in those\nusing relationship satisfaction. Disability appears to mediate the effect of inflammation by 27 %; chronic pain\nappears to exert a similar mediation effect of 21 %.\nConclusions: Pain and disability linked to chronic inflammation appear to play a small but significant mediating\nrole in the overall reduction in QoL observed among older adults with biomarker evidence of chronic inflammation.\nWe note that these patterns are best framed as dynamic elements of a complex causal fabric, rather than powerful\ndeterminants that override other factors contributing to QoL. Hypotheses for further exploration using longitudinal\ndata from the NSHAP are thus offered, pending availability of Wave III data in future years.\n",

Sumerau3\n Keywords: Inflammation, Quality of life, Elaboration modeling, NSHAP, Logistic regression\nBackground\nThe relationship between chronic conditions and quality\nof life (QoL) represents a key focus in medical sociology\nresearch [1]. Many of the conditions that sociomedical\nscientists have explored are inflammatory in nature [2].\nExamples include arthritis [3\u00ad8]; inflammatory bowel\n[20\u00ad22]. These studies consistently show that chronic\ndisease can reduce QoL in a variety of domains [23].\nConsistent negative associations have been identified\nbetween chronic inflammatory disease and overall happi-\nness with life, as well as satisfaction with intimate rela-\nLiterature on inflammatory disease and QoL suggests\nthat these negative associations may be mediated by com-\nmon medical consequences of chronic illness [25]. These\nsequelae generally include functional limitation and/or\npersistent pain [2]. Sociology distinguishes between \"limi-\ntation\" and \"disability\" as well as \"pain\" and \"suffering\" by\nilluminating how physical experiences become sources of\nsocial disadvantage [26]. In turn, these challenges can re-\nduce QoL by producing feelings of social alienation [27],\nderailed progress [28], and lost identity [29]. These\nchanges may arise via multiple social and clinical\n* Correspondence: xnowakowski@fsu.edu\n1Department of Behavioral Sciences and Social Medicine, College of\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2016 Nowakowski et al.

Indeed, medical sociolo-\ngists have begun to use biomarker data as a complement\nto diagnosed inflammatory disease in assessing health.\nThe common inflammatory biomarker C-reactive pro-\ntein (CRP) often captures chronic inflammation particu-\nlarly well due to its unique attributes [30]. Consequently,\nit has emerged as a predictor of interest in many socio-\nlogical studies of inflammatory disease. Reliable associa-\ntions have been found between blood levels of CRP and\nMuch of the sociological literature on relationships be-\ntween chronic disease and QoL focuses on how these\nconditions produce consequences that are both medical\nand social in nature. Indeed, a key contribution of this\nliterature is the idea that disease only becomes illness\nunder certain circumstances: when it affects identity for-\nmation processes [26] and/or threatens individuals' sense\nof being whole [32]. These same concepts offer insight\ninto how common sociomedical sequelae from chronic\nconditions may mediate associations between inflamma-\ntory chronic disease and QoL. Specifically, relationships\nbetween inflammatory biomarker levels and QoL may be\nmediated by diagnosis, disability, and pain.\nDiagnosis reflects a variety of physical experiences that\ncan later translate to disadvantages in the social world.\nIndeed, receiving a diagnosis formalizes a given person's\ntransition into the role of patient [26]. This shift occurs\nthrough the process of medicalization [33] because\nhealth care providers assert social control over people\nentering into the patient role [34] and thus confer legit-\nimacy [35\u00ad37]. Diagnosis can facilitate access to roles\nthe same time, diagnosis can also brand people as devi-\nand instill feelings of hopelessness [28, 41]. Diagnosis\nalso brings expectations to work actively toward recov-\nery [38], remain positive and hopeful [39], and weather\nsuffering with good humor [42]. For people with chronic\nconditions, these expectations are often unrealistic [39]\nand the resulting disappointment can lead others to offer\nless support over time [41].\nLike diagnosis, disability is as much a social construct\nas it is a medical one [26]. Functional impairment be-\ncomes disability when it becomes inhibiting in social\ncontexts [32]. This can bring a variety of negativeconse-\nquences for social life [44]. Coping with these\nconsequences can also lead to unexpected positive expe-\nriences. Having a physical disability thus does not\nnecessarily result in low QoL, but can introduce signifi-\ncant impediments to people's overall sense of well-being\nand fulfillment [26]. These challenges can include stigma\nembarrassment from inability to meet normative expec-\nPain similarly becomes suffering when it produces ad-\nverse social consequences [26]. Pain itself can prompt\npeople to seek medical care [26] and receive a diagnosis\n[39], and thus afford access to some of the benefits of this\nprocess. Yet by the same token, both the receipt of a diag-\nnosis and the experience of pain can levy dramatic nega-\ntive consequences on social life., Showing evidence of pain\ncan negatively impact both social [26] and medical [39] in-\nteractions by introducing feelings of burden and guilt [26],\nas well as frustration and disappointment [39] that eventu-\nally lead to anger and [26] withdrawal of social support\n[41]. Likewise, medical providers frequently express disap-\npointment in people who have not met the standard de-\nmands of the sick role [39]. Specifically, the sick role\ninvolves the core expectation that the person occupying it\nwill eventually recover and be free of symptoms. Providers\noften demonstrate not only disappointment, but also frus-\ntration and even outright anger with people who continue\nto experience pain from a chronic condition despite ac-\ntively undergoing treatment [26].\nSociomedical sequelae of chronic disease thus constitute\ngeneric processes [48] that entrench inequality in health-\nrelated quality of life [49]. Although relatively few sociolo-\ngists have studied these dynamics for chronic inflamma-\ntion and related diseases specifically, these conditions\nshare many clinical and social features with other persist-\nent diseases [23, 50]. Sociologists of health can thus use\ndata on chronic inflammatory pathology and conditions to\nexplore how pain, disability, and diagnosis may mediate\nthe overall experience of disease. Many of the datasets that\nallow for exploration of these relationships are relatively\nnew, and thus offer only limited insight into longitudinal\nprocesses. As additional waves of data are collected for\nmajor biosocial projects, cross-sectional inquiry can estab-\nlish a foundation for more sophisticated studies using\npanel designs when sufficient data become available. We\nthus used the two available waves of data from a relatively\nnew biosocial dataset on older United States adults to test\nthe mediational effect of inflammatory biomarkers linking\nchronic diseases and QoL. In this manuscript we build on\nour team's prior work linking inflammatory biomarker\nlevels and key elements of QoL, as well as social disadvan-\ntage and chronic inflammation.\nMethods\nWe used data from Waves I and II of the NSHAP. This\nbiosocial dataset provides information on physical,\nmental, and social health among United States residents\nvidual cases in total. NSHAP data documentation de-\nscribes the study sample as \"a nationally representative\nprobability sample of community-dwelling individuals\"\n[51]. African Americans, Latinos, males, and persons 75\nto 85 years of age are oversampled to boost statistical\npower [51]. Data are collected via a combination of\nquestionnaires, in-home interviews, and clinical exams\n(Table 1).\nThe NSHAP is designed as a panel dataset with mul-\ntiple repeated measures. However, only two waves of\nNSHAP data are currently available, making the data es-\nsentially cross-sectional at present for research questions\nrequiring three or more waves of data for rigorous as-\nsessment in longitudinal context. However, the older age\nof the study population [52] does allow for conjecture\nabout long-term impacts on QoL from a variety of\nchronic health conditions. A substantial foundation also\nexists [53] for using cross-sectional data to generate hy-\npotheses about mediation processes. We thus used avail-\nable data from the NSHAP to begin exploring these\nprocesses, with the goal of recommending trajectories\nfor future research. We used Wave I data to compute\nour final models because we did not have three waves of\ndata to represent each timepoint in the mediation path-\nway. This strategy offered the additional advantage of fa-\ncilitating comparison of our results in this study to prior\nwork by our team. However, we did conduct a variety of\nsensitivity analyses using the Wave II data, which we de-\nscribe at a later point in the manuscript.\nTo assess inflammation we used serolevels of CRP, a\nsubstance that circulates in the blood of individuals ex-\nperiencing significant amounts of inflammation. We\nnote that CRP is a biomarker of inflammation rather\nthan a direct measure of inflammation itself. CRP pro-\nvides compelling evidence that inflammation is present.\nThe NSHAP contains a continuous measure of total\nserum CRP. We retained over 87 % of total participants\nwith real data on the CRP variable, excluding cases with\nvery high values due to concerns about biologic plausibil-\nity [49]. According to NSHAP data documentation, these\nextremely high values for the approximately 300 add-\nitional study participants whose data were not used likely\nowed to measurement error [51]. Our initial analytic sam-\nple contained 1684 people whose observed CRP serolevels\nPrior to running any regressions, we made three sets\nof comparisons to ensure that using only data on partici-\npants with a successful CRP assay and then further\nrestricting the range of CRP values used did not intro-\nduce differential bias. First, we compared the full sample\nof NSHAP participants to just those with real data for\nthe CRP variable. Second, we compared those respon-\ndents with a successfully assayed CRP value to those\nwithout one. Third, we compared the participants with\nreal CRP values who were excluded due to concerns\nabout biologic plausibility to those whose values were in-\ncluded. These sensitivity analyses helped us avoid ex-\ncluding populations that would yield substantive\nadditional insight into our research questions.\nWe measured key elements of QoL using both emo-\ntional and relational constructs to facilitate comparison\nof results across domains. The NSHAP's \"generally feel-\ning happy\" and \"overall happiness with relationships\"\nvariables, provided data for each QoL component out-\ncome respectively. These constructs were assessed using\nvalidated questions similar to those from the NSHAP's\nimmediate predecessor and foundational inspiration, the\nNational Health and Social Life Survey [51]. These ques-\ntions were set up as Likert scales that included numeric\nlevels with corresponding text descriptors for the end-\npoints of each scale. Questions were structured as\nfollows:\nTable 1 Characteristics of sample population from NSHAP wave I (n = 1684)\nConstruct Variable Units Mean SD Range\n\"If you were to consider your life in general these\ndays, how happy or unhappy would you say you\nare, on the whole?\"\n 1 \u00ad unhappy usually\n 2 \u00ad unhappy sometimes\n 3 \u00ad pretty happy\n 4 \u00ad very happy\n 5 \u00ad extremely happy\n\"Taking all things together, how would you describe\nyour relationship with your partner on a scale from\n1 to 7 with 1 being very unhappy and 7 being very\nhappy?\"\n 1 \u00ad very unhappy\n 7 \u00ad very happy\nBoth outcomes were preserved as ordinal measures ra-\nther than dichotomized. Initially we also explored sub-\ncomponents of these overall outcomes, which the\nNSHAP captures as separate variables such as \"physical\nsatisfaction with relationships\" and \"emotional satisfac-\ntion with relationships\". However, we found that analyz-\ning these component outcomes separately afforded little\ninsight in excess of that yielded by the NSHAP's more\ngeneral questions about happiness and relationship\nsatisfaction.\nThe \"generally feeling happy\" variable is an experien-\ntial measure of subjective well-being that assesses how\nfrequently respondents have experienced happiness in\nthe 12 months prior to participating in interviews. The\n\"overall happiness with relationships\" variable captures\nfeelings of happiness specifically with respect to intimate\npartnerships in the same time window. Because having a\npartner can itself contribute to subjective well-being, we\nalso did some preliminary analysis prior to running re-\ngressions that revealed nearly all of the people in our\nsample were either married or cohabitating without be-\ning married. Incorporating partnerships as a control\nvariable thus added little value.\nWe operationalized physical disability by aggregating in-\nformation about activities of daily living and instrumental\nactivities of daily living with which study participants ex-\nperienced difficulty. We chose these measures because\nthey are both highly validated in the literature [44] and\ncorroborated by NSHAP interviewers after participants'\ninitial reporting [51]. We added binary scores for each of\nthe seven activities of daily living (walking one block,\nwalking across a room, dressing, bathing, eating, getting in\nand out of bed, toileting) and two instrumental activities\nof daily living (driving in daylight, driving at night)\nassessed by the NSHAP. Specifically, we aggregated each\nof the component ADL variables from the NSHAP into a\nsummative index by adding up possible values (0 or 1 in\nall cases) for a maximum disability score of 9 and a mini-\nmum score of 0, depending on how many activities people\nreported experiencing difficulty in completing. We used\nthis index to model the potential mediating impact of\nfunctional impairment in associations between chronic in-\nflammation and QoL.\nWe measured persistent pain using the NSHAP's vari-\nable capturing whether or not people experience pain\nwhile walking, which had real values for most study par-\nticipants and offered a reasonable proxy for chronic pain\nacross a variety of common daily activities. The NSHAP\nalso contains two additional variables that capture pain\nduring other activities: sexual intercourse and getting up\nfrom a sitting position. Our preliminary examination of\nthe NSHAP data, including exploratory factor analysis of\neach measure's unique value for modeling QoL con-\nstructs, suggested that \"pain while walking\" offered the\nbest insight into our outcomes of interest. In addition,\nthese other measures of pain were not available for a\nlarge portion of cases. The binary \"pain while walking\"\nvariable thus provided the best means of modeling the\npotential mediating impact of persistent pain on rela-\ntionships between inflammation and QoL.\nWe operationalized diagnosis status via a single vari-\nable in the NSHAP that captures whether or not people\nhave ever been diagnosed with a chronic condition. The\ndataset also captures information about 18 specific types\nof chronic conditions, including three that may include\ninflammatory pathology (asthma, gastrointestinal dis-\nease, and arthritis). However, we did not use these vari-\nables for two specific reasons. First, they only capture a\nsmall subset of the complete spectrum of health condi-\ntions that involve chronic inflammation. Second, they\nmay capture conditions that are not inflammatory in na-\nture, such as gastric ulceration or bowel perforation.\nThe binary \"any chronic condition\" variable thus pro-\nvided an ideal means of exploring the general mediation\npotential of a clinical diagnosis.\nWe used logistic regression to explore possible medi-\nation relationships between chronic inflammation, its\ncommon medical sequelae, and two different types of\nQoL. For each QoL outcome, we first computed bivariate\nordinal logistic models of the relationships between in-\nflammation and QoL. We also generated bivariate ordinal\nand binary logistic models of associations between inflam-\nmation and each of its common sequelae, as well as bivari-\nate ordinal logistic models using each suspected mediator\nto predict each QoL outcome. Next, we incorporated each\nof the three potential mediators into bivariate ordinal\nmodels of inflammation and QoL. For each outcome vari-\nable we computed trivariate models incorporating sus-\npected mediators in isolation, as well as more complex\nmodels using all three sequelae as an aggregated block.\nWe assessed potential effect mediation using Sobel-\nGoodman tests on a series of companion models com-\nputed using OLS regression. Although allowed by some\nstatistical software packages including the one we used,\nperforming these tests on ordinal logistic models is\nwidely viewed to be theoretically inappropriate. Perform-\ning these procedures instead on the companion OLS\nmodels we computed, which yielded substantively identi-\ncal results to our original ordinal logistic ones, allowed\nus to examine the plausibility of a mediation effect from\ncommon medical sequelae of chronic inflammation, as\nwell as the apparent proportion of the predictor's total\neffects mediated by the intervening variables.\nTo guard against reporting results that were merely ar-\ntifacts of our specific modeling framework and testing\nstrategy, we also performed a series of sensitivity ana-\nlyses. First, we computed regressions for all hypothesized\nmodels using structural equation modeling with boot-\nstrap standard errors and compared results to those\nobtained from ordinal logistic and OLS models. Com-\nparing results across these different modeling frame-\nworks allowed us to achieve reasonable confidence in\nthe findings from our ordinal logistic regressions and\ncompanion OLS models. Second, we compared our re-\nsults from purely cross-sectional modeling to those ob-\ntained with a variety of different limited-longitudinal\nmodeling specifications, finding results to be substan-\ntively equivalent. Specifically, we used CRP serolevels\nfrom Wave I; measures of disease sequelae at Waves I\nand II as appropriate; and measures of QoL components\nat Wave II. This allowed us to compute longitudinal bi-\nvariate models for each component pathway in the over-\nall mediation analysis, and limited-longitudinal\nexpanded models for the full framework, to which we\nthen compared our models using only Wave I data.\nFinally, we computed a set of models incorporating in-\nformation about a variety of other factors that can lead\nto social disadvantage. Specifically, we included data on\nsampled NSHAP participants' age in years, sex identity,\nethnoracial background, and educational attainment in\nyears. While the idea of \"controlling\" for such factors is\nmore abstract than concrete, including information\nabout social status and position can afford meaningful\ninsight about potential confounding of overall associa-\ntions between inflammation and QoL. Moreover, incorp-\norating structural covariates can illuminate possible\nfundamental causation of chronic inflammation by social\ndisadvantage, a process in which medical sociologists\nmodels that frame social structural disadvantage as a\nfundamental cause of chronic inflammation because the\nliterature increasingly supports this perspective.\nFor all ordinal logistic models, we performed Brant\ntests to ensure that parallel regression assumptions were\nfully met. No models yielded significant results on these\ntests, indicating that all models satisfied the basic as-\nsumption that the odds of moving between any two suc-\ncessive contiguous categories were roughly equivalent\nacross all levels of each outcome. Diagnostic tests were\nnot performed on binary logistic models because parallel\nregression is not an issue for outcome variables with\nonly two possible values.\nAfter computing preliminary models for every ana-\nlyzed pathway, we ran sensitivity analyses incorporating\ndata completeness elements and survey design variables\nfrom the NSHAP. This allowed us to account for the po-\ntential influences of participant non-response and data\nclustering. We ran models incorporating the survey\nweighting variables and compared results with those\nobtained from our initial regressions. To assess the po-\ntential impact of missing data, we also ran a series of\nsensitivity analyses using complete case samples (versus\nthe small variations in sample sizes that appeared with\neach bivariate model in the hypothesized mediation\npathway). Because these analyses either left our results\nsubstantively unchanged or slightly improved the signifi-\ncance of parameter estimates, we present unadjusted re-\nsults for ease of interpretation.\nThis research study was performed in accordance with\nthe principles for protecting data on human participants\noutlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. It was approved\nby the Florida State University Human Subjects Commit-\ndata obtained from Waves I and II of the NSHAP. No\nactive data collection with human participants was con-\nducted at any point during our research process. Conse-\nquently, we have no consent documents of our own to\nshare. All uses of data for this research fell within the\nscope of accepted activity for approved NSHAP data\nusers. No individual NSHAP participant data are reported\nin this manuscript.\nResults\nWe began by assessing the ability of inflammatory bio-\nmarker levels to predict each of the suspected mediating\nconstructs (i.e., disability, pain, and diagnosis). Table 2\nshows results from bivariate logistic regressions of each\nhypothesized mediator on CRP serolevels. In developing\neach model, we computed odds ratios for the relevant\nindicator. As Table 2 shows, we found reliable prelimin-\nary evidence to suggest pain, disability, and diagnosis\ncould serve as mediators of the overall association be-\ntween chronic inflammation and QoL. Specifically, CRP\nserolevels demonstrated significant ability to predict at\nleast one indicator of each variable. These results were\nobserved in both raw examination of CRP parameter sig-\nnificance attenuation by the hypothesized mediators,\nand Sobel-Goodman testing (via companion models) of\nthe purported mediation effects.\nFor disability, we found that each additional milligram\nper liter of CRP was associated with 18 % greater odds\nof experiencing high levels of functional impairment.\nThis association is significant with a p-value less than\n0.001. For pain, we found that each additional milligram\nper liter of CRP was associated with 17 % greater odds\nof experiencing chronic pain while walking. This associ-\nation is also significant with a p-value less than 0.001.\nFor diagnosis, we found that each additional milligram\nper liter of CRP was associated with 18 % greater odds\nof being diagnosed with any chronic condition. Once\nagain, this association is significant with a p-value less\nNext, we examined the potential ability of these socio-\nmedical variables to mediate overall associations be-\ntween inflammatory biomarkers and QoL outcomes. We\ndid so by incorporating each of the sociomedical indica-\ntors into models of QoL outcomes regressed on CRP\nserolevels. This allowed us to assess the degree to which\nsociomedical sequelae of chronic inflammation attenu-\nated the significance of CRP itself in predicting each\nQoL indicator. Table 3 summarizes results from these\nanalyses. Each of the three types of sociomedical seque-\nlae (i.e., disability, pain, diagnosis) attenuated the overall\npredictive value of CRP for QoL outcomes associated\nwith inflammatory biomarker levels.\nWe also assessed component fit for each covariate\nas well as whether or not these variables improved\nthe overall fit for each QoL outcome. We did so by\ncomputing Bayes Information Criteria for initial\nmodels (e.g., regressions of QoL outcomes on CRP\nlevels using only cases with real values on the included\ncovariate) and final models (e.g., regressions of QoL out-\ncomes on CRP levels and sociomedical sequelae). Each of\nthe three sociomedical sequelae significantly predicted\nby inflammatory biomarker levels (disability, pain,\ndiagnosis) substantially improved the overall fit of\nmodels for general happiness, but not for relationship\nhappiness. Modeling for the happiness outcome was\nconsistently and significantly improved by incorpor-\nation of all three sociomedical sequelae, whereas over-\nall fit for regressions of the other outcome became\nworse. These results mirrored our findings from\nSobel-Goodman testing on companion models of sin-\ngle mediators in the pathway between CRP and each\nform of QoL.\nWe then computed models for each QoL outcome in-\ncorporating the three common sequelae of chronic\ninflammation as a block. Findings from integrated mod-\neling of all three variables support the idea that these\nconstructs may collectively mediate the relationship be-\ntween chronic inflammation and QoL, but more in some\ndomains than in others. Incorporating sociomedical se-\nquelae of chronic inflammation as a block reveals strong\nmediation potential for a measure of overall happiness,\nbut virtually none for a measure of happiness with in-\ntimate relationships. Wald chi-square testing revealed\nthat adding the block of inflammation consequences\nsubstantially depreciated model fit, as did overall model\nlikelihood testing for the expanded regression equation.\nBy contrast, fit tests for the expanded model regressing\noverall happiness on CRP and the potential sequelae of\ninflammation suggested superior predictive ability for\nthe more complex model.\nResults from these analyses are shown in Table 4.\nWhen happiness with life in general is modeled as the\noutcome, two of the three common sequelae of inflam-\nmation appear to play a mediating role. Disability ap-\npears to exert the strongest mediating influence,\nfollowed by pain while walking. In fact, when modeled\ntogether with pain and disability, diagnostic status does\nnot appear to exert an independent mediating influence.\nDiagnosis with any chronic condition, however, is often\nhighly collinear with both pain and disability, which sug-\ngests this finding does not necessarily mean that diagno-\nsis does not independently influence the relationship.\nTable 2 Sociomedical sequelae regressed on C-reactive protein\nOutcome Predictor Odds ratio Model 2 Pseudo R2\n95 % confidence intervals shown in parentheses\nIndeed, sensitivity analyses reveal a consistent relation-\nship between diagnosis with one or more chronic condi-\ntions and decreased happiness with life.\nDiscussion\nOur findings provide support for hypothesized relation-\nships between chronic inflammation, pain, disability,\ndiagnosis, and QoL. Specifically, our results reveal that\npain, disability, and diagnosis may individually and col-\nlectively mediate associations between biologically-\ndemonstrated chronic inflammation and QoL. These\nfindings are consistent with evidence suggesting relevant\nsequelae of chronic disease and the ways such constructs\nmay mediate relationships between health status and\nQoL.\nAs suggested previously, research on how pain and dis-\nability impact QoL yields more consistent evidence con-\ncerning the direction of influence. Specifically, sociologists\nhave found that functional impairment and chronic pain\ngenerally reduce QoL in multiple domains [26]. Clinical sci-\nentists have observed similar patterns among people with\nmany specific inflammatory conditions [23]. Considering\nthat sociologists explain these declines in QoL via changes\nin health that threaten the integrity of people's relation-\nships with self and others [32], such findings reveal equal\nrelevance for sociomedical sequelae from specific chronic\nconditions and consequences associated with broader ex-\nperience of chronic disease.\nOur findings also support evidence concerning medi-\nating impacts of diagnosis on the association between\nhealth status and QoL. On the one hand, diagnosis with\nany chronic condition is typically associated with at least\nmodest declines in QoL [56], but on the other, diagnosis\ncan confer important resources and support systems\n[57]. The fact that diagnosis is not as strong or consist-\nent a mediator between chronic inflammation and QoL\nmay thus indicate that this variable exerts influence\nthrough multiple pathways. People whose conditions\nhave been diagnosed may experience unhappiness and\ngrief, but may also experience relief from anxiety that\nstems from reduced uncertainty about health and greater\nease communicating their illness experience [41]. Be-\ncause we measured only diagnosis with any chronic con-\ndition as opposed to specific diseases, findings may also\nTable 3 Potential mediation effects of individual sociomedical sequelae\nOutcome CRP serolevel Mediator Parameter estimate Proportion of effect mediated Sample size\n95 % confidence intervals shown in parentheses\nTable 4 Possible collective mediation effects from sociomedical sequelae variables\nOutcome Variable Model 1 Model 2 Sample size\n95 % confidence intervals shown in parentheses\nreflect that not all chronic conditions influence QoL in\nthe same ways.\nOur findings for both the pain and disability variables\nalso illuminate relevant deficiencies of the sick role con-\ncept as they relate to persistent inflammation. Non-\nvisible sequelae from inflammatory disease, such as\nchronic pain, may cause the sympathy of friends and\nloved ones to wane at greater speed [26]. This\nphenomenon is likely mediated by the discrediting role\nof invisible illness, which lacks social legitimacy [37].\nFunctional disability presents a different set of concerns,\nespecially when the impairment can be seen by others.\nPeople who experience disability from chronic disease\nmay experience relative declines in social isolation if\ntheir impairment becomes severe enough to demand\noutside caregiving [58]. However, gains in social support\nmediated by caregiving often occur outside the realm of\nintimate partnerships [59]. In cases where partners do\nbecome primary caregivers, partners experience high\nrisk of morbidity due to the role conflict and captivity\nthat can often result from providing care for an ailing\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the mecha-\nnisms by which the common sociomedical sequelae of\nchronic inflammation may mediate the overall relation-\nship between inflammatory disease and QoL are highly\nnuanced. Likewise, these mechanisms are often dynamic\nand multifaceted in terms of directional influence: A\ngiven medical consequence of chronic inflammation may\nexert important positive and negative influences on QoL\nsynergistically. We therefore encourage caution in inter-\npreting findings concerning the ability of these con-\nstructs to improve the overall fit of models relating\nchronic inflammation to QoL. Non-significant improve-\nments in fit do not suggest that a given sociomedical se-\nquelae variable confers no predictive value, but rather\nthat decomposing this variable into smaller elements\nmay be necessary to assess the different impacts it ex-\nerts. We also note that happiness itself is a nuanced con-\ncept, both within and outside of intimate relationships.\nOur reviewers for the first draft of this manuscript\npointed out that experiential measures of happiness both\noffer valuable insight and pose key limitations.\nIndeed, we further urge caution interpreting our find-\nings due to several limitations in our measurements.\nFirst, as noted above the two outcome measures are ex-\nperiential and reflect a relatively large time window of\n12 months. As such, they do not necessarily reflect vari-\nations in daily experience or the complexity of happiness\nas an emotion. Second, we also did not have access to a\ncomplex overall measure of chronic pain. While the\n\"pain while walking\" variable offered a reasonable proxy\ngiven the community-dwelling and age-diverse makeup\nof the NSHAP population, it did not capture nuances of\npain or its impact on daily activities. Third, as with any\nbiomarker, although we excluded missing measurements\nand those with obvious errors, there may be some mildly\ninaccurate estimates of participants' CRP values in the\nanalytic data stream. Although bias introduced by\nsmall measurement errors is likely to be to the null\n[30], we do note that our study mirrors other bio-\nsocial analyses in the need for continued replication\nand refinement of findings with varied data sources\nand populations. Fourth, although extant literature\nvalidates CRP as a general measure of chronic inflam-\nmation, less is known about how well CRP predicts\nthe manifestation and severity of specific inflamma-\ntory conditions. Care should thus be taken to further\nrefine such knowledge as biosocial research expands\nin coming years.\nWe also note an additional key limitation in the study\ndesign itself, albeit one that we cannot address at this\ntime given lack of available data. As previously noted, we\ndid not have three waves of data for use as only Waves I\nand II of NSHAP are presently available. We are thus\nunable to establish the full impact of mediation or pro-\nvide panel design type conclusions. We certainly encour-\nage fellow scholars to continue this research with\nadditional waves of NSHAP as they become available,\nand to incorporate more robust uses of advanced longi-\ntudinal modeling techniques and SEM frameworks using\nappropriate software.\nDespite these limitations, our study also presents some\nimportant strengths other researchers may build on in\nfuture research. First, our analyses focused on an older\nage study population, which grants greater probability of\nhypothesizing likely nuances and outcomes in the com-\ning years. Second, we were able to demonstrate some\nlongitudinal elements of mediation by utilizing two\nwaves of data throughout our analyses. Further, we pos-\nsessed solid biosocial data on inflammation, which is ne-\ncessary for teasing out nuances and influences along\nbiological, sociological, and psychological dimensions of\nhealth and well being. Finally, the NSHAP is built upon\nevidence-based inclusion and exclusion criteria, which is\nnecessary for accurate accounts of health and illness ex-\nperience within and between populations. We would\nthus argue that with the proper caution researchers may\nbuild upon our strengths to further understand the com-\nplexities of biosocial experiences of chronic conditions.\nConclusions\nTaken together, our findings suggest that sociomedical\nsequelae may indeed serve as mediators of the relation-\nship between chronic inflammation and QoL. However,\nthey also suggest that social pathways mediating the hy-\npothesized relationship between chronic inflammation\nand QoL may differ fundamentally for emotional versus\nrelational outcomes. More broadly, our findings indicate\na need for more nuanced research on social mechanisms\nthat may mediate the effects of chronic inflammatory\ndisease across a variety of different dimensions of QoL.\nIndeed, this interpretation mirrors robust evidence from\nsociological literature on QoL measurement concerning\nthe importance of capturing multiple outcomes [60].\nFindings also reflect potential nuances in the impact of\nspecific chronic conditions on QoL, and the diversity of\nthese experiences among people with different health\nprofiles and social locations.\nOur analyses of disability, pain, and diagnosis as poten-\ntial mediators of the relationship between chronic inflam-\nmation and QoL recommend three tentative conclusions.\nFirst, the overall association between chronic inflamma-\ntion and QoL is likely to be mediated by sociomedical se-\nquelae. Second, this apparent mediation is partial rather\nthan complete. Our findings suggest that chronic inflam-\nmation generally exerts influences on QoL in excess of\nthose explained by disability, pain, and diagnosis. Third,\nsociomedical sequelae appear to mediate the relationship\nbetween chronic inflammation and emotional QoL more\nstrongly and consistently than that between inflammation\nand relational QoL. Our findings suggest there may be\nmuch to learn from potential mediators between chronic\ndisease experience and varied components associated with\noverall QoL. We specifically recommend extending this\nanalytic framework across a variety of chronic inflamma-\ntory conditions and associated biomarkers.\nAbbreviations\nCRP: C-reactive protein; NSHAP: national social life, health, and aging project;\nQoL: quality of life.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nACHN designed the study, conducted data analysis, participated in\nmanuscript writing, and edited the final draft manuscript.
