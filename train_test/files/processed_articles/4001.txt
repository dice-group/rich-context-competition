This is one of very few studies that compare the\nprognosis of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (WHO grade 3, G3 NEC) with that\nof GC.\nand 56 with gastric neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with GC at Asan Medical Center in Seoul,\nResults: Patients with G3 NEC tumors that invaded the muscularis propria or shallower had\npoorer RFS than those with GC of the same type, while G3 NEC that invaded the subserosa or\ndeeper had similar RFS to GC of that type. Patients diagnosed with G3 NEC with N0 or N2 had\npoorer RFS than the corresponding patients with GC, while those who had G3 NEC with N1 or\nN3 had similar RFS to the corresponding patients with GC. G3 NEC patients had poorer RFS\nthan well-differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated GC patients, while\nG3 NEC patients had similar RFS to that of those with signet ring cell carcinoma (SRC). In\naddition, patients with G3 NEC of stages I or IIa had poorer RFS than those with corresponding\nGC, while G3 NEC stage IIb or greater had similar RFS to the corresponding GC.\nConclusions: Non-advanced G3 NEC showed poorer RFS than GC excluding SRC, while\nadvanced G3 NEC has a similar RFS to that of GC without SRC. Therefore, we recommend that\npatients with non-advanced G3 NEC of the stomach be given a more aggressive treatment and\nsurveillance than those with non-advanced GC excluding SRC.\n",

However,\ngastric NETs have increased in incidence [Modlin\n(WHO) has proposed a classification of NETs of\nthe digestive system based on the Ki-67 index\nnow, NETs are classified into the following\nsubclasses: NETs, grade 1 (carcinoid); atypical\ncarcinoid tumors (well-differentiated neuroendo-\ncrine carcinomas), grade 2; poorly differentiated\nneuroendocrine carcinomas (small and large cell\ntype), grade 3. Rindi and colleagues have pre-\nsented the `European Neuroendocrine Tumor\nSociety (ENETS) TNM staging of foregut\n(neuro) endocrine tumors: a consensus proposal\nincluding a grading system based on Ki-67 index\nand mitosis' [Rindi et al. 2006], and Pape and\ncolleagues have examined the prognostic rele-\nvance of a novel TNM classification system for\nupper gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine\ntumors (GEP-NETs) [Pape et al. 2008]. Recently,\nENETS published consensus guidelines for the\nstandard of care in NETs: `Towards a standard-\nized approach to the diagnosis of GEP-NETs and\nComparison of relapse-free survival in\ngastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (WHO\ngrade 3) and gastric carcinoma\nBeom Su Kim, Young Soo Park, Jeong Hwan Yook and Byung-Sik Kim\n Keywords: grade 3 NEC, gastric carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, relapse-free survival,\nWHO classification\nCorrespondence to:\nByung-Sik Kim, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Surgery\nAsan Medical Center,\nUniversity of Ulsan College\nof Medicine, 88, Olympic-\nro 43-gil, Songpa-gu,\nbskim@amc.seoul.kr\nBeom Su Kim, MD, PhD\nJeong Hwan Yook, MD,\nDepartment of Surgery,\nAsan Medical Center,\nUniversity of Ulsan College\nKorea\nYoung Soo Park, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pathology,\nAsan Medical Center,\nUniversity of Ulsan College\nKorea\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(5)\n408 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\ntheir prognostic stratification based on TNM\nclassification' [Kloppel et al. 2009]. However, the\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)\n(7th edition) proposed that high-grade neuroen-\ndocrine carcinomas and mixed glandular/well-\ndifferentiated NETs should be staged according\nto the guidelines used for staging carcinomas at\nthat site [Edge et al. 2010]. Thus, the staging sys-\ntems for NETs are not yet unified worldwide.\nIt is generally regarded that gastric neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs) are extremely malignant\nbecause they have aggressive biological behavior\nand frequently metastasize to lymph nodes and the\nliver, even in the early stages of the disease [Matsui\net al. 1991]. It has been suggested that angioinva-\nsion, tumor size, clinicopathological type, mitotic\nindex and Ki-67 labeling index are predictors of\ntumor malignancy and patient outcome [Rindi et al.\n1999]. However, there have been only few reports\nsupporting this view [Jiang et al. 2006; Kubota et al.\n2012]. In addition, Kim and colleagues reported\nthat the small cell type of gastric NEC did not have\nsuch extreme behavior [Kim et al. 2013]. We sought\nto find reports that compared gastric NEC (WHO\ngrade 3, G3) with gastric carcinoma (GC) in terms\nof relapse-free survival (RFS), but were unable to\nfind such studies. We therefore presumed that a\nstudy on RFS comparison in NEC/GC would be a\nvaluable addition to the current clinical knowledge\nin gastric cancer.\nMethods\nnosed with poorly differentiated G3 NEC of the\nstomach, and 56 were diagnosed as mixed type at\nthe Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea. Mixed\ntype was defined as NET mixed with GC. None\nof the tumors had metastasized and all were cura-\ntively resected. All tissues were reviewed by a\npathologist and classified according to the WHO\n2010 classification [Hamilton and Aaltonen,\naccording to the following criteria: availability of\nentire specimen; blood samples; full follow-up\nrecords; and records of genetic analysis between\ndiagnosis and all underwent curative resection.\nWe used the AJCC (7th edition) TNM classifica-\ntion for these tumors [Edge et al. 2010].\nWe compared the basic clinical features and sur-\nvival data for the G3 NEC versus mixed type pair,\nfor the G3 NEC versus GC pair, and for the GC\nversus the mixed type pair. RFS was defined as the\ntime from resection to recurrence or last contact.\nWe then evaluated clinical outcomes and RFS\naccording to depth of invasion, nodal stage, AJCC\nTNM stages and histologic differentiation.\nNumeric data are expressed as means with stand-\nard deviations, and compared using Student's\nt-test. Risk factors were analyzed using the chi-\nsquare test. Survival data were examined using the\nKaplan\u00adMeier method with the log-rank test. All\nstatistical data were performed using SPSS 21.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software; a p value\nbelow 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThis study received approval from Asan Medical\nCenter's Institutional Review Board.\nResults\nSubgroup clinicopathologic analysis: grade 3\nneuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed type and\ngastric carcinoma\nAll 63 G3 NEC patients had invasion of the sub-\npatients with mixed types showed confinement to\nGCs were confined to the mucosal layer. There\nwere distinctive clinicopathologic differences\nbetween G3 NEC and GC (Table 1): patients with\nG3 NEC were older than those with GC (p <\n0.05), and they experienced more lymph node\nmetastases, had higher stages and suffered more\ntumor recurrence than did the GC patients (p <\n0.05). Patients of the mixed type were also older\nthan those with GC (p < 0.05) and experienced\nmore lymph node metastases and higher stages (p\n< 0.05). In addition, they had a higher proportion\nof poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or signet\nring cell carcinoma (SRCs) than the patients with\nGC (p < 0.05), while showing a lower proportion\nof well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (p < 0.05).\nFigure 1 shows Kaplan\u00adMeier estimates of RFS.\nPatients with G3 NEC had a lower survival rate\nthan the other two groups (p < 0.05), who had\nsimilar RFS values (p > 0.05).\nAdjuvant chemotherapy\nWe could not compare the adjuvant chemother-\napy regimen between the three groups of tumors\nBS Kim, YS Park et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 409\nas a function of mucosal layer involvement\nbecause none of the G3 NEC was confined to the\nmucosa.

However, regimens of oral\nplus intravenous chemotherapy differed only\nbetween mixed type and GC. In stage 2 cancer, a\nsimilar proportion of patients in each group\nreceived chemotherapy. The route of chemother-\napy administration differed between subgroups.\nMatched-pair analysis according to depth of\ninvasion\nWe analyzed the relation between clinicopathologic\ndata and depth of invasions. For invasions reaching\neither the submucosa or the muscularis propria, the\nresults were similar. In the submucosal layer, G3\nNEC had more aggressive behavior, including\nlymph node metastasis and tumor recurrence, and\npoorer RFS than GC (p < 0.05). The mixed type\nalso had poorer RFS than the GC. In the muscula-\nris propria tumors, G3 NEC again exhibited more\naggressive behavior, including lymphovascular\ninvasion and tumor recurrence, and poorer RFS\nthan the GC (p < 0.05), and the mixed types had\npoorer RFS than the GC as well. In the subserosal\nlayer or beyond the subserosa, the results differed\nfrom those in the submucosa and muscularis pro-\npria: in the subserosal layer, there were no signifi-\ncant differences in lymph node metastasis and\ntumor recurrence between any groups (p > 0.05)\nand a similar trend was seen in the serosal layer.\nTherefore, we divided the cases into two groups.\nGroup 1 (Table 2) contained tumors invading the\nsubmucosa or muscularis propria; group 2 (Table\n3) contained tumors invading the subserosa or\nbeyond the subserosa. The G3 NEC in group 1\nhad more aggressive behaviors, including lym-\nphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis and\ntumor recurrence, than did the GC (p < 0.05).\nThey also had poorer RFS than the mixed type\nand GC (Figure 2a), which had similar RFS\n(Figure 2a) (p > 0.05). In contrast, there were no\nstatistically significant differences in surgical out-\ncomes including lymph node metastasis and\nrecurrence between the various types in group 2\nRFS according to nodal group, histologic\ndifferentiation and TNM stage\nWe evaluated RFS according to nodal stage. In N0\nand N2, G3 had poorer RFS than the other two\ngroups (p < 0.05), between which there was no\ndifference in RFS (p > 0.05). However, in N1 and\nN3, there was no difference in RFS between any\ngroups (p > 0.05). We evaluated RFS according to\nthe histologic differentiation of the GC. G3 NEC\nhad poorer RFS than well-differentiated, moder-\nately differentiated or poorly differentiated GC\n(Figure 3a\u00adc, p < 0.05). However, the RFS was\nsimilar to that of SRC GC (Figure 3d, p < 0.05).\nWe also evaluated RFS according to TNM stage.\nIn stage I, G3 NEC and the mixed type had poorer\nsurvival than GC (p < 0.05), but there was no dif-\nference in RFS between G3 NEC and mixed type\n(p > 0.05). In stage IIa, G3 NEC had poorer sur-\nvival than the other two groups (p < 0.05), but\nthere was no difference in RFS between G3 NEC\nand mixed type and between mixed type and GC\n(p > 0.05). In stage IIb, IIIa, IIIb or IIIc there was\nno difference in RFS between any groups (p <\n0.05). Therefore, we divided the stages into two\ngroups: stage I and IIa in group 1; and stage IIb\nthrough to IIIc in group 2. The G3 NEC in group\n1 had poorer survival than the mixed type and GC\n(Figure 4a, p < 0.05), and there was no difference\nin survival between mixed type and GC (p > 0.05).\nIn group 2 there was no difference in RFS between\nDiscussion\nThe WHO and ENET grading systems according\nto Ki-67 index/mitosis have been validated for the\nforegut and particularly for pancreatic neuroen-\ndocrine neoplasm (NEN)s (PanNENs), and their\nbiological relevance and power to discriminate\nFigure 1.

In contrast, ENET\nTNM stage is uniform for all gastric NET or\nNEC, unlike GC TNM stage. In this study we\nevaluated the TNM stage uniformly according to\nthe AJCC (7th edition) definitions of GC, NEC,\nand adenocarcinoma with NET.\nGastric NET frequently contains an adenocarci-\nnoma component [Waldum et al. 1998; Nishikura\net al. 2003], and it has been proposed that gastric\nNET is derived predominantly from endocrine\nprecursor cell clones arising in earlier adenocarci-\nnoma components that transform into endocrine\ntumors during rapid clonal expansion [Nishikura\net al. 2003]. A category of mixed adeno-neuroen-\ndocrine carcinoma (MANEC) was recently pro-\nposed on the grounds that WHO 2010 did not\ndefine cases with both neuroendocrine and\nnon-neuroendocrine components [La Rosa et al.\n2012]. In addition, there are no studies that sup-\nport the 30% rule for the definition of MANEC.\nThus, WHO 2010 classification is likely to be cor-\nrect in the light of the evidence for the MANEC\ndefinition [Rindi et al. 2014]. Kim and colleagues\nreported that the neuroendocrine features of GC\nappeared to be correlated with clinicopathologic\nparameters such as high stage and high frequency\nof regional lymph node metastasis [Kim et al.\n2011]. In our study, we could not establish the\nexact proportions of each component. Therefore,\nwe defined NETs with any proportions of adeno-\ncarcinoma as a mixed type.\nRecently, Park and colleagues evaluated the clin-\nicopathologic features of GCs with neuroendo-\ncrine differentiation (NED) and found no\nsignificant difference in the survival rate between\nNEC and GC with 10\u00ad30% of NED [Park et al.\n2014]. They therefore proposed that GCs with\n10% NED should be differentiated from con-\nventional adenocarcinomas. They also recom-\nmended that the 10% NED cut-off may be\nuseful in practice and may serve as an informative\nparameter for predicting patient outcomes and\nestablishing optimal therapeutic guidelines for\nGCs with NED.\nSeveral studies have already shown that NEC of\nthe stomach has a poor prognosis [La Rosa et al.\nreports that have evaluated the prognostic signifi-\ncance of neuroendocrine components of GC\ntion, Kim and colleagues reported that the small\ncell type of gastric NECs did not have such\nextreme behavior [Kim et al. 2013], and Kubota\nand colleagues reported that early detection and\ncurative operations are essential for improving the\nprognosis of gastric NEC [Kubota et al. 2012].\nOur study has the following limitations. NETs of\nthe stomach are very rare; therefore, the statistical\npower of this study was limited by the relatively\nsmall number of patients. Recently, WHO 2010\nFigure 4. Kaplan\u00adMeier survival curves for RFS. (a) AJCC stage I or IIa. (b) AJCC stage IIb or IIIa\u00adc.\nG3 NEC, WHO grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinoma; GC, gastric carcinoma.\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(5)\n414 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\ndefined MANEC as requiring >30% of each\ncomponent. However, as mentioned above, we\ncould not determine the exact proportions of the\ncomponents, so we defined NETs with any por-\ntion of adenocarcinoma as mixed type. Another\nweakness is the lack of data on the expression of\nneuroendocrine markers in the control group. In\naddition, various adjuvant chemotherapy regi-\nmens were administered for patients in each type\nof tumor and the regimens differed widely among\nsubgroups. Our study may also be prone to selec-\ntion bias because the patients were selected\naccording to the following criteria: availability of\nentire specimen, blood samples, full follow-up\nrecords, and records of genetic analysis.\nIn conclusion, even though the number of patients\nwith GC NEC was very small and different adju-\nvant chemotherapy regimens were administered,\nour results show that G3 NEC has a worse prog-\nnosis than GC. G3 NEC tumors that invade only\nas far as the muscularis propria have poorer RFS\nthan the corresponding cases of GC, while those\nthat invade the subserosa or deeper have similar\nRFS to GC. Therefore, non-advanced G3 NEC\nof the stomach requires more aggressive treat-\nment and surveillance than does GC, excluding\nthe SRC type.\nEthical standards\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with\nthe ethical standards of the responsible commit-\ntee on human experimentation (institutional and\nnational) and with the Helsinki Declaration of\n1964 and later versions.
