This gap persists even after ac-\ncounting for observable factors, such as personal and parental characteristics. In contrast, controlling for the\ninfluence of unobservable factors potentially correlated with smoking behavior and depression produces smaller\nestimates. For instance, estimates from a linear regression model augmented with fixed effects suggest that the\nthan his nonsmoking counterpart; the average female smoker is predicted to score 1.25 points higher on the CES-D\nScale (95% confidence interval: 0.75, 1.75) than her nonsmoking counterpart. The authors conclude that, for the\naverage adolescent, the association between smoking and the symptoms of depression can in large part be\nattributed to the influence of unobservable factors.\nadolescent; depression; health; smoking\nAbbreviations: CES-D, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio.\nMany studies have documented a strong association be-\ntween smoking and depression (1\u00ad8). Two explanations\nhave traditionally been proposed for this association (9).\nThe first is that depression leads to smoking, perhaps be-\ncause depressed individuals turn to cigarettes as a means of\nself-medication; the second is that underlying environmen-\ntal or genetic factors predispose individuals to both smoking\nand depression.\nRecently, however, a third explanation for the association\nbetween smoking and depression has been proposed, namely,\nthat smoking itself leads to emotional disturbances (10\u00ad12).\nThis explanation is supported by a number of influential\nstudies on teenagers and, if true, would have enormous im-\nplications both because the treatment and consequences of\ndepression are so costly, and because policymakers would\nhave a potentially powerful tool to reduce the incidence of\na widespread illness.\nPrevious researchers in this area have shown that teens\nwho smoke are at increased risk of subsequently developing\nthe symptoms of depression (10, 11). This association, how-\never, could be driven by unobserved (from the standpoint\nof the researcher) factors having to do with the home envi-\nronment or with an individual's genetic makeup. In order\nto explore the role played by difficult-to-measure environ-\nmental and genetic influences potentially correlated with\nboth smoking and depression, we compare estimates from\nstandard regression models, which can be thought of as pro-\nviding ``nai\n\u00a8ve'' estimates of the effect of smoking on de-\npression, with fixed effects estimates that completely\ncontrol for time-invariant factors.\nThe primary data source for this project is the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the same data\nsource used by Goodman and Capitman (11) in their influ-\nential study on this topic.

Eighty high schools were chosen from\nthis population, and an additional 52 middle or ``feeder''\nschools from the same communities were included in the\nstudy. Any student who appeared on the roster of one of\nthese 132 schools was eligible to participate in the Adoles-\ncent Health wave I (baseline) in-home survey. The wave\nI in-home interviews were conducted primarily between\nMay and September of 1995 and produced a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of students aged 11\u00ad21 years in grades\n7 through 12. Wave II (follow-up) in-home interviews were\nconducted between April and August of the following year.\nThe mean period between baseline and follow-up interviews\nWe analyze data from the wave I and wave II in-home\nsurveys. These surveys contain good measures of tobacco\nuse and depressive symptomatology, as well as personal\ncharacteristics, family background variables, and a large ar-\nray of contextual variables that pertain to a respondent's\ncounty and state of residence. To address data confidentially\nand security issues and to minimize the potential for inter-\nviewer or parental influence, respondents entered their\nanswers on a laptop computer. For particularly sensitive\nquestions, the respondent listened to prerecorded questions\nthrough earphones and then directly entered the answers. Of\nthe 18,924 respondents in the wave I in-home weighed sam-\nple, 13,569 were reinterviewed at follow-up. An additional\n501 observations were lost because of missing data (table 1).\nMeasures\nTo assess cigarette consumption, the Adolescent Health\nsurvey included the questions, ``[d]uring the past 30 days, on\nhow many days did you smoke cigarettes?'' and ``[d]uring\nthe past 30 days, on the days that you smoked, how many\ncigarettes did you smoke each day?'' Packs of cigarettes\nsmoked in the past month were calculated as the product\nof the answers to these two questions, divided by 20 (11).\nA little more than a quarter of the sample (25.3 percent of\nmales and 25.8 percent of females) smoked at baseline. By\nfollow-up, a little over a third of the sample smoked (33.4\npercent of males and 33.9 percent of females). These data\nare consistent with those from other nationally representa-\ntive surveys of adolescent smoking from the mid-1990s\n(15). Male smokers at baseline consumed, on average,\n9.33 packs per month, while female smokers consumed,\non average, 7.74 packs per month.\nTo assess depressive symptomatology, the Adolescent\nHealth in-home survey included 18 of the 20 items that\nmake up the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression\n(CES-D) Scale (16). For instance, respondents were asked\nhow often during the past week they were ``bothered by\nthings that usually don't bother you,'' how often did they\nnot ``feel like eating,'' and how often did they feel ``like you\ncouldn't shake off the blues even with help from your family\nor your friends?'' (The two missing items from the CES-D\nquestionnaire were ``my sleep was restless'' and ``I had\ncrying spells.'') Each response was coded on a scale of\n0\u00ad3 based on frequency (0 \u00bc rarely or none of the time;\n1 \u00bc some or a little of the time; 2 \u00bc occasionally or a mod-\nerate amount of the time; and 3 \u00bc most or all of the time),\nand adding up these responses produced a score of between\nson of our results with those of previous researchers, we\nrescaled this score to correspond with the 20-item CES-D\nScale (11). Thus, respondents could be assigned a CES-D\nscore of between 0 and 60, with higher numbers indicating\nthe presence of more depressive symptoms.\nThe primary focus of the present study is not on depres-\nsion per se but on its symptoms as measured by the CES-D\nScale. Accordingly, the CES-D score is initially treated as\na continuous variable. However, previous work has shown\nthat a dichotomized version of the CES-D Scale can be used\nas a screening instrument for depression in an adolescent\npopulation, provided that appropriate cutpoints are chosen\n(17). Using the cutpoints of Goodman and Capitman (11),\nwe present additional analyses in which the CES-D score is\ndichotomized.\nStatistical models\nWe begin our study by estimating the effect of smoking\non depressive symptomatology using a standard linear re-\ngression framework in which the CES-D score of individual\ni at follow-up (t \u00bc 2) is related to a set of observable factors\nand smoking behavior at baseline (t \u00bc 1) by the following\nequation:\n\u00feei; t\u00bc2; i \u00bc 1; ...; n;\nwhere si, t\u00bc1\nis a dichotomous variable equal to one for\nyouth who smoked at least one cigarette in the 30 days prior\nto the baseline interview; ppmi, t\u00bc1\nis a measure of smoking\nintensity equal to the number of cigarettes smoked in the 30\ndays prior to the baseline interview, divided by 20; Xi, t\u00bc1\nis\na vector of controls that includes measures of age, disability\nstatus, personal and household characteristics, parental ed-\nucation, and a set of county-level variables; and ei, t\u00bc2\nis\na random error term. The parameter p1\nrepresents the effect\nof baseline smoking participation on the CES-D score at\nfollow-up (controlling for the variables included in the vec-\ntor Xi, t\u00bc1\nrepresents the effect of smoking an ad-\nditional pack per month.\nEstimating equation 1 using ordinary least squares will\nproduce unbiased estimates of p1\nif the error term,\n, is uncorrelated with smoking behavior. However, if\nunobservable environmental or genetic factors are corre-\nlated with both the CES-D score at follow-up and smoking\nbehavior, then ordinary least squares estimates will be bi-\nased. Furthermore, because the baseline CES-D score is not\nincluded as an explanatory variable in equation 1, this ap-\nproach is subject to a problem of reverse causality: That is,\nif preexisting depression leads to smoking at baseline, then\nit is inappropriate to interpret ordinary least squares esti-\nmates of p1\nas the effect of smoking on depressive\nsymptomatology.\nWe address these problems by taking fuller advantage of\nthe longitudinal nature of the Adolescent Health data by\nTABLE 1.

There are 18,924 adolescents in the weighted baseline in-home\nsurvey. Of these, 13,569 were reinterviewed at follow-up. An additional 501 observations were lost because of\nmissing information on smoking habits, CES-D score, age, or county data. The smoker variables are dichotomous\nand equal to one for youth who smoked at least one cigarette in the 30 days prior to being interviewed and zero\notherwise. The packs-per-month variables are equal to the number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days divided\nby 20. The variable, disability, is dichotomous and equal to one for youth that indicated in the baseline interview that\nthey have difficulty using their hands, arms, legs, or feet because of a permanent physical condition and zero\notherwise. The variables White, Black, and other race are dichotomous, mutually exclusive, and based on a series of\nquestions from the baseline in-home interview. Hispanic is a dichotomous variable equal to one for youth who self-\nidentified as being of Hispanic origin and zero otherwise. The household variables are also dichotomous and come\nfrom the questionnaire completed by the respondent's parent/caregiver at baseline. The two-parent home variable\nindicates that the parent/caregiver who completed the Adolescent Health parent survey lived with a spouse or\npartner at the baseline interview. The welfare variable is equal to one if the parent/caregiver who completed the\nAdolescent Health parent survey receives public assistance and zero otherwise. The alcoholic parent variable is\nequal to one if either biologic parent currently suffers from alcoholism according to the baseline parent survey and\nzero otherwise. The parental education variables are dichotomous, mutually exclusive, and based on the responses\npertaining to the best-educated parent/caregiver living in the household. The county controls are taken from the\nAdolescent Health contextual files. The unemployment variable is the county unemployment rate. The rural and\nurban variables are the fraction of the county's population that resides in urbanized or rural areas, respectively.\ny CES-D, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression; SD, standard deviation.\nEffect of Smoking on Depressive Symptomatology 463\nmodifying equation 1 to include individual-specific inter-\ncepts, often called ``fixed effects'' (18). These fixed effects,\ndenoted mi\n, are incorporated into equation 1 as:\nCES-Di; t \u00bc a\u00febXi; t \u00fep1si; t \u00fep2ppmi; t\n\u00femi \u00feei; t; \u00f02\u00de\nEach respondent i contributes two observations to the esti-\nmation of this model, one from the baseline survey (t \u00bc 1)\nand the other from the follow-up survey (t \u00bc 2). Only the\nwithin-person variation is used to estimate the parameters of\nequation 2. All time-invariant factors (such as preexisting\ndepression, basic personality traits, and family background)\nare controlled for by the fixed effects (18). However, fixed\neffects do not control for omitted time-variant factors, such\nas the respondent's emotional state. If the correlation be-\ntween smoking and CES-D scores is driven in part by\ndifficult-to-measure factors that vary between the baseline\nand follow-up interviews, then this estimation strategy is\nlikely to produce an upper-bound estimate of the effect of\nsmoking on depressive symptomatology.\nThe fixed effects approach can also be used when the\ndependent variable is dichotomous. Following previous re-\nsearch, we create a high depressive symptomatology vari-\nable that is equal to one for youth scoring above a cutpoint\non the CES-D Scale, and zero otherwise (11). The cutpoint\nfor females is 24; for males, the cutpoint is 22. The logistic\nmodel is derived by assuming that the probability that re-\nspondent i scores above the cutpoint at the follow-up in-\nterview takes the following form:\nexp\u00f0bXi; t\u00bc1 \u00fepsi; t\u00bc1\u00de\n; i \u00bc 1; ...; n; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere Xi, t\u00bc1\nand Si, t\u00bc1\nare defined as they are in equation 1.\nSolving equation 3 leads to the log odds ratio:\nlog\n \n\u00bc bXi; t\u00bc1 \u00fepsi; t\u00bc1; i \u00bc 1; ...; n: \u00f04\u00de\nThe parameter p represents the effect of baseline smoking\nparticipation on the follow-up log odds ratio (controlling for\nthe variables included in the vector Xi, t\u00bc1\n).

One solution is to once again take ad-\nvantage of the longitudinal nature of the Adolescent Health\ndata by modifying equation 4 to include individual-specific\nintercepts. Including individual fixed effects in the logistic\nmodel leads to a log odds ratio of the following form:\nlog\nPi; t\n \n\u00bc mi \u00febXi; t \u00fepsi; t;\nIn general, fixed effects binary choice models suffer from the\nincidental parameters problem (19). However, Chamberlain\n(19) shows that the parameters b and p in equation 6 can be\nestimated, without the need to estimate mi\n, by maximizing\nthe conditional log likelihood function (19):\nlog L \u00bc\nX\nn\nAi log\nexp\u00f0zi; t\u00bc2\u00de\nexp\u00f0zi; t\u00bc1\u00de\u00feexp\u00f0zi; t\u00bc2\u00de\n \n\n\u00fe Bi log\nexp\u00f0zi; t\u00bc1\u00de\nexp\u00f0zi; t\u00bc1\u00de\u00feexp\u00f0zi; t\u00bc2\u00de\n \n;\nwhere zi, t\nis defined as it is in equation 5; Ai\nindicator variable equal to one if i is nondepressed at base-\nline and depressed at follow-up; and Bi\ndicator variable equal to one if i is depressed at baseline and\nnondepressed at follow-up.

Depression has also been linked\nto an increased likelihood of substance use, including alco-\nhol, marijuana, and cocaine (2, 5, 26). Many of these factors\nare potentially causes, as opposed to consequences, of emo-\ntional disturbances among teens, but the possibility that\ntobacco use leads to depression has, to date, received the\nmost attention. Although nobody is certain of the physio-\nlogic mechanism, nicotine exposure has been cited as a pos-\nsible culprit because nicotine has been shown to influence\nthe ``neurochemical systems that may play an etiologic role\nin MD [major depression]'' (6, p. 36). For instance, there is\nevidence that nicotine leads to impaired serotonin function\namong individuals who have been diagnosed with a depres-\nsive disorder (27). In addition, there has been speculation\nthat smoking may increase the likelihood of developing\nanxiety disorders by reducing oxygen flow to the brain (12).\nIf it could be confirmed that smoking is a contributing\nfactor to depression in a causal sense, this would represent\nan important step toward identifying the physical process\nthat produces depression. Moreover, it could provide useful\ninformation to policymakers and health specialists inter-\nested in reversing the upswing in youth smoking that oc-\ncurred during the 1990s. According to data from national\nsurveys such as the Monitoring the Future survey, the in-\ncidence of smoking among high school students grew dra-\nsuggested that recent increases in the price of cigarettes\nmay have the effect of reversing this upward trend (15). If\nincreases in the price of cigarettes also have the effect of\nreducing depression among high school students, this would\nbe welcome news indeed.\nPrevious research in this area clearly indicates that ado-\nlescents who smoke are at higher risk of subsequently\ndeveloping the symptoms of depression (10, 11). This asso-\nciation, however, could be driven by underlying influences\nrelated to the home environment or an individual's genetic\npredisposition to depression. Previous researchers have typ-\nically examined the predictors of adolescent smoking in\norder to rule out this possibility. For instance, Goodman\nand Capitman (11), using data from the Adolescent Health\nstudy, found that teens with CES-D scores above a certain\ncutpoint were no more likely to start smoking than were\nteens below the cutpoint. However, Goodman and Capitman\nincluded a number of covariates in their model that may\nindicate depression (e.g., grade point average, alcohol use,\nprevious smoking, measures of delinquency and self-esteem,\nand parental perceptions of the respondent's behavior). If\none is interested in ruling out the possibility that depression\naffects whether a teen takes up smoking, then it is inappro-\npriate to control for potential indicators of depression.\nThe results of the present study confirm that smokers tend\nto exhibit more symptoms of depression than do non-\nsmokers. Female respondents to the Adolescent Health sur-\nvey who smoked at baseline scored, on average, 3.31 points\nhigher on the CES-D Scale at follow-up than did their non-\nsmoking counterparts. Male smokers scored, on average,\n3.11 points higher on the CES-D Scale at follow-up than\ndid their nonsmoking counterparts.\nAlthough observable factors, such as personal and paren-\ntal characteristics, have been shown to be important predic-\ntors of adolescent depressive symptoms (28\u00ad33), they do not\nfully explain these differences. In fact, when age, race,\nhousehold variables, parental education, urban/rural status,\nand the county-level unemployment rate are controlled for\nin a linear regression framework, the average female is pre-\ndicted to score 3.39 points higher on the CES-D Scale than\nis her nonsmoking counterpart. The average male smoker is\npredicted to score 2.90 points higher on the CES-D Scale\nthan is his nonsmoking counterpart.\nIn contrast, controlling for unobservable factors dramat-\nically reduces the estimated effect of smoking. After the\naddition of fixed effects to the linear regression model, the\naverage female smoker is predicted to score 1.25 points\nhigher on the CES-D Scale than is her nonsmoking coun-\nterpart, while the average male smoker is predicted to score\n0.84 points higher on the CES-D Scale than is his nonsmok-\ning counterpart. These estimates suggest that smoking has,\nat most, an extremely modest impact on depressive symp-\ntomatology. To put them in perspective, it might be noted\nthat, if a respondent changed his or her answer from\n``rarely'' to ``some of the time'' on only one of the 18 items\nthat make up the Adolescent Health version of the CES-D\nScale, this would result in an increase of 2.2 points in his or\nher score.\nTABLE 7. Odds ratios from fixed effects logistic regression\nresults showing the effect of smoking on high depressive\nsymptomatology, by gender, National Longitudinal Study of\nMales Females\nOdds\nratio\nconfidence\ninterval\nOdds\nratio\nconfidence\ninterval\nLikelihood ratio\n* The dichotomous dependent variable is equal to one for\nindividuals scoring above the depression cutpoint on the Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and zero otherwise. The\ncutpoints are 22 for males and 24 for females. Each respondent\ncontributes two observations to the estimation of this model (one from\nthe baseline survey and the other from the follow-up survey). Age is\nnot captured by the individual fixed effects, because the time\nbetween the baseline and follow-up interviews was not uniform\nacross respondents. All other baseline control variables are absorbed\nby the individual fixed effects.\nYet there is reason to believe that even these modest\nestimates might overstate the effect of smoking on depres-\nsive symptoms. If a physiologic link indeed exists between\nsmoking and the subsequent development of depression,\nthen it would be reasonable to expect that evidence of this\nlink would become more pronounced as the number of cig-\narettes consumed increases. In fact, we find very little evi-\ndence that smoking intensity (as measured by packs smoked\nper month) is related to the depressive symptomatology of\nsmokers. After the addition of fixed effects to the linear\nregression model, smoking an extra pack of cigarettes per\nmonth is associated with a 0.02 increase in male CES-D\nscores, an estimate that is small relative to the impact of\nparticipation and statistically indistinguishable from zero.\nFor females, smoking an extra pack of cigarettes per month\nis associated with a statistically insignificant 0.01 increase\nin CES-D scores.\nIt is difficult to reconcile these estimates with the notion\nthat smoking causes depression, although it is possible that\nsmoking has different effects depending on the level of de-\npressive symptomatology. The linear regression model, with\nor without fixed effects, produces estimates of the impact of\nsmoking on the mean CES-D score. In contrast, previous\nresearchers have focused on whether respondents scored\nabove a cutpoint set at a value greater than the mean (3, 8,\n11). For instance, Goodman and Capitman (11) investigated\nthe impact of smoking on ``high depressive symptomatol-\nogy'' with cutpoints set at approximately the 90th percentile\nof the CES-D distribution.\nUsing the cutpoints of Goodman and Capitman, we in-\nvestigated the relation between smoking participation and\na dichotomized version of the CES-D Scale. In order to keep\nour results comparable with those of previous researchers\nwho used logistic modeling, smoking intensity is not in-\ncluded as a predictor of scoring above the cutpoints. This\napproach is consistent with our finding that smoking inten-\nsity is unrelated to the CES-D.\nFor males, the logistic results are in keeping with those\ndiscussed above. That is, controlling for observable charac-\nteristics, such as age, race, and parental education, has little\nimpact on the estimated effect of smoking, but adding fixed\neffects to the standard logistic model produces an estimated\nodds ratio that is statistically indistinguishable from unity.\nFor females, we find that logistic modeling produces sim-\nilar estimates with or without fixed effects. According to the\nstandard logistic model estimates, the odds of scoring above\nthe cutpoint are 2.19 times greater for female smokers than\nfor their nonsmoking counterparts. Adding fixed effects re-\nduces the estimated odds ratio to 1.79.\nGiven this latter result, we cannot rule out the possibility\nthat smoking has an effect on the likelihood that female\nadolescents exhibit high levels of depressive symptomatol-\nogy. However, as noted in Materials and Methods, adding\nfixed effects produces what is likely to be upper-bound es-\ntimates for the effect of smoking. The true effect of smoking\non the odds that a female adolescent scored above the cut-\npoint used by Goodman and Capitman is probably smaller\nthan that reported.\nThe statistical techniques used in this analysis are de-\nsigned to produce results comparable with what might be\nexpected from a classically designed, randomized experi-\nment. They are, however, subject to a variety of limitations\nto which randomized experiments are not. For instance, the\ninclusion of fixed effects produces unbiased estimates only\nif the unobservables being controlled for are constant with\nrespect to time. Because unobservables are, by definition,\ndifficult to measure or even characterize, this assumption\nremains untested.\nIn addition, including fixed effects does not absolve the\nresearcher from making assumptions with regard to model\nspecification. By exploring the impact of fixed effects in the\ncontext of both linear and nonlinear models, we tested the\nrobustness of our estimates to underlying structural and dis-\ntributional assumptions. Although more work needs to be\ndone in this area, we view our results as evidence of the\nimportant role played by unobservable environmental and\ngenetic factors in the determination of adolescent depres-\nsion. We conclude that, for the average adolescent, the as-\nsociation between smoking and the symptoms of depression\ncan in large part be attributed to the influence of unobserv-\nable factors.\n"
