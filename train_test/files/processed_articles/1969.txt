In the past several years,\nmore attention has been given to implementa-\ntion issues during the various stages of program\ndevelopment and diffusion. This paper presents\nthe findings from a substudy of an evaluation of\na newly designed middle and high school sub-\nstance abuse prevention program, Take Charge\nof Your Life delivered by local Drug Abuse\nResistance Education officer instructors. A key\naspect of the study was to determine the extent\nto which implementation fidelity, using the\nmeasures of content coverage and appropriate\ninstructional strategy, was associated with im-\nprovement in the program mediators of real-\nistic normative beliefs, understanding the\nharmful effects of substance use and the acqui-\nsition of decision-making and resistance skills.\nAlthough it was found that higher fidelity was\nassociated with better scores on some of the\nmediators, this was not a consistent finding.\nThe mixed results are discussed within the con-\ntext of the lesson activities themselves.\n",

Stephens, Richard D. Hawthorney, Jesse Marquettey and Joseph E. Williams\n Introduction\nThe March 2004 issue of Prevention Science in-\ncluded a number of articles based on presentations\ngiven at a conference jointly sponsored by the Na-\ntional Institute on Drug Abuse and the Center for\nSubstance Abuse Prevention entitled, `What Do\nSchools Really Think about Prevention Research?\nBlending Research and Reality' [1]. The authors of\nthese papers listed challenges to the progress of\nprevention science including dissemination and dif-\nfusion of strategies found to be effective through\nrigorous designs and resultant concerns about\nimplementation fidelity and adaptation [2\u00ad4].\nThe concern about implementation fidelity and\nadaptation or reinvention is based on the results\nof national studies which found that evidence- or\nresearch-based programs taken `to scale' at the com-\nmunity level often are not implemented as they were\ndesigned and evaluated. Two recent national studies\nmany schools are meeting mandates to implement\nevidence-based prevention programs, they are not\ndoing so with fidelity. Hallfors and Godette [5]\nfound in their survey of Safe and Drug Free School\nCoordinators, located in 104 school districts in\n12 states, that only 19% were implementing curric-\nulum with fidelity. In another study of staff who\ntaught substance abuse prevention in a nationally\nrepresentative sample of 1795 public and private\nschools, Ennett et al. [6] found that 62.2% taught\neffective content which included social influence or\ncomprehensive life skills materials and activities\nand 17.4% used effective interactive delivery meth-\nods. Only 14.2% reported using effective content\nmaterials, activities and delivery methods [6].\nInstitute for Health and Social Policy, The University of\n*Correspondence to: Z. Sloboda.

Tobler and Stratton [9] sug-\ngest that decreases in the effect sizes they found in\ntheir meta-analysis of school-based substance\nabuse prevention programs taken to scale may\nbe due to implementation issues. Pentz and\nTrebow [10] found that children exposed to a pro-\ngram delivered by instructors who maintained\nhigh implementation fidelity had better outcomes\nthan those exposed to the program delivered by\ninstructors who implemented the program with\nlow fidelity. Furthermore, children exposed to\nthe program delivered by low implementers had\nbetter outcomes than children in the control con-\ndition. Botvin et al. [11] found that children\nwho experienced 60% of the program had better\noutcomes compared with the control children.\nHansen et al. [12] found that program integrity\n(the term used for fidelity) was significantly re-\nlated to three of seven program mediators for a re-\nsistance skills program. While in a later pilot study\nof the All Stars Community Program, Hansen\net al. [13] found that instruction with higher pro-\ngram fidelity had better outcomes.\nAs the field of prevention continues to dis-\nseminate theory- and research-based interventions,\nthe combined issues of fidelity and reinvention\nwill become increasingly important. However, as\nDusenbury et al. [14] emphasize, although the field\nhas fair agreement on the definition of fidelity (`.\nthe degree to which teachers and other program\nproviders implement programs as intended by the\nprogram developers'. p. 240), there does not appear\nto be consensus regarding the specific dimensions\nof fidelity nor of their measurements. The authors\nlist the five most frequently mentioned definitions\nas `. (1) strict adherence to methods or implemen-\ntation that conforms to theoretical guidelines ., (2)\ncompleteness and dosage of implementation, (3)\nthe quality of program delivery (the way a teacher\nimplements a program), (4) the degree to which\nparticipants are engaged and (5) program differen-\ntiation (the degree to which elements which would\ndistinguish one type of program from another are\npresent or absent)' (p. 240). As variable as the def-\ninitions of fidelity are, their measures remain even\nIt is appropriate to point out that assessing\nimplementation fidelity or adherence to the design\nand intent of an intervention is important during\nevery phase of development from efficacy trials\nthrough to replication studies to assure that the\nresearch results can be related to the intervention\nand not to other factors. The most effective pre-\nventive interventions available today are based\non strong theoretical or conceptual frameworks.\nThese frameworks specify not only the targets\nfor the intervention such as normative beliefs or\nskills building but also the processes and mecha-\nnisms through which participants of the interven-\ntion integrate and internalize desired attitudes and\nbehaviors. Of particular importance is measuring\nthe degree to which a newly developed interven-\ntion achieves both short- and long-term objectives\nas through mediational analyses and to assess ad-\nherence to delivery style, coverage of materials\nand participant involvement in the intervention\nprocesses. For this reason, for instance, in efficacy\nstudies, investigators control the training and de-\nlivery of the intervention. As one moves along the\ndevelopmental phases to field trials or replication\nstudies, where delivery is less well controlled,\ninvestigators need to assess the extent to which\nthe intervention is delivered as designed, how\nthe deliverer may alter any component of the in-\ntervention and what impact revisions may have on\nthe intervention's outcomes.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present findings\nregarding the association of implementation fidel-\nity and the targeted mediators of a substance\nabuse prevention program, Take Charge of Your\nLife (TCYL) delivered to students when they\nare in the seventh and ninth grades by Drug\nAbuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) officers.\nImplementation fidelity data were collected by\nspecially trained independent observers using\nstandardized forms. Data for the program's tar-\ngeted mediators come from student surveys com-\npleted at seven points in time over the 5-year\nstudy period.\nImplementation fidelity\nBackground\nThe Adolescent Substance Abuse\nPrevention Study\nThe evaluation\nThe Adolescent Substance Abuse Prevention Study\n(ASAPS) funded by the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation and conducted by a research team at\nThe University of Akron is designed to assess the\nimpact of a substance abuse prevention program\nwith components delivered to students when they\nare in the seventh and ninth grades (TCYL). The\nprogram was delivered by D.A.R.E. officers. The\nstudy was conducted in 83 school districts (with 83\nclusters of high schools and their 122 feeder middle\nschools) located in six metropolitan areas (Detroit,\nHouston, Los Angeles, Newark, New Orleans and\nwith a cohort of seventh graders who were surveyed\nthrough the 11th grade year school districts in the\ninner city and other districts within a 50-mile radius\naround the inner city district were randomly se-\nlected and then recruited to participate in the study.\nOnce letters stating agreement to participate in the\nstudy were received from district superintendents,\nschool principals and police departments within the\nrespective jurisdiction, school clusters were ran-\ndomly assigned to receive the TCYL curriculum\nor to continue with the substance abuse prevention\nprogram in place in their school, to provide a new\nprogram or not to provide any program at all. Forty-\ntwo high schools and their 63 feeder middle schools\nwere assigned to the control condition while 41\nhigh schools and their 59 feeder middle schools\nwere assigned to the treatment condition. At base-\nline, 19 200 seventh graders with positive parental\nconsents and student assents (56.3% of those con-\nsidered eligible from school rosters at the beginning\nschools and 8082 attended the control schools.\nStudents completed self-administered surveys in\na classroom setting at seven time points: at baseline,\nafter the seventh grade intervention in the treatment\nschools and ;60 to 90 days after the baseline sur-\nvey in the control schools, ;1 year later when stu-\ndents were in the eighth grade, prior to and after the\ndelivery of the ninth grade TCYL curriculum in\nthe treatment schools and about the same time in\nthe control schools, ;1 year later when students\nwere in the 10th grade and, finally, when students\nwere in the 11th grade. All surveys were adminis-\ntered by the research staff; no school personnel or\nD.A.R.E. officer instructors were present during sur-\nvey administration.\nThe curriculum\nTCYL draws heavily from both education and sub-\nstance abuse prevention research and emphasizes\nnormative beliefs about the prevalence and social\nacceptability of the use of tobacco, alcohol, inha-\nlants, marijuana and other drugs (ATOD); the per-\nceptions of the consequences associated with the\nuse of these substances and the acquisition of social\nskills including communication skills, decision-\nmaking skills and resistance strategies. The pro-\ngram is designed to address ATOD use through\na series of scenarios representing problem situations\nwhich were drawn from focus groups of middle and\nhigh school students. The seventh grade curriculum\nconsists of 10 lessons and the ninth grade curricu-\nlum includes seven lessons.\nThe program content is intertwined throughout\nthe lessons to help students form an understanding\nof the risks involved when substances are used,\nparticularly by young people whose bodies and\nbrains are still developing. The lesson content also\nsupports students' understanding that most adoles-\ncents do not use ATOD on a regular basis and\nprovides opportunities for students to practice the\nsocial and communication skills that enable them to\nresist the use of substances.\nThe program fosters interaction and active learn-\ning through large and small group discussions and\nrole-play to stimulate students to `try on' and think\nthrough problematic situations guided by the\nD.A.R.E. officer instructors. The program's spiral\nstructure allows concepts and skills to be revisited\nthroughout the lessons such that the skills are in-\ntroduced, revisited and practiced in increasingly\nmore complex problem situations.\nZ. Sloboda et al.\nHomework is provided so that students can fur-\nther refine the skills and understandings being de-\nveloped in the classroom and to keep parents fully\ninformed about the lessons and their students'\nwork. Follow-up in-class sessions weave the home-\nwork and class activities into a meaningful se-\nquence of learning activities.\nTraining of instructors\nThe training of instructors to understand, to em-\nbrace and to teach the seventh grade curriculum\noccurred in the fall of 2001 and for the ninth grade\ncurriculum in late August of 2003. Officers who\nparticipated in the training consisted of D.A.R.E.\nofficers who were available to serve the study\nschool districts. In a few instances where local\nlaw enforcement agencies did not have a D.A.R.E.\nprogram, D.A.R.E. officers were recruited from\nnearby agencies. The study paid for all travel\nexpenses associated with the training. Salaries for\nthe D.A.R.E. officers during training were paid by\ntheir local agencies or by D.A.R.E. America. There\nwere a total of six 3-day sessions with 67 officers\nreceiving training for the seventh grade curriculum\nand three 3-day sessions with 73 officers in training\nfor the ninth grade curriculum. Instructors were\ngiven a curriculum manual which included not only\nthe curriculum but also the information and resour-\nces covering tobacco, alcohol and other drugs and\ntheir effects and describing the purpose, rationale,\nas well as developmental criteria of the curriculum.\nIn addition, training consisted of teaching each of\nthe lessons, demonstrating how to teach the lessons\nand practicing the lessons in a simulated setting\nwith fellow officers serving as `students'. All offi-\ncers had been trained previously by D.A.R.E.\nAmerica in the D.A.R.E. elementary curriculum\nand all officers signed consent forms agreeing to\nbeing observed in the classroom.\nThe principal philosophy of the training was that\nofficers would best understand and be able to teach\nthe program if they had ample opportunities to have\nsignificant dialog about the design of the curricu-\nlum and content of each lesson, to observe demon-\nstrations by colleagues as to how the lessons are\nintended to be taught and to teach each of the les-\nsons and receive instructive feedback about their\nteaching.\nCareful planning and instruction were taken into\nconsideration when training the instructors as the\nnew curriculum, TCYL, employs instructional\nstrategies which are quite different from those em-\nphasized by D.A.R.E. America in prior curricula.\nThe officers were being asked to make a switch\nfrom a curriculum which required a more didactic\napproach to one more highly interactive, from one\nwhich was instructor focused to being student fo-\ncused and to one which allows time to practice and\nmaster resistance skills. Moreover, the curriculum\nteam emphasized the importance of understanding\nthe curriculum design and theory to be effective\ninstructors of this new curriculum.\nAs the curriculum design and structure were key\ncomponents to the success of the program, a sub-\nstudy was incorporated into the evaluation to assess\nthe extent to which the officer instructors imple-\nmented the program as they were trained to do.\nThere was particular concern regarding the high\nreliance on interactive and constructivist instruc-\ntional style which was counter to the officer instruc-\ntors' prior training and experience that was less\ninteractive [23]. In addition, the research staff and\ncurriculum developers wanted to know if there was\nan association between fidelity of implementation\nand achievement of the aims of each lesson.\nMethods\nImplementation fidelity study\nIn the ASAPS, fidelity included multiple dimen-\nsions including content coverage, use of appropri-\nate instructional strategy, the expected responsive\nbehaviors of the students and time on task. For this\npaper, the focus will be on content coverage and\nuse of appropriate instructional strategy. The de-\ncision to focus on these measures is in part guided\nby the findings from studies discussed above by\nHallfors and Ennett and their colleagues that\naddressed content and use of interactive instruc-\ntional methods.\nImplementation fidelity\nIn this paper, we utilize the observation data\nfrom the substudy above and data from student\nsurveys to address the following two questions:\n(i) to what extent do the officer instructors cover\nall the material and activities in the program lessons\nand use the appropriate instructional strategies to\ndeliver the lesson components and (ii) do students\nexposed to officer instructors who deliver the les-\nson content with fidelity and who adhere to the\nappropriate instructional strategies have better\nscores on the lesson mediators than those who are\nexposed to officer instructors with lower levels of\nfidelity and adherence.\nSample\nAlthough 140 officers were trained to deliver the\nnew curricula, 86 officers actually taught TCYL. Of\nthese, 58 taught the seventh grade curriculum and\n61 taught the ninth grade curriculum. Thirty-three\nofficers taught both the seventh and ninth grade\ncurricula. At the end of training, officers were asked\nto complete an anonymous training assessment\nform which measured the extent to which they were\nready to teach the curriculum. The latter form con-\nsisted of statements regarding the quality of their\ntraining and level of preparedness to teach the new\ncurricula. Each statement was followed by a five-\npoint Likert scale. The statements were (i) I under-\nstand the purpose of the curriculum, (ii) I feel ready\nto use the teaching strategies, (iii) I believe that the\ncontent of the lessons will help prevent substance\nabuse among adolescents, (iv) I believe that most\nstudents will become involved in the activities of\nthe lessons, (v) I believe the training was effective,\n(vi) I am enthusiastic about this curriculum and (vii)\nthe trainers were knowledgeable.\nOfficer instructors who taught the curriculum\n(n = 86) had an average age of 40 and were more\nmean number of years as a police officer was 14.6\nyears and as a D.A.R.E. officer was 6.0 years. These\nfindings are consistent with the profile of D.A.R.E.\nofficers reported in a paper by Merrill et al. [24]. It\nis interesting to note that 36% of the officers had\ntaught a prevention program other than a D.A.R.E.\ncurriculum and 27.8% had some graduate level\ncourses in education.\nAfter completing the training to deliver the sev-\nenth grade curriculum, 96% of the officer instruc-\ntors agreed that they understood the purpose of the\ncurriculum, and the same percentage indicated that\nthey felt ready to use the teaching strategies pre-\nsented during training. Ninety-two percent of them\nbelieved that the content of the curriculum would\nprevent/reduce substance use among middle and\nhigh school students, and 96% indicated that they\nbelieved most students would get involved in the\nactivities. Ninety-four percent agreed that the train-\ning was effective, and 96% agreed that they were\nenthusiastic about teaching the new curriculum.\nSimilarly, 94% thought the trainers were prepared\nand knowledgeable.\nAfter the training for the ninth grade curriculum,\n97% of officer instructors agreed that they under-\nstood the purpose of the curriculum, and 93% felt\nthey were ready to use the new teaching strategies.\nNinety-three percent thought that the content cov-\nered would prevent/reduce substance use among\nmiddle and high school students, and 97% believed\nthat students would get involved in the activities.\nFurther, 93% of the officer instructors agreed that\nthe training was effective, and 97% felt enthusiastic\nabout teaching the curriculum.\nOnly a few of the officer instructors had prior\nteaching experiences in high school, and many\nexpressed concerns about management of high\nschool students during the ninth grade training.\nHowever, in debriefing interviews with the officer\ninstructors between 6 and 9 months after their ex-\nperiences teaching high school students, >85%\nreported that they enjoyed these older students\nand would teach them again.\nMeasurement and data collection\nContent coverage and instructional strategy\nFor purposes of this study and for consistency with\nthe curriculum design, the dimensions of imple-\nmentation fidelity encompassed content coverage\nand instructional strategy. To measure these com-\nponents, officer instructors were observed in the\nZ. Sloboda et al.\nclassroom. Two key lessons (second and sixth in\nsequence) were selected for observation from the\nseventh grade curriculum because of their focus\nand the different instructional strategies required.\nThe first lesson observed (Lesson 2) includes the\ntypes of activities, didactic instructional strategies\nand level of student engagement similar to the\nD.A.R.E. officers' previous experiences. Con-\nversely, the second lesson observed (Lesson 6) on\nthe other hand focuses on skills building and its\nactivities are more student centered and highly in-\nteractive requiring a different set of instructional\nstrategies and facilitation techniques. These two\nlessons also emphasize key elements of the curric-\nula's theoretical foundation with Lesson 2 focusing\non the effects of drugs on the body and Lesson 6 on\nbuilding decision-making skills.\nFor the ninth grade curriculum, a similar ap-\nproach was taken. The ninth grade curriculum\nwas designed to actively engage students in group\nproblem solving and discussion and heavily focuses\non the current and future consequences of substance\nuse. Again, Lessons 2 and 6 were selected for ob-\nservation. Lesson 2 addresses the effects of mari-\njuana and ecstasy on the brain and in turn on\nemotions and behaviors. In addition, normative\nbeliefs about peer use of these drugs are discussed.\nLesson 6 examines the social and legal consequen-\nces of substance use with a heavy emphasis on\nalcohol use.\nInstructors were observed teaching each of the\ntwo selected lessons twice. The lessons chosen for\nobservation were to be sequential and neither the\nfirst class of instruction nor the last class of instruc-\ntion for that day was observed. Each instructor was\nobserved a total of four times in each observation\nyear. Standardized observation coding sheets were\ncreated for each of the lessons being observed. Be-\ncause of the size and scope of the study in terms of\nschool sites, focus on reliability of coding of obser-\nvations was placed on instrumentation development\nand training of the observers. Two pilot studies\nwere conducted in a total of 13 Ohio middle schools\nwith nine officer instructors and 13 high schools\ndle school students and >700 high school students.\nThe purpose of the pilot studies was to have trained\nOhio D.A.R.E. officer instructors deliver the curric-\nula, to test our consenting procedures and to pre-test\ndata collection instruments including the student\nsurvey and the observation forms for the two se-\nlected lessons. Two observers independently rated\nofficer instructors. On the first round of observa-\ntions, the ease of using the forms was assessed.\nOn the second round, reliability of the instrument\nwas determined. Interrater agreement with two\nraters ranged from 82 to 94% for observation forms\nfor the seventh and ninth grade curricula.\nDuring training for the national study, University-\nemployed observers reviewed the lessons which\nwould be observed. Emphasis was placed on\nnoting what the officer instructors and students\nwere doing during the lesson. The trainees then\nviewed a video of an officer instructor delivering\nthe lessons in a real classroom setting. Their codes\nwere shared and discussed. The training ended with\nanother viewing of the video and codes reviewed.\nTrainees who were outliers were not used to make\nthe observations.\nThe observers recorded for each activity whether\nthe activity and its subactivities were covered, the\namount of time involved with that activity, the\nofficer's instructional strategy (from a check-off\nlist--non-interactive, lecture/listen, ask questions,\ndiscuss, model or facilitate) and the students' be-\nhavior (also from a check-off list--non-interactive,\nlecture, answer questions, discuss, model or prob-\nlem solving). Observers were provided with a defi-\nnition sheet for the instructional strategies with\nexamples of behaviors for each instructional strat-\negy/code. The observers also recorded the number\nof students who were off-task during an activity. In\naddition, they recorded `any interesting, unusual or\nother information which is pertinent to the study'.\nLastly, the observers were asked to rate the instruc-\ntors on the following six questions, using a five-\npoint Likert scale (agree, kind of agree, neutral,\nkind of disagree and disagree): (i) was the instructor\nenthusiastic? (ii) did the students appear to be com-\nfortable talking with the officer? (iii) did the stu-\ndents and the officer smile and laugh while staying\non task? (iv) did the instructor appear to listen\nImplementation fidelity\nattentively? (v) did the officer seem well prepared to\nteach? and (vi) did the students understand the offi-\ncer's directions, explanations and questions. During\ntraining, officers were told about the observations\nand signed consents agreeing to be observed.\nAnalyses were conducted to determine the\nwithin-observer consistency and between-observer\ncorrelation between observations of the lessons for\ncontent coverage and officer instructor instructional\nstrategy. Among these analyses were analyses of\nvariances (ANOVAs) with the observer serving as\na fixed-effect, paired t-tests for the two observations\nand correlations between all observations. There\nwere no significant findings on the ANOVAs and\nthe t-tests, and the correlations were all in the mod-\nerate range indicating that the observers showed no\nsystematic bias in scoring.\nContent coverage was measured by summing the\nnumber of activities and subactivities presented for\neach lesson observed. Items were coded 0, did not\ncover, and 1, covered. Content items were added\ntogether and divided by the total number of activi-\nties to be covered, producing the proportion of ac-\ntivities covered for each lesson. The seventh grade\ncurriculum included 16 content items in Lesson 2\nand 21 content items in Lesson 6 while for the ninth\ngrade, the number of content items was 25 for Les-\nAdherence to appropriate instructional strategy\nwas coded for each activity for each of the lessons\nobserved. First, each activity was scored as to\nwhether it was covered or not. Then, each activity\nwas scored 0 if the officer was non-compliant and 1\nif the officer was compliant, i.e. the officer's in-\nstructional strategy matched the strategy indicated\nin the teaching manual.\nLesson mediators\nThe mediator measures came from the self-admin-\nistered surveys completed by students participating\nin each of the observed classes. For these analyses,\ncomparisons of measures of the targeted mediators\nwere made between the seventh pre- and post-test\nsurveys for the observed seventh grade lessons and\nthe ninth grade pre- and post-test surveys for the\nobserved ninth grade lessons. Students who were in\nclassrooms observed for fidelity were selected and\nmatched to the officer instructor who delivered the\ncurriculum in those students' classrooms. The re-\nlationship of interest is estimated at the classroom\nlevel (seventh grade Lesson2, n = 101 observed clas-\nses; seventh grade Lesson 6, n = 104 observed\nclasses; ninth grade Lesson 2, n = 120 observed clas-\nses and ninth grade Lesson 6, n = 120 observed\nclasses).\nLesson 2 of the seventh grade curriculum for\nTCYL was intended to impact perceptions of the\nconsequences of the use of substances and for Les-\nson 6, decision-making skills while Lesson 2 of the\nninth grade curriculum targeted resistance skills,\nconsequences of substance use and normative\nbeliefs regarding substance use among peers, and\nLesson 6 focused primarily on the social and legal\nconsequences of alcohol use. The questions used to\nmeasure these mediators (described below) were\ntaken from national studies such as the Monitoring\nthe Future Study.\n`Normative beliefs' were measured using two\nscales. The first scale, normative beliefs I, was com-\nputed using the mean of five ordinal items asking\nstudents to estimate how many eighth graders (or in\nthe case of the ninth grade surveys, 10th graders)\nused cocaine, alcohol, tobacco, inhalants or mari-\nranged from one (none) to five (most eighth graders\nused this substance in the prior 30 days). The sec-\nond scale, normative beliefs II (alpha = 0.90), was\nconstructed using the mean of seven items complet-\ning the statement: `Most students my age think it's\nokay to.'. Examples of responses to this statement\ninclude `smoke one or more cigarettes a day' and\n`smoke marijuana once in a while'. Scores range\nfrom one (agreement) to five (disagreement). These\nscales were reverse coded so that higher scores in-\ndicate better program outcomes.\nThe `perceived consequences of substance use'\nmeasure focused on the negative effects of tobacco,\nalcohol and other drugs on the functioning of the\nbrain and perceptions of social consequences as\na result of the use of alcohol. For the former mea-\nsure, we used the mean of five ordinal items asking\nstudents how much they think using a specific drug\nZ. Sloboda et al.\nhas an effect on the functioning of the brain (alpha =\nScores range from one (none) to five (a lot). For\nthe other consequences measure, we asked students\nto respond to six statements measuring negative\nalcohol expectancies such as `If I drank alcohol, I\nmight do things that I wouldn't normally do' and `If\nI drank alcohol, I would get into trouble with\nparents/caregivers'. Response categories were `dis-\nagree, kind of disagree, neither, kind of agree and\nagree'. These items were combined by taking the\nmean across the six items.\n`Knowledge of resistance skills' was measured\nby responses given to three hypothetical scenarios\ninvolving the opportunity to use tobacco, alcohol or\nmarijuana. Students were asked to read a scenario in\nwhich a given substance was offered by a peer and\nto select the most appropriate refusal response to\nthe offer `given the person being offered does not\nwant to use'. Each response was weighted accord-\ning to the level of assertiveness it demonstrated. For\nexample, a response of `no, maybe later' was\nassigned a lower score than a response of `no\nthanks, I don't want to smoke'. Scores ranged from\nzero (least appropriate response) to two (best re-\nsponse chosen) for each scenario and then summed\nfor a final score ranging from zero to six.\n`Decision-making skills' were measured in the\nseventh grade by a single item with a choice of five\nresponses weighted to reflect the level of decision-\nmaking skill for that response. Scores include\n0 (worse response), 1 (second best response) and\n2 (best response).\nResults\nCoverage\nThe range of scores (representing the proportion)\nfor content coverage for Lesson 2 of the seventh\nthe seventh grade curriculum was 0.81 for Lesson 2\nCoverage for the ninth grade curriculum for Les-\n1.00 for Lesson 6.

However, as seen\nfor content coverage, the range of scores was large\nLesson 6).\nThe median score for use of the appropriate in-\nfor Lesson 6. That is, half of the officers utilized the\nappropriate instructional strategy for at least half of\nthe activities in Lesson 2 and in at least 0.60 of the\nactivities in Lesson 6.

These models are necessary to take\ninto account the nested nature of the data. HLM\nImplementation fidelity\nmodels produce unbiased estimates of standard\nerrors and corresponding significance tests [25].\nThis is accomplished by the inclusion of a second-\nlevel error term (l0\n) that allows the individual\nlevel errors (rij\n) to be uncorrelated. Higher scores\non content coverage and adherence to instructional\nstrategy variables represent higher coverage and\nadherence during the specific lesson being ob-\nserved. Thus, we would predict positive relation-\nships between the coverage and adherence\nvariables and the mediators. In addition, we control\nfor the pre-test scores on each of the program medi-\nators when estimating the effect of implementation\nfidelity on the mediators measured at the post-test.\nThe effect of the pre-test on the post-test score is\nestimated at the individual level and the effect of\nimplementation fidelity (content coverage and ad-\nherence to the appropriate instructional style) is es-\ntimated at the classroom level. For that reason,\nstudent data used in the analyses came from the\nsurveys for students who were in the classroom at\nthe time of observation. The number of observed\nrespectively, of the seventh grade curriculum and\ncurriculum. Table I provides summary statistics\nfor these items measured prior to and after the\nintervention.\nThe HLM analyses showed that for Lesson 2 of\nthe seventh grade curriculum, there was no relation-\nship between content coverage and perceptions of\nconsequences (see Table II).

The focus was on two meas-\nures of implementation fidelity--content coverage\nand adherence to the appropriate instructional strat-\negy. TCYL's programmatic conceptual design was\nbased on principles of substance abuse prevention\nwhich include addressing misconceptions held by\nstudents regarding the normative nature of the use\nof substances and helping students understand the\nnegative consequences of substance use. In addi-\ntion, the program provides opportunities to discuss\nthis decision and to practice skills to resist use in\na variety of age-appropriate and relevant situations.\nTherefore, the emphasis of TCYL, as with other\nrecently designed substance abuse prevention pro-\ngrams, is on specific content and the use of instruc-\ntional strategies which help students internalize the\nskills and knowledge that is provided. D.A.R.E.\nofficers have traditionally used didactic teaching\nTable II.

This model compares giving\na worst answer (0) or a second best answer (1) to a best answer (2). Negative coefficients in these models indicate that students with\nexposure to higher fidelity are less likely to be in the 0 or 1 (worst answer or second best answer) categories than in the 2 (best answer)\ncategory. For all other outcomes, we utilized a hierarchical linear model. Z scores in bold are significant at the P = 0.05 level, using\na two-tailed test.\nbBriefly, normative beliefs I refers to the objective beliefs students hold about the proportion of students their age using drugs.\nNormative beliefs II refers to the idea that most adolescents think it is ok to use drugs. See the measurement section for a full description\nof these two measures.\nImplementation fidelity\ntechniques and the use of interactive strategies\nwhich more fully engage students in the learning\nprocess is a challenge. The substudy allowed us to\ndetermine to what extent the officer instructors de-\nlivered TCYL as it was intended both in content and\ninstructional strategy and to relate fidelity with tar-\ngeted program mediators.\nWe found that the scores for these components of\nimplementation had large ranges, skewed toward\nthe higher implementation levels. Overall, the me-\ndian scores indicate that the officer instructors were\nstronger in covering the content of the curricula\nthan in their use of appropriate instructional strate-\ngies. This may be due to the officer instructors'\nprior experience in didactic teaching methods as\nused with other D.A.R.E. curricula. For the ob-\nserved Lessons 2 which required more didactic\nand modeling instructional strategies, the scores\nwere better than those for observed Lessons 6\nwhich required more interactive and guiding in-\nstructional strategies.\nThe relationship between implementation fidelity\nand the targeted mediators, although not always con-\nsistent, showed promising results. Although higher\nscores for content coverage and use of appropriate\ninstructional strategies for Lesson 2 of the seventh\ngrade curriculum did not show any impact, Lesson 2\nof the ninth grade curriculum and Lessons 6 for both\nthe seventh and ninth grade curricula did show sta-\ntistically significant differences on decision-making\nskills, perceived negative consequences of sub-\nstance use and alcohol expectancies. These findings\nsuggest that the greater the adherence both to the\ncurricula as designed and engagement of students\nas prescribed appear to produce the desired impact\non those elements or targeted mediators of the\nintervention.\nThe similarities in findings across the two dimen-\nsions of implementation fidelity are not surprising\ngiven the high correlations between more complete\ncontent coverage and use of appropriate instruc-\ntional style. However, the inconsistency of the re-\nlationship between how the program was delivered\nand the mediator scores are difficult to assess. Les-\nson 2 focuses heavily on consequences of substance\nuse showing how these substances impact brain\nfunctioning. Students participate in teams as emer-\ngency medical technicians and must determine\nwhat substance a hypothetical student has taken\nby reviewing that student's symptoms. It may be\nthat involvement in the activities of the lesson may\nbe sufficient alone and that it does not matter how\nthe officer instructor presents the material. In con-\ntrast, Lesson 6 of the seventh grade curriculum\nemphasizes two aspects of decision making. First\nis learning the steps involved in making decisions\nwhile the second is to apply these steps through\ngroup discussion using a scenario as an organizing\nframework. In this way, decision making is rein-\nforced using different instructional strategies.\nThe major thrust of Lesson 2 of the ninth grade\ncurriculum is on the consequences of substance use\nwithin the context of impeded brain functioning.\nResistance skills in this lesson address both external\nand internal pressures to use alcohol and drugs. The\nactivities for the session were primarily done in\nteams with `go around' brainstorming around strat-\negies to resist these pressures. The idea is to have\nthe students talk about the pressures and within the\ncontext of several scenarios suggest how to avoid\nuse of alcohol or drugs. Perhaps the options within\nthe question responses are not sufficiently sensitive\nto reflect changes.\nThere are several limitations to the substudy\nwhich should be mentioned. First, as noted previ-\nously, the decision-making skills' outcome is mea-\nsured by a single item indicator. This item does not\nhave the psychometric properties of a multiple item\nscale and thus measurement reliability cannot be\nassessed. In spite of this limitation, we did find\nsignificant associations between implementation\nfidelity and this outcome. It is unlikely that imple-\nmentation fidelity is correlated with measurement\nerror. It is more likely that this relationship is mis-\nestimated due to our inability to estimate a measure-\nment model. Structural equation models, with\na multiple item indicator of decision-making skills,\nwould likely show stronger relationships than those\nestimated here. However, despite of this limitation,\nthe observed association is statistically significant.\nAlso related to this issue is the measure of resis-\ntance skills for the ninth grade curriculum. We drew\nZ. Sloboda et al.\nfrom other research in developing these measures.\nHowever, as we mentioned earlier, our approach\nneeds to be revisited.\nA second limitation of the current project is the\nlimited number of lessons observed each year. Be-\ncause of time and cost, we decided to sample the\nlessons choosing those lessons which focused on\nsome of the mediators and which represented dif-\nferent instructional strategies. Therefore, we only\nobserved 20% of the lessons (two of 10 lessons)\nin seventh grade and 28% of the lessons (two of\nseven lessons) in ninth grade. It would have been\ninteresting to observe a greater number of lessons to\nsee if the results found for these four observed les-\nsons held. We do believe that these lessons do re-\nflect the broader curriculum and, indeed, high\ncorrelations were found between lessons for indi-\nvidual officer instructors with r values of 0.535\nbeing the lowest between the two observations of\nuse of appropriate instructional strategy for the\nninth grade curriculum to 0.926 for use of appro-\npriate instructional strategy for the ninth grade cur-\nriculum. These high values suggest that the number\nof observed lessons may be sufficient. Future stud-\nies may want to assess more program lessons, al-\nthough we acknowledge that this is a costly\nendeavor.\nThis project is unique in that we had a large sam-\nple of observed classrooms. Current statistical tech-\nniques, such as the hierarchical linear models,\nutilized in the current project require relatively large\nsample sizes. Unfortunately, even with such a large\nsample of observed classrooms, we may not have\nhad sufficient power to detect effects at the 0.05\nlevel. A larger sample of classrooms would have\nincreased power. This is of real concern for future\nresearch and smaller projects, where implementa-\ntion quality will be assessed across fewer class-\nrooms. Techniques, such as the multilevel models,\nestimated here are not recommended for sample\nOne explanation of why the D.A.R.E. officers\nwould adhere to the curriculum so closely may be\ndue to the organization's regimented training and\nheavy reliance on the printed teaching manuals\n(e.g. officers were taught outlining skills during\ntraining with D.A.R.E. America as part of prepa-\nration for teaching). However, of concern are the\nmoderate scores for using the appropriate instruc-\ntional strategies, particularly those which are\nhighly interactive. It is possible that more positive\nexperience with such strategies will give the offi-\ncers more confidence. Clearly, the officers need to\nhave feedback to reinforce their good techniques\nand to correct those which are problematic. It is\ntherefore important to have teachers within the\nschools or D.A.R.E. mentors available to provide\nthis assistance.\nHowever, the information needed to guide train-\ning of deliverers of substance abuse prevention pro-\ngramming requires the field to develop standard\ndefinitions and measures of the components which\nconstitute fidelity of implementation and the meth-\nodologies best suited to collect these data. The\napproaches used in this study to examine imple-\nmentation were drawn heavily from those reported\nin the literature. Many former studies rely on self-\nreport of the instructors using a checklist. There are\nobvious limitations of such an approach. Further-\nmore, few studies include more than one dimension\nof implementation, primarily examining some as-\npect of content coverage or exposure. The curricu-\nlum design of TCYL included as key features not\nonly content but also instructional strategy using\nthe most appropriate strategy to enhance the learn-\ning process.\nAlthough implementation fidelity has been\naddressed by individual investigators, there are no\nstandardized definitions, measurements or data col-\nlection methodologies to guide this research. As\nprograms go from controlled `laboratory' settings\ninto the `real world', it will be more important to\ndevelop these standards to determine to what extent\nprograms are implemented in the field as they were\ndesigned to be delivered under research controlled\nconditions.\nFunding\nImplementation fidelity\nConflict of interest statement\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1.
