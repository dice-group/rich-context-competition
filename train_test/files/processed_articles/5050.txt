Harris, Graham, Friedlander, Laud, & Dougherty, 2013;\nSalahu-Din, Persky, & Miller, 2008). However, George Leef\n(2013), an educational columnist, commented that young\nAmerican students graduate from high school with \"pathetic\nabilities\" in crucial areas: reading and writing. Tyre (2012),\nwhen discussing the consequence of American students not\nknowing how to write, stated that \"when students don't learn\nhow to articulate ideas, their options erode--and our whole\nsociety is worse off for it\" (para. 1).\nTeachers serve as a crucial link in the move to improve\nliteracy skills of K-12 students; however, teachers them-\nselves are underprepared to be writers and writing teachers\nof the key reasons why high school graduates could not\nwrite well was that many of their teachers were not very\ngood themselves. For example, in a case study of three\nCalifornia colleges' education programs, Hochstetler (2007)\nfound that first, most teachers were not taught how to write\nin K-12 schools nor in the university; second, they were not\ntaught how to teach writing in teacher preparation nor in\nprofessional development; and, third, the materials they\nwere provided with to teach writing when they did enter the\nprofession were, at best, only peripherally related to writing,\nand writing instruction.\nThe need for improving the effectiveness of writing\nteachers is underscored by a recent evaluation conducted by\n1Central Michigan University, Mt Pleasant, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMingyuan Zhang, Central Michigan University, EHS 461, Mt Pleasant, MI\nEmail: zhang1m@cmich.edu\nRising to the Challenge: What Practicing\nTeachers Learned From a Process-Based\nWriting Project in a Graduate Capstone\nSeminar\nXiaoping Li1 and Mingyuan Zhang1\n Keywords\nprocess-based, research writing, phases, reflective practices\n2 SAGE Open\nthe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP),\nwhich indicated that only 24% of the students in Grades 8\nand 12 in the United States could write at a proficient level\n(National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2012).\nAccording to The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2011\n(NCES, 2012), students performing at this level need to\nclearly demonstrate the ability to accomplish the communi-\ncative purpose of their writing. Nevertheless, the remaining\nthree quarters of the students performed at basic or below\nbasic levels.\nAs faculty members in an education graduate program at\na large Midwest 4-year public university, we set as one of our\ngoals to prepare graduate students who were practicing K-12\nteachers for the professional challenges ahead. In particular,\nwe believe it is important for practicing teachers to develop a\ndeep understanding of the writing process with first-hand\nexperience and confidence in their abilities to write, and\nteach writing. To do this, we constructed a process-based\nwriters' workshop model for a research writing project in a\ncapstone course to find out the challenges the practicing\nteachers would face and the lessons they would learn, which\nmay shed some light on how to improve the effectiveness of\nwriting teachers for K-12 students.\nProcess-based writing approach has been utilized in post-\nsecondary writing programs (J. Harris, 1996; K. Harris et al.,\nmore than three decades. While Ken Macrorie (1985) out-\nlined the practices of process-based writing pedagogy 30\nyears ago, Lannon's book on the writing process approach\nkey components of process-based writing include students\nengaging in cycle of activities, starting from brainstorming\nto outlining, from peer-reviewing to editing and publishing.\nThey write with real purposes for real audiences, and the\nproject could last a period of time (Barnhisel, Stoddard, &\nThe purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the\nprocess-based writing experienced by 22 practicing K-12\nteachers through their reflective practices in completing\na research writing project in a graduate capstone class.\nIn particular, this study explored the challenges the teachers\nfaced and the lessons they learned through the recursive\nstages of writing: planning, drafting, revising, editing, and\npublishing.\nReview of Literature\nProcess-Based Approach to Writing\nThe International Reading Association (2009), the National\nWriting Project (2014), and the National Association for the\nEducation of Young Children (NAEYC; 2013) all endorsed\nthe process-based writing approach for learning how to\nwrite. Solley (2000) gave a historical perspective on the\nteaching of writing when writing was taught in school as a\nproduct, not a process. Teaching of the process-based writing\nthe writing process of high school students. Calkins,\nEhrenworth, and Lehman (2012) extended the writing\nprocess model into the writers' workshop model by adding\nconferring and publishing to the process.\nThe process-based writing approach requires students to\nproduce a paper in several phases, each phase receiving sig-\nnificant instructor and/or peer intervention. Although phases\nof process-based approach vary (Ferris & Hedgcock, 2013),\nit could include pre-writing activities, first draft, revising,\nediting, conferring, revising subsequent drafts, and pub-\nlishing. The phases are recursive (Artunduaga, 2013; Kolb,\nfor each phase writers receive feedback--suggestions on\nhow to improve and how to better achieve the goals of the\nassignment.\nAmong the advantages of process-based writing approach\nis that it fosters writing competency in students that is trans-\nferrable not only between courses but also within a wide\nvariety of writing situations. Process-based writing can make\nit easier for learners to import the skills and practices they\nhave learned into new contexts (Guy, 2009).\nthe teachers who participated in a semester-long process-\nbased writing course reported that they felt more prepared\nto teach writing, had an increased understanding of writing,\nwere more confident writers themselves, felt better prepared\nand more comfortable giving guidance and feedback, and had\nan increased ability to assign and grade writing assignments.\nGenre-Based Approach to Writing\nGenre, according to The Bedford Glossary of Critical and\nLiteracy Terms (Murfin & Ray, 2003), is \"the classification\nof literacy works on the basis of their content, form, or tech-\nnique\" (p. 189). For centuries, works have been grouped\naccording to a number of classificatory schemes and dis-\ntinctions, such as prose/poem, fiction/drama, and comedy/\ntragedy. Recently, genres have been categorized based on the\npurposes of writing. Derewianka (1990) identified six main\nschool types according to their primary social purposes: (a)\nnarratives: tell a story, usually to entertain; (b) recount: tell\nwhat happened; (c) information reports: provide factual\ninformation; (d) instruction: tell the listeners or readers what\nto do; (e) explanation: explain why or how something\nhappens; and (f) expository texts: present or argue a view-\npoint. The Common Core State Standards (National\nGovernors Association Center for Best Practices & Council\nof Chief State School Officers, 2010) grouped different\ngenres into three major types of writing, namely, argumenta-\ntive writing--to persuade, informational writing--to inform,\nand narrative writing--to convey experience.\nGenre-based approach to writing goes hand in hand with\nprocess-based approach and has become a prevalent topic in\nLi and Zhang 3\ntextbooks for teaching writing to advance the Common Core\nState Standards (e.g., Fredricksen, Wilhelm, & Smith, 2012;\nSmith, Wilhelm, & Fredricksen, 2012; Wilhelm, Smith, &\nFredricksen, 2012). The aforementioned authors have pub-\nlished a series of textbooks on narrative, informational, and\nargumentative writing, introducing many genre-specific\nstrategies. K-12 teachers have also adopted genre-based\nhow English as a second language (ESL) and content area\nteachers can use the genre-based Reading to Learning\napproach to support adolescent English learners (ELs) in\nlearning to write in an academic way. Kohnen (2013) and\nDonovan and Smolkin (2011) reported successful teaching\nexperiences in applying genre-specific strategies with stu-\ndent writing; while Kohnen focused on informational writing\nin high school science, Donovan and Smolkin focused on\nelementary-level informational writing.\nRegardless of the different approaches to teaching writing\nand different ways to categorize genres, there are common\nprinciples all effective writing teachers need to follow to\nhelp their students develop beliefs about the nature of writ-\ning. Drawing from the theory and practice of teaching genre,\nDuke, Caughlan, Juzwi, and Martin (2012) have identified\nfive guiding principles to teach genre-based writing, which\necho the process-based writing approach described in the\nprevious section:\n1. Design compelling, communicatively meaningful\nenvironment.\n2. Provide exposure and experience.\n3. Explicitly teach genre features.\n4. Explicitly teach genre-specific or genre-sensitive\nstrategies.\n5. Offer ongoing coaching and feedback\nFeedback From Writing Instructors\nFeedback from writing instructors, as a key component in the\nprocess-based approach to writing, plays an important role in\nimproving student's writing (Feuerherm, 2011; Gulley,\n2012). Past research tends to survey student perceptions of\nthe feedback from the instructors and action taken in response\nto such feedback (McMartin-Miller, 2014; Stellmack,\nKeenan, Sandidge, Sippl, & Konheim-Kalkstein, 2012).\nHowever, how writing instructors think of the right way to\nprovide feedback and how they actually provide feedback\nFerris, Brown, Liu, and Stine (2011) recently conducted a\nseries of research studies on the topic, which received the\nattention of both researchers and writing instructors.\nOne revealing result from Ferris's (2014) study was that\nthere was variation across the instructors and discontinuity\nbetween their self-reported feedback principles and their\nactual practice. Specifically, while writing instructors were\nbeing interviewed, they described their response principles\nof providing multiple-draft responses, indicating students\nwould receive one or multiple-time feedback from the\ninstructors. But further examination revealed that most of the\nfeedback for the preliminary drafts was from fellow students\nvia in-class peer reviews. The format of such peer reviews\nwas often rubric handouts or feedback forms; seldom was\nthere a special training session to prepare students for the\npeer review. Another finding of practice discontinuity was\nthat when assessing the importance of teacher\u00adstudent con-\nferences, all instructors agreed on its importance and effec-\ntiveness, but in practice, many instructors reported that they\ndid not have enough time to run such conferences and only\nmet with the students who visited them during office hours.\net al. (2011) concur with those by Montgomery and Baker\n(2007) that while most writing teachers recognized the prac-\ntice of providing feedback on both local and global issues\nthroughout the writing process, they should concentrate on\nglobal issues on first drafts and local issues on subsequent\ndrafts. The writing instructors in the study actually gave far\nmore feedback on grammar and mechanics on student papers\nthan they reported in their survey. Such an approach does not\nfollow the recommendations for balanced feedback on global\nand local issues, depending on the needs of each students,\nPeer Revising and Editing\nMacArthur (2013) defined peer revising and editing as a\ncommon feature of writing process classrooms and it was\noften recommended as a way of providing student writers\nwith an audience of readers to respond to their writing,\nidentify strengths and weaknesses, and recommend\nimprovement.\nGraham and Perin's (2007) milestone meta-analysis of\nwriting instruction for adolescent students reported, among\nothers, on the effects of peer assistance as a strategy of scaf-\nfolding students' writing controlled against students who\nwrote alone. The seven effect sizes for peers working together\nto plan, draft, and/or revise their compositions were positive.\nCollective arrangements where students worked together to\nhelp each other with one or more aspects of the process writ-\ning had a strong and positive impact on writing quality.\nTo enhance the effectiveness of peer assistance, it was\nsuggested that peer revision be integrated with instruction in\nevaluation and revision (Philippakos, 2012). Specifically,\nwhen students were given a rubric for evaluating their class-\nmates' writing and shown how to apply it to evaluate strong\nand weak papers and make suggestions, the peer evaluation\nwas more effective and meanwhile the student reviewers also\nimproved the quality of their own writing.\nStellmack et al. (2012) described the traditional approach\nof review\u00adrevise\u00adresubmit procedure. In this approach,\ninstructors tell the students what is wrong with the paper, and\n4 SAGE Open\nstudents revise according to the instructions from the instruc-\ntor. Stellmack et al. challenged the effectiveness of this\napproach by stating that any improvement in the grades after\nthe review\u00adrevise\u00adresubmit procedure might only be an indi-\ncation that \"a student has successfully responded to the feed-\nback of the grader and has satisfied the grader to some extent\nin revising the paper\" (p. 244). Their research results show\nthat when blinded, graders who were not provided the origi-\nnal feedback often perceived less improvement across drafts\nand frequently perceived no change or a decrement in writ-\ning quality across drafts.\nSome recent studies attempted to look into the nature of\nthe feedback during peer revision. Guasch, Espasa, Alvarez,\nand Kirschner (2013) reported on what type of feedback best\nimproves the quality of peer revision and editing in an envi-\nronment based on asynchronous written communication.\nTheir results revealed that epistemic feedback and suggestive\nfeedback best improved the quality of revision performance.\nThe Benefits of Teachers as Writers\nTeachers as writers are endorsed in numerous research stud-\nment is that in perusing their own writing lives, teachers will\ninform and enhance their writing pedagogy (Dawson, 2009;\nPenny Kittle (2008) pointed out, \"I now believe you really\ncan't teach writing well unless you write yourself\" (p. 7).\nThere are many books and articles targeting teachers and\nteacher educators, claiming that teachers who write know\nwriting strategies better, have stronger ability to empathize\nwith student writers, and have valuable understandings about\nMuch of this literature on teacher-writers emphasized\npedagogical methods which teachers can make use of in their\nown writing processes, experiences, and products in the\nclassroom. Dierking and Fox (2013) examined how contact-\ning with other professionals in intensive week-long sessions\nas well as mentoring from the professional development\ncoach affected the practicing teachers'concept of themselves\nas writers, as well as how this attitudinal change affected\ntheir classrooms and students.\nMany researchers looked at preservice teachers to assess\ntheir understanding as writers (e.g., Hall & Grisham-Brown,\nfound that preservice teachers did not enjoy writing, had a\ndifficult time visualizing themselves as being effective writ-\ning teachers, and lacked confidence as writers and future\nteachers of writing. Pytash (2013) reported in her research\nresults that initially the science preservice teachers did not\nhave knowledge of specific instructional approaches to teach\nwriting. Through her instruction, the science preservice\nteachers engaged in critical and analytical reading and writ-\ning, which enhanced their knowledge of how to write and\nhow to teach writing.\nWashburn, Matesha, and Binks (2011) reported that pre-\nservice teachers often entered English language arts teacher\npreparation courses with fears of writing and teaching writ-\ning due to neutral or bad experiences as K-12 students.\nStockinger (2007) provided extensive modeling of writing\nthrough a semester-long methods course involving authentic\nwriting experiences, peer group discussions, extensive\nopportunities for reflection, and a 30-hr field component in a\nlocal elementary school wherein participants worked with\nsmall groups of elementary-student writers. Stockinger\nreported in the research how preservice students developed\npositive, clear images of themselves as writing teachers.\nMorgan (2010) also reported that preservice teachers\nhave a strong sense of themselves as writers along the good\u00ad\nbad writing dichotomy. Her preservice teachers, at the end\nof the writing methods class, identified four instructional\nstrategies: (a) reading like a writer, (b) having similar writ-\ning experiences in class as their future students, (c) writing\nregularly in a topic of their choice, and (d) designing writing\nmini-lessons.\nWhile the process approach to writing instruction is one\nof the most popular methods for teaching writing, most of the\nresearch studies were conducted at K-12 school settings and\nfor preservice teachers (Graham & Sandmel, 2011; Morgan,\n2010). There have been research studies at the graduate-level\ncourse on technical writings for a statistics course (see K. M.\nCollins, Onwuegbuzie, & Jiao, 2014), and on how to enhance\nthe writing in a qualitative research course (see Sallee,\nHallett, & Tierney, 2011). However, studies examining how\nthe process approach to writing instruction is taught at the\ngraduate-level educational course are scarce. This study\nexplored the challenges the 22 practicing teachers faced and\nthe lessons they learned through the recursive phases of writ-\ning: planning, drafting, revising, editing, conferring, and\npublishing in a graduate capstone class.\nResearch Methodology\nParticipants\nThe 22 participants in this study were matriculated graduate\nstudents in a master of arts in education program in a 4-year\npublic university in the Midwest region of the United States.\nTen of these students were elementary school teachers, 10\nwere middle school teachers, and 2 were high school teach-\ners. The classroom experience of the teachers ranged from 4\nto 19 years. There were 19 females and 3 males. Their ages\nAll participants were native English speakers; none of\nthem were bilingual, and a few had learned Spanish in sec-\nondary school. As for research writing, all of them had writ-\nten many papers for graduate-level courses for their master's\ndegree. However, all the writing emphasized the end-\nproduct, with handing in the paper at the end of the semester\nas normal practice. Seldom was there any multiple-draft\nLi and Zhang 5\nexperience in the graduate courses. When being informed of\nthis research writing project, they were all unsure of how\nexactly the process-based writing would unfold.\nCourse Description\nThis course, titled Master of Arts Capstone Seminar is one of\nthe last courses of the master's degree in education. The\ncourse prepares students for a 4-hr long comprehensive\nexamination on multiple K-12 educational topics called the\nCapstone Examination. This course specifically requires stu-\ndents to have an in-depth study of a topic developed with\ninput from the student's master's degree advisor, and\napproved by the instructor of the course. It must reflect the\nresults of a substantial review of the literature obtained\nthrough the research methodologies the student has learned\nduring the master's program, and the tools to which the stu-\ndent has been introduced during the Capstone Seminar\ncourse. The final paper must be a synthesis of the work from\nthe student review of the literature and relevant course work.\nThis culminating research project should not only illustrate\nthe abilities of the individual student to collect and report\ninformation on a topic of special interest and relevance to\nclassroom teachers but also reflect plans for specific applica-\ntions to classroom practices.\nThis course was normally conducted in a seminar format,\npreparing students to conduct research on a specific educa-\ntional topic. Usually, students engaged the research individu-\nally, and at the end of the course, they shared the research\nfindings with classmates. This traditional product-based\nmethod brought plenty of pressure on students; a majority of\nstudents felt as if they were fighting an individual war, with\nno connection and communication with their fellow class-\nmates, nor a sense of belonging to a learning community.\nAs a result, students struggled and produced low-quality\nresearch papers. The outcome of such methods was unsatis-\nfactory both to faculty members and students. A call for\nchange was both necessary and urgent.\nThe instructor of this course decided to approach the writ-\ning project with new strategies based on her own teaching\nexperience and an extensive literature review on process-\nbased writing, teachers-as-writers, and benefits of peer\nrevision and editing. The key strategies adopted included (a)\nhelping students gain their identity as writers and the owner-\nship of the writings, (b) engaging research in a process-based\napproach rather than product-based approach, and (c) build-\ning a learning community in peer mentoring, revising, and\nediting.\nThe instructor believed that such strategies, when prop-\nerly implemented, would have long-term positive effects on\nwould make teachers feel more confident in their abilities to\nwrite, and therefore, teach writing. This research writing\nproject was completed during a 6-week summer course where\nstudents wrote a 20-page, double-spaced synthesis of litera-\nture review. The process-based writers' workshop model\nfollowed the five phases.\nPhase I: Topics and Questions--Generating Ideas\nPhase II: Sources and Syntheses--Building Knowledge\nPhase III: Putting It Together--Drafting\nPhase IV: Revising and Editing--Peer Mentoring\nPhase V: Finalizing and Sharing--Publishing\nTo help the participating teachers see how the process-\nbased writing approach moved from phase to phase, we used\nto design a flow chart (Figure 1) to show the phases used in\nthis writing project.\nThese phases in the flow chart may appear linear; how-\never, they are actually recursive (Artunduaga, 2013; Kolb\nwriting process in action, we will find that rehearsing, draft-\ning, and revising occur again and again during the whole\nwriting process. When the writer is drafting, one continues\nto discover, recall, and revise. Therefore, writing is a tre-\nmendously complex process involving recursive application\nof a wide range of thinking skills, linguistic abilities, and\nknowledge base.\nFigure 1. Flow chart representing phases used in the writing\nproject.\n6 SAGE Open\nData Collection and Analysis\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the challenges the\n22 graduate students faced and the lessons they learned\nthrough their reflective practices in a graduate capstone\nclass. Multiple sources of data were collected and analyzed\nand they include (a) instructor's field notes derived from\nobservation and informal interviews between the instructor\nand the students before, during, and after class; (b) graduate\nstudents' daily reflections; and (c) all capstone research\nproject-related written assignments including outlines,\ndrafts, and final versions of the paper.\nFor the purpose of data collection, nine written assign-\nments and nine daily reflections were designed based on the\nphases of the process-based writing approach. Each student\nsubmitted the assignments listed below. All assignments\nwere in written format and were required to be submitted to\nthe course Blackboard, and later were all exported and\narchived in the first author's personal computer for coding\nand recoding:\n1. Draft capstone research question and reflection sheet\n2. Ten journal articles and reflection sheet\n3. Annotated bibliography of the articles and reflection\nsheet\n4. Ten journal article synthesis charts and reflection\nsheet\n5. Research topic outline and reflection sheet\n6. First draft and reflection sheet\n7. Second draft and reflection sheet\n8. Third draft and reflection sheet\n9. Final research report and reflection sheet\n(see Appendix A for a sample assignment and reflection\nsheet).\nThe first author of this article was the instructor of the\ncourse, and acted as a participant of all class activities. She\ncollected the data via participant observation (field notes,\ninformal interview before, during, and after class). Participant\nobservation is a routinely used method in qualitative research\nThe informal interviews by the first author before, during,\nand after class were written down as field notes. Some were\nwritten down on the spots, some were written down immedi-\nately after the interviews, and some were written down after\nthe day's class was over. All notes were individually and\nchronologically recorded in accordance with the phases of\nthe process-based writing approach.\nTo ensure reliability and validity of the instructor's field\nnotes, triangulation and member checking techniques for\nqualitative research studies were utilized (Fraenkel et al.,\n2014). Triangulation refers to the use of different data sources,\ntime periods, and data collection methods that result in simi-\nlar findings (McMillan & Wergin, 2009). We collected gradu-\nate students' daily reflections, their written assignments, and\nthe instructor's field notes based on observation and informal\ninterviews before, during, and after class, and it was found\nthat the field notes corroborated the data derived from the\nanalysis of the graduate students' daily reflections and their\nwritten assignments.\nThe second technique utilized to ensure reliability and\nvalidity is member checking, which refers to the practice of\nsubmitting researchers' field notes to the participants to ver-\nify whether their perspectives have been recorded accurately\n(McMillan & Wergin, 2009). After all field notes were indi-\nvidually and chronologically recorded, they were sent back\nto respective participants for accuracy check. The participat-\ning teachers were invited to make notes on the printouts if\nthey found any discrepancies. All discrepancies were recti-\nfied before the data coding and recoding process began.\nA grounded theory approach was used in this data analy-\nsis (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The aim of grounded theory is\nto generate or discover a theory (Charmaz, 2014). Grounded\ntheory is defined as \"the discovery of theory from data\nsystematically obtained from social research\" (Bryant &\nCharmaz, 2007). We believed that the grounded theory\napproach was a good fit for two reasons. The first reason is\nthat the essence of the grounded theory is that it takes an\ninductive pathway to the phenomenon of the study (Stern &\nPorr, 2011)--we did not have any pre-determined positions\nto prove or disprove about what and how students might\nrespond cognitively and emotionally to the process-based\napproach to the writing project. The second reason is that as\ndata collection progressed, we were able to detect patterns\nand discern meanings from the student subjective experience\nby using the main analysis techniques of the grounded\ntheory: open coding and recoding, and repeated constant\ncomparisons. The triangulation of graduate students' daily\nreflections, their written assignments, and the instructor's\nfield notes based on observation and informational interview\nbefore, during, and after class was used to strengthen the\ncredibility and validity of the findings.\nBecause grounded theory emerges as a result of data\nanalysis, the triangulated data were cast onto a matrix that\nfollowed initial coding and recoding (Tracy, 2013). The\nauthors of this article adopted an inductive stance and strived\nto derive meanings from the data (Creswell, 2012; Hennink,\nHutter, & Bailey, 2010). After several rounds of initial cod-\ning and recoding, we found several themes within the data.\nEach author independently coded the data using those\nthemes. To establish inter-rater reliability, we compared our\ncoding. To address any differences in coding, we re-ana-\nlyzed the data together, shared our thoughts, and resolved\nall differences, thus establishing agreement in coding\nfor themes. When we began to map out the findings, they\nshowed a close parallel with the phases of writing pro-\ncesses; so it was agreed on by the authors that the best way\nto present the findings was to follow the process-based\nwriting phases and embed the themes that emerged from\nthe analyses within each phase.\nLi and Zhang 7\nWhen describing validity and reliability in qualitative\nresearch, the term \"rigor\" is often used instead (Lincoln &\n\"rigor are ways to establish trust or confidence in the find-\nings or results of a research study\" (p. 151). The model of\ntrustworthiness of qualitative research proposed by Lincoln\nand Guba (1985) addressed four components of trust-\nworthiness that were relevant to qualitative research: (a)\ntruth-value (credibility), (b) applicability (transferability),\n(c) consistency (dependability), and (d) neutrality (con-\nfirmability). We used this model to emphasize the rigor of\ndata collection and analysis.\nTo establish credibility, we reviewed the researcher's\nfield notes derived from observation and informal interviews\nbefore, during, and after class; student reflections; and the\nmany writing drafts by students to look for similarities and\npatterns within and across study participants. To establish\ntransferability, we provided detailed descriptions of the\ndemographics of the participants of the study, the questions\nasked for student reflection, and steps taken by the course\ninstructor for each phase of the writing processes. All these\nendeavors make it possible for researchers with similar inter-\nests to use the information to further examine this important\ntopic in different populations. To establish dependability, we\nprovided detailed descriptions of data collection procedures,\nand had both authors participate in the analysis process.\nWhen there were discrepancies in the results of analysis, we\nreviewed the data and the coding and recoding details to\nreach a consensus. The last component of the model is con-\nfirmability, which, according to Thomas and Magilvy (2011),\nwill occur when credibility, transferability, and dependabil-\nity have been established. One key part of confirmability is to\nhave the researchers of the study reflect on how their own\npreconceptions might affect the research and do the best to\nlessen the possible impact. We made a conscious effort to\nfollow, rather than lead, the direction of the reflection by ask-\ning the participants to clarify the points they were making\nboth in interviews and written reflection. Great attention was\npaid to the rigor of the research, and the model of trustwor-\nthiness recommended by Lincoln and Guba (1985) was\nfollowed from the conceptualization through the completion\nof the research.\nResearch Findings\nIn the following sections of the article, we present the find-\nings based on the five phases of the process-based workshop\nmodel.\nPhase I: Topics and Questions--Generating Ideas\nDuring Phase I of the process-based writers' workshop, the\nteachers in the class chose a topic and wrote a capstone ques-\ntion to study for the rest of the semester. The process used to\nassist teachers in choosing and writing a capstone question\nwas instructor modeling and student brainstorming. The\ninstructor used key words \"Critical Literacy\" as an example\nto start the modeling process by answering questions on four\nkey areas in the following organizer (Figure 2).\nAt the end of Phase I, all students had chosen a topic and\nwritten on specific areas of their interest. Some of the topics\nincluded,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Integrated Curriculum in Middle School\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A Comparison of Full-Day Versus Half-Day\nKindergarten\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Single Gender Schools\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Best Middle-Level Science Practices\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Peer-Led Literature Discussion Groups\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Equity in the Mathematics Classroom: Ensuring All\nStudents Succeed\nHere is an example of a capstone question following the\ngraphic organizer by a student:\nMy Topic: Using Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy\nSkills (DIBELS) as an Assessment of Early Literacy Skills\nIn this era of No Child Left Behind, educators are looking for\nassessment tools to evaluate the early literacy skills of their\nyoung students. Many schools are employing the DIBELS\nprogram as a measure of students' growth and achievement.\nWhat are the components of the DIBELS assessment program?\nWhat are the reliability and validity of the DIBELS measurement\ntools? What challenges do classroom teachers face to implement\nthe use of DIBELS? How can teachers effectively use DIBELS'\nresults to support early literacy skill development? (Sheila)\nWhen reflecting on the most difficult part of writing a\ncapstone question, the teachers' reflections fall into three\nthemes. They are (a) how to find a topic that was not too nar-\nrow, yet not too broad; (b) how to put thoughts into words;\nand (c) how to write an informative lead sentence despite\nlack of prior knowledge.\nFigure 2. Graphic organizer with four key areas.\n8 SAGE Open\nIn this initial phase of the process-based writing work-\nshop, they learned that (a) reviewing the literature was a\nnecessary part of finding a research topic; (b) writing a cap-\nstone question required multiple layers of thinking; and (c)\ncreating a topic included (i) defining the topic, (ii) looking\nat prior research, (iii) dealing with problems associated with\nthe topic, and (iv) making the scope of the capstone question\nmanageable. Here are some thoughts expressed through the\nreflection journals of the students and informal interviews\nwith the first author.\nOn the Effectiveness of Using the Graphic Organizer:\nI learned that writing a capstone question was not as difficult as\nI thought it would be as long as I followed the graphic organizer\ngiven in class along with the class examples. The professor's\nmodeling and visual aids helped me see how I could find my\ntopic of interest and replicate the format shown to produce my\nown capstone question. (Dana)\nI was fearful of not being able to organize my thoughts for this\npaper. Being introduced to the flowchart and the prompts helped\nme immensely as it began to make sense how I can structure the\npaper. (Cheryl)\nOn the Uncertainty of the Topic:\nIt's okay to tweak it if you've started your research and realize\nthat it's taking you in a slightly different direction than you\ninitially planned on going. (Angela)\nWill my capstone question stay the same or will it change as I\nperform more research? I am not yet sure if I will be able to find\nenough information to answer the questions I have created.\n(Sarah)\nOn Connecting With Their Own Teaching:\nStrategies provided by the professor can be easily applied to my\nstudents in my own teaching. I see a parallel between the\ndifficulty of my own topic searching and that of my high school\nstudents in finding topics for their research. (Michelle)\nI liked the process the professor used in helping me find a\nresearch topic. I will employ similar strategies in supporting my\nstudents to choose their research topics. (Ben)\nBased on the process-based approach of writing, we\nbelieved teachers'concerns at Phase I were natural and mostly\nresulted from a lack of prior knowledge of the topic. We\nemphasized the process-based writing model and tried to\nreassure the teachers that the writing was recursive and\nnothing was final at this early phase. We used the analogy of\nwriting being like planting a seed and the seed (topic) will\ndevelop through its life stages. It was well accepted by most\nof the teachers. Teachers'reflections indicated that the graphic\norganizer we provided proved to be an effective tool that\nhelped students sort their ideas and finalize a research topic.\nPhase II: Sources and Syntheses--Building\nKnowledge\nThere are two components in this phase. For the first compo-\nnent, teachers were requested to conduct an online library\nsearch to find 10 journal articles related to their topic. All\narticles needed to be from refereed journals, no older than 8\nyears except 1 or 2 classic articles, and had at least eight\npages as most feature articles in journals are about 6,000 to\n7,000 words and about eight or more pages. Those require-\nments were to guarantee the journal articles were current and\nof high quality.\nTo assist teachers in identifying 10 research articles, we\naccompanied them to the university computer lab, and\nmodeled using electronic educational databases such as\nEducation Full Text (EBSCO) and the Education Resources\nInformation Center (ERIC). The instructor's sample research\ntopic Critical Literacy: A Critical Component in Literacy\nDevelopment was used as the example for conducting educa-\ntional database search. The instructor demonstrated how to\nuse these two educational databases and record the reference\ninformation. The instructor also showed students a variety of\nways of using different combinations of key words for con-\nducting online search and showed that a simple change in the\nsearch term, such as the order of search terms, could lead to\nmajor changes in the search result. Teachers were able to\nlook thoroughly into their individual topics and were amazed\nat the amount of information available. For instance, the term\n\"critical literacy\" in EBSCO resulted in 2,514 entries. They\nwere all able to locate 10 or more articles and write annotated\nbibliographies of the 10 articles to submit and share with\nclassmates. This online library database search enhanced\nteachers' ability to conduct independent research--a key\nskill toward becoming a researcher (Helms & Whitesell,\nWhen reflecting on the most difficult part of writing for\nthis phase, the teachers' reflections fall into three themes: (a)\ncoming up with the search terms that would yield the best\nresults, (b) locating quality research articles that met the\npage and year requirements, and (c) deciding which of the\nmany articles to read. They learned that (a) when doing\nsearches, it was best to start broad and narrow down from\nthere, and (b) it was helpful to look at the related searches\nthat the search engine suggested based on the original search.\nOn the Experience of Finding Research Articles:\nThe most difficult part of finding 10 research articles was\ncoming up with the search terms that would yield the best\nresults. I started out with \"integrated curriculum\" and that\nbrought more than one thousand hits. I then narrowed it down\nwith \"middle school\" but that made the focus too narrow. I then\nthought to look at the related terms that were on the bottom of\nthe detailed records and that helped the search a lot. I have\nlearned that when searching it is best to start broad and then\nnarrow down from there. (Kendra)\nLi and Zhang 9\nI would like to find out if the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early\nLiteracy Skills (DIBELS) is used only in the United States or if\nit is used in other countries. I would also like to see how my\nschool compares to the national average in achievement rates on\nthe DIBELS measures, but that may have to wait until after this\npaper is complete. (Sheila)\nI have created my capstone question that I am trying to answer\nand not all of the articles on my topic were directly related to my\nquestions. It was difficult to meet the criteria for choosing\njournal articles. Sometimes it may have been a good article but\nit did not have enough pages nor current publishing dates. It was\nalso difficult to find articles that were directly related to my\nspecific topic. I need to experiment with more and different\nterms. (Ben)\nAt the end of this component of Phase II, we felt that\nteachers were on the right track for the writing project. We\nnoticed that many quality journal articles were located, and\nteachers had made good progress in knowledge building for\ntheir respective topics. The annotated bibliography helped\nthem use more standard terms for their topics. We also\nnoticed some modifications of topics by some teachers.\nIndividual conferences were conducted with teachers to\nassist them in developing a clear focus of their topics.\nThe second component of this phase was to synthesize the\narticles. This was a significant step of the research writing\nproject based on the process-based writers'workshop model.\nBloom's (1956) taxonomy defined information synthesis as\nthe process of combining elements or parts to form a pattern\nor structure not clearly there or seen before. Students often\nconfuse synthesis with summary (Megwalu, 2013). Whereas\na summary involves condensation of ideas or information to\nhighlight main ideas (J. Collins, 2012), synthesis involves\nexamining, reducing, breaking down, and assimilating infor-\nmation to see emerging points of view (Megwalu, 2013).\nTo assist students in synthesizing research, we designed\nan Inquiry Chart (I-Chart; Table 1), which consists of four\ncolumns/questions: (a) definition/dimensions/principles,\n(b) research support/evidence/effects, (c) challenges/needs/\nissues, and (d) solutions/strategies/applications. The I-Chart\nwas based on the research by Assaf, Ash, Saunders, and\nthe I-Chart, students became more independent and the\nsearch became an inquiry process.\nAs in Phase I, we modeled and guided the strategies in the\nclass first and then let teachers do the charts on their own.\nSee Appendix B for a sample I-Chart.\nWith one I-Chart for each journal article, we laid a solid\nfoundation for our teachers to use multiple sources that pro-\nvided a variety of information for their writing. We found\nthat the three most difficult parts of creating inquiry charts\nfor the teachers were (a) condensing all the articles into a few\nkey points so that the charts did not become overwhelming,\n(b) organizing relevant articles with other focus that did not\nfit the I-Chart well, and (c) technical challenges of reading\nthrough research articles that were full of charts, graphs,\nand statistics. They learned that creating a research synthesis\nchart was a great way to organize information in a research\nproject and showed enthusiasm for implementing such a tool\nin their teaching.\nOn Connecting With Their Own Teaching:\nI learned a great way to organize information in a research\nproject. It is important to read through articles with focus on\nwhat you are looking for. When you know the purpose and main\ntopics of research, it would be easy to put information into\ncategories on a chart. This is definitely something that I could\nuse with my middle school students. I have used a chart for\nresearch in the past with my students but it really just had two\ncolumns: source and information. I think it would be great to\ndivide the chart into more specific columns to categorize the\ninformation. (Leanne)\nI also found it difficult to put notes down instead of just\nhighlighting articles for future use. This is something that I have\nasked my students to do during a research project, so I have a\nmuch more appreciation for the work they were involved in\nnow. I think it will be helpful in the actual writing process of the\npaper, but it took a couple of articles before I was to put notes\ndown with ease. (Kendra)\nAt the end of this phase, we experienced much more posi-\ntive feedback from the class with teachers making major\nprogress in their writing of the capstone paper; more impor-\ntantly, they seemed to become more patient and resilient. We\nsaw and heard less complaints and observed more readiness\nby teachers to dig deeper into the topics; some teachers added\nmore articles to their collection than required. I-Chart played\na key role in helping teachers succeed with the synthesizing\ncomponent. At this point, the pre-writing was complete and\nwe felt the process-based writing so far was successful;\nteachers made significant progress both as writers and in\ntheir perception toward writing. The big picture of the pro-\ncess writing began to sink in and the teachers were ready to\nmove on to the next phase.\nPhase III: Putting It Together--Drafting\nUsing synthesized information from I-Charts to write the\nfirst draft is a critical phase in completing a quality capstone\nresearch writing project. To assist teachers with the first\ndraft, we paid great attention to the process that teachers\nwere recommended to follow. An effective way to organize\nTable 1. Inquiry Chart.\nYour capstone research topic\n\nGuiding\nquestion 1\nGuiding\nquestion 2\nGuiding\nquestion 3\nGuiding\nquestion 4\nArticle 1: \ninformation in the I-Charts was to create a bare-bone road-\nmap outline that reflected the synthesized information. This\nbare-bone roadmap outline was different from the prelimi-\nnary brainstorm-based one in Phase I of the writing process\n(Yeh, Lo, & Huang, 2011); the I-Chart-based outline is a\nroadmap that is rich in information, rooted in the research\nconducted in earlier writing phases, and will provide a solid\nfoundation for a quality first draft.\nWith the 10 I-Chart syntheses based on 10 journal\narticles, teachers created a roadmap outline such as the\nfollowing:\nTopic: Critical Literacy:ACritical Component in Literacy\nDevelopment\n I. Introduction to Critical Literacy\nCritical Literacy: Definitions, Dimensions, and\nPrinciples\nIII. The Need for Critical Literacy in the Classroom\nChallenges to Incorporating Critical Literacy for\nTeachers\nV. Strategies for Teaching Critical Literacy\nVI. Conclusion\nBased on this process, teachers learned that each outline\nneeded to reflect the nature of the particular topics they were\nworking on, but there might be some common components\nthat appeared in most of the outlines, such as Introduction,\nImplications, and Conclusions. With further discussion and\nanalysis of the bare-bone outline and information from the\nI-Chart, a more detailed, full-version outline was created (see\nAppendix C).\nWhen reflecting on the most difficult part of writing for\nthis phase, the teachers' reflections fall into three themes.\nThey are (a) resisting the urge to spend too much time on\ndetails such as wording, paragraphing, and referencing; (b)\nbeing overwhelmed with the full version outline; and (c)\nfinding it a challenge to write a decent first draft, using the\nsynthesized I-Charts. They learned that (a) their research still\nhad gaps and they would need to keep reading and searching\nfor more articles and books to fill in the gaps, (b) an effective\nway to write the first draft was to write one section at a time\nfollowing the full-version outline, and (c) the full-version\noutline could still be revised to meet the overall objectives\nbetter.\nOne problem some teachers ran into is, due to various rea-\nsons, they had not completed the I-Charts for their 10 journal\narticles from the previous phase. Therefore, they felt that the\ntime should be spent on getting more research done rather\nthan working on the first draft.\nOn Jumping Around the Phases of Writing:\nMy biggest challenge with this assignment is seeing the value in\nit. I would never choose to write a first draft before my research\nis anywhere near done. I feel as though my time could have been\nspent much better by focusing on doing more reading instead of\nputting my notes from one form into another. I bet that I have not\nhad enough time to process all the information I have gathered\nyet to make a coherent, well-thought-out first draft. Tardiness is\nmy worst enemy now. (Adam)\nOn Connecting With Their Own Teaching:\nWith my students we often talk about the writing process. Many\nstudents struggle to get their initial ideas down because of their\nperfectionist tendency. We talk about how a first draft does not\nneed to be perfect and I model for them the process; however,\nwhen it comes to my own work, I am occasionally guilty of not\npracticing what I preach. Writing the first draft helped to\nreinforce for me the fact that writing is a process. It is often only\nthrough the process of writing that you can discover what you\nwant to say and how you want to say it. (Sonia)\nWhat we learned from these reflections is that we must\nemphasize the importance of the timeline. All assignments\ndesigned for each phase of the writing process must be com-\npleted on time. We need to make it very clear to future stu-\ndents that any delayed completion of assignments for each\nphase will inevitably jeopardize the next phase's assignments\nand therefore affect the writing project negatively.\nPhase IV: Revising and Editing--Peer Mentoring\nTo assist teachers with their second draft, we first had them\nshare it in their groups, and then had the group members pro-\nvide suggestions using the stars and wishes method. Stars\nand wishes is a strategy used in K-12 classrooms to enhance\npeer feedback where students identify two positive aspects of\nthe work of a peer and then express a wish about what the\npeer might do to improve the work (Davies, Cameron,\nPolitano, & Gregory, 1992). We revisited the concept of\nlearning community during this phase (MacPhail, Patton,\nParker, & Tannehill, 2014). Although peer discussion and\nfeedback were routine activities, the revision and editing\nphase called for a higher sense of community learning. We\nset up the revision format as a self-selected two-person team.\nTo ensure the peer mentoring responsibility was fulfilled,\nchecklists were created for team members to follow and all\nfeedback from team members were recorded and evaluated.\nMore importantly, a series of short training sessions were run\nto prepare the teachers to ensure quality peer evaluation\n(Ferris, 2014). The stars and wishes strategy was welcomed\nby all teachers even though they knew the strategy was com-\nmonly used for younger students. The non-threatening nature\nof the strategy worked well with adult learners, too.\nThen, we did two mini lessons: (a) how to organize the\nresearch paper and (b) how to use transitional paragraphs,\nsentences, and words. Another round of intensive peer revi-\nsion and editing followed. Finally, we sent teachers to work\non their third draft.\nWhen reflecting on the most difficult part of writing for\nthis phase, the teachers' reflections fall into three themes.\nThey are (a) putting the ideas together and attempting to\nmake it flow using translational words, (b) struggling with\nthe whole notion of \"research writing\" in general, and (c)\nstaying on topic. They understood that they had made con-\nsiderable progress, but still had a long way to go; and they\nneeded to go back and reread some of the sources to find\nsome additional information even though it was already the\nsecond draft.\nOn the Importance of Revising and Editing:\nWhen I finished writing the first draft I was feeling really good\nabout myself. Little did I know, it wasn't that great. When\nI read back through it to revise and edit for my second draft,\nI found a lot of confusing parts and sections that needed to be\nreorganized. I found it helpful to do this editing and revising\non a hard copy rather than on the computer screen. I think that\nthe activity we did in class with regard to organizing sentences\nand paragraphs along with the mini-lesson on transition words\nwas very helpful. I thought of it a lot while reading through my\nfirst draft. (Leanne)\nOn APA Style and Paraphrasing:\nWhen citing in the text a source that has six authors, do I list\nthem all out as I do in the references? It seems like that is a lot to\nput in the paper. If you use a book that has a forward written by\nanother author, how do you cite it? (Adam)\nI understand the benefit of using so many references especially\nfor a research paper. It was also difficult at times to paraphrase a\nreference. They stated it so well that it was difficult to come up\nwith other wordings. (Ben)\nI have learned that having many references will help solidify the\npoints that I am trying to make in my paper. When more than one\nreference has a similar idea it makes the point stronger. (Adam)\nOn Connecting With Their Own Teaching:\nAt the beginning of this phase, to say I disliked revising and\nediting is an understatement. Upon completion, the result of two\nrevised drafts was shocking, in a positive way--I saw the\nimmense improvement in my latest draft. The improvement\nfrom the first draft stage to the next persuaded me to accept the\nsignificance of revising and editing. I have been wondering on\nhow I can teach these skills to my students. They will benefit\ntremendously if they master the skills. (Ben)\nTo assist teachers with their third draft, we first organized\npeer editing and revision. Then, we did a mini-lesson on the\nAPA style. Teachers found that the three most difficult parts\nof writing the third draft were (a) motivating themselves to\nsit down and read through the draft to make revisions, (b)\nverifying the reference pages, and (c) making sure that they\nhad everything for completing the draft. They learned that\nhaving a peer read their paper and offer suggestions was very\nhelpful, and that it was OK that they were still gathering\ninformation for the research part of the paper with the third\ndraft.\nOn the Benefits of Peer Revising and Editing:\nThrough the peer editing, I learned more about the use of\ntransitions. Dana pointed out that she knew what I was trying to\nsay, but there wasn't always a clear change in my words. She\nwas definitely right. As I read her notes and suggestions, I could\nsee that I abruptly ended and abruptly started without\ntransitioning. The transitions make the paper easy to read and\ndefinitely help with the flow of the material. (Sandy)\nWhat we learned from the reflection by the teachers and\nour observation is that there was a major switch in their con-\ncern. It was no longer about their topics; it became more\nabout the technicality and mechanics of the writing. The\nfocus was now on APA reference styles, transitional words,\nand filling in the gaps. We felt this was a natural develop-\nment of understanding of writing; they were ready to move\non to the next phase--publishing.\nPhase V: Finalizing and Sharing--Publishing\nPublishing is the last phase in the writing process. Publishing\ncarries different meanings. In a K-12 writing project, it could\nbe a printout and posting on the classroom walls or a printed\npaper brought home to parents. It could also be a digital pub-\nlication where the writings by students are published on the\nclass website or a digital newsletter. As a capstone project,\nteachers were required to have their final paper spiral bound\nand handed in to their instructor for filing. However, the key\nactivity in this phase is sharing. Sharing completes the cycle\nof process-based writing.\nWhen reflecting on the most difficult part of the final\nphase of writing, the teachers' reflections fall into two\nthemes. They are (a) finding it difficult to let go, because that\nwas the point of no return; they tended to double, triple, and\nquadruple check that everything was in the proper order and\n(b) realizing that the paper would never be perfect even with\nmore drafts and revisions. They learned that (a) a project of\nthis magnitude did not have to be overwhelming if you broke\nit down to sections and (b) they began to see the benefits of\npeer revising and editing, proving that writing was social and\ntook the whole village.\nOn Mechanical Issues:\nThe most difficult part of finalizing the report was again\ncarefully reading it all the way through checking for grammar\nmistakes, consistentAPAformat, and content flow. For example,\nI ended up changing the look of my section headlines because\nthey didn't match APA format. (Dana)\nI felt the most difficult part to finalizing my report involved\nmaking sure everything was perfect. I found myself reading the\npaper several times and checking for one thing at a time. First, I\nwould check to make sure all my sources were marked correctly;\nthe next time I was checking all the spaces. (Sara)\nThe most challenging part of finalizing my paper was making\nsure that I had all the topics covered that I wanted to cover.\nWhen I did my third draft, there were some pieces of information\nthat I hadn't included that I felt needed to be in the paper, but I\nwas unsure of where to put them. The peer revision and editing\nwas great. My partner read and discussed my paper and helped\nme determine where I could put the extra information since she\nhad a very fresh eye. It was very helpful to have the class as a\nlearning community. I should follow this practice in my own\nteaching. (Kendra)\nOn Understanding of the Writing Processes:\nI have learned that writing a research paper to this extent is a\nvery time consuming task. I really enjoyed breaking this major\nassignment up into several small assignments. It really helped\nme to stay on task and manage my time better. (Holly)\nI learned that a project this big doesn't have to be overwhelming.\nI struggle with planning and tend to procrastinate. I liked the\nway you broke down the process so I didn't have the opportunity\nto procrastinate. It took the planning out of my hands which was\nnice. (Angela)\nOn Connecting With Their Own Teaching:\nThe questions I have are more about myself as a learner and a\nteacher rather than about the writing process or final project.\nThis experience has caused me to think a lot about the struggling\nwriters I teach each year. (Andrea)\nI can really see the whole picture of process-based writing\napproach now. I appreciate its functionality. I will try this writing\ninstruction approach with my fifth graders. I expect my students\nto become better writers once they learn all the skills from the\nprocess-based approach to writing. (Angela)\nAt the conclusion of the process-based writers' workshop,\nteachers'perception of writing changed toward being positive,\nboth as a writer and teacher. Their reflections clearly indicated\nthat they had developed a much better understanding of\nthe writing process. They became much more tolerant of the\nambiguity in writing because they knew that even with pre-\nplanning and pre-writing, there would be uncertainty and only\nthe process would take care of the problems. One of the most\nrewarding benefits is that teachers reflected on how they began\nto understand the struggles their own students were having,\nand they were more confident in providing the students help.\nDiscussion and Recommendations\nQuantitative research in literature on process-based writing\napproaches tends to report positive or negative findings in\na relatively linear manner, as many such research studies\nwere reported in the meta-analysis by Graham and Perin\n(2007), and individual studies reported by Street and Stang\nlessons learned by our practicing teachers are phase-\nspecific. Findings from this qualitative research show more\ndetailed and in-depth descriptions of what happened to\nteachers in their learning and reflection in different phases\nof the writing process. This rich nuance is different from\nthe quantitative results. The challenges and solutions are\nunique for each phase, and best presented as phase-specific\nfindings.\nSpecifically, while teachers were faced with difficulties\nthroughout the process of writing, the foci of difficulties\nchanged with different phases. Therefore, different strategies\nwere necessary for instructors to provide assistance and\nsolve problems. For instance, a major obstacle at the begin-\nning of the writing project was that the majority of participat-\ning teachers (a) felt that they were not confident as writers,\nlet alone as effective writing teachers, (b) did not have a\nsoundunderstandingoftheprocess-basedwritingapproaches,\n(c) had little or no personal experience in writing research\npapers using the process-based writing model, and (d) real-\nized that their teacher education programs and professional\ndevelopment targeted mainly the subject areas of reading\nbut not writing. An effective approach was to create a user-\nfriendly learning community where the participants could\nexpress their concerns and be encouraged to get their feet\nwet by embracing the process-based writing approach.\nAfter accepting the process-based writing approach as a\nnew way of learning to write, the participating teachers\nimmediately ran into difficulty finding topics for their\nresearch as required in Phase I: Topics and Questions--\nGenerate Ideas. The cause behind the difficulty was the\nlack of knowledge on different educational topics. To some\nextent, it had less to do with writing abilities than subject\nand content knowledge. The solution varied with different\nstudents in locating topics. Personal needs and concerns\ntend to be good starting points. One such example is the\nissue of literacy assessment that had bothered one student\nfor over a year. With some discussion in a small group of\nclassmates and some guidance from the instructor, she\ndeveloped this concern into a research topic with many pos-\nsible aspects for investigation. Another effective way to\ngenerate writing topics was to bring to class a textbook of\neducational issues like the one written by James Noll\n(2014), Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Educational\nIssues. The book listed more than 23 critical educational\nissues ranging from learning theories and standardized tests\nto merit pay for teachers. The issues expanded teachers'\nvisions and were valuable in helping them choose one or\ntwo to work on; moreover, the issues in the book activated\nstudents' thinking processes and the students further devel-\noped their own topics. Another useful resource book used\nwas Issues and Trends in Literacy Education by Robinson\nIn contrast, the major obstacles faced during Phase II:\nSources and Syntheses--Building Knowledge involved find-\ning quality journal articles; the solution was to use a differ-\nent search database and various combinations of key words\nand terms--more a technical issue than academic. The\nsecond part of Phase II is on synthesizing the journal arti-\ncles, a key component of the process-based writing in\nbuilding participant's knowledge. The strategy was to let\nthe teachers see the learning objectives of synthesizing\ninformation mirroring the writing tasks of the Common\nCore State Standards--writing from multiple sources.\nParticipants' reflections became positive and enthusiastic,\nindicating a feeling of strong connection between the writ-\ning task at hand and their own teaching of writing in K-12\nclassrooms.\nWhen the teachers were writing the draft in Phase III:\nPutting It Together, the strategy was to model how the syn-\nthesized information in I-Charts could be transferred into\nan overall, detailed outline (Appendix C). A well-written\ndetailed outline performed as a roadmap, leading them from\nPoint A to Point B. However, incomplete I-charts for this\nphase will inevitably jeopardize the next phase's assign-\nments and therefore affect the writing project negatively.\nWhen revising and editing in Phase IV: Revising and\nEditing: Peer Mentoring, teachers learned to trust their\nlearning community because they saw the value of the psy-\nchological support and expertise support. Their reflections\nprovided strong evidence that when they benefited\nfrom their peer revision and editing, they tended to con-\ntribute more and take the peer revision and editing more\nseriously.\nWhen the teachers reached Phase V: Finalizing and\nSharing, their mindset was very different from the early\nphases. They were more relaxed, more tolerant, and more\npositive toward revisions. They understood that their paper\nwas not perfect and that there were areas for improvement--\na concept that might have disturbed some teachers if men-\ntioned at the first phase. The participating teachers (a)\ndeveloped a deep understanding of the process-based writing\napproach; (b) learned new skills of planning, drafting, revis-\ning, editing, and sharing; (c) were more confident as writers\nthemselves and as writing teachers for their students; and (d)\nplanned to use writing process-based approach in their own\nteaching.\nThe process-based writing workshop approach success-\nfully provided the teachers with first-hand experience that\nwriting was recursive and that revision and editing did not\njust happen at the end of the first draft. In the second and\nthird phases, when teachers began to dig deep into their top-\nics, they found some dead ends and some new roads and\ndirections they did not see in the first two phases. Their\nreflections clearly indicate their deepening understanding of\nthe ongoing revision process and they became comfortable\nrefocusing their research topics. Two of the teachers even\nrestarted with completely new topics and did so with a high\nlevel of confidence and efficiency.\nResearch writing is underemphasized in both undergrad-\nuate and graduate-level teacher education courses. Teachers\nare underprepared to be writers and writing teachers, par-\nticularly in research writing and teaching. To ensure that\nK-12 teachers are competent to teach future generations,\nteacher education programs need to provide courses for\ngraduate students not only for learning how to teach writ-\ning but experiencing writing themselves (Kaiser, 2013;\nexperience the struggles and the lessons learned (Kittle,\n2008). In these courses, we need to provide opportunities\nwhere graduate students are actively involved in plan-\nning, drafting, revising, editing, and sharing as their own\nstudents will be doing. Only then can we expect our grad-\nuate students to be confident research writers themselves\nand competent teachers of research writing for their stu-\ndents. Their reflections in different phases indicate that\nthey saw many detailed connections between their learning\nexperiences in the course and the struggle their students\nhave in learning writing. The participating teachers\nexpressed strong desire and intent on how they would\napply the different strategies to their own teaching,\nemphasizing the strategies of writing based on the infor-\nmation from sources to meet the Common Core State\nStandards for writing.\nThe following recommendations are for both the writing\ninstructors and students for academic research paper writing\nusing the process-based approach:\n1. Every graduate-level education course should have\na writing component, either a position paper, syn-\nthesis paper, or research paper, so that in-service\nteachers can experience what their students are\nexperiencing.\n2. The writing instruction needs to be both process and\ngenre based. Graduate-level education courses should\nprovide a conducive environment where the in-\nservice teachers are actively involved in the writing\nprocess to inform, to persuade, and to convey experi-\nence as required by the Common Core State Standards\n3. In-service teachers should experience planning, gath-\nering and synthesizing sources, drafting, revising,\nediting, and publishing to have a deep understanding\nof the writing process.\n4. Teacher education professors should model each\nphase of the writing process as teachers will do in\ntheir K-12 classrooms so that practicing teachers will\nlearn to handle challenges related to different writing\nphases.\n5. Teacher education professors should encourage\nin-service teachers to write for their school district\nprofessional development, for their professional\norganization conferences, or for professional journals\nwith authentic audiences, purposes, and tasks instead\nof writing for professors only.\nFinally, there are two levels of caveats associated with\nthe recommendations. The first level is related to the nature\nof the research methods and the number of participants for\nthe study. The findings and recommendations are based on\nthe interpretation of the qualitative data collected by the\nauthors of the study, and the study involved a relatively\nsmall number of participants. The second level is that\ndespite the effectiveness of the process-based writing\napproach described in this study, the sample in this study\nrepresented a group of native English speakers with a U.S.\neducational background. They are not representative of\ntheir counterparts in other countries in terms of their pre-\nparedness and performance. Therefore, cautions are called\nfor when considering the recommendations of the present\nstudy.\nAppendix A\nA Sample Assignment and Reflection Sheet on\nWriting a Capstone Question\nWrite a capstone question based on the following checklist:\n1. I have one or two lead sentences introducing my topic.\n2. I have the following four questions related to my topic:\na. definition/dimensions/principles\nb. research support\nc. challenges/needs/issues\nd. solutions/strategies/applications\nReflect on your capstone question writing experience:\n1. What is the most difficult part of writing the capstone\nquestion and why?\n2. What have you learned?\n3. What questions do you still have?\nAppendix B\nA Sample Inquiry Chart.\nCapstone question: Critical literacy--A critical component in literacy development\n What is critical literacy?\nWhy is critical literacy\nimportant? What are the challenges? What are the solutions?\nliteracy: Foundational\nnotes. Theory Into\nThe term critical\nliteracy refers to use\nof the technologies of\nprint and other media\nof communication to\nanalyze, critique, and\ntransform the norms,\nrule systems, and\npractices governing\nthe social fields of\neveryday life.\nIt is a key element of\neducation against\ncultural exclusion and\nmarginalization with\na commitment to the\ninclusion of working class,\ncultural and linguistic\nminorities, indigenous\nlearners, and others\nmarginalized on the basis\nof gender, sexuality, or\nother forms of difference.\nAlthough Freirian\nmodels provide a\npedagogical approach\nand a political stance,\nthey lack specificity\non how teachers and\nstudents can engage\nwith the complex\nstructures of texts,\nboth traditional and\nmultimodal.\nEnable teachers and\nstudents to focus on\nhow words, grammar,\nand discourse choices\nshape a version of\nmaterial, natural, and\nsociopolitical worlds.\nEnable a critical\nengagement with the\nquestion of where texts\nare used, by whom, and\nin whose interests.\nAppendix C\nA Fully Developed Outline\nCritical Literacy\nI.
