This study aimed at comparing\nthe level of shyness, self-construal, and personality traits of extraversion, introversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism among\nthe college students from India, the host country, Africa; Iran; and Maldives, and Tibetan refugees in India (TRI), studying in\ndifferent colleges at Mysore, India. Two hundred students (100 men and 100 women), age ranging from 17 to 30 years, were\nrecruited based on stratified random sampling and were administered the Henderson/Zimbardo Shyness Questionnaire,\nFernandez Scale of Independent\u00adInterdependent Self-Construal, and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire\u00adRevised. The results\nshowed that shyness was significantly correlated with high introversion and high neuroticism scores. The results also showed\nthat level of shyness varies significantly across different cultural groups and students from Maldives showed highest level of\nshyness whereas Iranian students had the lowest level of shyness. Although there was no significant gender difference, TRI\nmales and Maldivian females had higher scores on shyness. Faith Orientation did not differentiate the prevalence of shyness\namong students of the different cultural groups. Shyness may be influenced by the culture from which one hails, and its level\nmay vary depending on the nurturance.\n",

It is a blend of fear that is\nuniversally manifested across cultures (Weiner & Craighead,\n2010). Shyness leads to inhibition among people and hinders\nthe process of achieving healthy interpersonal relationships\nand professional goals (Henderson, Zimbardo, & Carducci,\n2001). A shy individual tends to focus on self and is preoc-\ncupied with thoughts of his own (Crozier, 2002). Shyness is\na psychological state that causes feelings of discomfort, lead-\ning to avoidance of social contact. Cheek, Melchior, and\nCarpentieri (1986) defined it as \". . . the tendency to feel\ntense, worried or awkward during social interactions, espe-\ncially with unfamiliar people\" (p. 115).\nShyness and sociability are two distinct personality traits\n(Cheek & Buss, 1981). The degree of these varies from mild\nsocial awkwardness to totally inhibiting social phobia\n(Henderson & Zimbardo, 1998). In another study, Henderson\net al. (2001) reported that manifestation of shyness occurs at\nvarious levels varying from cognitive level (e.g., excessive\nnegative evaluation of self), affective level (e.g., feelings of\nanxiety), physiological level (e.g., arousal of sympathetic\nnervous system) to behavioral level (e.g., failure to respond\nappropriately), and may also be caused by various other situ-\national cues. Some of the physical symptoms associated with\nshyness include blushing, sweating, a pounding heart or\nupset stomach, negative feelings about oneself, worries\nabout how others view them, and a tendency to withdraw\nfrom social interactions.\nShy behavior could be triggered by a wide variety of\narousal cues (Henderson & Zimbardo, 1998). An individual\nmay feel shy while interacting with strangers or an authorita-\ntive figure, while initiating conversation in a group setting,\nor in performing a social action in unstructured group\n1Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeswara University, Mysuru, India\n2University of Mysore, India\nCorresponding Author:\nLeister Sam Sudheer Manickam, Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeswara\nEmail: lssmanickam@gmail.com\nShyness, Self-Construal,\nExtraversion\u00adIntroversion, Neuroticism,\nand Psychoticism: A Cross-Cultural\nComparison Among College Students\nAmbreen Afshan1, Iman Askari2,\nand Leister Sam Sudheer Manickam1\n Keywords\nshyness, self-construal, extraversion\u00adintroversion, neuroticism, cross-cultural\n2 SAGE Open\nsettings (D'Souza, Gowda, & Gowda, 2006). It could also be\ncaused when the individual has to develop a relationship\nespecially with individuals of opposite gender, in a one-\nto-one situation (Natesha & D'Souza, 2008). Metaphorically,\nshyness could be considered as shrinking back from life that\nweakens the bonds of human connections (Henderson &\nZimbardo, 2010) affecting one's mind, body, and self as a\nShy people are reported to be self-conscious and resist\npleasures because they believe that they tune out from the\nsocial matrix (Schlenker & Weigold, 1990). To relate with\nothers, they find the computer-mediated communication to\nbe easier means than the face-to-face contact (Chan, 2011).\nThe privately self-conscious shy people emphasize more on\npersonal identity, whereas those who are publicly self-con-\nscious emphasize on conformity, social identity, and social\ntrepidations (Wojslawowicz, 2005). Shy individuals prefer to\ncreate an identity of being autonomous and will monitor and\ncontrol their self-presentations to construct a shy image for\naudiences. However, the privately shy people control their\nshy behavior and attitudes in public to protect their auton-\nomy. Individuals with shyness are aware of their own absence\nof social skills (Creed & Funder, 1998). As a result, they\navoid involving in social relationships and subsequent lone-\nliness is high among them (Jackson, Soderlind, & Weiss,\nalso found that high levels of shyness and low levels of\nsociability are related to high levels of loneliness.\nShyness and Gender\nGender differences in shyness among male and female were\nreported by several studies (Crozier, 1995; La Greca &\ntext, shyness is considered to be the quality of women, and if\nany one lacks modesty and possesses more of a masculine\ncharacter, then she is considered to be a bold, brash, and non-\nfeminine being (Sinha, 2011). However, in a recent study by\nAfshan, D'Souza, and Manickam (2014), no significant dif-\nference was found between adolescent boys and girls who\nstayed in hostels and those who lived with their parents.\nStudying the level of shyness of population from different\ncountries, Henderson and Zimbardo (1998) found no gender\ndifference and opined that men may have learnt typical tac-\ntics to conceal shyness as they regard it as a feminine trait.\nShyness, Anxiety, and Phobia\nThere are several other variables that are studied in relation\nto shyness. Clinically, shy individuals are reported to be\nmore prone to depression and anxiety (Crozier, 1995), and\nthey experience more amount of fear in their lives as well\n(D'Souza et al., 2006). Several studies found positive corre-\nlation between shyness and social phobia (Chavira, Stein, &\nthat shy people with social phobia are more introverts and\nneurotics than the shy people without social phobia.\nSignificant correlations were also found between shyness\nand personality traits (Ebeling-Witte, Frank, & Lester, 2007).\nShyness and Personality Traits\nEysenck, Eysenck, and Barrett (1985) opined that an extro-\nvert always tries to seek excitement in a social activity to\nheighten the arousal level, whereas an introvert prefers to\nkeep such arousals at minimum level and hence they avoid\nthe social situations. Due to this behavior, they are recog-\nnized as shy people and the terms introversion and shyness\nare often used interchangeably in everyday language (Briggs,\n1988). But as a construct, shyness is conceptually distinct\nfrom the well-known dimensions of Extraversion (E),\nIntroversion (I), and Neuroticism (N) (Crozier, 1995). Shy\nindividuals experience uncomfortable feelings of self, espe-\ncially in social situations. Introverts may appear to be shy,\nbecause their desire to interact with others is low; however,\nthey are not worried about what others think of them and are\nconfident about their quietness (Asendorpf & Meier, 1993;\npersonality theory, explained that impulsive behavior as\nshown by an individual could be due to the arousal of\nBehavioral Activation System (BAS), whereas behaviors\nof anxiety and inhibition are manifested due to activation of\nBehavioral Inhibition System (BIS). Hence, individuals\nwhose BAS is motivated are more impulsive and outgoing,\nwhereas an individual who is motivated by BIS could experi-\nence shyness and anxiety.\nThe Concept of Self\nThe concept of self is a dynamic center of awareness, emo-\ntions, judgment, and actions that are organized into a distinc-\ntive whole and are set contrastively, against social and natural\nbackground (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). The self of an indi-\nvidual varies greatly depending on one's own culture (Rhee,\nUleman, Lee, & Roman, 1995). From the Western perspec-\ntive, self is composed of individual attributes such as ambi-\ntions, good humor, and extravert qualities (Trafimow,\nferentiated two kinds of self: independent and interdepen-\ndent. The independent self is viewed as a bounded entity. It is\nmore or less integrated, unique, and motivational. However,\nthe interdependent self is a sense of self that is more flexible\nand is connected to the social context that emphasizes on\nopined that these two images of self can coexist among indi-\nviduals and they can be measured. People can best distin-\nguishtheirownselfbydiscoveringuniquetalents(Kanagawa,\nCross, & Markus, 2001). Fernandez, Paez, and Gonzalez\n(2005) reported that less interdependent quality and more\nAfshan et al. 3\nindependent self-construal are characteristics that are more\ntypical of hierarchical cultures than of individualism.\nMoreover, high interdependent quality and low independent\nself-construal are characteristics more highly present in egal-\nitarian cultures than in collectivist cultures.\nThe research in the West conceptualized self as an inde-\npendent functioning unit and defined independence as a fun-\ndamental task of socialization. However, people with\ninterdependent self perceived themselves as a part of an\nencompassing social relationship (Kitayama, 1992).\nAlthough the interdependent self is regarded as possessing a\nset of internal qualities such as abilities and opinions of one-\nself, these attributes are thought to be situation specific as\nwell as unstable rather than defining it as the characteristic of\nself (Bochner, 1994). The self becomes meaningful and com-\nplete only within the context of social relationship rather\nthan in relation to independent and autonomous actions.\nThus, interdependent self is not a bounded structure; instead\nit changes its structure with regard to the nature of social\ncontext (Kanagawa et al., 2001). The interdependent self was\nrelated to cooperative cultural values, and the independent\nself had more links to competitive cultures (Fernandez et al.,\nCulture and Shyness\nMany researchers have reported that shyness varies across\ndifferent cultures (Aizawa & Whatley, 2006; Chen, &\n& Bhaskara, 2004). Shyness is considered to be a negative\ntrait in the Western countries (Weisz et al., 1993). Studies\nconducted in China showed that shyness is positively corre-\nlated with peer acceptance in the age group of 8 to 10 years\n(Chen, Rubin, & Sun, 1992). However, when they compared\nwith Canadian children of the same ages (Chen et al., 1992),\npeer acceptance was negatively correlated with shyness. In\nSouth Asian countries, shyness is considered to be a boon\nbecause the societies expect to control oneself in front of oth-\ners and to respect social rank of others (Weisz et al., 1993).\nCarducci and Zimbardo (1995) studied shyness across cul-\ntures, including participants from India, Canada, Germany,\nIsrael, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan. They found that the\nextent of population experiencing shyness varied from 31%\nto 55%. In India, as per the study, shyness was found to be\nprevalent at 47%. The lowest was experienced in Israel and\nthe highest was reported in Japan.\nSeveral cross-cultural studies had shown the direct effects\nof culture on shyness (Carducci & Zimbardo, 1995; Kerr,\nStockli, 2002). The cultural context also influences the con-\nnection between shyness, scholastic achievement, and social\npopularity, as well as parental education among students\ncultural differences in shyness made a distinction between col-\nlectivistic cultures and individual cultures. Collectivist culture\npromotes esteem of the group over that of the individual. As a\nresult, it fosters self-consciousness and shyness. In one of the\nrecent research conducted in India, Sinha (2011) observed that\nthe self-conscious and inhibited behaviors observed in shy\nindividuals are induced due to the cultural factors.\nThe present study attempted to compare the level of shy-\nness among individuals of various cultural groups: Indians,\nthe host; Africans; Iranians; Maldivians; and Tibetan refu-\ngees in India (TRI). It also attempted to measure whether\nage, gender, faith orientation, and other socio-demographic\nvariables have any relationship with shyness, self-construal,\nextraversion, introversion, and neuroticism. How far shyness\nis related to variables of extraversion, introversion, and neu-\nroticism, as well as its relation to the level of independence\nor interdependence, is also explored.\nIn the present study, shyness is operationally defined as a\npsychological state that leads to feelings of discomfort,\nresulting in avoidance of social encounters, especially with\nstrangers and is culturally determined.\nMethod\nSample\nA total of 200 participants from five different cultural groups\nstudying at degree level in four different colleges of Mysore\ncity in India were selected using purposive sampling. Among\nAfricans,1 30 Maldivians, and 30 of them were TRI. Whereas\nthe TRI group was born and brought up in India, the partici-\npants from other nations have come to India for their educa-\ntional purpose and have been in India only from the past 1 to\n2 years. The sample was matched for gender, and they\nbelonged to the age group of 17 to 30 years. The mean age\nyears (SD = 3.64), respectively. The participants belonged to\ndifferent faith orientations as follows: 31 Hindus, 76\nMuslims, 55 Christians, 30 Buddhists, and the remaining 8\ndid not mention their faith orientation. Regarding the educa-\ntional course, 103 participants were studying arts subjects,\nwhereas 97 were pursuing science subjects.\nMeasures\nThe English versions of following scales were group admin-\nistered to the participants:\nHenderson/Zimbardo Shyness Questionnaire.The 35-items\nquestionnaire (Henderson & Zimbardo, 2001) measures the\nlevel of shyness quotient (shy Q) experienced by individuals.\nThe items are to be rated on a 5-point rating scale ranging\nfrom 1 to 5. A score of 1 indicated low level of shyness and a\nscore of 5 indicated high level of shyness.

This tool measures the\ninterdependent and independent quality of an individual. The\nitems of both the interdependent scale (group loyalty and\nrelational interdependence) and the independent scale\n(uniqueness and low context) are grouped into two factors.\nItems were rated using a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (totally\ndisagree) to 4 (totally agree). The reliability of the scale was\nreported to be .61 for group loyalty, .39 for relational interde-\npendence, .51 for uniqueness, and .37 for low context.\nEysenck Personality Questionnaire\u00adRevised (EPQ-R).This is a\nrevised over a period of 50 years (Francis, Lewis, & Ziebertz,\n2006). It measures extraversion, introversion, neuroticism,\nand psychoticism. This is a reliable research tool that is vali-\ndated in the Indian population (Abraham & Varghese, 1990),\nand both vernacular as well as English versions are used for\nResults\nThe socio-demographic data of the sample are shown in\nTable 1. One-way ANOVA was conducted between depen-\ndent variables (shyness, extraversion, introversion, neuroti-\ncism, psychoticism, and independent\u00adinterdependent\nself-construal) and independent variables (culture, age, gen-\nder, education, and faith orientation). The variables that were\nsignificant in one-way ANOVA were further subjected to\ntwo-way analysis to determine the interaction effect between\nthem. There was no significant difference observed in rela-\ntion to faith orientation.\nAs observed in Table 2, the level of shyness varied signifi-\nnificantly high levels of shyness compared with the partici-\npants from other nations.

A positive correlation was also found between inde-\npendent self-construal with relational interdependence (r =\nDiscussion\nThe study was intended to find the differences in shyness\nlevels of the students from different cultural groups and\nfound that Maldivian students were shyer compared with the\nstudents of other cultural groups under study. Hofstede\n(1983) viewed that every nation provides a symbolic value to\nits inhabitant and every individual derives their identity from\nthis symbolic value. This identity among them creates a\nsense of belongingness toward their nation, and it also affects\ntheir thoughts. The diversity in their thoughts may be affected\nby early life experiences in family, differences in family\nbackground, and parenting (Aunola & Nurmi, 2005), as well\nas the later educational experiences in schools and organiza-\ntions, which are not same across the national borders\n(Hofstede, 1983). Apart from these factors, differences\nwithin the culture may also play a role, directly or indirectly,\nin inducing shyness.\nAs shyness interferes in every aspect of an individual's\nlife, its existence has direct effects even in selecting the\ncourses of education (Woolnough, 1994), as well as on the\nacademic and scholastic performances (D'Souza, Urs, &\nJayaraju, 2008). The present study revealed that the partici-\npants belonging to science courses were shyer and less extro-\nverts compared with those studying arts courses.

Kitayama,\nKarasawa, Curhan, Ryff, and Markus (2010) reported that\nthe age factor affects both the independent and interdepen-\ndent self-construal. However, we found that the age factor\nslightly affected the thoughts of independent self-construal\nbut not the interdependent self-construal. The same observa-\ntion was made by previous research (Matsumoto, 1999). He\nobserved that interdependence is the quality found among\npeople living in collectivist culture and their thoughts were\nnot affected by the age factor. They prefer to be interdepen-\ndent and create a sense of oneness within them. However,\npeople of independent cultures create a sense of indepen-\ndence within themselves with their growing age and experi-\nences of life.\nIndependent\u00adinterdependent self-construal was not found\nto vary among the different cultures. The probable explana-\ntion is that when students are exposed to a culture other than\ntheir own, they try to change their thinking and behavior\naccording to the requirements of new environment, which\nleads to similarities in the ideas and thoughts of the host cul-\nture (Cross & Madson, 1997). Probably, the new environ-\nment demands team building qualities of the students that\nwould have helped them excel in extracurricular activities\nand academically. Furthermore, the prior knowledge about\nthe culture of the host country guides them to accept the dif-\nferences in the values, beliefs, and principles of that culture\nleading to being independent.\nIt was found that shyness was negatively correlated with\nextraversion and positively correlated with neuroticism.\nSeveral studies also found that the low levels of inherent shy-\nness are significantly related to high levels of extraversion\nBennett, 1992). One of the studies conducted among physi-\ncal education students in India also found shyness to be posi-\ntively related to neuroticism. The outgoing potentials of\nextraverts are not present in shy individuals who find it very\ndifficult, even to start a conversation and to maintain it. It is\nalso possible that those with high extraversion and having\nmore independent self-construal may have desired to leave\ntheir home country and dared to study in a nation that is cul-\nturally different from their own.\nLimitations\nThe findings of the study cannot be generalized because ade-\nquate representation was not given to the different cultural\ngroups. The TRI sample included in the study grew up in\nIndia, and hence, they would have imbibed the cultural val-\nues and may possess similar qualities as that of the Indian\nparticipants. Probably, using a measurement tool to assess\nthe cultural values would have helped differentiate between\nthe cultural groups.\nAnother limitation was that the cultural group that repre-\nsented Africa had participants from different nations of the\nAfrican continent, which in fact may be a divergent group in\nitself. Considering the participants from different nations\nfrom a continent as a single group may also have vitiated this\nparticular group. Future studies may be conducted compar-\ning the present study variables of students who are studying\nin India with their counterparts who are in their home\ncountries.\nConclusion\nThe present study found that shyness varies within different\ncultural groups and could be influenced by the culture from\nwhich an individual hails. However, the faith orientation to\nwhich one belongs does not influence the level of shyness.\nTable 5.

E = Extraversion; I = Introversion; N = Neuroticism.\nAfshan et al. 7\nThere are no gender differences found, and the gender differ-\nences that were reported earlier do not exist now. The persis-\ntence of shyness affects one's personality trait and ideas of\nself, making him or her appear to be neurotic and withdrawn,\neven though the shy individual wishes to be more socially\nactive. Probably, when an individual migrates from his or her\nnative to other countries for the purpose of education, he or\nshe learns to be independent and less shy.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
