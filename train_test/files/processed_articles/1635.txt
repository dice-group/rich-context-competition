Obesity, es-\npecially abdominal and central adiposity,\nas measured herein by waist circumfer-\nence (WC), is often linked to insulin re-\nsistance and other diagnostic correlates of\nmetabolic syndrome: elevated triglycer-\nide concentrations, low high-density li-\npoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concen-\ntrations, elevated blood pressure (BP), and\nelevated fasting glucose concentrations.\nThese 5 factors appear to be closely allied\nwith increased risk of developing type 2\ndiabetes mellitus and cardiovascular dis-\neases. When a person is found to have any\n3 of the 5 component risk factors, con-\ncern grows, warranting a diagnosis of meta-\nbolic syndrome (MetS).2-5 Although con-\nflicting opinions have been reported\nconcerning the diagnostic value of MetS,6,7\nthe concept provides a readily measured\nset of criteria that could lead to more in-\ntense clinical focus on the underlying\ncauses and thereby reinforces the utility\nof lifestyle changes and perhaps addi-\ntional clinical interventions.8 Our argu-\nment is that several cardiometabolic risk\nfactors within 1 individual, even at sub-\nclinical levels that would trigger tradi-\ntional treatment options, predict future\nprogression to overt chronic disease. Thus,\nMetS may be a sentinel marker for high-\nlighting the need for more aggressive in-\ntervention efforts beyond the traditional\ntreatmentoptionsforoverweightandobese\nyouths.\nAccording to recent estimates, MetS af-\nfects, depending on the definition, 21% to\nAuthor Affiliations: Pennington\nBiomedical Research Center,\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

The cut-off values give rise\nto conflicting definitions and prevalences of MetS in ado-\nlescents. Cook et al10,11 investigated 4 previously re-\nported definitions of adolescent MetS that included ap-\nplication of adult cutoffs in addition to 3 sets of modified\ncutoffs. These definitions led to disparate estimates, rang-\ning from 2.0% to 9.4%, for the prevalence of adolescent\nMetS. As shown in Figure 1, other studies have also re-\nported instabilities in prevalence estimates as different di-\nagnostic criteria are invoked.22\nThe cardiovascular risk related to MetS appears to travel\nfrom childhood to young adulthood.23-25 A better under-\nstanding of the determinants of MetS during adolescence\nmightprovideinsightsintopreventiveinterventionsforim-\nproving health outcomes during adolescence and reduc-\ning the incidence of cardiovascular disease in adults.

The data were obtained as part of\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES). The NHANES is an ongoing sample survey that\nuses a complex, multistage, stratified geographic area design\nfor collecting nationally representative data from the nonin-\nstitutionalized US population. Newly collected data are re-\nleased in 2-year increments. The survey uses trained person-\nnel to conduct home interviews for collecting reliable data that\ninclude demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-\nrelated information. Medical personnel obtain medical, den-\ntal, and physiological measurements as well as results from labo-\nratory tests. A detailed description of these assessments has been\npublished previously.26\nThe study sample is composed of data pooled from 3 waves\nwere retained for analysis of 2859 adolescents who had com-\nplete data for all 5 component variables used to diagnose MetS.\nIn addition, adolescents were excluded if their ethnicity was\nnot Hispanic, white, or black (n=130); they did not have a value\nfor the sample weight (n=204); they were currently pregnant\n(n=59); or they reported being previously diagnosed as hav-\ning diabetes or were currently taking medication classified as\na blood-glucose regulator, such as insulin (n=10). Thus, 403\nadolescents did not meet the inclusion criteria, bringing the fi-\nyears of Hispanic, white, or black ethnicity.\nParticipants were required to come to the mobile examina-\ntion clinic before 9 AM after fasting for at least 9 hours. If\nthey arrived having fasted for less than 8.5 hours, they were\nassigned a sampling weight equal to 0 as part of the\nNHANES protocol. This reduced the sample size for our\nanalysis by 204 participants. Waist circumference was mea-\nsured to the nearest 0.1 cm at minimal respiration at the end\nof normal expiration with a steel measuring tape placed at\nthe high point of the iliac crest when the participant was in a\nstanding position. Diastolic and systolic BP measurements\nwere obtained using replicated measurements. After resting\nquietly in a sitting position for 5 minutes and determination\nof the maximum inflation level, up to 4 consecutive BP read-\nings were obtained with a mercury manometer. Mean values\nof replicate systolic and diastolic measurements provided\nestimates of current BP levels. Glucose concentration was\ndetermined by a hexokinase method, triglyceride concentra-\ntion was measured enzymatically using a series of coupled re-\nactions, and HDL-C concentration was measured directly.26\nUnfortunately, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion have issued an advisory regarding making inferences\nthat specific measurements may be overestimated by a mean\nof 3 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by\nIn this communication, adolescents were classified as having\nMetS if they had any 3 of the following: a WC in the 90th per-\nIII data27; either systolic or diastolic BP in the 90th percentile\nfor their height, age, and sex as previously specified28; triglyc-\neride concentration of 110 mg/dL or greater (to convert to\nmillimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113); HDL-C concentra-\ntion of 40 mg/dL or less; and glucose concentration of 100\nmg/dL or greater (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply\nPrevalence of MetS, %\nNHANES database (nationally representative sample)\nOther databases\nFigure 1.

An estimated 2.2% of males\nvs 0.9% of females had simultaneous disorders for WC\nand triglyceride, HDL-C, and glucose concentrations;\namong those with MetS, this figure rises to 20.4% and\n14.8% in males and females, respectively.\nWith examination of the prevalence of individual com-\nponents of MetS in adolescents who have any distinct com-\nbination of 3 or more components, it appears that el-\nevated BP does not play a primary role in early onset of\nthis syndrome (Figure 2). Among Hispanic and white\nadolescents, prevalence is prominent for disorders in WC,\ntriglycerides, and HDL-C, which seem to be the most in-\nfluential contributors to the diagnosis of MetS in both\nsexes, with glucose concentration having some degree\nof importance in males. Although black females demon-\nstrated a moderately high prevalence of central adipos-\nity, a leading driver of MetS was not found in black ado-\nlescents.\nCOMMENT\nOur findings affirm others' conclusion that the preva-\nlence of impaired biomarkers for early-onset metabolic\nabnormalities represents a legitimate health concern. The\nreported prevalence of MetS in adolescents living in the\nUnited States has varied widely from study to study (10%-\n21%).

Al-\nthough WC was slightly elevated in black adolescents,\nnone of the individual components of MetS stood out sig-\nnificantly as determinants of the syndrome. Overall, BP\nmade only a minor contribution to MetS; this result is\nconsistent with results of a previous study in European,\nAfrican, and Cuban American adults aged 25 to 44 years\nin whom insulin resistance, obesity, and lipid factors most\nstrongly represented MetS.30 We observed a low preva-\nlence of MetS in black adolescents of both sexes, but preva-\nlence of large WCs stood out only slightly in females, and\noverall we did not find a pattern of WC or any other spe-\ncific components driving the diagnosis of MetS.\nPediatric MetS has been reported to predict adult MetS\nand type 2 diabetes mellitus.19 In adults, as in adoles-\ncents, the epidemiology of MetS is unclear because the\ndiagnostic definition lacks consensus of scientific opin-\nions; hence, the implications of disparities among preva-\nlence estimates have often been conflicting.9 We found\nprevalence to be highest in Hispanic adolescents (males\nhigher than females) followed by white adolescents (males\nsignificantly higher than females) and black adoles-\ncents (males only slightly lower than females). This rela-\ntively high prevalence of MetS in Hispanic and white ado-\nlescents and the conflicting low prevalence in black\nadolescents has been recently observed by others.10-12 Al-\nthough the low prevalence of MetS among black indi-\nviduals during adolescence would be expected to trans-\nlate to a subsequent lower risk of developing\ncomorbidities, prevalence has been found to be high in\nblack compared with white adults for hypertension, dia-\nbetes, and cardiovascular disease.31 The prevalence of MetS\nwas found to be very high among adult black partici-\npants in the Jackson Heart Study; moreover, elevated BP,\nlarge WC, and low HDL-C were each highly prevalent\namong those with MetS.32\nA natural hypothesis is that the sequence of events lead-\ning to definitive MetS begins with the development of obe-\nsity and/or insulin resistance then continues by taking\nmany alternate pathways until metabolic irregularities\nevolve into life-threatening diseases. We found that many\nadolescents were not obese and yet had impairments in\n1 or more of the following 4 components: BP, triglycer-\nides, HDL-C, and glucose (Table 3). That many adoles-\ncents develop other metabolic disorders before they be-\ncome centrally obese suggests that there may be additional\norigins of MetS. On the other hand, our definition of large\nWC may be too conservative in relation to identifying\nrisk of metabolic disorder, so that overweight adoles-\ncents who are below our cut-off point for central obe-\nsity may be at risk for impaired triglyceride, HDL-C, and\nglucose concentrations. Also, some adolescents may be\nobese overall without being centrally obese. However, the\nhigh correlation between body mass index and WC found\nin our investigation as well as in a previous study (r=0.94\nand r=0.93, respectively) does not support this hypoth-\nesis.33 Using the 95th percentile for body mass index as\nthe threshold criterion for obesity, we found the overall\nprevalence of MetS to be 8.3% (a value that is compa-\nrable with the prevalence of high WC [8.6%]). Using body\nmass index rather than WC as the criterion for deter-\nmining obesity, we observed that the revised prevalence\nadolescents. There is evidence that additional cardio-\nmetabolic risk due to obesity in adults is minimal once\nthe risk attributable to having an excessively large WC\nis accounted for.34 Furthermore, poor cardiorespiratory\nfitness may place many at metabolic risk,35 and fitness\nmay play a role even in those who are not obese.\nThe cross-sectional data in this NHANES study pro-\nhibit a direct calculation of disease incidence and there-\nfore we cannot make direct comparisons among sub-\ngroups regarding risk of developing MetS. Because specific\nmeasurements of HDL-C may have been overestimated\nthat low concentrations of HDL-C are in the direction\nof impairment, the prevalence data for HDL-C and MetS\nmay be underestimated in our analysis. The data also limit\nour ability to investigate the time in which specific in-\ndividuals develop disorders in the criteria used to clas-\nsify adolescents with respect to MetS prevalence. Fur-\nthermore, despite the large samples overall, sampling\nvariability becomes large and the stability of estimates is\ncompromised, as the sample sizes decrease when numer-\nous subgroups are investigated. As a result, some ob-\nserved differences among sex-ethnic subgroups may be\nlarge, yet within the range of sampling variability and other\nsubgroup differences, such as those among sex-ethnic sub-\ngroups with respect to different component combina-\ntions, were not investigated.\nThe American Heart Association recommends that\ntreatment options for childhood obesity be based on the\nseverity of obesity and the presence or absence of co-\nmorbidities.36 In the present study, 5.9% of the adoles-\ncents had an elevated WC in the absence of other com-\nponent risk factors (Table 3). However, an additional 7.2%\nof the adolescents had an elevated WC in the presence\nof MetS. Of the 472 participants who had an elevated WC,\n164 (35%) had other component risk factors to make the\ndiagnosis of MetS. Of the 25 study participants who had\nMetS but did not have an elevated WC, 20 had an el-\nevated glucose concentration as 1 of their 3 disorders,\nwhereas the other 5 had elevated BP and triglyceride con-\ncentrations and low HDL-C. Although each component\nrisk factor may be managed separately, it would be pru-\ndent to identify those with multiple disorders, irrespec-\ntive of obesity, and provide them with more aggressive\ntreatment and management options.\nThis work clearly identifies a different timetable and\nperhaps a different pathway for developing MetS in black\nadolescents. Although the prevalence of central adipos-\nity remained substantially lower in black males than in\nother sex-ethnicity groups throughout adolescence, it was\nvery high in black females, but males and females both\nhad a relatively low prevalence of MetS. It is possible that\nblack individuals have a propensity for developing clus-\nters of component disorders later in adolescence and,\nhence, demonstrate a lower prevalence of metabolic dis-\norders despite greater proclivity for cardiometabolic dis-\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

The relatively low prevalence of all of\nthe individual components among black individuals, ex-\ncept for the elevated prevalence of large WC in females,\nis consistent with a delayed onset, but a complete expla-\nnation of the ethnic disparities requires further study.\nCorrespondence: William D.
