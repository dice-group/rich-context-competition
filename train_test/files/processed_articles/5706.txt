    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople often mimic each other. Research has examined the positive social benefits of mimicry and factors that lead to\nincreased mimicry. Two studies examine whether a participant is more likely to mimic nonverbal behavior of someone\nwho shares the same opinion as the participant than someone who does not. The participant made a decision between two\nvacation destinations and discussed the choice in a three-person group. The two other group members were confederates.\nOne agreed with the participant's choice and one disagreed. Each confederate emitted a different nonverbal behavior\nconsistently throughout discussion. Results offer some support to the hypothesis that the participant would be more likely\nto mimic nonverbal behavior of the confederate who is in agreement with the participant.\n",

This tendency is\nso compelling that people will mimic the behavior of a\nnearby stranger with whom they are not even interacting\n(Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), and people are generally\nunaware that they are engaging in mimicry (Bavelas, Black,\nresearch has found that mimicry has many socially useful\nfunctions that help strengthen interpersonal bonds, such as\nincreasing rapport, liking, empathy, and prosocial behavior\n(for review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). Chartrand and\nLakin (2013) highlight two recent themes in the mimicry\nliterature: moderators that lead to more or less mimicry in a\ngiven situation, for example, social, motivational, and emo-\ntional factors; and downstream consequences of mimicry,\nfor example, prosocial behavior, attitudes, and consumer\npreferences. Other research has examined what factors may\nincrease mimicry of another person (see Chartrand & Bargh,\n2003). This study explores how sharing the same opinion\nwith another person may increase a participant's behavioral\nmimicry of that person.\nResearchers have found that people imitate each other on\na wide range of behaviors (for review, see Chartrand &\nexample, both infants and adults imitate the facial expres-\nAdelmann, Murphy, & Niedenthal, 1987).

Chartrand\net al. (2005) propose that mimicry was adaptive in our evolu-\ntionary past and continues to serve an adaptive function by\nincreasing empathy, liking, rapport, and affiliation in interac-\ntions. Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found that confederates\nwho mimicked participants were liked more than confeder-\nates who did not engage in mimicry.

Drury-Grogan2\n Keywords\nmimicry, chameleon effect, nonverbal imitation, mirroring\n2 SAGE Open\nbehavior (Kirschner & Tomasello, 2010; Valdesolo &\nDeSteno, 2011; van Baaren, Holland, Steenaert, & van\nHolland, Kawakami, and van Knippenberg (2004) found that\npeople who had been mimicked were more prosocial even to\nsomeone other than the person who mimicked them. Thus,\nthe positive relational effects of mimicry extend beyond the\ninteracting partners to include those who are not involved in\nthe interaction. Finally, researchers (Bailenson & Yee, 2005;\nHerrmann, Rossberg, Huber, Landwehr, & Henkel, 2011;\nhave found that mimickers are rated as more persuasive than\nnonmimickers and more successful in a negotiation (Swaab,\nMaddux, & Sinaceur, 2011) and a mediation if mimicry\noccurs over an extensive interaction (Fischer-Lokou et al.,\n2014). Mimicry, therefore, serves a useful purpose in propa-\ngating relationships and prosocial behaviors, even to\nstrangers.\nHowever, while research has long established the social\nbenefits of mimicry, researchers have also been examining\nwhat factors may lead to more mimicry. Some researchers\nhave found cultural differences in the tendency to engage in\nmimicry. Sanchez-Burks, Lee, Choi, Nisbett, Zhao, and Koo\n(2003) proposed that less attention is paid to indirect, rela-\ntional communication in the workplace in the United States\nthan in other countries because of the United States's history\nof a Protestant relational ideology that emphasizes the impor-\ntance of limiting interpersonal concerns in the workplace and\nseparating the domains of work and leisure. Therefore, there\nis less emphasis on relational communication such as non-\nverbal mimicry in U.S. workplaces than in workplaces in\nother countries, and people in the United States raised in tra-\nditions of Calvinist Protestantism are less likely to engage in\nnonverbal mimicry in the workplace (Sanchez-Burks, 2002).\nFurthermore, researchers have examined how several\nvariables can increase mimicry, including perspective taking,\nhigh self-monitoring, similarity, context dependence, inter-\ndependent self-construal, goals of affiliation, and rapport\n(for review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). For example,\nincidental similarity, such as sharing the same name or major,\ncan increase mimicry (Gu\u00e9guen, 2012; Gu\u00e9guen & Martin,\n2009). Given the important social benefits of mimicry,\nunderstanding how mimicry may be increased is an impor-\ntant avenue toward increasing positive interactions in inter-\npersonal exchanges, and similarity may be an important\nmeans toward increasing mimicry.\nOther research has confirmed the importance of similar-\nity and examined how sharing the same opinion on an issue\ncould lead to more mimicry, particularly how sharing the\nsame viewpoint with someone may increase mimicry of\nthat nonverbal mimicry could be the result of shared view-\npoints, and Cheng and Chartrand (2003) demonstrated that\namong high self-monitors, mimicry increases as a function\nof perceived self\u00adother similarity. Van Swol (2003) had\nparticipants discuss an issue in a group with two other peo-\nple who were actually confederates. One confederate\nagreed with the participant and one disagreed. Furthermore,\neach confederate elicited a different nonverbal behavior\nthroughout the discussion. The data showed a trend toward\nparticipants mimicking the nonverbal behavior of the con-\nfederate who agreed with them more than the confederate\nwho disagreed, but the results were not significant. The\nauthor suggested that low power could underlie the lack of\nsignificant results, and suggested that further research\nexamining shared viewpoints and mimicry use a sample\nworkplace task for the group discussion was also used, and\ngiven that in the United States, nonverbal mimicry may be\ninhibited in work settings due to the Protestant relational\nideology (Sanchez-Burks, 2002), use of a different type of\ntask to test the relationship between shared viewpoints and\nnonverbal mimicry is important.\nTherefore, the two experiments in this article add to van\nSwol (2003) by using larger sample sizes and a less work-\noriented group discussion task to test the hypothesis that par-\nticipants will be more likely to imitate a nonverbal behavior\nwhen that behavior is emitted by a confederate who agrees\nwith the participant than a confederate who disagrees.\nBecause nonverbal mimicry is strongly related to increased\nrapport, empathy, and liking (Chartrand & Lakin, 2013), a\nrelationship between agreement and increased mimicry\ncould indicate how mimicry may mediate a relationship\nbetween agreement and liking or strengthen the tendency to\nlike and empathize with those who agree with us. Given that\nsimilarity can be established even through incidental means\nsuch as names and birthdays (Gu\u00e9guen, 2012; Gu\u00e9guen &\nMartin, 2009), similarity could be an especially easy way to\nimprove social interactions through mimicry. Furthermore,\ngiven that mimicry may be sensitive to task (Sanchez-Burks,\n2002), it is important to examine mimicry and its conse-\nquences in a variety of tasks.\nExperiment 1\nMethod\nParticipants and design.There were 69 participants who\ncompleted the experiment for partial credit in a communi-\ncation studies class at a large Midwestern university in the\nUnited States. Participants were randomly assigned to\nconditions. Six participants were excluded from analysis\nbecause they indicated suspicion in the posttask question-\nnaire or noticed the nonverbal behavior of the confeder-\nates. One participant was excluded due to camera\ndifficulties. Data from 62 participants were used; the\nagreeing confederate either shook their foot (n = 34) or\ntouched their face (n = 28).\nVan Swol and Drury-Grogan 3\nProcedure.When the participant arrived, he or she was\nbrought to a room where one of the confederates was already\nwaiting with a signed consent form, and the participant was\ngiven informed consent. Then the second confederate arrived\nand was given informed consent. After informed consent, the\nexperimenter explained that the purpose of the experiment\nwas to study how discussing one's preference in a group\naffects one's decision and behavior. Thus, it was explained\nthat after making an individual decision alone, participants\nwould be discussing their decision in a group.\nParticipants were asked to pretend they won a trip in a\nstudent contest, and they could choose between two vacation\ndestinations in the Caribbean. The participant and confeder-\nates were given a written description of the contest and infor-\nmation about each fictitious Caribbean island and then given\na sheet to record their initial, individual decision and rate\ntheir confidence in their decision from 1 (very confident) to 9\n(not at all confident). They were instructed to individually\nread through the information and make a decision about\nwhich island they wanted to visit. The experimenter then\nescorted the confederates out of the room, stating that every-\none would work in separate rooms.\nAfter 8 to 10 minutes, the experimenter checked the\nprogress of the participant. When the participant had made\na decision, the experimenter collected his or her decision\nsheet and said that she wanted to check the camera. At this\npoint, the experimenter turned the camera on to record a\nbaseline of the participant's behavior when alone. A base-\nline was collected to obtain a measure of how much the\nparticipants engaged in the measured nonverbal behaviors\nnaturally without a confederate emitting them. In 10 of the\ntrials, the participant moved out of the camera's angle or\nthe experimenter forgot to turn the camera on early. A base-\nline was recorded for 52 trials. The average baseline was\nAfter turning the camera on, the experimenter stated that\nshe would check the progress of the other two participants.\nAfter waiting about 2 min to record a baseline, the confeder-\nates were both brought back into the main experimental\nroom. The three group members sat facing each other. There\nwas no obstruction between them so the participant had a full\nbody view of both confederates. The experimenter read the\nfollowing instructions:\nNow I want you to discuss your choice with the other participants.\nIf you picked a different vacation than someone else, please\nexplain your choice to the other two participants telling them\nwhy you picked that vacation.Also, if another participant picked\na different vacation than you, please listen to their information.\nYou do not have to stick to your original preference if you learn\nnew information that changes your mind. You will not make a\ngroup decision, but you will be asked to make an individual\ndecision after the group discussion.\nThe experimenter asked whether anyone had any questions\nand then told the group that she would check back in 10\nminutes but if they finished before, they should come get her\nin the next room. The participant and confederates kept their\ninformation sheet during the discussion to provide a loose\nscript of information for the confederates to discuss.\nThe participant was videotaped throughout the whole\ngroup discussion, although the camera was positioned so that\nit appeared as if the whole group was being taped. One con-\nfederate agreed with the participant's choice of vacation des-\ntination and one disagreed. Furthermore, one confederate\nshook his or her foot throughout and one repeatedly touched\nhis or her face. Confederates were blind to the experimental\nhypotheses. The use of a triad methodology in a mimicry\nstudy, pioneered by Dabbs (1969), allows the nontarget con-\nfederate to serve as a control within the same interaction. We\ncounterbalanced whether the agreeing confederate touched\nhis or her face or shook his or her foot. Furthermore, four\ndifferent confederates were used for the experiment, and we\ncounterbalanced whether they shook their foot or touched\ntheir face and whether they agreed with the participant or\ndisagreed. Thus, each confederate alternated between agree-\nment or disagreement and between shaking his or her foot or\ntouching his or her face.\nFor touching the face, the confederate was instructed to\nput a couple of fingers or part of their hand for a few seconds\non any part of the face from the forehead to the chin and then\nshift the hand away. They were instructed to touch the face\nfor approximately 50% to 70% of the time during the trial.\nFor shaking the foot, the confederates could either cross their\nlegs and shake their foot from the ankle or the knee or set the\nlower part of one leg across the knee of the other leg and\nshake their ankle. They were instructed to shake their leg\nduring 50% to 70% of the trial. When shaking their leg, the\nconfederates were instructed to have a steady, but not too\nvigorous, movement of the leg from the ankle and/or knee.\nOther than the specific nonverbal behavior, both confeder-\nates were instructed to act similarly in both the agreement\nand disagreement conditions.\nThe group discussion lasted for a mean of 6.18 minutes\nsion, the experimenter collected the information sheets,\npassed out a posttask questionnaire, and escorted the confed-\nerates out of the room. The questionnaire asked participants\nto again pick a vacation destination and rate their confidence.\nParticipants were also asked, \"What do you think the pur-\npose of this research is?\", \"What did you notice most about\nthe other two participants?\", \"Did any of the other two par-\nticipants engage in any noticeable mannerisms during the\nexperiment?\", and \"Was there anything about the other two\nparticipants'behavior that made you feel awkward or uncom-\nfortable?\" Five participants were excluded from data analy-\nsis because their answers indicated that they knew the\nexperiment was staged. One other participant was excluded\nfrom analysis because he wrote that he noticed one of the\nstaged nonverbal behaviors. Upon completion of the ques-\ntionnaire, participants were thanked and asked to provide an\n4 SAGE Open\naddress if they wished to be debriefed upon completion of\ndata collection. Because of the use of confederates, partici-\npants were not immediately debriefed.\nCoding. Three independent coders unaware of any hypothe-\nses coded the trials. One coder was used as the primary coder\nand coded all trials, and the other two were secondary cod-\ners. The secondary coders split up the trials and each coded\nabout half of them. Coders were instructed to count any up\nand down or back and forth movement of the leg and foot\noriginating from the ankle or knee as an instance of \"shaking\nthe foot.\" Crossing and uncrossing the legs did not count.\nThe coder counted each time a participant moved his or her\nfoot back and forth as one instance of \"shaking the foot.\"\nCoders were instructed to count any time the participant's\nhand touched the face and moved away as an instance of\n\"touching the face.\" Touching the hair, neck, and ears did not\ncount as an instance, nor did covering one's mouth to sneeze\nor cough. If a participant put his or her hand on the face and\nkept it there, then the coders were instructed to count every 5\nseconds that the hand rested on the face as one instance of\n\"touching the face.\"\nCoders counted the instances of nonverbal behavior both\nin the baseline and main experiment. The main coder's count\nof touching the face in the baseline and experiment corre-\nlated with both the first (baseline: intraclass correlation\nof shaking the foot also correlated with the first (baseline:\nwere used for the analyses.\nResults\nNo participant changed his or her choice of vacation destina-\ntion after meeting in the group with the two confederates.\nThirty-six (58%) participants chose one vacation option, and\n26 (42%) chose the other. This difference was not signifi-\ncant, 2 = 1.61, p = .20. But participants' confidence in their\nconfidence.\nThe total number of foot shakes and face touches was\ndivided by the minutes of discussion for each trial to deter-\nmine an average number of shakes or touches per minute.\nTable 1 reports the number of face touches and foot shakes\nper minute in the main experiment and baseline. The num-\nber of face touches and foot shakes per minute in the base-\nline was compared in a paired samples t test. The difference\nTherefore, in the baseline, the participants were not more\nlikely to elicit one nonverbal behavior more than the other.\nThe number of face touches and foot shakes per minute in\nthe main experiment also was compared in a paired samples\nt test. This difference was significant, t(61) = 3.15, Cohen's\nd = . 66, p = .003. Thus, participants were more likely to\nshake their foot than touch their face during the main experi-\nment. Neither did participants' foot shakes in the baseline\ncorrelate with their foot shakes during the experiment, r =\n.14, p = .31, nor did their face touching in the baseline cor-\nrelate with face touching during the main experiment, r =\n.23, p = .10.

Participants\nshook their foot more when the agreeing confederate shook\nhis or her foot than when the disagreeing confederate shook\nhis or her foot, and they touched their face more when the\nagreeing confederate touched his or her face than when the\ndisagreeing confederate touched his or her face. These results\nsuggest that people are more likely to mimic the nonverbal\nbehavior of someone who agrees with them than someone\nwho disagrees. However, when the baseline was used as a\ncovariate to account for participants' behavior when alone,\nthe results approached, but no longer reached, significance.\nThe first experiment had some problems that may account\nfor the lack of strong significant results and that we try to\ncorrect in the second experiment. First, the baseline used\nmay not have been appropriate. An individual's nonverbal\nbehavior alone may differ considerably from an individual's\nnonverbal behavior when interacting with other people\n(Kraut & Johnston, 1979). The lack of correlation between\nparticipants' baseline behavior and their nonverbal behavior\nin the experiment suggests that their nonverbal behavior\nalone was very different from their behavior in the presence\nof others. Also, we did not have a baseline for 10 people,\nwhich lowered the power of the test when including the base-\nline as a covariate. Furthermore, in Experiment 1, the effect\nsizes of the test without a covariate and the ANCOVA were\nvery similar so adding the covariate of baseline behavior did\nvery little toward controlling the variance. The fact that the\ntest for leg shakes had a significant difference between the\nagreement and disagreement conditions but the ANCOVA\nwas not significant is more likely explained by a drop in\npower in the ANCOVA due to the use of a smaller sample\nsize. Therefore, Experiment 2 uses a more appropriate base-\nline in which the participant interacts with the confederates\nduring the baseline.\nAlso, Experiment 1 had no manipulation check on con-\nfederates. Although confederates were blind to the experi-\nmental hypotheses, they could have easily guessed that\nagreement with the participant could affect the participant's\nbehavior differently than disagreement. Furthermore, con-\nfederates may have enjoyed agreeing with the participant\nmore and may have acted more enthusiastically or smiled\nmore when in agreement. This offers an alternative hypoth-\nesis for why there was a tendency for participants to imitate\nthe confederates' leg shaking more in the agreement condi-\ntion. Therefore, we included a manipulation check on the\nconfederates'behavior in the second experiment to try to rule\nout this alternative hypothesis. Experiment 1 also did not\ncheck whether confederates were, in fact, engaging in their\nassigned behavior and at what rate, and, therefore, this is\nexamined in Experiment 2 as well.\nAlthough there was not a significant difference between\nthe number of foot shakes and face touches in the baseline,\nparticipants were more likely to shake their foot during the\nexperiment. This suggests that, in general, people may be\nmore likely to mimic foot shaking behavior than face touch-\ning. In other words, when alone, people may be just as likely\nto shake their foot as touch their face, but when interacting\nwith others, foot shaking may be more contagious than\ntouching one's face. We used these two nonverbal behaviors\nbecause they have been used in previous research (Chartrand\ntouching is more controllable than foot shaking or that some\nparticipants may have been more reluctant to touch their face\ndue to the use of makeup or presence of facial hair. Therefore,\nwe use arm touching instead of face touching as a nonverbal\nbehavior in the second experiment.\nAnother reason participants may have been less likely to\ntouch their face is that they were holding their information\nsheets during the interaction. This may have kept their hands\noccupied. Furthermore, some participants avoided eye con-\ntact with the confederates by looking at their information\nsheets, and this may have diminished their attention to the\nconfederates' nonverbal behavior. Therefore, in the second\nexperiment, the experimenter collected the information\nsheets before the discussion, and participants discussed the\ninformation from memory and had no paper to hold during\nthe discussion.\nThe discussion time in Experiment 1 was short. By allow-\ning the participants and confederates to get the experimenter\nwhen the group discussion seemed to be ending, the confed-\nerates were often misjudging the time and ending the discus-\nsion after only 5 min. Therefore, in the second experiment,\nconfederates were instructed to keep the discussion going\nuntil the experimenter came to check on the group's prog-\nress. A longer discussion time may allow the participant to\nobserve the confederates' nonverbal behavior more and pos-\nsibly establish a better rapport with the confederates. This\nmay ensure stronger results. Finally, Experiment 1 used a\nmain coder rather than taking the mean of two or three cod-\ners. Although reliability between the main coder and second-\nary coders was acceptable, Experiment 2 takes the mean of\nthe coders rather than relying on one coder.\n6 SAGE Open\nExperiment 2\nMethod\nParticipants and design. There were 57 participants who com-\npleted the experiment for partial credit in a communication\nstudies class at a large Midwestern university. Two partici-\npants were excluded from analysis. One changed their opin-\nion after the group discussion and was excluded because we\ncould not tell which confederate was agreed with during the\ndiscussion. The second excluded participant suspected the\nuse of confederates. Data from 55 participants were used.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to conditions of either\nthe agreeing confederate shaking his or her foot (n = 27) or\nthe agreeing confederate touching his or her arm (n = 28).\nProcedure. Experiment 2 used the same vacation destination\ntask as Experiment 1. Participants received informed consent\nand made an individual decision according to the same pro-\ncedure as Experiment 1. After the participant made an indi-\nvidual decision alone, the experimenter collected his or her\ndecision sheet and information sheet. Neither the participant\nnor the confederates kept their information sheet during the\ndiscussion to avoid distractions. The experimenter then\nbrought both confederates back into the main experimental\nroom.\nThe experimenter told the group to engage in talk to \"get\nacquainted\" for 2 min. They were to introduce themselves\nand not talk about the vacation destination task yet. The con-\nfederates were instructed to not engage in their designated\nnonverbal behavior during this 2-min baseline. This was to\nrecord a baseline of the participant's nonverbal behavior\nwhen talking to the group members. There were two cameras\nin the room. One recorded the behavior of the participant,\nand the second camera was used to record the confederates\nfor 30 of the trials to provide a manipulation check on the\nconfederates' behavior. For the other trials in which the con-\nfederates were not recorded, the second camera was still in\nthe room and the experimenter pretended to turn it on. After\nturning the cameras on, the experimenter stated that she\nwould return in approximately 2 min to explain the next\nsteps of the experiment. A baseline was recorded for all tri-\nAfter 2 min, the experimenter returned and read the same\ninstructions to the group as in Experiment 1.\nThe experimenter asked whether anyone had any ques-\ntions and then told the group that she would check back in 8\nto 10 minutes.

When the experimenter returned, she asked\nwhether the group was finished. All indicated that they were.\nOne confederate agreed with the participant's choice of\nvacation destination and one disagreed. One confederate\nshook his or her foot throughout and one repeatedly touched\nhis or her arms. It was counterbalanced whether the agreeing\nconfederate touched his or her arms or shook his or her foot.\nFurthermore, four different confederates were used for the\nexperiment, and it was counterbalanced whether they shook\ntheir foot or touched their arms and whether they agreed or\ndisagreed.\nFor touching the arms, the confederate was instructed to\nput a couple of fingers or part of their hand for a few sec-\nonds on any part of the arms from the shoulder to the top of\nthe hand just above the knuckles and then shift the hand\naway. They could also cross their arms, rub their arms, or\nscratch their arms. They were instructed to touch their arms\nfor approximately 50% to 70% of the time. For shaking the\nfoot, the confederates were given the same instruction as\nExperiment 1.\nIn addition to training the confederates to engage in the\nnonverbal behaviors, confederates were instructed to make\nmistakes in phrasing that would be expected in natural com-\npared with scripted conversation. In Experiment 1, some of\nthe participants who suspected the use of confederates stated\nthat the confederates seemed to know the information too\nwell. Therefore, confederates were trained to pause or stum-\nble over words, slightly misremember a couple of pieces of\ninformation, and state some pieces of information in a sim-\npler format.\nAfter the discussion, the experimenter passed out a post-\ntask questionnaire and escorted the confederates out of the\nroom, so that everyone allegedly could work on the question-\nnaire individually. The questionnaire asked participants to\nagain pick a vacation destination and rate their confidence.\nThe questionnaire also asked, \"What do you think the pur-\npose of this research is?\", \"What did you notice most about\nthe other two participants?\", and \"Did any of the other two\nparticipants engage in any noticeable mannerisms during the\nexperiment?\" One participant was excluded from data analy-\nsis because his or her answers indicated that he or she knew\nthe experiment was staged. Upon completion of the ques-\ntionnaire, participants were thanked and debriefed according\nto the same procedure as Experiment 1.\nCoding.Two coders, unaware of the experimental hypothe-\nsis, coded all 55 of the trials for foot shaking and arm touch-\ning. The same coding scheme as Experiment 1 was used for\nfoot shaking. For arm touching, the coders counted as an\ninstance of arm touching any time the participant touched\nand pulled away with their hand or other arm any part of the\narm from above the knuckles to the shoulder. Touching the\nfingers together or clasping hands together did not count. If\nparticipants continuously touched their arm by, for example,\nhaving their arms crossed or resting a hand on the other arm,\nthen the coders counted every 5 seconds as an instance of\narm touching.\nThe first coder's count of touching the arm in the baseline\nand experiment correlated with the second coder (baseline:\nVan Swol and Drury-Grogan 7\nfirst coder's count of shaking the foot also correlated with the\neach nonverbal behavior was used as the dependent variable\nin the analyses.\nFor 30 of the trials, the two different confederates also\nwere videotaped so that the behavior of the agreeing and dis-\nagreeing confederate could be compared. Two coders,\nunaware of the experimental hypothesis, rated the confeder-\nates on a six-point scale from low to high for the following\ncharacteristics: amount of eye contact, amount of smiling,\nfriendliness, degree to which the confederate appeared to\nlike the participant, persuasiveness, and talkativeness. The\ntwo coders' ratings significantly correlated for all measures:\n.0001); degree to which the confederate appeared to like par-\nof the two coders' rating for each scale for the two confeder-\nates was analyzed in a paired samples t test (disagreement -\nagreement). There were no significant differences between\nthe rating of the agreeing and disagreeing confederates for\n(see Table 2 for means) amount of eye contact, t(29) = 1.21,\nd = .09, p = .18; degree to which the confederate appeared to\nHowever, the agreeing confederate was rated higher in per-\nsuasiveness than the disagreeing confederate, t(29) = -2.59,\nCohen's d = -.46, p = .02. Possibly, the coders perceived this\nconfederate's agreement with the participant as a sign of per-\nsuasiveness. Therefore, the agreeing and disagreeing confed-\nerates were rated as behaving similarly on all measures\nexcept ratings of persuasiveness.\nIn addition, two coders watched the recordings of confed-\nerates with a stop watch application on the computer to try to\nassess how much each coder engaged in their assigned\nbehavior. They pressed a button to activate the stop watch\nwhen the coder engaged in their assigned behavior and\npressed the button again to stop the stop watch when the con-\nfederate discontinued. The coder watched the video twice\nand only coded one confederate per view. The two coders'\nratings correlated for amount of time spent touching their\narm (ICC = .65, p = .003) and amount of time spent foot\ncoders' ratings and divided the amount each coder recorded\nby the amount of time of the interaction.

However,\nthe results for foot shakes were only significant when the\nbaseline was included as a covariate, and the results for arm\ntouches were only significant when the covariate was not\nincluded. Thus, the results were not conclusively significant.\nHowever, Experiment 2 did lend stronger support with stron-\nger effect sizes for the hypothesis than Experiment 1.\nPossibly, the changes in methodology from Experiment 1 to\nExperiment 2 strengthened the effect.\nThe manipulation check on confederates' behavior in\nExperiment 2 could not completely rule out that the confed-\nerates were not acting differently. In particular, the agreeing\nconfederate was rated as more persuasive. Because the cod-\ners were unaware of the experimental hypothesis, it is pos-\nsible that the coders assumed the agreeing confederate was\nmore persuasive because the participant agreed with him or\nher. However, it may be that the agreeing confederate was\nindeed acting more persuasive, and this offers an alternative\nhypothesis for our results that we cannot rule out. In addi-\ntion, coding of the confederates' assigned behavior con-\nfirmed that confederates were engaging in their assigned\nbehavior during about half of the interaction.\nGeneral Discussion\nThese two experiments examined whether shared viewpoints\nbetween two group members lead to increased mimicry. For\nfoot shakes and arm touches, there was partial support that\nparticipants mimic the behavior of the confederate who\nagreed with them. However, for the nonverbal behavior of\nface touching, the results were not significant. Therefore, the\nresults lend mixed support to the hypothesis; when signifi-\ncant, the effects sizes were small to moderate. This study\nused the social task of going on vacation to try to address a\nproblem found in previous research (van Swol, 2003) that\nparticipants may be less likely to mimic others' nonverbal\nbehavior on a nonsocial task. People in the United States pay\nless attention to indirect, relational communication in work-\nplace settings (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2003) than in settings\ninvolving leisure. However, this study did not find\nunequivocal support that people mimic those who agree with\nthem in social, leisure settings. However, future research\nshould do a direct comparison and manipulate type of setting\nas an independent variable.\nA similar process to perspective taking may underlie the\ntendency of people with shared views to mimic one another.\nPeople may be more likely to direct their attention in a con-\nversation to a person who is in agreement with them than a\nperson who is in disagreement. Chartrand and Bargh (1999)\nargued that mimicry is caused by an automatic perception\u00ad\nbehavior link such that simply perceiving a behavior is\nenough to elicit mimicry of the behavior, usually noncon-\nsciously, from the perceiver. Other researchers (LaFrance &\nsuggested that posture mimicry reflects the attention of the\nperceiver toward the person they are mimicking. Thus, peo-\nple may be more susceptible to mimicry of a person who is in\nagreement with them because more of their perception and\nattention is directed toward that person's behavior than a per-\nson who is in disagreement with them. People are more likely\nto gaze at faces that are similar to themselves (Hungr &\nHunt, 2012) and gaze at people and objects they like\nhowever, future research may want to examine the moderat-\ning role of attention more directly, possibly by measuring\nparticipants' eye gaze toward each confederate to establish\nthat participants are directing more of their attention toward\nthe confederate in agreement with them. For example,\nresearch has found that pictures of emotional content\nreceived more participant eye gazes and for longer durations\nthan neutral content, and even more so if the emotional con-\ntent was pleasant rather than nonpleasant (Nummenmaa,\nHy\u00f6n\u00e4, & Calvo, 2006). Perhaps like emotional pictures,\nparticipants might make more eye contact with a confederate\nwho agrees with them. Likewise, averting eye gaze leads to\nparticipants feeling ostracized and showing related effects of\nlowered satisfaction of basic human needs, lowered experi-\nence of relational evaluation, more negative moods, lowered\nself-esteem, enhanced temptations to act aggressively, and\nan increased feeling that the relationship or interaction was\nlow in value (Wirth, Sacco, Hugenberg, & Williams, 2010).\nThus, if confederates avoid eye gaze, participants could feel\nmore ostracized in the conversation and be less likely to\nmimic them or change their own opinion.\nAnother reason people may be more likely to mimic\nsomeone in agreement with them is that mimicry is a form of\ncommunication (Bavelas et al., 1986; Chartrand & Lakin,\n2013) that helps to communicate the empathetic message \"`I\nam with you' or `I am like you'\" (Bavelas, Black, Chovil,\nmunicate that the perceiver shares the same feelings as the\nperson they are mimicking. People may be more willing or\nlikely to communicate such a nonverbal message to someone\nthey perceive as more similar to themselves. Previous\nresearch has found that people are more willing to mimic\nVan Swol and Drury-Grogan 9\nsomeone who has incidental similarity with them (Gu\u00e9guen,\nlarity could be driving the mimicry in the results. In addition,\nresearch on empathy has found that people are more likely to\ndisplay empathy toward similar others (Baston et al., 1995;\nhave increased empathy for others who share similar opin-\nions as themselves and may be more likely to mimic their\nbehavior as communication of that empathy.\nFuture research should explore other factors that may lead\nto increased mimicry between two people. People are more\nlikely to mimic someone who is more similar to themselves\nin other ways besides sharing the same opinion (Cheng &\nOther research should examine how variables such as \"lik-\ning\" mediate or moderate the relationship between similarity\nand mimicry. For example, it is already known that similarity\nincreases liking and attraction (Byrne, 1971) and that people\nwho like each other tend to mimic each other's postures and\nmannerisms more than those who do not like each other\nbetween mimicry, liking, and attitudinal similarity can be\ntested in a mediation analysis.\nOverall, the two experiments and other work (van Swol,\n2003) show that the effects of agreement on mimicry are\nsubtle, inconsistent, and not particularly strong. These find-\nings are in line with other nonconscious phenomenon (Klein\net al., 2014) like priming where results can be inconsistent.\nGiven the attentional nature of mimicry, results depend on\nparticipants paying attention to other members, and partici-\npants' focus could have varied widely. Furthermore, ten-\ndency toward mimicry could depend on how strongly\nparticipants held their prediscussion opinion. In a fictitious\nlaboratory task, participants may not have been that invested\nin agreeing with a certain option.\nThis study also had several limitations. First, confederates\nwere engaging in the nonverbal behavior about 50% of the\ntime in our coded interactions and were instructed to engage in\nthe behavior 50% to 70% of the time. This may have been too\nhigh an amount of mimicry and led to several participants\nnoticing the behavior. The mimicry may have been obvious to\nseveral participants, and this may have reduced our ability to\nmeasure nonconscious, automatic mimicry. Second, low\npower still may have been an issue with these studies.Although\nthis study had increased sample size than van Swol's (2003),\ncell sizes were about 30 per cell after accounting for suspi-\ncious participants. Third, the coding comparing foot shaking\nwith face touches was problematic with regard to the creation\nof rates per minute of face touching. Specifically, if partici-\npants touched their face for an extended period of time, every\n5 seconds was counted as a face touch, but if a participant\nshook their leg for an extended period of time, every leg shake\nwas counted as one leg shake. This may have lowered the\namount of face touches in comparison with leg shakes. Finally,\nalthough intercoder reliability was acceptable on all measures,\nsometimes reliability was much higher than others. For exam-\nple, in Experiment 2, eye contact and talkativeness had lower\nreliability than ratings of friendliness and liking. Friendliness\nand liking were general impressions the coders made, whereas\neye contact and talkativeness may have required more atten-\ntive coding to frequency that was more difficult for the\ncoders.\nIn conclusion, this study used a larger sample size and\ndifferent task than van Swol's (2003) study and lent some\nsupport for the hypothesis that people are more likely to\nmimic the nonverbal behavior of someone who shares the\nsame opinion as them than the nonverbal behavior of some-\none who holds a different opinion.\nAuthors' Note\nThe results of this article were presented as a talk at the 2006\nInternational Communication Association conference in Dresden,\nGermany.\n"
