Recently, this relevancy has been illustrated yet\nagain by a cable from the American embassy to the HS to Washington after the election\nof Pope Francis:\ndespite the disparity in size, governance, and history, we are both global powers, with global\ninterests and influence. From many points of view, the HS is unique to the world in its ability to\npursue its own agenda.

Diplomacy itself is a key\npart of this transformation which offers expanded space for actors engaging in diplo-\nmacy (Constantinou et al., 2016). HS diplomacy transfers its religious and political posi-\ntions well beyond its religious constituency, which is a common feature of the global\noutreach of religious institutions (Marshall, 2013). Yet unlike other organised religions,\nthe HS global outreach is highly institutionalised, rests on formal diplomatic representa-\ntions around the globe equal to embassies and acknowledged by international law. This\nentanglement between the HS and the international sphere of states generates the strange\ncase of agents that are simultaneously clergy and mirror their secular counterparts. Their\nvery existence and practice are an example of how religious and political entanglements\nin the international realm `generate creative, dynamic, and hybrid modes of social and\nWhereas ordinary diplomats are serving the goals of a territorial unit, the unconven-\ntional nature of HS diplomats is nested in the hybrid character of their ecclesiastical role\nas the Pope's representatives and their legal diplomatic status and commencement to\nordinary diplomatic practice. Their papal patron's global perspective renders them unusu-\nally dedicated to influencing the conditions beyond their principal's immediate posses-\nsions (such as a territory). This standing places them at an advantage in an international\nsociety in which such contextual factors are centrally important. This advantage is rein-\nforced by the degrees to which HS diplomats constitute a combination of transnational\nidentity and national interest. This difference is obvious when looking at instances of how\npapal diplomats mediate between a conventional approach and the approach of the HS.\nBetween `its supernatural mission of salvation and the mundane reality of world politics',\nthe institution of the papacy `remains a singular and surprisingly vital factor in the inter-\nnational scene' (Conway, 1979: 474). The agents of papal diplomacy are thus a puzzling\ncase of how to merge the aspirations and expectations of a religious principal with a\nconventional approach of diplomatic practice.\nGiven the religious nature of its principal, its ordained agents, and international socie-\nty's requirements for diplomatic standards and practice, papal diplomacy cannot be like\nordinary diplomacy. Papal diplomacy is the result of a religious and political entanglement\nthat generates a hybrid mode of agency of which this article proposes the constituents of\nits diplomatic practice. This argument is located within a classical English School under-\nstanding of practice, diplomacy, and agency while incorporating constructivist understand-\nings of the diplomat as a stranger. The article situates HS diplomat's mode of agency as\nhybrid, located at the intersections of political and religious modes of agency and substan-\ntial and relational conceptions of international politics, an angle that has not been applied\nto HS diplomacy by scholars of International Relations and diplomacy.\nAfter a review of the literature on the HS in international society, the next section\nillustrates the hybrid mode of diplomatic agency. This hybrid diplomatic agency resolves\nquestions at the intersection of substantialist and relational conceptions of international\nrelations and political and religious modes of agency. HS diplomats act on behalf of a\nreligious and a political entity and logic in religious and secular environments. The next\nstep unpacks the historical trajectory of the HS diplomatic practice. The article draws on\na hybrid mode of agency by illustrating how the different dimensions and conceptions\nmatter in blueprinting a comprehensive picture of HS diplomacy. The remainder of the\npaper demonstrates how the hybrid mode of agency varies by degree. The framework of\nhybrid agency is then probed by analysing incidents involving papal diplomats in tur-\nmoil-ridden historical episodes and unstructured interviews and correspondence with\ninformed agents. This section teases out points of broader interest and illustrates the com-\nplex entanglement of the religious and political. The conclusion locates the findings in the\ncontext of the theoretical framework, the general political interest in the Church, its\nentanglement in international society, and points out future avenues of research.\nHoly See diplomacy: Hybrid by nature\nNotwithstanding recent studies on diplomacy and practice, the claim of diplomacy's resist-\nance to theorising still resonates in the literature (J\u00f6nsson and Hall, 2005; Neumann, 2003).\nThis resistance is even more so when International Relations theory is confronted with the\nagents of a religious transnational actor. There is a solid body of literature that situates the\nHS and the Catholic Church in an international context (Abdullah, 1996; Barbato, 2013;\nrelations,1 international law (Casaroli, 1981; Morss, 2016), the HS and the church as trans-\n(Barbato, 2016; Turina, 2015), the Pope as chief diplomat and moral authority (Hall,\n1997), or theological explanations of political outcomes where the Church has been\nMost of this literature describes the HS diplomatic structure and community. But the\nstudies that provide insights into the practices of the HS diplomatic service are case stud-\nies in which members of the diplomatic service or special envoys achieved a conflict\nstatecraft, and how to put the HS diplomatic apparatus in the context of International\nRelations theory are largely absent in the literature, nor are there any comprehensive\nconceptual outlines of its diplomatic agential practices. The few exceptions that do so\nfocus on the actorness of the HS as a principal actor, rather than on its agents (Barbato,\n524 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)\nGiven the formalised and institutional setting of HS diplomacy, this section sets out a\nconventional conceptualization of its diplomatic apparatus and practice. Like other actors\nthat practice ordinary diplomacy, the HS diplomatic practice follows international for-\nmalised and recognised rules. The rather conservative education and public restraint of its\nmembers resemble what is usually termed as `high politics', in the sense that it is a realm\nof senior statesmen. For the sake of foreign policy assets, agents were supposed to prac-\ntice diplomacy as an art. Certainly, the ideal type of diplomacy Realists had in mind was\nalready in their own time more of a nostalgic sentiment than a realistic option (Bessner\nand Guilhot, 2015). Yet in the case of the HS diplomatic service, this understanding of\ndiplomacy as an asset still applies, as its diplomats face less constraint by democratic\nsum, a conventional conceptualization is warranted by the fact that the HS perceives its\ndiplomatic service in realistic terms as an asset for its foreign policy (Cahill, 2017).\nHowever, given the puzzle outlined in the introduction, a conventional notion of HS\ndiplomacy needs a contextualization of diplomacy as the practice of religious agency if it\nis to be understood as a hybrid mode of agency. This context requires moving beyond\n`explaining' practices by `naming' them (Sending et al., 2015: 9) or describing rules and\ninstitutions. Rather, a hybrid mode of agency needs to differentiate why agents do what\nthey do, based on their self-understanding as ordinary and ordained diplomats and how\nthe two modes merge. Focusing on the institutional setting and agency of the HS diplo-\nmatic service as a practice involves an approach `in which action reflects the ideas, cul-\ntural contexts, identities, and shared understandings of individual and state actors'(Green,\n2014: 1). Such an approach focuses on agency, ideal types, self-justifications and dis-\ncourses by interrogating practices in order to discern their normative content (Navari,\n2009: 3).2 Rather than a form of behaviour or an individual habit, here diplomacy is\nunderstood as a form of conduct created by a set of societal standards in which agents are\neven physical placements, to which autonomous individuals look as guides for appropri-\nate social behaviour' (Navari, 2011: 613). HS diplomacy, then, is a form of conduct cre-\nated by a set of mixed secular and religious standards in which its agents are guided by\npractices, rather than caused by them.\nStudying the `diplomatic community itself' (Wight, 1966: 22) and the practice of the\n`pope's men', rather than `the'pope or `the'HS, reveals supplementary insights to studies\nfocusing on the actorness of the HS or studying `the' diplomacy of this actor. The advan-\ntage of this approach is researching diplomacy not only as a category of analysis, but also\nas one of explanation of what `the pope's men' are doing. The title `nuncio', for instance,\nis one who announces the will of the pope but in practice he does much more. In broader\nterms, conceptualising HS diplomacy as a hybrid mode of agency comprises four dimen-\nsions based on the religious and political modes of agency and substantialist and rela-\ntional conceptualizations of international politics (see Figure 1). HS diplomacy cumulates\nat the intersection of all four dimensions. It is neither only about ordinary diplomats rep-\nresenting and communicating the HS interests or mediating difference between political\nprincipals, nor are its agents simply members of clergy and religious individuals who\nThis conceptualization of HS diplomacy as a hybrid mode of agency builds on\nAgensky's (2017: 21) instruction that religious and political entanglements `generate\ncreative, dynamic, and hybrid modes of social and political agency'. Ignoring `the rela-\ntional dimensions of religion and international politics encourages neglect of key\nmoments in the production of religious and political identities and practices, as well as\nthe implicit normative position taken by doing so'(Agensky, 2017: 3\u00ad4; see also Wilson,\n2010). International Relations theories often rest on substantialist conceptions of politics\nthat build on autonomous acting subjects. As such, they frame diplomacy as an instru-\nment of foreign policy and focus on representing and communicating the principal's\ninterests.3 Hence, they set aside what logic the subjects follow (J\u00f6nsson and Hall, 2005:\n14),4 let alone on what identities and practices those logics rest. A turn to the English\nSchool notion of practice does not suggest a complete shift of the analytical focus to a\nrelational conception. Doing so rather adds a complementary approach since any institu-\ntionalisation at the `cognitive level entails the development of a common language and\nintersubjective structures of meaning and interpretation of words, actions and symbols'\nIn other words, an analysis of diplomacy needs to turn to the question of how `what\none knows in diplomacy and what one makes of that knowledge depends on what one\nunderstands diplomacy to be \u00ad and vice versa' (Constantinou, 2013: 142; originally in\nemphasis). This question is important in addressing diplomacy, particularly its agents'\nproblems of living estrangement between them and the host society if international poli-\ntics is to be understood from a relational angle. The task of diplomats is to act in and re-\nact to the macro and micro surroundings, other than the well-known ones of their own\n(national) community. Diplomacy is thus also about `how we can live together in differ-\nence' (Constantinou, 2013: 142; originally in emphasis). Diplomats epitomise the human\ndesire to live separately and to maintain relations with others. Being a stranger and living\nestrangement are thus inherent parts of being a diplomat (Der Derian, 1987a, 1987b;\nSending, 2011; Sofer, 1997). This status fulfils social and political functions such as pro-\nviding the necessary distance for negotiations in a substantialist conception, which takes\ndiplomacy merely as a functional asset of foreign policy.\nThis substantialist conception is a permeating condition for HS diplomats, yet in their\ncase diplomacy becomes a hazardous endeavour. They do not only represent the HS but\nalso the Catholic part of the host state's society qua their institutionalised religious affili-\nation (Cardinale, 1976). Hence they cannot, by definition, remain strangers in their host\nFigure 1. Hybrid mode of Holy See diplomacy\n526 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)\nstates. Whereas HS diplomats are part (at least the Catholic part) of the host society,\n`secular' diplomats largely remain strangers.5 What is more, HS diplomats are `foreign\nnationals' representing the interests of a political entity which is not their own from the\nperspective of inter-state relations. Conventional substantial approaches of diplomacy\ndefect this intersubjective impetus of how people can live together in difference. Instead,\nthey focus on diplomacy as a dependent variable, referring to the macro social structure\n(see for example Kissinger, 1995, 2014) or the micro structure in formal terms (Gould-\nan intersubjective enterprise in which `[d]ifferent people with different social traits, will\nreport different things' (Neumann, 2010). Not only do they report different things, but\nthey do things differently.\nContextualising the Holy See diplomatic trajectory\nThere are at least three challenges that any investigation of the HS diplomatic service and\nits practices faces. First, there is a lack of data on diplomatic and political micro\npractices.6 As large as the diplomatic apparatus of the HS is, it is the Pope on whose per-\nson the public and academic focus rests.7 This section tackles this problem by turning to\nunstructured interviews and correspondence with nuncios, informed agents, and an exam-\nination of historical episodes involving three prominent nuncios in the 20th and 21st\ncentury. Second, the HS dedicates a great deal of resources to internal matters of faith. An\nanalysis of diplomatic practice thus cannot put aside theological explanations in the\ncourse of analysing different self-understandings. Third, diplomatic achievements and\nfailures are hard to evaluate, as they are conducted behind closed doors and tend to remain\nsecretive.8\nIt is thus inevitable that any study, other than a single case study, remains in large por-\ntions abstract and eventually must point out the necessity of further field studies. In its\nfirst part, this section builds on the legal and historical trajectory of the HS diplomatic\npractice. Based on such a conventional account of HS diplomatic practice, the second part\nweaves together the education of HS diplomats and conceptualizations of their practice in\ncompliance with the tasks of ordinary diplomats. From a perspective of substantive con-\nceptions of agent's missions and under the lens of a political mode of agency, HS diplo-\nmats appear like other diplomats. However, the remainder of the section illustrates that\nhow diplomatic tasks are accomplished depends on how diplomats act on the ground\nbased on intersubjective practices and standards of excellence within their communities.\nThose practices and standards of excellence render them not only under a political but\nalso religious mode of agency.\nHS diplomats are engaged in traditional secular diplomacy such as the aspiration of\ngood relations between the HS and the host nation. In doing so, diplomats represent the\npope as the head of the Catholic Church and not as the head of the Vatican.9 The legal\nembodiment of the Church is the HS (the papacy) which is an international personality in\ninternational law. In terms of international law, the `State of the Vatican City' and the HS\nare different entities. They are linked by the personal-union with the pope, the supreme\nhead of the Catholic Church and the Vatican City. The foreign relations of Vatican City\nare managed by the HS, which is subject to international law. In operational terms, the\nmanagement comprises the HS Secretary of State and its subordinate, the Secretary of\nRelations with States.10 In 2017, Pope Francis created a third section, the Secretary of\nStates (`Section for the Holy See diplomatic staff'), which is exclusively dedicated to the\nwork of the nuncios (Agasso, 2017). Its installation is yet another indicator of the continu-\ning importance the Church attributes to its diplomatic engagement.\nEver since the development of the modern international system, its entities needed a\nway to communicate in a structural establishment marked by the gap in the relationship\nthen that diplomacy became a formalised interaction between political entities. From its\nbeginning, the HS participated in this formalised interaction. This was not only because\n(after the Lateran Treaties in 1929) the HS acquired a formal territory, but because it\npressed to preserve its normative influence in the international society.11 First attempts of\nregulated and institutionalised diplomatic activities of the HS date back to the 15th cen-\ntury when it became necessary to regulate rights and obligations between the Church and\nvarious political entities. The institutionalisation of HS diplomatic practice was not the\nresult of one particular pope or period of history but evolved impulsively. In modern\ntimes this impulsive character of the institutionalisation of HS diplomatic practice became\nvisible as the diplomatic apparatus drastically expanded during the regency of Pope John\naround the globe and newly consolidated nations keep seeking recognition from the HS\nThe conduct of the diplomatic apparatus such as the maintenance of nunciatures is\nregulated in the Code of Canon law.14 Nunciatures regularly report on matters of the\nCatholic Church in host countries, and they seek unity between the HS and the local\nChurch. Since the Congress of Vienna the Doyen (the senior ambassador) of the diplo-\nmatic Corps has been recurrently the nuncio, at least in Roman Catholic countries.15 In\nterms of international law, nunciatures hold the same status as embassies. Canon law\noffers a range of functions for papal legates, most of them dealing with internal matters\nof the Church such as assisting local bishops. These internal matters include traditional\nclerical duties, such as the appointments of bishops, which influence domestic and inter-\nnational politics as the contested cases in the People's Republic of China illustrate (Wee,\n2014). However, that clerical task routinely propels critics to point out that canon law\nsuggests that the nuncio is a papal watchdog to supervise the local Catholic Church (that\nis, the dioceses).16\nThe HS diplomatic envoys and nunciatures had their high-days in the medieval ages\nand early modern era. Later, the popes themselves took over the diplomatic agenda (Kent\nand Pollard, 1994b), applying traditional, symbolic, legal, and representational instru-\nments of diplomacy in their every-day conduct. Scholars of diplomacy and International\nRelations thus partly attribute the evolution of the diplomatic culture as we know it today\nto Christendom, noting a Christian influence on the diplomatic culture up to the present\nConventional education, conventional practice?\nThe Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica, founded by Pope Clemens XI in 1701 in Rome,\ncultivates the religious influence on ordinary diplomacy. In modern times, it played an\nimportant part in professionalising the diplomatic service of the HS, as it consolidated its\nbureaucracy, particularly in the first half of the 20th century (Alvarez, 1989). The acad-\nemy proved to be the prime educational site for future high ranking Church officials and\npopes. Popes themselves influenced the Church's domestic and international reputation\n528 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)\nacademy but a respected diplomat, was a powerful influence, as were his successors Paul\npolicy, was a frequent guest at the academy. The task of the academy is to acquire and\neducate young clerics from the `Roman-cultural' environment for future tasks in the sec-\nretary of state or in nunciatures.17 Since the foundation of the academy its presidents were\nNot least due to its geographical location, for the most part the academy remains\nItalian in character and with the exception of a few outsiders, the Secretaries of States, its\nmost prominent alumni, have been Italian (Kent and Pollard, 1994a: 12).19 At his first\naddress to the community of the academy, Pope Francis called for the education of future\npapal representatives as priestly ministers, a task that demands `great inner freedom' and\nthe abandonment of `careerism'.20 Given its 300years history and influence on the educa-\ntion of Church officials, the question of whether the Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica\nThe existence of HS diplomats over the course of centuries and their conventional train-\ning illustrates that the papacy is not unique compared to other diplomatic actors in the\ninternational realm. It is yet another example of institutional accommodation and struc-\ntural modernization of the diplomatic service, with the aim of establishing a traditional and\nfunctional diplomatic apparatus (Alvarez, 1989: 248). In this regard, HS diplomacy is a\nperformance of a host of practices that follow the general practices of a diplomatic com-\nmunity (Sharp and Wiseman, 2007) such as maintaining permanent representatives in\nstates and international organisations. Those practices are patterned as they entail particu-\nlar rules (for instance, the ones laid out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations),\nthey are competent because diplomats are educated practitioners and the education is insti-\ntutionalised, and they rely on institutionalised background knowledge. Accordingly, as\ndiplomats, the agents of the HS tend to be skillful in their practice.\nThe practice of HS diplomats also weaves together discursive and material worlds. Its\ndiplomats engage in a dialogue that weaves together claims of the Church's moral author-\nity with material worlds such as the vast bureaucratic infrastructure of the HS and its\nnunciatures worldwide.22 They are essentially legally recognised agents in an interna-\ntional society that grounds its dialogue in diplomacy (Watson, 1991). They are trained as\ndiplomats, they are experts in the tasks and missions assigned to them and based on their\nreligious affiliation they are nominally also moral experts. This phenomenon becomes\nobvious in looking at how diplomats pursue and engage in different foreign policy goals.\nDiplomats participate in shaping and acquiring possession and milieu goals of foreign\nsession goals aim at the enhancement or preservation of something the actor values.\nMilieu goals, on the other side, aim to shape the conditions beyond the actor's immediate\npossessions. Seen from the perspective of the HS, priority is assigned to milieu goals on\nthe grounds of its universal salvic mission. A marker of the emphasis on milieu goals is\nthe HS gaining of a seat as a permanent observer at the United Nations.\nIn line with his `bolder' vision of diplomacy (Povoledo, 2013; Yardley, 2014), Pope\nFrancis called for a more intense dialogue with Islam and a renewed diplomatic discourse\nwith states that have no official ties with the HS. The HS has no official diplomatic ties\nwith China or North Korea but in both cases, there are various movements on the side of\nthe HS, either to improve relations or to establish institutionalised relations.23 The engage-\nment in milieu goals illustrates the weight the Church places on the practice and\ninstitution of diplomacy. To be sure, pursuing milieu goals is not always successful or\nappreciated by other actors in the international society. The HS, for example, was blamed\nfor triggering the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s by prematurely recognising the inde-\nThe participation of the HS in international organisations is not least due to increasing\npluralism in international politics, which calls for an institutionalisation of diplomacy\n(Mayall, 2007: 2). Since the pope has no `divisions', as Josef Stalin once allegedly\nremarked, establishing conventional formal relations with governments is one way to\nmaintain geopolitics based on the sheer numbers of humans involved (Agnew, 2010). In\nthis regard, the HS is a rare example24 of a non-state actor with diplomatic privileges,\nrecognised by the majority of states in the international realm, of which diplomacy is a\nfoundational and institutionalised pillar (Bull, 2002; Bull and Watson, 1984; J\u00f6nsson and\nHall, 2005; Wight, 1997). It is therefore no surprise that the HS supported the develop-\nment of modern international governmental organisations (Chong and Troy, 2011;\nAs principal, the HS seeks to justify its engagement in shaping possession and milieu\ngoals on theological grounds, communicated by its agents which establish the hybrid\ndiplomatic agency. However, although there are policy guidelines for both goals, their\nimplementation process is far from being coherently implemented by the agents, which\nillustrates the limits of a conventional notion of practice.\nThe Pope's eye, heart, and hand: Ordinary and ordained\nHS Secretary of State Pietro Parolin characterises HS diplomacy as `human diplo-\nmacy' because `real people must be at the centre of all diplomatic action'.26 According\nrepresentation is `to bring the leaven of the Gospel to all the complex reality of inter-\nnational relations and to international debates'. The aims of HS diplomats are to serve\nand represent the interests of the Church, to maintain or establish peace between\nnations, and the empowerment of international and supranational structures (Sharp,\nreads the statement by the HS mission to the United Nations on the purpose of its\nagents. `What they do seek', instead, `is what the HS, by its very nature and tradition,\ncan offer: orientation and spiritual inspiration that should animate the life of nations\nand their mutual relationships'.27 This spiritual duty is also reflected in the Church's\nCanon law:\ndiplomatic relations of the pope are always carried on in light of [the] spiritual mission, hence\nlegates represent the Holy See [...]; civil governments enter into relations not with the State of\nVatican City but with the Holy See itself [and] the title given representatives of the Holy See\n(`nuncios' rather than `ambassadors') is intended to underscore the particular nature of their\nThe `Apostolic Nuncio is one of the most characteristic signs of the Pope's presence in\na nation', as Pope John XXIII, former nuncio to France, summarised it. Moreover, pon-\ntifical `and national diplomacy have a common basis in frankness and in the constant\neffort to improve relations. But they differ in their essential characteristics' (Pope John\n530 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)\nXXIII, 1966: 105). The nuncio is the pope's eye, heart and hand in the host state. What\nPope John XXIII stated for his position while nuncio in France can be read as the tasks of\nan ideal-type nuncio:\nAn eye ever open to serene observation of the moral, religious and social state of France, in\norder to render a true and objective account to the Supreme Pastor.Aheart watchful and sensitive\nto the needs of the people of Christ, as hungry for spiritual foods as they are for bodily sustenance.\nThe Pope's own heart indeed, for his mission is not to busy himself with material conquests and\nearthly interests, and not to follow in the ways of intrigue and hatred, but to observe the law of\nbrotherhood and love. Finally, a hand to point to the right road, a hand which, in the Lord's\nname, succours, encourages and blesses. This is still and will always be the Pope's own hand\noutstretched, reproduced in the person and office of his Nuncio, in France and in every other\nThis instruction is similar to conceptualizations of ordinary diplomatic modes of\nagency and conventional notions of practice, which is obvious in both the first and the last\nsentence of the quote. It stresses the importance of the diplomat's task of gathering infor-\nmation and communicating interests. It combines the view of diplomats as representing a\nprincipal in behaviour (to act for others) and in status (to stand for others) (J\u00f6nsson and\nHall, 2005: 100). It illustrates the thin line between representation and governing (Mitzen,\n2015) when it asserts that the nuncio should point `to the right road'. Finally, the instruc-\ntion indicates that nuncios, like ordinary diplomats, also act on behalf of certain ideas and\nnot only on behalf of governments and principals. Peace has been seen as the most elusive\nof human ideas, and is indeed an objective in this regard (J\u00f6nsson and Hall, 2005: 116;\nobjective of peace predates the objective of serving the principal (Sharp, 1997: 616) as an\nasset that mediates between different entities.\nThis instruction is also an expression of the religious mode of diplomatic agency and as\nsuch it is illustrative of the HS hybrid character with regard to diplomacy. Pope Francis,\naddressing the diplomatic academy, reinforced the main elements of the religious mode of\nagency in this instruction. In particular, he stressed the need for HS diplomats to keep their\nspirituality amid their worldly tasks and pointed out that their future life will be inserted in\ndifferent societal contexts. He also pointed out that HS diplomats need to be examples in\ntheir lives, characterised by closure, dialogue, listening but also tangible verbal action.\nWhat is more, he stressed that HS diplomats need to serve the evangelization without pros-\nelytising as the Church grows by attraction (Pope Francis, 2013; Radio Vatikan, 2017).\nHybrid modes of agency in practice\nThe remainder of this section turns to three cases of nuncios in turmoil ridden historical\nepisodes. The cases illustrate that although there are outlines of an ideal-type nuncio such\nas illustrated above, their practical mode of agency remains a hybrid one as it comes into\nexistence through the interaction of different origins. Although any hybrid mode has its\nown outstanding characteristics and remains hybrid in nature, it varies in degree. This\nvariance is no different in the case of HS diplomats. The three episodes of the nuncios\nJoseph Hurley, Jose Laboa, and Fernando Filoni illustrate that the mix of principal steered\npossession and milieu goals, diplomatic practice, and the self-understanding of the agents\nadd up to a contextualization of the HS diplomatic service and the practices of its mem-\nbers as a hybrid mode of agency.\nJoseph P. Hurley from the United States was perhaps one of the most influential yet\nlargely unknown papal diplomats in the 20th century. Hurley originally served in the\nJapan mission in the 1930s and was a warning voice of National Socialism and Fascism.\nHe served again as nuncio in the 1940s in Yugoslavia and became known for his fierce\nstand against Communism. Hurley is an outstanding example of a papal diplomat as he\nresembles many of the aforementioned ideal type features of ordinary diplomats. He was\nsympathetic towards an approach of diplomacy understood as `high politics' such as\nsecretively operating behind the scenes and keeping a low public profile. Yet he also\nbelieved his role to be the `Pope's own hand outstretched'. Throughout his life, he was\ntorn between serving his two masters: the United States and the Church, and rival inter-\npretations over the mission of them (Gallagher, 2008: 1\u00ad3). In the early Cold War years,\nhe sided with the US State Department, with which he became disappointed in the 1950s\nas he found no more `convergence between Catholic ideas and U.S. political realities'\nThe episode of Hurley illustrates how difficult it is to grasp the practice of HS diplo-\nmats along the religious model of diplomatic agency. During several stages of his career\nHurley, in many respects, might have come close to a conventional diplomat but he\nremained so in ordinary diplomatic terms.Although he assumed his role as serving church\nand country, he sometimes placed the mission of the latter over the former. Arguably, in\nthis regard Hurley was a classic example of a power politic driven agent, mediating\nbetween different political entities. As Hurley tried to serve two principals, he encoun-\ntered difficulties in doing justice to both as well as becoming even more disappointed\nwhen the two principals parted ways in their goals in the 1950s. The story of Hurley\nillustrates that HS diplomacy is not always conducted along standardised diplomatic\npractices. In Hurley's case, this divergence meant that he drifted from representing to\ngoverning, mediated by personal beliefs regarding the political and the religious realm.\nYet still, he complied with the art of diplomacy as a form of high politics and certainly\nwas seen as an outstanding diplomat.\nAnother episode illustrates how a papal agent got caught between the principal's for-\neign policy goals and ended up improvising. It is the episode of how Panamanian leader\nManuel Noriega was eventually handed over into the hands of US authorities. In 1989,\nrather unexpectedly, Jose Sebastian Laboa from Spain and nuncio to Panama was faced\nwith the difficulties that serving possession goals bring with them when Noriega took\nrefuge in the nunciature. Without being able to consult the HS at first, the nuncio extended\nthe diplomatic immunity to another house to separate Noriega from his aids. Eventually,\nLaboa, who had been encouraging anti-Noriega forces before, was able to sway Noriega\nout of the embassy and into the hands of US forces. He did so through a carefully orches-\ntrated psychological campaign, warning Noriega of the danger of being lynched or by\ntalking about loyalty at the Catholic Mass. All of this practice aimed to convince Noriega\nillustrated the behaviour of a classical rationalist driven agent of international society,\nsubtly complying with international law to achieve his goals. However, because Laboa\nturned to the religious practice of the Catholic Mass attended by Noriega, as a means to\npractice diplomacy, Laboa also relied on elements only an ordained diplomat can turn to\nsuch as the Catholic liturgy.\nThe episodes of Hurley and Laboa illustrate that, on the surface, HS diplomats operate\nlike ordinary diplomats, face the same challenges, and rely on the same instruments.\n532 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)\nHowever, they also know how to use their authority as ordained diplomats. Without an\nin-depth study into the agents motives, the episodes only hint towards a genuine hybrid\nmode of agency. We can find this mode in operation in the more recent case of nuncio\nFernando Filoni, originally from Italy.\nRecalling the mediation of difference and estrangement, Filoni's case illustrates how\nHS diplomats are an inherent part of the host society, and not only the Catholic part of it.\nFiloni was the representative of the Pope in Iraq in 2014 but first became famous for\nremaining on his post as nuncio in Iraq during the 2003 US bombing of Bagdad (Allen,\n2014; Filoni, 2009). Explaining his remaining on in the post, he argued that it `was noth-\ning exceptional. To live in Baghdad during the war was a decision in line with the mission\nof a pontifical representative who ... by residing in the countries participates, or rather\ninserts himself into their life. Our very situation in itself led us to share the destiny of the\nIraqi people with all their sufferings, injustices and hopes'.28 Filoni's actions constituted\na modality of practice and discourse of a Church of the margins as it is today attributed to\nPope Francis'conception of the Church (Ferrara, 2015; Ivereigh, 2015) and its diplomatic\nservice more broadly. In this regard, Filoni appears as an advocate of a cosmopolitan idea\nof world society. While staying in the apostolic nunciature in 2003 and justifying his stay,\nhe weaved together claims of religious agency and political agency based on material\nworlds such as diplomatic representation. The episode of Filoni illustrates what an ideal-\ntype of a hybrid agent of papal diplomacy could look like. It emphasises the need for a\ndiplomat to insert himself into the society of the host nation and eventually to rely on\npossession goals (such as immunity of diplomatic premises) and milieu goals (for\ninstance, emphasising the universal mission of the Church).\nSeen in chronological order of the historical episodes described above, HS diplomatic\npractice seems to move from a realist system, over the rationalist society, towards the\nrevolutionist world society approach (Wight, 1991). The episode of Hurley illustrates the\npersistence of the realist tradition of international society as international system. Caught\nin great power rivalries, Hurley aligned himself with one ideological side, using diplo-\nmatic expertise and legal status to influence foreign policy. In doing so, he practised\ndiplomacy as `high politics', argued for on moral grounds. The episode of Laboa and his\nsubtle compliance with international law illustrates renewed rationalist aspirations of\ninternational society at the end of the Cold War. Finally, the episode of Filoni shows a\nmodality of a Church of the margins, resembling the revolutionist approach of interna-\ntional society as world society that seeks to set itself against the state system and its secu-\nlar conventions. The episodes also illustrate that HS diplomats are representatives of an\nentity that is not their own in terms of inter-state relations. They are born in one country\nand represent another political and religious entity to a third country. The hybrid nature of\ntheir agency is thus a rather convenient fact that waives the inherent strangeness that\naccompanies ordinary diplomats on their tasks.\nConclusion\nDespite the weakening influence of the Eurocentric Catholic Church, HS diplomacy con-\ntinues to play a vital role for the Church itself and in international society. In conflicts\naround the world either a Catholic majority or a significant Catholic minority is at home.\nMoreover, in a global Church its officials are from all over the world rather than only\nfrom the Roman ecosystem. Globally, religion wields an arguably growing influence in\ninternational politics (Thomas, 2010), and there is more space for creative diplomatic\nengagement (Constantinou et al., 2016), both of which are significant trends for the future\nof understanding diplomacy and international politics. The HS, for example, has found\nglobal reach and mobility accompanying globalisation as a vehicle to overcome the tradi-\ntional territorial and nation bound state (Turina, 2015: 201) without giving away its secu-\nlar features of diplomatic practice (Parolin, 2017).\nA renewed interest in diplomacy is not least propelled by the current Pope and his\nintermingling in conflicts around the world (Gaetan, 2015, 2017). He refuses to align\nhimself in global politics and continues to expand his diplomatic corps (Franco, 2013;\nJones and Mackenzie, 2015). This choice comes as no surprise as diplomacy is constitu-\ntive for the participants in international society and thus also the Church: it is a fundamen-\ntal and durable practice; it is constitutive of the HS in recognising the world of states and\nthe formalised way of maintaining official ties therein; and its patterned structure and\nagency legitimate its activities in relations to others as it sticks to the formalised rules of\nconducting this practice. Particularly, the last point illustrates that HS diplomacy is also a\nform of conduct created by a set of standards in which agents are guided by practices.\nHS diplomats, as the three episodes of nuncios illustrate, exercise authority under\nlegal, moral, and expert modalities, weaving together secular and religious discourses and\npractices. They are essentially and functionally recognised agents in the international\nsociety that grounds its dialogue on diplomacy. All three trained as diplomats and experts\nin their tasks and missions. Based on their religious affiliation, they are nominally also\nmoral experts. The three episodes illustrate how modalities and discourses interact and\nsometimes trump each other. In doing so, they also illustrate that international society is\nnot a one-way street to a justly governed world society (Wight, 1991: 266).\nEarly English School scholars put forward the claim that religious institutions are con-\nstitutive for international society. Those claims, however, have been picked up only reluc-\ntantly in subsequent studies. The entanglement between religious institutions and\ninternational society, after all, remains an understudied topic.29 The theoretical conceptu-\nalizations of power, diplomacy, and international society demonstrate insights into the HS\ndiplomatic conduct while not only framing diplomacy as a category of analysis but also\nas one of explanation. Diplomacy is a practice because political units need to interact and\nwant to stay apart. In the conduct of international society, this gap is filled by the practice\nof diplomats, no less so by the ones of the HS. They are even more likely to bridge this\ngap because estrangement on the cultural and religious level tends to be low but remains\nintact when it comes to secular duties where social distance remains a condition for pur-\nsuing foreign policy goals. The findings of this article suggest a renewed research interest\nlooking into the interplay between the hybrid agency of diplomats and structural issues of\ninternational society.\n"
