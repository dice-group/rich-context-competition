Measures of cardiovascular disease risk were\nof total energy). Multivariable means were weighted to be representative of US adolescents and variances adjusted for\nthe complex sampling methods. Daily consumption of added sugars averaged 21.4% of total energy. Added sugars\nintake was inversely correlated with mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (mmol/L) which were 1.40 (95%\n(P trend 0.001). Added sugars were positively correlated with low-density lipoproteins (P trend 0.01) and geometric\nmean triglycerides (P trend 0.05). Among the lowest and highest consumers, respectively, low-density lipoproteins\nadded sugars were positively correlated with the homeostasis model assessment (P linear trend 0.004).\nConclusion--Consumption of added sugars among US adolescents is positively associated with multiple measures known\nKey Words: Sugars  cardiovascular diseases  risk factors  lipids  triglycerides  diabetes mellitus\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of\nmorbidity and mortality among US adults. Whereas\natherosclerosis and CVD occur later in life, their risk factors,\nincluding lipid disorders,1 diabetes mellitus,2 and obesity are\nincreasingly identified among adolescents and even children.\nCurrently 32% of US children and adolescents aged 2 to 18\nyears are overweight or obese.3 Though CVD among children\nis rare, an increase in risk factors at younger ages and their\napparent tendency to track into adulthood highlights the need\nfor early and effective prevention efforts.4\u00ad6\nLifestyle changes, including dietary change, have long been a\ncentral focus of efforts to reduce CVD risk. Since the 1950s\nAmericans have been advised to reduce their consumption of\nfats and cholesterol and replace them with complex carbohy-\ndrates.7 It appears that, in part, Americans have followed this\nadvice. But whereas food disappearance data suggest that fat\nconsumption has decreased, it is refined rather than complex\ncarbohydrates that have increased. Although the overall health\nimpact of this trend is unclear, several studies have shown a\npositive correlation between the consumption of carbohydrates,\nparticularly some sugars, and the presence of CVD risk fac-\ntors.8\u00ad10 A recent longitudinal study among women demon-\nstrated that the incidence of CVD was increased among higher\nconsumers of sugar-sweetened beverages,11 the largest contrib-\nutor of added sugars in the US diet.12 Studies comparing the\nimpact of different sugars have demonstrated that the monosac-\ncharide fructose, but not glucose, raises triglyceride levels and\nlowers high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, suggesting that\nthe metabolic impact may differ substantially by sugar type.10,13\nAdded sugars are refined calorie-containing sweeteners\nadded to foods and beverages during processing or prepara-\nFrom the Nutrition and Health Science Program (J.A.W., A.S., M.B.V.) and Department of Pediatrics, Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition,\nEmory University School of Medicine (M.B.V.), Graduate Division of Biological and Medical Sciences, and Department of Global Health, Rollins\nSchools of Public Health (S.A.C.), Emory University, Atlanta, GA; Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (J.A.W., M.B.V.), Atlanta, GA; and Division of\nNutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (A.S.), Atlanta, GA.\nThe findings of this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\nCorrespondence to Jean A.

Consumption of these sugars has increased substantially\nin recent decades. Sugars used to sweeten soft drinks have\nbecome the largest single source of calories in the US diet.14\n16% of their total energy from added sugars; adolescents, the\nhighest consumers, obtained 20% of their energy from\nthese sugars.15 Today in the US, the most commonly con-\nsumed added sugars are refined beet or cane sugar (sucrose)\nand high fructose corn syrup,16 both of which contribute\nfructose and glucose in approximately equal amounts to the\ndiet.

The purpose of our study was to\ndetermine if there is an association between the consumption\nof added sugars and indicators of CVD risk among US\nadolescents and to determine if body weight modifies this\nassociation.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Subjects\nData for our study come from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is a sequential series of\ncross-sectional surveys of the US civilian noninstitutionalized pop-\nulation designed to obtain nationally representative estimates on diet\nand health indicators. A description of the complex sampling\nmethodology is described elsewhere.19 The study sample consists of\nexclusion) were those with unreliable20 or implausible (600 or\nwith extreme triglyceride levels (300 mg/dL; n23), those with\npreviously diagnosed diabetes mellitus (n9), and those with miss-\ning covariate data (n104). After exclusions, the total sample for\nthis study included 2157 adolescents. Study protocols for NHANES\nNational Center for Health Statistics.21 Signed informed consent was\nobtained from all participants and their parent/guardian.\nAdded Sugars and Other Dietary Intake\ndietary recall was used to assess dietary intake from all participants.\nphone from all respondents. For consistency, we used only the first\ndietary recall to assess intake for all participants in the primary\nanalysis. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the\nmean added sugars intake for each of the respondents in NHANES\nmined by NHANES using the Food and Nutrient Database for\nDietary Studies, which uses food composition data from the US\nDepartment of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard\nReference.22 Because the Standard Reference database does not\ninclude information on the added sugar content of many foods, we\nmerged the individual food files from NHANES with the most\nrecently released MyPyramid Equivalents database (MPED) files,\nMPED database provides standard serving size information for the\nmajor food categories found on the US Department of Agriculture\nFood Guide Pyramid (grains, meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and\nbeans), as well as for added sugars and discretionary fats. A\ndescription of the MPED database24 and the methods used to\ncalculate the sugar content of foods can be found elsewhere.25\nTo determine the amount of added sugars consumed in each food\nand beverage, we multiplied the total amount consumed in grams (as\nprovided in the NHANES database) by the amount of added sugars\nin each of these foods (teaspoons/100 g; as provided in the MPED\ndatabase). The results for each food consumed were summed to\nobtain the total added sugars intake in teaspoons and converted to\ngrams by multiplying by 4.2 g/teaspoon.26 This result was multiplied\nby 4 kcal to obtain the total energy from added sugars. Finally, the\ntotal energy from added sugars (kcal) was divided by total energy\nintake (kcal/d) to obtain the percentage of total energy from added\nsugars.\nIndicators of CVD Risk\nBiological indicators known to be associated with CVD1,27,28 were\nmeasured in NHANES using standardized laboratory procedures that\nhave been described elsewhere.29 Measured lipids include fasting\nserum or plasma: HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and\ntriglycerides. Measured indicators of glucose metabolism include\nfasting insulin and glucose. Anthropometric measures (height,\nweight, and waist circumference) and blood pressure were measured\nby trained interviewers using standardized equipment and protocols.\nBody-mass-index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight and\nheight as kg/m2, and BMI was converted to age- and sex-\nstandardized percentiles and z-scores on the basis of Centers for\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were calculated using\nthe Friedewald formula: LDL cholesterol (mmol/L)TCHDL\ncholesteroltriglycerides/2.19.31 The homeostasis model assess-\nment (HOMA-IR) is an estimate of insulin resistance derived\nfrom fasting glucose and insulin levels, with higher levels\nrepresenting greater degrees of insulin resistance.32 HOMA-IR\nwas calculated using the formula developed by Mathews et al:\nfasting insulin (pmol/L)fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.33\nCovariates\nVariables previously shown to be associated with carbohydrate\nintake and with any of the CVD risk indicators specified above were\nincluded as covariates. These covariates include: measured waist\ncircumference and BMI, as well as self-reported demographic data\n(participant's age [in years], sex, income, and race/ethnicity [%\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other]).\nGiven the small sample size, Mexican-American and other Hispanic\nwere combined into a single category entitled \"Hispanic\" for\nanalyses. Because education, when compared to income and occu-\npation, has been shown to be the only measure of socioeconomic\nstatus significantly associated with measures of CVD risk,34 we\nincluded educational level of lease or mortgage holding parent/\nguardian (greater than high-school [yes or no]) in our models.\nBecause of the high number of missing values (7.5% of sample), we\nelected to not include income as a second measure of socioeconomic\nstatus. As a measure of physical activity, respondents were asked to\nprovide a list all of the moderate or vigorous leisure activities they\nengaged in over the previous month and to provide the frequency and\nthe usual duration of these activities. MET (metabolic equivalent)\nminutes were then calculated as the sum of the following for each\nreported activity: duration in minutesfrequencymetabolic equiva-\nlent intensity level (MET score).\nThe values for dietary covariates were determined using data from\none 24-hour dietary recall and included total energy intake and the\ntotal energy-adjusted nutrient residuals for fiber, other carbohydrates\n(excluding added sugars and fiber), saturated fats (SFAs), polyun-\nsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and monounsaturated fatty acids\n(MUFAs), proteins, fiber, sodium, and cholesterol. These nutrient\nresiduals were calculated using linear regression models with total\ncalorie intake as the predictor and the absolute intake of each nutrient\nof interest (in grams) as the outcome in order to separate the nutrient\neffect from that of the calories consumed.35\nData Analysis\nStatistical Analysis Software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)\nwas used for all analyses. Procedures that account for the complex\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nsampling methods used in NHANES were applied. Sample weights\nfor the 6 years of data that reflect the probability of selection,\nnonresponse, and poststratification adjustments were calculated as\n2004)19 and used to ensure that results were representative of the US\npopulation. To ensure sufficiently large sample sizes in each group,\nrespondents were grouped into 6 groups of approximately equal size\nby the percentage of their total energy intake from added sugars: 0%\nwas considered statistically significant for main effects.\nPercentages, means, and standard error (SE) of key variables were\ncalculated to describe the sample at each level of added sugars\nintake. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship\nbetween intake of added sugars and our outcome measures while\ncontrolling for the effect of potentially confounding variables. As the\ndistribution of triglycerides was skewed, the values in the linear\nregression models were log transformed, and geometric means are\npresented. Estimate statements in the regression models were used to\ndetermine the adjusted mean of each of the measures of CVD risk for\neach level of added sugar intake.36 Contrasts were used to specify\nlinear tests among the levels of added sugars consumption and to\ncompare each group of respondents to the referent group (10% of\ntotal energy from added sugars) for each of the outcomes of\ninterest.36 2 tests were used to test differences in categorical\nvariables and Wald f-tests were used for continuous variables.\nTo identify the macronutrients to be included in our regression\nmodels, we first performed bivariate analyses to assess the associa-\ntion between the intake of total fat and the intake of protein with each\nof our outcomes. The energy-adjusted residuals for protein but not\nfat were found to be associated with measures of dysglycemia\n(fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR), blood pressure, and\nadiposity (BMI and waist circumference). Therefore, we included\nprotein but not fat intake as a covariate in these models. Because we\nalso controlled for total energy intake and intake of carbohydrates\n(other than added sugars), results obtained using these models can be\ninterpreted as the effect of replacing fat in the diet (the macronutrient\nleft out of the models) with added sugars.35 In contrast, the energy\nadjusted residuals for the intake of PUFAs, MUFAs, and SFAs, but\nnot proteins, were each found, in bivariate analyses, to be associated\nwith blood lipid measures (HDL, LDL, TC, and triglycerides).\nTherefore, we included the intake of each of these dietary fats, but\nnot protein, in the models with lipid measures as the outcome. The\nresults of these models can be interpreted at the effect of replacing\nprotein in the diet with added sugars.\nBecause of problems with multicollinearity in models that in-\ncluded both BMI and waist circumference, waist circumference was\ndropped from the regression models. Given that postprandial li-\npoprotein37 and insulin responses38 have been shown to differ by\nbody weight, race, and sex, we tested for the presence of effect\nmodification between level of added sugars intake and each of these\nvariables by including a multiplicative term for each in the models.\nBody weight was dichotomized as not overweight (85th percentile\nP value of 0.10 was considered significant.\nSensitivity analysis was performed to examine the association\nbetween intake of added sugars and HDL and HOMA-IR levels\nusing the absolute intake of added sugar (in grams) as the exposure\nrather than the proportion of total energy from added sugars. To do\nthis we grouped all respondents into 6 groups of equal size according\nto the grams of added sugars consumed. In addition, to determine if\nour results were consistent when data from two 24-hour recalls were\nused, we repeated our analysis using a smaller (30%) subsample of\nrespondents from whom a second 24-hour dietary recall had been\ncollected. In these analyses, the mean intake of added sugars\n(percentage total energy) and of other dietary covariates was used for\neach respondent together with the same nondietary covariates de-\nscribed for the models above.\nResults\nA description of the study sample by level of added sugars is\nprovided in Table 1. No significant differences were seen\nbetween level of added sugars consumed and demographic\nfactors, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty, or educa-\ntional level. Similarly, no association was seen between the\namount of added sugars consumed and physical activity or\ntotal energy intake.\ncaloric intake (total energy; not shown). There was no\nsignificant difference in consumption across racial/ethnic\ngroups. The increased trend in percentage total energy from\ncarbohydrates with higher intake of added sugars was signif-\nicant (P linear trend 0.0001), as was the increased trend in\nthe absolute intake of carbohydrates (P linear trend 0.0001\n(Table 1). Intake of added sugars was negatively correlated\nwith both the percentage total energy and the absolute intake\n(g) of total fats, SFAs, PUFAs, MUFAs, and protein (P linear\ntrend 0.0001 for all).

We found in-\ncreased dyslipidemia (lower HDLs and higher LDLs and\ntriglyceride levels) among adolescents, regardless of body\nsize, and increased insulin resistance (higher fasting insulin\nand HOMA-IR measures) among those overweight or obese\nwith higher intake of added sugars. Several mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to explain the dysmetabolic effects of carbo-\nhydrates and specifically sugars. These include (1) the insulin\nresponse to the metabolism of high\u00adglycemic index foods,\nsuch as processed sugars, that cause a rapid postprandial rise\nand fall in glucose levels; (2) the increased de novo lipogen-\nesis that results when high levels of fructose are metabolized\nby the liver; and (3) increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis\ncombined with increased secretion and/or decreased clear-\nance of very-low-density lipoproteins.46 Modification of the\neffect of added sugars on measures of glucose metabolism by\nweight status could be explained by the decreased insulin\nsensitivity known to result from increased adiposity.38\nClearly, added sugars play a significant role in the US diet.\nThey increase the desirability of foods by increasing sweet-\nness. They also contribute substantially to energy intake\nwithout contributing other important nutrients to the diet.47\nExisting guidelines for limiting the consumption of added\nsugars vary widely. The Institute of Medicine suggests a limit\nof 25% of total energy from added sugars in order to ensure\nadequate intake of important nutrients,48 the World Health\nOrganization advises limiting added sugars to 10% total\nenergy to prevent dental caries, obesity, and chronic disease49\nand recently released recommendations from the American\nHeart Association advise that daily intake of added sugars\ncalories for men46 (5% of total energy) as a strategy for\npreventing heart disease. The 2005 US Dietary Guidelines for\nAmericans encourage consumers to \"choose and prepare\nfoods and beverages with little added sugars or caloric\nsweeteners\"47 but do not specify an upper limit. Although our\nresults support the need for dietary guidelines that encourage\nlower intake of added sugars, they also highlight the need for\na comprehensive examination of the evidence on the effect of\nadded sugars on cardiovascular and other chronic disease risks.\nFigure 1.

First, we have\nused nationally representative data, and, to our knowledge,\nthis is the first study to assess the association between added\nsugars and indicators of CVD risk among US adolescents.\nSecond, we were able to control for several important\nconfounding variables, including BMI, socioeconomic status,\nand physical activity. Also, because we had complete 24-hour\ndietary recall data on all participants, we were able to control\nfor total energy intake, the intake of specific fats, and other\ndietary factors. Availability of a second 24-hour dietary recall\nin a subsample of respondents enabled us to do a sensitivity\nanalysis using the mean of 2 days intake of added sugars.\nFinally, the use of trained staff following standardized pro-\ntocols to measure height and weight and collect laboratory\nand interview data increases the accuracy and validity of the\ndata collected.\nOur study is also subject to some limitations. Cross-\nsectional studies such as ours are limited by the fact that\nexposures and outcomes are measured at the same time. As a\nresult, our data can be used only to assess associations. They\ncannot be used to assess the direction or temporarily of these\nassociations or to determine causality. Also, as only a single\n24-hour dietary recall was used to assess diet, the dietary\nintake data may not represent the usual diet of respondents.\nOur inability to account for within person day-to-day vari-\nability may have resulted in some misclassification of the\nintake of added sugars, but we expect that this would be\nrandom.50 In addition, when we evaluated those with 2\navailable 24-hour recalls, key findings remained consistent.\nWhereas underreporting of certain foods high in sugars,\nsuch as sodas and sweets, may occur more frequently among\nthose who underreport total energy,51 such as those over-\nweight or obese52 who are also at increased risk of diabetes\nmellitus and dyslipidemia, systematic misclassification of this\ntype would be expected to bias our findings toward the null.\nIn addition, as no information on the validity of the process\nused to estimate added sugar content data in the US Depart-\nment of Agriculture MPED database is available, there could\nbe some misclassification of our exposure variable. Similarly,\nbecause the instruments used to assess important covariates\nsuch as physical activity have not been validated in this\npopulation, residual confounding could also be present.\nIn conclusion, higher consumption of added sugars among\nUS adolescents is associated with several important CVD risk\nfactors. Though long-term trials to study the effect of reduc-\ning the consumption of added sugars are needed, the results of\nthis study suggest that future risk of CVD may be reduced by\nminimizing consumption of added sugars among adolescents.\n"
