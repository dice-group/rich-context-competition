    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article explores the growing presence of digital animation within the work of contemporary\nvisual artists, architects and designers concerned with urban geography. While contemporary\ntheorists such as Bernard Stiegler and Mark Hansen have emphasized the ways in which digital\nmedia technologies have colonized cultural memory and foreclosed access to a collectively\nenvisioned future, socially engaged architects and artists have turned to animation as a medium that\nretains an important aesthetic potential. Digital animation has thus become a primary method for\nboth envisioning alternative urban futures and reconstructing the traumatic past within politically\nengaged work. This article focuses on four examples, two past and two future-oriented. The\nconceptual artist Stan Douglas has recently, and uncharacteristically, adopted digital animation and\ngaming technologies in his Circa 1948 collaboration with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).\nThe interactive app allows Douglas to re-activate a repressed period of Vancouver's past, thereby\nquestioning the narratives of progress and property speculation that dominate the contemporary\ncity. The work of Eyal Weizman and the Forensic Architecture project has increasingly involved\nthe use of digital animation techniques to both reconstruct and visualize key dates or events\nwithin moments of humanitarian crisis. In the Rafah: Black Friday case study, for example, digital\nanimation and 3D modelling are used to reconstruct a particularly intense four days of bombing\nduring the 2014 Israeli military offensive in Gaza. The artist Larissa Sansour merges live action\nand digital animation to visually depict bleak and disturbingly convincing Palestinian futures, and\nthe `speculative architect' Liam Young has been employing animation techniques to present urban\nscenarios that teeter between the technologically utopian and dystopian.\n",

(Mark Fisher, 2009: 3)\nThe very unfortunate recent passing of cultural theorist Mark Fisher was met with a level of wide-\nspread grief that confirmed the resonance and impact of his writing. A consistent and powerful\nrefrain within Fisher's many books, essays and blog posts is the sense that meaningful access to a\npast and a future beyond the daily experience of contemporary life has been effectively foreclosed.\nIn an increasingly financialized and digitized world, Fisher laments the diminished collective abil-\nity to establish either long-term memory or an alternative vision of what is to come. Current obses-\nsions with `the new'mask deeper indications of cultural inertia, according to Fisher, and significant\nchange in late-capitalism has become difficult to imagine, let alone enact. He therefore observes in\nGhosts of My Life: Writings on Depression, Hauntology and Lost Futures (2014: 8) that `the slow\ncancellation of the future has been accompanied by a deflation of expectations.' Nowhere has this\nsense of temporal and political impotence been more pronounced, I would argue, than in contem-\nporary urban life \u00ad the instability and displacement produced by property speculation and large-\nscale development projects has all but dismantled long-standing communities and prevented the\npublic from being meaningfully involved in imagining the future trajectory of their cities. Looking\nforward or backward is a temporal luxury most urban dwellers in major cities cannot afford as they\nbusy themselves with navigating the financial challenges of the immediate present.\nOnce regarded as possible tools for resisting these forms of destabilization, cotemporary digital\nmedia technologies are now more often assumed to be complicit in the intensification of these very\nprocesses. This article will begin by outlining a prominent strand of media philosophy that empha-\nsizes the role that digital technologies have played in blocking access to our collective past and cur-\ntailing our ability to project forward into the future. Media theorists Bernard Stiegler and Mark BN\nHansen have highlighted the `non-phenomenological' or `non-experiential' nature of contemporary\nmedia \u00ad the tendency of increasingly data-driven and corporatized digital technologies to condition\nour surrounding environment without being fully available to us as representations. These new forms\nof digital media, Stiegler and Hansen argue, attempt to instrumentalize our past and predetermine our\nfuture. While remaining cognizant of the temporal warnings issued by these thinkers, this article will\nnevertheless argue that we should not overlook the potential of digital media, and digital animation\nin particular, to productively intervene in the development of new urban imaginaries. If digital infor-\nmation is, as Stiegler and Hansen suggest, fundamentally inaccessible to our senses, then the impor-\ntance of digital animation (a medium essentially defined by its translation of digital information into\nrepresentational form) is arguably increasing rather than diminishing. This article will focus on the\nadoption of digital animation techniques by a growing field of artists, designers and architects con-\ncerned with re-potentializing and re-politicizing urban pasts and futures. In the hands of these artists\nand architects, animation becomes a tool for both visualizing digital information and accessing tem-\nporal registers beyond the restrictive confines of the immediate present. I will highlight here two\nexamples of animation-based projects directed towards the past \u00ad artist Stan Douglas's recreation of\na forgotten period of Vancouver's urban history and Forensic Architecture's use of digital techniques\nto document unacknowledged urban atrocities \u00ad as well as two projects oriented towards the future\n\u00ad artist Larissa Sansour's dystopian projections of a Palestinian future and `speculative architect'\nLiam Young's explorations of a coming techno-urbanity.1\nPhilosophies of non-experiential media\nMedia philosophers Bernard Stiegler and Mark BN Hansen both identify a paradox at the heart of\ncontemporary media experience. While the digital encroaches into ever more facets of everyday life,\nour current networked environments and computational media often operate below the threshold of\nour perception. Digital media, in other words, is everywhere in the contemporary world, yet it\nremains in important ways at a distance from us. Stiegler and Hansen, each in his own way, high-\nlight the lack of direct access to digital media in two interrelated respects: firstly, that computa-\ntional media or data is increasingly unavailable to our senses and is operating on a temporal scale\nthat is machine rather than human-oriented; and secondly, that contemporary media is made inac-\ncessible to us through its structures of ownership, storage and processing. While we all contribute\nto an accumulating reservoir of digital information through our participation in social media plat-\nforms, communication networks and online transactions, the ability to access this data pool and\nmake this information actionable is reserved for those few companies and institutions with consid-\nerable algorithmic and analytical resources at their disposal. This situation of participation without\naccess that characterizes our current digital media environments is important for this particular\ndiscussion because, as Stiegler and Hansen outline, it has implications for our formation and pres-\nervation of cultural memory and our ability to effectively imagine the future.\nAlthough Stiegler has been considering the relationship between memory, technology and human\nlife since the 1990s (the first of his multi-volume Technics and Time being published in French in\n1994), his impact on considerations of media and politics is on the ascendance withinAnglo scholar-\nship. This is due in part to the growing number of English translations of his work, but also to the\nsense that his system of thought appears increasingly prescient and relevant in the context of our\ncontemporary networked digital environments. One of Stiegler's consistent theoretical preoccupa-\ntions is the impact of exteriorized and technologically-based memory systems on the development\nof individual and collective life. More specifically, Stiegler (2009a: 97) is concerned with `the\nindustrialization of memory' that occurs when the symbols, images and sounds available to us are\nincreasingly provided by commercialized culture industries. Stiegler calls these exteriorized or pros-\nthetic forms of memory `tertiary retentions', which he further defines as `memory support objects\nand mnemotechniques that make the recording of traces possible \u00ad notably those photograms, pho-\nnograms, cinematograms, videograms, and digital technologies that form the technological infra-\nstructure of the societies of control in the hyper-industrial epoch' (Stiegler, 2011: 57).\nStiegler's position, while highly critical, is certainly not a call for a return to some kind of mythic\npre-technological age, for he insists that humans are technical beings from the start.As Hansen (2006:\n299) notes, `Stiegler argues for the co-originarity of technics and the human, in the sense that the\nbreak giving rise to the human as a distinct species simply is the invention of technics.'Tertiary reten-\ntions, or mnemotechniques, also pre-date the current industrial age in material and symbolic technical\nsystems ranging from libraries to the alphabet itself. These tertiary retentions are the means by which\nhuman knowledge and experience are transmitted through time and passed on intergenerationally, a\nprocess Stiegler (1994: 175) refers to as `epiphylogenesis'. The imperative for considering the rela-\ntionship between humans and their technical supports at the present moment, according to Stiegler, is\ndue to both the current `speed of technical evolution' (p. 17) and the transformation of these new\ndistributed memory infrastructures into systems of control through their entry into the logic of the\nindustrial economy. He thus writes in the first volume of Symbolic Misery (2014: 6):\nBeing increasingly constituted by images and sounds that the media streams through my consciousness, as\nwell as by objects (and relationships with these objects) that these images lead me to consume, my past is\nless and less differentiated from that of other people. It loses, therefore, its singularity, which is as much\nas to say, I lose myself as singularity.\nStiegler's image of an increasingly undifferentiated and homogenized collective past brings to\nmind relatively easily the scrolling timelines, sponsored content and accumulating databases of\ncontemporary social media platforms.\nThe colonization of tertiary or prosthetic memory by economic or industrial forces is crucial to\nStiegler precisely because of its growing influence on the forms of internalized perception (what\nhe calls primary retentions) and memory (secondary retentions) that enable the formation of indi-\nvidual and collective identity. Stiegler describes a kind of retentional chain reaction, in which the\nincreasingly dominant presence of industrialized tertiary retentions (now almost exclusively taking\nthe form of online digital media) begins to condition our individual and collective forms of second-\nary retention, our individual and cultural memory. Our secondary retentions affect in turn the pro-\ncess of primary retention, for Stiegler (2013: 85) explains that `primary retention is a primary\nselection, and the criteria for this selection are furnished by secondary retention' (emphasis in\noriginal). In other words, the replacement of `collective imaginaries and individual stories'\n(Stiegler, 2011: 58) with the forms of homogenized memory we find on the commercial internet or\nbroadcast media, impacts not only the constitution of our individual memory, but also, in turn, our\nprocess of perception and selection; it patterns what we choose to pay attention to \u00ad what we care\nfor and what we care about. As Stiegler (2013: 87) suggests, `attention is conditioned by these\nretentional systems' (emphasis in original).\nThe expanded influence of industrialized tertiary retentions has profound implications, Stiegler\nargues, for our ability to constitute a sense of self, but also for our capacity to envision a collective\nfuture. Stiegler makes frequent use of Gilbert Simondon's concept of `individuation'in his attempts\nto describe the correlated process of individual and group becoming \u00ad what Simondon refers to as\n`psychic' and `collective' individuation. For both Stiegler and Simondon, individuals constitutes\nthemselves in relation to a group through the inheritance of a pre-individual reality or history. In\nStiegler's terms:\nThe I, as psychic individual, cannot be thought except to the extent that it belongs to a we, which is a\ncollective individual: the I constitutes itself through the adoption of a collective history, which it inherits\nand with which a plurality of Is identify. (Stiegler, 2014: 50, emphases in original)\nIndividuation is, therefore, a rather complex dynamic of subject formation in which the individual, in\nthe process of self-constitution, draws from a collective reservoir of memory and potential. Stiegler\ntranslator Johann Rossouw (2011: 53) encapsulates this process neatly when he writes that:\nThe pre-individual fund is that collective of knowledge, experience, and tradition that a group has\naccumulated over time, and it has to be continually reactivated through its simultaneous transmission from\none generation to another ... and through the singular way in which each receiver of the fund adopts it.\nTertiary retentions are crucial for Stiegler because it is these exteriorized memory systems that\nprovide access to the reservoir of collective experience upon which individuation depends. He\nexplains, `Tertiary retentions ... undergird every collective and psychic individuation's access to\npre-individual funds'(Stiegler, 2011: 57). As tertiary retentions become increasingly industrialized\n(and shared collective memory becomes commercialized and homogeneous), the very process of\nindividuation falls under threat. The break-down of the process of individuation, cutting off the\npre-individual fund, leads to an inability to constitute the self, but it also threatens the ability to\nimagine a collective future. As Stiegler (2009b: 53) suggests, `technicity, being constitutive and, in\nparticular, constituting the condition of access to the past as preindividuality is what opens up tem-\nporality as such, the capacity for projecting the future.' Or as Hansen (2015: 208) elaborates:\nFor Stiegler, there can be no viable future because this industrially manufactured source has literally taken\nthe place of `natural' or `lived' secondary memories, and thus of collective cultural traditions that could\nfurnish a living source for the invention of viable futures.\nStiegler's media theory represents a non-phenomenological or post-phenomenological turn in\nthe sense that he believes we are increasingly estranged from the repository of memory images and\nobjects available for us to draw from in order to constitute our sense of self. This claim may at first\nappear paradoxical within a contemporary digital media age in which we are encouraged to actively\nand persistently contribute to the development of this reservoir of cultural memory (by document-\ning, uploading and re-circulating our experiences and the experience of others), yet the protocols,\nconventions and prompts provided by these networks are not of our own making. Stiegler's (2014:\n3) claim is that a process of `aesthetic conditioning ... has replaced aesthetic experience'(emphasis\nin original), we circulate and reproduce symbols and memories, that are in fundamental ways not\nour own \u00ad we adopt aesthetic formats and content expectations encouraged by the platforms them-\nselves and we relinquish ownership of the content we do produce, offering it up for the purpose of\nuser profiling and algorithmic analysis. It is also worth bearing in mind the challenges raised to the\ncommon claim that digital media in the Web 2.0 era has fostered new forms of participatory culture\nand transformed consumers into producers. Lev Manovich (2009: 320), for example, reveals that\naccording to 2007 statistics, `only between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent of users of the most popular\nsocial media sites (Flickr, YouTube, Wikipedia) contributed their own content.'And Henry Jenkins\net al. (2013: 15) note that our contemporary digital media platforms, such as YouTube, facilitate\n`user-circulated content' far more than they encourage `user-generated content'. We might there-\nfore claim that the online fund of memory is becoming increasingly homogenized through both the\nconditioning or standardization of user-generated material and the perpetual re-circulation of a\nrelatively small (and increasingly commercial, rather than amateur) pool of available content.\nIn his recent book Feed-Forward: On the Future of Twenty-First-Century Media (2015), Mark\nHansen makes an even more explicit connection between our increasingly post-experiential digital\nmedia and the resultant foreclosure of the future. Here, Hansen considers the shift towards the\natmospheric and encompassing media environments produced by computational networks, data-\nmining technologies and embedded micro-sensors. Hansen claims to distinguish himself from\nStiegler by suggesting that, rather than recording and playing back past human experiences, 21st-\ncentury media now involve the storage of bits of data that `register molecular increments of behav-\nior' (p. 40) oriented towards anticipating and patterning future activity. Hansen's concern is the\nexpanding number of data-harvesting media technologies, from social media platforms to wearable\nbio-tech, that allow for the accumulation of aggregated information on a demographic scale, rather\nthan personal or durational lived experiences.Amouse click is captured online, a biometric reading\nis registered on a smart watch, a geolocation is imprinted through a mobile phone, and the aggrega-\ntion and classification of all these data points are used to identify a previously unperceived ten-\ndency. The situation Hansen delineates is post-experiential in the sense that we have no direct\naccess to the digital processes of data analysis and pattern recognition involved. He explains:\nThe digital computer ... interrupts the circuits linking media and experience ... computational processes\noccur at time frames well below the thresholds constitutive of human perceptual experience, they seem\nto introduce levels of operationality that impact our experience without yielding any perceptual correlate.\nMany of the operations undertaken by digital technologies, in other words, take place autono-\nmously (algorithmically, or machine to machine) with no direct human involvement or act of\nperception.\nNot unlike Stiegler, Hansen is concerned with the ways in which contemporary digital media\nnetworks produce a kind of conditioning field for human experience, one that has pre-determining\neffects on cognition and behaviour. These increasingly enveloping digital media environments are\ndescribed variously by Hansen as a `sensory confound' (p. 69), an `atmospheric' media system' (p.\n132) and a `peripheral `calculative ambience' (p. 186). But while Stiegler emphasizes the condi-\ntioning effects of industrialized tertiary retentions, Hansen outlines an even more intimate intru-\nsion into processes of self-actualization and individuation. He writes:\nIt is precisely because today's data and culture industries can bypass consciousness and go directly to\nbehavioral, biometric, and environmental data that they are increasingly able to capture our `attention'\nwithout any awareness on our part: precisely because it places conscious deliberation and response out of\nplay, microtemporal behavioral data that evades the oversight of consciousness allows today's data and\nculture industries to accomplish their goal of tightening the circuit between solicitation and response. (p. 58)\nThrough the accumulation and analysis of micro-behaviours, 21st-century media acquire knowl-\nedge about us and our world that is beyond, or rather prior to, our own sensory and conscious\nawareness. And it is the operationalizing of this knowledge, by the large data companies who pos-\nsess it, that threatens to instrumentally shape or modulate future experience. It must be said that\nStiegler's current writings have actually brought him into much closer alignment with the depic-\ntion of computational 21st-century media presented by Hansen in Feed-Forward. For example,\nnotions of algorithmic governance, automation and data profiling are central to the political analy-\nsis of Stiegler's recent Automatic Society, Vol. 1: The Future of Work (2016), complicating Hansen's\nclaim that the philosopher is primarily concerned with durational or experiential media.\nHansen's response to this data-empowered colonization of future experience is ultimately not to\nreject the digital technologies that enable its occurrence. Inspired by the philosophy of Alfred\nNorth Whitehead, he sees in 21st-century media the possibility of an expanded form of `word sen-\nsibility', one that compels us to rethink the human as an inseparable part of a much larger environ-\nment. The forms of non-perceptual experience made available by contemporary digital media hold\na surplus of potential and openness that is far from exhausted by the instrumental uses of the con-\ntemporary data and culture industries. The crucial question for Hansen (2015) is how we might\ngain access to and control over this micro-temporal domain of experience. He thus maintains:\nWe must ... embrace the technically accessible precognitive dimension of sensibility as the very ground\non which to politicize media, to modulate our own becoming by intervening in how media shape sensibility,\nand to grasp the techno-sensible complexity involved in ... shaping our own future experience. (p. 133)\nThe task of re-establishing the open-endedness of the future is, for Hansen, dependent on our abil-\nity to redirect the surplus potential of this new non- or pre-sensory data sphere. Representational\nmedia oriented directly towards the human senses and lived experience appear increasingly irrel-\nevant, obsolete or ineffectual within Hansen's depiction. Forms of media operating within the\npresent time frame of human perception are, for him, already too late to meaningfully affect the\nfuture.\nThe continued relevance of animation\nThe relationships between digital media, collective memory and futurity articulated by Stiegler and\nHansen are extremely relevant for considerations of contemporary urbanism and architecture, yet\nI think we should hesitate to accept too quickly their tendency to dismiss representational media\n(animation included) as either entirely industrialized or increasingly irrelevant due to the domi-\nnance of non-perceptual forms of computation.2 It is certainly becoming clear that the built envi-\nronment, despite its fundamental materiality, is a space that is far from immune from the effects of\nthe media changes described by the two philosophers. In fact, the ways in which urban develop-\nment has been absorbed into global networks of digital computation is largely illustrative of the\nprocesses outlined in their thought. For one, physical urban space has become so permeated by\nmicro-sensors, smart grids and ubiquitous computing that the city itself can now be viewed as an\nextended data gathering system. Urban theorists such as Benjamin Bratton and Jennifer Gabrys\nhave gone so far as to consider the city as one node within a larger structure of `planetary scale\ncomputation'(see Bratton's The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty, 2015, and Gabrys's Program\nEarth: Environmental Sensing Technology and the Making of a Computational Planet, 2016). Who\ncontrols the data generated by cities and how effectively inhabitants are able to access the informa-\ntion they are collectively producing in order to influence urban decision making remain central\nissues within current discussions of `data citizenship'and `algorithmic governance'(see, for exam-\nThe ability of urban communities to draw from their reservoirs of collective memory in order to\nformulate an effective vision of the future has also been significantly disrupted by the current struc-\ntures of investment and real estate financing. The capacity to intervene in the production of urban\nspace has appeared increasingly cut off to the general population as long-term development plans\ndictate city transformation well into the future. This process of constructing urban infrastructure or\nsettlement for projective political or economic aims, rather than for the actual demands of an exist-\ning population, has been labelled `speculative urbanism' or `speculative urbanization' by urban\nscholars and planners such as Christopher Marcinkoski and Michael Goldman. Marcinkoski (2015:\n16) highlights the ways that `new financial tools \u00ad increasingly complex transactional instruments'\nallow local real estate to be transformed into an investable global commodity. The continued exist-\nence of urban communities thus becomes increasingly subject to the algorithmic calculations and\nautomated risk assessments of global financial markets. Without access to this financial data and\nthese analytical tools, city inhabitants often find themselves attempting to influence urban deci-\nsions that have long since been determined. Hansen's notion of a future horizon pre-established by\nthe accumulation and processing of unavailable data takes on a very real form in the example of\nspeculative urbanism, as does Stiegler's image of individuals alienated from their own resources of\ncultural memory. As Goldman (2011: 557) describes in reference to projective urbanism in the\ndeveloping world, `the anxieties of high-rolling speculation not only affect people's ability to hold\nonto their living spaces, but also their jobs, identities and communities.'Stiegler (2013: 82) himself\nacknowledges the damaging impact of technologically-enabled forms of speculation when he\nwarns, `speculators are typically people who pay little attention to the objects of their speculation\n\u00ad and who, moreover, take little care of them.'\nYet, despite the growing impact of data-oriented forms of urban computation, representational\nmedia (and animation, in particular) continue to play a significant role in the future development\nof our cities. In fact, the ways in which data-driven speculation and digital representations of pro-\nposed projects work in conjunction to shape urban futures warrants considerably more critical\nattention. The use of animated digital renderings within the marketing of speculative developments\npresents an architectural version of the CGI-fuelled `cinemas of transactions' described by Leon\nGurevitch (2010: 369), in which spectacular computer graphics become a value-generating cur-\nrency independent of their specific representation content. As Degen et al. (2017: 2) reveal in their\nstudy of the role of digital visualization within a large-scale redevelopment project in Doha, Qatar,\n`computer-generated images (CGIs) have now become the most common type of image media\nused to visualise and market future urban redevelopment' (emphasis in original). The production\nand circulation of increasingly sophisticated renderings of proposed developments is the final step\nin the temporal loop of urban speculation \u00ad financial opportunities are identified through market\ncalculations, sections of the city are earmarked for investment and demographic change, then\nphoto-realistic representations of these developments are produced that signal the apparent inevi-\ntability of this process before it has even begun. The expanding gap between the visualizations\nproduced by developers and the needs of local communities is highlighted by designer Tobias\nRevell's (2016) claim that, `very few renders evoke hope and aspiration at street level because they\nare harbingers of someone else's ideal of your built future.' Promotional renderings also often\nattempt to suture development projects to the cultural memory of their locations. Take, for exam-\nple, the hybrid animation marketing The Stage, Shoreditch EC2, a luxury housing complex in East\nLondon. The video, involving a combination of live acting, real locations, animated characters and\narchitectural renderings, presents the development (where one-bedroom flats start at \u00a3800,000) as\na natural addition to the creative vibrancy of the area and as a cultural custodian of the remains of\nShakespeare's Curtain Theatre, on which the complex is built. The widespread circulation and\nparticular aesthetic of these animated promotional videos have produced forms of parody and\nresistance by artists such as Hito Steyerl, in her 2013 work How Not to be Seen. A Fucking Didactic\nEducational .MOV File, and Lawrence Lek, in his Unreal Estate (the Royal Academy is Yours), a\n2015 `speculative simulation' (to use the artist's own term).\nThe way in which computational data and animated renderings interact within the processes of\nurban speculation is more typical of our current media landscape than perhaps Stiegler and Hansen\nwould care to concede. Rather than claim that representational or sensory media is becoming less\nrelevant in a computational age, perhaps we should acknowledge instead that our contemporary\nmedia is increasingly constituted by mediations of media itself. Or, in other words, there is an\nincreasingly preponderance of media that translates digital information into a humanly perceptible\nform. Seen from this perspective, the relevance of digital animation, comprised of everything from\ndata visualizations to computer generated images, has actually expanded in our post-phenomeno-\nlogical or post-experiential computational environments. While Hansen is quite right to alert us to\nthe growth of machine to machine communications and the computational harnessing of pre-cog-\nnitive affects and tendencies, animation may still remain as a kind of representational last stand and\na viable form of resistance in relation to dehumanizing forms of digital calculation. It is perhaps\nnot surprising then that so many contemporary architects and artists concerned with urban and geo-\npolitical topics are turning to digital animation as a tool for both representation and intervention.\nAnimation, for these artists and designers, presents the possibility of reengaging with temporal\nframes outside the limited context of the present and restoring some of the lost potentiality of both\nthe past and the future. In the remaining section of this article, I will briefly highlight four examples\nof artists and architects using digital animation as a means of contending with the temporal and\npolitical complexities of the urban. The first two, Stan Douglas and Forensic Architecture, are\noriented towards the past and cultural memory, while the latter two, Larissa Sansour and Liam\nYoung, are oriented towards the future.\nDigital animation as urban and temporal intervention\nCanadian conceptual artist Stan Douglas is not generally associated with digital animation or com-\nputer generated imaging (being more frequently recognized for his film, video and photography\nwork), but his recent adoption of these technologies is indicative of their expanded use within criti-\ncal art practice. In a constellation of related works set in his native Vancouver, Douglas has made\nuse of computer generated images to explore a relatively unacknowledged period of the city's his-\ntory. Digitally rendered images of 1940s Vancouver appear as backdrops within the 2014 stage\nplay Helen Lawrence; as standalone printed works, such as The Second Hotel Vancouver (2014)\nand Bumtown (2015) (see Figure 1); and in animated form in the interactive installation and app\nCirca 1948, produced in collaboration with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) Digital\nStudio in 2014. The primary locations recreated by Douglas are the Hotel Vancouver (the second\nof three incarnations of the hotel, this iteration constructed in the Italianate revival style by the\nCanadian Pacific Railway in 1916) and Hogan's Alley, the unofficial name of Park Lane, a ram-\nshackle alley running through the neighbourhood of Strathcona. The Hotel Vancouver recreated by\nDouglas is a once grand, but now crumbling, railway hotel; having closed at the end of the great\ndepression in 1939, the hotel had been taken over by homeless WWII veterans in the immediate\npost-war period before eventually being razed in 1949 (see Figure 2). The now demolished Hogan's\nAlley area, located near the city's train stations, was an ethnically mixed neighbourhood and a\npost-war red-light district known for its illegal drinking and music establishments, brothels and\nFigure 1. Hogan's Alley, 2014. \u00a9 Stan Douglas. Courtesy of the Artist, David Zwirner, New York/London\nand Victoria Miro, London.\ngambling dens. It is described within the Circa 1948 app as a place where `immigrant workers,\ndrifters, and dreamers rub elbows with politicians and cops on the take'.\nDouglas's digital reconstructions visualize a forgotten moment of Vancouver's somewhat\nseamy past that stands in sharp contrast to the city's current image as an affluent Western metrop-\nolis of gleaming condo towers. The 1940s are significant for Douglas in that they represent an\nuncertain and less often recalled interim period between the war era and `the sudden call to order\nand morality' of the 1950s (Farago, 2014). The process of regenerating this past moment (the\nphysical history of which has largely been erased from the urban environment) involves the\nanimation of visual and written archival materials. The digital prints Douglas has produced of\nthese locations are remarkably detailed and it is actually their slightly uncanny hyper-realism\nthat gives away their status as renders. They are constructed through the digitization and selec-\ntive overlay of multiple historical photographs. Curator and gallery director Fiona Bradley\n(2014: 13) describes the complex reconstruction process involving the use of `a computer pro-\ngramme to apply photographic images (textures) to three-dimensional geometry (meshes)'. The\nCirca 1948 app, employing a first-person point of view common to video games, allows users to\nnavigate through the two locations, eavesdropping on conversations that form a disjointed nar-\nrative of political corruption and shady development plans.3 As Douglas suggests, `We get a\nsense of the various real estate scams that are going on in this post-war period, and a lot about\nthe reorganization of urban space ' (Glassman, 2016). In 1948, Hogan's Alley and its surround-\ning streets constituted one of the most diverse areas of the city and home to the largest black\ncommunity in Vancouver at the time. This area of Strathcona has a long history of resisting the\nthreat of demolition that came with each urban renewal project, Hogan's Alley itself being even-\ntually razed in the 1970s in preparation for the construction of the Georgia Viaduct overpass\n(originally planned as part of an extensive freeway system).\nDouglas uses digital animation and rendering techniques to recover an otherwise lost period of\nVancouver's urban past, one that significantly disrupts the commonly promoted historical narrative\nand trajectory of the city. Revisiting this period of post-war transition is particularly relevant at a\nmoment when the city is considered to have reached a point of crisis due to real estate speculation,\nprocesses of gentrification and soaring housing prices (Kassam, 2016). Douglas's re-animation of\na past moment of urban uncertainty and political unrest expands the available reservoir of cultural\nmemory associated with the city. Digital animation is, in this case, a tool for resisting, rather than\npromoting, the unquestioned acceptance of a version of urban progress fuelled by unfettered real\nestate markets and non-transparent municipal development projects. Employing Stiegler's termi-\nnology, we might say that Douglas re-establishes a connection with Vancouver's complicated past\nin a manner that enables different processes of collective individuation and thus makes possible\nnew responses to the present moment of urban crisis. And indeed, Douglas's artwork has formed\npart of the recently reconstituted memory of largely forgotten elements of the city's history, includ-\nThe members of the ForensicArchitecture research agency, established in 2011 at Goldsmiths's\nCentre for Research Architecture and led by Eyal Weizman, have been developing new methods\nof spatial analysis and visualization with very explicit political applications. Weizman (2014: 9)\ndescribes the group's mandate in terms of an attempt `to bring new material and aesthetic sensi-\nbilities to bear upon the legal and political implications of state violence, armed conflict, and\nclimate change'. The projects completed by the collective of designers, architects and lawyers\nthat make up Forensic Architecture are varied and are often undertaken in collaboration with\nNGOs, international institutions and political organizations, such as the UN, Human Rights\nWatch and Amnesty International. While developing new approaches to the collection of evi-\ndence in relation to human rights violations and state crimes (with the material `testimony' of\narchitecture placed at the centre of that forensic investigation), the agency is also producing\ninnovative ways of representing that evidence involving a variety of advanced imaging tech-\nnologies, including 3D animation.\nThe agency's investigations have included the use of 3D laser scanning and Ground Penetrating\nRadar (GPR) to gather evidence of two former concentration camps (Staro Sajmiste and Omarska)\nin operation during the Yugoslav war; visualizations of the effects of white phosphorus munitions\nused during the December 2008 to January 2009 Israeli attacks on Gaza; and the use of computer\nmodelling (based on the testimony of a surviving witness) to digitally reconstruct a home in Mir\nAli, Pakistan, destroyed in 2010 during a US drone strike that killed five people (see Figure 3). One\nof the most recent Forensic Architecture investigations makes particularly pronounced use of ani-\nmation techniques in its presentation of evidence. The Rafah: Black Friday investigation, under-\ntaken in collaboration with Amnesty International, documents the war operations that took place\nbetween 1 and 4 August 2014 in the city of Rafah in Gaza. These four days would become one of\nthe deadliest episodes of the war after the Israeli army, in response to the capture of an Israeli sol-\ndier by Hamas fighters, appear to have implemented `the Hannibal Directive', a controversial mili-\ntary command described by Amnesty International as one `designed to deal with captures of\nsoldiers by unleashing massive firepower on persons, vehicles and buildings in the vicinity of the\nattack, despite the risk to civilians and the captured soldier(s)' (Amnesty International, 2015).\nAlthough banned from travelling to Gaza, the Forensic Architecture investigation reconstructed\nthe events of those four days through the analysis of hundreds of images and videos, taken by wit-\nnesses, professional and citizen-journalists, made available largely through social media platforms.\nUsing a complex array of techniques, including geo-synching, image compositing, metadata analy-\nsis and correction, visual smoke plume and shadow studies and remote sensing analysis from satel-\nlite images, the Forensic Architecture group were able to piece together a detailed account of the\nextent of the bombing and damage occurring in four days of attacks that resulted in between 135\nand 200 civilian deaths. These various elements of visual evidence are integrated into a computer\ngenerated 3D model of the city, indicating their relative location and time of occurrence. This com-\nplicated process of spatial and temporal mapping is made intelligible to viewers through the pro-\nduction of a sophisticated digital animation that visualizes these investigative steps, bringing\ntogether a multiplicity of data types (see Figure 4). The objective of the project is to provide\nFigure 3. Drone Strikes. Courtesy of Forensic Architecture.\nevidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks of the Israeli forces and to urge an\nindependent investigation into clear violations of international humanitarian law.\nIn the work of the Forensic Architecture group, digital animation becomes a crucial method of\nvisualizing the conflicts and violence of the recent past in a manner that makes these images opera-\ntional within specific forums for political and legal action, such as international human rights tri-\nbunals. The group's methods of data collection and analysis seem to be an important example of\nthe expanded world sensibility identified by Hansen, this time directed towards a progressive goal.\nHere the repository of micro-temporalities and affects accumulated within social media become\npotentialized towards an end that could never have been predicted by the owners of these plat-\nforms. Weizman (2014: 12) describes how `new visibilities have emerged with the development\nand widespread accessibility of digital data derived from activist imagery and their accelerated\ndissemination via mobile phone, cloud, and social networks.' The work of the group is an impor-\ntant reminder of the political possibilities of these technologies outside the context of their Western\ncommercial origins. Weizman is acutely aware of the change in sensory awareness represented by\nthe `forensic sensibility' his research agency advocates and speaks of this shift in ways that are\nquite synchronized with Hansen's own terminology. He describes bypassing `human testimony'(p.\n10) and the sometimes fallible narration of lived experience and memory in favour of the material\nevidence that manifests itself `well below the threshold of unenhanced visual perception' (p. 14).\nIn this forensic context, architecture operates like a sensor, according to Weizman, recording oth-\nerwise undetectable events and occurrences. But Weizman is also attuned to the ways in which\nthese forms of technology enhanced imaging, combined with the accumulation of digital data cir-\nculating through social networks require new techniques of representation and mediation in order\nto be legible within specific political and legal contexts. He writes, `these images also call for new\npractices of trawling through, looking at, and looking again, interpreting, verifying, decoding and\namplifying messages and broadcasting them further' (p. 12). Expanded modes of sensory aware-\nness and information processing must also be translated into perceptible and actionable forms, and\ndigital animation is an important vehicle for this translation.\nFigure 4. Rafah: Black Friday. Courtesy of Forensic Architecture.\nThe work of Palestinian artist Larissa Sansour concerns a similar geographic and political terri-\ntory, but employs a considerably different aesthetic approach. Making use of digital animation\ntechniques and the genre of science fiction, both of which are more commonly associated with\nWestern popular culture, Sansour envisions future scenarios in which the current political condi-\ntions of the Palestinian people are taken to their dystopian logical conclusions. In her 2012 work\nentitled Nation Estate, Sansour combines computer generated images with live acting (the artist\nherself taking the central role), to depict an architectural resolution to the deadlock of the Israeli/\nPalestinian peace process. The film introduces the viewer to a high-rise complex in which the\nentire nation of Palestine is now housed, each floor containing the remains of a former city\n(Jerusalem on floor 13, Ramallah on 14 ...). In a conversation with the curator Nat Muller (2016),\nSansour explains the irony of the scenario \u00ad the Palestinians are comfortable in the self-contained\nstructure (there are no check points here), yet they are imprisoned. The protagonist exits the lift at\nthe Bethlehem floor and proceeds to her living quarters, where she tends to an olive tree growing\nout of the pristine white floor of the apartment and looks out over the security wall that separates\nthe building from the surrounding landscape (see Figure 5). The short film turns the aesthetic\ntropes of the glossy render-based animations promoting global real estate developments towards an\neven more disturbing speculative scenario.\nIn her 2015 film In the Future They Ate from the Finest Porcelain, Sansour and her co-creator\nS\u00f8ren Lind introduce another temporally complex scenario, again employing live motion and com-\nputer generated images. In the film's sci-fi storyline, a resistance group deposits elaborate china in\na desert landscape in anticipation of it eventually being unearthed, thereby proving the existence of\nan ancient civilization and supporting the group's future claims to the territory (see Figure 6). This\naction is referred to in the film as `narrative terrorism', the establishment of a fictional founding\nmyth that has immediate implications for nationhood and land rights. The film's narrator suggests\nthe political nature of excavated history, stating, `In its most perverted form, archaeology galvanizes\npublic sentiment, confirms myths of the past and defends them against scrutiny.' The allegorical\nreference is not difficult to detect, the struggle for control of heritage sites within the ever shrinking\noccupied Palestinian territories has turned archaeology into a weapon of politics within the Middle\nEast, with UNESCO sometimes placed in the position of reluctant arbiter (Gilbert, 2013). While the\nForensic Architecture group produces alternative forms of material evidence, Sansour uses specula-\ntive fiction as another means to complicate state-sponsored historical narratives. Digital animation\npermission.\nallows the artist to engage in an indirect, yet provocative investigation of the current politics of the\nregion and thus to re-open the question of the future of Palestine.\nThe final example I wish to highlight, the self-described `speculative architect' Liam Young,\nalso draws frequently from science fiction tropes and aesthetics in his future-oriented design prac-\ntice. Through his numerous creative projects, Young attempts to restore the forward thinking and\nexperimental vision once embodied within the discipline by figures such as Cedric Price and the\nmembers of Archigram. In a `think tank' conversation connected with his 2012 Under Tomorrows\nSky project, he explains:\nIt's the impulse to imagine and speculate that those failed futures had at their core which is exciting, which\nis what we're trying to revitalize and trying to look back on. Because no one's done it with the same kind\nof force as they did for a while. No one's launched a future vision with such traction, that's really captured\nYoung therefore takes on the task of wrestling considerations of the future back from the narrow\nrange of social actors and organizations that have delimited this field of vision. In doing so, he\noften makes use of advanced imaging technologies typically restricted to such large-scale opera-\ntions as military departments or resource extraction industries \u00ad a visual strategy that is in many\nways shared with Forensic Architecture, but is applied to quite different ends in Young's work.\nAmongst his recently completed projects are a film shot entirely with 3D laser scanners, entitled\nWhere the City Can't See (a sci-fi narrative set in the Chinese-owned Detroit Economic Zone) and\nanother, entitled In the Robot Skies, shot with autonomous pre-programmed drones.\nAnimation is again a frequently used visual resource for Young's speculative projects. The pre-\nviously mentioned Under Tomorrows Sky project brought together a varied group of thinkers,\nincluding the sci-fi writer Bruce Sterling, the graphic novelist Warren Ellis and the scientist Rachel\nArmstrong, to discuss the possible technological and biological development of a fictional future\ncity. A room-sized movie miniature model of the city was established in Eindhoven, a platform for\nmaterializing some of the ideas proposed through the think tank. Animators and illustrators were\ncommissioned to visualize specific regions or sectors of the city. In his description of the project,\nYoung emphasizes the non-dystopian perspective of the initiative, suggesting that in the current\nmoment establishing a hopeful vision of the urban future is a much more unusual and challenging\nReproduced with permission.\ntask. He promises, `Under Tomorrows Sky imagines a post-capitalist urbanity full of optimism and\njoy, full of life and aspiration.'\nIn other completed animated works, Young is not always so reluctant to employ a dystopian\nregister. In his `New City' series of digitally animated skylines, the architect presents exaggerated\nversions of current technological and urban tendencies that are difficult to characterize as aspira-\ntional. Keeping Up Appearance (2014), for example, presents a homogeneous cityscape of high\nrises, in which Samsung holds a complete technological monopoly (from smart phones to air con-\nditioners to city signage). Edgelands (2014) depicts a kind of data shantytown on the outskirts of a\ncity centre in which scraps of personal information are salvaged for any remaining value (see\nFigure 7). These animated snippets of a possible urbanism to come are one part thought experiment\nand one part critical warning. An oscillation between fascination and dismay in relation to our\npotential urban future is common within Young's work. It surfaces as well within his Unknown\nFields Division project, a design research studio involving expeditions to remote locations that\nYoung leads in conjunction with artist and architect Kate Davies. In their `Tales from the Dark Side\nof the City' exhibition mounted at the Architecture Association in the winter of 2016\u00ad2017, the\nstudio explores the multiple, often unseen geographies that resource our contemporary urban and\nmedia ecologies. The group documents the Bolivian salt flats of Salar De Uyuni where lithium is\nextracted for use in battery production, the Alaskan outposts where environmental scientists pro-\nduce data for climate simulations and the black market mining towns of Madagascar that supply\nprecious gems for the various products of luxury brands. Animation is used as a tool for both\nspeculative exploration and information delivery within the exhibition. Animated and poetic\n`dramatizations' of climate change data are presented, for example, as an alternative to ineffective\ntraditional forms of information visualization. Logistical data pertaining to the various resource\nextraction sites explored by the studio are overlaid onto film footage of the workers involved in\nthese often dangerous and unregulated industries, a technique that simultaneously presents the\nsingular experience of individual participants and the statistical impact of their combined activi-\nties. Young's most recent animated works include Renderlands (2017), a love story between an\nIndian render farm worker and his digital model, taking place in the `scavenged VFX movie mod-\nels and 3D game assets that remain on studio hard drives \u00ad the remnants of cancelled production\njobs` (Young, 2017)4 (see Figure 8), and Tomorrow's Storeys (2017), a visualization of a near future\nAthens, inspired by a public think tank of science fiction authors, visual artists, photographers and\narchitects (and thus bringing him full circle back to the critical fiction methodologies of the Under\nTomorrows Sky project) (see Figure 9).\nFigure 7.

Reproduced with permission.\nThe use of digital animation by Young in these and other projects can again be viewed as a man-\nner of answering Hansen's call for an expanded form of world sensibility. The visualization prac-\ntices that Young employs are a means of integrating the complex geo-political and economic\ninformation underpinning our contemporary technical and urban environments in ways that make\nthis accumulated data capable of being processed by the viewer. The forms of animated speculation\nthat Young develops both illuminate elements of our contemporary media ecologies to which we\nare largely unaware and encourage us to reengage in the activity of imagining the future develop-\nment of our urban condition.\nThis article has attempted to highlight the ways that architects and artists are employing digital\nanimation to move beyond the temporal constraints of the present and productively engage with\nurban pasts and futures. The media philosophies developed by Stiegler and Hansen provide an\nimportant framework for considering the non-experiential nature of contemporary digital media\nand the implications this has for our ability to access shared cultural memory and envision possible\nFigure 8.

While drawing insights from both of these thinkers, I have also tried to counter-\nact what I see as a tendency in their work to downplay the continued relevance of representational\nor experiential media forms in the current digital age. With its continued expansion into new\ndomains of life and politics, and the privileged role it plays in the visualization of computational\ndata, the contemporary importance of digital animation is arguably growing rather than diminish-\ning. This certainly appears to be true in relation to media engagements with urban politics, as I\nhope is made clear by the four examples of art and architectural practice highlighted in this article.\nWhile Stan Douglas and Forensic Architecture utilize digital animation to examine past atrocities\nand restore forgotten elements of urban history, Larissa Sansour and Liam Young employ similar\nvisual technologies to recover the speculative dimension of the future from the current monopolies\nof access. All these artists and architects resist the inaccessibility of the digital encouraged by\nindustrialized contemporary technologies and platforms, attempting instead to realize the potential\nof these media forms to help overcome our current temporal constraints.\n"
