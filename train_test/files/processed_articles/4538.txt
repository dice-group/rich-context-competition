    "abstract": "Abstract\nAn impressive number of researchers have devoted a great amount of effort toward examining various predictors of\ncriminal justice (CJ) processing outcomes. Indeed, a vast amount of research has examined various individual- and aggregate-\nlevel predictors of arrests, incarceration, and sentencing decisions. To this point, less attention has been devoted toward\nuncovering the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on variation in risk for CJ processing. As a result,\nthe current study employs a behavioral genetic design to help fill this void in the existing literature. Using twin data from\na national sample of youth, the current study produced evidence suggesting that genetic factors accounted for at least a\nportion of variance in risk for incarceration among female twins and probation among male twins. Shared and nonshared\nenvironmental influences accounted for the variance in risk for arrest among both female and male twins, probation among\nfemale twins, and incarceration among male twins. Ultimately, it appears that risk for contact with the CJ system and CJ\nprocessing is structured by a combination of factors beyond shared cultural and neighborhood environments, and appears to\nalso include genetic factors. Moving forward, continuing to not use genetically sensitive research designs capable of estimating\nthe role of genetic and nonshared environmental influences on CJ outcomes may result in misleading results.\n",

To be sure, a wealth of research has exam-\nined factors thought to increase the likelihood of arrest and\nformal processing and little debate exists concerning at least\none fact: Contact with the CJ system is not a random occur-\nrence (Sampson & Lauritsen, 1997). Indeed, demographic\nfactors including race (Sampson & Lauritsen, 1997; Walsh,\n2002), as well as personality traits and developmental pro-\nrelate with varying levels of risk for arrest, incarceration, and\nformal sentencing. What is noticeably lacking, however, is an\neffort to examine the role of genetic factors in predicting con-\nThe evidence implicating genetic factors as source of\nvariance for antisocial and criminal behavior in general is\n& Carey, 1997; Plomin, DeFries, Knopik, & Neiderhiser,\nresearchers in criminology, however, have labored under the\nassumption that genetic factors play only a minimal part in\npredicting who in the population will be arrested, incarcer-\nated, and formally sentenced (Cullen, 2011). This approach\nmay ultimately prove shortsighted given the wide array of\nhuman outcomes influenced by genetic factors (Chabris\ncurrent study, thus, is intended to be a step toward uncover-\ning sources of variation--both environmental and genetic--\nfor CJ processing. First, however, it is important to discuss\nprior research pertaining to the heritability of antisocial,\naggressive, and criminal behaviors.\nThe Heritability of Antisocial Behavior\nEvidence concerning the heritability of human behavior can\nbe traced largely to work in the field of behavior genetics\n(Plomin et al., 2013). The science of behavior genetics is\ndevoted to examining the origin of individual differences\n(Turkheimer, 2000). Put differently, behavioral genetic\nresearch utilizes sibling pairs of varying degrees of genetic\nrelatedness (i.e., monozygotic [MZ] twins, dizygotic [DZ]\ntwins, full siblings, and half siblings) to uncover sources of\nvariation for physiological, pathological, psychopathological,\n1Saint Louis University, MO, USA\n2Sam Houston State University, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBrian B.

Because MZ\ntwins share, on average, twice as much genetic material as DZ\ntwins, it is assumed that if MZ twins resemble one another\nmore closely than DZ twins for a certain trait, then genetic\nfactors may be contributing to variation in that particular out-\ncome (Plomin et al., 2013). If the similarity of DZ twins and\nfull siblings, which share on average 50% of their genetic\nmaterial, is greater than that of half siblings, which share 25%\nof their genetic material, moreover, the conclusion regarding\ngenetic influences is further underscored (Plomin et al.,\nPut more directly, behavioral genetic research divides\ntrait variance into that which is the result of heritability (h2),\nthat which is the result of the shared environment (c2), and\nthat which is due to the nonshared environment (e2) (Plomin\net al., 2013). Prior researchers have discussed these concepts\nin great detail so they will not be belabored here (for a thor-\nough methodological treatment of various concepts and\nassumptions of twin models, see Barnes et al., 2014). For\ndefinitional purposes, however, heritability refers to the pro-\nportion of variance in a given trait due to variation at the\ngenetic level (Plomin et al., 2013). The shared environment\nrepresents environmental influences that serve to increase\nthe resemblance of twins or siblings on the outcome measure\nunder investigation. Nonshared environments represent the\nunique experiences of twins or siblings that function to cre-\nate differences on the outcome measure under investigation\nbetween children in the same family. Taken together, h2, c2,\nand e2 will always sum to yield 100% of the variance in a\ngiven outcome measure (Plomin et al., 2013).\nThe application of behavior genetic techniques is com-\nmon in a range of disciplines outside of criminology (Rhee &\nWaldman, 2002). Behavior genetic methodologies, however,\nhave recently gained some traction in the study of crime and\ndelinquency. This growing line of research has produced evi-\ndence that abstention from delinquency (Barnes, Beaver, &\nBoutwell, 2011), onset of delinquency (DeLisi, Beaver,\nWright, & Vaughn, 2008), chronic criminality (Barnes &\nBoutwell, 2012), changes in delinquency (Connolly,\nSchwartz, Nedelec, Beaver, & Barnes, 2015), delinquent\npeer affiliation (Beaver, Ratchford, & Ferguson, 2009), and\nall, to some degree, heritable.\nPersonality traits corresponding to risk of criminal and\ndelinquent behavior have also shown evidence of being\nunder genetic influence (Krueger, South, Johnson, & Iacono,\nining low self-control (Beaver, DeLisi, Vaughn, Wright, &\nnegative emotionality (Krueger et al., 2008), and psychopa-\nthy (Beaver, Barnes, May, & Schwartz, 2011) have produced\nconsistent evidence that personality constructs positively\ncorrelated with crime and criminality are influenced by\ngenetic factors. Equally important, environmental exposures,\nin general, do not occur randomly and seem to be at least\npartly heritable (Kendler & Baker, 2007). Taken as a whole,\nwhat this body of evidence suggests is that the behaviors that\nare likely to increase the risk of arrest (i.e., delinquency), as\nwell as the personality constructs that are associated with\nthose behaviors (i.e., self-control), are influenced to varying\ndegrees by genetic factors. What is less clear, however, is\nwhether actual instances of contact with the CJ system--\nincluding arrests and convictions--are heritable. Despite\nlimited research in this regard, there is reason to suspect that\nformal processing through the CJ system may be influenced\nby genetic factors (for a broad overview of a related topic,\nGenetic Contributors of CJ Processing\nEarly evidence concerning the role of genes in predicting CJ\nprocessing outcomes was produced by Mednick, Gabrielli,\nand Hutchings (1984) using a sample of adoptees. Mednick\net al. examined both property and violent criminal convic-\ntions in adopted away children and their biological parents.\nAlthough the results indicated that genetic factors may influ-\nence convictions for property crime (adopted children cor-\nrelated significantly with their biological parents for this\nvariable), there was no significant correlation between\nadopted children and biological parents for violent criminal\nconvictions.\nA more recent analysis of adoptees was conducted by\nBeaver (2011) using data on individuals participating in the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health\n(Add Health). To indirectly tap genetic risk for antisocial\nbehavior, participants who reported having a biological par-\nent previously incarcerated were considered to be genetically\nvulnerable for criminal involvement. The results were indeed\nstark. Participants, for example, who reported two biological\nparents with a criminal history were more than 4 times more\nlikely to be arrested, more than 4 times more likely to be\nincarcerated, more than 8 times more likely to be sentenced\nto probation, and approximately 8 times more likely to be\narrested multiple times.\nUsing a large sample based outside of the United States,\nFrisell, Lichtenstein, and L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m (2011) examined con-\nvictions for violent crime in a sample consisting of millions\nof Swedish residents. The analyses examined familial aggre-\ngation across a range of criminal convictions, including con-\nvictions for homicide, assault, robbery, and arson (as well as\nother types of illegal actions). The results provided compel-\nling evidence of familial aggregation for multiple forms of\ncriminal conviction. Importantly, not only did relatives\nresemble one another for criminal convictions, the similarity\ngenerally increased along with genetic relatedness of the\nfamily members (though mating couples also displayed simi-\nlarity). This type of \"genetic cascade\" (Plomin et al., 2013) is\nsuggestive of a heritable trait. And, as Frisell et al. correctly\nBoutwell and Connolly 3\npointed out, their results map with those of prior behavioral\ngenetic studies, revealing that at least a moderate proportion\nof the variance in criminality is the result of genetic variation\n(Rhee & Waldman, 2002). Lacking in this study, however,\nwere precise parameter estimates for the contribution of\ngenetic and environmental factors to trait variance.\nThe Current Study\nThe studies just described provide an indication that CJ pro-\ncessing may be influenced by genetic factors, however, there\nis less evidence directly pertaining to the heritability of con-\ntact with the CJ system. Thus, the current study is intended to\ndirectly test this proposition. It is important to note that the\ncurrent study utilizes the same data set and CJ processing\nvariables as prior research (Beaver, 2011; Beaver &\nhowever, differs from earlier work in at least four important\nways. First, Beaver (2011) utilized adopted siblings in the\nAdd Health, and the current study uses the subsample of bio-\nlogically related siblings. The current analysis excludes any\nsiblings who were unrelated, yet residing in the same home.\nEssentially, the sample of participants analyzed here repre-\nsents a different sample from that of Beaver (2011).1\nSecond, Beaver's (2011) analysis employed an indirect\nmeasure of genetic risk to estimate the broad effects of the\ngenome on risk for CJ processing. The current study ana-\nlyzes sibling pairs to calculate pair similarity for a range of\nimportant CJ processing variables. Third, using behavioral\ngenetic techniques, the current study is intended to estimate\nthe proportion of variance in CJ processing that is accounted\nfor by latent genetic and environmental influences. This was\nnot the intent of prior research (Beaver, 2011). Fourth, and\nfinally, prior researchers examining the role of genetic fac-\ntors in CJ processing have examined the impact of measured\nResearchers have become increasingly aware, however, that\ncandidate gene research has some inherent limitations\n(Chabris, Lee, Cesarini, Benjamin, & Laibson, 2015; Dick\net al., 2015). As such, tremendous caution should be taken\nwhen examining the impact of individual genes on complex\nbehaviors.\nMethod\nData\nThe data included in this study were taken from the fourth\nwave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to\nAdult Health (Add Health; Harris, Halpern, Smolen, &\nHaberstick, 2006). The Add Health is a multiwave sample\nspanning decades of development beginning in early adoles-\ncence and traversing into adulthood. Data collection began in\n1994 while respondents were enrolled in middle and high\nschool. Three waves of subsequent data collection were\nundertaken with respondents at each wave reporting on top-\nics ranging from their personality traits, sexual activity, crim-\ninal involvement, victimization, family structures, and\nexisting medical conditions.\nA useful feature of the Add Health sample is that sibling\npairs, of varying degrees of genetic relatedness (i.e., MZ\ntwins, DZ twins, full siblings, half siblings) and nonrelated\nsiblings (i.e., step siblings living together in the same home),\nwere actively recruited for participation in data collection\n(Harris et al., 2006). Participants indicating that they had a\nsibling were (along with their co-twin) selected with 100%\ncertainty (Harris et al., 2006). The resulting sampling proce-\ncurrent study analyzes twin pairs who provided a response to\neach CJ outcome. As such, the final analytic sample included\nMeasures\nCJ contact. During the fourth, and most recent, wave of data\ncollection, respondents in the Add Health sample were asked\nto indicate whether they had ever been arrested, incarcerated,\nor placed on probation (Beaver, 2011; Beaver & Chaviano,\nincarceration items were coded dichotomously such that 1 =\nyes and 0 = no. Responses to the item assessing probation,\nhowever, was originally coded so that 0 = zero times, 1 =\nonce, and 2 = more than once. For ease of interpretation and\nconsistency with other CJ processing measures, the item\nassessing probation during the fourth wave was dichoto-\nmized such that 1 = ever convicted/placed on probation and\n0 = no convictions/probation sentences.\nPlan of Analysis\nThe plan of analysis for the current study involves a series\nof steps intended to systematically examine the genetic\nand environmental contributions to contact with the CJ\nsystem and CJ processing. The first step involved calcu-\nlating between-sibling correlations for MZ twins and DZ\ntwins for the arrest, incarceration, and probation mea-\nsures. This step was carried out to examine whether\ngenetic influences may explain a degree of variation in\nliability for each outcome. If the correlation on an out-\ncome for MZ twins (who share close to 100% of their\ngenetic material) is stronger than the correlation for DZ\ntwins (who share, on average, 50% of their genetic mate-\nrial), then this can be interpreted as preliminary evidence\nsuggesting that genetic factors account for a degree of\nvariation in the outcome measure.\nThe second step was to calculate intraclass odds ratios\n(ORs) for each of the outcomes described above (Cho, Guo,\nIritani, & Hallfors, 2006). The logistic regression equation\nestimated in this phase of the analytical process assumes the\nfollowing form:\n4 SAGE Open\nloge\nb b K\n( )\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( )\n( )\n-\n= + .\nThe interpretation of coefficient b\nremains straightforward,\nalthough it departs slightly from other forms of logistic\nregression analysis. In this case, the coefficient can be trans-\nformed (i.e., exponentiated to represent an OR) so that the\nparameter estimate captures the odds that Sibling 1 has a 1 on\nthe outcome variable based on their sibling's (i.e., Sibling 2)\nscore on the same measure--in this case one of the CJ pro-\ncessing items (Barnes et al., 2011). Importantly, genetic\ninfluences from this portion of the analysis are inferred if the\nsimilarity of sibling pairs increases along with their genetic\nrelatedness (i.e., if MZ twins are more similar than DZ twins;\nThe third step in the study was to directly estimate the\nproportion of variance in each CJ measure as well as the\ncomposite CJ measure that was the result of genetic and\nenvironmental influences. To estimate these effects, a series\nof univariate ACE models were fitted to the data. Biometric\nACE models are capable of partitioning variance of a mea-\nsurable outcome into three latent variance components: an\nadditive genetic component (symbolized as A), a shared\nenvironmental component (symbolized as C), and a non-\nshared environmental component, which also includes mea-\nsurement error (symbolized as E). Variation in an outcome\nexplained by additive genetic effects suggests that genetic\ndifferences between sibling pairs explain individual differ-\nences in the outcome under investigation.\nVariation in an outcome explained by shared environmen-\ntal effects suggests that shared environmental experiences\nbetween siblings explain similarities in a given outcome\nunder investigation. In contrast, variation in an outcome\naccounted for by nonshared environmental effects suggests\nthat unique environmental experiences between siblings\nexplain differences in an outcome under investigation. The\nnonshared environmental component also includes the\neffects of measurement error. The assumptions of the twin-\nbased research design have been tested several different\ntimes and in many different ways with results indicating that\nthe twin-based research method produces reliable and stable\nestimates of genetic and environmental effects on pheno-\ntypic variance, even when underlying assumptions are vio-\nGiven the dichotomous nature of the data, liability-thresh-\nold ACE models were estimated to assess the magnitude of\nadditive genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared envi-\nronmental effects on variation in liability for arrest, incarcera-\ntion, and probation (Prescott, 2004). ACE models were\nestimated using the statistical software program Mplus 7.1\nestimator. Model fit was evaluated based on an adjusted chi-\nsquare difference test statistic, the comparative fit index (CFI),\nand the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).\nBased on prior literature, the following model fit cutoff points\nwere used to assess satisfactory model fit: CFI  .90, Tucker\u00ad\nLewis index (TLI)  .95, and RMSEA  .05 (Hu & Bentler,\nResults\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for each outcome\nmeasure.

However, the pattern of correla-\ntions was slightly altered when examining female and male\ntwins separately. Specifically, the correlations for arrest were\nslightly stronger for female MZ twins compared with same-\nsex female DZ twins and considerably stronger for incarcera-\ntion. However, same-sex female DZ twins reported a slightly\nstronger correlation for probation compared with female MZ\ntwins, but the correlations were nonsignificant.

However, the odds of probation for female MZ\ntwins were nonsignificant and smaller compared with same-\nsex female DZ twins, while the odds of incarceration for\nmale MZ and same-sex DZ twins were nonsignificant.\nThe final step in the analytic plan was to directly esti-\nmate the proportion of variance in CJ processing measures\nthat was attributable to genetic and environmental effects.\nWe fitted a series of univariate ACE models to the data on\narrest, incarceration, and probation.

The present\nstudy extended this line of work by examining a sample of\nmale and female twins from a nationally representative sur-\nvey of youth. The results yielded two key findings that\ndeserve further attention.\nFirst, our results revealed that shared and nonshared\nenvironmental influences accounted for the variance in lia-\nbility for arrest among female and male twins. Interestingly,\nshared environmental influences explained the majority of\nthe variance in risk for arrest, suggesting that common envi-\nronmental experiences play an important role in explaining\nwhy some come into contact with the CJ system. Although\nspeculative, some possible mechanisms involved in the\nshared environmental influence on arrest might include\nshared subcultural values, socioeconomic factors, or even\nneighborhood factors (see also, Burt, 2009). Given the sig-\nnificant role of the nonshared environment as well, tech-\nniques such as those utilized by Beaver (2008) will be useful\nin further exploring whether differences in exposure to key\ncrime correlates, like delinquent peer groups, might also be\nimportant.\nSecond, results from univariate biometric models examin-\ning female and male twins separately revealed that additive\ngenetic and nonshared environmental influences explained\nvariation in liability for incarceration among females and\nprobation among males. Alternatively, the shared and non-\nshared environment appeared to explain variation in liability\nfor probation among females and incarceration among males.\nAlthough it is tempting to speculate about why genetic influ-\nences were different for different traits in males and females,\nwe should resist making strong inferences until our findings\ncan be replicated using larger, more powerful samples.\nNonetheless, what is clear is that the nonshared environment\nconsistently emerged as significant for every CJ processing\nvariable. What this means is that future research should make\nuse of twin and sibling designs to more thoroughly isolate\nand examine possible nonshared environmental causes and\ncorrelates of CJ processing (Beaver, 2008).\nThe current study was not without limitation, and it is\nimportant to discuss potential shortcomings. The first limita-\ntion concerns the measurement utilized to assess formal con-\ntact with the CJ system. Respondents were asked to\nself-report their contact with the justice system, and as a\nresult, issues with misreporting due to concerns over social\ndesirability could potentially affect the findings reported\nhere. There is some evidence suggesting that self-reported\nitems are both reliable and valid instruments for assessing\ncriminal involvement (Piquero, Farrington, & Blumstein,\nitems, then, may help to side step many of the potential prob-\nlems surrounding the use of official statistics (i.e., the justice\nsystem can only process crimes that are known to the police).\nNonetheless, the extent to which self-reported items have a\nbiasing effect on the results reported herein is an empirical\nquestion that requires further investigation. Also, although\nthere is some evidence from the Add Health data that find-\nings from the twin sample should generalize to a broader\npopulation of nontwins (Barnes & Boutwell, 2013), insight\nTable 6.

When considered alongside all other evidence per-\ntaining to the origins of virtually every other human out-\ncome, these results are to be expected (Chabris et al., 2015;\nsources of human variation for criminal behavior involve, to\nvaryingdegrees,bothgenesandenvironments.Unfortunately,\nmost criminological research examining CJ processing out-\ncomes do not focus on estimating or controlling for latent\ngenetic influences, which ultimately make it impossible to\ndistinguish between shared and nonshared environmental\nIn light of the current results, future studies now have\neven more reason to employ genetically sensitive designs\n(Barnes et al., 2014). Such an assertion may seem odd,\ngiven that some of the best fitting models presented in the\ncurrent study excluded the heritability variance component\nentirely, meaning that genetic influences did not appear to\naccount for any of the variance in liability for CJ outcomes.\nThis reality, however, does not obfuscate the importance of\ngenetically sensitive research designs and the usefulness of\ntwin data more broadly to criminological research.\nImportantly, commonly used standard social science\napproaches that do not account for the clustering of biologi-\ncally related siblings in an analytic sample cannot disen-\ntangle shared from nonshared environmental influences\nAlthough some of our models did reveal that genetic\nfactors failed to account for any of the variance in liability\nfor CJ processing, every model revealed a significant non-\nshared environmental parameter. While interesting, it is\nimportant to remember that the nonshared environment\ncomponent also contains variance from measurement\nerror. That said, it remains critical for researchers to use\ngenetically sensitive research designs such as the MZ dif-\nference score approach (Pike, Reiss, Hetherington, &\nPlomin, 1996) or sibling comparison approach to further\nidentify specific nonshared environments that might play\nan important role in explaining individual differences in\nCJ processing. Moreover, future research should begin to\nexamine potential endophenotypes (e.g., intelligence, low\nself-control, psychopathy) involved in explaining sex-\nspecific pathways between genetic influences and specific\nCJ processing outcomes. For the field of criminology to\nremain a relevant voice in the study of human behavior,\nthere needs to be a shift toward examining the relative\ncontribution, and interplay, between genetic and environ-\nmental sources of variance on both criminal behavior and\npathways to CJ processing (Barnes et al., 2014; Cullen,\nAuthors' Note\nPersons interested in obtaining data files from Add Health should\ncontact National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health\n(Add Health), Carolina Population Center, 123 W.
