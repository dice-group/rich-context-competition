Our findings suggest that school-based discrimination predicted\nincreased levels of depression and lower levels of self-esteem in short-term but not in long-term. The short-\nterm negative associations between discrimination and mental health were not moderated by levels of\npreference for American culture, and positive school experiences decrease the negative association be-\ntween discrimination and self-esteem. Implications from this study are discussed.\nKeywords: Filipino American Adolescents; Discrimination; Mental Health; Cultural Preference; School\nExperiences\nIntroduction\nFilipino American adolescents are underrepresented in the\neven though Filipino Americans are the third-largest Asian\nAmerican ethnic group in the US, totaling 2.56 million indi-\nviduals (US Census, 2010). Despite the large number of Fili-\npino Americans residing in the US, they are frequently describ-\ned as the \"invisible minorities\" (Cimmarusti, 1996). Filipino\nAmericans experience higher rates of perceived ethnic discri-\nmination than other major Asian American ethnic groups (Gee,\nSpencer, Chen, Yip, & Takeuchi, 2007) and are under repre-\nsented in mental health research. Gee and colleagues (2009)\nlink mental health outcomes with perceived discrimination ex-\nperiences. However, there has been little investigation on the\nshort-term and long-term mental health consequences of these\nnegative experiences on Filipino Americans. In addition, little\nis known about acculturation or school experience roles as mo-\nderators of perceived discrimination on the short-term and long-\nterm mental health of this group. This paper addresses these re-\nsearch gaps through data drawn from the Children of Immi-\ngrants Longitudinal Study (CILS; Portes & Rumbaut, 1991-\nPrior research using the CILS data examined mental health\nby examining two key cognitive and affective dimensions of\npsychosocial adaptation--self-esteem and depression. Rumbaut\n(1997) found that among all different nationalities examined in\nWave I (1992) of the CILS, only the Filipinos (and Vietnamese)\nshowed statistically significant lower self-esteem scores. They\nalso showed higher depression scores, especially among the fe-\nmale students.\nThe CILS dataset offers the opportunity to examine longitu-\ndinal associations between perceived discrimination and mental\nhealth. We targeted school-based experiences because ethnic\ndiscrimination is prevalent among Asian American children in\nthis setting (Gee et al., 2009). The study investigates the moder-\nating effects of \"preference for American culture\" (one of the\nmajor indicators of acculturation) and school experiences on\nboth short-term and long-term associations between discrimina-\ntory experiences and mental health. Investigating whether these\nfactors moderate mental health outcomes (both short-term and\nlong-term) would render valuable, practical interventions with\nthis population.\nLiterature Review\nFilipino Americans\nFilipino Americans are distinctive from other Asian Ameri-\ncan groups because \"they are the only Asian American group\nthat experienced direct American colonization\" (David & Oka-\nzaki, 2006: p. 5).

On the contrary, scholars have noted that the assump-\ntion based on their distinctive history is likely to mask true ad-\n1997). For example, in a large-scale immigrant survey (Rum-\nbaut, 1996), two-thirds of the Filipino adolescent respondents\nreported perceiving ethnic discrimination. The 2007 California\nHealth Interview Survey also showed that almost half of Fili-\npinos experienced less respect due to their race or accent in\ntheir speech in the past year and 50% of the discrimination\nwithin their lifetime occurred in educational settings (as cited in\nEthnic Discrimination and Mental Health in Filipino\nAmerican Adolescents\nExposure to ethnic discrimination can produce multiple det-\nrimental effects on ethnic minority adolescents' mental health,\nsuch as depression, low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, and an-\nxiety (Gee et al., 2009). Few studies have examined the Filipino\nadolescent population in this area. Rumbaut (1996) found that\nFilipino adolescents who experienced ethnic discrimination were\nmore susceptible to depressive symptoms. In an in-depth quail-\ntative study, Wolf (1997) suggests that experiences of ethnic di-\nscrimination and inequality account for why some Filipino\nAmerican adolescents suffer from psychological maladjustment\n(e.g., anxiety and depression) that further leads to increased sui-\ncidal ideation.\nPrior research did not pay much attention to the long-term\nassociations between ethnic discrimination and mental health\namong Filipino adolescents, with the exception of Ying and\nHan's (2006) study in which they found that current perception\nof school-based ethnic discrimination, and not past school-bas-\ned experiences of discrimination, predicted levels of depres-\nsion.\nSome features distinguish our study from Ying and Han's\nstudy. First, we examined the associations of ethnic discrimina-\ntion not only with depression but also with self-esteem in short-\nand long-term outcomes. Second, while Ying and Han's (2006)\nstudy examined school-based discrimination on middle adoles-\ncence (Mage\n= 14.12 years), we examined this phenomenon for\nlate adolescence (Mage\nined the role of potential moderators, i.e., preference for Ame-\nrican culture (one of the major indicators of acculturation) and\nschool experiences, for associations of discrimination with de-\npression and self-esteem.\nAcculturation as a Moderator\nEmpirical findings have been mixed regarding whether host-\nculture orientation serves as a buffer or an exacerbator in mo-\nderating the negative associations between discrimination and\nmental health of ethnic minority adolescents. One line of re-\nsearch suggests that higher levels of orientation toward the host\nculture alleviate the negative associations between discrimina-\ntion and mental health, e.g., less depression among Somali male\nadolescent refugees (Ellis et al., 2010) and higher self-esteem\namong American Indian female adolescents (Galliher, Jones, &\nDahl, 2010). This line of research can be interpreted with the\nlens of social identity theory (Turner, Brown, & Tajfel, 1979),\nin which holding a positive view toward a particular social\ngroup can contribute to strong identification with the group and\nfurther benefit psychological or externalized functioning. Ac-\ncordingly, individuals with ahigh orientation toward the host\nculture might be less susceptible to the harm of ethnic discri-\nmination given that they can easily seek social resources/sup-\nports of the host society to counteract these discriminatory en-\ncounters.\nAnother line of research based on cognitive dissonance the-\nory (Festinger, 1957) resulted in opposite findings. This theory\nposits that two discordant cognitions can expose individuals to\npsychological maladjustment. Based on this theory, adolescents\nwho are highly oriented toward the host culture but also feel di-\nscriminated are likely to produce two competing cognitions:\nThey are insiders due to high acculturation versus they are fo-\nreigners due to discrimination. The two dissonant beliefs can\naggravate adolescents' psychological maladjustment as shown\nby findings of Latino and Chinese American adolescents stu-\ndies (Brenner & Kim, 2009; Uman\u00e3-Taylor & Updegraff,\nTo our understanding, no research thus far has focused on\nacculturation as a moderator for Filipino American adolescents.\nDoing so would therefore be worthy to enhance our under-\nstanding on whether high orientation toward the host culture\nplays as a protector or an exacerbator in moderating associa-\ntions between discrimination and mental health for Filipino\npopulation. This looks at one indicator of acculturation--pref-\nerence for American culture measured in this dataset.\nSchool Experiences as a Moderator\nThe integrative model on developmental competencies of\nminority children highlights children's experiences in a micro-\nsystem, such as in school (Garcia et al., 1996). Our focus is\nthen on whether the school environment conveys friendly mes-\nsages and experiences for minority children, positively influ-\nencing their psychosocial and behavioral development. The\nadolescents' perceptions of having positive school experiences\n(e.g., school safety, a good learning environment, and positive\npeer/teacher relations) benefit Asian American adolescents' men-\ntal health, e.g., less depression, less social stress and anxiety,\nanalysis of the data drawn from the CILS also reveals that\nyouths attending schools they perceived as unsafe displayed\nsignificantly lower self-esteem and higher depressive symptoms\ncompared to those attending schools they perceived as safe\n(Rumbaut, 2005). Other research shows that these positive per-\nceptions of the school environment might mitigate Asian Ame-\nrican children's perceptions of negative encounters of discri-\nmination and racism due to their minority status (Lee, 2003).\nHowever, no research has yet examined whether positive school\nexperiences can mitigate the negative associations between eth-\nnic discrimination and mental health in Filipino Americans.\nThis study is directed to narrow this research gap by examining\nthe moderating effect of school experiences, i.e., students' per-\nceptions of school safety and learning environment.\nHypotheses\nSeveral hypotheses are tested in this paper. First, school-\nbased discrimination, both past (at Wave I) and current (at\nOpen Access\nWave II), would significantly predict increased levels of de-\npression and lower levels of self-esteem in Filipino American\nadolescents. Several studies on ethnic minority children have\nshown that exposure to discrimination can predict poor mental\nhealth, e.g., more depression and low self-esteem among Chi-\nnese Americans (Juang & Cookston, 2009) and African Ameri-\ncans (Brody et al., 2006) in both short-term and long-term.\nPrevious findings on ethnic minority children have been mix-\ned with respect to the moderating effects of preference for\nwe do not postulate whether levels of preference act as a buffer\nor as an exacerbator for either short-term or long-term associa-\ntions of discrimination with levels of depression and self-es-\nteem.\nWith respect to the moderating effects of school experiences,\ndue to the protective roles played by positive school environ-\nments, we hypothesized that positive school experiences would\nbuffer the negative associations of discrimination with depres-\nsion and self-esteem. Specifically, positive school experiences\nwould (a) decrease the positive associations of both past and\ncurrent discrimination with levels of depression; and (b) de-\ncrease the negative associations of both past and current dis-\ncrimination with levels of self-esteem.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS; Portes\nof first and second generation immigrants with origins from\nAsia and Latin America in three Waves. In the Wave I, adoles-\ncents in 8th and 9th grades from all public and private schools\nin San Diego and Miami were recruited. Recruitment criteria\nincluded adolescents born in the United States who had at least\none parent born abroad and those who were foreign-born and\nhave resided in the United States for at least five years. The\nadolescents (81.5% of the original sample) at the Wave II.\nWave III involved a sample that reached early adulthood, with\nan average age of 24 years of age, but this study examined only\ndata collected at Waves I and II.\nAt Wave I, 819 Filipino American adolescents participated in\nthe CILS, and 724 of the original adolescents participated in the\nfollow-up study at Wave II. The majority of respondents (98.7%)\nwere drawn from San Diego at Wave I. This study analyzed\nonly those participating in the follow-up study and those re-\nporting depression, self-esteem, and school-based discrimina-\ntion experiences at both Waves, yielding the final sample of\n676 adolescents. Of the sample, the proportion of males (50.1%)\nand females (49.9%) were almost equal. At Wave I, their mean\nage was 14.13 years (SD = .78) and their mean grade level was\nborn in the United States, 38.4% were born in Philippines,\nwhile the rest (4.3%) were born in other countries (e.g., in Eu-\nrope or Asia). Those born in Philippines or in other countries\nwere collapsed into the category of first generation, while those\nborn in the United States were second generation. The average\nage of migration for the first-generation participants was 6.70\nyears (SD = 4.67). With respect to socioeconomic status (SES),\nlower-middle class, 10.6% were working-class, .3% were poor,\nand the remaining (1%) were missing. SES was reported by\nadolescents at Wave I. For parental education, 33.7% of fathers\nand 26.9% of mothers received a high school degree or below,\nwhile 56.6% of fathers and 63.8% of mothers were university-\neducated or beyond. The remaining parents (9.7% of fathers\nand 9.3% of mothers) did not report their educational level.\nMeasures\nDepression. Depression was measured by four items from\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scales (CES-D;\nRadloff, 1977) for Wave I and Wave II. These items included:\nHow often have you felt this way during the past week? \"I felt\nsad\", \"I could not get going\", \"I didn't feel like eating; my ap-\npetite was poor\", and \"I felt depressed\". Responses were scored\non a 4-point scale on which: 0 = rarely; 1 = some of the time; 2\n= occasionally; 3 = most of the time. The four items were\nsummed and averaged to yield the mean level of depression.\nThe alpha reliability of this scale was .74 at Wave I and .76 at\nWave II. The reliability and validity of the CESD-4 have been\nfound to be sufficient in comparison with the full 20-item\nCESD (Melchior, Huba, Brown, & Reback, 1993).\nSelf-Esteem. In both Waves, levels of self-esteem were meas-\nured by Rosenberg's Self-Esteem scale (1979) with ten items.\nExamples of items were as follows: \"I am a person of worth\",\n\"I do things as well as other people\", and \"I do not have much\nto be proud of\". Responses were scored on a 4-point scale on\nwhich: 0 = disagrees a lot; 1 = disagrees a little; 2 = agrees a\nlittle; 3 = agrees a lot. Five items were worded negatively and\nfive items were worded positively. We reverse-weighted the ne-\ngatively phrased items, and summed and averaged all the items\nto yield the mean level of self-esteem. The alpha reliability of\nthis scale in the present study was .81 at Wave I and .84 at\nWave II.\nSchool-Based Discrimination. School-based discrimination\nincluded three kinds of discrimination in school settings: tea-\ncher discrimination, peer discrimination, and counselor discri-\nmination. In both waves, adolescents answered the question:\n\"Have you ever felt discriminated against by teachers?\" Simi-\nlarly, adolescents separately responded to the questions related\nto \"whether you have ever felt discriminated against by peers\"\nand \"whether you have ever felt discriminated against by coun-\nselors.\" Each response was coded as dichotomous variables (0\n= No and 1 = Yes) and then summed. School-based ethnic dis-\ncrimination score was based on the study conducted by Ying\nPreference for American Culture. Orientation toward the\nhost society was assessed by levels of preference for doing\nthings the American way as reported at Wave II. Adolescents\nonly answered one question: \"How often do you prefer Ameri-\ncan ways of doing things?\" This item was scored on a 4-point\nscale on which: 0 = never, 1 = sometimes, 2 = most of the time,\nand 3 = all the time. One study using the CILS data identified\nthis item as the indicator of levels of acculturation (Ying & Han,\n2007). In this study, we focus on this indicator of acculturation.\nSchool Experiences. At Wave II, school experiences meas-\nured participants' perceptions of school safety and the learning\nenvironment. The results of the factor analysis indicated the\ntwo-dimensional structure of the perceived school experiences\nscale. The first extracted factor was correlated with items as-\nsessing school discipline, grading fairness, and teachers' atti-\ntudes. The second extracted factor was highly correlated with\nthree items: \"Don't feel safe in school\" (r = .52, p < .001),\n\"Students disruptions prevent learning\" (r = .53, p < .001), and\n\"Many gangs in school\" (r = .55, p < .001). This study focuses\non the second factor. Responses were scored on a 4-point scale\non which: 0 = disagrees a lot; 1 = disagrees a little; 2 = agrees a\nlittle; 3 = agrees a lot. The scores of all items were reversely\ncoded for further analyses and convenience of interpretation.\nAll the items were summed and averaged to yield the mean\nlevel of school experiences. Higher scores represent more posi-\ntive school experiences. The alpha reliability of this scale in the\npresent study was .54.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. Participants\nreported low levels of depression and school-based discrimina-\ntion at Waves I and II, as indicated by scores below midpoint of\nitem range. Participants reported high levels of self-esteem at\nboth waves and high levels of preference for American culture,\nas indicated by scores beyond midpoint of item range. Their\nschool experiences were moderately positive given that the mean\nwas close to the midpoint of item range.\nAnalyses\nBefore testing the study hypotheses, we explored the rela-\ntions between demographic variables and the study variables.\nCompared to the male adolescents, the female adolescents re-\nported higher levels of depression at Wave I and Wave II\nlower levels of self-esteem at Wave I and Wave II (ts(674) =\nCompared to the first-generation adolescents, the second-gen-\neration adolescents reported higher levels of preference for\npoint average (GPA) was significantly and positively correlated\nwith levels of self-esteem at Wave I and Wave II (rs(674) = .25\nsearch (Uman\u00e3-Taylor & Updegraff, 2007) and initial analyses,\nDescriptive statistics of the major variables.\nRange\nVariable M SD Potential Actual\nSchool-based\ndiscrimination WI\nSchool-based\ndiscrimination WII\nPreference for American\nculture at WII\nregression analyses controlled for covariates including gender,\ngenerational status, GPA, age, and SES. SES is the unit-weight-\ned standardized scale as created by Portes and Rumbaut (1991-\n2006). We used single dummy codes for gender (1 = female)\nand generational status (1 = first generation). In addition, when\nexamining the discrimination-adjustment link, prior research\ncontrolled for the past levels of adjustment (Benner & Kim,\npast or current discriminatory experiences and depression and\nself-esteem, respective levels at Wave I were controlled.\nFour separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses exa-\nmined the associations of past and current school-based dis-\ncrimination with depression and self-esteem. Four regression\nmodels were implemented for each regression analysis. In Mo-\ndel 1, we entered the previously-mentioned controlled variables.\nModel 2 tested associations of past or current school-based dis-\ncrimination with mental health at Wave II, given that covariates\nwere statically controlled. To test associations of past discrimi-\nnatory experiences with depression and self-esteem, school-ba-\nsed discrimination at Wave I was entered. To test associations\nof current discriminatory experiences with depression and self-\nesteem, school-based discrimination at Wave II was entered. In\nModel 3, preference for American culture and school experi-\nences were entered as a block. Model 4 tested moderating ef-\nfects of preference for American culture and school experiences\non links between discrimination and mental health.\nTo test associations of past discriminatory experiences with-\ndepression and self-esteem, two interactions were entered as a\nblock: school-based discrimination at Wave I by preference for\nAmerican culture and school-based discrimination at Wave I by\nschool experiences. To test associations of current discrimina-\ntory experiences with depression and self-esteem, two interac-\ntions were entered as a block: school-based discrimination at\nWave II by preference for American culture and school-based\ndiscrimination at Wave II by school experiences.\nBased on Cohen and colleagues' recommendations (2003),\nschool-based discrimination Waves I and II, preference for\nAmerican culture at Wave II, and school experiences at Wave\nII were centered on their means to decrease multicollinearity.\nR2 and Fchange\nwere computed between the main-effect model\n(Model 3) and the moderator model (Model 4). For the interac-\ntion model (i.e., Model 4), R2 and its level of significance\nprovided information on what percentage of additional variance\ninteraction effects accounted for depression and self-esteem at\nWave II.

Contrary to\nour hypothesis, school-based discrimination at Wave I with\ncontrolled covariates did not significantly predict self-esteem at\nWave II (see Model 2). The long-term association between\nschool-based discrimination and self-esteem was not signifi-\ncant.

In Model 2,\nschool-based discrimination at Wave II ( = .16, p < .001) with\ncontrolled covariates positively and significantly predicted de-\npression at Wave II (see Table 3).

In Model 4,\nthe school-based discrimination at Wave II by preference for\nAmerican culture interaction effect and the school-based dis-\ncrimination at Wave II by school experiences interaction effect\nwere not significant. These findings reveal that levels of pref-\nerence for American culture and school experiences did not\nmoderate short-term association between discrimination and de-\npression.\nAssociation between Current School-Based Discriminatory\nExperiences at Wave II and Self-Esteem at Wave II. Results are\nshown in Table 3. The results of Model 1 were the same as\nthose shown in Model 1 in the analyses testing the association\nbetween past school-based discrimination and self-esteem at\nWave II. In Model 2, school-based discrimination at Wave II (\n= -.14, p< .001) negatively and significantly predicted levels of\nself-esteem at Wave II. This finding was consistent with our\nhypothesis that the short-term school-based discrimination sig-\nnificantly predicted lower levels of self-esteem.\nModel 3 shows that levels of self-esteem at Wave II were\npositively and significantly predicted by school experiences at\nWave II ( = .17, p < .001), but not by preference for American\nculture at Wave II. This result suggests that current positive\nschool experiences were related to increased self-esteem.

This finding corresponds to the positive correlation\nbetween current school-based discrimination and levels of de-\npression for Filipino American adolescents found by Ying and\nHan (2006), albeit that their target was middle adolescents.

Taken together, the findings of this study\nand other literature suggest that the longitudinal harm of ethnic\ndiscrimination is less significant to psychological adjustment,\nbut might exact more severe consequences on externalized out-\ncomes (e.g., school performance and engagement or substance\nuse). However, caution is in order when drawing implications\nof these findings. Although this study showed that past experi-\nences of discrimination do not appear to associate with detri-\nmental effects on long-term mental health of late adolescents,\nthese experiences might emerge as a threatening factor for Fili-\npino Americans' mental health in adulthood. Further research\nshould focus on longitudinal studies tracing associations be-\ntween past discriminatory experiences and mental health as indi-\nviduals become younger or older adults.\nThis study extended the study of Ying and Han (2006) by\nexamining moderating effects of both preference for American\nculture and school experiences for associations of school-based\ndiscrimination with depression and self-esteem for Filipino\nAmerican adolescents. Our study shows preference for Ameri-\ncan culture did not moderate the associations between current\nexperiences of school-based discrimination with depression and\nself-esteem. This finding suggests that school-based discrimi-\nnation may bring similar levels of negative effects on mental\nhealth among Filipino American adolescents with both high\nand low preference for American culture. This might be ex-\nplained by their colonial history. Although Filipinos are geo-\ngraphically defined as Asians, they have a unique culture, i.e.,\nbeing more heavily impacted by Spanish and American coloni-\nzation than the cultures of other Asian groups (David & Oka-\nzaki, 2006). Due to direct American colonization, first and sec-\nond generation Filipino Americans bears a colonial mentality\nwhereby their native culture can be denigrated and American\nculture accorded a superior status (David & Okazaki, 2006).\nThe colonial mentality is prevalent among Filipino Americans\nand internalized into their cognition (David & Okazaki, 2006).\nFor example, Filipino Americans commonly hold self-image of\n\"being Americanized\". Accordingly, we surmised that Filipino\nAmerican adolescents might subconsciously or consciously view\nthemselves as being Americanized as important, regardless of\ntheir tendencies of acculturation, such as preference for Ameri-\ncan culture. The cognition of being Americanized conveys a\nvery discordant message against their discriminatory encounters,\nsuch as feeling alienated from American peers. The cognitive\ndissonance theory posits that two discordant cognitions can ex-\npose individuals to psychological maladjustment (Festinger, 1957).\nBased on this theory, the degrees of negative associations be-\ntween discriminatory experiences and mental health are plausi-\nbly similar for Filipino American adolescents, regardless of whe-\nther they hold high or low preference for American culture.\nContrary to the research findings of the moderating effect of\nacculturation on Latino and Chinese Americans (Benner & Kim,\nthat acculturation exacerbates the negative association between\ndiscrimination and mental health. Moreover, our finding was\ncontradictory to the assumption drawn from social identity the-\nory (Turner et al., 1979) and findings on Somali male adoles-\ncent refugees (Ellis et al., 2010) and American Indian female\nadolescents (Galliher et al., 2010), which suggest that accultura-\ntion buffers the negative association between discrimination\nand mental health. We argue that these mixed findings on the\nmoderating role of acculturation (including indicators such as\npreference for American culture, language usage, and participa-\ntion of activities) might stem from three different values about\nacculturation across different ethnic groups. First, some groups\nmay view high acculturation as an access to gain social sup-\nports of the host culture against discriminatory experiences. Se-\ncond, some groups may view acculturation as a proof of being\nassimilated into the host culture; thus, discrimination and accul-\nturation should be treated as two incompatible cognitions. Third,\nthe colonial mentality such as high self-image of being Ameri-\ncanized is strongly rooted in Filipino Americans' cognition where-\nby acculturation plays a less important role in moderating the\neffect of discrimination. Alternatively, the mixed findings may\nbe due to inconsistent measures of acculturation: Uman\u00e3-Taylor\noral domain, Galliher et al. (2010) and our study assessed cul-\ntural preference, and Benner and Kim (2009) assessed both do-\nmains and values. Using a consistent measure of acculturation\nshould be conducted in the future.\nThis study extended previous studies on the protective and\nbuffering role played by positive school experiences for the\nassociation between ethnic discrimination and self-esteem. Po-\nsitive school experiences, i.e., a safe and positive learning en-\nvironment, were found to alleviate the negative association be-\ntween school-based discrimination and self-esteem in the short-\nterm. Research on Asian American adolescents or college stu-\ndents has shown that a positive school environment, including\nschool safety and positive peer/teacher relations, mitigates per-\nceptions of discrimination (Lee, 2003), and protects adolescents\nfrom negative associations between discrimination and mental\nhealth the negative effects of discrimination on mental health,\ne.g., depression (in Taiwanese immigrants, Tsai, 2006; in Afri-\ncan Americans, Brody et al., 2006). In line with these findings,\nour study suggests that school safety and a positive learning\nenvironment might mitigate the short-term negative association\nof school-based discriminatory encounters for Filipino Ame-\nrican adolescents' mental health. Taken together, the findings\nfrom our study and other literature suggest that the overall qua-\nlity of safe and positive school environment may influence eth-\nnic minority children's perception of negative encounters that\noccurred in school and thus protect the ethnic minority chil-\ndren's mental health.\nOne unexpected finding is that adolescents' SES was nega-\ntively associated with depression given that other covariates\nwere controlled. This finding is inconsistent with the long es-\ntablished association between low SES and increased risk of\ndepression (e.g., a meta-analysis by Lorant and colleagues,\n2003). However, this can be explained by the diminishing re-\nturns hypothesis (Farmer & Ferraro, 2005). This hypothesis po-\nsits that compared to Whites, ethnic minorities gain less econo-\nmic or social-status returns accompanied by high SES. These\ndiminishing returns increase high SES ethnic minorities' aware-\nness of the social and economic inequalities and in turn are de-\ntrimental to their mental health. Thus, among ethnic minorities,\nhigh SES compared to low SES individuals tend to experience\nincreased risk of depression. Our finding supports this hypothe-\nsis.\nLimitations and Implications\nDespite providing new insights on the mental health of Fili-\npino American adolescents, this study has some limitations.\nFirst, the present study's failure to detect significant long-term\nassociations between ethnic discrimination and mental health\nmight be linked to the nature of the CILS data, i.e., a lapse of\nthree years between Waves I and II, diminishing the strength of\nthe association. Future studies with shortened time points (e.g.,\none or two years) and assessing more time points would more\nclearly describe the longitudinal effects of discrimination.\nSecond, measurement limitation rests on the construct of\nadolescents' acculturation orientation. In the CILS data, adole-\nscents' acculturation orientation was only assessed by one item\nmeasuring preference for American culture. Previous research\nhas revealed that the nature of acculturation is multi-dimensio-\nnal and multi-faceted (Berry, 2003). The use of only one item\ncannot reflect the overall picture of acculturation of Filipino\nAmerican adolescents. This limitation might also explain the\nfailure to capture the moderating effect of acculturation. Future\nstudies should assess Filipino adolescents' acculturation with\nscales based on a multi-dimensional framework.\nThird, we surmised that the failure to detect the moderating\neffect of preference for American culture is explained by the\nprevalence of a colonial mentality in the Filipino population,\nregardless of their levels of acculturation. However, this study\ncould not examine the relation between colonial mentality and\nacculturation given that the CILS data did not provide any\nitems or scales assessing colonial mentality. In fact, only one\nstudy to date attempted to quantify and measure the colonial\nmentality of Filipino American adolescents (Bergano & Ber-\ngano-Kinney, 1997). Yet, their measure has been questioned\nwith low face validity due to the limited numbers of items (Da-\nvid & Okazaki, 2006). Future research to develop more valid\nmeasures of colonial mentality will clarify its relationship to ac-\nculturation. Doing so would better describe the link between\ncolonial mentality and the overall psychological adjustment of\nthe Filipino American adolescents.\nFourth, one statistical issue rests on the extent of statistical\nOpen Access\npower for detecting interaction effects. One interaction effect\nwas found, i.e., school-based discrimination at Wave II by school\nexperiences at Wave II, but this study had a low power to detect\ninteractions are not easy to be observed in social science re-\nsearch and often explain a small portion of variance over and\nabove first-order effects (i.e., R2 from .01 to .05). Although\nR2 of this study fell into this range, the interpretation of this\nsignificant interaction effect should be interpreted with caution\ndue to the low power.\nThese limitations notwithstanding, the present study provides\nuseful information on how adults in school settings such as\neducators and clinicians can assist Filipino American adoles-\ncents to overcome the harm of discriminatory experiences. Our\nresearch suggests that both highly and lowly acculturated ado-\nlescents might be susceptible to negative effects of current\nschool-based ethnic discrimination in the short-term. Educa-\ntors' and clinicians' support of school and psychological adjust-\nment with all Filipino American adolescents, regardless of their\nlevels of acculturation, becomes critical.\nAnother implication is that school administrators and teach-\ners play important roles to provide positive school experiences,\ni.e., a safe and good learning environment for students. Evi-\ndence from our study that strong levels of school safety and\ngood learning environment appear to be protective factors against\nschool-based ethnic discrimination suggests that school admin-\nistrators and teachers have significant roles to support Filipino\nAmerican adolescents. For example, they can consistently mo-\nnitor their school for unsafe situations among students (e.g.,\nconflicts between racial/ethnic groups and gang activities) as\nwell as foster a positive learning environment. Facilitating a\nsafe school environment and robust learning experiences can\nhelp decrease potential harm of school-based discrimination and\nfurther enhance Filipino American adolescents' mental health.\nREFERENCES\nBenner, A.
