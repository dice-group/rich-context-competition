Prevalence rates were\nweighted to adjust for the complex design to infer gen-\neralizability to the US population.\nResults: The likelihood of having a mood, anxiety, or\ncombined mood-anxiety disorder generally showed a pat-\ntern of decline with age (P.05). Twelve-month disor-\nders showed higher rates in women compared with men,\na statistically significant trend with age. In addition, anxi-\nety disorders were as high if not higher than mood dis-\norders across age groups (overall 12-month rates: mood,\n5% and anxiety, 12%). No differences were found be-\ntween race/ethnicity groups.\nConclusion: Prevalence rates of DSM-IV mood and anxi-\nety disorders in late life tend to decline with age, but re-\nmain very common, especially in women.

However, the NCS did not in-\nclude older adults and also examined DSM-III-R disor-\nders.15 In contrast, the NCS Replication (NCS-R) was con-\nand expanded assessments based on the current diag-\nnostic criteria of the DSM-IV.14 Additionally, the NCS-R\nincludes a nationally representative distribution of sex\nand race/ethnicity. These are 2 important demographic\nfactors when considering prevalence rates at the popu-\nlation level but are understudied in mental health re-\nsearch of late life.16-19 Recent examination of the NCS-R\nincluded comparison of older adults' (65 years) and\nlence rates.20 This study did not consider detailed com-\nparisons of older age cohorts, including the oldest old\n(85 years), and did not account for comorbid mood and\nanxiety disorder.\nThe purpose of our study was to determine nation-\nally representative estimates of age-specific 12-month\nprevalence rates of DSM-IV mood, anxiety, and comor-\nbid disorders among community-dwelling older adults\nin the NCS-R, comparing young-old, mid-old, old-old,\nand oldest-old US respondents. This study examines\nage-stratified diagnostic measures of psychiatric disor-\nders, including the oldest-old and sex and race/ethnic\ndifferences, in a large probability sample of older\nadults.\nMETHODS\nPARTICIPANTS\nThe NCS-R is a nationally representative survey of 9282 non-\ninstitutionalized participants 18 years and older in the coter-\nminous United States.21-23 Respondents were selected from a mul-\ntistage clustered area probability sample of households. Face-\nto-face interviews were conducted in respondents' homes\nin nursing homes, assisted living, and independent living fa-\ncilities were therefore excluded from the sample. Any cluster-\ning of respondents by retirement communities was alleviated\nby the household enumeration procedures used in NCS-R to\ncreate a national probability sample. Professional interviewers\nfrom the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michi-\ngan, Ann Arbor, carried out interviews. The response rate was\nThe current sample consisted of 2575 community-based\nadults 55 years and older, with data obtained from the Inter-\nuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research.24 The\nNCS-R was administered in 2 parts. The part 1 sample, which\nis the focus of this study, included all respondents assessed for\ncore mental disorders. One thousand three hundred seventy-\ntwo of the 2575 who met criteria for any lifetime mental dis-\norder in part 1, plus a probability subsample of other partici-\ninterview included questions about risk factors, conse-\nquences, other correlates, and additional mental disorders. As-\nsessment for posttraumatic stress disorder required lengthier\nintroductory questions than other disorders, which precluded\nthe quick skip out of noncases that was desired in part 1.21 Thus,\nposttraumatic stress disorder was only assessed in the part 2\nsurvey. The NCS-R data were weighted to control for differ-\nential probabilities of selection, differential nonresponse, and\nresidual differences between demographic variables of the sample\nthe NCS-R sampling and weighting procedures are outlined else-\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment\nThe NCS-R diagnoses were determined using the World\nHealth Organization World Mental Health (WMH) Survey\nInitiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview (CIDI).28 The WMH-CIDI is a fully structured lay\ninterview that generates lifetime and 12-month diagnoses\naccording to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th\nthe DSM-IV criteria were used. The mental disorders exam-\nined included mood disorders (major depressive disorder,\ndysthymia, bipolar I and II disorders), anxiety disorders\n(panic disorder, agoraphobia without panic, specific phobia,\nsocial phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttrau-\nmatic stress disorder), and comorbid mood-anxiety disorder\n(ie, any co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders). DSM-IV\norganic exclusion rules and hierarchy rules were used in\nmaking diagnoses.21,25 Using a probability subsample of\nNCS-R respondents in a clinical calibration design,30 Kessler\net al21 found that blind clinical reinterviews with the Struc-\ntured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV31 were in good con-\ncordance with WMH-CIDI diagnoses for mood and anxiety\ndisorders.\nSociodemographic Variables\nDistributions of sociodemographic variables by 12-month DSM-\nIV/WMH-CIDI mood, anxiety, and comorbid mood-anxiety dis-\norders were examined. The main demographic variable of in-\nterest was age defined by 4 categories: young-old (55-64 years),\n(85 years). These were examined overall and by sex and race/\nethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and His-\npanic or other). In addition, we examined completed years of\ncohabitating, divorced/separated/widowed, never married), and\ngeographic region of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, and\nWest).\nTo create as accurate a presentation as possible of the trend\nof psychiatric disorders across increasing age groups, plots of\nfigures were further refined, plotting weighted prevalence rates\nby 5-year age intervals.\nPrevalenceratesweredeterminedbyfrequencymeasuresandcross-\ntabulations estimating age differences across DSM-IV disorders.\nTwelve-month prevalence was estimated as the percentage of re-\nspondents who had a mood, anxiety, or comorbid mood-anxiety\ndisorder in the year prior to the interview.\nThree sets of analyses were considered for mood, anxiety,\nand comorbid disorders. First, overall proportions were esti-\nmated by the age categories young-old, mid-old, old-old, and\noldest old. Second, age differences were examined by sex.\nFinally, age differences were examined by race/ethnicity. To\nstatistically test if prevalence trends across age groups were\ndifferent between men and women and between race/ethnic\ncategories, interaction terms with age modeled as continu-\nous (and main effects) were examined in logistic regression\nanalyses, correcting for the complex sampling design.\nBecause overall prevalence rates were similar and prevalence\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

Thus, the percentages represent weighted pro-\nportions and statistical differences were estimated based on the\nRao-Scott 2, which corrects for the complex design.32 The stan-\ndard errors were determined from a recalculation of variance\nusing the Taylor series linear approximation method.33 Design-\nadjusted estimates and tests were not computed when a table\ncell had zero frequency.\nThe part 1 sample and weights were used for all analyses\nexceptindividualanalysesofposttraumaticstressdisorder,which\nwere conducted with part 2 weights and included an addi-\ntional weight adjusting for oversampling of part 1 cases. Be-\ncause posttraumatic stress disorder was a component of the\npooled anxiety disorders, sensitivity analyses were conducted\nusing the part 2 sample to examine pooled (any) anxiety dis-\norders, as well as comorbid disorder. The results using either\nsample for analysis were shown to be similar. Therefore, to main-\ntain power and precision, all final analyses of pooled disorders\nwere conducted using the larger part 1 sample.\nStatistical tests were 2-tailed with P.05 defining statisti-\ncal significance.

The majority of the sample had a\nhigh school education or higher, and more than half the\nrespondents were married or not living alone.

There are 3 key findings in the\npresent study: (1) declining prevalence with age; (2) rates\nof anxiety disorders as high as mood disorders; and (3)\nthe common co-occurrence of these disorders. Rates were\ngenerally higher for women in each age group but did\nnot vary by race or ethnicity.\nThe first and general finding from our study was the\noverall trend found for adults of increasing age--a gen-\neral decline in the 12-month prevalence of mood, anxi-\nety, and comorbid disorders. Statistically, prevalence rates\nwith increasing age were more prominent for 12-month\nrates among women compared with men (P.05). Ear-\nlier studies of both clinical and community-based stud-\nies suggest such a pattern of decline with age.6,10,34 The\nECA found a consistent trend of lower DSM mental dis-\norders in late life when grouping age categories to-\ngether. Work by Gum et al20 found a similar trend in the\nNCS-R with lower rates in older adults (65 years) vs\nyounger adults (aged 18-64 years). Recent international\nresearch by Kohn and colleagues35 found the same de-\ncreasing pattern with age in a sample of adults from Latin\nAmerica. Further, studies have found women to have\nhigher prevalence rates of symptoms of depression, anxi-\nety, and coexisting depression-anxiety than men, while\nracial differences are less consistent.16-18 Our study found\nno statistically significant difference across race/\nethnicity; however, small cell counts for minority groups\nequated to lower power to detect a difference.\nThe second key finding was that rates of anxiety dis-\norders were as high or even higher (with pooled rates\nhigher; overall 12-month rate, 12%) than mood disor-\nders (overall 12-month rate, 5%). The age-specific rates\nof anxiety were higher than mood disorders in each age\nyears (vs 8% for mood) and 8% for those 85 years and\nolder (vs 2% for mood). Similarly, anxiety disorders were\nthe most prevalent disorders among those 65 years and\nolder in the ECA, with phobic disorder the most preva-\nlent individual disorder.10 Interestingly, we found high\nprevalence of specific and social phobias, disorders not\noften investigated and often underappreciated. Unlike our\nstudy, the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam deter-\nmined high rates of generalized anxiety disorder (7.3%\nvs 2.0% in our study).36 This discrepancy between re-\nported prevalence rates highlights largely methodologi-\ncal differences (eg, sampling procedures and attrition rates,\ndefinition and operationalization of anxiety) and poten-\ntial cultural differences between population-based stud-\nies. Most studies of anxiety disorders among US older\nadults have been examined relative to their occurrence\nin patients with depression. Research by Lenze et al37\nfound a high rate of at least 1 current (23%) anxiety dis-\norder in depressed older adults (60 years) from pri-\nmary care and psychiatric settings. Work from our group\ninvestigating anxiety symptoms in a cohort of community-\nof participants reported current anxiety symptoms, where\nwomen (20%) had higher rates than men (12%)\n(P.001).16 Our present findings suggest similar re-\nsults with diagnostic anxiety disorders, which are promi-\nnent and pervasive in older adults even into the oldest\nyears.\nThe third finding was the high rate of coexisting mood\nand anxiety disorders in NCS-R respondents (overall 12-\nmonth rate, 3%). Geriatric psychiatry research is strug-\ngling to understand the comorbid depression-anxiety out-\ncomes and treatment needs. Thus far, the impact of\ncomorbid depression-anxiety is greater than initially es-\ntimated. Most US studies have been clinically based and,\nas mentioned earlier, found high prevalence rates of co-\nmorbid anxiety in patients with depression.37-39 In con-\ntrast, the NCS-R's advantage is that it allows the exami-\nnation of a nationally representative group, highlighting\nthe impact of comorbid and individual mood and anxi-\nety disorders in the population. Our results showed that\nthe co-occurrence of mood and anxiety disorders in the\ncommunity was high, common, and significant across age\nstrata 55 years and older, investigating overall trends as\nwell as by sex and race/ethnicity.\nInvestigation of the oldest age cohort (85 years),\nwhich maintained prominent prevalence rates, war-\nrants comment. Because individuals 85 years and older\nare not always captured in geriatric psychiatric re-\nsearch, the present examination suggests the need for more\nresearch in this group and confronting potential chal-\nlenges specific to the study of this group.

All rights reserved.\nthe oldest old are less available for study, except in in-\nstitutional settings, and experience heterogeneity of\ncomorbid diseases, creating difficult study of pure dis-\norders in the population.40 Epidemiological evidence for\nage-specific trends of depression in older adults often mea-\nsured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depres-\nsion Scale41 or Geriatric Depression Scale42 has shown an\nin most clinical studies,6,10 rates of diagnosed depres-\nsion consistently decline in older age groups. Thus, un-\nderstanding diagnostic patterns in the oldest old is com-\nplex and requires more investigation than the present\nstudy provides.\nIn contrast, given the strong effect of cognitive and\nphysical health as predictors and outcomes of mental\nhealth disorders,1-5 the finding of a general decline in\nmood, anxiety, and comorbid mood-anxiety disorders\nwith age is counterintuitive. Three possible explana-\ntions for this general decline with age include (1) co-\nhort effect (ie, as the young-old age, they will maintain\nhigher levels of mental disorders); (2) healthy survivor\nbias or differential mortality, institutionalization (ie, those\ninstitutionalized were not sampled); and (3) epidemio-\nlogical methods and diagnostic issues in assessing older\nadults for psychiatric disorders (eg, difficulty remem-\nbering symptoms, stigma related to the reporting of men-\ntal health disorders, somatic symptoms reported but de-\ntermined to be related to chronic conditions instead of\nmental health disorders).\nThe strengths of this study include a nationally rep-\nresentative probability sample, current DSM diagnostic\nassessment, and precise age stratification to define trends\nfor young-old, mid-old, old-old, and oldest-old cohorts.\nThis study helps to describe the prevalence of mood, anxi-\nety, and comorbid mood-anxiety disorders in a nation-\nally representative sample of older US adults. It high-\nlights those disorders with the greatest potential for\nintervention and prevention, research, and services, trans-\nlating back into science those diseases with the greatest\npotential impact on the older public's health.\nThe implications of the study findings include the\npublic health relevance of anxiety disorders in older\nadults and the need for more research focused on the\noldest-old age group, women, and minority groups.\nGiven the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in the\ncommunity, the lack of attention in research and pro-\ngram policy statements to anxiety disorders in older\nadults is disturbing.44,45 The literature has shown that\ncomorbid anxiety in depressed elderly patients leads\nto poorer treatment outcomes than depression alone.38\nThus, the high prevalence of comorbid mood-anxiety\ndisorders found in our study suggests the modifying\ninfluence of anxiety on antidepressant treatment out-\ncomes is a serious concern.\nThe oldest old are the fastest growing age group in the\nUnited States.40 The oldest old are often underrepre-\nsented so estimates from community samples have been\ndifficult to obtain. Because mental disorders are associ-\nated with declining physical health that occurs with fre-\nquency in older age,1-5 the assessment of psychiatric dis-\norders is an important indicator of health and increased\nrisk of mortality in this older population.\nIn addition, these results expand beyond the field of\ngeriatric psychiatry, highlighting the importance of di-\nagnosis, treatment, and management of psychiatric symp-\ntoms and disorders in younger years. Given the chronic-\nity of these disorders, preventing their occurrence in later\nlife implies that clinicians and researchers outside geri-\natrics need to be more vigilant about diagnosis and treat-\nment in early years. These disorders are common in\nyounger adults and most have early age at onset but of-\nten are not diagnosed or underdiagnosed and under-\nThere are 3 main limitations of this study. First, the\nNCS-R underrepresents homeless, institutionalized, and\nnon\u00adEnglish-speaking older adults. Second, there may\nbe issues of stigma, whereby older adults with mental ill-\nness might be less inclined to participate in a mental health\nsurvey. Third, even though the WMH-CIDI was shown\nto have good concordance with the Structured Clinical\nInterview for DSM-IV,21 it is still a lay-administered\ninterview rather than a clinically administered assess-\nment, especially in the context of medical illness, dis-\nability, and cognitive decline. Thus, given these limita-\ntions, the estimates herein are probably conservative.\nAdditional limitations include details associated with\nsurveying older populations that were not available in\nthe NCS-R. These include assessment of the response rate\nin those 55 years and older and demonstration of accept-\nable reliability of the NCS-R instruments for older adults.\nFurther, the NCS-R was limited in its assessment of mood\ndisorders, as we were unable to determine prevalence rates\nof some disorders that would be considered common in\nolder adults, eg, depression not otherwise specified, de-\nmentia with depression, mood disorders secondary to\nmedical disorders, adjustment disorders with depres-\nsion, and bereavement. Because depression in older adults\nmay present differently (more apathy, social with-\ndrawal, irritability), the criteria for a major depression\ndiagnosis may not be met, although the other symp-\ntoms may be severe, suggesting an underestimation of\nthe prevalence rate in NCS-R older adults. This under-\nestimation is probably large considering the potential for\nreporting bias in older adults due to difficulty recalling\nsymptoms or difficulty associating symptoms with psy-\nchological distress.\nThe study of nationally representative samples pro-\nvides evidence for research and policy planning that\nhelps to define community-based priorities for future\npsychiatric research. The findings of this study empha-\nsize the importance of individual and coexisting mood\nand anxiety disorders when studying older adults,\neven the oldest cohorts. Further study of risk factors,\ncourse, and severity is needed to target intervention,\nprevention, and health care needs. Given the rapid\naging of the US population, the potential public health\nburden of late-life mental health disorders will likely\ngrow as well, suggesting the importance of continued\nepidemiologic monitoring of the mental health status\nof the young-old, mid-old, old-old, and oldest-old\ncohorts.\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.
