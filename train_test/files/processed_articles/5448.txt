    "abstract": "Abstract: Although humans spend a third of their life asleep, their choice of sleeping\nplaces has so far been little investigated both theoretically and empirically. We address this\nissue from the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Our basic assumption is that\nhumans have an evolved preference for safe sleeping places, that is, those that promise\nprotection against potential aggressors and nighttime predation. Several testable predictions\nwere derived from this assumption concerning the preferred location of the bed in a\nsleeping room. Specifically, we predicted that people prefer sleeping places that allow them\nto view the entrances to the sleeping room (doors and windows) from a distance while\nremaining concealed from the entrances themselves. To test these hypotheses, 138\nparticipants were asked to arrange a bed and other pieces of furniture on floor plans that\nwere experimentally manipulated with respect to the direction in which the door opened\nand the presence of a window. In agreement with predictions, participants predominantly\npositioned the bed in a way that (a) allowed them to see the door, (b) was as distant as\npossible from the door, and (c) was on the side of the room toward which the door opened.\nIn addition, the positioning of the bed was influenced as predicted by the presence of a\nwindow.\n",

Newborns sleep about 16\nhours, grown-ups 7-8 hours, and elderly people approximately 6 hours (Zimbardo and\nGerrig, 2004). Thus, the bedroom is one of the rooms in which humans spend most of their\ntime, and the bed is probably the piece of furniture they use most.\nSleeping in safe places\nAlthough numerous sleep-related phenomena have been empirically investigated,\nsuch as sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea, Aloia, Arnedt, Davis, Riggs, and Byrd, 2004),\nsleeping phases (Gulyani, Majumdar, and Mallick, 2000) and sleep-related social practices\nsuch as bed-sharing (Ball, 2002), surprisingly few studies have addressed people's\npreferences for the furnishing and layout of bedrooms and beds. Parsons (1972, 1981)\nsummarized early research on the topic providing several recommendations concerning the\nsize, lighting, airing and furnishing of bedrooms and the size, height and bedding of beds\n(but not their positioning). One study addressed the more specific question of how to\nposition the bed in relation to the door, using a structured interview technique (Famos,\nemphasized humans' general need for secure habitats on a theoretical basis without,\nhowever, formulating concrete predictions concerning furnishing.\nThe small number of experimental psychological studies on the topic of beds and\nbedrooms is not theory-based and has focused on questions such as color preferences and\nthe comfort of different mattresses (Bader and Engdal, 2000; Christl and Richter, 2004;\nSlatter and Whitfield, 1977). Apart from a few further studies of a similar kind, there are no\npsychological experiments concerned with the topic of bedrooms and beds. Moreover,\nalthough traditional research in architectural psychology is often based on Gestalt\npsychology (cf. Schramm and Richter, 2004) or field theory (cf. Ehmig and Richter, 2004),\nthese theories have not been applied to the prediction of human sleeping site preferences.\nIn sum, whereas many other sleep-related phenomena have been extensively\ninvestigated, bedrooms and beds have inspired only very little experimental and theory-\nbased psychological research, despite their essential meaning. Indeed, as far as we know,\nthe topic addressed in this article--the preferred position of the bed in a sleeping room--\nhas never been experimentally investigated before. This is surprising, since the question of\nwhere the bed (i.e., the sleeping place) is located in relation to the entrance to the bedroom\n(i.e., the sleeping site) seems to be of fundamental importance for the understanding of\nhuman sleeping behavior. Furthermore, it is only through the systematic study of sleeping\nsite and place preferences that we can hope to arrive at scientifically founded practical\nrecommendations concerning the architectural design of rooms and the positioning of beds\nwithin these rooms (e.g., in hotels).\nIn marked contrast to the scarce empirical research on human sleeping site and\nplace preferences as well as its atheoretical nature, the corresponding preferences of\nmammalians in general (Allison and Cicchetti, 1976), as well as nonhuman primates and\nmonkeys, have been investigated extensively from the perspective of the theory of\nevolution (for a theoretical transfer of research on apes' nesting behavior to human housing\nsee: James, 2009). For example, Di Bitetti, Vidal, Baldovino, and Benesovsky (2000)\nstudied how capuchin monkeys choose their sleeping places and found clear indications\nthat this choice is mainly motivated by the concern of finding safety from aggressors\n(rather than, for example, safety from parasites). A whole body of literature on the choice\nof sleeping places in baboons (e.g., Hamilton, 1982) likewise shows that one of the most\nimportant criteria for the choice of a sleeping site is that it is inaccessible to aggressors (for\ngibbons see: Reichard, 1998; for langurs and macaques see: Ramakrishnan and Coss,\nthat not only is the choice of sleeping sites in primates strongly influenced by the level of\nsafety from aggressors that it provides (cf. Isbell, 1994), but also that the primates'\nSleeping in safe places\nbehavior at their sleeping places is directed at minimizing the risk of being attacked. In\nfact, research indicates that for monkeys sleeping site selections ensuring safety by\nreducing predation risk might be even more important than foraging (Smith, Knogge,\nHuck, L\u00f6ttker, Buchanan-Smith, and Heyman, 2007). Taken together, research of\nnonhuman primates and other mammalians documents that evolutionary considerations\n(more specifically: predation risk) are remarkably well able to explain the choice of\nsleeping locations: mammals prefer sleeping places that maximize their chances of survival\nduring sleep and thereby increase their inclusive fitness.\nDuring recent years, the theory of evolution has become increasingly accepted in\npsychology as providing plausible and parsimonious explanations of certain phenomena,\nsuch as sex differences in mate preferences (e.g., Buss, 2004). However, in the field of\narchitectural psychology, the theory of evolution seems to have been applied only rarely\n(e.g., it has been used to explain distorted perceptions of architecture; Rump, 2004) and has\nnot inspired much empirical research. We aim at connecting architectural psychology more\nclosely to evolutionary psychology, by studying human sleeping preferences--specifically\nthe location of the sleeping place (bed) within the sleeping site (bedroom) in relation to\npossible entrances--from an evolutionary perspective.\nIn keeping with the general evolutionary approach and the primate studies reviewed\nabove, the focus is on the fitness costs and benefits of different sleeping site preferences.\nThe general hypothesis tested is that humans tend to position their bed within a sleeping\nroom in a way that maximizes safety from possible aggressors. Even though sleeping\nrooms and doors were not part of our environment of evolutionary adaptedness, it seems\nreasonable to assume that we perceive them in a similar way as our ancestors might have\nperceived, for instance, caves and their entrances (cf. Brain, 1981, p. 271). Further\nsubstantiating the legitimacy of an evolutionary approach to current living environments, it\nseems justified to assume that modifications of our environment (such as doors) are\nactually based on our evolutionary needs: \"The world has been selectively changed to suit\nthe needs of people. [...] In seeking to tailor the world to human needs and desires, people\nhave altered what the world has to offer\" (Michaels and Carello, 1981, p. 54f).\nBased on the results of primate and anthropological research (Groves and Sabater\nwe assume that during the evolutionary development of humans, attacks during sleep came\nfrom nonhuman predators, that is, hunters belonging to other species (Hankerson and\nCaine, 2004; Peetz, Norconk, and Kinzey, 1992) as well as from conspecific aggressors (cf.\nHamilton, 1982). Even though in modern urban surroundings attacks by predators no\nlonger pose a significant threat (but see for rural areas: Packer, Ikanda, Kissui, and Kushnir,\naggressors do remain an issue. Indeed, empirical research suggests that aggression-caused\nattacks of humans on other humans occur preferably at night (Cohn and Rotton, 1997), that\nis, the time predominantly used for sleeping. In line with this, the most frequently reported\ncontent of children and adolescent nighttime fears is fear of intruders (Gordon, King,\nGullone, Muris, and Ollendick, 2007; Muris, Merckelbach, Ollendick, King, and Bogie,\nSafety from predators can be maximized by choosing a sleeping place that (a)\nallows one to detect a potential aggressor as early as possible (cf. Nasar, Julian, Buchman,\nHumphreys, and Mrohaly, 1983), (b) allows one to remain hidden from the aggressor as\nSleeping in safe places\nlong as possible, and (c) allows for maximum reaction time in the case of an attack (at this\npoint, we want to note that not only this choice of sleeping places but also characteristics of\nsleep itself are assumed to be influenced by predation pressure, see: Lesku, Roth, Amlaner,\nThe evolved preference of humans concerning sleeping sites may be regarded as\nforming the core of a set of evolved psychological processes. We assume that these\nprocesses solved a specific problem of survival: sleep is a biological necessity for humans.\nWhile asleep, sensory (especially visual) input is reduced and the person is in a state of\ndiminished consciousness. For these reasons, a sleeping person is easy to attack, a fact of\nwhich aggressors certainly have tried to take advantage of during evolution. Evolved\npsychological processes that motivate humans to find a safe sleeping site will foster\nsurvival and will for this reason be selected for.\nSimilar to the concept of the evolved psychological mechanism (Buss, 2004) we\npropose that the information that these processes use to determine the adaptationally best\nlocation of the sleeping place is limited to information relevant for protecting against\npossible attacks by aggressors. Other information, such as for example air humidity, is not\nconsidered relevant in this context. This does not mean, of course, that the ultimate\ndecision for a sleeping place cannot be influenced by nonevolutionary considerations, or\nenvironmental aspects (e.g., temperature, cf. Videan, 2006), as well.\nFurthermore, we think that these evolved psychological processes (perhaps by\ntriggering affective states) result in behavioral output. For example, the feeling of\ndiscomfort caused by an adaptationally inappropriate sleeping place (e.g., with the head\npositioned in direction and close to the entrance) may lead to feelings of discomfort causing\nthe individual to change or modify the sleep setting (e.g., by moving the bed farther away\nfrom the door and placing the body with the feet in direction to the entrance) thus helping\nthe individual to optimize its sleeping place in order to reduce potential risks e.g., of being\nkilled by an intruder. From a Gibsonian perspective of affordances (cf. Michaels and\nCarello, 1981, p. 41f), the bed and the entrance might be perceived by the individual\nthrough their affordances (i.e., their meaning). Therefore, while the bed is perceived as a\nplace to sleep, the entrance is perceived as an access possibility for potential aggressors.\nWe assume that evolved psychological processes enable the individual to meaningfully\nrelate these interpretations of the environment with each other thus enabling optimizing\nmodifications of the environment when necessary.\nIn sum, we postulate a set of evolved psychological processes underlying the choice\nof sleeping places in humans, which is accessible to empirical research. In this article, we\nfocused on but a few, but central predictions that can be derived from this set of processes.\nSpecifically, using prearranged floor plans, we empirically tested five hypotheses\nconcerning the positioning of the bed in a sleeping room. Hypotheses 1a and 1b concern the\ndirection in which the bed is placed in relation to the door and window; hypotheses 2a and\n2b concern the distance at which the bed is placed from the door and the window; and\nhypothesis 3 concerns the location of the bed in the room in relation to the door.\nHypothesis 1a. If possible, people prefer to place their beds in a room in a way that\nallows them to see the door from a resting position without having to move their heads\nmuch, rather than to have the door in their back. Reason: a room surrounded by walls is\nprimarily entered through the door. To detect an aggressor as soon as possible, it is\ntherefore best to place the bed in a way that allows one to have a view of the door.\nSleeping in safe places\nHypothesis 1b. If the bedroom has a window, and if it is not possible to position\noneself in a way that allows one to see the door and the window at the same time, the\npreference for the location of the bed (hypothesis 1a) is reduced. Reason: if a window is\npresent, it poses another possibility of entering the sleeping place that needs to be taken\ninto account; hence two behavioral tendencies that cannot be enacted simultaneously (to the\nsame degree) are present. However, as the door still remains the main entrance, most\npeople are expected to stick with the preference for keeping the door in view, although\n(depending on interindividual differences in how the threat posed by the door and window\nare assessed) some may regard keeping the window in view as more important.\nHypothesis 2a. Other factors constant, people prefer sleeping places farther away\nfrom the entrance to the room. Reason: greater distance allows more time to react to the\nentry of an aggressor; therefore, other factors constant, sleeping places that are farther away\nfrom the entrance are safer and should thus be preferred.\nHypothesis 2b. If the sleeping room also has a window in the wall opposite the door,\nthe distance preference is modified as follows: the bed is placed closer to the door than if\nthe room has no window. Reason: this placement simultaneously maximizes distance to\nboth potential entry points of an aggressor.\nHypothesis 3. Other factors constant, people prefer to sleep on that side of the room\nto which the door opens. Reason: should an aggressor enter the room, it is of advantage to\nbe on the side of the room to which the door opens, as this allows one to remain unseen\nlonger, but to quickly see the door being opened.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nhad other jobs. More than 80% of participants had a general qualification for university\nentrance, at least.\nMaterials and Design.\nDepending on condition, participants were presented with one of four different floor\nplans showing a bedroom (Figure 1). The floor plans differed with respect to (a) the\npresence versus absence of a window in the wall opposite the door, and (b) the direction in\nwhich the door opened (to the right versus to the left). These two variables were combined\ninto a 2 (window present vs. absent) \u00d7 2 (door opens to the left vs. to the right) factorial\ndesign. Male and female participants were separately assigned at random to the four\nexperimental conditions (34-36 participants per condition). Participants were tested\nindividually. At the beginning, a floor plan was placed horizontally on a board. The floor\nplan was 12 cm x 22 cm in size and showed a non-furnished room. On an instruction sheet,\nthe participant was asked to furnish the bedroom in the way he or she liked it best, keeping\nin mind that a separate bathroom (not shown on the plan) was available in the apartment.\nFigure 1. Example of a floor plan showing an unfurnished bedroom with a window; door\nopens to the right.\nSleeping in safe places\nNext to the floor plan, four true-to-scale moveable and widely used pictorial\nsymbols of pieces of furniture were positioned in random order on the board. They\nchair (2.2 cm x 2.4 cm). The meanings of these pictorial symbols were explained on the\ninstruction sheet. Although our interest was on the positioning of the bed, we added other\npieces of furniture to enhance the ecological validity of the participants' task (furnishing a\nroom), and to direct their attention away from the bed. The bed was deliberately made\nlonger (12.7 cm) than the width of the floor plan (12.0 cm), so that it could only be\npositioned at the longitudinal side of the bedroom or diagonally, but not at the narrower\nside of the room. This was done to simplify the interpretation of the participants' responses\nby restricting the possible locations of the bed. For similar reasons, the window (when\npresent) was placed in the wall opposite the door. This position of the window made it\nimpossible to watch the window and the door at the same time from a resting position\n(Figure 2), thus allowing us to separate the direction and strength of the influences of the\ndoor and the window on the positioning of the bed.\nFigure 2. Example of a floor plan showing a furnished bedroom with a window; door\nopens to the left. Another bed is shown outside the bedroom next to its smaller side to\nillustrate graphically that the bed was too large to be placed on this side of the wall.\nAfter the participants had arranged the furniture, they provided some demographic\ninformation. Furnishing the room and completing the questionnaire took about 15 minutes.\nAfter each session, the furniture arrangement of the participant was copied by the\nexperimenter onto a sheet of paper for further analysis.\nDependent variables.\nDependent variables included the following: (a) the direction of the bed (i.e., head\nside towards the door vs. towards the wall opposite the door) chosen by the participant; (b)\nthe distance between the wall opposite the door and the bed (measured in cm); and (c) the\nSleeping in safe places\nside of the room where the bed was positioned (i.e., the side to which the door opened\nversus the opposite side).\nResults\nPreliminary data analyses did not reveal any reliable differences for sex or\neducational level on the dependent variables.\nHypothesis 1a. In each of the four experimental conditions, the majority of the\nparticipants (76-94%) positioned the bed in such a way that it offered a view of the door\nfrom the resting position. Across conditions, 83% preferred this bed position. This is\nsignificantly more than would be expected in the absence of a preference for bed position\n(i.e., 50%), binomial test, p < .001, effect size for dichotomous data g = .33. According to\nCohen (1988), this is a large effect. Hence, supporting hypothesis 1a, the preferred bed\nposition was strongly influenced by the presence of the door.\nHypothesis 1b. In line with hypothesis 1b, fewer participants (79%) selected a bed\nposition with a view of the door if the room had a window than if it had no window (87%).\nThus the percentage of persons who directed their view away from the door increased if the\nroom had a window. However, the effect size was small (crosstab data effect size w = 0.10;\ncf. Cohen, 1988), and the difference between conditions did not reach significance, \u00b2 (1, N\nHypothesis 2a. Within experimental groups 50-83% of the participants (overall:\n70%) positioned the bed to the wall opposite the door without leaving space between bed\nand wall. Hence, a significant majority (binomial test, p < .001; g = .20) of the participants\nchose the maximum possible distance between bed and door.\nTheoretically, the maximum possible distance between the bed and the wall\nopposite the door was 9.3 cm on the floor map. However, if the bed was positioned at this\ndistance, it was no longer possible to (fully) open the door since it was blocked by the bed.\nThe practically feasible maximum distance between bed and wall was therefore only 4.3\ncm on the map (5 cm minus the width of the maximally opened door; see Figure 3; note\nthat choosing the practically rather than the theoretically feasible maximum distance results\nin a conservative test of the hypothesis at stake). Assuming that the participants had no\npreference for any of the practically feasible distances between bed and wall from 0.00 cm\nto 4.30 cm, they should have chosen each distance with equal probability, and the expected\ndistance is then 2.15 cm. A one-sample t-test comparing this theoretically expected mean\ndistance between bed and wall in the case of no preference with the observed mean\n(according to Cohen, 1988, d  0.80 indicates a large effect), thus further confirming a\npreference for sleeping places farther away from the entrance to the room.\nFigure 3. Example of a floor plan without a window showing the bed positioned with\nmaximum distance (4.3 cm on the plan) from the wall opposite the door.\nSleeping in safe places\nIn sum, the participants (a) preferred a bed position maximally away from the door\nwith a probability significantly beyond chance and (b) chose on average a distance\nsignificantly greater than expected on the assumption that all distances were equally\npreferred.\nHypothesis 2b. Overall, 70% of the respondents did not leave any space between the\nbed and the wall opposite the door, meaning that they placed the bed at the maximally\npossible distance to the door. However, if the experimental conditions with and without a\nwindow are considered separately, the respective percentages are different: 81% of the\nparticipants in the condition without a window, but only 59% in the condition with a\nwindow positioned the bed at the maximally possible distance to the door, \u00b2(1, N = 138) =\nconditions, a majority of the participants positioned the bed maximally away from the door\nto the opposite wall; however, if a window was present in this wall, a noteworthy\nproportion of the participants decided to move the bed away from the wall.\nOn average, participants left a distance of 0.81 cm between bed and wall. A\nWelch's t-test comparing the chosen distance in the condition with a window (M = 1.2 cm,\nSD = 2.0) and without a window (M = 0.4 cm, SD = 1.3) revealed a significant difference,\nchosen distance between bed and wall was markedly influenced by the presence vs.\nabsence of a window in this wall.\nHypothesis 3. According to hypothesis 3, participants should prefer to sleep on the\nside of the room to which the door opens. In the test of this hypothesis, we had to exclude\ntwo participants because their positioning of the bed (diagonally and in the middle of the\nroom, respectively) did not allow us to unambiguously assign the bed position to one side\nof the room. Analyses of the remaining data supported hypothesis 3: A total of 74% of the\nparticipants positioned the bed on the left side of the room if the door opened to the left,\nand 64% positioned the bed on the right side of the room if the door opened to the right.\nThe difference between the two conditions was statistically significant, \u00b2(1, N = 136) =\ndirection in which the door opens is also important for the positioning of the bed:\nParticipants preferably positioned their bed to the side of the room to which the door\nopened; presumably because from this location, they can see when the door is opened\nwithout being immediately visible to the person entering the room.\nDiscussion\nAlthough previous psychological studies have investigated diverse aspects of sleep\nSleeping in safe places\nand sleep-related behavior, only very few of them have specifically looked at the preferred\narrangement of the sleeping site (i.e., bedroom) thereby pursuing a non-experimental and\natheoretical approach.\nIn contrast, the present study used experimental methodology to test predictions\nderived from an evolutionary-psychological theory of sleeping place preferences\nconcerning the preferred positioning of the bed in the sleeping room. Starting from the\nconsideration that sleeping constitutes a state of increased vulnerability, and the assumption\nthat protection during sleep was a selection factor in human's evolutionary history, we\npostulated a set of evolved psychological processes whose function is to minimize the risk\nof fitness costs resulting from attacks during sleep. Our hypotheses concerned two aspects\nof bed position that are of crucial importance for reducing the fitness costs resulting from\npossible attacks: the easy visibility of possible room entrances (door and windows) to the\nperson lying in the bed, and the establishment of space between the sleeping place and the\npossible entrances. We predicted that people should prefer a bed position that (a) allows\nthem to keep the entrance in view, ideally without being immediately visible themselves to\na possible attacker (as is the case if the bed is positioned at the wall to which the door\nopens); and (b) allows them to prepare against an attacker entering the room, which is\nachieved most easily by keeping a distance to the room entrances. We tested these\nhypotheses by asking participants to furnish hypothetical bedrooms that were\nexperimentally varied in a way that allowed us to study the effects of different entrance\nconfigurations.\nIn line with predictions, participants predominantly positioned the bed in a way that\nallowed them to see the door. This preference was found both when the door was the only\nentrance to the room, and when a window was present at the opposite side of the room. In\nthe latter case, however, there was a tendency (although it failed to reach statistical\nsignificance) towards a reduced preference for the \"visible door\" bed position. This\norientation towards the (only) entrance is in line with the assumed selection pressure of our\nancestors during roosting: \"Pliocene hominids that anticipated a particular direction of\nattack might have been more successful at evading predation\" (Coss and Goldthwaite,\n1995, p. 129). In addition to this orientation towards the entrance, also in line with\npredictions, the majority of the participants positioned their beds on that side of the room to\nwhich the door opened. As said, evolutionary theory explains this finding by assuming that\nthis bed position allows the person lying in the bed to quickly perceive the opening of the\ndoor while remaining hidden from the intruder. This positioning closely corresponds to the\nconcept of prospect refuge (Appleton, 1975), a place providing the possibility \"to look out\nand not be seen\" (Owens, 1988, p. 21). Finally, we found strong evidence for a tendency to\nmaximize the distance between the bed and the entrance. This maximization is primarily\nassumed to provide the sleeping person with increased time to react on approaching\nintruders. In sum, fundamental aspects of bed positioning were systematically influenced\nby the entrance options to the bedroom in a way that was predicted by, and can be\nparsimoniously and coherently explained by evolutionary-psychological considerations that\ncenter on an evolved desire for a safe sleeping place.\nOur results are in line with existing findings. For instance, the distance\nmaximization between bed and dominant entrance option corresponds to research\nindicating that even young children without climbing experience maximize their distance\nbetween themselves and a ground predator (e.g., a lion) by preferring higher trees as\nSleeping in safe places\nantipredator refuge sites (Coss and Moore, 2002). Moreover, our results closely correspond\nto findings of a controlled primate study on sleeping place preferences (Caine, Potter, and\nMayer, 1992) which found that captive tamarins chose as sleeping places boxes that were\nmaximally distant to the door of the room.\nIn addition to being supportive of the evolutionary approach to sleeping site\npreferences in humans, our findings are somewhat inconsistent with alternative non-\nevolutionary approaches. For example, they are difficult to explain purely in terms of\nconsiderations of functionality. If the positioning of the bed were fully determined by\nconsiderations of functionality, people should not prefer the maximum practically feasible\ndistance between bed and entrance, because this distance has to be walked whenever one\nmoves into or out of the room from the bed (e.g., when going to the restroom at night).\nFinally, choosing to sleep at the side of the room to which the door opens also is counter to\nconvenience, as it means a longer way to walk to open the door (or, if it is already partly\nopen, to circumvent it) to leave the room.\nStill, some aspects of our findings are amenable to an ergonomic-functional\nexplanation. For example, some participants may have positioned the head side of the bed\nto the wall because they imagined a bed without a headrest, and wanted to compensate for\nits lack by placing the bed to the wall (however, this explanation cannot explain the\ntendency to keep the window in view by turning the head position to the room). Moreover,\npositioning of the bed in relation to the door might also be influenced by intentions to avoid\na draft coming from this entrance. These alternative explanations can be tested in future\nstudies in which the relevant variables are systematically varied. For example, participants\ncould be explicitly informed that the bed has a headrest versus no headrest or that draft is\npresent versus absent.\nA different alternative explanation of our findings that could be attempted is to\nexplain them in terms of culturally transmitted norms. Specifically, it could be argued that\nthe preferred bed position is the traditional and culturally prescribed way of how to position\none's bed. However, the mere existence of such cultural norms does not contradict the\nevolutionary explanation, because these norms could themselves be based on evolutionary\npreferences. Furthermore, it can be questioned whether such explicit norms--at least norms\nthat are behaviorally relevant, as opposed to mere folk traditions--do indeed exist. If the\nevolutionary story is correct, there may be no need for such norms, because the\nevolutionary preferences are strong enough to make people prefer particular bed positions.\nTo our knowledge, there is at present no systematic empirical evidence concerning the\nexistence of such norms. However, this question is highly amenable to future (cross\ncultural) research (cf. Tooby and Cosmides, 1992).\nAccording to the postulated processes, safe bed positions might elicit feelings of\ncomfort and unsafe bed positions feelings of discomfort. These feelings were not measured\nin our study. However, this could easily be done in future research by asking participants to\nimagine safe and unsafe bed positions, and to indicate the experienced degree of comfort\nversus discomfort. We predict that participants experience discomfort when they imagine\nan unsafe bed position (i.e., one counter to their evolutionary preferences), and therefore\navoid such configurations. Conversely, they should experience comfort if they imagine safe\nbed positions.\nA methodological limitation of the present study is that the participants did not\nfurnish a real room nor spend a real night in it, but did both only in their imagination.\nSleeping in safe places\nHowever, participants were apparently able to imagine the room quite well; for example,\nthey spontaneously added flowerpots to the floor map or commented on what they would\nstore in the closet. Furthermore, asking participants to imagine places and situations is a\nwell-established method of architectural psychology (e.g., Slatter and Whitfield, 1977) and\nof evolutionary psychology (e.g., Buss, Larsen, Westen, and Semmelroth, 1992).\nMoreover, we believe that the task (furnishing a room) has prima facie ecological validity,\nwhich was further increased by the requirement to actually arrange the icons on the floor\nplan.\nAnother limitation of the present study is that the pre-specified floor plans used\npermitted only a restricted set of possibilities to arrange the furniture, specifically the bed.\nIn particular, there was not enough room to position the bed at a right angle to the door or\non the same wall as the door. As mentioned, this restriction was deliberately chosen to limit\nthe degrees of freedom available to the participants for positioning the bed to those\nlocations that were particularly diagnostic (in particular, this restriction forced the\nparticipants to move the bed either towards or away from the door). Nevertheless, future\nstudies should also use floor plans with higher degrees of freedom.\nAnother limitation of our research is that our floor plans and the symbolic\nrepresentations of the furniture were only two-dimensional in nature. Therefore, it was not\npossible to modify the height of the bed which might be influenced by evolutionary\nmechanisms, as well (cf. Hunt, 1997, p. 65). Thus, future research should try to replicate\nour findings by using three-dimensional representations of the room (e.g., by means of\nvirtual environments).\nTo summarize, the present study seeks to contribute to the literature on sleeping\nbehavior in three ways. First, by examining the effects of the position of the door and the\nwindow on bed positioning, we investigated a central aspect of human sleeping\nenvironments that, surprisingly, has not been experimentally investigated so far. Second,\nwe presented a theoretical framework for investigating the topic of sleeping place\npreference that allows concrete predictions that can be experimentally tested. Thereby,\nevolutionary psychology is put to concrete use in the field of architectural psychology.\nThird, the present study also contributes to evolutionary psychology, by extending its\ndomain of application to the domain of sleeping behavior in humans. We postulated the\nexistence of evolved psychological processes for sleeping that are of central importance for\nhuman survival, comparable to the evolutionary mechanisms for e.g., food selection.\nThereby, we hope to have opened up a new field of inquiry to evolutionary psychology that\nhas not been attended to so far.\nThe present results encourage further investigation of the topic. Three possible lines\nof future inquiry were already mentioned: the investigation of the universality versus\npossible cultural specificity of sleeping place preferences; the investigation of possible\nmediating emotional processes (comfort and discomfort); and the systematic test of\npossible alternative explanations of (certain aspects of) our findings, such as the hypotheses\nthat sleeping-place preferences are based on functional-ergonomic considerations. Further\nstudies could also address individual differences in bed positioning, as well as the effect of\nvarious contextual conditions on bed positioning (e.g., knowledge of where the sleeping\nroom is situated in the house, for example the ground floor versus the second floor) and the\ninterplay with other security-related mechanisms (e.g., increased group cohesion at night,\ncf. Vessey, 1973). More generally, it would be interesting to extend the present\nSleeping in safe places\nevolutionary model to other types of rooms and their protective function.\nPerhaps characteristic of modern achievement societies, too little attention has been\npaid to sleeping as a central human need. The present work seeks to contribute to changing\nthis state of affairs, at least on an empirical level.\n"
