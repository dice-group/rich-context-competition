    "abstract": "Abstract\nResponding to calls for research into measurable English language outcomes from individual language support consultations\nat universities, this study investigated the effect of individual consultations (ICs) on the academic writing skills and lexico-\ngrammatical competence of students who speak English as an additional language (EAL). Attendance by 31 EAL students\nat ICs was recorded, and samples of their academic writing texts before and after a 9-month interval were compared.\nParticipants' academic writing skills were rated, and lexico-grammatical irregularities were quantified. No statistically\nsignificant positive shifts manifested, due to the relatively short research period and limited participant uptake, but there\nwere encouraging predictors of future shifts given continued utilization of the service. First, although a Wilcoxon signed-rank\ntest showed no association between attendance at ICs and shifts in academic writing ability, a Spearman's rho calculation\nsuggested a tentative relationship to positive pre\u00adpost shifts in three academic writing sub-skills: Task Fulfillment, Grammar,\nand Vocabulary. Second, instances of four common lexico-grammatical irregularities (subject/verb, wrong word, plural/\nsingular, and punctuation) declined at post-testing. Although only regular, sustained attendance would produce statistically\nsignificant shifts, there is a potential association between participants' use of ICs and improved academic writing skills/lexico-\ngrammatical competence.\n",

This has been\nspurred by Birrell, Hawthorne, and Richardson's (2006)\nreport evaluating Australia's General Skilled Migration\nCategories, which noted that \"many international students\nenter and exit Australian courses at IELTS levels far below\nthe published guidelines\" (p. 107). Another study by Birrell\n(2006) reported that one in three international students did\nnot achieve an International English Language Testing\nSystem (IELTS) score of 6.0 (typically required for entry to\ntertiary institutions) by the end of their university programs.\nThese studies have placed the onus for ensuring adequate\nlanguage skills on institutions, forcing universities to reap-\npraise their language support practices. Their findings\nunderline the necessity for appropriate academic and lin-\nguistic support programs (Barrett-Lennard, Dunworth,\nstudents who speak English as an additional language\n(EAL).\nOne language support resource often employed at\nAustralian institutions is individual academic writing consul-\ntations (Arkoudis & Starfield, 2007; Stevenson & Kokkinn,\nlanguage and learning (ALL) advisors support students' aca-\ndemicwritingthroughtargetedone-to-onetutoring(Chanock,\n2000) to assist students to gain sufficient linguistic and aca-\ndemic skills to become independent learners. The specific\npractices vary between universities in terms of location and\ncontext (e.g., within a library or faculty or in a dedicated\nALL unit or as part of a general support resource), the dura-\ntion of sessions, the nomenclature (appointment, tutorial,\nsession, drop-in), how students access the service (self-\nselect, referral, or both), and how frequently they can access\n1Griffith University, Queensland, Australia\n2University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nIan Walkinshaw, School of Languages and Linguistics, Griffith University,\nEmail: i.walkinshaw@griffith.edu.au\nIndividual Consultations: Academic\nWriting Outcomes for International\nStudents\nIan Walkinshaw1, Todd Milford2, and Keri Freeman1\n Keywords\nacademic language and learning, academic writing, English as an additional language, individual consultations\n2 SAGE Open\nit (limited or unlimited; Stevenson & Kokkinn, 2009).\nNevertheless, a commonality is that all such services manage\na myriad of language and learning needs that are specific to\nindividual students and which call for a targeted individual\nresponse rather than a prepared lesson (Chanock, 2002).\nResearch has shown that the pedagogic attributes of indi-\nvidual consultations (ICs) differ considerably from those of\nclassroom teaching. For example, the flexibility of ICs\nallows teachers to focus on each student's specific language\nand academic skill needs (Chanock, 2000). Consultations are\ntask driven, provide immediate formative feedback, and\nallow students to learn, query, and experiment without judg-\nment by their peers, often increasing their engagement in the\nwell as improving students' academic writing and linguistic\nskills, ICs may also positively influence the broader teaching\nprocesses within universities: Their informal and confiden-\ntial nature allows ALL advisors a more granular insight into\nstudents' academic and linguistic needs, which may (if dis-\nseminated) translate to a more targeted approach to class-\nThe focus of the current research is a free one-to-one\nEnglish language consultation resource established by\nGriffith University in 2007 to provide in-degree English lan-\nguage support to EAL students and to encourage indepen-\ndence in improving their English language skills. The service\nprovides weekly 45-min consultations on all five Griffith\nUniversity campuses and is accessed by several thousand\nstudents each semester with an exponential year-on-year\nincrease.According to an internal report on Griffith's English\nLanguage Enhancement Strategy (GELES; Griffith\nthe service. Yet satisfaction does not necessarily impact\nEnglish language proficiency, as we shall see.\nA primary issue for EAL students in Australia is the strug-\ngle to assimilate to Western academic writing conventions\n(Snow Andrade, 2006). Part of this is insufficient language\nproficiency (Coxhead & Byrd, 2007), but other issues have\nemerged as well. First, the educational backgrounds of many\nEAL students differ from the Australian tertiary education\ncontext. The issue is not necessarily one of ignorance: EAL\nstudents frequently have a generic grasp of English for aca-\ndemic purposes, but are erroneously conforming to known\nrules of good writing, which are not appropriate to the par-\nticular discipline (Pardoe, 2000). Second, students often\nencounter a lack of information about the writing, format-\nting,orreferencingrequirementsoftheirdiscipline(Chanock,\n2007). Unfortunately, support in this area may not be given\nby discipline academics (Murray, 2010), who tend to see it as\noutside their purview (Arkoudis & Starfield, 2007; Zhu,\n2004). Discipline academics also tend to provide summative\nrather than formative feedback, focusing on content not lin-\nguistic competence--hence the need for EAL students' aca-\ndemic writing skills to be honed through targeted individual\ninstruction with a non-threatening, knowledgeable partner\n(Chanock, 2000) to increase their likelihood of academic\nResearch Into Individual Consultation\nServices\nDespite the call for institutions to monitor the effectiveness\nof language support strategies such as ICs (Hirsh, 2007), this\narea has so far been under-explored, particularly in the\nAustralian context (Baik & Greig, 2009; Harryba, Guilfoyle,\nresearch done into the effectiveness of IC resources, begin-\nning with worldwide findings and then narrowing to the\nAustralian higher education context.\nWilliams (2004) explored the impact of ICs on the quality\nof second language writers'draft writing at a U.S. university,\nrecording and analyzing five advisor\u00adstudent interactions.\nBoth pre- and post-intervention texts were studied to deter-\nmine the extent of the revisions made by the writers after\nadvisor feedback. The holistic grades for pre- and post-\nintervention drafts were also compared to determine whether\nthe interventions had positive assessment outcomes.\nWilliams's (2004) study revealed that the interventions\nencouraged small-scale revisions of sentence-level problems\nbut systemic text-level problems were less likely to be\nrevised. Also, issues explicitly raised by the advisor were\nmore likely to be revised than those implicitly treated. In\naddition, student reaction to feedback was salient: Students\nwho wrote down advisors' comments about an issue were\nmore likely to revise the error than students who resisted or\nignored suggestions. Crucially, text revision did not always\nlead to higher assessment outcomes.\nIn the U.K. context, a quantitative investigation of a uni-\nversity's writing center was conducted by Yeats, Reddy,\nWheeler, Senior, and Murray (2010) to determine the impact\nof attendance at ICs with advanced peer tutors on students'\nachievement and academic progression. They compared the\nacademic records of 806 first-year students with their writing\ncenter attendance and found that regular writing center attend-\nees recorded significantly higher levels of achievement (mea-\nsured by recorded grades) than non-attendees. A higher\n(though not statistically significant) number of attendees pro-\ngressed to a more advanced course than non-attendees.\nNotably, this service suffered from poor uptake (only 45 of\nthe 806 participants attended the writing center), perhaps\nbecause it was staffed by peer tutors and not ALL specialists.\nIn Australia, Huijser, Kimmins, and Galligan (2008) eval-\nuated the perceived effectiveness of ICs in mathematics and\nacademic writing with 55 students over a 2-week period\nthrough student questionnaires and tutor logs. ICs were per-\nceived to have assisted the students to overcome inaccessible\nand troublesome cognitive schemata (\"stuck places\"), as\nwell as providing a non-threatening emotional environment\nfor risk taking and error recovery. However, Huijser et al.'s\n(2008) focus was limited to perceptions of the service rather\nWalkinshaw et al. 3\nthan presenting measurable outcomes of its effectiveness. In\nanother Australian study, Woodward-Kron (2007) analyzed a\nrecorded IC with an EAL graduate student to probe student\nlearning processes. She found that the interaction largely\ninvolved negotiation of surface-level errors, that is, linguistic\nforms and text organization. Content was also addressed to a\ncertain extent, despite a faculty academic's advice to \"fix the\ngrammar [but] don't touch the content\" (p. 255). Wilson\net al. (2011) carried out a similar study with a mature-age\ninternational student, concluding that ICs increased the stu-\ndent's confidence, command of discipline-specific language,\nuse of academic literacy metalanguage, and technical com-\npetencies such as structuring and paragraphing. These stud-\nies, despite their limited generalizability, illuminate some\ncore benefits of ICs. Again, however, they do not measure\noutcomes in terms of developing academic writing skills.\nChanock (2002) points out that evaluating the effective-\nness of ICs is a challenging task. First, ALL work is con-\nstructed and positioned differently in different universities\nand often sits outside their mainstream teaching evaluation\nprocesses. So ALL departments often need to design and\nimplement their own evaluation mechanisms, reducing\ncomparability between institutions. Also, assessing what\nstudents have learned and identifying how ALL instructors\ncontributed to that learning is challenging (Stevenson &\nKokkinn, 2009) because of all the other sources of language\ninput that second language (L2) learners are exposed to in a\ntarget culture.\nAlthough the studies above provide some insight into ICs\nas a source of linguistic and academic support for EAL stu-\ndents, empirical research is needed to quantitatively measure\nlinguistic development over time (Jun, Ramirez, & Cumming,\nresearch to date has largely focused on student satisfaction\n(Arkoudis & Starfield, 2007), rather than evaluating the link\nto long-term student learning. The current study takes an ini-\ntial step in addressing these issues by longitudinally examin-\ning some of the structural, lexical, and syntactic shifts in\nEAL students' academic writing and attempting to identify\nan association with attendance at ICs.\nThe preliminary and initiatory study outlined in this arti-\ncle recorded participants' attendance at ICs and analyzed\ntheir self-selected samples of academic writing pre- and\npost-intervention (a 9-month interval). The study investi-\ngated how students' academic writing ability might be influ-\nenced by participation in ICs, as measured via attendance.\nOur research questions were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: Does an association exist between\nEAL students' participation in ICs and shifts in their aca-\ndemic writing skills and lexico-grammatical competence?\nResearch Question 2: Is there a relationship between the\nextent of participants' utilization of this resource and the\ndegree of shift in academic writing skills and lexico-\ngrammatical competence?\nWe anticipated that there would be a relationship between\nstudent participation in ICs and shifts in writing ability and\nlexico-grammatical competence. Specifically, we hypothe-\nsized the following:\nHypothesis 1a: Students who attended ICs during the\nresearch period would increase their academic writing\nability and lexico-grammatical competence.\nHypothesis 1b: There would be no difference in develop-\nment across all four rating criteria for academic writing\nability (Task Fulfillment, Coherence and Cohesion,\nGrammar and Vocabulary).\nHypothesis 2: There would be a relationship between the\nnumber of ICs attended during the research period and\nincreases in academic writing ability and lexico-gram-\nmatical competence.\nData Collection Method and Its\nRationale\nThe effectiveness of the IC resource was measured through\nwritten text analysis to illuminate criterion indicators of lan-\nguage ability (Bachman, 1990). The two facets to the cur-\nrent analysis were (a) rating written texts according to\nestablished criteria to measure participants' academic writ-\ning skills and (b) identifying and quantifying specific lex-\nico-grammatical irregularities. The text types included in\nthe sample were reports and essays. All other text types\nwere rejected, as were texts which had been written collab-\noratively. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Griffith\nUniversity Office of Ethics.\nPre- and post-testing were carried out over a 9-month\nresearch period to identify longitudinal shifts in academic\nwriting proficiency and lexico-grammatical skills. The ana-\nlyzed texts were all grade-bearing, high-stakes assessment\nitems from the participants' discipline courses. The specified\nminimum length was 1,000 words. In longer texts, lexico-\ngrammatical irregularities were counted from only a 1,000-\nwordsectiontoensureoverallcomparabilitywhenquantifying\nerror density. Analysis was confined to the central portion of\nthese longer texts rather than the beginning or the end because\nperusal of pre-intervention texts suggested a lower density of\nerrors at the beginning of texts and higher density toward the\nend. Quantifying irregularities in these portions would there-\nfore be misrepresentative of the overall text. Note that this\nsystem applied only to the quantification of grammatical\nirregularities: Overall academic skill ratings were based on\nthe entire text irrespective of length.\nRating Academic Writing Sub-Skills\nTwo raters separately gave each writing sample a score out of\n20, that is, a score out of five for each of four criteria: Task\nFulfillment, Coherence and Cohesion, Grammar, and\nVocabulary. A simple product\u00admoment correlation between\n4 SAGE Open\nthe two raters' scores, determined to be an adequate measure\nof the level of agreement, was calculated as r = .89, p < .000,\nindicating a high level of agreement between raters. The four\nrating criteria were broadly based on the assessment criteria\nfor the IELTS Writing Task 2 (Task Response, Coherence and\nCohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and\nAccuracy; Shaw, 2002). Ratings for these four criteria were\ncalculated using a scale of English language proficiency based\non IELTS Writing Task 2 band descriptors, though employing\nfive assessment bands rather than the nine bands used in\nIELTS descriptors. The assessment bands were limited to five\nto simplify post-rating quantitative analysis, and also because\na higher number of bands produces significantly different rela-\ntive mean scores in some rating instruments (cf. Dawes, 2008).\nThe descriptor was analytical rather than holistic, requiring\nraters to focus judgments on specific writing features or skills.\nThis ensured reasonable agreement between raters such that a\nreliable score could be formulated from dual ratings of a text.\nIt also allowed particular areas of language ability to be pro-\nfiled, which was useful for the analysis of participants whose\nlanguage skills were developing at varying rates.\nThe Task Fulfillment criterion was based on (a) the depth\nof knowledge about the issue/s being discussed, and the\nquality and relevance of the ideas presented; (b) whether a\nclear and consistent argument was maintained throughout\nthe writing sample; and (c) whether academic conventions\n(e.g., referencing, citation) were followed appropriately. The\nCoherence and Cohesion criterion was based on (a) whether\nthe structure of the introduction and conclusion was appro-\npriate for an academic text; (b) whether each body paragraph\ncontained a clear topic sentence and one main idea; (c)\nwhether ideas were developed, supported, and logically\ngrouped in paragraphs; and (d) whether there was appropri-\nate use of cohesive devices. The Grammar criterion encom-\npassed (a) accurate and appropriate application of grammar,\ndensity of lexico-grammatical irregularities, and communi-\ncative effect; (b) whether there was a range of sentence struc-\ntures; and (c) appropriate punctuation. Finally, theVocabulary\ncriterion consisted of (a) conveyance of precise meaning and\ntone through choice of words; (b) the application of a range\nof appropriate vocabulary, including discipline-specific\nterms; and (c) accuracy of spelling.\nQuantifying Lexico-Grammatical Irregularities\nTo afford a more granular insight into participants' lexico-\ngrammatical development, a taxonomy of 10 frequently\noccurring lexico-grammatical irregularities was constructed:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Subject/verb agreement (The topic of gun control are\ncontroversial in the U.S.A.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Verb form (Australians enjoy to have democratic\nfreedom.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Tense (The assignment is submitted yesterday.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Word order (The exam one hour will be.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Wrong word used (The most of citizens are in favour\nof euthanasia rights.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Word form (Privately educate is expensive in most\ncountries.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Count/non-count nouns (There are too many informa-\ntions in this summary.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Plural/singular (There are three reason why smoking\nshould be banned.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Article (We have to take exam at the end of the\ncourse.)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Punctuation (india will host a united nations confer-\nence in july.)\nAlthough other lexico-grammatical irregularities occur in\nthe sample, the taxonomy was limited to those listed above\nas a broader analysis would have been outside the scope of\nthis research. Instances of the 10 irregularities were quanti-\nfied in each pre- and post-intervention written text. They\nwere identified by the first rater and then verified or elimi-\nnated by the second rater. After this calibration, pre\u00adpost\nresults were compared to illuminate shifts in the occurrence\nof each irregularity.\nParticipants\nThe research was carried out on a convenience sample of 31\nEAL students from a variety of nationalities and pathways of\nentry to the university. The two criteria for inclusion were (a)\nthat participants were EAL students in their first semester of\nstudy at the university, with an IELTS score of <7 or one or\nmore sub-scores (Reading, Writing, Speaking, or Listening)\nof <6.5, and (b) that they were currently enrolled in a com-\npulsory one-semester English language enhancement course\n(Fenton-Smith, Humphreys, Walkinshaw, Michael, & Lobo,\n2015) at the university.Although attendance and engagement\nin courses of this type tend to fluctuate (Lobo & Gurney,\n2013), the attendance pattern of the 31 participants in this\nstudy was relatively uniform: Their mean participation score\nfor their English language enhancement course (encompass-\ning attendance, engagement, and preparation) was 7.52 out\nindicating generally high attendance and engagement in the\ncourse. This means that in principle the participants were\nbeing exposed to a broadly similar amount of English lan-\nguage support at their institution, and we tentatively posit\nthat any additional shifts in their academic writing skills or\nlexico-grammatical competence were at least partly attribut-\nable to their attendance at ICs.\nWe should note here the issue of attrition. Despite having\n98 volunteers, only 31 usable written texts were received.\nThis issue is common in longitudinal studies of this type.\nCraven's (2012) study of EAL students' English language\nproficiency tested only 40 participants. O'Loughlin and\nArkoudis's (2009) study of EAL students at Australian uni-\nversities had a sample of 63. Humphreys et al.'s (2012) study\nWalkinshaw et al. 5\nyielded 51 participants. Fortunately the current sample (n =\n31) is sufficient for correlational research and to potentially\ndetermine an appropriate power level for this study, a sample\nsize calculation for the first research question (i.e., based\nupon the potential association between students' participa-\ntion in ICs and shifts in their academic writing ability and\nlexico-grammatical competence) was calculated as n = 18\n(Machin, Campbell, Fayers, & Pinol, 1997).\nProcedure for Data Collection and Analysis\nVolunteers were solicited through the distribution of flyers at\nEnglish language enhancement lectures. Anonymity was\nensured, reducing potential discrimination against non-par-\nticipants. Subsequently, writing samples were obtained from\nparticipants at two points: the beginning of semester 1\n(March) and the end of semester 2 (November). Participants'\nattendance at ICs was recorded during the data-collection\nperiod. Participants were advised that they could attend con-\nsultations as often or as rarely as they chose, and received no\nadditional compensation for attendance. The development of\nacademic writing skill and lexico-grammatical competence,\nand its tentative association with attendance at ICs, was mea-\nsured by comparing pre- and post-testing academic writing\nratings and the density of lexico-grammatical irregularities\nwith the number of ICs attended over the research period.\nResults\nThis section addresses the two research questions posed ear-\nlier, that is, whether an association exists between IC atten-\ndance and shifts in academic writing/lexico-grammatical\ncompetence, and whether there is a relationship between\nextent of IC utilization and degree of shift. Before addressing\nthese research questions, though, the first variable to consider\nis participant uptake of the resource, due to its impact on other\nfindings. Table 1 presents the number of participants in this\nstudy and their median level of attendance. The highest num-\nber of sessions attended was 20 (n = 1), and the lowest was 0\nBecause most participants only attended a small number\nof consultations, a measurable shift in any aspect of their\nacademic writing competence was not expected. These nor-\nmally occur over a much longer period; a 0.5 band improve-\nment in IELTS may require 4 to 6 months of contact\ninstruction (Birrell et al., 2006). In the present study, even\nten 45-min ICs would equate to only 7.5 hr of contact instruc-\ntion. Hence, rather than use statistical significance as the sole\nbenchmark for success, we illuminate positive patterns,\nwhich emerge after a limited period of IC attendance and\nwhich might predict future significant shifts in academic\nwriting competence.\nThe ratings for each of the four academic sub-skills of\nTask Fulfillment, Coherence and Cohesion, Grammar, and\nVocabulary are presented in Table 2. Table 2 offers mean val-\nues (as well as SD, range, and median) for the pre- and post-\ntesting ratings of each academic sub-skill as well as a total\nvalue (i.e., the sum of each sub-skill).\nAll four ratings declined from pre- to post-testing. The\n\"Discussion\" section will explore this finding in greater\ndetail.\nResults from the raters' identification of the 10 common\nlexico-grammatical irregularities are presented in Table 3.\nAgain, Table 3 offers mean values (as well as SD, range, and\nmedian) for the pre- and post-testing ratings of each of the 10\nirregularities.\nOf note, more variability between pre- and post-testing\nmeasures is evident in these data with six irregularity areas\nincreasing between pre- and post-testing (i.e., verb form,\ntense, word order, word form, count/non-count, and article)\nand four irregularity areas declining (i.e., subject/verb,\nwrong word, plural/singular, and punctuation). We will\nexpand on this pattern in the \"Discussion\" section.\nSample text ratings were balanced against participants'\nattendance at ICs to shed light on the two research questions.\nThe first research question asked whether an association\nexisted between EAL students'participation in ICs and shifts\nin academic writing ability/lexico-grammatical competence.\nTo investigate this question, the academic writing sub-skill\nratings of participants who attended at least one session (n =\n25) were compared. Because these data did not meet nor-\nmalcy assumptions for parametric analysis, the question of\nshift in writing ability and IC attendance was addressed with\na Wilcoxon signed-rank test--a test based on the differences\nbetween scores in the two conditions being compared. In this\ncase, participant ratings pre- and post-intervention were\ncompared. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test tests the null\nhypothesis that there would be no difference (i.e., improve-\nment) in the ratings of students' written samples between\npre- and post-testing. The differences in the academic sub-\nskills are computed as positive numbers. Data from the tabu-\nlated results were entered into PASW SPSS 18 (IBM SPSS,\n2010). No significant difference was found for participants\nwhose ratings in the four sub-skills increased after attending\nA Wilcoxon signed-rank test was also used to further\nanalyze each of the four academic sub-skills ratings in turn\nto test the null hypothesis that there would be no positive\nshift in the ratings of participants' written samples pre- and\npost-intervention. This time, using a Wilcoxon signed-rank\ntest with a Bonferroni correction for inflated type 1 error\nTable 1. Attendance at ICs Over the Research Period.\nNumber of participants Median attendance Range\n6 SAGE Open\nfor participants whose written sample showed a higher rat-\ning for Task Fulfillment (T = 8, p = .61, r = -.003), Coherence\nafter attending at least one consultation. With adjustments,\nno support was found for rejecting the null hypothesis.\nHowever, both Grammar and Vocabulary approached statis-\ntical significance with reasonable effect sizes, suggesting an\nassociation--though no definite statistical link at this\nstage--between attendance at ICs and shifts in these two\nsub-skills.We will expand on this finding in the \"Discussion\"\nsection.\nIn addition, Spearman's rho was used to measure the\nstrength of the relationship between attendance at ICs and\nshifts in sub-skill ratings pre- and post-intervention, again\nwith a Bonferroni correction (i.e., p < .01). The findings are\npresented in Table 4. In all, no significant increasing or\ndecreasing relationships were uncovered between any of\nthese paired variables.\nLack of statistical significance notwithstanding, some\npotentially interesting patterns emerged. The majority of the\nrelationships were positive and offered some evidence that the\nmore consultations participants attended, the more their aca-\ndemic writing sub-skill ratings improved. The pattern is not\nparticularly strong except in the Grammar sub-skill, but may\npredict a positive shift in written language proficiency given\ncontinued use of this resource over a sustained period of time.\nThe \"Discussion\" section will further unpack this finding.\nThe second research question investigated the relation-\nship between the utilization of ICs and the degree of shift in\nacademic writing skills/lexico-grammatical competence. To\naddress this, we again employed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test\nto explore each of the common irregularities in turn. The null\nhypothesis was that there would be no increase or decline in\nthe number of grammatical irregularities in participants'\nwritten samples pre- and post-intervention. A Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test with a Bonferroni correction for inflated\ntype 1 error revealed no significant difference after attending\nat least one consultation for the following irregularities: sub-\ntion (T = 11, p = .66, r = -.06). Instances of three irregularity\ntypes increased post-intervention: verb form (T = 6, p = .04,\nform (T = 8, p = .09, r = -.24), and would actually be signifi-\ncant but for the post hoc adjustment to alpha. Again, no sup-\nport was found for rejecting the null hypothesis for any of\nthese tests in a direction that indicated improvement.\nTable 3.

Before doing so,\nthough, we need to reiterate that there was only a small\ndegree of shift in language proficiency over 9 months, partly\nbecause of participants' relatively low uptake of the service.\nIndeed, the low uptake is an important finding in itself:\nAlthough several thousand IC sessions are conducted at\nGriffith University each semester, each individual normally\nonly attends a few sessions. Given the considerable time-on-\ntask normally required to demonstrably increase language\nproficiency, it is unsurprising that only a limited shift\noccurred during the research period. That said, several posi-\ntive patterns emerged in the data, potentially pointing to a\nmore notable shift in linguistic competence after a longer\ninvestigation period and with sustained participant utiliza-\ntion of the service. We will examine the patterns here.\nPattern 1: Irregularity Areas Declined at Post-Test\nFour lexico-grammatical items that participants frequently\nused erroneously in the initial phase were less evident at\npost-test: subject/verb, wrong word, plural/singular, and\npunctuation (Table 3). Interestingly, these items all require\nlittle or no morphological modification (e.g., changing a verb\nform) to produce an appropriate variant. Conversely, several\nof the six irregularity areas that increased in frequency over\nthe research period did call for morphological modification:\nverb form, word form, and tense. Given the number of vari-\nables in play in second language acquisition, it would be sim-\nplistic to argue that the items which participants did not need\nto modify morphologically were more easily processed and\nused than those they did. At this early stage, we merely spec-\nulate that less cognitive processing was required for one than\ning and appropriate production of the item. Future research\nwill investigate this phenomenon in more detail.\nPattern 2: Sub-Skill Ratings Approached\nSignificance Pre- and Post-Intervention\nTwo sub-skill ratings--Grammar and Vocabulary--\napproached statistical significance between pre- and post-\ntesting, tentatively implying that a perceptible shift in\nlexico-grammatical competence took place over the research\nperiod. This encouraging result may reflect the greater focus\nof ICs on lexico-grammar than on other academic skills\nlexico-grammatical intake. Other variables in play include\nthe targeted nature of IC services, their individual focus, and\nthe provision of immediate feedback on learner output\n(Atwood, Turnbull, & Carpendale, 2010). Though not excep-\ntional, this finding could foreshadow an eventual statistically\nsignificant shift in lexico-grammatical competence among\nthe sample.\nPattern 3: Positive Association Between IC\nAttendance and Sub-Skill Rating Shifts\nThe third positive pattern comes from analysis of the rela-\ntionship between the extent of attendance at ICs and shifts in\nsub-skill ratings (Table 4). None of the ratings approached\nstatistical significance, yet all except Coherence and\nCohesion shifted in a positive direction--particularly\nGrammar, which as we mentioned before is a frequent focus\nof IC sessions (Freeman, 2011). While a positive result for\nonly one sub-skill could be dismissed as a random occur-\nrence, the apparently similar positive shift in three of the four\nsub-skill ratings indicates a possible association between\nextent of attendance at ICs and shifts in sub-skills. Given that\nthese shifts occurred despite limited attendance at ICs, it is\nreasonable to speculate that more pronounced shifts might be\ndiscernable after sustained attendance over a longer time\nframe.\nConcluding Remarks\nIn Australia's results-focused higher education sector\n(Stevenson & Kokkinn, 2009), it would be desirable to\ndemonstrate that IC services measurably affect EAL stu-\ndents' academic writing skills. The current research con-\ntributes by identifying a likely association between EAL\nstudents' attendance at ICs and gains in their academic\nwriting skills and lexico-grammatical competence. While\nattending a small number of consultations makes only lim-\nited difference to an EAL student's writing ability, there are\npredictors that regular attendance over a sustained period\nwill reap benefits.\nAs we mentioned earlier, this is an initiatory study,\nintended more to guide future enquiry than to propose robust\nfindings itself. In future, longitudinal research may investi-\ngate what degree of positive shift is most likely to occur over\ntime, and in which particular aspects of academic writing. To\ncompensate for our necessarily brief and incomplete taxon-\nomy of lexico-grammatical irregularities, we also propose\nthat future research explore the potential effect of ICs on\nother such lexico-grammatical irregularities in EAL stu-\ndents' academic writing. In the meantime, we can report that\neven if the EAL students in this study have not yet advanced\nvery far, the preliminary data indicate that they have taken\ninitial steps in the right direction.\n"
