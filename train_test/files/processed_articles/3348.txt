    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground/aims: The Food and Drug Administration's final rule on investigational new drug application safety report-\ning, effective from 28 March 2011, clarified the reporting requirements for serious and unexpected suspected adverse\nreactions occurring in clinical trials. The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative released recommendations in 2013 to\nassist implementation of the final rule; however, anecdotal reports and data from a Food and Drug Administration audit\nindicated that a majority of reports being submitted were still uninformative and did not result in actionable changes.\nClinical Trials Transformation Initiative investigated remaining barriers and potential solutions to full implementation of\nthe final rule by polling and interviewing investigators, clinical research staff, and sponsors.\nMethods: In an opinion-gathering effort, two discrete online surveys designed to assess challenges and motivations\nrelated to management of expedited (7- to 15-day) investigational new drug safety reporting processes in oncology trials\nwere developed and distributed to two populations: investigators/clinical research staff and sponsors. Data were col-\nlected for approximately 1 year. Twenty-hour-long interviews were also conducted with Clinical Trials Transformation\nInitiative\u00adnominated interview participants who were considered as having extensive knowledge of and experience with\nthe topic. Interviewees included 13 principal investigators/study managers/research team members and 7 directors/vice\npresidents of pharmacovigilance operations from 5 large global pharmaceutical companies.\nResults: The investigative site's responses indicate that too many individual reports are still being submitted, which are\ntime-consuming to process and provide little value for patient safety assessments or for informing actionable changes.\nFewer but higher quality reports would be more useful, and the investigator and staff would benefit from sponsors'``filter-\ning'' of reports and increased sponsor communication. Sponsors replied that their greatest challenges include (1) lack of\nglobal harmonization in reporting rules, (2) determining causality, and (3) fear of regulatory repercussions. Interaction\nwith the Food and Drug Administration has helped improve sponsors' adherence to the final rule, and sponsors would\nbenefit from increased communication with the Food and Drug Administration and educational materials.\nConclusion: The goal of the final rule is to minimize uninformative safety reports so that important safety signals can\nbe captured and communicated early enough in a clinical program to make changes that help ensure patient safety.\nInvestigative staff and sponsors acknowledge that the rule has not been fully implemented although they agree with the\nintention. Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative will use the results from the surveys and interviews to develop new\nrecommendations and educational materials that will be available to sponsors to increase compliance with the final rule\nand facilitate discussion between sponsors, investigators, and Food and Drug Administration representatives.\n1The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS, USA\n2US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA\n3Hood River, OR, USA\n4Pfizer Inc., New York City, NY, USA\n5Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA\n6Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative, Durham, NC, USA\nCorresponding author:\nEmail: ctti@mc.duke.edu\n",

FDA audit data of oncology trials has\nindicated no change in report volume, despite FDA\nguidance and CTTI recommendations, as illustrated in\nJarow et al.:6\n... in a random audit of expedited safety reports, only 14%\n(22/160) met the criteria of serious, unexpected, suspected\nadverse reactions with the remainder not providing any\nuseful information for understanding the safety profile of\nthe investigational drug.\nThe second project (``IND Safety Advancement'')4\nfocused specifically on safety reporting in oncology\ntrials to determine barriers to and identify solutions for\ncompliance with the final rule. The IND Safety\nAdvancement Project aimed to identify (1) sponsor\nchallenges to full implementation and motivation to\nchange practice in order to fully comply with the final\nrule and (2) challenges to investigator receipt and\nmanagement of safety reports. The goal of this study\nwas to gather evidence in order to characterize these\nchallenges. The results described herein will be used to\ndevelop resources to support sponsors and investiga-\ntors in creating the most efficient, informative, and\nhigh-quality safety reporting system possible.\nMethods\nOncology trials were the focus of investigation because\nof the magnitude of issues with safety reporting in this\ntherapeutic area.6 In this article, ``safety reports'' refer\nto expedited (7- to 15-day) IND safety reports that are\nsubmitted to the FDA and clinical trial investigators.\nSafety terminology is provided in Table 1.\nSurveys\nThe project conducted two online surveys to assess\nchallenges and motivations related to management of\nIND safety reporting processes; they were intended to\ngather opinions rather than provide quantitative con-\nclusions. One survey targeted clinical trial sponsors,\nand one survey targeted investigative staff conducting\noncology clinical trials. CTTI members and contacts\nidentified by the project team were invited to partici-\npate. Investigators' responses were pooled and reported\nseparately from the pooled results of ``other trial staff.''\nSurvey recipients were able to freely forward it to oth-\ners; therefore, no data are available describing the num-\nber of potential respondents who had access to\ncomplete the survey. The complete surveys for investi-\ngators and sponsors are available in the online supple-\nmentary material.\nSurvey questions were created and reviewed by mem-\nbers of the CTTI IND Safety Advancement Project\nTeam (see section ``"
