This way of thinking about\nchildren and childhood has been significant in disrupting\ndominant frameworks of developmental psychology and\nsocialization, to instead conceptualize children as \"being\"\n(rather than \"becoming\") and social actors in their own right.\nWhile diversity is mentioned, attention to the specific impli-\ncations of factors such as gender is largely absent from the\nsociology of childhood. Ferreira (2004) argues that in the\nprocess of socially defining childhood, sociologists removed\nall the heterogeneity of children, ignoring other factors such\nas gender, ethnicity, and social class. Relatedly, Eriksson\n(2007) argues that, \"[e]ven though gender has been a central\ndimension for some of the key researchers in the field . . . so\nfar childhood scholars in general cannot be said to engage\ndeeply with gender studies\" (p. 62).\nGenerally, when gender is mentioned in the sociology of\nchildhood, it tends to be fleeting, in binary terms, and/or is\nnot discussed in relation to feminist gender theories. In this\nsense, gender is often reduced to a list of differences between\nboys and girls with no further exploration of how these dif-\nferences are constructed or what they mean to children.\nTherefore, what is actually missing is a critical standpoint\nthat accounts for the social construction of gender and the\ninfluence of gender relations and hierarchies among\nchildren.\nThere appears to be little dialogue between the sociology\nof childhood and feminist studies.2 Recent works by key\nwriters in the field of the sociology of childhood, such as\nand encouraged the interdisciplinarity of studies of children\nand childhood, mentioning diverse fields of thought: sociol-\nogy, social anthropology, psychology, history, geography,\nphilosophy, economics, ethics, medicine, social policy, law,\npedagogy, art, and literature. However, there is no specific\nmention of feminist studies as a current or potentially useful\ncontributor to understandings about children and childhood.\nParallels between the sociology of childhood and feminist\nstudies, such as listening to previously unheard voices in\nresearch, and the ways in which childhood studies can learn\nfrom feminist studies, have been noted, including by Alanen\nies, children have historically been ignored or not included\n1Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia\n2National Institute for Educational Studies and Research, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil\nCorresponding Author:\nClare Bartholomaeus, School of Social and Policy Studies, Flinders\nEmail: clare.bartholomaeus@flinders.edu.au\nAccounting for Gender in the Sociology of\nChildhood: Reflections From Research in\nAustralia and Brazil\nClare Bartholomaeus1 and Adriano Souza Senkevics2\n Keywords\nfeminism, gender, children, sociology of childhood, age, qualitative research, education\n2 SAGE Open\nRosemberg, 2001). This absence likely related to the desire\nto break the link between women and children, where women\nand children were viewed as having the same interests and a\n\"natural\" connection, and as women tried to separate them-\nselves from maternal responsibilities (Burman & Stacey,\n2010). Important early feminist thinking about gender and\nWalkerdine (1990). Since then, there have been an increasing\nnumber of studies with children examining gender from fem-\ninist perspectives, although it is worthwhile noting that this\nwork has been published far more often in education journals\nrather than feminist studies or childhood journals. Despite\nthe growth of research about gender and children, many\nstudies do not specifically consider the implications of\n(socially constructed) age for gender.\nIn this article, we argue that a consideration of gender\ndrawing on feminist theorizing has much to offer the sociol-\nogy of childhood. We draw on our own studies, in Australia\nand Brazil, to provide ways of examining gender and age\ntogether and to show how gender is relevant in children's\nlives. We focus our discussion on two topics--play and\nsport--which are often discussed in studies with children\nand relate to our research. Importantly, we situate our\nresearch in the contexts in which it was conducted. In some\nways, both countries can be viewed as belonging to the\n\"global South,\" although Australia also has strong connec-\ntions to the \"global North\" (for an in-depth discussion of\ntheorizing in relation to the South, see Connell, 2007).\nImportantly, we are writing from outside the places where\nthe (new) sociology of childhood has been developed and is\nthe strongest, such as in the Nordic countries, the United\nStates, and the United Kingdom. In Australia, children are\nlargely absent from sociology and the national body The\nAustralian Sociological Association (TASA) does not have a\nthematic group dedicated to childhood (for an overview of\nchildren and sociology in Australia, see van Krieken, 2010).\nDiscussions about children and childhood, including in terms\nof gender, tend to be concentrated in education, where there\nis a large body of work advocating for feminist-informed\nteaching and education (for an overview discussion of femi-\nnism and education in Australia, see Yates, 2008). Children\nare also not a focus of sociology in Brazil. While there are\nsome attempts to consolidate a sociology of childhood in\nBrazil (see Faria & Finco, 2011), as in Australia, most of the\nresearch in this regard is undertaken in the education field\n(Castro & Kosminsky, 2010). At the same time, gender has\nnot been a priority in childhood studies, where it is almost\nabsent in the so-called foundational texts such as Quinteiro\nAbsences of Gender in the Sociology of\nChildhood\nIn our research conducted in two distinct countries, we\nnoticed independently that gender was largely absent from\nthe sociology of childhood. This is a widespread occurrence\nin many countries. In a recent special issue of Current\nSociology, childhood sociology was mapped in 10 different\ncountries with an article on each country (Australia, Brazil,\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, France,\nGermany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Romania). Overall,\nthere is little consideration of gender in these overview arti-\ncles, and only two mention specific research about children\nand gender (in the United States and Finland, respectively;\nThere are surprisingly few critiques of the relative absence\nof gender in the sociology of childhood. An exception is\nHaavind (2005) who, in a review of several key sociology of\nchildhood books, notes that \"[h]ere and there particular\nchapters hint at observations of gender differences, but this\ntends to be laid out as a descriptive fact without further\nreflection on or interpretation of what it means\" (p. 150; see\nalso Eriksson, 2007). The lack of attention to gender may\nrelate to the fact that the sociology of childhood is dominated\nby a small number of influential texts, writers, and concepts\nthat, as B\u00fchler-Niederberger (2010) argues, \"produces a\nglobal scientific influence which initiates and shapes child-\nhood sociological research\" (p. 376). The centrality of age\nand generation in these writings is also likely to be a factor.\nIn addition, this absence may also relate to the little consid-\neration of children in their own right in feminist studies\nbroadly, as mentioned above. Although we do not expect\ngender to be a key focus of all sociology of childhood\nsources, the scarce mention of gender, and the lack of in-\ndepth theorizing is surprising. In this section, we provide a\nbrief overview of what has been written about gender in the\nsociology of childhood, focusing on several key writers and\ntexts in the field.\nIn the sociology of childhood, gender appears to be dis-\ncussed most when bodies and/or play are the focus of analy-\nsis. For example, Prout's (2000) edited book The Body,\nChildhood and Society mentions gender more than other key\ncollections in the sociology of childhood. Gender is dis-\ncussed to some degree in four of the nine chapters. Most\nnotably, Prendergast (2000) draws on feminist theories about\nbodies, including the work of Grosz and Gilligan, to discuss\ngirls' growing bodies, focusing on their early knowledge\nabout and experiences of menstruation.\nA notable writer in the sociology of childhood, Corsaro,\noccasionally includes some reference to gender in his work\non play, peer culture, and interactions. Although Corsaro\n(2014) references some key feminist thinkers such as Thorne,\nWalkerdine, Davies, and Connell, his approach often stresses\ngender differences in terms of distinct peer cultures, as can\nbe seen in his international study comparing the United\nStates and Italy (Aydt & Corsaro, 2003). Moreover, he\nfocuses on differences between boys' and girls' interactions,\nrather than considering the constructions behind \"being\" a\nboy or a girl or the power relations between genders.\nEven though gender is sometimes mentioned in the soci-\nology of childhood, it is largely under-theorized. A key text\nBartholomaeus and Senkevics 3\nTheorizing Childhood (James, Jenks, & Prout, 1998) includes\nsome discussion of gender and research about gender and\nchildhood, particularly in relation to the work of Thorne.\nHowever, for the most part, the authors are less interested in\nthe gender content and theories in these works and instead\ntend to focus on the contributions to thinking about child-\nhood broadly. The entry for \"Gender\" in Key Concepts in\nChildhood Studies outlines that \"gender is a critical compo-\nnent of childhood's diversity\" (James & James, 2012, p. 61),\nwhere it is one aspect of children's social identity that needs\nto be considered in relation to age, ethnicity, and class (i.e.,\nbroader social structures) in the context of their culture and\nsociety. However, although James and James draw on some\nfeminist research, engagement with feminist gender theories\nis notably absent. Thus, gender is occasionally mentioned in\ndiscussions of diversity, but without being expanded on.\nAnother example is James and Prout (1997) who acknowl-\nedge \"the danger that in collectivizing children into `child-\nhood' significant differences (of gender, class, ethnicity,\ndisability etc.) between children are underplayed\" (p. xiii).\nHowever, in these accounts, ultimately age is viewed as more\nimportant than other differences.\nThe view that generation and age are the most important\ncategories to examine, at the expense of all other intersec-\ntions, is most clear in the work of Qvortrup (see, for exam-\nas problematic because they assume similarity among chil-\ndren based on particular categories:\n[t]here is of course nothing wrong in studying gender or class or\nrace issues among children, but one has to be aware that such\nchoices are by the same token not addressing generational\nquestions, i.e. they may be unwarrantedly assuming similarities\nimportant point when he observed that \"in a sense white and\nNegro children have more in common with each other than with\nThus, Qvortrup privileges age over any other category,\ndownplaying, for example, shared experiences by children\nand adults, including in terms of structural inequality.\nAlthough many writers in the sociology of childhood view\nage and generation as the most important category of analy-\nsis when studying children, Qvortrup is explicit in his rejec-\ntion of the need to consider other categories. Indeed, he\nviews them as a threat to the perspective of childhood as a\nstructural element present in every society (Qvortrup, 2010).\nThe attention to diversity and multiple social structures\nthat Qvortrup so fears is what interests us most. We view age\nas a significant category in children's lives but not the only\ncategory and not the most important category in every con-\ntext. Even though our focus in this article is on the insufficient\nattention paid to gender in the sociology of childhood, we\nacknowledge that this is part of a larger lack of consideration\nof how age intersects with other forms of diversity too,\nsuch as ethnicity, race, sexuality, class, and so on. Rather than\nconsidering these as separate categories that can be \"added\nin,\" we view them as intersecting, and creating contextually\nspecific experiences for children. The rest of the article\nfocuses on feminist-informed research about gender and chil-\ndren, including our own, showing how these studies contrib-\nute to thinking about the interweaving of gender and age.\nResearch About Gender and Children\nThere is now an increasing amount of feminist-informed\nresearch about gender and children that sits largely apart\nfrom the sociology of childhood. Broadly, this research\nexamines gender as a social construction. It has been influ-\nby post-structuralist theories. Connell's theories about the\n\"gender order\" and gender hierarchies, particularly in terms\nof multiple and hierarchical forms of masculinities (see, for\nexamining gender relations and patterns among children (as\nwell as teenagers and adults). Her concept of hegemonic\nmasculinity, which denotes the most culturally exalted form\nand produces complicity and upholds the \"gender order,\" has\nbeen frequently used in discussions of young masculinities.\nFeminist post-structuralist accounts of gender are often used\nin combination with Connell's theories in research about\ngender and children. Post-structuralist approaches, such as\nthe work of Foucault and Butler, emphasize the fluidity of\nsubjects and view power as produced through discourse.\nAlthough there is diversity among writers drawing on these\ntheories for research about gender and children, Connell's\ngender theories and feminist post-structuralist approaches\nhave been most frequently drawn on and therefore appear\nuseful for theorizing gender in the sociology of childhood.\nIn this section, we draw on our own research in Brazil and\nAustralia, focusing on the ways in which we use gender theo-\nries in our research, and highlighting the contributions they\nmake to understanding gender and age. Although we are\naware of the difficulties of discussing two different studies\ntogether, we believe that they are useful to explore how socio-\nlogical studies of gender among children can be undertaken in\ndifferent countries. To focus the scope of this article, we offer\na consideration of two topics: play and sport. Play is a topic\nthat has received much attention in work about childhood and\nsport is a key theme discussed in studies about masculinities\nand boys. To provide a context for our own research, we start\nboth sections with a brief discussion of some of the existing\nexamples of research studies that have considered the inter-\nweaving of gender and age in childhood.\nFeminist Research About Play, Gender, and\nChildren\nPlay in its various forms is often a focus of research with\nchildren and, therefore, is an important topic to examine in\nterms of what has been written about gender. Research about\n4 SAGE Open\nplay, children, and gender has been influenced by and built\non feminist-informed gender theories, including the view\nthat gender is fluid and contextual, that ideas about gender\ncan influence and restrict children's play, and that there are\npower relations between and within genders.\nHow gender, play, and children are conceptualized has\nbeen greatly influenced by Thorne's (1993) foundational\nbook Gender Play, which draws on ethnographic research in\ninfluenced by postmodern feminist theory (specifically Flax,\nThorne demonstrates that play can be fun but it is not triv-\nial--it is important to understanding gender constructions\namong children. Thorne (1993) developed the influential\nconcept of \"borderwork\" to examine \"interaction across--\nyet interaction based on and even strengthening--gender\nboundaries\" (p. 64). She examines the different kinds of bor-\nderwork that take place in elementary schools--contests\nbetween boys and girls, chasing/kiss chasing, and ideas of\ngender pollution--showing how these work to strengthen\nnotions of \"boys\" and \"girls\" as opposites. Thorne shows\nthat both age and gender are important in the lives of children\nat school, along with other factors (such as class and ethnic-\nity), and that context is central to the significance of gender\nand age.\nDavies also offers a sophisticated consideration of the\nintersection of gender and age. Her work has some similari-\nties to Thorne's in that she draws both on Connell and post-\nstructuralism and moves away from understanding gender as\na binary, although Davies offers a more thorough-going post-\npreschool children in Australia, documented in Frogs and\nSnails and Feminist Tales, shows how gender affected chil-\ndren's lives in a number of ways, from how they could play\nin the \"home corner\" to awareness of male power to the way\nin which dress-up clothes were viewed by children as infused\nwith multiple meanings and possibilities. She draws on the\nconcepts of the \"male\u00adfemale binary\" and \"category-mainte-\nnance work,\" arguing that \"category-maintenance work\"\noccurs around gender boundaries where \"deviants\" are\npoliced and gender categories are maintained regardless of\npost-structuralist account of theorizing gender means that\nshe views gender as an ongoing construction, never fixed\nand never unitary, where individuals are positioned in differ-\nent ways in different contexts.\nFerreira (2004) offers an example from a Portuguese con-\ntext in her book A gente gosta \u00e9 de brincar com os outros\nmeninos (We like to play with the other boys), which draws\non an ethnography in a public kindergarten with 3- to 6-year-\nold children. Drawing particularly on Scott's post-structural-\nist approach to gender, Thorne's ethnography, and Connell's\nconceptualization of masculinities, Ferreira pays careful\nattention to how gender is actively reproduced and/or trans-\nformed by children throughout their play and interactions.\nShe argues that children negotiate plural, unstable, and contra-\ndictory \"gender identities,\" and thus no child simply embodies\na coherent model of being a boy or a girl. Paying attention to\nchildren's participation in this process, the author adopts the\nnotion of \"dealing with\" a certain \"model,\" \"ideal\" or \"dis-\ncourse.\" In addition, Ferreira (2004) acknowledges the coexis-\ntence of multiple masculinities and femininities as well as\n\"their ludic and/or strategic usage by the same actor, according\nto the circumstances\" (p. 358; authors' translation).\nMuch of the research about gender and play is undertaken\nin education settings, which are seen as important places for\nthe construction of childhood. However, many other places\nare relevant sites where children construct gender as they\nplay, learn, and interact, such as their local neighborhoods.\nWith this in mind, the second author's research in Brazil pro-\nvides an example of how play, access to neighborhood\nspaces, and domestic work intersect and relate to gender.\nPlaying Outdoors, Working Indoors: A\nConsideration From Brazil\nConducted in Brazil, the second author's research draws on a\nqualitative study examining gendered family practices\namong children from working-class backgrounds in S\u00e3o\nPaulo city. The data were collected at one public school,\nwhere children gave their viewpoints about their school, par-\nents, siblings, and home. These results were useful to under-\nstanding how gender affects children's schooling\nachievements considering, as a starting point, that girls over-\nall have better outcomes than boys in education in Brazil\ning of the research was the leisure\u00adhousework balance,\nwhere the possibility to play on the street compared with the\nconstraints of working at home was experienced differently\ndepending on the gender of the children.\nThe research was undertaken in 2012, in a co-educational\npublic school with students from urban working-class com-\nmunities (in this context, children came from families who\nworked in low-level and often informal jobs). One Year 3\nclass participated in the research, involving 25 students who\ninteracted with the researcher around twice a week for one\nsemester. After a couple of weeks informally talking and\nplaying with the students, six individual and seven paired\ninterviews were conducted with 20 children (12 girls and 8\nboys), aged mostly 8 or 9 years. During the interviews, chil-\ndren were asked about their routines at home and the range of\nactivities they engaged in once they left school in the after-\nnoon. Connell's (2005) concept of masculinities and her\nemphasis on social practices were adopted to examine what\nchildren did in their daily routines, how these activities\nrelated to gender, and the potential effects of these on the\nschooling process among girls and boys.\nA sharp difference in the leisure time, range of play activi-\nties, and access to the street was found between boys and\ngirls (as also found by Fiaes, Marques, Cotrim, & Bichara,\nBartholomaeus and Senkevics 5\nWhile the street was a site that boys could often access, meet\nfriends, and have fun through the practice of play and sports,\nrisks concerning the public space were often pointed out by\ngirls. Fear of being kidnapped, meeting drunk people, or\neven catching influenza were evoked to compose a list of\ndangers that were expressed by girls and could be seen as\nencouraged by gendered parental concerns that related to dis-\ntinct rules and expectations among their offspring. None of\nthe girls felt that they were free to play on the street as much\nas they wanted. The public space itself was perceived as dan-\ngerous for girls, while for a lot of boys those risks did not\nappear to be a limit in their daily routines, even though they\nlived in the same communities as their female classmates.\nThus, masculinities were constructed taking as a reference\npoint the public space and the range of games and activities\nthat boys could play after the school. Playing on the street\ngains a special importance in working-class children's lives\nin Brazil because leisure opportunities are scarce. No public\ngardens or parks characterize low-income communities in\nS\u00e3o Paulo, nor do these houses have yards to play in. Without\nentering the public space, there remain only the small spaces\nof houses to play in, where children undertook activities such\nas playing with dolls, watching television, playing video-\ngames, or using the computer. That is why having access to\nthe outdoors (playing football on the street, having fun on the\nsidewalks, or interacting in any empty land) is so relevant for\nchildren who were allowed to dedicate part of the day to play\nthere.\nAlongside perceptions of risk, girls' participation in\nhousework diminished their access to leisure time, and to\nplay on the streets and elsewhere (see also, for example,\nValentine, 2004). This process may have influenced the con-\nstruction of femininities defined by responsibilities and dis-\ncipline that were rare features among their brothers and male\nclassmates who spent most of the day playing. This fed back\ninto the school success among girls that, according to\nCarvalho, Senkevics, and Loges (2014), seems to rise from\nwithin the practices that constrained girls' access to leisure\nand sociability. In other words, girls' limitations to playing\nmeant that they spent more time on school work, had more of\nan interest in going daily to school, and had a more positive\nrelationship with this institution than boys.\nIn addition, two contradictory processes were evident in\nchildren's interviews. On one hand, girls were critical of\ntheir brothers'low level of engagement in housework, report-\ning situations when boys had more opportunities to play in or\noutside the house. Such inequality was not readily accepted\nand, though girls continued to do housework, they also criti-\ncized boys' benefits. On the other hand, participating in the\ngendered division of domestic work was in a certain way\nnaturalized among girls. For most girls, doing housework\nwas not a kind of \"help\" or \"contribution,\" but a responsibil-\nity and a duty. The sharing of responsibilities was implied\namong sisters, which did not occur between sisters and\nbrothers. Moreover, only one boy was really engaged in\ndomestic work. Interestingly, this boy had few leisure oppor-\ntunities, no siblings of a similar age to play with, and almost\nno access to public space.\nThis research suggests that, even within the same family,\nchildren may experience distinct childhoods due to gendered\nexpectations, according to which housework is part of a gen-\ndered routine that mostly relies on girls'engagement. In con-\ntrast, having the whole day to play, especially outside home,\nis a male privilege.\nFeminist Research About Sport, Gender, and\nChildren\nCommonly viewed as a form of play, sport is often a key\nfocus of feminist-informed research about boys and mascu-\nlinities in primary school, especially in Anglophone coun-\ntries. Sport tends to be written about in terms of school\nsettings rather than early childhood settings, highlighting the\nimportance of age and context. Studies with primary school\nframework of a hierarchy of multiple masculinities, particu-\nlarly her concept of hegemonic masculinity (see, for exam-\noften examine sport in relation to privileged and hierarchical\nmasculinities as well as hierarchical relations between mas-\nculinities and femininities.\nThe role of peer group settings is particularly important\nfor boys' constructions and understandings of masculinities,\nincluding in relation to sport. Keddie's (2003) research with\nfive male friends aged 6 to 8 years in an Australian primary\nschool shows the importance of gender in the lives of these\nboys by examining their investments in (Australian Rules)\nfootball and how this links to gendered, heterosexist, and\nhomophobic understandings of masculinity (drawing on the\nwork of Connell, among others). Keddie draws on feminist\npost-structuralist theorizing, particularly the work of Davies,\nto examine dominant understandings of gender. She uses\npost-structuralist theorizing to be able to examine how social\npower was exercised and to reconsider \"dominant and domi-\nnating ways of being\" (Keddie, 2003, p. 75). In addition, by\nclosely examining small-group peer culture, Keddie's\nresearch illuminates how gender was collectively constructed\nand understood, including the discrepancies and challenges\nto dominant understandings of masculinity.\nSport has also been examined in terms of the ways in\nwhich gender interweaves with race and class in childhood.\nBhana (2008) analyzes the significance of sport among 8-\nand 9-year-old boys in two distinct primary schools in South\nAfrica. She discusses the multiple hierarchies at work, where\nsport was key to the privileging of some boys over \"weaker\"\nboys and girls. In addition, some sports were viewed as more\n\"masculine\" than others, which was notably contested among\nthe White and Black boys. Bhana utilizes Connell's concept\nof hegemonic masculinity to examine gender hierarchies in\n6 SAGE Open\nher research, which she analyzes particularly in relation to\nrace and class. She considers boys' understandings and con-\nstructions of masculinities and sport as being influenced by\nthe contexts of the schools, the areas in which the students\nlived, and broader aspects in South Africa, such as the his-\ntory of rugby and middle-class White men, and soccer and\nworking-class Black men.\nResearch has found that despite their young age, boys\n(and girls) draw on broader discourses about gender and\nsport, including those in the media and professional sport\n(see also, for example, Keddie, 2003), to construct mascu-\nlinities in particular ways and create gender hierarchies.\nEven though boys do not have access to these adult mascu-\nlinities, they can still act them out in some ways. Bhana\n(2008) notes that regardless of the physical bodies of boys, it\nis important to recognize that strong, sporting adult bodies\nhelp shape discourses around gender for boys. Lodge (2005)\nsimilarly argues that \"[e]ngagement in football and aptitude\nin the game allows young boys to participate in a game that\nis also a high status adult male activity\" (p. 184). The inter-\nsection of gender and age in terms of sport is discussed in\nmore depth below in relation to the first author's research in\nAustralia.\nSport and Gender Hierarchies: A Consideration\nFrom Australia\nThe first author's research examined constructions and\nunderstandings of gender in two Australian primary schools.\nThe research focused on the intersection between gender and\nage, and considered the usefulness of implicitly adult gender\ntheories, particularly those about masculinities, to under-\nstand gender among primary school-age students. A key\nfinding of the research was the importance of sport in con-\nstructing a privileged masculinity among boys, as well as\nupholding a distinction between boys and girls, where boys\nwere viewed as superior to girls (for an earlier discussion,\nsee Bartholomaeus, 2011). This research and the previous\nstudies discussed above demonstrate the complex gender and\nage dimensions of sport in childhood, where sport is more\nthan a social or fitness activity.\nResearch was conducted in two co-educational primary\nschools in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, in 2009.\nSt. Catherine's Primary was a small Catholic school with\nover half of the students from Anglo/White backgrounds.\nSocrates Primary was a Greek Orthodox school, comprising\nmainly students from Greek and/or Cypriot backgrounds.\nBoth schools were largely middle class, with students from\nSocrates Primary more likely to be from privileged back-\ngrounds than those from St Catherine's Primary. Two classes\nfrom two age groups participated at both schools, involving\nparticipated in a number of verbal and written activities in\ngroups and individually across five sessions that provided\nthem with different avenues to reflect on their ideas about\nbeing girls and boys (for full details, see Bartholomaeus,\n2012). Class teachers and interested parents were inter-\nviewed about how they thought gender was understood by\nthe students.\nIn this research, sport and physical bodies were drawn on\nto construct a legitimating masculinity that influenced many\nboys and was also supported by a number of girls. The per-\nvasiveness of this idea was highlighted by the fact that the\nresearch was conducted solely in the classroom, which meant\nthat the author did not interact with the students when they\nwere playing sport. The author reconsidered Connell's (2000,\n2005) multiple masculinities framework in light of the data,\nnoting where her theories were useful, and where the find-\nings could not be easily interpreted into the patterns she\nwrites about. A consideration of the impact of young age on\ngender indicated a need to understand gender as more fluid\nthan Connell's theorizing allows for. Applying Foucault's\nnotion of discourse was most beneficial in theorizing this flu-\nidity, yet many of Connell's theories were still useful in theo-\nretically framing the findings. The author followed the lead\nof others who have drawn on the notion of a discourse of\nhegemonic masculinity (Beasley, 2008) to theorize that\nwhich is most influential in defining what is most \"mascu-\nline\" in any given setting, and that ensures men's (as a group)\nauthority over women (as a group).As Beasley (2008) writes,\n\"hegemonic masculinity [may be viewed] as a political\nmechanism--as a discursive ideal mobilizing legitimation\"\n(p. 100). This concept enables an examination of the fluidity\nof other practices that work alongside or present challenges\nto a discourse of hegemonic masculinity, including fluidity\nrelating to age and context (Bartholomaeus, 2013).\nTherefore, the privileging of sport for constructing mas-\nculinities could be understood as a discourse of hegemonic\nmasculinity. Sporting masculinities were the most privileged\nwhen considering different masculinities in relation to each\nother; sport was constructed as something that was important\nto being a boy; and sport was often constructed as being for\nboys and not for girls. The cultural exaltation of sporting\nmasculinities was evident when students were asked to rank\neight famous faces from most \"manly\" to least \"manly,\" giv-\ning reasons for their choices. Athletes were commonly\nviewed by the students as the most \"manly,\" above other men\nsuch as actors and the then Australian Prime Minister (Kevin\nRudd). Athletes were not privileged in the same way in a\nrelated activity ranking female famous faces from most\n\"womanly\" to least \"womanly.\" The privileging of sporting\nmasculinities was also evident when students wrote about\npeople they looked up to, where it was clear that boys looked\nup to only male athletes, and that these represented adult\nmasculinities. In contrast, none of the girls wrote about look-\ning up to any athletes.\nSport was also constructed as being for boys by claiming\nthat it was not for girls. This included the view that girls do\nnot play sport or are less skilled at it than boys (see also, for\nBartholomaeus and Senkevics 7\nsome girls, as well as some boys who did not like or engage\nin sport, also equated sport with boys. Generally, girls'\ninvolvement in sport was mentioned by girls only when pro-\nvoked or challenged by boys, such as when boys made claims\nto be more skilful at sport than girls. Importantly, alongside\nthe construction of boy/girl divisions in terms of sport, hier-\narchies of sports were used to create a discourse of hege-\nSwain, 2006), with soccer being the most privileged for boys\nat both schools.\nKey broader influences on constructing sport as important\nfor masculinity included the media, schools and teachers,\nand parents. For example, the lack of women's sports shown\nin the (Australian) media was drawn on by a 6-year-old boy\nin particular to ascertain that \"only men and boys play soc-\ncer.\" Another example of a broader influence came from the\nmother of a Year 6 boy who suggested that expectations in\nterms of gender coming from her husband involved\n\"push[ing]\" their two sons into sport, which was not the\nsame for their daughter.\nThis research supports the contention that, in Australia at\nleast, it appears that a discourse of hegemonic masculinity\nbegins with sport. Importantly, due to their young age, boys\nare unlikely to have access to other factors often related to\nhegemonic masculinity, such as work, sexuality, and/or\nfatherhood (Connell, 1983). However, students often drew\non adult men in their understandings of privileged masculin-\nity in terms of sport and to enhance the gendered power rela-\ntions in their own lives. The young age of the students was a\nbarrier to accessing a broader discourse of hegemonic mas-\nculinity, even to those boys who embraced sports and associ-\nated aspects of physicality. This research shows how the\ncomplex interweaving between gender and age plays out in\nrelation to sport.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have argued that though gender is not a key\nconcern in the sociology of childhood, it is an important fac-\ntor in children's lives. When gender is included in this field,\nit tends to be under-theorized, where gender is often reduced\nto a list of differences between boys and girls or it is simply\nmentioned as one factor relating to diversity. Drawing on a\nfeminist analysis of gender together with a sociological\napproach to the study of children and childhood helps to\naccount for the varied positions that children occupy in soci-\nety and their experiences, including in relation to gender.\nBy drawing on our own research in Brazil and Australia,\nas well as previous research, we explored how gender was\ntaken up and constructed in children's lives and the ways in\nwhich this can be theorized. We examined the complex inter-\nweaving in Brazil of play and other factors such as responsi-\nbilities in housework and risks concerning public space, with\nspecific attention to how gender influenced how this was\nexperienced by children. Although children's experiences in\nterms of access to leisure and constraints relating to house-\nwork were often divided by gender, this can be seen as a\nconstruction often put in place by parental and broader soci-\netal views of risk and responsibilities in terms of girls.\nIndeed, some of the girls expressed critical standpoints\nagainst the imposed gender dualism. The research in\nAustralia showed how gender and age interweave to produce\nparticular privileged gender discourses, where masculinities\nare often constructed via sport and as distinct from feminini-\nties. Importantly, a discourse of hegemonic masculinity\nbased on sport was something that many boys aspired to but\ndid not necessarily have access to. Thus, power relations\nbetween different practices of masculinities were evident as\nwell as between masculinities and femininities.\nDespite the differences between our two studies, some\ncommonalities in our approach should be highlighted.\nBroadly, we both argue for the importance of examining chil-\ndren's experiences of gender and how gender relations play\nout between boys and girls as well as among boys and among\ngirls. Furthermore, a consideration of the power relations\ninherent in interactions and structures is necessary, including\nto better understand children's pleasures and felt restrictions\nin relation to gender. We feel that it is important to consider\nhow children engage with, construct, take up, and challenge\ndominant gender discourses as well as to examine how gen-\nder matters in children's lives, including when it is important\nand when it is less important, and how age influences this. In\nparticular, we want to go beyond an examination of gender\nbinaries to explore the complexity of gender in children's\nlives. This is not to deny that gender can work as a binary in\nchildren's lives, including how they may explicitly talk about\nit, such as constructing sport as for boys and not for girls, and\nhow it restricts their everyday activities, such as girls not\nbeing allowed to play on the street when boys are. Going\nbeyond identifying binaries and viewing them as taken for\ngranted, it is important to examine the social and cultural\nmechanisms keeping this binary working, and how children\nexperience it.\nMore broadly, we feel that it is important to reconsider the\nconcept of \"child\" in the sociology of childhood. We would\nlike to ask how much can be inferred from the experiences of\nchildren if they are devoid of other social and structural fac-\ntors and contexts. We agree with the central tenet of the soci-\nology of childhood that \"childhood\" is both a social\nconstruction and a structural category that is important in\nchildren's lives. However, the tendency to view age as the\nmost important category in all contexts, places, and times\nignores children's experiences of other factors, and how\nthese factors intersect with age to produce specific experi-\nences and positions. Although we have focused on gender in\nthis article, there is also clearly a need to extend conversa-\ntions about diversity in the sociology of childhood. This\ninvolves paying attention to other social categories such as\nethnicity, race, sexuality, and class. and considering how\nthese intersect with age (and gender). Exploring the ways in\n8 SAGE Open\nwhich age interweaves with gender goes some way toward\nenhancing the discussion about accounting for diversity\namong children, which is mentioned in the sociology of\nchildhood but rarely examined in depth.\n"
