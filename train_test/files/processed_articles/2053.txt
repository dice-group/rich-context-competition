This\nobservation assumes a particular importance in Italy, a country that in the 1990s had the\nlowest fertility in the world and remains characterized by very low fertility (Billari and\nKohler 2004). While the emergence and persistence of nations with `very low' or\n`lowest-low' fertility has often been noted (Kohler et al. 2002, United Nations 2006),\nthe persistence of regional differentials in the level of fertility and the pace of change is\nscrutinized less often. Italy, moreover, remains characterized by the strong\nredistribution of the population inside its territory (Bonifazi and Heins 2000). This\nprocess involves both men and women of working and reproductive ages.\nRedistribution takes place among areas marked by sizable differences in demographic,\neconomic, and social patterns.\nOur motivation for this paper comes from a growing concern in demography for a\nbetter understanding of context in fertility outcomes. In this paper, we examine the\nrelationship between population distribution (context as place) and fertility. We allow\nfor the region of birth and migration itself (origin-destination combination) to influence\nchildbearing outcomes. In addition to speaking to current concerns, we extend a long-\nstanding literature investigating the way in which fertility is conditioned, in part, by\nmigration and geographic setting. The influence of place and migration on fertility has\nbeen subject to numerous prior studies. Such studies draw on several potential\nmechanisms that might give rise to an association between migration and fertility:\nsocialization, adaptation, selectivity, and disruption (Caldwell 1982). We discuss the\nrelevance of these in the model we propose and investigate. In this paper, we emphasize\nthe way in which changes in the predictive power of covariates help shed light on these\nmechanisms. We cannot fully disentangle all mechanisms, precisely because some\ncharacteristics remain unmeasured.4 We say less about disruption, because it is less\nlikely to operate in a high-income setting (such as contemporary Europe) and, in fact,\nwe find less empirical evidence for it.\nOur approach analyzes the impact of geographical mobility and residential location\non fertility in a large nationally representative sample of Italian women. We use\nlongitudinal data drawn across several waves and with retrospective information. We\nexamine the effects of age and cohort variables, several individual traits, the\n4 Note that selection on unobserved traits (underlying preferences for family size) can give rise to selection\nthat is not measured with the data in hand.

Such phenomenon may give rise to net geographic differentials\n(including rural-urban differentials in developing countries) in lifetime fertility. Such an empirical test\n(migration as a function of personal traits, including existing family size) is not our objective.\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 707\ncharacteristics of the origins and potential destinations, and the migratory event itself.\nIn so doing, we test for the influence of geography and migration, and also examine the\napplicability of some existing theories on this topic to the Italian setting.\n2. The Italian situation \u00ad an overview\nThe dynamics of fertility and internal mobility in Italy are very well-known\nphenomena. Although an appreciable literature describes these processes, we review\nsome regional trends in order to shed light on their interconnections and to demonstrate\nthe value of a comparative approach. Our intent is to show that fertility and internal\nmigration are both characterized by appreciable geographic variation, and moreover,\nthat these geographic differentials may be related.5 For available statistics, we rely on\nofficial data from the major Italian statistical agency, Istituto Nazionale di Statistica\n(ISTAT); some of these data are still unpublished. Regarding fertility, we choose two\nmeasures to express intensity and timing: the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and median age\nat first birth (see Figure 1 and see Appendix 1 and 2). For our analysis of migration, we\nuse data from the registrations and the de-registrations in the population register to\ncalculate average annual rates of in-migration and out-migration (see Appendix 2 and 4)\nand net migration rates (see Figure 2).\n\u00ad is characterized by an increase in the number of children born to women across nearly\n(Campania), although most regions followed the national trends over the 15-year\ninterval.

In sum, there is a clear direction of the internal Italian flows from the Center and\nthe South of Italy to the North-West. Several reasons underlie this redistribution. The\nmost important one concerns economic development in the `industrial triangle' (Turin,\nGenoa, and Milan municipalities). Moreover, high rates during the 1960\u00ad64 period are\nconnected to `break free' movements, which are in turn linked to the abolition of the\nFascist Law on Urbanization, and with the corrections in the Population Register\nfollowing the 1961 census (Casacchia and Strozza 2001). The internal redistribution\nalso occurs during a time of international migration of the Italian population towards\nthe countries in Central-West Europe.\ncharacterized by an uninterrupted fall of both fertility indicators.

An explanation is considered to be the economic crisis following\nthe `oil shock' of 1973, which produced a setback in the economy, reducing the\nattractiveness of the Northern industrialized regions of Piemonte, Lombardia, and\nLiguria. Other determinants more social in nature included shifts in the cost of living\nacross regions, housing availability, family `quality of life' factors, and occupational\nopportunities. During the period 1990\u00ad94, in-migration and out-migration rates were\nabove 20 in only four Northern regions (Valle d'Aosta, Liguria, Piemonte, and\nLombardia). The decline of interregional migration does not imply a decline of\ngeographic mobility overall, however. Starting from the 1970s, the percentage of\nmigrants undertaking short or middle-distance moves has grown (Bonifazi and Heins\n2000, Casacchia and Strozza 2001), linked to the relative growth of intra-urban moves\nFinally, the third phase in the evolution of Italian fertility and mobility is quite\nrecent.

Clearly, much has changed since 1995, when Italian national fertility\nreached the `memorable minimum'. The regions experiencing birth-rate increases are\nthose located in the North and the Center. By contrast, fertility is still decreasing in the\nSouth. The net result is a national convergence to a moderate range of low fertility\nvalues. Note that this recent upturn in fertility has occurred without a corresponding\ndecrease in the median age at first birth. Rather, the national MAFB in 2000\u00ad01 reached\n28.7 years; it increased in almost all regions, although regional differentials persist. The\nwomen experiencing the earliest transition to first childbirth (aged 27) are Sicilians,\nwhile the `latest' ones (aged 29.8) are Ligurians. This value seems to show no alteration\nof these traditional behaviors noticed in the whole country7.

Further evidence comes from\nnet migration rates. During the most recent years, the South has lost population equal to\n\u00ad3.2 on average; the North and the Center, by contrast, has experienced a net growth\nof 1.7 and 2.6 respectively. While the migratory flows still originate from the\nSouth, the new destination not only includes the North but also the Center. This change\nis likely due to the change of the axis of economic development from the conventional\n`industrial triangle' to newer locations in the Center and North-East. Migrant selectivity\nby demographic characteristic surely operates to shape these flows.

These shifts alter the human-capital composition\nof origin and destination areas, raising a host of questions, from `brain-drain' in the\nregions of origin to migrant accommodation in the destinations. At the same time, other\nobservers link migration to economic development and assert that this redistribution is\nbeneficial and improves national social and economic integration (Bonifazi et al. 1999).\n3. Theory and operationalization\nThe analysis of the connection between the geographic distribution and redistribution of\nthe population and differential fertility has a long history in demography. Most of this\nrural-urban differentials in developing or middle-income countries. This work offers a\ntheoretical approach in population studies, within which our work can be seen. The\napproach typically identifies four theoretical processes that could link migration and\nfertility: selection, adaptation, socialization, and disruption. Our contribution is to use\nthis framework, particularly the first three of these concepts, to test for variation by\ngeography and migration experience within a contemporary high-income, low-fertility\nsetting.\nSelection operates when internal migrants can be characterized by different\npersonal traits or behavioral intentions than those who remain at origin. Adaptation is\nindicated when migrants alter their childbearing patterns to approach or resemble those\nof the destination community. Migrants are seen as adapting to new fertility norms\nwithin their childbearing span. Socialization involves temporal change, but these take\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 713\nplace over a period of time across generations (Kulu 2005). Under this hypothesis, one\nwould expect that individuals manifest the fertility behavior of the childhood place and\nthe behavior adapted during adolescent socialization, irrespective of residence during\nchildbearing years. Disruption operates under spousal (partner) separation; it is less\nlikely to be relevant in a high-income setting. Moreover, it may be hard to detect when\ncontraception is prevalent and birth intervals are long.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether or not and, if so, how this theoretical\nframework can be applied to contemporary Italy. As we discussed above, Italy is\ncharacterized by significant internal geographic differentials in fertility and by varying\nrates of fertility transition across regions during the past few decades. We draw from\nthis theoretical framework to test for the influence of geography \u00ad the place of origin\nand the migration-stream \u00ad in our event-history analysis of the transition to first birth in\nItaly. Selection will be indicated when regression adjustment for additional personal\ncharacteristics (age, education, etc.) reduces regional differentials. Socialization and\nadaptation are of large interest to us. Socialization will be indicated by the persistence\nof region-of-origin dummy variables, an outcome consistent with a pattern in which\nthose whose childhood was spent in a particular region retained that region's\nchildbearing expectations into the reproductive years. (We cannot test for changes\nacross generations, a subject of interest in discussions of socialization.) By contrast,\nadaptation would be visible in migration where the migrants' fertility is closer to\ndestination than to the region of origin. We will apply this comparison specifically to\nthose who migrated out of the South (as it has the higher fertility) and those who\nremained. While we embed our analysis in this broad framework, our model\nspecification will look more directly at the influences of origin and origin\u00addestination\nmigration as predictors of differential fertility.\n3.1 Model specification and hypothesis tests\nA useful way to think about the operation of these mechanisms is in terms of statistical\nhypothesis tests in a multivariate setting. Consider first regional variation itself. Simple\ndescriptive statistics indicate the obvious existence of regional variation in fertility. If\nthese differences are only the manifestation of compositional factors (age, education,\ndifferences of union type across regions), then suitable controls would remove all\nregional effects. That is, we would accept the null hypothesis that regional dummy\nvariables are equal to zero. Consider second the fertility differences of migrants. If\nmigrants are not at all selective, their fertility will match the region of origin, net of\ncontrols for personal traits, and this in turn would be consistent with socialization. If\nmigrants experience rapid adaptation, then their fertility will match the region of\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n714 http://www.demographic-research.org\ndestination, net of controls for personal traits.8 In any case, the magnitude and\nsignificance of geographic and migration-stream indicator variables (and the predicted\nvalues that are calculated from them) are the chief indicators of the joint operation of\nselection and/or adaptation. We will get some indication of disruption in our analysis by\nlooking at the timing of fertility after arrival. If the fertility is much lower soon after\narrival at destination (net of all other effects), there is some evidence of disruption.\nThus, we espouse three hypotheses of socialization, adaptation, and selection:\n1. Socialization: This will be indicated by the statistically significant effects of the\nregion of childhood residence (dummy variable), even when controlling for other\ncovariates.\n2. Adaptation: This will be indicated by fertility patterns for migrants that\nresemble the destination patterns rather than the patterns displayed at origin. More\nspecifically, migrants out of the Southern region should have lower fertility, ceteris\nparibus.\n3. Selection: This will be indicated by a reduction in the magnitude of origin\u00ad\ndestination coefficients when introducing controls for the personal traits of age,\neducation, and employment status.\n3.2 Additional conceptual considerations\nDifferent disciplinary perspectives offer alternate views of the underlying mechanisms\nthat drive socialization and adaptation. From the sociological perspective, social and\ncultural norms operating in the current residential environment influence childbearing\nintentions and outcomes (Caldwell 1982). The difference between socialization and\nadaptation would be one of timing, with adaptation being manifest relatively soon and\nsocialization taking longer, usually working across generations. From the economic\nperspective, by contrast, socialization and adaptation are seen as being linked to\nhousehold income and the cost of having children. Differences in wages for men,\nwomen, and children, the constraints of living costs and income in the destination area,\nand the variation in employment and educational opportunities change the real costs of\nchildbearing, thus altering fertility behavior (Becker 1981). In sum, exposure to\ndifferent socio-cultural norms and costs of childbearing will lead to changes in fertility\nbehavior, so that the migrant population's fertility rate will ultimately converge with\n8 A match to the destination fertility pattern may also take place if migrants are selective in a way that is\nunobserved (norms and preferences are not among the covariates). This indicates a childbearing trajectory\nequivalent to that of the destination.\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 715\nA complete test of the temporal aspects of socialization and adaptation, even\nacross generations, is beyond the scope of our analysis. Furthermore, the concept of\nadaptation is problematic. While adjustment of fertility is readily expected for migration\nfrom less developed areas to more developed areas, it is not clear exactly what the\nexpectation is for individuals who move into the opposite direction. A strict and\nmechanical application of the adaptation notion would suggest that movers from high\nincome (correspondingly low-fertility) areas to low income (and higher-fertility) areas\nshould exhibit increases in childbearing, but this is a prediction about which one might\nharbor considerable skepticism. Hence, we espouse our adaptation and socialization\nhypotheses with the South as the region of origin.\nFinally we comment on `disruption', defined as separation from one's place and\nfamily of origin, difficulties of insertion into the destination areas, and so on. Usually,\ndisruption is expected to have the effect of lowering the fertility of migrants compared\nwith that of stayers (Carlson 1985). The impact of disruption is seen mostly in the\ntiming of childbearing and may only last for a short time (Gorwaney et al. 1998).\nDisruption does link geographic variation and migration to fertility: the act of migration\nis seen as inherently disruptive, as it often physically separates partners. In the case of\ninternal migration in a highly developed, low-fertility setting, contemporary\ntransportation and communication technology operate to mitigate the effects of\nseparation. Thus, it is less likely that disruption operates to any detectable degree in\nItaly today.\n4. Data and methods\nThe data analyzed comes from the `Indagine Longitudinale sulle Famiglie Italiane'\n(ILFI) or Italian Households Panel, a nationally representative survey with a\nprospective panel structure. The ILFI covered about 10,500 male and female adults,\nNotable for its life-history detail, the ILFI collects complete information (from birth to\nthe end of the most recent survey wave) on geographical or residential history,\neducation and vocational training, work, social origins, family and fertility.\nOur statistical approach is a discrete time event-history analysis. The ILFI data has\nprovided us with annual information on fertility (birth of a child in that year) as well as\non the region of residence. We have annual information on a number of other key traits,\n9 A new wave was conducted in 2005; however, it was not yet available at the time of writing this paper. The\nILFI primary sampling units included 265 municipalities across Italy.\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n716 http://www.demographic-research.org\nas well, including the labor-force status, the employment status, and the marital status.\nCollectively, they constitute time-varying covariates. We model birth in a given year as\na function of values of these traits lagged one year.10 In addition, we include birth\ncohort of the woman and region of residence at birth as time-fixed covariates. We\ninclude age as a time-varying covariate, as its value is, of course, predetermined at each\nyear. The event-history approach allows us to examine the influence of these covariates\nin their correct temporal order for every year of exposure to the risk of childbearing\n(age 15 to the year of the current wave of the survey).\nCrucial to our study is residential history. We include somewhat different\nmeasures of region of residence, depending on model specification. Basic to the\napproach is the region of residence at birth. We operationalize region to be one of three\n`macro-areas' in the country overall (North, Center, and South); these are an\naggregation of the 20 administrative regions in Italy. Macro-area is a basic indicator of\nexposure to a social setting during key childhood, and is thus a proxy for the setting in\nwhich childbearing views would be formed.\nWe define a `migrant' to be a person who in the year of interest is living presently\nin a different administrative region (of the 20 administrative regions) than the region of\nhis or her birth, for at least one calendar-year during her reproductive age. In the models\nof Table 2, we include dummy variables for migration out of the macro-area of birth.\n(There are three out-migration dummy variables versus the reference category of\nstayers.) The models in Table 3 have more details about the migration streams. We\ninclude a set of nine dummy variables to capture particular origin\u00addestination migration\npatterns. Geographic moves between administrative regions, yet within a macro-area,\nare counted as migration. Thus, for example, the North\u00adNorth migration dummy\nregisters a move from one of the Northern administrative regions to another. (Return\nmigrants are also considered as resident in their original region, thus they are stayers \u00ad\nno longer breaking the connection with the home region.) We make this choice to\nconsider only the most important events in geographic mobility. That is, the regional\nboundary is the minimum geographic threshold to be considered a migrant.\n5. Descriptive results\nTable 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the sample women. The data are\ndisaggregated by residence at birth. These details reveal the regional differences that\nmotivate our analysis.\n10 Note that if birth and migration occurred in the same year, we would not be able to sort out the temporal\nordering within the year. With the one year lag, migration (and woman's place of birth) precedes the birth\nevent and is more behaviorally appropriate timing.\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 717\nTable 1: Number of interviewed women, their migratory and\nreproductive features by birth cohort and macro-area of residence\nBirth cohort\nCharacteristics\nNorthern regionsa\nCentral regionsb\nSouthern regionsc\na- Northern regions: Valle d'Aosta, Piemonte, Liguria, Veneto, Friuli, Trentino, Lombardia.\nb- Central regions: Emilia Romagna, Toscana, Marche, Umbria, Lazio, Abruzzo, Sardegna.\nc- Southern regions: Molise, Puglia, Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Sicilia.\nd- At interview.\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n718 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1 clearly recapitulates several key aspects of the time trend in the\nreproductive behavior of Italian women. Consistent with the literature, we observe an\nincreasing median age at first birth11 on the order of about four years across the span of\ncohorts (see also Righi and Dalla Zuanna 1999). With this, we also see a decline in the\naverage number of children ever born. The 1951\u00ad60 cohort exhibits lower completed\nfertility than the 1941\u00ad50 cohort. (These two oldest cohorts have virtually completed\ntheir childbearing exposure. The youngest, born in 1960, would be 43 years of age at\nthe time of the most recent ILFI wave.) The 1961\u00ad70 cohort exhibits a much older age\nat first birth and appreciable lower fertility. While this cohort (age 33\u00ad43) in 2003 has\nnot completed its childbearing, it is clear that completed fertility will remain well below\nthe two prior cohorts. For the 1971\u00ad83 cohort, completed fertility is probably not a\nmeaningful statistic, but we note that the age at first birth is on a par with the 1961\u00ad70\ncohort.\nDifferences by macro-area of origin and migration status are also apparent in Table\n1. The older cohorts originating and staying in the North and the Center macro-areas\ndisplay lower fertility than women from the South. While the results are not as\ndefinitive for the two youngest cohorts, there too it appears that recent childbearing in\nthe South exceeds that of the North and Center.\nOf particular interest are differentials by migration status within the area of origin.\nFor women born in the North, there is a notable difference (a maximum of 0.25 children\nfor the 1961\u00ad70 cohort) between out-migrants from the region and those who remained\nbehind, suggesting that migration itself is linked to the postponement of childbearing.\nFor women born in the Center, out-migrants in the oldest two cohorts show slightly\nhigher lifetime fertility, while those in the 1961\u00ad70 cohort have slightly lower (among\nalready quite low) fertility. The most striking differences are among women in the\nSouth. First, women of the South, among all cohorts, have a higher fertility than women\nof corresponding cohorts in other macro-areas. Second, it is the Southern-born non-\nmigrant women who have the highest fertility overall. In the oldest cohort this\ndifferential rises to 0.4 children over completed lifetime fertility. Our descriptive\nanalysis thus confirms the existence of a clear regional bifurcation (South vs.\nelsewhere) in reproductive behavior and is consistent with the characterizations\nprovided by others (e.g., Bonifazi and Heins 2000).\nTable 1 also presents time trends in the migratory behavior of the women studied,\nand by extension, the population at large. The table indicates a decline across cohorts in\nthe fraction of women not residing in the region of birth. To be sure, part of this is due\nto longer exposure (to the risk of an interregional move) among older cohorts. At the\nsame time, it is consistent with the more detailed data on migration of the Appendix\ntables, which indicate a decline in province out-migration rates, calculated on the basis\n11 The median ages are computed using Kaplan-Meier techniques.\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 719\nof the resident-origin population, from the 1950s through the 1990s, with a slight upturn\nin the final decade. Regional differences in migration and population retention are also\napparent in Table 1. In all origins, there is an increase in the fraction of interregional\nmigrants who have departed the macro-area. This is consistent with the increasing\nnational economic and social integration of Italy over the half-century of observation.\nStill, the differences are striking across the areas of origin. Almost all of those who\ndepart from one of the six administrative regions of the South leave the macro-area\naltogether and move to the Center or North. In the North of Italy, migrations across\nadministrative regions remain within the North macro-area. The case of the Center is\nintermediate.\n6. Multivariate results\nTable 2 presents our discrete time event-history analysis for duration to first birth for all\nwomen in the ILFI dataset during the period of reproductive exposure. Exposure begins\nat age 15 and continues to age 50. Exposure may be censored by the survey at a\nyounger age. Table 2 presents two models. The first one presents the first estimates of\nthe probability of birth as a function of age (in quadratic form), cohort, region of\nresidence at birth, and region of origin for those who have departed from their origin\nregion. The second model includes the same covariates and then adds several other\nindividual, time-varying covariates: educational attainment (dummy variables for\nintermediate or high level of education compared to low education12), employed (vs.\nnot), student (vs. not), and union status (civil marriage, cohabitation, not in union vs.\nreligious marriage as the reference category).\nOur first model with limited covariates gives the overall picture of the transition to\nfirst birth in the ILFI female sample. We observe that the probability of giving birth\nrises with age, but does so at a decreasing rate (the second-order term is negative), to a\nmaximum of about age 28. There are sharp cohort effects. The oldest two cohorts (born\nthe reference cohort. The youngest cohort, born 1971\u00ad83, is much less likely to bear\nchildren than all of the other cohorts. The overall change across the several decades is\n0.754\u00ad0.647]) as likely to bear their first child in a year of reproductive exposure than\nwomen born in the 1940s, with all else being the same.\n12 Low education concerns less than high-school education completed; intermediate education means high-\nschool completion; high education regards more than high-school level.\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n720 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2: Determinants of the transition to first birth: discrete time event-\nhistory regression models including the region of childhood residence\nand out-migration only; women aged 15 to 49 years\nVariable Parameter\nestimate\nStandard\nerror\nParameter\nestimate\nStandard\nerror\nMacro-area of residence at birth (ref.= North)\nOut-migration according to the region of birth (ref.= no out-migration; time-varying)\nEducational level (ref.= none or low education; time-varying)\nEducational status (ref.= no more student; time-varying)\nOccupational status (ref.= non-employed; time-varying)\nType of first union (ref.= religious union; time-varying)\nSignificance: `*'=10%; '**'=5%; `***' =1%.\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 721\nThe results in Table 2 confirm some broad regional differentials, but now also\nbegin to bring geographic mobility into the picture. Women whose origin is in the\nSouth are much more likely to bear a child than their counterparts in the North\n(reference region) or the Center. The South is clearly a distinctive geographic area,\nsince there is no significant difference in the regression equation between the Center\nand the North. We also capture the effects of migration, using the next three dummy\nvariables. Migrants out of any of the three regions exhibit a higher fertility than stayers\nor return migrants. The differential for Southern-origin migrants leads to an odds that is\nabout 50% higher than for other women of the same age and cohort.\nIn Model 2 of Table 2 we add socio-economic and marital-status traits. We note,\nfirst, that strongly significant age and cohort effects persist. Notably, however, the\ncohort effects are moderate in size, even though they operate in the same direction.\nNow, however, women born in the 1970s have odds of bearing their first child of about\nbeing the same. This is a much smaller difference than before and indicates that much\nof the cohort difference is working through marriage behavior. Since the second model\ncontrols for union type (as a time-varying covariate), the declining rates of entry into\nmarriage across the several cohorts are responsible for part of the decline in the\ntransition to first birth. It is noteworthy, however, that the adjustment for marriage does\nnot remove the cohort effect altogether.\nModel 2 also shows significant effects for education (intermediate level only) and\nlabor-force participation. Women with moderate levels of completed education exhibit\nappreciably lower rates of transition to first birth, even if everything else (age, cohort,\nresidential history) is the same. Oddly, women who have continued beyond high-school\neducation (our `high' category) exhibit no differential fertility, although the effects here\nmay be working through continuing school enrollment (strongly negative) and\nemployment. A large body of explanations of fertility decline \u00ad worldwide, not just in\nItaly \u00ad rest on the notion that women's labor-force participation is a driving force\nbehind decreasing age at entry into childbearing. We find evidence that is consistent\nwith this notion: Working in the year prior to the year of exposure reduces the predicted\nprobability of having a child by about 30%.\nFinally, our inclusion in Model 2 of time-varying indicators of union status is\ninstructive. Our reference category is religious union. Women who are un-partnered\n(neither formally married nor in cohabiting) are, not surprisingly, much less likely to\nmake the transition to first birth. Women who are in civil union display 20% lower odds\nof first-birth transition than do women in a religious union. This illustrates the\nimportant way in which union type may indicate a greater degree of secularization.\nWomen in a cohabitating union are yet again much less likely to bear a child. Recall\nthat all of these union-status measures are time-varying and lagged one year, so they\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n722 http://www.demographic-research.org\nallow for changes in union formation over time, unlike some analyses, which are\nlimited to status at the time of the survey or at a single earlier point.\nIn the models of Table 2 and Table 3 below, we elect to include women of all\nmarital statuses, even those not partnered in the year of exposure and those never\nmarried. We do so for two reasons. First, this gives a comprehensive view of the overall\npicture of fertility in Italy. It shows, for instance, the way in which entry into marriage\nhelps to explain some of the cohort decline in childbearing. In addition, the review of\nthe two models helps to shed light on the behavioral intertwining of marriage and\nchildbearing. In a country such as Italy, in which most childbearing has occurred within\nformal marriage, the decision to marry may be in part a decision to embark on a family-\nbuilding trajectory. The `control' for union type may be adjusting for something that is\npartly an outcome. Separating the two models helps clarify the relationship and allows\nanalysts and readers to see how much difference alternative specifications make. We do\nestimate below another model (see Table 4), which includes only person-years of\nexposure from women who are currently in a union.\nIn Table 2 the coefficients on the geographic variables (region of origin and\nmigration) do shift appreciably with the introduction of measures for the other personal\ntraits. The South (as place of birth and presumed childhood socialization) remains\nhighly significant, while the Central-region birthplace is still non-significant. Even after\nthe introduction of all of these controls for personal traits, Southern-born women are\npredicted to have annual birth probabilities 34% above other women.\nMigration effects are reduced to non-significance in Model 2. Migrants out of the\nNorth and Center are predicted to have somewhat lower rates of transition to first birth,\nbut standard errors on these coefficients do not lend confidence at conventional levels.\nMigrants out of the South exhibit slightly higher fertility levels, net of other traits, but\nagain, these have relatively large standard errors and we cannot reject the null\nhypothesis of no effect.\nTaken together, the results are informative. Women who are born in the South and\nremain in the region exhibit an appreciably larger fertility than other women. The\napparent differences of migrants and stayers in Model 1 are `explained away' by the\npersonal traits of education, union status, employment, and so on. Taken together, the\nresults suggest true regional heterogeneity on the part of the South on the one hand, and\nmigrant selectivity on the other. Migrants out of the South differ on several\ndemographic traits related to fertility, but exhibit no further difference in fertility\nbehavior once the analysis adjusts for these traits. Stated in other words, some of the\nregional/migration differentials we observed at first are due to the differential human-\ncapital composition of the persons at origin and the migrants composing the flows.\nTable 3 estimates a model with a different specification for migration, but in which\nall other variables and the sample are the same. We do not repeat the discussion above\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 723\nregarding age, cohort, and the time-varying traits of education, labor-force attachment,\nand union status. Coefficient values for these traits are not far from those estimated for\nTable 2, and the levels of significance remain about the same, too. Our discussion\nconcentrates on the differential specification and interpretation of the geographic\nvariables.\nOur treatment of the region of origin \u00ad dummy-variable for residence at birth in the\nCenter or South vs. North \u00ad remains unchanged. Now, however, we include specific\ndummy-variables for each origin\u00addestination pairing. With three geographic macro-\nareas there are nine dummy\u00advariable values to contrast with the implicit reference\ncategory of non-migrants. The inclusion of more detail on migrant flows increases the\nmagnitude of the original region-of-origin coefficients; each value of South and Center\nis larger in absolute value in Table 3, Model 1, than the corresponding value in Table 2,\nModel 1. In Table 3 the regional contrasts of birth in the South (vs. North) remain\nstrongly significant, with Southern women expected to bear children at rates about 37%\nabove their Northern counterparts. The introduction of the full set of controls (Model 2)\nraises to marginal significance the coefficient on birth in the Center (vs. North). Thus,\nwe observe that in Table 3 women who remain in the Center and the South macro-areas\nexhibit a higher fertility than do non-migrants in the North.\nThe predicted effects of being a member of a migratory flow are noteworthy,\nalthough not strong in terms of statistical significance. We find that most migrants\n(eight of nine cases) in Model 1 (lacking detailed socio-economic controls) exhibit a\nhigher fertility than non-migrants. Adding the time-varying socio-economic covariates\nin Model 2 generally reduces the magnitude of the values of the several migration\norigin\u00addestination dummy variables. Such a change, in turn, demonstrates that the\nsocio-economic traits are important and differentially represented in the streams of\nItaly's interregional migrants. These socio-economic traits are strongly predictive of\nfertility and behave much as in Table 2, so we now concentrate on the migration\ncoefficients themselves, with emphasis on differentials linked to the South.\nModel 1 of Table 2 indicates that the migrants who move out of the six\nadministrative regions of the South \u00ad either to another administrative region within the\nSouth, or to the Center or the North \u00ad exhibit a higher fertility subsequent to migration.\nThe effect is particularly pronounced for migrants to the North, where over 80%\nincreased odds are predicted. (This is the only one of the two contrasts of Model 1 that\nis highly significant.) When other socio-economic traits are introduced (Model 2), the\nSouth-North effect is reduced to non-significance; nevertheless, the dummy on the\nSouth origin increases in magnitude. All this \u00ad selective shifts in significance along\nwith the persistence of certain effects \u00ad reinforces understanding the relationship\nbetween regional origins and composition of migrant flows.\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n724 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: Determinants of the transition to first birth: discrete time event-\nhistory regression models including the region of childhood residence\nand the origin-destination of migration; women aged 15 to 49 years\nVariable Parameter\nestimate\nStandard\nerror\nParameter\nestimate\nStandard\nerror\nMacro-area of residence at birth (ref.= North)\nMigration according to individual origin\u00addestination combination (ref.= no migration; time-var.)\nEducational level (ref.= none or low education; time-varying)\nEducational status (ref.= no more student; time-varying)\nOccupational status (ref.= not employed; time-varying)\nType of first union (ref.= religious union; time-varying)\nSignificance: `*'=10%;'**'=5%; `***'=1%.\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 725\nThus, the South remains distinctive, even after the control for these several\nbehavioral traits and the more detailed origin\u00addestination migration patterns. Once\nagain, the indication is that the migratory flows themselves are demographically\nselective. After adjusting for these measurable traits, there is little additional behavioral\nselection to be seen.\nWe have estimated this model for an alternative version in which the origin\u00ad\ndestination migration indicator remains `on' for five years at most. (The alternative\nmodel is not shown). If disruption were to operate strongly, we would expect the five-\nyear-period-lag model to have highly significant coefficients on the migration dummy\nvariables, but the full-exposure-time model to be less significant. A finding of strong\neffects in the model with five-year limits would suggest disruption. Given that we see\nno such short-term effect, and given that the pseudo-R2 remains almost identical to the\nfull-exposure-time model, there is no support for disruption as a mechanism.\nTable 4 presents our final set of regression analyses. We include the same\ncovariate specification as we have done for Table 3, but we now limit the sample to the\nperson-years of exposure contributed while in union. (We discussed this issue above.)\nFrom an accounting point this is not problematic, as almost all births occur within a\nunion. Moreover, we exclude only three person-years from the reproductive span of an\nindividual woman during which the woman is un-partnered. From a theoretical\nstandpoint, such sample restriction asserts here that those in a union (religious, civil, or\ncohabiting) constitute the proper behavioral risk set for the transition to the first child.\nThe sample restriction reduces the total number of person-years in our discrete time\nThe results of this model parallel those we obtained earlier. We find broadly\nsimilar age profiles. In Table 4, Model 1 (omitting the detailed socio-economic\ncovariates) the cohort effect is moderated considerably from Table 3, Model 1, on the\nlarger sample of women. In the present table, the most recent cohort (born 1971\u00ad83) is\ncohort exhibits odds of childbearing of about 60% of the 1940s cohort. (The\ncorresponding odds ratio in Table 3, Model 1, was 24% for the sample of all women.)\nThis would suggest that much of the differences between the two cohorts we observed\nbefore are due to rates of transition into union rather than to first birth from those\nalready in a union.\nNow turning to Model 2, the predicted effects of the time-varying socio-economic\ntraits are much as before. The more education possessed by a woman, the lower her\npredicted fertility. (Again, it is the women with intermediate education whose\ndifferential is significant.) Women in union who were also students or employed were\nless likely to make the transition to first birth. Employed women have predicted birth\nodds about 30% below those of non-employed women.\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n726 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 4: Determinants of transition to first birth: discrete time event-\nhistory regression models including the region of childhood residence\nand origin-destination of migration; women in union only, aged 15 to\nVariable Parameter\nestimate\nStandard\nerror\nParameter\nestimate\nStandard\nerror\nMacro-area of residence at birth (ref.= North)\nMigration according to individual origin\u00addestination combination (ref.= no migration; time-var.)\nEducational level (ref.= none or low education; time-varying)\nEducational status (ref.= no more student; time-varying)\nOccupational status (ref.= not employed; time-varying)\nType of first union (ref.=religious union; time-varying)\nSignificance: `*'=10%; '**'=5%; `***'=1%.\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 727\nWe do examine the type of union for this sample of women in union. Women in civil\nunions still exhibited odds of first-birth transition of about 80% of those in a religious\nunion. Transition rates for cohabiting women were considerably lower still \u00ad as we have\nfound for the other cases above.\nRegional differences in fertility are still apparent in Table 4. In fact, the South-vs.-\nNorth differential is more pronounced among this sub-sample of women in a union.\nAmong regional stayers (setting all migration-flow dummy variables to zero in Model\n1), women born in the South exhibit odds of first-birth transition about 60% higher than\notherwise equivalent women in the North. Even when adjusting for these characteristics\n(Model 2), the differential odds remain 37%. The characteristics of education,\nemployment, and union type offer only a partial explanation of these regional fertility\ndifferentials.\nSeveral of the interregional migrant indicators (the nine origin\u00addestination dummy\nvariable contrasts) point to only modest fertility differentials between those who moved\nand those who stayed behind. In a model re-introducing broad out-migration groupings\n(not shown, but corresponding to Table 2), we also find a South-regional effect but no\nmigrant effect. We can put the story together across the models. Recall that the first\nmultivariate model (see Table 2, Model 1) found both a South-origin effect and a\nconsiderable South-out-migration effect. Working across subsequent models \u00ad adding\nbehavioral time-varying covariates and restricting the sample to those in union only \u00ad\nreduced the migration effect to non-significance but not the South-origin effect.\nHalf of all internal migrations in Italy (among the person-year observations in our\ndata) are out-of-South migrations, with 28% of total moves from the South to the North\nand another 22% of moves from the South to the Center. The importance of the region\nof origin and of the redistribution is shown in Figure 3, which presents a simulation of\nTable 4, Model 2 \u00ad the sample of women in a union. For covariates other than region or\nmigration we set values to their mean across the person-years in the models of Table\n4.13 We then simulate the probability of birth in a given year for non-movers in each of\nthe three major regions and for two groups of migrants, those moving South-to-North\nand those moving South-to-Center.\nFigure 3 recapitulates the strong regional differentials observed among stayers,\nespecially women in the South, and makes clear that these differentials persist even\nafter controlling for other socio-economic time-varying traits. The simulation of South\u00ad\nNorth migrants indicates a predicted fertility level about the same as women in the\nSouth who do not migrate. The predicted value for South-to-Center migrants is slightly\n13 The choice of simulation values is somewhat arbitrary. We used the common practice of using mean values\nfor non-focal variables, and then varying (of course) the focal variables. The selection of other hypothetical\nvalues would shift the predicted argument of the logit by a constant and the predicted probability by the\ncorresponding anti-logit. The pattern of simulated values for Table 3, Model 2 (all women) is nearly identical.\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n728 http://www.demographic-research.org\nlower. Of course, these are predicted values; the formal test shows no statistical\ndifference from regional effects alone for either of these migrant groups.\nFigure 3: Predicted fertility for selected geographic profiles;\nwomen in union only, aged 15 to 49 years\nNorth Center South South-North South-Center\nNonmigrants Migrants\nRegion and migration experience\nPredicted probabilty of birth\nNote: Simulation of other covariates at their sample means.\nDemographic Research: Volume 17, Article 24\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 729\n7. Conclusion\nThis paper informed both our understanding of the determinants of contemporary\nItalian fertility and the broader ways in which regional variation and interregional\nmigration can help to understand the social processes underlying fertility dynamics. We\nemployed contemporary event-history data, which allowed us to analyze the evolution\nof life events with proper timing and sequencing. Our micro-level analysis includes key\ndemographic socio-economic covariates \u00ad age, cohort, education, employment, union\nstatus \u00ad and time-varying information drawn from a woman's residence history.\nAt an aggregate level, our results chart the substantial decline in Italian fertility in\nrecent decades. The descriptive results accord with a pattern of cohort decline in\nchildbearing and in increasing age at first birth. The temporal decline is consistent with\nsecular changes in Italian society affecting the position of women, such as increasing\nfemale education and female employment, which are implicated in the transition to first\nbirth. Yet, these changes are only part of the story. Even after having adjusted for\nseveral of these personal characteristics, we find that recent cohorts (women born in the\n1960s and 1970s) make the transition to first birth at appreciably lower rates than\nwomen of earlier cohorts, even women who were otherwise in the same socio-economic\nand age categories.\nCrucial, perhaps, in our analysis is the way in which we demonstrated the interplay\nof geographic variation and social characteristics on the transition to marriage and\nchildbearing. At first sight, our results showed strong regional differentials, especially\nin terms of the birthplace in the South versus elsewhere. The initial results also\nindicated differentials for migrant streams. Yet, once we controlled for time-varying\npersonal traits, including education, student status, employment, and union status, the\ndifferences by migrant stream were largely reduced to non-significance. Nevertheless,\nour models that include the full set of personal traits still revealed a significant impact\nof the place of birth on the predicted reproductive behavior. Among women in union,\nthe odds of a woman born in the South bearing a child are 1.37 times those of a\ncomparable woman born in the North.\nWe return now to our hypotheses and the several mechanisms discussed earlier.\nWe do find evidence for socialization, the mechanism of our first hypothesis. Our main\nindicator of socialization is the place of birth. Even after controlling for key personal\ncharacteristics, women born in the South (and thus presumed to be raised there), do\nexhibit a higher fertility than do other women. The behavioral difference is consistent\nwith the process of socialization, where women adopt the fertility norms of their place\n(region) of socialization. Our second hypothesis concerns adaptation. Strong adaptation\nto destination community would be indicated by predicted fertility that should match\nmore closely the destination than the origin, or at least be intermediate between the two.\nGabrielli, Paterno & White: The impact of origin region and internal migration on Italian fertility\n730 http://www.demographic-research.org\nWe find no real evidence for this; differentials for migrants are non-significant (when\nother characteristics are adjusted) and the predicted values do not necessarily lie in a\ndirection consistent with adjustment toward the region of new residence. Future work\nmay want to analyze data that have more precise and contextual geographic categories\nthan the data available to us in the Italian Households Panel (ILFI) data.\nOur third hypothesis concerns selection, where migrants differ by other observed\nsocial and demographic traits linked to fertility. We do find considerable evidence for\nselection. The magnitude of coefficients for migration and region-of-birth effects\n(dummy variables in our models) is reduced when covariates measuring socio-\neconomic traits are introduced. Thus, the evidence indicates that these traits are\ndifferentially distributed among regions and migrant streams, and that demographic\nselection operates. Finally, we discuss disruption. We did not anticipate that disruption\nwould operate in a high-income low-fertility setting, and what is more, other data might\nbe preferred to detect it. In fact, we find no evidence of short-term differentials for\nmigrants.\nSince we have used detailed longitudinal data and controlled for a number of key\ncharacteristics, it is all the more striking that we find initial and persistent geographic\ndifferentials in the latter portion of the 20th century and into the 21st. Our results point\nto the continuing relevance of the socialization during childhood and early adulthood in\nlater-life patterns of fertility and family formation. Our results also point to the\nchallenging task of more precisely and definitively identifying the nature of contextual\ninfluences and how they operate at different scales of time and space.\n8. "
