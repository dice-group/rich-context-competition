    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Ghana is currently undergoing a profound demographic transition, with large increases in the\nnumber of older adults in the population. Older adults require greater levels of healthcare as illness and disability\nincrease with age. Ghana therefore provides an important and timely case study of policy implementation aimed at\nimproving equal access to healthcare in the context of population ageing.\nThis paper examines the determinants of National Health Insurance (NHIS) enrolment in Ghana, using two different\nsurveys and distinguishing between younger and older adults. Two surveys are used in order to investigate\nconsistency in insurance enrolment. The comparison between age groups is aimed at understanding whether\ndeterminants differ for older adults. Previous studies have mainly focused on the enrolment of young and middle\naged adults; thus by widening the focus to include older adults and taking into account differences in their\ndemographic and socio-economic characteristics this paper provides a unique contribution to the literature.\nGhanaian Living Standards Survey (GLSS) the determinants of NHIS enrolment among younger adults (aged 18-49) and\nolder adults (aged 50 and over) are compared. Logistic regression explores the socio-economic and demographic\ndeterminants of NHIS enrolment and multinomial logistic regression investigates the correlates of insurance drop out.\nResults: Similar results for people aged 18-49 and people aged 50 plus were revealed, with older adults having a\nslightly lower probability of dropping out of insurance coverage compared to younger adults. Both surveys confirm\nthat education and wealth increase the likelihood of NHIS affiliation. Further, residential differences in insurance\ncoverage are found, with greater NHIS coverage in urban areas. The findings give assurance that both datasets (SAGE\nand GLSS) are suitable for research on insurance affiliation in Ghana.\nConclusion: The paper indicates that although the gap in coverage among rich and poor and urban and rural\nresidents appears to have decreased, these factors still determine NHIS coverage of younger and older adults. The\nsame holds for education. Increasing efforts are needed to ensure equal access to healthcare.\n",

Efforts to\nmeet the aim of UHC will be greatly influenced by the\nglobal population ageing phenomenon. Older adults re-\nquire greater levels of healthcare due to increasing ill-\nness and disability as ageing occurs, which complicates\nprogress to UHC. Moreover, older adults in low and\nmiddle-income countries are often left without any regu-\nlar income due to a lack of social pensions [1]. Social\nprotection schemes in low and middle income countries\nare vital to the protection of older adults because in\ncountries without social security systems, it is left to the\nindividual to finance healthcare expenditures.\nGhana presents a crucial case study for the implementa-\ntion of policies aimed at UHC in the context of population\nageing in sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana is currently under-\ngoing a profound demographic transition, with a large\nincrease in the number of older adults. The percent-\nage of people aged 60 and over is estimated to grow\nthe country implemented a National Health Insurance\nScheme (NHIS), designed to help improve equality of\naccess to healthcare by offering affordable healthcare\nto all.\nPrior to 2005, the Ghanaian health system was orga-\nnised as a `cash and carry system' with healthcare only\nobtained after payment. This was seen as highly inequit-\nable and acted as a barrier to individuals getting timely\nand necessary treatment [3]. In response, the NHIS was\nset up which operates under a vision of being \"a model\nof a sustainable, progressive and equitable social health\ninsurance scheme in Africa and beyond\" [4] and officially\ncovers 95% of the common disease burden in its benefit\npackage. Formally, it is a mandatory system; however, no\npenalties apply for not being a member of any health in-\nsurance scheme in Ghana. Those working in the formal\nlabour sector subsidise the NHIS through an automatic\npayroll deduction [3, 5].\nPrevious research has been critical of the lack of evi-\ndence as to what influences uptake of the NHIS [6]. So\nfar studies on NHIS enrolment have mainly focused on\nyoung and middle-aged adults, but have neglected to\nconsider the extent to which these results can be gener-\nalised to older adults. For example, each of Blanchet, et\nal. [3], Ayitey, et al. [7] and Osei-Akoto and Adamba [5]\nexamined demographic and socio economic factors\nthat influence NHIS membership among adults with-\nout differentiating older adults from corresponding\nyounger generations. This paper argues that it is im-\nportant to consider younger and older adults separately\ndue to differences in demographic and socio-economic\ncharacteristics as well as differences in health and dis-\nability status.\nIt is expected that older adults will make greater use\nof the NHIS than younger age groups as older adults are\nmore vulnerable to disabilities and diseases. The 2010\nGhanaian Census showed that over 9% of older adults\nsuffer from at least one disability compared to less than\n3% of adults aged 18-49 years. Communicable diseases\nsuch as HIV and malaria are the main cause of\ndisability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) until the age of 50,\nwhile for people aged 50 plus non-communicable dis-\neases are the main cause of DALYs [8]. Furthermore,\ncompared with younger adults, the educational status\namong older adults in Ghana is relatively low [9]. These\ndifferences in user characteristics can influence the up-\ntake of health insurance significantly, which is why it is\nimportant to explore whether the correlates of NHIS en-\nrolment differ between younger and older adults.\nThere is a lack of data focusing on older adults in sub-\nSaharan Africa which can explain the scarcity of studies\nlooking at older adults in the region. Ghana has the ad-\nvantage of having two nationally representative surveys\nthat include a question on insurance coverage and sam-\nple all adults (inducing those aged 50 and over). They\nare the World Bank funded Ghanaian Living Standards\nSurvey (GLSS) and the World Health Organization\n(WHO) Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health\n(SAGE). However, there are concerns about the reliabil-\nity of different datasets for measuring NHIS enrolment,\nbringing into question the possibility of measuring\nhealth insurance coverage in Ghana accurately. Apoya\nand Marriott [10] estimated a total NHIS coverage of\nAuthority (NHIA) reported a coverage of 62% in the\ncoverage of 51% among people aged 18 and over and the\npants (aged 18 and over) had NHIS coverage.\nThe objective of this paper is to investigate the corre-\nlates of NHIS enrolment, renewal and drop out among\nolder adults, defined as those aged 50 plus, to assess\nwhether they differ from younger adults (aged 18-49). In\naddition, the paper is particularly interested in examin-\ning whether the correlates of insurance affiliation differ\ndepending on which survey is used. The correlates of\nNHIS coverage among younger and older adults are\nassessed using both the GLSS and SAGE. Comparing\ndifferent datasets to look for consistency in results, espe-\ncially relating to the determinants of enrolment, adds to\nthe evidence base for the NHIS.\nDemand patterns of insurance enrolment will reveal\nwhat factors influence the decision to partake in the\nNHIS. Knowledge of who is enrolled in the NHIS and\nwhy others are not provides an understanding as to\nwhether opportunities to enrol are equal or whether en-\nrolment patterns vary depending on socioeconomic\nstatus, sex or residence. For progress to UHC to be\nachieved in times of ageing populations, health policies\nhave to benefit all, inclusive of both younger as well as\nolder adults [12]. The findings of this paper can be used\nby policymakers to implement target-orientated policy\nmeasures to increase enrolment in the NHIS.\nEnrolment in the National Health Insurance System\nin Ghana\nIn order to become a member of the NHIS, individuals\nfirst need to register at their local district office, pay a\nregistration fee and a scaled-to-income premium. The\nhealth insurance membership ID card - which provides\nevidence of enrolment and entitles members to free use\nof care at accredited facilities - will then be provided for\nparticipants after a waiting period which can take up to\nseveral months [3]. Immediate biometric registration at\nselected district offices has been launched only recently\nto optimise the enrolment process [13]. The NHIS mem-\nbership expires after one year, meaning that each year\nmembers require a renewal of insurance membership to\nremain eligible for NHIS benefits.\nOn reaching 70 years of age, individuals are exempt\nfrom the NHIS premium payment but not from the\nregistration fee. In addition, individuals who receive a\npension from the Social Security and National Insurance\nTrust (SSNIT) are exempt from the NHIS premium\n[14]. Other groups that are exempt from paying the pre-\nmium include all children under 18 when both of their\nparents are enrolled in the NHIS, the `core poor' (de-\nfined as those with no regular source of income and no\nfixed place of residence), and pregnant women.\nMethods\nData\nThis paper uses two different datasets that aim to be na-\ntionally representative and include information on health\ninsurance coverage in Ghana: the Ghanaian Living Stan-\nsponse rate of over 93%) requesting information on all\nhousehold members at all ages. The GLSS collected spe-\ncific household level information on expenditure, in-\ncome, assets and housing conditions as well as detailed\ninformation on household members' socio-demographic\ncharacteristics, health, insurance status and employment.\nThe SAGE is a longitudinal study with the purpose of\ncollecting rich and detailed data on older adults. The sur-\nvey oversampled individuals that are aged 50 and over,\nwhile a smaller sample of individuals aged 18-49 years was\ncollected as a control group [15]. A proxy questionnaire\nwas completed for those individuals who were found to be\nunable to complete the questionnaire themselves due to\ncognition or health reasons. In the Ghanaian SAGE wave\nindividuals were interviewed during the first wave of the\nGhanaian SAGE (response rate 80%).\nMeasures\nReviewing the literature uncovers a substantial lack of\nstudies that have examined the determinants of insur-\nance coverage specifically among older adults in sub-\nSaharan Africa. Available studies have mainly focused on\nyounger adults (for example [6, 16], or [17]). Existing\nstudies informed the choice of key variables that were\nconsidered in the analysis.\nOverall life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa is still low.\nNine countries in the region still have an average life ex-\npectancy of less than 55 years [18]. Ghana has an average\nlife expectancy of 62 years and the healthy life expectancy\nat birth is 54 years [19]. For the analysis in this paper,\npeople aged 50 and above were classified as older adults.\nIt is argued that the commonly used 60 or 65 cut-off point\nfor defining an individual as an `older adult' is not appro-\npriate in the sub-Saharan African context.\nThe variable age has been transformed from a continu-\nous into a categorical variable in order to control for\nchanges in the demand for healthcare insurance among\ndifferent age groups. Akazili, et al. [17] showed that repro-\nductive age significantly affects NHIS enrolment and van\nder Wielen, et al. [20] found that age increases the likeli-\nhood of NHIS membership among older adults. Ten year\nical sense, particularly for older adults, as they distinguish\ngroups that may be differentially treated within the NHIS\nthrough regulations governing exemptions from pay-\nments. Sixty is the official retirement age in Ghana and all\npensioners under the Ghanaian SSNIT Pension Scheme\nare exempt from premium payments. Those aged 60-69\nyears who do not receive pensions and work in the infor-\nmal sector are, however, still liable for premium payments\non the NHIS. It is anticipated therefore that due to the ex-\nemptions on premiums for people aged 70 plus, a sharp\nrise in insurance membership will be observed among\nthose oldest-old adults.\nFurthermore, education can increase awareness and un-\nderstanding of the healthcare system and its advantages.\nAvailable literature shows that education positively influ-\nences the likelihood of being a member of the NHIS [7].\nThe variable education was recoded in a way that is sensi-\ntive to key milestones in the Ghanaian education system\n[21]. The variable was adjusted for changes in the school\nsystem to ensure that the school system in place when an\nolder adult went to school was taken into account.\nPrevious studies reported that living standards determine\ninsurance coverage in Ghana [5 16], with the poorest being\nleast likely to be enrolled in the NHIS. Living standards are\nmost commonly measured based on income, expenditure\nor consumption. Problems of misreporting and non-\nresponse of income components in surveys [22], as well as\nthe lack of comparable expenditure data in the two surveys,\nmake the use of proxy measures of living standards sens-\nible. Information on household assets, which have been col-\nlected in both surveys, can be used as a proxy measure of\nprosperity [23]. Thus, this paper used consumer items\n(such as bicycle, television, and car) and dwelling character-\nistics (such as drinking water, type of flooring material, and\nsanitation facilities) to measure living standards. In order to\ntake into account urban and rural differences in the distri-\nbution of assets, a wealth index was created over urban and\nrural residence using principal component analysis. Due to\nsample size issues, wealth tertiles were used.\nArea characteristics are hypothesised to affect the demand\nfor healthcare. Place of residence and region were included\nto capture regional differences. Here, it is hypothesised that\nliving in an urban area increases the likelihood of health in-\nsurance enrolment due to the greater availablity of services.\nThis is supported by Akazili, et al. [17] who found that com-\npared to urban dewellers, rural residents are signifcanlty less\nlikely to be covered by the NHIS.\nEmployment status was added to the analysis to ac-\ncount for premium exemptions for people who are con-\ntributing to the NHIS through automatic payroll\nreduction when working in the formal sector.\nOther potential control variables were not directly\ncomparable between the two surveys due to substantial\ndifferences in the questionnaire.\nThe GLSS asked about former insurance enrolment, hence\nonly the GLSS was used for the analysis of insurance re-\nenrolment and drop out. One additional variable - disability\nstatus - was added to the model looking at re-enrolment and\ninsurance drop out. Measuring health in terms of disabilities\ntries to minimise biases resulting from older adults' tendency\nto overstate their health status in surveys as they have lower\nexpectations of good health [24].\nThe coding of all control variables is summarised in\nThe characteristics of the study population using the\nSAGE and GLSS are summarised in Table 2. Table 2 high-\nlights the differences between younger and older adults in\nthe surveys used. It shows that in both surveys a higher pro-\nportion of older adults are living in rural areas compared\nwith their younger counterparts, and that older adults are\nlower educated and suffer from higher levels of disablities.\nMethods of Analysis\nThe initial analysis distinguishes between NHIS coverage\nand NHIS non-coverage. Bivariate analysis of the out-\ncome and explanatory variables highlights patterns of\nNHIS enrolment, with Pearson's Chi-squared test used\nto assess whether there is a significant association at a\n5% significance level. Binary logistic regression was then\napplied to calculate the predicted probability of falling\ninto the outcome category for different groups. Separate\nmodels were built for adults aged 18-49 and older adults\naged 50 plus using the two different surveys.\nBuilding upon this, supplementary analysis using the\nGLSS and a multinomial logistic regression model then\ndistinguished between three outcomes of insurance status:\nnever enrolled in an insurance scheme, currently insured\nunder the NHIS (reference category) and previously in-\nsured. Out of the two surveys, only the GLSS asked about\nprevious insurance enrolment, which made this supple-\nmentary analysis possible, however, findings could not be\ncompared to the SAGE.\nTable 1 Description and coding of control variables\nVariable Coding\nSex Coded dichotomously using the category male as reference.\nMarital Status Grouped into 4 categories: married/cohabiting; never married; separated/divorced and widowed.\nReference category: married/cohabiting.\nEducation Converted into 4 categories from none to tertiary education with no formal education as reference category.\nAge Treated as a categorical variable:\nYounger adults:\nOlder adults:\nEmployment status Converted into 2 categories with not currently employed in the informal sector as reference category.\nWealth Wealth tertile.

However, in contrast, the results from the\nSAGE data point to a higher level of coverage among males.\nLooking at older adults (aged 50 and over), both surveys re-\nveal a higher enrolment rate among females.\nBoth surveys confirm that wealthier individuals are\nmore likely to enrol in the NHIS (p <0.01) (Fig. 1b). This\nwas found to be true for both age groups even though\nadults aged 70 plus are exempt from the premium. 47%\nTable 2 Characteristics of the study population\nVariable Measure % N % N % N % N\nSource: SAGE 2007/2008, GLSS 2012/2013.

All descriptive statistics are based on weights controlling for a multistage\nsurvey design.\nof people aged 50 plus who belong to the poorest wealth\ntertile report NHIS coverage in the GLSS, compared to\n67% in the richest tertile. The SAGE shows a similar dif-\nferential by wealth status, with 28% of poorer older\nadults covered under the NHIS compared to 46% of rich\nolder adults.\nWith regard to residential differences, both surveys\nshow for both age groups a higher coverage in urban\nareas compared to rural areas (p <0.001) (Fig. 1c).\nRegression Results\nLogistic regression analysis was conducted for each survey\nto determine the correlates of health insurance member-\nship. Two models were fitted; one for adults aged 18-49,\nand one for older adults aged 50 plus. Results are sum-\nmarised in Tables 3 and 4 and are presented separately by\nage group. Due to the different survey sample sizes, the\npresentation of the results focuses on the direction of as-\nsociations rather than only on significance.\na\nb\nc\nFig. 1 NHIS coverage by age group and (a) gender, (b) wealth and (c) region\nIn line with the bi-variate results discussed above, Table 3\nillustrates a difference in the effect of gender across the\nsurveys.

However, in both sur-\nveys higher levels of wealth are significantly and positively\nassociated with insurance coverage. Similarly, higher\neducation is associated with a greater likelihood of being\nenrolled in an insurance scheme. Further, those working\nin the public sector are more likely to be insured under\nOlder Adults Aged 50 plus\nAmongst people aged 50 plus, Table 4 shows an increas-\ning likelihood of NHIS membership with age and wealth.\nDespite the premium exemption, richer older adults are\nstill more likely to be part of the NHIS than poorer\nTable 3 Logistic regression results: Odds ratio of NHIS coverage among adults aged 18-49\nelders. In line with the findings for younger adults, those\nworking in the formal public sector are significantly\nmore likely to be insured under the NHIS (SAGE OR: 1.\nUnlike for younger adults, marital status and place of\nresidence are found to have a significant effect on in-\nsurance enrolment for older adults when using the\nGLSS. Non-married older adults are significantly less\nlikely to enrol in the NHIS compared to their married\ncounterparts. Table 4 shows a significantly greater like-\nlihood of insurance enrolment in urban areas when\nregional effects though, the two different surveys are\nconsistent in the finding that residents of any other re-\ngion were more likely to enrol in the NHIS than those\nliving in Greater Accra.\nWhen comparing both surveys, the analysis shows\nthat the direction of association is consistent for most\nindependent variables across both surveys.\nAs a final point, Fig. 2 highlights that older adults have\na greater probability of being part of the NHIS com-\npared to younger adults. Secondly, it highlights that\namong both population groups, the probability of being\ninsured increases over time.\nTable 4 Logistic regression results: Odds ratio of NHIS coverage among adults aged 50 plus\nDeterminants of Previous Enrolment\nTables 5 and 6 present the odds ratio comparing the mul-\ntiple factors that determine current, none, and previous\ninsurance enrolment among adults aged 18-49 as well as\nadults aged 50 and over. The models give the odds ratio\nfor either having never been enrolled or dropped out, in\ncomparison with being currently enrolled.\nFigure 3 shows the predicted probability of insurance\nstatus by age group. It shows that older adults have a\nslightly lower probability of dropping out of insurance\ncoverage (14%) compared to younger adults (17%).\nDue to the premium exemption from age 70, it is of\ninterest to unpack those findings further for older adults.\nFigure 4 shows that older adults aged 70 plus have a sig-\nnificantly smaller likelihood of dropping out of insurance\ncoverage and are more likely to be currently enrolled\ncompared to other older adults aged between 50 and 69.\nFurther results once more confirm that insurance sta-\ntus is strongly related with wealth and educational sta-\ntus. For both younger and older adults the probability of\ndropping out of insurance enrolment is significantly\nhigher for the poorest and lower educated. Moreover,\nthe likelihood of dropping out of insurance enrolment\ndecreases significantly with being female for both age\ngroups. Separating the analysis between never, currently,\nand previously enrolled shows that younger and older\nadults living in rural areas are significantly more likely\nto have never been enrolled in an insurance scheme.\nDiscussion\nThe lack of social security and increasing healthcare de-\nmands in older age suggest that the establishment of com-\nprehensive universal health insurance systems may be\nparticularly valuable in ensuring equal access to healthcare\nin sub-Saharan Africa. The study carried out here ad-\nvances the literature on insurance enrolment by analysing\nfactors associated with insurance enrolment among older\nadults in Ghana as a separate population group. It indi-\ncates that correlates of insurance membership overlap be-\ntween younger and older adults with only minor\nexceptions. This suggests that healthcare reforms to in-\ncrease insurance affiliation can be beneficial across both\npopulation groups. Such a finding appears especially clear\nwhen it comes to promoting higher coverage among the\npoor. Despite scaled-to-income fees that, in theory, should\nmitigate skewed enrolment according to wealth, the find-\nings suggest that insurance enrolment increases with\nwealth. This finding confirms that of other researchers e.g.\n[7, 16, 26]. Despite the theoretical argument that health\ninsurance will improve access to healthcare, low enrol-\nment among the poorest indicates a failure of policy to en-\nsure equal access. For example, local district offices in\nGhana have been found to be charging flat premium pay-\nments across the board due to difficulties in determining\nthe socioeconomic group [27]. More research is needed\non whether the \"core poor\" and people over 70 are aware\nof the premium exemption. Awareness of social protec-\ntion schemes seems to be a problem in Ghana. Other so-\ncial protection programmes, including the Livelihood\nEmpowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), have shown low\nawareness and a low uptake [28]. More research is needed\non whether the registration fee hinders enrolment as, even\nfor those exempt from the insurance premium itself, the\nregistration fee is a requirement. Kusi and Enemark [29]\nrevealed that the registration fee imposes a burden on very\npoor households.\nIn order to overcome the gap in insurance enrolment\nbetween rich and poor, external financial support needs\nto be increased and premiums need to decrease. Gov-\nernment subsidies or donor funding are seen as one path\nto stabilizing the health finance system in the long run.\nTo increase enrolment, efforts need to be undertaken to\nensure that all people who fall below the poverty line\nand are aged 70 and over are aware of the premium\nFig. 2 Probability of current NHIS coverage by age group and survey\nexemption in the NHIS. To improve insurance cover-\nage among the poor, additional policy initiatives should\nbe considered such as travel reimbursement, particularly\nfor those living in rural areas where insurance coverage\nwas found to be low.\nAn increase in education was found to significantly in-\ncrease insurance affiliation for both younger and older\nadults. This finding underlines that of Ayitey, et al. [7]\nwho showed that with rising education, NHIS enrolment\nincreases. It is unlikely that there is a direct causal link\nbetween higher education and increased NHIS awareness\nthan 0.5% of respondents reported that they did not know\nabout the system. Also Schultz, et al. [30] found no evi-\ndence that health education increased NHIS enrolment.\nFurther research is needed to fully understand and explain\nthe differences in NHIS enrolment by education status.\nComparing NHIS coverage of 18-49 year olds by gen-\nder, the GLSS shows a higher enrolment rate among fe-\nmales compared to males. This is in line with previous\nTable 5 Multinomial logistic regression: Odds ratio of insurance status among adults aged 18-49\nNever enrolled Prev. enrolled\nresearch by Ayitey, et al. [7] who also found that the\nNHIS uptake in Ghana is greater among women com-\npared to men. However, in contrast, the results from the\nSAGE data point to a higher level of coverage among\nmales. These differences can, in part, be attributed to dif-\nferences in the timing of the fieldwork and the policy en-\nvironment. Since July 2008, all pregnant women who\nattend antenatal care in one of the NHIA accredited facil-\nities are exempt from the NHIS premium payment as they\nare automatically registered in the scheme upon arrival.\nThey and their newborn child are entitled to NHIS bene-\nfits until 3 months after the delivery [31]. The fieldwork\nfor the SAGE took place between May 2007 and June\n2008. This means that during the SAGE data collection\nperiod, the premium exemption for pregnant women was\nnot yet in place, which could account for the lower cover-\nage among women particularly in reproductive age. Both\nsurveys showed significantly lower likelihood of insurance\ndrop out among females in both age groups. Women\nmight be more aware of the benefits provided by the\nTable 6 Multinomial logistic regression: Odds ratio of insurance status among adults aged 50 plus\nNever enrolled Prev. enrolled\nNHIS as women tend to be responsible for the health and\nwellbeing of the household [6].\nWith regards to age, this study found that an increase in\nage among older adults is associated with a greater prob-\nability of being insured in the NHIS. This refers back to the\nhypothesis that people assess their health status before in-\nsurance enrolment [32] and that older adults are more\nlikely to invest in their health due to increasing usage of\nhealthcare with age. Further analysis in this paper showed\nthat older adults also had a slightly lower probability of\ndropping out of insurance coverage compared to younger\nadults. This could be due to the above-described greater\nneed of health insurance coverage with increasing age. In\naddition, older adults might have had more time to re-\nenrol after dropping out. The opportunity cost of going to\nthe district office to enrol tends to be lower for older adults\nas they are less likely to have to take a day off work.\nYounger adults tend to have less time to enrol and have\ngreater opportunity costs like missing time at work.\nFollowing this argument, older adults may also have had\nmore opportunities to enrol in the first instance. Younger\nadults may have dropped out but not yet re-enrolled as they\nneed less healthcare than older adults. Women especially\nmight not feel the need for insurance coverage after\nchildbirth.\nWhen treating the surveys as two cross-sectional sur-\nveys, they indicate an increasing trend in NHIS enrolment.\nTrends in enrolment can be attributed to changes in\nhealth polices and economic circumstances in Ghana in-\ncluding NHIS facility accreditation in 2009 to improve\nquality and access to care, free enrolment for pregnant\nwomen in 2008, economic growth and increasing per\ncapita income, and more general improvements of the\nducted, the NHIS was still a new system. Over 10 years on\nfrom its implementation, it has now been allowed some\ntime to learn from experience and improve its services.\nFinally, this paper was interested in answering the\nquestion of whether the correlates of insurance affili-\nation differ depending on which survey (GLSS or SAGE)\nFig. 3 Predicted probability of insurance status by age group\nFig. 4 Predicted probabilities of insurance status among older adults\nis used. Because of the fact that the true population\ncorrelates of insurance coverage are unknown, it is\ndifficult to estimate which of the surveys delivers more\naccurate results. Comparing survey results can, how-\never, give reassurance to analyses of the determinants of\nNHIS coverage. The findings give assurance that both\ndatasets (GLSS and SAGE) are suitable for research on\ninsurance affiliation and that both surveys produce com-\nparable results.\nConclusion\nUsing both timely and also less recent surveys indicates\nthat although the gap in coverage among rich and poor\nand urban and rural residents appears to have decreased,\nthese factors still determine NHIS coverage of younger\nand older adults. The same holds for education. Increased\nefforts are needed to ensure equal access to care in mov-\ning towards UHC. The results in this paper highlight the\nneed to introduce specific measures to target those groups\nwith low enrolment and those who are at the highest risk\nof dropping out.
