Independent interviewers assessed HIV/AIDS risk\nbehaviors using the National Institutes on Drug Abuse Risk Behavior Assessment.\nRESULTS: Fourteen years after detention (median age, 30 years), one-quarter of males and\none-tenth of females had >1 sexual partner in the past 3 months. One-tenth of participants\nreported recent unprotected vaginal sex with a high-risk partner. There were many sex and\nracial/ethnic differences. For example, African American males had 4.67 times the odds of\nhaving >1 partner than African American females (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.22\u00ad6.76).\nOver time, compared with non-Hispanic white males, African American males had 2.56\n1.24\u00ad2.12) of having multiple partners, even after adjusting for incarceration and age.\nNon-Hispanic white females were more likely to have multiple partners than racial/ethnic\nminority females.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although rates decrease over time, prevalence of sex risk behaviors are\nmuch higher than the general population. Among males, racial/ethnic minorities were\nat particular risk. The challenge for pediatric health is to address how disproportionate\nconfinement of racial/ethnic minority youth contributes to disparities in the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic.\nDepartments of aPsychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and bPreventive Medicine, Northwestern University\nFeinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois\nDrs Abram and Teplin conceptualized and designed the study, supervised the study, contributed\nto drafting and revising the article for important intellectual content, and interpreted the\nanalysis and results; Ms Stokes conceptualized and designed the study, contributed to drafting\nand revising the article for important intellectual content, conducted the statistical analysis, and\ninterpreted the analysis and results; Dr Welty conceptualized and designed the study, supervised\nthe study, contributed to drafting and revising the article for important intellectual content,\nconducted the statistical analysis, and interpreted the analysis and results; Mr Aaby contributed\nto drafting and revising the article for important intellectual content, conducted the statistical\nanalysis, and interpreted the analysis and results; and all authors approved the final manuscript\nas submitted.\nNIH\nTo cite: Abram KM, Stokes ML, Welty LJ, et al. Disparities in\nHIV/AIDS Risk Behaviors   A 14-\ninitiate HIV/AIDS risk behaviors at younger ages and\nreport more risk behaviors than those in the general\npopulation. Yet, we know little about the prevalence\nand patterns of risk behaviors after youth leave\ndetention and age into adulthood.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Although rates decrease\nover time, sex risk behaviors remain prevalent\namong detained youth as they age, especially\namong racial/ethnic minority males. The pediatric\ncommunity must address how disproportionate\nconfinement of racial/ethnic minority youth\ncontributes to HIV/AIDS health disparities.\nABRAM et al\nHIV and other sexually transmitted\ninfections (STIs) disproportionately\naffect young people. Although\n23% of the US population,1 they\naccounted for 39.9% of all new HIV\ngroup to have an increase in the\nnumber of new infections over the\nDelinquent youth are an especially\nhigh-risk population, reporting\nmore risk behaviors and initiating\nthem at younger ages than youth\nin the general population.3\u00ad15 The\nNorthwestern Juvenile Project\nfound that 95% of newly detained\nyouth reported engaging in 3 risk\nbehaviors.15 HIV/AIDS risk behaviors\nwere prevalent, irrespective of sex,\nrace/ethnicity, or age.15\nDespite their importance, we know\nlittle about the prevalence and\npatterns of risk behaviors after youth\nleave detention. We searched the\nliterature for longitudinal studies\nof delinquent youth, defined as\na follow-up of 2 years, finding\nfound that HIV/AIDS risk behaviors\npersisted with age, the studies\nexamined only a few risk behaviors\nor followed participants only through\nThis omission is critical. Racial/\nethnic minorities, especially African\nAmericans, are overrepresented\nand suffer disproportionately from\nHIV/AIDS.2,20 Although African\nAmerican youth comprise only 15%\nof the general population aged 13\nof incarcerated youth and young\nMoreover, studies of adult inmates\nindicated that delinquent youth are\nat great risk for contracting HIV/\nAIDS as they age: HIV/AIDS risk\nbehaviors are prevalent in adult\nprevalence of confirmed AIDS cases\namong adult prisoners is 2.4 times\nhigher than among adults in the\ngeneral US population.25\nThe Northwestern Juvenile Project,\nthe first large-scale longitudinal\nstudy of HIV/AIDS risk in delinquent\nyouth during adulthood, has\nmethodological strengths that\naddress the limitations of previous\ninvestigations: (1) a comprehensive\nmeasure of 15 HIV/AIDS risk\nbehaviors; (2) a lengthy follow-up\nperiod (14 years) to a median age\nof 30 years; and (3) a large sample,\nsufficiently diverse to examine\nfemales, a group increasingly\nand disparities among racial/ethnic\nminorities (African Americans and\nHispanics). We examine changes in\nthe prevalence of sex and drug risk\nbehaviors during the 14 years after\nyouth leave detention, focusing on\nsex and racial/ethnic differences.\nMETHODS\nThe most relevant information on\nour methods is summarized in this\nsection. Additional information,\navailable in the Supplemental\nMaterials, was published\nSample and Procedures\nWe recruited a stratified random\nthe Cook County Juvenile Temporary\nDetention Center (CCJTDC) in\nChicago, Illinois, between November\nCCJTDC is used for pretrial detention\nand for offenders sentenced for\n<30 days. To ensure adequate\nrepresentation of key subgroups,\nwe stratified our sample by sex,\nrace/ethnicity (African American,\nnon-Hispanic white, Hispanic, or\nyears), and legal status (processed\nin juvenile or adult court). Face-\nto-face structured interviews were\nconducted at the detention center\nin a private area, most within 2 days\nparticipants for the next 14 years.\nAt baseline, we received funding to\nadminister the HIV/AIDS measure\nto the last 800 participants enrolled\ninterview (referred to hereafter\nas \"after detention\"). In addition,\na random subsample of 997 youth\nreinterviewed 3.5 and 4 years after\ndetention. The last 800 participants\nenrolled at baseline (460 boys and\n(our design was determined, in part,\nby the funding that was available).\nParticipants were interviewed\nwhether they lived in the community\nor in correctional facilities; 80%\nof participants had an interview at\nto participate, and 180 could not be\nlocated in time for the interview).\nProcedures to Obtain Assent and\nConsent at Baseline and Follow-up\nFor all interviews, participants\nsigned either an assent form (<18\nyears old) or a consent form (18\nyears old). The Institutional Review\nBoards of Northwestern University\nand the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention approved all study\nprocedures and waived parental\nconsent for persons <18 years,\nconsistent with federal regulations\nregarding research with minimal\nMeasures and Variables\nHIV/AIDS risk behaviors were\nassessed using the National Institute\non Drug Abuse Risk Behavior\nAssessment, a reliable and valid\nmeasure of drug and sex risk\nRisk Behavior Assessment with items\nfrom Yale's AIDS Risk Inventory.33 All\nHIV/AIDS risk variables are binary\nand assessed via self-report.\nWe assessed the following variables:\nmultiple partners (>1 or >3);\nunprotected vaginal sex; unprotected\nanal sex (all assessed for the 3\nmonths before the interview); sex\nwhile drunk or high; traded sex\nfor drugs; and shared needles or\nequipment for injection drug use or\ntattooing (assessed for the 2 years\nbefore the interview).\nAs youth age into young adulthood,\nthey are more likely to have an\nexclusive sexual relationship\nwith a primary partner and thus\nstop using protection. Therefore,\nbeginning with the 10-year follow-up\ninterview, we added the following\nbehaviors (assessed 3 months\nbefore the interview): unprotected\nvaginal sex with a high-risk partner;\nunprotected anal sex with a high-\nrisk partner; unprotected sex while\ndrunk or high; and sex while drunk\nor high with a high-risk partner. As\npartner\" refers to someone whom\nthe participant identified as having\nworked as a prostitute, having HIV or\nAIDS, having injected drugs, or whose\nsexual history the participant did\nnot know well (unless specified, risk\nbehaviors may have been protected\nor unprotected).\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted by\nusing commercial software (Stata\nversion 12, Stata Corp, College\nStation, TX) with its survey routines.\nTo generate prevalence estimates\nand inferential statistics that reflect\nCCJTDC's population, each participant\nwas assigned a sampling weight\naugmented with a nonresponse\nadjustment to account for missing\ndata.\nBecause some participants were\ninterviewed more often than others,\nwe summarized prevalence at 6\ntime points: the baseline interview\nand follow-up interviews at 5, 8,\nBecause many behaviors are\nrestricted in correctional settings,\nfor each follow-up, we omitted\nfrom analyses participants who\nhad been incarcerated during the\nentire recall period. Supplemental\nTable 1 summarizes demographic\ncharacteristics and retention\ndata at 1 time points. Analyses\nassessing the effect of attrition\non generalizability are reported\nin the Supplemental Materials.\nRace/ethnicity (African American,\nHispanic, non-Hispanic white, and\nother) was self-identified.\nChanges in Prevalence as Youth Age\nWe used all available interviews, an\naverage of 6.4 interviews per person\n(range, 1\u00ad12 interviews per person).\nWe used generalized estimating\nequations (GEEs) to fit marginal\nmodels examining: (1) differences\nin the prevalence of risk behaviors\nby sex and race/ethnicity over time\nand (2) changes in risk behaviors as\nyouth aged. Unless otherwise noted,\nodds ratios (ORs) indicate sex and\nracial/ethnic differences over time.\nAll GEE models included covariates\nfor sex, race/ethnicity (African\nAmerican, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic\nwhite), aging (time since detention),\nand legal status at detention. Four\nparticipants who identified as \"other\"\nrace/ethnicity were excluded. We\nmodeled time since detention using\nrestricted cubic splines with 2\ninterior knots. When main effects\nwere significant, we estimated\nmodels with the corresponding\ninteraction terms. Only statistically\nsignificant interaction terms were\nincluded in final models. For models\nwith significant interactions between\nsex and aging, we report model-based\nand 14 years after detention. Because\ndisproportionate incarceration may\nconfound racial/ethnic differences\nin HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, all\nmodels included the length of time\nincarcerated (days) during the recall\nperiod and an indicator for living\nentirely in the community (yes/\nno). All GEE models were estimated\nwith sampling weights to account for\nstudy design.\nRESULTS\nFigures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate sex and\nracial/ethnic differences over time\nfor multiple partners, unprotected\nsex, and sex while drunk or high,\nrespectively. Supplemental Tables\n2\u00ad4 provide the specific prevalence\nestimates shown in the figures.\nSupplemental Table 5 shows\nthe percentage of participants\nwho reported risk behaviors in\nhalf or more of their interviews.\nSupplemental Tables 6\u00ad8 show\nadjusted ORs and 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) examining (1) changes\nin prevalence as youth age and (2)\nsex and racial/ethnic differences in\nprevalence over time. We discuss\nsignificant findings by category of\nHIV/AIDS risk behavior.\nMultiple Partners\nPrevalence (>1 or >3 partners)\ndecreased as participants aged (Fig\n1), although prevalence remained\nnotable: 14 years after detention,\nnearly 1 in 10 females and more\nthan one-quarter of males reported\nhaving >1 partner in the past 3\nmonths (Supplemental Table 2).\nAmong males, 52% reported multiple\npartners, with 18% reporting >3\npartners, at half or more of their\ninterviews. Among females, only\n13% reported multiple partners\nat half or more of their interviews\n(Supplemental Table 5). The rate of\nthe decline in multiple partners (>1)\ndepended on sex and race/ethnicity\n(Supplemental Tables 3 and 4).\nSex Differences\nAmong minorities, males were more\nlikely to have multiple partners (>1\nor >3) than females. For example,\n14 years after detention, African\nthe odds of having >1 partner than\nABRAM et al\nAfrican American females (95%\n3.43 times the odds compared with\n(Supplemental Table 6).\nRacial/Ethnic Differences\nAmong males as they aged, African\nAmerican youth had the highest\nprevalence of multiple partners\n(>1 or >3), followed by Hispanic,\nthen non-Hispanic white youth\n(Supplemental Table 6). Minority\nfemales had a lower prevalence of\nmultiple partners (>1) compared\nwith non-Hispanic white females\n(Supplemental Table 6).\nUnprotected Vaginal Sex\nFigure 2 (top panel) illustrates\nsex and racial/ethnic differences\nin unprotected vaginal sex and\nunprotected vaginal sex with a high-\nrisk partner (see also Supplemental\nTables 2\u00ad4). Unprotected vaginal\nsex was common: 14 years after\ndetention, more than two-thirds of\nmales and more than half of females\nreported this behavior. Unprotected\nvaginal sex with a high-risk partner\nwas less common, reported by about 1\ndetention. Overall, 17% of males and\n8% of females reported this behavior\nat more than half of their follow-up\ninterviews (Supplemental Table 5).\nThe prevalence of unprotected vaginal\nsex generally increased over time, but\nthe rate of increase depended on sex\nand race/ethnicity.\nSex Differences\nAt detention, males were less likely\nto have unprotected vaginal sex\nthan females, regardless of race/\nethnicity (Supplemental Table 6).\nHowever, among African American\nparticipants, males were more likely\nthan females to report unprotected\nvaginal sex as they aged.\nRacial/Ethnic Differences\nUnprotected vaginal sex was more\ncommon among Hispanic males\ncompared with non-Hispanic white and\nAfrican American males (Supplemental\nTable 6). Unprotected vaginal sex was\nmore common among Hispanic and\nnon-Hispanic white females compared\nwith African American females\n(Supplemental Table 6).\nUnprotected Anal Sex\nAnal sex risk behaviors (unprotected\nanal sex and unprotected anal sex\nPrevalence of multiple partners in delinquent youth from detention (baseline) through 14 years: sex and racial/ethnic differences.\nwith a high-risk partner) were among\nthe least prevalent sex risk behaviors,\nand prevalence remained stable over\ntime (Fig 2, bottom panel). Fourteen\nyears after detention, prevalence of\nunprotected anal sex was 8% among\nmales and 3.5% among females; <1%\nof participants reported unprotected\nanal sex with a high-risk partner.\nCompared with females, males\nhad 1.77 times the odds of having\nunprotected anal sex (95% CI,\nSex While Drunk or High\nFigure 3 illustrates sex and racial/\nethnic differences. Having sex\nwhile drunk or high was among the\nmost common risk behaviors, as\nwas the riskier behavior of having\nunprotected sex while drunk or high:\n14 years after detention, almost\nhalf of males and more than one-\nquarter of females reported having\nunprotected sex while drunk or high\n(Supplemental Table 2). Having sex\nwhile drunk or high with a high-\nrisk partner was less prevalent:\nfemales. Overall, 8% of males and\n3% of females reported this behavior\nat more than half of their follow-up\ninterviews (Supplemental Table 5).\nSex Differences\nHaving sex while drunk or high\nwas more prevalent among males\nthan females; the magnitude of\nthe difference depended on race/\nethnicity and time since detention\n(Supplemental Table 8). Males also\nhad higher prevalence of having\nunprotected sex while drunk or high\nthan females (Supplemental\nRacial/Ethnic Differences\nNon-Hispanic white females had\n1.52 times greater odds of having\nsex while drunk or high than\nAfrican American females (95% CI,\nthan Hispanic females (95% CI,\nTrading Sex and Drugs\nTrading sex and drugs was\ninfrequent: at most follow-ups, <1%\nof participants reported trading sex\nand drugs during the past 2 years\n(Supplemental Table 2).

Fourteen years after\ndetention, no males and <1% of\nfemales reported sharing needles.\nAs they agreed, Hispanic youth\nwere more likely to have shared\nneedles than African American youth\n(Supplemental Table 8).\nMultiple Risk Behaviors\nBecause engaging in >1 risk behavior\nmay make youth more vulnerable\nto HIV/AIDS, we also examined the\nprevalence of multiple behaviors\nduring the past 3 months. Figure\n4 illustrates sex and racial/ethnic\ndifferences in the overlap of 3 types\nof risk behaviors: multiple partners,\nunprotected sex with a high-risk\npartner, and risky sex while drunk\nor high (unprotected or with a high-\nrisk partner). Prevalence estimates\nare for the 14-year interview, with\nrisk behaviors assessed for the past 3\nmonths.\nThere was substantial overlap among\nthe 3 types of behaviors for males:\nabout 19% of African American and\nHispanic males and 14% of non-\nHispanic white males engaged in 2\ntypes of risky behavior during the\npast 3 months.\nIn contrast, 8% of African American,\n5% of Hispanic, and 12% of non-\nHispanic white females engaged in at\nleast 2 of the behaviors. About 7% of\nnon-Hispanic white females engaged\nin all 3 behaviors, compared with 1%\nof African American females and no\nHispanic females.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the general population, the\nprevalence of HIV/AIDS risk\nbehaviors peaks in the early 20s\nand gradually declines over time,36\na pattern also found in our sample.\nYet, although the prevalence of\nmost risk behaviors declined with\nage, delinquent youth continue to\nbe at great risk for HIV and other\nSTIs, particularly for behaviors\nassociated with heterosexual contact.\nFourteen years after detention,\nwhen participants were a median\nPrevalence of sex while drunk or high in delinquent youth from detention (baseline) through 14 years: sex and racial/ethnic differences.

In contrast, in a national\nsample of young adults ages 15 to\nfemales reported having >1 partner\nin the past year.37 Moreover, one-\ntenth of males and females in our\nsample reported recent unprotected\nvaginal sex with a high-risk partner.\nUnprotected vaginal sex poses an\neven higher risk for females than for\nmales.38 Heterosexual sex is now the\nmost common route of transmission\nfor HIV/AIDS and STIs in the United\nStates for females overall (87% of\nnew infections2) and for females in\ncorrectional facilities (64% of new\nRisk behaviors associated with\nalcohol and noninjection drug\nuse were common as youth aged.\nFourteen years after detention,\nnearly half of males and more than\none-quarter of females reported\nhaving unprotected sex while\ndrunk or high in the past 3 months.\nSubstance use can increase the\nchance for risky sexual behaviors\nby compromising judgment,\nreducing condom use, and\ncompromising the correct use of\nAmong males, we found many\nracial/ethnic differences in the\nprevalence of risk behaviors. Even\nafter adjusting for incarceration\nand age, African American males\nhad the highest prevalence of\nmultiple partners compared with\nHispanic and non-Hispanic white\nmales. This disparity mirrors\ntrends among males in the general\npopulation, where African American\nsignificantly more likely to have\nmultiple sex partners than other\nracial/ethnic groups. We also found\nthat as they aged, Hispanic males\nwere more likely than non-Hispanic\nwhite males to have multiple\npartners and more likely than\nmales of other racial/ethnic\ngroups to have unprotected\nvaginal sex. Our findings on Hispanic\nmales are of particular concern.\nHispanic people comprise 17%\nof the US population, but accounted\nfor 22.7% of new HIV infections\nHispanic people, males comprised\n85% of new HIV infections\nAmong females, however, non-\nHispanic white youth were more\nlikely than minority youth to have\nmultiple partners and to have\nsex while drunk or high, as they\nagreed. This may be because, in our\nsample, substance use disorders,\na risk factor for many behaviors,\nare more common in non-Hispanic\nwhite females than in racial/ethnic\nminority females.44 Of note, as in\nthe general population,45 African\nAmerican females in our sample had\nPrevalence of specific and co-occurring HIV/AIDS risk behaviors in delinquent youth 14 years after detention: sex and racial/ethnic differences. a Does not\nsum due to rounding error.\nABRAM et al\na lower prevalence of many sex risk\nbehaviors than non-Hispanic white\nfemales.

The\nCenters for Disease Control and\nPrevention recommends that,\nwith the adolescent's consent,\npediatricians should conduct\nHIV and STI tests annually for\nhigh-risk youth.56 Pediatricians\nshould also conduct risk-reduction\ncounseling in an atmosphere\nshould include the assessment\nof sexual and substance use\nhistory, education about risks,\nand support for safe behaviors.57\nStrength-based interventions58\nand motivational interviewing\ntechniques59 could increase the\nadolescent's intrinsic motivation\nto change.\n3.
