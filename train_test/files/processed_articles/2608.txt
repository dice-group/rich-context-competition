Gwaltney\nCarnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and the Center\nfor Prevention of Disease and Injury, University of Virginia School of\nMedicine, Charlottesville, Virginia\nThis double-blind study determined the influence of serum neutralizing antibody titers on the\nrate of infection and magnitude of disease expression after experimental exposure of adult volunteers\nto rhinovirus strain Hanks (RV-H). A total of 133 healthy volunteers were tested for antibody status,\ncloistered for a 6-day period, and challenged with RV-H at the end of the first cloister day. On\nthese days, response to viral challenge is assessed with symptom diaries and physical examinations.\nThe low-titer infected group was significantly different from the intermediate-titer infected and the\nuninfected groups in terms of postchallenge nasal and throat symptoms, expelled secretion weights,\nnasal mucociliary clearance rates, and frequency of negative middle ear pressures. A similar trend\nheld for the infected high-titer vs. low-titer group comparisons. These data show that high homotypic\nserum neutralizing antibody titers are associated with protection from infection and lessened signs\nand symptoms following experimental RV-H exposure.\nUpper respiratory infection (URI) is the most common dis- symptoms, signs, pathophysiologies, and complications follow-\ning experimental exposure to two rhinovirus strains.
