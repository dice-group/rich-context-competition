Indicative of blood testosterone levels and fat-free body\nmass, HGS is also highly sexually dimorphic. Recent psychological research shows that\nHGS is correlated with a number of social variables, but only in males. We conducted\nthree studies to further investigate the relationship between HGS and measures of\naggression and social competition among adolescents. Consistent with previous reports,\ncorrelations were almost exclusive to males, but this was only visible during late\nadolescence (i.e., high school). These findings support evolutionary hypotheses regarding\ngrip strength in male-male competition and suggest that similar to measures of testosterone,\nHGS is a measure that is predictive of social behavior in older adolescent males.\n",

The origin\nof bipedal locomotion in African late Miocene/early Pliocene hominins (Richmond and\nJungers, 2008; Lovejoy, Suwa, Spurlock, Asfaw, and White, 2009) released the hominin\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\nupper limb from its primary ancestral role in arboreal locomotion and opened the\nopportunity for derived behaviors such as carrying and manipulating objects in the\nenvironment (Marzke, 1999). These new behaviors (tool usage, tool manufacture, and\nobject transport) created selective pressures that acted to modify hominin hand morphology\nand enable a wider array of power and precision grips (Marzke and Marzke, 2000; Young,\n2003). This flexible and powerful gripping ability continues to be an important element of\nmodern human behavior.\nRecent research has demonstrated an association between hand grip strength (HGS)\nand indicators of fitness in contemporary college-age males (Gallup, White, and Gallup,\n2007; Shoup and Gallup, 2008), suggesting that HGS may be used as a measure of variance\nin male intrasexual competition during adolescence. The maintenance and elaboration of\nHGS in human males may have provided a selective advantage to stronger individuals\ncompeting for scarce resources (Gallup et al., 2007). Young (2003) hypothesized that the\nselection for improved handheld clubbing prowess for protection, hunting and intrasexual\ncompetition led to anatomical changes resulting in powerful HGS among males. While\nsome of these selective pressures are less prevalent in modern society, it appears this\nhistory has resulted in HGS's association with other sexually selected traits in males,\nincluding facial attractiveness (Shoup and Gallup, 2008), mating opportunities, masculine-\nspecific body morphology, and intrasexual adolescent aggression (Gallup et al., 2007).\nIndependent of the proposed relationship with male social behavior, HGS measured\nby a hand-held dynamometer is also an easily obtainable measure of physical health and\nmuscle function. Within adult populations, HGS is also a good predictor of health\nparameters such as protein loss (Windsor and Hill, 1988), bone-mineral density (Kritz-\nSilverstein and Barrett-Connor, 1994; Foo, Zhang, Zhu, Ma, Greenfield, and Fraser, 2007;\nSinaki, Wahner, and Offord, 1989), muscle mass (Kallman, Plato, and Tobin, 1990;\nGuimaraes, Carlsson, and Marie, 2007), physical functioning (Fredericksen et al., 2002;\nStenholm, Rantanen, Heliovaara, and Koskinen, 2008; Arroyo, Lera, Sanchez, Bunout,\nSantos, and Albala, 2007), and is negatively correlated with disability (Giampaoli et al.,\nmortality rates in adults (Laukkanen, Heikkinen, and Kauppinen, 1995; Rantanen et al.,\nAlthough diet and exercise contribute to one's HGS, a twin study of 1,757 pairs\nshowed it is highly heritable after adjusting for effects of sex, weight, height and age (h2 =\n0.50, see Frederiksen et al., 2002). Likewise, these authors report no evidence for a\nsubstantial effect of nonadditive genetic factors or shared environment. Other smaller twin\nstudies vary in the degree of genetic influence. Arden and Spector (1997) show the\nheritability of HGS to be lower among females (h2 = 0.36 after controlling for age, height\nand weight), while Reed, Fabsitz, Selby, and Carmelli (1991) estimate the heritability of\nmale HGS to be 0.65 after adjustments of weight, height, age, and various anthropometric\nmeasures such as fatness, muscle mass and frame size.\nDespite the presence of these correlations for each sex, research has shown striking\nsex differences in HGS among adult populations, with males far outscoring females\n(Kamarul, Ahmad, and Loh, 2006; Mathiowetz, Kashman, Volland, Weber, Dowe, and\nRogers, 1985). Additionally, senescence accounts for a larger percentage of the variation\nin HGS in men, with male HGS declining more quickly after age 30 (Vianna, Oliveira, and\nAraujo, 2007). Sex differences have also been observed in forebrain and cardiac\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\nsympathetic nervous responses at the onset of handgrip exercise (Wong, Kimmerly, Masse,\nMenon, Cechetto, and Shoemaker, 2007), with smaller cardiovascular response (heart rate\nand mean arterial pressure) and weaker insular cortex activation observed in women.\nInterestingly, this may reflect both physiological and psychological sex differences when\nasked to provide a maximum squeeze of a dynamometer. While greater height, weight, and\nmuscle mass in males has been submitted as an explanation for this effect (Kallman et al.,\nhormones (i.e., testosterone) may be the responsible factor. For instance, men with reduced\ntestosterone levels caused by androgen deprivation have been shown to have low grip\nstrength (Soyupek, Soyupek, Perk, and Ozorak, 2008), and supplementary increases in\ntestosterone enhance HGS as well as lean body mass in elderly men with low serum T\nThis hormonal relationship may, in turn, explain HGS's association with indicators\nof male-male competition. Meta-reviews have demonstrated a positive relationship\nbetween testosterone and aggression (Book, Stazyk, and Quinsey, 2001), with this link\noften being more clear among males than females (Archer, 1994). In particular, research\non male adolescents (15-17 years) has shown a strong relationship between testosterone\nand levels of verbal and physical aggression (Olweus, Mattsson, Schalling, and Low,\n1980). This same effect is absent in studies of boys before and at the beginning of puberty\n(10-14 years), when they have not yet experienced an influx of testosterone and\nreproductive behaviors are less salient (Susman, Inoff-Germain, Nottelmann, Loraiux,\nDutler, and Chrousos, 1987; Inoff-Germain, Arnold, Nottelmann,, Susman, Cutler, and\nChrousos, 1988). Dominance is also positively correlated with testosterone levels in adult\nmales (Mazur and Booth, 1998), and the act of competing for dominant status can increase\ntestosterone for the winner, while decreasing it for the loser. Although testosterone levels\nare not associated with levels of aggression in younger males (aged 10-14 years), they did\npredict perceived dominance in a population of 6-13 year old males (Schaal, Tremblay,\nSoussignan, and Susman, 1996). Following a connection with testosterone, studies\ninvestigating HGS and aggression show that the two positively correlate in late adolescent\nand adult males (Gallup et al., 2007; Archer and Thanzami, 2007). To our knowledge,\nhowever, HGS has not yet been used in studying peer aggression, dominance, and social\ncompetition among younger adolescents.\nThe current research presents three studies investigating whether individual\ndifferences in HGS account for any of the observed variance in measures of social\ncompetition (i.e., aggression, popularity, dominance) among males and females. In the first\nstudy, HGS was collected from ninth grade high school students who also self-reported\ntheir involvement in peer aggression and victimization during middle school. The second\nstudy used the same methodology as in Study 1, but examined the retrospective high school\nexperiences of college-aged students. Both studies also investigated the relationship\nbetween HGS and perceived popularity. The third study investigated the relationship\nbetween the HGS of twelfth grade students and independent ratings of relative peer\naggressiveness and social dominance as perceived by individuals observing their yearbook\nphotos. Based on previous research indicating a relationship between HGS, health and\nattractiveness, independent ratings of physical attractiveness and health were also collected.\nAlthough this third study did not directly measure behavior of the students, it served as a\nunique test for whether the underlying physiological features responsible for HGS also\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\ninfluence outside perceptions of aggression and dominance. We hypothesized that HGS\nwould be positively correlated with peer aggression and negatively associated with peer\nvictimization for males, while we did not expect to find a relationship for females.\nLikewise, we predicted HGS would correlate positively with independent ratings of\naggressiveness and social dominance in males only. General discussion of these studies\nwill address evolutionary interpretations regarding intrasexual competition and sexual\nselection.\nStudy 1: Handgrip strength and self-reported aggressive behavior and popularity\nduring middle school\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\npublic high school in upstate New York. Participation in this research was completely\nvoluntary, and responses were held anonymous. This research was approved by the district\nsuperintendent and the University Institutional Review Board.\nSurvey\nTeachers administered a social experiences survey (slightly modified from\nNewman, Holden, and Delville, 2005) to their freshman students during homeroom class\nearly in the fall semester. Questions included how often they were a victim or perpetrator\nof (a) physical aggression (hitting, kicking, physical intimidation) (b) demeaning,\ndiminishing and embarrassing behavior, (c) isolation, and (d) exclusion during middle\nschool (victimization:  = .82; aggression:  = .82). Responses were recorded on a 5-point\nLikert scale (1 = not at all, 2 = once or twice, 3 = occasionally, 4 = frequently, 5 = very\noften), and for each set of questions participants were asked to identify whether the\naggressor or victim was more often a male or female. Composite scores were calculated\nfor total aggression and victimization during middle school (min 4, max 20). They also\nrated their popularity with their peers during middle school (1 = not at all, 2 = a little\npopular, 3 = somewhat popular, 4 = fairly popular, 5 = very popular).\nAnthropometrics and Analysis\nParticipants from grades 9-12 were shown how to use a handheld dynamometer\n(Lafayette Instruments model 78010) during a yearly health screening session; however, we\nwere only able to obtain survey data from ninth graders. Each subject was instructed to\nsqueeze the dynamometer as hard as possible with one hand and then the other.\nMeasurements were recorded (in kilograms) on two separate squeezes from each hand,\nalternating between right and left. Each squeeze was rounded to the nearest kilogram, and\nthe maximum HGS of the two trials was recorded. The subsequent analyses used the\naverage of the maximum HGS for each hand. Due to past research indicating a positive\nrelationship between HGS and age among adolescents (Mathiowetz, Wiemer, and\nFederman, 1986), we controlled for age using partial correlations to analyze HGS in\nrelation to peer aggression/victimization and popularity. Likewise, based on further data\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\nprovided by nursing staff following the health screening session, we also controlled for\neffects of body mass index (BMI).\nResults\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics of HGS and peer social experiences for both\nmales and females. Sex differences in HGS are in accord with results from previous\nresults indicate that the majority of aggressive peer interactions were intrasexual, with\n75.59% of females reporting aggression described the interactions as predominantly with\nmembers of the same sex. Twenty-one males and 11 females reported not being aggressive\nor victimized on any level during middle school. These individuals were included in the\nsubsequent analyses.\nTable 1.

Victimization and aggression composite scores range from 4 to 20, while popularity ranges from 1 to 5.\nTable 2 shows the partial correlations between HGS and peer\naggression/victimization while controlling for age and BMI. Self-reported peer aggression\nand victimization was not correlated with HGS in either sex.\nTable 2.

Males are represented above the diagonal (-) and females are represented below.\nPerceived popularity was not correlated with HGS among males, but it was\npositively correlated with HGS in females (r = .302, p < .05). Likewise, perceived\npopularity was positively correlated with self-reported peer aggression in females (r = .343,\np < .01), but not males. Pellegrini and Long (2003) witnessed a similar positive\nrelationship among female middle school students in regards to aggression and dating\npopularity. On the other hand, perceived popularity was negatively correlated with peer\nvictimization in males (r = -.410, p < .001), but not females. Self-reported peer aggression\nand victimization were highly intercorrelated in females (r = .489, p < .001), but this was\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\nStudy 2: Handgrip strength and self-reported aggressive behavior and popularity\nduring high school\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThis study included 65 male and 52 female undergraduates at a mid-sized public\nuniversity in upstate New York. All participants were students in an introductory biology\nSD = 1.30). Participation was voluntary and all responses were held anonymous. The\nUniversity Institutional Review Board approved this research and each individual gave\nconsent for their participation in this study.\nSurvey\nThe same social experiences survey was given as in Study 1, but participants were\nasked to respond according to their experiences during high school (victimization:  = .66;\naggression:  = .74). Responses were recorded on the same 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at\nall, 2 = once or twice, 3 = occasionally, 4 = frequently, 5 =very often), and for each set of\nquestions participants identified whether the aggressor or victim was more often a male or\nfemale. As in Study 1, aggression and victimization composite scores were calculated as\nan index of overall aggression and victimization across high school (min 4, max 20).\nSimilarly, a question was asked about how popular they were with their peers during high\nschool (1 = not at all, 2 = a little popular, 3 = somewhat popular, 4 = fairly popular, 5 =\nvery popular).\nAnthropometrics and Analysis\nSimilar to Study 1, participants were shown how to use a hand-held dynamometer\n(Lafayette Instruments model 78010). Due to more available time, measurements were\nrecorded on three separate squeezes from each hand, the maximum HGS of the three trials\nwas recorded (in kilograms), and the subsequent analysis used the average of the maximum\nHGS for each hand. In addition, unlike the previous study, data was not collected on\nparticipant BMI. Therefore, analyses only controlled for effects of age using a partial\ncorrelation between HGS and peer aggression/victimization and popularity scores.\nResults\nTable 3 shows the descriptive statistics of HGS and retrospective peer aggression\nand victimization among male and female college students. Consistent with both\nprevious research and the first study, males had a stronger HGS than females (t (115) =\nthat 90.10% of males and 81.98% of females reporting victimization stated that it was\npredominantly intrasexual, which was also true for 95.83% of males 86.09% of females\nreporting aggressive behavior. Four males and nine females reported not being\naggressive or victimized on any level during high school. These individuals were\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\nincluded in the subsequent analyses.\nTable 3.

Victimization and aggression composite scores range from 4 to 20, while popularity ranges from 1 to 5.\nPearson correlations between HGS and peer aggression/victimization and\npopularity are shown in Table 4. In males, individuals with higher HGS reported\nsignificantly lower levels of peer victimization during high school (r = -.430, p < .001),\nand perceived themselves as more popular during high school (r = .327, p < .05). There\nwas no relationship between male HGS and peer aggression. In females, HGS was not\ncorrelated with peer victimization or popularity levels during high school. There was a\npositive trend between HGS and female aggression, but this was not statistically\nsignificant (r = .277, p = .052). Popularity levels were negatively correlated with reported\nand as in Study 1, self-reported peer aggression and victimization were positively\nTable 4.

Participants\nincluded six undergraduate and three graduate students from three separate institutions in\nupstate New York. None of the raters had ever lived in the same county of the high school\npopulation, and no one reported recognizing any of the high school students. Participation\nwas anonymous and completely voluntary. This research was approved by the University\nInstitutional Review Board.\nQuestionnaire\nA yearbook was obtained from the same high school as in Study 1. Individual\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\nsenior portraits (6.35cm x 4.45cm) included the face, neck and shoulders of each student. In\n.45) twelfth grade students were included in the analysis. Clothing was partially\nstandardized as all males wore a collared shirt and a tie, and all females wore the same\nblack, v-necked blouse; however, make-up and hair styles varied between individuals.\nStudent names were removed and pages were scanned and presented as a packet.\nIndividual photos were assigned an arbitrary number and the order of yearbook photo\npresentation was randomized across raters using Microsoft Excel. Raters were asked to\nrespond on a 7-point Likert scale to the following questions about each student: (1) how\naggressive do you think this person is among their peers? ( = .75), (2) how dominant do\nyou think this person is among their peers? ( = .77), (3) how physically attractive do you\nfind this person? ( = .88), and (4) how healthy do you think this person is? ( = .79). For\neach measure, all ratings of an individual were then summed (min 9, max 63).\nAnthropometrics and Analysis\nGrip strength was recorded during the same health screening session as in Study 1.\nSimilar to the Study 1, analyses between HGS and ratings of aggressiveness, dominance,\nattractiveness and health were conducted using partial correlations controlling for age and\nResults\nTable 5 shows the descriptive statistics for HGS and ratings of aggression and\ndominance among male and female 12th grade high school students. As with the previous\n2.70). Table 6 shows the partial correlations controlling for age and BMI between\nyearbook photo ratings and HGS in males and females. Males with higher HGS were rated\ntheir peers (r = .281, p < .05). There was a positive trend between HGS and ratings of male\nattractiveness, but it was not statistically significant (r = .205, p = .099).\nTable 5. Descriptive statistics (M \u00b1 SD) for HGS among males (N = 69) and females (N =\nRight HGS Left HGS Aggressive Dominant Attractive Healthy\nNote. Outside ratings of aggression, dominance, attractiveness, and health range from 1 to 7.\nIn marked contrast, ratings of female photos were unrelated to HGS on all\nmeasures. It is important to note that ratings of aggressiveness and social dominance were\nhighly intercorrelated across both sexes (r > .75, p < .001 for both), suggesting that ratings\non these traits were actually part of a single aspect of personality perception. Similarly, in\nboth sexes ratings of health and attractiveness were strongly intercorrelated (r > .75, p <\n.001). Each was also associated with perceptions of dominance in both sexes (p < .001),\nbut the relationship was considerably stronger in males. Ratings of aggression and health\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\nwere correlated in males (r = .332, p < 0.01) but not females, and attractiveness and\naggression were not correlated in either sex. If we condensed these four measures into two\nfactors (aggression-dominance and health-attractiveness), both were positively correlated\nwith HGS among males (aggression-dominance: r = .318, p < .01; health-attractiveness: r =\n.244, p < .05), while there remains no relationship with HGS among females (aggression-\nTable 6. Correlations between HGS and perceived ratings of twelfth grade student\nportraits.\nHGS Aggressive Dominant Attractive Healthy\nNote. Males are represented above the diagonal (-) and females are represented below.\nDiscussion\nThe findings from these three studies are consistent with recent evolutionary\nhypotheses predicting that characteristics either connected with or developmentally linked\nto HGS are important in male-male social competition and sexual selection (Gallup et al.,\n2007; Young, 2003). This research indicates that HGS, a simple and easily obtainable\nmeasure of overall strength and muscle function, is in fact an informative variable related\nto adolescent social behavior, and thus remains valuable in studying human behavior from\nan evolutionary perspective.\nMeasures of socially dominant behavior and appearance were significantly\ncorrelated with HGS in males, but this was only true during late adolescence (i.e., high\nschool). In the first study, HGS was unrelated to measures of aggression and victimization\nduring middle school in both male and female ninth graders. In the second study, male\ncollege students with higher HGS reported fewer instances of intrasexual peer victimization\nduring high school, and perceived themselves as more popular. In the third study, raters\nobserving only yearbook photos perceived twelfth grade males with higher HGS as being\nmore aggressive, more dominant and healthier. For females, the only significant\ncorrelation with HGS was in Study 1, revealing a positive correlation between HGS and\nperceived popularity. It remains unclear why this association was present for females and\nnot males, but future research should examine variables contributing to middle school\npopularity that may also be associated with HGS (see Eder and Kinney, 1995). Overall,\nthese findings are consistent with previous research indicating that HGS is related to\nsocially dominant behaviors and appearance nearly exclusively in males. These sex\ndifferences are likely related to the sexually dimorphic expression of aggression among\nadolescents (Archer, 2004), with males typically using direct, physical forms of aggression\ncompared to females, and therefore physical strength should contribute to this effect.\nInterestingly, Study 1 revealed no relationship between male HGS and the observed\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\nsocial variables during middle school. These results match up with those showing a lack of\na relationship between testosterone and aggression among younger adolescent males aged\naggression is known to decrease during adolescent development (Brame, Nagin, and\nTremblay, 2001), our data suggests that the importance of physical strength may increase in\ncompetitive social contexts during high school when reproductive activities are more\nsalient. In other words, a male's overall strength or androgenic development (i.e.,\nmasculine-specific body configuration) may be more central to social competition during\nhigh school, as these features become more pronounced with advanced pubertal\ndevelopment and the disparity among physical size and stature decreases. It is possible that\nthe variation in physical maturation among early adolescent boys makes HGS an unreliable\nmeasure of social competition during middle school. In other words, the implicit\nawareness that some boys have not yet had their growth spurt may play a more pronounced\nrole in male-male physical competition.\nWe suggest the relevance of HGS to late adolescent social experiences almost\ncertainly lies in relation to physiological, developmental, and genetic underpinnings. In\nturn, we propose that blood testosterone levels may be the foremost contributing factor to\nthe observed variation in HGS among adult males. Consistent with this view, testosterone\nlevels have been positively linked to both male aggression (Book et al., 2001) and\ndominance (Mazur and Booth, 1998). Likewise, testosterone levels have been shown to\nincrease dramatically with initial pubertal development in males (115 ng/dl at age 13 to 364\nng/dl at age 15, see Rowe, Maughan, Worthman, Costello, and Angold, 2004), and in our\nsample there was a strong positive correlation between male HGS and age among ninth\nwith the findings from Study 3, previous research has revealed that the faces of males with\nhigh testosterone are also perceived as more dominant (Swaddle and Reierson, 2002).\nLikewise, the overall results find HGS to predict similar socially dominant behaviors with\nreported links to testosterone levels in post-pubescent males only (Inoff-Germain et al.,\nand social dominance actually predicted a male's HGS signifies that not only is one's initial\nperceived personality correlated to underlying physiological features, but this may be what\nultimately provides the observer with the information necessary to make adaptive social\ndecisions. It remains unknown whether raters based their decisions on specific facial\nfeatures or if other aspects of body morphology present within the photos (e.g., shoulder\nbreadth) contributed to their perceptions. These issues notwithstanding, past research\nshows that a male's HGS is predictive of facial characteristics (Shoup and Gallup, 2008)\nand shoulder breadth and circumference (Gallup et al., 2007). Therefore, it is not\nnecessarily important that the exact features used for rating are identified, and instead, it is\nlikely that raters used a combination of visual cues.\nPrevious research has indicated that features associated with or directly linked to\nHGS may be under sexual selection, as HGS correlates with earlier sexual activity and\nmore sexual partners in males (Gallup et al., 2007). The current research suggests that\nthese reproductive advantages may be gained at least partially through social dominance, a\ntrait that is cross-culturally preferred by females seeking mates (Shackelford, Schmitt, and\nBuss, 2003). Older males with higher HGS reported lower intrasexual peer victimization,\nhigher popularity levels, and were rated as more aggressive and dominant compared to their\nHandgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior\npeers. Taken together, these variables may serve as a proxy for social dominance during\nadolescence. Consistent with this interpretation, past research reveals perceived dominance\nto be a strong predictor of sexual activity in adolescent males (Mazur, Halpern, and Urdy,\nSome limitations to this research include the fact that these social variables were not\ndirectly observed, and instead were either self-reported in a survey or perceived through\noutside raters. As a result this may not reflect actual aggressive or dominant behaviors of\nthe adolescents. We also did not investigate motives behind peer aggression or to what\ndegree physical strength and prowess was involved in aggressive or dominant interactions.\nHowever, the current research does offer insight into sex differences in physical strength\nand socially dominant behaviors during distinct periods of adolescent development, and\nfurther supports previous research showing strong sex differences in the relationship\nbetween HGS and social variables. In addition, the results provide evidence that changes in\nHGS may accurately reflect changes in testosterone levels, due to consistency in how these\nvariables reliably predict aggression and dominance among older, but not younger\nadolescent males. In order to more directly test these hypotheses, future research should\nmeasure aggressive behavior through a combination of survey use and ethnographic\nmethodology, and directly investigate the correlation between HGS and testosterone across\nage ranges. Previous research already supports this connection, revealing a positive\nrelationship between serum testosterone and the development of strength parameters\n(including HGS) in adolescent males aged 10-12 years (Hansen, Bangsbo, Twisk and\nAlthough HGS was the only morphological measurement taken in these studies, it is\nimportant to note that features such as overall larger body size and masculine specific body\nmorphology (which are also associated with higher testosterone levels) may be contributing\nfactors, and therefore could also be collected in future research. However, we argue that\nwhen considering HGS in terms of male-male competition and dominance, that it can be\ndone independent of body configuration because unlike HGS, large body size is unrelated\nto health and vitality. In addition, it is not simply size and appearance that facilitate social\ncompetition and dominance in males, but a combination of physical prowess, vitality, and\nsocial ability; and current and past findings imply that HGS is strongly connected to all of\nOverall, the present research reveals that individual differences in HGS account for\na significant portion of variance among measures of social competition in older adolescent\nmales. This research provides support for the evolutionary view that features linked with\nhigher HGS (i.e., testosterone) have been selected for in males due to various competitive\nadvantages. In summary, HGS is an easily obtainable and highly informative measure\nrelated to adolescent male behavior that should be considered in future research\ninvestigating social-sexual competition. Due to the limitations of high potential costs, as\nwell as low reliabilities associated with testosterone measures owing to differences in the\ntime of collection, HGS may be an appropriate alternative for assessing student\npopulations.\n"
