    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground and aim: Cardiovascular complications are one limitation of breast cancer treatment. The aim of the current\nstudy was to investigate whether the renin\u00adangiotensin related genes could be altered by chemotherapy and radio-\ntherapy, using a rat model.\nMethods: Female rats were divided into three groups: control, chemotherapy + irradiation (TC+IR) and irradiation (IR).\nMolecular analyses of the left ventricle were performed five months after the end of treatment. The analyses evaluated\nthe changes in mRNA levels of some renin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS) related genes: angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which\ncan be related to ACE production, by RT-PCR.\nResults: Renin was only observed in treated groups, TC+IR and IR, compared with the control group. ACE and VEGF\nmRNA was higher in groups TC+IR (p<0.01)\nand IR (p<0.05) compared with the control group.\nConclusion: Chemotherapy and irradiation can induce significant changes in some RAS related genes. These alterations are\nimportant to understand the pathways and consequences beyond cardiotoxicity induced by breast cancer treatments.\n",

Many of these therapies cause cardiac\nside effects that influence the success of treatment.4\nIt is known that radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD)\nis a late effect caused by radiation in the thoracic region,\nwhen all or part of the heart is in the radiation field.3-5\nAmong the manifestations of RIHD are valvulopathy, peri-\ncarditis and myocardial fibrosis.6-8\nIn the literature it is possible find different forms related\nto cardiotoxicity caused by chemotherapeutic agents,\nincluding cellular damage caused by free radical formation,\nand induction of immunogenic reactions in the heart. The\nchemotherapy regimen choice depends on tumor stage, and\nalso on the patient's clinical condition.

The\ntaxanes'mechanism of action is the inhibition of cell division\nby interrupting the function of microtubules, but their use is\nalso related to cardiotoxicity, and the exact way this occurs\nis still unknown.11,12 Alkylating agents such as cyclophos-\nphamide act directly in the alkylation of the DNAmolecule.\nThe precise mechanisms of cyclophosphamide-induced\ncardiotoxicity are also unknown. One hypothesis is that\ncyclophosphamide causes direct damage to the endothelium\nfollowed by extravasations of toxic metabolites, resulting\nin damage to the cardiomyocytes, hemorrhage and edema.13\nThe drugs that inhibit the renin\u00adangiotensin system\n(RAS) are the major therapeutic strategy for treating hyper-\ntension and reducing cardiovascular damage, and they are\nbeing used in patients undergoing chemotherapy for BC\nbeen identified as an endocrine system, where the circulat-\ning renin, produced in the kidney, regulates cardiovascular\nfunction by angiotensin II, which exerts its biologic actions\nby binding to either the angiotensin type 1 or type 2 recep-\ntors on target tissues. Until recently only this conventional\nRAS was recognized.17 However, it is now known that the\nkidneys are not the only source of renin production, and the\nangiotensin peptides may be produced in tissues and organs\nindependently. In the heart, changes in some RAS compo-\nnents, such as angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), are often observed\nin conditions leading to progression of heart failure.18-20\nThe local RAS functions are not yet fully explained, but it\nis believed that they are tissue-specific. It is known that\nsome of the local cardiac RAS components are up-regu-\nlated in RIHD, but there are few studies that show its action\non the association of both chemotherapy and irradiation\nThe present study evaluated the expression of some\nRAS components: angiotensinogen, renin, ACE and AT1\nand vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can\nbe related to ACE production, by RT-PCR, in female Wistar\nrats undergoing chemotherapy (TC) and/or irradiation.\nAlso investigated was the presence of mast cells in the heart\ntissue of these animals, since they can be a major source of\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nFemale Wistar rats (n = 15), three months old, weighing\napproximately 200g, were kept in appropriate cages with\nfour animals in each, on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food\nand water provided ad libitum. The animals were divided\ninto three groups, five animals each: control (received no\nfurther treatment), TC + IR (group receiving a chemother-\napy regimen and irradiation) and IR (group receiving only\nirradiation). The study protocol was approved by the local\nChemotherapy administration\nIn the TC+IR group, the multidrug TC was intraperito-\nneally administered to the animals. There were given four\ncycles, with an interval of seven days between them, and\neach animal received cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg dis-\nsolved in saline (Baxter, Brazil) and 12.5mg/kg docetaxel\ndissolved in 95% ethanol and diluted with 5% glucose solu-\ntion (Eurofarma, Brazil). The dose for each drug, in each\ncycle, was calculated to be equivalent to a chemotherapy\ndose per cycle in humans by the Human Equivalent Dose\nCalculation.23 Seven days after the last cycle of chemother-\napy, the animals were irradiated (TC+IR). Animals from IR\ngroup received no chemotherapy, only irradiation.\nIrradiation\nBefore irradiation rats were anesthetized with ketamine/\nxylazine intraperitoneally (0.1 mg/kg), and immobilized in\na polystyrene support. This ensures the animals' perma-\nnence in the same position during the procedure. Rats were\nirradiated with a single dose of 20 Gy to the heart, using a\nlinear accelerator Varian Clinac \u00ae 2100 C (Varian Medical\nSystems, CA, USA) with a 6 MV X-ray, and dose rate of\n240 cGy/min. Single doses of 20 Gy are calculated to be\napproximately equivalent to total fractionated doses of\n30\u00ad50 Gy (2 Gy per fraction), according to the linear quad-\nratic model and an a/b ratio of 2:3 as described by Schultz-\nHector et al.24 Individual rats were irradiated in the supine\nposition, using an anterior field size of 2 cm2 with bolus\ndepth of 0.5 cm. The heart position was marked after\ncomputed tomography simulation (HiSpeed CT/Dual, GE\nHealthcare, USA). After irradiation, animals were returned\nto the cages and remained under close observation until\neuthanasia, five months after irradiation. These time points\nwere chosen based on previous studies where, at four\nmonths after irradiation, cardiac lesions could be observed\nReal-time PCR-RT\nTotal RNA was extracted from the left ventricle (LV) of\nanimals from control, TC+IR and IR groups, by using\nTrizol Reagent (Invitrogen, NY, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was treated with\nDNAse amplification grade I (Invitrogen, NY, USA) and\nfirst-strand cDNA was synthesized using 2\u00b5g from\ntotal RNA and ImProm-IITM Reverse Transcription System\n(Promega, WI, USA) following the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. Oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the\n332 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)\ncDNA sequences reported in the GenBank database (www.\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The sequences of primers are listed in\nTable 1. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses were per-\nv.2.0.1 software (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). PCR\namplifications were performed using Gotaq qPCR Master\nMix (Promega, WI, USA). PCR cycling conditions were as\ndetermined using melt curves. Each sample was run and\nanalyzed in duplicate. Angiotensinogen, renin, ACE, AT1\nand VEGF mRNA levels were normalized by the values\nrelative to GAPDH (glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehy-\ndrogenase), and expression ratios were computed using the\nthreshold cycle method (Ct).\nMast cell staining\nTransverse sections of the LV were post-fixed in 10%\nbuffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Transverse\nLV paraffin (6 m thick) sections were subjected to mast\ncell analysis using acidic toluidine blue staining solution.\nFirst, the sections were deparaffinized in xylene and\nhydrated through alcohol to distilled water. They were\nthen incubated in an aqueous solution of 0.20% Toluidine\nBlue (Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA) acidified to pH 2.3 for\n2\u00ad3 min. Sections were washed three times in fresh dis-\ntilled water. Then they were quickly dehydrated through\n95% and two changes of 100% alcohol, cleared in xylene\nand mounted with Entellan (Merck Millipore, MA, USA).\nMast cells stained a violet/red purple color with a blue\nbackground.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-hoc test (GraphPad\nPrism 5.03; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).

The\npurpose was to evaluate the expression of some local cardiac\nRAS components, using the quantitative RT-PCR technique,\nfocusing on late cardiac treatment complications.\nIn the literature the control of angiotensinogen expres-\nsion is controversial. There are no supporting evidences\nthat correlate its expression and radiation or chemother-\napy regimens. The obtained results showed no significant\nalterations in angiotensinogen expression between\ngroups. Interestingly, we identified that renin was not\nubiquitously expressed in cardiac tissue, but it is strongly\ninduced by TC+IR and IR treatments. These findings\nFigure 1.

As in the present study the presence of renin was\ndetected in treated groups; it was suggested that this renin\ncould be produced by mast cells present on the tissue. In\norder to confirm this hypothesis our study performed a\ntoluidine blue staining to visualize the presence of mast\ncells in cardiac tissue. Mast cells were found only in treated\ngroups, supporting our hypothesis that these cells are\nresponsible for the renin mRNA levels in TC+IR and IR\ncardiac tissue.\nThe expression of ACE in cardiac tissue was also\nassessed, and the treated groups had decreased mRNA\nlevels of ACE compared with controls. It is known that\nthe ACE is mainly produced by endothelial cells,34-36 and\nthat irradiation primarily affects these cells, causing apop-\ntosis of the same, and subsequent decrease in capillary\ndensity.37-39 Previous studies demonstrated that several\nchemotherapeutic agents, like docetaxel and cyclophos-\nphamide, have an antiangiogenic activity by increasing\nendothelial cells apoptosis and decreasing the expression\nof VEGF levels.40-43 Thus, in this study heart VEGF\nmRNA levels were evaluated and results showed that,\nsimilarly to ACE levels, treated groups had decreased lev-\nels of VEGF compared with controls. These findings\ntaken together suggest that irradiation and chemotherapy\ncause an angiogenesis reduction, and as ACE is mainly\nproduced by endothelial cells, it may cause a reduction in\nACE levels in the cardiac tissue.\nThe mRNAAT1 levels were assessed in this study and\nresults showed that their levels were higher in treated\ngroups compared with controls. AT1 receptors are\nexpressed in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and, recently,\nthey are known to be expressed in cardiac mast cells.44,45\nMany studies showed that this receptor is up-regulated in\nthe cardiac remodeling process after several pathologic\nIn this present study the ACE expression was reduced\nand AT1 expression was higher, which seems to be con-\ntroversial. This can be associated with the novel and more\ncomplex aspects of the RAS role in cardiovascular func-\ntion. Evidence is available that angiotensin II is not only\ngenerated by ACE, but other enzymes can participate in\nthis process, for example chymase.48,49 Furthermore,\nrecent studies show that the AT1 receptors can exert their\nfunction and can be over expressed in the absence of\nThe participation of cardiac local RAS components in\ncardiovascular complications induced by cancer treatments\nis a novel and controversial area, and additional studies are\nneeded to better understand the pathways and consequences\nbeyond this mechanism. Such studies intend to improve\nbreast cancer treatment strategies, limiting late cardiovas-\ncular complications.\nFigure 5. RT-PCR analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor\n(VEGF) expression.

This study aimed to evaluate cardiac RAS com-\nponents using the RT-PCR technique. The main results\nwere the gene expression of renin only in treated groups,\ndecreased expression of ACE and increased expression of\nAT1 receptor in the same groups. The latter observations\nindicate that therapeutic strategies for BC must consider\nthese RAS component alterations in order to avoid the\nknown cardiac complications.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
