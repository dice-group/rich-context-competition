Lacking relevant personal experience with cer-\ntain risks, individuals mainly learn about them from print and\nelectronic media--as well as other avenues, such as peer net-\nworks. Continued exposure to media coverage of risks and\nrisk events (especially featuring dramatized symbolic conno-\ntations like \"Terminator technology\" or \"Frankenfood\") tend\nto heighten laypeople's risk perceptions--irrespective of\ntechnical risk assessments and expert viewpoints.\nIf media coverage of scientific and medical studies that\nseemingly provide compelling evidence for significant tech-\nnological and health risks tends to amplify public risk per-\nceptions, then what happens when further media coverage\ncriticizes those same studies as deeply flawed and even pub-\nlicizes that they have been retracted? Does such later media\ncoverage reverse or at least attenuate risk perceptions? Or,\nonce amplified, do risk perceptions stay elevated? While\nSARF scholars intimate that it is often easier to increase con-\ncern and stoke fears than it is to reduce them (Kasperson\net al., 1988), we simply lack much research to understand\nthese dynamics.\nThis knowledge gap is unfortunate given the recent rise in\nscientific article retractions (Steen, Casadevall, & Fang,\nprofile cases where eventually discredited and retracted peer-\nreviewed studies on the health risks of childhood vaccines\n(Wakefield et al., 1998) and genetically modified organisms\n(GMOs; S\u00e9ralini et al., 2012) seem to have inflated public\nrisk perceptions of these technologies. Indeed, often sensa-\ntionalized media coverage, content sharing via social media,\nand the claims-making activities of opponents of these tech-\nnologies have amplified public worry about childhood vac-\nTo extend SARF scholarship on the news media as a\nsocial station of risk amplification (and attenuation) and to\nexamine how news coverage of scientific retractions may\ninfluence risk perceptions, we focus on a recent case of the\nretraction of a well-publicized scientific study that seems to\nhave amplified risk perceptions of GM food. The study\n(S\u00e9ralini et al., 2012) reported that rats fed GM corn devel-\noped tumors, heightening concern about the health effects of\n1University of Idaho, Moscow, USA\n2Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDilshani Sarathchandra, Department of Sociology and Anthropology,\nEmail: dilshanis@uidaho.edu\nThe Effects of Media Coverage of\nScientific Retractions on Risk Perceptions\nDilshani Sarathchandra1 and Aaron M.

Yet, many in the scientific community challenged\nthe rigor and veracity of this study, which then was retracted\nfrom the Elsevier journal Food and Chemical Toxicology\n(Elsevier, 2013). In a between-subjects messaging experi-\nment, we investigate the extent to which risk perceptions\nabout GM crops and food are influenced by (a) news cover-\nage of this study and/or (b) news coverage of its retraction.\nIn the next section, we briefly review (a) the relevant\nSARF scholarship on the news media as an amplification sta-\ntion, (b) selected findings from GM food risk perception\nstudies, and (c) key aspects of our specific case study of the\nretraction of S\u00e9ralini et al. (2012). After describing our\nexperimental design and subjects, we explain the variables\nand analytical techniques we employed in our study. We then\ndiscuss our results and conclude with some potential impli-\ncations of our findings for SARF scholarship and sugges-\ntions for furthering this research agenda.\nRelevant Literature and Background\nSARF is an integrative conceptual framework that combines\ntheoretical arguments and empirical findings from media\nresearch, cultural scholarship, psychometric research, and\nstudies of organizational responses to risk (Kasperson,\nKasperson, Pidgeon, & Slovic, 2003). As it was first intro-\nduced in 1988, SARF scholars have engaged in clarifying\nand providing empirical support for the framework, for\nexample, by investigating how the framework applies to both\namplification and attenuation of risk (Kasperson &\nvides a structural description of how various hazardous\nevents interact with psychological, social, institutional, and\ncultural processes, leading to intensification or attenuation of\nrisk perceptions and related risk behaviors (Burns et al.,\nSARF explains how public reactions to risk often differ\nfrom technical risk assessments. Some hazards and events\nassessed by experts as relatively low-risk generate great\nsocial attention (risk amplification), while other hazards and\nevents judged as higher risk generate much less social atten-\ntion (risk attenuation; Kasperson et al., 2003; Kasperson\net al., 1988). According to SARF, amplification or attenua-\ntion begins either with an event or awareness of a hazard\n(Renn et al., 1992). The signals generated during such\nevents--which often combine facts, values, and symbolic\nmeanings--are intensified or attenuated during a signal\ntransmission process, as those signals pass through various\nindividual and social stations (Kasperson & Kasperson,\nThis process leads to subsequent individual-level and\ngroup-level behavioral responses, which in turn can lead to\nbroader societal impacts. Such impacts spread beyond those\nwho are directly affected by a risk experience (Kasperson &\nsometimes causing financial losses, regulatory action, litiga-\ntion, organizational change, and loss of confidence in institu-\ntions that govern risk (Kasperson et al., 1988). In the case of\nGM food, broader societal impacts may include enduring\nmental images and attitudes (e.g., anti-GM sentiments),\nimpacts on businesses and sales (e.g., aversion to GM food,\nincreased demand for organic produce), political and social\npressure (e.g., calls for labeling GM food, such as the 2014\nProposition 37 in California), contentious action (e.g., anti-\nGM protests, destruction of GM agricultural land), and dis-\ntrust in science and scientists. As individuals and groups\ncontinue to experience these broader societal impacts, the\neffects may spread to distant locations and even future gen-\nThe News Media as a Social Station of\nAmplification and Attenuation\nIn SARF, the news media is depicted as a key social station\nof risk amplification and attenuation that influences public\nperception of risk and likely behavioral responses (Burns\nvides mental shortcuts for citizens who have little or no\nexperience with new technologies (Scheufele & Lewenstein,\n2005). This is especially the case for technologies (such as\ngenetic engineering) that cannot be directly observed (Donk,\nAs a social station of risk amplification, the news media\nengages in several key amplification steps: filtering and\ndecoding of risk signals, processing risk information, and\nattaching social values to the information (Kasperson et al.,\n1988). These steps lead to transformation of risk signals,\nwhich in turn increases or decreases the salience of certain\naspects of risk messages (Pidgeon et al., 2003). Typical\nsignal transformation processes include giving dispropor-\ntionate, long-term attention to some risks while ignoring\nothers (Combs & Slovic, 1978; Freudenburg, Coleman,\n& Fitzgerald, 1991), vocalizing and legitimizing some points\nof view more or less than others (Hornig, 1993), and drama-\ntizing the nature of some risks but not others (Bauer, Kohring,\nThese different media responses play key roles in structuring\nthe overall public debate about risk events and hazards\n(Hornig, 1993). Regardless of the accuracy of information\npresented by the news media, large volumes of information\nand/or repeated stories are known to mobilize latent fears\nand serve as risk amplifiers (Kasperson et al., 1988). Also\nimportant are the symbols, metaphors, and discourses used\nto depict and characterize risk in the news media (Kasperson\n& Kasperson, 1996). Indeed, including or excluding certain\nSarathchandra and McCright 3\ncultural symbols (especially those with strong value implica-\ntions) is one of the most powerful means of amplification or\nattenuation of risk (Kasperson et al., 1988).\nWhile empirical evidence demonstrates that exposure to\nmedia coverage of hazards and technological risks does\namplify risk perceptions, it is unclear whether subsequent\nmedia coverage downplaying the hazards and reassuring the\nsafety of the technology can counteract the effects of original\nrisk messages (Kasperson et al., 1988). Indeed, as the name\nof the model implies, most SARF scholarship examines risk\namplification, while processes of risk attenuation are under-\ninvestigated. Yet, the standing question is important. Do risk\nperceptions, initially heightened through social amplification\nprocesses, stay elevated in the face of later, well-publicized,\ncounterfactual evidence?\nScientific retractions provide us with an avenue to empiri-\ncally examine this. While scientific retractions hold substan-\ntial interest for the public and the media (Tobin, 2000), media\ncoverage of scientific retractions has not been the subject of\nmuch investigation (Rada, 2007). Most empirical studies on\nretractions focus on identifying why journals retract articles\nand why the incidence of retractions has increased over time.\nA few studies find that press releases for article retractions\ndo garner measurable levels of media attention (Rada, 2005,\n2007) but also that the political agendas of journalists and\nmedia outlets influence their coverage (Winsten, 1985).\nWhile scholars obliquely discuss the potential implications\nof retractions (such as reduced trust in science), we found no\nempirical studies that have directly examined such claims.\nWe simply lack scholarship to explain how news coverage of\nscientific retractions may affect public risk perceptions--or\npublic perceptions of science in general.\nTo fill these gaps in the literature and extend the SARF\nscholarship on the news media as a social station of amplifi-\ncation and attenuation, we examine how risk perceptions\nare influenced by exposure to news coverage of a scientific\nstudy and by exposure to news coverage of its retraction.\nSpecifically, we examine how perceived risks of GM food\nare influenced by news coverage of the S\u00e9ralini et al. (2012)\nstudy--which reported that rats fed GM corn developed\ntumors--and by news coverage of its later retraction. SARF\nexpects that exposure to news coverage of the original study\namplifies perceived risk of GM food. We propose that news\ncoverage of an article's retraction can affect amplified risk\nperception in one of three ways, as depicted in Figure 1.\nProposition 1: Retraction news coverage has no effect on\namplified risk perception.\nProposition 2: Retraction news coverage attenuates\namplified risk perception.\nProposition 3: Retraction news coverage reverses the\namplification of risk perception.\nGM Food Risk Perceptions\nSince the mid-1990s, social scientists have investigated fac-\ntors that influence public risk perceptions of GMOs. Much of\nthat includes publics in the United States or Western Europe.\nWhile some scholars investigate overall perceived risk of\nGMOs (Frewer, Miles, & Marsh, 2002; Gaivoronskaia &\ntinguish between perceived health risks of \"GM food con-\nsumption\" and perceived environmental, regulatory, and\nsocial risks of \"GM crop cultivation\" (Allum, 2007; Costa-\nFont & Gil, 2008; Frewer, Howard, Hedderley, & Shepherd,\nSeveral of the patterns detected in GM food risk percep-\ntion are consistent with those of the broader risk perception\nliterature; furthermore, such patterns correspond to the\namplification and attenuation mechanisms of SARF (Frewer\net al., 2002). Research finds that women express greater con-\ncern about GM organisms and are less likely to approve of\nGMOs for consumption than are men (Hallman, Hebden,\nFigure 1. Possible effects of exposure to a study's retraction on amplified public risk perception.\n4 SAGE Open\nSeifert, 1997). Level of education is positively associated\nwith perceived benefits of GM crops (Hallman et al., 2003;\nTraill et al., 2004). Support for GM crops increases with\nincome (Torgersen & Seifert, 1997), but decreases with age\ntrust in scientists, governments, and regulatory agencies is\nassociated with heightened risk perceptions (Allum, 2007;\nrisk perceptions aligns with the intensity of media coverage\nThe S\u00e9ralini et al. Affair\nThe past few decades have seen a sharp increase in the per-\ncentage of scientific articles that are retracted (Steen et al.,\ntific articles rarely register outside of the scientific commu-\nnity, a few generate considerable media coverage and garner\npublic attention. Some prominent retractions that have cap-\ntured considerable public attention in the recent past include\narticles on the side effects of childhood vaccines (Wakefield\net al., 1998), the social cognition of nonhuman primates\n(Hauser, Weiss, & Marcus, 2002), the creation of multipur-\nhealth risks of GM crops (S\u00e9ralini et al., 2012), and change in\nattitudes about same-sex marriage (LaCour & Green, 2014).\nWe chose to focus on the S\u00e9ralini et al. (2012) study and\nits retraction for two reasons. First, this study provides a\nrecent and timely case that has not yet garnered much social\nscientific attention. Second, we anticipated that potential\nparticipants would be less familiar with the S\u00e9ralini et al.\naffair than with earlier retractions (such as Wakefield et al.,\n1998), thus reducing concerns about preexisting exposure.\nThe S\u00e9ralini et al. study was first published in 2012 in the\njournal Food and Chemical Toxicology. A research team led\nby French molecular biologist Gilles-Eric S\u00e9ralini reported\nthe results of an experiment in which researchers fed\nMonsanto's Roundup-resistant GM corn and Roundup herbi-\ncide to rats over their 2-year life span. The researchers found\nthat this GM corn and herbicide treatment produced higher\nrates of cancer and premature death in rats in the experimen-\ntal group than in those in the control group.\nUpon publication, this study was heavily criticized by the\nlarger scientific community for its low methodological rigor\nand limited statistical power (Butler, 2012). Some scientists\nargued that the particular strain of rats used in the study is\nprone to cancer even under normal conditions (Butler,\n2012), a fact that had long been established (Suzuki, Mohr,\n& Kimmerle, 1979). Several national food safety and regu-\nlatory organizations (e.g., European Food Safety Authority,\nGermany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) ques-\ntioned the validity of the study (Butler, 2012). Other groups,\nsuch as the European Federation of Biotechnology lobby,\nalso questioned the legitimacy of the scientific peer-review\nIn response to this intense criticism, Elsevier retracted the\narticle in November 2013. In its retraction notice, the editor\nin chief stated that although there was no evidence of fraud\nor intentional misrepresentation of data, the legitimacy of the\nresults was questionable due to the small sample size and the\nbreed of rats used. The editor in chief concluded that the\nresults presented were inconclusive and did not meet the\nthreshold for publication in Food and Chemical Toxicology\nThe Study\nSubjects\nWe administered an experiment online with Qualtrics to sub-\njects recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), a\ncrowdsourcing website where \"requesters\" solicit \"workers\"\nto perform \"human intelligence tasks\" (HITs) for pay. AMT\nhas emerged as a practical way for recruiting a large number\nof subjects from a reasonably wide cross section of the gen-\neral public either for conducting online experiments (e.g.,\nClements, McCright, Dietz, & Marquart-Pyatt, 2014) or for\ndesigning and testing new measurement instruments (e.g.,\nAllen, McCright, & Dietz, 2015) across the social sciences\n(e.g., Goodman, Cryder, & Cheema, 2013; Levay, Freese, &\nTo solicit a broad cross section of research subjects and\nminimize self-selection by AMT workers highly interested in\nGMOs, we advertised a HIT titled \"Your Attitudes About\nImportant Social Issues in the US.\" We limited participation\nto adults residing in the United States. We paid subjects\nUS$0.50 for completing the experiment, which took, approxi-\nmately, 7 min and 30 s on average. The final sample includes\nthose 423 subjects who completed the full questionnaire (of\ncorrectly answered a comprehension check question and a\nmanipulation check question.3 These correct answers and the\naverage completion time indicate that subjects had an ade-\nquate level of attentiveness during the experiment. Our con-\nveniencesampleismoredemographically,socially,politically,\nand geographically diverse than are the traditional experi-\nment recruitment pools of university undergraduates, yet it\nalso is more male, younger, more highly educated, and more\nliberal than would be a representative sample of the U.S. gen-\neral public. As such, the external validity of our results is\nlikely higher than if we had simply recruited university under-\ngraduates, but it is also likely lower than if we had drawn a\nnationally representative sample.\nThe Experiment\nOur experiment had three experimental conditions and a\ncontrol condition. To achieve reasonable equivalence of\nSarathchandra and McCright 5\ncognitive engagement across the four conditions, all subjects\nread news coverage of a scientific study conducted by a team\nof French scientists. As we discuss below, the topic of the\nscientific study in the control condition was a potential func-\ntional cure for HIV, while the topic of the scientific study in\nthe experimental conditions was potential health risks of\nconsuming GM food. We aimed to optimize external validity\nby explicitly creating a factual narrative reconstructed from\nactual news coverage, and we aimed to optimize internal\nvalidity by designing mock news stories with similar formats\nand lengths.\nEven though some news coverage of scientific research\nis rather sensationalized (especially that of research on pub-\nlicly controversial topics, such as GM food), we intention-\nally chose to craft fact-laden news stories that avoided\nobvious hype and provocation. We primarily did this to\nguard against unintentionally including persuasive ele-\nments that would unduly bolster message strength and sur-\nreptitiously inflate experimental effects--which would not\nbe reproduced in other contexts or outside of experimental\nsettings. As such, the resulting messages likely underesti-\nmate the influence that actual news coverage of this type\nhas on risk perceptions. Pages 2 to 5 in the Supplementary\nMaterials contain the news stories presented to the subjects\nin each of the four conditions.\nSubjects in the control condition read a brief news story,\ntitled \"Study Raises Hope for a `Functional Cure' for HIV,\"\nabout an actual study first publicized in early August 2012--\naround the time of the S\u00e9ralini et al. study. Subjects in the\nfirst experimental condition read a brief news story, titled\n\"Study Reveals Rats Fed GM-Corn Develop Tumors,\" that\ndescribed the findings of the S\u00e9ralini et al. study, which was\nfirst publicized in mid-September 2012. Subjects in the sec-\nond experimental condition read the brief news story from\nthe previous condition and another one, titled \"Controversial\nGM-Corn Study by French Scientists Retracted,\" that\ndescribed the limitations of the study, the negative reaction it\nreceived within the scientific community, and its eventual\nretraction--which was first publicized in late November\n2013. Subjects in the last experimental condition only\nreceived the news story about the S\u00e9ralini et al. retraction.\nAfter providing their consent to participate in our study,\nsubjects were randomly assigned to one of the four condi-\ntions above. Pages 6 to 8 in the Supplementary Materials\ncontain the full experimental questionnaire. After reading\ntheir assigned news story, subjects answered two open-\nended questions: one comprehension check and one manip-\nulation check. On the next page, subjects answered several\nsets of questions about their risk perceptions, policy prefer-\nences, and behavioral intentions about food from GM\ncrops. On a subsequent page, subjects answered a set of\nconventional questions about their demographic, social,\nand political characteristics. On the final page, we thanked\nsubjects for their participation and debriefed them about\nour research question.\nVariables\nTable SM1 on page 9 in the Supplementary Materials dis-\nplays key information about the wording and coding of the\nitems we used to create the three composite outcome vari-\nables in our analyses. Informed by the relevant literature, our\nthree outcome variables measure perceived risk of GM food\nin general, perceived risk of growing and harvesting GM\ncrops, and perceived risk of consuming GM food.\nRelative perceived risk of GM food is a ratio of the per-\nceived riskiness (not risky at all = 1 to extremely risky = 7) of\nGM food to the average perceived riskiness of four mundane\ntechnologies: chainsaws, elevators, medical X-rays, and\nmicrowave ovens.4 This relative measure helps to account\nfor and neutralize general tendencies toward risk aversion or\nrisk acceptance, helping us more precisely gauge perceived\nrisk of GM food.5 This variable ranges between 0.22 and\nFor our other two outcome variables (perceived danger-\nousness of GM crops and perceived dangerousness of GM\nfood), we used Cronbach's alpha scores and the results of a\nprincipal components analysis (PCA) with Promax rotation\nwith Kaiser normalization to justify creating two scales\n(Table SM2 on page 10 in the Supplementary Materials pres-\nents the PCA results). Perceived dangerousness of GM crops\n(Cronbach's  = .94) is a five-item scale that measures the\naverage perceived dangerousness (not dangerous at all = 1 to\nextremely dangerous = 7) that the growing and harvesting of\nGM crops poses for the following: farmers and farm-work-\ners, farm livestock (e.g., cows, pigs, etc.), pollinator insects\n(e.g., butterflies, bees, etc.), wild animals (e.g., deer, birds,\netc.), and local groundwater quality. Perceived dangerous-\nness of GM food (Cronbach's  = .97) is a four-item scale\nthat measures the average perceived dangerousness (not dan-\ngerous at all = 1 to extremely dangerous = 7) of the following\nfour behaviors: eating raw GM fruit or vegetables, eating\ncooked GM fruit or vegetables, eating processed food made\nfrom GM fruit or vegetables, and using GM food (e.g., veg-\netable oil) in the baking or cooking process.\nOur key predictors are two dummy variables, exposed to\nnews about study and exposed to news about retraction, that\nrepresent whether or not subjects were exposed to the initial\nnews coverage of the S\u00e9ralini et al. study or the later news\ncoverage of its retraction, respectively. To fully capture the\neffect of being exposed both to the news about the study and\nto the news about the retraction, we created an interaction\nterm using centered scores (mean \u00ad value): Exposed to news\nabout study \u00d7 Exposed to news about retraction. Utilizing a\nhigher order (e.g., interaction) term in a regression model\noften leads to multicollinearity problems. As our interaction\nterm is based on centered scores, it has a different scale than\ndo the original variables; thus, these multicollinearity prob-\nlems are reduced (e.g., Aiken, West, & Reno, 1991).\nWe also employ four demographic, social, and political\nvariables as statistical controls in our analyses. Female is a\n6 SAGE Open\ndummy variable for sex: male = 0 and female = 1. Slightly\nmore than 60% of our subjects were male. Age is measured\nApproximately, 75% of our subjects were aged younger than\n40 years. Education is measured by the highest degree earned:\nless than high school diploma or equivalent = 1 to graduate/\nprofessional degree = 6. Approximately, 55% of our subjects\nhad a bachelor's degree. Political ideology is measured on a\n7-point scale from very conservative = 1 to very liberal = 7,\nwith moderate = 4 in the middle. Approximately, 55% of our\nsubjects identified as slightly to very liberal.\nAnalytical Techniques\nAfter inspecting the descriptive statistics for each of our out-\ncome, independent, and control variables, we employed ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS) regression analyses to examine the\nextent to which exposure to news coverage of the S\u00e9ralini\net al. study and its retraction have an influence on the three\noutcome variables, while controlling for four demographic,\nsocial, and political variables. We performed all of our analy-\nses with IBM SPSS 24.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the unstandardized coefficients and standard\nerrors from OLS regression models predicting each of our\nthree outcome variables. The magnitudes of the statistically\nsignificant effects of key theoretical variables are not large,\nand the total amount of variance explained across the models\nis low. Yet, as we are investigating the influence of a single\nexposure to brief and intentionally weak experimental mes-\nsages, we believe that these small effect sizes nevertheless\nare substantively compelling.\nTo fully capture the effects of exposure to news coverage\nof the S\u00e9ralini et al. study and/or news coverage of its retrac-\ntion, we must account for the influence of the two experi-\nmental dummy variables and their interaction term. We do\nthis by calculating the predicted values of the three outcome\nvariables when exposed to news about study is 0 or 1 and\nwhen exposed to news about retraction is 0 or 1, while hold-\ning the demographic, social, and political variables at their\nmeans.\nFigure 2 displays these predicted values from the OLS\nregression models in Table 1 for those subjects who were\nexposed neither to the study story nor the retraction story\n(white bars), subjects exposed only to the study story (red\nbars), and subjects exposed both to the study story and retrac-\ntion story (green bars). The error bars represent 95% confi-\ndence intervals to clearly indicate statistically significant\ndifferences across predicted values. The results in Figure 2\noffer a cross-sectional between-subjects parallel of the longi-\ntudinal within-subjects models displayed in Figure 1.\nThe results in Figure 2 are relatively clear and fairly\nconsistent across the three risk perception outcome\nvariables. Subjects exposed to news coverage of the\nS\u00e9ralini et al. study perceive greater risk of GM food rela-\ntive to that of four mundane technologies, greater danger-\nousness of GM crops, and greater dangerousness of GM\nfood than do subjects who did not receive this experimen-\ntal message. These effects on risk perceptions from a sin-\ngle dose of a value-neutral mock news story provide\nmoderate support for SARF, which characterizes the news\nmedia as a key risk amplification station.\nDoes exposure to news coverage of the study and of its\nretraction have no effect on (Proposition 1), attenuate\n(Proposition 2), or reverse (Proposition 3) risk percep-\ntions amplified by news coverage of the study alone? The\npatterns displayed in Figure 2 offer clear and consistent\nsupport for Proposition 3. For each risk perception out-\ncome variable, subjects exposed to news stories about the\nstudy and its retraction reported risk perceptions (a) sig-\nnificantly lower than those of the group who received\nonly the study story and (b) statistically indistinguishable\nfrom those of the control group who received neither\nnews story.\nFinally, consistent with much research in the risk per-\nception literature, gender has a statistically significant\neffect on all three risk perception measures. Females per-\nceive GM food and GM crops to be riskier and more dan-\ngerous than do their male counterparts. Also, age and\neducational attainment have a statistically significant effect\non the last two risk perception measures. Briefly, older\nadults and lesser educated adults perceive GM crops and\nGM food to be more dangerous than do their respective\ncounterparts. Political ideology is not associated with per-\nceived risks of GM crops or GM food.\nTable 1.

We found that news coverage\nof a scientific study's retraction consistently reversed\namplified risk perceptions, regardless of the specific risk\nperception measure. Briefly, exposure to retraction news\ncoverage reversed relative perceived risk of GM food, per-\nceived dangerousness of GM crops, and perceived danger-\nousness of GM food.\nOur study fills a crucial gap in SARF research, which\nhas been criticized for predominantly characterizing the\nnews media as a \"social station of amplification\" and only\noccasionally considering it as a \"social station of attenua-\ntion.\" Our empirical analysis overcomes this criticism by\nexamining both amplification and attenuation processes\nsimultaneously. Also, our study is particularly timely due\nto the recent rise in scientific article retractions (Steen\nprofile cases where eventually discredited and retracted\npeer-reviewed studies seem to have stoked public risk per-\nceptions of certain technologies, causing long-term soci-\netal impacts.\nWhile the rate of scientific article retractions and their\nsubsequent news coverage have increased over the past few\ndecades, scholars have been slow to investigate how such\nretraction news coverage may affect public perceptions\nand/or behaviors. Yet, many important questions remain.\nFor instance, does the influence of retraction news cover-\nage on risk perceptions depend upon the reason for the\nretraction (e.g., honest mistakes vs. intentional misconduct;\nSteen et al., 2013)? Also, is the effect of retraction news\ncoverage on risk perceptions influenced by how polarized\npublic attitudes are on the technological or scientific devel-\nopment in question? Furthermore, to what extent does\nretraction news coverage produce broader impacts or \"rip-\nple effects\" (e.g., increased distrust in science) and how\nmight these effects vary across different demographic,\nsocial, and political groups?\nBeyond the SARF literature, our findings also carry\nimplications for the larger scientific community and for\nthose involved in science communication.As our results sug-\ngest that exposure to retraction news coverage affects public\nperception of scientific and technological developments,\njournal editors, publishers, and journalists should be more\ncognizant of such potential effects when reporting retrac-\ntions. Clarifying the reason for a retraction (e.g., honest mis-\ntakes vs. intentional misconduct) likely may influence how\njournalists cover the story and how the public perceives the\ndevelopment. Furthermore, if such a distinction helps to des-\ntigmatize retractions due to honest mistakes, then scientists\nmay be more likely to admit their own mistakes--which, in\nturn, may lead to rectification of the scientific record through\nBeyond this, science writers may more actively educate\nthe general public about the peer-review process, helping\nto increase scientific literacy throughout society. A more\nscientifically informed public would be better able to\nengage in a nuanced assessment of science news, including\nthe causes and implications of retractions to science and\nsociety. Although fraudulent research and retractions rep-\nresent only a small fraction of all scientific publications,\nthe potential decline in public trust of science that may\nresult from increased awareness of these wrongdoings\nis troubling. This situation demands a concerted effort by\nFigure 2. Predicted values from OLS regression models explaining risk perceptions about GM food for subjects exposed neither to the\nstudy nor the retraction (white), subjects exposed only to the study (red), and subjects exposed both to the study and retraction (green).\nNote. Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval for the predicted values. OLS = ordinary least squares; GM = genetically modified.\n8 SAGE Open\nauthors, editors, publishers, funding agencies, and journal-\nists to manage these risks.\nWe end by outlining the limitations of our single study\nand identifying further avenues to move this emerging\nscholarship forward. First, our study examined data from a\nconvenience sample, which is typical of many social sci-\nence experiments. While random assignment satisfies many\nconcerns about internal validity, atypical samples may limit\nthe degree to which findings should be generalized. If\nfuture studies examine data from high-quality representa-\ntive samples, scholars not only could reasonably estimate\npopulation characteristics but also would increase the\nexternal validity of results about the effectiveness of differ-\nent experimental messages and messengers on risk percep-\ntions across the general public.\nSecond, scholars also may examine a range of message\nand/or messenger characteristics. For instance, how does the\ninclusion of editorial or value-laden content (e.g., perhaps\ndenouncing the credibility of the retracted article's authors or\nintimating that the retraction does not discount the technol-\nogy's riskiness) influence the predictive power of message\nexposure? Also, how do different messengers' identities\ninfluence the impact of the message? For instance, how does\nit matter if the messenger is a trusted scientist or science\ncommunicator versus a well-known advocate for or oppo-\nnent of the technology?\nThird, scholars may investigate how the potential amplifi-\ncation and attenuation effects of media coverage of scientific\narticles and their retractions vary across types of traditional\nmedia (e.g., newspapers, television, radio) and newer social\nmedia (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). While traditional\nnews outlets operate via journalistic norms that regularly\nhelp produce generally accurate and reliable coverage of sci-\nentific topics, the relative normlessness of social media plat-\nforms produces a m\u00e9lange of credible scientific knowledge,\nintentional misinformation, and benign ignorance. It seems\nreasonable to expect that a newspaper article about a scien-\ntific retraction may be judged as more trustworthy than\nwould a Facebook post about that same retraction. Yet, opt-\ning into communication networks on social media tends to\nproduce self-contained \"echo chambers\" ripe for perpetuat-\ning motivated cognition (e.g., Colleoni, Rozza, & Arvidsson,\n2014). Thus, exposure to social media posts about a scien-\ntific study and/or its retraction may be more impactful than\nnewspaper coverage.\nFourth, while we employed a cross-sectional between-sub-\njects design in this initial study, we recommend that at least\nsome follow-up studies employ a longitudinal within-subjects\ndesign. The latter allows for investigation of possible changes\nin individuals' risk perceptions over time. Indeed, scholars\nmay include the time dimension (the length of time between\nexposure to news coverage of the scientific study and expo-\nsure to news coverage of its retraction) as an experimental\ncondition. This is particularly salient as there often is a\nconsiderable time lag between the publication of a scientific\narticle and its subsequent retraction. Fifth, additional research\nshould aim to replicate this study to more completely assess\nthe consistency and generalizability of our results. For\ninstance, future research could explore a wider array of estab-\nlished technologies (e.g., childhood vaccines) and emerging\ntechnologies (e.g., multipurpose stem cells) that have experi-\nenced high-profile retractions in recent years.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. S\u00e9ralini and his research team (2013) strongly objected to the\nretraction. A few scientists criticized the journal's decision to\nretract the study, arguing that this decision sets a problematic\nprecedent for the use of \"inconclusive data\" as a reason for retrac-\nS\u00e9ralini et al. article was republished in Environmental Sciences\nEurope (S\u00e9ralini et al., 2014) with minor wording changes and\n2. WhileAmazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and similar platforms\nfor crowdsourcing participation in scientific research are less\nthan a decade old, analyses suggest that the quality of data\nfrom such sources is similar to, or even slightly better than,\nthe quality of data from professionally managed online pan-\nels (Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010; Weinberg, Freese,\n& McElhattan, 2014). All subject recruitment methods have\ntrade-offs (e.g., the representativeness of samples, timeliness\nand cost of data collection, and data quality). Scholars may\naddress those weaknesses specific to subject recruitment with\nAMT by careful experimental design (Paolacci et al., 2010),\ntransparency about the study materials, and use of tools for\nrecruiting subjects who are attentive and/or provide higher\nquality responses (Paolacci & Chandler, 2014).\n3. The open-ended comprehension check question assessed\nwhether subjects could accurately summarize the main point\nof their assigned news story. The open-ended manipulation\ncheck question assessed whether subjects understood the sci-\nentific community's overall reception of the study as largely\npositive or negative.\n4. Cronbach's alpha for these four items was .71.\n5. Many risk perception studies over the last three decades docu-\nment that some social groups are more risk averse than others--\nregardless of whether the studies focus on risks in technological,\npublic health, or environmental domains. Our preliminary anal-\nyses find that perceived risk of each of the five technologies we\nused to create our relative risk measure is positively related to\nall others. All 10 bivariate correlations in the correlation matrix\nfor these five technologies are statistically significant and vary\nfrom r = .14 and r = .72, with an average of r = .36. We were\nconcerned that a simple, direct indicator of perceived risk of\nSarathchandra and McCright 9\ngenetically modified (GM) food (e.g., how risky is GM food?)\nwould merely tap this general tendency rather than more pre-\ncisely measuring perceived risk about GM food. The results of\npreliminary analyses using this simple, direct indicator as our\ndependent variable validated this concern. That is, females,\nolder adults, and lesser educated adults perceive GM food as\nriskier than their respective male, younger, and higher educated\ncounterparts--replicating patterns found widely across the risk\nperceptions literature. To address this, we selected four com-\nmonplace technologies that have been examined in the risk per-\nception literature. We then created our composite measure (of\nthe perceived risk of GM food relative to the perceived risk of\nthese four technologies) to more fully distinguish perceived risk\nof GM from perceived risk more broadly.\nSupplementary Material\nThe online supplementary material is available at http://journals.\nReferences\nAiken, L., West, S., & Reno, R.
