However, research\nresults indicate seemingly unjustified differences between how females and males are treated by EFL (English as a Foreign\nLanguage) teachers. The overall aim of this study is to illustrate, analyze, and discuss aspects of gender bias and gender\nawareness in teacher\u00adstudent interaction in the Iranian college context. To this end, teacher\u00adstudent interactions of 20\nEnglish teachers and 500 students were investigated from the perspective of gender theory. The data were obtained via\nclassroom observations, a seating chart and the audio-recording of all classroom interactions during the study. The findings,\nobtained from the quantitative descriptive statistics and chi-square methods, as well as the qualitative analysis by way of\nopen and selective coding, uncovered that there were significant differences in the quantity and quality of the interaction\nfor females and males in almost all categories of interaction. The study also revealed teachers' perception of \"gender,\" the\nproblems they associate with gender, and the attitudes they have to gender issues. Apparently, while positive incentives are\nable to facilitate learner growth, the presence of any negative barrier such as gender bias is likely to hinder development.

To quote De Beauvoir (2012), one is\nnot born, but becomes a woman. This view is in direct con-\ntrast with traditional psychological researchers that tend to\nattribute male/female differences to biological sex (e.g.,\nStewart & McDermott, 2004). This study, in line with the\nformer view, adopts the constructionist epistemological (e.g.,\nhypothesizes that learned preferences or classroom behav-\niors are socially determined.\nThere are numerous indicators within schools and society\nthat point to the fact that gender bias is present in the curricu-\nlum and teachers' practices. Gender bias, according to\nSunderland (1992), operate at different levels in English as a\nForeign Language (EFL) classrooms: classroom materials,\nEnglish language itself, and classroom processes that always\ninteract within a particular political, sociolinguistic and edu-\ncational context. Examples of gender bias are one gender is\nsubstantially over- or underrepresented in a curriculum, such\nas the stereotypical images of men and women present in the\ntextbooks; teacher expectations are related to or affected by\nstudent gender; or classroom practices, teaching methods or\ndiscipline disproportionately affect one gender (Dabiri,\nSadly enough, these seemingly unjustified gender\ninequalities are at work in the educational contexts of many\ncountries in general (Ifegbesan, 2010; Lopez-Saez, Morale,\n& White, 2006), and the EFL setting of this research site in\nexplores teachers' belief and perception of gender bias in\nclassroom practices, and reports that educational system not\nonly reinforces traditional gender roles but also the stereo-\ntyped attitudes toward gender. Ironically, majority of the\nteachers who hold gender stereotypes are unaware of this\nfact and deny that they hold or perpetuate biased perceptions\nof males and females in their classroom practices.\nClassroom practices are classified into three different cat-\negories: those focusing on teacher-to-student discourse in\n1University of Guilan, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nJaleh Hassaskhah, Assistant Professor, Faculty of Literature and\nHumanities, Department of English Literature, University of Guilan.\nEmail: hassas@guilan.ac.ir\nGendered Teacher\u00adStudent Interactions\nin English Language Classrooms: A Case\nof Iranian College Context\nJaleh Hassaskhah1 and Sara Roshan Zamir1\n Keywords\ngender theory, teacher\u00adstudent interaction, gender bias, gender equity, teacher feedback\n2 SAGE Open\nwhole-class work; those focusing on student-to-teacher dis-\ncourse in whole-class work; and those focusing on learner\ndiscourse in pair- and group work (Sunderland, 1992).\nHowever, common to all is the idea of interaction that is the\npart and parcel of any language classroom practice. Given\nthat one of the main objectives of Foreign Language (FL)\nclassrooms is facilitating interaction--usually via IRF struc-\nture (teachers' Initiate; students' Respond; teachers'\nFeedback)--it immediately becomes clear that teachers'\nmanner of initiation can not only create more interactive\nactivities but can also prompt students to participate in all\nkinds of negotiation of meaning (Xiao-yan, 2006).\nTherefore, the ways in which teachers interact with stu-\ndents prompted many researchers to study teacher\u00adstudents\ninteraction in the classroom (e.g., Ros\u00e9n, 2012). More spe-\ncifically, the role of teachers in providing and distributing\nequal interaction opportunities for all students regardless of\ntheir gender, race, and social status was understood to be of\nvital importance because they not only offer language prac-\ntice and leaning opportunities but also help the process of\nlanguage development itself (Xiao-yan, 2006).\nHowever, while in literature there exist numerous studies\non the content analysis of textbooks, curriculum materials,\ngender-affected academic achievements (e.g., Wilkins,\n2012), and gender-stereotyped beliefs and behavior\nstudies focusing on the nature of interactions in classroom--\nas an important arena for gender constructions--has just\nstarted to receive the due attention (Dabiri, 2006; Ros\u00e9n,\nDabiri (2006), for instance, indicates that the classroom\ninteractions between Iranian teachers and students are influ-\nenced by teachers' attitude and expectations from genders,\nand that teachers change their behavior, expectations, and\nteaching style according to students' gender. Or Sunderland\n(1998) examines the quality and quantity of interactions and\nmaintains that teachers vary considerably in the quantities\nof interactions they have with individual students, with\nmales receiving a higher proportion of contacts from teach-\ners across subject areas. In other words, teachers initiate\nmore contacts with males than with females and males initi-\nate more contacts with teachers and they criticize and praise\nmales more often than females (Brophy & Good, 1974;\nIn addition, studies suggest that from the very early grades\nthrough the university level, female students have been the\nvictims of hidden bias in teacher interactions and the curricu-\nlum, although they sit in the same classroom and are expected\nto learn the same material (M. Sadker & Sadker, 1994).\nStreitmatter (1994) in her book toward gender equity illus-\ntrates the fact that the quantity and quality of teacher interac-\ntions varies by student gender and through their interactions\nthey allow for male dominance in classrooms. Koca (2009)\nalso indicates that female and male teachers interact more\nfrequently with males, and this interaction is influenced by\ngender-stereotyped beliefs of teachers and students.\nThere are also some qualitative differences in how teach-\ners interact with their students. This differentiation, on the\npart of many teachers, has to do with expectations that are\nlargely based on the acceptance of gender stereotypes\nteacher interactions according to the gender of students are\ngenerally manifested through the intensity of academic inter-\naction between teacher and student.\nJones and Dindia (2004) in studying the role of student\ngender in teacher-initiated interactions found that across\n127 empirical studies, it appeared that female and male\nteachers tend to have more interactions of all kinds with male\nstudents than do female students. Kelly (1988) also in her\nmeta-analysis concludes that males get \"more instructional\ncontacts, more high-level questions, more academic criti-\ncism and slightly more praise than females\"--all of which\nwould seem potentially valuable in terms of facilitating\nlearning. Due to the importance of higher level questioning\nin effective teaching and learning, much of the research in\nqualitative gender difference has targeted that direction\n(Good, Sikes, & Brophy, 1973). Duffy, Warren, and Walsh\n(2001) argues that the higher number of questions (especially\nprocess questions) and feedback (acceptance and criticism)\ngiven toward males could function as feedback and rein-\nforcements for thinking by males; this signals to individual\nthat a certain way of thinking is correct or incorrect, although\nnot indicating the correct type of thinking. Thus, somewhat\nmore attention to males' thinking than to females' thinking\nappears to be taking place in some classrooms. Duffy et al.\n(2001) concludes that the tendency to interact more with\nmale than female students, besides other factors, also depends\non the academic subject being taught. It infers that teachers\nhold higher expectations of males.\nConsidering that inequalities in classrooms may wrongly\ndecide who in general is empowered as a learner and unreal-\nistically define who a learner is as a person, gender bias with\nall its complexity and subtlety has to be recognized and con-\ntrolled in advance of every aspect of students' classroom life\n(Streitmatter, 1994). Concerned with the issue, this study\nreasons that students who do not interact with their teachers\nare less likely to receive encouragement, chance to talk, and\nhence learn--a threat that is recognized by Sternglanz and\nLyberger-Ficek (1977) as influential in determining under-\nrepresentation in postsecondary education.\nWhereas many of the earlier studies indicated that gen-\ndered classroom interaction could obstruct and even harm\nknowledge acquisition for males and females (Yepez, 1994),\nstill little is known about how gender bias might affect sec-\nond language acquisition in adult EFL classrooms, and how\nteacher's gender might affect teacher\u00adstudent interaction\n(Good et al., 1973). Moreover, considering that teachers'\nHassaskhah and Roshanzamir 3\nexpectations of male and female students are subject-sensi-\ntive (Duffy et al., 2001), the other question that arises is\nwhether this \"differential teacher treatment by gender\" may\nbe manifested in the foreign language classroom, an environ-\nment in which females are generally thought to outperform\nmales (Sunderland, 1998). In the light of these questions, the\nfollowing objectives were postulated for this study:\n1. To examine the differences in frequency and types of\nteacher-initiated interactions directed toward females\nand males.\n2. To discover the differences in the frequency and\ntypes of interactions directed toward females and\nmales between female and male teachers.\n3. To assess teachers' attitude toward gender bias and\ntheir awareness of their own treatment of male and\nfemale students in class, because according to\nM. Sadker and Sadker (1992) despite most teachers'\nclaim that they treat students fairly, irrespective of\ntheir gender, research reveals the opposite.\nIt was hypothesized that due to the dominant sociopoliti-\ncal attitude to women in this research context, which places\nwomen under male guardianship (Moghadam, 2004), female\nparticipants would be more likely to experience gender dis-\ncrimination in their classrooms.\nMethod\nTo meet the objectives stated above, the researchers required\nonly mixed-gender EFL classes, where considerable amount\nof interaction between teacher and students would occur, and\nfrom which comparable data of teachers' treatment toward\nmales and females could be obtained.\nSampling\nThe sampling technique had to be nonrandom and purposive,\nbecause the accessibility of mixed-gender classes in a coun-\ntry like Iran, where the prevalent tendency is toward having\nsegregated classes, was heavily restricted. As a result, a sam-\nuniversities in Guilan-Iran, who taught \"Basic English\"\ncourses (Conversation, Reading, and Oral reproduction;\nthese courses were selected because they required sufficient\ninteraction and acted as the stepping stones for the students'\nongoing academic life), and 500 Iranian students (78%\nfemales and 22% males; the proportion represented male/\nfemale groups in the population) within the age range of\n19 to 25 were selected to serve as the participants of this study.\nInstruments\nThe main sources of data collection for this study were class-\nroom observation and teacher interviews. In general,\nclassroom observation procedures are grouped into three\nmajor categories: (a) those that focus on the teacher, (b) those\nthat focus on the teacher\u00adstudent dyad, and (c) those that\nfocus on the student (Lockheed & Harris, 1989). However, in\nline with the objectives of this study, that of the second type\n(i.e., focusing on teacher\u00adstudent interactions) was used\nwhich took the form of quantitative systematic observations\nand qualitative note taking, and mainly focused on the\nteacher-initiated interactions.\nThe tools used for this kind of observation consisted of a\nmodified version of gender-equity observation checklist\n(INTERSECT observation instrument) developed by Sadker\n(cited in D. Sadker, Sadker, & Bauchner, 1984) to systemati-\ncally observe classroom interactions, and a seating chart to\nkeep a sound record of frequency and type of teacher\u00adstudent\ninteractions and to quantify the classroom behavior observed.\nThe gender-equity observation checklist aids in the con-\nversion of general classroom interactions into evaluative\ntypes of interactions: praise, criticism, remediation, and\nacceptance. Using this observation tool to collect data on fre-\nquency and pattern of teacher-initiated interactions to stu-\ndents, the researchers deliberately recorded only the\ninteractions between teachers and individual students and\noverlooked those between teachers and the class as a whole\nand between student and student or student to teacher. In\naddition, the seating chart that was constructed for this\nresearch purpose was used as the means for observation and\ncodification of the observed data. The chart consisted of\nsquare boxes to represent the location and gender of each\nstudent, as well as the teacher's in the classroom.\nA code was assigned to each category in the checklist, and\non the occurrence of each of the categories, and the specified\ncode was recorded on the seating chart. Codes were used to\nrepresent teacher and students behavior.\nBesides coding the interactions based on the prespecified\nchecklist, interactions were also audio-recorded for later veri-\nfication of the coded data. Of course, video-taping the classes\nwould have been much more preferable in these situations;\nhowever, as that was not allowed in the observed classes,\naudio-recording alone was used. The audio-recording was\nvery helpful in categorizing the types of interactions observed.\nIntraobserver reliability.To gain experience with the use of\ncoding chart and to test the intraobserver reliability, a pilot\nstudy, which was not used in the main study, was conducted.\nAlthough using only one coder eliminated the problem of\ninterobserver agreement, there remained the possibility of\nindividual observer coding bias (Patton, 1990). Conse-\nquently, three randomly selected classes of the pilot study\nwere simultaneously coded by another observer as a check\non observer reliability. The Cohen's kappa was calculated to\nshow the overall agreement for the observers' coding among\nfour evaluative type of interaction during the pilot study. The\nindex obtained was .79, which according to Landis and Koch\n4 SAGE Open\nProcedures\nObservation.To observe the ethical requirements of the\nstudy, the participant teachers were asked for their permis-\nsion to allow one of the researchers to visit their classes at\nleast 3 times in an academic term--As a result, 60 classes\nwere totally observed. Moreover, they were informed that\nthe researchers would need to have a follow-up interview for\nwhich their further cooperation might be required. It should\nbe noted that due to the nature of the investigation, the main\ngoal of the study (gender equity) was deliberately withheld\nto prevent teachers' dog-and-pony show and as a result a\nchange in classroom dynamics. Moreover, codes were\nassigned to names to maintain participants' confidentiality.\nHaving done so, the observer regularly entered every class-\nroom prior to the arrival of the students and sat in an unob-\ntrusive position near the back and side of the room to be able\nto have a better grasp of the whole setting and to observe all\nand every students and their teachers. The seating arrange-\nment of the class was drawn and labeled with the students'\nname (if possible), gender, and any other needed informa-\ntion. Generally the average class size was 23 students. In\nmost classes, males and females sat in a rectangular format,\nwith the teacher in front. Students' desks were more fre-\nquently arranged in rows of 4 or 6, and there was no decora-\ntion on the walls.\nStudents in all classrooms sat in gender-differentiated pat-\ntern--females mostly sitting in front rows and males in last\nrows, or females on one side and males on the other side of\nthe class. Teacher's position was also identified to examine\nhis or her action zone--the section he or she was mostly fac-\ning or projecting in a discussion--because this is suggested\nto be influential in the learning experience of the students\nThe observer recorded every teacher-initiated interactions\nthat occurred between a teacher and a student based on a\nprespecified checklist and on the seating chart. Moreover, to\nprevent the loss of any piece of the data, a high quality\nrecorder was used to audio record the interactions. In addi-\ntion, some field notes besides coding the interactions were\nalso taken on classroom setup, teacher talk, and teacher\nbehavior in class to help the researchers have an ongoing\nanalysis of the data, and as a result a better understanding of\nteacher behavior in class to see if they signal the promotion\nof any sort of gender inequity in the classrooms.\nFinally, all classes were continuously observed 3 times\nwithin 90-min class periods, yielding a total observation time\nof 90 hr to get a typical sample of teacher\u00adstudent interac-\ntions and to be able to generalize the findings. The number of\nstudents present during all the class observations carried out\nInterview.A sample of two thirds of the observed teachers\n(six teachers, three females and three males) was randomly\nselected for the interview. Having completed the\nobservations, and before posing the interview questions, the\nteachers to be interviewed were informed about the main\nconcern of the study, after then were asked two sets of ques-\ntions: (a) relevant demographical questions and (b) three\nopen-ended questions to assess how they perceived their\nbehavior toward male/female students, and their interaction\npatterns in the classroom.\nPermission was obtained orally from each respondent to\nrecord the interview and they were assured that their answers\nwould be kept confidential; codes were used to protect ano-\nnymity of the participants. To have a better ability to com-\npare the responses, all the questions asked in the interview\nprocess were structured and preplanned, and whenever the\ninterviewees were not clear with the questions, they were\nfreely offered clarifications and explanations by the inter-\nviewer. Notes were taken on their responses to every ques-\ntion. The whole interview was audio-recorded and then\ntranscribed for further analysis.\nData Analysis\nFor the quantitative data, descriptive statistics of the overall\npatterns of classroom interaction was calculated and the cor-\nresponding counts were tallied for the categories and orga-\nnized into tables for easy reference. In the second phase of\nanalysis, to examine the statistical difference in teacher inter-\naction with males and females; that is to determine if a sig-\nnificant difference existed between teachers and their\ninteractions with male/female students, the chi-square statis-\ntic was run to compare the tallies or counts of categorical\nteacher interaction with males and females. It should be\nnoted that only actual numbers and not percentages were\nused for this purpose.\nFor the analysis of the qualitative data, the constant com-\nparative method of qualitative analysis (Patton, 1990) was\nused. That is, all interviews were recorded in the researchers'\nfield notes. The audio-recording of the interviews was then\ntranscribed and later, the researchers systematically worked\nthrough each transcript of the interviews and the notes taken\nduring classroom observations to assign codes to the specific\ncharacteristics within the texts. After the open coding the\nresearchers looked for themes in the data that could be sorted\ninto categories. To ensure that naturally arising categories\nwere used rather than those the researchers might have hoped\nto locate and to substantiate, an assistant rechecked the data\nand the classification system for the appropriateness and\naccuracy of the categories as well as the data placement in\nthese categories.\nResults\nQuantitative Results\nIn the 20 classes observed, a total of 1,270 teacher-initiated\ninteractions were recorded. Then, the total number of teacher\nto student interactions was broken down into four categories\nHassaskhah and Roshanzamir 5\nof contact: praise, acceptance, remediation, and criticism.\nThe ratio of each type of contact to the total was further com-\nputed to represent the distributions of interactions. Table 1\nsummarizes the frequency and percentage of teacher-initi-\nated interactions regardless of teacher gender in each cate-\ngory of interaction.\nAs illustrated in the table, of four types of contacts speci-\nfied in this study, teachers mostly provided students with\nacceptance (comments which implied that student perfor-\nmance was correct or appropriate) in response to the ques-\ntions asked by the teachers themselves. Thus, acceptance\nwas, by far, the largest type of feedback used by teachers\n(56%); followed by praise (21%; Explicit comments which\npositively reinforced student performance), then remediation\n(14%; A constructive teacher comment, usually encouraging\nor cueing a more acceptable student response), and finally\ncriticism (explicitly negative teacher evaluation) that\naccounted for only 9% of the interactions.\nTeacher-initiated interactions and students' gender. This part is\ndone in response to the first objective of the study; that is,\nexamining the differences in the frequency of interaction\ndirected toward males and females. To this end, the break-\ndown of the number of females and males in the observed\nclasses, the total number of each interaction type, the quan-\ntity of the observed interactions by student gender, and the\nquantities of interactions that would have been expected,\nprorated for the numbers of females and males in the study\nare shown in Table 2. To account for the uneven distribution\nof females and males in the observed classes the expected\nfrequency of the interactions was calculated based on the\nratio of females and males in all the observed classes. Con-\nsidering the ratio of females and males in the observed\nclasses it would have been expected that in each interaction\ncategory 78% of the interactions be distributed among\nfemales and 22% of them among males.\nAs can be seen from Table 2, in all interaction categories\nthe total interactions distributed to males were more than\nwhat would have been expected proportional to their num-\nbers. In general, if we consider the uneven distribution of\nfemales and males in the class it is revealed that although\nfemales constituted 78% of the total sample (392 females,\n108 males), they accounted for only 33% of the total interac-\nIn the next phase of analysis, the one-dimensional chi-\nsquare was conducted to determine if there was any signifi-\ncant difference in the distribution of each interaction category\nbetween females and males. The analysis revealed a signifi-\ncant difference in the distribution of all the specified catego-\nries of interactions directed by female and male teachers\ntoward female and male students, except for remediation. In\nother words, there was no significant difference in the distri-\nbution of remediation between females and males (2 =\nwere distributed significantly more among males (Table 2).\nThe chi-square measures of all the categories are presented\nTypes of teacher\u00adstudent interactions directed toward females\nand males and teachers' gender. This part of the quantitative\nanalysis contributes to the second objective of the study\nwhich is concerned with the issue of the differences in fre-\nquency and types of interaction directed toward female and\nmale students between female and male teachers.\nTo meet this end, the observed frequency of teacher\u00adstu-\ndent interactions initiated by female and male teachers toward\nfemale and male students was counted (Table 3). For ease of\ncomparison, the quantities of interactions that would have\nbeen expected to be directed toward students of either gender\nby female and male teachers, proportional to students' enroll-\nment in their classes, are presented in Table 4. Comparing the\nobserved frequency of the different types of contact initiated\nby female and male teachers with the expected frequency of\nthese types of interactions, it is clear that all categories of\ninteraction were consistently directed toward males more\nthan what would have been expected proportional to their\nenrollment in class by female and male teachers. To test the\ndifferences in frequency and types of teacher-initiated inter-\nactions directed toward female and male students between\nfemale and male teachers, a chi-square test of independence\nwas performed for each category of interactions.\nResults of the analysis revealed that female teachers\nthan toward females. Yet, there was no significant difference\nin female teacher-initiated remediation (2 = 0.6; df = 1;\ntoward female and male students. However, in the classes of\nmale teachers the results of the analysis manifested that sig-\ndf = 1; p < .05) were directed toward males than females.\nHowever, there was no significant difference in remediation\nthat male teachers directed toward females and males\nobserved and expected frequencies of different categories of\nfeedback directed toward females and males between female\nand male teachers, respectively.\nTable 1. Frequency and Percentage of Teacher Interaction.\nType of interaction n %\n6 SAGE Open\nQualitative results.This last section presents the results\nobtained through interview to assess teachers' awareness of\nhow they treated male/female students in their classrooms.\nSix teachers (three females and three males) were randomly\nchosen from among the observed teachers to be interviewed.\nThe interview contained three open-ended questions as\nfollows:\n1. Do you see any difference between females and\nmales in your class that makes you treat them\ndifferently?\n2. Do you think the type of feedback that you give to\nfemales and males are the same or different?\n3. What do you think would be the likely cause of any\nunequal distribution of the interaction patterns in\nyour classroom?\nAll the teachers interviewed had similar if not the same\nanswers to the interview questions. When teachers were\nasked whether they saw any differences between females and\nmales in their classes, almost all of them (83%) explicitly\nstated that they did not see any difference regarding gender\nof the students; however, in elaborating their answers 67% of\nteachers stated that females were more participating in the\nclassroom. They believed that females compared with males\ntook part more in activities and interacted more with the\nteacher. Teachers' comments as stated by they themselves\nand without any modification appear below:\nFemales like to talk a lot, even participate more in activities and\nmore question and answer happen. Males mostly try just to keep\nsilent and when they are asked they take part. (Teacher J, male)\nHowever, one teacher had a different view in this regard:\n. . . sometimes male students participate more in class so they\ntake more attention but the others not . . . (Teacher H, female)\nAnother teacher points to students' level of achievement\nas the source of students' difference and not their gender:\nTable 3.

(Teacher P, female)\nConcerning the type of feedback directed toward females\nand males 83% of the teachers stated that the type of feed-\nback did not depend on the gender and in this regard they did\nnot consider any difference between females and males.\nSome of them further explained that type of their feedback\ndepended on the personality of the student.\nThe type of feedback is not based on gender; it depends on the\npersonality of the students. I do not think that females are more\nsensitive than males. You can see some males that are very\nsensitive. And because the number of males is few in class,\nwhen you criticize them in front of all females it will offend\nthem too much sometimes. (Teacher D, female)\nMostly I disregard the difference between females and males but\nif I feel the student is bothered with my feedback I try to mend it\nand mostly females are more sensitive to those matters. (Teacher\nJ, male)\nPersonality of the students determines the kind of feedback.\n(Teacher N, male)\nOne of the teachers referred to the type of answer as the\ndetermining factor:\nIt depends on the type of answer I receive regardless of any\ngender consideration. (Teacher H, female)\nOnly one teacher claimed that he was \"more careful in\ntreating females.\"\n. . . they [females] are much more emotional. So you should be\ncareful when directing criticism or remediation toward them.\nWe are supposed to be alert in providing feedback to females.\nWe criticize the females but in a polite way not to offend them.\nOf course, it depends most of the time on them being obedient or\nnot, otherwise we have to use direct words. We treat males\npolitely too but the selection of the words and the way we\nprovide the feedback is different. (Teacher O, male)\nIn asking the teachers' opinion about the cause of any\nlikely unequal distribution of interaction between females\nand males, they provided various answers. Among the men-\ntioned causes were: students' voluntary participation (50%),\ngap between teaching and practice (17%), the classroom\ncontext (50%), teacher characteristics (17%), and student's\nknowledge (33%). Below are some of the comments from\nthe teachers interviewed:\nMaybe the level of participation of that gender caused it. Some\nstudents just grab the teachers' attention . . . (Teacher H, female)\nIt is my failure and I accept it, but maybe more volunteers from\none gender are the cause because mostly I put a question and\nchoose from volunteers to answer. (Teacher J, male)\nThe cause is the gap between practice and thinking. Always\nthere is a gap between the teacher concept before coming to\nclass and something that happens in the class. The second factor\nmay be the context of the class. (Teacher N, male)\nIt depends on someone's temperament and characteristics. Some\nmen are more comfortable with male students and some with\nfemale students. (Teacher O, male)\nIt depends on the knowledge they have. Among the students at\nthe same level I do not put any difference in the type of asked\nquestions but for both students that are in higher level or lower\nlevel type of question would be different. (Teacher P, female)\nDiscussion\nThe quantitative findings of this study indicated that within\nteacher-initiated interactions, three out of four categories of\nevaluative contacts (acceptance, praise, and criticism) were\ndirected significantly more to males than females. Actually\nmales were involved in more than 50% of all the interaction\ncategories. The only category with no significant difference\nin its distribution between females and males was remedia-\ntion. Moreover, findings regarding the influence of gender of\nteachers on their differentiated behavior toward females and\nmales exposed that female teachers normally provided males\nwith more acceptance and praise than females; however,\nthere was no significant difference in providing females and\nmales with criticism or remediation. However, in male-\ntaught classes almost all categories of interaction were\ndirected significantly more toward males.\nGenerally speaking, these results support M. Sadker and\nand Koca (2009), and confirm that males get more speaking\npractice and more feedback on their utterances. That is,\nmales responded more to the teachers' questions, and hence\nreceived more feedback and practice in language functions.\nHowever, in explaining the causes of female teachers not\nproviding males with more criticism and remediation, class-\nroom observations and teachers' interviews revealed that\nIranian female teachers were more cautious in criticizing\nmales, as one of the teachers said,\n. . . maybe a boy is more sensitive than a girl, especially if we\nhave few males in class and when you criticize them in front of\nall the females it will offend them too much sometimes. (Teacher\nD, female)\nTeachers' beliefs and behaviors in the classroom are most\nprobably influenced by the dominant bias that exists in\nIranian society. Actually, Iranian society assigns abilities and\ncharacteristics to individuals on the basis of their gender\n(Moghadam, 2004). For instance, men are identified as\nresponsible, strong, independent, self-confident, aggressive,\nand successful, whereas women are described as passive,\nemotional, nurturing, and warm. As Dabiri (2006) claims, it\n8 SAGE Open\nis students'gender that specifies the kind of positive or nega-\ntive feedback. In her study, it was revealed that teachers'\ndefinition of male roles emphasizes mastery and compe-\ntence, whereas female role was defined as submissive and\ndependent. This way of looking at female and male roles\nmay make the teacher accept the males' answers more easily\nand not question the response that they provide, and it might\nfurther explain why criticism and remediation were the only\ncategories whose distribution happened to be equal between\nfemales and males by female teachers.\nAccordingly, as it was discussed earlier, as most lan-\nguage learners consider opportunities to talk and practice\nusing the language very important, this lack of opportunity\nto use the language may hinder the development of females'\nlanguage ability. Therefore, the trend of male domination of\ntalking time in EFL classrooms gives reason for concern\nthat women are getting less than their fair share of opportu-\nnities to practice using English.\nContrary to the quantitative findings of the study, teachers\nin their interviews claimed that they treated female and male\nstudents equally and acknowledged the fact that it was their\nsincere belief that all students should have the right to access\nequal opportunities for learning in the classroom, and it is the\nteachers'responsibility to provide an equal learning environ-\nment in the classroom--a claim that was ironically counter-\nbalanced by the actual teacher\u00adstudent interactions that were\nshown to have been overwhelmingly male dominated. This\nis in line with M. Sadker and Sadker (1994) that while teach-\ners may acknowledge gender-equity principles and may\nexpress gender-fair viewpoints, what they actually do in their\nown classes may not necessarily reflect this knowledge.\nGenerally, it can be concluded that teachers are not aware of\ntheir own behavior with the genders and they may uncon-\nsciously make males the focus of instruction, giving them\nmore frequent and more precise attention. Consequently,\nwhen teachers interact less with female students they have\nless chance to talk, which in turn might threaten develop-\nment of their language ability.\nIn further explaining the causes of the inequalities in\nclassrooms, it has been suggested that the greater number of\ninteractions directed toward male students is a result of\nincreased initiations of interactions by male students them-\nselves. Some studies discovered that more males than\nfemales volunteered to answer the questions (Altermatt,\nM. Sadker & Sadker, 1986). Similarly, some of the teachers\ninterviewed in the current study also mentioned that the stu-\ndents'voluntary participation was the likely cause of unequal\ndistribution of interactions.\nHowever, observations in the present study demonstrated\nthat in all classrooms there were active students of both gen-\nders (males and females) who took a considerable number of\nturns. This is a new situation, which in theory, calls for some\nnoticeable changes to the traditional way of distributional\nimbalance.\nThe researchers also observed that, except for some active\nfemales, majority of females were more likely to sit silently,\nwaiting to be called on. In other words, the number of silent\nfemales, not being called on or not calling out in the class-\nrooms, is remarkably higher than the number of silent males\nproportional to their enrollment in the classrooms. This is\nconsistent with the findings of the study conducted by Salata\n(1994) reporting that two thirds of the silent students in col-\nlege classrooms are females, not having any interaction\nwhatsoever with their professors.\nHowever, Morrow (1979) argues even if volunteering is\nthe cause, it is the teachers' responsibility to manage class-\nroom interactions and provide equal opportunities for all stu-\ndents in the classroom. However, if student volunteering\nremains a critical feature of teacher\u00adstudent interactions,\nsimply instructing teachers to call on females more often will\nnot suffice. Efforts should be made to understand the reasons\nbehind females' relative nonparticipation, so that steps can\nbe taken to encourage females to become full participants in\nthe classroom question\u00adanswer interactions. Shomoossi,\nAmouzadeh, and Ketabi (2008) note that some females feel\nthreatened in classrooms characterized by a high reliance on\nparticipation through student volunteering. One way for\nteachers to alleviate the perceived threat of volunteer partici-\npation is to use teaching strategies that defend females\nagainst male dominance such as being aware of subtle gen-\nder bias and in turn equally calling on females even if they\nare not raising their hands.\nBesides the possibility of males initiating more interac-\ntions with teachers as the cause of this unequal distribution\nof interaction, another factor that might have further height-\nened this verbal domination was gender segregation of many\nof classes. In examining the seating pattern of the class-\nrooms, the researchers of the current study observed that\nfemales most commonly sit with other females, and males\ncluster together. As male students talked and called out more,\nteachers were drawn to the noisier male sections of the class,\na development that further silences females. This is also sup-\nported by many classroom observations that have shown\nteachers talk more frequently to males no matter where they\nare in the classroom, but only to females when they are\nnearby (D. Sadker, Sadker, & Thomas, 1981). Other studies\nhave also shown that classroom seating patterns can influ-\nence interaction patterns, and that they could be a compelling\nfactor in determining interaction frequency and time (Yepez,\n1994). Having informal interviews with the students to seek\nthe cause of this segregation, the researchers discovered that\nalthough this segregation is sometimes put in effect by the\nteacher, it is typically done by the students themselves.\nRarely does the teacher intervene to integrate seating and\ngroup work, particularly in higher education. Of course\nmales and females have their own reasons for this segrega-\ntion. When the students were asked why that was the case,\nwhile some of the male students complained that it is their\nfemale classmates who are reluctant to integrate with them,\nthe females voiced their own reason for the reluctance which\nHassaskhah and Roshanzamir 9\nwas the fear they had for mixing with males. They confessed\nthat as soon as they get together with a male classmate to\nwork, other friends would label them as girlfriend/boyfriend\nthat might have its own social consequences.\nWhatever the reason is, M. Sadker and Sadker (1992)\nsuggest when left intact, these segregated grouping patterns\ninfluence the distribution of teacher attention because the\ninstructor is drawn to sections of the room where one par-\nticular gender or group of students are clustered.\nConsequently, one group of students is out of the instructor's\nimmediate visual zone, and literally invisible, they are less\nlikely to be called on to participate, and so they become\nsilent as well. These subtle inequities in attention might have\nan impact on student achievement.\nConclusion and Recommendations for\nFuture Research\nIn general, although it was found that students' gender may\naffect teacher\u00adstudent interaction in adult classrooms, these\nresearchers believe that few teachers set out to discriminate\nagainst their students based on race, ethnicity, gender, or eco-\nnomic class. In other words, it is hard to believe that there is\na teacher, who wakes up in the morning with the intention of\nexcluding any student or class of students, but it happens\ninadvertently, and the effect is withering. The reason perhaps\nis hidden in the nature of this profession. Classrooms are\ncomplex, busy places, and teachers engage in a variety of\ninteractions with their students each day. The speed of these\ninteractions makes it difficult for the teachers to be fully\naware of exactly what is happening (M. Sadker & Sadker,\n1986). As a result of this, problems may arise and as the\nempirical research suggests teachers may, in spite of their\nbest intentions, vary their behavior toward students on the\nbasis of student's gender. Yet, privilege is invisible to those\nGiven that school is not only a place where students\nacquire academic knowledge, but a place where they become\nsocialized and learn to assume particular roles in society,\nteachers' role as models for students, and therefore, their\nactions become important in communicating messages that\nshape students' beliefs and their self-concepts. If teachers,\ninadvertently or not, demonstrate gender-biased actions (e.g.,\ngiving more attention to males, permitting their interruptions\nor attention-drawing behaviors, or asking them more intel-\nlectually challenging questions in comparison with questions\nasked of females), students may come to believe that males\nare expected to be more outspoken and active, while females\nare expected to be quiet and undisruptive and may also inter-\nnalize the message and grow to believe that such differential\ntreatment for males and females is the norm.\nThis calls for developing a training program, like that pro-\nposed by D. Sadker et al. (1984), to enable teachers and\nadministrators to detect this bias and create equitable teach-\ning methods. It is only by making it visible to ourselves that\nwe can eradicate its effects--no matter how unintentional--\non others. Program evaluations indicate that biased teaching\npatterns can be changed, and teachers can achieve equity in\nverbal interactions with their students. When teachers\nbecome aware of differences in the way they interact with\nfemale and male students and when they receive appropriate\nresources and training, they can become more equitable in\ntheir response patterns. Research shows that for elementary\nand secondary school teachers, as well as college instructors,\nthis training leads not only to more equitable teaching but to\nmore effective teaching as well (D. Sadker et al., 1984). As a\nresult, individual educators, teachers and administrators, can\ninsure that instructional strategies and curricular innovations\nbenefit all our students. However, considering the diverging\nempirical results, it would be na\u00efve to attribute all such pat-\nterns solely to student gender (Jones & Dindia, 2004). As\nJones and Dindia (2004) point out, several factors may shape\nteacher-initiated behavior toward students, from among\nwhich individual student factors (such as student gender, stu-\ndent classroom behavior, student achievement, and student\nrace) and teacher factors (such as teacher gender and teach-\ner's gender role orientation) have the most outstanding\ninfluence.\nThus, future research is required to investigate additional\nfactors that are likely to affect teacher\u00adstudent interactions in\nclassrooms, as they may offer explanations of gender differ-\nences in teacher\u00adstudent interaction patterns. Some demo-\ngraphic factors that may be relevant include English language\nproficiency, personality, and the racial or ethnic background\nof teachers and students. It would also be interesting to see\nhow teaching strategies and personality differences among\nteachers correlate with the tendency to interact more with\nstudents of one gender. Researchers suggest that our soci-\nety's expectations and restraints on males and females have\nled us to accept and condone certain behaviors when dis-\nplayed by a member of the expected gender. Future research-\ners could look at students' perceptions, taking into\nconsideration that perceptions and expectations are shaped\nby society and early learning experiences. Finally, the effect\nof a training program concerning gender equity in language,\nteacher interactions, and all other areas of learning on teach-\ners'interactions with students and their attitudes toward gen-\nder roles can be investigated.\nTo reiterate, however complex, additional studies of these\ntypes are needed because the payoff comes in a number of\nways. First, it more accurately portrays what actually occurs\nin the classroom; of course what unfolds depends on the\nteachers' next move. Second, it focuses on \"equity of\naccess\"--a unique feature of the classroom culture criteria\nwhich allows teachers to reflect on their classroom events\nwith a less biased approach, the result of which can be fair\nand equitable treatment of students as individuals and pro-\nviding them with equal access to the full educational\nresources of the learning environment, and finally if the\nresults are taken sincerely and put into practice correctly, it\nwould potentially pave the way for establishing a learning\nenvironment where every idea is a good one and no individ-\nual is left behind.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAltermatt, E.
