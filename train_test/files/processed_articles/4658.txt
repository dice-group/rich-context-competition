    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis short article argues that an adequate response to the implications for governance raised by `Big Data' requires much\nmore attention to agency and reflexivity than theories of `algorithmic power' have so far allowed. It develops this through\ntwo contrasting examples: the sociological study of social actors used of analytics to meet their own social ends (for\nexample, by community organisations) and the study of actors' attempts to build an economy of information more open\nto civic intervention than the existing one (for example, in the environmental sphere). The article concludes with a\nconsideration of the broader norms that might contextualise these empirical studies, and proposes that they can be\nunderstood in terms of the notion of voice, although the practical implementation of voice as a norm means that voice\nmust sometimes be considered via the notion of transparency.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Commentary\nBig Data from the bottom up\nNick Couldry and Alison Powell\n Keywords\nAgency, reflexivity, analytics, political economy, voice, transparency\nIntroduction\nWe are living through a transformation of governance \u00ad\nboth its mechanisms and reference-points \u00ad which is\nlikely to have profound implications for practical pro-\ncesses of government and everyday understandings of\nthe social world. A shift is under way from discrete\nforms of intervention in social space based on intermit-\ntent and/or specific information-gathering to continu-\nous processes of management based on total and\nunremitting surveillance (Ruppert, 2011). Both man-\nagement and government increasingly are becoming\npredicated upon the continuous gathering and analysis\nof dynamically collected, individual-level data about\nwhat people are, do and say (`Big Data'). However mis-\nleading or mythical some narratives around Big Data\nprocesses of data-gathering, data-processing and\norganisational adjustment associated with such narra-\ntives are not mythical; they constitute an important, if\nhighly contested, `fact' with which all social actors must\ndeal. This article will offer a social approach to the\nconstruction and use of such data and related analytics.\nThe possibility of such a social approach to Big Data\nhas, until now, been obscured by unnecessarily general-\nised readings of the consequences of these broad\nchanges. Without a doubt, the information types that\nmanagement and governance take as their starting-\npoint have changed: it is digital infrastructures of col-\nlection, transmission, analysis and presentation that\nhave made possible continuous data-mining.\nCompared to representative sampling, such new\napproaches to data collection are totalising; they are\nalso characterised by the aggregation of multiple data\nsets through the use of calculation algorithms. This\nseemingly increased role for algorithms has led some\ncommentators to focus on the dominance of `algorith-\nmic power' (Lash, 2007), an approach that leaves no\nroom for agency or reflexivity on the part of `smaller'\nactors. We posit that emerging cultures of data collec-\ntion deserve to be examined in a way that foregrounds\nthe agency and reflexivity of individual actors as well as\nthe variable ways in which power and participation are\nconstructed and enacted.\nLondon School of Economics, London, UK\nCorresponding author:\nNick Couldry, Department of Media and Communications, London\nSchool of Economics, Houghton St., London WC2A 2AE, UK.\nEmail: N.Couldry@lse.ac.uk\nBig Data & Society\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (http://\nwww.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/open-\naccess.htm).\nThis more agent-focused inquiry into the conse-\nquences of algorithmic calculation's deep embedding\nin everyday life has been foreshadowed in some earlier\nargument that `algorithmic power' has changed the\nology must also `focus . . . on those who engage with the\nsoftware in their everyday lives'. Such a focus does not\ncome naturally within Lash's broadly philosophical for-\nmulations of issues in social theory which foreground `a\ncollapse of ontology and epistemology' (Lash, 2006:\n581), and a new power-laden regime of `facticity'\nwhy pay close attention to what actors say when they\n`reflect' on their position in the social world? But this\nanalytic closure is unhelpful.\nNeeded instead is a more open enquiry into what\nactual social actors, and groups of actors, are doing\nunder these conditions in a variety of places and set-\ntings. Without denying of course the `generative'\nembedded in modes of calculation, processing and\nrule, we need to remember that social actors are often\nthemselves aware of being classified. Even if they are\nnot privy to the details of when, by whom, and how\nthey have been classified, that this has happened is\nsomething of which they are aware, and indeed one of\nthe main `facts' they have to deal with as social actors.\nhas called people's `classificatory imagination' and,\nover the longer term, the wider `social imaginaries'\naround these new cultures of data collection.\nBeer goes on helpfully to distinguish three levels of\nresulting empirical research: first, regarding the\n`organizations that establish and activate Web 2.0\napplications'; second, regarding the `software infra-\nstructures and their applications on the web'; and\nthird, regarding how the first two levels `play out in\nthe lives of those that use (or do not use) particular\nshort article to build particularly on Beer's third level,\nand on the lessons of our own empirical researches, to\nmap out some more detailed and concrete ways of\nresearching the everyday uses of data and analytics\nfrom a social perspective. The result is to open up a\nmuch wider and more varied space of agency and\nreflexivity than allowed for in philosophical accounts.\nThe likely outcome may be no less critical of Big\nData's implications, but will develop critique through\na more nuanced characterisation of `Big Data' as a\nvariegated space of action, albeit one very different\nfrom the spaces in which pre-digital social actors\noperated.\nDoing social analytics\nOur first example of a more agent-focused account of\nBig Data is what has been called `social analytics' (see\nCouldry et al., forthcoming, for a much more detailed\naccount). A social analytics approach is an explicitly\nsociological treatment of how analytics get used by a\nrange of social actors. Such an approach aims to cap-\nture how particular actors reflect upon, and adjust,\ntheir online presence and the actions that feed into it,\nthrough the use of `analytics'. `Analytics' here is used\nbroadly to cover both basic analytics (the automated\nmeasurement and counting installed within the oper-\nation of digital platforms and associated websites,\napps and tools) and the adjustments made by actors\nthemselves in response to such measurement and count-\ning operations. Platforms that count and sort online\ndata, such as Google and Facebook, work automatic-\nally via algorithms, often allowing users only limited\ndegrees of manual adjustment (van Dijck, 2013).\nOther adjustments around those operations may take\ndirect digital form (a website redesign) or organisa-\ntional form (an adjustment in an organisation's man-\nagement of its resources). In all these cases, the variable\nuse of analytics is a social process involving reflection,\nmonitoring and adjustment.\nBy `social actors' we mean actors with social ends\nover and above the basic aim of generating and analys-\ning data (usually for profit): that basic aim in itself is of\nlittle sociological interest. The broader sociological\ninterest starts when there is some tension, actual or\npotential, between the aims that social actors are\ntrying to achieve and the interpretations of their activ-\nities that analytics generate. This use of the term `social\nanalytics' encompasses, but goes beyond, the everyday\n`technical' use of the term `analytics' to mean the meas-\nurement and reporting of internet data. The mutual\nintertwining of human and material agency is hardly\na special interest when analytics' operations are opaque\nto non-expert social actors who must work hard to\nacquire control over them.\nOne key variable in such research is what is mea-\nsured and analysed, the `object' of analytics. The under-\nlying data's relationship to an organisation's online\npresence may be more or less direct: direct if the data\nis literally about that organisation's online presence\n(numbers of unique users, their characteristics, types\nof interaction with online content); or indirect if the\ndata is not about an organisation's online presence,\nbut is generated or presented online, becoming part of\nhow that organisation is judged by online visitors\n(online reviews, debates). The closeness, or distance,\nof the relation between the object of data analysis\nand the general aims and practice of social actors\n2 Big Data & Society\nclearly will shape the degree of tension and reflexivity\nthat exists over the implementation of analytics. At one\nend of the spectrum will be cases where analytics are\nused directly to support other mechanisms of power\n(e.g. performance management); at the other end will\nbe cases where what is at stake in the use of analytics is\nthe broad redefinition of an organisation's aims and\nperformance, with no direct impact on the evaluation\nor management of individuals. In the former case,\nsocial analytics may merge into the study of manage-\nment and power; in the latter case, social analytics may\nbe something closer to a phenomenology of how social\nactors and organisations with social aims appear to\nthemselves, and to the world, under digital conditions.\nOther variables when doing social analytics will\ninclude the degree of technical expertise of the actors\ninvolved, including the degree to which they can go\nbeyond merely using off-the-shelf analytics to customis-\ning them, or perhaps even developing their own ana-\nlytic tools and data-collection designs. Financial and\nother resources will also affect how far the processes\nwhich social analytics studies can develop, or get\nblocked, for example, if the staff to do the analytic\nwork that would enable a richer re-evaluation of an\norganisation's digital presence cease to be available.\nExpertise and resources are, of course, variables in\nany fieldwork setting.\nWithin these basic parameters, however, social ana-\nlytics promise a rich vein of inquiry into the conditions\nof data use and analytics use, from the perspective of\nsocial actors who are not principally experts in relation\nto data or algorithms, but who look to them to do cer-\ntain work towards other ends. It has so far been explored\nin the context of community and civic activism, but it has\nthe potential to be expanded to many more areas.\nData as media\nFor media scholars more generally, the shift to a data-\nrich environment poses challenges for a robust under-\nstanding of how agency and expression might still work\nwithin that environment. The critical tradition in media\nand communications has largely been concerned with\nthe operation of power in the construction of systems of\nsymbolic mediation \u00ad for example, the function of ideo-\nlogical systems (in the Marxist tradition) or the\nGramscian concept of hegemony. These strategies\nhave allowed media and communication scholars to\n`work backwards' through systems of symbolic medi-\nation in order to understand the process and initial\nstarting points of mediated `messages'. This focus on\nthe symbolic quality of media messages allows us to\nexamine power relationships from several different\nvantage points. Within traditional broadcast media\nforms we can observe how the symbolic control of\nmediated messages solidifies control and results in\nthings like propaganda, but we can also see how alter-\nnative media producers can wrest control of ideas\nand their representation to challenge that kind of\nhegemony.\nBroadcast models have however been overtaken,\nfor important purposes, by models of mass self-\ncommunication. Whereas institutionalised mass media\nis structured to disseminate messages from one to\nmany, mass self-communication is structured to invite\ncontinual input of data by individuals. This reorganisa-\ntion of media production initially seemed to promise a\nreconfiguration of the top-down production of ideology\nand the bottom-up resistance to it, but as political\u00ad\neconomic analyses have developed, we are beginning\nto see how such shifts have also led to the production\nof data replacing the production of audiences.\nIf the exemplary product of institutionalised mass\nmedia is propaganda, the exemplary product of mass\nself-communication is data. A mass media apparatus\nrequests information to be disseminated from the one\nto the many; its economic model uses this information\nto generate an audience whose attention can be sold to\nan advertiser. In the mass self-communication model\nindividuals are still part of an aggregate product to be\nsold, but instead of their attention on a single message\nproduced for broadcast, it is their individual acts of\ncommunication that comprise the `Big Data' and\ndrive much media value-extraction.\nEarly critics of mass self-communication noted that\nthe model encouraged individuals to create `content'\nthat was then sold to others in order to capture their\n`content' is still expressive, even when it is sold to cap-\nture attention. A more complicated issue concerns the\ndata that is produced, often unwittingly, which now\ngenerates much of the value in the newest iteration of\nthe contribution economy. Many everyday activities\nnow produce data without requiring human meaning-\nconstruction (or even basic consent). The rise of sensor\nnetworks has meant that increasingly individuals\nare producing not `content' composed of messages con-\ntaining intrinsic or constructed meaning, but mere data\n\u00ad temperature readings, status updates, location coord-\ninates, tracks, traces and check-ins. Not one of these\nindividual data-types is necessarily meaningful in itself\n\u00ad but taken together, either through aggregation, cor-\nrelation or calculation, such data provide large\namounts of information. The difference between this\nand the `content' that mass self-communication prom-\nises to distribute is that the meaning of data is made not\nsemantically (through expression and interpretation)\nbut through processing \u00ad especially the matching\nof metadata (Boellstorf, 2013). Big Data sets are\ncomposed of numerous pieces of information that can\nCouldry and Powell 3\nbe cross-compared, aggregated and disaggregated and\nmade very finely grained, not things whose creators\nnecessarily endowed with meaning. In mining the\ndata, more insights are made available about more\naspects of everyday life but no opportunity is provided\nfor these insights to be folded back into the experience\nof everyday life. In this context, is there any scope, as\nBoellstorf urges, for integrating the epistemic perspec-\ntives of ethnography back into the calculative logic of\nmeta-data?\nAll along, the political economy of personal data, as\nanticipated by Gandy (1993), has been concerned with\nvalue created through the aggregation and calculation\nof individual traces. Even if we leave aside the expres-\nsive quality of individual acts of communication online,\nthe production of data as a by-product of everyday life\npractices enacts a particular political economics of\nmedia, undertaken within a situation of pervasive sur-\nveillance and generalised authoritarianism (Cohen\n2012). But the potential disconnect between system\nand experience, phenomenology and political economy,\ncan be overcome by examining on the ground agents'\nstrategies for building alternative economies of infor-\nmation. Such alternative economies are being devel-\noped in several areas related to environment and\nsustainability, including projects that use data sources\nto make provenance and supply chains visible, and\nthose that encourage individuals and communities to\ncollect data as a means to make environmental issues\nvisible by challenging conventional data collection.\nAcademic projects like Wikichains (Graham, 2010)\nand start-up companies like Provenance.it (2013) aggre-\ngate various forms of data about the production,\ndistribution and supply chains of manufactured objects\nas a means of drawing attention to their long-term\necological and economic costs. While Provenance.it\nremains anchored in a consumer-based economic\nmodel, it does illustrate how alternative modes of\ndata collection and analysis could shift agency and rep-\nresentation, especially if it permitted for greater reflex-\nivity. Similarly, NGOs like Mapping for Change (2013)\nhave supported individuals and community groups in\ngathering environmental data (like air quality and\nnoise) as a means of engaging with gaps and flaws in\nofficial data. These actions intervene in efforts to use\nsuch environmental data within top-down governance\nprocesses. As Gabrys (2014) identifies, such citizen sci-\nence efforts must be enfolded and imagined in processes\nof environmental governance or `biopolitics 2.0'. These\nexamples illustrate two ways that an alternative eco-\nnomics of information might employ calculation of\nmultiple data sources or generation of alternative\nsources to illustrate or critique power relations,\nalthough they also illustrate the ambiguity of account-\nability within these processes.\nVoice, transparency and power\nThe rise of analytics presents a significant normative\nchallenge for scholars, activists and others who seek\nto understand how humanity, sociability and experi-\nence are represented. The daily practices of grappling\nwith data and with the consequences of data analyses\ngenerate new questions about what and whose power\ngets exercised through such practices, and to what\ndegree such exercises of power are satisfactorily made\naccountable. One approach to these challenges is\nthrough attention to problems of voice (Couldry,\n2010). Voice, understood as a value for social organisa-\ntion (Couldry, 2010: ch. 1), involves taking into account\nagents' practices of giving an account of themselves and\ntheir conditions of life. The value of voice is essential to\nthe workings of any models so far developed of demo-\ncratic institutions, but it is not immediately compatible\nwith a world saturated with the automated aggregation\nof analytic mechanisms that are not, even in principle,\nopen to any continuous human interpretation or\nreview.\nWhile the notion of voice insists upon organisational\nprocesses being accountable to the subjectivities and\nexpressiveness of all, the movement towards more\ncasual, automatic sensing and its calculative rather\nthan epistemic logic seems to eliminate this account-\nability. Yet clearly something similar to `voice' is\nrequired in this new world, and this is not just a\nmatter of democracy: `we have no idea', wrote Paul\nRicoeur, `what a culture would be where no one any\nlonger knew what it meant to narrate things' (Couldry,\nproxy for voice in the algorithmic domain is the\nnotion that data gathering processes ought to be trans-\nparent, and the logic of calculation revealed. A focus on\ntransparency could begin to foreground notions of\naccountability in data calculation, ownership and use.\nNotions of transparency have been discussed with\nrespect to government production and use of data\n(Tkacz, 2012). Yet despite pledging to make public\ndata collection transparent, governments like the US\nand the UK in fact collect much more information\nvia surveillance projects and partnerships with informa-\ntion technology companies. With the reform of the\nUSA's National Security Administration, perhaps\nmore attention will begin to be paid to the data collec-\ntion practices of the technology sector, making more of\nthem visible. This kind of transparency goes part of the\nway to establishing accountability, but it still fails to\naddress accountability and reflexivity. A refined\nconcept of transparency that is sensitive to the\nmeaning that data trails might form (even if it cannot\nbe sensitive to the meaning inherent in their produc-\ntion) might go some way to addressing this. This is a\n4 Big Data & Society\ntricky proposal: unless and until the unconscious pro-\nduction of data can be conceived of as a form of expres-\nsion, the philosophical basis for such an expansive\ntransparency will be difficult to establish. One possible\nway to proceed might be to highlight not just the risks\nof creating and sharing data but the opportunities as\nwell. The practices of social analytics and citizen science\nhave the potential to establish these opportunities,\nambiguous as they may be.\nWe hope that, as the debates about Big Data and\nsociety continue and their democratic stakes become\nclearer, the values implicit in the terms `voice' and\n`transparency' will themselves begin to converge in\nmore satisfying ways than are at present possible.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\nBeer D (2009) Power through the algorithm?
