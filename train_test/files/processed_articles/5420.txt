Until the\nbeginning of 2015, only the retrospective\nCGM device was available in general\nJapanese hospitals, and in February 2015, a\nsensor-augmented pump was finally intro-\nduced to the Japanese market. However,\nthere are no studies on the usefulness of\ntreatment guidance using CGM for glycaemic\ncontrol in Japanese patients, especially in those\nwith T2DM. Consequently, the present study\ninvestigated whether the iPro\u00d52 (a wireless\nretrospective CGM device; the most popular\nCGM in Japan), is useful for glycaemic control\nand therapeutic satisfaction in Japanese people\nwith T2DM receiving insulin treatment.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nPatients who fulfilled the following inclusion\ncriteria at registration were included in the\nstudy: (i) patients with T2DM on insulin\ninjection therapy; (ii) age > 20 years; (iii)\nregular visitors to the outpatient clinic at\nJuntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan\n(iv) HbA1c\n(National Glycohemoglobin\nStandardization Program [NGSP]) ranged\nmonths prior to study enrolment; HbA1c\nfluctuations were within \u00c6 0.5% over the\nsame time period. The above selected patients\nwith T2DM were excluded from the study\nwhen any of the following conditions was\ndiagnosed at registration: (i) proliferative ret-\ninopathy; (ii) serious liver disease (aspartate\naminotransferase and/or alanine aminotrans-\nferase levels>100 IU/l); (iii) serious kidney\ndisease (serum creatinine level >2.0 mg/dl);\n(iv) acute heart failure; (v) active malignancy;\n(vi) serious pancreatic disease; (vii) preg-\nnancy; (viii) serious infectious disease; (ix)\ntrauma injury.\nStudy design\nThis was an open-label, two-arm, rando-\nmized controlled study. Patients meeting the\nabove criteria were assigned randomly by a\ncomputer-generated method to either the\nintervention (I) group or the noninterven-\ntion (N-I) group. None of the patients had\nused a CGM device within 1 year prior to\nthe start of the clinical trial. According to\nlevels\ndecreased from the baseline after interven-\ntion using CGM by variable amounts\nchanges, the difference in HbA1c\nreduction\nbetween the two groups in this study was\nConsidering a two-sided a-level of 5% and\na power (1-b) of 90%, the appropriate\nnumber of patients was considered to be 34\n(17 patients per study group).\nPatients were asked to visit the hospital $5\ndays before the start of the study period, and\nwere equipped with a wireless retrospective\nCGM device (iPro\u00d52; Medtronic, Northridge,\nCA, USA) with the aid of medical staff.12 In\nthe present study, all patients applied the\nCGM to continuously record 4\u00ad5 days of\ndata before every visit, including a recording at\nbaseline. This type of recording was repeated\ntwice throughout the duration of the study ($8\nmonths) (Figure 1).\nDuring each 4\u00ad5-day CGM recording\nperiod using the iPro\u00d52, patients in both\nstudy groups were instructed to undertake\nself-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)\nthree times using a handheld blood glucose\nmeter (Glutest\u00d5 Neo Super; Sanwa Kagaku\nKenkyusho, Nagoya, Japan) on the first and\nlast days and four times on the other days\nfor calibration purposes. Patients were also\nasked to keep a diary that recorded the\namount and type of food consumed every day.\nThe proportion of time spent with blood\n>140mg/dl as determined by CGM was\ncalculated using the following equation: pro-\nportion of time spent in range (%)\u00bc time\nAt the scheduled outpatient clinic appoint-\nment, patients handed the CGM and SMBG\ndata to the study team for downloading. Data\nfrom three consecutive days from the second\nday of the CGM recording period were used\nto compute the blood glucose levels. For\npatients in the I group, two trained diabetol-\nogists from the study team provided guidance\nduring an interview with the patient of at least\na 15-min duration, where they discussed a\ntreatment strategy in terms of lifestyle\nchanges using a printout of the patient's\nCGM data, in addition to the usual routine\nclinical examination (range, 5\u00ad10min). This\n15-min guidance interview included at least\nthree processes: (i) the trained diabetologists\nfrom the study team used a printout of the\npatient's CGM data to explain when blood\nglucose levels were >140 mg/dl and/or\n<70mg/dl; (ii) the patient was encouraged\nto find the reasons for high or low blood\nglucose levels in front of the trained diabetol-\nogist from the study team; (iii) the patient was\nprovided with instructions about improving\nhis/her blood glucose levels, primarily by\nchanging his/her lifestyle and secondarily by\nchanging the dose of insulin or other medica-\ntions. Suggestions made by the study team\nwere written down on paper for the patients\nand physicians. The physician in charge then\ndecided whether or not to adopt the sugges-\ntions when they were discussed with the\npatient during the routine visit. In the N-I\ngroup, both the patients and physicians in\ncharge were prohibited from seeing the CGM\ndata until the end of the study, so the\ntreatment strategy for the N-I group was\ndecided based on the results of routine blood\ntests such as HbA1c\nand blood glucose\nanalysis.\nThe routine visit with the physicians in\ncharge was usually scheduled once every\n2 months; only the physicians in charge could\nchange the insulin dose and other medica-\ntions. Blood and urine tests, and measurement\nof body weight and body mass index, were\nperformed using standard methods at every\nvisit. Blood pressure was measured using\nroutine methods. Serum lipids (total choles-\nterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, tri-\nglycerides) were quantified using an automatic\nbiochemistry analyser (LABOSPECT\u00d5 008\nHitachi Automatic Analyzer; Hitachi High-\nTechnologies, Tokyo, Japan). HbA1c\nwas quantified using a high-performance\nliquid chromatography analyser (HLC-723\u00d5\nG8; Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan).\nPatients were instructed at the beginning\nand end of the study to complete the Diabetes\nTreatment Satisfaction Questionnaire\nThe primary endpoint was a change in\nlevel from baseline. The secondary\nendpoint was a change in the DTSQ score\nfrom baseline. The study protocol was\napproved by the Human Ethics Committee\nFigure 1.

In these patients, the\nresults indicated that treatment guidance\nusing retrospective CGM data was not\nuseful with regard to improving people's\ntherapeutic outcome, specifically their\nlevels.\nIn this present study, the mean BMI of\nthe study population was 27 kg/m2.\nAccording to data from the Japan Diabetes\nClinical Data Management Study Group,\nthe mean BMI of Japanese patients with\nm2 for women.14 In comparison, the patients\nin the present study were relatively obese. In\naddition, the baseline HbA1c\nwas >8% and\nthe duration of T2DM was >16 years,\nindicating that patients in this present\nstudy were obese with poorly controlled\nT2DM. CGM data showed that over half\nof the 24-h blood glucose sampling period\nwas spent with a blood glucose concentration\n>140 mg/dl, but almost none of the time was\nspent with blood glucose concentrations at\nhypoglycaemic levels (<70mg/dl). Given that\nCGM is useful for detecting unrecognised\nepisodes of hypoglycaemia, it is likely that\nthese patients tried to avoid hypoglycaemia\nduring treatment, probably based on advice\nfrom their physicians.\nIn a study of patients with T1DM, the use\nof real-time CGM and intensive insulin regi-\nmens resulted in reduced HbA1c\nAnother study also showed the usefulness of\nretrospective CGM for T1DM.6 In the case of\npatients with T1DM, the dose of insulin can\nbe easily increased if levels of hyperglycaemia\nsuggest a deficiency of the insulin effect. In\nthis present study, physicians increased the\ninsulin dose by 2.2 \u00c6 4.4 IU/day in the I group\nthroughout the study period. This change in\ninsulin dose was not clinically meaningful\nwith regard to causing an improvement in\nglycaemic control. The small change in insulin\nprobably reflected the physicians' desires to\navoid further body weight gain (caused by\noverdosing of insulin) in obese patients. It is\nalso possible that physicians preferred their\npatients to change their lifestyles regarding\ndiet and exercise rather than try aggressive\ninsulin titration. However, no significant\nbody weight reduction was noted in this\nstudy, indicating that the clinical management\naided by the CGM data used in this study did\nnot satisfactorily change the lifestyle of\npatients. There are some important studies\nindicating that CGM is useful for specific\npopulations such as pregnant women5 and\npatients on haemodialysis.8 In contrast,\nunstructured retrospective use of CGM does\nnot provide any benefit for glycaemic control\nin people with uncontrolled diabetes.7\nBased on changes in DTSQ scores, CGM\nintervention did not significantly improve\npatient satisfaction. There was a tendency\nfor less satisfaction expressed by patients in\nthe I group compared with the N-I group at\nthe end of the study, although the difference\nbetween the two groups was not significant.\nThis could be due to the fact that the score\nfor the perception of the frequency of\nhyperglycaemia at the end of the study was\nsignificantly increased in the I group com-\npared with the N-I group. Patients in the\nI group could have become much more con-\nscious about blood glucose levels based on the\nclose observation of their CGM data, and they\nwere not satisfied with the results of treatment\nbecause of the psychological burden.\nPatients with diabetes are at risk of emo-\ntional problems, such as depression and\ndiabetes-related distress.16\u00ad18 Studies have\nfound that SMBG increased the likelihood\nof depression and did not improve diabetes\ncontrol.19,20 However, in the Structured\nTesting Program (STeP) study, strictly `struc-\ntured SMBG' for three consecutive days\ntended to have a positive impact on psycho-\nsocial outcome and reductions in HbA1c\nrelative to the control group.21 In the STeP\nstudy, patients received training before the\nstudy on how to respond to the results of\nSMBG.21 Each of the participating phys-\nicians also received training on the correct\ninterpretation of the structured data and was\nprovided with an algorithm that described\nvarious pharmacological and lifestyle treat-\nment strategies.21 This suggests that `struc-\ntured SMBG' seems to be the true key for\nimprovement. The intervention in the present\nstudy involved 15-min consultations with\ninstructions provided by the trained diabe-\ntologists, but the patients and physicians in\ncharge did not receive training before the\nstudy. It is possible that the three 15-min\nconsultations throughout the study course\ndid not help patients in making meaningful\ninterpretations of their blood glucose levels\nmeasured by the CGM, or in improving their\ndiabetes control. If patients in this current\nstudy were unable to manage their blood\nglucose levels using the CGM data, it would\nbe understandable that they might have felt\nguilty about having high blood glucose levels\nand then subsequently experienced dissatis-\nfaction during the study. Construction of\n`structured CGM' with some algorithms, for\nthe physicians and the patients, describing\nvarious treatment strategies to improve psy-\nchosocial and diabetes control might be\nnecessary.\nThis present study had a number of\nlimitations. First, it did not evaluate the\nusefulness of CGM for avoiding nocturnal\nhypoglycaemia based on proper basal insulin\ntitration, because almost none of the patients\npresented with hypoglycaemia. Secondly, the\nstudy did not evaluate lifestyle changes made\nin response to the CGM data. Thirdly, the\nsample size was small and further studies that\ninclude larger populations are needed to\nconfirm the present findings.\nIn conclusion, this present study showed\nthat treatment guidance using retrospective\nCGM data neither improved glycaemic\ncontrol nor therapeutic outcome in obese\npoorly-controlled patients with T2DM\ntreated with insulin at an outpatient clinic.\nTo elucidate the usefulness of CGM data,\nfurther studies are needed to develop effect-\nive interventions by using retrospective\nor real-time CGM for the improvement\nof diabetes control and therapeutic satisfac-\ntion, in Japanese outpatients with T2DM.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nA.K. has received lecture fees from Kissei\nPharma, Sanofi and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.\nY.F. has received lecture fees from Novartis\nPharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly, and research\nfunds from Novartis Pharmaceuticals, MSD,\nand Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
