Bates*\n\u00c3 icukic@staffmail.ed.ac.uk (IC); tim.bates@ed.ac.uk (TCB)\n Introduction\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression are two of the major disease burdens [1,2]. The\ntwo diseases are comorbid [3,4], and some research suggests they may causally influence each\nother [5\u00ad7]. However, a third variable, the personality trait of neuroticism, is also strong and\nwell-documented risk factor for depression [8,9], and, to a lesser degree, for CVD onset [10,11]\nand mortality [12,13] (although some studies failed to detect the latter link: see, for example\n[14]). This raises the possibility that neuroticism may account, in part, for the excess heart dis-\nease risk associated with depression. One suggestion for understanding these relations is to in-\ncorporate measures of autonomic tone, a function strongly linked to negative affect [15]. Here\nwe investigate this possibility using heart rate variability (HRV) a normally varying biomarker\nbased on beat to beat intervals [16,17] and previously linked to CVD and depression [18,19].\nReduced HRV has been associated with elevated levels of CVD [20\u00ad23], and depression\n[24,25]. A causal link between heart function and depression was recently demonstrated in a\nCitation: Cuki I, Bates TC (2015) The Association\nbetween Neuroticism and Heart Rate Variability Is Not\nFully Explained by Cardiovascular Disease and\nAcademic Editor: Xian Wu Cheng, Nagoya\nUniversity, JAPAN\nCopyright: \u00a9 2015 Cuki, Bates.

Tulen et al. [27] report that reduced HRV\nin major depressive disorder may be dependent on high levels of trait anxiety, potentially sup-\nporting a chronic link of HRV to neuroticism rather than an acute link to depressed mood.\nHere we test whether neuroticism and HRV are associated controlling for their mutual associa-\ntions with depression and cardiovascular disease, and comorbidity between the two diseases.\nWe tested this hypothesis using path structural equation modelling (SEM) in a large popula-\ntion-based sample. This allows explicit testing of paths in the presence of mediating variables\nand other associations among variables [28]. Our baseline model is shown in Fig 1. We tested\nmodifications of this model to examine support for direct influences of neuroticism on HRV,\nand for indirect influences via cardiovascular disease or depression. A significant reduction in\nmodel fit for a model lacking a direct contribution of neuroticism to HRV would support the\nhypothesis that associations of neuroticism with HRV cannot be explained by links to CVD\nand/or depression alone.\nFig 1. Structural model of the relationship of neuroticism with HRV, cardiovascular disease, and depression. Dotted paths are non-significant (95%\nCIs in brackets). Note. Covariates (age, sex, height, weight, BMI) are omitted for clarity. See S1 Table for the full list of path estimates.\nHeart Rate Variability and Neuroticism\nWe were able to examine HRV measured in two conditions: at rest, and under stress. This\nallowed initial tests of whether neuroticism functions as a trait marker for cardiovascular health\n(i.e., is associated with HRV under both baseline and stress conditions, our preferred hypothe-\nsis) or was rather related to HRV only in the stress condition. We first tested this relationship,\nand then moved to the main modeling hypotheses: that neuroticism would show significant\npath loadings on heart disease, on depression, and on HRV, independent of each other. All\nanalyses controlled for covariates linked to HRV: age, sex, height, weight, and BMI.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were members of the Project 4: Bioindicators of the MacArthur Foundation Sur-\nvey for Midlife Development in the U.S cohort (MIDUS) follow-up study (MIDUS II). MIDUS\nI was a nationally representative sample of 7,108 respondents derived from 50,000 households\nselected by random telephone dialing [29]. All MIDUS I participants were followed-up in the\nMIDUS II National Survey. These participants were assessed on a wide range of variables, in-\ncluding demographic characteristics, personality, and extensive mental and physical health\nto participate in the Bioindicators project (Project 4), designed to add comprehensive biological\nassessments on a subsample of MIDUS respondents. Project 4 participants were selected based\non having previously participated in either the longitudinal survey sample (n = 1,054) or Mil-\nwaukee sample (n = 201). This subsample attended a two-day hospital clinic visit where they\nunderwent a series of neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, immune and physical assessments, in-\ncluding the continuous ECG recording reported here. A detailed description of the Project 4\nsample composition is provided elsewhere [30]. All available data from these 1,255 participants\nin Project 4 were included in the present analyses (mean age 54.52 years, SD = 11.71). In total,\nMeasures\nNeuroticism. Neuroticism was assessed using an adjective-rating scale derived from exist-\ning Big Five trait lists and inventories [31]. The adjectives were: \"moody\", \"worrying\", \"ner-\nvous\" and \"calm\". Participants rated themselves on each item using a Likert scale ranging from\n1: \"Not at all\" to 4: \"A lot\". The scale is a valid and reliable assessment of neuroticism [32], and\ncorrelates highly with standard neuroticism scales [33].\nDepression. The clinical depression measure was part of the short form of the Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview, Version 10 (CIDI) [34]. This screening interview is based\non the definitions and criteria as described by the third edition-revised of the American Psychi-\natric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R)\n[34]. For the diagnosis of major depression, a period of at least two weeks of either depressed\naffect or anhedonia felt most of the days was required over the 12 months prior to the inter-\nview, with at least of four other associated symptoms including disrupted eating or sleeping\nhabits, problems with concentration, or suicidal thoughts or actions. The final variable ranged\nfrom 0 to 7, where 0 represented a participants diagnosed as negative for major depression,\nand scores between one and seven represented the range of the symptoms severity [35]. The\nscale showed satisfactory validity and reliability [36].\nHeart Disease. Heart disease was assessed via a pre-screening question: \"Have you ever\nhad any of the following conditions/illnesses?--Heart disease\". If the subject did not respond\nHeart Rate Variability and Neuroticism\n\"no\", they were asked if they had heart disease diagnosed by a physician, and this binary vari-\nable was used here [29].\nHRV measures. Continuous recording of the electrocardiogram (ECG) was taken as part\nof Project 4 of Wave II of the MIDUS study, conducted 2005\u00ad2009. The recording was made in\na seated position, during the psychophysiology protocol that consisted of a baseline period fol-\nlowed by a cognitive stressor, recovery period, and the second cognitive stressor in the duration\nof six minutes each. The beat-to-beat waveforms were used to assess heart rate variability,\nnamely, variability of intervals between two consecutive ventricular depolarizations (also\nknown as RR, or NN intervals). Analog signals were digitalized at a sampling rate of 500 Hz by\na 16-bit National Instruments analog-to-digital (A/D) board, and then processed by proprie-\ntary event detection software that identified RR waves. Researchers then visually inspected\nwaveforms to correct any software errors, following the standard procedures [37,38]. The re-\nsulting waveforms were then used to calculate standard measures of cardiovascular reactivity\nfrom both time and frequency domain. Standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR)\nwas used as a measure of general autonomic nervous system function variability [39]. Frequen-\ncy domain measures were used to assess sympathetic and vagal activity separately, namely low\nassess the latter [39,40]. These measures proved to be reproducible and with useful prognostic\nvalue in both long term and short term recordings in clinical patients as well as in normal sub-\njects [39]. All HRV measures were log-transformed.\nCognitive stressors. HRV was measured under two conditions: Stress and Baseline. Stress\nwas induced using two cognitive stressors: mental arithmetic and attentional control (Stroop).\nThe MATH task [41,42] is a standard mental arithmetic stressor used in laboratory studies of\nheart reactivity. Subjects perform addition and subtraction tasks that are adaptively altered to\nincrease or decrease difficulty as a stressor. The second cognitive stressor, the Stroop Color-\nWord Task again involved adaptive presentation of Stroop stimuli as a function of task perfor-\nmance in similar way to that used in the MATH task. Details about the presentation and a full\nlist of measures obtained during the protocol are provided elsewhere [30].\nCovariates. Following Koelsch, Enge & Jentschke [43], height, weight, BMI, and age were\nused as covariates. Height was recorded in units of inches, and weight in pounds. All covariates\nwere treated as continuous variables.\nProcedure\nThe psychophysiology project was part of a two-day data collection protocol. All measures\nwere conducted in hospital clinics, and the HRV examination was carried out during the morn-\ning of the second day of participants' hospital stay. The two cognitive stressors were presented\nin randomized order. The total test time was approximately half an hour.\nAnalyses\nTo assess and compare the associations between neuroticism and HRV measures under stress\nand at baseline we fitted three linear regression models with neuroticism as a dependent vari-\nable and a HRV measure at stress, at baseline, and combined as predictors. To assess whether\nthe association between neuroticism and HRV is dependent of diagnosed depression and CVD\nwe next removed participants with either condition from the sample and fit the same regres-\nsion models as before. To assess direct and indirect associations of neuroticism, HRV and the\nclinical variables, we fit and compare a series of SEM models. All regression and SEM models\nare adjusted for age, age2 sex, BMI, height and weight. A total of 1,255 subjects were available.\nOf these, 908 had complete data for variables, including all covariates. Neuroticism was\nHeart Rate Variability and Neuroticism\navailable for 955 subjects. Structural Equation Modelling used Full Information Maximum\nLikelihood (FIML)[44], and thus utilised all data available. Regressions vary in the effective\nnumber of subjects, as reflected in the degrees of freedom in these analyses. The analyses were\nconducted in the R 3.1.3 environment [45], and SEM models were fitted using the OpenMx\nResults\nDescriptive statistics for the personality and cardiovascular reactivity measures are shown in\nTable 1. A hundred and forty three (11.4%) participants were classified as having depression,\nand 144 participants (11.4%) had CVD. Of them, sixteen participants (1.4%) were positive for\nboth depression and CVD. Heart function measures from the Stroop and math challenges cor-\nrelated highly (r's ranging from .81 to .91, all p-values <.001), and HRV measures from the\ntwo challenge conditions were therefore combined in all subsequent analyses. For the subjects\nwho had valid data for one task only (n = 63), the single available measure was used in place of\nthe average.\nWe first used multiple regression to examine whether higher levels of neuroticism were as-\nsociated with reduced HRV under stress and at baseline. Neuroticism scores were used as the\ndependent variable and SDRR under stress, and SDRR at baseline as the independent variables,\nand age, sex, BMI, height, and weight were entered as covariates prior to SDRR. Regression re-\nsults are described in full in Table 2. The stress model showed a significant overall effect (R2 =\n<.001). Same was true for the association between neuroticism and SDRR in the baseline con-\nSDRR was significantly associated with neuroticism (p = .002) thus suggesting neuroticism as a\ntrait marker for heart function. We next tested whether SDRR in both baseline and under stress\nwas independently associated with elevated neuroticism. The model containing both variables\never, whichever of the two SDRR variables was entered first rendered the second non-signifi-\ncant, suggesting multicollinearity of these indicators. We therefore computed the mean SDRR\nTable 1. Ns, Means and Standard Deviations for Experimental variables and Confounders.\nFemale Male Total\nNote: BMI = Body Mass Index, SDRR = Standard Deviation of R to R intervals, LF = Low Frequency Heart Rate Power, HF = High Frequency Heart Rate\nPower. \"Stress\" and \"baseline\" refer to testing under the stress and baseline conditions respectively.\nHeart Rate Variability and Neuroticism\nunder baseline and under stress. A model using this combined SDRR variable as a predictor of\nneuroticism, using the same covariates as above gave a highly significant effect.\nUsing a test procedure and covariates identical to those used for SDRR, models treating HF\nand LF power as predictors of neuroticism showed significant effects, for both baseline and\nstress conditions, and did not add to the prediction of neuroticism over and above mean\nSDRR. This ability of both HF and LF power to predict neuroticism has implications for inter-\npretations of HRV measures as indicators of autonomic effects on heart function. It is known\nthat respiratory pattern modulates HRV independent from autonomic regulation [47] and re-\nspiratory pattern has been linked to negative affect [48]. While we did not attempt to measure\nrespiration effects, inspiratory vagal control is relatively specific to HF-HRV [49]. This allows\nus to test, to some extent, the role of respiratory influences relative to autonomic influences.\nThe two power measures were similar in the ability to predict neuroticism (pHF\n=\n.003), thus ruling out the possibility that HRV is mostly reflecting respiratory effects on (or\nof) neuroticism.\nWe next moved to test our hypothesis that HRV would be related to neuroticism, indepen-\ndent of CVD and depression. To test whether the previous results were dependent on partici-\npants in the sample who had been diagnosed with either depression or CVD, we removed these\nsubjects and reran the regression models on this new healthy sample (n = 800). This did not\nchange the sign or the magnitude of any of the associations between HRV measures and neu-\nroticism. Whether recorded under stress or at baseline, SDRR was a significant predictor of\nneuroticism in the disease free sub-set (p = .001 and.009 respectively). Finally, the combined\nmeasure of SDRR under stress and baseline conditions was also significantly related to neuroti-\ncism (p = .002). These findings confirmed that the relationships seen between neuroticism and\nHRV were independent of the presence of CVD and depression.\nWe next incorporated all our measures into a structural equation modelling framework, to\nexamine simultaneously the relationship among these factors (see Fig 1). As shown in Fig 1,\nthe full model includes direct effects of neuroticism on HRV, on CVD and on depression, and\nallowed for covariation among HRV and CVD, CVD and depression, and between HRV and\ndepression. The model also included covariates of age, sex, BMI, height, and weight which were\nTable 2. Relationships between SDRR measure of HRV and Neuroticism.\nEst. S.E. t P Est. S.E. T P Est.

For clarity, these covariates are\nnot shown in Fig 1, but all paths and estimates are shown in S1 Table.\nGiven the indifference of relationships among our variables to the two frequency indicators\nof HRV, the mean SDRR score was used as the HRV measure in the rest of the analyses. The\npath between HRV and depression was not significant, and dropping it did not significantly re-\nduce model fit (p = .287). We then moved on to test the association between neuroticism and\nHRV. Dropping the path from neuroticism to HRV significantly reduced model fit (2(2) =\n15.85, p <.001), supporting association of neuroticism and HRV, independent of other paths.\nWe next tested the association between neuroticism and depression, with a similar result:\nthen tested whether HRV and depression were independently related to CVD. Dropping either\nthe HRV to CVD path, or the path from depression to CVD significantly reduced the model fit\nFinally, to test the hypothesis that neuroticism has an independent contribution to CVD, we\ntested dropping the path from neuroticism to CVD--this significantly reduced model fit (2(2)\n= 52.02, p <.001) supporting a distinct association of neuroticism on CVD. (See Table 3 for a\nlist of all model comparisons).\nDiscussion\nWe found that neuroticism was significantly associated with HRV. This was true both under\nstress and at baseline. Structural equation modeling indicated significant associations of neu-\nroticism with HRV, depression, and CVD, with additional covariation between CVD and de-\npression. The direct path between HRV and depression was estimated at near zero and was\nnon-significant, suggesting that the covariation of depression with HRV may not be causal but\nmay rather reflect influences of CVD and neuroticism. Significant associations of neuroticism\nwith depression and CVD, however, suggest that neuroticism is a potential candidate explain-\ning some of the comorbidity of CVD and depression. All the results were robust to the inclu-\nsion of covariates of age, sex, height, weight, and BMI. Jointly, then, the results suggest an\nassociation of neuroticism with cardiovascular activity, and significant associations with\nmultiple diseases.\nThe significant association of neuroticism with HRV enhances previous work using differ-\nthat dispositional negative affectivity may be more important as a causal factor in the\nTable 3.

Our results further sup-\nport this claim, and suggest that neuroticism, one of the five major domains of personality,\nmay be an excellent measure of the trait affective responsiveness factor influencing heart dis-\nease, possibly both directly and via its links to depression and reduced heart reactivity. Such a\nmodel would be in keeping with RdOC models of depression [53]. Additionaly, the finding\nthat individual variations in personality dimensions may reflect differences in neurophysiologi-\ncal functioning extends the classic ideas of Eysenck [54] and Gray (for a review of Gray's BIS\nand BAS systems in relation to heart function see [55]).\nIt was interesting that the association between neuroticism and HRV in the baseline condi-\ntion was comparable to that found for HRV in the stress condition. The finding that the subop-\ntimal cardiac reactivity pattern shown by high-neuroticism individuals was cross-situational is\nat first glance anomalous: one might expect heart function under stress to more clearly reflect\nemotional lability. Its presence at baseline may indicate high neuroticism is chronically associ-\nated with adverse heart function, not only during maladaptive responses to stress.\nLimitations\nThis study is not without limitations. HRV under laboratory conditions generalizes only weak-\nly to real-life stress responses [56]. This would act to obscure relationships with HRV reactions\nto stress. Countering this, in our study, neuroticism was significantly related not only to HRV\nunder stress but also to HRV under baseline conditions, suggesting that cardiovascular func-\ntion may be related to neuroticism independently of stress. Nevertheless, associations of neu-\nroticism and HRV may be stronger, or show interactions with response to in-vivo stressors and\nthis should be explored. Furthermore, individual differences in HRV may not only reflect indi-\nvidual differences in heart function, but this link may be obscured by their relationship to respi-\nration [47]. However, given that this relationship is more specific to HF measures of HRV [49],\nand that in our study effects of HF, LF and SDRR measures of HRV all had effects comparable\nin size and direction, we conclude that the link of HRV to respiration did not affect our results.\nHeart disease includes a broad range of conditions with heterogeneous etiologies and pre-\nsentations. Positive responder to the question about heart disease include patients with condi-\ntions ranging from atherosclerotic CHD (the condition most strongly linked with negative\naffect) to congenital valve effects [29]. Future studies should examine the specificity of links be-\ntween neuroticism, depression, HRV and specific cardiovascular conditions. Finally, our sam-\nple was cross-sectional. Therefore, we were limited in our ability to assign directionality in the\nassociations of HRV and neuroticism. Future studies should include three or more waves of as-\nsessment to parse directionality.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that HRV is a biomarker for neuroticism, and that neurot-\nicism can account for portions of the phenotypic association of HRV with CVD, and depres-\nsion. As such, it is a viable target for translational research aimed at reducing risk for these\ncommon and serious diseases.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Table.
