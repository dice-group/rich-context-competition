Previous research\nhas shown that self-esteem decreased among various sectors of the population, from middle school students to adults\nbetween 1984 and 2010 in Japan. However, it was unclear whether such temporal changes are also present at earlier\nstages of development (e.g., in elementary school) and in individual subgroups (e.g., each gender and developmental stage).\nIdentifying such boundary conditions of temporal change will contribute to a better understanding of how cultures change\nover time. We analyzed representative and large-sample time-series data collected by the Japanese government in 1999 and\n2006. Results showed that self-esteem decreased among elementary and middle school students regardless of gender and\ndevelopmental stage. We suggest that from an early stage of development and among a broad range of the population in\nJapan, people's general self-evaluations became more negative between 1999 and 2006.\n",

There are variations in how self-\nesteem is defined by scientists, but a common aspect is that\nit refers to the positivity of a person's global evaluation of\nthe self (e.g., Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs,\n2003). Many studies have investigated how self-esteem is\nrelated to psychological and physical well-being (e.g.,\n1995) or social behavior (e.g., Leary, Tambor, Terdal, &\nuted to a better understanding of human psychology and\nbehavior.\nTemporal Changes in Self-Esteem in\nthe United States\nSelf-esteem has been investigated not only as a phenomenon\nat a single point in time or over a short period of time but also\nhow it changes over the years. By investigating how psycho-\nlogical tendencies (e.g., self-esteem) change over time, we\ncan better understand how a culture/society changes over the\nyears and how socio-economic environments influence\nhuman psychology and behavior (e.g., Twenge, 2015;\nStudies have described how self-esteem has changed over\nthe years in the United States. Twenge and Campbell (2001)\nconducted a cross-temporal meta-analysis of studies that\nused Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale (RSES; for a\nreview of cross-temporal meta-analysis, see Twenge, 2011).\nResults showed that self-esteem increased among college\n& Campbell, 2001). In addition, they conducted the same\nanalysis on studies using the Coopersmith Self-Esteem\nInventory (SEI; Coopersmith, 1967) and showed that chil-\ndren and early adolescents' self-esteem decreased from 1965\nGentile, Twenge, and Campbell (2010) showed that self-\nesteem increased among middle school, high school, and\nsame type of analysis on RSES scores.\n1Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan\n2Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nYuji Ogihara, Department of Cognitive Psychology in Education, Graduate\nSchool of Education, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Honmachi, Sakyo-Ku,\nEmail: ogihara.yuji.3w@kyoto-u.ac.jp\nLosing Confidence Over Time: Temporal\nChanges in Self-Esteem Among Older\nChildren and Early Adolescents in Japan,\nYuji Ogihara1,2, Yukiko Uchida1, and Takashi Kusumi1\n Keywords\nself-esteem, confidence, temporal change, cultural change, Japan\n2 SAGE Open\nTemporal Changes in Self-Esteem in\nJapan\nCompared with the literature investigating the United\nStates, there has been little research on temporal changes in\nself-esteem in other cultural contexts.

It has been suggested that Japanese culture has\nbecome more individualistic at least in some respects\nmight expect Japanese people to have higher self-esteem.\nThis is because in individualistic societies, people have many\nopportunities to interact with new people and to choose more\ndesirable relationships (e.g., Yuki & Schug, 2012).\nConsequently, it is adaptive to have higher self-esteem in\nindividualistic cultures (Falk, Heine, Yuki, & Takemura,\nUnited States where culture has changed toward greater indi-\nvidualism (e.g., DeWall, Pond, Campbell, & Twenge, 2011;\nhas gone up over time (Gentile et al., 2010; Twenge &\nCampbell, 2001). Why this has not occurred in Japan may be\nbecause, historically, Japan has not been an individualistic\nculture. As a result, rapid changes toward individualism may\nhave caused people to experience conflicts and difficulties in\nadapting to it (Ogihara & Uchida, 2014; Ogihara, Uchida, &\nHowever, the previous research in Japan did not suffi-\nciently examine temporal changes in self-esteem by sub-\ngroup. To be clear, temporal changes in self-esteem by\ndevelopmental stage and gender were not fully investigated.\nIdentifying possible boundary conditions of the phenomenon\nshould be a key to revealing the question of why self-esteem\nhas decreased in East Asian cultures. We detail these limita-\ntions and how they can be overcome below.\nTemporal Changes in Self-Esteem by\nDevelopmental Stage in Japan\nThe previous research (Oshio et al., 2014) has two limita-\ntions. First, it leaves unclear whether self-esteem also\ndecreased in the segment of the population that is younger\nthan middle school age. The RSES was developed for people\nin mid-to-late adolescence and has been administered mainly\nto college students. When measuring the self-esteem of chil-\ndren,scalesotherthanRSESareoftenused(e.g.,Coopersmith\nSEI; Coopersmith, 1967; for details, seeTwenge & Campbell,\n2001). As it was based on a cross-temporal meta-analysis of\nthe RSES, it is understandable that this research did not suf-\nficiently look at the pre-middle-school segment of the popu-\nlation. However, it is important to identify from which\ndevelopmental stage temporal change emerges to uncover\nthe mechanisms or processes of cultural/societal change.\nThis logic is also found in research examining the develop-\nmental stage from which cultural difference emerges. Prior\nresearch has shown that cultural differences in certain psy-\nchological and behavioral tendencies emerge after entering\nelementary school (e.g., Duffy, Toriyama, Itakura, &\nimplies that elementary school might be an important place\nfor the acquisition of cultural practices or values. Given that\nself-esteem is essentially influenced by cultural factors (e.g.,\nHeine, Lehman, Markus, & Kitayama, 1999; Schmitt &\nAllik, 2005), declines in self-esteem should be found not\nonly for middle school students but also for elementary\nschool students. Hence, in this study, we examined whether\nor not self-esteem among elementary school students also\ndecreased.\nSecond, it is not clear whether self-esteem decreased\namong both middle and high school students, as the previous\nresearch summed the average scores of middle schoolers and\nhigh schoolers and analyzed them together (Oshio et al.,\n2014). It is possible that only one of the two decreased while\nthe other remained constant, or that one of the two increased\nslightly while the other decreased significantly. This combin-\ning of scores may have been necessitated by small sample\nsizes (the total sample size was 39), which may be unavoid-\nable because psychological research generally collects data\nfrom university students (indeed, in their research, the sam-\nple size for university students was larger, k = 131). Moreover,\nthe authors noted that the interpretation of the result should\nbe taken with a grain of salt as the coefficient of determina-\ntion in the regression analysis did not reach significance (R2\nTo overcome these two limitations, we examined tempo-\nral changes in self-esteem among elementary school students\nand middle school students separately by analyzing time-\nseries archival data, which is methodologically different\nfrom the previous research (cross-temporal meta-analysis).\nTime-series data separate the population data into data about\ndifferent demographic groups, thus enabling a more detailed\nlook at temporal change in different segments of the popula-\ntion. There are various approaches to tracing the psychology\nand behavior of the past, each with its advantages and its\ndisadvantages (Kashima, 2014). By taking a different\napproach to tracing temporal changes in culture/society, we\ntried to compensate for the limitations of the previous\nOgihara et al. 3\ncross-temporal meta-analysis, as multifaceted approaches\nlead to a more valid and fruitful discussion. These comple-\nmentary methods will thus advance the scientific under-\nstanding of the phenomenon.\nTemporal Changes in Self-Esteem by\nGender in Japan\nJust as it is important to examine temporal changes in self-\nesteem according to developmental stage to identify bound-\nary conditions and gain a better understanding of the\nunderlying mechanisms or processes of cultural/social\nchanges, it is also important to look at these changes accord-\ning to gender. For example, if gender differences in self-\nesteem decreased because scores in males remained stable\nbut scores in females increased, then the differences in how\nthe social environment has changed for each gender (e.g.,\nrelative increases in social power and status for females)\nmight be associated with this change.\nOshio et al. (2014) did not focus on temporal changes in\nself-esteem by gender because the number of studies which\nhad reported average scores of RSES by gender was small,\nand analysis by gender made the sample sizes smaller.\nInstead, in a recent paper, they did examine whether gen-\nder differences in self-esteem decreased in Japan over the\nyears (Okada, Oshio, Mogaki, Wakita, & Namikawa,\nand 2013 that reported RSES scores according to gender\nand age demographics (from middle school students to the\nelderly). They found that the average score for males was\nhigher than that for females, and that gender differences in\nself-esteem in Japan had reduced slightly from the 1980s\nHowever, this study (Okada et al., 2015) has two limita-\ntions. First, although it indicated that overall gender differ-\nences decreased over time, it did not break down these\ntemporal changes in self-esteem for each gender.\nSpecifically, there are three plausible types of temporal\nchange that can account for the fact that male scores were\nhigher than female scores and the overall reduction in the\ndifference between genders: (a) the average male score has\ndecreased greatly whereas the average female score has\nincreased slightly, (b) the average male score has decreased\nwhereas the average female score has not changed, and (c)\nthe average scores both for males and females has decreased\nbut the magnitude of change was larger for males than for\nfemales. How we interpret the overall decrease in the differ-\nences between the genders will differ depending on which\ntype of change underlies it. If we find gender differences in\nthe type of change, we can identify some of the socio-cul-\ntural changes that affect self-esteem. Thus, to understand\nhow Japanese culture and people have changed, it is desir-\nable to look at temporal changes in self-esteem according to\ngender.\nA second limitation of the past study is that it did not\nbreak down temporal changes in gender difference in self-\nesteem by developmental stage (Okada et al., 2015). The pre-\nvious study calculated gender difference over time by\nanalyzing the RSES scores of all developmental stages (from\nmiddle school students to the elderly) together. Hence, the\nfinding that there has been temporal decline in gender differ-\nences may have resulted from decreases in the ratio of\nresearch on younger generations, which yield larger gender\ndifferences (Okada et al., 2015; Orth, Trzesniewski, &\nRobins, 2010). Because few (or no) studies have examined\nself-esteem at each stage of development particularly long\nago, the investigation of temporal changes in self-esteem by\ndevelopmental stage is difficult or impossible because of\ncross-temporal meta-analysis's dependence on past research.\nAs noted above, most research collected data from university\nstudents, so there is little research collecting data from\nyounger and older segments of the population (e.g., middle\nschool students and the elderly) than university students,\nespecially long ago. Thus, the investigation of temporal\nchanges in gender differences in self-esteem according to\ndevelopmental stage is difficult.\nAn analysis of time-series data can also overcome these\ntwo limitations because it basically focuses on specific popu-\nlations over time. Hence, in this study, we looked at temporal\nchanges in self-esteem among elementary and middle school\nstudents by gender and developmental stage.\nPresent Research\nIn addition to the limitations raised above, there is a further\nlimitation to previous research (Oshio et al., 2014) in terms\nof sampling. Previous research was based on scores from\npast studies, which makes it difficult to determine whether\nthe samples for each study were representative of the specific\npopulations for the years they represent. For example, an\naverage self-esteem score obtained from students at one mid-\ndle school in 1990 might have been used as the overall aver-\nage self-esteem score for middle school students in Japan in\n1990. Thus, it is possible that the temporal changes in self-\nesteem may actually be regional differences due to the use of\ndifferent regional populations for different studies' samples.\nTo insist that self-esteem has decreased among some popula-\ntions in Japanese society/culture, it is desirable to measure\nself-esteem using more representative samples. Thus, in the\ncurrent research, we investigated temporal changes in self-\nesteem by analyzing time-series data that are both more rep-\nresentative and come from a large sample.\nIn summary, previous research did not examine how tem-\nporal changes in self-esteem may vary according to develop-\nmental stage or gender. Moreover, it was based on data for\nwhich the representativeness of the samples is unclear.\nTherefore, in the present research, we examined temporal\nchanges in self-esteem by developmental stage (elementary\nschool and middle school students) and gender by analyzing\n4 SAGE Open\na large sample of time-series data that are more representa-\ntive of the population.\nMethod\nData\nWe analyzed representative and large-sample time-series\ndata collected by the Japanese government (Cabinet Office,\nveys was to capture values, lifestyle patterns, and beliefs\namong elementary and middle school students in Japan.\nRespondents\nThe respondents were students in elementary school (fourth,\nfifth, and sixth grade: aged 9 to 12 years) and middle school\n(seventh, eighth, and ninth grade: aged 12 to 15 years) in\nJapan. The government collected data from all over Japan\ntions with a response rate of 59.5%). Data were gathered\nfrom all 47 prefectures,2 from four sizes of municipality (big\ncity, mid-sized city, small city, and village), and from both\ngenders, making these surveys more representative. The\nsample sizes were indicated in Table 1. A total of 2,180 ele-\nmentary school students and 2,206 middle school students\nparticipated in the surveys.\nQuestion Items\nIn the surveys, participants reported to what extent the sen-\ntence \"I have self-confidence in myself 3\" applied to them-\nselves by using 4-point scale (1 = applies, 2 = somewhat\napplies, 3 = does not apply very much, 4 = does not apply).\nIn the 1999 survey, the anchors also included \"5 = do not\nexcluded participants who chose this anchor (the rate of such\nparticipants was low: 5.4% boys and 3.5% girls in elemen-\ntary school, 1.6% boys and 2.4% girls in middle school). For\nease of interpretation (i.e., higher scores indicate higher self-\nesteem), we reversed the scores and subtracted 1 (i.e., 0 =\ndoes not apply, 1 = does not apply very much, 2 = somewhat\napplies, 3 = applies).\nResults\nTemporal Changes in Self-Esteem by Gender and\nSchool Level\nThe average scores of self-esteem by gender and school level\nthree-way ANOVA with gender (boy or girl), school level\n(elementary school or middle school) and year (1999 or\nWe found significant main effects for gender, F(1,\np\np\np\nwhich was consistent with previous research (e.g., Feingold,\nSelf-esteem for students in elementary school (M =1.53,\nSD = .90) was higher than that for students in middle\nsistent with prior research showing that self-esteem\ndecreases in the teen years (e.g., Ogihara, 2016a; Robins,\nTrzesniewski, Tracy, Gosling, & Potter, 2002; Twenge &\n= .87; d = .28).4 No two-way interactions or three-way inter-\naction were significant (Fs < .91, ps > .34, \np\nless of gender and school level.\nThe reason why the 2006 self-esteem scores were lower\nthan 1999 scores might be due to the lack of an option for\n\"do not know\" in 2006 because people who wanted to choose\n\"do not know\" might have chosen more modest answers in\n2006, given the prevalence of modesty norm in Japan (e.g.,\nTafarodi, Shaughnessy, Yamaguchi, & Murakoshi, 2011). In\nthis case, such answers would be \"1: does not apply very\nmuch\" or \"2: somewhat applies,\" because \"0: does not apply\"\nand \"3: applies\" are more assertively clear (i.e., it would be\nunusual for someone wishing to answer \"do not know\" to\nchoose a clear answer) and previous research has shown that\nJapanese tend to avoid extreme answers in Likert-type scales\n(e.g., Chen, Lee, & Stevenson, 1995).
