Consequently, efforts to\npromote judicious antibiotic use have focused largely\non the long-term societal impact of antibiotic resistance\n[5\u00ad7]. The more immediate risks of antibiotic use in\nthe community--namely, adverse effects--are generally\nconsidered to be infrequent and mild. National cam-\npaigns and communication strategies aimed at reducing\ninappropriate antibiotic use have not traditionally in-\ncorporated messages that address these more direct and\nshort-term risks of antibiotic use [8, 9]. To better char-\nacterize the scope and burden of serious antibiotic-\nassociated adverse events, we used nationally represen-\ntative surveillance data from the United States to\ndescribe the frequency, rate, and nature of emergency depart-\nment (ED) visits for adverse events caused by systemic\nantibiotics.\nMETHODS\nNational estimates of the number of ED visits for drug-related\nadverse events were based on data from the National Electronic\nInjury Surveillance System\u00adCooperative Adverse Drug Event\nSurveillance (NEISS-CADES) project, a national stratified prob-\nability sample of 63 hospitals with a minimum of 6 beds and\na 24-h ED in the United States and its territories [10\u00ad12]. The\nNEISS-CADES project, which has been described in detail else-\nwhere, is a joint effort of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, and\nthe US Food and Drug Administration [11, 12]. In brief, trained\ncoders located at each participating hospital review clinical re-\ncords of every ED visit to identify physician-diagnosed drug-\nrelated adverse events, to report up to 2 medications implicated\nin each adverse event, and to record narrative descriptions of\nthe incident. We defined a drug-related adverse event as an\nDecember 2006 for a condition that the treating physician ex-\nplicitly attributed to the use of an antibiotic or for an antibiotic-\nspecific adverse effect. Topical antibiotics (i.e., dermatologic,\nophthalmic, otic, or vaginal formulations) were excluded. Ad-\nverse events were categorized as adverse effects (defined as un-\ndesirable pharmacologic or idiosyncratic effects, such as diar-\nrhea, dizziness, and headache, while a patient was receiving\ntherapy at recommended doses), allergic reactions (defined as\nimmunologically mediated effects, such as rash and anaphy-\nlaxis), unintentional overdoses (defined as toxic effects asso-\nciated with excess dose, such as effects attributable to uninten-\ntionally ingesting more than the prescribed dose), unintentional\nexposures (defined as unintentional ingestion of a medication,\nsuch as a child finding and ingesting an antibiotic), and other\neffects (defined as adverse events not attributable to allergic\nreactions, adverse effects, or unintentional overdoses, such as\ninjection site reactions and choking). On the basis of the di-\nagnoses and symptoms provided for each case and with use of\nmethods described elsewhere [12], the manifestations associ-\nated with each adverse event were categorized into various con-\nditions. For simplification of presentation, adverse event con-\nditions were assigned in mutually exclusive and hierarchical\nfashion.\nNational estimates of the number of outpatient prescription\nvisits (i.e., ambulatory care visits during which an antibiotic\nwas prescribed) were based on the National Ambulatory Med-\nical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Am-\nbulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) [13\u00ad16]. The\nNAMCS and NHAMCS are national sample surveys that pro-\nvide information about the provision and use of ambulatory\nmedical care services, including physician office, hospital out-\npatient department, and ED visits, in the United States and\nhave been used previously for estimates of the frequency of\nantibiotic prescribing [17\u00ad20]. We used public-use data from\ntify ambulatory care visits at which treatment with a systemic\nantibiotic was either started or continued by using a combi-\nnation of the 4-digit National Drug Code Directory class, brand\nname, generic name (for single-ingredient drug products), and\nindividual active ingredients (for multi-ingredient drug prod-\nucts). We estimated the number of outpatient prescription visits\nfrom NAMCS and NHAMCS for all systemic antibiotics that\nwere implicated in an ED visit for a drug-related adverse event\nEach NEISS-CADES, NAMCS, and NHAMCS visit was as-\nsigned a sample weight on the basis of the inverse probability\nof selection, adjusted for nonresponse, population changes, and\nin NAMCS and NHAMCS, weight smoothing (i.e., adjustments\nfor extremes in final weights of visits) [10, 21, 22]. We calculated\nnational estimates of the frequency of ED and prescription visits\nand corresponding 95% CIs using the Surveymeans procedure\nin SAS, version 9.1 (SAS), to account for the sample weights\nand complex sample designs. We divided frequency estimates\nobtain annual estimated frequencies. Estimates based on small\nnumbers of cases (!20 cases for NEISS-CADES and !30 cases\nfor NAMCS and NHAMCS) or with a coefficient of variation\n130% were considered to be statistically unstable and are not\npresented here.\nWe calculated rates by dividing the estimated number of ED\nvisits for drug-related adverse events (from NEISS-CADES) by\nthe estimated number of outpatient visits at which that anti-\nbiotic or antibiotic class was prescribed (from NAMCS and\nNHAMCS). The 95% CI for each rate incorporated variance\nestimates for both numerator and denominator components\nof the corresponding rate estimate [23]. Because these com-\nponents were calculated from separate surveillance systems,\nthey were treated as independent and as having zero covariance\nRESULTS\nble 1). Systemic antibiotics were implicated in 19.3% of all ED\nvisits for drug-related adverse events. Persons aged 15\u00ad44 years\naccounted for an estimated 41.2% of ED visits.

Individual drugs are shown in the table only if they were implicated in 0.5% of estimated emergency\ndepartment visits for antibiotic-associated adverse events.

We estimated that adverse events attributable\nfour-fifths of these events were allergic reactions. The overall\nrate of ED visits for antibiotic-associated adverse events (10.5\nED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits) was higher\nthan expected. The rate of ED visits for antibiotic-associated\nadverse events is one-half of the rate of ED visits for adverse\nevents attributable to \"high-risk\" medications, such as warfarin,\nscription visits); however, the rate of ED visits for antibiotic-\nassociated adverse events is 3 times higher than that for adverse\nevents attributable to some anticoagulant and antiplatelet\nagents (e.g., aspirin and clopidogrel), oral hypoglycemics (e.g.,\nmetformin), and some narrow therapeutic index agents (e.g.,\nphenytoin and lithium; rate for all of these drug classes com-\nPrevious studies using NAMCS, NHAMCS, and NEISS-\nCADES data have estimated that antibiotics cause 19% of\nambulatory care visits [25] and 18% of ED visits [12] for drug-\nrelated adverse events. However, these studies did not provide\ndetailed comparisons among antibiotic classes and drugs, ac-\ncount for antibiotic prescribing frequency, or describe the na-\nture of antibiotic-associated adverse events. More-detailed stud-\nies of antibiotic-associated adverse events have been largely\nlimited to studies involving hospitalized patients, spontaneous\nreports of adverse drug reactions attributable to a single an-\ntibiotic or antibiotic class, or studies of specific adverse events\nWe found that nearly 80% of ED visits for antibiotic-asso-\nciated adverse events among patients receiving ambulatory care\nwere the result of allergic reactions. This finding is in contrast\nto those for other medication classes that cause many ED visits\nfor drug-related adverse events (e.g., anticoagulants, antidi-\nabetics, and anticonvulsants), which primarily result from med-\nication errors and overdoses [12, 24]. Although medication\nerrors and overdoses can be prevented by improving admin-\nistration and monitoring, most allergic reactions can only be\nprevented by avoiding exposure to a drug. We could not assess\nthe appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing from these data;\nhowever, more than one-half of the estimated 100 million an-\ntibiotic prescriptions written in the community each year for\nrespiratory tract infections may be unnecessary [17, 18, 31].\nAlthough the risk of an ED visit for an antibiotic-associated\nadverse event is small for an individual patient, when antibiotics\nare commonly prescribed for indications for which they have\nno benefit, the burden of preventable adverse events in the\npopulation is great. Thus, efforts to mitigate the burden of\nuntoward effects of antibiotics should focus on minimizing\nexcessive use of antibiotics, because decreasing inappropriate\nantibiotic use by even a small percentage could substantially\nreduce the number of patients who experience antibiotic-as-\nsociated adverse events.\nPrevious studies have found that, when both infectious dis-\neases specialists and general physicians prescribe broad-spec-\ntrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, they often cite per-\nceived advantages of these agents in terms of their safety profiles\nTable 3.

Estimates of the number of adverse events are based on the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System\u00adCooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project (2004\u00ad2006). Estimates\nof the number of outpatient prescription visits (OPV) are based on the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2004\u00ad2005). Adverse events\nwere categorized into 1 condition. Adverse event conditions are mutually exclusive and were assigned hierarchically (left to right). For example, a case in which a patient experienced both a severe\nallergic reaction and gastrointestinal effects would be categorized as a moderate-to-severe allergic reaction.\na Only cases in which drugs from a single systemic antibiotic class were implicated in the adverse event are included (5802 cases). Estimates with coefficient of variation 130% or based on !20\ncases were not calculated.\nb Includes anaphylaxis, angioedema, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, facial-pharyngeal-genital edema, hypersensitivity vasculitis, red man syndrome, respiratory distress or arrest, serum\nsickness, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\nc Includes dermatitis, drug eruption, erythema, flushing, localized edema, pruritus, rash, rash morbilliform, and urticaria.\nd Includes metronidazole, nitrofurans, vancomycin, linezolid, unspecified, and other antibiotic classes.\n[32, 33]. Although the rate of ED visits for adverse events\nattributable to fluoroquinolones was lower than the rates of\nED visits for adverse events attributable to sulfonamides and\nclindamycin, it was higher than the rates of ED visits for adverse\nevents attributable to cephalosporins, macrolides, and tetra-\ncyclines. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with the\nsecond highest rates of neurologic or psychiatric effects and\nhospitalization. The significantly higher rate of adverse events\nattributable to moxifloxacin, compared with fluoroquinolones,\nis similar to findings from clinical trials and studies based on\nspontaneous reporting [28, 34] and is contrary to the percep-\ntion that \"newer\" antibiotics have superior adverse effect pro-\nAdverse event data cannot be used in isolation to dictate the\ndecision as to whether to prescribe antibiotics or to determine\noptimal antibiotic selection for individual patients. However,\nthese national surveillance data can be used by clinicians to\nhelp assess the validity of their perceptions of the safety profile\nof various antibiotics and antibiotic classes. These population-\nbased findings are also important, because adverse event data\nfrom spontaneous reports cannot provide population rates, and\nsafety data from clinical trials largely reflect adverse events\namong a small number of highly selected persons relative to\nthose eventually exposed to antibiotics in the community [35].\nThe infectious diseases and public health communities have\nlong argued for judicious antibiotic use by physicians because\nof the lack of effectiveness for treating certain conditions (e.g.,\nupper respiratory tract infection caused by a virus) and the\nthreat of antibiotic resistance [5\u00ad9]. Nevertheless, unnecessary\nprescribing of antibiotics in the community remains common\npractices, physicians reported difficulty with communicating\ninformation on antibiotic effectiveness and resistance and ex-\npressed concerns about the time required for such explanations\n[39, 40]. Physicians often perceived antibiotic resistance as a\nsocietal problem, identified the interests of their individual pa-\ntients as being more important, and prescribed antibiotics to\npatients who they believed expected to receive antibiotics [32,\n33, 39\u00ad41]. National data quantifying the risks of clinically\nrelevant antibiotic-associated adverse events (i.e., those result-\ning in ED visits) can support a simpler argument for using\nantibiotics judiciously and one that directly addresses the in-\ndividual patient and the physician's primary responsibility, pri-\nmum non nocere, first do no harm.\nNational antibiotic-associated adverse event data can also be\nused by campaigns targeted at changing patient expectations\nof antibiotic therapy. In studies that assessed patients' percep-\ntions of the harmful consequences of antibiotic use, the as-\nsociation between antibiotics and adverse effects (e.g., rash)\nwas almost always mentioned, but the association between an-\ntibiotics and resistance was rarely mentioned [39]. Similar re-\nsearch has demonstrated that patients frequently do not un-\nderstand that antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections\n[42]. Thus, communicating the risk of serious antibiotic-\nassociated adverse events to patients can add to their existing\nperceptions of risks of antibiotic therapy and may reduce the\namount of requests for antibiotic therapy more than by trying\nto convey information on antibiotic effectiveness or resistance\nvisits for antibiotic-associated adverse events (37,000 visits)\nwere by children aged !15 years and the highest rate of ED\nvisits was among infants, this message could be targeted at\nparents of pediatric patients, in particular.\nAntibiotic use guidelines are beginning to recognize that the\nrisk of adverse effects in individual patients can outweigh the\nbenefits of antibiotics for certain prophylactic indications. Re-\ncently, infective endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines were re-\nvised, at least in part, on the basis of the assessment that the\nrisk of antibiotic-associated adverse events exceeds the benefits\nof prophylactic use for many patients [43, 44]. Future antibiotic\nuse guidelines should incorporate the best available evidence\non risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events in individual\npatients in ways that can be integrated in clinical practice [32,\nThis investigation focused on drug-related adverse events\ndiagnosed in EDs, and thus, the numbers and rates do not\nreflect all antibiotic-associated adverse events. Although our\ndata describe clinically relevant drug-related adverse events that\nwarranted medical attention and contributed to health care\nresource use, we could not account for unreported events and\nevents identified in other health care settings, such as physi-\ncians' offices. Because case identification in the NEISS-CADES\nproject relies on the presence of a physician-diagnosed drug-\nrelated adverse event in the ED, rare and less well-recognized\nevents and events with subacute onset are less likely to be\ncaptured. We limited our analysis of drug-related adverse event\nconditions and outcomes (table 3) to cases in which only drugs\nfrom a single antibiotic class were implicated in the adverse\nevent, to describe only the events that were attributed to an-\ntibiotics and not to other types of drugs. In doing so, we may\nhave neglected to describe certain adverse events, such as those\nresulting from drug-drug interactions (e.g., hemorrhage in a\npatient receiving warfarin and a fluoroquinolone) [45]. Phy-\nsicians may also be more likely to recognize certain adverse\nevent conditions associated with a particular antibiotic class\nthan those associated with other classes (e.g., they are more\nlikely to identify allergic reactions associated with b-lactam an-\ntibiotics than allergic reactions associated with fluoroquino-\nlones), thus influencing the spectrum of adverse events de-\nscribed in association with each antibiotic class. Similar to most\nprevious studies on antibiotic prescribing [17\u00ad20], we used\nNAMCS and NHAMCS for estimates of the frequency of out-\npatient antibiotic prescribing. Our estimates of the frequency\nof outpatient antibiotic prescribing are similar to those pre-\nviously reported using NAMCS and NHAMCS [1, 20]. How-\never, different prescription databases may have yielded different\nestimates of the frequency of outpatient antibiotic prescribing\n[46], and the frequency of outpatient antibiotic prescribing,\nwhen based on NAMCS and NHAMCS, is likely to be under-\nestimated, because these databases exclude telephone and e-\nmail contacts, antibiotics prescribed in nursing homes or am-\nbulatory surgery centers, and antibiotic courses initiated during\nhospitalization or provided at hospital discharge.\nAntibiotic-associated adverse events lead to many ED visits,\nand allergic reactions are the most common events. Commu-\nnicating the risks of antibiotic-associated adverse events can\nbecome an important strategy in efforts to promote judicious\nantibiotic use. Avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use reduces not\nonly the public health threat of antibiotic resistance but also\nthe risk of drug-related adverse events in individual patients.\n"
