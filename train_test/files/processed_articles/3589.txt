    "abstract": "Abstract\nHIV/AIDS scourge remains high in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa such as Nigeria, which is home to about 3.3 million\nHIV positive individuals and represents the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS care, treatment and demand worldwide after\nSouth Africa. Anti-retroviral treatment options though a welcome development, has increased the number of people living\nwith this chronic illness, and most of them depend on family members for physical and emotional support. Traditional gender\nnorms in Nigeria ensure that legitimately, women and girls are the first options for caregiving roles. This mandatory role\nhas in turn imposed psychosocial disruption in the lives of female family members in Calabar, Nigeria. This descriptive study\nutilized convenient sampling technique, Zarit Burden Interview scale and semistructured questionnaires for data collection\n(260 respondents), and data analyses were achieved using SPSS16.0. The study showed that a significant (p < .05) proportion\nof women (91%) were involved in providing care, including children from 10 years and above. Caregivers had minimal social\nsupport which increased the burden they experienced. The need for policy that recognizes and supports female caregivers\n(\"silent cornerstone\") to reduce burden and ensure high quality care of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Nigeria is\nadvocated.\n",

With sub-Saharan Africa accounting\nfor 69% of people living with HIV, coupled with advance-\nment in medical treatment and improvement in life expec-\ntancy, many more persons will assume caregiving role of\npeople living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA; Singh, Chaudoir,\nshown that most HIV infected individuals return to their\nhomes for care and psychological support (Bachmanna &\nBooysenb, 2006; Global Coalition on Women and AIDS,\nWilliams (1998) in our society, family caregivers often go\nunnoticed except by those who depend on their care.\nSimilarly, Abasiubong, Bassey, Ogunsemi, and Udobang\n(2011) asserted that while resolute efforts are made to\nimprove the quality of life of PLWHA in many countries,\nlittle or no "
