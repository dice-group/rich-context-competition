The numerical equilibrium is maintained because each\noffspring has one mother and one father, and on average males and females in a population\nwill have equivalent reproductive success. If there is a surplus of one sex, the production of\nthe rarer sex will be advantageous because of their higher average reproductive success,\nfacilitating a stable equilibrium.\nMale scarcity and marital likelihood\nThe sex ratio equilibrium occurs on an evolutionary time scale, as researchers since\nDarwin (1871) have documented imbalanced sex ratios in specific human populations.\nWhen these imbalances occur, the rare sex is more valuable in the marriage market (Fisher,\n1958). The Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) describes the average ratio of sexually active\nmales to sexually receptive females in a population (Emlen and Oring, 1977). Across\nspecies, polygyny is expected when the OSR is skewed toward males and polyandry is\nexpected when the OSR is skewed toward females (Emlen and Oring, 1977).\nWhen the sex ratio is imbalanced within a human population, the less populous sex\nmay have increased leverage in inter-sexual relationships. Because males and females have\nsomewhat divergent reproductive strategies, there will be contrasting consequences for\nmale biased OSRs and female biased OSRs. Women are generally more selective than men\nin mate choice because of their greater paternal investment and significantly lower\nreproductive ceiling (Trivers, 1972). The reverse is true for males, who have greater returns\non reproductive success from having a greater number of mating partners (Bateman, 1948).\nThe attributes of what each sex offers as enticements and requires of partners for\nrelationships will shift based on the leverage conferred by numerical scarcity.\nMen compete for partners through signals of potential commitment to long-term\nrelationships and resource provisioning. Across a wide variety of societies, women favor\nmen with high social and economic status (Hopcroft, 2006). Children who grow up without\na father present suffer higher mortality rates (Hill and Hurtado, 1996), and paternal\ninvestment in offspring may enhance offspring reproductive success (Geary, 2005). When\nthe OSR is male biased, available men outnumber available women and the greater degree\nof female choice will raise the quality of male attributes necessary for securing female\npartners. Men with lower socio-economic status may have an especially difficult time\ngetting married (Pollet and Nettle, 2007), as male socio-economic status is evaluated for\nIn the early European Middle Ages, the population declined and moved from cities\nto rural areas to avoid invading tribes. Sons were highly valued for agricultural labor, and\npreferential treatment resulted in a surplus of males. Monogamy and (female) virginity at\nmarriage were favored, as men promoted social norms that favored stability in existing\nrelationships, preventing women from using their scarcity to secure multiple investing\npartners. Men who were not able to obtain a partner would do good deeds for the approval\nof an already married woman, very rarely consummating the relationship (Guttentag and\nWhen men are scarce in a female biased population, there is less incentive for\ncompetition among men for relationship commitment and paternal investment because\nmale scarcity enhances their short term mating success (Pederson, 1991). Females have less\nselective power and may exhibit lower thresholds for male commitment in order to have\nsexual relations. Women compete for partners through signals of fecundity and sexual\navailability (Cunningham, 1986; Tesser and Martin, 1996). In female biased populations,\nfemale mating effort and sexual receptivity increase, as can be seen in trends for skirt\nlength (Barber, 1999) and teenage pregnancies (Barber, 2000). Sociologists have noted that\nwomen have greater difficulties in obtaining their first marriage when there is a relative\nshortage of men (Lichter, Kephart, McLaughlin, and Landry, 1992).\nPederson (1991) described the how the demographic bulge of the \"baby boom\"\ngeneration in the United States combined with sex differences in average marital age to\nMale scarcity and marital likelihood\nresult in an effectively female biased OSR. This resulted in increasing divorce rates and\nother socio-political trends that lasted until the 1980s, when the OSR reversed (Pederson,\n1991). Across history, female biased OSRs tend to destabilize marriages and lead to higher\ndivorce rates, more out-of-wedlock births and single mother households, and lower paternal\nassociated with the reverse pattern.\nIn the late European Middle Ages the loss of men to Crusades, monasteries, and the\nplagues gradually contributed to create a female biased OSR. Also, generally increasing\npopulation sizes re-established urban areas that promoted female survival because of the\nfreedom from the hard physical labor of agriculture. Men could more easily attain serial or\neven simultaneous polygyny, and marriage payments shifted from bride prices to dowries,\nreflecting market conditions. Sexually libertarian male bachelors proliferated, and many\nwomen remained unmarried, not only due to the scarcity of men, but also because the men\navailable were reluctant to marry (Guttentag and Secord, 1983).\nMale life history in modern societies\nWe propose that Life History Theory can be used to clarify the relationship between\nthe OSR and male marital patterns in technologically advanced cultures. There are multiple\nindicators that male resource allocation shifts from mating effort to paternal effort across\nadulthood in such societies. These include declines in fertility levels (Tuljapurkar, Puleston,\nand Gurven, 2007), mortality rates from risky behaviors (Kruger and Nesse, 2006), and\nandrogen levels (Baker and Hudson, 1983), beginning in the third decade of life. The shift\nin male life history effort may occur as a response to diminishing returns from mating\neffort.\nIn early adulthood, men in modern female biased populations may have less of an\nincentive to shift effort towards committed relationships due to ample mating opportunities\n(Gangestad and Simpson, 2000). Male reproductive success will benefit from multiple\npartnerships because even a brief sexual affair may increase the number of a man's\ndescendents. However, the returns from a high mating effort strategy may decline with age.\nWhen males do not commit to long-term investment, the reproductive benefits of\nthese relationships for women may be high-quality genes promoting health, and\nattractiveness to the opposite sex. For short-term relationships, women tend to prefer males\nwith high phenotypic quality, signaling high genetic quality (Kruger, Fisher, and Jobling,\n2003; Kruger, 2006). These characteristics are passed on to offspring, ultimately benefitting\nreproductive success (Fisher, 1930). Indicators of genetic quality may be especially\nimportant when the likelihood of paternal investment is relatively low (Gangestad and\nMales' abilities to signal genetic quality through phenotypic quality may decline as\nmen age, because of the observable physiological correlates of senescence. Younger men\nwere usually the fathers of offspring from extra-pair sexual affairs among Ache foragers,\nwhereas older men tended to produce most of their offspring within long-term relationships\n(Hill and Hurtado, 1996). As males' enhanced abilities to acquire short-term relationships\nin a female biased population decline with age, they may still benefit from their market\nscarcity by a relatively greater ability to form long-term committed partnerships compared\nto men in male biased populations.\nMale scarcity and marital likelihood\nPredictions\nWe predict that the OSR and the proportion of males who are married will be\ndirectly related in young adulthood and inversely related in later adulthood. This pattern\nwould indicate that males leverage a low sex ratio to their advantage for increase mating\nopportunities when young and for securing committed relationships when older. The\nreversal is expected to occur in the third decade of life, consistent with indicators of male\nlife history shifts from mating effort to parental effort in modern societies. Cities in the\nUnited States exhibit variation in the OSR, mostly due to economic migration (Gwin,\n2007). In the Northeastern United States, women have moved from predominantly rural\nareas to large cities for careers in office labor and men have moved to cities in the Western\nUnited States for technology oriented careers (Gwin, 2007). This sex ratio variation\nprovides an opportunity to test our hypothesis across populations in one technologically\nadvanced nation. We previously noted this pattern in the 10 largest cities in the USA\n(Kruger and Schlemmer, 2009). However, these results were based on ZIP Codes as the\nunit of analysis, and it is highly unlikely that ZIP Code boundaries define separate breeding\npopulations. We attempt to replicate these results here with a broader sample and a more\nappropriate unit of analysis, the Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nMethod\nThe Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) in humans is operationally defined as the ratio of\nunmarried men to unmarried women, multiplied by 100. Thus, an OSR of 100 indicates a\nbalance between available men and available women, a male biased OSR of 110 indicates\n11 men available for every 10 women available. We calculated the OSR and the proportion\nof men who were married for the 50 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the\nUnited States with 2000 U.S Census data (2001). We calculated these figures separately for\neach Census age group from the age of 18 years and graphed their correlation within each\nage group. We also calculated the OSRs for unmarried individuals aged 18 to 64 as a whole\nin each MSA to examine the extent of regional variation. We examined the relationship\nbetween the OSR for ages 18 to 64 with U.S Census data for median family, household,\nmale, and female incomes to identify possible economic confounds.\nResults\nThe OSR for individuals ages 18 to 64 ranged from 88 in Birmingham, AL and\nMemphis, TN, to 116 in Las Vegas, NV (M = 99, SD = 7). The OSR had a significant\ndirect (positive) relationship to the proportion of males who were married in the 20-24 and\n25-29 year age groups, but a significant inverse (negative) relationship to the proportion of\nFigure 1). The correlation for the 30-34 year age group was negative but not statistically\nsignificant and appeared to exemplify a continuous transition. The non-significant\ncorrelations for the 75-84 and 85+ year age groups appeared to exemplify an attenuation of\nthe inverse relationship. The strength of the relationships between the OSR and proportion\nof males married were quite substantial in each direction, r2 = .36 and r2 = .49, respectively\nin the 20-24 and 55-59 year age groups. There were no significant relationships between\nMale scarcity and marital likelihood\nthe OSR for ages 18 to 64 and median family, household, male, and female incomes; r =\nFigure 1.

Most prominently\nseen in the third decade of life, there is an increasing tendency for men to use their market\nscarcity for establishing marital relationships. Young men in female biased populations\nhave lower marital likelihood than their peers in male biased populations, whereas older\nmen in female biased populations are more likely to be married than their counterparts in\nmale biased populations. These findings advance the understanding of the relationship\nbetween the OSR and male marital patterns, as previous analyses did not take age into\naccount.\nWe believe that the male shift towards relationship commitment in female biased\npopulations is a consequence of diminishing returns with age from mating effort for short-\nMale scarcity and marital likelihood\nterm relationships without marital commitment. Our results suggest that men in modern\nfemale biased populations undergo a more dramatic life history shift than men in male\nbiased populations, with a greater emphasis on mating effort for short-term relations in\nyoung adulthood. The attenuation of the relationship between the sex ratio and marital\nlikelihood in very late adulthood is likely related to the higher mortality rate for men than\nwomen, and the sex differences in mortality rates is especially high among those who are\nThe data in this study demonstrate population demographic patterns. Further\nresearch may uncover the beliefs and experiences that may relate to this shift in strategies.\nLongitudinal studies of men living in male and female biased cities could assess whether\nthe degree of psychological, behavioral, and physiological changes correspond with the\nmagnitude of the demographic shift in marital likelihood.\nThe data available may give a simplified account of the relationship patterns in the\npopulations of interest. For example, men in female biased populations may have a greater\nability to obtain simultaneous polygyny, whether they are married or not. Some men may\npractice serial polygyny, and their ability to secure subsequent partners may be enhanced\nby their market advantage in a female biased population. The census data indicates an\nindividual's legal relationship status, not the actual number of relationship partners or\nmarital order.\nThe patterns described here are representative of a modern society with\ninstitutionalized (serial) monogamy. In Western industrial cultures social norms promote\nostensible monogamy. In other cultures, increased levels of stable simultaneous polygyny\nmay be a legitimate outcome of female biased populations. The vast majority of cultures\n(84%) allow for simultaneous polygyny (Ember, Ember, and Low, 2007), a likely feature\nof many human ancestral environments. The data also do not include sexual orientation,\nand although this may potentially confound other analyses, it would not explain the reversal\nin the direction of the effect.\nAs discussed previously, women evaluate prospective partners on socio-economic\nstatus and show a preference for men of moderately older age (Buss, 1989), presumably\nbecause of the time needed to accrue resources and social status. Male competition for\npartners is more intense and socio-economic status may be more important in male biased\npopulations (Pollet and Nettle, 2007). Given these patterns, one may wonder about the\nhigher marital rates for young men in male biased cities, how could they be so successful in\nobtaining partners so early in adulthood? Although males may peak in social status and\nresource potential in mid to late adulthood, young women in modern populations do not\nrestrict their relationships with such men. Women are more likely evaluating potential\npartners on the potential for resource provisioning through the period of potential offspring\ndependency, which can last around two decades in modern human populations. At\nmarriage, men make an explicit commitment to provide such resources gradually as they\nare needed, rather than instantaneously transferring accumulated resources to female\npartners in one lump sum. As females usually have greater reproductive incentives for\nrelationship commitments, men offering such commitments and demonstrating resource\npotential through educational and career trajectories will likely find interested partners.\nGiven that men in female biased populations eventually shift towards commitment\nstrategies and the relationship between the OSR and the proportion of males married is\nstrongest in the 55-59 age group, one may wonder about the marital expectancies for non-\nMale scarcity and marital likelihood\nmarried middle aged women in female biased populations. Unfortunately for these women,\nthe higher marital rates for older men are likely to benefit women who are substantially\nyounger than their husbands, because of male preferences for partner fecundity\n(Cunningham, 1986; Tesser and Martin, 1996).We expect to see larger mean sex difference\nin age at marriage in female biased modern populations than in male biased modern\npopulations.\nOverall, this study demonstrates the power of evolutionary life history theory for\nunderstanding human behavioral patterns. The pattern of behaviors exemplified here would\nbe difficult to explain with any non-evolutionary theory of relationship behavior.\nEvolutionary theory is the most powerful framework in the life sciences and has\nconsiderably advanced our understanding of human psychology. As this study indicates,\nthe evolutionary framework also holds considerable promise for other social sciences such\nas demography.\nReferences\nBaker, H.W.G., and Hudson, B. (1983).
