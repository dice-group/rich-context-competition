As a result, the femur neck and trochanter\nT-scores were lowered, and osteoporosis prevalence was increased. Use of a recalculated young-normal SD for\nthe GE Lunar\u00adadjusted NHANES III database improved diagnostic agreement and is recommended.\nIntroduction: Use of manufacturer-specific normative databases for T-score derivation leads to discordance in\nT-score values and differences in diagnostic classification. To address this issue, the International Committee\nfor Standards in Bone Measurement (ICSBM) recommended the NHANES III database for femur T-score\nderivation. Acquired on Hologic (Hol) instruments, this database requires conversion equations for applica-\ntion to other DXA systems. NHANES III total femur (TF) conversions for GE Lunar (GE) have previously\nbeen available, and femoral neck (FN) and trochanter (TR) equations were reported recently. Per the ICSBM\nrecommendation, GE Lunar incorporated these values into their female database. This should produce\nT-score and diagnostic agreement between Hol and GE instruments; however, this has not been evaluated.\nMaterials and Methods: We compared GE femur scans in 115 postmenopausal women using software before\nand after the NHANES III software update. Subsequently, T-scores derived from femur scans obtained on GE\nand Hol densitometers were compared in a different group of 89 postmenopausal women.\nResults: The NHANES III software update had no effect on measured BMD (g/cm2) at any femur region.\nHowever, because of changes in values used for T-score calculation (increase in the mean young-normal BMD\nat the FN and TR and a reduction in SD at the TR), the T-scores were lower (mean, 0.48 and 0.68, respec-\ntively) at the FN and TR using post-NHANES III software. Consequently, this update increased femur\nosteoporosis prevalence in these 115 women from 7.8% to 18.3%. Comparison of GE with Hol total proximal\nfemur T-scores revealed a minimal difference (<0.1) and equal diagnoses of osteoporosis. FN and TR differ-\nences were larger, with mean GE T-scores lower than Hol (p < 0.001) by 0.17 and 0.50, respectively, thereby\nintroducing osteoporosis diagnostic disagreement (13 [GE] versus 9 [Hol]). Our evaluation suggested that this\ndisparity resulted from direct application of published NHANES III SDs at the FN and TR. As such, we\napplied the conversion formulae to the NHANES III published Hologic data and found the FN and TR SDs\nwere greater than assumed by GE. Using our recalculated SD to derive T-scores reduced the mean GE/Hol\nT-score difference to 0.03 at the FN and 0.32 at the TR and resolved osteoporosis diagnostic disagreement.\nConclusion: The GE NHANES III software update leads to lower FN and TR T-scores than obtained with\nHol or prior GE software. Recalculation of the young-normal SD reduces this difference and is recommended.\nClinicians are advised to avoid using the TR for diagnosis or, at a minimum, use caution when making\ntreatment decisions based solely on T-score at this site.\n",

As such,\nthe population used to define the young-adult mean BMD\nand the variability within this group substantially impacts\nosteoporosis prevalence using this T-score\u00adbased ap-\nproach.(2\u00ad6) Because manufacturer-developed proprietary\ndatabases use different populations, the young-adult mean\nBMD and/or SD may differ.(2) Thus, the diagnostic classi-\nfication of an individual as normal, osteopenic, or osteopo-\nrotic may vary depending on the densitometer used.(3)\nIdeally, all bone mass measurement devices would use\nthe same population to define the young-normal mean\nBMD and SD, a process that does lead to derivation of\nsimilar T-scores with instruments of different manufactur-\ners.(4) Although use of a single large sample population to\ndevelop a uniform normative database for all densitometers\nhas been suggested,(5,6) this process has not been imple-\nmented. To improve harmonization of diagnostic classifica-\ntion, the International Committee for Standards in Bone\nMeasurement (ICSBM) agreed on a universal reference da-\ntabase for the femur based on NHANES III,(7) the only\nlarge standardized reference database ever published.(1,8)\nBecause the NHANES III data were acquired using Ho-\nlogic densitometers, the ICSBM published formulae to con-\nvert measured BMD into standardized BMD at the total\nfemur, thereby allowing use of the NHANES III database\nby other densitometer manufacturers.(7,9\u00ad11) This method-\nology allowed for calculation of total proximal femur T-\nscores from a common young-adult database, thereby re-\nmoving the T-score discrepancy between Hologic and GE\nLunar that had previously existed at this skeletal site.(3)\nRecently, Lu et. al.(12) published standardization equations\nallowing the NHANES III database to be used at the femur\nneck and trochanteric subregions. Subsequently, GE Lunar\nused these conversion equations to incorporate NHANES\nIII data at the femur neck and trochanter into their soft-\nware, beginning with version 7.0 in the fall of 2002. Because\nthe earlier application of NHANES data did not materially\nchange the total femur T-score from that derived using the\nGE Lunar normative database, it might be anticipated that\nthis software update would not alter femur neck or trochan-\nter T-scores. However, the impact of the software upgrade\non T-scores as determined using GE Lunar densitometers\nhas not been reported.\nWe initially noted that this software upgrade seemed to\nlower femur neck and trochanter T-scores. If lower T-\nscores at the same BMD resulted from this software update,\nthe number of women diagnosed as \"low\" using the WHO\ncriteria would be increased. To investigate this possibility,\nwe evaluated the effect of this update on osteoporosis\nprevalence in a group of postmenopausal women measured\nusing a GE Lunar densitometer. Furthermore, it would be\nexpected that use of a common normative database, in this\ncase NHANES III, would produce T-score and diagnostic\nagreement between densitometer manufacturers. To inves-\ntigate this, we subsequently evaluated whether the software\nupgrade produced diagnostic agreement between GE Lu-\nnar and Hologic densitometers in a second group of post-\nmenopausal women.\nTerminology and databases used\nA summary of software versions and normative data-\nbases used in this study with the female young-normal\nmean BMD and SD are presented in Table 1. Before the\nGE Lunar software update (instituted at software version\nonly for total femur T-score calculation. The total femur\nvalues were previously derived by converting the published\nHologic value to sBMD and converting this to a Lunar-\nequivalent BMD by rearranging the sBMD equation. Sub-\nsequently, GE Lunar incorporated NHANES III values by\napplying conversion equations to the published young-\nnormal mean BMD as measured by Hologic instruments\nwhile employing the published SD of BMD, as measured by\nHologic instruments, to derive T-scores at all hip regions.\nWe recalculated the young-normal mean BMD and SD\nfor GE Lunar using published young-normal mean BMD\nand SD values at the hip from the 409 non-Hispanic white\nfemales 20\u00ad29 years of age in the NHANES III cohort.(1)\nEquations for converting Hologic BMD values to Lunar-\nequivalent BMD values were obtained from an author of\nthe publication from Lu et al.

The SD was also converted for the \"recalculated\" database.\nues and SDs were determined using standard formulas for\nlinear transformations. In particular, if we apply the linear\ntransformation y = a + b \u00d7 x to data with mean (x) and SD\nSD(x), the transformed data have mean (y) = a + b \u00d7 \u00b5(x)\nand SD SD(y) = b \u00d7 SD(x). The T-scores derived using this\napproach are referred to as \"recalculated\" results.\nSubjects\nEffect of GE Lunar NHANES III software update: A to-\ntal of 115 postmenopausal women was randomly selected\nfrom a population that responded to newspaper advertising\nto obtain BMD measurement at the University of Wiscon-\nsin Osteoporosis Clinical Center and Research Program\n(Madison, WI). Each woman received a single lumbar spine\nand left hip measurement using standard scan protocols on\na GE Lunar Prodigy. All of these women were white, with\nthe University of Wisconsin IRB, acquisition of informed\nconsent was waived because all subject identifiers were re-\nmoved from these scans.\nGE Lunar/Hologic comparison: As part of a different\nstudy to compare GE Lunar Prodigy and Hologic Delphi\ndensitometers, 90 women (30 each from three osteoporosis\ncenters) were recruited. Their mean age was 61.6 \u00b1 1.0 (SE)\nyears. The three clinical sites were the Department of Ra-\ndiology, University of California at San Francisco, CA; the\nNew Mexico Clinical Research and Osteoporosis Center,\nAlbuquerque, NM; and the Colorado Center for Bone Re-\nsearch, Lakewood, CO. Each woman received a total of\nfour hip scans, two each using a GE Lunar Prodigy and\nHologic Delphi. After their initial scan, all patients stood up\nand were subsequently repositioned, and these scans were\nrepeated in their entirety. IRB approval was obtained for\nthis study, and all participants provided written informed\nconsent.\nScan analysis\nAll scans were performed by International Society for\nClinical Densitometry\u00adcertified technologists who used\nmanufacturer-recommended acquisition and analysis tech-\nniques.\nGE Lunar NHANES III software update: Each scan was\ninitially auto-analyzed using either software version 6.60 or\n6.70 to obtain the pre-NHANES III software update T-\nscores. No operator adjustment to region of interest place-\nment or point typing was performed. Subsequently, all hip\nscan files were auto-reanalyzed using software version 7.53\nto obtain post-NHANES III software update T-scores.\nGE Lunar/Hologic comparison: Hologic Delphi software\nand 7.51 using the NHANES III update were used for all\ninitial analyses. Subsequently, all GE Lunar scans were re-\nanalyzed with software before the NHANES III update.\nFor this repeat analysis, auto-reanalysis was performed on\nall femur scans, and no operator adjustment to region of\ninterest placement or point typing was performed. The av-\nerage left femur T-score of the two scans performed on\neach densitometer was used for comparison. One patient\nwas excluded because her anatomy and positioning pre-\ncluded appropriate femur region of interest placement.\nStatistical analyses\nBland Altman analyses (Analyze-it, Leeds, UK) and\npaired t-tests (Statview Abacus, Cary, NC, USA) were use\nto compare BMD and T-scores obtained with the GE Lu-\nnar \"pre\" and \"post\" NHANES III software update. These\nanalyzes were also performed on the GE Lunar/Hologic\ncomparison data. Regression analysis was used to compare\nGE and Hologic T-scores. The effects of reference database\non WHO diagnostic categorization were evaluated using\nMcNemar's test, a test for paired proportions that analyzes\nthe number of disagreements (Analyze-it). Paired t-tests\nwere used to compare BMD and T-scores for patients mea-\nsured on both GE Lunar and Hologic DXA systems, and p\n< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nImpact of database on average young-normal BMD\nand SD\nAs noted in Table 1, the NHANES III software update\nresulted in an increase in young-normal mean BMD of\n5.9% at the femur neck and 7.7% at the trochanter com-\npared with the GE Lunar normative database. Further-\nmore, the SD at the trochanter was decreased by 10%.\nEither of these changes (i.e., an increase in young-normal\nmean BMD or a reduction in SD) will increase the number\nof women diagnosed as low when using the WHO diagnos-\ntic criteria. Our recalculated NHANES III values also led\nto an increase in young-normal mean BMD at the femur\nneck and trochanter; however, the SD also increased at\nthese sites compared with that used with the post-\nNHANES software.\nGE Lunar NHANES III software update\nProximal femur BMD: The GE Lunar NHANES III soft-\nware update did not alter measured BMD at the total proxi-\nmal femur, femur neck, or trochanter (data not shown),\nwith the exception of three individuals. In 3 of the 115\nwomen, total proximal femur BMD differed by 0.001 g/cm2;\nin 1 of these 3 women, the trochanter BMD also differed by\n0.001 g/cm2. Measured BMD at all three femoral subre-\ngions was identical for the remaining subjects.\nProximal femur T-score and osteoporosis prevalence-\ncomparisons: T-scores of the total proximal femur, al-\nthough statistically different (p < 0.0001), were clinically\nunchanged, differing by only 0.02, when derived using soft-\nware before (\"pre\") and after (\"post\") the NHANES III\nsoftware update (Fig. 1A). However, at the femur neck\n(Fig. 1B) and trochanter (Fig. 1C), all subjects had a lower\nT-score using the post-NHANES III update software. The\nmean T-score decrease resulting from use of the updated\nchanter. The T-scores were lower (p < 0.0001) because of an\nincrease in young-adult mean BMD at the neck and tro-\nchanter and a concomitant reduction in trochanteric SD\n(Table 1) compared with the GE Lunar database. As a\nresult of this T-score decrease, the number of women with\nosteoporosis at the femur according to WHO criteria in-\nNHANES III software update. Additionally 20% fewer\nwomen (p < 0.001) were classified as having normal bone\nmass after the NHANES III software update (Table 2;\nGE Lunar/Hologic comparison\nAs is widely recognized,(9,12) the measured BMD (g/cm2)\nat all femur sites was lower (p < 0.0001) using Hologic\ndensitometers than with GE Lunar instruments (Table 3).\nThese differences between densitometers of various manu-\nfacturers reflect different methods of dual-energy X-ray\ngeneration, edge detection paradigms, and region of inter-\nest placement.(13) Specifically, in this study, the mean Ho-\nthe total proximal femur, femur neck, and trochanter, re-\nspectively, than that measured using GE Lunar densitom-\neters.\nT-scores at the total proximal femur were very similar,\nwith a mean difference (p < 0.01) of 0.08. Specifically, the\nmean total proximal femur T-score in this population was\neters. This small difference likely does not have clinical\nsignificance. Consistent with absence of a clinically mean-\ningful effect, in this population, an equal number of women\n(n  6) were diagnosed as osteoporotic at the total proxi-\nmal femur. Femur neck and trochanter differences (p \n0.002) were larger, and the mean GE Lunar T-scores were\nfemur T-scores are presented in Fig. 2. Given the lower\nT-scores, one would expect that a larger number of women\nwould be diagnosed with osteoporosis using GE Lunar den-\nsitometers. Overall, using the lowest T-score of the total\nproximal femur, femur neck, and trochanter, 13 (14.6%) of\nthese women were classified as osteoporotic with GE Lunar\ndensitometers compared with 9 (10.1%) with Hologic in-\nstruments (Fig. 3).\nEffect of SD recalculation on\nosteoporosis prevalence\nBecause our observations suggested that the demon-\nstrated increase in osteoporosis diagnosis with the GE Lu-\nnar NHANES III software update might be caused by dif-\nferences in SD, we evaluated T-score and diagnostic\nagreement using our recalculated values. Using our recal-\nculated SD to derive T-scores reduced osteoporosis preva-\n7.8%. In the GE/Hologic comparison group, the mean T-\nthe trochanter (Fig. 2). As a result, an equal number of\nwomen (9) were diagnosed as osteoporotic at the femur\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious observations demonstrate the importance of us-\ning a standard normative database for T-score deriva-\ntion(3,4) to enhance diagnostic agreement. However, acqui-\nsition of NHANES III data exclusively using Hologic\ndensitometers(8) initially precluded database standardiza-\nFIG. 1. (A\u00adC) Effect of NHANES III software update on femur\nT-scores. Total femur T-scores in 115 postmenopausal women\nwere very similar (bias of 0.02 T-score). However, substantial bias\nwas present after the NHANES III update at the femur neck; the\nT-score for all subjects was 0.4 or 0.5 lower. This reflects an in-\n(pre- to post-update) without change in SD. Similarly, the tro-\nchanter T-score was 0.4\u00ad1.1 lower because of an increase in\ntion among manufacturers. To rectify this problem, conver-\nsion equations were previously developed allowing incor-\nporation of total proximal femur NHANES III data into\nother manufacturers normative databases. Therefore, be-\nfore the recent update, when \"USA/NHANES\" was se-\nlected in GE Lunar software, T-scores were derived using\nconverted NHANES III data at the total proximal femur\nbut not at the femur neck or trochanter, where the manu-\nfacturer's normative database was used. Our study shows\nthat the recent availability of equations allowing application\nof the NHANES III database to the femur neck and tro-\nchanter(12) results in lower T-scores at these sites than was\npreviously the case with the GE Lunar normative database.\nThis reduction in T-score is caused by increase in mean\nBMD combined with reduction in SD of the young-normal\npopulation. As such, osteoporosis prevalence (using the\nWHO criteria) is increased compared with prior GE soft-\nware and also compared with Hologic. Recalculation of the\nDiagnostic category\nupdate: [no.

Effect of database and densitometer on total proximal\nfemur T-score. Although statistically different (p < 0.01), the\nmean total proximal femur T-score of these 89 women was quite\nsimilar (range, -0.87 to -0.75) regardless of densitometer or soft-\nware used. Larger differences in mean T-score (p < 0.0005) be-\ntween GE Lunar and Hologic were present at the femur neck and\ntrochanter using either the pre- or post-NHANES III software\nupdate. Recalculation of the young-normal mean BMD and SD\nresolved the between-manufacturer difference at the femur neck\nbut not at the trochanter.\nFIG. 3. Osteoporosis prevalence at the hip. Using the lowest\nT-score of the total proximal femur, femur neck, and trochanter,\nthe T-score decrease that resulted from the GE Lunar NHANES\nIII software update increased (p  0.0005) osteoporosis preva-\nmenopausal women. In a second population of 89 women, use of\nour recalculated young-normal mean BMD and SD led to classi-\nfying an identical number (9) as osteoporotic with GE Lunar and\nHologic instruments.\nSD from published NHANES III data reduces the T-score\ndifference between GE Lunar and Hologic and yields an\nequal number of women diagnosed as osteoporotic. Al-\nthough not tested in this study, it is reasonable to assume\nthat the SD correction would improve T-score agreement\nnot only for GE Lunar Prodigy but also pencil-beam sys-\ntems. Thus, use of existing GE Lunar software that has\nincorporated converted NHANES III data at all femur sub-\nregions (versions 7.0 or higher) is not recommended.\nIn an attempt to minimize diagnostic discordance among\nmanufacturers, the ICSBM previously endorsed use of the\nNHANES III database for T-score derivation at the hip.(7)\nOn recalculation of the young-adult SD, this study shows\ngood agreement between GE Lunar and Hologic at the\ntotal proximal femur and femur neck. Thus, the expectation\nthat use of a common database would lead to similar T-\nscores and diagnosis is corroborated, and use of NHANES\nIII as the default hip database is affirmed. Recalculation\nand use of updated SD values at the femur neck and tro-\nchanter for GE densitometers is recommended.\nIn the interim, clinicians using GE Lunar densitometers\nmust be aware of the clinical impact of these reference\ndatabase changes that were incorporated into enCORE\nsoftware versions 7.0 and later. Because the femur neck and\ntrochanter T-scores are lowered by 0.5 and 0.7, respec-\ntively, diagnostic classification may worsen, despite stable\nBMD, in women whose bone mass is being monitored over\ntime. Such individuals should be advised that a change in\nthe data used for T-score determination, not a worsening of\ntheir condition, has occurred. Additionally, some individu-\nals receiving osteoporosis preventive therapy could, on fol-\nlow-up BMD measurement, have a statistically significant\nincrease in bone mass, but worsening of their diagnostic\ncategorization from osteopenia to osteoporosis. Clinicians\nand their patients must be aware that this \"worsening\" of\ndiagnostic status should not promote patient anxiety or lead\nto changes in therapeutic regimen, because it is simply a\nphenomenon of the software change. Additionally, it must\nbe emphasized that therapeutic response should always\nbe evaluated using change in BMD (g/cm2) and not T-\nscores.(14) Furthermore, if/when GE Lunar software up-\ngrades incorporate recalculated NHANES III values, the\nabove noted issues should be improved.\nThe observation that both the GE Lunar NHANES III\nsoftware update and our recalculated values result in lower\ntrochanter T-scores on GE Lunar instruments compared\nwith the prior database, coupled with the observation that\nthe T-score is now lower at this site than that observed with\nHologic densitometers, is cause for concern. It is important\nto note that conversion equations for the hip regions were\nderived from data acquired with an earlier generation GE\nLunar densitometer (DPX-L.)(12) Thus, it is possible that\nimprovements in GE Lunar trochanter edge detection pro-\ngrams that have occurred since that time are cause for this\ndiscrepancy. Regardless, discordance between GE Lunar\nand Hologic exists at the trochanter, such that more women\nwill be diagnosed as \"low\" at this site when using GE Lunar\ndensitometers than with Hologic. It is suggested that for-\nmulas allowing NHANES III data application to non-\nHologic densitometers be developed using current genera-\ntion instrumentation. Additionally, until this discordance is\nresolved, it seems prudent for clinicians to avoid using the\ntrochanter for diagnosis when using GE Lunar post-\nNHANES III update software, or at a minimum, use cau-\ntion when making treatment decisions based solely on tro-\nchanter T-score.\nIt is important to recognize that these T-score changes\nassociated with updating the GE Lunar NHANES III soft-\nware apply only to women. Equations allowing conversion\nof NHANES III data in men at the femur neck and tro-\nchanter have not been published, and Lu et. al.(12) specifi-\ncally caution that \"...more research is needed to determine\nwhether these results can be extended to other races and to\nmen.\" As such, in all GE Lunar software versions, the\nmanufacturer's proprietary normative database, not the\nNHANES III database, is used for men to derive T-scores\nat the femur neck and trochanter despite the statement on\nthe printout that the \"NHANES/USA\" femur reference\npopulation is used.\nT-score discrepancies, and therefore differences in diag-\nnostic categorization, can be caused by multiple factors in-\ncluding differences in technology, sites at which BMD is\nmeasured, and normative database used.(15) Additionally,\nas this study emphasizes, software updates may substan-\ntially alter T-score without affecting the measured BMD. In\nthe case of this particular software update, it is clear that the\n\"normal\" populations are not identical as the young-normal\nmean BMD, and SDs differ between the NHANES III and\nGE Lunar normative databases. It is not surprising that the\nyoung-normal populations differ, because NHANES used\nthese differences are smaller at the total femur, possibly\nbecause of the larger amount of bone being measured, than\nat the femur subregions. Although not evaluated in this\nstudy, it is possible that similar diagnostic disagreement ex-\nists at other skeletal sites. In fact, available data suggest that\nT-score agreement between manufacturers is quite good at\nthe lumbar spine in women,(16) but not in men,(17) and that\ndiagnostic discordance exists at the radius.(17) Attainment\nof a common database, by measuring BMD in a large num-\nber of young adults on all instruments, would rectify this\nsituation. In the absence of such, it is not possible to deter-\nmine which database or manufacturer is \"right.\" Therefore,\nuse of NHANES III after recalculation of the SD is the best\navailable option to achieve diagnostic agreement at the fe-\nmur at this time.\nFinally, this study emphasizes that the T-score based sys-\ntem of diagnosis is not ideal. The prevalence of osteopenia\nand osteoporosis in a population, and these diagnoses in\nindividual patients, may vary according to the mean BMD\nand SD of the young-normal population; values that may\nvary substantially if different populations are used to con-\nstruct the normative database. As such, T-score values may\nvary substantially despite similar BMD. Efforts to standard-\nize reference databases are encouraged in that establish-\nment of a single young-normal reference database among\nall densitometry manufacturers would minimize such diag-\nnostic discrepancies. Additionally, the use of fracture risk\nreporting may become a useful complement to diagnostic\nclassification by T-score, thereby allowing improved selec-\ntion of patients for therapeutic intervention.\nIn conclusion, the GE Lunar software update that allows\napplication of NHANES III data at the femur neck and\ntrochanter leads to lower T-scores at these sites. Recalcu-\nlation of the NHANES III young-normal SD reduces this\ndifference, but discrepancy remains at the trochanter, rais-\ning questions regarding conversion equation accuracy at\nthis site. Use of recalculated NHANES III values at the\nfemur subregions for GE Lunar densitometers is recom-\nmended. Clinicians must be aware of this database impact\non diagnosis and watch for a software upgrade correcting\nthe SD to assure optimal patient care. Difficulties with the\nT-score\u00adbased diagnostic system, such as those noted here,\nshould further prompt development of diagnostic criteria\nthat include estimates of absolute fracture risk. However, as\nan absolute fracture risk\u00adbased system is likely to retain use\nof T-scores, standardization of their derivation will remain\nessential to assure uniform diagnosis of osteoporosis.\n"
