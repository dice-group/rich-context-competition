A good internal\nrepresentation of the target object's structure is necessary to capture its proportion and shape in\nthe drawing. Here, we assess two aspects of the perception of object structure and relate them to\nparticipants' drawing accuracy. First, we assessed drawing accuracy by computing the geometrical\ndissimilarity of their drawing to the target object. We then used two tasks to evaluate the efficiency\nof encoding object structure. First, to examine the rate of temporal encoding, we varied presentation\nduration of a possible versus impossible test object in the fovea using two different test sizes (8\u00b0\nand 28\u00b0). More skilled participants were faster at encoding an object's structure, but this difference\nwas not affected by image size. A control experiment showed that participants skilled in drawing did\nnot have a general advantage that might have explained their faster processing for object structure.\nSecond, to measure the critical image size for accurate classification in the periphery, we varied\nimage size with possible versus impossible object tests centered at two different eccentricities (3\u00b0\nand 8\u00b0). More skilled participants were able to categorise object structure at smaller sizes, and this\nadvantage did not change with eccentricity. A control experiment showed that the result could not\nbe attributed to differences in visual acuity, leaving attentional resolution as a possible explanation.\nOverall, we conclude that drawing accuracy is related to faster encoding of object structure and better\naccess to crowded details.\n",

Here, we will examine if this skill is related to the ability to\nprocess object structure when tested in a non-drawing context. The common excuse many of us give\nfor our poor drawing performance is a lack of the motor coordination required to draw the object out-\nlines. However, Tchalenko (2007) showed that novices were as accurate as experts in tracing simple\nstraight and curved lines and experts were only more accurate when copying more complex arrays of\nlines (Tchalenko, 2009). If it is not simply an advantage in motor control, perhaps experts are able\nto perceive the target patterns more accurately (Cohen & Bennett, 1997). For example, studies using\nNavon stimuli (Chamberlain, McManus, Riley, Rankin, & Brunswick, 2013; Drake & Winner, 2011),\nhave shown that observers who are skilled in drawing are better able to disregard the global shape\nof the stimulus when required to report local shape. In line with this perceptual advantage, Mitchell,\nRopar, Ackroyd, and Rajendran (2005) reported that the magnitude of perceptual errors made in a\nShepard illusion task was inversely correlated with the participants' drawing skills. Several studies\nextended this result to perceptual tasks involving shape (Cohen & Jones, 2008) and size constancy\n(Ostrofsky, Kozbelt, & Seidel, 2012). However, these findings have been challenged by several fail-\nures to replicate (McManus, Loo, Chamberlain, Riley, & Brunswick, 2011; Ostrofsky et al., 2012 in\ntheir shape constancy task; Perdreau & Cavanagh, 2011, 2013a) calling into question the idea that skill\nin drawing is related to more accurate (veridical) perception. If accuracy in drawing is not a result of\nbetter perception (i.e. more veridical) or motor coordination, where does it come from? In a previous\nstudy (Perdreau & Cavanagh, 2013b), we suggested that drawing skill relies on the ability to construct\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding\nobject structure\n*Corresponding author.\nand maintain a robust internal representation of object structure in visual memory (i.e. the relative\nspatial position of the object's segments).\nThis robust internal representation is critical because observational drawing is characterised by\nmany sequential eye-movements between the original object and the drawing, both to encode the\nto-be-drawn information and to visually control the hand position on the drawing (Coen-Cagli et al.,\nTchalenko (2009) showed that experts in drawing used a segmentation process, encoding and copying\nthe object line by line, while novices tended to process larger areas of the object. This is consistent\nwith previous findings (Cohen, 2005) showing that artists shift their gaze more often between the\noriginal object and the drawing than beginners. According to these studies, a segmentation process\nselects salient portions of the object, reducing the amount of information to be encoded as well as the\nload on visual memory. Consistent with this hypothesis, Glazek (2012) found that experts in drawing\ndrew more information than novices even when both groups saw the same extent of the target for the\nsame duration. This suggests that more skilled participants may be able to encode more information\n(bigger chunks, e.g. Gobet & Simon, 1996) at each fixation. It remains unclear, though, how the vari-\nous segments and chunks can be successfully integrated despite the many changes in retinal inputs and\nreference frames (Cai, Pouget, Schlag-Rey, & Schlag, 1997; Crawford, Medendorp, & Marotta, 2004).\nIn a previous study (Perdreau & Cavanagh, 2013b) relating drawing skill to object encoding, we\nexamined the ability to discriminate possible from impossible objects (Schacter, Cooper, Delaney,\nPeterson, & Tharan, 1991; Schacter, Cooper, & Delaney, 1990) while viewing only a portion of the\nobject viewed through a window, centred on the fovea, that moved with the gaze. We found that more\nskilled and experienced participants could discriminate an object's structure based on a smaller visible\nportion of the object. These results suggested that the more skilled and trained participants had a more\nrobust mental representation of the object's global organisation that allowed them to add new portions\nfrom small samples acquired across several eye-movements. Many of the requirements of this contin-\ngent window task are shared with those of a drawing task--for example, sampling small segments of\nthe object over many fixations and building an internal representation of its global structure.\nHowever, our previous study could not rule out the possibility that the advantage of skilled partici-\npants was due to more efficient coding of the object's structure \"at a single glance\" in addition to a more\nrobust internal representation sequentially built across eye movements. Our present study will address\nthis question of perceptual encoding (how much can be encoded at a glance) versus construction across\neye movements. We compared how quickly object processing can operate in a single fixation and\nrelated it to participants' drawing skills. We presented possible and impossible objects and varied the\nstimulus-mask SOA (from 8 ms to 1500 ms) as well as the extent of space covered by the object around\nthe central fixation dot (8\u00b0 or 28\u00b0 of width, fixation controlled with an eye-tracker). This allowed us to\nmeasure the time required by our participants to encode object structure for a single fixation.\nA second question that we addressed was the importance of peripheral information. Tchalenko\n(2007) has suggested that during drawing, even with gaze locked within a 5\u00b0 range either around\nthe pencil tip or the currently selected target segment, peripheral information may help to locate the\ncurrent region of interest within the object's global organisation (e.g. using the paper's edge that is\nvisible in the periphery to check the line's orientation). We assessed the role of peripheral information\nin a separate experiment in a previous study (Perdreau & Cavanagh, 2013b) where central vision was\nmasked and participants could only see the periphery as they explored the test object. We found no\nadvantage for the skilled participants but in that task participants could see only the periphery (masked\ncentral vision). In contrast, during a drawing task, the entire structure of the target object is visible so\nit is possible that peripheral information might help build the representation if central information is\nalso present. Therefore, in addition to varying the stimulus duration in this first experiment, we also\nvaried the size of the object, centred at fixation point (8\u00b0 or 28\u00b0) to see how large an expanse of spatial\ninformation could be analysed at a single glance (visual span, Rayner, 1998). If drawing accuracy is\nrelated to larger visual spans, then the more skilled participants may be better able to make use of\nperipheral information (i.e. beyond about 3\u00b0 of eccentricity) giving them more of an advantage at the\nlarger image size than the smaller.\nFinally, classifying an object as possible or impossible requires access to the individual features\nof the object's structure, its lines and junctions, in order to construct its global representation. During\nfree viewing, the different local features can be scanned with eye movements to access them, but in our\nexperiments, participants had to fixate a central dot throughout the trial (monitored by an eye-tracker)\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding object structure 103\nso that stimuli were inspected without eye movements. This means that when adjacent features are\nclosely spaced and presented in the periphery, they may be hard to access or individuate as they may be\ncrowded. In a second experiment, we examined the role of crowding by varying object size (1\u00b0 to 12\u00b0)\nat two locations in the periphery (3\u00b0 or 8\u00b0. crowding experiments are typically run at 3\u00b0 or more in the\nperiphery) to see if participants with better drawing skills were also better able to access closely spaced\ndetails in the periphery. It is well known that the presence of flankers surrounding a target can impair\nthe identification, recognition and position encoding of a target (Greenwood, Bex, & Dakin, 2009;\n2001). This phenomenon is commonly referred to as visual crowding and it has been described as a\nlimit of the spatial resolution of visual attention (He, Cavanagh, & Intriligator, 1996, 1997). This effect\nis dependent on the spacing between items and the critical spacing to produce crowding is a constant\nproportion of the target's eccentricity (Bouma, 1970). The crowding effect is seen not only for dis-\ncrete items--targets and flankers--but also for inner features of complex stimuli like faces, where the\nresulting difficulty in recognising the whole stimulus has been called self-crowding (Martelli et al.,\n2005). This self-crowding will impose a limitation on the access to local features required to build the\nobject structure in our possible versus impossible task and this limitation should be particularly critical\nfor peripheral presentation where crowding is stronger. Interestingly, it has been shown that attentional\nresolution, and the ability to individuate features within a cluttered visual environment in periphery,\ncan be enhanced by intensive training (e.g. in video game players; Green & Bavelier, 2007). For this\nreason, we suggest that one consequence of the years of drawing experience of participants with better\ndrawing skills is to reduce the effects of crowding. They should be able to access individual features\nof the objects at smaller image sizes in our impossible versus possible object task, when their close\nspacing will produce significant crowding and performance loss for the less skilled participants.\nAlthough object size was manipulated in both experiments, we expected that size would have\ndifferent effects in the two tasks. In the first experiment, the size was manipulated with the test object\nalways centred at the fovea (Experiment 1a). This should not affect the degree of crowding because\nfoveally centred scaling maintains the critical ratios of feature spacing to eccentricity (Bouma, 1970).\nHowever, the larger size will increase the absolute inter-feature distance, which may require extra\ntime to covertly scan the figure (Chakravarthi & VanRullen, 2011; Donnelly, Found, & M\u00fcller, 1999;\nKosslyn, Ball, & Reiser, 1978; Posner, Petersen, Fox, & Raichle, 1988) especially if the image size\nexceeds the participant's perceptual span (Rayner, 1998). In contrast, varying the size of an object that\nis centred in the periphery (Experiment 2a) will interact with crowding. Increasing its size in this case\nwill increase feature spacing relative to eccentricity for the more peripheral features, diminishing the\neffect of crowding. We expected that increasing the size, and therefore the spacing between the object's\nfeatures, leads to better classification performances in this second experiment and that the critical size\nneeded for accurate performance also increases with eccentricity (we tested 3\u00b0 vs. 8\u00b0). However, we\nhypothesised that more skilled participants have better attentional resolution--they can individuate\nfeatures with closer spacing--and so they should be able to accurately classify the stimuli at smaller\nsizes. Again, if the skilled participants use peripheral information more efficiently (have larger visual\nspans), their performance may not decrease as much at larger eccentricities as that of the novices.\n2 General method\nParticipants\nNovice participants were all recruited from a pool of voluntary participants (RISC), whereas profes-\nsional artists and art students were recruited in art schools and workshops (n 5 10; age 5 27.3  1.9,\n6 females). Although the present study focused on drawing skill and not artistic ability, however that\nmight be defined, we included artists and artists in training to increase the range of tested drawing\nskills. All the participants were na\u00efve about the purpose of this study and our hypotheses. They all\nhad a normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Before taking part in the experiments, they all gave their\nexplicit written consent according to the principles defined by the University Paris Descartes ethics\ncommittee.\nMaterial\nAll the experiments, except for experiment 2B, used the same apparatus. The participant's head was\nheld by a chinrest so that his or her eyes were approximately 55 cm from the screen's centre. The\nstimuli were projected on a 22 CRT screen, with a resolution of 1024  768 pixels and with a frame\nrate of 120 Hz. The experiments were programmed in MATLAB using the Psychophysics and Eyelink\non an Apple computer.\nParticipants' eye movements were recorded with an eye-tracking system (SR research Eyelink\nthe participant's dominant eye (9-point calibration. Eye dominance was assessed with an aiming task).\nFinally, eye-movements events and saccades were parsed using the Eyelink 1000 algorithm (saccade\nObject selection\nThe object selection procedure we used in this study was similar to that presented in Perdreau and\nCavanagh, (2013b). Part of the set of possible and impossible objects used in the present study was\ntaken from previous collections (Schacter et al., 1991; Soldan, Hilton, & Stern, 2009; used with\nauthors' permission). The other objects were outlined versions of impossible objects provided by an\nInternet database (\"Impossible world\" website), and one of the authors (PF) designed corresponding\npossible versions using Adobe Illustrator CS4. At the end, our collection included a possible and an\nIn order to reduce the ambiguity about the structural possibility or the impossibility of the objects\nused in our experiments, we asked 20 independent observers, not participating in this study, to judge\nall our line-drawn objects as being structurally possible or not. They were particularly instructed that:\nobjects were drawn with lines, every line represented a visible edge of the object, every visible edge\nwas necessarily represented, an object's surfaces could only face one direction and were opaque and\nobjects were volumes standing in a 3D space. All objects were seen in a random order. Only objects\nthat had an inter-observers agreement equal to or larger than 95% were kept and used in the experi-\nments presented in this paper (a total of 317 objects of which 170 were possible objects).\nIn addition, a previous study reported that perceived impossibility may be related to the object's\ncomplexity (Carrasco & Seamon, 1996). Thus, we computed complexity of every object according\nto the number of line segments and junctions. Objects complexity was normalised and objects were\ncategorised as below (\"Low complexity\") or above (\"High complexity\") the median object complex-\nity. Next, for each main experiment, we randomly selected 160 objects to create Low- and High-\ncomplexity levels for both possible and impossible object categories (40 objects in each category)\nsuch that the average complexity of Low-possible versus Low-Impossible and High-possible versus\nHigh-Impossible were not statistically different (p  .05). These categories were subsequently used to\nmatch object complexity across our experimental conditions.\nDrawing accuracy\nTo assess our participants' drawing accuracy, we asked them to perform a drawing task where they\nhad 15 min to copy a greyscale picture of an inverted house (Figure 1A) as accurately as possible, that\nFigure 1. Examples of structurally possible and impossible line-drawn objects used in the present study.\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding object structure 105\nis, without emphasising aestheticism or style. The use of an inverted house may avoid any canonical\nperception of the stimulus that could decrease drawing accuracy, even if the existence of such effect\nhas not been demonstrated (Cohen & Earls, 2010). Moreover, without well-practiced elements to\nrepresent (e.g. an ordinary house), the artists, like the non-artists, would be showing their basic copy-\ning skills. The original picture was displayed on a computer screen and our participants had to copy\nit on a white A4 sheet of paper using a pencil. They were allowed to erase and correct their drawing\nas many times as they wished. Because the picture had many elements to draw, we asked participants\nto start by tracing the house's structure, then to depict its details and if they had enough time, to copy\nthe house's environment (trees, etc.). This made sure that all of our participants went through the same\nstages and had completed at least the first of them (house's structure, which we used in our subsequent\nmeasurements).\nDrawing accuracy is usually measured by asking independent observers to subjectively rate\nthe drawings made by participants on a scale according to specific instructions (Cohen & Bennett,\nobservers agreement, it does not allow the experimenter to know what criteria have been used by\nthe observers, nor if these criteria vary across observers and across studies (Perdreau & Cavanagh,\n2013a). Several recent studies have presented novel geometrically based methods to measure drawing\naccuracy, either using angles and proportion (Carson, Millard, Quehl, & Danckert, 2012; Chamberlain\n& McManus, 2013) or more sophisticated shape-matching algorithms (Hayes & Milne, 2011). In this\nstudy, we present a simple procedure based on the object's structure (i.e. the relative spatial posi-\ntion of the object's junctions). This single measure can account for angle accuracy, proportion and\nshape. First, we manually selected 16 junctions present in all drawings that defined the house's shape\n(Figure 2A). Next, we centred both the original picture and the drawings on their leftmost selected\njunction. Moreover, because we hypothesised that object's structure might be independent from the\nobject's overall size, as it is defined as the relative spatial position of the object's parts, we normalised\nthe junctions coordinates to the maximum horizontal and vertical coordinates in order to match the\nhouse size (Figure 2B). Finally, we computed the drawing's accuracy as the mean of the percent-\nage root-mean-square error (%RMSE) computed on each axis (x and y) between the 16 points in the\noriginal and in the drawing:\nd o\no\nC C n\nn C\n -\n= \u00d7\n\nwhere Cd are the transformed coordinates of the copied house, Co the transformed coordinates of the\noriginal house and n the number of selected points (n 5 16). Smaller root-mean-square errors mean\nbetter drawing accuracy.\nWe next evaluated this geometrical measure by comparing it to human observers'subjective judg-\nments of accuracy. To do so, we designed an online experiment where randomly selected pairs of\ndrawings were presented to participants (n 5 245) as well as the original picture. Online experiments\nare known to yield to a similar data quality compared to experiments run in laboratories (Germine\net al., 2012). The task was to choose, by clicking on it with the mouse, which of the two drawings more\nprecisely matched the original house. Participants were instructed to make their judgment on the basis\nof the house's proportion and structure, and not on the amount of detail, the size, style or aestheticism\nof the drawing. Each participant saw a maximum of 200 pairs of drawings and each possible pair was\ncompared by at least 40 independent participants. To rank each drawing, we used the ELO ranking\nalgorithm developed to rank players in two-competitor games like chess (Elo, 1978). The algorithm\ncomputes a probability of win for each compared item (a vs. b) according to its past results and to the\nscore of the other item in the comparison:\ndif\n(win) ,\na f\np\n-\n=\n-\nwhere diff is the difference between item a and b's previous ELO scores:\n,prev ,prev\ndiff Score Score .\nb a\nThis probability is then used to compute the item a's new score:\n,new ,prev\nScore Score ( (win)),\na a a a\nW p\nn\nwhere W is the item's outcome for the current comparison, a versus b, (W 5 1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw\nand 0 for a loss) and n is the number of previous comparisons for the item. These scores for each item\nreach a final value across all the comparisons made for that item across all the participants.\nThese subjective rankings were highly consistent with the original geometrical measures [r(35) 5\nused them in our evaluations of the participants' performance in the experiments that follow.\n3 Experiment 1a: Visual masking\nThe purpose of this experiment was to test two hypotheses: 1) whether drawing accuracy is related to\nthe efficiency of encoding object structure as measured by the threshold presentation duration of the\nstimulus prior a mask, and 2) whether drawing accuracy is related to the extent of space that can be\nencoded at a single glance.\nParticipants\nThirty participants took part in this experiment [average age 24.4  0.8, 15 females, 10 artists, of\nwhich 6 were female]. Three of these participants were dropped from the analysis as their performance\nin the main experiment never reached threshold in the tested range and no psychometric function could\nbe fit to their results.\nStimuli\nWe generated a list of 160 randomly selected objects from our original collection (40 objects per cat-\negory and complexity level) that was identical for every participant. All objects were repeated three\ntimes during the experiment and they were randomly distributed so that they could not appear within\nthe same experimental condition and with the same orientation ( 5 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0).\nProcedure\nPrior to the main experiments, participants performed in a practice session to familiarise them-\nselves with the task and the difference between structurally possible and impossible objects. We first\nFigure 2. Geometrically measured drawing error. (a) First, we manually selected 16 junctions present in all the\ndrawings (coloured dots) and the original picture, which defined the house's shape and structure. (b) Next, we\nnormalised their coordinates to the maximum horizontal and vertical coordinates, and computed the mean RMS\nerror of each drawing on the basis on these transformed coordinates.\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding object structure 107\ninstructed our participants, like those participating in the object selection procedure, that: objects are\ndrawn with lines, every line represents an edge of the object, every edge is necessarily represented and\nobject's surfaces can only face one direction and are opaque, and objects are volumes standing in a 3D\nspace. All objects used in this practice session were different from those presented in the other experi-\nments. Next, we showed some examples of possible and impossible objects and asked the participants\nwhether this categorisation made sense to her or to him. Finally, participants ran in 80 practice trials.\nOn each trial, a 21\u00b0  21\u00b0 line-drawn object was displayed centred on the screen. Participants had to\nanswer, as fast and accurately as possible, whether this object was structurally possible or not. They\nhad a maximum of 5 s to give their answer. Otherwise, the screen was blanked out and the participant\nwas told to give a response.\nIn the main experiment, eye-movements were monitored using an eye-tracking system. Each trial\nstarted with a central fixation dot that the participant had to fixate for 200 ms to start the trial (Figure 3).\nAfter a random delay of 600\u00ad900 ms, a line-drawn object was displayed centred on the screen. We var-\nas well as its size (8\u00b0 or 28\u00b0 of visual angle). After this duration, the object was immediately replaced\nby a dynamic mask with a duration of 16 frames (Bacon-Mac\u00e9, Mac\u00e9, Fabre-Thorpe, & Thorpe, 2005).\nFinally, a red central dot was displayed, indicating to the participants that he or she had a maximum\nof 2 s to respond. Participants had to fixate the central dot during the entire trial. If a participant's gaze\ndeviated by more than 1\u00b0 from this dot, the trial was ended and was replayed later in the experiment.\nSpecifically, participants were told to report whether the object was structurally possible or impossible,\nas fast and accurately as possible, by pressing the appropriate key (\"left control\" or \"right control,\"\nrespectively). Feedback was shown to participants every 20 trials to indicate their overall performance\nas well as their progression. This was designed to keep the participants motivated.\nWe manipulated the object's presentation duration (six from 8 to 1,500 ms) as well as its size (8\u00b0\nor 28\u00b0) and its complexity level (low or high) as within-subject factors, although the latter factor was\nonly treated as a control variable for an effect of complexity on perceived impossibility.\nThe experiment started with a practice block of 24 trials where we presented every possible condi-\ntion to the participants. This was followed by 480 trials divided into six blocks of 80 trials each. We\ncalibrated the eye-tracking system and made a drift correction at the beginning of each block.\nResults\nWe first compared the participants' pretest performance (percent correct categorisation of the 80 pos-\nsible and impossible objects without eye movement constraints) to their drawing accuracy. The two\nmeasures showed a correlation of 0.45 [p  .005], suggesting that more skilled participants could\nbetter discriminate possible from impossible objects in a free viewing condition. This preliminary\ncorrelation should be viewed with some caution as a similar baseline condition in our previous study\nFigure 3. Correlation between objectively (x axis) and subjectively (y axis) measured drawing accuracy. Each dot\nrepresents a participant's drawing. The filled area is the 95% bootstrapped confidence interval of the regression\nline.\n(Perdreau & Cavanagh, 2013b) did not show a significant correlation, again between drawing accuracy\nand performance. One difference between the two studies was that the time available for the response\nwas shorter (5 s) here than in the previous study (10 s). It is possible that this extra time in the previous\nexperiment was sufficient to allow the less skilled participants to catch up to the performance of the\nskilled participants.\nIn the analysis of the main experiment, we first fitted a logistic function on proportions of correct\nresponses plotted against SOAs (Figure 5A) for each participant and object size (8 and 28\u00b0), using\na maximum likelihood procedure with a fixed gamma parameter of 50% (2-AFC. Prins, 2012). The\noverall quality of individual fits was good and reliable [mean deviance: 3.12(SE: 0.29), Ps.05].\nNext, we computed the critical SOA for each participant and object size, defined as the SOA value\nleading to 75% correct responses. However, three of our participants had very poor performance in this\nexperiment despite good performance in the pretest, which led to undefined (infinite) thresholds. We\nexcluded these three participants from the following analyses.\nTo measure whether better accuracy in drawing is related to faster encoding of object structure,\nand to an ability to make such encoding over a larger extent of space, we computed the regression\nbetween participants' drawing error score and their critical SOA using a linear mixed-effects1 model\non log-transformed2 SOA and error values with drawing error and object size as fixed factors and with\nparticipants as a random factor to account for our repeated-measures design (Figure 5B). We found a\nHowever, we found no significant interaction between object size and drawing accuracy [ 5 20.44\n1 Linear mixed-effects models are extensions of linear regression models, including both fixed effects (linear regression part)\nand random effects that allow random individual variations across a grouping factor's levels (as in repeated-measures ANOVA).\nLinear mixed-effects models presented in this study were computed using the lme4 R package with an ML procedure (Bates,\nMaechler, & Bolker, 2012). Main effects and interaction effects were tested by using a likelihood ratio-test, which compares the\nresidual deviance of both the full model and the reduced model (full model without the factor of interest) and approaches a \u00b2\ndistribution. In addition, we report the log\u00adlog regression slope (b) to characterize the effect direction.\n2 A diagnostic of the linear model's residuals showed an heavy heteroscedasticity when we used raw values. This can be\nexplained by the presence of a lower bound in both participant's critical SOAs and drawing accuracy (theoretical minimum at 0).\nUsing log-transformed values solved this issue. We applied this data transformation in all of the following analysis.\nFigure 4. Experiment 1's procedure. Participants had to fixate a central dot for 200 ms to start the trial. After\na random delay (600\u00ad900 ms), the stimulus was displayed, centred on the screen. We manipulated stimulus\npresentation duration (from 8 ms to 1500 ms) and size (8\u00b0 or 28\u00b0). Participants had to maintain their fixation on\nthe central dot throughout the trial (within 1\u00b0).\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding object structure 109\nshorter presentation durations to make accurate decision about the object's structure. Although noisy,\nthe effect was quite large with the regression showing a three to five-fold increase in the critical dura-\ntion required to classify the objects for least skilled versus most skilled participants. This relation was\nnot affected by object size.\n4 Experiment 1b: Lexical-decision\nThe more skilled participants needed less time to make accurate judgments of possible versus impossi-\nble objects. However, this might reflect some general advantage of the skilled participants for any task.\nAs a control for a general processing advantage, we ran a lexical-decision task that required integration\nof letters across space to determine if the letters made a possible or impossible word. Other than the\nnature of the stimuli, the experiment had the exact same conditions as the possible\u00adimpossible object\ntask.

Filled areas are the 95%\nbootstrapped confidence intervals of the regression lines.\nand non-words were collected from a French database (LEXIQUE 3.55; New, Pallier, Brysbaert, &\nFerrand, 2004). More particularly and to avoid any ambiguities of an effect of words frequency, and\npossibly of participants'education, on participants'performances, we selected words with a frequency\ngreater than 100 times per million words, based on appearances in books, subtitles, webpages, etc.\nLikewise, for non-words we selected actual French trigrams (sequences of letters making a pronounce-\nable non-word) that had the same mean frequency of occurrence in French as that of the words we used\nin this task. Finally, to match the first experiment's conditions, we manipulated the number of letters of\nwords and non-words (4 or 8) to simulate words visual complexity as well as their horizontal size (8\u00b0\nor 28\u00b0). As in the previous experiment, words complexity was matched across presentation durations.\nWe had a total of 90 words and 90 non-words, each of them having been seen three times during the\nexperiment.\nProcedure\nThe procedure was identical to that used in the first experiment, with the exception that now partici-\npants were asked to categorise the briefly displayed word as a word present in French language or not.\nResults\nAs previously, we fitted logistic functions on participants' proportions of correct responses, plotted\nagainst words presentation duration, and we computed a critical SOA for each participant and each\nstimulus size (Figure 4C). The overall quality of fit was very high [mean deviance: 2.45(SE: 0.29),\nNext, we computed the regression between drawing accuracy and critical SOA using a linear\nmixed-effects model on participants' critical SOAs with participants' drawing error and word size as\nfixed factors, participants as random factor. We found a significant main effect of word size on partici-\noverall need longer presentation duration to encode larger words accurately. In contrast to the first\nFigure 6. Experiment 2A's procedure. Participants had to fixate a central dot for 200 ms to start the trial. After\na random delay of 600\u00ad900 ms, a line-drawn object was displayed in the participant's right visual periphery. It\nremained on the screen until the participant gave his or her response. They were asked to categorise the object\nas structurally possible or impossible, and they had 5 s maximum to respond. If no response was given within\nthis time, the screen was blanked out and the participant was asked to answer. In this experiment, we particularly\nvaried the object's size (from 1\u00b0 to 12\u00b0) and its eccentricity (3\u00b0 or 8\u00b0).\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding object structure 111\nTaken together, these results show that the more efficient processing of object structure by skilled\nparticipants that we found in the first main experiment could not be attributed to a more efficient\nencoding of visual stimuli in general.\nThe first experiment's results suggest that drawing accuracy might be related to a more efficient encod-\ning of object structure seen in a single fixation but not to the ability to encode this structural informa-\ntion over larger visual spans without eye movements. This latter finding might not be surprising, for\ndrawing is characterised as a sequential, segmentation process (Tchalenko, 2009). For instance, an\nartist might need to encode the segment's position only in the context of elements located in a par-\nticular area of the segment's immediate surroundings. The present experiment aims at testing whether\ndrawing accuracy would be related to a more efficient encoding of structural information located in\nparticipants' visual periphery.\nParticipants\nwhich 6 were female]. Four of these participants were dropped from the analysis (leaving 30) as their\nperformance in one of the two main conditions never reached the threshold in the tested range and no\npsychometric function could be fit to their results.\nFigure 7. Experiment 2A's and 2B's results. (a) Example of individual fits. As in the first experiments, we fitted\nlogistic functions on participant's proportion of correct responses plotted against SOA and we measured a critical\nsize for each eccentricity (3\u00b0 and 8\u00b0) as the object size leading to 75% correct response. Horizontal error bars are\nthe 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals of the estimated critical SOA. (b) Next, we computed the regressions\nbetween drawing error and critical size.

(d) The\nregressions between drawing error and critical size for the Landolt's C task. Filled areas are the non-parametric\n95% bootstrapped confidence intervals of the regression slopes (10,000 runs).\nStimuli\nIn this experiment, we only used the subset of \"low-complexity\" line-drawn objects from our collection, as\na pilot experiment revealed that the task was nearly impossible to perform in the periphery with the most\ncomplex objects. We used a total of 60 objects per category (possible and impossible) that were repeated\nfour times during the experiment, but never within the same condition or with the same orientation.\nProcedure\nParticipants had to fixate a central dot for 200 ms to automatically start the trial. After a random delay\nvarying between 600 and 900 ms, a line-drawn object was displayed in the right visual periphery of\nthe observer (Figure 6). Participants were told to fixate a central dot all along the trial. Eye movements\nwere continuously recorded with an eye-tracker, and every time participants' gaze deviated by more\nthan 1\u00b0 from this central dot, the object disappeared. Participants were asked to categorise the object as\nstructurally possible or impossible, and they had 5 s maximum to give their response. They were asked\nto respond as fast and accurately as possible by pressing the appropriate key (\"left control\" or \"right\ncontrol\"). If no response was given within this time, the screen was blanked out and the participant was\ntold to give a response. We varied the object size (eight sizes from 1\u00b0 to 12\u00b0) as well as its eccentricity\nfrom the central dot (3\u00b0 or 8\u00b0).\nEach participant started the experiment with a training block of 32 trials, which crossed all experi-\nmental conditions. Then, participants ran in 480 trials (8 sizes  2 eccentricity, with 30 trials per con-\ndition), which were divided into four blocks. As in the first experiment, participants received feedback\nabout their overall performance and progression every 20 trials. They were free to take a break during\nthese feedback pauses and between every block of trials.\nResults\nLogistic functions were fitted on participants' proportion of correct responses plotted against object's\nsize for each tested eccentricity [mean deviance: 6.24(SE: 0.49), Ps.05]. We then measured the criti-\ncal size as the object size leading to 75% correct responses (Figure 7A).\nTo measure how the efficiency of discriminating possible from impossible figures varies with\neccentricity and drawing accuracy, we computed regressions between drawing error and critical object\nFigure 8. Experiment 2B's procedure. Each trial starts with a fixation dot displayed for a randomly chosen interval\nbetween 300 and 600 ms. Then, a Landolt's C was briefly flashed for a duration of 100 ms. Once it disappeared,\nparticipants could give their response. We manipulated the position of the gap in the C (top, right, bottom or\nleft) and participants had to report this position by pressing the corresponding arrow key. We varied the C's\neccentricity as well as its gap size (proportional to the overall size). For each tested eccentricity, two independent\nand intermixed staircases were used to measure the gap size leading to 62.5% correct responses (4-AFC).\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding object structure 113\nsize using a linear mixed-effects model on the log-transformed participants' critical size, with log\ndrawing error and object eccentricity as fixed factors, participants as random factor (Figure 7B) Not\nsurprisingly, we found a significant main effect of eccentricity on participants' critical object size [\nobject sizes to accurately discriminate between possible/impossible figures at farther eccentricities. As\nin the first experiment, there was a significant linear relation between drawing error and critical object\non average smaller sizes to categorise an object as structurally possible or impossible when presented\nin visual periphery. Again, although noisy, the effect of drawing skill was large, with the regression\nshowing a two to three-fold increase in the required object size required for accurate classification\nbetween the least skilled and most skilled participants. Finally, we found no significant interaction\nbetween object eccentricity and the relation between drawing error and participants' critical sizes\nOne explanation for the ability of more skilled participants to accurately process smaller objects is\nthat they have smaller critical zone for crowding--they can access local features when they are more\nclosely spaced. However, this effect of drawing skill did not vary with eccentricity. This advantage\nfor skilled participants in processing smaller stimuli is surprising at a first glance, since we found no\ndifference in the effect of object size for skilled versus unskilled participants in our first experiment.\nHowever, as we stated in our introduction, object size has different effects for an object centred at the\nfovea, as was the case in Experiment 1, compared to one centred in periphery, as here in Experiment 2.\nIn the first case, size changes should not affect the strength of inter-feature crowding because the ratios\nof feature spacing to eccentricity that determine crowding are maintained when size changes are cen-\ntred at the fovea. In contrast, with objects centred in the periphery, size changes do affect the feature-\nspacing to eccentricity ratios. Therefore, in line with our hypothesis of a better attentional resolution\nfor skilled participants, one explanation of their advantage is that they were better with smaller stimuli\nat finding and individuating features required to construct the object's structure and detect violations.\nThe relationship we found between drawing accuracy and the participants' critical object size could\neasily be due to better peripheral visual acuity in more skilled participants. To evaluate this alternative\nexplanation, we ran a Landolt's C test at the same eccentricities.\nParticipants\nParticipants were identical to those who participated in the previous experiment (2a), and we again\nexcluded the four who had been removed from the analysis in that experiment (n 5 30).\nMaterial\nThe participant's chin was held by a chinrest so that his or her eyes were centered on the screen at a\ndistance of 105 cm. In this experiment, we used a 30-inch flat screen (30-inch Apple Cinema HD Dis-\nplay), with a spatial resolution of 2560  1600 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. This setting allowed\nus to display the very small visual angles required by our task.\nProcedure\nEach trial started with a fixation dot centred on the screen for a random time of 300\u00ad600 ms. Next, a\nLandolt's C was briefly flashed for 100 ms in the right visual periphery (Figure 8). Once the central\ndot disappeared, the participants could give his or her response. Participants were asked to report the\nposition of the gap in the C (left, right, top, or bottom) by pressing the corresponding arrow key. In\nthis experiment, we manipulated the C's eccentricity (3\u00b0 or 8\u00b0) as well as the C's gap size. The latter\nwas determined by using two interleaved and independent adaptive staircases (adaptive stochastic\napproximation procedure; Kesten, 1958) for each eccentricity, one starting at 0.013\u00b0 and the other at\n0.20\u00b0. The aim of these staircases was to determine the threshold C's gap size for which participants'\nperformance on this 4-AFC task was 62.5% correct (chance level: 25%).\nResults\nIn order to assess the relationship between our participant's drawing accuracy and their visual acuity,\nwe computed the regression between drawing error and threshold gap size using a linear mixed-effects\nmodel on log-transformed thresholds, with eccentricity and drawing error as fixed factors, participants\nas random factors (Figure 7D). As expected, we found a significant main effect of eccentricity on\nThese results show no evidence of a relationship between drawing error score and participants'\nvisual acuity in visual periphery. Therefore, it is unlikely that the advantage of more skilled partici-\npants in discriminating possible from impossible objects in the periphery could be due to a more accu-\nrate perception of these objects.\n7 General discussion\nDo artists and others skilled at drawing have any general advantages in processing visual information?\nSeveral previous experiments have suggested that they do (e.g. Glazek, 2012; Perdreau & Cavanagh,\n2013b; Tchalenko, 2009). In many of these experiments, however, participants were allowed to scan\na test image and we cannot know if the performance differences arose from advantages in integrat-\ning information across eye movements or from advantages in encoding information from individual\nfixations. In our experiments here, we asked whether participants with better drawing skills would\nhave any advantages when their access to the stimulus was limited to a single glance (no scanning\neye movements allowed). Participants of varying levels of drawing skill classified line drawings as\npossible or impossible objects: in the first experiment, presentation time was varied to measure the\nspeed of processing object structure as well as the spatial extent over which this processing could be\naccomplished at a single glance; in the second experiment, object size was varied at different locations\nin the visual periphery to see whether participants with better drawing skills could correctly classify\nstimuli at smaller sizes or further eccentricity.\nFirst, we measured our participants'drawing errors both objectively and subjectively. We extended\nan objective method that geometrically compared the participants'drawings to the original picture and\nquantified the drawing's matching error (e.g. Carson et al., 2012; Chamberlain & McManus, 2013;\nHayes & Milne, 2011). In addition, we conducted a large-scale, on-line experiment where drawings\nwere pair-wise compared by participants and then ranked using an ELO ranking algorithm (Elo, 1978).\nBoth measurements were consistent and in the main experiments we used the objective measure where\nthe criteria for accuracy are explicit.\nIn the first experiment (Experiment 1a), we found a significant relationship between objectively\nmeasured drawing error and the presentation duration needed by our participants to accurately cat-\negorise an object as structurally possible or impossible. Specifically, the regression result indicated\nthat the most skilled participants reached threshold performance with presentation durations three to\nfive times shorter than the threshold durations for the least skilled. However, the size of the stimulus\n(8\u00b0 vs. 28\u00b0) did not affect this difference between skilled and unskilled participants. We also ran an\nadditional control experiment using the exact same experimental conditions but using a lexical deci-\nsion task instead of an object decision task. This control assessed whether the performance advantage\nof the more skilled participants was specific to the object structure discrimination or whether they\nwere related to more general cognitive abilities that affected all tasks including drawing and the object\nstructure task. However, no significant relationships between drawing skill and performance were\nfound in the lexical-decision task (Experiment 1b). So, drawing accuracy appears be related to a more\nefficient processing of object structure on a single glance. In contrast, more skilled participants were\nnot any better at processing larger stimuli than those who were less skilled suggesting that they had no\nadvantage in terms of visual span (Rayner, 1998).\nIn the second experiment, we found a significant relationship between drawing error and the object\nsize needed to correctly identify its structure as possible or impossible. The regression results showed\nthat the most skilled participants reached threshold performance for stimuli that were two to three\ntimes smaller than the threshold size for the least skilled. The test objects were presented at different\nlocations in the near periphery (3\u00b0 and 8\u00b0) so one explanation of the advantage for the participants\nwith better drawing skills was that they had better visual acuity--they might simply be able to see the\nstimuli more clearly. To test this, we conducted a Landolt's C task at the same tested eccentricities\nand found no differences related to drawing skill, ruling out acuity as an explanation. In the absence\nof differences in visual acuity, a possible explanation of the better performances of our skilled par-\nticipants with smaller images may be that they were able to individuate features present within small\nlocal structures. This finding suggests a relationship between drawing skill and attentional resolution\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding object structure 115\nIn summary, our results showed that the more skilled participants were notably faster at\nprocessing object structure at a single glance and were able to accurately classify test stimuli\nat much smaller sizes. The advantage in speed was independent of the size of the object and the\nadvantage in size was independent of the eccentricity. This strongly suggests that drawing accu-\nracy may be related to a more efficient encoding and representation of structural information that\ncan be captured during a single fixation, regardless of the viewing condition (either in central or\nperipheral vision).\n7.1Drawing accuracy and possible/impossible object discrimination\nBefore considering how the processing of object structure differs between participants who are skilled at\ndrawing and those who are not, we first consider what the possible versus impossible task tells us about\nthe processing of object structure. Most of the studies using the impossible/possible object-decision\ntest investigated object representation in long-term memory (e.g. Schacter et al., 1990; Schacter et al.,\n1991; Soldan et al., 2009), and only a few of them have considered the perceptual aspects underlying\nhave valid object properties (e.g. closed contours, volume and edges) despite their inherent structural\nviolations. This may explain why possible and impossible objects share the same early perceptual\nprocesses with possible objects (Freud, Ganel, et al., 2013), as well as why impossible objects can be\nprocessed holistically to the same extent as structurally valid objects (Freud, Avidan, et al., 2013), and\ncan be perceived as valid objects (Cowie & Perrott, 1993; Williams & Tarr, 1997). However, discrimi-\nnating possible from impossible structures takes much more time than discriminating object categories\n(e.g., animal vs. vehicle) or identities (e.g., spoon vs. fork). For example, our participants needed\nalmost 1,000 ms on average to accurately discriminate an impossible from a possible object, whereas\nobjects or scenes can sometimes be classified in less than 100 ms (Bacon-Mac\u00e9 et al., 2005; Greene\n& Oliva, 2009; Thorpe, Fize, & Marlot, 1996). Such a difference may mean that possible/impossible\nobject discrimination is not based on the entry-level object \"gist,\" but rather on a scrutiny of its parts\nand on a serial verification of the consistency between these parts and the object's global structure\n(Donnelly et al., 1999; Soldan et al., 2009). These verification processes undoubtedly require more\nextensive and higher level processing (Hochstein & Ahissar, 2002). There are undoubtedly several\nfactors that would contribute to the duration of these serial verifications: for example, the number of\nlocations covertly sampled, the time spent to analyze the features at each location and the time needed\nto move from one location to the next.\nIn line with this hypothesis of serial inspection and verification and consistent with previous find-\nings (Donnelly et al., 1999), we found that all participants needed longer durations for an object that\ncovered a larger extent of space (Experiment 1a). Since fixation was maintained throughout, we might\nexpect that object size would not affect the number of locations visited and scrutinised by attention\n(e.g. Treisman & Gelade, 1980) nor the analysis of the features at each location. The effect of size\nmight arise from the longer time required to move attention from one location in the object to the next\net al., 1988). The speed advantage of the participants who are skilled at drawing (Experiment 1a) may\narise from better performance on any or all of the three factors we mentioned: they may be able to\nconstruct the object structure based on covertly sampling fewer locations; they may spend less time\nprocessing the information from each location and they may be able to move attention more quickly\nfrom one location to the next. However, our experiment was not designed to distinguish the separate\neffects of these three factors and further research will be needed to address this issue. Nevertheless, we\nwere able to show in the second experiment, that more skilled participants could access and analyze\nmore closely spaced details than could the less skilled participants.\n7.2Relating drawing accuracy to the observed performances\nOur results here are specific to object analyses performed at a single glance, so we must ask, among\nthe visual processes that would become more developed in artists and those skilled at drawing, which\nof these would be specific to analysis completed without eye movements.\nLet us start by roughly outlining the stages of making a drawing. First, an internal representation\nof the original object must be constructed, shifting back and forth between local and global levels, to\nselect and analyze local features in the context of their location within the object (Chamberlain et al.,\n2013; Kozbelt, Seidel, ElBassiouny, Mark, & Owen, 2010). On first glance, it is this stage that appears\nmost relevant to our possible versus impossible objects task although typically, this stage would\ninvolve many eye movements across the original image to build its representation. The drawing then\nrequires a selection of local elements to draw (Kozbelt et al., 2010; Tchalenko, 2009), adding them\nto the already drawn depiction, maintaining spatial relations. This selection and verification of local\nelements depends on understanding of the global structure and the relation of the selected element to\nthat structure. If the original is in view, frequent eye movements are made back and forth between the\noriginal and the drawing in progress (Tchalenko & Miall, 2009; Tchalenko, 2009) to check details in\nthe original and guide the new additions. If the original is not in view, then the back and forth inspec-\ntion and drawing is based on the memory representation of the original. In either case, there is again\na dependence on a robust internal representation of the object's structure and a requirement to access\nindividual local elements to see if they correspond properly to the expected spatial relations.\nMuch of this effort involves back and forth eye movements with sampling of information from\nlocal regions and integration and comparison of this information with the internal model of the object's\nglobal structure. Several previous articles have looked at the link between drawing and visual tasks\nwhere eye movements are allowed (e.g. Glazek, 2012; Mitchell et al., 2005; Perdreau & Cavanagh,\n2013b) and integration across fixations plays a role. For example, our previous study (Perdreau &\nCavanagh, 2013b) focused on the same possible versus impossible visual task with free eye move-\nments but restricting the amount of the test object that could be seen around fixation. The results\nshowed that participants who were skilled in drawing could perform accurately with smaller sam-\nples of foveal information. This suggests that drawing accuracy may relate to a more robust internal\nrepresentation with local features better integrated into more complex chunks.\nWhat is different when eye movements are not allowed, when the analysis must take place in a sin-\ngle fixation? Clearly, rather than integrating samples acquired foveally from one fixation to the next,\nparticipants must integrate the information encoded at different eccentricities by moving attention\nover different locations of interest. We again find that participants skilled in drawing are better at this.\nThe same factors should contribute to good performance here: more robust internal representation,\nmore efficient coding and better integration of local features. The continued superiority of skilled par-\nticipants with or without eye movements suggests that the management of eye movements and reten-\ntion of information across fixations is not the critical factor in their advantage. Nor is the difference\nbetween foveally acquired local features and peripherally acquired features. The skilled participants\nappear to be better wherever they acquire object features. They also have an additional advantage for\nclosely spaced features, possibly based on better attentional resolution (He et al., 1996, 1997) that\nallows them to access closely spaced details that are crowded for less skilled.\nWe conclude that those skilled at drawing are able to construct better internal representations of\nobjects in less time and are better able to access details despite local clutter from adjacent features.\nThese processes are critical in the rapid analysis of images when producing drawings and the long\nexperience of relying on these processes for making drawings may have altered these core visual and\nmemory processes. Of course, it is also possible that those who are skilled at drawing have those skills\nbecause these processes were already more developed. We cannot resolve this question of causality\nwithout a longitudinal study following, say, art students across their years of training. Our previous\nstudy of the impossible versus possible objects task did find a relation between years of drawing expe-\nrience and performance that suggested that experience was a causal factor, but it was not a longitudinal\nstudy of the same participants across their training so it was not conclusive.\nIn contrast to these factors that do seem to link drawing to performance in this possible versus\nimpossible object task, we found no evidence for additional advantages for skilled participants in\nprocessing more peripheral information. Drawing accuracy was not related to any increase in per-\nformance over larger visual spans (8\u00b0 vs. 28\u00b0, Experiment 1a) nor to improved processing at larger\neccentricities (3\u00b0 vs. 8\u00b0, Experiment 2a). This result is consistent with the absence of a relationship\nbetween drawing accuracy and the ability to make structural discrimination based only on peripheral\ninformation in our previous study (Perdreau & Cavanagh, 2013b). It appears that whatever the relation\nbetween drawing skill and visual processes, it does not include advantages in processing information\nfrom the periphery (the advantage that we saw in dealing with crowded details was similar over the\ntwo eccentricities tested). However, it is possible that a difference would have emerged if we had\ntested a larger range of eccentricities.\nTo conclude, our present results suggest that drawing skill is related to improved visual proc-\nesses active in a single glance, including a combination of more robust internal representation, more\nDrawing skill is related to the efficiency of encoding object structure 117\nefficient coding, better integration of local features and better access to closely spaced details. These\nresults indicate that the advantages seen previously in tasks where eye movements were allowed (e.g.\ndifferences in eye movement-related processes, but demonstrate general advantages in processing\nobject structure no matter what the context. Our results here are only correlational, however, so there\nis no evidence of causality. We did not find any evidence for a link between drawing skill and a larger\nvisual span (Rayner, 1998) or a more efficient use of peripheral information. We did find evidence\nsuggesting better attentional resolution (less crowding) for skilled participants and although this\nadvantage only becomes measurable in the periphery (there is no crowding in the fovea), this advan-\ntage did not increase over the range of eccentricities that we tested.\n"
