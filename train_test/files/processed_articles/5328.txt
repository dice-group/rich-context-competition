We tested whether angiotensin\nII receptor blockade improves cerebral and cardiovascular function during hypoglycaemia.\nMethods: Nine patients with type 1 diabetes and high spontaneous RAS activity were included in a double-blind,\nrandomised, cross-over study on the effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonist (candesartan 32 mg) or placebo for one\nweek on cognitive function, cardiovascular parameters, hormonal counter-regulatory response, substrate mobilisation,\nand symptoms during hypoglycaemia induced by two hyperinsulinaemic, hypoglycaemic clamps.\nResults: Compared to placebo, candesartan did neither change performance of the cognitive tests nor the EEG at a plasma\nglucose concentration of 2.6\u00b10.2 mmol/l. During candesartan treatment, the QT interval in the ECG was not affected.\nNo effect of candesartan was observed in the hormonal counter-regulatory responses, in substrate concentrations, or in\nsymptom scores. A 36% reduced glucose infusion rate during hypoglycaemia with candesartan was observed.\nConclusion: In conclusion candesartan has no effect on cerebral function during mild experimental hypoglycaemia in\nsubjects with type 1 diabetes and high RAS activity. Candesartan may reduce glucose utilisation or increase endogenous\nglucose production during hypoglycaemia.\n",

Epidemiological data support this observation by\nshowing a lower rate of severe hypoglycaemia in subjects\nwith type 1 diabetes treated with RAS blockers (ACE inhib-\nitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II (ANG II) subtype 1 receptor\nblockers (ARBs)) compared with subjects treated with other\nantihypertensive agents not influencing RAS.9\nThe mechanism of the association between RAS activity\nand risk of severe hypoglycaemia is not clarified. To main-\ntain self-care during hypoglycaemia and thereby avoid pro-\ngression to severe hypoglycaemia, maintenance of normal\ncognitive function is crucial. We have previously reported\nthat patients with type 1 diabetes and high RAS activity\ndeveloped more pronounced cognitive impairment during\ncontrolled hypoglycaemia than subjects with low activity.10\nA decline in alpha frequency in EEG recordings similar to\nthe shift seen during sleep or pre-coma was also observed\nduring hypoglycaemia in these subjects,10 thus suggesting a\nmechanistic explanation of the association between RAS\nactivity and risk of severe hypoglycaemia. RAS activity\nalso affects heart rate and prolongation of the QT interval\nduring hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes.11\u00ad13 In patients\nwith type 1 diabetes the QT interval was more prolonged in\npatients with high RAS activity than patients with low\nactivity during controlled hypoglycaemia.13 QT prolonga-\ntion is a common finding during hypoglycaemia,11 and may\nbe involved in sudden death from ventricular tachyarrhyth-\nmia, the so-called `dead-in-bed' syndrome.14,15 High RAS\nactivity is implicated in ventricular tachyarrhythmia.16\nreceptor blockade may protect against unintended\ncardiac changes during hypoglycaemia.\nThe present study tested the hypothesis that angioten-\nsin II receptor blockade may have beneficial effects during\nmild hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes by preserving cogni-\ntive function and cardiac repolarisation. Furthermore, the\nimpact on hormonal counter-regulatory responses, substrate\nmobilisation and hypoglycaemic symptoms was explored.\nAn intervention with candesartan was chosen as this drug\npasses the blood brain barrier,18 has effects on the sympa-\nthetic nervous system,19 and is associated with improved\ncognition in ischaemic brain conditions.20\nMethods\nSubjects\nNine subjects with type 1 diabetes were recruited from\nthe outpatient clinics at Nordsj\u00e6llands Hospital \u00ad\nHiller\u00f8d and Steno Diabetes Centre (Figure 1). The\npatients were selected according to high spontaneous\nRAS activity defined as a total score > 8 obtained by\nmeasurements of plasma angiotensinogen concentration\nhighest quartile) and AT2\nreceptor subtype 2 genotype (1\n= GG; 2 = GA; 3 = AA). Furthermore, patients were not\nallowed to take any RAS blocking agents (according to\ntheir medical records). Other inclusion criteria were age\n>18 years, duration of diabetes >5 years and negative\npregnancy test or verified menopause. Exclusion criteria\nwere use of any RAS blocking treatment (according to\nthe patient), antihypertensive treatment or medical treat-\nment interfering with cognitive function, presence of\nsevere late diabetic complications defined as recently\nlaser-treated retinopathy, symptomatic autonomous\nFigure 1. Flow chart of recruitment to the study. Data on RAS activity was obtainable for 451 patients. After excluding patients\nwho were on RAS blocking treatment or centrally acting drugs and patients who suffered from conditions not eligible for\nparticipating in a hypoglycaemic experiment (dementia, heart failure, cancer), 49 patients were eligible to participate in the study.\nThirty-three patients declined to participate, 16 patients came to the information meeting. We excluded four, two because of\nproliferative retinopathy that did not respond well to laser treatment, one because of excessive alcohol consumption and one\nbecause of a too tight schedule with a lot of travelling. Twelve patients were randomised. During the first experimental day one\npatient was excluded because we could not get intravenous access, and two patients had a vasovagal episode.\nneuropathy, reduced kidney function (plasma creatinine\n100 \u00b5mol/l for men and >88 \u00b5mol/l for women), known\nside effects to candesartan, heart failure (NYHA 3-4),\nepilepsy, drug or alcohol abuse, and plasma potassium <\n3.5 mmol/l or >5 mmol/l. Baseline characteristics are\nshown in Table 1.\nDesign\nThe study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-\nover study (Figure 2). Randomisation was done in blocs\nof four patients and placebo and candesartan 32 mg cap-\nsules were manufactured by the Pharmacy of the Capital\nRegion of Denmark. The medicine was blinded, packed\nand sealed in identical containers with the numbers 1\nand 2 on the label. Patients were randomised 8 days\nbefore the first hypoglycaemia experiment. The patients\nwere instructed to take one capsule each evening before\nbedtime for 7 days. The two experimental days were\nseparated by at least 5 weeks, allowing for a wash-out\nweeks). The primary endpoint was effect of candesartan\non cognitive function during hypoglycaemia. Secondary\nendpoints were electroencephalographic changes, cardi-\novascular parameters, hormonal counter-regulatory\nresponse, substrate mobilisation and symptoms during\nhypoglycaemia.\nThe trial was approved by the Regional Ethics\nnot consider the study as an intervention trial, thus it\nshould not be approved as such. The trial was done accord-\ning to the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants\nsigned informed consent before entering the study.\nExperimental protocol\nThe study was conducted according to the Declaration of\nHelsinki and all subjects signed informed consent before\nentering the trial\nEight days before the experimental day\nAt the first visit, demographic and clinical characteristics\n(including beat-to-beat analysis and biothesiometry) and\ndiabetes history were collected, and hypoglycaemia aware-\nness status was classified according to a validated\nmethod.21 Blood pressure and weight were measured both\nat the first and the second visit. The cognitive test battery\nwas trained. Blood was sampled to measure plasma potas-\nsium and creatinine before the treatment initiation.\nFigure 2. Flowchart of the study. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with 32 mg candesartan or\nplacebo. Cycles 1 and 2 were euglycaemic periods and cycles 3 and 4 were hypoglycaemic periods. In cycle 1 and 3, the following\nmeasurements were done: blood samples, symptoms of hypoglycaemia, ECG, EEG, blood pressure, cognitive tests. In cycle 2 and 4,\nthe following measurements were done: symptoms of hypoglycaemia, blood pressure, blood samples and ECG.\nTable 1. Baseline characteristics.

The hypo-\nglycaemia alarm was set at 4.5 mmol/l in order to prevent\na hypoglycaemic event below 3.5 mmol/l. The CGM was\ncalibrated with a blood glucose meter (Contour\u00ae Link,\nBayer Health Care, Leverkusen, Germany) according to\nthe manufacturer's manual. Side effects of treatment were\nreported and the cognitive tests were re-trained. Patients\nwere asked to take the capsules before bedtime to ensure a\nstandardised medication protocol.\nDay of experiment\nSubjects arrived at 7:30 a.m. after an overnight fast. CGM\ndata were downloaded and checked for hypoglycaemic val-\nues <3.5 mmol/l at two consecutive measurements. Patients\nwere asked if they had measured any blood glucose values\n<3.5 mmol/l in the last 12 hours before the experiment.\nNone of the patients had experienced symptomatic hypo-\nglycaemia the night before the experiments. Two patients\nhad an asymptomatic hypoglycaemic alarm and corrected\nper protocol on the alarm (plasma glucose <4.5 mmol/l).\nNone of the patients had experienced plasma glucose levels\n>20 mmol/l during the time they wore the CGM.\nThe patients were placed in a comfortable resting chair\nand were equipped with (1) two intravenous antecubital lines\nfor infusion of insulin and glucose and for blood sampling,\n(2) electroencephalography (EEG) cap, two ear lobe refer-\nences and two precordial ECG leads connected to a digital\nEEG recorder (Cadwell, Kennewick Washington, USA), (3)\ntwelve-lead ECG to monitor heart rate during hypoglycae-\nmia (MAC 5500, GE Healthcare, UK), and (4) an automatic\nblood pressure unit (Microlife AG, Wildnau, Switzerland).\nPatients were introduced to the hypoglycaemia symptom\nscore questionnaire and once more they trained the cognitive\ntests while being clamped to euglycaemia.\nThe experiment was divided into two comparable peri-\nods, a baseline period (cycle 1 and 2) and a hypoglycaemic\nperiod (cycle 3 and 4) (Figure 2(b)). Cycle 1 and 3 con-\nsisted of blood-sampling, hypoglycaemia symptom scor-\ning, ECG, EEG, blood pressure measurements and\ncognitive tests.. Cycle 2 and 4 consisted of hypoglycaemia\nsymptom scoring, blood pressure measurements, blood\nsampling and ECG.\nHyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic\nclamp procedure\nShort acting human insulin (Actrapid\u00ae, Novo Nordisk,\nBagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark) mixed with heparinised plasma from\nthe patient and isotonic saline was infused at a rate of 1.0\nmU \u00d7 kg bodyweight-1 \u00d7 minute-1 with a syringe pump\n(Argus 600S, Argus Medical AG, Heimberg, Switzerland).\nPlasma glucose concentrations were measured throughout\nSprings, USA) and adjusted with a variable infusion of\n20% glucose via an infusion pump (Argus 414, Argus\nMedical AG, Heimberg, Switzerland). The plasma glucose\ntarget was 5\u00ad6 mmol/l for 60 min during the baseline\nmin (Figure 2).\nCognitive function tests\nCalifornia Cognitive Assessment Package\n(CalCAP)\nWorking memory was evaluated by the DanishAbbreviated\nReaction Time test (DART) of CalCAP (E.N. Miller,\nCalifornia Cognitive Assessment Package, Norland\nSoftware, Los Angeles, 1990). DART consists of three dif-\nferent reaction time tasks which run on a computer screen;\nCRT1: a choice reaction task with reaction to number 7;\nSRT1: a choice reaction task with reaction to two identical\none-figure numbers in a sequence; and SRT2: a choice\nreaction task with reaction to a pair of one-figure numbers\nin ascending order (e.g. 1\u00ad2 or 5\u00ad6). The software calcu-\nlates the individual mean reaction times and number of\nerrors for each test.\nStroop's test\nStroop's test measures selective attention and cognitive\nflexibility.22 The test consists of three pages, each with 100\nitems divided in 5 columns. On the first page the words\nyellow, blue and red are typed randomly in black; the sub-\nject must read aloud the words. On the second page the\nsame colours are printed as \"XXXX\" and arranged ran-\ndomly; the subject must read aloud the colours of the X's.\nOn the last page the ink colour is different from the typed\ncolour and the subjects must read aloud the ink colour. The\nnumber of items completed in 45 sec on each page is used\nfor test evaluation.\nTrail-making test\nThe trail-making test measures visual scanning, attention,\nconcentration speed of eye-hand coordination and infor-\nmation processing.23 Trail 5 was assessed in which sub-\njects must connect circled numbers and letters in alternating\nsequences (e.g. 1-A-2-B-3-C....13). The time used to\ncomplete the test is measured.\nNeurophysiological tests\nElectroencephalography\nEEG was recorded using Cadwell standard EEG recording\nsystem and silver\u00adsilver chloride electrocaps with the 19\nstandard positions of the international 10\u00ad20 system using\nlinked earlobe references. EEG was obtained in a 5-min\nresting period during each glycaemic period. Patients were\nasked to stay awake with their eyes closed during the record-\nings. Eight patients underwent EEG recordings on both\nexperimental days, and they were included in the analysis.\nData were exported to edf-format in the recording mon-\ntage and analysed in Matlab (Matrix Laboratory (http://\nwww.mathworks.se/products/matlab/?s_cid). Data were\nfiltered with an eighth order Butterworth filter with a low-\ncut of 0.5 Hz and a high-cut of 32 HZ. The two prefrontal\nelectrodes were associated with artefacts in several patients\nand discarded in the process. Thus the following electrodes\nfree periods of at least 5 s duration were identified. The\nmean centroid frequency (5\u00ad11 Hz) was used in the calcu-\nlations and further five different groups were created to\nevaluate the effect on the different areas of the brain. Thus\ngroup F (the frontal cortex (F3, FZ, F4)), group C (the cor-\ntex of the central sulcus (C3, CZ, C4)), group T (the tem-\nporal cortex (F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8)), group P (the parietal\ncortex (P3, PZ, P4)) and group O (occipital cortex (O1,\nO2)) were created.\nCardiovascular parameters\nECG was measured using a MAC 5500 and saved elec-\ntronically. Heart rate was calculated from the ECG. QT\nintervals were calculated from five 12-lead ECG record-\nings of 10 sec duration in each cycle (c1\u00adc4; Figure 2).\nSemiautomatic QT analysis was performed by a trained\nelectro physiologist blinded to the treatment. The QT inter-\nval was corrected for differences in heart rate (HR) accord-\ning to Bazett's (QTcb\n= QT / RR1/2) and Fridericia's\nformulas (QTcf\nHypoglycaemic symptom scoring\nAn extended version of the Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia\nScale including dummy questions was used to assess\nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia.24 Symptoms are divided into\nautonomic symptoms (sweating, trembling and warm-\nness), neuroglycopenic symptoms (drowsiness, tiredness,\nhunger and weakness) and cognitive dysfunction (inability\nto concentrate, blurred vision, anxiety, confusion, diffi-\nculty in speaking and double vision). The highest scores\npossible are 21 (autonomic symptoms), 28 (neuroglyco-\npenic symptoms) and 42 (cognitive dysfunction). The sub-\nject rates the symptoms on a Likert scale from 1 to 7,\nwhere 1 indicates that the symptom is absent while 7 indi-\ncates that the symptom is at its maximum intensity.24\nLaboratory analysis\nPlasma glucagon concentrations were measured with a\nradioimmunoassay directed against the C-terminus of the\nglucagon molecule (antibody core no. 4305), which mainly\nmeasures glucagon of pancreatic origin.25 Catecholamines\nwere measured in blood drawn in chilled tubes which was\npre-added a mixture of EGTA, glutathione and NaOH to\nprevent catecholamine degradation. Levels of catechola-\nmines were determined with a commercial ELISA kit (BA\nE-5100, Labor Diagnostika Nord GmbH and Co, Nordhorn,\nGermany). Serum growth hormone concentrations were\ndetermined with a commercial fluorometric method\n(Delfia, Wallac, Finland) using two monoclonal antibodies\nagainst two separate antigenic determinants on the growth\nhormone molecule. Concentrations of free fatty acids,\nglycerol, ketones and lactate were determined by spec-\ntrometry (Roche Hitachi 912 Chemistry Analyzer, Roche,\nGlostrup, Denmark). Cortisol, C-peptide and electrolytes\nwere measured with routine methods. All other samples\nwere centrifuged and stored immediately at -80 \u00baC to be\nanalysed after completion of the study.\nPower calculation and statistics\nThe pre-study power calculation with a minimal relevant\ndifference (MIREDIF) = 50 ms for mean reaction time\nprolongation (CalCAP, SRT2) and SD = 80 ms (10) and\ntype 1 and type 2 error risks of 5% and 20%, respectively,\nshowed that 20 patients should be included. Unfortunately\nit was not feasible to obtain that number of participants\ndue to our rather strict in- and exclusion criteria (Figure 1).\nAll calculations were done with SPSS software package\n19. Initially all variables were tested for normality visu-\nally and using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. When\ncomparing the euglycaemic and hypoglycaemic period,\nnon-parametric analyses were used when data were not\nnormally distributed. For the ANCOVA data were ln-trans-\nformed and back-transformed after analysis. In case nor-\nmality could not be obtained anANCOVAwas not possible\nand Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used instead of paired\nsamples t-test. Euglycaemic values were compared with\nhypoglycaemic values using a paired t-test in order to eval-\nuate whether the endpoint changed from baseline during\nhypoglycaemia. A mixed linear model ANCOVA was used\nto investigate the impact of candesartan on the endpoints.\nAnalyses were done for each endpoint separately. Baseline\nvalues were included in the analysis as a covariate and\nfixed factor. Plasma glucose concentration at the time of\nthe cognitive test or symptom scoring was included as\ncovariate and fixed factor. Treatment was included as fixed\nfactor and patient number was random factor. The analysis\nof counter-regulatory hormones and substrates were based\non peak values during hypoglycaemia and mean values\nduring euglycaemia.\nPlasma glucose levels during hypoglycaemia on the\ntwo days of experiments were compared using a paired\nt-test. Calculations regarding cognitive function, EEG and\nECG were done blinded to the intervention. A p < 0.05\n(two-sided) was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nPlasma glucose and glucose infusion rate\nThe mean plasma glucose (\u00b1SD) during euglycaemia was\nduring hypoglycaemia on both experimental days (p =\n0.96; Figure 3).

Similar results were obtained\nfor the placebo-corrected delta-values.

No\neffect of candesartan was observed for any measurements.\nAn efficient response to hypoglycaemia in terms of hypo-\nglycaemic symptoms was observed on both experimental\ndays and there were no effect of candesartan. (See\nSupplementary tables 1\u00ad2 online).\nDiscussion\nTreatment with 32 mg candesartan daily for 7 days did not\naffect the measured protective responses to hypoglycae-\nmia during a hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp\nprocedure. Thus, hypoglycaemic changes in cognitive\nfunction, cardiac repolarisation and other endpoints did\nnot differ between candesartan and placebo. The only dif-\nference between the treatments was a 36% reduced glu-\ncose infusion rate during hypoglycaemia with candesartan,\nsuggestive of either increased endogenous glucose produc-\ntion or reduced glucose consumption.\nThe negative result concerning cognition contrasts pre-\nvious studies in patients with type 1 diabetes and healthy\nsubjects with high spontaneous RAS activity.10,26 In these\nsubjects cognitive function deteriorated significantly\n(CalCAP test) during hypoglycaemia compared to subjects\nwith low RAS activity. Both these studies obtained a plasma\nglucose level during hypoglycaemia similar to that in the\npresent study, but since they did not use a clamp approach\nthere was no glucose infusion during hypoglycaemia. It is\ntherefore possible that a potential effect of candesartan in\nthis study is masked by the higher glucose infusion rate in\nthe placebo arm. Another potential explanation for the dif-\nference between the studies is that the subjects with low\nspontaneous RAS activity had the G-allele of the angioten-\nsin II receptor subtype 2 that confers high expression of the\nreceptor, while the participants in this study had theA-allele\nthat confers low receptor expression. The candesartan\nblockade blocks only the subtype 1 receptor, but does prob-\nably increase subtype 2 activity.\nThe QT intervals increased in both treatment arms in\nresponse to hypoglycaemia in accordance with previous\nfindings in patients with high spontaneous RAS\nWe did not observe any effect of candesartan on coun-\nter-regulatory hormone or substrate responses to hypogly-\ncaemia. This is in contrast to a study of healthy men treated\nwith losartan,27 which reported an attenuated adrenaline\nresponse to hypoglycaemia in the treatment arm compared\nto placebo and in line with a study of healthy men treated\nwith captopril andACE inhibitor reporting no difference in\nsymptoms and counter-regulation.28 The symptom scores\nwere not affected by candesartan treatment. A study com-\nparing losartan (an ARB) and placebo during mild hypo-\nglycaemia in healthy men indicated that ARB treatment\nattenuates hypoglycaemic symptoms and adrenaline\nresponse,27 thus contrasting our previous findings.28 The\nhormonal counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia\nis, however, different in healthy people and patients with\ntype 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes the glucagon response is\nblunted or absent after a few years of diabetes.29 After a\ndecade with type 1 diabetes the adrenaline response is also\nblunted in some patients leaving them with weakened\nautonomic symptoms and the slower responding cortisol\nand growth hormone secretion as the salvage of hypogly-\ncaemia.29 The hormonal counter-regulatory response is\nalso blunted in response to recurrent hypoglycaemia.30\nTherefore it is not possible to extrapolate data on the hor-\nmonal counter-regulatory response in healthy people to\npatients with type 1 diabetes.\nTable 4. Cardiovascular parameters were calculated from the ECG and by an automatic blood pressure unit. Heart rate and QTc\nintervals were calculated from five 12-lead ECG recordings of 10 sec duration in each cycle (c1\u00adc4; Figure 2(b)). The QT interval\nwas corrected for differences in heart rate (HR) according to Bazett's (QTcb\n= QT / RR1/2) and Fridericia's formulas (QTcf\n= QT /\nRR1/3). Analysis is carried out as in Table 3.

The cogni-\ntive tests were trained twice at every visit prior to the\nexperimental day \u00adfour times in total \u00ad in order to mini-\nmise a possible learning effect.\nThe main limitation of the study is the number of sub-\njects included. According to the pre-study power calcula-\ntion 20 patients should be included to obtain the calculated\ndifference. Only nine subjects were included mainly due to\nstrict in- and exclusion criteria. Another limitation of the\nstudy may be that the patients were not effectively RAS\nblocked at the time of the hypoglycaemic phase. We took\nthis into account by choosing candesartan that \u00ad even\nthough the plasma half-life is 9\u00ad12 hours \u00ad has a blood\npressure lowering effect of more than 24 hours as a meas-\nure of the blocking effect on the receptors. In the present\nstudy candesartan had an antihypertensive effect during\neuglycaemia, suggesting adequate RAS blockade at the\ntime of the experiment.\nIn conclusion, RAS blockade with candesartan had no\neffects on cognitive function or other responses to hypo-\nglycaemia, but resulted in a diminished need for glucose\nsupply during hypoglycaemia. The reason for the lower\nGIR during hypoglycaemia in the candesartan arm is spec-\nulative but could be associated with the adrenaline response\nobserved on the candesartan day but not on the placebo\nday. This was, however not mimicked in the glucagon\nresponse being only numerically higher during hypogly-\ncaemia on the candesartan day. The mechanism of high\nspontaneous RAS activity on deteriorated cognitive func-\ntion during hypoglycaemia is thus not clarified by this\nstudy using AT1\nreceptor inhibition. Studies of the effect of\nARBs or ACE inhibitors on endogenous glucose metabo-\nlism during hypoglycaemia are warranted to further\nexplore their potential in minimising severe hypoglycae-\nmic events in patients with type 1 diabetes.\nNovelty statement\nRAS blockade with candesartan has no effect on:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Cognitive function\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Counter-regulatory hormones\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Symptoms of hypoglycaemia\nBut the glucose infusion rate is 36% lower during hypo-\nglycaemia on the candesartan day than on the placebo day.\n"
