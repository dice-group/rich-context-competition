    "abstract": "Abstract: To meet its goal of universal health insurance coverage, the Clinton health plan requires\nall employers to offer health insurance to their employees. Using survey data on more than 2,200\nsmall businesses, we estimate how many firms and employees would be affected by this mandate and\ncalculate the financial burden, adjusting for the small-business subsidies recommended in the Clinton\nplan. Because of the payroll caps, almost 60 percent of small businesses that now offer insurance will\nexperience a reduction in premiums. The average reduction is approximately $1,500 per full-time\nequivalent (FTE) per year. The majority of firms that offer insurance and face an increase in liability\nunder the Clinton plan will incur an increase of less than $1,000 per FTE per year. Firms that do not\nnow offer insurance will incur, on average, a liability of $500 to $900 per FTE.\nAprimary reason for the relatively low level of health insurance\ncoverage among small-business employees is a lack of affordable\ninsurance products.1 Some workers and businesses also face struc-\ntural barriers, such as redlining (eliminating entire business categories from\ncoverage), and attitudinal barriers, on the part of both employees who do\nnot want to trade wages for health insurance and employers who do not want\nto make health insurance coverage available to their employees.2\nVarious health care reform proposals have included measures aimed at\nreducing small businesses' financial and structural barriers to health insur-\nance. The Clinton health reform proposal, for instance, has a goal of\nuniversal health insurance coverage. To reach this goal, the proposal would\nrequire all employers to offer health insurance to their employees and to\nshare the premium payment. Other federal health care reform proposals and\nlegislative efforts in several states range from replacing employment-based\nhealth insurance with individual insurance to encouraging the voluntary\nformation of small-business purchasing pools.3 Most of these proposals\ninclude some modification, if not outright elimination, of underwriting\npractices that exclude individuals or businesses.\nThere has been considerable debate about the effect of the Clinton\nmandate on the small-business community and disagreement about\nCatherine McLaughlin is associate professor, Wendy Zellers is senior research associate, and Kevin\nFrick is research assistant in the Department of Health Services Management and Policy at the\nUniversity of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We asked more than 2,200\nsmall businesses in seven sites about characteristics of the firms, including\ninformation about their health insurance coverage, the wages and insur-\nance coverage of workers, and attitudes toward various policy options. For\nthe purposes of this survey, small businesses were defined as those with\ntwenty-five or fewer employees working more than seventeen hours per\nweek. The sampling frame came from Dun and Bradstreet's DMI (Dun's\nMarketing Inclusion). Self-employed persons were omitted from the sam-\nple. We contacted 2,759 eligible firms and completed interviews with\n2,241, resulting in an overall response rate of 81 percent, which is substan-\ntially higher than in most surveys of small businesses. The seven sites were\nCleveland, Denver, Flint, Pittsburgh, Portland, Tampa, and Tucson. The\nUsing these data, we estimate how many small businesses and employees in\nthese seven locations would be affected by a mandate, the percentage that\nwould be eligible for the subsidy, and how many would experience an\nincrease in or reduction of liability. We also report the results of local efforts\nin some of these cities to increase coverage without mandates.\nThe Effects Of The Clinton Mandate\nCoverage. Our results indicate that 50-65 percent of businesses with\nfewer than twenty-five employees now offer health insurance. The level of\ncoverage increases with firm size, even within this group of small businesses\n(Exhibit 1). Under the Clinton plan, one-third to half of these small\nbusinesses will be required to begin offering insurance to their employees.\nBusinesses that already offer insurance also will be affected by this man-\ndate. According to our survey, approximately 8 percent of full-time workers\nare not eligible for their firm's health insurance plan, and another 24\nPercentage Of Finns That Offer Health Insurance, By City And Size Of Firm, 1993\nCity\nCleveland\nDenver\nFlint\nPittsburgh\nPortland\nTampa\nTucson\nNumber of workers\nSource: Small Business Benefit Survey, 1993.\nNote: Firm size categories calculated based on the number of persons working seventeen hours or more.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The level of\neligibility and the overall participation rate is lower for part-time workers.\nHalf of the part-time workers who work more than seventeen hours a week\nare not eligible for their company's plan.4 Approximately one-fourth of\nthose part-time workers who are eligible choose not to participate. The\ndefinition of who is eligible sometimes reflects insurance company under-\nwriting policies and sometimes employer preferences. The decision to par-\nticipate is influenced by several factors. Affordability is clearly an issue. In\nsome of these cities workers who do participate in their firm's plan earn, on\naverage, 50 percent more than workers who do not participate. Availability\nof family coverage through a spouse's employer also plays an important role.\nApproximately one-fourth of workers working seventeen or more hours\nin firms that offer health insurance have coverage only through another\nsource. More than half of the workers employed by firms that do not offer\nhealth insurance are reported to have coverage through another source.\nUnder the Clinton plan these \"free riders\" will no longer be able to shift the\ncost of health insurance coverage to their spouse's employer.5\nIn some cities fewer than half of full-time workers participate in employ-\nment-based health insurance plans. Including part-time employees working\nmore than seventeen hours a week reduces the level of coverage to below\n50 percent in all but one city (Exhibit 2). Requiring employers to cover all\nemployees working more than ten hours a week represents a dramatic\nincrease in liability. At the same time, altering the source of coverage for\nthe 17 to 37 percent who receive their only coverage through their spouse's\nemployment-based insurance will shift liability away from other employers.\nPercentage Of Employees With And Without Employment-Based Insurance, 1993\nSource: Small Business Benefit Survey, 1993.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The Clinton mandate would shift the coverage\nnow received by more than 18,000 workers from another source to their\nplace of employment and add an additional 16,000 workers who now lack\nhealth insurance. In Portland, where small businesses are more likely not\nonly to offer health insurance to their workers but also to have a higher\npercentage of those workers eligible and enrolled, the redistribution effect\nwould be smaller: Approximately 72,000 workers now receive employment-\nbased health insurance (56 percent), 26,000 are covered through another\nWinners and losers\u00bb The Clinton proposal couples the mandate with a\npremium payment cap of 7.9 percent of total payroll for all firms. In\naddition, it recommends subsidies to low-wage businesses with fewer than\nseventy-five FTE employees in the form of reduced payment caps. The\nmaximum liability for a firm with fewer than twenty-five FTE employees\nwhose average annual salary per employee is less than or equal to $12,000 is\n3.5 percent of total payroll. This liability gradually increases to 7.9 percent\nof total payroll as the average annual salary rises above $24,000.\nAccording to our survey results, approximately 80 percent of businesses\nwith fewer than twenty-five employees have an average annual salary per\nFTE employee of less than $24,000 and therefore will be eligible for this\nsubsidy (Exhibit 3). In a city the size of Denver, this translates into almost\n30,000 firms.6 This high degree of eligibility reflects, to a large degree, the\nrelatively low wages of workers in the small-business community. Close to\n40 percent of firms that do not offer insurance have an average annual\nsalary per FTE employee of less than or equal to $12,000; only 6 percent of\nthese firms have an average annual salary of more than $24,000. Not\nsurprisingly, the distribution of firms that offer health insurance is different.\nAlthough the majority (more than 70 percent) have an average annual\nDistribution Of Firms By Average Full-Time-Equivalent (FTE) Annual Salary\nFirms that offer\ninsurance\nWinners\nLosers\nFirms that do not\noffer insurance\nLess than\nMore than\nSource: Small Business Benefit Survey, 1993.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In\nPittsburgh, which has the highest percentage of winners and whose firms\nwould experience relatively large gains, almost 9,000 businesses with fewer\nthan twenty-five workers face a reduction in their liability for health\ninsurance under this subsidized plan. Again, adding firms with up to\nseventy-five FTEs, as is proposed in the Clinton plan, would increase the\nnumber of winners. Given that firms with twenty-five to seventy-five FTEs\nare more likely to offer insurance, we anticipate that a higher percentage\nwould see a reduction in liability under this plan.\nemployee per year (Exhibit 5). These numbers represent the minimum win\npossible for each firm. In some cases, the actual liability may be lower\nbecause of workers' characteristics and the type of coverage offered, and the\nsize of the win could be higher.7 Our findings suggest that winners are more\nlikely to be companies that insure most of their workers, that already pay at\nleast 80 percent of the premium for individual coverage (three-fourths of\nthese firms pay 100 percent) and at least part of dependent coverage, and\nthat offer a relatively rich set of benefits. Additionally, because of current\nunderwriting practices, firms engaged in actuarially high-risk businesses are\nlikely to be winners because of premiums that are high relative to the\ncommunity-rated premiums estimated in the Clinton plan.\nAs an illustration, one of the winners in our sample is a logging company\nin Portland with fourteen employees who each earn, on average, slightly\nits health insurance plan, which has no copayments for inpatient hospital\nPercentage Of Firms Offering Insurance That Are Winners, And Percentage\nOf Workers Covered, By Win-Loss Status, 1993\nCity\nCleveland\nDenver\nFlint\nPittsburgh\nPortland\nTampa\nTucson\nPercent\nwinners\nAverage percentage\nWinners\nof employees covered\nLosers\nSource: Small Business Benefit Survey, 1993.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Under the Clinton plan, the company's\nClearly, all firms that do not now offer health insurance will be \"losers\"\nunder the Clinton mandate; that is, they will have to pay for health\ninsurance. The size of their loss will vary, however, depending on the\naverage annual salary of their workers and the total payroll. We estimate\nthat the average maximum loss--in these cases, maximum total liability--\nwill be less than $350 per FTE employee per year for those firms with an\naverage annual salary of less than $12,000 per FTE employee (Exhibit 6).\nThere was little variation in this estimate across the seven sites. Depending\non the characteristics of its workers, a firm's actual loss may be lower\nbecause of the various \"rules\" regarding payment for part-time workers with\nmultiple jobs, employed spouses, and so forth. The average loss increases to\nalmost $600 per FTE employee for firms with an average annual salary of\nemployee for the higher-wage firms.\nOf small businesses that do offer health insurance, 28 to 55 percent likely\nwould pay more in total premium payments under President Clinton's plan.\nAs was the case for firms that do not offer insurance, the average size of the\nmaximum loss for the lower-wage firms, those whose average annual salary\nployee per year.

The variation in the size of the loss across different sites reflects\ndifferent compositions of firms by wage category as well as different concen-\ntrations of firm characteristics that determine whether or not the firm\nwould experience a loss.\nThere are several reasons why a firm that now offers health insurance\nwould face an increase in premium payments. One of the main reasons is\nthe increase in the percentage of workers participating. In several of our\nsites workers in these firms were half as likely to have employment-based\ninsurance as workers in firms that would be winners under the plan. Even\nwith a payment cap of 3.5 percent of payroll, approximately one out of five\nfirms that already offer insurance, with an average annual salary of less than\n$12,000 per FTE employee, would experience an increase in liability. On\naverage, these firms have fewer than 10 percent of employees who work\nmore than seventeen hours a week enrolled in their plans.\nAnother reason for the increase is the 80 percent employer share pro-\nposed, which represents a substantial increase for many of these firms. This\nis particularly true in Tucson, where almost 60 percent of these firms now\npay less than 80 percent of their workers' premiums. In addition, firms that\nwill experience an increase are less likely to be paying any dependent\ncoverage now. Finally, the payroll cap set by the plan may represent an\nincrease in premiums, perhaps because of an increase in the number of\nemployees with dependent coverage, or perhaps because of a richer benefit\npackage.\nLabor market. Many critics of the Clinton plan are concerned that the\nincrease in labor costs associated with mandatory health insurance will\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

While there is some variation across\nsites, approximately 60 percent of the employees in our sample work in\nfirms that would be losers under this plan, which translates into more than\n400,000 workers in these seven sites. On average, these workers are evenly\nsplit between firms that already offer insurance but would face an increased\nliability and firms that do not now offer insurance.\nWhile $350 per FTE employee should neither pose a serious burden nor\nresult in a significant increase in unemployment, some small businesses face\nconsiderably larger losses. Not surprisingly, the size of the loss increases as\nthe average annual salary per FTE employee increases. On average, higher-\nwage firms that do not now offer insurance would experience a loss closer to\n$2,000 per FTE worker; the loss faced by higher-wage firms that do offer\nWages. Although historically wages have been \"sticky downward\"--that\nis, slow to fall in response to market forces--we would expect employers to\ntransfer this increase in liability for health insurance onto the employees in\nthe form of lower wages where possible as soon as possible.8 Because of the\nnotch effect inherent in any graduated subsidy system such as this, some\nfirms that negotiate lower wages with some or all of their employees will not\nonly maintain the same total compensation package as before the mandate\nbut will also experience a decrease in total liability because of both a lower\ntotal payroll and a lower premium cap.\nResponse of small businesses. This survey was conducted before the\nrelease of the Clinton administration's plan, and therefore we did not ask\nthe firms how they would respond to the specific mandate proposed. We did\nask them how they would respond to a play-or-pay health insurance man-\ndate, wherein employers pay for their workers' coverage or face a tax to do\nso. Consistently across all seven sites, approximately one-third of those that\ndo not now offer health insurance said that they would decrease their\nnumber of workers; a third said that they would decrease wages or other\nbenefits; and more than half said that they would increase the price of their\ngoods or services.9 It is intriguing that one-third of the firms plan to increase\nprices but not decrease wages or the number of workers. Only under very\nrestrictive circumstances could firms pass on the entire increase in labor\ncosts to the consumer in the form of higher prices.\nThe Impact Of Voluntary Efforts\nSmall-business health insurance pools.

When asked whether\nhaving such a pool would influence their decision to offer health insurance,\n62 to 83 percent of small businesses that have not offered health insurance\nin the past five years said yes. Two of our sites have such pools; these areas\nprovide some insight into pools' influence on the market.\nThe Council of Smaller Enterprises (COSE) in Cleveland is often held\nup as an example. COSE is one of four divisions within the Greater\nCleveland Area Growth Association, the area's Chamber of Commerce.\nOnly members of the Growth Association are eligible to belong to COSE.\nCOSE now offers thirteen different health insurance plans to its members,\nthrough Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio and Kaiser Permanente. By its\nown account, COSE engages in heavy underwriting.\nAccording to our survey, almost one-fourth of the small businesses in\nCleveland are enrolled in a COSE plan; approximately 40 percent of the\nsmall businesses that offer insurance in Cleveland offer a COSE plan.\nWhile we were not able to isolate the effect of COSE on the small-business\nhealth insurance market, we did find that only a slightly larger percentage\nof small businesses in Cleveland offer health insurance than in Pittsburgh,\na city of similar size and business composition (65 percent versus 59 per-\ncent) and that small businesses in Portland were equally likely to offer\nhealth insurance without the existence of a pool such as COSE. The small\nimpact is not due to lack of information about COSE. Almost 85 percent of\nthose firms that do not offer insurance claimed that they had heard of\nCOSE. About one-fifth of those surveyed who had heard of COSE but who\ndo not offer health insurance said that the poor health of one or more\nemployees was a reason why they do not offer health insurance. Just as in all\nof our sites, however, the dominant reason given by these firms for not\noffering insurance was cost. Slightly more than 60 percent said that the\nexistence of a pool that resulted in lower premiums would influence their\ndecision to offer health insurance. Clearly, many of these firms did not\nthink that the reduction in premiums achieved by COSE was enough.\nTampa is the home of a voluntary small-business insurance pool called\nthe Florida Health Access Corporation (FHAC) that offers a subsidized\nhealth insurance plan. The state subsidizes this plan by providing a subsidy\nfor dependent coverage, administrative and marketing costs, and reinsur-\nance. The resulting premium offered by a local health maintenance organi-\nzation (HMO) was estimated to be 25 percent lower than the market\npremium for equivalent plans.10 In contrast to COSE, which accepts mem-\nber firms with insurance who want to switch to a lower-price plan as well as\nqualified firms without insurance, FHAC targets small firms that have not\nprovided coverage for the previous six months.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We estimate that fewer than 5 percent of the small businesses in\nTampa are enrolled in the subsidized plan sponsored by this pool; approxi-\nmately 7 percent of those with insurance chose this plan. These figures are\nsubstantially lower than those reported two years ago.11 We do not know\nhow much of this drop is due to reduction in enrollment and how much to\nreporting error. Almost 14 percent of those who said that they had heard of\nthis program said that they were members. Even though we asked to speak\nto the person most knowledgeable about the firm's benefit plans, it is\npossible that some of those who said that they had not heard of the plan\nwere in fact enrolled in it.\nIt is not obvious from our survey results why this plan has not been more\nsuccessful. While this plan does not have the same degree of name recogni-\ntion as does COSE, close to 40 percent of employers that do not offer health\ninsurance in their firms had heard of the plan. Even though firms in Tampa\nthat do not offer insurance are actually more likely to report that they are\ninterested in offering insurance than those in other sites, only one-third\nsaid that they were interested, and only one-fourth actually had someone at\nthe firm shopping for insurance. As with all of our sites, more than three-\nfourths reported that costs are the major barrier, even with the availability\nof this heavily subsidized plan. Another barrier to its success may be that\nthe plan offered is an HMO. Small businesses may see an HMO as repre-\nsenting a limited choice of providers. Of six different policy options offered,\nthe availability of a low-cost, limited-choice plan was the least popular\namong our firms. Only 40 percent of Tampa firms without health insurance\nsaid that this would influence them to offer coverage.\nLow-cost, reduced-benefit plans. Another strategy in many small-\nbusiness benefit markets is to offer a plan that lowers premiums by reducing\nthe scope of the benefits. About half of our firms said that the availability\nof low-cost, reduced-benefit plans would influence their decision to offer\nhealth insurance. We were able to look at the market penetration rate of\none such plan.\nU.S. Life Insurance Company has underwritten and administered a low-\ncost, reduced-benefit plan developed and marketed by the Denver Depart-\nment of Health and Hospitals. This offering, called the Shared Cost Option\nPlan for Private Employers (SCOPE), met with what can only be called\nlimited success. Although almost 30 percent of those without insurance had\nheard of this plan, after three years of marketing only 1 percent of small\nbusinesses are enrolled in the plan, and less than 2 percent of those with\ninsurance choose the plan. Even though cost is the primary reason given for\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Firms in\nDenver that did not offer insurance coverage were more likely than those in\nthe other sites to say that the fact that lower-cost plans usually offer lower\nbenefits is an important reason why they do not offer insurance.\nLower-cost, limited-choice plans. Another way to lower premiums is\nto reduce choice of provider. The Clinton plan's reliance on managed care\nplans represents to many a reduction in choice. This was the least popular\noption offered to our firms. The HMO market has made few inroads into\nthe small-business market. We can gain limited insight into the willingness\nof small businesses to enroll in an HMO by looking at the penetration rates\nof HMOs in two of our sites: Tampa and Tucson. As discussed above, the\nHMO offered by the state-subsidized pool in Tampa has met with limited\nsuccess. In Tucson approximately 4 percent of the small businesses offering\ninsurance are enrolled in an HMO offered through the Arizona Health\nCare Group (HCG), a state-sponsored program. Only firms that have gone\nuncovered for a specified period of time are eligible; there is minimal\nadministrative support provided by the state and no direct premium subsi-\ndies. In addition to these limitations, another reason for the small enroll-\nment in this case may be exposure. Only one-fifth of the firms had heard of\nthe plan. A final limiting factor may have been that the HMOs offered were\nalso participants in Arizona's Health Care Cost Containment System\n(AHCCCS), which serves the Medicaid population.\nHere again, although cost is the primary reason cited, small businesses do\nnot want to give up choice or perceived quality to achieve those lower\ncosts. In fact, two-thirds to three-fourths of the small businesses surveyed in\nall seven sites said that the only options that would influence them to offer\ninsurance involved reducing the cost to employers or employees through\ndirect government subsidies.\nStudy Implications\nOur few examples indicate that voluntary efforts are not likely to yield\nlarge increases in the numbers of small-business employees with employ-\nment-based health insurance. Even with lower-cost options in the market,\na third or more of small businesses in our survey do not offer insurance to\ntheir employees, more than half of employees working more than seventeen\nhours a week were without employment-based coverage, and more than\none-fifth were without any coverage at all. Some of this may reflect insurers'\nunderwriting practices, which disproportionately affect small businesses\nand their employees.

Eighty percent\nof all businesses supported a law that required insurance companies to\naccept all small businesses that seek health insurance.\nThe removal of underwriting will not lead to universal health insurance\ncoverage in the small-business market, however. In addition to the af-\nfordability issue, some small-business owners just do not want to offer\nhealth insurance to their employees.12 Fewer than one-third of those not\noffering health insurance said that they were interested in making a health\nplan available to their workers (Exhibit 7).\nIf the goal of a reformed health system is universal health insurance\ncoverage, some form of mandate seems inevitable.

While in theory the cost ofhealth insurance coverage is borne by the employee through\nreduced wages, not by the employer, in practice most firms do not negotiate individual\ncompensation packages for each employee in which wages are altered to reflect\nindividual versus family health insurance coverage.\n6. Several definitional and data issues limit our ability to provide estimates that have a\none-to-one correspondence to the Clinton proposal. The proposals calculation of a\nbusiness's FTE employees includes all employees working ten or more hours per week,\nwith thirty hours a week equal to one FTE employee. Only businesses with fewer than\ntwenty-five employees working seventeen or more hours a week were eligible for our\nstudy, and these were the employees for whom we collected information on wages and\nhours. Therefore, our FTE counts are slightly lower than those that include employees\nworking ten to seventeen hours per week, and our sample underestimates the number\nof firms with twenty-five or fewer FTE employees in these cities. In addition, it is not\nclear from the proposal how the earnings of the owner(s) are handled in the calculation\nof annual average wages. We experienced considerable reporting error for this variable\nin an earlier survey of small businesses. Many owners told us, \"We don't get paid\nanything. We just take what we need.\" Others refused to give us even ranges. Given\nthese problems, we elected not to include owner wages. Depending on how the Clinton\nplan would handle owner income, this inclusion could increase or decrease the average\nannual wage per FTE employee.\n7. We calculated the maximum loss and the minimum win for each firm by doing the\nfollowing. We calculated the annual earnings of each employee and then aggregated\nacross employees to get the total annual employee wages of a firm. We divided this by\nthe number of FTEs, limited to those employees working more than seventeen hours a\nweek as noted above, to get the average annual wages per FTE. We then classified firms\naccording to the six groups established in the Clinton proposal, assigned the appropriate\npremium cap to each firm, and calculated their maximum liability. For firms that do\nnot now offer health insurance, this figure represents their maximum loss. For firms\noffering insurance, we subtracted their maximum liability from their current annual\npremium payments. A positive value represents the minimum win, a negative value the\nmaximum loss. Again, the loss could be smaller. There were a few firms in fact whose\nmaximum losses were small enough (in one case, $5 per FTE) that their specific\nsituation could result in a net win. This reversal is not likely for most of our firms,\nhowever, because losses were fairly large.\n8. For example, it will not be possible for employers to make this substitution for workers\nat or near the minimum wage.\n9. The percentages do not sum to 100 because respondents were allowed to answer\npositively to more than one action. More than one-third said that they would only\nincrease prices; 10 percent would only decrease wages and benefits; and 10 percent\nwould only decrease the number of employees.\n10. The program in Tampa was one ofseveral demonstration projects funded by The Robert\nWood Johnson Foundation; the Denver and Tucson sites also were demonstration sites.\nSee W.D. Helms, A.K.
