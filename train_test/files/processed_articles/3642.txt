Fifty-two in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted; transcripts were coded and\nanalyzed using ATLAS.ti. Interviewees perceived three major barriers to follow-up: food insecurity, difficulties navigating the\nhealth system, and women's familial roles and responsibilities. Our findings unveil the complex context in which HIV-infected\nwomen and their children live, and suggest that the structure and function of the HIV care system should be reviewed.\nEconomic empowerment of women is crucial to achieving better compliance with medical care. Integration of mother and\nchild services and more efficient and culturally sensitive medical services may improve follow-up.\n",

Mother-to-child HIV\ntransmission is a devastating consequence of the spread of\nHIV. To respond to this problem, the Mozambique Ministry of\nHealth rapidly expanded HIV-related care services to prevent\nmother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV and care for\ninfants born to HIV-infected mothers, including the provision\nof cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, HIV early diagnosis by\nDeoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase Chain Reaction (DNA\nPCR), and antiretroviral treatment (ART). Despite this com-\nmitment, the health system has had limited success in provid-\ning care to HIV-exposed children. Although national data\nsuggest treatment is increasing, the 2009 figures account for\nOne reason for low coverage of HIV care interventions\namong HIV-exposed infants is the high rate of loss to follow-\nup (LTFU) of these children in postnatal HIV care. Based on\nroutine program data from HIV treatment clinics in Beira,\nthe capital of Sofala Province in Mozambique, approxi-\nmately 60% of HIV-positive pregnant women and 50% of\nHIV-exposed children miss >3 successive clinic visits. Other\nstudies in sub-Saharan Africa found similarly low follow-up\nrates among HIV-positive women and their infants in post-\npartum care (Jones, Sherman, & Varga, 2005; Manzi et al.,\nSeveral issues may contribute to LTFU among HIV-\nexposed infants, including health system factors (e.g., long\nwaiting times, disrespectful treatment by health staff, and\nuncoordinated referrals between different HIV services; Braun\net\nchronic illness, family responsibilities, forgetfulness, lack of\nunderstanding, and distrust of health staff; Robiner & Keel,\n1997; Robiner, Yozwiak, Bearman, Strand, & Strasburg,\n2009). Transportation costs, inadequate spousal or family sup-\nport, and fear of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination\nmay discourage women from seeking care (Jones etal., 2005;\n1University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA\n2Health Alliance International, Beira, Mozambique\n3Health Alliance International, Seattle, Washington, USA\n4Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute, Washington, USA\n5Sofala Health Directorate, Beira, Mozambique\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: anajublan@gmail.com\nLoss to Follow-Up Among\nHIV-Exposed Children in an\nHIV Clinic in Beira, Mozambique\nPablo Montoya1,2, Marina Karagianis5, Laurinda Matunha2,\n Keywords\nHIV/AIDS, loss to follow-up, adherence, HIV care, access barriers\n2 SAGE Open\nstructural factors, including the physical, social, cultural, orga-\nnizational, community, economic, or policy aspects of the\nenvironment, can act as barriers or facilitators to individually\noriented HIV prevention and care services (Blankenship, Bray,\nGupta, Parkhurst, Ogden, Aggleton, & Mahal, 2008; Jones\nHowever, few data have been systematically collected in\nMozambique on the conditions that affect the lives of HIV-\npositive women and their children on a daily basis, and how\nthese conditions affect their acceptance and utilization of\nHIV care services. We therefore conducted a qualitative\nstudy to determine the factors affecting women's decision to\nseek HIV care and adhere to follow-up visits for themselves\nand their newborn babies.\nMethod\nWe conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study of a subset of\nwomen participating in an observational cohort study of nevi-\nrapine (NVP) resistance following prophylaxis with single-\ndose nevirapine, which started in June 2005 and ended in\nenrolled mothers and newborn infants participating in PMTCT\nprograms at three clinics in Beira, Mozambique. Infants were\nsupposed to make five study visits through 8 weeks of age, at\nwhich time questionnaires were administered and blood sam-\nples taken for analysis of HIV infection and NVP resistance\n(Blankenship etal., 2000). Similar to the PMTCT program\nfrom which participants were recruited, study-related follow-\nmissing >2 successive scheduled study visits. We investigated\nthe reasons for LTFU in this already assembled cohort of\nmothers and infants, to provide insights into the reasons for\nLTFU within PMTCT programs.\nTwo techniques were used to systematically collect data:\nindividual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with patients and clinic\nstaff, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with patients. A\npurposive sampling strategy was used to select participants,\nstratified primarily by the quality of their study follow-up:\n1. mother/infant pairs who participated in the NVP-\nresistance study and had good follow-up (missing\nless than two sequentially scheduled visits),\n2. mother/infant pairs who participated in the NVP-\nresistance study and had poor follow-up (missing\nmore than 2 successive scheduled visits),\n3. mother/infant pairs who only attended the first study\nvisit (early losses),\n4. mother/infant pairs who refused participation in the\nNVP-resistance study but were registered at the HIV\nclinic,\n5. mother/infant pairs whose infants were determined\nHIV-positive, and\n6. clinic workers and study staff involved in the atten-\ndance/care of women and children\nInterviews focused on exploring the main obstacles pre-\nventing women from attending study visits, as well as fol-\nlow-up with HIV care. Interviews also sought to elicit factors\nthat influence women's decisions about newborn care, and\nidentify barriers and facilitators of care and of initiating ART\nfor eligible infants.\nPreliminary analysis of the information obtained in the\nIDIs was followed by two FGDs: one including mother/\ninfant pairs with good follow-up and the other including\nmother/infant pairs with poor follow-up. The goal of these\nFGDs was to generate debate on recurrent themes that\nemerged from IDIs.\nInterview and FGD data were tape-recorded, and tran-\nscriptswerecodedandanalyzedusingATLAS.ti.Independent\ninformed consent was obtained from all study respondents.\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards\nfrom the Mozambique National Institute of Health (Maputo,\nMozambique) and Seattle Children's Hospital (Seattle,\nWashington, USA).\nResults\nFifty-two IDIs were conducted, including 42 with mother/\ninfant pairs, 6 with clinic staff, and 4 with study staff (Table 1).\nTwo FGDs were performed: One included seven individuals\nwith good follow-up and the other six individuals with poor\nfollow-up. All infants of the mother/infant pairs participating\nin the FGDs were registered at an HIV clinic that provided\ncare for HIV-exposed or infected infants.\nAn array of factors identified by women and health staff\nwere perceived as important barriers to follow-up study and\nclinic visits, and to the acceptability of services. Figure 1\nlists all these factors and attempts to represent schematically\nthe iterative and synergistic interactions among them.\nAmong the factors identified by respondents, three major\nthemes pertaining to women accessing health care repeatedly\nemerged, independent of the degree of follow-up: food inse-\ncurity, difficulties navigating a health system perceived as\ndysfunctional, and women's familial roles and responsibili-\nties. Further analysis of these three interrelated themes,\nincluding specific issues around each, is highlighted below.\nTheme 1: Food Insecurity and the Trade-Offs in\nWomen's Daily Life\nThe struggle for daily survival. Issues related to food insecurity\nwere common among all participants, and appeared to be\ninextricably linked to women's choices for continuing HIV\ncare and complying with follow-up visits. In particular, this\nBlanco et al. 3\nissue represented the strongest and most prevailing barrier\nfor all respondents who had poor adherence to follow-up vis-\nits. The struggle to get food is a daily constraint among the\nwomen interviewed, who often referred to feeling so weak\nand desperate for not having stable means of feeding them-\nselves and their children--many of whom were also ill. The\nfirst excerpt in Figure 2 from the IDI of a woman taking ART\nillustrates this situation.\nTime spent going to the clinic versus time getting money to buy\nfood. Acommon dilemma mentioned by women was whether\nto devote time to get food versus spend time going to the\nclinic. Women frequently have to help generate income for\ntheir families through informal businesses that are based on\nan unstable economy of subsistence. Common small busi-\nnesses (biscatos) mentioned by women as a daily means of\nsubsistence included the sale of charcoal processed by them\nfrom purchased firewood, the sale of sand gathered on the\nbeach to be used to make concrete for construction (an activ-\nity punishable by city officials), the sale of purchased fish,\nthe sale of nipa (a home-brewed alcoholic beverage), and the\nsale of produce from their farms (machambas) (Figure 2).\nTable 1.

Schematic diagram of iterative and synergistic barriers affecting compliance of women/infant pair follow-up in HIV care.\n4 SAGE Open\nSeasonal work and other household responsibilities. Of the 42\ninterviewed women, 36 were engaged in some kind of agri-\ncultural activity, either for household consumption or for\nselling. Because Beira's sandy soil is not fertile, many mach-\nambas are located far from the city. Taking care of their\nmachambas is done regularly throughout the year, but the\ntime devoted to this activity usually varies depending on the\nseason and distance to the fields. Thus, because most women\ndo not have money to afford public or other transportation,\nthey are required to walk long journeys to get to their crops.\nThe duration of visits to the machambas may range from 1 to\n3 days per week.\nFetching water for their households was another manda-\ntory daily activity requiring their time and resources. Most\nmothers expressed that their household tasks and subsistence\nactivities did not leave time for any additional tasks. Thus,\nattending the clinic for care or a study was only possible if\nthey sacrificed other responsibilities.\nFood aid: a social conflict at clinics.Food insecurity has also\nbecome a social problem at health facilities as health workers\nneed to restrict and prioritize beneficiaries of food aid. A\nrecurrent barrier that emerged in several IDIs and FGDs was\ncorruption in the distribution of food aid. Nearly all respon-\ndents, including clinic staff, expressed "
