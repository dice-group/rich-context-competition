Because many of these studies have focused on quantitative analyses of the subject, the\npresent study brings a complementary qualitative perspective. This article presents the findings of a case study focused on\nthe servant leadership practices of the McNeff family in their network of family-owned companies in Anoka, Minnesota. Using\nthe six servant leadership themes developed by Laub, the study focused on interviews with the owners and survey results\nfrom employees. The researchers found that the servant leadership practices of the owners are contributing to the job\nsatisfaction of the employees. In addition, the researchers found evidence to suggest that the theme of valuing people may\nhave a disproportionately strong effect on the culture of a business or organization, and serve as the foundation on which\nother servant leadership behaviors may occur.\n",

The companies are owned by\nLarry and Marie McNeff along with their son, Clayton McNeff.\nThis research was inspired by a tour of their facilities at SarTec,\nan agricultural specialty products and service company. The\nvisit was unrelated to research but the primary researcher was\nimpressed with the overall atmosphere of the company and\nwith the work being done at SarTec in creating biodiesel using\nthe recently patented Mcgyan\u00ae process (www.Mcgyan.com).\nIn July of 2009, the primary researcher began work at Bethel\nSeminary on a doctor of ministry degree in servant leadership\nfor team and organizational effectiveness. He was, once again,\na guest of the McNeffs. Now looking at organizations through\na servant leadership lens he observed that the McNeffs were\npracticing a number of servant leadership behaviors as owners\nof their companies.\nFocus of the Study\nThe focus of the study was to identify the servant leadership\nbehaviors of the company owners and to discover how their\nservant leadership practices have contributed to worker satis-\nfaction in their companies. Together the McNeffs have\nformed six family-owned companies that employ 65 people.\nThe companies are listed in Table 1.\nFamily Background\nLarry McNeff holds a BS degree in chemistry from the\nUniversity of Nebraska.

The \"Tec\" stands\nfor technology. The company has grown and now produces\nseveral animal feed products using this technology. The\nproducts have proven to be a natural way to reduce bloat in\ncattle and horses.\nMarie McNeff retired from Augsburg College in\nmember and for 5 years as the dean of faculty. Immediately\nafter retirement, she began the service of making lunch for\nall of the employees in the SarTec facility. The company has\nbecome known for this service.\nZirChrom Separations, Inc., is a company started by\nClayton McNeff in 1995 following his PhD work at the\nUniversity of Minnesota. ZirChrom manufactures zirconia-\nbased high performance chromatographic materials for the\nanalytical analysis of compounds primarily by high perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In 2006, because of\nhis work in separation sciences, Clayton was invited to help in\nresearch being conducted at Augsburg College by a student\nnamed Brian Krohn, who was working on a project to discover\na clean way to produce biodiesel fuel. This research brought\nhim together with Arlin Gyberg and Ben Yan. Gyberg is a pro-\nfessor of analytical chemistry at Augsburg College and was\nassisting Krohn in his project. Gyberg suggested bringing\nMcNeff into the research because of McNeff's work in separa-\ntion sciences and catalysts. Yan was working as the chief sci-\nentist at SarTec. This partnership resulted in the Mcgyan\u00ae\nprocess which converts alcohol in combination with vegetable\noil or animal tallow into biodiesel in a continuous, no waste\nprocess (Ever Cat Fuels, 2011). This discovery led to the cre-\nation of Ever Cat Fuels LLC and Mcgyan Biodiesel LLC. In\n2009, the family opened a biodiesel plant in Isanti, Minnesota,\nwhich uses the Mcgyan process.\nThe primary researcher is related to the McNeffs. This\npossible bias was mitigated by the inclusion of another\nresearcher and by the use of an anonymous survey taken by\nthe employees of the McNeff companies.\nLiterature Review\nServant leadership has established a solid foundation in the-\nory and practice. Built upon the work of Robert K. Greenleaf\n(2011) have proposed theoretical models to capture the\nessence of servant leadership. For Greenleaf (2002),\nThe servant leader is servant first. It begins with the natural\nfeeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious\nchoice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply\ndifferent from the one who is leader first. (p. 27)\nGreenleaf followed this with questions to test servant leader-\nship: \"Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while\nbeing served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autono-\nmous, more likely themselves to become servants?\" (p. 27).\nSuch questions serve as a foundation for the present study.\nThe researchers in this study were interested in observing the\nimpact of servant leadership on the employees of a network\nof family-owned companies. Because of this, the theme of\nservant leadership's impact on job satisfaction is of particu-\nlar interest to the researchers.\nLaub (2004) defines servant leadership as \"an understand-\ning and practice of leadership that places the good of those\nled over the self-interest of the leader\" (p. 81). This emphasis\non \"the good of those led\" is what sets servant leadership\napart from other leadership models, and serves as a founda-\ntion for theoretical connections between servant leadership\nand variables like follower commitment, leader trust, organi-\nzational trust, and job satisfaction.\nOn such connections, we note the following key argu-\nments from the literature.\nPatterson (2003) presented a theoretical model that pre-\ndicted servant leadership would produce a higher level of\nservice by the followers. Winston (2003) extended the work\nof Patterson by predicting that servant leadership will not\nonly result in greater service by the followers, but will also\nresult in greater commitment to the leader by the followers.\nErrol and Winston (2005) found that perceptions of servant\nleadership correlated positively with both leader trust and\norganizational trust and that organizations perceived as ser-\nvant-led exhibited higher levels of both leader trust and\norganizational trust than organizations perceived as nonser-\nvant-led. In an important cross-cultural study, West and\nBocarnea (2008) found that the servant leadership constructs\nof service, humility, and vision contributed to organizational\ncommitment and job satisfaction in American and Filipino\nsettings.\nThe servant leadership literature has a growing body of\nevidence pointing to the positive relationship between ser-\nvant leadership and job satisfaction. Laub (1999) pointed to\nthis relationship in the development of the Organizational\nLeadership Assessment. Irving identified a positive relation-\nship between these variables in his study in the nonprofit sec-\ntor (Irving, 2005), and in his study across multiple sectors\nbetween servant leadership and job satisfaction in her study\nTable 1.

Kong (2007) found this in a church-based study.\ntionships between servant leadership and job satisfaction in\nfound this positive relationship within the business sector,\nwith Drury focused in manufacturing and Chu focused within\na call center setting.\nThe present study expands this literature stream focused\non the relationship between servant leadership and job satis-\nfaction. Because all of the above noted studies have focused\non quantitative analyses of the relationship between servant\nleadership and job satisfaction, the present study brings a\ncomplementary qualitative perspective on this relationship,\nand does so within a network of family own companies. As\nthe positive relationship between servant leadership and job\nsatisfaction has been confirmed in many previous studies,\nthe researchers in this study found it helpful to expand the\nliterature stream focused on this relationship by looking at\nthe qualitative dimensions to this positive relationship.\nMethod\nThis study focused on identifying servant leadership prac-\ntices of the McNeff family in their network of companies in\nAnoka, Minnesota. Through personal interviews with the\nowners and survey data collected from organizational\nemployees, an approach of theoretical coding was used to\nidentify servant leadership practice in the McNeff companies\naround Laub's (1999) six servant leadership behaviors.\nData Collection\nThe data were collected by personal interviews with the\nowners, and by inviting organizational employees to a URL\ncontaining a web-based survey. The web-based survey was\navailable for all employees in the organization beyond the\nowners, and a total of 10 employees responded. Utilizing this\nweb-based format allowed for an electronically mediated\ncollection of the research data, and helped to provide both a\nconvenient and anonymous method through which employ-\nees could respond. Table 2 lists the survey questions focused\non Laub's (1999) servant leadership behaviors.\nData Analysis\nThe primary researcher approached the data obtained through\nthe interview from a narrative inquiry perspective (Clandinin\nresearcher adopted this style of research because narrative\ntheory is relational and admits to the phenomena of the\nresearcher moving from emotional involvement with the\nsubjects of the research to \"slipping to cool observation\"\nthe primary researcher was fully involved emotionally with\nthe McNeffs. Through the interview transcript and through a\n1-year time gap between the interview and writing, he was\nable achieve a degree of objectivity. Additional objectivity\nwas gained by the inclusion of a second researcher who has\nno relationship to the McNeff family. Polkinghorne observes,\n\"Narrative creates its meaning by noting the contributions\nthat actions and events make to a particular outcome and\nthen configures these parts into a whole episode\" (p. 6). In\nprocessing the interview experience, the primary researcher\nwas looking for actions and events (the parts) that contrib-\nuted to the servant leadership behavior he was observing (the\nwhole). The researchers utilized theoretical coding of the\ninterview data to determine what authentic themes were\nemerging that related to Laub's (1999) six servant leadership\nbehaviors of valuing people, developing people, creating\ncommunity, providing leadership, sharing leadership, and\ndisplaying authenticity.\nThe second source of data was obtained from the online\nsurvey completed by the employees of the McNeff compa-\nnies. This provided another needed objective point of view\nfor the research process. The primary researcher felt he was\nobserving servant leadership in action on the part of the\nMcNeffs. The survey would provide a triangulated data\nsource to help confirm or refute the observations of the pri-\nmary researcher. Furthermore, the responses to the survey\nTable 2.

Theoretical coding was also used for the\nanalysis of the survey data.\nFindings\nServant Leadership Themes\nThe primary researcher used Laub's six servant leadership\nbehaviors to provide a framework for identifying servant\nleadership behaviors in the interview transcript. Laub's first\nservant leadership behavior is \"valuing people.\" One of the\nreasons Larry McNeff left a large company to start his own\ncompany was because he felt that employees were not treated\nwell. He said that he would see people get \"tossed out just for\nthe convenience of the company.\" He determined that when\nhe started his own company, he would give people \"more\nfreedoms than they could have at a big company.\" Toward\nthe end of the interview, Larry said,\nHaving a culture where you can treat people like a family is\nimportant. It makes it very difficult to part ways with family\nmembers. Occasionally we do have to part ways with an\nemployee and that's not easy. And it shouldn't be easy. If it's an\neasy thing something is way wrong and most likely it's\nsomething wrong with management.\nThe McNeffs have been very successful in creating com-\nmunity in their companies. Marie McNeff makes lunches\nevery day for the 45 employees who work at the SarTec facil-\nity. Despite having been dean of faculty at Augsburg College\nshe does not consider cooking for people a \"menial\" task.\nRather she feels it is \"one of the most important things you\ncan do for people.\" This practice has also served to build\ncommunity within the company as the employees sit around\na table daily with one another. Clayton added that this prac-\ntice sets them apart. He said, \"We've gotten a lot of mileage\nout of it. There's almost like a folklore now about it.\" He\nthen related a story about a local newscaster who came to the\nSarTec facility to interview the founders of the Mcgyan pro-\ncess. When the reporter stepped out of his car the first thing\nhe said was, \"Is this where the good meals are?\"\nThe McNeffs articulated the importance of developing\npeople. Clayton McNeff remembers being included in family\nbusiness decisions at the age of 13 years. He said that he felt\nempowered by his parents throughout his childhood and\nearly teens. He credits his mother who had an educational\nphilosophy of finding the strengths of students and then\nallowing them to work in their areas of strength. Clayton felt\nthat his mother practiced this value with him. Clayton also\nremembers being included and empowered by his father\nwhen the family started the SarTec company. Clayton defi-\nnitely feels he benefited from the development efforts of his\nparents. This value of developing people has been continued\nby the McNeffs in their companies. They have established a\npolicy of paying for the educational development of their\nemployees. Larry stated, \"Our company pays for employee\neducational improvement.\"\nProviding leadership is another of Laub's servant leader-\nship behaviors. One of the ways the McNeffs demonstrate\nthis is through their insistence in product quality. When Larry\nMcNeff started SarTec, one of his negative experiences with\na larger company was that they were creating a cattle feed\nproduct that was actually hurting cattle. He said, \"The [prod-\nuct] they were selling, the animals would over consume and\nthey would croak!\"As a result, when he started his own com-\npany it was important to make a product that the company\ncould stand behind. When discussing company values he\nadded,\n[It was a value] to develop something that was worthwhile. To\ntry to make the best product I could in the field that we're in.\nAnd I think I did that. So we had something we could really get\nbehind.\nAlso related to providing leadership, Clayton McNeff\ndescribed the value of modeling the behaviors that the own-\ners desired from the employees. He also emphasized the\nleadership quality of teaching and encouraging problem\nsolving on the part of the employees. Noting that several of\ntheir employees had come from larger companies where the\nculture discouraged independent thinking on the part of\nemployees, Clayton gave examples of how the McNeffs\nencourage independent thinking to solve problems encoun-\ntered by the employees on a day-to-day basis.\nThe McNeffs practice sharing leadership, which is another\nof Laub's servant leadership behaviors. Clayton talked about\nthe importance of listening to employees and allowing their\nideas to have the same weight as those of the owners. He\nsaid, \"You don't always [have to] think that you're the per-\nson in the room who knows everything. [The] best ideas\nalways go on the table and it doesn't matter where they come\nfrom.\"\nDisplaying authenticity is the final servant leadership\nbehavior from Laub. In describing the importance of consis-\ntency Clayton McNeff observed, \"You have to let your\nactions speak louder than your words.\" Larry McNeff said,\n\"if you listen to your employees, they'll tell you what they\nthink and you have to invite that and they'll be honest with\nyou. You gotta know what they actually think.\" Larry also\nsaid, \"Big companies are full of loopers and log rollers who\ndon't want the other person to succeed.\" When asked by the\ninterviewer what loopers and log rollers are Larry said,\nA looper is a person who doesn't come straight with information\nor even a question but rather \"loops\" his or her way to you. A log\nroller is someone who doesn't want the guy over there to have\nthe advantage so he rolls a few logs to kill a good idea of another\nperson by questioning it to death.\nMcNeff and Irving 5\nVery often the coding of the interview revealed two or\nmore of Laub's servant leadership behaviors in combination\nwith one another. For example, one of the statements in the\ninterview was, \"You don't always think that you're the per-\nson in the room who knows everything. The best ideas\nalways go on the table and it doesn't matter where they come\nfrom.\" This statement reveals a combination of valuing peo-\nple, and practicing authenticity. When there were combina-\ntions like this, the servant leadership behavior of valuing\npeople appeared more often than any other servant leader-\nship behavior. In fact, seven of the 15 occurrences of valuing\npeople appeared in combination with another theme. It\nappeared 3 times in combination with developing people, 3\ntimes in combination with building community, and once in\ncombination with displaying authenticity.\nTable 3 lists Laub's (1999) six servant leadership behav-\niors and the number of times each behavior was identified in\nthe interview coding. The behaviors are listed in descending\norder of their occurrence in the interview.\nAntecedents of Servant Leadership Practice From\nthe Histories of the McNeffs\nThe interview revealed several contributing factors to Larry\nand Marie McNeff becoming servant leaders. First were their\nsupportive family backgrounds that valued individuals and\nencouraged achievement. Next was Larry McNeff's negative\nexperience working with a large food production company.\nHe was displeased with the lack of empowerment given to\nworkers and the lack of general care given to workers who\nencountered problems in their lives. He determined, upon\nstarting his company, that his treatment of employees would\nreflect the value of human beings. The next factor was Marie\nMcNeff's experience as an educator who approached her\nrole with a personal value of empowerment for students.\nThey also credited their servant leader attitudes to their\nChristian faith.\nClayton McNeff's path to servant leadership was largely a\nresult of growing up in a home where he was encouraged to\nparticipate in making decisions about the family business\nwhen he was only 12 years old. As a child and teenager, he\nwas influenced and empowered by his mother who\napproached his development as she would that of a student.\nAnother contributing factor was the chance he had to take a\nbusiness trip with his father and seeing how his father treated\nothers. He also was watching how his parents valued their\nemployees. One of the ways they show this is through the\nlunches that Marie prepares every day. This willingness and\neven eagerness to serve her family and her employees had a\ngreat impact on Clayton.\nEvidence of Servant Leadership Practices in the\nBusinesses\nThe employees of the McNeff's companies validated the\npresence of all of Laub's servant leadership behaviors in\ntheir survey responses. Below are the survey questions with\nsome representative comments from the employees.\nQuestion 1 (Valuing People): In what ways do the own-\ners demonstrate that they value employees?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"They never make you feel less, they take interest in\nyou and your family as people not just as an asset.\nThey make decisions for the company with their\nemployee's best interest in mind--not just the bottom\nline.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I have always been treated with great respect and\nalways felt that my work was greatly valued.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"The McNeff's treat employees like valued family\nmembers. This includes providing free lunches and\npaid health insurance benefits.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Owners show their employees that they are needed,\nand praise them for a job well done.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Everyone is treated with respect.\"\nQuestion 2 (Developing People): How do the owners\ndevelop people within this organization?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Opportunities for growth and change are distributed\nwithin the organization.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Tuition reimbursement.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Management will provide guidance and support in\norder to encourage leadership development. Almost all\npromotions come from within the existing employee\nranks.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"They find employees strengths and assign job respon-\nsibilities accordingly.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Scheduled performance appraisals.\"\nQuestion 3 (Building Community): How have the own-\ners built a sense of community within this organization?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Annual Christmas party.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Birthday recognition.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"By providing lunch every day. By always being\navailable.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Cultural celebrations like Chinese New Year.\"\nTable 3.

As a result\nemployee turnover rate is very low.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Constant communication from top to bottom of\norganization.\"\nQuestion 6 (Sharing Leadership): In what ways do the\nowners of this company share leadership?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"They put a lot of trust in their employees. They dele-\ngate tasks and trust that the tasks will be completed.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Once an objective or goal is established the owners\nand employees tasked with completing the assign-\nment share in the leadership role in order to bring the\nassignment to a successful conclusion.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"[By] developing a culture of collaboration rather\nthan command and control where change is welcomed\nas an opportunity rather than a threat.\"\nQuestion 7: What additional thoughts would you like to\nshare about your experience in this company and the\nowners?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"SarTec has a great organization in terms of manage-\nment and employee staff. Everyone seems to get along.\nMorale is high. Good place to work.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"They are generous people and great to work for.\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"I think the numbers speak for themselves. Nobody\never leaves this company.\"\nDiscussion\nThese findings revealed that there is great consistency\nbetween the owners' and employees' perspectives of the\ncompany. The employees' responses combined with the\ninterview data showed that the values verbalized by the own-\ners are validated by the employees' experience in the com-\npany. The responses of the employees confirm that servant\nleadership was being practiced by the owners and experi-\nenced by the employees. The responses also confirmed that\nthe employees who responded to the survey were experienc-\ning job satisfaction. This links, in the experience of these\nemployees, employee job satisfaction with the servant lead-\nership practices of the owners. This finding is consistent with\nprevious studies linking servant leadership to job satisfaction\nMayer, Bardes, & Piccolo, 2008). Furthermore, Rath and\nConchie (2008) identified trust, compassion, stability, and\nhope to be the greatest needs of followers that, when ade-\nquately met, contribute to their job satisfaction. Participant\nresponse previously noted supports the presence of such ser-\nvant leadership.\nThis study also revealed the possibility that the presence of\nvaluing people is what drives the servant leadership of the\ncompany owners. This emphasis on valuing people had the\nmost occurrences in the interview data and was also very well\nrepresented in the survey data. These findings indicate the pos-\nsibility that the theme of valuing people serves as a baseline\nfor the presence of the other servant leadership behaviors. On\nthe importance of valuing people, Laub (2011) argues,\nHealthy organizations have a different view of people. People\nare to be valued and developed, not used . . . Leaders accept the\nfact that people have present value not just future potential.\nPeople seem to have an innate ability to know whether or not\nthey are being valued . . . whether or not they are trusted.\nEffective leaders accept a person's value up front. They give\nthem the gift of trust without requiring that they earn it first. As\nleaders work with people in organizations they will serve them\nby displaying the qualities of valuing people.\nBased on such a perspective, it is not difficult to see why\nvaluing people may have a disproportionately strong effect\non the culture of a business or organization, and serve as the\nfoundation on which other servant leadership behaviors may\noccur.\nThis study also found that the servant leadership behav-\niors of the owners were developed over time through family,\nexperience, training, and religious faith. Larry's servant\nleadership behavior emerged through his family of origin,\nhis faith, and the negative experiences he had in a large\ncompany that seemed to devalue the importance of individ-\nuals. Marie's servant leadership behaviors flowed from her\nfamily of origin, her faith, and her educational training and\nexperience. Clayton's servant leadership emerged from his\nrelationship with his parents, especially their empowerment\nMcNeff and Irving 7\nof him in his developing years, his faith, and his own busi-\nness experience.\nStudy Strengths and Limitations\nThis study provides significant support for other findings\nthat have shown servant leadership is connected to employee\nsatisfaction. The scope of this research was limited by the\nnumber of employees who responded to the survey. This also\ntranslates into exercising caution when generalizing the find-\nings beyond the individual participants in the study. Because\nthe primary researcher is related to some of the subjects of\nthe research, there is a possibility of bias. This possibility\nwas recognized by the researchers and was moderated by the\ninclusion of the online survey to gather data from the employ-\nees. In addition, the inclusion of a second researcher who has\nno relationship with the McNeff family also served to address\nthe potential issue of researcher bias in the study. The anony-\nmous nature of the survey allowed the employees to answer\nfreely without fear of identification. The final question of the\nsurvey invited general responses from the employees.\nRecommendations for Future Research\nThe present study suggests the possibility that the valuing\npeople is a baseline for the existence of the other servant\nleadership behaviors. In light of this, future studies examin-\ning the relationship of valuing people to other servant leader-\nship behaviors are in order. In addition, the positive impact\nof servant leadership on job satisfaction was evidenced in a\nqualitative way in this study. Because of the extensive evi-\ndence of this positive correlation in the quantitative litera-\nture, it would be helpful to have additional qualitative studies\nproviding rich description of this observation in a variety of\norganizational sectors. In addition, because the sample size\nin this qualitative study was limited, future studies that\nengage a larger number of participants would help with logi-\ncal generalizations of the findings. Finally, family, faith,\nexperience, and training all contributed to the servant leader-\nship practice of the company owners with the family being\nthe primary place in the lives of the owners where servant\nleadership was modeled, nurtured, and learned. This research\ninvites future studies of the role of family relationships in the\ndevelopment of servant leaders.\nSummary\nThis research project focused on servant leadership practice\nin a network of family-owned companies. Special attention\nwas given to the connection between servant leadership prac-\ntice and employee job satisfaction, and provided qualitative\nevidence of servant leadership's positive impact on employee\njob satisfaction. In addition, the priority of valuing people\nwas observed to play a disproportionately significant role in\nthe development of an overall servant-oriented culture. Thus,\nwe argue that the behavior of valuing people is a founda-\ntional servant leadership commitment that serves as a base-\nline for other servant leadership behaviors focused on the\ngood of the led over the self-interest of the leader.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmadeo, C.
