    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the constant attention paid to what drives health care costs,\nonly recently has scrutiny been applied to the power that some health\ncare providers, particularly dominant hospital systems, wield to negotiate\nhigher payment rates from insurers. Interviews in twelve US communities\nindicated that so-called must-have hospital systems and large physician\ngroups--providers that health plans must include in their networks so\nthat they are attractive to employers and consumers--can exert\nconsiderable market power to obtain steep payment rates from insurers.\nOther factors, such as offering an important, unique service or access in a\nparticular geographic area, can contribute to provider leverage as well.\nEven in markets with dominant health plans, insurers generally have not\nbeen aggressive in constraining rate increases, perhaps because the\ninsurers can simply pass along the costs to employers and their workers.\nAlthough government intervention--through rate setting or antitrust\nenforcement--has its place, our findings suggest a range of market and\nregulatory approaches should be examined in any attempt to address the\nconsequences of growing provider market clout.\nMuch attention in health policy\nhas focused on large in-\ncreases in insurers' premi-\nums. However, another issue\nis also receiving scrutiny:\nproviders' negotiating clout to demand higher\nprices from commercial health plans.1,2 Recent\nanalyses suggest that hospital and physician pay-\nment rate increases that outpace the rate of cost\nincreases are major contributors to rising pre-\nmiums for employer-sponsored insurance.3\nProviders' growing negotiating strength also en-\nables them to modify contract terms, blocking\nhealth plans' attempts to steer patients to low-\ncost providers.\nAlthough provider market power is gaining\nattention, important variations in the story are\ngoing unnoticed. In some markets, leverage has\nnot shifted decisively toward providers. Further-\nmore, within markets, different hospitals and\nphysician practices have different amounts\nof clout.\nSome health care systems, commonly referred\nto as \"must-have\" providers--meaning providers\nthat health plans must include in their networks\nto attract employers and consumers--have used\ntheir clout to raise prices. Others are \"price tak-\ners\" and have no choice but to accept lower rates.\nOur findings describe multiple tiers of providers\nbased on differential negotiating leverage. In\ngeneral, hospitals enjoy greater negotiating lev-\nerage than physician practices, although physi-\ncians are now becoming part of hos-\npitals--primarily through employment or other\nmeans--for purposes of contract negotiations or\nare consolidating to emulate the ways in which\nhospitals gain leverage.4\nHowever, the consolidation taking place in\nmany markets often falls outside transactions\nthat are subject to traditional antitrust enforce-\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nRobert A.

There are also other important factors,\nunrelated to provider consolidation, that affect\nthe balance of negotiating power between pro-\nviders and health plans. Most tip the scale in the\nfavor of hospitals.\nIn this article, we present findings from the\nCommunity Tracking Study (described below)\nrelated to provider market power. First, we dis-\ncuss the variations observed across and within\nmarkets. Next, we present various reasons why\nleverage has shifted to some hospitals and physi-\ncian organizations. We then explore the various\ncommon forms of consolidation, including\nthose that do not raise conventional antitrust\nconcerns.\nOur research found that although dominant\nhealth plans might be able to restrain prices\nand achieve other contracting advantages, they\nalso must be sensitive to their employer custom-\ners' preferences for stable provider networks.\nTherefore, they are willing to tolerate large price\nincreases from providers--as long as these insur-\ners' competitors, other health plans, pay higher\nrates. We conclude the article by discussing\nwhether the Affordable Care Act of 2010 is likely\nto alter current negotiations, and we outline pol-\nicy options to address the cost-increasing\nconsequences of provider market power.\nStudy Data And Methods\nThe Community Tracking Study, conducted by\nthe Center for Studying Health System Change\nand funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-\ndation and the National Institute for Health Care\nReform, is a longitudinal study of twelve nation-\nally representative large metropolitan commun-\nities that have been visited approximately every\ntwo years since 1996. The seventh round of site\nvisits, conducted March\u00adOctober 2010, involved\n539 interviews with local health care leaders in\nthe twelve communities: Boston, Massachusetts;\nCleveland, Ohio; Greenville, South Carolina;\nIndianapolis, Indiana; Lansing, Michigan; Little\nRock, Arkansas; Miami, Florida; northern New\nJersey; Orange County, California; Phoenix, Ari-\nzona; Seattle, Washington; and Syracuse,\nNew York.5\nThis article is based on interviews in each site\nconducted with leaders of three to four major\nhospitals--typically the chief executive officer,\nchief financial officer, chief medical officer,\nand medical staff president of each institution.\nIn each site we also interviewed leaders of two to\nthree physician groups and major health plans--\ntypically the provider network manager, market-\ning head, and medical director.\nAdditional information was provided by inter-\nviews with state policy makers and knowledge-\nable market observers, such as local university\nfaculty members and health care consultants. In\nthe interviews, we asked general questions about\nthe dynamics of contract negotiations and spe-\ncific ones about payment methods and negoti-\nated rates.\nTwo researchers conducted each interview.\nTheir notes were transcribed, jointly reviewed\nfor validation, then entered into a database using\nthe research software Atlas.ti, version 5.0, and\ncoded to facilitate review. Atlas.ti aids in the\norganization and management of transcribed\ninterview data for qualitative analysis.\nWith few exceptions, we learned that Medicare\nAdvantage plans pay provider rates at or close to\nfee-for-service Medicare rates. Similarly, Medic-\naid managed care plan payments are close to the\nrelatively low Medicaid fee-for-service rates. Ac-\ncordingly, the findings are relevant to provider\nleverage in contract negotiations related to com-\nmercial insurance products, but not to managed\ncare in Medicare and Medicaid.\nStudy Results\nMarket Variations In Hospital Leverage\nAlthough there was an overall trend favoring\nhospitals across the twelve markets, there is\nmuch variation concerning which party--plans\nor hospitals--was perceived as having the upper\nhand in negotiations. In most markets, so-called\nmust-have hospitals have long had negotiating\nleverage over health plans. Studied markets with\nparticularly dominant hospitals include Boston,\nnorthern New Jersey, Greenville, and Cleveland.\nIn general, the clout derived from must-have sta-\ntus has increased over the past three years.\nEven in markets with dominant Blue Cross\nBlue Shield plans--in our sample, these markets\nincluded Boston, Greenville, Indianapolis, Little\nRock, Lansing, and Syracuse--respondents\nthought that hospital negotiating strength was\ngrowing. Perhaps more important, dominant\nBlue Cross Blue Shield plans were perceived as\nnot using all of their potential bargaining power.\nIn other markets the picture was mixed,\nalthough with a general trend favoring hospitals,\nespecially those organized into multihospital\nsystems.\nAcross all twelve markets, intramarket varia-\ntions in negotiating leverage were substantial.\nRespondents described \"tiers\" of hospitals based\non their negotiating leverage, although the de-\nmarcations between tiers were not always\nclear-cut.\nThe top tier--the must-haves--had substantial\nleverage over prices and related contract terms\nand conditions. The second tier included hospi-\ntals with particular attributes--for example, a\nProviders: Market Power\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Safety-net\nhospitals with a small percentage of privately\ninsured patients--sometimes in the single dig-\nits--generally had little clout with health plans,\nunless they had a level 1 trauma center or similar\nhighly specialized service that was provided to\nthe whole community.\nAlthough this study did not gather data on\nactual payment rates, other studies have found\nsubstantial variation within markets and across\ninstitutions in the various tiers.6,7 One factor that\nmay mitigate pricing variations resulting from\ndifferential hospital clout is that some payers\nbelieve there is value in maintaining alternatives\nto powerful hospital systems. An Indianapolis\nrespondent observed that health plans attempt\nto \"keep the small providers alive so there is less\nconsolidation.\" Similarly, a respondent from a\nsecond-tier hospital indicated that health plans\nwant to keep his hospital reasonably strong to\nmaintain alternatives to the dominant hospital\nsystem.\nReasons For Growing Hospital Leverage\nAlthough policy research tends to emphasize\nthe importance of hospital consolidation as\nthe driver of increased hospital leverage, we\nfound that factors unrelated to consolidation\nalso mattered. Of critical importance was em-\nployer resistance to choice-limiting networks\nwith few providers, a continuing response to\nthe managed care backlash of the late 1990s.\nWithout a credible threat of excluding a provider\nfrom their networks, health plans lack an impor-\ntant bargaining chip, study respondents said.\nAdditionally, in areas where bed supply is tight,\nhospitals can be more demanding because not\ncontracting with an insurer--other than a dom-\ninant one--poses less risk of unfilled beds.\nReputation was another key source of lever-\nage. In the words of an executive from a powerful\nhospital system, \"We have clout not because of\nour size but [because of] who we are. Am I sup-\nposed to apologize for that?\" And a Blue Cross\nBlue Shield executive observed, \"Hospitals have\npower--at least the brand names do; others\ndon't.\"\nIn many cases, hospitals that gain must-have\nstatus on the basis of theirbrand are well-known,\nresearch-oriented, academic health centers,\nsuch as Partners Healthcare, in Boston; the Uni-\nversity of Washington Medical Center, in Seattle;\nand Indiana University Health, formerly Clarian\nHealth, in Indianapolis. However, nonacademic\nhospitals also can achieve valued-brand status,\nas Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Or-\nange County and the Swedish system in Seattle\nhave done.\nRespondents also suggested that providing an\nimportant, unique service increased a hospital's\nnegotiating leverage for all of the services it pro-\nvides. With only rare exceptions in the twelve\nsites, academic health centers now have leverage\nbecause their expertise at tertiary and\nquaternary care is mostly unrivaled by other area\nhospitals. Because employers require a broad\nchoice of providers for their employees, most\nacademic health centers now have the leverage\nto require that their contracts cover all services,\nrather than only specialized services, as was\nRespondents also indicated that additional\nleverage could be gained by any hospital that\nprovided specialized services otherwise unavail-\nable or limited in the market, including a child-\nren's hospital or a neonatal intensive care unit, a\ndesignated level 1 trauma center, or a designated\norgan transplant or burn center. The unique\ncharacteristics of hospital markets also can be\nimportant. For instance, at the time of the inter-\nviews, four competing downtown hospitals in\nSyracuse provided different sets of services, so\nplans omitting any hospital from their networks\nmight experience a serious gap in network cover-\nage for particular services.8\nRespondents also thought that relative geo-\ngraphic isolation can give hospitals leverage be-\ncause health plans now are reluctant to ask\nenrollees to travel far to seek routine or even\nspecialized hospital care. This can be particularly\nimportant in relatively large, spread-out geo-\ngraphic areas, such as the Phoenix metropolitan\narea.\nHospital Consolidation Markets display\nvarious forms of provider consolidation not re-\nflected in standard measures of concentration.\nOver the past ten to fifteen years, there has been\nSome payers believe\nthere is value in\nmaintaining\nalternatives to\npowerful hospital\nsystems.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

They include national, for-profit chains\nsuch as Tenet Healthcare and HCA Healthcare,\nwhich have hospitals in Orange County and Mi-\nami, respectively, and other national systems,\nincluding Catholic Health Initiatives in Little\nRock. National chains typically negotiate with\nnational insurers for all of their hospitals.\nMore common than the national chains are\nregionally based, nonprofit multihospital sys-\ntems, often serving an extensive geographic area\nwithin a state or, in some cases, nearby states as\nwell. Across the twelve sites, important multi-\nhospital systems included Baptist Health South\nFlorida in Miami; Banner Health in Phoenix;\nAtlantic Health System and Saint Barnabas\nHealth Care System in northern New Jersey;\nGreenville Hospital System University Medical\nCenter and Spartanburg Regional in South Caro-\nlina; St. Joseph Health System and Memorial\nCare Health System in Orange County; Cleveland\nClinic and University Hospitals in Cleveland; and\nIndiana University Health and St. Vincent\nHealth, which is part of Ascension Health, in\nIndianapolis.\nThe factors that contribute to increased hos-\npital leverage are mutually reinforcing and, from\nthe health plan perspective, can produce a daunt-\ning contracting challenge. For example, Baptist\nHealth was described by Miami market respon-\ndents as having great clout because it is a multi-\nhospital system covering a large geographic area\nin south Dade County with little direct competi-\ntion from other hospitals. In addition, the sys-\ntem has a strong reputation and provides state-\nof-the-art care rivaling the area's academic\nhealth center, the University of Miami Hospital.\nSome Physicians Seek To Consolidate In\nthe Community Tracking Study, we found that\nit was common for small physician practices to\nbe price takers. Health plans typically send small\npractices a fee schedule as \"take it or leave it.\" In\ncontrast, respondents reported that large physi-\ncian groups, whether single specialty or multi-\nspecialty, have leverage in such negotiations be-\ncause their absence from a network would\nnoticeably reduce the network's attractiveness.\nThis dynamic provides an incentive for small\nphysician practices to merge.\nAnother important motivation for mergers is\nto have enough size and scope to provide profit-\nable ancillary services--such as imaging--within\nthe practice. In so doing, practices can take ad-\nvantage of the in-office ancillary services excep-\ntion to the self-referral restrictions that prohibit\ndoctors from referring patients to entities in\nwhich they have a financial interest.\nPhysicians have been merging into larger\ngroups with clout over the past decade. Such\nmergers currently represent important trends\nin Miami, Syracuse, Phoenix, and Orange\nCounty, which are all markets in which the dom-\ninant practice mode historically had been small,\nindependent practices. Nevertheless, most\nphysicians in markets that retain an orientation\nto independent, private practice continue that\npractice style despite the lack of leverage it pro-\nvides. In these markets, respondents said most\nphysicians chose neither the merged, single-\nspecialty group route nor hospital employment.\nAnother approach to consolidation that physi-\ncians use to gain negotiating strength is to ride\nthe negotiating coattails of hospitals. Physicians\nare integrated with hospitals through closely af-\nfiliated medical foundations in California11 and\nphysician-hospital organizations elsewhere.\nRespondents confirmed that in most of the\ntwelve markets, hospitals have increased the\nPhysicians have been\nmerging into larger\ngroups with clout over\nthe past decade.\nProviders: Market Power\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

By employing physicians, hospitals\ncan build referral bases to increase their market\nshares. Doing so supports service-line strategies\nthat require dedicated physician personnel12 and\npositions the hospital to respond to expected\nbundled payments and opportunities to contract\nas accountable care organizations.\nRespondents from health plans and provider\norganizations agreed that hospitals negotiating\non behalf of their employed physicians are able\nto obtain higher prices for physician services\nthan can be achieved by independent physician\npractices. Some plan respondents reported that\nhaving a large employed physician contingent\nalso increased hospital leverage over rates for\nhospital services.\nPhysicians can also consolidate by forming\nmultispecialty group practices. A number of\nCommunity Tracking Study sites have strong,\nindependent multispecialty group practices,\nsuch as the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and the\nSummit Medical Group in northern New Jersey.\nThese organizations typically have market power\nbecause they are viewed as must-have entities in\ntheir local markets as a result of strong reputa-\ntions for quality. However, as in previous rounds\nof the Community Tracking Study site visits,\nrespondents did not report new efforts to form\nmultispecialty groups.\nAn alternative form of physician integration is\nrepresented by independent practice associa-\ntions, exemplified in the study markets by Mon-\narch HealthCare Medical Group in Orange\nCounty and Mount Auburn Cambridge Indepen-\ndent Practice Association in Boston. In general,\nindependent practice associations represent in-\ndependent physician practices in negotiating\nrisk-bearing contracts with health maintenance\norganizations.\nSince the 1990s Federal Trade Commission\npolicy has promoted the creation of such organ-\nizations because of their potential to increase the\nquality and efficiency of health care--even at the\nexpense of a potential increase in market power\nby physicians.13 The Federal Trade Commission\nhas given independent practice associations an\nopportunity to seek so-called clinical integration\ndesignation, which in turn gives independent\npractice associations greater opportunity to re-\npresent their members in contract negotiations\nwith health plans, such as in preferred provider\norganization arrangements--even though the\nindependent practice association is not taking\nfinancial risk--and may also permit them to\nnegotiate contracts for preferred provider\norganization enrollees, for whom they do not\ntake risk.\nHealth Plans Resigned To Limitations Ac-\ncording to both plan and provider representa-\ntives we interviewed, health plans have not re-\ncently been aggressive in negotiations with\npowerful providers. Rather, they have attempted\nto keep low their payments to hospitals with little\nnegotiating leverage, partly to compensate for\nhigh payments to must-have providers.\nTerms such as truce and d\u00e9tente were used to\ndescribe the current state of relations between\nhealth plans and powerful hospitals across the\nCommunity Tracking Study markets. As a\nrespondent from a must-have hospital said, Blue\nCross Blue Shield is \"such a big player and we are\nsuch a big player--we have to come to terms.\"\nIn short, to a large extent, health plans have\naccepted the reality of provider leverage and its\neffects on employer health care costs. An inter-\nviewee in the Boston market observed, \"There is\na dynamic in the market that makes it impossible\nfor a private payer to change anything. They [the\ninsurers] never recovered from Tufts [Health\nPlan] trying to take on Partners and getting\nbeaten down. It scared everyone off.... It showed\nthat employers would not support plans in show-\ndowns against hospital systems.\"\nCommunity Tracking Study markets vary in\nthe degree of competition among health plans.\nSome markets, such as Seattle, Orange County,\nand Phoenix, have multiple competing health\nplans with large but not dominant market\nshares. In other sites, Blue Cross Blue Shield\nplans have long-standing, dominant market\npositions covering more than 60 percent of\nthe employer-sponsored--fully insured and\nself-insured--business. In Boston, Greenville,\nLansing, Little Rock, and Syracuse, the Blue\nCross Blue Shield plan is a state-based, nonprofit\nplan; in Indianapolis, it is the national, publicly\ntraded Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield plan.\nThese dominant purchasers should be in a\nsomewhat better position to resist even powerful\nproviders' demands for rate increases. However,\nsome respondents suggested that even dominant\nBlueCrossBlueShield plans arehesitantto nego-\ntiate aggressively with providers. According to\none Indianapolis provider, Anthem is in a posi-\ntion to \"dictate prices,\" but it doesn't because it\nTo a large extent,\nhealth plans have\naccepted the reality of\nprovider leverage.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Accord-\ning to an interviewee in Lansing, Michigan,\n\"Blue Cross Blue Shield has this deep and abid-\ning truce with hospitals: `you take what we give\nyou, and we won't make your life difficult.'\" Ac-\ncording to a Little Rock hospital interviewee,\nBlue Cross Blue Shield \"has the leverage, but\nwe get double-digit price increases.\"\nDominant Blue Cross Blue Shield plans may\neven adopt a protective attitude toward some\nhospitals. A Blue Cross Blue Shield executive\nnoted, \"It makes our job even harder because\nwe have such a big impact [on] them financially\nbecause of that [large] footprint. If we had 5 per-\ncent of the market, I think our negotiations\nwould be easier.\"\nRespondents suggested that, because they ef-\nfectively lack competition, dominant Blue Cross\nBlue Shield plans can accommodate substantial\nprice increases and pass them on in the form of\nhigher premiums. In Michigan, this approach\nwas formalized in most-favored-nation clauses\nin contracts with hospitals, committing the hos-\npitals to give Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan\nlower rates than competing insurers. The De-\npartment of Justice recently filed suit against\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, alleging that\nit paid some hospitals higher rates in return for\nthe hospitals' charging competing plans even\nhigher rates, potentially raising prices for\nIn Indianapolis, state legislation in 2007\nbanned the use of most-favored-nation clauses,\nbut Anthem reportedly still obtains the best rates\nin negotiations. In other communities, includ-\ning Syracuse and Indianapolis, it appears that\nthe dominant Blue Cross Blue Shield plan effec-\ntively obtains the best rates from hospitals in the\nabsence of explicit most-favored-nation contract\nlanguage.\nPossible Changes In The Contracting En-\nvironment Although many providers predicted\na tougher negotiating climate going forward,\nrespondents from some hospitals and large\nphysician groups remained confident that their\nenhanced and growing market power would\nwithstand the anticipated increased pressure\nplaced on insurers by employers to hold the line\non rising costs. For their part, health plans were\nmore skeptical than providers that plans could\ndrive a harder bargain, given the forces moving\nto buttress the position of powerful hospital sys-\ntems and large physician groups and the contin-\nuing preference of employers for broad\nnetworks.\nFew interviewees thought that the Affordable\nCare Act per se would do much to alter current\nmarket dynamics related to leverage. Although\nsome thought that the law's provision giving\nmore authority to state insurance commis-\nsioners to review and approve premium in-\ncreases might result in somewhat greater health\nplan resolve in negotiations, few mentioned this\nas a game changer. Rather, hospitals weremostly\nconcerned that health reform would shift their\npayer mix and result in their serving more pa-\ntients enrolled in Medicaid, which pays less than\nemployer-sponsored plans,and thathealth plans\nchoosing to participate in health insurance ex-\nchanges would peg their rates much closer to\nthose of Medicaid than to those of employer-\nsponsored plans.\nThus, although acknowledging that they\nwould see a large decrease in uncompensated\ncare burden, hospitals also were concerned that\naggregate payment rates would drop as a result\nof the shift in payer mix. In short, they expected\nthat they would need to continue to exercise\nleverage to obtain favorable rates from em-\nployer-sponsored coverage.\nDiscussion\nWe found that hospitals and physicians overall\ngained increased negotiating leverage over\nhealth plans for numerous reasons. Providers\nwith clout probably will attempt to increase rates\neven more for employer-sponsored coverage,\nleading to increased public policy attention to\nprovider pricing power.\nOur findings did not suggest that more aggres-\nsive antitrust enforcement, although clearly war-\nranted in particular situations, would success-\nfully restrain provider pricing power more\ngenerally. As we emphasized, some of the rea-\nsons for growing provider market power are un-\nrelated to consolidation.\nFurthermore, a leading form of consolidation\nHealth plans were\nmore skeptical than\nproviders that plans\ncould drive a harder\nbargain.\nProviders: Market Power\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As a practical mat-\nter, hospital mergers within a local market area\nhave already been accomplished. Additional\nmergers within primary service areas since the\nprevious round of site visits were rare, and hos-\npitals are giving much more attention to inte-\ngrating with physicians through employment.\nSection 1003 of the Affordable Care Act added\nSection 2794 to the Public Health Service Act of\n1944, including a provision that requires state\ninsurance departments to conduct an annual re-\nview of \"unreasonable\" increases in health insur-\nance premiums, defined through regulation as\nan increase of 10 percent or more. Health insur-\ners must justify premium increases, which\nmeans that theoretically, large payment rate in-\ncreases in provider contracts could lead to dis-\napproval of the premium increase. At the very\nleast, we believe that the enhanced transparency\nof negotiated rates and increased scrutiny of\nhealth plan rate increases will raise the profile\nof providerprices and could lead to public calls to\nrestrain provider pricing.\nMore concretely, increased recognition of the\nrole of provider pricing in rising health spending\ncould stimulate both market-oriented and regu-\nlatory responses. Market-oriented approaches\nare generally based on benefit designs that make\nconsumers more aware of costs and give them\ndirect incentives to select low-cost options. How-\never, these approaches, such as tiered networks,\nhave been discussed for many years and are pro-\nceeding slowly. And as we found in our site visits,\nto frustrate the adoption of tiered networks,\nsome providers use their negotiating power to\nprevent placement in a disadvantageous tier.\nNevertheless, renewed employer willingness to\nsupport choice-limiting networks with few pro-\nviders could help balance negotiating leverage\nbetween providers and health plans.15\nAlternatively, in the face of rising premiums,\nemployers unwilling to adopt more restrictive\nbenefit designs might support more direct regu-\nlation of provider rates, perhaps setting upper\nbounds on permissible rates negotiated between\nhealth plans and providers in relation to Medi-\ncare rates.16 Although such an approach has the\nvirtue of regulatory simplicity, it would not per-\nmit tailoring payments to individual hospital cir-\ncumstances, such as the hospital's payer mix.\nAlternatively, employers could push state gov-\nernments to \"reinvent\" provider rate setting. In\nthan thirty states were involved in reviewing or\nactually regulating hospital payment rates for all\npublic and private payers.17 A few states--includ-\ning Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, West\nVirginia, and New York--had functioning, rea-\nsonably successful all-payer programs. Although\nmost of these states have since ended those pro-\ngrams, Maryland and West Virginia's rate setting\nprogram continues.\nSome current policy wisdom assumes that this\nform of price regulation failed and therefore fell\ninto disfavor. However, research suggests that\nsome states with mandatory controls on hospital\nrates were able to reduce their rates of growth in\nper discharge and per capita inpatient costs rel-\native to states with voluntary, weak, or no\nConclusion\nAlthough the broad trend of provider consolida-\ntion is a major factor in the growth of hospital\nand physician-group negotiating leverage with\nhealth plans, a number of other factors, individu-\nally or in combination, also have contributed to\nhigh payment rate increases. Findings from the\nCommunity Tracking Study suggest that the\nsources of negotiating leverage for providers\nin the contracting process are more nuanced\nthan previous discussions would suggest.\nAlthough some policy analysts believe that more\nintensive state review of commercial insurer re-\nquests for premium rate increases would indi-\nrectly exert downward pressure on provider\nrates, our findings indicate that a range of other\nmarket and regulatory approaches also need to\nbe examined in any attempt to address the\nconsequences of growing provider leverage. \nThe study was funded by the Robert\nWood Johnson Foundation and the\nNational Institute for Health Care\nReform.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
