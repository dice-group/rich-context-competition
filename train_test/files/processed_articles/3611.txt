Using two nationally-representative surveys and a third\nsurvey of registered voters, we find Americans' engagement in boycotts and/or buycotts for political or social reasons to\nbe widespread. Social media activity, political knowledge, ideological intensity, and an interest in politics are significantly\nassociated with political-consumer behavior. Among partisans, we find both instrumental and expressive partisanship to\nbe significant predictors of political consumerism.\n",

In one recent example, Donald Trump encouraged\nhis supporters to \"buy L.L. Bean\" after Democrats called\nfor a boycott of the brand upon learning the company's\nheiress, Linda Bean, donated large sums to a pro-Trump\npolitical action committee (PAC) (Victor, 2017). Other\nbrands such as New Balance (Gilbert, 2016), Nordstrom\nbeen targets of boycotts and/or buycotts in the last year\nrelated to political or social issues. Survey data show that\nsizeable percentages of Americans report having boy-\ncotted or buycotted a product or company (Baek, 2010;\nCopeland, 2014a) and that such political consumerism\nappears to have become more widespread in many west-\nern countries, including in the United States (Stolle and\nMicheletti, 2013).1 Although political consumerism has\nreceived a fair amount of scholarly attention, we still have\nan incomplete picture of the sociopolitical and demo-\ngraphic underpinnings of this behavior.\nThe current study advances several objectives. First, we\naim to update previous studies of political consumerism with\nan eye towards developing longitudinal perspectives of such\nbehavior and examining the factors that currently explain it.\nOur approach engages potential limitations in the extant\nresearch and adopts refinements to address measurement and\nother methodological concerns. Next we seek to build upon\nexisting scholarship in two substantive ways. A central goal\nis to examine how individuals'partisan identities find expres-\nsion in their consumer choices. We focus not only on the\ninstrumental aspects of partisanship but also on \"expressive\npartisanship,\" which, as we discuss below, scholars view as a\nrelated but distinct concept (Huddy etal., 2015). We also\ninvestigate how contextual changes, most notably, the prolif-\neration of social media and ensuing changes in interpersonal\nnetworks, may influence political consumerism.\nWe leverage a variety of empirical sources to pursue our\nobjectives. We analyze two, nationally-representative sur-\nveys conducted by YouGov in 2016 and an original, third\nsurvey of registered voters that included a partisan identity\nbattery adopted from Huddy etal. (2015). As a preview, we\nfind that instrumental components of partisanship are\nBoycotts, buycotts, and political\nconsumerism in America\nKyle Endres1 and Costas Panagopoulos2\n Keywords\nBoycotts, buycotts, expressive partisanship, instrumental partisanship, partisan identity\n1Duke Initiative on Survey Methodology, Duke University, USA\n2Department of Political Science, Northeastern University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nKyle Endres, Duke Initiative on Survey Methodology, Duke University,\nEmail: Kyle.endres@gmail.com\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nstrongly associated with political consumerism and that\nindividuals with strong expressive partisan identities are\nmore likely to report boycott participation. Our analyses\nalso suggest social media activity is associated with politi-\ncal consumerism. We proceed by providing a brief over-\nview of political consumerism, how it is measured, and our\nexpectations about the relationship between boycotts/buy-\ncotts and partisanship. We then describe our data and meth-\nodological procedures and report our findings.\nBackground and expectations\nPolitical consumerism is often considered an extension of\n\"lifestyle politics\" (Bennett, 1998) where politics infiltrates\nnon-political aspects of our daily routines. The decision to\npatronize one business over another falls into this broad\ncategory. Over time, the study of political participation has\nexpanded to include forms of non-electoral participation\nsuch as protest (Barnes and Kaase, 1979), volunteering\n(Verba, Schlozman and Brady, 1995) and eventually politi-\ncal consumerism (Newman and Bartels, 2011). In fact, a\ngoal of the initial political science research on consumer-\nism was to establish it as a form of political participation\ninations of survey data documented substantial overlap\nbetween many of the characteristics that predict consumer-\nism and those that predict other forms of participation\nEarly research about the topic used a variety of question\nwordings when inquiring about participation in boycotts and\nbuycotts. Generally, researchers have taken a broad approach\nby asking about purchasing decisions for \"political, ethical,\nor environmental reasons.\" Referencing the environment in\nquestions designed to measure political consumerism may\ninflate estimates of those, particularly on the left, who\nengage in politically-minded shopping or eating (Stolle and\nattention to boycotts and buycotts arising from \"social and\npolitical\" (dis)agreements with corporate entities and ask\nidentical questions in all three surveys to evaluate whether\npolitical consumerism fluctuates during the relatively short\ntime period between our surveys. Large variations have\nbeen observed in prior studies. Both context and question\nwording may contribute to these discrepancies. For exam-\nple, a 2002 survey found that almost half of Americans had\npreviously participated in boycotts or buycotts (Baek, 2010).\nThis estimate is on the high end and is likely an artifact of\nthe question wording, which did not specify a time period.\nThe frequency of boycott or buycott behavior is usually\nlower when questions reference a specific time frame, gen-\nerally, the previous year (e.g., Newman and Bartels, 2011;\nwe follow this approach in our studies.\nMuch has changed since many of the initial studies\nabout political consumerism were conducted, including\nhow Americans acquire political information as well as\ngrowing partisan polarization. One prominent difference is\nthe popularization of social media, which is a leading\nsource of information about the implications of consump-\ntion choices (Stolle and Micheletti, 2013). Social media is\nparticularly relevant for some segments of the population\nthat are highly active online (see Becker and Copeland,\n2016) and may accelerate how quickly information con-\ncerning corporate political activity reaches everyday\nAmericans. Exposure to information about companies and\nindustries that violate (or conform to) citizens'political val-\nues is a necessary component for political consumerism\nDe Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et\nMicheletti, 2013). Accordingly, we expect that social media\nuse will be positively correlated with political consumer-\nism, although we recognize that relevant information may\nreach the public through a variety of channels, including\ntraditional ones.\nWhen Americans encounter information about the polit-\nical activities of corporations and brands, they may be\nmotivated to reward or punish them by either purchasing or\ndeclining to purchase their goods or services. Partisans\ntoday are potentially more reactive to political information\nabout corporate entities, given that Democrats and\nRepublicans have become more polarized in recent years,\nand Americans affiliated with each party increasingly dis-\nlike the opposition (Webster and Abramowitz, 2017;\npolarization, or hostility toward opposing partisans, seems\nto be growing, ingrained or automatic in voters' minds and\nas potent as animus based on race (Iyengar and Westwood,\n2015). Moreover, the \"intrusion\" or \"gradual encroach-\nment\" of party preference into nonpolitical or personal\ndomains is causing nonpolitical judgments and behaviors\nto reflect the influence of partisan cues (Iyengar and\nmoved to boycott or buycott. We suspect political consumer\nbehavior to vary based on the expressive and instrumental\ncomponents of individuals' partisan identities. Expressive\npartisanship refers to one's longstanding identity as either a\nDemocrat or a Republican (see Huddy et\nGreen etal., 2002), whereas instrumental partisanship can\nbe viewed as \"a running tally of party performance, ideo-\nlogical beliefs, and proximities to the party in terms of\none's preferred policies\" (Huddy etal., 2015: 1). Standard\nmeasures of strength of partisanship do not allow for a dis-\ntinction between expressive and instrumental partisanship.\nA strong expressive partisan identity has been linked to\ncampaign activity and electoral participation (Huddy etal.,\nelectoral forms of behavior such as consumerism has not\nbeen evaluated. While less direct than campaigning, we\nexpect expressive partisanship to be associated with\nAmericans' decisions to reward or punish companies for\nEndres and Panagopoulos 3\npolitical or social reasons. Calls to boycott or buycott com-\npanies for their political activities, including, as the L.L.\nBean example showcases, the endorsements or contribu-\ntions of its affiliates, might be particularly motivating for\npartisans with a strong expressive identity.\nThere are several reasons to believe that instrumental\npartisanship is also associated with political consumerism.\nIn fact, much of the extant research has focused on a brand's\npolicy record. When partisans are called upon to boycott or\nbuycott companies for actions related to the policy propos-\nals of a party or candidate, instrumental partisanship could\nmotivate the action. Recent examples that strike an instru-\nmental tone include calls by Republicans to boycott\nStarbucks following its criticism of Trump's refugee policy\n(Mazza, 2017) and boycotts by Democrats against New\nBalance after it signaled support for Trump's policy on the\nTrans-Pacific Partnership (Gilbert, 2016). A priori, we are\nagnostic about the relative effects of instrumental versus\nexpressive partisanship on political consumerism, but we\nexplore this question empirically below.\nData and methods\nWe use data from three sources\u00adthe American National\nElection Study (ANES) 2016 Pilot, and two original sources,\nthe 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)\nand an original survey of registered voters. The ANES pilot\nis a cross-sectional survey fielded in January 2016 to a sam-\nple of 1200 adults. The CCES data was collected during the\n2016 presidential election. Our political consumerism items\nwere included on the pre-election instrument that was\nadministered beginning in late September to 1000 partici-\npants. Both the ANES and the CCES were conducted online\nby YouGov. In our analyses, we apply the weights provided\nfor each survey. Our survey of registered voters was fielded\nfrom late March to early April 2017 to a random sample of\nvendor; 397 US voters participated in the survey, represent-\ning an overall response rate of about 4%. This survey probed\nrespondents about political consumerism as well as about\nWe measure consumer behavior identically across all\nsurveys using separate questions on participation in boy-\ncotts and buycotts. Specifically, respondents were asked,\n\"In the last 12 months, have you bought a certain product or\nservice because of the social or political values of the com-\npany that provides it, or have you not done that in the past\n12 months?\" and \"In the last 12 months, have you declined\nto buy a certain product or service because of the social or\npolitical values of the company that provides it, or not?\"3\nAsking identical questions before the start of the presiden-\ntial nominations and again in the weeks before the general\nelection allows us to detect potential fluctuations in politi-\ncally-minded spending during the contentious 2016 cam-\npaign. Some earlier studies of political consumerism\nself-reports of boycotts and buycotts into a single measure.\nWe will similarly collapse our survey responses to assess\nthe proportions of Americans who actively purchase or\ndecline to purchase products for political or social reasons,\nbut we also evaluate them separately, as we view them as\ndistinct actions based on punishment and reward, respec-\nWe run logistic regression models for each outcome\nvariable. Individuals who reported declining to buy a prod-\nuct or service in the previous 12 months are coded dichoto-\nmously as \"1\" and all other individuals are coded as \"0.\"\nAn identical coding scheme is used for the buycott outcome\nvariable (1 = buycotted, 0 = did not). For the first half of our\nanalyses, our explanatory variables of interest are: party\nidentification, partisan intensity, ideological intensity,\npolitical interest, political knowledge, and social media\nactivity.4 We also include a range of available control vari-\nables including: age (and age-squared), gender, race, edu-\ncation, income, marital status, and voter registration status.\nFor the registered voter survey, we omit controls that were\nunavailable (income, marital status, and political knowl-\nedge) or not applicable (voter registration).\nWe designed our registered voter survey to enable us to\nempirically test our expectations regarding expressive and\ninstrumental partisanship. In this survey, we included the\nfour-question partisan identity battery adopted from Huddy\netal. (2015) to create a scale ranging from \"0\" (low expres-\nsive identity) to \"1\" (high expressive identity). This survey\nalso included questions about respondents' positions on\npolicies including abortion, gay marriage, immigration,\nObamacare, and the minimum wage, and responses were\nused to construct a scale for instrumental partisanship on\nwhich \"0\" represents someone who is neutral on all issues\nor whose liberal and conservative issue positions cancel\neach other out, and \"1\" represents someone who reported\nthe extreme liberal (conservative) position on each issue.\nPatterns and determinants of\ncontemporary political consumerism\nWe begin by reporting and contextualizing the overall pat-\nterns that emerge in our surveys and proceed to examine the\ndeterminants of contemporary political consumerism in\nAmerica. Consistent with previous studies, we find that\npolitical consumerism is commonplace in the United States.\nSizeable percentages across all three of our studies reported\nboycotting and buycotting products or services because of\nthe social or political values of the company that provides\nof survey respondents reported that they participated in a\nboycott and/or buycott during the previous 12 months.\nBoycotting occurred more frequently than buycotting in this\nand in all three of our surveys, 32% of respondents reported\nboycotting compared to 22% who reported buycotting a\n4 Research and Politics \nproduct or service. Both boycotting and buycotting were\nmore prevalent among registered voters, with 39% reporting\nparticipating in a boycott and 27% in a buycott. The percent-\nages climbed as the culmination of the 2016 election\napproached, based on our October survey, when a combined\n40% of respondents reported boycotting (36%) and/or buy-\ncotting (22%) a product. The rates increase slightly in this\nsurvey when the analysis is restricted to registered voters\n(39% boycotted; 24% buycotted). Frequencies rise further\nrespondents indicated they had participated in a boycott\nwe detect hints that political consumerism may be on the\nrise, both over time and over the period of our studies, but we\ncaution that additional, longitudinal research is necessary to\ndetermine whether these patterns are solid or ephemeral.\nNext, we proceed to assess the sociopolitical and demo-\ngraphic underpinnings of political-consumer behavior. We\nrun a series of logistic regression models for each survey to\nbetter understand which individual-level characteristics are\nrelated to political consumerism. Reported participation in\na boycott or a buycott in the previous year are separately\nregressed on a variety of political variables including: par-\ntisan identification, political knowledge, political interest,\npartisan intensity, ideological intensity, and social media\nactivity as well as an array of demographic variables. We\nalso collapse political consumerism into a single, dichoto-\nmous variable indicating participation in either a boycott or\nbuycott in the previous year as a function of the same politi-\ncal and demographic variables.\nPolitical knowledge, political interest, and ideological\nintensity were significant predictors of all three outcome\nvariables (boycott, buycott, and the combined variable) in\neach of the surveys we analyze. Individuals who demon-\nstrated greater knowledge about politics, who reported\nhigher levels of interest, and who placed themselves near\nthe extremes on the seven-point ideological scale were all\nmore likely to have reported engaging in political consum-\nerism during the previous year. This is consistent with pre-\nvious findings in the US and in other Western democracies\nthat placement on the political spectrum and an interest in\npolitics are closely related to political-consumer behavior\n(Stolle and Micheletti, 2013). Although the social media\nuse variable was not available for all three studies, our\nanalyses of the CCES revealed, as expected, that social\nmedia use was significantly correlated with political con-\nsumerism across the board; higher levels of political activ-\nity on social media were, in fact, associated with higher\nrates of participation in boycotts and buycotts, all else being\nequal. This finding is generally consistent with social media\neffects reported by Copeland and Becker (2016), although\nsocial media activity in their study was denoted using indi-\ncators for social media membership, discussion of LGBT\nissues on social media, and using social media to meet\nother LGBT people. By contrast, the constitutive compo-\nnents of our measure of social media use are less restrictive\noverall and incorporate items that focus on political activity\non social media. The results we report also speak to the\nbroader generalizability of social media effects, given\nCopeland and Becker's (2016) analyses were based on a\nspecialized sample restricted to LGBT individuals. Finally,\nwe note that our original results overall remain robust to the\ninclusion of the measure of social media use.\nOur findings on political orientation are comparable to\nsome prior studies that found left-leaning individuals par-\nticipated in boycotts and buycotts at higher rates than con-\nservatives (Stolle and Micheletti, 2013), but somewhat\ncontrast with other studies that reported individuals who\nengaged in buycotts were more likely to identify as\nRepublican and conservative whereas individuals who\nparticipated in boycotts more frequently identified as\nDemocrats and liberal (Baek, 2010). Since we are exclu-\nsively investigating political consumerism in the United\nStates, we folded ideological self-placement to represent\nideological intensity and included indicator variables for\nparty identification. In addition to significant findings for\nideological intensity, Republicans were less likely to report\nparticipating in a boycott compared to Democrats; the dif-\nferences are statistically significant (p < .05, two-tailed) in\nTable 2.5 Republicans also reported buycotting a product\nor service in the previous year at lower rates than\nDemocrats, as shown in Table 3, a difference that was only\nsignificant in the January 2016 survey. It is conceivable\nthese patterns reflect the influence of partisan reactions to\nDonald Trump and the idiosyncratic nature of the 2016\npresidential election, but additional research is needed to\ndetermine whether these effects persist. Nevertheless,\nTable 1. Percentage of Americans reporting boycotting or buycotting in the previous year.\nFull Sample Reg. Voters Full Sample Reg. Voters Reg.

Individuals who were not registered were\nsignificantly less likely to have reported boycotting and\nbuycotting in the ANES survey, but voter registration was\nnot significant and was in the opposite direction for boy-\ncotting and the combined variable in the CCES. Neither\nincome nor marital status were significantly related to\neither boycotts or buycotts. Consistent with prior research\nthat finds women to be more frequent political consumers\nin almost all countries except the United States (Stolle and\nMicheletti, 2013), significant gender differences rarely\nemerged in our surveys. Gender was only significant for the\ncombined boycott/buycott variable in the April 2017 sur-\nvey (see Table 4), in which women were more likely to\nhave reported participating in political-consumer behavior.\nOverall, race and age were generally insignificantly related\nto political-consumer behavior.\nPolitical consumerism as political\nexpression: Assessing the role\nof expressive and instrumental\npartisanship\nNext we narrow our focus to Democrats and Republicans to\nexamine the impact of expressive and instrumental parti-\nsanship on political consumerism. Overall, we find strong\nevidence that both expressive and instrumental aspects of\npartisanship are related to political consumerism.Across all\nthree models, our measure of instrumental partisanship is\nstatistically significant (p < .05, two-tailed). Expressive\npartisan identity, on the other hand, has a positive and sta-\ntistically significant association with boycotting and the\ncombined boycott/buycott outcome variable, suggesting\nthat individuals with a strong expressive identity may be\nmore inclined to punish brands that oppose their party than\nto reward brands that support their party. We note that\nexpressive partisan identity appears to have a substantively\nsimilar (positive) impact on buycotting behavior, but the\neffect is not statistically significant at conventional levels.\n6 Research and Politics \nTable 3.

On average, a one standard\ndeviation increase on the instrumental partisanship scale,\napproximately 0.33, corresponds to an increase in the prob-\nability of participation in a boycott during the preceding\npating in a buycott by 0.09 (p = .004), holding all other vari-\nables constant. Similarly, a one standard deviation increase\non the expressive partisanship scale, approximately 0.21,\ncorresponds to an increase in the predicted probability of\n(p = .146 ). We conclude from these analyses that instru-\nmental partisanship likely has a modestly stronger, although,\nin our view, comparable, substantive impact on political\nconsumerism, relative to expressive partisan identity. 7\nConclusion\nLarge percentages of Americans participate in boycotts and\nbuycotts for political reasons. These rates varied across our\nthree surveys conducted over a sixteen-month period in the\nUnited States, with the portion who reported partaking in\npolitical-consumer behavior rising in each successive sur-\nvey. Political knowledge, political interest, and ideological\nintensity are all closely related to participation in political-\nconsumer behavior. In two of the three surveys we analyze,\nRepublicans reported engaging in political-consumer behav-\nior at lower rates than Democrats. Narrowing our focus to\npartisans, we show that both expressive and instrumental\npartisanship are associated with political-consumer behavior.\nIndividuals withstrongexpressivepartisanidentities reported\nboycotting at higher rates than individuals with weaker iden-\ntities. Instrumental partisanship was a significant predictor of\nboth boycotts and buycotts, with partisans who held more\nconsistent policy positions reporting higher rates of partici-\npation in recent boycotts and buycotts compared to those\nwho held less consistent positions.\nThe fluctuations in participation in boycotts and/or buy-\ncotts for political reasons between our surveys as well as\nthe relationship between political consumerism and instru-\nmental and expressive partisanship suggests that context\nmatters. Individuals who failed to engage in political con-\nsumerism during the past year could still be triggered to\nparticipate if exposed to the relevant information connect-\ning the politics of brands with their own political predispo-\nsitions. Instrumental partisanship should be most relevant\nwhen calls to boycott or buycott emphasize policy issues.\nAmericans with strong expressive partisan identities are\nlikely to respond to political information, such as cam-\npaign contributions and endorsements. Our findings sug-\ngest that expressive partisanship may be more closely\nassociated with punishing companies for actions that sup-\nport the opposition through boycotts rather than rewarding\nthem for activities that support their own party, results that\nare consistent with studies that find anger or threat can\nmotivate action based on partisan identity (see Miller and\nThe implications of the analyses we report are poten-\ntially significant. In an era characterized by heightened par-\ntisan polarization, political views and preferences may\nincreasingly find expression in individuals' consumer pref-\nerences and behavior.Additionally, the recent U.S. Supreme\nCourt ruling in Citizens United v. FEC that enables corpo-\nrations to engage directly in electioneering has already\nopened the floodgates for increased corporate political\nTable 5.

Our research suggests individu-\nals will be responsive to these activities, a finding that may\n(or may not) affect corporate calculations about the risks or\nopportunities associated with overt political involvement.\nOther contextual developments seem to be influential\nas well. Our results reinforce the notion that social media\nuse affects and, as Copeland and Becker (2016) argue,\nlikely facilitates political consumerism, a finding whose\nimplications are potent given social media's capacity to\ntransform the sociopolitical landscape and to extend indi-\nviduals' interpersonal networks. These changes may influ-\nence citizens' consumer reactions in meaningful ways. As\naccess to information about the politics of corporations\nbecomes more widespread, for instance, the relationship\nbetween expressive partisanship and consumer behavior\nmay grow even stronger. The heightened scrutiny of cor-\nporate political activity facilitated by near-constant cover-\nage of such activities, transparency in the form of\nimmediate disclosure of at least some of these activities,\nand the capacity for instantaneous awareness building and\nmobilization afforded by social and other media suggest\nthe distinctions between consumer and political expres-\nsions and behavior may be eroding. In light of these devel-\nopments, we also believe it is useful to continually monitor\nthe social and attitudinal underpinnings of political con-\nsumerism to track ways in which these may change over\ntime and in different circumstances. The current study\naims to take a step in this direction.\n"
