During the past three decades the prevalence\nof obesity among adolescents has increased markedly, with\nrecent estimates as high as 17% for adolescents and 28% for\nyoung adults (1,2). There is evidence that being obese in child-\nhood and adolescence at least doubles the risk of obesity in\nadulthood (3), and some studies have shown that the most\nobese adolescents have a 17-fold greater chance of becoming\nobese adults when compared to their nonobese peers (4,5).\nMoreover, obese adolescents are 30% more likely to die prema-\nturely compared to their normal-weight peers, although this is\nlargely explained by their increased risk for adult obesity (5).\nTheburdenofobesityiscurrentlygreaterwithincertainracial\nand ethnic groups in the United States. Among females, this\ndisparity is most pronounced in African Americans and some\nHispanic subpopulations (2,6\u00ad8). In the most recent National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey, Ogden et al. found\nnon-Hispanic black girls were twice as likely, and Mexican-\nAmerican girls were 1.5 times as likely, as non-Hispanic white\ngirls to be obese (1). In another National Health and Nutrition\nwere obese, compared to 36% of Mexican-American women,\nand 24% of white women (2). There is evidence that this\n\ndisparity starts early (9). Kimm et al. found an increase in the\ndifference in median BMI between white and black girls from\nference is particularly worrisome as black girls who are obese\nin childhood and adolescence are more likely than obese white\ngirls to remain obese as adults (9,11).\nHealth behaviors, such as dietary intake, physical activity,\nand inactivity, have been a major area of focus in trying to\nunderstand the origins of obesity. Television (TV) viewing has\nbeen one of the health behaviors most consistently associated\nwith obesity (12,13). In their seminal paper linking TV and\nobesity in children and adolescents, Dietz and Gortmaker note\nthat this relationship may be mediated by a direct displacement\nof physical activity, as well as an increase in caloric consump-\ntion induced by food advertisements and snacking time (14).\nAlthough TV viewing is often associated with lower \nlevels of\nTelevision Viewing Is Not Predictive of BMI\nin Black and Hispanic Young Adult Females\nTracy K. Richmond1, Courtney E. Walls2, Holly C. Gooding1 and Alison E. Field1,3,4\nPrevious studies have observed that television (TV) viewing is predictive of obesity and weight gain. We examined\nwhether the cross-sectional association between TV viewing and BMI varied by racial/ethnic subgroups among\nyoung women in Wave III (collected in 2001\u00ad2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We used\nmultivariate linear regression to examine the relationship between TV viewing and BMI among 6,049 females while\ncontrolling for sociodemographic and health attributes. We stratified the sample by race/ethnicity to better understand\nthe association between TV viewing and BMI across different groups. Black and Hispanic females had higher BMIs\nnumbers of hours spent watching TV (black: 14.7h/week, Hispanic: 10.6h/week, white: 11.2h/week) when compared\nto their white and Hispanic peers. TV viewing was positively associated with BMI ( = 0.79, P = 0.003 for 8\u00ad14\nweek;  = 1.18, P = 0.01 for >14 vs. 7h/week) independent of race/ethnicity, age, maternal education, history\nof pregnancy, parental obesity, and household income. However, in models stratified by race/ethnicity, increased TV\nviewing was associated with increased BMI only among white females; TV viewing was not predictive of higher BMI in\nblack or Hispanic young adult females. Among black and Hispanic females, counseling to decrease TV viewing may\nbe important but insufficient for promoting weight loss.\n1Division of Adolescent Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 2Center for Research Programs, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston,\nMassachusetts, USA; 3Channing Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA;\n4Department of  , Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Furthermore,\nseveral studies show a stronger correlation between obesity\nand inactivity, including TV viewing, than obesity and physi-\ncal activity (18\u00ad22). Although the association between TV\nviewing and weight status has been found in both genders, the\nrelationship appears stronger and more consistent in females\nThere is evidence that adolescents and young adults\nfrom racial and ethnic minority groups watch more TV\ntheir white peers. Despite these consistent findings, several\nstudies of preadolescent to young adult females have found\nthat TV viewing and weight are not statistically related in black\nTV viewing and BMI among black girls may be one reason\nwhy some studies of TV and obesity using racially heterogene-\nous populations have had null findings (16). The reasons why\nTV and weight are not as consistently related in females from\nracial and ethnic minority groups as they are in white females\nis not well understood.\nPrevious studies of how race and ethnicity affect the relation-\nship between TV and obesity have often been small, localized to\na few cities, and/or focused only on adolescents. The National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) offers\na unique opportunity to add to the current literature on eth-\nnic and racial differences in TV viewing and obesity because it\ncontains data from over 7,000 young women from a variety of\nrace/ethnic groups surveyed both in adolescence and in young\nadulthood. The study includes a wealth of information on per-\nsonal and socioeconomic backgrounds and health behaviors.\nAlthough Add Health has information about additional forms\nof inactivity, such as listening to the radio and/or playing com-\nputer games, we opted to focus exclusively on TV because of its\npotential to impact weight status through multiple pathways\nsuch as involving the participant in a sedentary behavior or\ninducing increased snacking through exposure to advertise-\nments for calorie dense foods. We also felt that TV watching\nwas less likely than other forms of media to be done concur-\nrently with other activities (i.e. running while listening to a\nportable music player, playing an active video game such as\nDance Dance Revolution).\nWe used Add Health to address the following hypotheses:\n(i) increased TV viewing is associated with higher average\nBMI in young adult women; and (ii) The association between\nTV viewing and BMI will be different in white young adult\nfemales when compared to both black and Hispanic young\nadult females.\nMethods and Procedures\nStudy population\nThis research uses data from the third of four Waves of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative\nschool-based study of adolescents enrolled in grades 7\u00ad12 at initial\nrecruitment. We used two baseline variables from the first Wave\nto capture the socioeconomic status of the participants' family of\n\ndifferences\nbetween Hispanic, black, and white females, we limited our sample\nto females who self-identified as white, non-Hispanic; black, non-\nHispanic; or Hispanic. We excluded those with height <4 feet or 7\nfeet, as well as those with weight 50 pounds or 500 pounds, due to\nconcerns about plausibility. The distribution of reported TV viewing\nwas markedly skewed and thus we excluded those with self-reported\nalso excluded those who were currently pregnant (n = 256) and/\nor disabled (n = 298) because we felt that their TV viewing and/or\nweight status might be influenced by factors different than those in\nthe nondisabled, nonpregnant population.\nIn addition to the above exclusions, we excluded those who had \nmissing\ndata for either the dependent variable or for any of our key independ-\nent variables. However, before this final exclusion, we addressed a high\nnonresponse rate (~10%) for the two variables from Wave I measuring\nsocioeconomic status--parent reported maternal education and house-\nhold income. In an effort to avoid selection bias and inaccurate infer-\nences resulting from list-wise deletion, we imputed these variables by\nbest-subset regression (29,30). After this imputation and all exclusions\nyoung adult females.\nStudy variables\nOutcome variable. BMI (weight (kg)/height (m2)) was our outcome\nvariable. BMI was calculated from measured weight and height when\navailable (95%) and from self-report in the small number of partici-\npants missing measured weight and height (5%).\nPrimary predictor variable. Our primary predictor variable of inter-\nest was self-reported TV viewing. Participants were asked, \"On average,\nhow many hours a week do you spend watching TV?\" to which they\nresponded with a number ranging from 0 to 168h/week. Because of the\nskewed distribution of responses we dropped those who were beyond\nthen modeled TV as a categorical rather than continuous variable and\ngrouped respondents into three categories: 0\u00ad7h/week; 8\u00ad14h/week;\n14h/week. We based our categories on an average number of hours\nper day extrapolated to total number of hours reported per week. We\nchose the highest category based on recommendations from profes-\nsional organizations to limit TV viewing to <2h/day. Participants were\nalso asked, \"In the past 7 days, how many times did you watch TV?\"\nand responses ranged from 1 to 7. We used this variable for sensitivity\nanalyses and found similar results to those using self-reported h/week\nspent watching TV. Therefore, we present only findings using the report\nof h/week of TV viewing.\nAdditional independent variables. Race/ethnicity was constructed\nfrom two questions, one that asked participants to indicate whether\nthey were of Hispanic/Latino origin and a second that asked them to\nchoose a category of race that best describes them. We constructed six\ncategories: Hispanic, black or African American (not Hispanic), Asian/\nPacific Islander, white (not Hispanic), Native American/American\nIndian, and Other. As described above, we limited our population to\nthose who identified as Hispanic, white, or black. We then constructed\nsubpopulations within the Hispanic population based on responses to\nthe question, \"What is your Hispanic/Latino background?\" (Mexican,\nChicano/a, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South American, and Other\nHispanic). We combined Mexican American and Chicano due to the\nsmall number who self-identified as Chicano. Due to additional small\npopulation numbers, we also combined Central/South American with\nOther Hispanic and anyone who chose more than one category.\nWe chose to examine measures of socioeconomic status from Wave I\nrather than Wave III. The participants in Wave III ranged in age from\n18 to 27. This age range represents a developmental period of incred-\nible flux with regards to socioeconomic status; the income reported\nduring this time may be misleading because some people are in school\narticles\n \n(\nundergraduate or graduate), while others are in the workforce. Thus, we\nused the Wave I parental report of the highest grade of education achieved\nby the participant's mother and the total household income over the last\nyear. After performing sensitivity analyses, we collapsed the maternal\neducation variable into a dichotomous variable (less than college degree\nvs. college graduate or beyond). We transformed the household income\nvariable into a continuous measure that was a ratio of household income\nrelative to the poverty level (taking into consideration the household size\nthen comparing it to poverty thresholds in 1995, the year the data were\ncollected). As mentioned above, responses for maternal education and\nhousehold income were lower than other response rates because they\nrelied on the parental responses and thus, we present findings using the\nimputed values.\nWe included additional variables that we theorized may impact weight\nstatus. These included history of pregnancy (yes/no), familial obesity\n(defined as having at least one obese parent yes/no), work status (having\na job and/or being a student vs. reporting neither having a job nor being\na student), US native (born in the United States), physical activity (the\nnumber of times in the last 7 days participated in some activity), and\nsmoking status (current smoker vs. nonsmoker).\nAnalyses\nIn all models, we accounted for the complex survey design using svy\ncommands in STATA and applied weights to account for the unequal\nlikelihood of being sampled for certain subpopulations. We performed\nbivariate analyses of our covariates of interest with our outcome variable\ntotestforsignificantrelationships.Inourmultivariateregressionmodels,\nwe initially looked at relationships in our overall sample. Because of our\na priori hypotheses, we then looked at models stratified by race/ethnic-\nity. We performed additional sensitivity analyses within our racial/ethnic\ngroups stratified by ever having been pregnant as well as by age 22 vs.\nage 23. Regression diagnostic procedures showed no evidence of multi-\ncollinearity, heteroscedasticity, or substantial influence from outliers.\nResults\nBlack and Hispanic females had significantly higher BMIs com-\n26.0kg/m2) (Figure 1) and were more likely to be overweight\nor obese (57.2% of blacks, 53.4% of Hispanics were overweight\nor obese compared to 42.7% of whites). Black females reported\nwatching TV more h/week than either Hispanics or whites\n(15h/week for black females vs. 11 for both Hispanic and\nwhite females) (Figure 2). There were also significant differ-\nences between the socioeconomic status of the different races/\nethnicities with whites having higher parent-reported house-\nhold income than either blacks or Hispanics and being more\nlikely to have a mother who completed college (Table 1). Black\nfemales were nearly twice as likely as white females to report\never having been pregnant. All three groups had high levels of\nparticipation in either work or school.\nThe results for our multivariate models with the three racial/\nethnic groups (blacks, Hispanics, and whites) combined and\nwith the subpopulations of Hispanics separated are shown in\nTable 2. In this model, BMI increased with greater time spent\nwatching TV. Those who watch 8\u00ad14h/week had BMIs that\nwere on average 0.8kg/m2 higher and those who watch >14h/\nweek had BMIs that were on average 1.2kg/m2 higher than\nthose who watched 7h/week. In this overall model, black,\nMexican-American, and Puerto Rican females were all signifi-\ncantly heavier than their white peers. Having at least one obese\nparent was associated with a 3.7kg/m2 increase in BMI relative\nto those without an obese parent.\nWe next stratified our results by race/ethnicity (Table 3).\nAmong white females we observed a similar relationship\nbetween TV viewing and BMI as in the overall population.\nHowever, among both black and Hispanic subpopulations,\nwe found no association between TV viewing and BMI. In an\nadditional model, we examined the effect of TV viewing across\nsubpopulations of Hispanics and found no difference in the\nmagnitude of the association (P > 0.05 for all interaction terms\nof Hispanic subpopulations \u00d7 TV viewing; data not shown).\nBecause pregnancy rates varied by race/ethnicity, in a sec-\nondary analyses, we assessed the impact of pregnancy on the\nWhite Black Hispanic\nBMI\nFigure 1 Average BMI by race/ethnicity.\n*Blacks and Hispanics are significantly different from whites (P < 0.05),\nbut not from each other.\nWhite Black Hispanic\nTV viewing (hours/week)\nFigure 2 Amount of television (TV) viewed (h/week) by race/ethnicity.\n*Blacks, TV viewing per week is significantly different than whites, and\nTable 1Demographic, familial, and health factors by race/\nethnicity\nWhite\nBlack\nHispanic\n% With a college educated\nmomb\n% With at least one obese\nparentb\n% Engaged in job and/or\nschoolb\naBlacks and Hispanics are significantly different from whites (P < 0.05). bP < 0.05\nindicating an association between the variable and race.\narticles\n \nrelationship between TV viewing and BMI across racial/ethnic\ngroups. We did not observe a significant interaction between\nhistory of pregnancy and TV viewing in any of the racial/\nethnic groups. Moreover, models stratified on history of preg-\nnancy did not yield materially different results. We also exam-\nined the effect of US nativity, smoking, and physical activity in\nour models and found no association (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrates that increased TV viewing is associated\nwithincreasedBMIinanationallyrepresentativesampleofyoung\nwomen,butthattheassociationdiffersbyracialandethnicgroup.\nAmong non-Hispanic whites, after controlling for age, parental\nBMI, maternal education, income, pregnancy history, and educa-\ntion or job status, there was a significant association between TV\nviewing and BMI. However, this study did not find an association\nbetween TV viewing and BMI in black or Hispanic women either\nbefore or after controlling for known and suspected confound-\ners. This lack of an association is consistent with findings from\nblacks watched more hours of TV than the whites and Hispanics\nin the study, one possible explanation would be that the major-\nity of blacks are beyond some threshold effect for TV exposure.\nAlthough mean hours of TV viewing were higher in blacks than\nin other racial/ethnic groups in this study, there was still consid-\nerable variation in viewing hours among blacks and the distribu-\ntion of their viewing hours overlapped considerably with those of\nwhites and Hispanics. Therefore, a threshold effect is unlikely to\nbe the reason that an association was not identified.\nAnother possibility is that blacks interact with TV media\ndifferently than whites. Although shows popular with blacks\nhave been documented as having more overweight characters\nand more food commercials (31), it is possible that blacks are\nless susceptible to the effects of TV advertising than whites.\nAlthough there is some self-reported data suggesting that\nblacks are more likely than whites to eat while watching TV\n(32), little is known about what individuals are actually doing\nwhile the TV is on. Some have hypothesized that because the\nTV is more likely to be on throughout the day in black homes,\nreported TV viewing hours may not actually be watched with\nfull attention and therefore may have less of an impact (26).\nA third possibility is that TV is too minor a factor in the lives\nof black Americans relative to other \"obesogenic\" aspects of\ntheir environment. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely than\nwhites to live in neighborhoods with fewer supermarkets, fewer\nparks, more fast food establishments, higher crime, inadequate\nrecreational areas, to be from single-parented, lower income\nhouseholds, and to skip breakfast (33). Lower socioeconomic\nstatus is consistently associated with higher rates of obesity\nand this relationship is likely mediated by many of the factors\nnoted above. A study by Singh et al., which did find an associa-\ntion between TV viewing and BMI in blacks, noted that this\nassociation was stronger in those from higher socioeconomic\ngroups (23), perhaps because fewer other negative factors were\npresent. Maternal education, a marker for socioeconomic sta-\ntus, was indeed significantly associated with BMI in the model\nfor blacks in our study, although TV viewing was not.\nThis study also did not find an association between TV\nviewing and BMI among Hispanic females. Hispanic par-\nticipants have not been included in studies as often as non-\nHispanic blacks and whites and thus the relationship between\nTV viewing and BMI in Hispanic females is less clear. Results\nfrom previous studies of TV viewing and BMI among nation-\nally representative and ethnically diverse samples have been\ninconsistent. One reason for the inconsistent findings among\nHispanics may be their ethnic diversity and levels of accultura-\ntion, which lead to different health beliefs, behaviors, and out-\ncomes (34). However, when we subdivided the Hispanics in\nthis study by country of origin, we still found no relationship\nTable 2Characteristics and behaviors associated with BMI\namong 6,049 young adult females in Add Health\na s.e.

This is surprising given the\nheterogeneity of the Hispanic population, but may be related\nto the small numbers of individuals in each subgroup and the\nlack of adequate power to find differences among them.\nThere are several important limitations to this study. First,\nthis is a cross-sectional study and therefore a causal relation-\nship between TV viewing and obesity in young women can-\nnot be demonstrated by this analysis. It is possible that those\nyoung women who were already overweight or obese preferred\nto watch TV because they were physically less able to be active.\nIt is also possible that increased TV viewing is a marker of\nanother factor associated with obesity that we did not meas-\nure, such as depression. However, while the majority of studies\nexamining the relationship between TV viewing and obes-\nity have been cross-sectional, a few longitudinal studies have\ndemonstrated a link between early TV use and obesity later in\nthere is indeed a causal relationship.\nSecond, this study used self-reported measures of TV view-\ning. Results are therefore subject to social desirability and\nsocial approval bias given that some individuals may have\nchosen to under-report their sedentary behaviors. Indeed,\nindividuals with high scores on instruments measuring social\ndesirability have been shown to over-report physical activity\n(36) and under-report calorie intake (37) when compared to\nobjective measures of these behaviors. Furthermore, there is\nevidence that blacks and Mexican Americans score higher on\nsocial desirability scales and use more extreme categories on\nLikert scales as compared to whites (38). Under-reporting TV\nviewing would be expected to bias results toward the null, so it\nis possible that under-reporting of viewing time by blacks and\nHispanics contributed to our inability to find an association in\nthese groups.\nIn conclusion, TV viewing is related to BMI in a diverse\nsample of young adult women, but the relationship is complex\nand inconsistent across racial/ethnic subgroups. We believe\nproviders should continue to recommend limiting TV view-\ning when counseling young women on healthy habits, given\nthat TV viewing is a modifiable behavior, whereas other fac-\ntors associated with BMI such as socioeconomic status are less\nquickly and easily changed. But they should understand that\nwomen from certain racial and ethnic minority groups may\nderive less of a benefit on weight status from reductions in\nTV viewing time. Policy initiatives and public education cam-\npaigns aimed at changing the content of food advertising on\nTV may also be expected to yield mixed results. More work is\nneeded to identify the factors driving the obesity epidemic in\nyoung black and Hispanic women, as these groups are particu-\nlarly impacted by obesity.\n"
