    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nMyD88 KO (knockout) mice are exquisitely sensitive to CNS\n(central nervous system) infection with Staphylococcus\naureus, a common aetiological agent of brain abscess,\nexhibiting global defects in innate immunity and exacer-\nbated tissue damage. However, since brain abscesses are\ntypified by the involvement of both activated CNS-resident\nand infiltrating immune cells, in our previous studies it has\nbeen impossible to determine the relative contribution of\nMyD88-dependent signalling in the CNS compared with\nthe peripheral immune cell compartments. In the present\nstudy we addressed this by examining the course of S.\naureus infection in MyD88 bone marrow chimaera mice.\nInterestingly, chimaeras where MyD88 was present in the\nCNS, but not bone marrow-derived cells, mounted pro-\ninflammatory mediator expression profiles and neutrophil\nrecruitment equivalent to or exceeding that detected in WT\n(wild-type) mice. These results implicate CNS MyD88 as\nessential in eliciting the initial wave of inflammation during\nthe acute response to parenchymal infection. Microarray\nanalysis of infected MyD88 KO compared with WT mice\nrevealed a preponderance of differentially regulated genes\ninvolved in apoptotic pathways, suggesting that the\nextensive tissue damage characteristic of brain abscesses\nfrom MyD88 KO mice could result from dysregulated\napoptosis. Collectively, the findings of the present study\nhighlight a novel mechanism for CNS-resident cells in\ninitiating a protective innate immune response in the\ninfected brain and, in the absence of MyD88 in this\ncompartment, immunity is compromised.\n",

Brain abscesses\ncan form by bacterial perforation of the thin bony structures\nseparating the brain from neighbouring sites of chronic\ninfection occurring in the paranasal sinuses, middle ear, or\nupper molars. Other routes include seeding of the brain with\nbacterial emboli originating from systemic sites of infection\n(i.e. endocarditis or septicemia) (Mathisen and Johnson, 1997)\nwhere the frontal and temporal lobes are most commonly\npenetrating trauma to the head, or following neurosurgery\nabscesses ensue in response to a diverse array of pathogens,\nstreptococcal species and Staphylococcus aureus represent\nthe most common aetiological agents of infection in humans.\nInnate immunity plays an essential role in the host\nresponse to bacterial infections.

For example, bacterial lipopro-\nteins and PGN (peptidoglycan) can trigger TLR1 and TLR2,\nwhereas bacterial DNA can stimulate TLR9 in endosomal\nBased on this complexity it is expected that numerous\nreceptors are engaged following bacterial infection in the\nbrain. This is supported by our previous studies demonstrating\nthat brain abscess pathogenesis following S. aureus infection\nwas not markedly affected by the loss of TLR2 (Kielian et al.,\n2005). Therefore a broader role for additional recognition\nmolecules sensing bacterial infection was apparent.\nMyD88 is a central adaptor molecule for the majority of\nTLRs, with the exception of TLR3 (Akira, 2006; O'Neill and\nBowie, 2007). This molecule is also responsible for transdu-\ncing activation signals emanating from the IL-1R [IL\nSince IL-1 and IL-18 have been shown to have important roles\nin anti-bacterial immunity, coupled with the pivotal role of\nMyD88-dependent pathways in bacterial recognition and the\ninduction of downstream cytokine signalling networks,\nMyD88 represents a central converging point in the innate\ninflammatory pathway. Indeed, recent studies from our\nlaboratory have demonstrated the essential role of MyD88-\ndependent mechanism(s) in mounting a productive host\ninnate immune response during the acute stage of brain\nabscess development (Kielian et al., 2007). Studies by other\ngroups have also established the importance of MyD88-\ndependent pathways in the innate immune response to\nGram-positive infections in both the CNS and periphery\nAlthough our previous report demonstrated an essential\nand non-redundant role for MyD88 in eliciting an innate\nimmune response during brain abscess development (Kielian\nwas more important in CNS-resident compared with\ninfiltrating immune cells since the molecule was globally\nabsent in KO (knockout) mice. To address this question, we\nengineered radiation bone marrow chimaera mice where\nMyD88 was differentially expressed in the CNS compared\nwith the peripheral immune cell compartments.\nUnexpectedly, the results demonstrated that MyD88 express-\nion in the CNS was required to mount an innate immune\nresponse equivalent to WT (wild-type) during the acute stage\nof brain abscess development. The requirement for MyD88 in\nCNS-resident cells was reinforced by the finding that\nneutrophil influx into the infected brain was only achieved\nin chimaeric mice where MyD88 was present in the CNS. This\nis probably due to the fact that numerous neutrophil\nchemokines were restored to WT levels only in animals where\nMyD88 was expressed in the CNS compartment.\nCuriously, our previous study demonstrated that, despite\nglobal defects in innate immunity, bacterial burdens\nremained relatively consistent between MyD88 KO and WT\nmice, suggesting that mechanisms other than bacterial\nburdens themselves were responsible for the enhanced\nsusceptibility of MyD88 KO mice to CNS S. aureus infection\n(Kielian et al., 2007). In the present study, we performed\ntranscriptional profiling with Illumina microarrays to identify\npathways that were differentially regulated by MyD88 during\nbrain abscess development that might provide some insights\ninto why these animals succumb so quickly to infection,\ndespite having relatively equivalent bacterial burdens as WT\nanimals. These studies revealed a preponderance of differ-\nentially regulated genes involved in apoptotic pathways,\nsuggesting that the extensive tissue damage characteristic of\nbrain abscesses from MyD88 KO mice could result from\ndysregulated apoptosis. Collectively, these results reveal an\nessential role for MyD88 in CNS-resident cells that triggers a\nprotective innate immune response within the first 24 h\nfollowing intracerebral infection with S. aureus.\nMice\nAll animal use protocols were approved by the University of\nArkansas for Medical Sciences Institutional Animal Care and\nUse Committee and are in accordance with the National\nInstitutes of Health guidelines for the use of rodents.

For the generation of bone marrow chimaeras, B6/\nSJL mice that are congenic for the CD45 allele (CD45.1) on a\nC57BL/6 background were purchased from Jackson\nLaboratories. Mice were used between 10 and 12 weeks of\nage for all brain abscess studies.\nGeneration of MyD88 radiation bone marrow\nchimaera mice\nFor generating MyD88 bone marrow chimaeras, CD45\ncongenic B6/SJL mice were used where only one allele,\nCD45.1, originates from the SJL strain, whereas the remainder\nof the genome is derived from C57BL/6 mice.

The\nfollowing radiation chimaeras were generated in these\nexperiments (donor bone marrowRirradiated recipient):\nWTRWT, KORKO, WTRKO and KORWT. The experimental\nchimaeras were WTRKO and KORWT, whereas the other two\ngroups (WTRWT and KORKO) represented controls to rule\nout any non-specific effects of irradiation on immune\nactivation. The latter could be verified by confirming that\nthe inflammatory profiles of irradiated control groups\nobtained in the present study (WTRWT and KORKO) were\nsimilar to those observed in non-irradiated MyD88 WT and KO\nmice as reported recently (Kielian et al., 2007). CNS\nparenchymal cells are radiation-resistant and maintain the\nhost phenotype following radiation exposure (Hickey and\nMyD88 KO animals with bone marrow from WT recipients\nensured that cells derived from the bone marrow expressed\nthis molecule along with CNS perivascular cells (Hickey and\nmal microglia would not express MyD88 as a result of their\nradioresistance. The procedure for bone marrow chimaera\ngeneration was based on previously published studies with\nminor modifications (Hickey and Kimura, 1988; Byram et al.,\n2005). Briefly, bone marrow donor mice were euthanized with\nan overdose of inhaled isoflurane and marrow was isolated\nfrom the long bones by flushing with sterile 16PBS.\nRecipient mice were placed on antibiotic-supplemented\nwater (1 g/l neomycin and 125 mg/l polymyxin) for 4 days\nprior to bone marrow transfer and subjected to irradiation\n(1000 rad) using a J.L. Shepherd Model i45 caesium irradiator\nto destroy the marrow. Within 4 h following irradiation,\nrecipient mice received an i.v. (intravenous) injection of\nfrom the spleen to serve as an immediate source of immune\ncells. Engraftment was allowed to take place over a 6\u00ad8 week\nperiod and chimaeric animals were maintained on antibiotic-\nsupplemented water for the first 2 weeks to provide\nprotection during transient immunocompromise. At 6\u00ad8\nweeks post-transplant, chimaeric mice were bled retro-\norbitally and cells were stained for flow cytometric analysis\nchimaerism of greater than 90% were used in brain abscess\nstudies. Animals were evaluated for their responses to an\nintracerebral inoculation of S. aureus at approx. 10\u00ad12 weeks\nfollowing bone marrow transfer, a period that we, and others\nal., 2004), have established to be sufficient for establishing\nchimaerism. We found that bone marrow chimaeras gener-\nated with B6/SJL and MyD88 KO mice did not exhibit any\nevidence of graft versus host disease, indicating that this was\nnot a confounding issue.\nGeneration of experimental brain abscess\nLive S. aureus (strain RN6390) was encapsulated in agarose\nbeads prior to implantation in the brain as previously\ndescribed (Kielian et al., 2001). Previous studies from our\nlaboratory have established that the introduction of sterile\nagarose beads does not induce overt inflammation or\nperipheral immune cell infiltrates (Kielian et al., 2001;\nBaldwin and Kielian, 2004). To induce brain abscesses, mice\nwere anaesthetized with 2.5% avertin i.p. (intraperitoneally)\nand a 1 cm longitudinal incision was made along the vertex\nof the skull extending from the ear to the eye. A rodent\nstereotaxic apparatus equipped with a Cunningham mouse\nadaptor (Stoelting) was used to implant S. aureus-encapsu-\nlated beads into the caudate/putamen region using the\nfollowing co-ordinates relative to bregma: +1.0 mm rostral,\n+2.0 mm lateral, and 23.0 mm deep from the surface of the\nbrain. A burr hole was made and a 5 ml Hamilton syringe\nfitted with a 26-gauge bevelled needle was used to slowly\ndeliver 2 ml of beads [104 CFUs (colony forming units)] into\nthe brain parenchyma. The needle remained in place for 2.5\nmin following injection to minimize bead efflux and potential\nleakage into the meninges. The incision was closed using\nsurgical glue.\nPreparation of brain abscess homogenates\nTo prepare brain abscess homogenates for downstream\nprotein and RNA analysis, lesion sites were visualized by the\nstab wound created during injections and were sectioned\nwithin 1\u00ad2 mm on all sides. Upon recovery, brain abscesses\nwere homogenized in 500 ml of PBS supplemented with a\nCompleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) and 160\nunits/ml RNAse inhibitor (Promega) using a Polytron\nhomogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). At this point, a 20\nml aliquot of abscess homogenate was removed for\nquantitative culture of viable bacteria as described below.\nSubsequently, homogenates were centrifuged at 21 000 g for\n15 min at 4\u00b0C to pellet membrane material, and supernatants\nwere removed and stored at 270\u00b0C until ELISA and multi-\nplex cytokine microbead array analysis as described below.\nQuantification of viable bacteria from brain\nabscesses\nTo quantify the numbers of viable bacteria associated with\nbrain abscesses, serial 10-fold dilutions of abscess homo-\ngenates were plated on to blood agar plates.

This microbead array allowed for\nthe simultaneous detection of 20 individual inflammatory\nmolecules in a single 50 ml brain abscess homogenate sample\nincluding IL-1a, IL-1b, TNF-a (tumour necrosis factor-a), IFN-\ninduced by IFN-c), MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1),\nKC (chemokine CXCL1), GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage\ncolony-stimulating factor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth\nfactor) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor). Results\nwere analysed using a Bio-Plex Workstation (Bio-Rad) and\nadjusted based on the amount of total protein extracted from\nabscess tissues for normalization. The level of sensitivity for\neach microbead cytokine standard curve ranged from 1 to 35\npg/ml.\nImmunofluorescence staining and confocal\nmicroscopy\nNeutrophil and microglia/macrophage accumulation in brain\nabscesses from MyD88 bone marrow chimaera mice were\nevaluated by immunofluorescence staining using Gr-1 and\nIba-1 respectively. For these studies, mice were infected with\n(green fluorescent protein) under the control of the RNAIII\npromoter (a gift of Dr Ambrose Cheung, Dartmouth Medical\nSchool, Hanover, NH, U.S.A.) to visualize bacterial dissemina-\ntion in tissue sections. At the indicated time points post-\nmice were perfused transcardially to eliminate leucocytes\nfrom the vasculature, whereupon brains were removed and\nimmediately flash-frozen on dry ice. These early time intervals\nwere required since the survival period of MyD88 KO mice did\nnot extend much beyond this time point (Kielian et al., 2007).\nPrior to cryostat sectioning, brain tissues were embedded in\nOCT (optimal cutting temperature) medium, whereupon serial\n10 mm sections were made throughout the entire lesioned\ntissue, mounted on to SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher\nScientific), air-dried, and stored at 280\u00b0C until use. For Gr-1\nstaining, fresh frozen tissues were analysed; however, to\ndetect Iba-1 immunoreactivity, tissue sections were post-\nfixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 1 h, since strong\nreactivity with this antibody was not detected in freshly\nfrozen sections. Tissues were incubated with either rat anti-\nmouse Gr-1 (BD Biosciences) or rabbit anti-mouse Iba-1\n(Biocare Medical) antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified\nchamber. Following numerous rinses in PBS, Gr-1 staining\nwas detected with a mouse anti-rat IgG-HRP (horseradish\nperoxidase)-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room\ntemperature (25\u00b0C) and visualized using a TSA-Alexa FluorH\n594 kit (Invitrogen). For Iba-1 detection, a rabbit ImmPRESS\nkit (Vector Laboratories) was used in conjunction with a TSA-\nAlexa FluorH 594 kit. Upon completion of the staining\nprotocols, slides were coverslipped using the Prolong anti-\nfade reagent (Invitrogen) and sealed using nail polish. Slides\nwere imaged using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal micro-\nscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss Microimaging). Specific staining of\nantibodies was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence\nsignal following incubation of brain abscess tissues with\nsecondary antibodies alone (results not shown).\nRNA isolation and Illumina oligonucleotide\nmicroarray\nTotal RNA from brain abscesses of MyD88 KO and WT mice\nwas isolated using TRIzolH reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected\nto DNAse treatment prior to use in microarray studies. RNA\nconcentrations and integrity were determined with an\nTranscriptional profiling of changes in gene expression\nbetween S. aureus-infected MyD88 KO and WT mice was\ndetermined using Illumina Sentrix MouseRef-8 Expression\nBeadChips (Illumina). For these experiments, RNA samples\nfrom four individual animals/group/time point were analysed\nto account for biological variability. Total RNA was used to\ngenerate biotin-labelled cRNA using the Illumina TotalPrep\nRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, catalogue number IL1791).\nBriefly, 0.5 mg of total RNA was first converted into single-\nstranded cDNA with reverse transcriptase using an oligo-dT\nprimer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter site and\nthen copied to produce double-stranded cDNA molecules. The\ndouble-stranded cDNA was cleaned and concentrated with\nthe supplied columns and used in an overnight in vitro\ntranscription reaction where single-stranded RNA (cRNA) was\ngenerated and labelled by incorporation of biotin-16-UTP. A\ntotal of 0.75 mg of biotin-labelled cRNA was hybridized at\n58\u00b0C for 16 h to Illumina's Sentrix MouseRef-8 Expression\nBeadChips. Each BeadChip has 24 000 well-annotated RefSeq\ntranscripts with approx. 30-fold redundancy. The arrays were\nwashed, blocked, and the labelled cRNA was detected by\nstaining with streptavidin-Cy3. The arrays were scanned using\nan Illumina BeadStation 500X Genetic Analysis Systems\nscanner and the image data was extracted using the\nIllumina BeadStudio software, version 3.0.\nMicroarray data analysis and statistical methods\nThe expression data were filtered to include only probes with\na consistent signal on each chip; the probe original signal\nfilter value was established at a detection P value,0.02.

An overview\nof DIANE can be found online at http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/\nbranches/rrb/dna/diane_software.pdf. Using DIANE, the\nresults were normalized with a Z-score transformation\n(Cheadle et al., 2003). Z-normalized data were then analysed\nwith PCA (principal component analysis). To determine the\ngene expression changes caused by each specific RNA\ncomparison, Z-scores for paired treatment groups were\ncompared using the Z-ratio statistic (Cheadle et al., 2003):\nZ-ratio~\nZ-scoreLPS\n{Z-scorevehicle\ns Z-scoreLPS\n{Z-scorevehicle\n\u00bd \nExpression changes for individual genes were considered\nsignificant if they met four criteria: Z-ratio above 1.5 or\nless than 0.30; a P value statistic for Z-score replicability\nbelow 0.05; and mean background-corrected signal intensity\ngreater than zero.\nqRT-PCR [quantitative real-time RT (reverse\ntranscriptase)-PCR]\nTo confirm a subset of differentially expressed genes from\nmicroarray studies, qRT-PCR was performed as previously\ndescribed (Kielian et al., 2004b). ABI Assays on Demand kits\nwere used to examine Lcn2 (lipocalin-2), Pacsin3 (protein\nkinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 3), Ier3/IEX\n(immediate early response 3), Pfc (complement factor\nproperdin) and SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 3)\nexpression, whereas GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase) primers and the TAMRA TaqMan probe were\nsynthesized by ABI based on previously published sequences\nStatistics\nSignificant differences between the various MyD88 bone\nmarrow chimaera experimental groups were determined\nusing one-way ANOVA followed by the Holm\u00adSidak method\nfor multiple pair-wise comparisons with Sigma Stat (SPSS\nScience). For comparisons in gene expression profiles between\nMyD88 KO and WT mice by qRT-PCR the Student's t test was\nused.\nRESULTS\nMyD88 expression in the CNS compartment is\nessential for achieving maximal inflammatory\nresponses to intracerebral S. aureus infection\nRecent studies from our laboratory have identified an\nessential role for MyD88-dependent pathways in initiating\ninnate immune responses to S. aureus during the acute stage\nof brain abscess formation (Kielian et al., 2007). However, the\nrelative importance of MyD88 within the CNS compartment\ncompared with infiltrating peripheral immune cells was\nuncertain, since prior studies utilized MyD88 KO mice where\nthis adaptor was globally absent. To address this question, we\ngenerated chimaeric animals using B6.SJL congenic mice that\nexpress the CD45.1 allele, allowing the discrimination\nbetween donor and recipient cells based on the fact that\nMyD88 KO mice are on a C57BL/6 background and express\nCD45.2. In pilot studies, we carefully titrated the dose of\nionizing radiation administered to recipient mice to ablate\nthe bone marrow without inducing toxicity to the gastro-\nintestinal tract (results not shown). Mice were evaluated at 8\nweeks following bone marrow transfer to assess the degree of\nexpression on peripheral blood leucocytes by FACS. A\nrepresentative FACS screen of bone marrow chimaera mice\nis provided in Figure 1. For these experiments, a total of four\nbone marrow treatment groups were compared. The two\nexperimental groups consisted of mice where MyD88 was\npresent in the CNS but not in bone marrow-derived cells (i.e.\nKORWT; Group 1) and vice versa (i.e. WTRKO; Group 2),\nwhereas bone marrow transfers into genetically identical\nmice (i.e. KORKO and WTRWT; Groups 3 and 4 respectively)\nwere also performed to rule out any non-specific effects of\nionizing radiation on the responses obtained. The latter could\nbe verified by confirming that the inflammatory profiles of\nirradiated control groups obtained in the present study\n(WTRWT and KORKO) were similar to those observed in\nnon-irradiated MyD88 WT and KO mice as reported recently\n(Kielian et al., 2007). Although chimaeric mice were screened\nat 8 weeks following bone marrow transfer, animals were not\ninfected with S. aureus until 10\u00ad12 weeks after transplanta-\ntion. Any mice that demonstrated incomplete chimaerism\n(i.e..10% residual recipient phenotype) were excluded from\nthe study.\nAs previously reported, MyD88 KO mice do not survive very\nlong following intracerebral S. aureus infection, with the\nmajority of animals succumbing within 24 h after bacterial\nexposure with the infectious inoculum used in the earlier and\ndictated the time course for analysing the current experi-\nments, since we were restricted by the survival time of mice\nwhere MyD88 KO bone marrow was transferred into\nirradiated MyD88 KO recipients (KORKO). Therefore we\nexamined the entire cohort of bone marrow chimaera animals\nat two acute intervals, namely 18 and 24 h following S.\naureus infection. As shown in Figure 2, numerous pro-\ninflammatory cytokines and chemokines were already\ndetected in WT control mice (WTRWT) at these early time\npoints and were significantly attenuated in MyD88 KO\ncontrol mice (KORKO) in agreement with our previous\nreport using non-irradiated animals (Kielian et al., 2007),\nsuggesting that the irradiation paradigm itself did not\nsignificantly alter the inflammatory phenotype of MyD88\nCNS MyD88 in brain abscesses\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nKO and WT mice. Next we assessed which of the experimental\nchimaeras achieved cytokine expression profiles that were\nequivalent to WT levels, which would implicate a compart-\nmental-specific contribution for MyD88-dependent signals.\nAs shown in Figure 2, chimaeras where MyD88 was present in\nthe CNS but not in bone marrow-derived cells (KORWT) were\nable to mount pro-inflammatory mediator expression profiles\nequivalent to or exceeding those detected in WT mice at both\n18 and 24 h post-infection. This finding implicates CNS\nMyD88 as essential in eliciting the initial wave of inflam-\nmation during the acute response to parenchymal infection.\nIn contrast, the inflammatory phenotype of chimaeric mice\nwhere MyD88 was absent in the CNS compartment but\npresent in infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells (WTRKO)\nwas basically identical with MyD88 KO control mice (KORKO;\nFigure 2). This finding reinforces the importance of MyD88 in\nthe brain to elicit an effective innate immune response to S.\naureus and that MyD88 originating from peripheral immune\ncells alone is not sufficient to recover inflammatory mediator\nexpression to WT levels.\nCNS MyD88 dictates the degree of neutrophil\ninflux into S. aureus-induced brain abscesses\nOur previous study with MyD88 KO mice demonstrated that\nneutrophil influx into brain abscesses was significantly\nattenuated in these animals (Kielian et al., 2007). In the\npresent study, we examined whether MyD88 in the CNS or\nperipheral immune cell compartment was important for\ndictating neutrophil entry into the infected brain. For these\nstudies we utilized immunofluorescence staining and con-\nfocal microscopy with an S. aureus strain that constitutively\nexpresses GFP. Importantly, this S. aureus-GFP strain is\nFigure 1 Validation of MyD88 bone marrow chimaera mice by FACS analysis\nPeripheral blood leucocytes were recovered from MyD88 bone marrow chimaeric mice at 8 weeks following irradiation and bone\nmarrow reconstitution, whereupon CD45.1 (B6/SJL origin) and CD45.2 (MyD88 KO origin) expression was evaluated by FACS.

As shown in Figure 3,\nneutrophil influx was readily apparent in abscesses of WT\ncontrol mice (WTRWT), whereas very few cells could be\nvisualized in lesions of MyD88 KO control animals (KORKO),\nin agreement with our previous report (Kielian et al., 2007). In\nconcordance with the finding that chemokine expression was\nrestored to WT levels in bone marrow chimaera where MyD88\nwas present in the CNS compartment (KORWT), significant\nnumbers of neutrophils were associated with brain abscesses\nof these chimaeras, reaching levels that were equivalent to\nWT mice (WTRWT; Figure 3). In contrast, minimal neutrophil\ninflux was detected in chimaeras where MyD88 was only\npresent in bone marrow-derived cells and absent in the CNS\n(WTRKO; Figure 3). We did not perform quantitative\nmeasurements of PMN (polymorphonuclear cell) infiltrates\nby FACS in the various chimaera groups owing to limiting\nnumbers of mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that\nMyD88 expression in resident CNS cells is critical for dictating\nsubsequent neutrophil efflux into the infected brain.\nImportantly, these findings mirror chemokine expression\nprofiles (Figure 2), providing additional supportive evidence\nfor the important role of central MyD88 in initiating the\ninflammatory cascade required for CNS amplification of\ninflammatory networks to recruit peripheral anti-microbial\neffector cells.\nNeutrophil and microglia/macrophages occupy\ndistinct anatomical niches during S. aureus\ninfection in the CNS parenchyma\nThe use of a S. aureus-GFP isolate enabled us to evaluate the\ncell type(s) intimately associated with bacteria in the CNS\nparenchyma. A consistent trend surfaced where neutrophils\nwere in direct contact with bacteria (Figure 4), whereas\nmicroglia/macrophages were never found associated with S.\naureus, but rather were physically removed from the bacteria\nand localized along the abscess margins. The physical locales\nof these cell types are probably attributed to their effector\nfunctions during brain abscess development. For example,\nneutrophils are essential for controlling bacterial burdens and\nthe extent of brain abscess dissemination (Kielian et al.,\nFigure 2 MyD88 in the CNS compartment is important for regulating pro-inflammatory mediator expression in brain abscesses\nAbscess homogenates from MyD88 bone marrow chimaeras (n54\u00ad6 mice per group) were prepared at 18 or 24 h following S. aureus\ninfection, whereupon inflammatory mediator expression was analysed at the protein level using multi-plex microbead arrays.\nMediator levels were normalized to the amount of total protein to account for differences in tissue sampling size.

It is not clear what\nmechanism(s) are responsible for enhanced bacterial burdens\nin MyD88 WTRKO chimaeras, but one possibility could relate\nto the recent observation that some bacterial species possess\nhomologues of the TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) domain to subvert\nhost defences (Cirl et al., 2008), and it is conceivable that this\nmechanism could result in the failure to contain bacterial\nburdens in the presence of MyD88 WT leucocytes. An\nalternative explanation is that MyD88-positive leucocytes\ninfiltrating the brain parenchyma do not receive a requisite\nsignal(s) from the brain microenvironment in the absence of\nMyD88, culminating in ineffective bacterial neutralization.\nThese possibilities remain highly speculative at the present\ntime. Collectively, these results indicate that CNS-derived\nMyD88 signals influence the efficacy of ensuing bactericidal\neffector mechanisms.\nTranscriptional profiling of MyD88 KO mice\nfollowing intracerebral S. aureus infection\nreveals alterations in apoptosis regulatory\npathways\nPrevious studies with MyD88 KO mice in the experimental\nbrain abscess model revealed that, although these animals\nwere incapable of mounting a significant innate immune\nresponse and experienced high mortality rates, paradoxically,\nthese mice did not exhibit significantly elevated bacterial\nburdens as compared with WT animals (Kielian et al., 2007).\nThis finding demonstrated that bacterial burdens themselves\nare not the sole determinant in dictating the extent of tissue\ninjury and/or mortality during brain abscess development. To\nbegin to dissect the potential mechanism(s) responsible for\nthe rapid decline of MyD88 KO mice following intracerebral S.\naureus infection, transcriptional profiling was performed.\nInterestingly, only a small subset of genes was found to be\ndifferentially expressed by microarray analysis and many of\nthese have been implicated in controlling apoptotic pathways\n(i.e. Erdr1, Ier3, Pdap1, Calm2, Hspca, Mtch1, and Ifitm1 and\n2; Table 1). Dysregulation of apoptotic pathways could\nconceivably be responsible, in part, for the excessive tissue\ndestruction observed in MyD88 KO mice (Kielian et al., 2007),\nwhere a combination of rampant necrotic and apoptotic\ndeath leads to the destruction of infected and neighbouring\nnon-infected brain parenchyma respectively. In addition,\nseveral genes detected by microarray analysis (i.e. CXCL1, IL-\n1b) have previously been shown to be down-regulated in\nbrain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice at the protein level\n(Kielian et al., 2007), confirming the validity of the microarray\nfindings to accurately distinguish changes in gene expression\nbetween the groups. However, to further confirm the\ndifferential expression patterns detected by microarray\nanalysis, we selected a subset of genes for validation by\nqRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 6, the expression patterns of the\nfive genes examined (Lcn2, SOCS3, Ier3, Pfc and Pascin3) were\nin agreement with the microarray findings, indicating that\nthese genes may impact the differential outcome of S. aureus\ninfection and widespread parenchymal destruction in the\nbrains of MyD88 KO mice. It should be noted that the\nrelatively low number of differentially expressed genes\ndetected between MyD88 KO and WT mice is probably the\nresult of our experimental design. Namely, we elected to\nperform microarrays on brain abscess RNA collected from\nindividual animals at each time point rather than pooling\nRNA from a group of animals. We felt this was important to\naccount for biological variability between individual mice\nand, as such, it is highly likely that the breadth of\ndifferentially expressed genes was underestimated by this\napproach. Collectively, these transcriptional profiling studies\nsuggest dysregulation of pro-inflammatory and apoptotic\ngenes in acute brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice. The\nfunctional role for each of these molecules in contributing to\nthe excessive parenchymal destruction observed following S.\naureus infection in MyD88 KO mice remains to be determined.\nFigure 4 Neutrophils and microglia/macrophages occupy distinct ana-\ntomical niches during acute S. aureus infection in the brain parenchyma\nWT mice received an intracerebral infection with a S. aureus-GFP strain\n(green) and were euthanized 24 h later, whereupon brain tissues were flash-\nfrozen on dry ice for subsequent cryostat sectioning.

Neutrophils are found to directly interact\nwith bacteria, whereas microglia/macrophage staining did not overlap with S.\naureus.

One main question that remained to be\nanswered was how important is MyD88 in the CNS\ncompartment? Does CNS MyD88 expression play a role in\nshaping the subsequent innate immune response following\nbacterial infection in the brain or are infiltrating leucocytes\nalone sufficient for establishing immunity? This issue could\nnot be resolved in our previous study since MyD88 was\nglobally absent in MyD88 KO mice and the fact that the brain\nabscess model is complicated by the involvement of both\nactivated CNS-resident and infiltrating immune cells both of\nwhich express this adaptor molecule (Kielian, 2004; Stenzel et\nin the present study by generating radiation bone marrow\nchimaera mice where MyD88 was specifically expressed in\neither CNS-resident cells or peripheral bone marrow-derived\nleucocytes.\nThe results from MyD88 bone marrow chimaera mice were\nrather unexpected given the essential nature of MyD88-\nFigure 5 Lack of MyD88 expression in the CNS compartment leads to\nelevated S. aureus burdens\nAbscess homogenates from MyD88 bone marrow chimaeras (n54\u00ad6 mice per\ngroup) were prepared at 18 or 24 h following S. aureus infection, whereupon\nthe number of viable bacteria were determined by quantitative plate assays.\nSignificant differences between chimaera groups were determined by one-\nway ANOVA followed by the Holm\u00adSidak method for multiple pair-wise\ncomparisons and are denoted with asterisks (**P,0.001).

In contrast, animals where\nMyD88 was present in bone marrow-derived cells, but not the\nCNS (i.e. WTRKO) did not display WT mediator expression.\nHowever, the finding that some inflammatory molecules were\nmore highly expressed in WTRKO chimaeras compared with\nMyD88 KO controls (i.e. KORKO) suggests a minor\ncontribution for peripheral MyD88 in shaping the innate\nimmune response during the first 24 h following S. aureus\ninfection. It should be acknowledged that we cannot discount\na potential role for MyD88 expression in the periphery during\nlater stages of infection. In fact, this possibility appears likely\nsince resident CNS cells (i.e. microglia and astrocytes),\nalthough immune competent, have relatively poor bacter-\nicidal activity compared with professional phagocytes (i.e.\nneutrophils and macrophages). In addition, since many gene\nproducts driven by MyD88 impact bacterial survival [i.e. iNOS\n(inducible NO synthase), ROI (reactive oxygen intermediates)\nand cytokines] it is likely that, with time, MyD88 signals\noriginating from bone marrow-derived leucocytes may\nbecome more important in regulating anti-bacterial immun-\nity in brain abscesses. However, this possibility could not be\nexamined in the current study due to the short survival\nperiod of infected MyD88 KO mice.\nA similar requirement for MyD88 expression in the CNS\ncompartment was observed when evaluating neutrophil\ninflux into the infected brain. Specifically, WT levels of\nneutrophil recruitment were only observed in chimaeras with\nMyD88 expression in the brain parenchyma (i.e. KORWT).\nThis finding probably stems from the fact that the expression\nof neutrophil chemokines was also restored to WT levels in\nthese chimaeras. It is important to note that radiation bone\nmarrow chimaera studies are not without potential caveats.\nFor example, irradiation has been shown to induce transient\nblood\u00adbrain barrier compromise and the expression of several\npro-inflammatory mediators (Belka et al., 2001; Diserbo et al.,\nthese factors influenced the results obtained in the present\nstudy is minimized by the fact that chimaeras were not\ninfected with S. aureus until 8 weeks post-transplant. Indeed,\na recent report has demonstrated that pro-inflammatory\nmolecule expression was similar between radiation chimaera\nand non-irradiated mice in response to intracerebral LPS\n(lipopolysaccharide) (Turrin et al., 2007). It has been\nsuggested that irradiation serves to condition the CNS for\nsubsequent colonization by bone marrow-derived cells that\neventually transition into microglia-like cells, although some\ncontroversy with regard to this latter point still exists\nminor percentage of parenchymal microglia in the present\nstudy originated from bone marrow precursors since we did\nnot shield the head during the irradiation procedure;\nnonetheless, our results clearly demonstrate an essential role\nfor MyD88 expression by CNS-resident cells in eliciting\nprotective immunity during early stages of brain abscess\ndevelopment.\nTo further investigate the potential pathway(s) affected by\nMyD88 loss during early brain abscess development, micro-\narray analysis was performed. Interestingly, many genes that\nwere differentially expressed in MyD88 KO mice were related\nto apoptosis, which may be due, in part, to the inability to\ntrigger NF-kB (nuclear factor kB) activation, a well known\nsuch gene was Ier3 (IEX-1), a stress-inducible gene that is\nrapidly up-regulated in response to a variety of factors\nincluding infection, inflammatory cytokines, and transcrip-\ntion factors such as NF-kB (Pietzsch et al., 1997;\nprevious study has demonstrated that IEX-1 expression is NF-\nkB- and TNF-a-dependent (Osawa et al., 2003) and, since\nboth molecules are significantly attenuated in MyD88 KO\nmice, this is in agreement with the reduction in IEX-1 levels\ndetected by microarray in these animals. Although IEX-1 has\nbeen shown to play a pivotal role in promoting cell survival in\net al., 2006), its functional impact on cell survival remains\ncontroversial and probably depends on cell type, stimulus,\nOsawa et al., 2003). Interestingly, a previous study has\ndemonstrated that IEX-1 reduces ROS (reactive oxygen\nspecies) production (Shen et al., 2006) and, by extension,\nattenuated IEX-1 levels in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice\ncould conceivably exacerbate ROS accumulation contributing\nto the massive tissue damage observed in these animals.\nHowever, these possibilities remain speculative at the present\ntime.\nAnother gene that was significantly down-regulated in\nbrain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice is Lcn2 [also referred to as\nNGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin)]. Similar to\nIEX-1, Lcn2 has also been implicated in regulating apoptosis\nand is produced by numerous cell types including macro-\nphages and neutrophils in response to infection (Kjeldsen et\n2007). Therefore, in the context of our brain abscess model, it\nis likely that reduced Lcn2 expression in MyD88 KO mice\nresulted from the fact that neutrophil and macrophage\ninfiltrates are decreased approx. 85% and 15% respectively,\ncompared with WT animals as we previously reported (Kielian\net al., 2007). In addition, a previous study has demonstrated\nthat Lcn2 is induced in macrophages in response to heat-\nkilled group B Streptococcus via a TLR2-dependent manner,\nCNS MyD88 in brain abscesses\nE 2009 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nimplying a role for TLRs in Lcn2 induction (Draper et al.,\n2006). Obviously, TLR2-mediated signalling is ablated in\nMyD88 KO mice, suggesting that this may represent one\nmechanism by which Lcn2 expression is reduced during brain\nabscess formation in these animals. Another gene whose\nexpression was decreased in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO\nanimals was properdin. Properdin activates the alternative\npathway of complement by assembling the C3 convertase on\ntarget surfaces (Kemper and Hourcade, 2008). Properdin is\ncapable of binding to bacteria to engage the alternative\ncomplement pathway and its importance in host defence is\nillustrated by the enhanced sensitivity of properdin-deficient\npatients to meningococcal disease (Densen et al., 1987;\nEmonts et al., 2003). Unlike most complement components,\nproperdin is produced by neutrophils and macrophages\nfact that the influx of both of these cell types is significantly\nattenuated in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice (Kielian et\nal., 2007) probably explains the reduction in properdin levels\nobserved in these animals. Another gene that was attenuated\nin brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice was SOCS3, which is a\nnegative regulator of cytokine signalling elicited by JAK\n(Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription), as well as TLR signalling pathways (Dimitriou\net al., 2008). It is interesting to note that SOCS3 has been\nreported to block IL-10 production, as well as induce classical\nmacrophage activation (Dimitriou et al., 2008; Liu et al.,\n2008). Our previous study demonstrated that macrophages\nand microglia isolated from brain abscesses of MyD88 KO\nmice expressed equivalent levels of IL-10 compared with WT\ncells, and this fact could be explained by the reduction in\nSOCS3 levels observed here. In addition, TNF-a has been\nreported to stabilize SOCS3 mRNA expression (Ehlting et al.,\n2007), and the failure to induce significant TNF-a expression\nin brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice could be another factor\ncontributing to reduced SOCS3 levels in these animals.\nImportantly, our microarray analysis revealed several genes\nthat we have previously reported to be significantly\nattenuated in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice at the\nprotein level including IL-1b and CXCL1 (KC) (Kielian et al.,\n2007). This provides further confidence in the accuracy of our\nmicroarray analysis. Collectively the propensity of apoptosis-\nrelated genes that are differentially expressed in brain\nabscesses of MyD88 KO mice is highly suggestive that the\nexpansive tissue damage that occurs in these animals is\ninfluenced by accelerated/dysregulated apoptotic pathways.\nThis possibility remains to be directly tested in future studies\nwith MyD88 KO mice in the brain abscess model.\nOne important point to emphasize is that, although we\nhave identified a critical role for MyD88 in the CNS\ncompartment during the early phase of S. aureus infection,\nseveral outstanding questions remain. The first is that we\ncannot determine whether MyD88 mediates its effects\nthrough TLRs or the IL-1R or IL-18R since all of these\nmolecules utilize this signalling adaptor. This is important\nsince earlier studies from our laboratory have revealed a\npivotal role for IL-1 in innate immunity to CNS S. aureus\ninfection (Kielian et al., 2004a). A second issue relates to the\ntarget cells in the brain where MyD88 expression is\nimportant. Likely candidates include microglia and astrocytes\nsince both cell types are capable of recognizing S. aureus via\na MyD88-dependent mechanism leading to pro-inflammatory\nmediator release (Esen and Kielian, 2006; T. Kielian,\nunpublished data). Regardless, the findings of the present\nstudy highlight a novel mechanism for CNS-resident cells in\ninitiating a protective innate immune response in the\ninfected brain and, in the absence of MyD88 in this\ncompartment, immunity is compromised.\n"
