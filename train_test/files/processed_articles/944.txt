    "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Objectives. Despite recognition of the\nimportant influence of environmental determinants on\nphysical activity patterns, minimal empirical research\nhas been done to assess the impact of environmental/\ncontextual determinants of physical activity. This article\naims to investigate environmental and sociodemographic\ndeterminants of physical activity and inactivity patterns\namong subpopulations of US adolescents. We define en-\nvironmental determinants as modifiable factors in the\nphysical environment that impose a direct influence\non the opportunity to engage in physical activity. The\npresent research examines environmental and sociode-\nmographic determinants of physical activity and inactiv-\nity with the implication that these findings can point\ntoward societal-level intervention strategies for increas-\ning physical activity and decreasing inactivity among\nadolescents.\nStudy Design and Methodology. The study popula-\ntion consists of nationally representative data from the\n1996 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\non 17 766 US adolescents enrolled in US middle and high\npanics, and 1337 Asians). Hours/week of inactivity (TV/\nvideo viewing and video/computer games) and times/\nweek of moderate to vigorous physical activity were\ncollected by questionnaire. Outcome variables were\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity and inactivity,\nwhich were broken into categories (physical activity: 0\u00ad2\ntimes/week, 3\u00ad4 times/week, and >5 times/week; inactiv-\nweek). Sociodemographic and environmental correlates\nof physical activity and inactivity were used as exposure\nand control variables and included sex, age, urban resi-\ndence, participation in school physical education pro-\ngram, use of community recreation center, total reported\nincidents of serious crime in neighborhood, socioeco-\nnomic status, ethnicity, generation of residence in the\nUnited States, presence of mother/father in household,\npregnancy status, work status, in-school status, region,\nand month of interview.\nLogistic regression models of high versus low and me-\ndium physical activity and inactivity were used to investi-\ngate sex and ethnic interactions in relation to environmen-\ntal and sociodemographic factors to examine evidence for\nthe potential impact of physical education and recreation\nprograms and sociodemographic factors on physical activ-\nity and inactivity patterns.\nResults. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was\nlower and inactivity higher for non-Hispanic black and\nHispanic adolescents. Participation in school physical\neducation programs was considerably low for these ado-\nlescents and decreased with age. Participation in daily\nschool physical education (PE) program classes (adjusted\n2.68) and use of a community recreation center (AOR:\nlikelihood of engaging in high level moderate to vigor-\nous physical activity. Maternal education was inversely\nassociated with high inactivity patterns; for example,\nhaving a mother with a graduate or professional degree\ninactivity. High family income was associated with in-\ncreased moderate to vigorous physical activity (AOR:\n.59\u00ad.82). High neighborhood serious crime level was as-\nsociated with a decreased likelihood of falling in the\nhighest category of moderate to vigorous physical activ-\nConclusions. These results show important associa-\ntions between modifiable environmental factors, such as\nparticipation in school PE and community recreation pro-\ngrams, with activity patterns of adolescents. Despite the\nmarked and significant impact of participation in school\nPE programs on physical activity patterns of US adoles-\ncents, few adolescents participated in such school PE\nprograms; only 21.3% of all adolescents participated in 1\nor more days per week of PE in their schools. In addition\nto the more readily modifiable factors, high crime level\nwas significantly associated with a decrease in weekly\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity.\nThe key modifiable factors that had an impact on phys-\nical activity did not affect inactivity. Thus, it is clear that\nphysical activity and inactivity were associated with very\ndifferent determinants. Although physical activity was\nmost associated with environmental factors, inactivity\nwas most associated with sociodemographic factors.\nThe data presented here confirm what researchers and\npediatricians have known intuitively; however, these re-\nlationships have not been tested empirically, nor have\nthey been studied in any nationally representative sur-\nvey of US school-aged children. These findings show\nthat patterns in inactivity cannot be explained using the\nenvironmental factors studied here and, thus, it is clearly\nimportant that researchers search for other environmen-\ntal determinants likely to impact inactivity.\nNational-level strategies must include attention to\nschool PE and community recreation programs, particu-\nlarly for segments of the US population without access to\nresources and opportunities that allow participation in\nphysical activity. Research to measure and explore the\neffects of other environmental determinants of activity\nand to ascertain whether there are any environmental\ndeterminants of inactivity are important future research\nFrom the *Carolina Population Center, Department of Exercise Physiology,\nand \u00a7Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, University of North\nCarolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nReprint requests to (P.G.-L.)

The\npresent research examines environmental and socio-\ndemographic determinants of physical activity and\ninactivity with the implication that these findings can\npoint toward societal-level intervention strategies for\nincreasing physical activity and decreasing inactivity\namong US adolescents.\nMETHODS\nSurvey Design\nThe study population consists of over 20 000 adolescents en-\nrolled in the National Longitunital Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health), a longitudinal, nationally representative, school-\nyears) in the United States. The Add Health study included a core\nsample and additional subsamples of selected ethnic and other\ngroupings collected following informed consent procedures estab-\nlished by the institutional review board of the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill. We used the wave I sample (20 747\neligible adolescents measured between April 1995 and December\n1995), excluding adolescents who used a walking aid device (eg,\ncane, crutches, and wheelchair) and Native Americans (n  178)\nbecause of small sample size. Our final sample totaled 17 766 for\nprevalence estimates and logistic regression analysis. The survey\ndesign and sampling frame have been described elsewhere.2,3\nIn-school and in-home surveys of adolescents provided the\nactivity data and components of the determinants data. In-home\nsurveys of parents provided income, education, and other key\nsociodemographic data. Community data were collected from\nmany sources, including 1993 Uniform Crime Reports, US Federal\nBureau of Investigation. Race and ethnicity were determined us-\ning data from a combination of all the surveys.\nPhysical Activity/Inactivity\nModerate to vigorous physical activity (5\u00ad8 metabolic equiva-\nlents [METs]) and inactivity were assessed using standard 7-day\nrecall (times/week) questionnaire methodology relevant for epi-\ndemiologic studies.4,5,24\u00ad26 The assessment employed an array of\nquestions similar to those used and validated in many other\nsmaller studies to categorize adolescents into high, medium, and\nlow activity and inactivity patterns with reasonable reliability and\nvalidity. The Add Health adolescents were asked about the times/\nweek spent in various physical activities (eg, \"During the past\nweek, how many times did you go roller-blading, roller-skating,\nskate-boarding, or bicycling?\"). Each activity grouping was as-\n/kg body weight/minute\nor resting metabolic rate) based on the Compendium of Physical\nActivity27 developed for adults to categorize activity as low, mod-\nerate, or vigorous. It is realized that the energy cost of activities is\n10% higher in children; however, at the present time no norms\nexist for children. Higher intensity activities, such as skating,\ncycling, dance, martial arts activities, and active sports, were\nassigned 5 to 8 METs and are, thus, considered moderate to\nvigorous physical activity.\nPhysical inactivity was assessed using standard 7-day recall\nquestionnaire methodology relevant for epidemiologic studies4,5\nused to categorize adolescents into high, medium, and low inac-\ntivity patterns. The inactivity questions follow the same structure\nas those validated for physical activity. The quantification of in-\nactivity has received far less attention than physical activity28 and\nthere is little published in the literature regarding reliability and\nvalidity of inactivity. In addition to the standard TV-viewing\nquestion used in other studies (eg, number of hours of TV viewing\nper week), Add Health elicited information on the number of\nhours and minutes of video viewing and video/computer game\nuse during the past week. The quantification of inactivity is more\nstraightforward than that of physical activity, because there is no\nconcern with intensity and most sedentary activities have the\nsame relative energy cost. In this study, all 3 inactivity variables\nwere assigned 1 MET each. A composite inactivity score was\ncalculated using the number of hours and minutes that each\nadolescent spent engaged in TV and video viewing and playing\nvideo/computer games. This strategy ignores potential differ-\nences in METs for computer/video games versus TV and video\nviewing, as well as differences attributable to advertisements seen\non TV but not in video viewing.\nStudy Variables\nOutcome variables were moderate to vigorous physical activity\nand inactivity, which were broken into categories (physical activ-\nity: 0\u00ad2 times/week, 3\u00ad4 times/week, and 5 times/week; inac-\nweek) for comparability to published data. Sociodemographic and\nenvironmental correlates of physical activity and inactivity were\nused as exposure and control variables. These correlates included\nschool, high school/GED, some college, and college/professional\ndegree), ethnic group (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nHispanic [Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South American, Mexi-\ncan/Chicano, and other Hispanic], and Asian [Chinese, Filipino,\nand other Asians]; ethnicity/race categorized from self-reports of\nadolescents and their parents), ethnicity and sex interaction, gen-\neration of residence in United States (1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation),\nurban residence, total reported incidents of serious crime per\nhood recreation center, number of days in an average week that\nrespondents attend PE classes at school (none, 1\u00ad4 days/week,\nand 5 days/week), whether respondent works for pay, region\n(Northeast, South, West, and Midwest), and month of interview.\nControl variables included pregnancy status, whether respondent\nwas in school at time of interview, mother in household, father in\neducation predicted (n  258; 1.5%). Data on family income and\nmaternal education were compiled using adolescent reports when\nparent reports were missing. A predication equation was used to\nestimate family income and maternal education when both parent\nand adolescent information were missing. Major correlates of\ninterest are shown in Table 1.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using STATA (STATA, Chi-\ncago, IL).29 Poststratification sample weights were used in all\nanalyses to allow these results to be comparable with adolescents\nattending schools in the United States. Survey design effects of\nmultiple stages of cluster sampling were also controlled for in all\nanalyses. Logistic regression models of physical activity and inac-\ntivity were used to investigate sex and ethnic interactions in\nrelation to environmental and sociodemographic correlates of\nphysical activity and inactivity to examine evidence for the poten-\ntial impact of these correlates (eg, PE programs and community\nrecreation facilities) on physical activity and inactivity patterns.\nModels compare high activity (or inactivity) versus low and me-\ndium activity (or inactivity), with non-Hispanic whites as the\nreference category. Regression models were used to investigate\nthe association of environmental correlates of physical activity\nwith age, sex, and ethnicity.\nRESULTS\nEthnicity and Gender\nTable 2 presents the proportion of adolescents who\nparticipated in low, moderate, and high categories of\nphysical activity. Among males, the proportion of\nadolescents to participate in the highest category of\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity varied little\nby ethnicity. In contrast, among females, a greater\npercentage of non-Hispanic whites and Asians par-\nticipated in the highest category moderate to vigor-\nous physical activity, whereas the proportion was\nsmaller for non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics.\nResults for physical inactivity show greater ethnic\nvariability than for activity. Table 2 presents the pro-\nportion of adolescents to participate in low, medium,\nand high categories of weekly inactivity (TV/video\nviewing and video/computer game use). The pro-\nportion of adolescents to participate in the highest\ncategory of inactivity was greatest for non-Hispanic\nblack males and females and Hispanic males and\nfemales and was lowest for Asian and non-Hispanic\nwhite females.\nEnvironmental Determinants of Physical Activity\nTable 3 shows the distribution of sociodemo-\ngraphic and environmental determinants of physical\nactivity and inactivity by ethnicity. Most adolescents\nwere not enrolled in PE courses at the time of survey\n5 or more days. Results varied by ethnicity; fewer\nnon-Hispanic whites had PE classes and a greater\nproportion of Asians had PE. A small percentage of\nadolescents used a neighborhood community recre-\nation center (19.6%) with the greatest percentage\nseen for non-Hispanic blacks (23.6%). Results for PE\nand recreation center use did vary by sex; more\nmales were enrolled in PE classes and used commu-\nnity recreation centers than females. Results show\nthat the highest percentage of non-Hispanic whites\n(46.9%) lived in low crime areas, whereas the highest\npercentage of non-Hispanic blacks (58.1%) and His-\npanics (41.5%) lived in high crime areas. Maternal\neducation was lowest for Hispanics (44.7% had less\nthan a high school degree) and highest for Asians\npercentages of mothers with graduate or profes-\nsional degrees. The greatest percentage of non-\nfamily incomes, whereas the greatest percentage of\nlow family incomes.\nSchool PE\nParticipation in school PE programs was substan-\ntially associated with likelihood of engaging in mod-\nerate to vigorous physical activity (Table 4). Having\nPE 1 to 4 times per week was associated with an\nincrease of 44% in falling in the highest category of\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity (adjusted\nTABLE 1.

Participation in PE was not significantly\nassociated with likelihood of engaging in high levels\nof inactivity (Table 4).\nWe found marked differences in the patterns of PE\nprogram participation by age and gender (Fig 1). For\nquency of PE, but this number decreased with age, so\nthat by 17 years of age, only 8.3% of adolescents had\nPE 1 or more times per week. Males (15.3%) were\nmore likely than females (13.7%) to participate in PE\nat least once per week. Regression analyses modeling\nuse of PE programs, using ethnicity, sex, age, and a\nsex\u00adethnicity interaction, show that age (P  .00001);\n(but not sex\u00adethnicity interactions) were important\nfactors in PE use.\nNeighborhood Community Recreation Centers\nUse of a community recreation center also had a\nmarked association with likelihood of engaging in\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity (Table 4). Us-\ning a recreation center was associated with a 75%\nincrease in the likelihood of falling in the highest\ncategory of moderate to vigorous physical activity\nPE, inactivity did not vary with use of a community\nrecreation center (Table 4). Recreation center use was\nmodeled similarly to that described above for PE use.\nResults show that sex (P  .021), non-Hispanic black\nand the interaction between Hispanic ethnicity and\nsex (P  .018) were important factors in recreation\ncenter use.\nTotal Reported Incidents of Serious Crime\nHigh crime levels were associated with a decrease\nin the likelihood of falling in the highest category of\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity (AOR: .77; CI:\nassociation was not as great as that seen for school\nTABLE 2.

Again, crime was modeled similarly to that de-\nscribed above for PE use and was very clearly asso-\nsignificant age, sex, and sex\u00adethnicity interactions.\nSeasonality and Region\nClassic work on environmental determinants of\nphysical activity has focused on season and region of\nresidence. Our results do not show major effects of\nseasonality and region. For physical activity, there\nwas no relationship with month during which activ-\nity patterns were measured, and, thus, no evidence\nof a seasonality effect. However, there was a signif-\nicant association with residence in the Northeast re-\nposite inactivity, there was no region effect. There\nwas a significant association with inactivity mea-\nwith inactivity.\nSociodemographic Determinants of Physical Activity\nMaternal Education\nHigh level of maternal education (adolescents with\nmothers who had graduate or professional degrees)\nwas significantly associated with increased likeli-\nhood of having high levels of moderate to vigorous\nAt other levels, maternal education was not signifi-\ncantly associated with high category of moderate to\nvigorous physical activity, although likelihood of\nfalling in the highest category of moderate to vigor-\nous physical activity increased with maternal educa-\ntion (Table 5). Conversely, having a mother with\n.028), or having a graduate or professional degree\nwith decreased likelihood of engaging in high levels\nof inactivity (Table 5).\nFamily Income\nFamily income was associated with both physical\nactivity and inactivity (Table 5). Adolescents from\nhouseholds with highest family income had an in-\ncreased likelihood of falling in the highest category\nof moderate to vigorous physical activity (AOR: 1.43;\nfalling in the highest category of inactivity (AOR: .70;\nFig 1.

Adjusted odds ratios\nfor inactivity were significant for Filipino (AOR: 1.71;\nDISCUSSION\nAdd Health, a unique survey with its rich sample\nof ethnic subpopulations and detailed activity and\ninactivity, sociodemographic, and environmental\ndata, investigates modifiable physical activity deter-\nminants vitally important to current efforts to in-\ncrease physical activity among our nation's adoles-\ncents. The high levels of obesity and inactivity and\nlow levels of physical activity illustrate the public\nhealth importance of this analysis.3\nThe results fit well with US teen obesity patterns.2\nInactivity was highest and physical activity lowest\nfor non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adolescents.\nThese trends were exaggerated for females and older\nadolescents.\nPE Matters but Few Participate\nThe national push away from comprehensive PE\nin US schools is remarkable.8 Although our results\nshow important associations between participation\nin PE and activity patterns, particularly on a daily\nbasis, few teens receive PE. Our results indicate that\nPE classes may represent the only opportunity for\nmany adolescents to engage in weekly physical ac-\ntivity. Conversely, the number of PE classes per\nweek was not associated with level of inactivity of\nthese adolescents. As shown, age, sex, and ethnicity\nwere important factors in PE use. Clearly, these are\nmodifiable relationships. Indeed, the Child and Ad-\nolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health has shown\nthat a program aimed at improving school PE has\nbeen successful in increasing moderate to vigorous\nphysical activity in PE classes.30\nLogistic regression results show a strong impact of\nPE programs on physical activity patterns. To place\nthese results in context of potential program out-\ncome, simulations run from the logistic regression\nmodels (Tables 4 and 5) show increases in adjusted\nproportion of adolescents participating in the highest\ncategory of moderate to vigorous physical activity by\nnumber of days of PE per week. For example, the\nadjusted proportion of adolescents to fall in the high-\nest category of moderate to vigorous physical activ-\nity increases from 30.3% for those adolescents with\ntimes per week and to 46.8% for those having PE 5\ntimes per week. This represents a marked increase in\nthe percentage of adolescents who would be partic-\nipating in substantial levels of weekly moderate to\nvigorous physical activity.\nCommunity Recreation Facilities Might Offer a Key\nIntervention\nAdolescents who used a community recreation\ncenter (as with those in PE) reported markedly\nhigher levels of moderate to vigorous physical activ-\nity than those who did not. As indicated, sex, non-\nHispanic black ethnicity (with a strong ethnicity-sex\ninteraction) and Hispanic female ethnicity were im-\nportant factors in community recreation center use.\nTABLE 5.

Crime was\nalso associated with an increase in inactivity, al-\nthough this relationship was not significant. Crime\nwas very clearly associated with ethnicity, but there\nwere no significant age, sex, and sex\u00adethnicity inter-\nactions. However, logistic regression results showed\na differential association between high neighborhood\nKey Environmental Factors Do Not Reduce Inactivity\nThe key modifiable factors that had an impact on\nactivity did not affect inactivity. Thus, it is clear that\nphysical activity and inactivity were influenced by\nvery different determinants. Although physical ac-\ntivity was most influenced by environmental factors,\ninactivity was much more influenced by sociodemo-\ngraphic factors. Higher socioeconomic status mea-\nsured by maternal education and family income had\na substantial impact on likelihood of engaging in\ninactivity. Advanced education and high income\nwere associated with lower levels of inactivity.\nRelated Research\nOther scholars have found that participation in\ncommunity sports is an important predictor of phys-\nical activity and have suggested the need for improv-\ning access to community-based physical activity op-\nportunities,13 health-oriented improvements in PE\nprograms,31 daily PE programs that are fun and\nstress lifelong physical activity habits,19 and a possi-\nble role for clinicians in educating parents about\nappropriate community play places.15\nThis study has 1 limitation. The data on commu-\nnity recreation centers were based on actual use, not\navailability. Data on availability are unavailable in\nany national database. This actual use response may\nproduce misleading results because physically active\npeople may be more likely to use recreation centers.\nAdditional research is needed to determine the types\nof facilities that might offset the impact of crime on\nphysical activity and inactivity.\nThe data presented here confirm what researchers\nand pediatricians have known intuitively; however,\nthese relationships have not been tested empirically,\nnor have they been studied in any national dataset.\nThese findings show that patterns in inactivity can-\nnot be explained using the environmental factors\nstudied here and, thus, it is clearly important that\nresearchers search for other environmental determi-\nnants likely to impact inactivity. This further dem-\nonstrates the difficulty that researchers and pediatri-\ncians face in developing public health efforts to\ndecrease inactivity.\nThe results of this study show the importance of\nPE classes and recreation centers in increasing phys-\nical activity and give powerful evidence supporting\nthe importance of increasing opportunities for phys-\nical activity and the potential impact of PE programs\nand community recreation programs on physical ac-\ntivity of US adolescents. In addition, it is imperative\nthat we provide safe and accessible places for exer-\ncise for our nation's youth. In many communities,\nthe only such place may be the school.\nClearly our national public health initiatives\nshould consider these options. More research is\nneeded on the role of these factors in affecting activ-\nity and inactivity and on ways to most effectively\nchange them. PE and community recreation pro-\ngrams should receive attention at a national level,\nparticularly for segments of the population without\nresources to locate and pay for extracurricular and\nextracommunity physical activity opportunities.\nAvailability of such resources will increase success\nfor pediatricians in recommendations to patients to\nincrease physical activity and decrease inactivity.\nThis research also suggests that with increased op-\nportunities for physical activity, adolescents may opt\nto selectively engage in these activities instead of\nmore inactive behaviors.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by National Institute of Child\nDannon Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Nu-\ntrition Science.\nWe thank Frances Dancy for her helpful administrative assis-\ntance and Tom Swasey for assistance with the graphics.\nREFERENCES\n1.
