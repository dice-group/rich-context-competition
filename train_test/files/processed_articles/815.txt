The event history\napproach used in this study to determine the correlates of nonresponse addresses important shortcomings of previous\nanalyses by incorporating time-varying covariates. Nonresponse is not random; persons of older ages, lower\neducation, who live alone, rent (not own), have morefunctioning impairments, or have another sample person in the\nhousehold are more likely to become nonrespondents. However, correction accounting for the effect of these\ncorrelates of nonresponse, as well as unobserved characteristics potentially affecting nonresponse, suggests that the\nassociation between these characteristics and the probability of nonresponse is not large enough to introduce bias.\nWhile these results are not portable to other analyses or panels, they do indicate that in this case, significant\nnonrandom nonresponse does not bias all related analytic results.\nA LTHOUGH the increasing availability of panel data has\n\u00b7**\u00b7 been a great boon to researchers studying characteris-\ntics that change with age and over time, analysis of panel\ndata is complicated by the loss of panel members at follow-\nup interviews. All studies using panel data must investigate\nthe extent to which loss to follow-up has occurred and\nwhether the loss is likely to bias analytic results. Bias can be\nintroduced when loss to follow-up is not random and is\nrelated to outcomes of interest. Such selection of the sample\nmay result in confounded associations (Schaie, Labouvie,\ntorted prevalence estimates and transition rates (Corder,\nWoodbury, and Manton, 1992; Van den Berg, Lindeboom,\nand Ridder, 1994). For example, an analysis of health\nchange in a panel of older persons would be selected with\nrespect to the characteristic of interest if persons in worse\nhealth were more likely to become nonrespondents than\nothers; this could result in biased estimates of the level of\nhealth of the sample and the correlates of health change.\nSamples of older persons are generally believed to be more\nsusceptible to nonresponse selection because the proportion\nlost to follow-up tends to increase with age (Rodgers and\nHerzog, 1992). Studies of nonresponse have suggested that\nthe differences between participants and nonrespondents\nmay be greater among older persons than younger (Schaie,\nLabouvie, and Barrett, 1973). It is the magnitude of the\ndifference between the respondents and nonrespondents that\nultimately determines whether the sample is compromised\nby nonresponse.\nIn this study, we are concerned with nonresponse that\noccurs at an interview after the baseline interview, often\nreferred to as wave nonresponse. This type of nonresponse\nshould be distinguished both from item nonresponse, which\noccurs when a person does not respond to a single question,\nand from initial nonresponse, which occurs when a person\ndoes not respond to the entire first interview. We also\ndistinguish nonresponse among those alive from nonre-\nsponse due to mortality, which we view as a \"legitimate\noutcome.\"\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate whether there is\nnonrandom nonresponse in a multiwave panel study of older\nAmericans (the Longitudinal Study of Aging) and whether\nthis nonresponse is likely to significantly bias analytic results\nbased on these data. To determine whether there is nonran-\ndom nonresponse related to observed characteristics, a pre-\ndictive model of wave-nonresponse is developed. Individual\nprobabilities of nonresponse estimated from this model are\nused to construct weights for the remaining sample members\nwhich compensate for the loss to follow-up. Substantive\nunivariate and bivariate results from data adjusted for nonre-\nsponse with these weights are compared with those from\nunadjusted data. In a second approach appropriate for multi-\nvariate analyses, the probability of sample selection (or loss\nto follow-up) is modeled simultaneously with a substantive\noutcome. This approach allows us to examine the effect of\nany unobserved characteristics jointly affecting nonresponse\nand our substantive outcome, and to evaluate the extent of\nsample selection bias in a multivariate context.\nAn Overview of the Problem of Nonresponse\nAs noted above, nonresponse is an issue in all panel\nsurveys. In the first household interview of the National\nMedical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NM-\nCUES), 10 percent did not respond. By the fifth interview,\nconducted 15 months later, 22.1 percent of the sample were\nnonrespondents (Wright, 1983). About 5 percent of the\nSurvey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) sample\ndid not respond to the first interview. By the ninth wave, 36\nmonths later, this rate had accumulated to 22.3 percent\n(Kasprzyk and McMillen, 1987). Nonresponse to the annual\ninterview of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)\nwas high in the first wave (24%), then leveled off to about 2\npercent at each interview, accumulating at about 44 percent\nIn their comparison of the characteristics and methodolo-\ngies of several surveys related to health among older per-\nsons, Corder and Manton (1991) report the relative level of\nnonresponse in four longitudinal studies. Low nonresponse\nrates of about 4 percent are reported for persons selected on\ndisability among those who had previously completed a\nscreening interview for the initial 1982 interview of the\nNational Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS). Among those\neligible for reinterview seven years later, only 6 percent\nwere lost to follow-up. On the other hand, in the NHANESI\nfollow-up, which required a physical exam, nonresponse\nwas a high 25 percent. According to Corder and Manton\n(1991), among surveys of the older population on health\ntopics both the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) and the\nNational Nursing Home Survey fall within the moderate\nrange on nonresponse. While the new survey of Asset and\nHealth Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) does not\nyet have a longitudinal component, 20 percent of the\nscreened sample was not interviewed on the first wave (Hurd\net al., 1994). These studies differ in their objectives, sam-\npling strategies, observation plans, and methodologies, as\nwell as in their levels of follow-up nonresponse; the issue of\nassessing the effect of panel nonresponse is, however, com-\nmon to all of them.\nHow Do Persons Become ' 'Lost to Follow-up'' ?\nNonresponse can occur because a person refuses to re-\nspond to the survey, because the person cannot respond to\nthe survey, or because the person cannot be located. Refusal\nto respond may indicate distaste for responding to surveys in\ngeneral, lack of interest in the particular survey, or compet-\ning uses for the potential respondent's time. Refusal may be\nrelated to gender. Women might be more wary of personal\ncontact with interviewers; men might find long telephone\nsurveys distasteful. This might be why men are more likely\nto be nonrespondents in some studies (Jay et al., 1993;\nIn general, persons of lower socioeconomic status, those\nwho have fewer years of education or lower incomes, are\nmore likely to become nonrespondents (Chyba and Fitti,\neducation could be more interested in the survey itself, or\nmore aware of the importance of survey response to re-\nsearch, and thus less likely to refuse. Persons of lower\nsocioeconomic status may have a greater distrust of survey\norganizations or less identification with the interviewers,\nand this may lead to more refusal. The relationship between\nsocioeconomic status and refusal could explain the finding\nthat African Americans have been more likely to be nonre-\nInability to complete a future interview is more likely\namong persons who are in worse health. Many studies have\nreported that nonrespondents are likely to be in poorer\nphysical health, have a greater number of functioning dif-\nficulties, have worse self-reported health (Chyba and Fitti,\nof cognitive functioning (Kalton et al., 1990; Schaie, La-\nDifficulty locating sample members may be a particularly\nimportant problem among older respondents. Residential\nrelocation among the old may occur because a household\nmember dies or because an individual can no longer maintain\nindependent living. Persons identified by the survey organi-\nzation as contact persons are also likely to be older and thus\nmore likely to die and dissolve their residences. Those who\ndo not own their homes are more likely to become nonre-\nspondents because they have fewer barriers to moving and\nthus are more likely to become unable to locate (Kalton,\nFamily composition and marital status both have been\nlinked to nonresponse (Speare, Avery, and Lawton, 1991).\nPersons who are living alone may be more likely to become\nlost to future interviews since they are less likely to leave\nsomeone behind who would know their whereabouts. Lil-\nlard's (1989) finding that household response rates were\nhigher among those belonging to families with other house-\nholds participating in the survey is consistent with this\nhypothesis.\nAge is almost always found to be a predictor of nonre-\nThis may be due to the fact that the older one is, the more\nlikely one is to experience changes in residence that result in\nhousehold dissolution. The institutionalized population may\nhave even higher rates of nonresponse than the community-\ndwelling population because they are more difficult to locate\nor because of resistance from the institution or caregivers\nIn addition to individual characteristics that may influence\na person's propensity to continue responding to the survey,\nthere are also certain survey attributes that may enhance the\nchances that a sample person will respond. The number of\ninterviews a person is requested to complete may be related\nto respondent burden and thus to survey response (Kalton,\nKasprzyk, and McMillen, 1989); however, comparisons of\nresponse rates among surveys with differences in the total\nnumber of interviews conducted suggest that frequency of\ninterviews does not affect rates of nonresponse (Lillard,\n1989). Nonresponse does accumulate over time; however,\nwith a pattern of decline in response rate at the first follow-up\ninterview, then a leveling off (e.g., Hill, 1992; Lillard,\nweeding out of \"not-interesteds.\"\nWhile we have used the literature to hypothesize the\nmechanisms through which response is affected, it is not\nclear from previous studies that these hypotheses are consis-\ntently supported by existing empirical work. Even in surveys\nof similar populations, the literature in this area is replete\nwith conflicting findings which we would generally attribute\nto the lack of multivariate analyses or the omission of\nimportant variables. For instance, men are sometimes found\nto be more likely to be nonrespondents (Jay et al., 1993;\nbeen found to be insignificant (Adams et al., 1990). It is\npossible that whether or not a sex difference appears is\nrelated to whether or not living arrangements, marital status,\nand health are controlled. All of these characteristics are\nknown to be quite different among older men and women.\nThe literature is also ambiguous about the effect of house-\nhold and family composition on nonresponse. Not being\nmarried is sometimes associated with nonresponse (Speare,\nAvery, and Lawton, 1991) and sometimes not (Streib,\n1982). Living arrangements and marital status have both\nbeen linked to health. Streib (1982) controlled for health,\nwhereas Speare, Avery, and Lawton (1991) did not. The\nresponse rate among African Americans is sometimes lower\nthan that among others (Foley et al., 1990), but sometimes\nnot (Streib, 1982). Perhaps race is confounded with socio-\neconomic status and health. Streib controls for these charac-\nteristics; Foley apparently does not.\nAnalyses of nonresponse in panels of older persons have\noften unnecessarily focused on a limited range of character-\nistics, neglected to account for the possibility that individ-\nuals' characteristics may change over time, or ignored the\ncontribution of unobserved characteristics. The conse-\nquences of these shortcomings are the presentation of spuri-\nous relationships, time-inappropriate linking of characteris-\ntics and outcomes, and a failure to fully account for\nnonresponse bias.\nCorrectingfor Nonresponse\nIf loss to follow-up occurs nonrandomly, that is, differ-\nentially selecting persons with certain characteristics out of\nthe sample, attention must be given to correcting potential\nbias. Weighting is perhaps the most often used approach to\nunit nonresponse adjustment, although other techniques,\nsuch as imputation, are also used. One of the more com-\nmonly used methods for constructing weights is the applica-\ntion of response probability weights (Lepkowski, Kalton,\nvidual weights are constructed from the results of multivari-\nate regressions predicting probability of nonresponse, and\nthese weights are as unique as the characteristics predicting\nnonresponse (Iannacchione, Milne, and Folsom, 1991).\nThe weights can be applied to correct descriptive univariate\nor bivariate statistics, including prevalence and transition\nrates, for a sample with nonrandom nonresponse.\nWith a perfectly specified multivariate analysis in which\nall characteristics contributing to nonresponse are con-\ntrolled, bias would be eliminated. Since perfect specification\nis not possible, one way to determine how much difference\nan adjustment for nonresponse will make is by making the\nadjustment using the best specified model possible and then\ncomparing corrected and uncorrected analyses.\nWhile this is a common method for compensating for\nnonresponse, it assumes that those who are lost to follow-up\nare similar to continuing respondents on unobserved charac-\nteristics. If there are unobserved characteristics affecting\nboth nonresponse and outcomes of interest, correcting only\nfor observed characteristics will not eliminate the potential\nbias. Jointly estimating the probability of nonresponse and\nthe substantive outcome of interest offers a way to correct for\nWhile most studies of attrition in panel surveys find\nnonrandom loss, several evaluations have found that correc-\ntion has not altered the interpretation of the results (for\nexample, Goudy, 1985; Kalton, Kasprzyk, and McMillen,\nother hand, other studies have found that adjusting for\nattrition significantly changes some substantive findings\n(Hausman and Wise, 1979; Markides, Timbers, and Osberg,\n1984). The reason for this is that whether or not nonrandom\nnonresponse translates into a biased sample depends on the\nrelationship of the outcome of interest to nonresponse, how\nwell-specified the model of nonresponse is, the size of the\ndifference between respondents and nonrespondents, and the\nextent of the loss (Braver and Bay, 1992). The importance of\nsample attrition necessarily continues to be emphasized in\nvirtually all analyses of longitudinal data (Corder, Wood-\npossible to estimate whether or not a correction will matter\nMETHODS\nSample. -- The Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) is a\nfour-wave panel survey that was designed to represent the\ncommunity-dwelling population 70 years of age and older in\nthe United States at the initial interview in 1984. The\noriginal LSOA interview took place among those eligible\nwho responded to the 1984 National Health Interview Sur-\nvey (NHIS). Among surveyed households, 96.4 percent\nthese responded to the Supplement on Aging, the baseline\ninterview for the LSOA (Kovar, Fitti, and Chyba, 1992).\nThree follow-up LSOA interviews are conducted at two-\nyear intervals, with the last interview occurring in 1990.\nWhen a sample member is unable to respond because of a\nphysical or mental health problem, proxy responses are\naccepted. While the original interview was face-to-face, the\nfollow-up interviews were done primarily by phone, using a\nmail interview where a phone interview could not be com-\npleted. Additional details of the survey design and interview\nprotocol are available in Kovar, Fitti, and Chyba (1992).\nData from the National Death Index (NDI) appended to\nthe LSOA survey files provide confirmation and date of\ndeath. A sample person is assumed to be dead if a contact\nperson reported that person as deceased or if that person has\na \"good match\" with the National Death Index (Kovar, Fitti,\nand Chyba, 1992) and did not respond to any surveys\nsubsequent to the date of death; sample persons are other-\nwise assumed to be alive. We make this assumption because\nevaluations of the accuracy of the National Death Index\nusing match strategies comparable to that used by the LSOA\nindicate its sensitivity (correctly identifying persons known\nto be deceased) is approximately 97 percent and its specific-\nity (not identifying those known to be alive as dead) is about\nWilliams, Demitrack, and Fries, 1992). Nevertheless, it is\npossible that a few persons we assume to be alive and\nnonrespondent could have died. This is especially true in the\nfinal year because of a considerable lag-time recording\ndeaths in the NDI (Rich-Edwards, Corsano, and Stampfer,\n1994), though this error is further minimized because we do\nnot rely solely on the NDI data, but have contact persons'\nreports as well.\nAnalysis. -- This section begins with a description of how\nnonresponse and death contribute to the decrement of the\nsample over time. Both aggregate outcomes for the entire\nsample and individual patterns of response for the four\nwaves are presented. Next, we turn to a multivariate analysis\nrelating nonresponse to observed characteristics. Based on\nthis analysis, we proceed with an application of a weighting\napproach to compensate for this loss and examine the effect\non distributions and bivariate relationships. We conclude\nwith an approach to multivariate analysis that allows correc-\ntion for both observed and unobserved characteristics affect-\ning nonresponse.\nRESULTS\nDescription of Sample Dynamics\nThe number of respondents diminished at each successive\njust over half of the sample was interviewed at the last wave\nin 1990. Three-quarters of this loss is due to death. By the\nsecond wave 12 percent of the original sample had died; by\nthe fourth wave more than one-third was dead. Interestingly,\neven in this older sample, the percentage who died between\ninterviews among those known to be alive at the preceding\ninterview was fairly constant across the three intervals (Ta-\nble IB). Between the first and second interviews 12 percent\nof the sample had died; between the third and fourth inter-\nviews about 15 percent had died.\nThe percentage of the original sample not responding to\nthe survey increased with each wave. Among those not\nknown to be dead at each wave (Table 1C), the likelihood of\nnonresponse increased from almost 9 percent at the second\nwave to 19 percent at the fourth wave. The percentage\nbecoming new nonrespondents (Table ID) does not increase\nnearly as dramatically, indicating that the likelihood of not\nresponding to future waves is much higher for those who are\nearlier nonrespondents. This pattern of relatively low rates\nof increase in new nonresponse over time that accumulate to\noverall larger rates of total nonresponse has been observed\nby others (Kalton, Kasprzyk, and McMillen, 1989).\nThe frequency of the observed three-interval pattern of\nresponse for individuals presented in Table 2 gives a fuller\npicture of how sample nonresponse affects our ability to\ntrace changes in individuals' characteristics across inter-\nviews. For instance, \"III\" or an interview at each of the\nthree follow-up waves, is the most common pattern of\nresponse. Eighty percent of the original respondents are\ninterviewed at every wave before death. Another 10 percent\nof the sample is only missing at one interview and assumed\nto be still alive. Only 4 percent of the sample are never\ninterviewed again after the initial interview, and one-third of\nthese are dead before the fourth wave. Thus, even with this\nlevel of sample attrition, the changes in individual character-\nistics can be traced for most living members of the sample.\nMultivariate Analysis of Loss to Follow-up\nTo determine whether there are differences between the\n20 percent of the sample that does eventually become lost to\nfollow-up and continuing respondents, we use a multivariate\nanalysis predicting nonresponse over the four waves of the\nLSOA. The outcome variable of interest is the first instance\nof nonresponse recorded for a panel member for any reason\nother than death. Persons who do not respond because they\ndied are removed from the analysis for that and subsequent\ninterviews. If the dead are retained and death is modeled as a\ncompeting risk, the estimated coefficients and standard er-\nrors for the relative risk of nonresponse are virtually identical\nto those presented here. We do not explicitly model death in\nthis analysis, however, because this source of sample decre-\nment is not an' 'error'' to be corrected for. Loss to death is an\nimportant part of the sample dynamic, however, and it\nshould be taken into account in any substantive analysis.\nNonresponse after the first occurrence is not considered in\nthe equation because persons' characteristics at the begin-\nning of those intervals are missing. In our analysis the event\nTable 1. Sample Nonresponse in Four Waves of the LSOA\nInterviewed\nLost to death\nNonresponse\nTotal\nLost to death\nNonresponse\nn % n\n%\nn % n\n1 A.

Period (ID.) = Previously deceased.\nof first nonresponse can occur at any one of the three\ninterviews after the initial interview. A person-interval lo-\ngistic regression is modeled; the log odds for the conditional\nprobabilities of the event of first-time nonresponse occurring\nare estimated using SAS PROC LOGISTIC (SAS Institute,\nTo enable us to take advantage of fresh information col-\nlected at each interview, a pooled data set is created in which\neach observation gets a unique record for each interval (n =\n10,756) and characteristics at the beginning of the interval are\nrelated to response status at the end of the interval. This\napproach assumes that the error terms for each observation (in\nthis case each person-interval) are not correlated. To evaluate\nthe sensitivity of the results to this assumption, regression\nresults from a generalized estimating equation (GEE), which\ntreats the correlation across an individual's observations as a\nnuisance parameter, were compared with the results pre-\nLipsitz, Kim, and Zhao, 1994). There were no differences in\npatterns of significance or size of coefficients with and with-\nout the autocorrelation controlled.\nOur model of loss to follow-up includes characteristics\nthat should be related to refusal to participate in the survey,\ninability to participate, and inability to be located. We\nhypothesize that being older, male, Black, having fewer\nyears of education, not owning a home, currently residing in\nan institution, and reporting a greater number of functioning\nlimitations will be associated with higher odds of nonre-\nsponse. An indicator for having another sample person in the\nhousehold indicates family involvement in the survey. Our\nexpectation is that having another family member in the\nsurvey will increase participation. An indicator of whether\nthe follow-up where loss occurs is the first, second, or third\nwave after baseline is also included. This allows us to\nevaluate whether the rate of first-time nonresponse increases\nat successive interviews independent of changes in other\ncharacteristics.\nThe record for each person-interval contains two kinds of\nindependent variables. The first are those variables which\ntypically remain constant over adult life: sex, race, and years\nof education. The second type of variable was collected or\ncan be inferred at each interview: age, living arrangement,\nwhether the respondent lives in an institution, home owner-\nship, the presence of another sample member, and func-\ntioning ability. The operational definitions of most of the\nvariables are straightforward. Functioning ability is oper-\nationalized as the number of 13 ADL and IADL functions\na respondent reports having difficulty with (bathing, dress-\ning, eating, transferring, walking, getting outside, toi-\nleting, shopping, preparing meals, using the telephone,\nmanaging money, doing light housework, and doing heavy\nhousework). While this approach makes the best use of the\nrepeated measures that are available, a kind of measurement\nerror may still arise because the interview at which these\ncharacteristics are measured occurs at least two years prior to\nthe nonresponse, and the characteristics could change in that\ninterval.\nResults. -- Table 3 compares the full sample at baseline,\nthose who respond to each interview, those who live but\nbecome nonrespondents, and those who die. The bivariate\ndata in this table suggest that those lost to nonresponse are\nmore likely to be female, Black, older, have lower educa-\ntion, live alone, not own a home, or have more functioning\nproblems than those who are interviewed at each opportu-\nnity. Death selects those who are male as well as those who\nhave more functioning problems.\nWhile Table 3 gives a picture of the bivariate relation-\nships, the effect of these variables when other characteristics\nare controlled is shown in a series of logistic regression\nmodels (Table 4). Four nested models were estimated so that\nthe effects of successively including groups of predictor\nvariables covering different types of hypothesized effects\ncould be compared. Model 1 includes demographic charac-\nTable 3.

Model 2 adds characteristics of living\narrangements which we expect to relate to loss of contact.\nModel 3 adds an indicator of functioning which should be\nrelated to ability to respond, and Model 4 includes character-\nistics of the survey. This approach should clarify why some\nstudies in the literature find that certain variables are related\nto nonresponse while others do not. The odds ratios and the\nlog-odds ratios indicating the probability of being a first-time\nnonrespondent relative to being a continuing respondent are\nreported in Table 4.\nWhen only the demographic variables are included in the\nmodel, we find that women are more likely to be nonrespon-\ndents than men, holding race, age, and education constant\n(Model 1). When living arrangements are controlled,\nwomen are no more likely than men to become nonrespon-\ndents (Model 2). Thus, women do not appear to be refusers\nbut to become lost because of gender differences in living\narrangements; persons who live alone are more likely to\nbecome nonrespondents.\nBlacks are no more likely than non-Blacks to become\nnonrespondents when education is controlled. Years of edu-\ncation remains significant, and living alone becomes signifi-\ncant when level of functioning is controlled (Model 3).\nPersons who are better educated may find themselves more\ninterested in the survey itself, or they may have more of an\nunderstanding of the potential usefulness of the survey; it is\nalso possible that they are less intimidated by the interviewer.\nAs hypothesized earlier, persons who live alone may be\nless likely to leave someone behind who knows their where-\nabouts when the interviewer is not able to locate the person;\nand renters, being more likely to move, have a greater\nchance of being lost to follow-up than those who own their\nhome (Models 3 and 4). Although it may be difficult to\nfollow people into nursing homes from the community,\nthose persons who have completed an interview in an institu-\ntion are no more likely to become nonrespondents than those\nliving in the community.\nBoth number of functioning problems and age are consist-\nent predictors of nonresponse. Age could be reflecting un-\nmeasured health dimensions that result in inability to re-\nspond. Or, in this sample of persons over 70 years of age, the\nolder cohort may be more averse to survey participation or\ncontact with strangers. The chance of institutionalization\nincreases with age, and persons moving into institutions may\nbe disproportionately lost to follow-up, either because they\ncannot be located, because they are unable to respond, or\nbecause a proxy or the institution refuses in their behalf.\nHaving another sample person in the household is strongly\nrelated to nonresponse. This could mean that having another\nsample person in the house increases the burden of response\nso that both members do not feel a need to participate. They\nmay feel that one person telling the \"family story\" is\nsufficient. However, in interpreting the effect of another\nhousehold member in the survey, the reference category\nmust be clarified. When living alone is included along with\nhaving a sample person in the household, the omitted refer-\nence group becomes living with a nonsample person. Living\nwith another sample person and living alone are associated\nwith about the same increase in relative risk of nonresponse\ncompared with persons who are living with other nonsample\npersons. Another sample person must be older because the\nsample is limited to those 70 and over. Those living with\nnonsample persons would generally be living with someone\nyounger, who was not eligible for the survey. Thus, the\neffect of a sample member in the household could really be\nthe effect of an older household context versus a younger\nhousehold context. In that case, the relationship between\nnonresponse and having another sample member in the\nhouse could be caused by a greater inability to locate older\nhouseholds.\nThe coefficients of the interval variables indicate whether\n(and how) the odds of becoming a nonrespondent differ at\nthe second and third intervals with reference to the first\n(Model 4). The significance of the dummy variable for the\nthird interval indicates that those persons responding at the\nTable 4.

There was\nno significant difference in the likelihood of loss between the\nfirst and second interviews after baseline.\nAs noted earlier, the LSOA has a complex sample design.\nTo examine the sensitivity of these results to the violation of\nthe independence of observations assumption, we again\nemploy GEE (Groemping, 1994), now correcting the stand-\nard errors for correlation within the sampling clusters. We\nfind our results unchanged.\nThe probability of nonresponse. -- Having identified\nwhich characteristics are associated with the relative risk of\nnonresponse in this sample, the next question is: How does\nvariation in these characteristics affect the absolute probabil-\nity of becoming a nonrespondent? To explore this question,\nin Table 5 the mean probability of becoming a nonrespon-\ndent is estimated for selected categories of each of the sig-\nnificant predictor variables using the results of Model 4 from\nTable 4. These probabilities provide useful information on\nthe absolute size of the effect of certain characteristics in this\nsample.\nFor example, if our entire sample were age 70 and each\nindividual retained all other observed characteristics, the\nmean probability of becoming a first-time nonrespondent\nwould be 7.7 percent. If the whole sample were 90 years old,\nthe probability of becoming a nonrespondent would increase\napproximately 3 percentage points to 10.8 percent. Simi-\nlarly, having another sample person in the household, re-\ngardless of whether that person chose to respond or not,\nresults in an increase of 3 percent in the probability of\nnonresponse to the subsequent interview. If our entire sam-\nple had difficulty with all 13 ADLs and IADLs, the mean\nprobability of nonresponse would increase from .0849 (hav-\ning no difficulty with any functions) to . 1695. This is the\nlargest contrast among the characteristics listed.\nOf course, any given person would have some combina-\ntion of these characteristics. In this sample, the highest\nprobability of becoming a nonrespondent (.32428) occurred\nin the final interval for a 95-year-old Black woman who\nreported no formal education, was living alone at the time of\nthe third interview; she was not institutionalized, but neither\nwas she a homeowner. She reported having difficulty with 5\nof 13 possible ADL and IADL tasks. The lowest observed\nyear-old White man with 18 years of education, living with\nhis spouse at that first interview in 1984 in a home he owned,\nand reporting no difficulty with any ADL or IADL.

Each had re-\nsponded to the first two interviews.\nCompensatingfor Nonresponse\nActual probabilities of nonresponse are calculated for\nthe significant coefficients from Model 4, Table 4. These\nprobabilities are then used to construct weight adjustment\nfactors to compensate for any bias in the remaining sample\ndue to nonrandom nonresponse over the three survey inter-\nvals in the LSOA. The effect of using the adjusted weights is\nillustrated by comparing results using only the weights\nprovided with the survey to adjust for the sampling strategy\nwith the weights that compensate for sample loss as well as\nthe sample design.\nConstructing weights. -- Because the LSOA is a multi-\nstage cluster sample, the LSOA sample weight is provided to\nadjust for baseline nonresponse to the SOA and the subsam-\npling of certain populations. The weight adjusts the baseline\nsample so that it is representative of the noninstitutionalized\nrace, and age. We use this sample design weight for the\nbaseline data and then modify it cumulatively at each succes-\nsive wave to compensate for loss to follow-up. The weights\nTable 6.

When these weights are applied, the contribution of\nthose persons who actually respond is inflated to also repre-\nsent those who did not respond, based on characteristics\nincluded in the computation of the probabilities. Thus, the\nweights alter the distribution of the characteristics in the\nsample to reflect the greater propensity of persons with\ncertain characteristics to become nonrespondents.\nEffect of weightingfor nonresponse. -- Table 6 compares\n1990 calculated in two ways: weighting only with the nor-\nmalized LSOA weight and weighting for loss to follow-up.\nUsing the LSOA weight, by 1990 the sample responding to\nADL questions had diminished to 2,562. However, the\nnonresponse weights increase the weighted sample size of\nthose responding to this question by 673 persons, making the\nweighted sample just 19 shy of what the total sample would\nhave been in 1990 if the only source of nonresponse had been\ndeath. (The difference of 19 is due to item nonresponse to\nthis question.)\nSince those in poor physical functioning are less likely to\nrespond, the use of nonresponse weights results in slight\nincreases in all the means. The size of the difference gets\nlarger in later years as there is more loss to follow-up and\nbecause the loss has been accumulating. However, the\ndifferences between the two estimates for any one year are\nstatistically and substantively insignificant. Examining sam-\nincrease in the average number of ADLs would be .24 with\nadjusted weights and .20 without. For IADLs the increase\nwould be .05 versus .02. While greater, the difference is not\nsignificant. Note that these tests of significance are per-\nformed using the actual, not the weighted, sample size.\nTable 7 shows the differences resulting from the two sets\nof weights in the estimated percentage making a two-year\ntransition from no difficulty performing an ADL or IADL to\nTable 7.

Using these weights to\nadjust for nonresponse makes little difference in either sam-\nple means or proportions making transitions even among the\noldest persons in the sample, who are presumably both more\nfrail and more likely to become lost to follow-up.\nCorrecting/or nonresponse with a bivariate probit model.\n-- Most researchers ultimately use multivariate analyses,\nhowever, and the weighting method proposed above is not\ntypically used in that context. A bivariate probit with selec-\ntion (Greene, 1992) allows us to simultaneously estimate the\nprobability of nonresponse and the probability of making a\ntransition of substantive interest, in this case, incident ADL\ndisability. Comparing the results of this simultaneously\nestimated model with those from a univariate probit indi-\ncates the effect of not taking attrition into account. Further-\nmore, we are able to determine whether results are biased by\nsome characteristics we have not observed, such as distaste\nfor survey response, cognitive impairment, or circumstances\nassociated with moving into a nursing home. The correlation\nbetween the error terms for the two equations (rho), repre-\nsenting the unobserved influences common to both the pro-\ncess of disability and attrition, is included in the estimation.\n(For details of the method see Greene [1993] and for another\nThe results of the bivariate probit are presented in Table 8\nalong with probit results for the two equations estimated\nseparately. Note that the dependent variable for the selection\nequation is the same as the nonresponse outcome from Table\n4, but the coding is inverted (1 = respondent) so the signs\nare opposite.

This reduces\nthe number of observations to 6,597 and accounts for the\nnow nonsignificant effect of living alone. Rho itself is not\nsignificant, and there are only very small differences in the\nestimates and levels of significance when rho is controlled,\nsuggesting minimal bias in these estimates due to loss to\nfollow-up.\nDISCUSSION\nOur analysis has demonstrated the dramatic sample loss in\na panel survey of older persons. Decrement to the sample\noccurs through two distinct sources: loss to follow-up and\ndeath. Clearly, when a sample of older persons is followed\nfor even a few years, there is tremendous loss to death. In\nthis sample, over a third of the original population was lost to\ndeath in six years. We set out to determine whether loss to\nfollow-up in this sample is random; whether nonrandom loss\nsignificantly biases analytic results when evaluated with\ncorrection based on observed characteristics; and whether\nthere are unobserved differences between those who become\nlost and continuing respondents, and whether those differ-\nences alter our conclusions.\nThe LSOA has a significant amount of nonresponse,\nreaching almost 20 percent of those alive by the fourth wave.\nThose who are older, have lower educational attainment,\nlive alone, have worse functioning, and rent their homes are\nmore likely to become nonrespondents. We had hypothe-\nsized that certain characteristics previously found to be\nassociated with nonresponse were acting as proxies for\ncharacteristics that were not included in those analyses.\nAmong the variables previously identified as ambiguous in\ntheir relationship to attrition, we find that sex becomes insig-\nnificant when measures of living arrangement are included.\nAnd, once functioning ability is controlled, living alone\nemerges as a significant predictor of becoming a nonrespon-\ndent. We do not find any effect of race, a characteristic that\nseveral previous studies found to predict nonresponse.\nWe had expected persons living in an institution to be\nmore prone to loss to follow-up because they might be more\ndifficult to locate, because of the possibility of resistance\nfrom the institution or caregivers, or because of increased\nfrailty beyond what has been included in the model. Among\npersons who have been interviewed in an institution, nonre-\nsponse at subsequent interviews is not more likely than for\ncommunity-dwelling persons. Although previous analysis\nfinds that persons moving into institutions are disproportion-\nately lost to follow-up (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito,\n1994), we are not able to ascertain the extent to which this\nloss contributes to sample selection. Underrepresentation of\nthe institutionalized population poses an important threat to\nthe representativeness of older samples. However, while it\nmay be especially difficult to follow people into an institu-\ntion, once they have been successfully followed, they are not\nmore likely to be nonrespondents.\nFrequently surveys collect information from multiple\nmembers of a single household so that studies involving\nhousehold behavior may be completed. We find in this\nsurvey that having another sample person in the household\nincreases the probability of nonresponse considerably, rela-\ntive to living with other nonsample persons. Households\nwith two sample persons are older, and as such are less likely\nto have job ties, and may more freely move for amenities, or\nsocial or environmental support. Those living with older\nrespondents are also more likely to become widowed during\nthe course of the survey, and this may be the catalyst for a\nmove or a loss of interest in survey participation. Household\nresponse behavior is clearly an area in which further research\nwould be useful. The lesson from this finding is not that\nsurvey designs including multiple sample members from a\nsingle household should be avoided, as this would result\nin a loss of valuable information. Rather, awareness that\nsuch sample persons may be more prone to loss to follow-up\nmight call for special attention to retaining these sample\nmembers.\nThese findings suggest that wave nonresponse in this\nsample of older persons is not random. Characteristics asso-\nciated with nonresponse may be used to develop targeting\ncriteria for those interested in the retention of sample per-\nsons. Loss to follow-up could be lowered if survey organiza-\ntions made special efforts to maintain contact with renters\nand those who live alone. In addition, extra effort might be\ndevoted to retaining those in worse health and the oldest old.\nThose with less education might be converted to continuing\nresponse with extra educational effort.\nAlthough our results are consistent with our general typol-\nogy of nonrespondents as people who refuse, are unable to\nrespond, and who cannot be located, a useful elaboration of\nthis analysis would consider predictors of nonresponse by\nreason for nonresponse. Indeed, if sufficient heterogeneity\nbetween types of nonresponse exists, the salience of the\npredictors considered here may have been obscured because\nwe have grouped all types of nonresponse. Unfortunately, in\nthis survey reasons for not-completed interviews were insuf-\nficiently differentiated for such an analysis. We cannot over-\nemphasize the need to accurately record some detail about\nwhy interviews are not completed. It will not be possible to\neither improve response rates or more effectively evaluate the\nextent of nonresponse bias without this information.\nIn order to evaluate whether this nonrandom nonresponse\nbiases analytic results, we constructed response probability\nweights based on the characteristics observed to increase the\nprobability of nonresponse. The approach to developing\nweights suggested here allows for optimal use of each\nsample member's contribution to the survey by estimating\nresponse probabilities within each interval and applying\nthese to form a cumulative weight. Weighting on these\ncharacteristics restored the characteristics of this sample to\nwhat they would have been without the loss, but did not sig-\nnificantly affect univariate and bivariate distributions. Ide-\nally, initial nonresponse (nonresponse to the baseline inter-\nview) could be included in this phase; in practice, informa-\ntion on the characteristics of these persons is frequently\nunavailable. In this study, partial compensation is made\nbecause the LSOA weights on which the nonresponse\nweights are based adjust the distributions of age, sex, and\nrace to account for initial nonresponse to the NHIS and\nSOA, which comprise the baseline sample of the LSOA.\nUltimately, we need to assess the effect of nonrandom\nnonresponse in a multivariate environment. We have pre-\nsented a substantive analysis predicting incident disability\nand evaluated it for nonresponse bias with correction for\nselection by attrition. By including the correlation between\nthe error terms of the two equations, this procedure also\nadjusts the coefficients for the unobserved characteristics\naffecting both processes. Thus, we can observe whether our\noriginal coefficients changed (i.e., whether they were bi-\nased), and also whether the unobserved characteristics them-\nselves had a significant effect on incident disability. In this\nsurvey, for our outcome of interest, unobservables did not\nhave a significant effect and did not bias our results.\nWe find, then, that nonresponse in this sample of older\npersons is not random. Also, however, we find that this\nnonrandom nonresponse does not produce bias of any conse-\nquence. Though significantly associated with the outcome,\nour observed variables were not strongly enough correlated\nwith the probability of nonresponse for the resulting weights\nto make much difference in the univariate and bivariate\ndistributions. However, these weights did not compensate\nfor differences between respondents and nonrespondents\nthat were not observed. The second diagnostic/adjustment\nprocedure we employ, the bivariate probit, would tell us if\nwe had omitted any such characteristics, but the outcome of\nthis procedure -- the lack of significance of rho -- suggests\nthat we had not. This tells us that although nonrespondents\nwere different from respondents on observed characteristics,\nthey did not differ on unobserved characteristics. Another\nexample of a similar analysis that finds significant differ-\nences on observed characteristics but no difference on those\nunobserved is presented by Whitehead, Groothuis, and\nBlomquist (1993). In that evaluation, however, adjusting for\nobserved characteristics did change results. In this study,\nsignificant differences between our respondents and nonre-\nspondents exist on observed variables only, but these differ-\nences are apparently not so large that adjusting for them\nalters our results. This is an important point, because it\nindicates that nonrandom nonresponse does not always fa-\ntally compromise the sample. An important caveat, how-\never, is that although there is a close relationship between\nthe result of compensating and the strength of the relation-\nship between the predictive characteristics and the outcome\npossible to tell whether an adjustment will make a difference\nWhile our analyses showed both nonrandom nonresponse\nand negligible nonresponse bias for the substantive outcome\nconsidered, there is no rule of thumb to ascertain whether\nbias exists for other outcomes or for other panel studies. The\nevaluation of the effects of the nonrandom nonresponse in\nthis survey is a single case study, applicable for others\nundertaking analysis with the LSOA, and hopefully a useful\ndemonstration of how to approach nonresponse evaluation\nfor those using other panel data.\n"
