He was not only an economist who mod-\nified Saint-Simonian positions to liberal ones but also a spe-\ncial world traveler and an influential advisor to Napoleon III.\nThis work will analyze Chevalier's arguments on the role\nof canal tariffs in economic growth. Although Chevalier also\nstudied import duties, this article will focus on Chevalier's\nthoughts concerning transport tariffs. As we shall see,\nChevalier was a common reference in the French debates on\nthe definition of tariffs in the transportation sector.\nFor Chevalier, this topic became of the utmost importance\nafter his journey to the United States in the 1830s. Henceforth,\nChevalier's discussion of tariffs became one of the most rel-\nevant discussions of European canal tariffs produced by a\n19th-century economist. The relevance of Chevalier's dis-\ncussion of tariffs culminated in a free trade treaty between\nEngland and France, notably named the Cobden\u00adChevalier\nTreaty.\nThis work will examine Chevalier's discussion of canal\ntariffs. We will do so considering his life and his main eco-\nnomic work, Le Cours d'\u00c9conomie Politique. There are sev-\neral aspects that emphasize the importance of the early\n19th-century discussions about tariffs or tolls. First, tolls\nwere realized to be elements that negatively impacted eco-\nnomic growth. Second, they were key elements in the debate\npitting individual freedom against public financing. Third,\nreinforced by Saint-Simon and his disciples (including\nChevalier), tolls were perceived as decelerating the rhythm\nof industrialization. Finally, the French debates on canal tar-\niffs produced the basis for the economic thought of the next\ngeneration of European thinkers, such as L\u00e9on Walras and\nthe Lausanne School.\nWe tested a crucial element of Chevalier's discussion: the\ninefficiency of 1830s French tariffs. This testing was con-\nducted using Chevalier's data and a modern instrument of\nefficiency evaluation: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It\nis important to perform this exercise (revise Chevalier's\nclaims) because using current statistical techniques, we can\nenlighten the field as to whether the analysis of Chevalier\nwas robustly founded by a proper statistical discussion.\nThe remainder of the article is organized as follows. In\nsection \"A Note on Chevalier's Life and Bibliography,\" we\nreview Chevalier's biography and published works. We also\nuse references not only to historians but also to contempo-\nraries to show Chevalier's impact on academics and politics.\nIn section \"Chevalier's Cours d'\u00c9conomie Politique and His\nDiscussions of Tariffs,\" we focus on his thoughts regarding\ntariffs, referring to his masterpiece Le Cours d'\u00c9conomie\nPolitique and to his letters.

The final section concludes.\nA Note on Chevalier's Life and\nBibliography\ning in a very interesting period of the 19th century. The\nFrance known by Chevalier was a country characterized by a\nproindustrialization movement.\nMichel Chevalier's social, economic, and political\nthoughts changed over the course of his life. Many authors\nconsider the young Michel Chevalier to be a disciple of Saint-\nSimon, primarily concerned about improving the quality of\nlife for his contemporary French industrial workers (Takashi,\n1980). As he aged, however, Chevalier increased his distance\nfrom the orthodox Saint-Simonians,1 although he retained the\nidea that social and economic development should be shared\namong all. As Drolet (2008) noted, \"Chevalier moved from\nbeing one of the fiercest critics of France's political establish-\nment to one of its most ardent defenders\" (p. 1229).\nCampagnolo (2009) stated that during his life, Chevalier\nalways believed that both productive entrepreneurship and\nstate intervention were necessary for a competitive environ-\nment. Of course, this universality was not well received by\nthe most orthodox thinkers, like Carl Grun (1845), who wrote\nthe following about Michel Chevalier:\nM. Chevalier still refers with great sympathy to the industrialists\n. . . But to the disciple, the industrialists are no longer, as they\nwere for his master, the proletarians; he includes capitalists,\nentrepreneurs and workers in one concept, that is to say, he\nincludes the idlers in a category which should only embrace the\nThe reasons for this distance from the orthodoxy are both\nphysical and ideological. In other words, this distancing\nfrom orthodoxy is due to his journey across the Atlantic\nOcean, where he had the opportunity to experience different\npeople, different economic organizations, and, especially, a\nnew inspiration for his ideas to develop the French economy\nwas focused on the European reality and wrote in favor of\npan-Mediterranean free trade, which he argued was also\nimportant for peace between the East and West:\nThe Mediterranean was an arena, a closed field, where for thirty\ncenturies, the East and the West fought battles. Henceforth the\nMediterranean must be like a vast forum where all the previously\ndivided nations will unite together.The Mediterranean will become\nthe wedding-bed of the East and the West. (Chevalier, 18322)\n(essential to understanding his future critiques of French\ntolls) was described in his book Society, Manners, and\nPolitics in the United States.3 This book is a composition\nconcerning the American economy (or society) observed as\n\"a model of industry.\" According to Chevalier, it should be\nhighlighted how poor Irish men thrived after so little time in\nAmerica. The reasons for success point not just to some par-\nticularly American institutions (such as a business culture\nand proemployment education) but mainly to efficient\nAmerican means of transport and internal tariffs; namely, it\nwas the tariffs on the Erie Canal that exerted a special effect\non Chevalier's observations, as is documented in detail in the\nfollowing section. The transport and tariffs that Chevalier\nobserved were the result of intense federal and state debates\nthat had begun in the 1820s (initially with the strong opposi-\ntion to protectionist tariffs from Southern congressmen;\nAfter visiting the United States, a trip that is well docu-\nmented by Jennings (2006), Chevalier also traveled to\nMexico and Cuba (1835), where he strengthened the idea of\na Panama Canal linking the Atlantic to the Pacific and devel-\noped his principles of a Pan-American alliance of countries.\nAccording to Monteiro (2008), after this tour, Chevalier\nbecame one of the first authors to explore the concept of a\n\"Latin American country.\" This was mainly due to his sup-\nport of LatinAmerican countries being freed from the admin-\nistrations of Portugal and Spain.\nThese ideas were influential in South American countries,\ndeveloping, for instance, the basis of Poucel's thoughts\nregarding the need for reinforcing French support to the\nyoung South American countries that were reaching\nindependence.4\nAfter returning to Europe, Chevalier visited Great Britain\nin 1851, recognizing that England's prosperity was due to\nindustrialization. This industrialization was symbolized by\nthe Crystal Palace in Sydenham, which was built for the\nLondon Great Exhibition of 1851. The construction of this\npalace impressed him deeply, especially its rapidity and the\nbuilding's design and transparency to light. However, he was\nmainly impressed by British tariffs, which could be noted as\nthe first signal of his favor of the future Cobden\u00adChevalier\nTreaty5 (although Nye, 1991, confirmed that British tariffs\nwere consistently lower than those of France).\nIn 1820-70, these mercantilist barriers were largely eliminated.\nThe UK removed all tariff barriers and trade restrictions between\ncolonies, and in quasi-colonies such as China, Thailand and\nTurkey. In Germany, the customs union (Zollverein) of 1834\nended barriers between the German states and the external\nChevalier Treaty removed French quantitative restrictions and\nreduced tariff barriers to a modest level. This was followed by\nFrench commercial treaties with Belgium, the Zollverein, Italy,\nSwitzerland, Spain and other countries. These treaties had\nReis Mourao 3\nmost-favoured-nation clauses which meant that bilateral\nliberalisation applied equally to all countries. (Chapter 3, p. 3)\nAlthough recognized mostly for his later political influ-\nence in the Second Empire and as one of Napoleon III's clos-\nest advisors,6 Chevalier's academic role as a professor at\nColl\u00e8ge de France was not limited to his influential books.7\nFor instance, Chevalier, along with Villerm\u00e9 and Hyppolite\nPassy, was also one of the founders of the Societ\u00e9 Statistique\nde Paris (Statistical Society of Paris; Martin, 2001).\nBy this time, his influence was already being recognized\nnot only by economists but also in the political world. For\ninstance, Chevalier's bibliography led to fevered debates and\nsignificant replicas, such as Gottfried Duden's critique of\nChevalier's (1837) Letters on North America, as noted by\nRowan (2009), or Carl Grun's critique of Chevalier's Saint-\nSimonism, which Marx and Engels (1845) severely reproved.\nOther remarkable influences were assumed by Carl Menger.\nAccording to Campagnolo (2009), Menger cited Chevalier\n56 times in his leading Grunds\u00e4tze.\nChevalier's Cours d'\u00c9conomie Politique\nand His Discussions of Tariffs\nReturning to the original edition (published by Capelle,\nLibraire-Editeur, in Paris8), we confirm that the book was\nfirst year of graduation. As usual, the lectures had been col-\nlected by an assistant to Chevalier (M. A. Bro\u00ebt) and autho-\nrized by the professor. The first two sections of this manual\nare composed from two opening discourses by Chevalier\nlectures:\n1st: On the relationship between individual freedom and\n2nd: On the relationship between distribution and economic\n3rd: On economic growth and the role of agriculture (pp.\n5th: On the role of capital in improving the well-being of\n11th: On comparing land ways, water ways and railroads (pp.\nAll of these lectures were written according to a histori-\ncist perspective typical among Saint-Simonian disciples (see\nout the conclusions of his arguments. He then exposes these\narguments while referencing a few statistical data points and\nmany historical cases. Finally, he synthesizes the observa-\ntions, highlighting the previously introduced conclusion.\nAs previously noted, there are a significant number of\nauthors who have discussed Chevalier's Saint-Simonism and\nbibliography as a whole. However, Chevalier's Cours\nd'\u00c9conomie Politique is substantially important for under-\nstanding the evolution of many of Saint-Simonians to liber-\ntarian positions and for its reflection of the general European\nconviction that the best way for countries to grow economi-\ncally was a rapid and substantial investment in transportation\nthrough tariff reductions.\nThe question of tariff reduction was one of the most\nimportant questions debated in Europe and America in the\nfirst half of the 19th century. At the time, there were intense\ndebates in France among transportation specialists.9 The foci\nof these debates were not only inland waterways (including\ncanals) but also the emerging railroads. Authors like\nChevalier himself or Jules Dupuit (Groenewegen, 1983;\nimportance of tariffs for economic growth but also were con-\ncerned with their redistributive function via the pricing sys-\ntem. It is also important to mention the debates among the\neconomist-engineers from the Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es, which\nbolstered contemporary economic thinking regarding pricing\nin transportation.\nWhen we read Chevalier's Cours carefully, it is easy to\nsee that it is not a general economics book in the way we\nconceptualize it today, as a general introductory book for a\nfirst-year undergraduate economics course. Chevalier's\nCours is concerned primarily with free trade and arguing\nagainst tariffs.10 The concluding claim is clear: France\nimposed excessive tariffs on the majority of goods and ser-\nvices, which diminished its rhythm of growth and, obviously,\ndiminished the success of its distribution efforts.\nAs noted by Takashi (1980), Chevalier had tried to put\nthese ideas into practice some years before. Seeking to\nreduce tariffs,11 he proposed an enormous development plan\n4 SAGE Open\nfor French ways of communication in 1838 to improve the\nlinkage among usable rivers and railroads. This plan would\nwas actually approved by the ministry had a final cost of 2.8\nmillion francs.\nChevalier observed that although France and England had\nthe same area and almost the same population, they had very\ndifferent systems and efficiencies regarding water canals. As a\nresult, Chevalier stated, \"les canaux fran\u00e7ais ne rendent pas la\ndixi\u00e8me partie des services qu'on est en droit d'en rendre\"12\n(Chevalier, p. 303). Chevalier knew that tolls covered infra-\nstructure costs.13 This point is noteworthy, as the 19th-century\ntransportation specialists argued (particularly Jules Dupuit,\naccording to Simonin & Vatin, 2002). Chevalier wanted to dis-\ncuss the fact that in some instances, toll levels were exceeding\ninfrastructures costs, which consequently limited the exten-\nsion of the market and eventually economic growth.\nChevalier used data on American canals from 1835 to\nwere collected directly from official sources. After 1842,\nChevalier considered a more rigorous examination of these\ndata because in the second edition of Chevalier (1842), that\nreprinting the original table and adding a note on the stability\nof canal tariff during the studied period.\nWhen comparing French withAmerican canals, Chevalier\nis even more emphatic:\nLes canaux am\u00e9ricains sont ceux qui ont donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats les\nChevalier did not particularly focus on English, Belgian,\nand Dutch tariffs (which he considered low), but he did\napplaud American tariffs:\nIl est evident que par cela m\u00eame que les canaux am\u00e9ricains ont\nen g\u00e9n\u00e9ral une grande longueur, on a d\u00fb \u00e9tablir des tarifs\nmod\u00e9r\u00e9s; autrement les marchandises parcourant de longs\ntrajets, elles auraient acquitt\u00e9 des droits qui en auraient trop\nFocusing specifically on the Erie Canal as representative\nof other American canals,16 Chevalier noted,\nSes profits sont tels qu'il y a long-temps que le canal s'est pay\u00e9\nWith the exception of the Canal du Midi, Chevalier is not\nso gentle with French canals. Although recognizing that\nFrance was the first country to build canals, he concluded the\n12th lecture by stating that French tariffs should be lower and\nFrench canals should be improved significantly:\nSans pr\u00e9judice de l'abaissement des tarifs, si nous voulons tirer\nparti de nos canaux, il faut que nous sachions les porter \u00e0 un\nparfait \u00e9tat d'ach\u00e8vement, et qu'ensuite nous les maintenions\nUsing a t test on the equality of the means between French\nand American tariffs collected by Chevalier at four French\ncanals and at four American canals (Figure 1), we get the fol-\nlowing probability that the null hypothesis is observed\n(French tariffs are the same than American ones): manure,\nconclude now that French tariffs could not be so significantly\nhigher than American ones as Chevalier was claiming.\nIt thus becomes pertinent to ask the following: Was\nChevalier exaggerating due to his fascination with the British\nand American systems? Were his politics dominating his\ntechnical and academic abilities? Was he forgetting to con-\nsider the different economic and social conditions of France\nand America? Or, was he interested in increasing the rhythm\nFigure 1. Chevalier's data on tolls.\nReis Mourao 5\nof change by denouncing a larger gap than was actually pres-\nent between French and British or American tariffs?\nToward a Discussion on Chevalier's\nClaims Using DEA Analysis\nThis section will use DEA to test Chevalier's argument that\nFrench tariffs were exorbitantly high for his contemporaries\nand fellow citizens. DEA is a nonparametric programming\napproach to technical frontier estimation (Coelli, 1996). It\nallows us to compute efficiency measures considering given\noutputs and a set of inputs. Although the number of academic\nworks focusing on historical data using DEA is currently not\nas large as the number of works that use DEA to analyze\nmore recent data, this approach has received increased atten-\ntion even from those who are interested in researching data\nNenovsky, Ivanov, & Mihaylova, 2008; Tankersley & Cuzan,\nWith Chevalier's data and with his claims on inputs, we\nuse an input-oriented model and a cost-minimization model\ncharacterized by variable returns to scale. We follow\nMcGillivray, McLean, Pahre, and Schonhardt-Bailey (2001),\nand we also consider each toll as the result of the inputs of\nthe transportation process.\nOur model (a cost-minimization model) is described by\nthe following minimization problem (Coelli, 1996):\nMin , *\n*,\nxi i i\nw x\n\nsubject to\n- + \n- \n =\n\ny Y\nx X\nN\ni\ni\n\n\n\n\n,\n,\n,\n.\n*\nIn our case (please refer the raw data in the appendix), w\ni\nis a 6 \u00d7 1 matrix of tolls19 for the ith canal and xi\n* (which is\ncalculated by the linear programming of DEA) is the cost-\nminimization vector of economic and geographical character-\nistics for the same ith canal. y\ni\n, xi\n* , or x\ni\nare also 6 \u00d7 1 matrixes.\nN1 is an 8 \u00d7 1 vector of ones (convexity constraint) as in\nCoelli (1996), with N being the number of firms (or, in our\ncase, the number 8 of canals).  is a 8 \u00d7 1 vector of constants.\nX is the 6 \u00d7 8 inputs matrix. Y is a 6 \u00d7 8 matrix of normalized\noutputs. Therefore, our minimization problem can be\ndescribed as a problem in which we want to achieve the maxi-\nmum output with the minimum value of inputs' expenses or\ninputs'costs (Coelli, 1996). For instance, for the same output,\na canal with a toll of five monetary units paid for 5 miles\nexhibits a more efficient ratio (in the perspective of the toll\npayer) than another canal with a toll of five monetary units\nonly paid for only 2 miles, keeping the other inputs (geo-\ngraphical and economic characteristics) constant.\nThe total cost efficiency (CE) or economic efficiency of\nthe ith canal would be calculated as CE =  \nwi xi wi xi\n* ,\nmeaning that CE is the ratio of minimum cost to observed\ncost.\nChevalier recognized that the tolls and the costs of each\ncanal changed both because of the nature of each transported\nproduct and six other geographical and economic dimen-\nsions (our inputs): the distance of each canal; the minimum,\nmaximum and differential of altitude; the market area; and\nthe population density. Therefore, we have to identify these\nfactors as inputs of our model.20\nOur first source for these variables is Chevalier's table\nthat is reproduced in Figure 1. We must remember, however,\nthat Chevalier's data exhibit some weaknesses: Besides\nbeing the product of individual collection from official\nreports, these data have not been conveniently discussed in\nterms of efficiency. Thus, DEA is an appropriate method for\nanalyzing Chevalier's claims on tariffs for various reasons.\nFirst, it has been proven to be an appropriate method for ana-\nlyzing efficiency related to decision-making units. Second,\nChevalier's complaints concerned the modest efficiency of\nFrench tariffs. Third, they allow the assumption of variable\n(as opposed to constant) returns to scale to characterize the\noutput.\nFor the topological characteristics, we also returned to\nBernstein (2005) for American canals. For the population\ndimensions of the regions around the canals, we used 19th-\ncentury data from the National Historical Geographic\nInformation System (NHGIS; for North American areas) and\nfrom the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes\nEconomiques (for French areas).\nThe descriptive statistics are at Table 1.\nOur raw data are shown in the appendix.\nIt is clear that our model should assume variable returns\nto scale because constant returns to scale is adequate only\nwhen we are observing decision-making units operating at\nan optimal scale (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984). When\ndecision-making units face imperfect competition, con-\nstraints on finance, or different geographical areas, then it is\nargued that a variable return to scale model is the most\nappropriate. Our model is an input-oriented model because\nthis orientation is associated with the cost-minimization\nmodel and because, as Coelli and Perelman (1996) assumed,\nthis orientation is preferred when input dimensions are the\nprimary decision variables.\nWe will pass over formal explanations of DEA and effi-\nciency concepts. For those interested in these themes, we\nsuggest Coelli (1996). To give an interpretation of the total\nCE values that we are going to report, we state that our effi-\nciency measure identifies the ratio of minimum cost to the\nobserved cost for each transported product:\nCE of each canal\nMinimum cost observed for all canals\nCost observed f\n=\no\nor each canal\n.\n6 SAGE Open\nIn our model, less efficient decision-making units (canals)\nface costs that are too high considering the set of inputs; the\nmost efficient decision-making units require lower costs to\nproduce the same unit of output produced by the less efficient\nunits. We ran our estimations using WIN4DEAP v.1.1.2.\nOur results on the efficiency of each canal detailed by\nChevalier are reported in Table 2 and graphically represented\nin Figure 2.\nTo help the reader, we offer an interpretation of the values\nin Table 2 and Figure 2. Focusing on a given product--\nmanure--we observe that the canals that exhibited the mini-\nmum cost (Efficiency estimate = 1) were Midi, Briare, and\nSchuylkill. In contrast, the Pennsylvania Canal can be con-\nfirmed as the canal characterized by the maximum cost\n(Efficiency estimate = 0). The Centre Canal can be high-\nlighted as a canal showing median costs (Efficiency estimate\n= 0.4) for manure and considering the set of inputs.\nOur estimates indicate that Chevalier (1842) was not far\noff. In fact, our estimates provide a mixed lecture on the effi-\nciency of tariffs. Two American canals, Schuylkill and\nDelaware, were identified as having the most efficient tariffs.\nThe two other American canals analyzed by Chevalier\n(1842), however, exhibit less efficient estimates--namely,\nhis highly favored Erie Canal and the Pennsylvania Canal.\nHowever, the Briare Canal also shows highly significant effi-\ncient tariffs, whereas Saint-Quentin Canal exhibits slightly\nlower values. The Centre Canal and Midi Canal are identi-\nfied as the French canals with the least efficient tariffs.\nOur values show that, considering the evolving reality,\nonly the Centre and Midi canals were as costly as Chevalier\nargued. However, examining within theAmerican reality and\nconsidering the set of inputs analyzed in our model, the Erie\nand Pennsylvania tariffs were too high for the users, even if\ntheir values were lower than French values.\nThe advantages of DEA method are known: We do not\nneed to know a priori the form of production frontier.\nNonparametric methods allow the DEAtest to ignore the spec-\nification of a particular functional form for the technology.\nMoreover, the use of small samples is possible (in our article,\neight canals considered as eight Decision Making Units\n[DMU]): From this perspective, the methodology required for\nusing Coelli's (1996) model is correct. We also know, how-\never, that this model is very sensitive to misspecified data and\nerrors due to the deterministic feature of the method: Each dis-\ncrepancy from the frontier is immediately interpreted as inef-\nficiency and statistical noise and inefficiency are not\ndistinguished. To account for these limitations, we also tested\ndifferent compositions of the set of inputs using the 63 differ-\nent combinations of the six inputs,21 and our results retained\nthe previously signaled pattern: Schuylkill and Delaware were\nthe most efficientAmerican canals, and Saint-Quentin was the\nmost efficient French canal. After running the 63 combina-\ntions and using SimLab (data sensitivity software), we\nobtained a central value for each estimate of efficiency and a\ncorresponding standard deviation. Full details are available\nunder request. Table 2 also expresses these values.\nTable 2.

Even with this innovation, our DEA results did\nnot change.\nOur results show that even when using modern techniques\nlike DEA, we are unable to confirm the efficiency of all\nAmerican canals' tariffs over French canals' tariffs. In fact,\nFrench canals exhibit efficiency values that are central val-\nues when compared with the extreme values assumed for\nAmerican canals.\nThis points to a political motivation behind Chevalier's\nemphasis on American canals. His argument was based only\non estimates for gross tariffs, and his claims were mainly\naimed at accelerating the improvement of the French sys-\ntem's methods of transportation. Highlighting the differences\nin tariffs, Chevalier reinforced the need for France to deepen\nthe process of industrialization through improved canals,\nrailroads, and land ways.\nConclusion\nThis work revisited the main aspect of the liberal Saint-\nSimonian Michel Chevalier's economic thought, namely,\nhis discussion of the role of tariffs in economic growth.\nChevalier was a Frenchman involved not only in the con-\ntroversies of Saint-Simonism but also in a global perspec-\ntive of economic growth and redistribution processes. His\njourneys around the world, especially to the Americas,\nclarified his thoughts and oriented them toward proindustri-\nalization preferences using convenient policies of transpor-\ntation. His reflections led him to discuss tariffs as a main\ntheme in his bibliography.\nHis book Cours d'\u00c9conomie Politique collected his main\neconomic thought as distilled by the classes he taught at the\nColl\u00e8ge de France in the 1840s. In this work, Chevalier\nclaimed that France was losing its rhythm of economic\ngrowth because French canal tariffs were too high compared\nwith British and American tariffs.\nWe proved in this article that Chevalier's claim was essen-\ntially political. Using DEA techniques, we calculated esti-\nmates of French tariffs that were not as inefficient as\nChevalier claimed. In fact, in our sample, some French tar-\niffs, such as the Briare Canal, exhibited the most efficient\nresults even when considering American tariffs. In this find-\ning, we can agree with authors like Nye (1991) and argue that\nChevalier was trying to denounce a larger gap than actually\nexisted to accelerate the changes he wished to see in French\ntransportation policy.\nFigure 2.
