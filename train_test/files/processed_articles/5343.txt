    "abstract": "Abstract\nContagious yawning--the urge to yawn when thinking about, listening to, or viewing yawning--is a\nwell-documented phenomenon in humans and animals. The reduced yawn contagion observed in\nthe autistic population suggested that it might be empathy related; however, it is unknown whether\nsuch a connection applies to nonclinical populations. We examined influences from both empathy\n(i.e., autistic traits) and nonempathy factors (i.e., individuals' perceptual detection sensitivity to\nyawning, happy, and angry faces) on 41 nonclinical adults. We induced contagious yawning with a\n5-minute video and 20 yawning photo stimuli. In addition, we measured participants' autistic traits\n(with the autism-spectrum quotient questionnaire), eye gaze patterns, and their perceptual\nthresholds to detect yawning and emotion in human face photos. We found two factors\nassociated with yawning contagion: (a) those more sensitive to detect yawning, but not other\nemotional expressions, displayed more contagious yawning than those less sensitive to yawning\nexpressions, and (b) female participants exhibited significantly more contagious yawning than male\nparticipants. We did not find an association between autistic trait and contagious yawning. Our\nstudy offers a working hypothesis for future studies, in that perceptual encoding of yawning\ninteracts with susceptibility to contagious yawning.\n",

However, an expanding range of hypotheses have been\nproposed, including an innate releasing mechanism (Provine, 1986, 1989), respiratory or\ncirculatory, thermoregulation, the arousal hypothesis, and the social communication view\n(for a review, see Guggisberg, Mathis, Schnider, & Hess, 2010). Among them, the most\nintriguing hypothesis that has aroused many researchers' interest is the link between empathy\nand contagious yawning. For instance, Platek, Critton, Myers, and Gallup (2003) found that\ncontagious yawning could be understood as a social behavior that involves mental attribution\n(i.e., the propensity to understand another's mental state). They found that individuals with\nhigher susceptibility to contagious yawning are better at recognizing their own faces (i.e., self-\nface recognition) and theory of mind tasks that capture one's social understanding.\nIf contagious yawning is indeed a social behavior, what is its purpose? Guggisberg and\ncoworkers (2010) attempted to explain the social function of contagious yawning by\nproposing yawning as a communication signal that spread to other people for survival\npurposes (i.e., the social or communication hypothesis of yawning). While the biological\nfoundation of yawning might be a change in physiological state (e.g., lung oxygen levels\ndecrease or brain temperature increases) in response to our environment, they proposed\nthat the contagious effect of yawning allowed us to communicate with our social group\nand promotes behavioral synchronization for facing potential threat. Indeed, this idea is\nnot entirely novel--in an earlier study, Provine (1989) stated that ``the chain reaction of\ncontagious yawning synchronizes the physiological as well as behavioral state of the\ngroup'' (p. 213). Similarly, Brothers (1990) introduced the idea that yawning could be a\nform of social signaling akin to laughter that is contagious. Although speculative, the\nsocial or communication hypothesis helps explain the social function of contagious\nyawning and suggests an account for the relationship between contagious yawning and\nsocial understanding.\nNeuroimaging studies have found that brain regions associated with contagious yawning\nare also related to social understanding and empathy. Activation in the ventromedial\nprefrontal cortex, which is known for the processing of social cues and recognition of\ncomplex emotional expression (Eslinger & Damasio, 1985; Wager, Phan, Liberzon, &\nTaylor, 2003), increased during free viewing of a yawning video but not when the video\nstimuli displayed gaping, coughing, or expressionless faces (Nahab, Hattori, Saad, &\n\u00a8 rmann et al. (2005) showed that BOLD response signals in the superior\ntemporal sulcus, a region known for being involved in facial expression recognition and\nempathy (see Narumoto, Okada, Sadato, Fukui, & Yonekura, 2001; Calder & Young,\n2005, for a review), increased significantly when participants watched yawning videos, but\nnot mouth opening videos, and was positively associated with the urge to yawn. Platek,\nMohamed, and Gallup (2005) also revealed that watching yawning videos evoked unique\nactivation in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, which play important roles in\ntheory of mind and social processing (Blakemore, Rees, & Frith, 1998; Fletcher et al., 1995).\nThese studies together suggest that brain regions involved in social processing may be heavily\ninvolved in contagious yawning.\nClinical reports also suggest that individuals' social understanding may relate to their\nsusceptibility to contagious yawning. Children aged 7 to 15 years who had been diagnosed\nwith an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)--a range of developmental disorders characterized\nby deficits in social interaction--showed reduced contagious yawning compared with\ntypically developing (TD) individuals when watching a yawning video but not when\nwatching a smiling video (Senju et al., 2007). Helt, Eigsti, Snyder, and Fein (2010)\nmatched mental ages between ASD and TD children aged 5 to 12 years and replicated the\nfinding that children with ASD were significantly less likely than TD children to yawn after\n2 i-Perception\nbeing exposed to the experimenter's yawn. In addition, Giganti and Esposito Ziello (2009)\ncompared the frequency of contagious yawning between ASD children with varied severity\n(characterized by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale) and found that children with low\nautistic severity elicited more contagious yawning than those with high autistic severity.\nThe clinical reports signified a possible relationship between autistic characteristics and\nsusceptibility to contagious yawning (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985; Platek et al.,\n2003). Nonetheless, it is unclear whether this connection applies to a nonautistic\npopulation that can be viewed as a continuous spectrum or exists only in the autistic\npopulation.\nPrevious studies have indicated that even among nonautistic populations, not all\nindividuals were susceptible to contagious yawning. Only 40% to 60% of the nonautistic\npopulation display contagious yawning in response to a yawn stimulus (Hoogenhout, van der\nStraaten, Pileggi, & Malcolm-Smith, 2013; Platek et al., 2003), indicating individual\nvariability in susceptibility to contagious yawning. However, little is known about factors\nthat determine such individual differences. To our best knowledge, only one recent study\nassessed a comprehensive range of factors in explaining individual variation in susceptibility\nto contagious yawning (Bartholomew & Cirulli, 2014). Among all variables (i.e., basic\ndemographics, empathy, sleep, cognitive performance, testing conditions, and time of day),\nage, not empathy, was the only factor that could significantly predict individual variation in\nsusceptibility to contagious yawning: Older participants yawned less than younger\nparticipants. Yet, age only explained 8% of the variation, which leaves a huge amount of\nvariation unexplained. Therefore, studies of other variables beyond the commonly studied\nsocial factors (e.g., empathy) are warranted.\nApart from social difficulties, one well-known characteristic of autistic people is their\natypical eye-gazing pattern during face processing, that is, looking at the mouth more than\nthe eyes (Blair, 2005; Gepner, Gelder, & Schonen, 1996; Golarai, Grill-Spector, & Reiss,\n2006). This perceptual distinction was proposed as an alternative account for the notable\nsocial deficits in the ASD population: Their proclivity for not attending to regions containing\nthe most social information (e.g., eyes) might create a perceptual bottleneck for the\nsubsequent processing of social interactions (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, & Jolliffe, 1997;\nInterestingly, two recent findings indicated that directing attention to the eyes could\neffectively restore susceptibility to contagious yawning in autistic individuals to the same\nextent as nonautistic individuals. Senju et al. (2009) instructed both participants with and\nwithout autism to fixate on a location where the eyes of face stimuli would appear.\nThe participants were asked to count the number of female faces while watching video\nclips of yawning or control mouth movements. When autistic individuals directed their\nattention to the eyes, they displayed equally frequent yawning responses toward yawning\nstimuli as did nonautistic individuals. Yet, this study lacked objective measurement (e.g., an\neye tracker) of the actual eye gaze to validate whether the effect was truly from gaze\nredirection. With the assistance of an eye tracker, Usui et al. (2013) initiated yawning or\ncontrol videos only after participating ASD children had continuously fixated on the eye\nregion of the actor for 500 ms. In the task, participating children counted the number of\nactors wearing glasses, and Usui et al. (2013) replicated the results from Senju et al.'s (2009)\nstudy. The importance of access to the eye region of an inducing stimulus was reported in\nnonclinical participants (Provine, 1989). When participants viewed a variety of yawning\nstimuli including a complete-face yawn, no-mouth yawn, no-eyes yawn, and a control\nstimulus (smile), complete-face yawns evoked significantly more yawners than a control\nsmiling face (Provine, 1989). The ``no-mouth'' yawn was the only stimuli with deleted\nChan and Tseng 3\nfacial features that generated as many yawners as the complete-face yawn. Conceivably,\nremoving facial features of a yawn increases the detection difficulty. This in turn\ndiminishes the contagion effect of yawning and evokes fewer yawners. This finding also\nsuggests that the eye region may contain more fundamental information to evoke\ncontagious yawning than the mouth region.\nOther than experimental manipulation to increase detection difficulty by reducing\naccessibility of facial parts to viewers, does an individual's inherent detection sensitivity to a\nyawning expression preclude his or her susceptibility to contagious yawning? This question is\ncurrently unanswered. Similar to contagious yawning, emotional contagion is well documented\nas a highly unconscious and automatic behavior of mimicking others' emotional expression.\nStudies have shown that individuals especially susceptible to emotional contagion are those\nwho can read others' emotional expressions and are sensitive to others' emotions (Doherty,\n1997), and that those who mimic others' expressions are better at recognizing others' emotions\n(Oberman, Winkielman, & Ramachandran, 2007; Stel & van Knippenberg, 2008). Although\nyawning is not considered an emotion and contagious yawning is not understood as an\nexample of emotional contagion, it is possible that a similar mechanism contributes to the\nindividual variation of both contagion phenomena.\nThe contagion effect occurs not only unintentionally in higher level imitation such as\naction or emotional contagion but also in lower level nonemotional responses such as\nheart rate (Dimascio, Boyd, & Greenblatt, 1957), pupil size (del Valle Loarte & Garcia\nRuiz, 2009; Harrison, Singer, Rotshtein, Dolan, & Critchley, 2006), and temperature\ncontagion (Cooper et al., 2014). The temperature of a participant's hand has been found\nto decrease significantly after s/he observed and rated the perceived temperature of actors\nwhose hands were immersed in ice-cold water. Since one possible function of yawning is to\nlower our body temperature to protect us from critical brain temperature rises, it is possible\nthat both contagious yawning and temperature contagion are important for temperature\nregulation (Gallup & Eldakar, 2013; Gallup & Gallup, 2008). Notably, the link between\nsensitivity to temperature contagion and empathy is not clear. A negative correlation\nbetween sensitivity to temperature contagion and the Mehrabian balanced emotional\nempathy scale (a 30-item questionnaire, including items such as ``It upsets me to see\nsomeone being mistreated'' rated on a 9-point agree\u00addisagree scale that assess individual's\nemotional empathy) was found. However, a positive correlation was found with the empathy\nconcern subscale of the Davis interpersonal reactivity scale rated on a 5-point scale (7-item\nEmpathy Concern subscale e.g., ``I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less\nfortunate than me''). This suggests that the relationship between individual differences in\nempathy and low-level contagion phenomena may not be a simple one.\nIn this study, we contributed to the little-investigated area of individual differences in\ncontagious yawning in a nonclinical population by observing individuals' autistic traits,\nand perceptual detection sensitivity to yawning expressions. We aimed to investigate the\ninterplay between one's yawning detection sensitivity and contagious yawning. We first\nattempted to extend the clinical findings of the link between autistic traits and contagious\nyawning to a nonclinical sample by examining the association between autism-spectrum\nquotient (AQ) scores and contagious yawning. Then, we tested the association between\nsensitivity to emotional/yawning expressions and contagious yawning. The study of\nindividuals' susceptibility to contagious yawning could provide insight into psychiatric\ndisorders such as schizophrenia and autism, as well as general human functioning related\nto yawning and the contagion effect. Our hypotheses are as follows:\n(1) Individuals with higher autistic tendency will display less contagious yawning.\n4 i-Perception\n(2) Individuals with higher sensitivity to yawning expressions will display more\ncontagious yawning.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTwenty male and 21 female Cantonese-speaking participants ranging from 19 to 26 years old\n(mean \u00bc 21.3, SD \u00bc 1.89) participated in exchange for course credits. Written informed consent\nwas obtained from all individual participants. Although there were no exclusion criteria during\nthe recruitment of participants, in a postexperiment interview, 34 participants (out of 41)\nreported that they were not taking any medication at the time of experiment and did not\nhave any history of psychiatric disorders including autism, which could affect one's\nperception and expression of one's own and others' emotions. We could not contact the\nremaining seven participants after the experiment.\nStimuli\nVideo stimuli to induce yawning. We recruited six actors and recorded two 5-minute videos while\nthey talked about their university lives. In one video, actors yawned 10 times in total with a\ngap of approximately 20 seconds in between. Each yawn lasted for 3 to 6 seconds. In the\nother control video, actors smiled 10 times with a gap of 20 seconds, and each smile lasted for\nPhoto stimuli to induce yawning. We took screenshots of 20 actors yawning at the maximum\nintensity from a video aimed to induce yawning made available to the public by\nAsapSCIENCE online (https://youtu.be/AJXX4vF6Zh0). Half of the actors were female.\nDue to availability, all actors were Caucasian except for one Asian male.\nPerceptual detection sensitivity task. We tested participants' detection thresholds in three\nexpression categories: happiness, anger, and yawning. We first selected stimuli that would\nallow us to generate a complete psychometric function to estimate the thresholds. Therefore,\nat one end of the spectrum were the expression that needed to be obviously present (so that\nparticipants would always report positive detection); at the other end of the spectrum were\nthe expression that needed to be obviously absent (so that participants would never report\ndetection). Later we describe how the tested images were selected.\nYawning. Because there were no standardized images for yawning available, we first took\nscreenshots of a total of 29 potential yawning photo stimuli from the same video used for\ncreating photo stimuli to induce yawning. We took screenshots of four actors in the video who\ndisplayed gradual yawns with various intensities. All photos were then rated twice in an online\nquestionnaire pilot study by 22 individuals (11 male) on a 5-point rating (1\u00bc completely\ndisagree, 5 \u00bc completely agree) to answer the question ``The person in the photo is yawning.''\nThe average rating of each photo ranged from 1.05 (strong disagreement) to 4.50 (strong\nagreement), mean\u00bc 3.19. Based on the average rating for each image, we classified the\nphotos into four levels of intensity: High (4\u00c6 0.5), medium (3 \u00c6 0.5), low (2\u00c6 0.5), and not\nyawning (1 \u00c6 0.5). For easy reference, we labeled the four conditions with numbers (1\u00bc not\nyawning to 4 \u00bc high). We selected three photos at each intensity level (see Figure 1). Six of the\n12 photos were of females, and the other six were of males.\nChan and Tseng 5\nHappy. We used FaceGen Modeler (Singular Inversions Inc., 2010), a data-driven statistical\nmodel based on three-dimensional laser-scanned face database (Blanz & Vetter, 1999) for\ngenerated face stimuli. This allowed us to parametrically adjust along multiple dimensions\nincluding age, gender, ethnicity, and emotional expression. We chose to use FaceGen because\nit has been validated by human participant rating (Roesch et al., 2011) and has been widely\nused in studies related to emotional expression (e.g., Hass, Weston, & Lim, 2016; N'Diaye,\nto test participants' sensitivity to detect happy faces, we first generated 36 happy faces from\nfour identities (two females) with FaceGen Modeler by varying expressiveness at 0%, 12%,\nthree ethnicities were selected for diversity (i.e., two European females, one East Asian male,\nand one South Asian male). The same group who rated the yawning photos rated these\nphotos using the same procedure by answering the question ``The person in the photo is\nFigure 1. Yawning photo stimuli for perceptual detection sensitivity task.\n6 i-Perception\nhappy.'' The average rating of each photo ranged from 1.17 (strong disagreement) to 4.76\n(strong agreement), mean \u00bc 3.07. We used the average rating to classify the photos into four\nand not happy (< 2.5). For easy reference, we labeled the four intensities as follows: high \u00bc 4,\nmedium \u00bc 3, low \u00bc 2, and not happy \u00bc 1. The final selection of 12 photos (three in each\nintensity, six female) is shown in Figure 2(a).\nAngry. An identical procedure was applied to produce angry face stimuli. We first generated\n36 angry faces from four new identities (two females) of three ethnicities (i.e., two European\nmale, one East Asian female, and one South Asian female) using FaceGen Modeler.\nThe average rating of each photo ranged from 1.25 (strong disagreement) to 4.75 (strong\nagreement), mean \u00bc 3.09. The final selection of 12 photos (three in each intensity, half female)\nis shown in Figure 2(b).\nApparatus and Procedure\nThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Hong Kong.\nAll participants were tested individually in a quiet room between 2 and 6 p.m. to avoid the\npeak hours of yawning among young adults (Zilli, Giganti, & Uga, 2008). All participants\nwere informed that the study was on impression formation and they had to select a suitable\ndrama character candidate from each video that fit the requirements of the character role.\nThe cover story aimed to disguise the true purpose of this study. All participants were asked\nto sign an informed consent form.\nParticipants first completed the AQ questionnaire (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner,\nMartin, & Clubley, 2001) and the Perceived Arousal Scale (PAS; Nicassio, Mendlowitz,\nFussell, & Petras, 1985) followed by 1 minute of music to relax. To induce yawning,\nparticipants watched one 5-minute yawning and one 5-minute control smiling video, in\ncounterbalanced order before they viewed an additional 20 yawning photos. The 5-minute\nvideo stimuli included neutral expressions of 20 to 23 seconds alternating with 3 to 6 seconds\nof yawning or smiling for 10 times in total. Twenty yawning photos were shown after both\nFigure 2. (a) Happy and (b) angry photo stimuli of different intensities used in the emotional detection task.\nChan and Tseng 7\nyawning and control videos were watched. Each photo appeared for 5 seconds in random\nsequence. After viewing all photos, participants rated their urge to yawn on a 5-point scale in\nresponse to the statement ``The photo made me want to yawn'' (1 \u00bc completely disagree,\n5 \u00bc completely agree). A Tobii T120 eye-tracking system was used to present stimuli and\nrecord observers' eye-gazing patterns while a separate hidden webcam recorded the\nparticipants' yawning. The area of interest (AOI) for eye-gazing pattern is the eye and\nmouth region of the actor (Figure 3(a) and (b)). At the end, participants were debriefed,\nand the purpose of the research was explained in detail. The experimenter informed\nparticipants that their yawning behavior was recorded by a hidden webcam and asked\ntheir permission for later behavioral coding. All participants granted their permission to\nthe experimenter to use their video in addition to the consent form signed at the beginning\nof the experiment.\nObservers' detection sensitivity was estimated from their judgment of whether the person\nin a photo was yawning or not by pressing a yes or a no key. Similarly, in a separate block,\ntheir sensitivity to anger was obtained by judging whether the person in a photo was angry or\nnot. The same applied for the sensitivity to happiness. Each expression contained 60 photos\n(4 intensities \u00c2 3 identities \u00c2 5 repeats). Each photo was shown for 2 seconds on a 19-in.\nViewSonic G90fB monitor and displayed in random sequence. Three practice trials were\ngiven prior to the real experiment to familiarize participants with the response keys.\nCoding of Yawning\nThe yawning responses of participants were later encoded offline by a coder blind to the video\nsequences. The coder would record the presence of yawning when the subject displayed\ngaping of the mouth with a long inspiration and short expiration (Usui et al., 2013). Since\ninhibition of yawning may occur due to politeness (Provine, 2005), which was also reported\nFigure 3. Stimuli marked with areas of interest (eyes and mouth). (a) 5-minute video stimuli alternated\nbetween neutral expression and yawning (10 alternations in total). (b) A yawning photo with the highest\nintensity. The eye and mouth regions of actor's yawning were marked as area of interest (AOI; the red\noutlines in the figures did not appear in the real experiment).\n8 i-Perception\nby participants in the pilot study, a hint of yawning with opening of nostril without mouth\nopening or eyes closing was also counted as yawning. Participants were also asked to report\ntheir urge to yawn on a 5-point scale after the yawning photo stimuli, to assess their\nsubjective feelings in addition to their overt behavior. This way of measuring ``yawning\nsusceptibility'' has also been used in past studies (e.g., Schu\nResults\nSince our count data of contagious yawning are highly skewed and contained an excessive\ncount of zeros (55%), we examined the association between contagious yawning and other\nvariables using a Poisson regression (Hoogenhout et al., 2013), which is well suited for this\nkind of count data.\nTo facilitate cross-study comparison, we reported effect size of each statistical test.\nEffect size (r) of nonparametric test, including Mann\u00adWhitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed\nRank test, is calculated with the formula,\nr \u00bc\nZ\nffiffiffiffi\nN\np\nwhere Z represents z value of the Mann\u00adWhitney U or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, and N\nrepresents sample size. The effect size of Poisson regression is reported in odd ratios (labeled\nas eB; e \u00bc Exp; B \u00bc standardized coefficient).\nAQ Score\nwith individuals with ASD, 80% obtained an AQ score higher than 32 (Baron-Cohen et al.,\n2001). Although in our sample two participants obtained an AQ score higher than 32 (37 and\n38, respectively), neither subject had been diagnosed with ASD.\nAn independent t test indicated that there was no significant gender difference in total AQ\nscore, p \u00bc .493, Cohen's d \u00bc 0.22. We used a nonparametric Mann\u00adWhitney test to examine\ngender differences in AQ subscales as the scores in each scale were not normally distributed.\nAll AQ subscales (i.e., communication, social skills, attention switching, attention to details,\nand imagination) had no significant gender differences.\nPerceived Arousal Scale\nThe PAS score indicates the arousal level of participants before starting the experiment\n(Anderson, Anderson, & Deuser, 1996; Anderson, Deuser, & DeNeve, 1995). The PAS is a\nscale developed to measures participants' overall arousal with a high internal reliability\n(Anderson et al., 1995) and has been widely used in studies of hostile or aggressive\nbehavior (e.g., Anderson, Carnagey, & Eubanks, 2003; Glascock, 2015; Ivory & Kaestle,\n2013). Participants rated 24 adjectives on a 5-point scale including 10 adjectives reflecting\nhigh arousal and 14 adjectives reflecting low arousal. A total arousal score is derived by\nreverse scoring the low arousal subscale and summing the high arousal subscale score with\nthe low arousal subscale score. Thus, a higher total score indicates higher arousal. The\npossible range of the score is 24 (lowest arousal) to 120 (highest arousal). The PA score of\nbaseline condition average (86.1) in Anderson et al. (1995). The PA score was not associated\nChan and Tseng 9\nwith the counts of yawning, Poisson regression: 2(1, N \u00bc 40)\u00bc0.00, p \u00bc .99, eB ranged from\nContagious Behavior\nWe examined the participants' yawning behavior. Nineteen of the 41 participants (46.3%)\nyawned contagiously at least once in either the yawning video or the photo section, which fell\ninto the range reported in previous studies (i.e., 45%\u00ad60%; Hoogenhout et al., 2013; Platek\net al., 2003). The average frequency of contagious yawning obtained in both the yawning\nthat the yawning stimuli made them want to yawn (a score of 4 or above on a 5-point scale),\nsimilar to a past study that used the same measure of yawning susceptibility (i.e., 40%;\nNahab et al., 2009). The median score of urge to yawn reported after watching all the\nyawning stimuli was 3 out of 5.\nOne subject was excluded from the analysis as her contagious yawning frequency exceeded\n2 SD (i.e., an outlier). Therefore, data of 40 participants were entered into the final analysis.\nAll statistical analyses were completed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences\nYawning-Induction Stimuli Validation\nTo validate our yawning-induction stimuli, we conducted a nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed\nRanks test to compare the frequency of yawning during the presentation of control versus\nyawning stimuli. The frequency of yawning during the presentation of yawning stimuli,\nMdn \u00bc 9.50, was significantly higher than during the presentation of control stimuli,\nFurthermore, a difference in yawning behavior was observed between the two types\nof yawning stimuli (i.e., video vs. photo stimuli). A one-sample t test revealed that\nthe percentage of participants that yawned when watching the photo stimuli (40%)\nwas significantly higher than that of those who yawned when watching the video\nstimuli (12.5%), t \u00bc 2.78, p < .01. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test showed that the frequency\nof contagious yawning induced by yawning photo stimuli, Mdn \u00bc 9.11, was significantly higher\nthat this was due to the presentation strength (20 consecutive yawns without a time gap in the\nphoto stimuli and 10 yawns with a 20-s interval in between yawns). The sporadic nature of\nyawning in the video stimuli may have caused its decreased effectiveness in provoking\ncontagious yawning in participants. In addition, some yawning moments in the video were\ncovered by hands as this was a natural gesture, which might also contribute to possible\nreduction when compared with full view of yawning in photo condition.\nTable 1 presents a summary of autistic traits, eye-gazing patterns, and sensitivity to\nemotional expression.\nDetection Sensitivity Measurements\nTo derive the detection sensitivity of expression, we defined the threshold as the\nexpressive intensity level at which participants reported detection of an expression half of\nthe time (i.e., 50%). In other words, a higher intensity of expressiveness indicates a lower\nsensitivity. The psychometric curves for detecting yawning, happiness, and anger are shown\nin Figure 4.\nGender, Age, and Contagious Yawning\nA recent study reported a female advantage of susceptibility to contagious yawning (Norscia,\nDemuru, & Palagi, 2016a). Therefore, we examined if there were any gender differences\nbefore analyzing the relationship of AQ and contagious yawning. The Poisson regression\nindicated that there was a significant gender difference in yawning frequency, 2(1,\nsince Bartholomew and Cirulli (2014) found that age is the only variable that contributes\nto individual variation of yawning susceptibility, we also examined the relationship between\nTable 1.

However, the association between age and contagious yawning was\nnonsignificant (Appendix A).\nAutistic Traits and Contagious Yawning\nWe examined the association between autistic traits and contagious yawning using a Poisson\nParticipants were grouped into one of two categories based on their AQ score: Those\nwhose AQ score was higher than the median (i.e., 18) and those whose score was lower than\nthe median.

We separated participants into two groups\n(``more at eyes'' and ``less at eyes'') based on the eye-mouth fixation duration ratio median\n(1.55 in the video session, 1.32 in the photo session). We examined the relationship between\nthe eye-gaze tendency and autistic traits.

More specifically, people with higher perceptual\ndetection sensitivity to yawning are especially susceptible to contagious yawning. We did not\nfind that autistic tendencies in this nonclinical population were associated with contagious\nyawning. We found an unexpected gender effect: Females displayed more contagious\nyawning than males. In summary, gender and yawning detection sensitivity were the two\nvariables associated with individuals' susceptibility for contagious yawning.\nOur hypothesis that perceptual detection sensitivity to yawning expression contributes to\nthe susceptibility of contagious yawning was supported. Although the underlying mechanism\nremained unclear, sensitivity to yawning could be a possible precursor of contagious yawning\nand might be facilitated by gazing at the eye region of the inducer. This is in line with the view\nfrom the perceptual perspective that sensitivity to others' expressions (Provine, 1989) and\nproclivity to look at the eyes (Senju et al., 2009; Usui et al., 2013) play a role in determining\nthe individual's susceptibility to contagious yawning. These intriguing findings directed the\nstudy of contagious yawning from exploring a higher level of processing (e.g., empathy) to a\nlower level of processing (e.g., eye scanning patterns and perceptual detection sensitivity).\nOur findings add to the body of research showing that perceptual detection sensitivity\nto facial expression may alter one's social processing. For example, Kuusikko et al. (2009)\nused a computer-based emotional recognition test and asked participants with autism to\nselect the correct upper facial basic emotion for each picture. They found that autistic girls\nscored lower in recognizing happiness and anger than nonautistic girls. This implies a lower\nsensitivity to emotional expressions and that more cues may be required to detect an emotion.\nThis impedes their social processing and might lead to inappropriate responses in social\ninteractions. Past studies found that patients with depression also exhibit biased emotion\nperception in emotional recognition tasks, in which they demonstrated lower sensitivity than\ncontrols when asked to distinguish happy from neutral expression (Gur et al., 1992;\nMikhailova, Vladimirova, Iznak, Tsusulkovskaya, & Sushko, 1996; Surguladze et al.,\n2004). This reduced ability could have a significant impact on a person's social processing,\nwhich in turn could affect their own emotion experiences. While earlier research on\ncontagious yawning highlighted its social and empathetic components by showing that\npoorer social understanding (e.g., in autism, Senju et al., 2007; and schizophrenia, Platek\net al., 2003) depleted one's susceptibility to contagious yawning, here we offered another\npossible early perceptual origin. Hence, our finding implied that the later processing of the\nsocial information delivered by a yawn may be precluded by low sensitivity to yawning and\nresults in a lower susceptibility to contagious yawning.\nIn addition, our hypothesis that gaze to eye regions enhanced one's perceptual detection\nsensitivity to expressions including yawning was partly supported by the positive association\nbetween fixation duration to the eye region and perceptual detection sensitivity to yawning.\nThis finding is consistent with a study in which eye-gazing patterns of autistic and nonautistic\nchildren were recorded when they viewed morphing facial expressions of six different\nemotions and labeled the emotions (Bal et al., 2010). Results showed that looking more at\nthe eyes was associated with fewer errors in recognition of disgust and surprise and faster\nreaction times for recognizing fear but not other emotions. This suggested that attention to\nthe eye region increased sensitivity to emotion recognition, at least for fear, surprise, and\ndisgust. Our study extends this finding beyond emotion recognition to the recognition\nof yawning.\nOur study also reported a female advantage in susceptibility to contagious yawning,\nwhich could originate from several possible sources. First, a female advantage in yawning\nsusceptibility could come from a female bias in empathetic ability (for a review, see Christov-\nMoore et al., 2014), which is known to be related to contagious yawning (Helt et al., 2010;\nscore higher on self-reported empathy questionnaires than males (Rueckert & Naybar, 2008)\nand show stronger neural activation in empathy-related brain regions such as the amygdala\n(Schulte-Ru\n\u00a8 ther, Markowitsch, Shah, Fink, & Piefke, 2008). However, in our sample, autistic\ntendency measured by the AQ did not differ between the two genders. Second, females were\nreported to excel in emotion recognition tasks (Hall & Matsumoto, 2004; McClure, 2000;\nMontagne, Kessels, Frigerio, de Haan, & Perrett, 2005; Thompson & Voyer, 2014) and were\nidentified as being better at expressing their own emotions than men. Neuroimaging studies\nalso find that females, but not males, show increased activation of the right inferior frontal\ncortex, which is known for being involved in emotional contagion (Derntl et al., 2010). In our\nsampled population, our female participants had marginally significant higher sensitivity\nthan men in detecting happy faces (p \u00bc .063), but not in angry or yawning faces.\nTherefore, there was no direct evidence to connect this possibility to our finding. Finally,\nfemales are more sensitive to nonverbal cues in social communication than men\n2014). It is possible that females are more susceptible to contagious yawning than males\ndue to their higher abilities in understanding others' intention through nonverbal cues like\nyawning. We have no direct measurements to test this hypothesis, and this will be a direction\nfor future studies. Norscia and coworkers (2016a) observed the natural occurrence of\ncontagious yawning among 92 nonstranger dyads and found that female participants\nyawned more frequently than men in response to others' yawning. As the understanding\nof gender difference in the contagion effect is still at its infancy, future studies are warranted.\nThere are at least 15 negative reports on gender differences in contagious yawning, and it is\nworth noting the differences between them and our study. First, 3 of the 15 studies\n2013), a population known to have a low yawning frequency (Senju et al., 2007). This may\nlimit any detectable gender effect. Studies with nonclinical populations (e.g., the current\nstudy and Norscia et al., 2016a) might offer a bigger observable range. Moreover, a\nsexually immature group like children is not a good sample group for studying gender\ndifferences (Norscia, Demuru, & Palagi, 2016b). Second, 5 of the 15 studies did not\ninclude a baseline condition to control for spontaneous yawning (Bartholomew & Cirulli,\nEldakar, 2011; Massen, Dusc, Eldakar, & Gallup, 2014). A control condition (i.e., in our\ncase, a smiling video) or a baseline measurement (e.g., spontaneous yawning in Norscia et al.,\n2016a) offers an assurance that the recorded yawning was not predominantly spontaneous\nyawning, which is known to have no gender difference (Schino & Aureli, 1989), but\ncontagious yawning which was our central research interest. Lastly, contagious yawning\ncould be significantly diminished by social presence (Gallup et al., 2016), and females are\nmore sensitive to social etiquette (Baron-Cohen, O'Riordan, Jones, & Plaisted, 1999). It is\npossible that the initial female advantage to yawning susceptibility was counterbalanced by\nthe higher inhibition of yawning behavior in females. Participants in 4 of the 15 studies were\naware of experimenters' observation of their yawning behavior as they viewed the yawning\nphotos directly in front of the experimenter (Eldakar et al., 2015; Gallup & Eldakar, 2011;\nGallup & Gallup, 2007; Massen et al., 2014). This makes it possible that the gender difference\nwas absent due to the pressure to inhibit yawning behavior, especially in females, due to the\nsocial presence of the experimenters. To reduce participants' awareness of having their\nyawning behavior observed, our cover story disguised the real study purpose and a hidden\nwebcam was installed to record their yawning for later analysis. In summary, our control\nbaseline, cover story, and experimental design may offer a more suitable combination to\nobserve a female advantage in susceptibility to contagious yawning.\nWhile a previous study reported that age is the only variable contributing to individual\nsusceptibility to contagious yawning (Bartholomew & Cirulli, 2014), we did not find similar\nevidence for older individuals being less susceptible to yawning when they watched yawning\nvideo clips and still images. Our sample had a relatively narrow age range (i.e., 19\u00ad26 years\nold) compared with Bartholomew and Cirulli's study (i.e., 18\u00ad83 years old), hence, it may not\nbe large enough to reflect similar age effect.\nOur finding that participants with more autistic traits have a lower tendency to gaze at eyes\nadds to recent reports of an association between autistic traits and eye gazing in nonclinical\npopulations. Individuals with more autistic traits (assessed using the Broad Autism\nPhenotype Questionnaire) tended to look less at the faces of experimenters who asked\nparticipants questions (Vabalas & Freeth, 2016) and had shorter and less frequent\nsaccades on the face during a face-to-face interaction with the experimenters (Freeth,\nFoulsham, & Kingstone, 2013) compared with participants lower in autistic traits. In a\nrecognition task of artificial faces, Davis et al. (2017) discovered that those who had\nhigher AQ scores on the AQ-social subscale tended to look less at eye regions of the facial\nstimuli. Our results extend the findings to human face photos and videos and indicate that\nnonclinical individuals lower in autistic traits tend to gaze more at the eyes. This is\nsupplementary to the well-established report of individuals with autism looking less at the\nHowever, we did not find an association between eye-gaze patterns and contagious\nyawning. This is possibly because the face studying patterns among the nonclinical\npopulation were consistently concentrated on the key features. The aforementioned studies\nrevealed the connection with contagious yawning through comparisons between autistic\nand nonautistic children (Senju et al., 2009; Usui et al., 2013), which might cover a bigger\nrange of differences.\nThere are several possible directions for future studies. Despite our efforts in disguising the\nmain purpose of our study and minimizing participants' awareness of their own yawning,\nsome participants still reported that they suppressed their yawning due to social etiquette.\nThis could potentially affect subjects' yawning frequency in response to the yawning stimuli.\nWe included a question on the subjective urge to yawn as a supplementary tool for measuring\nyawning tendency. In addition, a more objective method, such as myography that measures\nmuscle activity, could be helpful to measure subjects' yawning tendency, including those that\nare suppressed and undetectable to observation. Moreover, it is worth noting that our\nyawning stimuli produced a flatter psychometric curve than happy and angry stimuli.\nAll stimuli selected to construct psychometric curves for the three expressions were based\non the same intensity rating method, so it is unclear what constituted this difference. While\nthe faces considered as the happiest or angriest in the rating task were always considered as\n``YES-presence'' in the detection ask, and the neutral faces are always considered as\n``NO-presence'' in the detection ask, such connection was less clear in yawning. One\npossibility is that participants have adopted a different criterion in the Yes-No detection\ntask for yawning from that for happy or angry faces, possibly due to the lack of\nexperience on yawning presence judgment. It is still an unsolved puzzle to us why this\noccurs, and it may be a possible direction for future study. Lastly, a more extensive\nscreening to exclude participants with clinical conditions and trait-like alexithymia\n(the lack of own emotion understanding) could be applied in future studies. Individuals\nwith psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia could have lower susceptibility\nto contagious yawning, and individuals with alexithymia (which could be measured with the\nToronto Alexithymia Scale, Bagby, Parker, & Taylor, 1994; Bird, Press, & Richardson, 2011)\nmay be limited to report accurately on their urge to yawn. Our postexperiment questionnaire\nshowed that our participants were not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorders, and it may\nbe desirable to employ a more extensive pretest screening to rule out factors that could affect\nsensitivity and susceptibility to yawning in future studies.\nConclusion\nOur study revealed that participants with higher yawning sensitivity (but not emotional\nsensitivity) are more susceptible to contagious yawning, which adds to the growing\nliterature that suggests perceptual deficits, such as atypical eye-gaze patterns, might\ncontribute to reduced behavioral contagion. In addition, females were found to display\nmore contagious yawning than males, and the underlying mechanism awaits elucidation\nby future studies. These findings have important theoretical implications for\nunderstanding the mechanism of contagious yawning for a nonautistic population. It\nwill be interesting to see whether similar associations exist in a clinical population such\nas people with autism.\nIn conclusion, our study offers a working hypothesis for future studies to investigate how\nthe perceptual encoding of yawning interacts with susceptibility to contagious yawning.\nAuthor Note\nAuthor Meingold H.M.
