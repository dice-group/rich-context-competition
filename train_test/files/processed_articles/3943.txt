He was one of the first to directly\nmeasure such properties in aesthetic stimuli. Nowadays, a large number of firmly\nestablished empirical methods are applied in this field. A particular focus has been on\nstatistical image properties (SIPs) that are relevant to visual perception in humans. For\nmany years, researchers have explored whether SIPs provide objective criteria to assess the\naesthetic quality of artworks and photographs. Their goal was (and is) to identify universal\nfeatures that are positively correlated with beauty and aesthetic experience. Until now, no\nsuch universals have been found. The main reason for this might be that experiences of\nbeauty are--at least partly--domain specific (Markovic\nthat the Golden Section--as proposed by Gustav Theodor Fechner--is universally perceived\nas beautiful across domains has been questioned and eventually rebutted (McManus, 1980;\nRussell, 2000). Over the past few years, more sophisticated analysis methods have been used\nto search for properties related to beauty in a specific domain, namely visual art (Graham &\nRedies, 2010; Hoenig, 2005). In the field of computational aesthetics, computer-assisted\nalgorithms were used to extract statistical features that characterize aesthetic images\n(Amirshahi, Koch, Denzler, & Redies, 2012; Datta, Joshi, Li, & Wang, 2006; Graham &\nField, 2007; Redies, Hasenstein, & Denzler, 2007). This approach has also been employed to\npredict emotional responses to paintings (Yanulevskaya et al., 2012) and to categorize\npainting styles (Wallraven et al., 2009).\nLarge subsets of Western and East Asian visual artworks share the property of a nearly\nscale-invariant (fractal-like) Fourier spectrum (Alvarez-Ramirez, Ibarra-Valdez, Rodriguez,\nGeisler, 2008; Ruderman & Bialek, 1994). This finding led to the hypothesis that many artists\napply natural scene statistics when they create artworks (Graham & Redies, 2010; Redies,\n2007). Another computational method for analyzing artworks is based on the analysis of\nhistograms of oriented luminance gradients (HOGs; Bosch, Zisserman, & Munoz, 2008). This\nmethod allows calculating image properties such as self-similarity, complexity, and\nanisotropy (Amirshahi et al., 2012; Redies, Amirshahi, Koch, & Denzler, 2012). Results\nindicate that images of artworks exhibited in museums and images of natural scenes are\nhighly self-similar, that is, subparts of the images have HOGs similar to the entire image\n(Amirshahi et al., 2012; Amirshahi, Redies, & Denzler, 2013). In other words, artworks\npossess a relatively high degree of self-similarity in comparison to other image categories\n(Braun, Amirshahi, Denzler, & Redies, 2014). In addition, large subsets of visual artworks\nhave complexity values in an intermediate range (Braun et al., 2014). This finding is in line\nwith the proposition by Berlyne (1974) that an intermediate level of complexity is associated\nwith higher aesthetic appeal than low or high complexity on average, as experimentally\nconfirmed by several studies (Forsythe, Nadal, Sheehy, Cela-Conde, & Sawey, 2011;\nNadal, 2007). Furthermore, colored artworks are, in general, highly isotropic, that is, they\ncontain luminance gradients of similar strength across all orientations (Braun et al., 2014;\nKoch, Denzler, & Redies, 2010; Melmer, Amirshahi, Koch, Denzler, & Redies, 2013). In our\nstudy, we measured the following SIPs: PHOG (Pyramid of HOGs) Self-Similarity, HOG\nComplexity, HOG Anisotropy, Aspect Ratio, Rule of Thirds, and various color measures.\nFor an exact definition of these measures, see the Methods section. To measure these\nproperties in images of artworks, we used the JenAesthetics database, which was\n2 i-Perception\nintroduced by Amirshahi, Denzler, et al. (2013). The data set consists of over 1,600 high-\nquality images of oil paintings of Western provenance. We used this type of artworks because\nit has been very popular over several centuries and thereby offers the opportunity to compare\ndifferent art periods. For the rating experiment, we excluded more recent oil paintings (i.e.,\npaintings with a year of origin later than 1935) and thereby eliminated paintings that are not\nintended to be visually pleasing. Furthermore, a previous study showed that representational\npaintings can be associated with more positive judgments on the dimensions of form,\ncomplexity, and regularity, as compared with abstract paintings (Markovic\nA major concern regarding the analysis of the SIPs in this database was the age of some of\nthe paintings, which can result in conservation artifacts, for example, a brownish film of\nvarnish that may partially obscure color and luminance detail in the paintings (Bonaduce\net al., 2012). We analyzed paintings in their present condition, in which museums made them\navailable to the Google Art Project.\nThe subjective rating scores of the paintings have been obtained and analyzed in a\nprevious study (Amirshahi, Hayn-Leichsenring, Denzler, & Redies, 2014a). Each image in\nthis database was subjectively rated according to its aesthetics and its beauty. Aesthetics\nreflected the (``more objective'') artistic value of the respective image while beauty stands\nfor the ``subjective'' liking by the individual participant. Given that there is some uncertainty\nwith regard to the terminology (Augustin, Carbon, & Wagemans, 2012; Augustin,\nWagemans, & Carbon, 2012), the terms were explicitly defined for the participants of the\nexperiment (see section ``Gaining of Subjective Rating Scores''). Hedonic value is used in the\nmanuscript as a superordinate term for aesthetics and beauty. The present work extends the\nstudy by Amirshahi et al. (2014a) (a) by performing a deeper analysis of the subjective rating\nscores, (b) by analyzing the SIPs of the paintings, and (c) by investigating the relation\nbetween SIPs and the rating scores of the paintings.\nBesides the search for universal aesthetic features, another interesting research topic is the\nidentification of statistical properties that are characteristic for particular art periods.\nMarchenko, Tat-Seng, and Irina (2005) used computer algorithms based on the\nmeasurement of color temperature (warm or cold), color palette (primary or\ncomplimentary), and color contrasts (light or dark) to distinguish modern art from medieval\nart. Therefore, low-level statistics can provide informative cues about art periods. In the\nso-called ontology-based disambiguation method, Leslie, Chua, and Ramesh (2007) combined\nanalyses of color measures and brush strokes with semantic high-level concepts to distinguish\nart periods; they achieved a higher performance than with the approach by Marchenko et al.\nThe influence of higher level in categorization strategies has also been demonstrated by\nWallraven et al. (2009). Hence, we did not only focus on the investigation of possible\nuniversal features of art images but expanded our effort toward an investigation of the\nusefulness of SIPs for allowing to differentiate art periods and subject matters.\nIn previous studies, rating scores on art paintings have been linked to interindividual\ndifferences between participants, such as personality traits (Furnham & Walker, 2001;\nLyssenko, Redies, & Hayn-Leichsenring, 2016), expertise (Aluja, Garcia, & Garcia, 2004;\nLeder, Ring, & Dressler, 2013), demographic variables (Furnham & Walker, 2001) and other\npersonal characteristics. For example, Mallon, Redies and Hayn-Leichsenring (2014) found\nthat preferences differed between subgroups of participants depending on the SIPs of abstract\npaintings. Although the clustering of the participants was performed exclusively based on\nsubjective evaluations, 46% of the clustering's outcome was predicted by SIPs of the\nevaluated paintings. Gu\n\u00a8 clu\n\u00a8 tu\n\u00a8 rk, Jacobs, and van Lier (2016) described that two clusters of\nparticipants differed in their liking of complexity in digital images. One group of participants\nshowed increasingly lower liking rates for increasingly more complex images while another\nHayn-Leichsenring et al. 3\ngroup showed the opposite pattern of preference. Bies, Blanc-Goldhammer, Boydston,\nTaylor, and Sereno (2016) found different preferences for clusters of participants who\nrated fractal patterns. These preferences correlated with specific patterns of fractal\ndimension, symmetry, and recursion in the stimuli. Together, these results indicate that\ndifferent groups of people have different preferences for specific SIPs. Here, we\ninvestigated whether clusters of participants preferred certain SIPs over others in the\nimages of the JenAesthetics database.\nIn summary, we provide a detailed statistical analysis of the subjective evaluations of the\nJenAesthetics database. Specifically, we connected the subjective rating scores with the SIPs.\nIn addition, we reanalyzed the data set for individual art periods and subject matters to find\nout whether specific subsets of the JenAesthetics database differ in their SIPs or in the\ncorrelation between rating scores and the SIPs.\nMethods\nData Set\nWe used the JenAesthetics data set (Amirshahi et al., 2012). This data set consists of 1,628\nimages of colored oil-paintings of Western provenance painted by over 400 artists. For\ntechnical reasons, we used 1,614 of the images only. The JenAesthetics data set is a subset\nof the Google Art Project database and therefore royalty free. All images were of high\nresolution (image size generally more than 3 MB; e.g., see Figure 1 images).\nCategorization of Paintings\nAs described in a technical report (Amirshahi et al., 2012), each image of the JenAesthetics\ndatabase was categorized according to the art period and its subject matter. The\ncategorization of the art periods followed standard textbooks on art and information\navailable on the Wikipedia website. The data set contains works from 11 major art periods\n(Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque, Rococo, Classicism, Romanticism, Realism,\nImpressionism, Symbolism, Post-Impressionism, and Expressionism). The categorization of\nsubject matter of each painting is based on a subjective classification by two independent\nobservers. Subject matters are abstract, nearly abstract, landscapes, scenes with person(s), still\nlife, flowers or vegetation, animals, seascape, port or coast, sky, portrait (one person), portrait\n(many persons), nudes, urban scenes, buildings, interior scenes, and other subject matters. Up\nto three subject matters were assigned to one particular painting. However, in our analysis,\nwe used only the first (predominant) subject matter of each painting.\nGaining of Subjective Rating Scores\nIn the present study, we used the rating scores for the JenAesthetics database, which were\nobtained in a previous study (Amirshahi et al., 2014a). In this study, participants rated the\npaintings on aesthetic value, beauty, liking of color, liking of content, liking of composition,\nfamiliarity with the artist, and familiarity with the painting. Before the experiment,\nparticipants were instructed that ratings on aesthetics should reflect the (``more objective'')\nartistic value of the respective image while beauty rating scores should reflect the ``subjective''\nliking. In brief, the 1,614 paintings were rated in blocks of 163 randomly chosen images.\nEvery painting was rated by 19 to 20 participants (131 participants in total). The rating\nexperiment was performed with images that were reduced to a size of 800 pixels on the\n4 i-Perception\nlongest side (maximum size of 205 mm on the screen). Images were presented on a black\nscreen (BenQ T221W widescreen monitor) that had been color calibrated using a colorimeter\n(X-Rite EODIS3 i1Display Pro). For a more detailed description of the experimental\nprocedure, see Amirshahi et al. (2014a).\nStatistical Image Properties\nFor every painting, we calculated the following statistical properties using MATLAB 2008A:\n(1) PHOG Self-Similarity. Self-similarity implies that an object as a whole has a structure\nsimilar to its parts. In the present study, we calculated Self-Similarity using the PHOG\nmethod, as originally introduced by Bosch et al. (2008). In brief, the method follows a\npyramid approach (Amirshahi et al., 2012): In a first step, the HOG feature (Dalal et al.,\n2005) for the entire image is calculated at the ground level (Level 0). The HOG feature\nrepresents the mean strength of the luminance gradients binned in 16 equally sized\norientations that cover all orientations in the image. Second, the image was divided\ninto four rectangles of the same size (Level 1), and the HOG features were calculated\nfor each subimage. Then, each of the four rectangles was again divided into equal\nrectangles (Level 2), and the HOG features were calculated for the resulting 16\nFigure 1. Example images from the JenAesthetics data set used in the subjective rating experiments. Upper\nrow (from left to right): Jean-Baptiste-Sime\n\u00b4on Chardin (1753), title: The Good Education, art period: Rococo,\ncategory: ``scenes with persons''; Francis Danby (1830), The Mountain Torrent, Romanticism, ``landscapes'';\nPeter Paul Rubens (1606), Portrait of Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria, Baroque, ``portrait (one person)'';\nLower row: Odilon Redon (1903), Flower Clouds, Symbolism, ``seascape, port or coast''; Maerten Boelema\nDe Stomme (1641), Still-Life with Nautilus Cup, Baroque, ``still life''; Theodore Clement Steele (1893), The\nBloom of the Grape, Impressionism, ``landscapes.'' All images are in the public domain.\nHayn-Leichsenring et al. 5\nsubimages as well. We took this approach up to Level 3. Then, we compared the HOG\nfeatures of the entire image on Level 0 with the HOG features of the rectangles on the\nthird level using the Histogram Intersection Kernel (Barla et al., 2002). A detailed\ndescription of the method (Amirshahi et al., 2012) can be found in the Appendix to\nBraun et al. (2014). This measure ranges from 0 (no self-similarity) to 1 (maximal self-\nsimilarity).\n(2) HOG Complexity. Several recent studies confirmed the importance of complexity in\nRigau, Feixas, & Sbert, 2008). Here, we defined Complexity as the total strength of all\noriented gradients in a painting (Redies et al., 2012).\n(3) HOG Anisotropy. Anisotropy is a measure for the heterogeneity (variance) of luminance\ngradients across orientations in a particular image. High values indicate that some\norientations of gradients are represented more strongly than others in the HOGs,\nwhile low values imply that the luminance gradients are uniformly distributed across\nall orientations (Redies et al., 2012). Schweinhart and Essock (2013) showed that art\npaintings of different subject matters (e.g., landscapes and faces) tend to be less\nanisotropic even though, in real-world photographs, the pattern of anisotropy differs\nconsiderably between landscapes and faces. Possibly, artists over regularize the\nstructure in their paintings by imposing the natural-scene horizontal effect in other\ntypes of subject matter.\n(4) Aspect Ratio. Although there is no evidence for an overall hedonic preference of a certain\nformat of paintings (McManus, 1980; Russell, 2000), the aspect ratio has been linked\npreviously to the aesthetic preference of paintings depicting specific subject matters, for\nexample, landscapes or portraits (Palmer, Schloss, & Sammartino, 2013). Therefore, we\nincluded this measure because it might be related to preferences for images from specific\nart periods or of specific subject matters.\n(5) Rule of Thirds. We measured the degree, to which images structure followed the Rule of\nThirds (see Amirshahi, Hayn-Leichsenring, Denzler, & Redies, 2014b). The Rule of\nThirds implies that the focus point of a painting should be placed along one of the\nthird lines to yield aesthetically pleasing results. In the present study, the focus point\nwas determined based on the graph-based visual saliency method, as described by Mai,\n(6) Color measures. In addition, we calculated the three color measures of the HSV color\nspace (color hue, color saturation, and color value), which have been regularly used in\naesthetic quality assessment (e.g., see Datta et al., 2006; Palmer et al., 2013). All color\nmeasures range from 0 to 1. Color hue ranges from red (value \u00bc 0), yellow, green, cyan,\nblue, to magenta (value \u00bc 1). For color saturation, higher values stand for higher\nsaturated images and for color hue, higher values stand for brighter images.\nClustering of the Paintings and Participants\nWe divided the paintings with the k-means clustering method according to their mean\nsubjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty. Clustering allowed allocation of paintings\ninto three subgroups that resembled each other according to correlation patterns. This number\nof clusters was judged to be close to optimal based on the elbow criterion, a computational\nfeature in plots of the sum of squared errors. We used the same method (but based on\ncorrelations of subjective ratings with SIPs) for the clustering of the participants.\n6 i-Perception\nResults\nAnalysis of SIPs\nCorrelation between SIPs. The measured SIPs correlate with each other (see Supplementary\nTable 1 for a detailed analysis of correlations of SIPs within the JenAesthetics database).\nFor example, there is a high correlation between Self-Similarity and Anisotropy (r \u00bc \u00c0483,\np < .001). Bearing this in mind, we performed detailed statistical analyses on SIPs over\npaintings and over participants.\nAnalysis Over Paintings\nCorrelation of SIPs with year of origin. First, we investigated whether the SIPs of the paintings\nchanged over the years. Therefore, we correlated the year of origin of the paintings with the\nSIPs. We found significant correlations for most of the SIPs, namely for Self-Similarity\nstatistics changed over time. More recent oil paintings are more self-similar and more\ncomplex. Also, they possess a higher degree of Anisotropy and show different colors.\nSIPs in paintings from different art periods. We then analyzed whether paintings from the various\nart periods differed in their SIPs.\nThe results were entered into a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) considering art\nperiod as between-subject factor. Results revealed a significant effect of all measured SIPs:\np < .001. Therefore, all measured SIPs showed differences over the art periods analyzed\n(see Supplementary Table 2 for descriptive statistics and Supplementary Table 3 for results\nof a multivariable linear regression analysis that studied the interaction between the SIPs in\none model and their affiliation to a specific art period and Supplementary Figure 1 for a plot\nof the LOESS curve fittings for aesthetics and beauty). In addition, we performed a\nmultinomial multivariable regression analysis for art period with all SIPs. Results showed\nthat all SIPs are significant predictors of the art period affiliation. For example, an increase of\nsaturation of 0.1 increases the probability of belonging to the art period Renaissance by\n79.8% as compared with the reference art period Impressionism (see Table 1 for complete\nresults).\nSIPs in paintings with different subject matters over art periods. Next, we compared the SIPs of\nlandscape and portrait paintings between different art periods. We used landscape and\nportrait paintings because these subject matters were the most numerous within the\nJenAesthetics database and, additionally, they were also common to all art periods.\nThe results were entered into a one-way ANOVA considering art period as between-\nsubject factor. For portrait paintings, results revealed a significant effect of Complexity,\nHayn-Leichsenring et al. 7\nTable 1. Odds Ratios From a Multinomial Multivariable Regression Analysis for Art Period With SIPs With `Impressionism' as the Reference for Art Period.\nDisplayed Are the Odds Ratios Per Change of 0.1 in Values of the Respective SIP.\nRenaissance Mannerism Baroque Rococo Classicism Romanticism Realism Symbolism Post-Impressionism Expressionism\n8 i-Perception\nTherefore, only Self-Similarity did not differ significantly in portrait paintings over the art\nperiods.\nFor landscape paintings, results revealed a significant effect of Self-Similarity, F(9, 168) \u00bc\nbetween art periods.\nIn conclusion, all SIPs show changes throughout the art periods, except for Self-Similarity,\nwhich does not change in portrait paintings, and Anisotropy and Aspect Ratio, which are\nunaltered in landscape paintings (see Supplementary Table 4 for the descriptive statistics on\nlandscape paintings and portrait paintings for every art period). To detect the influence of\nSIPs and subject matter (independent variables) including their interaction on aesthetics\n(dependent variable), a multivariable linear regression model was fitted (see Supplementary\nTable 5 for results and Supplementary Table 6 for descriptive statistics on all subject\nmatters).\nSubjective rating scores and year of origin of the paintings. The year of origin of the paintings\nInterestingly, evaluation on aesthetics showed no correlation (r \u00bc \u00c0.011, p \u00bc .673). We\nperformed a Fisher transform to investigate whether differences of correlations between\naesthetics or year of origin and beauty or year of origin were significant. To this aim,\nwe converted Pearson's r to Fisher's z and computed the confidence interval at 99%.\nResults showed a significant difference of the correlations. This is particularly striking\nbecause subjective evaluation on beauty and aesthetics (see Introduction for definition of\nthe terms) are highly correlated (r \u00bc .772, p < .001). Therefore, participants personally\npreferred newer paintings while the ascribed (``objective'') artistic value remained stable\nover time.\nGeneral analysis of subjective rating scores in different art periods. Next, we investigated general\ndifferences of subjective rating scores between the art periods. Although each art period is\nobviously related to the year of origin, participants might be less familiar with certain art\nperiods than with others and, therefore, they might systematically prefer paintings from\nparticular art periods, irrespective of their year of origin. The subjective rating scores were\nentered into a one-way ANOVA considering art period as between-subject factor. Results\neffect of the year of origin on aesthetics, there are still differences in appreciation for the\ndifferent art periods (see Figure 2 for mean scores for the respective art periods).\nSubjective rating scores and SIPs. We investigated the relation between subjective rating scores\nand the SIPs. To this aim, two stepwise (backward elimination) multiple linear regression\nanalyses were run. The subjective rating scores (aesthetics or beauty) were the dependent\nvariables while standardized (z-transformed) values for SIPs were considered independent\nvariables. Results were controlled with the post hoc Holm\u00adBonferroni method. Four of the\nHayn-Leichsenring et al. 9\np < .05). The subjective ratings on beauty can be predicted in a similar way,\nIn addition, in a correlation analysis after Fisher's z transformation, we found that\ncorrelations with Aspect Ratio and Color Value only were significantly different for the\nhedonic ratings. Therefore, aesthetics and beauty ratings showed an overall similar pattern\nof correlations with the SIPs.\nSubjective rating scores on preferences for color, composition, and content correlated with\nseveral SIPs (see Table 2 for details).\nSubjective rating scores and SIPs in paintings from different art periods. Next, we investigated\ncorrelations between subjective rating scores and the SIPs for different art periods. Here,\nwe focused on the subjective rating scores for aesthetics and beauty and investigated only art\nperiods with more than 30 paintings in the database (see Table 3). Interestingly, the number\nof correlations of subjective rating scores differed between art periods. There were no\ncorrelations with the SIPs for Mannerism, Classicism, Romanticism, Symbolism, and\nExpressionism, and few correlations for Renaissance, Realism, Impressionism, Post-\nImpressionism, and Expressionism. In contrast, Baroque and Rococo showed correlations\nof subjective rating scores with several SIPs.\nThese results provide evidence that the evaluation of artworks from certain art periods\n(Baroque, Rococo) by our observers is correlated with particular SIP patterns, while this is\nnot the case for artworks from other art periods (Mannerism, Classicism, Romanticism,\nSymbolism, and Expressionism).\nFigure 2. Mean scores for the subjective evaluation on aesthetics and beauty for images from different art\nperiods. Whiskers indicate standard errors of the mean.\nSubjective rating scores and SIPs in paintings with different subject matters. We investigated\ncorrelations between subjective rating scores and the SIPs for different subject matters that\ncomprised more than 30 paintings. Again, we focused on subjective rating scores for\naesthetics and beauty. In paintings of landscapes, flowers or vegetation, seascapes, and\nportraits with many persons, there were no correlations of subjective rating scores with the\nSIPs, while paintings with other subject matters showed at least some correlations.\nParticularly, the hedonic evaluation of paintings of buildings seems to be connected with\nSIPs (especially with Self-Similarity, Color Saturation, and Color Value; see Table 4 for\nTable 3.

We conclude that hedonic ratings correlate with SIPs for artworks of certain\nsubject matters only.\nClustering based on subjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty. To gain insight into the\nevaluations on artistic value (aesthetics) and subjective liking (beauty) and their relation to\nSIPs, we clustered the paintings (for a description of the method, see Methods section). We\ncalculated the standard deviation of the mean values of each image from the mean of each\ncluster for two to six clusters. An elbow criterion provided evidence that three is the optimal\nnumber of clusters. The clusters consisted of 750, 481, and 383 paintings, respectively. While\nCluster 1 (aesthetics: M \u00bc .56, beauty: M \u00bc .50) and Cluster 3 (aesthetics: M \u00bc .44, beauty:\nM \u00bc .37) had significantly higher ratings on aesthetics than on beauty, Cluster 2 (aesthetics:\nM \u00bc .67, beauty: M \u00bc .66) consisted of paintings that had a similar mean value of ratings on\naesthetics and beauty. Next, we asked whether the three clusters had different mean values of\nSIPs (see Table 5 for results). We found significant differences of mean values between\nTable 4.

Results were\ncontrolled with the post hoc Holm\u00adBonferroni method. Four of the SIPs predicted the\nconclude that differences in evaluation on aesthetics and beauty--or the ascribed artistic\nvalue and the subjective liking--might depend on SIPs.\nAfter clustering, 29.8% of the paintings were assigned to Cluster 2. However, when\nanalyzed over art periods, we found that the percentage of paintings assigned to Cluster 2\ndiffered. For Renaissance (C2 \u00bc 7.2%), Mannerism (C2 \u00bc 5.5%), and Expressionism\n(C2 \u00bc 3.1%), there were only few paintings in Cluster 2, while for Romanticism\npaintings. Therefore, the artistic value and subjective liking that participants ascribed to\nromantic and impressionist paintings were similar. Participants ascribed artistic value to\npaintings from Renaissance, Mannerism, and Expressionism although they did not like\nthese paintings subjectively to the same degree (see Figure 3(a) for detailed results).\nAnalyzed over subject matters, Cluster 2 contained only a few paintings from the\nportraits with one person (C2 \u00bc 18.9%), while paintings in the categories of landscapes\n(C2 \u00bc 52.7%) were more numerous. In summary, especially in paintings of wide scenes, the\nsubjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty were similar (see Figure 3(b) for detailed\nresults).\nAnalysis Over Participants\nGeneral analysis. For the analysis over participants, we focused solely on the subjective rating\nscores on beauty (reflecting the individual liking of the images), because we were interested in\nthe participants' personal taste and not in what they considered to be generally aesthetic.\nOverall, the mean of the subjective rating scores on beauty was M \u00bc .416 (SD \u00bc .338). Not\nsurprisingly, participants that reported interest in arts gave higher ratings than participants\nthat did not report interest in arts (interested: M \u00bc .431, SD \u00bc .081; noninterested: M \u00bc .386,\nTable 5.

We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient for subjective rating scores\non beauty with SIPs of the rated paintings for every single participant (see Supplementary\nTable 7 for a complete analysis).\nAs the correlations were heterogeneous among the participants, that is, groups of\nparticipants showed a particular pattern of correlations with certain SIPs, we divided the\nFigure 3. Analysis of image clustering. Displayed are the percentage number of paintings assigned to the\nthree clusters for (a) art periods and (b) subject matters. Clustering of the images was based on their mean\nsubjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty. Cluster 1 consisted of 750 images (46.5% of all images),\nparticipants with the k-means clustering method according to their respective correlation\npattern. For the clustering, we calculated the standard deviation of the mean values of\neach participant from the mean of each cluster for two to seven clusters. Then, we\ncalculated the sum of squares for two to seven clusters (SS2\n\u00bc .039). The elbow criterion provided evidence that a number of\nthree clusters is optimal. These three clusters consisted of 29, 37, and 65 participants,\nrespectively.\nTo further justify our clustering, we calculated the mean correlations of subjective rating\nscores on beauty with SIPs for each cluster. Participants in two of three clusters (Clusters 1\nand 2) showed a strong relation between subjective rating scores and SIPs, while SIPs had\nonly a small effect on subjective rating scores of participants in Cluster 3 (see Figure 4 for\nresults).\nThe results were entered into a one-way ANOVA considering cluster affiliation as\nbetween-subject factor. Results revealed a significant effect of Self-Similarity, F(2, 128) \u00bc\nTukey HSD test indicated a significant difference between individual clusters for mean\nvalues of each SIP analyzed.\nDiscussion\nStatistical Image Properties\nOne of the central questions in experimental aesthetics is whether there is a ``universal\nbeauty'' in artworks, natural scenes, and faces. In recent years, this question has been\nstudied by novel computational methods that allow measuring specific image properties. In\nthis context, the comparison between aesthetic and ordinary (nonaesthetic) images is of\nparticular interest. For example, Braun et al. (2014) investigated SIPs in different\nFigure 4. Analysis of participant clustering. Mean correlations (Pearson's r) of subjective rating scores\non beauty with SIPs for each cluster. Clustering of participants was based on the correlation of beauty ratings\nwith SIPs.\nHayn-Leichsenring et al. 15\ncategories of images. They showed that artworks, as a category of images that are created to\nbe aesthetic, exhibit a relatively high degree of Self-Similarity, a low degree of Anisotropy,\nand an intermediate degree of Complexity. In these statistical measures, art paintings differ\nfrom other image categories like photographs of natural scenes, urban scenes, faces, and\nsimple objects, as well as advertisements, on average. Here, we investigated the SIPs of oil\npaintings. We asked whether SIPs differed between art periods and between depicted subject\nmatters in this set of paintings. Therefore, we investigated these subgroups of paintings\nseparately. Our results show that, for each SIP, there are significant differences between\nart periods (see SIPs in paintings from different art periods section). Therefore, we did not\nobtain evidence that some SIPs are stable over all art periods investigated. However, in a\nmore detailed analysis, we found that Anisotropy did not differ significantly over landscape\npaintings while it differs between art periods in portrait paintings. Conceivably, Anisotropy is\nuniformly high in landscape paintings because horizontal orientations (e.g., horizon) and\nvertical orientations (e.g., trees) predominate in real-natural scenes. The opposite pattern\nwas observed for PHOG Self-Similarity, which differed in landscape paintings over art\nperiods but did not differ over portrait paintings (see SIPs in paintings with different\nsubject matters over art periods section). Our results are similar to findings by Redies\net al. (2007) who showed that the Fourier slopes of grayscale art portraits did\nnot resemble those of face photographs but of natural scenes. They concluded that\nartists portray faces not by mere copying of their real-world counterparts but by using\nspecific divergent image statistics. In the present study, we provide another example for\nthe usage of particular image properties (i.e., PHOG Self-Similarity) in artistic renderings\nof faces.\nFourier slope and Self-Similarity are correlated in artworks (Braun et al., 2014). Not only\ndo artists portray faces with statistics divergent from real-world faces, but they also\nuse relatively stable statistics to do so. Overall, our results provide evidence that artists\nfrom all art periods endow oil paintings of particular subject matters with similar image\nproperties.\nSubjective Rating Scores\nThe terminology that relates to aesthetic experience has been widely discussed in aesthetics\nresearch (Augustin, Carbon, et al., 2012; Augustin, Wagemans, et al., 2012). Here, we\ndistinguish between aesthetics and beauty ratings. Participants were instructed that ratings\non aesthetics should reflect the (``more objective'') artistic value of the respective image while\nbeauty rating scores should reflect the subjective liking (see Introduction and Gaining of\nSubjective Rating Scores sections). Rating scores differed between art periods, with\nclassicist paintings evaluated as most aesthetic and impressionist paintings evaluated as\nmost beautiful (see Figure 2). Overall, participants subjectively preferred more recent\npaintings while their rating of ascribed artistic value (i.e., aesthetics) was relatively stable\nover the centuries (see Subjective rating scores and year of origins of the paintings section).\nConsequently, we propose that, on the one hand, contemporary observers prefer more recent\noil paintings, possibly because they are more familiar with them. On the other hand, the\nobservers appreciated the artistic expertise of painters in the different periods to the same\ndegree. This is in line with the notion that the skills of artists are more or less stable on\naverage over the centuries. Unlike artistic skills, the taste of individual observers changes over\ntime and, therefore, contemporary participants prefer more modern paintings in general. This\npreference might be based on a mere exposure effect for more recent paintings or,\nalternatively, on a shared preference for similar semantic content. Previously, it had been\nshown that visual preferences can be based on the semantic content of stimuli and shared\nsemantic interpretations can lead to shared preferences (Vessel & Rubin, 2010).\nInterestingly, ratings on aesthetics and beauty were quite similar for impressionist\npaintings. Therefore, impressionist paintings are valued artistically (objectively) to the same\ndegree as subjectively. Again, this result may be explained by the greater familiarity of the\nobservers with impressionist paintings in comparison to paintings from other art periods.\nFocusing on the subject matter, ratings on aesthetics and beauty were similar in paintings\nof large-vista scenes (like landscapes, seascapes, urban scenes, and buildings). Interestingly,\nfor some subject matters, aesthetics scores were higher than subjective liking (beauty) scores,\nespecially for portrait and animal paintings. This difference might be explained by the content\nof the images. For example, in portrait paintings, participants might appreciate their artistic\nvalue, but they do not like the image subjectively, possibly because the liking or disliking of\nthe displayed person might have an effect on this rating. Last but not least, no subset of\nimages was rated as highly beautiful but not as aesthetic.\nSubjective Rating Scores and SIPs\nIt has been shown that specific SIPs are related to the hedonic value of abstract art paintings\n(Mallon et al., 2014). In the present, more detailed study, we show that rating scores on\nartistic value correspond to a slightly greater extent with SIPs than rating scores on subjective\nliking (see Table 1). It is not surprising that the more objective ratings on aesthetics correlate\nstronger with objective image properties, such as specific SIPs.\nIn addition, we clustered paintings according to their ratings on aesthetics and beauty. We\nfound that differences in rating scores correlated with specific SIPs, especially with\nAnisotropy, Rule of Thirds, Color Saturation, and Color Value (see Clustering based on\nsubjective rating scores on aesthetics and beauty section). This result points to an interaction\nbetween objective properties (SIPs) and the subjective evaluation of the images. However,\nthese differences might also be explained by other factors (e.g., preference for specific\ncontents or styles that coincide with certain SIPs in the paintings). In addition, this finding\ndoes not hold for all art periods because hedonic evaluation is not correlated with SIPs for\nMannerism, Romanticism, and Symbolism. Hence, the subjective liking of paintings from\nthese periods must be driven by other factors.\nWe observed similar differences for subject matters (see Table 3). Here, we found that\nratings of each subject matter correlated--at least weakly--with specific SIPs. Especially the\nrating of buildings showed relatively high correlations with Self-Similarity, Color Saturation,\nand Color Value.\nAnalysis Over Participants\nIn addition to our analysis of paintings, we also searched for similarities in the evaluations by\nthe participants. In previous research, rating scores on art have been linked to expertise\n(Leder et al., 2013), personality traits (Lyssenko et al., 2016), and other characteristics of\nparticipants. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that individuals exhibit stable patterns\nof preference for fractal-like characteristics across different image types (Spehar, Walker, &\nTaylor, 2016). In the present study, we focused on preferences for SIPs in groups of\nparticipants. We analyzed three clusters of participants. Affiliation to a certain cluster\nreflects a specific rating pattern that correlates, in turn, with preferences for images with\nspecific SIPs. Two of the clusters showed multiple correlations of rating scores on beauty with\nparticular SIPs (Figure 4). In Clusters 1 and 2, Self-Similarity, Complexity, Anisotropy,\nHayn-Leichsenring et al. 17\nColor Saturation, and Color Value of the painting had an effect on the subjective preference,\nwhile in Cluster 3, the SIPs were not correlated with preferences (see Clustering over SIPs\nsection). Hence, about two thirds of the participants were (perhaps unconsciously) sensitive\nto image statistics. A possible reason for this finding is that paintings of similar content or art\nstyle have similar image statistics. Therefore, a coherent taste may coincide with a preference\nfor similar image statistics. Notably, the third group of participants showed only very few\ncorrelations of subjective ratings with SIPs. Perhaps, these participants possessed a rather\nincoherent taste or, possibly, a taste for different image features or statistical properties that\nhave not been measured in the present study. Alternatively, their preference for paintings\nmight be driven more by cognitive than by sensory factors, that is, these participants possibly\nfocus more on image content than on artistic composition. It will be of interest to study the\ndifferences between such groups of participants in future research in more detail.\nLimitations\nIn the presented study, we used images of oil paintings as stimuli and, therefore, we did not\nshow real (original) artworks but representations of artworks. This difference may have an\neffect on the hedonic ratings (Brieber, Leder, & Nadal, 2015). Furthermore, the JenAesthetics\ndatabase consists of a preselected group of high-quality oil paintings. Hence, the database\nincludes a large proportion of images of rather similar quality. Any differences in aesthetic\nratings of these images may be relatively small, and therefore the aesthetic ratings may be\nrather stable across art styles and content matter. In addition, the analysis of ratings on\naesthetics and beauty strongly depends from a proper understanding of these terms by the\nparticipants. If participants understood the terms wrongly, the conclusions drawn would be\nimpaired.\nConclusion\nThe analysis did not reveal evidence for universal image properties that are systematically\nlinked to a higher aesthetic value in our sample of high-quality paintings. Instead, paintings\nfrom every art period show specific patterns of SIPs. As an exception, art portraits possess\nsimilar values of Self-Similarity over art periods. In an analysis of subjective rating scores, we\nfound differences of ratings on artistic value (aesthetics) and individual liking (beauty). These\ndifferences in ratings were linked to SIPs, to the art period and to the time of origin of the\npaintings. Last but not least, we showed that groups of participants varied systematically in\ntheir hedonic preferences.\nIn summary, our study provides evidence that, to some extent, SIPs vary between art\nperiods and subject matters and, in addition, they can be correlated with the subjective\nevaluation of paintings in a majority of the participants.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAluja, A., Garcia, O., & Garcia, L.
