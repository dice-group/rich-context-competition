    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: This study was performed to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of a\nrevascularization procedure in immature teeth with apical periodontitis using platelet-rich plasma\n(PRP). The PRP protocol and conventional revascularization protocol, which used a blood clot as\nthe scaffold, were compared.\nMethods: Thirty non-vital immature permanent teeth were randomly categorized into two\ngroups. After disinfecting the root canal space with triple antibiotic paste (1:1:1 ciprofloxacin,\nmetronidazole, and cefaclor), a tissue scaffold was created using either PRP or a blood clot\n(control) and covered with white mineral trioxide aggregate. All cases were followed up clinically\nand radiographically for 12 months. Differences in bone density, root length, and lesion size were\ncalculated using preoperative and postoperative computed tomography images. The means of the\ndifferences in individual parameters in the blood clot and PRP groups were compared using the\nMann\u00adWhitney U test.\nResults: After 5 months, sensitivity tests (cold and electric pulp tests) elicited a delayed positive\nresponse in 23 sites. At 12 months, cone-beam computed tomography revealed resolution or a\ndecrease in lesion size and an increase in bone density in all 30 (100%) teeth. Additionally,\ncontinued root development was observed in 22 (73%) teeth and early root growth was observed\nin the test group (mineral trioxide aggregate with PRP).\nConclusions: The results of this study suggest that PRP can serve as a successful scaffold for\nregenerative endodontic treatment.

The results of halted\nroot development include weak root dentin,\nopen apices, and stunted root growth; hence,\nsuch teeth are prone to root fracture.1\nMoreover, such abnormalities make them\nunsuitable for debridement and filling with\ntraditional techniques and obturation\nmaterials.2,3 Earlier apexification with cal-\ncium hydroxide,4 which is used to form an\napical hard tissue barricade after multiple\nvisits, was historically the treatment of\nchoice in such cases. However, with the\nadvent of mineral trioxide aggregate\n(MTA), a synthetic wall can be promptly\nformed in the apical third of root with a very\nhigh success rate as proven by many mile-\nstone studies.5\u00ad7 This has also reduced\nthe number of required clinical sessions.\nA disadvantage common to both calcium\nhydroxide and MTA, however, is that they\ndo not allow for continued root develop-\nment, resulting in thin dentin walls and\nhence a feeble root structure.8,9\nThe clinical management of such a per-\nplexing clinical challenge is to stimulate the\nregenerative tissues of the pulp\u00addentin com-\nplex to complete apical development.3\nRecent advances in tissue engineering have\nfocused upon three key factors for tissue\nregeneration: adult stem cells, signaling\nmolecules, and a three-dimensional (3D)\nphysical scaffold that can sustain cell\ngrowth and differentiation. Various authors\nhave recently reported on the concept of\nregenerative endodontics.9\u00ad11 According to\nthese studies, stem cells from the apical\npapilla of immature teeth are accountable\nfor continued apex formation in a sterile\nenvironment.11 Unlike apexification, regen-\neration allows for rapid continuation of root\ndevelopment, increased wall thickness, and\nnatural healing of periapical tissues.10,11\nPreviously published case studies using a\nblood clot as a scaffold for regeneration\nhave established the radiographic signs of\ncontinued thickening of root dentin and\nensuing apex formation in teeth with peria-\npical lesions.12,13 Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)\nhas recently been described as a source of\ngrowth factors and a potentially ideal scaf-\nfold for regenerative endodontic treatment\nregimens because of its ability to maintain\nthe vitality of pulp tissues by promoting cell\ngrowth and transport of growth factors in a\nprotocols that make use of this innate\nmechanism of stimulated healing and regen-\neration of tissues in combination with thor-\nough disinfection of the root canal system\nare useful to manage non-vital immature\nteeth with periapical pathology. Various\ncase series and in-vivo studies of regener-\nation procedures with PRP have been pub-\nsufficient evidence has prevented the exten-\nsive use of such treatment protocols in the\nclinical setting. The aim of the present study\nwas to determine the efficacy of a regenera-\ntive protocol using PRP in non-vital young\npermanent teeth.\nMaterials and methods\nIn this split-mouth-designed study (approved\nby the University of Dammam Institutional\npatients with young permanent single-rooted\nteeth were selected among patients attending\nthe outpatient dental clinics at the College\nof Dentistry, University of Dammam. None\nof the teeth had been previously treated for\nnecrosis. Written informed consent was\nacquired from the patients and their guard-\nians. Institutional ethical clearance was\nobtained for this study.\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows:\n(1) Pulp necrosis with or without periapical\nlesions and an immature apex\n(2) Probability of tooth restoration\n(3) No pathologic mobility, ankylosis, root\nfracture, or probing depths of >3 mm\n(4) No allergy to medications or antibiotics\nPulp necrosis was tentatively diagnosed\nby the patient's dental history and clinical\nexamination findings, which included elec-\ntric pulp testing and cold testing. Clinical\nsigns and symptoms such as pain, swelling,\nfistulas, and sensitivity to percussion and\npalpation were also noted. Among the 16\npatients, 32 non-vital young permanent\nteeth with either apical periodontitis or\nabscesses showing a negative response on\npulp testing were included in the study. All\nteeth were randomly divided into either the\ncontrol group, in which a blood clot was\nused as the scaffold, or the test group, in\nwhich PRP was used as the scaffold. Teeth\nwith periapical lesions were grouped accord-\ning to the size of the lesion as follows:\nScore 0 Intact periapical bone structures\nScore 1 Periapical radiolucency of >0.5 to\nScore 2 Periapical radiolucency of >1 to\nScore 3 Periapical radiolucency of >2 to\nScore 4 Periapical radiolucency of >4 to\nScore 5 Periapical radiolucency of >8 mm\nTreatment procedures\nRegenerative treatment was performed\naccording to the protocol established by the\nAmerican Association of Endodontists.\nUnder rubber dam isolation, an access open-\ning was made followed by copious, gentle\nirrigation with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite,\nand the working length was determined with\na size #20 sterile K-file. Canals were not\ninstrumented but copiously irrigated with\nwith sterile paper points. After sealing the\npulp chamber with a dentin-bonding agent\nto minimize the risk of staining, a 1:1:1\nmixture of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin,\nand minocycline was pulverized and mixed\nwith distilled water to a final concentration\nformed. This paste was placed in the canal\nbelow the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to\nminimize crown staining using a lentulo\nspiral in a slow-speed handpiece. Canals\nwere sealed with reinforced zinc oxide\u00ad\neugenol cement. The patients were followed\nup at 3 weeks, the success of which to\ndisinfect the root canal has been as proved\nby previous studies.2,8,12 The triple anti-\nbiotic paste was applied again for patients\nwith any persistent signs or symptoms of\ninfection, such as purulent drainage, failed\npain resolution, swelling, fistulas, or sensi-\ntivity to percussion and palpation.\nThe response to the initial treatment\nwas assessed after 3 weeks; if the patient\nwas asymptomatic, the antibiotic paste was\nremoved by copious irrigation with 20 ml of\n17% EDTA and normal saline followed by\ndrying of the canals with sterile paper\npoints. Scaffolds were then created accord-\ning to the allocated group. In the blood clot\ngroup, a size #20 K-file was rotated 2 mm\npast the apical foramen under local anes-\nthesia to induce bleeding, filling the root\nblood clot formation, the final restoration\nwas completed with white MTA (Dentsply\nTulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK), glass ionomer\ncement (Fuji VII; GC, Tokyo, Japan), and\nSt. Paul, MN) during the same visit to\nachieve a coronal seal.\nIn the PRP group, no anesthetic was used.\nPRP was prepared according to the descrip-\ntion by Dohan et al.31 PRP was combined\nwith equal volumes of sterile saline solution\ncontaining 10% calcium chloride and sterile\nbovine thrombin (100 U/mL) to achieve\ncoagulation. The PRP was then injected into\nthe root canal up to the level of the CEJ. Final\nrestoration was completed as described for\nthe blood clot group.\nClinical and radiographic follow-up\nClinical and radiographic follow-up exam-\ninations were performed every 3 months\nduring a 12-month follow-up period. The\nsame pediatric dentist performed all follow-\nup examinations.\nTreated teeth were examined for vitality\nusing both electric pulp and cold testing.\nThey were recorded as responding positively\nto vitality testing only if they responded\npositively to both tests. A post-treatment\ncomputed tomography (CT) scan was per-\nformed at 3 months and then repeated at\nleast every 3 to 12 months depending on the\npatient's condition. At the end of 12 months,\ncone-beam CT (CBCT) images were inde-\npendently evaluated with respect to lesion\nsize, periapical healing, and apical closure.\nThe same pediatric dentist re-examined all\nradiographs 1 month after the preliminary\nexamination, and intra-examiner validity\nwas assessed using kappa statistics. Kappa\nvalues ranged from 0.8 to 1.0, signifying\ngood reliability.\nFor all cases, CBCT (I-Cat; Imaging\nSciences International, Hatfield, PA) was\nused to take images of the maxillofacial area\nFigure 1. Preoperative cone-beam computed tomography image showing periapical radiolucencies\n(decreased bone density compared with adjacent normal bone) and root length measured for both the\ncontrol site (blood clot1) and test site (platelet-rich plasma2).\nImages were obtained with an exposure time\nof 9 s. Each scan was taken over 360 with a\nvoxel size of 0.3 mm. The lesion size, bone\ndensity (Hounsfield units), and root length\nwere measured.\nIn the pretreatment CBCT images, the bone\ndensity was recorded in the coronal plane with\na 3.5-mm2 area in regions containing periapical\nlesions and normal adjoining bone regions\n(Figure 1). The final postoperative measure-\nments were made 1 year after the endodontic\ntreatment using CBCT images taken with\nthe same parameters (Figure 2). The mean\ninitial and final bone density measurements\nare shown in Table 1.\nAll CBCT measurements were obtained\nwith Dolphin 3D Imaging software (Dolphin\nImaging Systems, Chatsworth, CA) on a\ncomputer workstation running under\nTable 1.

Sagittal-\nview CBCT images were evaluated to meas-\nure lesion size using the built-in measurement\ntools (Figure 3).\nTo standardize the root length measure-\nments, the alignment for each tooth was\nattuned using the coronal view; the sagittal\nand axial planes were adjusted to intersect\non the CEJ (Figure 4). The root length was\nmeasured along the long axis of each tooth\nfrom the most apical point of the root\nperpendicular to the line connecting the\nmesial and distal CEJs as a measure of\nstandardization34 to determine the change in\nthe length postoperatively.\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were analyzed using the Statistical\nPackage for Social Sciences, version 13 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL). Clinical and radiographic\ndata were assessed using a paired t-test, and a\nP value of <.001 was considered statistically\nsignificant. Comparison between the mean of\nthe differences in individual parameters in the\ncontrol group (blood clot) and test group\n(PRP) was performed using the Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U test, with a P value of <.005\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nPreoperative clinical and radiographic\nfindings\nthe study, only 1 patient did not return for\nthe postoperative follow-up visits. Of 30\nchildren (6 girls, 9 boys), 24 were maxillary\nincisor teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis in\nconjunction with a history of traumatic\ninjury (either crown fracture or luxation)\nand 6 were premolar teeth (1 maxillary first\npremolar, 3 mandibular first premolars, and\nFigure 3.

Moreover, four\nteeth assigned to the PRP group and five\nteeth assigned to the blood clot group\nrequired two sessions with triple antibiotic\npaste until the teeth were symptom-free.\nWith regard to periapical lesions, 8 teeth\n(PRP, 3; blood clot, 1) had no lesions, 10\nteeth (PRP, 3; blood clot, 4) had a score 1\nperiapical lesion, 9 teeth (PRP, 1; blood clot,\n4) had a score 2 periapical lesion, and 3 teeth\n(PRP, 3; blood clot, 1) had a score 3\nperiapical lesion.\nPostoperative clinical and radiographic\nfindings\nThe clinical and radiographic findings of\nboth groups are shown in Table 3. All 15\nwho underwent this endodontic treatment\nprotocol exhibited exceptional clinical and\nradiographic responses. All patients were\nfollowed up for 12 months. After 1 month,\nall teeth were clinically asymptomatic with\ncomprehensive resolution of associated soft\ntissue lesions. After 5 months, sensitivity\ntests (cold and electric pulp tests) elicited a\ndelayed positive response close to that found\nin adjacent teeth in 23 sites. At the 12-month\nfollow-up visit, CBCT findings exhibited\nresolution of or a decrease in the lesion\nsize and an increase in bone density, depict-\ning periapical healing with resolution of\nsigns and symptoms (pain, swelling, fistula,\nand/or sensitivity to percussion and palpa-\ncases). In addition, continued root develop-\nment or apical closure was seen in 22 teeth\nthe blood clot group), whereas a delayed\npositive response to pulpal sensitivity testing\nthe PRP group and 6 in the blood clot\ngroup). Data derived from pretreatment\nand postoperative CT evaluations within\nthe control and test groups showed signifi-\ncant differences in the study parameters\n(P < .001) (Table 1). In the comparison of\neach parameter (lesion size, bone density,\nand root length) between the control group\n(MTA) and test group (MTA \u00fe PRP), only\nthe mean difference in the root length was\nfound to be statistically significant (P < .004)\nDiscussion\ninvestigated different scaffolds for use in\nrevascularization protocols.

At the end of\n12 months, all teeth in the PRP group\nshowed resolution of signs and symptoms\n(pain, swelling, fistulas, and/or sensitivity to\npercussion and palpation), and 93% of teeth\nin the PRP group showed various degrees of\nincreased root length or apical closure.\nThis study did not include collection of\ntissue samples for histologic examination\nbecause of ethical considerations. However,\nthe results of the present study are consistent\nwith those of recent histologic studies that\nreported that PRP alone cannot significantly\net al.32 concluded that PRP successfully\ncreated a scaffold for regenerative endodon-\ntic treatment; however, treatment outcomes\ndid not differ significantly between PRP and\na conventional blood clot scaffold. In\nanother study, Martin et al.36 found that\nPRP may enhance wound healing only if\nparenchymal tissue has not been completely\ndestroyed; it may not otherwise induce tissue\nregeneration. This would explain the similar\noutcomes between PRP and the blood clot\nin the present study because only totally\nnecrotic teeth were included.\nZhu et al.37 used PRP and dental pulp cells\nin a canine study and found a lower rate of\ndentin wall thickening and less mineralized\ntissue formation when PRP was used alone.\nThis result was attributed to more rapid\ndegradation of growth factors in the PRP.\nIn the present study, 3D CBCT was used\nto examine periapical and root length\nchanges based on the fact that previous\nmore sensitive than periapical radiographs\nin detecting periapical lesion treatment out-\ncomes. Estrela et al.33 effectively used 3D\nCBCT and periapical index scoring to meas-\nure radiolucent areas. In the present study,\nbone density was quantitatively measured\nusing the tools within the software.\nA significant decrease in lesion size and\nincrease in bone density were observed.\nNarang et al.38 also concluded that blood\nclots and PRP show comparable results in\nterms of apical closure, root lengthening,\ndentinal wall thickening, and periapical\nhealing. In another study by Jadhav\net al.,39 PRP was more effective than blood\nclots in revascularization, and the authors\nascribed the success of PRP to stimulation\nof collagen production; sustained release of\ngrowth factors; and enhanced recruitment,\nretention, and proliferation of undifferenti-\nated mesenchymal and endothelial cells\nfrom the periapical area.\nAt the time of this writing, all patients\nwere still being monitored to determine the\nlong-term clinical success of PRP as a suc-\ncessful scaffold for regenerative protocols.\nConclusion\nThe results of this study suggest that PRP can\nact as a successful scaffold for regenerative\nendodontic treatment. However, the results\nof treatment with PRP were not significantly\ndifferent from those of the conventional\nprotocol using a blood clot as a scaffold.\nWhat this paper adds\n. Platelet-rich plasma can act as a success-\nful scaffold for regenerative endodontic\ntreatment.\n. Platelet-rich plasma results in an early\nand significant increase in root length\ncompared with the conventional protocol\nusing a blood clot as a scaffold.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of\ninterest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following\nfinancial support for the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article: This research\nstudy was funded by Deanship of Scientific\nResearch, University of Dammam, Grant#\nReferences\n1.
