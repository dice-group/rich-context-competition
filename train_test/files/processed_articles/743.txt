This article uses data from the first wave of the Health and Retirement\nSurvey, which oversamples these populations, to compare the retirement plans of African\nAmerican, Hispanic, and white married men and women. Findings suggest that retirement\nexpectations may accurately forecast retirement behavior and that the differences by race\nand ethnicity, as well as by gender, that are evident in retirement plans are likely to be\nreflected in retirement outcomes.\nKey Words: Retirement plans, Subjective probabilities,\nDeterminants of retirement, Pensions, Social Security\nRetirement Expectations: Differences\nby Race, Ethnicity, and Gender1\nMarjorie Honig, PhD2\nDo people think seriously and systematically about\nthe future? The answer to this question has impor-\ntant implications for both researchers and policyma-\nkers. Recent changes in Social Security, for example,\nwere designed to increase the labor supply of elderly\npersons, but the outcomes will depend on whether\nindividuals take into account their future benefit\nstream in making employment decisions. If they are\nmyopic and consider only current benefits, policies\nsuch as increases in the delayed retirement credit for\npostponing Social Security benefit receipt beyond\nage 65 will not have the intended effect (See Reimers\n& Honig, 1996, for evidence that this is likely to be the\ncase for men, but not for women).\nThe degree to which poverty among the elderly\narises from a lack of financial planning in preretire-\nment years may also be determined with information\non household time horizons. A relatively new and\nrelated issue is whether married women's increased\nlabor force participation will translate into lower pov-\nerty rates among retirees. Recent evidence suggests\nthat divorce results in a larger decline in the ratio of\nincome to needs of older women than the death of a\nspouse (Quinn, 1993). If married women fail to take\ninto account both the higher divorce probabilities of\nrecent years and the effect of their current employ-\nment decisions on their own retirement income,\n1An earlier version of this article was presented at the 1995 annual\nmeetings of the American Economic Association, Washington, DC.

African American and\nHispanic women are particularly vulnerable because\nthe relatively low wealth accumulation in these\nhouseholds implies that divorced women will have\nfew assets in retirement other than those related to\ntheir own past earnings.\nThis article examines responses in the Health and\nRetirement Study (HRS; Juster & Suzman, 1995)\nregarding retirement expectations to determine\nwhether workers think coherently about the future.\nAlthough expectations cannot be matched with real-\nizations until additional waves of the survey have\nbeen collected, the consistency of responses regard-\ning retirement plans can be evaluated, and expected\nretirement functions can be compared with findings\non actual retirement. If expected and observed re-\ntirement functions are similar, we may assume that\nthe same underlying behavioral model generates\nboth expectations and realizations and thus have\nmore confidence that retirement expectations accu-\nrately predict future employment status.\nIn this article, I first discuss evidence on the valid-\nity of the expectations data in previous surveys and\nthen examine the responses, which take the form of\nsubjective probability statements, to expectations\nquestions in the HRS. The subjective probability of\nworking full time after age 62 is then estimated as a\nfunction of known determinants of observed retire-\nment on samples of married men and women among\nthree demographic groups: non-Hispanic whites,\nnon-Hispanic African Americans, and Hispanics.\nAlthough there is a large literature examining the\nretirement decisions of white men (for a survey, see\nQuinn, Burkhauser, & Myers, 1990), and a few stud-\nies on white women (Hanoch & Honig, 1983; Honig,\nregarding the factors that influence the behavior of\nAfrican American and Hispanic women and men.\nThere are reasons to believe, moreover, that their\nbehavior may differ from that of whites. In the HRS,\nwe observe substantial differences among the three\ngroups in retirement rates and in several of the fac-\ntors that influence retirement such as health, health\ninsurance coverage, and eligibility for employer pen-\nsions and Social Security (Gustman, Mitchell, &\nstudy to include an analysis of the retirement be-\nhavior of African American men concludes that dif-\nferences with whites are due either to different\npreferences for nonmarket activities, suggesting un-\nobserved cultural differences, or to different charac-\nteristics of jobs (Gustman & Steinmeier, 1986).\nAmong younger African American and white married\nwomen, differences in labor force participation have\nbeen attributed to cultural differences between the\ntwo populations (Reimers, 1985). Thus, it is impor-\ntant to examine retirement expectations separately\nby race and ethnicity, as well as by gender. Whether\nobserved differences may be attributable to cultural\nfactors not accounted for by measured characteris-\ntics will become evident with further study.\nThe findings in this article suggest that a common\nbehavioral model appears to underlie both retire-\nment expectations and outcomes. Several measures\nof the expected net reward to work, nonlabor in-\ncome, and the value of nommarket time are signifi-\ncantly related to respondents' expectations of con-\ntinuing full-time work after age 62. These results are\nsimilar to findings on actual retirement. Of particular\nimportance are continued coverage in health plans,\nexpected changes in pension wealth, and current\nhealth status. Although larger samples provide more\nprecise estimates for whites, findings on African\nAmericans and Hispanics indicate that information\non their retirement expectations, which differ in\nsome important respects from those of whites, can\nincrease our understanding of their future retire-\nment behavior. Differences in expectations among\nwhite men and women, which are consistent with\ngender differences observed in the retirement deci-\nsions of whites, are also found.\nIn the next section of the article, I discuss the\nevidence to date on the validity of retirement expec-\ntations. In sections three and four, I develop a simple\nmodel of retirement expectations, discuss the data,\nand specify the retirement expectations function. In\nsection five, I discuss the empirical results, and in the\nfinal section I draw some conclusions from these\nfindings.\nRetirement Expectations\nAlthough there is an extensive body of literature\non the usefulness of expectations data in other disci-\nplines (Hendershot & Placek, 1981; Turner & Martin,\n1984), there have been few studies that have exam-\nined the accuracy of expectations regarding eco-\nnomic outcomes over relatively long time horizons.\nWith respect to retirement, a small number of stud-\nies have examined the correspondence between\nworkers' plans and their subsequent withdrawal\nfrom the labor force (Anderson, Burkhauser, &\nGonul, 1985). Older workers in the Retirement His-\ntory Study (Irelan, 1976) were found to make rela-\ntively accurate forecasts regarding their age of retire-\nment and Social Security entitlements, conditional\non the information available to them at the time.\nFurthermore, when realized retirement deviated\nfrom expected retirement, the difference was correl-\nated with unforeseeable changes in circumstances,\nsuch as legislated increases in Social Security bene-\nfits, changes in health, or in local labor market condi-\ntions. Respondents in the National Longitudinal Sur-\nvey of Mature Men (Parnes, 1985) were also found to\npredict their age of retirement with considerable\naccuracy. Interestingly, the accuracy of expectations\nwas found to differ systematically by gender. Men in\nthe Retirement History Survey formed more accurate\nexpectations, that is, closer to realizations, regarding\nthe timing of retirement, whereas women were more\naccurate about the value of future Social Security\nbenefits. Overall, respondents' forecasts of Social\nSecurity benefits explained roughly 60% of the vari-\nance in realizations. Other studies examining survey\nresponses regarding the expected age of retirement\nfound that expected retirement age was explained by\na number of the same factors as realized retirement\n1980; Holtmann, Fronstin, Ullmann, & Longino,\nThe expectations questions in the HRS are de-\nsigned to elicit probability distributions of future\nretirement rather than an anticipated age of retire-\nment, as in previous surveys. Framed in this way, the\nquestions allow for direct tests of the consistency of\nindividual responses. Full-time workers are asked\nthe chances, on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is equal\nto \"absolutely no chance\" and 10 implies \"absolutely\ncertain,\" that they will be working full time after they\nresponses to these questions may be interpreted as\nsubjective probabilities.\nThese responses may not be useful, however, if\nindividuals have little idea of the probabilities of\nfuture events or if they choose to answer randomly.\nExamination of responses in the first wave of the HRS\nto these questions and to similar questions regard-\ning life expectancy indicates that respondents on\naverage provide consistent and reasonable answers.\nHurd and McGarry (1994) find for the sample as a\nwhole that the subjective probabilities are internally\nconsistent, that is, they imply conditional probabili-\nties (probability of working after age 65, given the\nprobability of working after age 62) between zero\nand one. They also find that the subjective probabili-\nties are externally consistent in that they correlate\nwith observed retirement probabilities and life ex-\npectancies. Moreover, simple cross-tabulations indi-\ncate that the probabilities of working past ages 62 and\n65 covary with several measures of health status and\nwith key features of employer pensions, two of the\nimportant determinants of the age of retirement.\nFigures 1 and 2 present the subjective probability\ndistributions of continuing full-time work past age\n62 of married non-Hispanic white (thereafter,\n\"white\"), non-Hispanic African American (thereaf-\nter, \"black\"), and Hispanic men and women. The\ndistributions represent conditional probabilities,\nthat is, the probability of working full time past 62\ngiven that the person is currently working full time.\nThe means of these distributions for men for the\nprobabilities of full-time work past age 65 are less\nthan half these values for both genders. Thus, it\nappears that relatively few married men and women\ncurrently working full time expect to be engaged in\nfull-time work after 65. This sample response reflects\nobserved differences for these ages in population\nlabor force participation rates. Accordingly, this\nstudy focuses on the decision to leave full-time work\nafter age 62 rather than after 65. The decision to leave\nfull-time work will be treated as synonymous with\nthe retirement decision; the issue of partial retire-\nment, in other words, will not be addressed. Among\nfull-time workers, less than 20% of women and 10%\nof men expect to work a reduced number of hours\non their current job. Moreover, the mean age at\nwhich respondents report that they expect to retire\n(as distinct from leaving full-time work) is 63.2 for\nmen and 62.9 for women, which is consistent with\ntheir reports of leaving full-time work.\nThe probability distributions in Figures 1 and 2\nreveal a bunching at zero, 1.0, and .5 for both gen-\nders. This pattern suggests that many respondents\nare certain that they will not work past age 62, many\nothers are certain that they will work past 62, and still\nothers are uncertain. That many respondents choose\neither zero or 1.0 is not surprising because leaving\nfull-time work is to a large extent a matter of choice,\nand many in this age group are likely to have already\ndecided whether or not to continue working after 62.\nThose selecting .5 may not have made a decision or\nmay face greater uncertainty. There are also spikes at\n.2 and .8 for both men and women and some mass at\neach of the other values.\nThe distributions reveal some differences by gen-\nder. Spikes at zero are higher for women than for\nmen, although this is true only among blacks and\nHispanics. In the white population, roughly equal\nproportions of men and women express little confi-\ndence that they will continue to work after 62. There\nare also racial and ethnic differences reflected in\nthese distributions. Among men, the spike at zero is\nhighest for blacks and lowest for Hispanics; at 1.0,\nthe order is reversed. The spikes at .5, however, are\nsimilar. In other words, the two populations differ\nless in the proportions who feel uncertain about\ntheir future work status than in the fractions who are\ncertain that they either will or will not work past 62.\nThe proportions of white men lie between those of\nblacks and Hispanics at all three values. Among\nwomen, roughly equal proportions of white women\nchoose values of zero and 1.0.

In light of this, and the\nevidence found by Hurd and McGarry (1994) in the\nfull HRS sample, I assume that respondents' subjec-\ntive probabilities of working past age 62 are valid\npredictors of their objective probabilities of retire-\nment at this age, conditional on the information\navailable to them at the time of the HRS interview. I\nthen examine whether these retirement expectations\ncould have been generated by the same underlying\nbehavioral model that has been found to explain\nobserved retirement outcomes.\nI assume that at some \"planning\" age before re-\ntirement, older workers forecast their future earn-\nings, pension and Social Security entitlements, non-\nlabor income, and the value of their nonmarket time.\nThey then form expectations regarding the age at\nwhich they will retire, which they may revise on\nreceipt of new information. Because the question in\nthe HRS asks about the likelihood of working after\nreaching age 62, I assume that individuals forecast\nthe income available to them on reaching age 62\nshould they leave full-time work then, and the addi-\ntional income they would receive if they work an-\nother year. Income available to the individual on\nbecoming 62, which I call the base income, consists\nof expected nonlabor income at that age plus the\nexpected value (discounted back to age 62) of the\nfuture stream of Social Security and pension benefits\nthat will be received if he or she retires on becoming\n62. The return from working an additional year is\nequal to expected wage and nonwage compensa-\ntion, plus the expected change in the discounted\nvalue at 62 of Social Security and pension income due\nto an additional year's earnings. Changes in the latter\nmay not necessarily be positive. Asset values of em-\nployer pensions may decline if benefits are struc-\ntured to encourage retirement before age 62 (Fields\nrity wealth may either remain constant from age 62 to\n64 because benefits lost due to delayed retirement\nare recouped later by means of an actuarially fair\nadjustment (for those with average life expectan-\ncies), or may increase if higher earnings result in\nlarger recomputed benefits (Burkhauser, 1980;\nTheoretical considerations suggest that the larger a\nperson's expected base income at age 62, the lower\nthe likelihood that he or she will plan to continue\nworking after 62. The greater the expected net re-\nward from working another year, however, the\nhigher the expected income but the higher the price\nof leaving work as well. If the latter effect dominates,\nthe individual will expect to continue working past\nage 62. Plans for working past 62 are also predicted to\nbe influenced by the expected value of nonmarket\ntime at age 62. This may depend on a number of\nfactors: the individual's own health, his or her\nspouse's health and labor force status, other family\nresponsibilities, and his or her tastes for individual or\njoint nonmarket activities.\nI examine the retirement expectations of married\nmen and women using the traditional family model\nof labor supply (Killingsworth, 1983; Pozzebon &\nMitchell, 1989). Adapted to retirement expectations,\nthis model assumes that married women form expec-\ntations regarding their own retirement conditional\non the retirement plans of their husbands. They in\neffect treat their husbands' expected earnings as a\nform of property income. Husbands, however, form\nexpectations independently of their wives' retire-\nment plans and expected earnings.\nData and Model Specification\nried women used in this study are drawn from the\nfirst wave of HRS interviews. These samples of re-\nspondents between the ages of 46-61 who were full-\ntime wage and salary workers at the time of their\ninterview are divided into six subsamples of white,\nblack, and Hispanic married men and women. The\nbase age range of 51-61 years was selected for the\nHRS to ensure that most respondents had not yet\nretired at the first interview but were sufficiently\nclose to retirement age to have formed some expec-\ntations regarding retirement. This sample design is\nintended to provide information on the formation of\nretirement expectations and the process by which\nnew information becomes incorporated into expec-\ntations. For purposes of this study, spouses aged 46-\n50 married to age-eligible respondents are added to\nprovide larger samples of the black and Hispanic\npopulations. The self-employed, those with unre-\nported wages, and multiple job-holders are excluded\nfrom the samples. Full-time employment is defined\nas 25 or more weekly hours to include those who may\nbe working less than the standard 35 hours but who\nmay nonetheless consider themselves full-time\nworkers and report their expectations of continuing\n\"full-time\" on their current job.\nAs discussed earlier, the expectations that workers\nform regarding the likelihood of continuing to work\nfull time past age 62 are assumed to depend on the\nincome they expect to receive on retirement at 62\n(the base income), the additional income they expect\nfor working another year (the net reward to work),\nand their anticipated tastes and preferences at age 62\nfor time spent outside of the market (the value of\nnonmarket time). Expected base income at age 62 has\nthree components: expected nonwork-related in-\ncome, the expected discounted value of the future of\nSocial Security benefits, and the expected dis-\ncounted value of the future stream of benefits from\nan employer pension. Expected nonearnings income\nis measured by workers' current nonwork-related\nincome. For men, this consists of asset and dividend\nincome; for women, the latter plus husbands' earn-\nings, under the assumptions of the traditional family\nmodel of labor supply. The expected discounted\nvalue of the future stream of Social Security benefits\nis measured by respondents' reports of the benefits\nthey expect to receive. Expected benefits from em-\nployer pensions are reported with considerably less\naccuracy; thus, differences in the expected value of\ndefined benefit or defined contribution pensions are\nrepresented by a dummy variable for whether work-\ners are covered by one or both of these types of\nplans.\nThe net reward for an additional year of work past\nage 62 is measured by (1) the individual's current\nwage, as an estimate of earnings from another year of\nfull-time work after 62; (2) current coverage under\nemployer-provided health and disability insurance\nplans, as an estimate of expected additional non-\nwage compensation; and (3) the age at which the\nworker is first eligible to receive employer pension\nbenefits, as an estimate of whether the worker's\npension wealth is likely to decline with an additional\nyear of work past 62. This latter measure is based on\nevidence indicating that in many employer plans, the\ndiscounted value of the pension begins to decline at\nthe age at which workers are eligible for \"early\"\nbenefits (Fields & Mitchell, 1984; Kotlikoff & Wise,\n1985). Nearly all employer pension plans have provi-\nsions for early receipt of benefits with actuarial re-\nductions of full benefits to cover the longer payout\nperiod. Employers who wish to induce workers to\nretire early may reduce benefits by less than the full\nactuarial amount for retirement at this age. Past this\nage, however, pension wealth may decline signifi-\ncantly. Because many plans set the age of eligibility\nfor early benefits at 55, pension wealth may be de-\nclining for many workers with continued work after\nThe expected value of nonmarket time is mea-\nsured by four variables: respondent's health,\nspouse's health, spouse's labor force status, and\nrespondent's evaluation of the importance of spend-\ning time with his or her spouse in retirement. Some\nmeasures of characteristics of the current job are also\nincluded to capture variations in the disutility of\nwork or in occupational retirement norms. These\nmeasures are whether the job involves repetitive\nwork or stress, whether it requires skill with people,\nor whether it is in the public sector.\nEstimation Results\nTable 1 contains means and standard deviations of\nthe variables described earlier for each of the six\ndemographic samples. Maximum likelihood esti-\nmates of the expected retirement functions of mar-\nried men appear in Table 2 and of married women in\nTable 3. Although the subjective probability of con-\ntinuing work after reaching age 62 takes on discrete\nvalues from 0 to 1, this probability scale represents a\nranking rather than a continuous variable. The ordi-\nnal values, however, are derived from a continuous\nunderlying response function in which each individ-\nual assigns a likelihood to working after 62 as a\nfunction of a set of explanatory variables related to\nhis or her expected base income, net reward to work,\nand value of nonmarket time. This response function\nis a latent regression because the degree of confi-\ndence that an individual feels about his or her em-\nployment after 62 is unobserved. What is observed is\nthe choice of a cell, from an ordered number of cells\nfrom 0 to 1, closest to his or her estimation of the\nchances of working past 62. The subjective probabil-\nity scale is thus an ordered categorical variable and, if\na normal distribution of the errors is assumed, is\nappropriately estimated by an ordered probit model.\n(The functions in Tables 2 and 3 were also estimated\nby linear least squares. Findings were similar to those\nusing maximum likelihood estimation, although sig-\nnificance levels of individual coefficients varied to\nsome degree between the two methods.)\nThe results shown in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that\nexpected retirement, as measured here by the sub-\njective probability of continuing to work full time\nafter age 62, is explained by the same factors that\ninfluence actual retirement outcomes. Although\nfindings vary by demographic group, a number of\nmeasures of the expected income at 62, the expected\nreward for working another year, and the expected\nvalue of nonmarket time are significant determinants\nof the individual's assessment of his or her chances\nof continuing to work after reaching 62. The gener-\nally higher significance levels in the larger samples of\nwhite men and women suggest that although retire-\nment expectations may be fairly accurate indicators\nof eventual retirement on average, there is consider-\nable noise around the mean values. Nonetheless,\nfour of the six estimated functions in Tables 2 and 3\nare significant at the .01 level, and a fifth, for black\nwomen, is significant at the .05 level. Only the func-\ntion for Hispanic men is below standard levels of\nsignificance (.16). Differences in the functions of\nwhites, blacks, and Hispanics are significant at the\n.01 level among both men and women. The maxi-\nmum likelihood analog of a goodness-of-fit measure,\nthe likelihood ratio index, indicates that the included\nvariables explain a relatively small proportion of the\nvariation in the dependent variable, not unlike real-\nized retirement functions.\nAmong measures of the expected reward for an\nadditional year of work after reaching 62, continued\ncoverage in health plans and expected changes in\npension wealth have the most significant impact on\nworkers' expectations of continuing full-time work.\nThese results are consistent with findings on actual\nretirement decisions. The availability of low-cost\nhealth insurance on the job has long been postulated\nas a major influence in delaying retirement but has\nonly recently been confirmed empirically (Rust &\nPhelan, 1993). Recent evidence also indicates that\nemployees who are able to continue health insur-\nance coverage under employer plans after leaving\nthe job tend to retire earlier (Gruber & Madrian,\nresponses are reflected in the retirement expecta-\ntions of white men and women in Tables 2 and 3.\nAmong those whose coverage terminates when they\nleave the job, health insurance is strongly correlated\nwith expectations of continuing work past 62. Those\nwho report that they are able to continue coverage\nunder their employers' plans, on the other hand,\nexpect an earlier withdrawal. The effect of employer-\nprovided health insurance among the black and His-\npanic populations is mixed. Black men whose cover-\nage terminates with the job expect to leave their jobs\nearlier, rather than later, than those not covered by\nhealth insurance. Hispanic women whose coverage\nterminates expect to remain longer on the job; the\ncoefficient is imprecisely measured, however. Re-\nmaining coefficients of health insurance variables are\nnot different from zero.\nA proxy measure for whether the present dis-\nTable 1.

The change in pension wealth is mea-\nsured by a dummy variable equal to 1 if the age at\nwhich covered workers are first eligible for benefits\nis greater than 62. Because in many employer pen-\nsion plans the discounted value of the pension rises\nuntil the age of eligibility for \"early\" benefits, and\nfalls thereafter, a value of 1 indicates that pension\nwealth is likely to increase with an additional year of\nwork after 62. (For workers with capital market con-\nstraints, who would have preferred to retire earlier,\nthis variable may also reflect the effect of the first\navailability of pension benefits on expected retire-\nment.) In all groups except black women, those\nwhose pension wealth increases with additional\nwork expect to continue working past 62. These\neffects are significant at the .05 level or above.\nA second dummy variable is equal to 1 if respon-\ndents know the age at which they are first eligible for\nbenefits. Given inclusion of the variable for eligibility\nafter age 62, the coefficient of this control variable\nmeasures, among those who are eligible for early\nbenefits before age 62, the effect of a decline in\nTable 2.

In all six groups,\nworkers Whose pension values begin to decline be-\nfore age 62 have lower probabilities of continuing on\ntheir jobs past 62, although the coefficients are pre-\ncisely estimated only for black and Hispanic women.\nA third control variable has a value of 1 if the worker\nis covered by an employer pension. Given the two\nprevious variables, the coefficient of this coverage\nvariable measures the effect of being covered by an\nemployer pension among those who do not know\ntheir age of eligibility for early benefits. This variable\nis significant only for white men, who report a lower\nlikelihood of working past 62.\nThis finding of the importance of employer pen-\nsions in expectations is consistent with the critical\nrole they have been found to play in realized retire-\nment. Among women, in fact, the results here sug-\ngest that pensions may play an even more important\nrole in the future than they have previously. Esti-\nmates on samples from the Retirement History Sur-\nvey of married men and unmarried women who\nretired in the 1970s found that the effects of em-\nployer pensions were weaker among women than\nmen (Hanoch & Honig, 1983; Reimers & Honig,\n1996). This difference is not apparent in these find-\nings on the expectations of current preretirement\nmen and women.\nA third component of the net reward for an addi-\ntional year of work, coverage under employer-\nprovided disability plans, has a positive and statisti-\ncally significant effect on the expectations of\nfull-time employment after 62 among white and\nblack women. (The fact that coverage for chronic,\nlong-term heath problems is more important for\nblack women than coverage under general health\ninsurance may indicate greater incidence of these\nproblems in this population or may be related to\nindustry or occupational risk differentials not cap-\ntured in the included job-characteristics variables.)\nAmong Hispanic women and men, the effect is also\npositive but imprecisely measured. Among white\nmen, employer-provided disability insurance is asso-\nciated with earlier rather than later retirement from\nthe job. This counterintuitive result, similar to the\nfindings on the effect of health insurance among\nblack men, merits further examination. It is possible,\nfor example, that both results reflect aspects of jobs\nthat are not measured by the included job-\ncharacteristics variables. The final measure of the\nreward for an additional year of full-time work is the\nhourly wage on the current job. Coefficients of the\nnatural logarithm of the wage are mostly negative\nand not statistically significant (with the exception of\nthat of white men), suggesting that the negative\neffects on additional work of a higher income are\noffset by the higher price of leaving work.\nWe now turn to measures of the expected base\nincome at age 62, which is predicted to have a nega-\ntive effect on the expectations of working past 62.\nCoverage under an employer pension plan in itself,\nas a measure of expectations regarding a pension of\nwhich neither age of eligibility nor amount of poten-\ntial benefit is known, has the predicted negative\neffect among white men only. Coverage under Social\nSecurity in itself (among those who say that they do\nnot know what their future benefits will be) influ-\nences expectations only among Hispanics and, inter-\nestingly, is associated with a greater likelihood of\ncontinuing work past 62. Because the majority of\nHispanic men and women in this sample of full-time\nworkers are immigrants, it is possible that many may\nwish to increase potential Social Security benefits by\naccumulating additional years of higher earnings.\nThis explanation is consistent with the lower ex-\npected benefits of Hispanics relative to blacks and\nwhites (Table 1).\nSelf-reported expected Social Security benefits are\nnot a significant determinant of plans for continued\nwork among any of the demographic groups. With-\nout Social Security earnings records, it is impossible\nto determine the extent to which this finding reflects\nreporting error or the true unimportance of varia-\ntions in Social Security benefits. The majority of\nstudies that have examined the effect of Social Secu-\nrity on retirement outcomes have found significant,\nalthough often small effects (see the summary of this\nresearch in Quinn, Burkhauser, & Myers, 1990). Re-\nspondents who know the value of their future bene-\nfits tend to have a lower probability of continuing\nwork past 62 than those who expect to receive bene-\nfits but are unable to report an expected amount, but\nthis effect is significant among white men only. (This\nresult for white men is consistent with findings that\nthe strongest predictor of actual retirement age\namong white men is whether they are aware of the\nvalue of their potential Social Security benefits,\nThe final measure of expected base income is\nnonwork-related income. This variable includes, for\nmen, interest and dividends, rental income, and in-\ncome from trusts; for women, it also includes hus-\nbands' earnings. The variable has the predicted neg-\native sign and is highly significant for white men and\njust under standard levels of significance for white\nwomen (probability value = .15). It is not significant\nfor blacks or Hispanics of either gender. (Dummy\nvariables for whether positive values of property\nincome and spouse's earnings were reported were\nincluded in the estimations but are not reported.)\nFinally, factors affecting the expected value of non-\nmarket time or the disutility of work at age 62 should\ninfluence expectations regarding continuing full-\ntime work after that age, if the behavioral model\nunderlying expectations is the same as that generat-\ning actual retirement outcomes. The HRS provides a\nnumber of alternative measures of the value of non-\nmarket time, and in the absence of strong theoretical\npredictions regarding these alternatives, several\nwere tested to determine their explanatory power.\nWith the exception of the worker's own health,\nwhich is one of the most important influences on\nrealized retirement and therefore of special interest\nfor its role in expectations, only variables that were\nsignificant (or close to significance) were retained in\nthe estimations. As Tables 2 and 3 indicate, there was\nconsiderable variation in the importance of each\nfactor among the six groups.\nAmong men, health status as measured by a self-\nreported index of overall health condition is one of\nthe most important factors influencing expectations\nof continued work. Among women workers, how-\never, health is important only among Hispanic\nwomen. This gender difference is not surprising be-\ncause it is consistent with findings in the retirement\nliterature that have concluded that, unlike married\nmen, married women in poor health tend to with-\ndraw early from the labor force (or do not enter it) so\nthat health condition is not observed to influence the\nretirement decisions of workers. These findings refer\nto the white population and the implication that,\namong white workers, men's health should be worse\non average than that of women is borne out in our\nsamples (Table 1). The self-reported health of black\nmen and women in the sample is similar, however,\nraising the question of why health is not as important\na consideration for black women as it is for black\nmen. Among Hispanic workers, the health status of\nwomen is worse than that of men. Thus, it is perhaps\nnot surprising that health is an important factor in the\nretirement plans of Hispanic women.\nThree additional measures of the value of nonmar-\nket time are important factors for at least one demo-\ngraphic group. Spouse's health is significant for\nwhite men and women, and the positive sign for both\ngenders indicates that although poor health of a\nspouse may raise the value of nonmarket time, it has\na larger effect on the income needs of the house-\nhold; thus, both men and women expect to continue\nworking past 62. White men and black women expect\nto continue working if their spouses are currently\nworking (a proxy for spouse's expected employment\nstatus when the respondent is 62), although the coef-\nficient is not precisely estimated for black women.\nThese results imply preferences for joint leisure in\nthese groups.\nThe HRS also provides a direct measure of the\nimportance that a married person places on being\nable to spend more time with a spouse in retirement.\nRespondents were asked to rank, on a scale from 1\n(\"very important\") to 4 (\"not important at all\"), a\nnumber of characteristics generally considered to be\npositive about retirement, including having more\ntime with one's spouse. This measure captures not\nonly the value of home production arising from\nhousehold needs related to the health or age of the\nspouse, but also the value placed on joint leisure\nactivities. Interestingly, the coefficients of this vari-\nable are insignificant for men, but positive and highly\nsignificant for two of the three groups of women.\nBoth white and Hispanic women who place a higher\nvalue on time with their husbands in retirement have\na lower expected probability of continuing full-time\nA number of characteristics of jobs that may influ-\nence the disutility of work are found to be important\nfactors in men's decisions regarding continued work\nbut relatively unimportant for women. Jobs involving\nrepetitive tasks or stress are associated with lower\nexpectations of continuing to work past 62 for white\nand Hispanic men; jobs requiring skill with people\nare associated with higher expectations of working\namong white men, but lower expectations among\nblack men. For both white and black men, jobs in the\npublic sector are associated with lower expectations\nof continuing work. Among women, reduced expec-\ntations of continuing work are associated with,\namong Hispanic women, jobs involving repetitive\ntasks and, among black women, jobs involving\nstress.\nConclusion\nThese findings on data from the Health and Retire-\nment Study suggest that information on retirement\nexpectations will enhance our understanding of re-\ntirement behavior and our ability to forecast re-\nsponses to changes in public policy regarding retire-\nment. Expected retirement functions, estimated\nseparately for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nAfrican-American, and Hispanic men and women,\nappear to have been generated by the same underly-\ning behavioral model that has been found to explain\nretirement outcomes. To varying degrees among the\nsix demographic groups, measures of expected re-\ntirement income, the net reward to continued work,\nand the value of nonmarket time influence workers'\nexpectations of continuing work after age 62. Al-\nthough results are strongest for white men and\nwomen, for whom large samples provide more pre-\ncise estimation, findings on all three populations in-\ncrease our confidence that information on retirement\nexpectations may improve our estimates of current\nbehavior and our forecasts of future behavior.\nReferences\nAnderson, K.
