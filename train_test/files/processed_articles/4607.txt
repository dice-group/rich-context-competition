From the results, it was found that daily Internet use was on the average\n(33.7%), and use was constrained by the poor power supply, the high cost of the Internet access, and poor delivery of services.\nHealth information sought covers nutrition, fitness/exercise, HIV/AIDS, malaria, sore throat, mental health, menstrual pain,\nand sexual/reproductive health. The majority (72.7%) who perceived available health information as accurate and dependable\nhad an opportunity to seek similar information on their health conditions from different online sources. A high proportion\n(202) claimed that they consulted a physician after that, just a few (54) of the respondents consulted a traditional healer, and\na few others relied on self-medication (10%) or asked friends for suggestions (11%).

These networks provide rich and versatile platforms\nfor diverse interactions and sharing of information (Antoci,\ndifferent cultures subscribe and access all sorts of informa-\ntion from these platforms. Through this process of network-\ning and information sharing, knowledge is developed and\npossibly deployed as individuals or group members may\ndeem fit. These include acquiring and sharing of informa-\ntion on health and other topical issues. The speed at which\ninformation spread and the possible implications for indi-\nviduals and society are overwhelming. As such, some coun-\ntries have called for censoring and restricted access, and\nsome have argued in favor of unrestricted access (Warf,\n2011). To the latter group, unlimited Internet access is indis-\npensable for information dissemination as it has the poten-\ntial of promoting the health and well-being of different\nsocial groups, especially the youth.\nIn terms of disease burden, young people are among the\nmost affected by the various social categories. A possible\nimplication is a need for self-care practices and searches for\nhealth information, especially on socially stigmatizing con-\nditions, like sexual and mental health problems. This possi-\nbility may become complicated by an established culture of\nself-medication and poor health systems performance. Over\nthe decades, efforts have been made to address the poor\nhealth performance as well as discourage self-medication as\na healthy practice. Despite these efforts, marginal achieve-\nments have been obtained, thereby calling for more attention\nand understanding. Self-care practices (ability to purchase\nprescribed drugs without a prescription sheet from a quali-\nfied physician) are widespread among undergraduates in\nNigeria (Fadare & Tamuno, 2011; Osemene & Lamikanra,\n2012). Against this backdrop, the possibility of abusing some\ndrugs remains high as shown in the abuse of antibiotics\n(Fadare & Tamuno, 2011; Famuyiwa, Aina, & Bankole-Oki,\n2011). Thus, this article investigates online health seeking\nand its possible influence on decision making among\nNigerian undergraduates.\nWith the challenges of regulating and maintaining prompt\naccess to quality and trustworthy health information, there is\na need to focus on the implications of this development in\nhealth care service delivery and consumption among young\n1University of Ibadan, Nigeria\n2Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, Nigeria\n3University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa\nCorresponding Author:\nOluwaseun I.

Similarly, improved access to health informa-\ntion could also prompt help seeking from informal sources\nand self-medication, depending on context and nature of\nhealth or disease conditions. As a result, studies on where\nindividuals get health information and whether they use\nonline resources have become a major research focus in\nrecent times (Percheski & Hargittai, 2010). Nonetheless,\nKam, Stanszus, Cheah, Heerasing, and Yi Tie (2010) noted\nthat studies with a primary emphasis on the use of Internet by\nuniversity students as a source of health information are not\ncommon. Hence, exploring the utilization of the Internet by\nthis unique group is important. Young people represent the\nmost active Internet users among all ages who are using the\nplatform daily for information seeking and communication\nNigeria, the most populousAfrican country, has a teeming\npopulation of young people who are mobile phone users,\nwith increasing access to the Internet (Stork, Calandro, &\nGillwald, 2013). The Internet access and usage in Nigeria are\non the rise with the advent of telecommunication companies\nproviding wider access through mobile phones (Kadiri &\nAlabi, 2014). With this development comes higher exposure\nto different kinds of information, including those relating to\nhealth and disease conditions (Amaugo, Papadopoulos,\nOchieng, & Ali, 2014). This article proceeds with a focus on\nthe relevant literature on online health seeking among youth.\nThe context through which empirical evidence was gener-\nated came next and was followed by a presentation of the\nresults. The discussion of the findings in relation to existing\nknowledge on online health seeking was followed with the\nconclusion.\nYouth and the Use of the Internet for\nHealth Information\nOnline health information seeking has its benefits and short-\ncomings. Parts of the benefits include timeliness and a broad\nrange of information on specific and different health and dis-\nease conditions. Through this process, health information\nbecomes readily available in a way that patients' knowledge\nbecomes widened and relevant for more participation in ther-\napeutic relationships (Sillence, Briggs, Harris, & Fishwick,\n2007). It could also promote the making of more informed\ndecisions and compliance with medications. However, online\naccess to health information also raises debates about the\nquality, trustworthiness, and applicability of the enormous\nvolume of health information among different social catego-\nEscoffery et al. (2005) in a study among college students\nin the United States showed that the use of the Internet\namong students is rising. Specifically, the study showed that\nmore than 70% of the respondents had used online health\ninformation, and more than 40% reported using it frequently.\nThis increase is similar to Kitikannakorn and Sitthiworanan's\n(2009) findings among students in Thailand. In both studies,\nabout 70% of the students with access to online health infor-\nmation sought information on general health, disease treat-\nment, and nutrition. Reasons for using the Internet include\neasy access and availability of updated information. Youth's\ninvolvement and active consumption of online health infor-\nmation also reflected in Horgan and Sweeney's (2012) find-\nings in Ireland. The Horgan and Sweeney's (2012) study\nshowed that more than 66% of the students use the Internet\nto search for health information on a specific illness, social\nhealth fitness, and nutrition information. Shaikh, Shaikh,\nstudents in Islamabad used the Internet for seeking health\ninformation. In contrast, a survey in India by Birpreet,\nplatform for health information, despite the number of stu-\ndents using the platform for other things. Infrastructural\ndevelopments, availability of quality Internet access, and\nownership of the computer or mobile phones with the\nInternet access accounted for significant variations in terms\nof access. This is vital to improving Internet access, espe-\ncially among rural dwellers. Beyond the structural con-\nstraints and benefits, the quality of health information,\nadequacy, and trustworthiness remains paramount to the\ninformation seeker and the society.\nThe quality of health information provided through the\nInternet has emerged as a major issue, especially with the\ngrowing rate of utilizing this platform for firsthand and\nsnappy information (Scott, Gilmour, & Fielden, 2008). This,\naccording to Birpreet et al. (2011), led to the evolution of the\nInternet Healthcare Coalition (IHC), a group of private and\nnot-for-profit organizations regulating health care sites and\nservices on the Internet. Thus, there is a need for more stud-\nies on perceived usefulness and trustworthiness of the qual-\nity and quantity of health information that is accessible to the\nyouth, in particular, who are early adopters of new things,\nincluding health information.\nAvailable evidence indicates that access to the Internet is\nincreasing among tertiary institution students in Nigeria\nand South Africa (Oyedemi, 2012); yet, few studies have\nexamined online health seeking patterns among this category\nof young people (Marful & Winter, 2015). In Nigeria, a few\nexceptions of studies with similar focus exist (Ajuwon, 2003;\nies did not focus on the patterns, quality, perceived trustwor-\nthiness, and utilization of online health information in\nmaking health-related decisions.\nHence, this study investigates the use of the Internet\namong undergraduates in a Nigerian University. Particular\nfocus is on the use of the Internet as a source of health infor-\nmation, the type of health information sought, and their per-\nceptions of the quality of online health information. Online\nhealth seeking is becoming widespread among young people\nObasola and Agunbiade 3\nin particular. This may have serious implications for well-\nbeing and health outcomes, especially in social contexts\nwhere health system performance is poor and self-medica-\ntion is common. It is envisaged that this study would be valu-\nable in the development of online health information\ninterventions that may better reach this group, as well as\naddress prevailing health information needs or challenges\namong young people in Nigeria.\nMethod\nWith the use of a cross-sectional research design, the study\nconcentrated on undergraduate students at the University of\nIbadan, the premier university in Nigeria. Cross-sectional\ndesign is useful in investigating online health information\nseeking among students (Nwagwu, 2007). Attention was\npurposively focused on recruiting male and female under-\ngraduates from cognate faculties. These were faculties where\nstudents were exposed to courses with little or inadequate\ninformation on health-related matters. The eight faculties\nwere arts, sciences, law, the social sciences, education, agri-\nculture and forestry, technology, and veterinary medicine\n(see Table 1 for details). The faculties excluded were public\nhealth, pharmacy, clinical sciences, dentistry, and basic med-\nical sciences. Students from these colleges were deemed\nmore knowledgeable about health-related issues than those\nin the other faculties included in this study.\nRecruitment of survey participants involved word of\nmouth and posting of handbills and posters in conspicuous\nlocations and lecture theaters within the eight targeted facul-\nties. The handbills and posters contained information on the\nstudy objectives and contact details of the lead author. Also,\neight field-workers with relevant experience on the social\nsurvey were trained with the research instrument for data\ncollection. The field-workers were undergraduates in the tar-\ngeted faculties, and they informed eligible study participants\nabout the research and the voluntariness of participation.\nThe available statistics on student population showed\nthat there were 11,036 undergraduate students in the eight\nfaculties (University of Ibadan, 2012). With the aim of focus-\ning on undergraduates with limited knowledge of health-\nrelated matters, a nonprobability sampling technique was\nadopted in the selection of 400 respondents. An average of\n50 students was recruited from the eight faculties. The pur-\nposive selection of the respondents helped in targeting a cat-\negoryofrespondentsfromthesamplingframe.Nonprobability\nsampling approaches are compatible with cross-sectional\ndesigns. In similar study populations, such sampling\napproach has produced useful results from studies investigat-\ning health behaviors among undergraduates (Iliyasu,\nGaladanci, Abubakar, Ismail, & Aliyu, 2012; Imaledo, Peter-\nThe data collection period was from January to March\n2014. Voluntary participation of all respondents was sought\nthrough verbal consent and filling of informed consent\nforms. All the students were briefed on nature and purpose\nof the study, and were encouraged to ask questions before\nparticipation. Only those who were willing to participate\nand gave their verbal and written consent were given cop-\nies of the questionnaire. Adequate time was taken to\nexplain to the respondents their right to withdraw from the\nstudy, and that the result of the study had no personal\nimplications.\nData Collection\nThe survey instrument used in eliciting information from\nstudents was anonymous, and it included detailed questions\nabout respondents' demographic characteristics, use of the\nInternet, frequency of use of the platform, type of health\ninformation sought, their assessment of online health infor-\nmation, and decisions taken after accessing health informa-\ntion online. The survey questions were based on evidence\nfrom the literature and cues from previous studies that have\nexamined online health information seeking (Leung, 2008;\nYan, 2010). All the questions were close ended. The respon-\ndents were asked to specify the frequency of use, quality of\nhealth information sourced from the Internet, and the per-\nceived trustworthiness of the information, using a 4-point\nscale with, 1 = unreliable, 2 = fairly reliable, 3 = very reli-\nable, and 4 = accurate.\nTo ascertain the validity of the questionnaire, it was given\nto experts in demography and statistics at the University of\nIbadan to review. Feedbacks from the reviewers were used to\nimprove the draft questionnaire. The questionnaire was also\npretested at another tertiary institution (the Polytechnic of\nIbadan, Oyo State, Nigeria) among 30 students. Based on the\nfindings from the pretest, some questions in the instrument\nwere adjusted to make them easy to complete. Using\nCronbach's alpha, a reliability coefficient was calculated for\nthe questionnaire, and a value of .71 was obtained. A total of\n500 copies of the questionnaire were self-administered.\nHowever, only 400 were found valid for the analysis. This\nrepresents a response rate of 80%.\nTable 1. The Population for the Study.\nFaculties\nUndergraduate\nenrollment\n4 SAGE Open\nData Analysis\nThe quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows\nVersion 17.0. Descriptive statistics, such as frequency counts,\npercentages, mean, and standard deviation, were used to ana-\nlyze the demographic details of the respondents. Using chi-\nsquare, the bivariate analysis was focused on gender\ndifferentials in terms of access to online health information,\nthe frequency of its use, perceived trustworthiness, and deci-\nsions made about online health information.\nEthical Consideration\nVoluntary participation of all respondents was sought through\nverbal consent. All the students were briefed on nature and\npurpose of the study, and were encouraged to ask questions\nbefore participation. Only voluntary respondents who gave\nboth written and verbal consent were given the question-\nnaire. Adequate time was also taken to explain to the respon-\ndents their right to withdraw from the study, and that the\nresult of the study had no personal implications.\nResults\nyears. The average age of the respondents was 21.9 years.\nTable 2 reveals that majority of the students were between\nThe predominant group among the respondents was the\nsecond-year students (31.5%), and the least represented were\nthose in their final year (10.5%). A similar proportion of\nmales (48.8%) and females (57.7%) participated in the study.\nThe frequency of Internet use on a daily basis was on the\naverage (33.7%) when compared with those who access the\nInternet for health-related information on a weekly basis\nThe frequency of the Internet use and volume of data\naccessed per time depend on some factors. These include\nstructural factors, such as access to the computer system at\nschool or at home, availability of high-speed Internet Service\nProviders, and affordability of the available services among\ndifferent social categories of students. With the relatively\nlow frequency of daily Internet access among the respon-\ndents (as shown in Table 2), it was important to observe fur-\nther how sources of access influence the frequency of the\nInternet use within the study population (see Table 3).\nOwnership of a computer system or mobile phone with the\nInternet access is an important determinant of the frequency\nof use and the proportion of the time individuals allocate to\nonline information seeking. Among the respondents, 39.8%\nclaim having accessed the Internet in cybercafes. More than\n50% of the respondents accessed the Internet through a per-\nsonal computer (37%) and mobile phones (16.5%). Access to\nthe Internet through school was low, as only 6.8% (27) used\ntheir school computer laboratory to access the platform.\nTable 4 contains a summary of reported constraints to\nInternet access. A probe into some of the prevailing con-\nstraints to frequent Internet access showed that 42% of the\nrespondents perceived the cost of the Internet access as a\nmajor constraint. This was followed by epileptic power\nFurthermore, with the financial constraints on the Internet\naccess to the respondents, we probed further to understand\nthe implications regarding the volume of data accessible per\ntime. This is important for young people who would like to\nengage in online activities, including seeking health-related\ninformation. As contained in Table 5, more than 50% of the\nrespondents reported a bill of more than 1,000 Naira, an\naverage of US$6.5 to access data plan of about 200 megabits\non a mobile phone or personal computer system. Accessing\nthe Internet at cybercafes and the university's computer labo-\nratory provided the users more volume of data as against per-\nsonal and mobile phones.\nFigure 1 depicts the health information requested by the\nrespondents. The information covered included nutrition, fit-\nness/exercise, HIV/AIDS, malaria, sore throat, mental\nhealth, menstrual pain, and sexual/reproductive health. The\nmost sought among the options mentioned by the respon-\ndents is information about HIV/AIDS. A reasonable propor-\ntion of the respondents also sought information on diet,\nsexual/reproductive health, and mental health.\nThe Internet as a fountain of information also carries the\npossibility of spreading adequate and inadequate health\ninformation. This exposes health information seekers to the\nTable 2. Characteristics of the Respondents (N = 400).\nVariables Frequency %\nAge\nLevel\nGender\nFrequency of Internet use\nObasola and Agunbiade 5\nbenefits and dangers associated with the use of such informa-\ntion. Hence, we assessed respondents' perceptions of the\nquality of online health information accessed. Based on the\nperceived usefulness and trustworthiness of online health\ninformation, about 40% of the respondents considered infor-\nmation sought as quite reliable. A similar proportion also felt\nthat the available information was accurate and dependable.\nAs shown in Table 6, the majority (72.7%) of the respondents\nwho perceived available health information as accurate and\nreliable also had an opportunity to seek similar information\non their health conditions from different online sources. This\nmight have influenced their perception of the information\naccessed. However, from a bivariate analysis, no significant\ndifference was observed between male and female respon-\ndents about the perceived accuracy and dependability of\ninformation sought.\nOnline health information seeking might not end at the\nlevel of knowledge acquisition on a health need or lead to a\ndecision to seek help. As shown in Table 7, a high proportion\n(202) of the respondents in this study claimed that they con-\nsulted an orthodox physician because of the information\naccessed online. Within this category of respondents, just a\nslight variation was observed in the percentage of male\n(48%) to female (52%) who consulted a physician after\naccessing the needed information. Similarly, a fewer propor-\ntion (54) of the respondents claimed consultation with a tra-\nditional healer owing to the information accessed. However,\nthere were those who did not consult a physician or a tradi-\ntional healer but relied on self-medication or asked friends\nfor suggestions.\nDiscussion\nOnline health information seeking is growing wide among\nyouth, especially among those in colleges and other higher\ninstitutions of learning. Access to timely and relevant health\ninformation is essential to develop healthy practices that\ncould improve health outcomes. This makes it necessary to\ninvestigate the sources of access, constraints to access, and\nhealth reasons for seeking online information, trustworthi-\nness, and decisions associated with accessed health\ninformation.\nAccess to the Internet is widespread among the respon-\ndents in this study. This might be associated with the fact that\nall the respondents in this study were university undergradu-\nates. At this level of study and with growing availability of\npersonal computer system and mobile phones with Internet\nfacilities, it is expected that a somewhat high rate of access\nTable 3.

This aligns with findings from previous studies in\nAyanbadejo, Sofola, & Uti, 2008). However, this may not be\nan actual representation of the Internet access among univer-\nsity students in Nigeria. The University of Ibadan, where the\nstudy was conducted, is the premier university and located in\nan urban area of Oyo State, Nigeria. This provides a privi-\nleged position that may be different from other universities\nin Nigeria, especially those located in rural areas or areas\nwhere the level of infrastructure is far below what is obtained\nat the University of Ibadan.\nThere are initiatives to improve Information and\nCommunications Technology in all state-owned tertiary\ninstitutions in Nigeria (Ani, 2010; Apulu, Latham, &\nMoreton, 2011). Quality and affordable Internet access\nremains a challenge for many students in Nigeria (Ani,\n2010). This problem has existed for decades as shown by the\npoor state of infrastructure in Nigerian universities. With the\npossible health implications, it would be encouraging to see\na reduction in access cost and an increase in quality of the\nInternet access. This will also improve the knowledge base\nof Nigerian youth in general. However, as earlier stated, an\nimmediate concern is the poor performance of the health care\nsystem and the porous monitoring of patent medicine ven-\ndors in Nigeria (Osemene & Lamikanra, 2012). The study\nindicated that more students accessed the Internet using per-\nsonal computers, whereas only 16.4% accessed the platform\nvia mobile phones. In addition, more of the study partici-\npants accessed the Internet using cybercafes. This result\naligns with previous studies that have explored the use of the\nInternet among Nigerian students (Ajuwon, 2003; Nwagwu,\n2007). Findings from these studies also revealed that more\nstudents accessed the platform via cybercafes. On the con-\ntrary, Stork et al.'s (2013) results showed increased access to\nthe Internet among young people in African countries via\nmobile phones. With the growing base of mobile telecom-\nmunication subscribers in Nigeria, it is expected that under-\ngraduates in universities located in rural areas may enjoy the\nInternet access as their counterparts in urban areas (Stork\net al., 2013). However, this depends on other factors, such as\nFigure 1. Health reasons for seeking online health information.\nTable 6. Perceived Trustworthiness of Online Health Information.\nGender\nWhat do you think about the trustworthiness of online health\ninformation?\nTotal p value\nUnreliable Fairly reliable Very reliable Accurate\nObasola and Agunbiade 7\nownership of a mobile phone with Internet facilities and abil-\nity to subscribe to an affordable data plan. This is indicated\nin the results as the cost of the Internet access topped the list\nof prevailing constraints to frequent Internet access; as a\nresult, more students accessed the Internet from cybercafes.\nThe frequency of the Internet use affects the quality of time\nspent by online health information seekers on searching and\nverifying information of interest. In this study, the rate of the\nInternet access was somewhat low, as about one third of the\ntotal respondents accessed the Internet on a daily basis. This\ncorroborates earlier studies which reported that cost, poor\nInternet service delivery, and the need to attend to other things\ncould constrain the quality of time and access to the Internet,\nespecially among university students (Ani, 2010). The need\nfor regular physical contacts between the respondents and\ntheir lecturers could also be a hindrance. This is because other\nmediums of facilitating active learning are grossly lacking in\nthe study setting and the larger Nigerian society. With the pres-\nent way of promoting teaching in many Nigerian universities\n(Ani, 2010), there are possibilities that lecture, assignments,\nreading, and other activities might have increased the avail-\nable time for online information search, as much time is\nrequired when accessing a low-speed Internet service. While\nmobile phone access to the Internet was an alternative source\nfor the respondents, fluctuations in services, limited Internet\nfeatures on low-cost mobile phones, and the cost of mobile\nphone subscription may also influence or limit the kind of\nactivities that can be carried out on phones and the possibility\nof balancing lecture time for flexible online health seeking.\nIt is noteworthy that the respondents in this study sought\nonline health information for different health conditions.\nAmong the females, the search for information on menstrual\ndisorder was dominant. This corroborates existing evidence on\nthe increasing prevalence of the disorder among young females\nand the search for help from different sources, including the\nInternet (Guvenc, Kilic, Akyuz, & Ustunsoz, 2012; Nair et al.,\n2012). The situation is similar to other findings in the Nigerian\ncontext (Iliyasu et al., 2012; Nwankwo, Aniebue, & Aniebue,\nthe search for information on sexual/reproductive health is\nunderstandable as the respondents are in their reproductive\nages. The reliance on the Internet for sexual and reproductive\nhealth Information portrays acceptability and the fruitfulness\nthe virtual space may have in addressing the sexual and repro-\nductive health challenges among young people in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. As young people are sexually active, there are chances\nof engaging in risky sexual practices that expose some of them\nto infections that require more information to aid their decision\nto seek help. Access to timely sexual and reproductive health\ninformation is useful in several dimensions. It increases the\nyoung people's participation in protecting and promoting their\nsexual and reproductive health as well as becoming more\ninformed about the consequences of their actions and inactions.\nThe association of sexually transmitted infections with stigma\nmay also be influencing the need for information in a manner\nthat protects the identity of the information seeker. However,\nthere is a need for caution, as the availability of sexual and\nreproductive health information through the Internet does not\nimply a substitute for seeking help from health facilities in the\nevent of any infection. This is necessary especially in social\nsettings where the practices of self-medication and stigma are\nassociated with treating sexually transmitted infections.\nFurthermore, a significant dimension of the findings in\nthis study is the use of information sought in reaching a deci-\nsion. As stated earlier, this represents a level of confidence in\nthe information, which portrays danger, as many of the\nrespondents relied on verification of the information sought\nthrough various online sources, which may not be from pro-\nfessional physicians. From another position, the reliance on\nseveral sources as a form of verification of available infor-\nmation may be useful in empowering the respondents in tak-\ning informed decisions and being active when interacting\nwith their physicians. In the same vein, the possibility of\nacquiring erroneous information can also hamper the quality\nof relations in therapeutic interactions.\nThis article adds to the body of knowledge on online\nhealth information seeking among young people in Nigeria\nby focusing on the perceived dependability of the available\ninformation and the associated implications for help seeking\nfrom both formal and informal sources. The findings have\nimportant implications for health information seeking among\nyoung people in Nigeria. However, there are limitations in\ngeneralizing the results to all youth, including those dwelling\nin urban areas. The young people in this study were univer-\nsity undergraduates who might differ from those outside the\nuniversity or in rural areas. The study is also limited by rely-\ning on quantitative data without generating qualitative infor-\nmation that could have been useful in understanding how\ncontext and health conditions influence the kind of informa-\ntion being accessed and associated health decisions. Despite\nTable 7.

It assessed the possible implications of this prac-\ntice for health practices and outcomes among this group of\nyouth and similar youth in other institutions of higher learn-\ning in the study setting.\nConclusion\nThe Internet access and use remain low among the study par-\nticipants. Compounding the situation are the poor power sup-\nply, the high cost of the Internet access, and poor delivery of\nservices. Existing constraints to the Internet access might\nencourage quick check of health information without giving\nadequate attention to cross-checking or verifying the authen-\nticity of the information from other sources. With the poor\naccess and urge to quickly surf the Internet for health-related\ninformation, the chances are high that inadequate information\nmay be sought. This shortcoming may strengthen further the\npractice of self-medication and delays in prompt health seek-\ning at formal sources. Furthermore, there is a need for practi-\ntioners in the Nigerian health sector to take an active position\nin providing timely and context-relevant information to the\ngrowing need for online health information. This also affords\nthe sector an opportunity to take a lead position in regulating\nand ensuring the availability of health-related information,\nespecially that which is related to locally common health con-\nditions. Such efforts will also complement existing initiatives\naimed at improving active participation of the Nigerian youth\nin promoting and sustaining healthy practices.\nAuthor Contributions\nThe two authors made substantial contributions to the conception\nand design of the study.
