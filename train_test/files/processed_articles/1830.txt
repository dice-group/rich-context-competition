Campbell and Peggy Auinger\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, USA\nBACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a reduction in bone mass sufficient to increase the risk of fracture.\nLead exposure during childhood may be a risk factor for low bone mineral density (BMD). Basic-sci-\nence research demonstrates that lead exposure is associated with a decrease in BMD in animals.\nHowever, human studies are limited.\nOBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a secondary analysis of a national database to explore the\nassociation between lead exposure and osteoporosis in adult humans.\nMETHODS: In this study we used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III). We analyzed subjects who were  50 years of age. A concurrent venous\nblood lead level defined lead exposure. The primary outcome variable was the BMD of the total\nhip. We conducted analyses on four groups: non-Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic white women,\nAfrican-American men, and African-American women. We conducted bivariate analyses between\ncovariates known to be associated with bone density (i.e., age, body mass index, calcium intake,\nethanol/tobacco consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status) and the total hip BMD. The\nsignificant covariates were introduced into analysis of covariance to determine the association\nbetween BMD and blood lead level tercile.\nRESULTS: The adjusted mean total hip BMD among non-Hispanic white males with a blood lead\nlevel in the lowest tercile versus the highest tercile was 0.961 g/cm2 and 0.934 g/cm2, respectively\n(p < 0.05). We also found a similar association among white females, but the difference was mar-\nCONCLUSIONS: We found a significant inverse association between lead exposure and BMD, but\nonly among white subjects. However, because of the cross-sectional design of NHANES, we cannot\nmake inferences about the temporal sequence of this association. With the large number of adults\nwho had lead exposure in the past and the morbidity associated with osteoporosis, further inquiry is\nnecessary on the possible casusal association between lead exposure and osteoporosis in humans.\nKEY WORDS: blood lead levels, bone mineral density, osteoporosis.

BMD\nmeasurements were conducted on all men and\nnonpregnant women  20 years of age who\nunderwent the physical examination.\nStudy sample. In the present investigation\nage who took part in the Household Adult\nQuestionnaire. We defined this cutoff because\nit is the age group in which primary osteo-\nporosis occurs. From this group, subjects were\nexcluded if they did not have a blood lead\nlevel and/or a BMD measurement (n = 2,430)\nor if they had an ethnicity other than non-\nHispanic African American or non-Hispanic\nwhite (n = 1,420). Because few women were\npremenopausal (n = 115), we restricted the\nanalysis to postmenopausal women. The\nremaining 4,689 subjects made up the pri-\nmary sample, which underwent analysis.\nDefinition of lead exposure. We defined\nlead exposure as the blood lead level at the\ntime the subject was interviewed by the\nNHANES survey. Blood was collected by\nvenous phlebotomy and stored in EDTA-\nanticoagulant tubes that were prescreened for\nbackground lead contamination. We per-\nformed duplicate lead analyses on each sam-\nple, and recorded the arithmetic mean of the\nduplicates for each participant. Blood lead\nwas assayed by graphite-furnace atomic\nabsorption spectrophotometry (Gunter et al.\n1996). Blood lead levels below the detection\nlimit were assigned a value of 0.7 \u00b5g/dL.\nDefinition of BMD and clinical outcomes.\nThe primary outcome was the mean BMD of\nthe total hip. BMD measurements were\nobtained using dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-\nHologic, Waltham, MA) in pencil-beam\nmode. A quality control program was used to\nensure data quality (Wahner et al. 1994). The\nsites examined were limited to the hip: the\nfemoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter,\nWard's triangle, and total hip (NCHS 1994).\nWe limited our analyses to the total hip\nbecause the BMD of the hip subregions are\nhighly correlated with the BMD of the total\nTwo clinical outcomes were defined: the\npresence of back pain, and whether the sub-\nject had an osteoporotic-related fracture. The\nvertebrae are the most common bone to be\nfractured due to osteoporosis, often resulting\nin back pain (Krane and Holick 1998). We\ncategorized subjects as having back pain if\nthey responded on the Household Adult\nQuestionnaire as having had lower and/or\nmiddle back pain over the preceding\n12 months. The second clinical measure of\nosteoporosis was based on whether the subject\nhad a fracture due to osteoporosis. Subjects\nwere classified as having had a fracture due to\nosteoporosis if they had a hip, wrist, or verte-\nbral fracture [sites most commonly affected\nby osteoporosis (Krane and Holick 1998)] at\n 50 years of age that occurred because of a\nfall from a standing height or less. Subjects\nwere classified as not having had a fracture\ndue to osteoporosis if they reported never\nhaving had a fracture, having had a fracture at\n< 50 years of age, or having had a fracture at\n 50 years of age caused by a fall farther than\nfrom a standing height, from a car accident or\nother severe trauma.\nDefinition of covariates. In adjusted\nanalysis, we considered several confounders:\nage, race, sex, body mass index (BMI),\nmenopausal status, tobacco use, alcohol use,\nphysical activity, calcium intake, chronic\nmedical conditions, use of certain medica-\ntions, and socioeconomic status.\nRace and sex are strongly associated with\nbone density (Cooper et al. 1992; Nelson et al.\nWe therefore conducted analyses stratified by\nsex and race (i.e., non-Hispanic white men,\nnon-Hispanic white women, African-American\nmen, and African-American women).\nHigher weight is associated with a\ndecreased risk of osteoporosis (CDC 1998;\nmeasure of body mass, we used the BMI,\ndefined as the weight in kilograms divided by\nthe square of the height in meters.\nMenopausal status is strongly associated\nwith bone density (Krane and Holick 1998;\nNash et al. 2004). Because the NHANES data-\nbase does not provide a single variable defining\na woman's menopausal status, we created a\nvariable to categorize women as premenopausal\nor postmenopausal. The following criteria\n(Kalkwarf et al. 2003) were applied sequen-\ntially so that the successive rules were applied\nonly to women not already categorized: a) age\n 60 years, postmenopausal; b) bilateral\noophorectomy, postmenopausal; c) a period or\npregnancy within the previous 12 months, pre-\nmenopausal; d) follicle-stimulating hormone\nlevel > 40 IU/L, postmenopausal; e) current\nuse of oral contraceptive pill, premenopausal;\nfound that few women were premenopausal\n(n = 115). We thus restricted the analysis to\npostmenopausal women; therefore, menopausal\nstatus was not adjusted in the analysis.\nSmoking tobacco is associated with an\nincreased risk of osteoporosis (Seeman et al.\n1983). Subjects were classified into those who\nnever smoked, former smokers, and current\nsmokers.\nAlcohol consumption is associated with\nan increased risk of osteoporosis (Seeman\net al. 1983). Subjects reported the average\nnumber of alcoholic beverages consumed per\nday and the number of days that an alcoholic\nbeverage was consumed over the previous\n12 months. These two terms were multiplied\ntogether and divided by 12 to give a measure\nof the average number of drinks consumed\nper month over the previous year.\nIncreased physical activity is associated\nwith a decreased risk of hip fractures (Cooper\n2001). Subjects were asked about the fre-\nquency at which they conducted 13 physical\nactivities (i.e., walking, jogging, bicycling,\nswimming, doing aerobics, dancing, doing\ncalisthenics, gardening, lifting weights, and\nfour \"other\" categories) over the previous\nmonth. A measure of monthly physical activ-\nity was defined by summing the number of\ntimes that each of 13 physical activities was\nperformed. Although this is a measure of cur-\nrent physical activity, studies report that cur-\nrent physical activity is correlated to physical\nactivity over a person's lifetime (Hirvensalo\nIncreased calcium intake is associated with\nincreased bone density (Johnston et al. 1992;\nTurner et al. 1998). Subjects were asked about\npast intake of milk. Subjects specified the fre-\nquency of milk consumption (never, less than\nonce per week, once per week, less than once\nper day but more than once per week, once\nper day, more than once per day) for each of\nintake, we calculated a measure of milk con-\nsumption during bone anabolism--from\nchildhood until roughly the mid-thirties. We\nassigned each frequency of milk consumed\nduring an age stratum (never, less than once\nper week, once per week, less than once per\nday but more than once per week, once per\nday, more than once per day) an ordinal value\n(respectively, 0\u00ad5). We calculated the propor-\ntion of years an age stratum made up the 5- to\nyear age span). We multiplied the ordinal\nvalue representing the frequency of milk con-\nsumption during an age stratum by the pro-\nportion of years the corresponding age stratum\nmade up the 5- to 35-year age span. Three age\n18\u00ad35 years). Each of the three resulting terms\nwere added to achieve a weighted estimate of\nweekly milk consumption between 5 and\nMedications may also affect bone density.\nWe identified whether the subject reported\ntaking medications that adversely affect bone\ndensity (i.e., anticonvulsants, calcitonin,\ncyclosporine, cytotoxic drugs, estrogens, gluco-\ncorticoids, progesterones). This outcome was\ndefined dichotomously (i.e., currently using or\nnot using medications that affect bone den-\nsity). We also defined a second measure based\non whether the female subjects had even been\non any kind of estrogen replacement therapy.\nThe presence of certain chronic medical\nconditions--such as thyroid disease--is\nLead exposure and osteoporosis in adults--NHANES III\nknown to cause changes in bone density. We\nidentified whether a physician had ever told\nthe subject that she or he had thyroid disease.\nThis outcome was defined dichotomously.\nOther chronic medical conditions (i.e.,\narthritis, heart failure, stroke, bronchitis,\nemphysema, gout, and cancers) were not\ncontrolled using this measure because they\nwould affect BMD via altered levels of physi-\ncal activity and/or use of medications. These\nlatter two variables are already included in\nthe regression model.\nWe used educational level as a proxy of\nsocioeconomic status. Other measures of\nsocioeconomic status, such as poverty index\nratio, had many missing values and were never-\ntheless moderately correlated to educational\nAnalyses. We analyzed the association\nbetween current blood lead level and total hip\nBMD among four groups: non-Hispanic white\nmen, non-Hispanic white women, African-\nAmerican men, and African-American women.\nTo identify covariates for adjusted analysis, we\nconducted bivariate analysis (for each afore-\nmentioned age- and sex-defined group)\nbetween the variables described above and the\ntotal hip BMD. For continuous covariates, we\ncalculated Pearson correlation coefficients and\nthe corresponding two-tailed p-value. For\ncategorical covariates, we used the t-test to\ncompare mean BMD and calculated the corre-\nsponding two-tailed p-value. Covariates found\nto be sizable (i.e., p  0.20) were analyzed in a\ncorrelation matrix to assess for collinearity; we\nfound that within each sex- and race-defined\ngroup, no covariates were multicollinear (i.e.,\ncorrelation coefficient > 0.50) with each other.\nWe decided a priori to introduce age and BMI\nas covariates into all adjusted analyses for each\nof the four sex- and race-defined groups. In\naddition, we identified the following additional\ncovariates as significant: for non-Hispanic\nwhite males, education level; for African-\nAmerican males, education level, presence of\nchronic medical condition, and calcium intake;\nfor non-Hispanic white females, education\nlevel and use of estrogen replacement; for\nAfrican-American females, education level, use\nof estrogen replacement, and calcium intake.\nThe significant covariates were introduced\ninto analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to\ndetermine the independent association\nbetween BMD of the total hip and blood lead\nlevel tercile. We assessed each model for\nassumptions required by ANCOVA (Leech\net al. 2005). We found, for each age- and sex-\ndefined group, that BMD was normally dis-\ntributed within each blood lead level tercile;\nfurther, there was homogeneity of variance of\nthe BMD between each blood lead level ter-\ncile. To achieve the assumption of homogene-\nity of regression slopes of the continuous\ncovariates for each blood lead level tercile, we\nlog-transformed BMI in the analysis of the\nnon-Hispanic white males; no transforma-\ntions were required for the remaining age-\nand sex-defined groups. Finally, to account\nfor the assumption that observations must be\nindependent, we used SUDAAN software to\nadjust for the multistage, nonrandom sam-\npling design of the survey (Shah et al. 1991).\nIn the unadjusted analysis of the clinical\noutcomes, for each of the four sex- and race-\ndefined groups, we calculated the proportion\nof subjects with lower back pain and with frac-\ntures due to osteoporosis as a function of blood\nlead level tercile. We noted that the differences\nin BMD between blood lead level terciles\ndiminished in adjusted analyses. Because of\nthis, and because the comparisons of the pro-\nportions of the unadjusted clinical outcomes\nwere small and not significant, we did not con-\nduct adjusted analysis of the clinical outcomes.\nResults\nThe demographic data of the four race- and\nsex-defined groups are presented in Table 1.\nThe adjusted analyses revealed a significant\ninverse association between lead exposure and\nBMD among the non-Hispanic white male\nsubjects (Table 2). The adjusted mean total\nhip BMD among non-Hispanic white males\nwith a blood lead level in the lowest versus the\nmarginal significance was discerned among\nnon-Hispanic white females. The adjusted\nmean total hip BMD among non-Hispanic\nwhite females with a blood lead level in the\nlowest versus the highest tercile was 0.789\nassociation was discerned among African-\nAmerican subjects. In addition, we found that\nnone of the comparisons of the clinical out-\ncomes (i.e., prevalence of back pain, osteo-\nporotic fractures) by blood lead level tercile\nwere significant.\nDiscussion\nOur study found a significant inverse associa-\ntion between lead exposure and BMD, but\nonly among white subjects (Table 2).

This lack of significance may be\nattributed to a considerably smaller sample size\nof the African-American subjects than the\nwhite subjects.\nNo association was found between blood\nlead level tercile and clinical outcomes. A pos-\nsible explanation may be the relatively small\ndifference in BMD between blood lead tercile.\nClinical trials of bisphosphanates that found\ndifferences in clinical outcomes such as frac-\nture rates reported corresponding differences\nnon-Hispanic white subjects in our study, the\ndifference in BMD between the low tercile\nand high tercile was about 2\u00ad3%. This differ-\nence in BMD may be too small to discern a\nsignificant difference in clinical outcomes.\nAnother possible reason for a lack of an associ-\nation is that neither clinical outcome may be\nvalid as a measure of osteoporotic fractures.\nNot all osteoporotic vertebral fractures cause\npain. Conversely, it is possible other causes of\nback pain obscured the pain due to osteopor-\ntic vertebral fractures.\nIt is possible that our findings of an\ninverse association between lead exposure and\nBMD is spurious because of inadequately\ncontrolled covariates. For example, the meas-\nure of calcium intake required a subject to\nrecall the quantity of milk consumed during\ntheir youth. However, if their recall was not\nreliable, the use of this measure in adjusted\nanalysis could lead to inadequate control of a\npotential confounder. In another example, we\ncontrolled for the use of current medications.\nHowever, because current medication use\nmay not reliably measure effects of past med-\nication use, its use in adjusted analysis could\nagain lead to inadequate control of a potential\nconfounder.\nA limitation of this study is the cross-sec-\ntional design of the NHANES database.\nAlthough we found a significant inverse\nassociation, it is unclear whether past lead\nexposure caused a lower BMD, or whether an\nelevated blood lead level is a result of a lower\nBMD. In other words, it is possible that\nincreased bone turnover produced an increase\nin blood lead from the endogenous release of\nlead from the bone. Using stable lead isotope\nfingerprinting methods, Gulson et al. (1998,\n2002) found that lead can be mobilized from\nthe skeleton into the blood. This issue has\nbeen raised in the literature. Nash et al.\ninverse association between BMD and blood\nlead level among perimenopausal and post-\nmenopausal women, and concluded that lead\nstored in bone may significantly increase\nblood lead levels. However, because of the\ncross-sectional design of NHANES, they\nacknowledged not being able make inferences\nabout the temporal sequence of this associa-\ntion. The same is certainly true of our study.\nDespite the previous limitation, it is possi-\nble the association found in this study reflects\nlead as causative in the development of osteo-\nporosis. In vitro studies show that lead\nadversely affects growth plate chondrocytes by\naltering cell phenotype and function (Hicks\net al. 1996).

(1997) found that lead-\nexposed rats (mean blood lead level 21 \u00b5g/dL)\nhad lower DEXA-based BMD than controls.\nOther researchers have also shown that lead\nexposure decreases BMD or bone strength in\ninhibits fracture healing in mice (Carmouche\nAs described in the introduction, a high\nproportion of adult Americans may currently\nhave elevated bone lead levels. With this large\nnumber of lead-exposed adults, and the mor-\nbidity associated with osteoporosis, it is\nimportant to investigate further whether a\ncausative association exists between lead expo-\nsure and osteoporosis in humans.\nREFERENCES\nAlfv\u00e9n T, J\u00e4rup L, Elinder C-G. 2002.
