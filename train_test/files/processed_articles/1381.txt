Simon\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Health, Los Angeles,\nIntroduction\nRegular mammography use in the United States involves\nrepeated interactions by women with health care providers.\nThese interactions are mediated by health care markets\nwithin the broader social and economic environment. Even\nthough these interactions take place in specific geographic\nlocations in a particular social and economic environment,\nresearch has not adequately explored how specific geo-\ngraphic, social and economic environments influence\nmammography use.\nAn extensive body of research elucidating the determi-\nnants of mammography use has largely focused on corre-\nlates associated with adherence to recommended screening\nintervals that can be measured by self-report [1\u00ad3]. These\ninclude sociodemographic characteristics such as income,\neducation, and age [4\u00ad6]; psychosocial influences such as\nculture, risk perception, and social support [7\u00ad11]; and\nhealth care access determinants such as provider recom-\nmendation and health insurance status [12, 13].\nIn this study, we used a multi-level spatial analysis to\ninvestigate howplace ofresidence,densityorproximitytoone\nor more mammography facilities, and other community level\nvariables can help us better understand patterns of mam-\nmography use in Los Angeles County. An earlier multi-level\nanalysis by Gumpertz et al. found that the higher proportion of\nLatinasdiagnosed withlate stage breastcancercomparedwith\nnon-Latina Whites in Los Angeles County could be explained\nby differences in tumor biology, sociodemographic and\nneighborhood characteristics, and distance to the nearest\nmammography facility [14]. Other investigations have shown\nthat place of residence influences health outcomes [15, 16],\nincluding stage of cancer diagnosis [17].\nIn recent years, multi-level analytic methods have been\nemployed to simultaneously distinguish the effects of area-\nlevel and individual-level factors on a range of health\nhave found associations between contextual variables and\nhealth outcomes above and beyond individual characteris-\ntics [21\u00ad23]. Because contextual and individual factors\ninteract with one another [24], addressing the interplay of\nthese factors, rather than focusing exclusively on a single\nfactor, can enhance efforts to promote mammography. In\nthis paper, we examine a range of multi-level factors that\nmay influence mammography in Los Angeles County.\nMethods\nConceptual framework and data sources\nTo conceptualize on-schedule mammography screening,\nwe adapted a multi-level systems framework that integrates\nindividual, practice, and community variables [25]. The\nthree levels of our framework are: (A) Practice setting/\nindividual level which includes (1) individual patient\ncharacteristics, (2) clinician or provider team characteris-\ntics, and (3) encounters between doctor and patient; (B)\nPlan or medical group level which includes policies that\ncan affect delivery of services, such as accepting patients\nwithout health insurance, and (C) Social and economic\ncontext/community level which includes factors that\nimpact access and availability of mammography, such as\nthe density of facilities or community poverty level.\nWe linked five data sets to test our systems framework.\nOur systems framework and geographic nesting structure is\nshown in Figure 1. The five nested data sets correspond to\nthe three levels in our framework: the practice setting/\nindividual level, the plan level, and the social and eco-\nnomic context or community level. In order to determine\nthe most appropriate geographic aggregation for each data\nset, we tested three geographic units: the Census Tract,\nHealth District (HD), and Service Planning Area (SPA).\nThese latter two geographic units are specific to Los\nAngeles County and were developed for purposes of health\nand social service planning and service distribution. The 26\nHDs and 8 SPAs reflect the health care needs of local\ncommunities in LA County.\nIndividual-level data were obtained from the California\nHealth Interview Survey (CHIS). CHIS, conducted every\n2 years, is a random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone survey of\nadults, adolescents, and children from all California\ncounties. The first survey, conducted in 2001 in five lan-\nguages, collected information from more than 55,000\nhouseholds statewide. CHIS is the largest state health\nsurvey, one of the largest health surveys in the United\nStates, and one of the few to report county and community\nlevel information. By providing information on many racial\nand ethnic groups and local-level information, CHIS gives\nhealth planners, policy makers, county governments,\nadvocacy groups, and communities a detailed picture of the\nhealth and health care needs facing California's diverse\npopulation. The CHIS conducts multi-language interviews\nto accommodate the state's large immigrant population.\nGeocoding provides the opportunity to link CHIS to other\ndata and to perform spatial analysis. Los Angeles was the\nonly county fully geocoded in 2001 CHIS.\nOur study sample includes women in Los Angeles\nCHIS. Geocoding to latitude/longitude was successful for\napproximately 70% of the respondents based on the nearest\nstreet intersection to their residence, information they\nprovided in the interview. Remaining respondents were\ngeocoded to ZIP Code centroids. All geocoding was done\nusing ESRI's ArcMap software, supplemented by manual\nlookup. Twenty respondents had neither a complete\nFig. 1 Combined conceptual\nframework and geographic\nnesting structure of data\naddress nor ZIP Code information and were deleted. The\nlinked to the other data sets. All variables tested, regardless\nof whether we included them in our final models, are\nshown in the complete variable list in Table 1. Only the\nvariables included in the logistic regression model are\npresented in Table 2, which also shows the distribution of\nindividual-level CHIS respondent sample characteristics.\nIn the paragraphs below, we describe the data sets used\nto measure each level of our conceptual framework, the\nvariables we considered, and the variables included in the\nbest fitting statistical models.\nPractice setting/individual level: The practice setting\nis measured as a relationship between the patient and the\nclinician or team of clinicians. Different practice settings\nare associated in the literature with different screening\npractices [25\u00ad32]. 1. Patient characteristics: women\nsampled in the 2001 California Health Interview Survey\n(CHIS) aged 40\u00ad84 from Los Angeles County were used to\nestimate on-schedule mammography by patient sociode-\nmographics. All geographic data are linked to this sample\nof women. We examined information on race/ethnicity,\nage, education, income, marital status, and English lan-\nguage proficiency as well as indicators of health and health\ncare access. 2. Clinician/team characteristics: to measure\npractice and personal characteristics of clinicians, we used\nthe 2001 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician's\nSurvey. The CTS includes sixty sites nationally (51\nmetropolitan areas and 9 nonmetropolitan areas) that were\nrandomly selected to form the core of the survey and to be\nrepresentative of the nation.\nLos Angeles County was randomly selected as one site\nand is used in the present analysis. The CTS Physician\nsurvey data were sampled at the ZIP Code level and\nincludes responses from 220 clinicians. The physician\nsample did not have adequate power at the Zip Code level\nso responses were aggregated to the SPA level using a\ncrosswalk file. Only aggregate CTS Physician Survey data\nat the SPA level were large enough to have adequate sta-\ntistical power. We linked the SPA CTS physician data to\nCHIS respondent data. See Table 1 (total variable list) for\nthe list of provider variables that we considered.\n3. Encounters/interactions between doctor and\npatients: Similar to those of patients, the sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics of individual clinicians and medical\ngroups as well as the medical plan structure within which\nthey work, may facilitate or impede regular screening. We\ncreated two indices from the CTS data to characterize\ndoctor and patient interactions: ability to provide quality\ncare to patients and ease of quality referrals.\nPlan or medical group level: As outlined earlier, the\nCTS physician survey data were tested for factors that\ncould influence mammography use in a given geographic\narea. These included the clinician or team characteristics,\nthe reported interactions of providers with patients at the\nplan or medical group level and the percentage of medical\npractice revenue obtained from various types of reim-\nbursement. The percentage of practices that did not accept\nMediCAL (California's Medicaid program) was used as an\nindicator of access to care for low-income women at the\nplan or medical group level.\nSocial and economic context/community level: We\nused data on location of mammography facility, bus and\nrail stop locations, and neighborhood sociodemographic\ncharacteristics to measure the social and economic context\nat the community levels. These measures were obtained\nfrom the FDA Certified Mammography Facility Address\ndata base [33], the LA County Metro Transit Authority\nRoute and Stop database [34], and the US Census for\nCensus tracts [35] and were linked to the individual-level\nCHIS respondent data to examine their association with\naccess to on-schedule mammography screening.\nMeasuring geographic access\nA measure of special interest to us was geographic access\nto mammography. Precise address information for FDA\ncertified mammography facilities from 2001 was used to\ncreate two measures potentially associated with access to\nmammography screening by using a geographic informa-\ntion system (GIS). The first measure is the Euclidean, or\nstraight-line distance from the respondent's address (or Zip\nCode centroid) to the nearest facility. For the second, we\ncreated an alternative measure that indicates the density of\nfacilities within a limited circular buffer immediately sur-\nrounding the respondent's address. These methods of\naggregation have been previously referred to as ``person-\ncentered'' because the respondents' address determines the\ncenter of the buffer and the density of facilities surrounding\na respondent's residence [36].\nMeasuring the distance to the facility nearest to a\nrespondent's address provides an estimate of the closest\nfacility while density measures the number of facilities\nwithin a designated geographic area. The density of facil-\nities surrounding a respondent's residence also represents\ngreater choice of facilities. Because distance and density\nare conceptually different aspects of potential access and\nmay yield different results, we examined both measures.\nTo decide which measure to use, we first calculated\nmile buffers immediately surrounding a woman's place of\nresidence. We then computed the number of FDA certified\nmammography facilities within each buffer. Statistical\nmodeling was used to determine the single most appro-\npriate buffer distance because overlapping buffers were\ncollinear. After trying a priori distance cutoffs for each\nTable 1 Total variable list prior to statistical selection coded to data\nsources and conceptual framework Los Angeles county women aged\n40\u00ad84 who received a mammogram within past 2 years\n(A) Practice setting/individual level\n(1) Patient characteristics\n(Data source: California Health Interview Survey 2001)\nSociodemographics\nRace/ethnicity\nLatina\nBlack\nAsian/Pacific Islander\nOther\nWhite\nAge\nEducation\n\\High school\nHigh school graduate or GED\nSome college/technical school\nCollege or more\nHousehold income--midpoint categories\nMarital status\nMarried or living with partner\nDivorced, separated, widowed, never married\nEnglish proficiency\nNot at all/not very well\nVery well/English only\n*Household income (squared term)\n*Employed (yes, no)\n*Citizen (yes, no)\nHealth and health care access\nHistory of breast cancer\nNo\nYes\nTable 1 continued\nSelf-rated health\nPoor/fair\nGood\nVery good/excellent\nUsual source of care\nNo\nYes\nInsurance status\nNo\nYes\n*Food insecure (yes, no)\nInteractions\nAge 9 English proficiency\nAge 9 usual source of care\n*Age 9 BMI\n*Age 9 history of breast cancer\n*Age 9 citizenship\n*BMI 9 history of breast cancer\nOutcome\nMammogram within past 2 years\n(2) Clinician/team characteristics\n(Data source: community tracking study/physician's survey-2001)\n*% Board certified\n*% Primary care provider\n*% Solo practitioner\n*% Years from medical school graduation\n(3) Encounters/interactions between doctors and patients\n(Data source: community tracking study/physician's survey-2001)\n(Two indices)\n*Quality care (adequate time with patients; possible to provide high\nquality care; ability to maintain relationships w/patients)\n*Ease of referral (ability to refer to high quality specialists; to\nancillary services; to high quality diagnostic imagining)\n(B) Plan level (medical group)\n(Data source: community tracking study/physician's survey-2001)\n*% Practices accept no MediCal\n(C) Social and economic context/community level\nPerson-centered access variables\n(Data source: FDA certified mammography facility data-2001)\nNearest mammography facility (Euclidean)\nNumber of FDA mammography facilities within 2 miles of\nrespondent\n*Number of FDA mammography facilities/per health district\n*Number of FDA mammography facilities/per 1,000 people (health\ndistrict)\nbuffer density variable, we selected the model with the 2-\nmile buffer of mammography facility density because it\nhad the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [37],\nindicating the best statistical fit.\nLos Angeles County Metro Transit Authority (LAMTA)\nbus route and rail line stop data were computed as the\ncombination of all routes and individual stops for each\ntransit location per day. Bus and rail data from 2003 were\nmanipulated similar to the person-centered density variable\nfor mammography facilities described earlier. A 3-mile\nbuffer distance was selected for inclusion in the model\nusing the lowest AIC.\nWe tested aggregate information on demographic and\nsocioeconomic data from the 2000 US Decennial Census\n(Sample File 3) at each geographic unit described earlier:\nthe Census Tract, HD, and SPA. Based on the distribution\nof CHIS respondents in each geographic area and the sta-\ntistical selection criteria outline below, we aggregated\nCensus information to the HD level. A detailed list of these\nvariables is included in Table 1.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used a combination of theoretical and statistical pro-\ncedures to select and specify variables for our models from\nthe list of variables shown in Table 1. Several covariates\nconsidered for inclusion on theoretical grounds were\ndeleted due to collinearity. For the remaining continuous\ncovariates, we determined appropriate transformations\nusing logit plots. If the association between mammography\nuse (as measured by the logit, ln(p/(1 ? p)), where p is the\nprobability of mammography use) and a covariate was\nlinear then the covariate was included in the model as a\ncontinuous variable. If a simple transformation such as the\nsquare root of a covariate did not achieve linearity, then the\ncovariate was categorized. Income (in thousands of dol-\nlars), age, and body mass index (BMI) were categorized.\nTask Force (USPSTFS) and Medicare eligibility guidelines\nto determine appropriate categorizations for age. BMI was\ngrouped into three conventional categories: underweight\n(25.0?). The density of FDA certified mammography\nfacilities within 2 miles of each respondent's home was\nlarly, public transit stops within 3 miles of each respondent\nSingle-variable logistic models were used to select the\n2- and 3-mile density measures for mammography facili-\nties and public transportation respectively. As described\nearlier, ZIP Code, Census tract, HD, and SPA levels were\nexamined to determine the most appropriate level of\naggregation and each was tested in separate models; only\nSPA covariates were used in our final models.\nAll possible two-way interactions of the main effects were\ntested for significance at the a = 0.0001 level using a fixed\neffects logistic forward stepwise selection procedure [38].\nThis criterion is more stringent than the usual a = 0.05 level\nin order to adjust for multiple comparisons [39].\nOur final analysis used a logistic generalized linear\nmixed effects model [40]. Additional variance components\nwere included to account for overdispersion and spatial\nautocorrelation. Our final four models were chosen after\ncomparing the AIC statistic [37] and goodness of fit, as\ndetermined by residual analysis and by the Hosmer-Lem-\neshow statistic [41]. A three-way interaction of Hispanic\nethnicity, age, and usual source of care was added to\nimprove model fit, as suggested by the residual analysis.\nSeparate models were used to test the importance of the\npractice setting and social context covariates.\nResults\nOnly the variables that met the theoretical and statistical\ncriteria described earlier and that were selected for the\nlogistic generalized linear mixed effects model are dis-\ncussed, and only statistically significant results are repor-\nted. We present our results organized by the levels of\nanalysis in our conceptual model.\nTable 1 continued\n(Data source: Los Angeles public transportation data-2003)\n*Number of public transportation stops within 3 miles of respondent\n*Number of public transportation stops/per health district\n*Number of public transportation stops/per 1,000 people (health\ndistrict)\nAggregate US census tract variables\n(Data source: United States decennial census-2000)\n*% Female headed household\n*% Female population 40?\n*% Foreign born\n*% Owner occupied housing\n*% Below poverty\n*% Use public transportation to/from Work\n*% Spanish linguistically isolated\n*Population density (squared term)\n* Variables stepped out of the models based on statistical criteria\ndescribed in text\nPractice setting/individual level.\n1.

Four models are\npresented. The first tests individual-level variables. The\nsecond model also includes individual-level interactions.\nThe third model adds variables that describe clinician/team\ncharacteristics, encounters between patients and providers\nand plan-level characteristics. The fourth model adds social\ncontext and community level variables. These include\nmeasures of density of mammography facilities and bus\nstops. None of the clinician/team characteristics proved\nsignificant so they were left out of the fourth model.\nIndividual characteristics examined in Model 1 were\nbased on findings from previous literature on mammogra-\nphy [42\u00ad46]. In Model 1, women who reported their race as\nAsian/Pacific Islander were less likely to report having a\nmammogram within the previous 2 years (OR = 0.61)\ncompared with other women. The small proportion of\nwomen grouped into ``other'' race also was less likely to be\non-schedule for breast cancer screening (OR = 0.67).\nWomen 40\u00ad49 years of age were less likely to report\nhaving a mammogram within the past 2 years (OR = 0.51)\ncompared with women 65\u00ad84 years of age.

Of the odds ratios shown in Table 3 for\nthese combinations of individual characteristics, the pattern\namong women ages 50\u00ad64 is unusual. Women in this age\ngroup who had a usual source of health care and had\nlimited English proficiency (predominantly Latina) were\nsignificantly more likely (OR = 1.85) to have a recent\nmammogram than English-proficient women of the same\nage who had a usual source of care.\n2.

Encounters/interactions between doctors and patients\nNone of the variables that represent clinician/team\ncharacteristics and encounters/interactions within the\npractice setting were significant in our results (Model 3 in\nPlan or medical group level\nAdditionally, the plan or medical group level was not\nsignificant in our results (Model 3 in Table 3).\nSocial and economic context/community level\nModel 4, which includes person-centered access vari-\nables of mammography and transportation density, was the\nbest model as indicated by the smaller AIC statistic.

It may also mean that there is little differ-\nence between having 2\u00ad10 facilities nearby. Density of\npublic transportation stops within 3 miles of a respondent's\nresidence was not associated with mammography use.\nDiscussion\nOur study examined area-level and individual-level effects\non mammography use for women in Los Angeles County.\nGumpertz et al. had found that a longer distance from the\npopulation center of the census tract to the nearest mam-\nmography facility predicted more advanced disease for\nLatina and White women after controlling for other\nimportant factors [14]. This led us to hypothesize that a\nlack of nearby mammography facilities would lead to less\nmammography use, which in turn would lead to a later-\nstage diagnosis of breast cancer. Consistent with this\nhypothesis, we found an increased use of mammography\nwhen many facilities were nearby. At the same time, our\nstudy confirmed the significance of individual characteris-\ntics found to be important predictors of mammography use\nOur most striking and unexpected findings were\nrevealed by the interactions. Not surprisingly, women aged\n40\u00ad49 were less likely to have had a mammogram than\nwomen aged 50\u00ad64--an age group for which mammog-\nraphy is recommended by evidence-based guidelines in the\nUnited States [47]. For women under 65 not covered by\nMedicare, lack of usual source of care is usually strongly\nassociated with lower mammography rates. However,\namong the 50\u00ad64 years old group who had a usual source\nof health care in Los Angeles, we found that women with\nlimited or no English proficiency were more likely than\nEnglish-proficient women to obtain a mammogram. These\nunexpected findings were consistent across all the models.\nTo help explain this finding, we examined data on\n2001 by their race-ethnicity from the Cancer Detection\nSection (CDS) of the California Department of Health\nServices. Comparing the percent of eligible women who\nactually used the program to those eligible, we found\nproportional underrepresentation among whites (18% eli-\ngible and 7% users of program) and blacks (9% eligible\nand 3% users); and overrepresentation among Latinas (64%\neligible and 70% users) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (API)\n(9 percent eligible and 11 percent users). Further investi-\ngation showed that the Every Women Counts Program\n(EWC), directed by a community-based organization in\nLos Angeles County, had conducted outreach between\nEWC program, co-funded by the CDC BCCEDP and\nCalifornia state, provides subsidized breast and cervical\ncancer screening services to low income underinsured\nresidents. The program's education and outreach to Span-\nish-speaking Latinas comprised a number of different\nstrategies including an ``over 50 task force'' and a\n``grandmother's campaign'' with community participation\non task forces and committees (Brian Montano, personal\ncommunication, 1 May 2008).The program sponsored a\nMother's Day campaign in which providers were given\nreminder cards to use with their patients. Providers were\nencouraged to emphasize the importance of screening and\nre-screening to community members. The program also\nhelped providers participating in the EWC Program\ndevelop manual and computerized tracking systems to\nnotify women that they were due for screening (Patricia\nThis reliance on health care providers to encourage women\nto be screened, with a particular emphasis on Latinas over\nage 50, is probably why English fluency, age, and usual\nsource of care significantly interacted to predict mam-\nmography use in our models.\nOur results suggest that this campaign succeeded in\nreaching communities in need. The communities targeted\nin the outreach campaigns were the same ones that Gum-\npertz reported were disproportionately impacted by late\nstage breast cancer. Previous literature has shown that\norganized communities and social networks can effectively\npromote use of services, including cancer screening [48,\n49]. Our findings for LA County in the context of the\ncommunity-based outreach program to promote mam-\nmography among Latinas confirmed this.\nOuranalysisconfirmedlowuse ofmammographybyAsian\nwomen, women 40\u00ad49 and lower-income women in Los\nAngeles [50, 51]. We confirmed greater use by women in the\nbreast cancer, and those with a usual source of care and health\ninsurance coverage. Previous findings have shown these\nindividual variables are correlated with recent mammography\nuse both for the nation and for Los Angeles [52, 53].\nOur study is the first to show an association between use\nof mammography and density of mammography facilities\nwithin 2 miles of a woman's residence. We also examined\nan alternative measure, distance of mammography facili-\nties in relation to a respondent's residence. This is the\nmeasure used in the Gumpertz et al. article; however, odds\nratios using this measure were small and not statistically\nsignificant (data not shown) so we used the mammography\ndensity measure instead.\nOur study benefitted from having an address for each\nwoman and for each mammography facility, from which\nmore precise locations and associations could be measured\n[54]. Most previous studies, including that of Gumpertz\net al. have assigned respondents to aggregated geographic\nunits, such as Census tracts, counties, or zip codes. Krieger\net al. have shown that it is important to compare socio-\neconomic status using small geographic units such as tracts\nin order to identify health inequalities [55].\nThe above finding suggests that a woman's proximity\nto the closest facility may not be as important as living in\nan area with a greater density of facilities. As indicated in\nthe methods section, the density variable potentially\ncaptures more aspects of access than the proximity vari-\nable and may explain why only the density variable is\nassociated with mammography use. Another possible\nexplanation is that using the exact location of residence as\nwe did in our study is a more accurate measure compared\nwith using a Census tract centroid in the calculation of\nproximity, the address surrogate used in the Gumpertz\nstudy. Our finding that density of mammography facilities\nis an important determinant of mammography use sug-\ngests that examining the supply of mammography facili-\nties, including capacity, location and staffing, needs\nadditional study.\nLimitations\nThe geocoded location of each woman was based on her\nreported nearest street intersection, not her exact address.\nThe geocoding process has been shown to introduce some\npositional inaccuracies, but resulting locations are gener-\nally within 100 m of the true location [56]. Because most\nof LA County is very urban, we expect that most of the\ngeocoded locations are very close to the actual residence.\nHowever, location of workplace was not available from the\nCHIS survey. It is likely that some women who work\nwould find it convenient to have their mammograms at\nfacilities close to their workplace, especially if there were\nfew facilities available near their home.\nTransit data throughout LA County were incomplete\nbecause data on rail lines run by Municipal Operators and\nFoothill Transit in LA County were not available. How-\never, the Metro Transit Authority (MTA) estimates that\nthese rail lines would add only 15% more rail stops to the\npresent analysis (Dr. Jesse Simmon, personal communi-\nThe distribution of data was not adequate at all levels\nof geography. This limited our ability to test some vari-\nables. Though we do not know exactly how this limitation\naffected our analysis, it is likely that the sample of phy-\nsician practice characteristics was too small to provide\nadequate power to detect differences in Los Angeles. In\naddition, CHIS data are self-reported and previous anal-\nyses have shown that mammography may be over-repor-\nted in surveys, particularly among racial/ethnic groups\nConclusions\nWomen with limited English proficiency were especially\nlikely to report recent mammography in Los Angeles. This\nunexpected finding suggests that the intensive Spanish-\nlanguage outreach program conducted by the EWC Pro-\ngram in low-income Latina communities in Los Angeles\nwas effective. Our spatial analysis of mammography use in\nLos Angeles was inspired by Gumpertz et al. who found\nthat Latinas in Los Angeles County were diagnosed with\nand that distance from the population center of the Census\ntract to the nearest mammography facility was a significant\npredictor of advanced disease. Our study highlights the\nsuccess of the targeted community-based outreach con-\npopulations that Gumpertz et al. identified as needing\nintervention. It would be useful to conduct another study of\nlate-stage diagnosis in Los Angeles County to ascertain\nwhether increased rates of mammography also led to less\nlate-stage diagnosis among Latinas in the neighborhoods\nwhere they are concentrated in Los Angeles.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which per-\nmits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any\nmedium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nReferences\n1.
