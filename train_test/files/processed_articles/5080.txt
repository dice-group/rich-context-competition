This study consisted of a qualitative\n(cognitive interviews) and a quantitative (test\u00adretest reliability) component. Chinese versions of the measures were pilot-\ntested on 20 parents of Hong Kong preschool-aged children using cognitive interviews. Measures were then administered\nto 61 parents twice, 1 week apart. Test\u00adretest reliability and internal consistency were computed. Except for two items, the\ntest\u00adretest reliability of items and scale summary scores ranged from moderate to excellent. The internal consistency of the\nmeasures exceeded recommended minimal values (Cronbach's  > .70). The parent-report measures examined in this study\nare potentially appropriate for use in investigations of environmental correlates of the physical activity of Chinese preschool-\naged children living in densely populated urban environments. However, their predictive validity with respect to Chinese\npreschool-aged children's physical activity needs to be assessed in future studies.\n",

Yet, epidemiological studies\nindicate that many preschool-aged children fail to meet the rec-\nommended PA levels (Hinkley, Salmon, Okely, Crawford, &\nHesketh, 2012b). Insufficient levels of PA have been found in\nWestern as well as Eastern countries (Hinkley et al., 2012b).\nFor example, only 16% of Hong Kong preschoolers have been\nreported to engage in adequate amounts of PA when excluding\npreschool physical education classes (Department of Health,\nHong Kong SAR, 2009). It is, thus, important to identify modi-\nfiable factors that promote PA in early childhood (Hinkley,\nSalmon, Okely, Crawford, & Hesketh, 2012a).\nSocial-ecologic models describe children's PA as develop-\ning within an ecological niche with the immediate home and\nneighborhood environments playing a major role in this pro-\ncess through the provision of opportunities or creation of barri-\ners for engagement in PA (Sallis & Glanz, 2009). Figure 1\ndepicts a simplified model of home and neighborhood environ-\nmental influences on preschool-aged children's PA based on\nsocio-ecologic theories. Several studies have provided initial\nsupport for elements of the proposed model. Specifically, pre-\nschoolers' PA was found to be positively associated with time\nspent outdoors (Kneeshaw-Price et al., 2013), access to places\nfor PA, and the availability of active-play equipment in the\nneighborhood (Farley, Mariwether, Baker, Rice, & Webber,\nis some evidence that passive-play equipment, such as video\ngames and computers, may have a negative effect on children's\nPA by providing attractive and affordable opportunities for\n1The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong\n2Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia\n3Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon, Hong Kong\n4The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong\nCorresponding Author:\nEster Cerin, Centre for Physical Activity and Nutrition Research, Deakin\nEmail: ecerin@hku.hk\nMeasures of Environmental Correlates\nof Physical Activity for Urban Chinese\nPreschool-Aged Children: Development\nand Reliability\nYi Nam Suen1, Ester Cerin1,2, Wendy Y.

PA = physical activity.\npassive activities that replace more active pursuits (Ross,\nThe neighborhood environment can also affect children's\nPA through its impact on parental perceptions of neighbor-\nhood safety (Burdette, Whitaker, & Daniels, 2004; Carver,\nCerin, & Wu, 2015), including risk of crime (Burdette et al.,\nSuen et al., 2015), risk of unintentional injury (Bruce, Lake,\nEden, & Denney, 2004), and traffic hazards (Bringolf-Isler et\nconcerns based on unfavorable perceptions of the neighbor-\nhood environment may lead to parental restrictions of active\nplay in the neighborhood. These safety concerns may be\nbuffered by higher levels of perceived community cohesion\n(Durand, Dunton, Spruijt-Metz, & Pentz, 2012).\nRelationships of neighborhood characteristics with pre-\nschool-aged children's PA depicted in Figure 1 are relatively\nunderstudied and restricted to Western populations.\nConsequently, they may not be applicable to populations of\nparents and preschool-aged children living in other geo-\ngraphical locations and cultures, such as ultra-dense Chinese\nmetropolises which, unlike most Western cities, are typified\nby high levels of air pollution and a shortage of appropriate\noutdoor play space (Cerin, Chan, Macfarlane, Lee, & Lai,\n2011). To study environment\u00adPA behavior relationships in\npreschool-aged children of ultra-dense Chinese metropo-\nlises, relevant measures of environmental characteristics that\nare culturally appropriate and specific to the target popula-\ntion (Chinese parents and their preschool-aged children) are\nneeded. Although parent-report measures of aspects of the\nneighborhood environment relevant to preschool-aged chil-\ndren's PA are available in English, they have not been trans-\nlated and validated/adapted for a Chinese population\nThus, the aim of this study was to translate, adapt or\ndevelop, and examine the reliability of parent-report mea-\nsures of home and neighborhood environmental correlates of\npreschool-aged children's PA appropriate for use with par-\nents/primary caregivers of preschool-aged children living in\nHong Kong, an ultra-dense Chinese metropolis (Cerin et al.,\n2011). Specifically, we report on the translation/adaptation\nand repeatability of measures of perceived (a) community\ncohesion, (b) signs of physical and social disorder, (c) traffic\nsafety and pedestrian infrastructure, (d) stranger danger, (e)\navailability of active-play equipment, (f) availability of pas-\nsive-play equipment, and (g) places for child's PA(see Figure\n1). We also report on a newly developed measure of per-\nceived risk of unintentional injury.\nMethod\nThis study consisted of a qualitative, adaptation stage involv-\ning cognitive interviews and refinement of measures trans-\nlated from their English original versions into Chinese and a\nquantitative, test\u00adretest reliability stage.\nParticipants\nparents/primary caregivers of Hong Kong preschool-aged\nchildren were recruited from kindergartens, preschool play-\ngroup centers, and Maternal Care and Health Clinics of the\nDepartment of Health. Twenty participants participated in\nthe qualitative stage of the study, whereas 61 participants\nparticipated in the quantitative, test\u00adretest reliability stage of\nthe study. Inclusion criteria were being the parent/primary\ncaregiver of at least one 3- to 5 year-old Chinese-speaking\nchild living in Hong Kong. Exclusionary criteria were par-\nents/primary caregivers of children with a disease affecting\nSuen et al. 3\ntheir PA behavior or cognitive functioning and those who\nwere unable to read and write in Chinese. Eligible partici-\npants completed a demographic survey prior to participating\nin the study. Table 1 reports the socio-demographic charac-\nteristics of the samples.\nProcedures\nThe study was approved by Human Research Ethics\nCommittee for Non-Clinical Faculties of the University of\nInformed consents were obtained from the participants prior\nto data collection. In the qualitative stage of the study, the\noriginal English versions of seven extant parent-report mea-\nsures (see \"Measures\" section) included in this study were\nreviewed by a panel of experts including two psychologists,\ntwo researchers in public health, an exercise scientists, and a\npediatrician. In addition, the panel of experts originated five\nitems gauging perceived risk of unintentional injury in the\nneighborhood. The English versions of the eight measures\nwere translated into Chinese, back-translated into English,\nand re-reviewed by the panel of experts. This process resulted\ninto the Chinese working versions of the eight measures.\nThe Chinese working versions of the set of measures were\ntested on a sample of Chinese-speaking parents of Hong\nKong preschool-aged children. Standardized cognitive inter-\nviews (~40 min each) examined participants' interpretations\nof the items. The information gathered during these inter-\nviews was used to modify the wording of the items or add\nnew items (when necessary). The modified measures were\nused in the test\u00adretest reliability stage of the study. In the\nquantitative stage (test\u00adretest reliability) of the study, partici-\npants were asked to complete the Chinese version of the mea-\nsures(firstassessmentT1).Themeasureswerere-administered\n7 to 10 days following the first administration (T2).\nMeasures\nSeven items from the Perceived Neighborhood Scale\n(Martinez, 2000) were used to measure community cohesion.\nThe measure was originally devised to test the participants'\nfeelings of membership, trust, mutual influence, and shared\nsocio-emotion ties with neighbors. Respondents rated each\nitem using a 5-point Likert-type scale. The original scale was\nfound to have excellent reliability and validity (Martinez,\nstantive content changes were made to this scale by the panel\nof experts or as a result of cognitive interviews.\nFourteen items measuring perceived signs of physical and\nsocial disorder were taken from the Disorder Scale developed\nby Coulton (Coulton, Korbin, & Su, 1996) and measuring per-\nceptions of deleterious conditions in the neighborhood that are\nsalient to caregivers of young children. Participants were\nasked how frequently a particular event/condition occurred in\ntheir neighborhood (e.g., How often do you see litter or trash\non the footpaths and streets in your neighborhood?) and pro-\nvided responses on a 5-point frequency scale (from never to\nfrequently). Three new items were added to this measure, 2 of\nwhich were suggested by a panel of experts (There are stray\ndogs around and Public open spaces, parks, green/dirt strips\nand sidewalks are not kept up) as they were deemed to repre-\nsent relevant environmental hazards in some areas of Hong\nKong. One item was added as a result of the cognitive inter-\nviews (Burning joss sticks and paper). Cronbach's alpha of the\nPerceived risk of unintentional injury in the neighborhood\nwas measured with a five-item scale constructed by the\nabove-mentioned panel of experts, including items related to\nrisk of injury due to stray animals; littered and disorderly\nneighborhood streets, footpaths, or open spaces; falling\nobjects from high-rise buildings; and falls during play\nTable 1.

Respondents provided\ntheir answers on a 4-point Likert-type scale.\nTo measure perceived neighborhood traffic safety and\npedestrian infrastructure, six items were taken from an\nextant survey (Grow et al., 2008) and two items were sug-\ngested by the panel of experts (The traffic makes it unsafe\nfor my child to play outdoors in my neighborhood and The\ntraffic makes it unsafe for my child to walk or ride a bike on\nthe road in my neighborhood). Respondents rated each item\non a 4-point Likert-type scale. The test\u00adretest reliability of\nthe original items ranged from .28 to .73 (Joe, Carlson, &\nFour measures were taken from the Neighborhood Impact\non Kids Survey (http://www.nikproject.org/index.htm).\nPerceived stranger danger in the neighborhood was gauged\nusing 4 items rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale.

Response options were at or around the home,\nin the neighborhood (~15 min from home), and outside the\nneighborhood.

Places for child's PA in the\nneighborhood (defined as an area 15-min walk from home)\nwere assessed using 11 out of 14 available items. Only items\ndeemed relevant to preschoolers were selected. The test\u00ad\nretest reliability of the original items ranged from .42 to .85\nData Analyses\nWe computed the test\u00adretest reliability of each item included\nin the measures. Test\u00adretest reliability of items with fre-\nquency or Likert-type response scales were estimated using\nICCs based on absolute agreement two-way mixed effects\nmodels. Responses of items gauging availability of active-\nplay equipment and places for child's PA were categorical.\nHence, their test\u00adretest reliability was assessed using kappa\ncoefficients. ICCs and kappa coefficients .80 were consid-\nered excellent, values between .60 and .79 were considered\nsubstantial, values between .40 and .59 moderate, and ICCs\nminimum and maximum item ICC or kappa coefficients\nwere computed for each measure with and without items\nshowing poor repeatability (ICC or kappa < .40).\nWe then computed means and standard deviations of sum-\nmary scores of each measure for each of the two assessments.\nThe summary scores were based on items that showed an\nacceptable level of repeatability (first step in the analyses).\nWe also computed the internal consistency (Cronbach's ) of\nmeasures representing multi-item unidimensional scales\n(e.g., community cohesion, perceived signs of social and\nphysical disorder, perceived risk of unintentional injury) for\neach assessment. Cronbach's alphas exceeding .70 suggest\nan acceptable level of internal consistency (Nunnally, 1978).\nFinally, we estimated test\u00adretest reliability (ICC) of the sum-\nmary scores of each measure. Data were analyzed using the\nSPSS statistical software package version 20.0.0.\nResults\nParticipants tended to report relatively high levels of com-\nmunity cohesion, low levels of perceived signs of social and\nphysical disorder and moderate levels of perceived risk of\nunintentional injury, traffic hazards, and stranger danger\n(Table 3). The test\u00adretest reliability of items gauging com-\nmunity cohesion was moderate. Item-specific test\u00adretest\nreliability of other measures ranged from moderate to sub-\nstantial, with the exception of a poorly performing item\ngauging perceived signs of physical and social disorder and\nan item gauging perceived traffic safety and pedestrian\ninfrastructure (Table 2). The level of internal consistency of\nthe scales was acceptable (Table 3). Test\u00adretest reliability of\nthe summary scores of the examined instruments ranged\nfrom moderate to excellent, with the single-item perceived\ntraffic safety\u00adnot many cul-de-sacs showing the lowest test\u00ad\nretest reliability and availability of passive-play equipment\nthe highest.\nDiscussion\nWe adapted and examined the reliability of seven extant par-\nent-report measures of home and neighborhood environmen-\ntal correlates of young children's PA for use with Chinese\nparents or primary caregivers of preschool-aged children liv-\ning in Hong Kong, a Chinese ultra-dense metropolis. We also\ndeveloped and examined the reliability of a new measure of\nperceived risk of unintentional injury in the neighborhood\nappropriate for the same target population.\nInput from a multi-disciplinary panel of experts and par-\nents indicated that five out of seven extant measures did not\nrequire any substantive changes to the items. These included\ncommunity cohesion, perceived stranger danger, places for\nchild's PA, and availability of passive and active-play equip-\nment. The first two measures describe, respectively, feelings\nof community interconnectedness and parental protection of\nchildren that may be common to all humans, regardless of\ntheir cultural background, which would explain why no\namendments to the measures were suggested. As to the other\ntwo measures, it appears that the types of play equipment and\nplaces to play available to Hong Kong children are similar to\nthose found in Western countries. This is not surprising given\nSuen et al. 5\nthat Hong Kong is a highly developed, global trade center\nwith a high level of availability of goods and facilities. This\nsituation is likely to be similar in other Chinese metropolises\nTwo items were added to the extant measure of traffic\nsafety and pedestrian infrastructure, both of which depicted\nsituations of traffic hazards associated with parents prevent-\ning their children from engaging in PA outdoors. It was\ndeemed necessary to include these items because traffic vol-\nume and hazards are relatively high in Hong Kong (Cerin\net al., 2013), as they are in other Chinese cities (Pucher,\nPeng, Mittal, Zhu, & Korattyswaroopan, 2007), and only\nunder certain circumstances they may be perceived as suffi-\nciently serious to warrant parental intervention (prevent chil-\ndren from playing outdoors).\nThree items were added to the measure of perceived signs\nof physical and social disorder. These included the presence\nof stray dogs; un-kept open spaces, parks, and footpaths; and\nburning joss sticks and paper. Stray dogs are the top safety\nhazards affecting children's outdoor PA, an environmental\ncorrelate of PA in other age groups in Hong Kong (Cerin et\nal., 2013), and an acknowledged environmental \"hazard\" in\nmany other Chinese cities (Hou, Jin, & Ruan, 2012). An item\nabout un-kept public open spaces, parks, and footpaths was\nincluded in the measure because Hong Kong has large\nexpanses of open spaces (e.g., country parks). However, most\nof these spaces are too steep or overgrown to be suitable for\nchildren's play. \"Burning joss sticks and paper\" was added to\nthe measure of signs of physical and social disorder because\nit is a rather dangerous practice unique to the Chinese\nculture.\nTable 3.

The results are consistent with those found (when\navailable) for the English original versions (Joe et al., 2008;\nRosenberg et al., 2009). Two items were found to have poor\ntest\u00adretest reliability. One of these items belonged to the\nmeasure of perceived signs of physical and social disorder\nand pertained to the presence of \"Disorderly or misbehaving\ngroups of young children.\" Respondents might have been\nunsure as to whether misbehaving young children should be\nclassified as a sign of social disorder. As this type of occur-\nrence is unlikely to be a sign of social disorder and represent\na real threat to the community, we propose the item be\nexcluded from the scale. Another poorly performing item\nwas \"There are crosswalks and signals on busy streets.\" We\nmaintain that this item could also be omitted because it mea-\nsures an aspect of the environment that is relevant to walking\nfor transportation, which preschool-aged children are\nunlikely to engage in when unaccompanied.\nOf note is that measures of places for child's PA and avail-\nability of passive-play equipment at home showed the high-\nest levels of test\u00adretest reliability, possibly due to the more\nobjective nature of these features as compared with those\ninvolving affective judgments (e.g., threat posed by strang-\ners) and a greater level of respondents' knowledge about\nthese features (equipment at home as opposed to equipment\nin the neighborhood). It is also noteworthy that all measures\nhad an acceptable level of internal consistency indicating\nthat they gauged unidimensional features of the perceived\nenvironment.\nWe developed a preliminary measure of perceived risk of\nunintentional injury appropriate for Chinese parents of pre-\nschool-age children. This is an understudied aspect of the\nneighborhood environment that is unrelated to crime and traf-\nfic hazards but that can be an important source of concern for\nparents of young children (Bruce et al., 2004). During forma-\ntive work, five main threats of unintentional injury in the\nneighborhood were identified. Mirroring the newly added\nitems to the scale of perceived signs of physical and social\ndisorder, the presence of stray animals and littered and un-kept\noutdoor spaces, streets, and footpaths were identified as pos-\nsible sources of injury. Falling objects from high-rise build-\nings were also identified as a significant danger to young\nchildren playing outdoors. This is in line with a previous study\non Hong Kong older adults (Cerin et al., 2010) and highlights\nthe nature of the built environment of Hong Kong and other\nChinese metropolises typified by a large number of compactly\nlocated, residential high-rise buildings with opens spaces,\nsmall parks, and playgrounds within close proximity. Of note\nwas the fact that the mere act of playing outdoors was identi-\nfied as a potential source of unintentional injury (falling while\nplaying). The test\u00adretest reliability of this new scale was mod-\nerate and its level of internal consistency acceptable.\nEstablishing whether the metric properties of the mea-\nsures examined in this study are generalizable to other\nChinese populations is warranted. Future studies will also\nneed to establish the construct validity of the examined\nmeasures by conducting confirmatory factor analyses\n(where appropriate) and estimating associations of the indi-\nvidual measures with preschool-aged children's PA\nbehavior.\nConclusion\nWe adapted and translated in Chinese seven extant measures\nof various perceived aspects of the home and neighborhood\nenvironments deemed to be relevant to urban Chinese pre-\nschool-aged children's PA and appropriate for their parents/\nprimary caregivers. We also developed a new measure of\nperceived risk of unintentional injury in the neighborhood\nand examined the test\u00adretest reliability and, where applica-\nble, the internal consistency of all eight measures. This study\nsuggests that all measures have adequate levels of test\u00adretest\nreliability and internal consistency and can be potentially\nused in studies of environmental correlates of urban Chinese\npreschool-aged children's PA. Yet, the measures' factorial\nvalidity and predictive validity as actual correlates of Chinese\npreschool-aged children's PA need to be assessed in future\nstudies.\n"
