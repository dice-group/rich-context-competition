The econ-\nand had a sustained period of rapid economic\ngrowth. Real incomes rose, and the growth in\nhealth care costs slowed.3 In addition, the ex-\npansions of Medicaid coverage to children\nand pregnant women had been largely phased\nin and were no longer a source of significant\ngrowth, and state welfare reform efforts began\nto adversely affect Medicaid enrollment.4 We\ndepth to show changes in insurance coverage\nfor various subgroups.\nReasons For Two Study Periods\nIn addition to the strong economy and\nchanges in welfare/Medicaid policies, the\nother reason for breaking study periods be-\nchanges were made to the CPS that make\ncomparisons of trends before and after 1993/\n1994 inappropriate. Both changes began with\nthe March 1995 survey: a revision of the health\ninsurance coverage questions, and the intro-\nduction of a new sample framework. The re-\nvised questionnaire included separate, more\ndetailed questions about employer-sponsored\nand private nongroup health insurance, state-\nspecific names for Medicaid, a new set of\nquestions for out-of-household coverage, and\na catch-all question for insurance. The order\nof the health insurance questions also was\nchanged at this time. No longer did questions\nregarding public types of health insurance\ncome first; the health segment of the March\n1995 survey started with questions about pri-\nvate health coverage. The primary impact of\nthese changes was to increase the number of\npersons reporting employer-sponsored cover-\nage, reduce the number with private non-\ngroup coverage, and increase the reported\nhealth insurance coverage of children.5\nSeveral methodological problems with the\nmeasurement of insurance coverage in the\nCPS have been documented.6 Perhaps the\n\u00a92000Project HOPE\u00adThePeople-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,Inc.\nJohn Holahan is director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute in Washington, DC.

If they are reporting current cover-\nage, then the number of uninsured should be\ninterpreted as those who lack health insur-\nance at a point in time. If they are reporting\nany coverage in the past year, then by defini-\ntion a residual count of the uninsured would\nbe a count of those who lacked coverage for\nthe entire year. There has been considerable\ndebate of this issue. Although it has not been\nresolved, it is nonetheless clear that the CPS\nhas generally been consistent across time,\nwhich is what is important for this study.\nA second issue is that the CPS appears to\nconsistently understate Medicaid coverage, as\nshown in comparison with estimates from\nstates and federal administrative data. Be-\ncause Medicaid may be understated, the\nnumber of uninsured persons is likely to be\noverstated.

Also,\nother public coverage fell from 2.7 percent to\n2.4 percent (0.5 million); this was due princi-\npally to reductions in military-related cover-\nage. Other private coverage also declined,\npossibly reflecting the increased cost of health\ninsurance in the private nongroup market.\nThese reductions in Medicaid, other pub-\nlic, and private nongroup coverage would\nhave resulted in even greater increases in the\nuninsured had it not been for increases in em-\nployer-sponsored coverage. The number of\nadults covered through employers rose about\n6.1 million, while the number of dependent\nchildren covered rose by 3.3 million (Exhibit\n1). Thus, unlike in the previous period, the\nincrease in employer-sponsored coverage\nkept the number of uninsured from growing\nmore rapidly than it otherwise would have.\nn Changes in coverage by income\nwas noteworthy because of the rapid growth\nin the U.S. economy, as seen in the analysis of\ncoverage by income levels (Exhibit 2).9 For\nthe population below 200 percent of the fed-\neral poverty level, there were significant re-\nductions in Medicaid enrollment and in pri-\nvate nongroup coverage. The declines in\nMedicaid enrollment all occurred for persons\nwith incomes below 100 percent of poverty;\nreductions in private nongroup coverage oc-\ncurred both below 100 percent of poverty and\ndeclines, the number of uninsured persons\nwith incomes below 200 percent of poverty\nrose by 0.8 million.

Using data from Exhibit 2, we esti-\nmate that if the Medicaid enrollment rate had\nstayed at its 1994 level, Medicaid enrollment\nwould have fallen by about 1.3 million because\nof the decline in the low-income population.\nAlternatively, if the low-income population\nhad grown at the national population growth\nrate but the Medicaid enrollment rate had de-\nclined as it did, Medicaid enrollment would\nhave fallen by 2.1 million.

This was mostly ex-\nplained by reductions in employer-sponsored\nand by the large increase in higher-income\nadults and children.

They also experi-\nenced substantial drops in private nongroup\ncoverage. The number of uninsured among\nfamilies with incomes below 200 percent of\npoverty increased by 0.8 million. Had it not\nbeen for a decline of 5.1 million in the total\nnumber of persons below 200 percent of pov-\nerty, the increase in the number of low-income\npersons who were uninsured would have been\nmuch higher. A drop in the share of higher-in-\ncome adults and children with employer-\nsponsored coverage, coupled with the growth\nin their numbers, resulted in nearly two mil-\nlion more uninsured persons in this category.\nn Coverage of children and adults.

Most of this is explained by de-\ncreases in Medicaid coverage, which dropped\nin the uninsurance rate among nonworkers\nhad less of an impact on the overall uninsur-\nance rate, because the size of this group de-\nclined. Moreover, the increase in the overall\nuninsurance rate was dampened because\nmore people moved from part-time work or\nnonworking status to full-time work, where\nfewer people were uninsured.\nDiscussion And Policy\nImplications\nOur analysis has shown that the uninsurance\nrate in the United States has continued to rise\ndespite a strong economy. However, the rea-\nsons for the increase since 1994 have been fun-\ndamentally different from those in the years\nimmediately before 1994. The rate of em-\nployer-based coverage has actually risen\nacross the nonelderly population. However,\nthis has been more than offset by declines in\nMedicaid and in private nongroup coverage.\nThe increase in employer-sponsored cover-\nage would seem to be a reversal of previous\npatterns. However, we also find that within\neach of two higher-income groups, the decline\nwas statistically significant. It was the move-\nment of people into higher income brackets,\nwhere rates of employer-sponsored coverage\nare higher, that was responsible for the overall\nincrease in both the rate and the number of\npersons with employer-sponsored coverage. The\nslowing rate of growth in health care costs, cou-\npledwith increasing real incomes, also probably\nkept the decline in employer-sponsored cover-\nage, even withinincome groups, relatively small.\nWe also found that private nongroup cov-\nerage declined overall. However, the propor-\ntion of persons with private nongroup cover-\nage fell most sharply for those below 200\npercent of poverty. One possibility is that\nhigh premiums in this market may have made\nprivate nongroup coverage unaffordable for\nmany lower-income families.\nThe decline of 3.3 million in Medicaid dur-\nSome of this may be the result of the improved\neconomy, but much is probably related to\nstate and federal welfare reform.

For those below 200 percent of\npoverty, the reductions in Medicaid and in\nprivate nongroup coverage have more than\noffset any increases in employer-sponsored\ncoverage. For higher-income groups, the de-\ncline in employer-sponsored and private non-\ngroup coverage has caused the uninsurance\nrate to rise.
