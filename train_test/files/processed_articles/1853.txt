Diabetes Care 29:\nA Strong Dose-\nResponse Relation\nBetween Serum\nConcentrations of\nPersistent Organic\nPollutants and\nDiabetes: Results\nFrom the National\nHealth and Nutrition\nExamination Survey\nResponse to Lee et al.\nLee et al. (1) and Diabetes Care deserve\npraise for publishing what may be\nthe first study worldwide to analyze,\nin a sample of a general population, serum\nconcentrations of persistent organic pol-\nlutants (POPs) and plasma fasting glu-\ncose. The main implication of the study is\nthat POPs stored in the adipose tissue may\nbe a key player in the etiopathogenesis of\ntype 2 diabetes. It is even rational to spec-\nulate that POPs might be, if not \"the single\nfactor\" (2), then one factor linking some\ncore components of the metabolic\nsyndrome.\nIn the study by Lee et al. and other\nstudies (3,4), it seems likely that a rela-\ntionship exists between diabetes and\nPOPs. Hence, patients, clinicians, and\nother health professionals may need to\ncope with the possible fact that on aver-\nage, diabetic subjects have higher concen-\ntrations of POPs and may thus be more\nlikely to suffer the adverse effects of POPs.\nThe mechanistic, clinical, and public\nhealth implications of the study by Lee et al.\nare potentially high (1,3\u00ad5). However, sev-\neral questions remain unanswered regard-\ning the nature of the relationship between\nprevalence of diabetes and population\ndistribution of POPs (6,7). Therefore, I\nwould appreciate it if Lee et al. could ad-\ndress the following issues.\n1) What is the direction of the rela-\ntionships with the poverty income ratio?\nFor example, in Table 1, did wealthier in-\ndividuals have lower concentrations of\nDDE and higher concentrations of\nPCB153 after adjusting for confounders?\n2) Many of the estimates (e.g., in Ta-\nble 2) were adjusted for age, sex, race,\nincome, lipids, BMI, and waist circumfer-\nence. This is coherent with several aims\n(e.g., to \"isolate\" the effect of POPs from\nthat due to obesity, age, race, or income).\nHowever, adjusting by BMI and waist cir-\ncumference may also be an overadjust-\nment, since fat intake is the most common\nsource of exposure to POPs (1,5) and\nsince the body burden of some of these\nlipophilic chemicals, but not all and not\nalways, increases with increasing BMI\n(8,9). Thus, crude or less adjusted odds\nratios (ORs) would also be relevant for\ndetermining the prevalence of diabetes in\npeople with specific concentrations of\nPOPs. Could the authors provide some\ncrude ORs?\n3) The finding that there was no asso-\nciation between obesity and diabetes\namong subjects with nondetectable levels\nof POPs is highly surprising and calls for\nadditional results to be presented. A fig-\nure may be warranted.\n4) Also crucial is what we may call\n\"the changes in BMI-POPs relationship.\"\nCould the authors please comment on the\npossible influence upon BMI measure-\nments of the cross-sectional design of the\nstudy? Could they suggest possible con-\nsequences upon findings of weight gain\nand weight loss in diabetic and nondia-\nbetic participants?\n5) High-prevalence ORs were found\nfor the summary or composite of the six\nPOPs with the highest concentrations.\nAre the results similar if the joint effects of\nmultiple POPs are assessed through alter-\nnative methods?\n6) Finally, the authors state that \"re-\nverse causality is unlikely.\" Indeed, evi-\ndence supporting the hypothesis that\ndiabetes increases accumulation of POPs\nseems scarce (4). Do the authors know of\nstudies on the toxicokinetics of POPs in\ndiabetic subjects demonstrating that they\naccumulate POPs more than nondiabetic\nsubjects?\nFrom the School of Medicine, Universitat Auto\n`noma\nde Barcelona and Institut Municipal d'Investigacio\n\u00b4\nMe\n`dica, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.\nAddress correspondence to Prof. Miquel Porta,\nSchool of Medicine, Universitat Auto\n`noma de Bar-\ncelona and Institut Municipal d'Investigacio\n\u00b4 Me\n`dica,\nCatalonia, Spain.
