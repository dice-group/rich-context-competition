Extensive research has docu-\nmented both the large amounts of added caloric sweeteners in the\ndiet and the large increases in the consumption of these sweet-\neners over the past 2 decades (4\u00ad9). High-fructose corn syrup\n(HFCS) has been used increasingly as a replacement for other\ncaloric sweeteners, first in beverages, and more recently, as a\nreplacement for sugar in thousands of other processed and pack-\naged foods (10). A causal link between increased consumption of\nHFCS and obesity has been hypothesized (10), and although\nanimal research (11\u00ad14) and a small number of human studies\n(15, 16) support this hypothesis, Bray et al note (10) that exten-\nsive human research on this topic is limited and deserves further\nattention.\nHFCS is interesting for many reasons. At equal caloric value,\nHFCS is both sweeter and less expensive than other added sweet-\neners. Thus, food and beverage manufacturers were able to in-\ncrease the sweetness of their products for a fraction of the price.\nThe overall result has been an increase in the intensity of the\nsweetness of soft drinks and other caloric beverages (10, 17).\nThere is some potential for disagreement on this point, but only\nindirect evidence exists (18).\nIn part, the shift from using sucrose to HFCS was encouraged\nby extensive government subsidies of corn farmers, with a ma-\njority of US farm policies focused on promoting increased pro-\nduction of inexpensive corn. One study showed that as a result of\nsuch subsidies, the consumer price of corn (and its byproducts)\nand 2005 (19). For beverage manufacturers, in particular, lower\nsweetener costs allowed increased serving sizes (which would be\nonly marginally more expensive for the consumer), thus freeing\nmoney for marketing campaigns (20). Although far less studied,\nsimilar trends have likely occurred in other food sectors. How-\never, HFCS should not be studied independently of the context of\ntrends in total caloric sweetener consumption. With rising corn\nprices and a farm bill proposing to remove some of the corn\nsubsidies, it is possible that HFCS prices will begin to rise con-\nsiderably. Were this to occur, it may result in the substitution of\nanother caloric sweetener for HFCS, resulting in continued con-\nsumption of sweetened, refined carbohydrates in the United\nStates.\nThis study focuses on updating our understanding of the con-\nsumption of both HFCS and other added caloric sweeteners.\nEssentially, these added sugars are found in thousands of food\nitems consumed in the United States and globally (21, 22). Un-\nlike prior studies, the present study expands the efforts of previ-\nous researchers to estimate added sugars and HFCS consumption\n1 From the Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina, Chapel\nHill, NC.\n2 Presented at the American Society for Nutrition Public Information\nCommittee symposium \"High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS): Everything\nYou Wanted to Know, but Were Afraid to Ask,\" held at Experimental Biol-\n3 Address reprint requests to BM Popkin, University of North Carolina-\nStreet, Chapel Hill, NC 27516.

This approach more accurately\nreflects the contribution of these energy sources to the US diet.\nMETHODS\nAvailability of HFCS\nGiven the absence of direct measures of HFCS consumption,\nfood disappearance data provide the best indirect estimate of\nHFCS availability in the US. We used data from the US Depart-\nment of Agriculture's (USDA's) Economic Research Service\nFood Availability Databases (23) to examine the availability of\ntotal sugars and HFCS. Measures of total caloric sweetener and\nHFCS availability were taken directly from this data. Using mea-\nsures of total HFCS availability in pounds per person per day, we\nfurther calculated the proportion of HFCS that is HFCS-42 ver-\nsus HFCS-55. These 2 formulations of HFCS refer to the per-\ncentage of the sweetener that is fructose, ie, HFCS-42 has 42%\nfructose and 58% glucose. HFCS-55 has sweetness equivalent to\nsucrose and is used in many carbonated soft drinks, particularly\nintheUnitedStates.HFCS-42issomewhatlesssweetandisused\nin many fruit-flavored noncarbonated beverages, baked goods,\nand other products. All results account for production and import\nand are adjusted for loss, waste, and spoilage. Data were avail-\nFoods containing HFCS\nComprehensive information on foods and beverages contain-\ning HFCS is not readily available and must be pieced together\nfromvarioussources.ItisclearthatHFCSaccountsforalmostall\nadded caloric sweeteners used by manufacturers of soft drinks\nand fruit drinks as well as other specialty calorically sweetened\nbeverages (24, 25). In addition, HFCS can be found in numerous\nprocessed foods, including canned foods (eg, soups, fruits), ce-\nreals and baked goods, desserts, sweetened and flavored dairy\nproducts (eg, yogurt, condiments, and jellies), candies, and many\nfast food items. Most of the information on availability comes\nfrom lists compiled by individuals who have examined ingredi-\nents of foods in their homes or from organizations concerned\nwith HFCS-related food allergies (26\u00ad28). Direct measurements\nof the HFCS composition of foods are not available from man-\nufacturers or publicly available food-composition tables. For the\npurposes of this article, foods that had either added sugar or\nfructose were considered to potentially contain HFCS.\nEstimating HFCS and added sugar in foods\nWe obtained direct estimates of added sugar by using the\nUSDA food-composition table and its recipe and servings files.\nThe recipe and servings files provide a direct measure of added\nsugar in each food. Because direct estimates of HFCS are not\navailable, and because the existing literature on this topic is\nscarce, we elected to estimate the HFCS content in foods and\nbeverages by using 2 different techniques referred to as the NDS\nand Glinsmann methods. These are discussed in detail below.\nNDS method\nThis method uses measured total fructose and added sugar\nfrom the University of Minnesota's Nutrition Coordinating Cen-\nter (NCC) Nutrient Database System (NDS) sugars file and mea-\nsures of added sugar from the USDA food-composition table.\nThe USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory is the primary source of\nnutrient values and nutrient composition within the NDS. How-\never, these values are supplemented by food manufacturers' in-\nformation and data that are available in the scientific literature\n(29). Using data from NDS was the only way we could obtain\ndirect measures of fructose for sample foods. For all foods and\nbeverages, except soda and fruit drinks (for which HFCS was\nassumed to be 100% of added sugar), we used a 3-step process to\nestimate HFCS. The steps were as follows:\n1) Calculation of the proportion of added sugar that is\nfructose\nUsing added sugar and fructose values provided for 988 foods\nin the NDS sugars database, we determined the proportion of\nadded sugar that is fructose (Pf\n)[r] by dividing fructose (g/100 g\nfood) by added sugar (g/100 g food). This calculation was carried\nout for each food code individually.\n2) Estimation of the amount of added sugar that is HFCS\nWe found direct matches between NDS and USDA food codes\nfor roughly 50% of the data. For these foods, the Pf\nwas multi-\npliedbytheamountofaddedsugarineachfoodasreportedbythe\nUSDA. This resulted in an estimate of the gram amount of HFCS\nper food code. This value was then multiplied by the amount of\nadded sugar per food reported for a total estimate of HFCS by\nfood for each respondent. For example, \"fruit flavored juice\nadded sugar/100 g drink. The estimated proportion of added\nsugar that was fructose [Pf\nwas multiplied by the amount of \"fruit flavored juice drinks\"\nreported consumed by each respondent.\nFor food codes where no direct match between NDS and\nUSDA was possible, we multiplied the mean proportion of fruc-\ntose (Pf\n)[r] assigned to each food codes' larger food group (de-\nscribed in detail below) by the amount of added sugar in each\nfood as reported by the USDA.\n3) Generation of measure of HFCS by food group\nHFCS consumption was calculated for each food and summed\nacross food groups. Data are presented by food group across\ntime.\nGlinsmann method\nIn 1986, a task force for the Food and Drug Administration\nproduced estimates of intake of natural and added sugars, includ-\ningHFCS,sucrose,andothercornsweeteners(30).Usingdataon\nHFCS and added sugar availability (by food group), Glinsmann\net al created category-wide estimates of the proportion of added\nsweetener that is HFCS. For example, of the 1684.24 million kg\n(3713.12 million lbs) of added sweetener available to the bakery\nby the amount of added sugar in the \"grains\" food group to obtain\nan estimate of HFCS. As with the previous method, 100% of\nadded sugar in soda and fruit drinks was assumed to be HFCS.\nWithin food groups, we generated estimates of HFCS by apply-\ning these factors to the amount of added sugar reported in the\nUSDA food-composition table and summed intake by food\ngroup.\nAlthough we present results from both methods for compari-\nson, the results reported here are based on the Glinsmann method\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nof estimation. This method was selected for several reasons.\nFirst, unlike the NDS method, the proportions estimated by\nGlinsmann et al had been successfully implemented in at least\none previous study of HFCS consumption (10). Secondly, NCC\ndata were not intended, nor established, for application to the\nUSDA survey data, and used a different set of food identifiers.\nAdditionally, the NCC data use the NDB foods, which were\ndivided differently from the USDA survey foods, which further\ncomplicated the matching process. This meant that matching\nwith the USDA survey data was poor, resulting in a 50% match\nrate. For the remaining 50% of foods, food group means were\napplied. This may have resulted in a \"washing out\" of our HFCS\nestimates.Furthermore,thetotalfructosevalueprovidedbyNDS\nrequired assumptions (not based on scientific literature) about\nthe proportion of added sugar that is HFCS versus some other\nform of fructose sweetener.\nEstimated timing of HFCS use in the food supply\nPrecise information on the introduction of HFCS as an added\nsweetener into the food supply was not available. Various\nsources cited the early 1980s as the years when Coca-Cola and\nPepsi introduced the reformulation of their beverages to include\nHFCS (20, 31), at which point HFCS was the sole added sweet-\nener in these beverages. For nonbeverage categories, there is\nevidence of HFCS use started in the late 1980s. However, infor-\nmation that would allow for accurate estimates of the amount\nyears, adequate evidence shows that HFCS was used much more\nwidely in the general food supply. Thus, we applied the mean\nproportion of fructose (Pf\n) for each food group's added sugar for\nthis period only.\nFood group creation\nFoods were initially grouped by using the University of North\nCarolina (UNC) food-grouping system (32), which places foods\nand beverages into nutrient-based subgroups on the basis of their\nfat and fiber contents. However, these food groups varied widely\nwith respect to added sugar values. Because these groups would\nultimately be used to provide estimates of the fructose proportion\nfor foods that did not have a direct match between NDS and\nUSDA, the original food groups were modified. Fat and fiber\ndistinctions were removed, and foods were regrouped according\ntoaddedsugar.Forexample,thelow,medium,andhigh-fatdairy\nUNCfoodgroupswereseparatedintodairynosugaradded,dairy\nlow sugar added (below the mean for grams of added sugar), and\ndairy high sugar added (at or above the mean for grams of added\nsugar). Finally, the beverage groups, which were combined with\nall other food groups in the original UNC food grouping system\n(ie, low-fat milk was grouped with low-fat dairy products, such\nas cottage cheese), were redefined and categorized in accordance\nwith the Beverage Guidance Panel (33). For the examination of\ntrends, the sugar groups were combined (ie, no sugar, low sugar,\nand high sugar desserts presented as desserts).\nConsumption data\nWe used data from the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey\nthe Continuing Survey of Food Intake in Individuals [CSFII\nexamine trends in estimated HFCS consumption. Dietary intake\ndays by use of a single interviewer-administered 24-h recall\nfollowed by a 2-d self-administered diet record.

This 5-step computer-assisted dietary recall instrument\nhas been cited as an improvement over previous methods for\ncollecting dietary recall information because it includes multiple\nprobes for potentially forgotten foods and beverages and asks\nabout preparation methods and specifics about each eating oc-\nlected: the first day of intake was collected by using the computer\nassisted, in-person interviewer-administered 24-h recall, and the\nsecond days' intake was collected by using a telephone-\nadministered(computer-assisted)survey.Becauseofdifferences\nin data collection methods, only the first day of intake was used.\nAnalyses were completed by using SAS (v.9.1.3; SAS Insti-\ntute Inc, Cary, NC) and Stata (v.9.2; Stata Corp LP, College\nStation, TX). We weighted means to be nationally representa-\ntive, and adjusted the standard errors to account for the stratified\nand clustered sample design.

These data were compiled by the\nUSDA Economic Research Service; the HFCS data are those\nfrom Table 1. Total fructose is defined as the sum of free fructose\nplus fructose contained in the disaccharide sucrose (assumed to\nbe50%).FreefructoseisdefinedasthemonosaccharideinHFCS\nplus other small amounts found in honey (assumed to be 38.5%),\nfor example. Total fructose has changed relatively little over the\npast 34 y compared with the change in HFCS availability. Since\n1970, total fructose availability has increased nearly 18%, from\n45.7 to 53.7 g per capita per day, whereas HFCS availability\nincreased from 0.5 to 52.4 g per capita per day over the same time\nperiod. Availability of both total and HFCS appear to be slightly\ndeclining since 2000, although the continued direction of the\ntrend is difficult to predict.\nConsumption of total added sugar and HFCS\nAdded sugar accounted for 17% of total energy intake in 2004,\nintakeofaddedsugar,butsince1977therehasbeenastatistically\nsignificant increase (compared with the previous year) in total\nadded sugar and added sugar as a percentage of total carbohy-\ndrates consumed.

Within\nfood groups, the overall trends in added sugar consumption are\nnot as clear as the trends within beverage groups. For example,\nthe per capita daily caloric intake of added sugar from snacks\nthen decreased slightly to 2 kcal per person per day in 2004\n(Figure 4). Similar trends were observed for cereal (Figure 4),\nsalad dressing (data not shown), and dairy food groups (data not\nshown).

Interest-\ningly, breads accounted for considerably more calories of\ngroups contributed equally to per capita energy intake from\nadded sugar. Overall, however, foods accounted for 1% of\ntotal energy and 1% of total carbohydrates, save cereal,\nbreads, and desserts, which accounted for between 1% (ce-\nreal) and 6% (desserts) of total carbohydrates in 2004.\nEstimates among consumers\nAmongconsumers,caloricintakefromaddedsugarandHFCS\namongthetopfoodsandbeverageswasconsiderablygreaterthan\npercapitaestimates(Table3).Forexample,althougharelatively\nsmall (10%) percentage of persons reported consuming sweet-\nened tea, sweetened tea provided an estimated 134 kcal per con-\nsumer per day compared with an estimated per capita amount of\n14 kcal per person per day from added sugar (95 kcal per con-\nsumer per day versus 10 kcal per capita per day from HFCS).\nLikewise, 24% of cereal consumers obtained 40 more calories\n(53versus13)fromaddedsugarthanthepercapitaestimates,and\nfor the 46% of reported soda consumers, there was a 98% in-\ncrease in energy from added sugar (as HFCS).

Mechanis-\ntically, this hypothesis is based on differences in the rates of\ndigestion and absorption between fructose and glucose (38\u00ad41)\nand the observation that increased consumption of sugar-\nsweetened beverages is associated with weight gain over time\n(15, 42\u00ad44). These topics are beyond the scope of this article, but\nare addressed elsewhere in this supplement. The purpose of this\narticle was to examine the trends and patterns in HFCS and added\nsugar consumption in both beverages and foods.\nWe report that daily per capita intake of calories from HFCS\nand added sugar has followed a general upward trend since the\nand 1977, added sugar accounted for 17% of total daily energy\nintake and 32% of total carbohydrate intake among Americans\naged 2 y and older. These values represented an increase of 31%\n(from the lowest value in 1977) and 23% (from the lowest value\nin 1991), respectively. The trend in HFCS consumption has been\ncalories from HFCS, and since 2000, calories from HFCS have\nremained relatively stable.

Using the same Glinsmann method as reported\nhere, Bray et al (10) examined HFCS consumption between 1977\nand 1998 for a select set of food groups, namely soft drinks, fruit\ndrinks, and desserts. As reported in our article, Bray et al found\nageneralincreasingtrendinaddedsugarandHFCSconsumption\nfrom the 3 food sources they examined.

Furthermore, because foods\nand beverages are typically not consumed independently of one\nanother, contribution of any food or beverage to an individuals'\ntotal daily energy intake is potentially much larger.\nOur article has several limitations. First, because of the lack of\navailable data, the amount of HFCS in foods had to be estimated.\nBecause little work has been done to estimate HFCS intake, we\nused 2 different estimation methods--one based on availability\n(Glinsmann method) and one on measured fructose (NCC\nmethod) in foods. For some key food groups, these methods\nresulted in significantly different estimates (eg, the desserts food\ngroup). These differences are likely the result of differences\nbetween the 2 estimation techniques, each of which required\nacceptance of certain assumptions.\nWith respect to the NCC (measured fructose) method, a direct\nmeasure of fructose was not available for all foods reportedly\nconsumed in the USDA database; linkage codes between NCC\nand USDA data were available for only 1000 foods. For foods\nfor which no direct link was possible, we applied an average\nfructose value (based on the food group to which that particular\nfood was assigned), that likely resulted in a misestimation of\nfructose,andHFCS,formanyfoods.However,itisimpossibleto\npredictthedirectionofthismisestimationforanyindividualfood\nor beverage item. To reduce misestimation, we grouped foods\naccording to their added sugar content. However, within some\nfood groups, a large range of added sugar and fructose would\nresult in a dilution of average values within a food group. Addi-\nsures of added sugar were not available. For these foods, we\napplied sugar values from the closest matching 8-digit USDA\nWhen there were no comparable foods in previous USDA files\n(eg, Propel Fitness water; Gatorade, Chicago, IL), we used nu-\ntritional information provided by the manufacturers and calcu-\nlated added sugar values from this information. Our estimates of\nHFCS consumption using the Glinsmann Method are based on\navailability of data from the mid-1980s; they are likely to under-\nrepresent HFCS availability within these sectors today.\nSecond, our data are limited by differential collection methods\nbetween exams and differential time spans over which data were\nhave been long enough to observe sensitive changes in consump-\ntion patterns. To create more comparable time spans between\nstudies, we combined the NHANES data into a single survey and\nreexamined trends. Although the trends in added sugar were\nslightly clearer with use of the combined surveys, HFCS could\nnot be estimated (recall that HFCS was not widely used in food\nproducts until the late 1990s). Thus, we elected to keep each\nNHANES survey separate. Some of the differences in observed\nconsumption may also have been due to changes in data collec-\ntion methods. In 2000, the automated multiple pass method was\nused for dietary collection. This tool is designed with internal\nprompts to help decrease the incidence of underreporting,\nthereby increasing the accuracy of data collection. Although this\nmay result in an increase in reporting frequency of foods and\nbeverages, it is unlikely to account for the large changes reported\nhere.\nIn general, the availability and consumption of HFCS and\nadded sugar has increased over the past 3 decades. We report that\nthe types of foods and beverages contributing to daily energy\nintake from HFCS have shifted over the past several decades:\ndesserts accounted for roughly 4% of total energy intake in 1965.\nAverage per capita caloric intake from added sugar by quintiles (Q) among persons aged 2 y1\nTotal\nBeverages\nFoods\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nThisnumberdroppedto3%by2004,whereassodaaccountedfor\n6.8%oftotalenergyintakeinthesameyear.Althoughsweetened\nbeverages,suchassodaandfruitdrinks,currentlyaccountforthe\nlargest proportion of energy from HFCS, we report that other\nbeverages (sports drinks) and foods (desserts, breads, and ready-\nto-eat cereals) are also contributing considerable amounts of per\ncapita energy intake. These are foods that are often consumed as\nsnacks rather than meals (37, 46), so ultimately, it seems that\nHFCS(andotheraddedsugar)isnotwhat'sfordinner,it'swhat's\nin addition to dinner.
