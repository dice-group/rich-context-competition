    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study was designed to explore medical students' and primary school teachers' experiences of a new community teaching\nproject. Academic staff and students from the School of Medicine Dundee, National Health Service partners, local education\ndepartment, and primary school teachers engaged in a collaborative project which has embedded community engagement in\nthe curriculum while encouraging interprofessional education through multiagency working. Influenced by evaluative inquiry,\nthis qualitative study used an online questionnaire, designed to give participants the freedom to respond, and give their own\nopinions, via free text responses. The results show the value of a real primary school\u00adbased situation, and the merit of\nexperiential learning gained throughout the program, in which students interacted with children about health promotion in\na meaningful way. The interprofessional and collaborative nature of the project enhanced the value of the experience for all\nparticipants in relation to the benefits of teamwork, dispelling the doctor authority and recognition of the roles of others.\nThe experience was an interactive, enjoyable, and expressive way to facilitate learning, and has helped prepare the health\ncare students for future practice.\n",

Over the past 10 years, IPE has\nbecome an integral part of many health and social care pro-\nfessional programs throughout the United Kingdom. The\nreason for the growth in IPE activity is the requirement for\nhealth and social care graduates to be competent regarding\ninterprofessional collaboration and team working in a variety\nof settings.\nThrough an evaluative inquiry approach, this article reports\non the way in which academic staff and students from the\nSchool of Medicine Dundee, United Kingdom; National\nHealth Service (NHS) partners; local education department,\nand primary school teachers engaged in a collaborative project\nwhich has embedded community engagement in the curricu-\nlum while encouraging IPE through multiagency working.\nThe School of Medicine offers a 5-year medical degree\nprogram and delivers an integrated, systematic course where\ncontributions come from a range of specialties and commu-\nnity-based teaching. The General Medical Council (2015)\nsets out the outcomes for graduates. Students are expected to\nbe able to teach, reflect, communicate, work, and collaborate\nwith other members of the multidisciplinary team, in addi-\ntion to respecting the values and beliefs of others.\nThe project began as a pilot in 2008 for medical and nurs-\ning students and was designed to achieve a number of spe-\ncific goals. These include the enhancement of health care\nundergraduate professionals'experience of collaboration and\nteam working, to introduce them to the concept of multia-\ngency working, to work with young children and so gain a\npractical understanding of childhood growth and develop-\nment, to inform their own skills as a teacher, and to enable\nyoung children to gain knowledge about key aspects of\nhuman health in a fun and interactive manner. The pilot proj-\nect was introduced to five local primary schools. Working in\npairs, medical and nursing students developed and delivered\n1University of Dundee, UK\n2Dundee City Council, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nKevin McConville, Tayside Centre for General Practice, University of\nDundee, Mackenzie Building, Dundee DD1 4HN, UK.\nEmail: k.mcconville@dundee.ac.uk\nMedical Students' Child Health\nExperience in Primary Schools:\n\"The Best Day of Her Life\"\nFiona Muir1, Kevin McConville1, Lois Robertson1,\nKaren Campbell1, Shona McKnight2, and Kenny McKeown2\n Keywords\nschools, education, social sciences, teaching, students, medicine, medical sociology, sociology\n2 SAGE Open\nlessons across six afternoons to Primary 1 to Primary 7 pupils\nThe pilot enabled self-selected undergraduate health care\nstudents to work collaboratively while deepening their learn-\ning, developing their professional attributes, and the knowl-\nedge and skills to become competent teachers.\nWhile this innovative program meets some of the explicit\nrequirements of the General Medical Council Tomorrow's\nfills some of the Scottish Government's policy toward\nCurriculum for Excellence (Her Majesty's Inspectorate of\nEducation, 2009) and the Determined to Succeed Strategy\n(Scotland. Review Group on Education for Work and\nEnterprise., & Scotland. Scottish Executive, 2002)\nDue to its continued success, the pilot was the catalyst for\nembedding the experience into the core medical curriculum.\nA new community teaching experience, known as \"The\nChild Health Experience in Primary Schools\" for all Year 2\nmedical students (n = 176), was designed and implemented\nlocal primary schools for pupils aged 4 to 6 years. The proj-\nect was planned with academic staff and students, NHS staff\n(NHS Education for Scotland, 2011), employer engagement\nofficers within the education department, and schoolteach-\ners. There was ongoing discussion with the NHS consultant\nand specialist registrar in child health, and the child play\ntherapist. All stakeholders were engaged in the project devel-\nopment and its delivery. With the emphasis on IPE, students\nand staff engaged in learning with, from, and about each\nother to generate mutual benefit while inspiring, informing,\nand educating the primary school pupils they taught.\nWorking in pairs, medical students delivered health edu-\ncation activities to school pupils under the guidance of a pri-\nmary school teacher. The outcomes for both projects was to\ndevelop collaborative working while appraising the students'\nrole as a teacher; develop their communication and play with\nthe young child; develop their awareness of child health\ngrowth and development at an early stage in their career,\nwhile educating the young child about their body through\nplay and interaction; and apply the skill of teaching to\npractice.\nThis encounter encourages multidisciplinary groups, to\nnot only gain from each other's particular experience and\nprofessional approach but to respect different views and dif-\nferent perspectives in order to create something of great rel-\nevance to the community, as a whole, and not just the\nindividuals involved.\nThis study is different in character from other studies as\nmedical students are seldom given the opportunity to engage\nwith children, who are not recipients of care within a health\ncare framework or system, at an early stage in their career\nand within the community context, thus role modeling pro-\nfessional behaviors and providing an opportunity for a more\ndiverse spectrum of children to encounter \"health care\" in\nthe safety of their own classroom environment.\nThe projects provide the students with a real primary\nschool\u00adbased situation in which to talk to children about\nhealth promotion in a meaningful way. It strengthens simu-\nlated teaching and practice-based learning by allowing the\nstudents to develop many skills in relation to this topic and\ncommunication skills related to this user group. The inter-\nprofessional and collaborative nature of the projects further\nenhance their value to the children, schoolteachers, and stu-\ndent participants in relation to the benefits of teamwork, dis-\npelling the doctor authority and recognition of the roles of\nothers. The experiences are an interactive, enjoyable, and\nexpressive way in facilitating students', teachers', and school\npupils' learning, and in helping prepare the health care stu-\ndents for their child health experience in future years.\nThis partnership has been ongoing since its inception, and\nthe original project has continued to develop. There have\nbeen other collaborative developments. All participants are\nkept involved in the project through sharing of findings via\nlocal, national, and international channels including confer-\nence exhibits and workshops, poster presentations, local\nnewspaper articles, educational research projects, university\nmedia, and web press sites.\nMethod\nAim\nThe aim was to provide medical students with a new oppor-\ntunity to engage with children as part of a collaborative com-\nmunity experience.\nDesign\nMethodologically, this study has been influenced by evaluative\ninquiry (Preskill & Torres, 1999). The methodology was used\nto enhance learning in an organization, whereby the evaluating\nteam's role was that of an informed facilitator, providing the\nstructure for a process to evaluate the learning experience using\ndialogue, reflection, and challenge to distill learning opportuni-\nties, and to create a learning environment. Learning from eval-\nuative inquiry is a social construction occurring through the\ninvolvement of different groups, each representing different\nperspectives. It is socially situated and is mediated through par-\nticipants' knowledge and experiences. Evaluation culture is an\naccessible, teaching-orientated one that emphasizes the unity\nof formal evaluation and everyday thought.\nSituated within the qualitative paradigm of research, through\nthe collaboration of researchers and practitioners, the main data\ncollected were through an online self-completed questionnaire\nwhich respondents filled in for themselves. It was designed to\ngive all participants the freedom to respond and give their own\nopinions via free text responses (Thomas, 2010). This was effi-\ncient in terms of researchers' time and effort and enabled a\ngreater depth of meaning to explore the participant's experi-\nence, values, beliefs, thoughts, and feelings.\nMuir et al. 3\nThe questionnaires consisted of five key statements and\nmultiple substatements designed to ascertain the students'\nand teachers' experiences of the program. To gather data\nabout knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, question-\nnaires were used to gather information that is unique to indi-\nviduals. Participant groups (student, teacher, head teacher)\nwere given questionnaires with similar questions. The ques-\ntionnaire was adapted to reflect the individual group needs\nand offer insight into the impact of the context with free text\nanswers to open questions. Discrete categories to exhaust the\npossible responses which respondents may wish to give were\nbuilt into the questions (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2007).\nThe degree of responses, intensity of response, and the move\naway from dichotomous questions were managed by build-\ning in a degree of sensitivity and differentiation of response.\nThe questions within the questionnaire included the place-\nment and the participants perception of the child health expe-\nrience, how stimulating or interesting was the station, the\nvalue of the student engagement with the child, the value of\nthe preparatory lectures/small group work sessions, what did\nthey like best and least about the experience, suggestions for\nimprovement, and the main learning taken from the experi-\nence for their future career.\nQuestionnaires were helpful in maintaining participants'\nprivacy. The responses were anonymized; thus, confidential-\nity was maintained.\nProject evaluation and feedback from staff, students, and\npupils through dialogue, discussions around the activities,\nand opportunities for reflection have also been collated from\nthe start of the project. This dialogue allowed the researchers\nto \"hear\" how participants perceived and experienced these\npractices.\nParticipants\nThe Medical School delivers a 5-year integrated systematic\ndegree course. The program follows the structure of the spi-\ndomains of competence throughout the 5-year program.\nApproximately 165 students are admitted to the medical\ndegree program each year.\nteachers, and seven primary school head teachers were\ninvited to participate in the study, of which 163 students, 19\nteachers, and seven head teachers took part. All participants\nprovided consent at the beginning of the study period and\nwere advised that they could remove themselves from the\nstudy at any time without any prejudice to them.\nAs evidence of their teaching contribution and demon-\nstration of meeting the standards set within Good Medical\nPractice (General Medical Council, 2013) and Tomorrow's\nDoctors: Recommendations on Undergraduate Medical\nEducation students (General Medical Council, 2015), stu-\ndents received a teaching certificate to include within their\ne-portfolio.\nEthics Procedure\nDundee University Ethics Committee confirmed that the\nproject was carried out according to the ethical standards\nupheld by the University of Dundee. Ethical considerations,\nas defined in the British Educational Research Association\nGuidelines (British Educational Research Association,\n2011), were applied throughout the research.\nAnonymity and confidentiality assurances were given so\nthat the rights of the individuals were not compromised.\nParticipants were given introductory information via email\nand within the online questionnaire site with the details of\nthe study, why the study was being carried out, and the for-\nmat of the questionnaire. They were given the opportunity to\ndecline participation in the study at any time.\nA pilot study was conducted with two members of staff\nwho would not be participating in the main study.\nAnalysis\nOnline data were downloaded as a spreadsheet and codes\nadded to each respondent's questionnaire, in turn. The data\nwere checked for accuracy by a second researcher, a senior\nacademic. The data were then analyzed using an analytical\nprocess which involves a number of interconnected stages to\nclassify and organize data according to key themes, con-\ncepts, and emergent categories as they relate to the research\nquestion. Internal validity was assessed in various ways\nincluding reflexivity, triangulation, and peer judgment\n(Creswell & Miller, 2000). Triangulation and data validation\nwere informed by the level of consensus of the groups and\nconvergence among the different sources of information to\nform the themes in the study.\nIntroduction to Teaching\nAcademic staff and schoolteachers delivered preparatory\nsessions, for the students in Week 1, via lectures within the\nMedical School and small group\u00adfacilitated sessions within\nthe community. In Week 2, students prepared their lessons.\nDuring Weeks 3 and 4, the students delivered the teaching to\nthe primary school pupils.\nSix stations, with two students per station, were arranged\nat the schools. Themes for the activities or stations are based\non the \"Teddy Bear Hospital\" (European Medical Students\nAssociation, 2005). These include Oral health, It's an emer-\ngency/people who help us, Broken bones and Bandaging\nStation, What-a-Doctor-Uses/Medication, Teddy Surgery,\nand What's inside my body. Students are encouraged to be\ncreative in developing the sessions with the aim of reducing\nthe anxiety children experience of doctors and the hospital\nenvironment through fun, and within a safe learning environ-\nment. The Curriculum for Excellence learning intention and\nsuccess criteria (Learning and Teaching Scotland, 2009) were\nalso communicated, and included good lifestyle habits, such\n4 SAGE Open\nas healthy eating, the value of exercise, and encouraging chil-\ndren to be healthy and to learn more about the human body.\nThe aim is to supplement the experiences of children and\nyoung people aged 3 to 18 years throughout their education.\nResources are shared between the school of medicine and\nnursing, dental hospital, the education department, and pri-\nmary school, for example, clinical skills equipment, tooth-\nbrushes, teddy bears with anatomical parts, and the student's\nown creative resources.\nResults\nThe findings reported here are based on the data collated.\nWhere similarities in participant responses occurred, the\nresults from the three participant groups, medical students,\nprimary school teachers, and head teachers, have been com-\nbined, as illustrated below. The main themes identified are as\nfollows: the value of the experience, teaching skill develop-\nment, communication, overcoming challenges, preparatory\nsession, future opportunities, career progression, and teacher/\npupil observation.\nThe Value of the Experience\nThe value of the experience was the main recurring theme\nfor all participant groups. Medical students described the\nexperience as developing insight of the skills required for\nteaching in future practice; it enriched their medical curricu-\nlum; it was \"novel\" and original in its design while being\ndifferent from traditional teaching; students took pride in\nbeing role models for young children, and they were keen to\nhave a positive impact on the child and the communities that\nthey were entering; and the interactive nature of the sessions\nwas beneficial to all children and, in particular, to those chil-\ndren with special needs.\nStudents and teachers reported that the children engaged\nwith the activities and enjoyed the sessions; the children\nappeared keen to build on previous learning and relayed this\nto their teachers, demonstrating a sense of pride. The school-\nteachers and head teachers expressed gratitude toward the\nstudents and requested further student teaching opportunities\nand involvement in the schools; medical students discussed\nthe importance of being part of the community and having\nthe opportunity to give back to the community from an early\npoint in their careers.\nWe tried to make the station as interactive as possible. We used\na teddy to show the \"organs\" of the body, I made a fake bottle of\nblood to show how much blood goes through the heart . . . a\npiece of string to show the length of the intestines . . . a tennis\nball and tights to demonstrate \"peristalsis\" and a balloon to\ndemonstrate air flowing from the lungs, as well as visual\ndiagrams. I think this extra effort was definitely worthwhile\nbecause the children were able to take a \"hands on\" approach to\nthe station to aid their learning. (Student 121)\nThank you to all of the students for their hard work, enthusiasm\nand positive engagement with the class. (Teacher 2)\nThe children absolutely loved it. The Students were very good\nwith the children. The rest of P1 can't wait for their return.\n(Head Teacher 4)\nTeaching Skill Development\nThe experience helped the students develop their skill of\nteaching while learning from the \"experts\" and recognize the\nimportance of applying various teaching techniques for their\nfuture role as a teacher. Students spent time and effort creat-\ning and developing their lesson plans. This generated a sense\nof self-achievement and fulfillment.\n[The most valuable thing that I will take into my future career/\ncourse] . . . we have a role to educate as well. (Student 157)\nGreat experience overall . . . gave students hands on experience\nwith primary children. (Teacher 7)\nThe pupils had a wonderful time, lots of very well Teddies now!\nThank you for thinking of us! (Head Teacher 1)\nCommunication\nCommunicating with young people in the appropriate con-\ntext and at the developmental stage of the child, simplifying\nconcepts and long words, and the interactive nature of the\nstations were raised as \"important points\" by students and\nteachers.\nIt was so lovely to see the children so happy and a really good\nfun way of improving communication skills. It was so rewarding\nwhen the children spoke about how much they enjoyed our\nteaching and even one child described it as \"the best day of her\nI thought the medical students tried very hard to engage the\nchildren and gave the children positive feedback. (Teacher 10)\nIt was brilliant--great feedback from staff and children. Many\nthanks. (Head Teacher 3)\nOvercoming Challenges\nDuring the teaching sessions, the medical students faced\nsome challenges and developed a range of teaching strategies\nto overcome this. For example, they kept the children's atten-\ntion by adopting problem-solving techniques to their teach-\ning by adapting their stations; they asked about [the child's]\npersonal experiences, for example, a relative who had a bro-\nken bone; they gave rewards in the form of stickers as a tech-\nnique to reinforce good behavior. These techniques helped\nthe child interact more with the station. The children brought\nMuir et al. 5\ntheir past experiences to the discussion which, in turn, helped\nother pupils who were less familiar with health and\nwell-being.\nThis experience has helped me appreciate the importance of\nflexibility within teaching. As a teacher, of any age group, you\nmust be able to adapt your teaching style to fit your audience . .\n. accept when a concept is too difficult and have the adequate\nexperience to change your method of teaching. Finally, you\nmust have the skills to deliver your learning points in an\nenthusiastic and interesting way . . . I now realise that learning is\nachieved much more effectively by a captivated audience.\nA number of the students interacted very well with the children.\nThey used terms the children could understand and they had\nvisuals/props to demonstrate--young children respond well to\nthis and the students are to be commended for this. (Teacher 8)\nPreparatory Sessions\nStudents indicated that the preparatory sessions, delivered by\nthe university, helped them understand the project objectives\nwhich in turn supported the development of their lesson plan.\nThis set the experience in context for the students and know-\ning the relevance of the teaching gave the students an oppor-\ntunity to develop as adult learners; thus highlighting the\ncontribution of the multidisciplinary team involved in the\nproject.\nI liked the strong positive attitude from everyone about the\ncrosslinking between Medicine and Education and the real\nshared belief that what we were doing made a difference to\neveryone on both sides. (Student 11)\nAs a passionate teacher, I very much enjoyed talking about my\ncraft and equipping the students for working with young\nchildren. (Teacher 14)\nThe Future\nThere was a willingness from the students, teachers, and\nhead teachers to develop the project in the future. Students\nsuggested teaching older groups of children to see the child's\ndevelopmental progression while strengthening their com-\nmunication and teaching skills.\nHave the first teaching session aimed at young kids, e.g., P1 and\nthe second session aimed at older kids, e.g., P7. The\ncommunication skills needed to interact with each age group\nrespectively is also different [and] useful for us as students . . .\nWe would certainly like to be considered for visits in future\nyears. This was an excellent activity with enormous educational\nand living skills benefits. (Teacher 16)\nThe children absolutely loved it. The Students were very good\nwith the children. The rest of P1 can't wait for their return.\n(Head Teacher 4)\nCareer Progression\nThe child health experience informed students about the\nopportunities which exist for working with children in future\nyears: as a specialist in the field of pediatrics, emergency\nmedicine, an academic career, and an intercalated teaching in\nmedicine degree program.\nIt has inspired me to pursue a career in paediatrics. (Student 121)\nTeacher/Pupil Observation\nTeachers' relished the opportunity to observe their pupils\ninteracting with others, seeing how each child adapted to\nnew situations, information, and challenges.\nI was given the opportunity to observe my class, something we\nare rarely afforded the luxury of doing since we have no visiting\nspecialist staff anymore and there are not many external agencies\nwho offer opportunities to children of primary one age. I could\nsee how they interacted with other adults. I got the chance to\nwatch how carefully they listened, how well they how confident\nthey were in asking their own questions. (Teacher 8)\nDiscussion\nLiterature supports the need for health and medical profes-\nsionals to develop the skills and practices of a competent\nmentor and teacher for lifelong learning (Dandavino, Snell,\nthis may be the case, it is, at times, questioned whether stu-\ndents receive adequate opportunities to develop as teachers.\nThis project was innovative in its approach to solving this\nconcern. The value students' placed on opportunities to\ndevelop their teaching skills was evident by their apprecia-\ntion of the experience as educators now and in the future.\nLearning about teaching early in one's career can help stu-\ndents to have confidence in their abilities and thus a stronger\nteacher identity they can understand how they themselves\nlearn.\nCommunication skills development was a major theme\nemerging from the data. More specifically, students discussed\ndeveloping teaching skills and communicating in a different\nway from their past experiences. Communication and teach-\ning skill development, on the placement served, improved the\nstudents'confidence in their teaching role and for future prac-\ntice. Improved confidence and satisfaction from teaching/\ncommunicating effectively is likely to benefit their future\nteaching and ultimately enhance the comfort of patients while\nimproving learning of their future mentees (Crowe, Harris, &\nHam, 2000). Teaching improves communication skills and\n6 SAGE Open\nthe ability to explain concepts such as diseases or treatment in\na person-friendly manner (Prozesky, 2000). Within this study,\nmedical students' acknowledged that simplifying words and\nconcepts was one of the challenges they sought to overcome.\nWorking out how to deliver the information at the right level\nfor their audience, the students learned valuable and transfer-\nThe project was mutually beneficial for both the students\nand the primary schools involved, thus maximizing partner-\nship and contribution to the wider community (Dundee City\nScottish Government, 2012), while drawing upon specialist\nexpertise. Children were provided with novel and interactive\ninsight into health care by students with specialist knowledge.\nGiven the significance of policy documents, it would seem\nthat education providers can play a leading role in implement-\ning policies for lifelong learning (General Medical Council,\nStudents, teachers, and head teachers viewed the experi-\nence extremely positively, and the majority expressed a desire\nto continue with the project in the future. This study has dem-\nonstrated the feasibility of embedding practical teaching for\nstudents into the curriculum. Student data implied that multi-\nagency working was clearly valued. Working outside the hos-\npital environment and contributing to the community in a\nmeaningful way was repeated by the all participant groups.\nGoodhall (2012) suggests community participation, com-\nmunication skills, increased understanding and an apprecia-\ntion of nonmedical health support infrastructure in local\ncommunities is valued by students across the globe. The\nauthors believe the work undertaken by the Dundee project,\nfurther supports that developing working partnerships with\nthe community has value and meaning for the future.\nAlthough evidence around peer education among students\nexist, there would appear to be few opportunities for students\nto actively engage in teaching (Alcolado & Alcolado, 2011;\nMuir, McTaggart, & Bradey, 2011). Unlike this study whereby\nteaching is embedded into the curriculum, ensuring that every\nstudent has an experience of teaching during his or her pre-\nclinical years, it appears to be an \"opt in\" component of the\ncourse. Many students may never be exposed to the \"doctor\nas teacher\" role (Amorosa, Mellman, & Graham, 2011).\nThe majority of students in this study overcame a series of\n\"challenges\" by creative and problem-solving strategies and\npositive reinforcement which correlates with teaching strate-\ngies embedded deeply within a pedagogical approach to edu-\ncation (Isaksen, Stead-Dorval, & Treffinger, 2011; Sigler &\nAamidor, 2005). Students enhanced their learning, and their\npupils' learning, through the experience by enabling the\nmore knowledgeable pupils help others to learn (Kaufman,\nous teaching strategies, they were unaware of their signifi-\ncance for learning.\nAlthough there is an expectation for medical students to\nbe adult learners, they are not always treated as such\n(Goldman, 2009). There was some uncertainty around lesson\nplanning, and few students expressed a need for more guid-\nance. Adult learning theory supports the view that adults\nshould take responsibility for, and be able to self-direct, their\nlearning (Knowles, 2011). The significance of setting the\nteaching in context, allowing students to see its relevance\nduring the preparatory sessions, and giving them the oppor-\ntunity to apply themselves to the task creatively seeks to\neliminate this problem.\nThe integrated nature of the spiral curriculum allows stu-\ndents to apply what they have learned in their preclinical\nyears to their studies in later years (Harden, 1999). Students\nvalued exploring future teaching opportunities (Muir, 2014).\nA notable number also discussed the relevance of the task in\nrelation to pursuing careers in primary health care, pediat-\nrics, and emergency medicine. The teaching experience was\nviewed as an innovative and novel way of developing stu-\ndents' skills. Many of the students valued the originality of\nthe experience and enjoyed the variety that it brought to\ntheir course. Teachers' acknowledged the value of being\nable to \"stand back\" and observe their pupils interacting\nwith others.\nCompared with previous work, this qualitative method-\nological approach added value in that it facilitated a rich\nexploration of students', teachers' and head teachers' experi-\nence of developing community partnerships and experiences\nfor students. By building bridges of understanding between\nthe university and community, and involving students from\nthe start of their studies, it may be feasible to reduce the gap\nso that a genuine understanding of others' perspectives and\nefforts is achieved (Whealthall, Graham, & Turn, 1998).\nThe only theme identified for change, and one which\nwould enhance the process, was more communication\nbetween the university and the schools regarding the practi-\ncal setup of the teaching sessions. This will be addressed in\nthe next delivery of the program.\nLimitations of the Study\nThe study was intended to explore and gain an understanding\nof the project in its complexity and its entirety, as well as its\ncontext, and provide a rich description so that readers can see\nwhether the study is applicable to their situation or not. It\nmay in turn become a tentative hypothesis for further research\nFuture Considerations\nThe ultimate aim of this report was to describe learning from\nan evaluative inquiry and the outcomes to improve the stu-\ndent's understanding of the child, at an early stage in their\ncareer, while educating the young child about their body\nthrough play and interaction. The project is an interactive\nand fun way to facilitate students', teachers', and school\npupils' learning, and to help prepare the medical students for\nMuir et al. 7\ntheir child health experience in later years. The results from\nthe project evaluation, and the dedication and ongoing com-\nmitment from staff and students, have enabled further cur-\nriculum development with local secondary schools and for\nthe students studying the BMSc Teaching in Medicine inter-\nBoth external (education department and primary\nschools) and internal (School of Medicine and the NHS)\npartnerships have been created as a result of the project. The\nproject has benefitted all partners in meeting several other\npolicies including Interprofessional Learning IPL agenda\n(Centre for theAdvancement of Inter-Professional Learning,\n2014), Partnerships for Learning Education (Education\nScotland, 2012), and Transforming Lives Through Learning\n(Education Scotland, 2013). It supports the Medical School\ncurricula, and the needs of the primary schools and educa-\ntion department.\nThrough effective collaboration, the University and\nEducation Department have demonstrated, in a very tangible\nway, the importance both institutions place on real and prac-\ntical public engagement. In addition, the benefits to the com-\nmunity, as a whole, are also significant as the children at the\nschools not only enjoy their learning but also take some of\nthe lessons around healthy lifestyle home to their own fami-\nlies. They become partners in the process of potentially\nbringing about a cultural shift around the importance of\nhealth promotion and having a healthy lifestyle, something\nwhich is greatly needed in a city with real challenges around\nthe negative impression of deprivation and poverty on its\npopulation health.\nThis collaborative project embeds community engage-\nment within the undergraduate curriculum while encourag-\ning IPE through multiagency working. The developments\nhave been mutually amicable between all partners; there are\nno significant costs. This project continues to run each year,\nand a new Year 3 community school experience will be\ndelivered this coming year. Future possibilities include\nextending the project to include student nurses, dental stu-\ndents, or other members of the health care team and an evalu-\nation to look at the impact of programs on the different\nstakeholder groups.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAlcolado, R., & Alcolado, J.
