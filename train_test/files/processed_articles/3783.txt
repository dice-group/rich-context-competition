With regards to the study of\nsiblings, evolutionists have mainly focussed on sibling rivalry (Sulloway, 1996, 2001),\nsibling differentiation (Dunn and Plomin, 1991; Plomin and Daniels, 1987) and cues to\nincest avoidance (Bevc and Silverman, 1993, 2000; Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides,\n2003; Fessler and Navarrete, 2004). In comparison, relatively little attention has been paid\n1 Thomas Pollet is currently at: Department of Social and Organizational Psychology, University of\nGroningen, Grote Kruisstraat II, 9712TS, Groningen, The Netherlands.\nRelatedness and knowledge about death\nto studying actual investment between siblings. Emlen (1997) suggested however that\nindividuals will invest more in, and have closer relationships with, full siblings than half-\nsiblings or stepsiblings. There is some evidence for this prediction: both parents and\nchildren report more conflict between siblings when siblings are not fully related\n(Hetherington, 1988; Aquilino, 1991 for review, but see Kim, Hetherington, and Reiss,\n1999). Adult siblings also appear to invest more in fully related siblings than in half-\nsiblings (Pollet, 2007). Even when a society places a strong emphasis on treating all\nsiblings equal, regardless of their relatedness, siblings display more solidarity when fully\nrelated (Jankowiak and Diderich, 2000). Here, we examine whether relatedness affects\nbasic knowledge about whether or not a sibling is alive in a cohort of Dutch adults.\nKnowledge about whether a related individual is alive or not is required in order to\ninvest in them, and siblings who do invest will consequently have knowledge of their\ncurrent state. Our hypothesis is that respondents will be more likely to know whether a\nsibling is alive when they are fully related than when they are not. It is important to bear in\nmind that this hypothesis is at the ultimate level (Tinbergen, 1963), we are not testing\nwhich proximate mechanisms regulate investment in kin.\nOne could argue that growing up together, rather than genetic relatedness per se,\nknowledge about a siblings' death. Identity theory (Stets and Burke, 2000) suggests that\nindividuals who growing up together will learn to identify themselves as members of the\nsame family. This proximate theory would suggest that relatedness in most families is\nconfounded with being raised together. This confound of childhood co-residence can be\ndistinguished from relatedness by comparing not only paternal half-siblings with full\nsiblings but also maternal half-siblings with full siblings. Maternal half-siblings are brought\nup together just like full siblings, in contrast to paternal half-siblings (De Graaf, 1997;\nPollet, 2007). If we find a consistent difference between maternal half-siblings and full-\nsiblings, this suggests that genetic relatedness independently influences knowledge about a\nsibling's death. The scenario proposed by identity theory would not hold in this case.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe first wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (NKPS) dataset was\nobtained through the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI). The\nNKPS is a large scale longitudinal study, designed to investigate family and kin relations in\nthe Netherlands (Dykstra et al., 2004). The first wave was completed mid-2004; we used\nthe most recent version of the first wave dataset for this study (version of 21-7-05; main\nsample). The sampling procedure, representativeness, variables and survey method are\ndescribed in detail by Dykstra and colleagues (2004). In the NKPS, respondents are asked\nto list all their siblings (adopted, step, half- and full siblings) and to indicate whether they\nknow whether this sibling is alive or not. For each half-sibling we coded whether they were\npaternal or maternal. No data are available on whether stepsiblings are maternal or paternal.\nGiven the small numbers of adopted siblings (<1%), these were excluded from analyses.\nOur analyses thus contained four categories for sibling type (full sibling (FS), maternal\nhalf-sibling (MHS); paternal half-sibling (PHS); stepsibling (SS)). In this sample, if the\nparents of the respondent split up, the respondent virtually always remains in a family\nstructure containing their biological mother rather than remaining in a family structure\ncontaining their biological father (Pollet, 2007). Thus, maternal half-siblings, like full\nRelatedness and knowledge about death\nsiblings, are raised together, whereas paternal half-siblings are not.\nWe present data for the first six siblings. The vast majority (95.3%) of the total\nsample of respondents with siblings has six or fewer siblings. Starting from the seventh\nsibling, sample size becomes increasingly small for constructing multinomial logistic\nregression models (MLR's). For these six siblings we constructed separate multinomial\nlogistic regressions in order to investigate the independent effect of sibling type on\nPampel, 2000; Peng, Lee, and Ingersoll, 2002). Multinomial logistic regression is used to\npredict outcome variables of a categorical nature. It is relatively free of assumptions and\nstatistically robust. Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. As a parameter\nselection procedure, we used forward stepwise. Model outcomes were the same in terms of\nmodel fit and Nagelkerke R\u00b2 (Nagelkerke, 1991) when backward stepwise was used\ninstead. Besides relatedness, we entered the following control variables in our analysis:\neducation (9 categories: from incomplete/primary to university/postgraduate; treated as\ninterval), age, age differences between the siblings, gender of the respondent, and number\nof family transitions before age of 16. A family transition refers to an alteration in the\nrespondent's family living situation since birth, for instance going to live with grandparents\nor with another family member (see Dykstra et al., 2004 for more info on these variables).\nMissing values on these variables were deleted listwise. The descriptives for the sample are\nlisted in Table 1.\nFor each of the models we present odds ratios, Wald statistics and p values for the\nlikelihood ratio tests (pLLR\n). The odds ratio gives the relative odds of not knowing whether\nthe sibling is alive if the independent variables are changed in the specified way (e.g. a\ndifferent sibling type). Odds ratios for the control variables are not reported here and can be\nobtained from the author. The Wald statistic is used to test whether an odds ratio differs\nfor each variable is based on the difference\nin model fit (-2LogLikelihood; Pampel, 2000) between a model with the variable and one\nwithout, and is thus a measure of significance of effect of each independent variable. The\nNagelkerke R\u00b2 is a measure of variance explained by the overall model.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the sample.\nRelatedness and knowledge about death\nTable 1.

Other variables\nsuch as gender or age of the respondent did not consistently influence this knowledge.\nGiven that there are consistent differences not only between PHS and FS, but also between\nMHS and FS, in knowledge about a sibling's death we can conclude that genetic\nrelatedness in itself influenced this knowledge. Childhood co-residence cannot account for\nthe observed differences between maternal half-siblings and full siblings, as in both cases\nsiblings are raised together. Thus, we find support for Emlen's prediction (1997): full\nsiblings tend to have closer relationships than half-siblings or step-siblings.\nThis study dealt with an ultimate question and did not examine the proximate\nmechanisms regulating kin investment in detail. An obvious proximate mechanism that can\nexplain the observed difference between PHS and FS and between SS and FS is childhood\nco-residence. Both evolutionary theory and identity theory lead to suggest that being raised\ntogether should be an important cue to kinship. For example, childhood co-residence plays\na very important role for incest avoidance (e.g., Bevc and Silverman, 2000; Lieberman et\nal., 2003). Childhood co-residence can also be linked to the recently suggested role of the\nmaternal perinatal association (MPA), seeing your mother in close association with your\nsibling, for kinship detection (Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2007). We are not\nRelatedness and knowledge about death\nsuggesting that childhood co-residence and/or MPA is the only kinship cue governing\ninvestment but it is likely to be a very important one. Childhood co-residence and/or the\nMPA, however, cannot explain the differences between full siblings and maternal half-\nsiblings. It is likely that a cue such as third party knowledge, somebody telling an\nindividual that he or she is a fully related sibling to another person, might be important\nhere. However, such a cue can definitely be the sole cue regulating sibling investment: the\ndifferences between PHS and FS and SS and FS were far stronger than those between MHS\nand FS. This indicates that being raised together and the maternal perinatal association are\nlikely to be important cues in determining later investments. Thus, multiple kinship cues\naffect basic knowledge about a sibling's death. Further research is however necessary to\ndisentangle the relative importance of each kinship cue and how they interact in kin\ndetection.\nThe direct comparisons of SS and MHS, and PHS and MHS were not consistently\nsignificant. This is likely due to the small number of cases under comparison. Larger\nsamples are necessary to further explore the relative importance of relatedness compared to\nbeing raised together.\nIn conclusion, as kin selection theory (Hamilton, 1964) and Emlen (1997) lead to\npredict, genetic relatedness strongly affects an individual's knowledge about whether a\nsibling is alive or not. Individuals were significantly more likely to have basic knowledge\nabout their sibling when fully related, and such knowledge is likely to be symptomatic of\ntheir ongoing investments in that relationship.\n"
