Introduction\nObesity is a key public health issue for US youth, particularly\namong specific sociodemographic groups, including some\nracial/ethnic and sexual orientation groups [1, 2]. Obesity is\noperationalized as having a body mass index (BMI) equal\nto or greater than the 95th percentile among individuals\nyounger than age 18 years or a BMI of 30 or greater for\nindividuals age 18 years or older [3]. Previous research in\na primarily white cohort of youth and young adults, age\n12\u00ad23 years, found that sexual minority (nonheterosexually\nidentified) females had higher BMI than heterosexual females\nthroughout adolescence [4], similar to patterns seen in adult\nfemales [5]. Among males in this cohort, gay males had\nhigher BMI in early adolescence compared to heterosexual\nmales, but by late adolescence BMI among gay males was\nlower than their heterosexual peers [4], similar to patterns\nseen in adult males [6]. However, little is known about the\nintersection of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation and its\nimpact on youth weight status.\nA small number of studies have investigated sexual\norientation patterns in BMI among multiethnic samples of\nadults [7, 8]. One such study found that among females, white\nand African American sexual minorities were at increased\nrisk of being overweight compared to same-race/ethnicity\nheterosexual individuals, whereas among adult males, gay\nmales were less likely than heterosexuals to be overweight\namong white, African American, Asian, and Latino men [7].\nWe are aware of only one study with a representative sample of\nadolescents examining sexual orientation disparities in BMI\nin a multiethnic sample, which found that bisexual female\nand male youth were at elevated risk for obesity compared to\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nJournal of Obesity\n2 Journal of Obesity\nsame-gender heterosexual youth across race/ethnicity groups\n[9]. However, no research has explored whether an age-by-\norientation interaction effect exists in racial/ethnic minority\nyouth.\nDisparities in BMI among sexual minorities have been\nexplained primarily using the minority stress model, which\nsuggests that experiences of prejudice and discrimination\nbased on minority status negatively affect health [10]. Sexual\nminorities who are also racial/ethnic minorities may be at\ngreater risk for negative health outcomes due to experiences\nof minority stress based on being a member of multiple\nminority groups [11, 12]. Individuals may cope with minority\nstress by engaging in unhealthy weight-related behaviors.\nIndeed, research on sexual orientation, body image, and\neating disorders in primarily white samples of adults has\nsuggested that compared with heterosexuals, gay males\nindicated greater body dissatisfaction and eating disorder\nAn alternative explanation is that sexual orientation\ndisparities in BMI are related to sociocultural ideals regarding\nbody appearance. For instance, sexual minority male youth\nreported greater desire for muscularity, but fewer attempts\nto gain weight, compared to heterosexual male youth [15].\nAmong adult females, lesbian and bisexual individuals indi-\ncated lower internalization of sociocultural appearance ideals\nfor a thin body type compared to heterosexual females\n[14]. These findings may help to explain why sexual minor-\nity females have higher BMI and sexual minority males\nhave lower BMI, compared to their same-gender hetero-\nsexual counterparts. However, similar to research on sexual\norientation-by-gender disparities in obesity, this research\nwas conducted with primarily white samples. More research\nis needed to first identify whether sexual orientation-by-\ngender disparities in obesity exist in nonwhite racial/ethnic\ngroups and then to examine whether explanations for these\ndisparities apply across racial/ethnic groups.\nPrevious obesity prevention and intervention efforts have\nbeen only marginally successful, in part because they tend not\nto be appropriately tailored and instead use a one size fits all\napproach. In a recent review of school-based Internet obesity\nprevention programs for adolescents, a number of programs\ntargeted racial/ethnic minorities who are at greater risk for\nobesity and the majority of programs included content on\nnutrition and physical activity [16]. However, none of the\nprograms reviewed seemed to address issues related to sexual\norientation and obesity, such as body image or sociocultural\nideals of thinness and muscularity. More research is needed\nto identify subgroups most at risk for obesity by determin-\ning whether sexual orientation-by-gender disparities exist\nacross race/ethnicity groups, such that intervention and\nprevention efforts can be more effectively tailored for these\ngroups.\nThe transition from adolescence to young adulthood is a\ncritical period for weight gain and the development of obesity,\nwith long-term negative health implications for excessive\nweight gain during young adulthood [17, 18]. In addition,\nprevious research has indicated that associations between\nsexual orientation and BMI change across adolescence and\ninto young adulthood [4]. Longitudinal research with nation-\nally representative samples of adolescents is needed to address\nwhether age-by-sexual orientation effects exist among non-\nwhite youth. To address this question and to inform obesity\nprevention and weight-loss intervention efforts, the current\nstudy used longitudinal data from Waves I\u00adIV of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to\nexamine sexual orientation disparities in BMI over time\nwithin female and male race/ethnicity groups. Specific sexual\nminority subgroups were compared separately to heterosex-\nual individuals because previous research has found BMI\nand obesity prevalence to differ among these subgroups, with\nbisexual individuals at particularly high risk for elevated\nBMI and obesity [9, 19]. We hypothesized that female sexual\nminorities, particularly bisexual individuals, would have\nconsistently higher BMI over time than heterosexual females.\nWe further hypothesized that heterosexual males would\nexperience greater one-year increases in BMI compared to\ngay males. Finally, we hypothesized that these patterns would\nbe similar across all three racial/ethnic groups.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Sample. After exclusion criteria were applied\n(described below), the current sample included 7,140 females\nand 6,166 males, who contributed data to at least one of\nthe four waves of Add Health, a US nationally represen-\ntative longitudinal cohort [20]. Participants were age 11\u00ad21\nprovided a report of sexual orientation identity at Wave III\nand self-identified as non-Latino white (59%), non-Latino\nblack/African American (23%), and Latino (18%) at Wave I.\nOther race/ethnicity groups were excluded due to a small\nsample size within some sexual orientation groups. Descrip-\ntive statistics for age and BMI by race/ethnicity, gender,\nand sexual orientation are reported in Table 1. This study\nwas approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional\nReview Board.\n2.2. Measures. Sexual orientation identity was assessed at\nWave III with one item asking participants to choose the\ndescription that best fits how they think about them-\nselves, with the following response options: 100% hetero-\nsexual (straight); mostly heterosexual (straight), but some-\nwhat attracted to people of your own sex; bisexual, that is,\nattracted to men and women equally; mostly homosexual (gay),\nbut somewhat attracted to people of the opposite sex; 100%\nhomosexual (gay); not sexually attracted to either males or\nfemales. Gender was assessed at Wave I as female or male.\nRace and ethnicity were assessed separately at Wave I but\nrecoded and combined into the following groups for anal-\nysis: non-Latino white, non-Latino black/African American,\nand Latina/o. Age in years and age-specific BMI (kg/m2)\ncalculated from self-reported height and weight were assessed\nat each wave. Self-reported height and weight were used\nbecause measured height and weight were not available at all\nfour waves.\nJournal of Obesity 3\n2.3. Statistical Analysis. To test the hypotheses, we conducted\nlongitudinal unweighted linear generalized estimating equa-\ntion analyses in SAS (version 9.3; Cary, NC). Data were\nanalyzed in 2013. Analyses were stratified by gender and\nrace/ethnicity, with heterosexual as the reference group. For\nthe current study, participants who responded that they were\nnot sexually attracted to either gender were excluded from the\nanalyses, and mostly homosexual and 100% homosexual were\ncombined into lesbian/gay due to small sample sizes, yielding\nthe following sexual orientation identity groups: heterosexual,\nmostly heterosexual, bisexual, and lesbian/gay. To address\nthe nonlinearity of BMI across development [21\u00ad23], age\nwas modeled both linearly and quadratically and sexual\norientation-by-age was used to model repeated measures of\ncontinuous BMI across ages 11\u00ad34 years, with age and BMI\nupdated at each wave.\nWeights are typically used in analysis of data from Add\nHealth to allow for population estimates. We conducted\nunweighted analyses because the complexity of the models in\nexamining BMI trajectories across waves and accounting for\nclustering by schools did not allow for the incorporation of\nweights. In addition, a model-based analysis is reasonable if\ndesign effects are taken into account [24], which the current\nanalysis did by adjusting for gender, race/ethnicity, and age.\n3. Results\nSexual orientation and race/ethnicity group differences in\nmean age at each wave were found. Among females, bisex-\nuals and mostly heterosexual individuals were significantly\nyounger (bisexual range: 0.33 to 0.43 years; mostly heterosex-\nsignificant sexual orientation group differences were found\namong males for mean age at each wave. Among both females\nand males, Latinos were significantly older (female range:\nsame-gender non-Latinos at all waves,  < 0.0001. In\naddition, non-Latina black/African American females were\nsignificantly older (0.15 years) than non-Latina white females\nDescriptively, among both females and males across sex-\nual orientation and race/ethnicity groups, age-specific BMI\nincreased substantially across time from age 11 to 34 years\n(Table 1, Figure 1). Among females, the association between\nsexual orientation and BMI did not differ significantly by\nage, so sexual orientation-by-age interaction terms were not\nincluded in the final models. Non-Latina white and Latina\nbisexual individuals had higher BMI compared to their het-\nerosexual female counterparts, while no sexual orientation\ndifferences were observed among non-Latina black/African\nAmerican females (see Table 2, Figure 1).\nAmong males, the association between sexual orientation\nand BMI differed significantly by age within each of the three\nrace/ethnicity groups. Gay males had higher BMI than het-\nerosexual males in early adolescence. However, heterosexual\nmales showed greater one-year BMI gains over time surpass-\ning gay males by approximately age 17 years, with disparities\nwidening further as participants aged into adulthood (see\nTable 2, Figure 1). Bisexual individuals showed a different\npattern, with bisexual males showing greater one-year BMI\ngains over time compared to heterosexual males, but only\namong non-Latino white participants.\n4. Discussion\nPrevious research with a predominantly white cohort of\nyouth found that age modified sexual orientation disparities\nin BMI in males. The current research extended these findings\nto non-Latino black/African American and Latino young\nmen. During adolescence and young adulthood, heterosexual\nmales demonstrated greater yearly increases in BMI com-\npared to gay males, putting them at excess risk for obesity. It is\nnot clear why these patterns are emerging, but reporting bias\ncould be one factor. A prior Add Health analysis found that\ngay males underreport their BMI by an estimated 0.37 BMI\nunits more than heterosexual males [25]; nevertheless, bias of\nthis magnitude would not be sufficiently large to explain the\ndifferences observed in the current study. Another potential\nexplanation for smaller increases in BMI among gay males\nmay be that compared to heterosexual males, gay males are\nat greater risk for body dissatisfaction and eating disorder\nsymptomatology, which may result in lower BMI over time\n[13, 14]. Other research has suggested that sexual minority\nmale adolescents and young adults are less likely to attempt\nto gain weight compared to completely heterosexual male\nyouth [15], which may represent a protective factor against the\ndevelopment of obesity among sexual minority male youth.\nThis study also found higher BMI among bisexual\nnon-Latina white and Latina females compared to same-\nrace/ethnicity heterosexual females, but not in other sex-\nual minority female subgroups. It is possible that bisexual\nfemales may be responding to sexual minority stressors\n(e.g., increased rates of victimization) [26] by engaging in\nobesogenic behaviors (e.g., stress-induced binge eating) [27],\nmore so than other sexual minority females or gay males.\nHigher BMI among bisexual females may also be attributable\nto comorbidity of obesogenic behaviors with other health\nrisk behaviors and negative health outcomes. For instance,\nother research has indicated that bisexual females are at\ngreater risk for psychological distress [28] and health risk\nbehaviors, including substance use [29] and self-injurious\nbehavior [30], compared to other sexual orientation groups.\nA recent study found that compared to lesbians, bisexual\nwomen are more likely to use maladaptive coping strategies,\nwhich may explain more adverse mental and physical health\noutcomes in bisexual females compared to lesbian females\n[28]. Results from the current study highlight the need for\nresearch on health outcomes within sexual minority sub-\ngroups, in addition to comparing sexual minorities with com-\npletely heterosexual individuals. In addition, more research\nis needed to understand why bisexual females and males\nand heterosexual males have greater risk for increased BMI\nand whether membership in other sexual orientation groups\nmay confer specific protective factors against weight gain and\ndevelopment of obesity.\n4 Journal of Obesity\nTable 1: Descriptive statisticsa for ageb and BMIc by race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation among 7,140 female and 6,166 male adolescents and young adults in the US National\nNon-Latino white\nFemales Males\nHeterosexual\nMostly\nheterosexual\nBisexual\nLesbian\nHeterosexual\nMostly\nheterosexual\nBisexual\nGay\nBMI\nNon-Latino black/African American\nFemales Males\nHeterosexual\nMostly\nheterosexual\nBisexual\nLesbian\nHeterosexual\nMostly\nheterosexual\nBisexual\nGay\nBMI\nLatina/o\nFemales Males\nHeterosexual\nMostly\nheterosexual\nBisexual\nLesbian\nHeterosexual\nMostly\nheterosexual\nBisexual\nGay\nBMI\naMeans are reported with standard deviations in parentheses.\nbAge is in years.\ncBMI was measured as kg/m2.\nJournal of Obesity 5\nTable 2: Sexual orientation differences in BMIa in 7,140 female and 6,166 male adolescents and young adults in the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Waves I\u00adIV\nMeasure\nNon-Latino white Non-Latino black/African American Latina/o\nFemale Male Female Male Female Male\nSexual orientation\nHeterosexual (ref) (ref) (ref) (ref) (ref) (ref)\nSexual orientation \u00d7 age\nHeterosexual -- (ref) -- (ref) -- (ref)\naBMI was measured as kg/m2.\nbSignificant effects are bolded.\ncAge and age2 were centered on the mean age in the sample: 20.5 years.\n6 Journal of Obesity\nHeterosexual\nMostly heterosexual\nBisexual\nLesbian/gay\nHeterosexual\nMostly heterosexual\nBisexual\nLesbian/gay\nAge (years)\nNon-Latina white females Non-Latino white males\nNon-Latina\nblack/African American females\nNon-Latino\nblack/African American males\nLatina females Latino males\nBMI (kg/m2)\nAge (years)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nAge (years)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nAge (years)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nAge (years)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nAge (years)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nFigure 1: BMI trajectories by sexual orientation across race/ethnicity groups of adolescents and young adults in the US National Longitudinal\nJournal of Obesity 7\n5. Conclusions\nFindings from this study demonstrated that sexual orienta-\ntion and gender differences in BMI are not limited to non-\nLatino white youth and young adults. Among males, hetero-\nsexual males showed greater one-year BMI gains than gay\nmales across all race/ethnicity groups. Among females, non-\nLatina white and Latina bisexual individuals had higher BMI\nthan same-race/ethnicity heterosexual individuals regardless\nof age; there were no sexual orientation differences in non-\nLatina black/African Americans. It is clear from these results\nthat sexual orientation disparities in BMI are a public health\nconcern across race/ethnicity groups. Obesity prevention and\nintervention efforts should target healthy body image and\nweight-management methods for all youth, but additional\nresources may be needed for sexual minority youth. In par-\nticular, interventions should be designed in such a way as to\nnot exacerbate risk of unhealthy weight control behaviors and\neating disorders. In summary, obesity prevention initiatives\nand treatment interventions addressing unhealthy weight\ngain in adolescence and young adulthood must be relevant\nfor all sexual orientations and race/ethnicities.\nConflict of Interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\n"
