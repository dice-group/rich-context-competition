Maternal and infant characteristics were obtained\nthrough self-report measures.\nResults: There were no differences in attachment clas-\nsification between infants of adolescent mothers and non-\nadolescent mothers. Secure attachment classification was\nfound in 67% of the infants of adolescent mothers and\n62% of the infants of nonadolescent mothers. There were\nsignificant differences in the self-reported maternal char-\nacteristics. Adolescent mothers reported lower self-\nesteem (P.05), more parenting stress (P.05), more\nchild abuse potential (P.05), and provided a lower qual-\nity of home environment (P.05) than nonadolescent\nmothers. Adolescent mothers also rated their infants as\nhaving a higher activity level (P.05) than infants born\nto nonadolescent mothers. In multivariate analysis, none\nof these variables or social classes were found to affect\nattachment classification.\nConclusions: Infants of adolescent and nonadolescent\nmothers show similar patterns of attachment. Adoles-\ncent and nonadolescent mothers show substantial dif-\nferences in parenting characteristics and in how they rate\ntheir infants' temperaments. However, these differences\ndo not seem to impair the infant-mother attachment re-\nlationship.\nADOLESCENT mothers are\nthought to lack the skills\nto adequately mother their\ninfants. Findings suggest\nthat adolescent mothers\nprovide less optimal caregiving, less sen-\nsitivity to their infants' cues, less interac-\ntive sensitivity, and less emotional and\nverbal responsiveness than nonadoles-\ncent mothers.1-4 Observation of the home\nenvironment suggests that adolescent\nmothers provide a less than optimal set-\ntingfortheirchildren,includinglessstimu-\nlation, inconsistent learning environ-\nments, more negative interaction, more\nrestrictive, irritable, hostile, and punitive\nresponses, and a tendency to choose physi-\ncal rather than verbal modalities during in-\nteraction with their children.1,4-8\nThese concerns about the parenting\nabilitiesofadolescentmothershavebeenat-\ntributed to their lack of knowledge about\nchild development in general, a poor un-\nderstanding of their infants' developmen-\ntal abilities, and, probably related, the\ntendency to rate their infants' behavior or\ntemperament as being more difficult.6,9,10\nThe offspring of adolescent mothers are\nthought to be at risk for poor outcome in\nchildhood, including behavior problems,\npoor communicative skills, cognitive im-\npairment, and school failure.11-17 One pos-\nsible source of later problems in the off-\nspring of adolescent mothers is early\nimpairment in the mother-child attach-\nment relationship. If adolescent mothers\nprovide less optimal and/or less sensitive\ncaregiving to their infants, it is reasonable\nto hypothesize that the quality of the at-\ntachment relationship would be compro-\nmised in adolescent mother-infant dyads.\nDespite nearly 3 decades of research\nsince the advent of the Ainsworth Strange\nSituation18 to qualify the attachment rela-\ntionship in a behavioral observation set-\nting, surprisingly little is known about at-\nARTICLE\nFrom the Infant Development\nCenter, Women and Infants'\nHospital (Drs Andreozzi and\nLester and Ms Brunner);\nDepartments of Pediatrics\n(Drs Flanagan, Seifer, and\nLester) and Psychiatry and\nHuman Behavior (Drs Seifer\nand Lester), Brown Medical\nSchool, Rhode Island Hospital;\nand Bradley Hospital\n(Drs Seifer and Lester),\nProvidence, RI.\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association.

All sub-\njects were initially recruited to be part of a prospective study\naimed at examining the effects of maternal lifestyles dur-\ning pregnancy on a variety of infant outcomes. The MLS is\na multisite (Providence, Miami [Fla], Memphis [Tenn], and\nDetroit [Mich]) longitudinal study of the effects of prena-\ntal cocaine/opiate exposure on child outcome conducted\nunder the auspices of the National Institute on Child Health\nand Human Development Neonatal Research Network. Ado-\nlescent mothers (18 years) were excluded from MLS.\nTherefore, we recruited a separate cohort of adolescent\nmothers for the current study. Recruitment of the adoles-\ncent cohort occurred in parallel to recruitment for MLS and\nfollowed the same study protocol. The MLS sample in-\ncludes a group of infants exposed to cocaine/opiates and a\ncomparison group of infants not exposed. Exposure was\ndetermined by a meconium toxicology screen followed by\ngas chromatography/mass spectrometry confirmation and/or\nself-report.30 Only mothers who denied cocaine/opiate use\nand whose infants showed negative meconium results were\nincluded in the comparison group. This comparison group\nformed the older mother group for the current study. Ma-\nternal report and meconium testing were also used to verify\nthat mothers in the adolescent group did not use cocaine\nand/or opiates during this pregnancy. In addition, be-\ncause we were interested in the mother-infant attachment\nrelationship, only biological mothers who had been living\nwith the paired infants since birth and had been the pri-\nmary caretakers of these infants were included. Primary care-\ntaker was determined by maternal responses to the follow-\ning questions: \"Who makes decisions about the baby's care?\"\n\"Who bathes and changes the baby?\" \"Who feeds the baby\nduring the day and at night?\" \"Who plays with the baby the\nmost?\" This information was collected at various time pe-\nriodsthroughoutthestudy.Informationregardingtheamount\nof care provided by other caretakers, such as relatives or day\ncare centers, was not collected. Subjects from the adoles-\ncent group were not included if they did not complete the\nresearch procedure (9 subjects), technical problems were ex-\nperienced during videotaping (7), the mother was not pres-\nent for the assessment and another caregiver was used (1),\nor the mother was not the primary caregiver (1). The re-\nmaining 51 subjects comprised the adolescent sample.\nSubjects were excluded from the sample of older mothers\nbecause the mother was not the primary caregiver (1) or\ndata were incomplete (3). The total number of subjects in\nthe nonadolescent sample was 76. The mother-infant dy-\nads were seen when the infants were aged 1, 4, 8, 10, and\nMEASURES\nOne Month Old\nDemographicandmedicalinformationincludedmaternaledu-\ncation,race,parity,numberofprenatalcarevisits,birthweight,\ngestational age, sex, 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, and the\namount of alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use during this\npregnancy.Becauseofthenatureofobtaininginformationvia\nself-report, sample sizes reflected in the tables may not total\nN. A continuous measure of SES or index of social position\nwas computed. This measure was derived from a variety of\nfactors,includingoccupation,contributiontohouseholdin-\ncome, and education. A higher score reflects higher SES.\nFour Months Old\nParenting stress was measured using the Parenting Stress In-\nventory (PSI).31 This 36-item short-form PSI measures stress\nrelated to parenting. The mother rates each item on a 5-point\nLikert scale ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly dis-\nagree.\" The PSI yields 3 subscales and a summary index of\ntotal stress. This was the only summary index used in this\nstudy. Higher scores reflect more parenting stress.\nMaternal depression was assessed using the Beck De-\npression Inventory.32 The Beck Depression Inventory is a\n21-item self-report scale that measures symptoms of de-\npression. Scale item responses range from zero to 3 and items\nare summed to obtain an overall score. A higher score re-\nflects more depressive symptoms.\nMaternal psychological distress was measured with the\nBrief Symptom Inventory,33 a 53-item questionnaire that\nis the short form of the Revised 90-item Symptom Check-\nlist. The Brief Symptom Inventory yields 9 primary symp-\ntom dimensions as well as a global severity index. Higher\nscores reflect more psychological distress. Only the global\nscore was used.\nInfant temperament was assessed with the Infant Be-\nhavior Questionnaire.34 The Infant Behavior Question-\nnaire is a 90-item questionnaire administered to the mother\nto measure her perceptions of the infant's temperament\nand behavior in everyday situations. This measure yields\n6 summary scales: Activity Level, Smiling and Laughter,\nContinued on next page\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association.

First, we\nwanted to study the attachment relationship in infants\nof adolescent mothers in a sample with an appropriate\ncomparison group of older mothers and with sufficient\nstatistical power to detect hypothesized differences. Sec-\nond, we wanted to study maternal factors thought to dif-\nferentiate adolescent mothers from older mothers that\nmight be related to hypothesized differences in attach-\nment.Thefactorsincludeddepression,self-esteem,parent-\nDistress to Approach Sudden or Novel Stimuli, Distress to\nLimitations, Soothability, and Duration of Orienting.\nEight Months Old\nThe Child Abuse Potential Inventory35 is a 77-item self-\nreport scale that examines maternal psychological difficul-\nties such as distress, rigidity, and unhappiness, and also in-\nteractional problems experienced by the mother, such as\nproblems with self, family, or others. Scores are generated\nfor each of the factors and a total score. Only the total score\nwas used.\nTen Months Old\nMaternal self-esteem was assessed via the Maternal Self-\nReport Inventory.36 The Maternal Self-Report Inventory is\na 26-item scale that yields a total score that reflects the moth-\ner's self-esteem. A higher score indicates increased self-\nesteem.\nThe Home Observation for Measurement of the En-\nvironment (HOME)37 was administered during a home visit.\nThis instrument is useful for measuring the social and emo-\ntional support available within the infant's home.37 The 45\nscale items are scored on the basis of observations of the\nhome and on interviews with the mother. Only the total\nscore was used.\nEighteen Months Old\nMothers brought their children to the hospital clinic for\nassessment of attachment using the Ainsworth Strange Situ-\nation.18 The Strange Situation is a laboratory procedure con-\nsisting of 8 episodes in which the mother and child inter-\nact with each other and with a stranger unknown to the\ninfant, and then they are separated from and reunited with\neach other. The procedure is videotaped and infant attach-\nment classifications are assigned based on coding of the vid-\neotape.\nInfants are classified as secure (B) or 1 of 2 categories\nof insecure attachment: insecure-avoidant (A) or insecure-\nresistant (C).18 Infants in the B category derive comfort from\ntheir mothers as evidenced by seeking proximity to her. At\nthe same time, B infants display a willingness to explore\nthe environment. Infants in the A category may ignore or\nsnub the mother on reunion. Infants in the C category may\nshow a mixture of seeking and resisting contact with the\nmother. These infants may display much distress and an-\nger regarding the mother's departure. In addition, some in-\nfants are classified as disorganized (D).38 Infants in the D\ncategory lack a clear attachment strategy and may display\nodd or disoriented behavior such as freezing, stilling,\naffective instability, or apprehension of the mother. D is\nnot a mutually exclusive category. Infants may be classi-\nfied into 1 of the above 3 categories and also as D. Some\ninfants may display a mixture of both avoidant and resis-\ntant strategies and are classified as A/C. These infants also\nreceive a D classification. Occasionally, infants may not be\nable to be classified into one of the above categories and\nare deemed unclassifiable (U).\nOur hypothesis was that infants of adolescent mothers would\nmore often be classified as insecure than secure. There-\nfore, consistent with previous research, for data analysis\nto compare secure vs insecure, we combined the number\nof infants in the A and C categories and compared them\nwith the number of infants in the B category. Infants clas-\nsified as either A/C or U were omitted from the analyses.\nSeparate analyses that included A/C and U categories (data\nnot shown) were conducted and yielded the same results\nincluded in this report. This classification scheme is well\nestablished and was implemented by the first author after\ntraining and certification by the third author. Interrater re-\nliability of the adolescent sample was evaluated on 20% of\nthe sample with another independent certified coder (S.B.)\nand was 94%. The older mother sample was coded by ei-\nther of the 2 certified coders.\nWe recognized the difficulty of maintaining blindness\nin this study due to the physical appearance of the adoles-\ncent mothers. To help address this issue and strengthen\nthe study findings, we included 11 additional Strange Situ-\nation tapes that had been previously scored from another\ngroup of mothers aged 18 to 20 years with the tapes of the\nadolescent sample. These tapes were not identified but\nwere recoded as part of the pool of adolescent tapes and\nwere found to have classifications identical to their origi-\nnal scoring, suggesting that scoring bias may not have\noccurred.\nPower analysis was conducted to determine if a sta-\ntistically significant (P.05) difference in the proportion\nof infants of adolescent vs older mothers classified as se-\ncure (B) vs insecure (A or C) could be detected with this\nsample size. The power was .87, which was adequate.39\nStatistical analyses included t tests for continuous data\nand 2 tests for categorical data to compare demographic,\nmedical (Table 1 and Table 2), and maternal psycho-\nlogical characteristics (Table 3) between the 2 groups. A\n2 test was used to compare the distribution of attachment\nclassification categories between the 2 groups (Table 4)\nand logistic regression to predict attachment classifica-\ntion from maternal age group, sociodemograhic, and ma-\nternal psychological characteristics (Table 5).\n\u00a92002 American Medical Association.

One infant in the adolescent sample and 6\ninfants in the nonadolescent sample were unable to be\nclassified. There were 3 infants in the adolescent group\nand 5 infants in the nonadolescent group that showed a\nmixed (A/C) classification. In addition, 10% of the in-\nfants in the adolescent group and 19.7% of the infants\nin the nonadolescent group were rated as D.\ncure (A or C) in the adolescent group and 18 infants\n(23.6%) classified as insecure (A or C) in the nonado-\nlescent group. There were no differences in the number\nof secure vs insecure infants between the 2 groups\nin the number of disorganized infants between the 2\nsults was significant, indicating that there was no differ-\nence in the proportion of insecurity or disorganization\nbetween the 2 groups. Additional analyses were con-\nducted to determine if attachment classifications dif-\nfered according to other variables of interest, such as race/\nethnicity, sex, birth weight, and gestational age. There\nwere no differences between each of these variables and\nattachment classification.\nCHARACTERISTICS\nTable 3 presents the means and SDs for the maternal self-\nreport and the home observation measures. There were\nno differences between adolescent and nonadolescent\nmothers in symptoms of depression (Beck Depression In-\nventory) or level of psychological distress (Brief Symp-\ntom Inventory). However, compared with nonadoles-\ncent mothers, adolescent mothers showed more parenting\nstress (PSI), lower maternal self-esteem (Maternal Self-\nReport Inventory), a higher child abuse potential (Child\nAbuse Potential Inventory), a higher activity level in their\ninfant's temperament (Infant Behavior Questionnaire),\nand provided a less adequate home environment (HOME).\nResults of the logistic regression predicting secure\nvsinsecureattachmentclassificationarepresentedinTable\n5. As planned, variables used in the logistic regression,\nin addition to the adolescent or the nonadolescent group,\nwere those variables that differentiated between these\n2 groups, which might \"explain\" attachment. The logis-\ntic regression showed a nonsignificant 2 test (2=5.6,\nP.05) and no significant odds ratios for any of the in-\ndividual predictor variables, suggesting that none of these\nfactors were related to attachment classification.\nCOMMENT\nThree of 5 previously published studies found no in-\ncrease in secure vs insecure attachment classification us-\ning the Ainsworth Strange Situation in infants of adoles-\nanother sample of adolescent mothers as the compari-\nson group.22 The remaining study used the Ainsworth\nsample18 for comparison.20 In findings from cross-\ncultural normative studies, the modal classification is\nnoted as secure (B).40 The previously mentioned meta-\nanalysis40 identified the Ainsworth sample18 as the cri-\nterion standard. In this sample, approximately 66% of in-\nfants were classified as securely attached.18 This is virtually\nidentical to our finding of 66.7% secure attachment in\nthe adolescent group. Ours is the largest study to date,\nto our knowledge, with sufficient power to suggest that\nlack of differences between adolescent and nonadoles-\ncent mothers was probably not due to a type II error.\nMoreover, ours is the only study, of adolescent mothers\nto deal with the issue of examiner blindness. Our find-\nings suggest that infants of adolescent mothers may re-\nsemble normative samples in the prevalence of secure at-\ntachments to their mothers.\nWe did find, consistent with other findings, differ-\nences between adolescent and nonadolescent mothers on\ndemographic and parenting factors. Differences on de-\nmographic factors, such as SES, marital status, parity, and\neducationare,ofcourse,tobeexpected.Othershavefound\nlower self-esteem,41,42 higher levels of depression,42 higher\nchild abuse potential scores,11 and poorer quality home\nenvironments among adolescent mothers.5 Differences\nin how adolescent mothers perceive their infant's tem-\nperament have also been reported.10 Our findings were\nsimilar. We found more parenting distress, lower mater-\nnal self-esteem, higher child abuse potential scores, and\npoorer quality home environment in adolescent moth-\ners. In addition, these mothers perceived their infants as\nhaving a more active temperament than nonadolescent\nmothers perceived. Although there is reason to suspect\nthat these factors would contribute to infant attachment\nclassification, we found no such relationships. The com-\nTable 5.

All rights reserved.\nbination of adolescent or nonadolescent mother group,\nsociodemographic, and parenting factors in the logistic\nregression was unrelated to secure or insecure attach-\nment classification. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to determine if parenting factors predict attach-\nment classification in adolescent mothers. It is interest-\ning that factors theoretically shown or assumed to affect\nthe quality of the attachment relationship, such as ma-\nternal self esteem, parenting stress, SES, and psychologi-\ncal distress, were unrelated to attachment in this study.\nThese findings support the robustness of the attach-\nment relationship and the results reported herein.\nThe Ainsworth Strange Situation18 has been widely\nused and is acknowledged as the criterion standard\nmethod for measuring attachment.40 In addition to nor-\nmative studies, this procedure has been found to differ-\nentiate among other areas of study, including abuse and\nin mothers,25,27 and cross-cultural differences in Israel,46\nJapan,47 and Germany.48 Therefore, we do not attribute\nour lack of differences between adolescent and nonado-\nlescent mothers to problems with the procedure. In ad-\ndition, our coders were well trained, and as mentioned\nearlier we did attempt to determine if there was bias due\nto the appearance of the adolescent mothers.\nA more likely explanation for our findings is that\nthe attachment system is robust and difficult to impair\nand may not be compromised by factors such as adoles-\ncent parenting or the maternal factors that we studied.\nThis is consistent with attachment theory, in which at-\ntachment is viewed as a proximity promoting system im-\nportant for survival.49\nWe did find important differences between adoles-\ncent and nonadolescent mothers. Adolescent mothers\nshowed more parenting distress, lower maternal self-\nesteem, higher child abuse potential scores, poorer qual-\nity home environments, and perceived their infants as\nbeing more active. In other studies, similar factors have\nbeen shown to affect child outcome.50,51 The differences\nfound in the adolescent sample may affect aspects of the\nchild (ie, behavior and development) that we did not mea-\nsure. Therefore, these factors may still affect offspring of\nadolescent mothers even if they do not affect the attach-\nment relationship.\nWe did not measure other aspects of adolescent\nmothers that could have influenced our results, such as\nsocial support and the adolescent mother's developmen-\ntal level and knowledge of child development. It has been\nsuggested51 that adolescent parenting may not invari-\nably be associated with adversity. The developmental pro-\ncess may affect the mothering experience of adolescents\nand provide opportunities for intervention.51\nAlthough the Strange Situation and the HOME were\nbased on direct observation, other measures were based\non self-report (stress, depression, temperament, etc). It\nis possible that study findings would differ with more ob-\njective measures of some of these factors.\nAlthough adolescent mothers are often portrayed as\ndisadvantaged and they clearly differ from nonadoles-\ncent mothers in potentially important areas of parent-\ning, our findings add to a growing body of literature sug-\ngesting that the ability of these mothers to maintain a\nsecure attachment relationship with their infants is simi-\nlar to that of mothers in the general population. This and\nother research suggest that adolescent mothers may not\nbe a homogeneous group--that there are important in-\ndividual differences in the parenting ability of these moth-\ners. If we are going to understand how these mothers par-\nent, how their parenting affects the outcome of their\nchildren, and how to develop effective interventions, we\nwill need to pay more attention to patterns of individual\ndifferences in parenting.\nThis study was supported in part by grant 1U10-\nof Child Health and Human Development.\nPresented as a poster at the Pediatric Academic Society/\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics joint meeting, Boston, Mass,\nCorresponding author and reprints: Lynne Andreozzi,\nPhD, Infant Development Center, Women and Infants' Hos-\nlandreozzi@lifespan.org).\nREFERENCES\n2.
