The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey conducted in 1990 provides a compre\u00ad hensive assessment of ambulatory medical practice including patient demographics, chief and secondary complaints, diag\u00ad noses, and drug treatments prescribed. Many specialties in\u00ad cluding dermatology were represented in the sampling tech\u00ad nique. The database was reviewed for descriptive aspects of visits to dermatologists surveyed. Using standardized weighting techniques, we estimated the total number of physician visits . Dermatologists had an estimated 24.0 mil\u00ad lion patient encounters in 1990. Dermatologists treated a disproportionately large number of female and younger pa\u00ad tients . After adjusting for their proportion of the population, Asians and Whites had greater numbers of dermatologic en\u00ad counters than Blacks and Native Americans. Patients had two\n\nT\n\nor more complaints 27.2% of the time, and received two or more diagnoses 28.9% of the time. The most common com\u00ad plaints accounting for 49.7% of visits included \"pimples,\" \"rash,\" \"discoloration,\" \"skin lesion,\" \"wart,\" and \"skin growth.\" The most common diagnoses, accounting for 52.7% of all encounters, were acne, keratosis, wart, dermati\u00ad tis or eczema, benign neoplasm, and malignant neoplasm.

Stem and col\u00ad leagues have reported results from the NAMCS 1974 and 1980-1981 surveys (1 ,2). Weinstock recently\npresented brief preliminary results from the 1990 NAMCS (3). Since the last in-depth report of this database, changes have oc\u00ad curred in the financing, organization, and delivery of medical care services. We have seen the continued development of health main\u00ad tenance organizations, prospective payment schemes (4), resource\u00ad based relative value systems [5], new therapeutic agents, and in\u00ad creased educational efforts (6] regarding skin diseases . Thus, review of current epidemiologic practice information provides fundamen\u00ad tal insight into our dynamic profession. The purpose of this paper is to describe aspects of dermatologic practice in 1990.\nMETHODS\nThe 1990 NAMCS was conducted by the National Center for Health Statis\u00ad tics (NCHS) as an ongo in g descriptive data-collection effort regarding of\u00ad fice-based physician practice (7). The sampling was limited to physicians principally engaged in patient-care activities who were not federally em\u00ad ployed. The multistage probability sampling design is stratified by primary sampling unit (county, or contiguous counties, or a standard metropolitan statistic al area}, then by physician practices within the sampling unit , and\n\nfinally by patient visit within the 52 (weekly) ran omized periods of 1990. Within sma ll practices, a 100% sample of one week' s visits was possible. For very large practices, a systematic random sample from among all visits for a selected week achieved a 20% sampling rate. The resulting national esti\u00ad mates describe the utilization of ambulatory services in the United States. In 1990, 43,469 records provided by 1,684 participating doctors can be used co estimate the experience of 704,603,932 annua l office-based visits. For der\u00ad matology as a specialty, 2,530 records randomly collected from 135 special\u00ad ists statistically represent the experience of 24,009,272 individual visits to approximately 5,953 dermatologists. All estimates are subject to sampling error. The relative standard error for each estima te in this study is based upon the number of patient visits. The estimated relative standard error for derma\u00ad tology varies from 13. 7% for the estimates of 10,000,000 visits to 32.3% for those of 100,000 visits [7].\n  For chis study, the entire dermatologist subsample was extracted from the national database. After sampling weights were app lied to achieve the na\u00ad tionally representative estimates, a geographically balanced estimate of the dermatology experience could be described by collected parameters includ\u00ad ing patient demographics, reason for visit, diagnoses , services provided, and medications ordered. Census data were obtained from the US Bureau of the Census (8]. For all races, the 1990 median family income was $36,062. The proportional income listed in Table Vis the ratio of the income of the group compared with the populat ion as a whole. The analysis was performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nRESULTS\n\n Patient Demographics An estimated 24.0 million patient visits\n\nD.r.

The age distribution of derma\u00ad tology outpatient visits is presented in Fig 1. An estimated 13.7 million (57.2% of the total) female patients attended dermatology visits compared with 10.2 (42.9%) male patients.\nDermatologic Complaints and Diagnoses Primary and  sec\u00ad ondary reasons (patients' complaints) for dermatologist visits are elaborated in Tables I and II. In the surv eyed population, 25.2 % had\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.;\nl-\n.C.:\n't-'\n\"-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwere identical. Physician encounters by women for each of the six most frequent diagnoses were greater than for visits by men. T he greatest disparity between genders was for the diagnosis acne, in which there were an estimated 3.9 million female visitors compared with 1.8 million male visitors. The tenth most frequent diagnosis in men, malignant neop lasm (173.9, 170,000 visits), was the eleventh most frequent in women {148,000 visits).\nRacial Differences The racial distribution of the 1990 patient visits is described in Table V. Taking into account their proportion of the population, Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders had similar numbers of visits to dermatologists. By contrast Blacks and Native Americans had far fewer per capita visits. The leading diagnoses by racial groups are listed in Table VI. Dyschromia was among the top five primary diagnoses for both Blacks and Asians/Pacific Islanders. For whites it was the fifteenth most common diagnosis.\nAge Differences Dermatitis or eczema is a leading diagnosis for all age groups (T able VII). Within the pediatric (0 - 15) and young adult (16 - 35) groups, acne, warts, and dermatitis or eczema pre\u00ad\n\nFigure 1. Age and sex distribut ion of patientsvisiting dermato log ists (1990 NAMCS).\n\n\n\ntwo or more reasons identified, and 4.0% had threeor more reasons. The five leading primary diagnoses, which account for 48.1% of all encounters were acne, keratosis, warts, dermatitis or eczema, benign neoplasm, and malignant skin neoplasm . These primary and other diagnoses are listed in Tables III and IV. In the surveyed population, 28.1% received two or more diagnoses, and 4.8% received three or more diagnoses.\nReferral of Patients The majority of patients {90.4%) were not referred by other physicians for their office evaluation. In the 9.6% of referred patie nt_s, the five leading reasons accounting for 68.6% of referrals were \"skin rash,\" \" discoloration\" or \"pigment alter\u00ad ation,\" \"acne vulgaris,\" skin \" lesion,\" and \"warts.\" The five lead\u00ad ing diagnoses accounting for 37.7% assigned to referred patients were keratoses, acne vulgaris, dermatitis or eczema, wart, and ma\u00ad lignant neoplasm.\nGender Differences in Diagnoses The nine most common diagnoses for both men and women and their order of frequency\n\ndominate. With advancing age, acne visits decline whereas kera\u00ad toses and malignant tumors become more common diagnoses.\nDISCUSSION\nThe 1990 NAMCS data provide a comprehensive  assessment  of U .S. outpatient dermat ologic services. In his survey of 421 derma\u00ad tologists, Mendenhall found that 97% of all dermato logic services are performed outside the hospital setting [9]. According ly, the NAMCS data shou ld be representative of the bu lk of U.S. derma\u00ad tology practice. The exclusion federally employed physicians from the NAMCS database decreases the number of patient encounters reported. However, based upon an estimate of230,000 annual Vet\u00ad erans Affairs clinic visits [10], if the proportion of dermatology visits is comparable, the exclusion of this source misses only 0.03% of the total visits. Similarly, an unknown and likely small number of mili\u00ad tary physician visits are excluded from this analysis. The excl usion of dermatologic researchers by NAMCS also has the potential to skew the data away from more complex referral diagnoses managed in the University setting such as autoimmune bullous disorders and connective tissue dermatoses.\n  Using previously reported 1980-1981 NAMCS [2] results for comparison, these new data suggest that the total yearly number of outpatient encounters by dermato logists in 1990 has increased 14 %\n\n\n\n\nTable I.

In the same time period, the number of fellow and life members of the American Academy of Dermatology increased by approximately 27%.* In 1986, Stern estimated that the number of practicing dermatologists would increase from 1980 to 1990 by approximately 35% [11). These data suggest that the in\u00ad creasing numbers of practicing dermatologists are competing for fewer num bers of availab le patients. This trend may be further exacerbated as managed care systems limit access to quality specialty care.\n  \nUtilization of dermatologic physician services are more common for female than male  patients.  Nevertheless,  according  to  the Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (HANES), skin pa\u00ad thology is consistently more preva le nt among male than female patients [12]. Moreover, female  patients  only  constitute  51.2%  of the total population [7], yet 57.2% of the outpatient  dermatology visits were for female patients. Societal factors undoubtedly in11u \u00ad ence this gender difference.\nWhites and Asians or Pacific Islanders have increased utilizatio n\n\n of services compared with Blacks and Native Americans or Eskimos .\n\n Source: American Academy of Dermatology Membership Office, June\n\nThe greater the median family income , the more dermatologic ser\u00ad vices are utilized. Thus, dermatology service utilization may be\n\n\n\ninfluenced by factors related to income including medical insurance and disposable fami ly inc ome. Leading primary diagnoses also differ between racial groups. From these data we do not sugg est that the incidence or prevalence of skin diseases necessarily differ between\n\nprevalence in the United States. It does, however, provide epidem i\u00ad ologic insight into U.S. dermatologic health care delivery and pat\u00ad terns of delivery.\n\ngroups. Inde ed, because of the relatively small numbers of observa\u00ad \n\ntions, we can draw no conclusions regarding utilization of services by Native Americans or Eskimos.\n  Patients seen by dermatologists often have more than one reason for their visit and they also often receive more than one diagnosis. Nearly three of ten patients had more than one reason for their visit and received multiple diagnoses. The comp le xity of dermatologic practice is increased by the need to obtain separate histories, perform more than one directed physical examination, and manage each additiona l diagnosis.\nFor many patients, dermatologists provide primary care for their\ncutaneous hea lth. Primary care may be defined as \"the point of entry into the health services system and the locus of responsibility for organizing care for patients and populations over time [13]. Derma\u00ad tologis ts frequently provide mucocutaneous health care for patients and their families over years or decades and dermatologists promote disease prevention. Although he used different survey populations and methods, Mendenhall in 1978 found that seven of ten outpa\u00ad tients were self-referred to dermatologists [9]. The 1980-1981 and 1990 NAMCS data respectively show that over 94% and 90% of outpatients were not referred to dermatologists by other physicians. Therefore up to 3.1% of all the US ambu lat ory primary care (the fraction of nonreferred dermatology patients of the total national visits) may be provided by dermatologists. The increased use of dermatologists as primary physicians for mucocutaneous health may reflect educationa l efforts by our specialty. The trend towards more dermatologic primary care is surprising given the increase in managed care systems.\n  This study has resulted in a characterization of ambu lato ry der\u00ad matologic care in the U.S. in 1990. Utilization of dermatologic services differed between genders, ages, and races. This study does not provide data for the calculation of cutaneo us disease incidence or\n\n/,is expe rtise.\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n2. Stern RS, Gardocki GJ: Office-based care of dermato logic disrase.
