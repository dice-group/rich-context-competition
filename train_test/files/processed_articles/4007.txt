The outbreak of the 2007/2008\nglobal financial crisis, followed by the economic recession and increased social inequality, has\ncaused a rise in the number of protest camps globally (Price and Sabido, 2014) and more recently,\nsocial unrest and protests followed the 2016 US Presidential elections and Brexit vote. Phenomena\nrelated to protests and protest camps have been examined in some fields, for example, sociology,\npolitics, media and communication (Feigenbaum et al., 2014; Johnson and Suliman, 2014). In\nparticular, social movement theorists have offered critical insights on the role of art in the context\nof contentious politics as a means of communication, mobilization and collective expression to\naccomplish political aims (Adams, 2002; McDonald, 2006). Surprisingly, there is very limited\nresearch on the interface between artistic activities in protest camps and marketing theory.\nHiggins and Tadajewski (2002) theoretically explored the utilization of marketing technol-\nogies and knowledge in anti-corporate protests, as vehicles for spreading political ideas and\ndiscovering new audiences. They called for a more thorough exploration of how social\nmovements communicate their opinions and messages, by re-engaging with marketing theory\n(Higgins and Tadajewski, 2002). Despite this call, the presence of marketing practices within\nprotest camps (e.g. promotion of protest art and distribution networks for collective claims and\nmessages) has remained unexplored in the field of marketing studies and arts marketing in\nparticular. While there is robust literature on the production of anti-war art (Monteith, 2008),\nprotest music (Rosenthal and Flacks, 2012) and activist art projects (Waltz, 2005) in several\ncontexts, the marketing technologies and practices utilized for their communication\nand promotion are also absent from arts marketing theory. Considering the rise in frequency,\nvisibility and creativity of protests and social movements over the last 40 years (Jasper, 1997;\nJohnson and Suliman, 2014), we suggest that marketing and arts marketing researchers could\nlearn from the promotional methods of protest art.\nThis study provides a novel exploration of how a social movement employed promotional\ntechniques of protest art to effectively communicate their aims and messages to the wider public.\nAlthough our existing knowledge of arts marketing theory and practice has been heavily enriched\nover the last three decades (O'Reilly, 2011), some distinctive features of protest art related to its\nproduction, collective creativity, promotion and aesthetic consumption \u00ad among others \u00ad have been\nentirely unexplored. Diverse forms of visual, performing and fine art can be produced, shared and\nmarketed in order to satisfy the spiritual, utilitarian or hedonic needs of the artist(s), consumer(s)\nand even global audiences (Fillis, 2011). On the other hand, social movements' protest art is\n(usually) collaboratively produced, ephemeral, portable and non-copyrighted, seeking to effec-\ntively convey messages and symbols that will engage the public, attract media attention and stir\naction. In general, the production of art aims to explore the human condition and its display can\nincrease aesthetic satisfaction, arouse feelings and frequently secure monetary advantages. Protest\nart adopts a shared and public character and its promotion primarily aims to raise awareness of\nsocial injustice and expose power relationships. Considering these differences, we argue that\ninsightful and original findings can emerge from an empirical exploration of social movements'\nprotest art via the lens of arts marketing theory.\nIn this study, our main research objective is to examine and critically discuss how marketing\ntechnologies engaged with the promotion of protest art during the Hong Kong protests in 2014. Our\nempirical data are based on moderate participant observation, a visual analysis of photographs\ntaken by the researchers and secondary data stemming from the publicly available digital archives\nof the Umbrella Movement. We employ the research findings firstly in order to identify the\npromotional techniques of protest art in the occupied spaces of the Umbrella Movement. Secondly,\nwe contribute to existing theory and practice through a critical discussion concerning the role of\nprotest art in developing spatial aesthetics, audience engagement tools and arts-infused education\nmethods. Finally, we demonstrate how our observations provide the opportunity to inform, rethink\nand extend the boundaries of arts marketing and marketing theory in general.\nThe Hong Kong protest camps and protest art\nThe 2014 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Umbrella Movement, occurred between Sep-\n1997, and following the principle of `one country, two systems', this special administrative region\npreserves a high degree of autonomy regarding its political and legal organization. The Chinese\ngovernment's decision, in August 2014, to introduce an alternative electoral framework which\nredefined the terms of universal suffrage \u00ad by controlling the selection of the candidates \u00ad triggered\na series of protests that demanded the continuation of democratic elections in Hong Kong.\nDemonstrations outside the Hong Kong Government Headquarters began in late September 2014,\ngradually forming the Umbrella Movement which created protest camps in several other areas of\nHong Kong. The three main sites of the protests were formed in the arterial routes and key areas of\nthe city (Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok) which remained closed for almost 70 days; it is\nFollowing more than two months of protests \u00ad characterized by tensions with the police and anti-\nprotesters \u00ad the occupation sites were cleared in December 2014 without the protests having\nachieved any promises from the state (Dapiran, 2015).\nTogether with the mass mobilization of the public, it is well documented (BBC News, 2014a;\nLau, 2014) that the most prominent features of the Umbrella Movement involved the spontaneous\noutpouring of creativity, including the production and display of protest art as vehicles for both\ncommunicating messages and engaging the public. Strategically occupying key urban intersections\nat the heart of Hong Kong's business and commercial districts, the protesters carefully installed\ndiverse forms of highly visible, imaginative and interactive protest art. Adopting the umbrella as a\nsymbol of passive resistance, hundreds of artistic installations of yellow umbrellas in forms that\nincluded patchwork canopies, statues, trees and origami mobile emerged. Furthermore, colourful\nbanners, lamp posts, tents, leaflets, stands and posters provided artistic platforms for pro-\ndemocracy quotes, visual symbols, icons of resistance, as well as caricatures of politicians. In\nsharp contrast to the surrounding skyscraper architecture, the proliferation and ingenious\ndemonstration of protest art transformed the urban environment \u00ad within the occupied camps \u00ad into\nopen-air spaces for arts participation and engagement. A variety of collaborative projects\nencouraged protesters, Hong Kong citizens and tourists, often without any artistic background, to\nactively participate in the co-production of protest art. Interactive street painting events, chalk\ndrawing on the pavements and blind contour sessions inspired and engaged pedestrians who\nenthusiastically contributed to the co-creation of these impulsive, unconventional and all-inclusive\nprotest art projects. Last but not least, the Umbrella Movement utilized protest art to inform and\neducate audiences as to their collective aims and with regard to issues of social justice and uni-\nversal suffrage. Protesters organized and created arts-infused learning environments, including a\nPatsiaouras et al. 77\nspecially designated study area, `mobile democracy classrooms' and free libraries in the protest\ncamps of Admiralty and Causeway Bay. In general, protesters' art that was displayed in the camps\nand through social and mainstream media played a crucial role in politically awakening the Hong\nKong citizens and in attracting worldwide attention to their cause.\nArts marketing and protest art\nFavouring a sociological perspective, we view art in general and protest art in particular as\ncomplex constructs which mirror and communicate to wider audiences the interrelationships\nbetween social, historical and cultural forces (Rodner and Preece, 2016; Schroeder, 2010). We\nconsider protest art as a broad term, encompassing both a work of fine art, such as Picasso's\nGuernica, and a site-specific installation related to environmental injustice, to give two examples\n(Reed, 2005). Following Jasper (2014), we suggest that protest art's main objectives are to provide\na form of criticism towards social injustice and convey messages and statements designed to\ninfluence or cause positive change in society. In our context, the Umbrella Movement employed\nspatial aesthetics, audience engagement techniques and arts-infused educational events that sought\nto express protesters' critique of the Chinese government's decisions, highlight injustice and turn\ninto a change agent. Aiming to build on these three promotional methods, a review of relevant arts\nmarketing literatures is presented below, designed to suggest ways in which existing marketing\npractices might constructively inform and engage with the protest art of social movements.\nSpatial aesthetics\nIn the realm of shopping and marketing environments, spatial aesthetics and cultural production of\nretail spaces have been explored in spectacular marketplace sites such as the Nike Town (Penaloza,\nmenswear fashion house in the Netherlands (van Marrewijk and Broos, 2012). Likewise, in artistic\nand specific cultural contexts, consumers' and visitors' multisensory and aesthetic experiences\ntowards places have been examined in museums (Goulding, 2001; Joy and Sherry, 2003), concert\nhalls (Debenedetti et al., 2014; Skandalis et al., 2016), Disney World's EPCOT Center (Houston\nand Meamber, 2011) and anti-market festivals (Kozinets, 2002). These studies, among others, have\nprovided novel insights as to how the spatial dimensions of contemporary marketplaces, arts\nvenues and festivals, create and shape consumers' experiences and their emotional bonds with\nspecific places. However, the spatial contexts and aesthetic processes, explored in the existing\nliterature, differ significantly from the multifaceted spatial character of urban protest camps and\nthe participatory and political aesthetics of protest art. Protesters carefully choose their protest sites\nand utilize various spatial strategies and aesthetics to attract large number of participants and to\nstrengthen the visibility of political symbols and messages (Brown et al., 2017). Thereupon, the\nstrategic display of protest art develops the capacity to generate collective experiences and unify\naudiences on both intellectual and emotional levels. With this in mind, we can identify certain\nsimilarities and resonance between the spatial aesthetics, ideological purposes and promotional\ntactics of street art (Borghini et al., 2010) and protest art. Exploring ideologies of public space\nconsumption, Visconti et al. (2010) suggested that the employment of street art in unexpected\nplaces is capable of creating and expressing `an aesthetics commons' for individuals who seek to\nadopt common identities and a sense of belonging. Nonetheless, street artists' individualistic or\ncollective outcomes are usually focussed on specific neighbourhoods and aim to engage local\ncommunities, while protesters' use of spatial aesthetics aim to mobilize vast audiences, attract\nglobal attention and enhance a sense of solidarity within and outside the movement.\nThrough occupying public squares, parks and/or central streets, social movements' protest art\nalters the urban landscape and for a short period of time prompts visitors to both embrace social\nchange and consider an unconventional and artistic viewpoint of their city. Oakes and Warnaby\n(2011) examined how outdoor musical events transform the environment and contribute in\nattracting audiences and changing consumers' perceptions of urban spaces. Moving beyond the\nphysical boundaries of artistic organizations, scholars have explored the promotion of open-air\nfestivals (Wilks, 2014), brand building of visual artists in London's outdoor sites (Sjo\n\u00a8holm and\nPasquinelli, 2014) and the cultural branding of Liverpool (Patterson, 2010). These outdoor arts\nevents and projects can turn into generators of collective artistic experiences and create a fresh\nawareness of a city's aesthetic character. However, the aforementioned site-specific and well-\norganized arts marketing activities occur within a public funded or market governed perspective,\nwhich stands in contrast with protest art's non-commercial, empowering and anti-authoritarian\nfeatures. Consequently, in this article, we use the Umbrella Movement protest camps as alternative\nurban contexts to conceptualize the spatial and aesthetic organization of protest art and subse-\nquently to rethink and develop the spatial aesthetics of open-air art events, public or street art.\nAudience engagement techniques\nOver the last 30 years, several arts organizations have experienced a gradual transformation from\nbeing considered as presenters of tailored programmes to be seen as organizers of experiential\nsettings and participatory events and projects (Ryan et al., 2010). Cultural policies, together with\nfunding terms and conditions, directly encourage artists and arts managers to formulate strategies\nand performances based on audience participation and engagement (Knell, 2006). Kemp (2015)\nsought to define the meaning(s) and outcome of audience engagement, within the sphere of arts and\ncultural organizations, concluding that artistic performances should evoke feelings, emotions and\ncollective responses which motivate consumers' participation. Consequently, audience engage-\nment in artistic experiences has the potential to foster social interaction, build a sense of belonging\nand also strengthen individuals' attachment to the art message or organization's aims. In a similar\nmanner, social movements' success depends heavily upon individuals' participation (della Porta,\n2013) and collaborative protest art can constitute a pre-eminent vehicle for the engagement of\ncitizens in collective expression and identification with pro-democratic ideals.\nArts marketing studies, especially in the domain of the performing arts, demonstrate how\nartists' creative activities can blur the traditional divisions between producers and audiences in\ntheatres (Ryan et al., 2010), orchestra halls (Crawford et al., 2014) and museums (vom Lehn;\n2006; vom Lehn and Heath, 2016). Within these experiential cultural contexts, consumers \u00ad as\nmembers of the audience \u00ad can be transformed into collaborative producers, since they are\ninvited to take an active role in the co-creation of artistic services and experiences. Heritage\norganizations (Minkiewicz et al., 2014), art galleries (Minkiewicz et al., 2016), theatres\n(Walmsley, 2014) and online sites (Ren and Montgomery, 2012) have been turned into\nexperiential and collaborative platforms where visitors engage and participate in the co-\nproduction of art. The importance of collectivity in these contexts has been emphasized by\nCaru\n` and Cova (2006, 2007) who explored classical music concerts and recommended that\nservice providers (organizers or artists) should act as `guides' who facilitate audience partici-\npation. These carefully planned collaborative performances, for the co-creation of consumption\nPatsiaouras et al. 79\nexperiences, take place within the designed spaces of established arts institutions and typically\nengage with performing arts audiences. Against this background, we turn our attention to the\ncomplex spatial and experiential terrain of urban protest camps where ideologically, culturally\nand age diverse audiences have access to public and collaborative protest art projects. In\nconsidering the co-creation of politically inspired art, this exploration seeks to offer fresh\ninsights as to how collaborative art can enhance both consumers' and citizens' awareness of\nsocial issues.\nArts-infused educational events\nA plethora of arts institutions around the world act as educators, employing marketing commu-\nemphasized the role of web-based forums and metaphysical branding as promotional vehicles of\nartistic services that could arouse consumers' desires for aspirational self-improvement, pursuit of\nthe arts or university education. Butler (2000) proposed that local communities \u00ad and especially\nyoung consumers \u00ad should be recognized as the primary market target segments for arts projects\nthat seek to educate and develop audiences via events, platforms and alternative distribution\nnetworks. In the United Kingdom, arts and film festivals promote and celebrate the artistic\nachievements of individuals who faced mental health battles in order to engage and educate\ncommunities on how to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination (Clarke and Knifton, 2009).\nAlso, museum exhibitions seek to enhance audiences' knowledge around urban renewal and\ncommon cultural heritage (Lazzeretti and Capone, 2015) and in the face of funding cuts a variety of\narts centres have created digital art spaces and online interactive tools which aim to strengthen non-\narts students' academic motivation and popularize arts consumption (Enhuber, 2015; Winner et al.,\n2013). The aforementioned arts marketing studies mainly approach audiences' education and\ndevelopment either from the psychological angle (relating to visitors' motivation) or via the\nadoption and consideration of government social policies, community enterprise strategies and\nmeasurable participation rates (Osborne and Rentschler, 2010). On the contrary, we focus on an\nideological perspective that views arts marketing as a trajectory for social inclusion and change\n(Khan, 2015; Navaie, 2004), and accordingly, we seek to explore how protesters promoted arts-\ninfused learning practices in the open, ephemeral and all-inclusive environments of protest camps.\nConsidering that the vast majority of Hong Kong protesters and audiences were young people and\nstudents (CUHK, 2014), we propose that there is a need for a more concrete conceptualization on\nthe role of protest art in educating audiences and cultivating social capital.\nThe current literature discussed a variety of promotional methods for outdoor arts events, the\nco-creation of cultural services and arts-inspired education of audiences, primarily with regard to\nthe performing and visual arts sectors. These studies have emphasized the significance of place for\nartistic experiences and consumers' reactions to interactive art and educational programmes;\nhowever, they do not reflect the spatial complexity, multifarious collaboration and ideological\nsensitivity required for the production and promotion of urban protest art. Thereupon and con-\nsidering the identification of `more specific arts-related marketing frameworks' (Fillis, 2011: 15),\nwe now introduce the innovative promotional techniques of protest art by a pro-democracy social\nmovement. As O'Reilly and Kerrigan (2010: 3) suggest, arts marketing research can lead scholars\nto interesting places: `in the moshpit at a rock concert, contemplating a pile of boxes in Tate\nModern's Turbine Hall, filming people at a music festival, talking to fans in a pub, reading novels\nand comics'. Through visiting, exploring, photographing and critically discussing Umbrella\nMovement's creative activities in the heart of Hong Kong, we also invite the readers of this article\nto immerse themselves in this fascinating public space.\nMethodology\nIn this section, we analyse our methods of data collection and analysis from the Hong Kong protest\ncamps as research sites. Several studies on arts marketing theory have presented case study\napproaches, examining topics including marketing/brand activities in museums/galleries (Pusa and\nstudy, the ideological diversity and organizational volatility of an organic, altering and dynamic\npolitical movement and the geographical complexity characterizing the occupied areas meant that\nthe completion of a `holistic' case study approach was not possible. A series of lively sit-in protests\n\u00ad together with dozens of artistic and protest-related events \u00ad occurred from the 26th of September\ndemarcation of specific `case study' boundaries (Stake, 1994) with an intensive examination of the\nwhole setting (Bryman, 2012) over a sustained period of time did not constitute a feasible plan.\nEmpirically, our study was based on moderate participant observation (Bernard, 1994) pri-\nmarily photo-documentation (Rose, 2012; van Leeuwen and Jewitt, 2001) so as to collect data from\nthe context under investigation. Two researchers spent a week \u00ad during the peak of the protests in\nNovember 2014 \u00ad at the Hong Kong protest sites, collecting empirical data comprised of photo-\ngraphic images, observations, field notes and a varied assemblage of artistic objects. The\nresearchers adopted a moderate participant observation approach (DeWalt and DeWalt, 1998;\nSpradley, 1980) throughout the process of collecting primary data. During the first two days, the\nresearchers acted as observers strolling in the protest camps, photographing and immersing\nthemselves in the protest sites, protest activities and overall atmosphere. In the following days, the\nresearchers moderately engaged in activities such as (a) interacting with the protesters through\ninformal discussions and (b) participating in some of the creative activities, such as post-it writing\nand sticking as well as having their portraits drawn by local artists. These purposeful meanders\naround the camps, the observations and the discussions with protesters and bystanders resulted in\nfield notes that included descriptions of the physical context, the presence and promotion of dif-\nferent forms of art; the creative activities taking place; and thoughts regarding the protest and the\nuse of art as part of it.\nOur primary data set includes almost 300 photographic images collected from two different\nprotest camps (Admiralty and Mong Kok), field notes from observations and collection of artistic\nobjects, such as postal-cards and drawings. Additionally, we examined secondary data stemming\nfrom existing digital archiving of photographic images created to preserve the artwork of the Hong\nKong social movement, which was primarily established by the Umbrella Movement Visual\nArchives and Research Collective (Hilgers, 2015). For our analysis, we adopted a unifying\napproach with material stemming from both the field notes and visual collected data, which\nallowed us to develop a closer link between the abstract process of conceptualizing (as part of the\nresearcher's interpretative work), the experientially derived observations (Suchar, 1997) and the\nphotographic images. We employed visual analysis (Rose, 2012) on both the photographic\nmaterial we collected and the existing digital archives, in order to examine interrelationships\nbetween arts marketing theory and how the protests' aims and causes were promoted at the site.\nFollowing Van Leeuween and Jewitt (2001: 4), the main aim of using photographic images in our\nanalysis and discussion of findings was `to serve as records of reality, as documentary evidence of\nPatsiaouras et al. 81\nthe people, places, things, actions and events they depict'. To protect the anonymity and con-\nfidentiality of protesters, we focus only on photographic images that depict artistic installations and\npublic artwork already widely available on the Internet \u00ad while covering the faces of bystanders\nand removing any information which could identify particular individuals.\nFindings\nThe collected data were based on a careful conceptualization of our main research objectives\n(Rieger, 1996), and following an examination of our literature review on the broadening of arts\nmarketing theory and its potential to engage with protests, we identified three main themes that\nwill be discussed in this article. First, we examine and discuss the creativity and `aesthetic and\nspatial organization of protest art' employed by Hong Kong protesters, used to enhance awareness\nabout their causes, transform the urban environment and captivate the imagination of wide\naudiences. Second, we focus on the use of creative methods to support increased participation in\nand co-creation of artistic activities and experiences as vehicles to engage the audience with\nprotest's artwork and messages. Finally, we elaborate on the value and promotion of protesters'\nartwork for the development and education of audiences', which facilitated the communication of\ntheir aims and sought to induce social change (Navaie, 2004). Tying together insights from the\nliterature review with our observations, data analysis and interpretation from the Hong Kong\nprotest sites, we critically discuss in the following sections how our findings can inform, enrich and\neven update arts marketing theory.\nThe aesthetic and spatial organization of protest art\nLocated at the central business district of the Hong Kong Island and surrounded by government\nbuildings and shopping malls, the Occupy site of Admiralty turned into the epicentre of the pro-\ndemocracy camps. From the east entrance of the site, long colourful banners were hung on\noverhead bridges and roads. The banner displays included pro-democracy slogans and an image\nportraying the President of China holding an umbrella. The iconic and symbolic status of the\numbrella gained prominence for the movement when protesters used their open umbrellas as\nshields against police tear gas two days after the start of the protests (Schumacher, 2014).\nUmbrellas were used as artistic objects and installations both in the protest sites and in other parts\nof Hong Kong during the protests. Walking through the central protest camp, we observed a mosaic\nof connected umbrellas strung between two footbridges, as a canopy, while large yellow umbrellas\nwere positioned on each side of the occupied avenue (see Figure 1). Similar to the use of sun-\nflowers by Taiwanese protesters in 2014 and the Goddess of Democracy statue in Tiananmen\nSquare in 1989, the opened yellow umbrella turned into the celebrated aesthetic symbol of the\nmovement (Lim, 2015) and the protesters carefully and imaginatively installed such site-specific\nprotest artwork so as to ensure maximum visibility.\nThe recognition and acceptance of the umbrella as an enduring emblem led to a popular online\ncompetition to create an imaginative logo design for the protest movement, involving participants\nfrom all over the world (Li, 2014). Through the growing connectivity offered by the Internet, we\nobserve the perhaps surprising adoption of a conventional marketing strategy for the development\nof Umbrella Movement's logo. The organization of a voluntary design competition embodies\nelements of crowdsourcing \u00ad the engagement of a crowd or group for a collective objective \u00ad which\nis gradually turning into a popular marketing mechanism for the co-production of brands, products\nthe marketing capacity of crowdsourcing to share knowledge, produce and develop digital arte-\nfacts. Focussing on the production of artwork, the authors argue that the epicentre of originality\nand creativity alters from something completely `new' to innovative and collaborative patterns of\nreusing and reframing existing ideas. Likewise, the digital development of the Hong Kong social\nmovement's logo shifted protesters' artistic efforts and communication of goals towards an online\nand global network of artists sympathetic with the aims of the Umbrella Movement.\nExamining arts directors' perceptions of visual brand identity, Phillips et al. (2014) indicated\nthe importance of colour for the creation of a strong and communicative visual identity. The\nauthors proposed that art directors aim to employ brand visual elements which are identifiable\nand original in their sector to secure competitive advantage. Although social movements do not\ncompete for a commercial market share, colours and ribbons distinguish and reflect diverse\ncollective identities and stimulate emotional responses from protesters (Martin, 2015). Despite\nthe fact that Hong Kong's Movement lacked a team to co-ordinate the promotion of its artwork,\ngradually and spontaneously the colour yellow was adopted by protesters for ribbons, banners\nand umbrellas. Creative artistic installations of yellow umbrellas could be found in many parts of\nthe city, including an `Umbrella Man' statue, `umbrella bushes' made of origami art and cal-\nligraphy on umbrellas displayed in the camps, among others. Concentrating on protesters'\nemotions, Sawer (2007) offered a critical review on the importance of political colours for social\nmovements. She considered the display of colours as a significant statement of a movement's\nidentity, collective action and sense of community. The author underlines how the employment\nof visual strategies by social movements creates `symbolic languages that are about emotional\nidentification as well as about organizational needs for distinctive brands and brand loyalty, to\nanalysis, umbrellas and the colour yellow both served as visual identification of an emerging\nsocial movement and strengthened the presence of a distinctive visual and `branding' identity\naround protesters' goals and causes. Focussing on the collective nature of creativity in the\nFigure 1. Image of interweaved umbrellas as a canopy (photographed at the Admiralty on 14 November\nPatsiaouras et al. 83\ndevelopment of an art brand by visual artists (Rodner and Kerrigan, 2014), we argue that brand\nmanagers might learn from social movements' creative efforts to communicate their aims\nthrough the visible features of a unifying protest symbol.\nWalking throughout the occupy site of Admiralty, we experienced an explosion of creativity\ninvolving visually striking handmade signs, banners, sculptures and artistic installations of\nyellow umbrellas. Fillis and Rentschler (2005) suggested that during periods of change, the\nconcept of creativity in the arts adopts a wider and multidimensional scope intermingling the role\nof people and objects. Correspondingly, we can argue that, during a period of turbulence, the\nHong Kong protesters' objective to promote their aims was channelled into an outburst of artistic\nexpression and creativity, amalgamating the role of protest art with the perceptions and political\nviews of the protesters, protest's opponents and the divided Hong Kong citizenry. In her seminal\npaper on creativity, Hirschman (1983) claimed that artists (and ideologists) characterized by\nself-oriented creativity and product-centred marketing consider a variety of viewpoints on social\nissues, even if their perspective might oppose predominant popular views, sentiments and social\nnorms; a process that introduces the opportunity for social change through the promotion of art.\nFrom a holistic perspective, the Umbrella Movement protest art has not been the outcome of a\nsingle artist whose efforts might be characterized by individual self-oriented creativity. Indi-\nvidual creators have been identified for only half of the 400 artistic objects now in the Umbrella\nMovement Research Collective's collection (Qin, 2016). Nonetheless, due to their organized\nartistic practices and common intentions, we might approach the creators as a group (Fillis,\n2002) or a creative organization (Fillis and Rentschler, 2005) wherein artistic self-expression\nand collective creativity was purposefully channelled towards unified aims characterized by\nideological independence. One of the intrinsic values of self-oriented artists is that they can\nchallenge audiences who `may find themselves confronted by ethical issues, moral choices and\nemotions that are difficult or painful to acknowledge' (Hirschman, 1983: 49). As expected, the\noccupation of arterial routes, major city intersections and public space by protesters was met\nwith both feelings of support and hostility from the Hong Kong public, causing a `yellow' (pro-\nOccupy) versus `blue' (anti-Occupy) war on social media (Chan and Tsui, 2014). School clo-\nsures, blocked highways and economic disruption affecting business interrupted the everyday\nlives of people in a city where the last violent riots occurred in the 1960's (The Economist,\nobjective of self-oriented artists, since `by creating something that vividly expresses their values\nand emotions, the audience might then be persuaded to accept their perspective'. Similarly, Hong\nKong protesters created protest art which distinguished their values and political beliefs, and\nimaginatively promoted their creative outcomes, in order to confront their ideological opponents\nand attract the attention of indifferent citizens (BBC News, 2014).\nAt the heart of the protest site, a large stand displayed small connected images, primarily of\nsuperheroes, celebrities and political figures, holding the yellow umbrella. Images of Thor, Hulk,\nBruce Lee, Batman, Mahatma Gandhi, Che Guevara and Queen Elizabeth II (among very few\nfemale figures) are easily identified, mingled with other famous Asian fictional and non-fictional\ncharacters (see Figure 2). Focussing on Hong Kong protesters' use of superheroes, Garrett (2014)\nargues that the movement employed them as visual metaphors and turned them into cultural and\npolitical icons of resistance against the erosion of Hong Kong's core values through China's\nefforts to control the elections. Although marketing and arts marketing theory has paid attention\nto the use of celebrities (Erdogan, 1999; Hackley and Hackley, 2015) and famous artists\n(Bradshaw and Holbrook, 2007; Fillis, 2015) as vehicles of communicating brands and ideas, the\nuse of superheroes to cultivate intimacy and attachment has remained unexamined. The bizarre\ncollage of superheroes and ideologically diverse political figures not only captivated the\nattention of the perplexed viewer but stimulated feelings of familiarity and growing interest\ntowards the aims of the movement. Rather than adopting and portraying a particular superhero or\ncelebrity embodying specific ideals \u00ad for example, Captain America (patriotism) \u00ad the cultural,\npolitical and aesthetic diversity of these comic heroes and famous individuals brings the visitor a\nsense of inclusiveness and universality which can create attachment with the movement's aims\nthrough the figures portrayed.\nBesides the portrayal of superheroes, we observed posters, clothing and balloons which dis-\nplayed pictures of Hollywood action movie heroes, as well as Martin Luther King's image and his\n`I Have a Dream' slogan. Examining the behaviour and practices of famous European artists during\nthe 19th and 20th century, Anderson et al. (2009) suggested that tactics such as an embrace of\nforeign techniques (adoption) or the amalgamation of traditional artistic styles with foreign\ninfluences (fusion) can inform the business practices of the 21st-century global manager. Anderson\net al.'s (2009) generic concept of artistic and managerial fusion can be viewed in an analogous and\nmetaphorical sense, taking into account authors' \u00ad somehow superficial \u00ad comparison between\nPicasso's radical combination of foreign approaches with a European style and the efforts of a\ncosmopolitan CEO to increase mobile penetration in Africa. Nonetheless, the visual display of\nMarvel comic heroes and the protagonists of acclaimed anti-authoritarian films \u00ad such as V for\nVendetta and the Matrix trilogy \u00ad presents an interesting example of fusion practices between\nWestern popular culture and the promotion of protest art in `Asia's World City' (Hong Kong\nGovernment, 2002). Fillis and Lee (2011) discussed how visionary awareness and a collective\napproach to creativity have significantly enhanced the internationalization strategies of Korean\nperforming arts organizations. Possibly, the imaginative promotion and collective improvisation\nby Hong Kong protesters, to infuse Western icons in their artistic installations, can inform inno-\nvative and creative internationalization practices of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and\nartistic organizations in both Asian and Western contexts.\nFinally, in one of the most densely populated cities in the world, we observed a spatial context\ncommandeered for the display and promotion of artwork in the two, most prominent, protest\nFigure 2. Images of superheroes and political figures (photographed at Admiralty on14 November 2014).\nPatsiaouras et al. 85\ncamps. Hong Kong protesters created unique public sites of communication, artistic expression\nand political cultivation at the heart of a major international financial centre. These idiosyncratic\nspaces emerged in stark contrast to the backdrop of emblematic skyscrapers (see Figure 3). Small\noutdoor libraries, artistic installations, posters, banners, sculptures and Post-it walls were orga-\nnized and placed within a few hundred square meters. For three months, the protesters generated\nand fostered an alternative space within which they promoted their political messages and chan-\nnelled their creativity through artistic installations. We suggest that the artistic expression and\npromotion within the occupied public space of Hong Kong protests can turn into a platform adding\n\u00a8holm and Pasquinelli,\n2014) on arts marketing theory rethinking the concept of space and place identity beyond the\ngeographical boundaries of galleries, museums and theatres. Apart from the (anti)consumption of\nart or symbolic brands in public spaces (Brown and Sherry, 2003; Chatzidakis et al., 2012; Visconti\net al., 2010), our findings identify and stress the innovative employment of spatial strategies for the\npromotion of Umbrella Movement's protest art and protesters' ability to aesthetically reshape and\ntransform the impersonal and colourless urban environment into a non-traditional and inclusive\nspace for experiences, collective expression and arts engagement as we argue below.\n`Audience engagement and co-creation of protest art'\nIn both Admiralty and Mong Kok, we observed and actively participated in the movement's\nemployment of artistic performances and interactive activities to enhance audience engagement\nand identify with the aims of the protest. Protesters' efforts to maximize the impact of their\nmessages and communicate through artwork with the individuals who visited the protest camps are\nencapsulated in the words of the Hong Kong Arts Centre's former Exhibition Director, Oscar Ho\nHing-kay, who argued that `the entire city is a work of art, and everyone is an artist' (Pollack,\n2015). Similar to the John Lennon Wall in Prague \u00ad a wall filled with lyrics and graffiti inspired by\nFigure 3. Image showing the unique public sites of communication and artistic expression (photograph taken\nBeatles songs and Lennon's life \u00ad the protesters created their own Lennon Wall (see Figure 4), at\nthe heart of the main protest camp in Admiralty. The wall was spontaneously created by a group of\nsocial activists who disseminated colourful Post-its and pens to protesters and visitors, asking them\nto write and express their thoughts, feelings and attitudes towards the movement. In a few days, the\nLennon Wall in Hong Kong became a colourful mosaic of Post-it notes which included written\nmessages, lyrics and epigrams, expressing solidarity with and encouragement towards the protests.\nAlmost 10,000 sticky notes \u00ad including messages of support from tourists and locals \u00ad were\ncounted by pro-democracy protesters who sought to rebuild the wall \u00ad digitally \u00ad after the end of\nthe protest (Ng, 2014). Consequently, the co-creation and transformation of a curved staircase in\ncentral Hong Kong to an artistic wall constitutes an improvisational mode of arts engagement\nattracting individuals whose previous involvement in arts co-creation events and protest activities\ncould have been limited or non-existent.\nWe (as researchers) and thousands of other individuals became active participants in the co-\nproduction of the Lennon Wall Hong Kong, an experience which involved our physical presence\nand action for the co-creation of protest artwork. As participants, we posted our own messages on\nthe Hong Kong Lennon Wall and our experience was personalized since there was an element of\npersonal relevance and a sense of emotional immersion. Similarly, thousands of protesters and\nparticipants became co-producers of public artwork, creating a highly collaborative and inventive\nvisual arts project characterized by mass participation and interaction. As Kozinets et al. (2008:\n352) suggest consumer creation can be viewed beyond the prism of pleasure-seeking, experiential\nand leisure activities, and we can see consumers `as continuing in the working tradition of orga-\nnized work networks, art studios, factories', since collective creativity is fostered by `shared\nvalues, ideologies . . . collective political action, and the shared base of grounded knowledge'. In\nthe context of the Umbrella Movement, our findings indicate that along with contemporary con-\nsumer protest practices \u00ad such as Internet petitions and boycotting \u00ad the co-creation of protest art\nemerges as a means of directly challenging institutional power and of influencing government and\ncorporate policies.\nFigure 4. Hong Kong John Lennon Wall (photograph taken at the Admiralty 15 November 2014).\nPatsiaouras et al. 87\nCitizens, tourists and even visiting children were encouraged by protesters and artists to\nutilize artistic tools and resources in order to engage with the movement and its aims. The Italian\npainter Francesco Lietti, based in Hong Kong, specializes in the creation of paintings portraying\nthe city; during the protests, he organized interactive street painting events where anyone could\ncontribute in the production of collaborative canvases (ArtRadar, 2014). These street painting\nsessions \u00ad entitled `the Voice of the Streets' \u00ad provided a space for engagement with the co-\nproduction of artwork that was expressing universal values related to peace, democracy and\nrepresentation. Becoming a member of the protest community himself, in this novel and\nexperiential street context, we can argue that the artist adopted the role of the `guide' or facil-\nitator who enables and constructs the co-production of art and experiences (Arnould and Price,\n` and Cova (2006) suggest that immersion in an experiential\ncontext derives gradually, following the stages of nesting, investigating and stamping. Nesting\nembodies a feeling of comfort and familiarity with the experience, which leads the audience to\ninvestigate further the unfamiliar territory. Through stamping, the audience member ascribes\nparticular meanings to the experience deriving from their own personal history and feelings.\nRethinking audience engagement practices in the context of protest camps, we observed how\nvisitors, tourists and sympathizers with the Umbrella Movement gradually developed a degree of\nfamiliarity with the collaborative projects which progressively led to further exploration of this\nunusual artistic terrain. We also noticed that dozens of Post-it notes on the Hong Kong Wall\nincluded personalized messages and drawings, expressing association with the Umbrella\nMovement. Creating non-traditional art spaces for co-participation, engagement and interaction,\nboth the interactive painting process and the co-creation of the John Lennon Wall can be seen as\nplatforms where audience members immersed themselves in protest art. These outdoor projects\nof protest art constitute novel platforms for existing arts marketing research (Minkiewicz et al.,\n2016; vom Lehn and Heath, 2016) to consider how communities, social movements or networks\nof audiences and artists can turn into collaborators of creative processes distinguished by\nopenness, engagement and the communication of universal values.\nWe also actively participated in the production of street protest art. Artists produced blind\ncontour drawings of protesters or visitors \u00ad including of this articles' authors \u00ad and engaged in\ncreative street art activities throughout the protest site. The artists engaged and interacted with\nvisitors, inviting them over to produce individual face portraits on A5 sheets, with a pre-printed\nyellow and black background in accordance with the emblematic colours used by the protest\nmovement. Before, during and after the drawing of our portraits by a blindfolded artist, we\nembarked upon a very informative discussion with the painters regarding the origins and\nideological background of the Umbrella Movement. Like other passengers, we found an\nopportunity to be informed and exchange ideas about the protesters' demands while we engaged\nand participated in the production of simple and imaginative artwork in a non-art context.\nAdditionally, we observed chalk drawings on roads and pavements by individuals expressing\ntheir solidarity with the movement. The spread of artistic creativity and imagination throughout\nthe protest camps and city is summarized in the words of the former Director of the Hong Kong\nArts Centre who argued that the totality of artwork `reflects a collective spirit, and it is organic,\nso it keeps growing'. He also stated that the productive outcomes of `some trained artists are\nmore conservative' when compared to the inventive street art created by protesters, visitors,\nstudents, activists and tourists, all-together (Pollack, 2015). As mentioned above, these direct\ncomparisons and statements by art critics seem to add status along with aesthetic legitimacy to\nthe Umbrella Movement's protest art. The Hong Kong protesters' artwork was displayed at the\n`Disobedient Objects' exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, which aimed to\nfocus on how collective creativity and political activism challenge standard conceptions of art\nand design (Victoria and Albert Museum, 2016).\nBy examining the innovative methods for audience engagement and co-creation of objects and\nexperiences, in the occupied spaces, we suggest that cultural policies (Knell, 2006) and arts\nmarketing theories (Kemp, 2015) can extend their conceptual boundaries by paying more attention\nto collaborative creation, methods of engagement and communication of protest artwork by social\nmovements. Considering the duration, central locations and scale of the movement, thousands of\npeople became collaborative producers of several protest art projects that transformed the urban\nlandscape and communicated messages of solidarity and pro-democratic ideals. Contrary to public\nperceptions of protest camps as arenas of violence, struggles for control and confrontation (della\nPorta, 2006; Seferiadis and Johnston, 2012), our findings show how protesters instilled elements of\nplayfulness, imagination and humour in their cooperative artistic platforms. Within this unique art\ncontext, we identify nonlinear and multifarious collaborative activities, a sense of enduring\ncreativity and multi-sided spaces for untended and open spaces of massive arts participation. We\nsuggest that, especially during periods of budget cuts to arts programmes, national arts councils\nand art practitioners can encourage and develop sustainable and empowering community arts\nprojects so as to increase art engagement in deprived neighbourhoods or rural areas.\nProtest art for the development and education of audiences\nSeveral social movements attempted to promote audience development and education within their\ncamps through cultural strategies and pedagogical experiments (Anyon, 2005; Feigenbaum et al.,\n2014). For example, more than three hundred lectures and workshops on political education\noccurred in the protest camps of the Occupy Wall Street Movement (Di Salvo, 2013), while\nprotesters in Taksim Square, Istanbul combined public reading and peaceful protesting (Henton,\n2013) and anti-globalization camps screened anti-authoritarian films and discussed countercultural\nOur observations in Hong Kong demonstrate the employment of protest art as a promotional\nvehicle to educate audiences about social issues and justice. We observed how the Umbrella\nMovement fostered participation by creating appropriate platforms to inform and educate pro-\ntesters and visitors in the locality, and globally through online communications. Exploring the\nemergence of technology, arts marketing research has emphasized the importance of eWoM\nthrough social media in performing and fine arts (Hausmann and Poellman, 2016; Wroot, 2015)\nand online networking sites in allowing companies to disseminate information (Ryan et al.,\n2010). Focussing on politically inspired art, we observed how the Umbrella Movement turned\nsocial media into prominent and popular digital platforms, such as the Facebook page `People in\nthe Streets', that acted as an initiative to collect personal stories from individuals around the\nprotests. Inspired by the famous `Humans of New York' Facebook page, the protesters digitally\ndisplayed a picture of a protester, a couple and even a journalist, accompanied by a quote about\ntheir everyday realities, relationships or working conditions in the city of Hong Kong. Addi-\ntionally, the movement's main Facebook webpage was widely displayed through large yellow\nbanners in the protest camps. Characterized by The Guardian as a `social media revolution' (The\nGuardian, 2014), through their smart phones the protesters managed to synchronize and co-\nordinate supply chains, medical teams and warnings regarding violence and attacks in protest\ncamps. Digital media were also turned into means of social protest and motivation, through the\nPatsiaouras et al. 89\ncreation of a media art project which displayed short messages of solidarity from all over the\nworld appearing via a projector on a gigantic billboard in the protest areas (ArtRadar, 2014). The\nkey role of social media in the Umbrella Movement to access and inform wider audiences\nreflects and builds upon the insights from marketing studies (Kerr et al., 2012; Makarem and Jae,\n2016) which portray the World Wide Web as an alternative protest site for collective opposition\nagainst the interests of powerful institutions.\nIn the main protest site Admiralty, we observed and photographed specially designed areas\nwhere the protesters provided English language lessons displayed on whiteboards. Phrases like\n`civil disobedience' and `universal suffrage' \u00ad the ultimate aim of the protestors \u00ad appeared in\nboth English and Cantonese characters, alongside a brief vocabulary list. On another white\nboard, we observed the translation of the terms `Wikipedia', `WikiLeaks', `Bitcoin' and `Occupy\nMovement', aiming to encourage protesters and visitors to conduct further research about the\ncauses and objectives of the movement. Apart from these references to alternative payment\nsystems and non-profit journalistic organizations, the protesters displayed banners and yellow\nleaflets with quotes about freedom and democracy by John Lennon, Nelson Mandela and\nMahatma Ghandi. In the central protest camp of the Admiralty, we observed how the protesters\ncreated a `study corner' (see Figure 5) several meters from the central highway, including tables,\nchairs, reading lamps and shelves in a small library in a fenced but publicly visible area. Large\nyellow and blue tents protected readers from rain, while signs indicated that flash photography\nwas banned. Passengers and demonstrators could attend calligraphy workshops, pick a book\nfrom the library and quietly study among the tables. Students were particularly encouraged to\ncomplete their homework in the study corner, with volunteer tutors offering free assistance on\nseveral academic subjects including mathematics and physics. This unconventional study space\nwas carefully infused with small installations and Post-it notes related to the movement, not only\nFigure 5. Image of `study corner' (photograph taken at Admiralty on 15 November 2014).\noffering a sense of community but also reflecting protesters' efforts to facilitate the everyday\nprocess of learning and education even within what the Hong Kong government considered to be\nan illegal camp. Consequently, we suggest that arts-based educational practices within social\nmovements can turn into an effective promotional tool to induce social change and foster\ndemocratization, despite the lack of modern teaching infrastructures and technological tools.\nExperimental outdoor theatres and existing or emerging groups of radical performance pedagogy\n(Colomina et al., 2015; Garoian, 1999) that seek to produce ephemeral utopian spaces and\namalgamate experimental aesthetics and interdisciplinary critical education (Gomez-Pena and\nSifuentes, 2011) can draw inspiration from the use of protest spaces for arts-infused educational\npractices and horizontal notions of experimental co-learning.\nFollowing these examples from the Hong Kong protest camps, our findings identify and\nemphasize the potential of arts marketing to become a vehicle for community development, social\nchange and education of audiences (Navaie, 2004). Accordingly, we highlight the capacity of\nprotest art to educate and empower young people and foster equality within communities and urban\ncontexts. Based on our observations and readings around the potential of art to widen the social\nimaginary and induce social change, we suggest arts marketing theorists and arts organizations\n(Kolb, 2005; Osborne and Rentschler, 2010) \u00ad for example, non-profit arts organizations and\ncommunity arts centres \u00ad might draw their attention to the means of improvisation and creativeness\nused by social movements in order to develop inclusive educational programmes, identify inno-\nvative public performance spaces and explore experimental means of stimulating fruitful dialogues\naround social and political issues. Especially during times of financial scarcity and conservative\ncost-cutting in the arts and education sectors, art-infused education could both contribute to the\nexpansion of arts marketing practices and benefit the most vulnerable citizens such as refugees, the\nhomeless and the underprivileged.\nProtest art and (arts) marketing theory\nFollowing the lack of an empirical study on the promotion of protest art within marketing\nstudies, we argue that the examination of Umbrella Movement's creative displays, collaborative\nart performances and arts-infused educational activities can invigorate the theoretical resources\nof arts marketing and marketing theory in general. Our article proposes, for the first time, the\nimportance of theorizing and understanding the spatial and artistic practices in protest camps as\nalternative and emerging arts-related frameworks and valuable empirical platforms for advan-\ncing arts marketing theory. We suggest that the resourceful and creative use of the occupied\nurban space, by protesters and sympathizers, provides a novel and fresh conceptualization\naround spatial strategies and improvisational techniques for artistic promotion. Our findings\ndepict and elaborate upon the transformation of Hong Kong's arterial thoroughfares and public\nsquares into an urban protest art platform, which works to reclaim and re-enchant the built\nenvironment with aesthetic and ideological interventions that galvanized passengers' active\nparticipation. Appropriation of urban space, encampment and high-functioning infrastructures \u00ad\namong other spatial features of the protest camps \u00ad facilitated and enabled the transient,\nspontaneous and to some extent celebratory co-production and communication of protest art.\nConsequently, we emphasize the value and powerful potential of promoted protest art in\nreframing urban environments, disrupting the mundane fabric of a densely populated city and\nattracting large audiences in captivating and contested contexts of collective artistic expression\nand experimentation.\nPatsiaouras et al. 91\nRecognizing that the promotion of protest art is capable of transforming perceptions of urban\noutdoor spaces, we argue that our findings can contribute to rethinking and re-imagining the\nmarketing mix variable of `place' for arts marketing. Thereupon, we suggest a conceptual shift or\nextension of the traditional marketing mix variable of `place' \u00ad perceived, for instance, as location\n(art studio), settings (opera house), distribution (commercial/art collective galleries) or locales\n(open-air concert) \u00ad towards a broader notion of space. Unlike site-specific and carefully planned\noutdoor art events which have been discussed in arts marketing literature (O'Reilly and Kerrigan,\n2010), we identify the capability of effectively promoted protest art to energetically demand,\norganically spread and to some degree aesthetically de-alienate the monotonous space and sky-\nscraper architecture of Hong Kong. In synergy with Umbrella Movements' `virtual' spaces\n(Facebook page, media art projector), the public display of protest art transformed city's financial\ncentre and key commercial areas into an arts space characterized by openness and increased\nvisibility that stimulated public participation and attracted worldwide media attention. Protesters'\npromotional tactics turned their art into a `modifier of space' and similarly arts practitioners or\nmarketers of city/music festivals and community arts projects \u00ad among others \u00ad can conceptualize\nhow the presentation and communication of their creative outcomes not only forms fully func-\ntioning and attractive venues and settings but also in what way it has the potential to alter urban or\nrural spaces. Moreover, the artistic improvisation and synergistic spirit of protesters' spatial tactics\ncan be infused into arts marketing practices regarding the ingenious and shared use of `physical'\nspace for outdoor art venues such as site-specific urban art and interactive public art. Synthetic\nresearch approaches between the multifaceted nature of `space' (Lefebvre, [1974]1991; Soja,\n1996) and `place' (Chatzidakis et al., 2014) and the complex activities of new social movements in\nprotest camps (Nicholls et al., 2016) offer the opportunity to expand interdisciplinary spaces where\narts (and place) marketing theorists can explore further spatial strategies for the promotion of art,\neffective visibility, symbolism and emancipatory aesthetics.\nSocial movements seek to produce a series of campaigns and performances in order to express\ncommon claims and form a collective identity (Tarrow, 1994; Tilly, 2004). Our findings highlight\nthe employment of innovative promotional activities such as the collaborative building of a visual\nbrand identity and unifying symbolism (yellow Umbrella), internationalization and fusions of\nWestern and Asian superheroes and political icons and online crowdsourcing for logo design. We\nargue that Umbrella Movements' digital collective creativity and brand-building strategies evinced\na large degree of transnationalism and globalization in terms of communicating universal symbols,\nlanguage and iconic figures related to the ideals of freedom and democracy. Viewing new social\nmovements as alternative arts organizations and spaces, in different cultural contexts, further\nresearch on their creative and cross-cultural `branding' practices \u00ad through visual/digital archives\nand historical research methods \u00ad can provide novel insights into the increasingly aesthetic col-\nlaboration and technological interdependence for the promotion of common values and global\ninjustice symbols. Accordingly, the findings can inform and update transnational arts initiatives\nand projects pursuing to promote and advance social justice and cross-cultural artistic fusion\nbetween arts organizations that aim to forge affective bonds with global audiences.\nAdditionally, we suggest that the Umbrella Movement can be approached as type of an alter-\nnative creative organization whose temporal processes and powerful artwork can inform the\nmultifaceted construct of creativity for arts marketing theory (Fillis and Rentschler, 2005) and also\nenlarge our understanding of managing arts organizations. We demonstrated how protesters'\ncourageous purposes and collective artistic expression embody the qualities of self-oriented artistic\ncreativity (Hirschman, 1983) and a product-centred approach towards the promotion of art. While\nspecific art industries and entrepreneurial marketing practices permit a particular level of orga-\nnizational creativity (Fillis, 2002), Umbrella Movement's lack of central leadership allowed the\nproliferation of `free flowing' creativity which boosted a spirit of individual/group autonomy,\nrisk-taking behaviour and collective enthusiasm. In our context, movement's free-flowing\ncreativity \u00ad spread via the production and communication of protest art \u00ad overcame instru-\nmental and traditional organizing tools, enhanced experimental artistic expression and enabled\nthe injection of alternative viewpoints into the public realm. Along with the study of creativity in\nother contexts and fields (e.g. science and literature), urban movements and social movement\nscholarship (Jasper, 2014; Shepard, 2011) can offer potential avenues of further research to arts\nmarketing theorists interested in horizontal leadership of arts organizations and events as well as\ndecentralized team or group creativity within smaller art enterprises. In-depth interviews with\nprotest organizers and art activists and semi-ethnographic approaches in occupied urban contexts\ncan explore further non-traditional forms of arts organization together with the spiralling dynamism\nand contagiousness of social movements' collective and free-flowing creativity.\nApart from the inventive promotion of visual images, symbols and metaphors, our findings\nshowed how protesters employed the co-production of protest art and collaborative projects \u00ad such\nas a democratic mosaic wall and interactive street painting \u00ad in order to enhance audience arts\nengagement and foster social inclusion. Existing marketing literature has focussed on the co-\ncreation, and to a lesser extent co-production, of consumption experiences within artistic ser-\nvice encounters (Caru\ninterface between producer's service elements and consumers' emotional drivers and cognitive\nengagement. Our findings identify how in open and all-inclusive urban spaces, (quasi)autonomous\ngroups of protesters, professional artists, locals and visitors intermingled in a collaborative artistic\nprocess of experiencing and overtly communicating a collective sense of solidarity related to\ndemocracy and autonomy. The accessibility of this huge creative process managed not only to\ngenerate instructive/informative experiences about protesters' cause but also to open the move-\nment's organizational boundaries and expand its artistic vision to city dwellers, tourists and digital\naudiences around the world. In this alternative context, the co-creation of protest art blurs and has\nthe potential to rethink the traditional roles (producer/consumer) and spatial boundaries (servi-\ncescapes) of arts organizations and raise awareness of social and political issues. Additional\nresearch on the formation of spatially complex and experimental collaborative arts projects by\nsocial movements can inform grassroots arts groups' and local authorities' collective art activities\nseeking to enhance social inclusion, strengthen community identity or promote social and envi-\nronmental issues. Furthermore, voluntary organizations and amateur arts groups can raise their\nprofile, attract new audiences and identify suitable outdoor venues by drawing insights from\nprotest art collaborative practice.\nFinally, our observations focussed on Umbrella Movement's employment of the occupied space\nfor an arts-infused education in order to enhance equality, inclusiveness and social development,\nand we suggested that during an era of arts spending cuts protest camps' `internal' education tactics\n(Frenzel, 2011) can enable and inspire the emergence of cost-effective, open and non-hierarchical\nlearning processes and workshops. The outdoor and inventive platforms for education of audiences\ndemonstrate Umbrella Movement's ephemeral but resourceful efforts to foster an inclusive\nlearning environment and encourage a public dialogue around the necessity and means of\nachieving social change. From a holistic perspective, social movements' group actions seek to\ninduce (Occupy Wall Street) or resist (anti-globalization movement) social change and our find-\nings indicate the employment of arts marketing practices and innovative promotion of protest art so\nPatsiaouras et al. 93\nas to persuade and unite the public to challenge and resist electoral reforms that threatened\ndemocratic processes.\nTo date, primarily social marketing (Andreasen, 2003; Nolan and Varey, 2014) and advertising\nliteratures (Orazi et al., 2016; Xin and Belk, 2008) explicated the complex interactions between\nmarketing/advertising campaigns and social transformation pursuing to influence (voluntary)\nbehaviour change, improve individual or societal well-being and urge policymakers to increase\nsocial welfare, among others. Social change, in the forward thinking and vibrant field of social\nmarketing, is approached, examined and enabled \u00ad primarily \u00ad through altering behaviours,\nenvironments and policies (Gordon et al., 2016; Lefebvre, 2011). In our setting, we identified the\nspontaneous creation and promotion of protest art as an essential tool of resisting controlling\npolitical decisions and institutional power stemming from the powerful Chinese and Hong Kong\ngovernments. Consequently, we acknowledge the role of promoted protest art as a change agent\nwhose value lies in the ability to highlight injustice through spatial aesthetics, audience engage-\nment and educational practices. Along with social movements and political public art projects,\nmarketing scholars can focus on contexts of oppression and injustice where the use of marketing\ntechnologies and knowledge by arts communities or artists enables them to communicate a form of\nart and ideas that seek to empower, educate and confront.\nConcluding comments\nAs media scholars argue, activists and new social movements have turned into keen students of\ncommunication strategies which enable them to engage and mobilize audiences towards col-\nlective actions. In this article, we suggest that marketing theory and practice can also be\ninformed by the rapid growth of multi-media friendly social movements and marketing savvy\nart activism. Exploring the occupied spaces of the Umbrella Movement, we identified and\ndiscussed the presence of several marketing technologies and spatial strategies for the pro-\nmotion of protest art. Online crowdsourcing, visual `brand' building, co-creation of art and the\nimaginative use of social media constituted some of the means that protesters utilized in order to\ntransform urban sites, communicate their messages, enhance audience engagement and educate\ncitizens. These findings can inform and update existing arts marketing studies which seek to\nrethink the concepts of arts space and place identity, explore alternative forms of collective\nartistic creativity and re-imagine outdoor collaborative projects for the engagement of diverse\naudiences.\nFuture research can focus on how social movements encourage audiences to endorse social\njustice, inspire meaningful actions and rethink organizational hierarchies. Additionally, the\npolitical activities, resisting practices and promotion methods within these `alternative spaces'\ncan inform not only marketing theory but also the growing literature on consumer protest and the\npotential of art to challenge and oppose the interests of powerful commercial or state institutions.\nProtesters, consumers and activists, we argue, utilize marketing knowledge and art in order to\ndisrupt both the marketplace and institutional power. This process should not be viewed as an\nanti-marketing phenomenon but as an invigorating stance towards the marketing concept itself\nthat offers the opportunity to examine and theorize the expansion of (arts) marketing activities\nwithin unexplored social and political terrains. Consequently, further research on social\nmovements' efforts to effectively promote, encourage or induce social change \u00ad through protest\nart or campaigns \u00ad can uncover and highlight novel aspects of the inherently creative and\npolitical nature of marketing.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAdams, J.
