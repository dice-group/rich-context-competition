Persons with poor lower-\nextremity function, slow gait speed, and particularly those\nwith walking disability, are at higher risk for chronic dis-\nease, hospitalization, and death than their peers who walk\nnormally [1-3]. Several general impairments and acute\nand chronic conditions have been linked to poor lower-\nextremity function and are often multifactorial [1,4,5].\nOne such condition, hyperglycemia, has been found to be\na strong predictor of disability and poor physical perform-\nance among older U.S. adults [6,7]. Other conditions,\nsuch as heart disease, stroke, and hypertension, have also\nbeen reported to predispose older adults to functional\ndecline [8,9]. Furthermore, modifiable health behaviors,\nsuch as level of physical activity, may play an important\nrole in the prevention of chronic conditions that could\nlead to functional limitation and disability [10,11]. Iden-\ntifying risk factors for slow gait speed and developing\nappropriate interventions may be the best approach for\npreventing decrements in gait speed and delaying its pro-\ngression.\nOne such risk factor may be the metabolic syndrome,\nwhich the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program\nAdult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) defines as the\npresence of three or more of the following conditions:\nabdominal adiposity, high blood pressure, hypertriglycer-\nidemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cho-\nlesterol, or high fasting glucose [12]. Approximately 27%\nof all U.S. adults are estimated to have the metabolic syn-\ndrome, but the prevalence is even higher among older\ntively, among those aged 60 years or older [13]. With the\nepidemics of obesity and diabetes in the United States, the\nmetabolic syndrome is expected to be even more preva-\nlent in the future [13,14]. Persons with the metabolic syn-\ndrome have been shown to be at increased risk for\ncardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, as well as for\ndeath from cardiovascular disease and from all causes\n[15,16]. However, there is minimal research on the asso-\nciation between the metabolic syndrome and its individ-\nual components and gait speed.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess whether the meta-\nbolic syndrome and its individual components are associ-\nated with gait speed in a national sample of U.S. men and\nwomen aged 50 years and older. Whether these associa-\ntions are independent of physical activity was also exam-\nined.\nMethods\nDesign and data collection\nBeginning in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention's (CDC's) National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) became a continuous sur-\nvey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population\nbased on a complex, multistage sampling design. This\nreport is based on results of the first four years of the con-\nconsent was obtained from all participants, and the CDC\nInstitutional Review Board approved the protocol. A\ndetailed description of the continuous NHANES is\nreported elsewhere [17].\nMeasures\nThe survey included an interview conducted in partici-\npants' households and an examination at a mobile exam-\nination center (MEC). Information obtained during the\ninterview included demographic data such as sex, age, race\nand ethnicity, years of education completed, and house-\nhold income. Interviewers also asked survey participants\nabout their health conditions and health-related behav-\niors, including questions about smoking; physical activity;\nhypertension; and use of antihypertensive medication,\ndiabetes medication, and insulin. After the household\ninterview, participants were asked to undergo a health\nexamination at a MEC.\nIn accordance with the NCEP/ATP III criteria [12], we con-\nsidered participants to have the metabolic syndrome if\nthey met three or more of the following criteria: 1)\nabdominal obesity: waist circumference >102 cm in men\nmmol/L) in women; 4) systolic blood pressure/diastolic\nreported current use of antihypertensive or antidiabetic\nmedication (insulin or oral agents) were counted as hav-\ning high blood pressure or diabetes, respectively.\nWaist circumference was measured according to standard\nto the nearest millimeter [18]. During the health examina-\ntion, up to four blood pressure readings were obtained. If\nthree or more blood pressure readings were obtained, we\nexcluded the first reading and used the average of the\nremaining readings; if two readings were obtained, we\nused the last reading; and if only one reading was\nobtained, we used that. Participants' body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated from their measured weight and\nheight (weight [kg]/height [m2]). Serum triglycerides\n(after hydrolysis to glycerol) and HDL cholesterol (after\nprecipitation with a heparin sulfate and MnCl2\nsolution)\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwere measured enzymatically. Plasma glucose concentra-\ntions were measured by using an enzymatic reaction.\nAmong participants aged 50 years and older, gait speed\nwas measured by observing them take a 20-foot (6.10\nmeter [m]) walk at their usual pace and timing them with\na hand-held stopwatch to the nearest hundredth of a sec-\nond. The stopwatch was started when a participant's foot\nfirst touched the floor across the start line and stopped\nwhen the participant's foot first touched the floor across\nthe finish line. Participants were permitted to use a walk-\ning device such as a walker or cane. We converted the\nresults into speed (meters per second [m/s]) to facilitate\ncomparison to other studies. Bohannon et al.'s [19] refer-\nence values for comfortable gait speed among older adults\nwere used to define normal gait speed; men with a gait\nm/s were classified as having a gait speed impairment.\nCovariates included age (continuous), sex, race or ethnic-\nity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican\nAmerican, other), education (<high school, high\nschool), metabolic equivalent (MET) units of leisure-time\nsmoking status (current, former, never), alcohol con-\nsumption (none, moderate, heavy), arthritis status (yes,\nno), and use of an assistive device (yes, no). Participants\nwere asked to report the frequency and the duration that\nthey spent participating in 48 leisure-time physical activi-\nties of moderate or vigorous intensity the month before\nthe survey [20-23]. Each physical activity was assigned an\nthe ratio of the energy expenditure of the activity to a\ntiplied each activity session by its corresponding intensity\nvalue and summed this product for all activity types for\neach participant: \ni\n(number of times * METs)i\n, where i =\na specific leisure-time physical activity from 1 to 48. This\nproduced an intensity-weighted frequency value for the\npast month that we then converted into an average weekly\nvalue. We then created 4 categories, based on recom-\nmended levels of physical activity [25], that corresponded\nto 1) no leisure-time physical activity (0 METs/week); 2)\ninsufficient leisure-time physical activity (>0-<22.5 METs/\nweek, where 22.5 METs/week represents the minimum\nrecommended level based on the MET value of 5 days of\n4) highly active (35 METs/week; where 35 METs/week\nrepresents 5 days of vigorous aerobic activity). A current\nsmoker was defined as someone who reported smoking at\nleast 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smokes\ncigarettes. A former smoker was defined as someone\nsmoking at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime who\nreported that they no longer smoked cigarettes. Those\nwho had not smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime were\ndefined as never having smoked. Alcohol consumption\nwas based on the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and\nAlcoholism's guide for screening for heavy drinking\namong older adults [27]. A non-drinker was defined as\nsomeone who reported not drinking any alcoholic bever-\nconsidered moderate drinkers if they consumed 2 drinks\nper day on average, as were men aged 66 years or older\nand women aged 50 years or older who consumed 1\ndrink per day. Men aged 50\u00ad65 years were considered\nheavy drinkers if they consumed more than 2 drinks per\nday on average, as were men aged 66 years or older and\nwomen aged 50 years or older who consumed more than\n1 drink per day. A drink was considered as a 12-oz beer, a\n4-oz glass of wine, or an ounce of liquor. In NHANES\ntypes of alcoholic drinks. Participants were considered to\nhave arthritis if they answered \"yes\" to the question, \"Has\na doctor or other health professional ever told you that\nyou had arthritis?\" Subjects who were observed using a\ncane, walker, or another walking aid during the 20-foot\n(6.10 m) timed walk test were categorized as using an\nassistive device.\nStatistical analysis\nAmong both men and women, we calculated the mean\nvalues of continuous variables and percentages of categor-\nical variables of participant's general and clinical charac-\nteristics, and across those with different number of\nmetabolic syndrome components; we calculated the age-\nadjusted prevalence of gait speed impairment across par-\nticipants with different number of metabolic syndrome\ncomponents; and we calculated the prevalence of each\ncomponent of the metabolic syndrome and for the syn-\ndrome as a whole by gait speed impairment status. To age-\nadjust statistics, we directly adjusted to the U.S. popula-\nwhether differences in these characteristics were statisti-\ncally significant by using a Chi-squared test for categorical\nvariables and a t test for continuous variables. The unad-\njusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the associa-\ntion between gait speed impairment and the metabolic\nsyndrome and each of its individual components using\nlogistic regression. We then estimated the OR between\ngait speed impairment and each of the 5 components of\nthe metabolic syndrome (abdominal obesity, hypertrig-\nlyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, hypertension, and high\nfasting glucose, respectively) after adjustment for age and\nMETs/week of leisure-time physical activity (Model 1).\nModel 1 was further adjusted to include all metabolic syn-\ndrome components (Model 2). Finally, in the full model,\nwe include race/ethnicity, education, and all variables that\nwere moderately associated with the outcome variable\nduring univariate analyses. The full model was then\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nreduced by the stepwise elimination of variables with P\nvalues  .05 with the exception of important confounders\n(Model 3). We assessed the fit of the final model using the\nHosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [28]. SUDAAN\naccount for the survey's complex sampling design. All sta-\ntistical inferences were based on a significance level of P <\n.05. Prevalence estimates were calculated by using the\nsampling weights so that the estimates were representative\nof the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.\nBecause concentrations of plasma glucose and serum trig-\nlycerides were measured using reference analytic methods\nonly for participants who attended the morning examina-\nyears who attended the morning examination and who\nhad fasted 8 hours. Participants were excluded who did\nnot have complete measurements for all components of\nthe metabolic syndrome (N = 131) or had missing data on\nwomen) were included in the analyses. The age and sex\ndistributions of those included in the analyses were not\nsignificantly different from those who were excluded\n(both P > .05) [see Additional file 1].\nResults\nTable 1 shows general and clinical characteristics of partic-\nipants by gender. Men and women had similar percent-\nages of participants who were white, black, Mexican\nAmerican, or another race; had graduated from high\nschool; were obese; or used an assistive device. Men were\nyounger and were more likely to be current or former\nsmokers and to be heavy drinkers. Women were more\nlikely to not participate in physical activity during leisure\ntime, to never have smoked, to be non-drinkers, and to\nhave arthritis than men. Mean waist circumference and\ntriglycerides were outside the normal range in both men\nand women, as was mean systolic blood pressure in\nwomen and mean fasting glucose in men. Men had higher\nvalues of waist circumference and fasting glucose and\nlower levels of systolic blood pressure and total and HDL\ncholesterol. Mean HDL cholesterol was within the normal\nrange in both men and women.\ndefined as having the metabolic syndrome. Among men,\n11.0% had none of the components of the metabolic syn-\nhad 4, and 5.4% had all the components. For women, the\n6.4%, respectively. As anticipated, BMI, waist circumfer-\nence, systolic blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, fasting\nglucose, and triglycerides significantly increased with\nincreasing number of metabolic syndrome components\nin both men and women. In participants with the meta-\nbolic syndrome, high fasting glucose was more frequent\nin men (P < .001) and abdominal obesity and high blood\npressure were more frequent in women (both P < .05)\n(data not shown).\nTable 2 provides the prevalence of individual components\nof the metabolic syndrome by gender and gait speed\nimpairment status. Overall, the prevalence of gait speed\n.001). Both men and women with impaired gait speed\nhad a higher prevalence of hypertension than those with\nnormal gait speed; however, there was no statistical differ-\nence in the age-adjusted prevalence of this component of\nthe metabolic syndrome. Women with impaired gait\nspeed had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of low HDL\ncholesterol, elevated fasting glucose, and the metabolic\nsyndrome itself than those with normal gait speed. In\naddition, the age-adjusted prevalence of gait speed\nimpairment significantly increased with increasing\nnumber of components of the metabolic syndrome\namong women (Figure 1).\nIn both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, no association\nwas found between the metabolic syndrome (i.e., the\npresence of at least 3 of the 5 components of the syn-\ndrome) and gait speed impairment (Table 3). When\nincluding the various components of the metabolic syn-\ndrome separately in the unadjusted model, both men and\nwomen with hypertension were more likely to have gait\nspeed impairment than those without hypertension; and\nwomen with high fasting glucose were 2.42 times more\nlikely to have impaired gait speed than those without high\nfasting glucose. Adjustment for age and level of physical\nactivity attenuated the association between high blood\npressure and gait speed impairment to nonsignificance in\nboth men and women; however, among women the asso-\nciation between high fasting glucose and gait speed\nimpairment remained significant (adjusted OR [AOR] =\nlow HDL cholesterol achieved significance (AOR = 1.88,\nadjustment for the other metabolic components, hyperg-\nlycemia and low HDL cholesterol continued to be signifi-\ncantly associated with gait speed impairment among\nwomen; and those who had abdominal obesity were less\nlikely to have gait speed impairment than those who did\n0.89) (Table 3, model 2). The associations between\nabdominal obesity and low HDL cholesterol and gait\nspeed impairment among women continued to be signif-\nicant after adding race/ethnicity, education, smoking sta-\ntus, alcohol consumption, arthritis status, and use of an\nassistive device to the adjusted 2 model (abdominal obes-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n3). In the fully adjusted model, the association between\nhyperglycemia and gait speed impairment attenuated and\nwas no longer statistically significant among women\nDiscussion\nIn this cross-sectional survey of the U.S. general popula-\ntion aged 50 years or older, we found no association\nbetween the metabolic syndrome and impaired gait speed\namong either gender. However, our findings suggest that\namong women, gait speed impairment is associated with\nabdominal obesity and low HDL cholesterol even after\nadjusting for age, level of physical activity, other compo-\nnents of the metabolic syndrome (i.e., hypertriglyceri-\ndemia, high blood pressure, and high fasting glucose),\nand other confounders. Specifically, women with abdom-\ninal obesity are significantly less likely to have gait speed\nimpairment than those without abdominal obesity, and\nwomen with low HDL cholesterol are significantly more\nlikely than those without this disorder to have gait speed\nimpairment.\nHDL cholesterol may have further clinical relevance\nbesides the inverse relationship with coronary heart dis-\nease [12]. In fact, the results of this study are consistent\nwith findings of previous studies that have linked low val-\nues of HDL cholesterol to chronic illness, severe clinical\nconditions, and functional disability in the elderly [29-\n31]. For example, Zuliani et al.[29] found that, in a longi-\ntudinal study of institutionalized adults over the age of 65\nyears, low HDL cholesterol levels were strongly associated\nwith severe disability. In addition, their longitudinal data\nsuggests that low HDL cholesterol is a potential indicator\nfor ongoing disability in basic activities of daily living\n[29]. Our finding that gait speed impairment is associated\nwith low HDL cholesterol after adjustment for level of\nphysical activity may be explained by previous studies that\nCharacteristic Men (N = 835) % (or mean) \u00b1 SE Women (N = 850) % (or mean) \u00b1 SE P\nMETs/week of leisure-time physical activity\nSmoking status\nAlcohol consumption\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; SE, standard error; METs, metabolic equivalents; LDL, low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol; HDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nreported physical activity to have little effect on increases\nin HDL cholesterol in the absence of weight loss [32,33].\nThe results of this study are not consistent with findings of\nprevious studies concerning the relationship between\nabdominal obesity and impaired gait speed [34,35]. For\nexample, Angleman et al. [34] reported that, in periretire-\nment age women (i.e., aged 55 to 74 years), increases in\nwaist circumference best predicted risk for slow gait speed\nand other disability outcomes. One possible explanation\nfor our inconsistent study results may be the applied cut-\npoint used to define impaired gait speed; Angleman et al.\nm/s. The inter-relationships between body size and pre-\ndictors of morbidity and mortality in older adults (that is,\n65 years) are controversial; and the confounding of\nAge-adjusted prevalence of gait speed impairmenta according to number of metabolic syndrome components, NHANES 1999\u00ad\nAge-adjusted prevalence of gait speed impairmenta according to number of metabolic syndrome components, NHANES 1999\u00ad\n2002.

More\nresearch is needed into the association between abdomi-\nnal obesity and gait speed as well as the most appropriate\nanthropometric measure to use in examining the relation-\nship.\nPrevious studies have reported an association between\nhyperglycemia and impaired gait speed [1,4-7]. Many\nolder adults with diabetes do not attain glycemic control\ntargets [6], and effective blood-glucose control has also\nbeen shown to delay the onset or slow the progression of\ndiabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in\nadults with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes [38]. Our\nfindings demonstrate that gait speed impairment is not\nsignificantly associated with high fasting glucose in men.\nOn the other hand, a significant association persisted after\nadjustment for age, level of physical activity, and the other\ncomponents of the metabolic syndrome among women.\nEven so, further adjustment for race/ethnicity, education,\nsmoking status, alcohol consumption, arthritis, and use of\nan assistive device attenuated the association to nonsignif-\nicance.\nControlling lifestyle-related behaviors such as amount of\nphysical activity, consuming a balanced diet, and main-\ntaining a healthy weight, may prevent, delay, or improve\ncomponents of the metabolic syndrome as well as mobil-\nactivity and weight loss (when appropriate) cannot be\nunderemphasized for their capacity to improve health\nrisks [32]; increased levels of physical activity are inversely\nrelated to morbidity and mortality independent of meta-\nbolic disorders and obesity [33]. In addition, comorbidi-\nties such as diabetes and coronary heart disease have also\nbeen associated with strength impairment [42,43],\nthough strength impairment and other impairments may\nalso be prevented through strategies that incorporate\nphysical activity, self-care, and good chronic disease man-\nagement [43]. Furthermore, earlier studies have demon-\nstrated a relationship between lower extremity muscle\nstrength and gait speed [19,44,45]; adults in their eighties\nand nineties have achieved increased gait speed through\nmuscle strength training [44].\nThis study has several limitations. First, since components\nof the metabolic syndrome are correlated, we are estimat-\ning controlled direct effects under the assumption of a\nproperly specified model and no unmeasured confound-\ning [46]. For example, we may not have totally removed\nthe confounding effects of physical activity, which has a\nstrong relationship to the individual components of the\nTable 3: Odds ratios of gait speed impairment due to the presence versus the absence of the individual components of the metabolic\nMetabolic disorder Unadjusted\nAdjusted model 1a\nAdjusted model 2b\nAdjusted model 3c\nMen\nHigh blood pressure or\nmedication use\nHigh fasting glucose or\nmedication use\nWomen\nHigh blood pressure or\nmedication use\nHigh fasting glucose or\nmedication use\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; N/A, not\napplicable.\nbAdditional adjustment for other components of the metabolic syndrome (each component: yes/no).\ncAdjusted for all the above plus race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white; non-Hispanic black; Mexican American; other), education (<high school, high\nschool), smoking status (current, former, never), alcohol consumption (non-drinker, moderate, heavy), arthritis status (dichotomous), and use of an\nassistive device (dichotomous).\ndAdjusted for all of the above except the individual components of the metabolic syndrome (i.e., age [continuous], METs/week, race/ethnicity,\neducation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, arthritis status, and use of an assistive device).\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nmetabolic syndrome and gait speed. Second, we were una-\nble to determine whether participants' impaired gait\nspeed was progressive or catastrophic, and the association\nbetween the metabolic syndrome and its components and\ngait speed may differ depending on the cause of the\nimpairment. Third, lower-extremity-strength and balance,\nboth prerequisites for the ability to walk [43], were not\naddressed in our analyses; nor was weight loss which may\nmodify the effect of level of physical activity on our results\n2002 was conducted among the noninstitutionalized U.S.\npopulation, our results probably underestimate the prev-\nalence of gait speed impairment and the metabolic syn-\ndrome and its components among the total U.S.\npopulation. Finally, because of the cross-sectional study\ndesign, we could not determine whether the relationship\nbetween the metabolic syndrome and its individual com-\nponents and gait speed impairment was a causal one.\nConclusion\nIn summary, we found no association between the meta-\nbolic syndrome and gait speed impairment. However,\namong women, we did find a significant association\nbetween low HDL cholesterol and gait speed impairment,\nand an inverse association with abdominal obesity. These\nassociations may be sex-dependent and warrant further\nresearch.
