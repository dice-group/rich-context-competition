Only original publica-\ntions were included; conference abstracts\nand dissertations were not considered. No\nlanguage restrictions were applied.\nData extraction\nThe initial electronic database searches to\nidentify potentially relevant articles for\ninclusion were performed by two independ-\nent reviewers (H.Y. and J.H.). In cases of\ninsufficient data, authors were contacted\nfor information. Any disagreements were\ndiscussed and resolved by consensus or\narbitration by a third independent reviewer\n(W-C.H.).\nAll retrieved titles and abstracts were\nexamined; those with the possibility of\nmeeting the inclusion criteria were kept for\nfurther evaluation. Final inclusion decisions\nwere made on examination of full manu-\nscripts. Reference lists of retrieved articles\nwere screened in order to identify additional\nstudies.\nPrimary outcomes were clinical pregnancy\nrate and implantation rate. Secondary out-\ncomes included biochemical pregnancy\nrate, miscarriage rate and ongoing pregnancy\nrate.\nQuality assessment\nThe quality of each study was assessed\naccording to the modified Jadad scale.17\nThe scale ranges between 0 and 7, and\nevaluates four aspects of RCTs: adequacy\nof randomization; concealment allocation;\nblinding; reporting of participant with-\ndrawals and drop outs. A score of 0 repre-\nsents the poorest methodological quality; a\nscore of 7 represents the strongest methodo-\nlogical quality. Articles with 1\u00ad3 points in\ntotal were considered to be of low quality;\nthose with 4\u00ad7 points in total were con-\nsidered to be of high quality.\nStatistical analyses\nData were combined for meta-analysis\nusing RevMan\u00d5 version 5.1 (Cochrane\nCollaboration, Oxford, UK). Dichotomous\ndata were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with\n95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical\nheterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistic,\nsuch that I2  50% indicated substantial\nheterogeneity.18 Study data were combined\nusing a fixed-effects model when hetero-\ngeneity was negligible, or a random-effects\nmodel in the case of significant heterogen-\neity. P-values < 0.05 were considered statis-\ntically significant.\nResults\nThe process of literature identification and\nselection is summarized in Figure 1.

The analysis of\nimplantation rate should be interpreted\nwith caution, however, because although\nfour of the five trials showed significantly\nhigher implantation rates, the pooled results\nwere not significant because the original\ndata for three trials could not be obtained\nThe validity and interpretation of any\nmeta-analysis depends largely on the quality\nand homogeneity of the included studies.\nAlthough the trials included in our analysis\nwere all of high quality, there were differ-\nences in study population, hCG type and\ntime of administration, type of embryo\ntransferred and embryo transfer technique.\nAlthough no heterogeneity was observed in\nthe analysis of biochemical pregnancy rate,\nclinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy\nrate or miscarriage rate, there was significant\nheterogeneity in the analysis of implantation\nrate. In addition, due to the small number of\nRCTs included in this meta-analysis, it was\nnot possible to perform funnel plots to\nexamine publication bias, or carry out sub-\ngroup analyses or meta-regression analyses.\nIt has been shown that intrauterine\nhCG infusion (500 IU/ml) at the time of\nblastocyst-stage embryo transfer (fresh or\nfrozen) does not significantly improve sus-\ntained implantation or delivery rates.14\nInterventions found to be beneficial at the\ncleavage stage should be cautiously assessed\nbefore implementation at the blastocyst\nstage. The present meta-analysis cannot\nassess whether infusion of hCG at an earlier\nstage, such as day 3, would enhance\nFigure 5.
