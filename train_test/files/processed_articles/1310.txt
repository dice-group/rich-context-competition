These findings from a nationally\nrepresentative sample of adults in the US suggest that\nhigher levels of meat and seafood consumption are\nassociated with higher serum levels of uric acid but that\ntotal protein intake is not. Dairy consumption was\ninversely associated with the serum uric acid level.\nHyperuricemia is considered the precursor of\ngout, which is the most common form of inflammatory\narthritis in adult men (1). Various commonly consumed\nfoods have long been suspected of affecting the serum\nuric acid levels, but few data are available. For example,\npatients with hyperuricemia or gout are typically advised\nto avoid habitual intake of purine-rich foods such as\nmeat and seafood (2,3), but data about the actual\nrelationship between these foods and serum levels of\nuric acid are scarce. Previous metabolic studies used\nartificial loading of purified purine (4\u00ad7) but did not\nelucidate the relationship to actual foods. In particular,\nthe relationship between total protein intake and serum\nuric acid levels remains unclear. Although high-protein\ndiets tend to contain large quantities of purines, the\n1Hyon K.

Furthermore,\nlimited data suggest that there might be an inverse\nrelationship between dairy product consumption and\nserum uric acid levels (10,11). In a recent large prospec-\ntive study of incident gout among men, we found that\nhigher meat and seafood intake independently increased\nthe risk of incident gout, while higher dairy intake was\nprotective against the risk (12). Further, higher protein\nintake did not increase the risk (12). The relationship\nbetween these dietary factors and the level of serum uric\nacid, however, was not examined in this cohort.\nIn this study based on the Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III), we\nevaluated the relationship between the intake of purine-\nrich foods, protein, and dairy products and levels of\nserum uric acid.\nStudy population. Started in 1988 and completed in\n1994, the NHANES-III included a representative sample of\nthe noninstitutionalized civilian population, which was selected\nby using a multistage, stratified sampling design. Persons 60\nyears of age and older and African American and Mexican\nAmerican persons were oversampled. After a home interview,\nparticipants were invited to attend examination sessions where\nblood and urine specimens were obtained. For some partici-\npants who were unable to attend the examination because of\nhealth reasons, a blood sample was obtained during the home\ninterview.\nWe limited our primary analyses to participants 20\nyears of age and older who attended the medical examination.\ncomplete information were included in our analyses. In addi-\ntion, after excluding participants who self-reported gout or\nwere taking allopurinol or uricosuric agents (i.e., probenecid\nand sulfinpyrazone) (n  446), we repeated our analyses\nUric acid measurement. Serum uric acid was measured\nby oxidization with the specific enzyme uricase to form allan-\ntoin and H2\n(Hitachi Model 737 Multichannel Analyzer;\nBoehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), as de-\ntailed elsewhere (13). Values are reported in milligrams per\ndeciliter (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 59.48).\nDietary assessment. Dietary assessment was based on\ndata from a food frequency questionnaire. Food frequency\ninformation was collected during the household interview and\nhas been shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing\naverage consumption (14,15). Respondents were asked how\noften over the previous month they had eaten specific food\nitems. From these data, we calculated the average daily intake\nof each food item. The average daily intakes of each item were\nthen combined to compute the following composite food\ngroups: total meat (beef, including hamburger, steaks, roast\nbeef, and meatloaf; pork and ham, including roast pork, pork\nchops, and spare ribs; liver and other organ meats, including\nheart, kidney, tongue, and tripe; bacon, sausage, and luncheon\nmeats, such as hot dogs, salami, and bologna; poultry of all\ntypes, including baked or fried chicken nuggets, chicken salad,\nand turkey); seafood (fish, including fillets, fish sticks, fish\nsandwiches, and tuna; shrimp, clams, oysters, crab, and lob-\nster); and dairy foods (milk; yogurt and frozen yogurt; ice\ncream, ice milk, and milkshakes; cheese of all types, including\nAmerican, Swiss, cheddar, and cottage cheese). The energy\nfraction from protein, fat, and carbohydrates and the total\nenergy intake were calculated from a 24-hour dietary recall list.\nAssessment of covariates. The NHANES-III collected\ninformation on body measurements (including height and\nTable 1.

The body mass index (BMI)\nwas calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the\nsquare of the height in meters.\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using survey commands of Stata software (e.g.,\nSVYMean and SVYReg) to incorporate sample weights and to\nadjust for clusters and strata of the complex sample design\n(version 7; Stata, College Station, TX).\nWe used linear regression to evaluate relationships\nbetween food groups and serum uric acid levels. The average\ndaily intake for a food group or an individual food item was\ncategorized into quintiles of intake whenever possible, and\neach quintile group of intake was compared with the lowest\nquintile group of intake. When a small stratum size of individ-\nual food intake did not allow quintile analysis, we instead used\nthe following categories, representing mean servings per day:\nanalysis treating food intake (daily servings) as a continuous\nvariable.\nMultivariate models were adjusted for age, sex, total\nenergy intake, BMI, use of diuretics, -blockers, allopurinol,\nand uricosuric agents, self-reported hypertension and gout,\nserum creatinine level, and intake of alcohol, total meats,\nseafood, and dairy foods. In the multivariate nutrient-density\nmodel for protein intake (16), we simultaneously included\nenergy intake, the percentages of energy derived from protein\nand fat, and other covariates. The coefficients from this model\ncan be interpreted as the estimated effect of substituting a\nspecific percentage of energy from protein for the same\npercentage of energy from carbohydrates (16). We repeated\nthese analyses using energy-adjusted protein values (16) in-\nstead of nutrient density.\nTrends in serum uric acid levels across quintiles of\nintake were assessed in linear regression models by using the\nmedian values of each quintile to minimize the influence of\noutliers. We also performed logistic regressions with a dichot-\nomous variable of hyperuricemia (i.e., serum uric acid 7.0\nmg/dl for men and 5.7 mg/dl for women [13]) adjusting for\nthe same covariates.\nWe explored potential interactions by sex, BMI (25\nkg/m2 versus 25 kg/m2), and alcohol use (abstainer versus\ndrinker) by testing the significance of interaction terms added\nto our final multivariate models. For all difference estimates,\nwe calculated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). All P values\nare 2-sided.\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of the study population was 45\nyears.

The\ncharacteristics according to intake of purine-rich food\ngroups, dairy foods, and total protein are shown in Table\n1. With increasing intake of meat, the age tended to\ndecrease, the proportion of males increased, and daily\nalcohol intake slightly increased. Hypertension tended\nto be less common with increasing intake of meat and\ndairy foods.\nThe serum uric acid level increased with increas-\ning total meat or seafood intake (Table 2).

There were no signif-\nicant interactions between total meat or seafood intake\nand sex, BMI, or alcohol use (P  0.27 for interaction\nfor all comparisons). The serum uric acid level in the\nhighest quintile group of dairy food intake was lower\nthan that in the lowest quintile by 0.14 mg/dl (95% CI\nDISCUSSION\nIn this nationally representative sample of men\nand women, the serum uric acid level was found to\nsignificantly increase with increasing consumption of\nmeat and seafood but not with total protein intake. In\naddition, we found a significant inverse association with\ndairy consumption. These associations were indepen-\ndent of both the other dietary factors we studied and the\nother risk factors for hyperuricemia, such as age, sex,\nBMI, serum creatinine level, hypertension, alcohol use,\nand diuretic use.\nThe current study findings suggest that the con-\nsumption of meat and seafood in amounts reflective of\nthe nationwide intake increases serum levels of uric acid.\nPreviously, the link has been primarily extrapolated from\nanimal or human metabolic experiments that examined\nthe impact of short-term artificial loading of purified\npurine (rather than actual food items) on the serum uric\nacid level (4\u00ad7). However, the precise identity and\nquantity of individual purines in most foods are not\nwell-known, especially when cooked or processed (8),\nand the bioavailability of various purines contained in\ndifferent foods varies substantially. For example, dietary\nsubstitution/addition experiments showed that RNA has\na greater effect on the serum uric acid level than does an\nequivalent amount of DNA (7), ribomononucleotides\ngreater than nucleic acid (17), and adenine greater than\nguanine (4). Thus, it has been difficult to predict\nwhether a commonly consumed food or food group\nactually affects the serum uric acid level, and if so, then\nby how much. The current study directly linked common\nfoods and serum uric acid levels and provides the\nrelevant information.\nWe found a significant inverse relationship be-\ntween dairy consumption and serum uric acid levels,\nwhich is consistent with previous reports (10,11). Inges-\ntion of milk proteins (casein and lactalbumin) has been\nshown to decrease serum uric acid levels in healthy\nsubjects via the uricosuric effect of these proteins (11).\nConversely, in a 4-week randomized clinical trial, it was\nshown that a significant increase in serum uric acid levels\nwas induced by consumption of a dairy-free diet (11).\nSince dairy products are low in purine content, dairy\nprotein may exert its urate-lowering effect without hav-\ning the concomitant purine load contained in other\nprotein sources, such as meat and seafood.\nThe total protein intake was not associated with\nthe uric acid level. Protein-rich foods have been gener-\nally perceived as surrogates for purine-rich foods, and\npatients with gout and hyperuricemia have been tradi-\ntionally advised to reduce their protein intake. While we\nare not aware of any direct evidence that ingested\nproteins per se cause hyperuricemia, there are reports\nthat suggest the contrary (8,9,18). High-protein diets are\nassociated with increased urinary excretion of uric acid\nand may lower serum levels of uric acid (8,9,18). A small\nretrospective case\u00adcontrol study showed that protein\nconsumption was slightly lower in gout patients than\ncontrols, although the difference was not statistically\nsignificant (8). Overall, our findings are consistent with\nthese previous studies. These data collectively suggest\nthat protein per se does not increase uric acid levels and\nthat the protein content of foods may not be a correct\nsurrogate for purine content.\nStrengths and limitations of our study deserve\ncomment. This study was performed in a nationally\nrepresentative sample of women and men in the US;\nthus, the findings are likely to be generalizable to men\nand women in the US. A cross-sectional study design, as\nopposed to cohort studies, tends to leave uncertainty\nregarding the temporal sequence of exposure\u00adoutcome\nrelationships and is also vulnerable to recall bias. If some\nparticipants reduced their intake of meat or seafood\nbased on previously identified hyperuricemia, it would\nlead to an underestimation of the association between\ndietary intake and serum uric acid level, making our\nfindings conservative. In the NHANES-III, the health\nexamination component that included serum uric acid\nmeasurement (outcome) was performed after the house-\nhold interview that inquired about dietary intake during\nthe previous month (exposure). Thus, it appears implau-\nsible that the serum uric acid levels measured in this\nstudy would somehow systematically influence the re-\nported intake of these factors. Our main analysis in-\ncluded those with self-reported gout and those who were\ntaking medications to treat hyperuricemia. Thus, if these\nparticipants reduced their intake of meat or seafood\nbased on their diagnosis of gout or hyperuricemia re-\nquiring treatment, it would theoretically lead to an\nunderestimation of the association between these foods\nand the serum uric acid level. However, exclusion of\nthese participants did not materially affect our results.\nThis is likely due to the low proportion of participants\nwith these characteristics (3%) or is potentially due to an\ninsubstantial change in diet after their diagnosis of gout\nor hyperuricemia requiring treatment.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that higher\nlevels of meat and seafood consumption are associated\nwith higher levels of serum uric acid, but the total\nprotein intake is not. Dairy consumption was inversely\nassociated with the uric acid level.\nREFERENCES\n1. Lawrence RC, Helmick CG, Arnett FC, Deyo RA, Felson DT,\nGiannini EH, et al.
