    "abstract": "Abstract\nUrban areas are growing unsustainably around the world; however, the growth patterns and their associated drivers vary\nbetween contexts. As a result, research has highlighted the need to adopt case study based approaches to stimulate the\ndevelopment of new theoretic understandings. Using land-cover data sets derived from Landsat images (30 m \u00d7 30 m), this\nresearch identifies both patterns and drivers of urban growth in a period (1991-2001) when a number of policy acts were\nenacted aimed at fostering smart growth in Brisbane, Australia. A linear multiple regression model was estimated using the\nproportion of lands that were converted from non-built-up (1991) to built-up usage (2001) within a suburb as a dependent\nvariable to identify significant drivers of land-cover changes. In addition, the hot spot analysis was conducted to identify spatial\nbiases of land-cover changes, if any. Results show that the built-up areas increased by 1.34% every year. About 19.56% of the\nnon-built-up lands in 1991 were converted into built-up lands in 2001. This conversion pattern was significantly biased in the\nnorthernmost and southernmost suburbs in the city. This is due to the fact that, as evident from the regression analysis, these\nsuburbs experienced a higher rate of population growth, and had the availability of habitable green field sites in relatively\nflat lands. The above findings suggest that the policy interventions undertaken between the periods were not as effective in\npromoting sustainable changes in the environment as they were aimed for.\n",

However,\nthey are often used interchangeably in the literature (Jansen,\ncover can be observed (e.g., grass, building) whereas land\nuses refer to the actual use to which the land is put (e.g.,\ngrassland for grazing, building for residences; Lambin et al.,\n2001). This research focuses on land-cover changes, which\nare arguably a major factor of climate change (Ahmed,\net al., 2000). However, this relationship is not unidirectional;\nrather, it is more complex and interdependent (Koomen &\nple, a change in land-cover pattern (e.g., deforestation) is\nlikely to affect the climate whereas any climatic changes\n(e.g., excessive temperature) are also likely to alter the land-\ncover patterns (e.g., deforestation) of an area. As a result, it is\ncritical to examine whether our land covers are changing sus-\ntainably, and in particular, in urban areas, given that urban\nland covers are more susceptible to unsustainable changes\ndue to rapid urbanization (Chang & Franczyk, 2008). Such\nan analysis not only enables to monitor changes but also\nallows steering urban growth in a more sustainable way\n(Meyer & Turner, 1994; Walker, Steffen, Canadell, &\nSustainable development has been defined as develop-\nment that \"meets the needs of the present without compro-\nmising the ability of future generations to meet their own\nneeds\" (World Commission on Environment and\nDevelopment, 1987, p. 8). This general definition has been\nexpanded with various scopes for sustainable urban develop-\nment such as the concept of smart growth (Li & Yeh, 2000).\nSmart growth principles highlight the need to foster compact\ndevelopment through promoting infill development, and\nthereby to preserve open spaces, and to limit the outward\nexpansion of cities (Berke, Godschalk, Kaiser, & Rodriguez,\n1Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nMd.

For instance, Pijanowski and\nRobinson (2011) have analyzed the rates and patterns of\nurban growth in five U.S. regions and found that all regions\ngained considerable amounts of urban land, but lost lands\nfrom agriculture, and forest areas. Similarly, in a study in\nCairns, Australia, Bohnet and Pert (2010) reported the loss of\nimportant coastal lowland habitats and agricultural lands.\nBased on a prospective analysis, that study also found that\nthe loss of important habitats including areas of high ecologi-\ncal significance within the urban footprint is highly likely\ndue to increased pressures to develop lands for urban uses\nwithin this designated area. These studies, therefore, high-\nlight the need for a critical analysis of driving forces associ-\nated with land-cover changes, and to develop land use\npolicies accordingly so that the ecologically sensitive areas\nare protected from urban invasion (Hersperger & B\u00fcrgi,\nA growing concern is evident on the adverse impacts of\nurban growth on the natural environment. Policy makers are\nsearching for options to manage land-cover change under the\nbanner of smart growth or sustainable growth (Liu, 2012).\nBeing a dynamic system, the present landscape is the result\nof past processes; and provides the basis for the formation of\nfuture landscapes (Pena et al., 2007). Therefore, the identifi-\ncation of patterns of changes in the past and their associated\nprocesses (i.e., drivers of land-cover change) can facilitate\ninformed decision making for improved, sustainable, and\nenvironmentally sound land cover in future (Antrop, 2005;\nthat the modeling of land-cover changes helps to understand\nthe processes of continuing urbanization and can also be of\nvalue in informing policy makers of possible future condi-\ntions under different scenarios. Various models have been\ndeveloped over the years to support the analysis of the causes\nor consequences of land-cover changes (Verburg, Schot,\nDijst, & Veldkamp, 2004). These are commonly classified\ninto: (a) static versus dynamic, (b) transformation versus\nallocation, (c) land use versus land user, (d) deterministic\nversus probabilistic, and (e) sector specific versus integrated\n(Jansen et al., 2007). Details about the different modeling\ntechniques have been discussed elsewhere and are not dis-\ncussed here (Koomen & Stillwell, 2007). However, the basic\nconstruct of all of these models is that they take into account\nthe patterns of past changes to model the future land cover of\nan area, based on the driving forces associated with such\nchanges.\nDespite research that has identified a number of drivers/\nfactors that underpin the land-cover changes, they vary\nbetween contexts, and also depend on the type of land-cover\nchanges under investigation (e.g., nature to urban, nature to\nnature). As a result, Verburg, van Eck, et al. (2004) have sug-\ngested that case studies of the drivers of land-cover change\ncan help to identify which factor/theory is more appropriate\nin a particular region that can also stimulate the development\nof new theoretic understandings.\nBased on the above discussion, the objective of this\nresearch is twofold: first, to understand the patterns of land-\ncover changes in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, between\nnificantly influenced land-cover changes between the peri-\nods. Brisbane was chosen to study in this research because\ndespite being the capital of Queensland, little is known about\nthe patterns, drivers, and impacts of urban growth in this\ncontext. There are two main reasons for the selection of the\nchanges that could both favorably (e.g., the Environmental\nProtection Act 1994) and unfavorably (e.g., construction of\nmajor highways) drive land-cover changes for sustainable\ndevelopment in the region. As a result, it is critical to under-\nstand whether land-cover changes occurred (un)sustainably\nin this period, and if so, then what are the impacts of different\ndrivers/policy changes; and second, a significant change in\nland use policy also occurred in the subsequent period (i.e.,\npost-2001), and therefore, knowing the impacts of different\ndrivers in previous period (pre-2001) would enable one to\nunderstand the likelihood of the post-2001 policy impacts on\npromoting sustainable urban development in the region.\nDrivers of Land-Cover Changes\nDriving forces are the forces that cause observed landscape\nchanges, that is, they are influential processes in the evolu-\ntionary trajectory of the landscape (B\u00fcrgi, Hersperger, &\ndriving forces have been identified in the literature: socio-\neconomic, political, technological, natural, and cultural\n(B\u00fcrgi et al., 2004; Verburg, van Eck, de Nijs, Dijst, & Schot,\n2004). The socioeconomic driving forces are primarily\nrooted in the economy. They include consumer demands,\nmarket structure, and structural changes, as well as govern-\nmental subsidies and incentives. A common variable in the\neconomic models of land use change is the distance between\nresidential and employment locations, as a proxy for the\ncosts associated with travel (Verburg, van Eck, et al., 2004).\nPolitical driving forces range from infrastructure policy to\npolicies on nature protection and defense. Cultural driving\nShatu et al. 3\nforces include way of life, demography, and the past devel-\nopment of a society. Technology has shaped the landscape\nenormously. Striking examples are the distinct impacts of\nrailroads and highways on settlement patterns (B\u00fcrgi et al.,\n2004). Road expansion and improvement not only lead to\nmore development but may also lead to a different pattern\nthrough a reorganization of the market structure, which then\nfeeds back to further infrastructure development (Verburg,\nSchot, et al., 2004). The natural/spatial configuration driving\nforces can be classified into the following: site factors such\nas spatial configuration (e.g., existing land uses and transpor-\ntation networks), topography and soil conditions, and natural\ndisturbances such as global change and mudslides (B\u00fcrgi\nA number of studies have found that accessibility, and\nespecially the road network, acts as a major driving force for\nthe development of cities (Antrop, 2005; Verburg, van Eck,\net al., 2004). Mediterranean landscapes have undergone\nmajor changes, mainly because of population growth (Sonis,\nShoshany, & Goldshlager, 2007). Shi, Wang, Fan, Li, and\nYang (2010) have examined the correlation between popula-\ntion growth and land-cover changes in Original-stream Zone\ncropland area increased in the region with the increases of\npopulation density at the expense of grassland. Similarly, in\na study in Papua New Guinea, Ningal et al. (2008) found that\nagricultural land use increased by 58% and population grew\nreported that most new agricultural lands were taken from\nprimary forest; and consequently, the forest area decreased\nin 2000. Population growth has also been identified as a sig-\nnificant factor by Pfeffer et al. (2005) in Honduras. This\nstudy reported that in areas of high population density, fal-\nlows give way to more intensive land uses between 1993 and\npaddy fields, dry land, and forested land decreased by 8.2%,\ncontrast, urban settlements increased by 87.6% between\nurbanization, population growth, and China's economic\nreform policies are the four major driving forces that contrib-\nuted to land-cover changes in the region. However, after\nreviewing different cases, Lambin et al. (2001) found that\nneither population nor poverty alone constitute the sole and\nmajor underlying causes of land-cover change worldwide.\nRather, peoples' responses to economic opportunities, as\nmediated by institutional factors, drive land-cover changes.\nSimilar findings have also been reported by Skonhoft and\nSolem (2001) in their analyses of macroeconomic factors in\nexplaining the reduction of wilderness land in Norway\nstudy found that the relative amount of wilderness land (i.e.,\nwilderness land as a fraction of the total area within each\ncounty) is negatively related to the level of economic\nactivity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) per\ncapita. This research also reported that the wilderness land\ndecreased with the increase of GDP over the period.\nData and Method\nThis research identifies land-cover patterns and the drivers of\nland-cover changes in Brisbane, Australia. Both macro (city\nlevel) and micro level (suburbs) changes were investigated in\nthis research. The former analysis focuses on the patterns of\nchanges at the city level (i.e., entire Brisbane) whereas the\nlatter identifies the drivers of such changes at the suburb\nlevel. Micro level analysis is important to understand detailed\nland-cover change patterns whereas the macro/aggregated\nlevel of analysis (e.g., community, city) may show patterns\nthat remain invisible at the detailed scale, which are impor-\ntant in the land use policy and planning process (Jansen et al.,\n2007; Veldkamp, Kok, De Koning, Verburg, & Bergsma,\n2001). The research also focuses on the temporal dynamics\nThe factors/drivers of land-cover changes were also selected\nfrom different sub-systems (e.g., transport/infrastructure,\npopulation growth, housing market/rent) operating within a\nsystem (e.g., urban) and thereby incorporated in the \"level of\nintegration\" concept as identified by Verburg, Schot, et al.\n(2004). The following sub-sections describe the methodol-\nogy used to take into account the above issues in this research.\nStudy Area and Policy Context\nThis study was conducted in the context of Brisbane, located\nin the middle of South East Queensland, Australia (Figure 1).\nBrisbane, the capital of Queensland, is one of the fastest\ngrowing cities in Australia, and currently, it is the third larg-\nest city in terms of population in Australia. However,\nBrisbane is the largest urban local government body (in\nterms of size) in Australia with an area of about 1,163 km2\n(by excluding areas located at different islands).Amajor por-\ntion of the city is undulating and the elevation ranges between\ntered along the Brisbane River. The spatial extent of the\nstudy area is shown in Figure 1.\nAustralia has a three-tiered system of urban governance:\nfederal (national), state and territory, and local government.\nThe role of each tier in the planning and management of land\nuses can be found elsewhere (Williams, 2007), and as a\nresult, they are not discussed here in detail. Briefly, the fed-\neral government plays little to no role in the formulation of\nplanning policies in Australia. Examples of federal powers\ninclude trade and commerce with other countries; taxation;\npostal, telegraphic, and similar services; quarantine; foreign\naffairs; immigration; foreign corporations; and defense.\nSignificantly for urban planning, these powers do not include\na general power over management of natural resources, plan-\nning, environment, and regulation of land use development.\nHowever, the federal government has certain role to play for\n4 SAGE Open\nplanning in case of national interest (e.g., cross-state collabo-\nration for the construction of motorways or river manage-\nThe general powers in these sectors (e.g., natural\nresources, environment, and regulation of land use develop-\nment) reside with the six state and two territory governments.\nFigure 1. Location of the case study area in Australia.\nShatu et al. 5\nThis has meant that each state and territory has established\nits own planning system complete with statutory, policy, and\nprocedural frameworks. The administration of these systems\nis the responsibility of each state and territory government,\nalthough in practice, they do delegate a number of day-to-\nday decision-making functions to local government. Local\ngovernment is a creation of the states. Most day-to-day plan-\nning decisions are made at local government level. Bulk of\napplications for development or planning permission are\nbeing lodged at local government level and these are assessed\nand determined by local councils based on strategic guidance\nrather than state governments. However, strategic planning is\nusually subject to state government direction. As a result,\nBrisbane is subjected to both state level policies in\nQueensland and in particular to the South East Queensland\n(SEQ) regional policies, and other policies associated with\nBrisbane City Council (Queensland Government, 2008,\nBrisbane has experienced 4.4% population growth\nQueensland Government, 2009a). To accommodate such\npopulation growth in a more sustainable way while main-\ntaining the economic prosperity of the region, the Queensland\nGovernment enacted a range of policies/acts in the subse-\nment that population growth will continue in the post-1991\nperiod was proven. Statistics showed that population\nHowever, to accommodate this further growth while ensur-\ning a balanced economic growth in the region, several major\ninfrastructure projects were undertaken in this period such as\nthe construction/upgrade of the Pacific Motorway (M1),\nLogan Motorway (M2), Inner City Bypass, and M3 (Figure\n1; Queensland Motorways, 2012). Therefore, the period\nsustainable development (e.g., the Acts) and drivers of land-\ncover changes that can lead to unsustainable growth (e.g.,\npopulation, infrastructure).\nA further population growth has also been anticipated for\nthe post-2001 period and the government intended to man-\nage such growth in a sustainable way by maintaining the\nregion's ecological footprint while enhancing its economy\nand residents' quality of life. One of the long-term strategic\nvisions for the Queensland Government (2008) is to build\nQueensland as a strong, green, smart, and healthy state by\nreducing congestion and by cutting one third of its current\national since 2005, provides specific policy guidelines to\nmeet these stated goals (Queensland Government, 2009b).\nOne of the policy guidelines is to identify an Urban Footprint,\nas a means to control unplanned urban expansion. The Urban\nFootprint establishes a boundary for urban development,\ncontaining urban growth and promoting a higher density\nurban form. By consolidating urban growth into an identified\narea, travel times and distances can be greatly reduced and\naccessibility to essential services improved. The Urban\nFootprint identifies land that can meet the region's urban\ndevelopment needs to 2031 in a more compact form.\nAs a result, it is critical to investigate the following: (a)\nperiod on land-cover changes, and (b) the differential impacts\nof various drivers that influenced land-cover changes\n2001 policy impacts on promoting sustainable urban devel-\nopment in the region can be understood.\nData\nThis research analyzed land-cover changes in Brisbane\nTM [thematic mapper] and 7 ETM [enhanced thematic map-\nper]), one for each period containing scene of WRS-2 Path\n89 and Row 79, were acquired from the United States\nGeological Surveys (USGS) database. Cloud-free images\nwere selected based on the highest temporal consistency\n(i.e., collected in the same month/season) to reduce the\neffects of both seasonal and phonological differences on\nland covers (Ottinger, Kuenzer, Liu, Wang, & Dech, 2013).\nThe Landsat TM and ETM images were captured on\nBoth images were geo-referenced and corrected to obtain a\nsystematic radiometric and geometric accuracy according to\nthe USGS Level 1 terrain (L1T) correction system based on\nground control points and a digital elevation model (DEM)\nfor topographic accuracy. Note that the study area covers\nonly a portion of the whole scene, and as a result, the images\nwere extracted to the extent of the study area as shown in\nFigure 1. The Transverse Mercator projection (within Zone\napplied to the images to match with other spatial data sets\nused in this research. The other spatial data sets (e.g., road\nnetwork, statistical local area vis-\u00e0-vis suburb, digital eleva-\ntion model) were downloaded from the Queensland\nGovernment Information website (http://dds.information.\nqld.gov.au/dd-s/). In addition, a land use map prepared in\nwere collected from the library of Queensland University of\nTechnology. These were used as reference maps. The former\nand the latter were used to assess the accuracy of the 1991\nand 2001 land-cover maps generated from the satellite\nimages.\nDerivation of Land-Cover Classes\nThis research followed the USGS land-cover classification\nscheme, which was found to be consistent in this context\naccording to the data reported by the Australian Bureau of\n6 SAGE Open\nStatistics (ABS, 2008; Table 1). The supervised classifica-\ntion method was used to classify the acquired satellite images\ninto four broad land-cover types using ENVI 5.0 software\n(Table 1). This method was chosen because the researchers\nhad a priori knowledge of the study area. As a part of the\nclassification process, a number of training sites were identi-\nfied and digitized for each land-cover type based on the ref-\nerenced aerial photographs. The number of training sites for\neach class varies between 20 (for water body) and 50 (for\nbuilt-up areas). In total, 150 training sites were selected for\neach period, which was found to be representative of previ-\nous studies on this topic (Cai, Zhang, Pan, Chen, & Wang,\nsites of both images were then analyzed in terms of their\nspectral and spatial profiles. Based on the training sites, the\nstatistical characterizations (i.e., signatures) of each land-\ncover class were developed. The maximum likelihood clas-\nsification method was then applied with equal priori\nprobability for all classes--one of the most commonly used\nmethods in the literature (White, Shao, Kennedy, &\nCampbell, 2013). The maximum likelihood classifier calcu-\nlated the probability of each pixel belonging to each class\nbased on their attributes. A filtering technique was also\napplied to generalize the classified land-cover images. This\npost-processing operation replaced the isolated pixels to the\nmost common neighboring class. Finally, the generalized\nimages were reclassified to produce the final version of land-\ncover maps for different years. Figures 2 and 3 show classi-\nrespectively.\nAn accuracy assessment exercise was then carried out to\nidentify the quality of the classified images. Using the litera-\nture, a total of 200 pixels were selected from the classified\nimages of each period based on a stratified random sampling\ntechnique (Ahmed et al., 2013; Bakr, Weindorf, Bahnassy,\npixels from the 1991 satellite image were then matched\nagainst the 1994 land use maps whereas the pixels from the\n2001 image were checked against the aerial photograph. The\nevaluation results in Tables 2 and 3 show that the overall\nand 88.5% in respective year. The high overall accuracies for\nboth images signify that the selected classes produce very\ndistinguishable reflectance and are clearly identifiable on\nearth surface.\nDeriving Land-Cover Changes\nThe classified data sets of the two periods were used to ana-\nlyze their patterns for each period. In addition to analyzing\nland-cover patterns, a conversion matrix of land covers (cell\nto cell) between the periods was derived using the\n\"Conditional Or\" tool in ArcGIS.\nTable 1 shows that only the built-up category bears the\ncharacteristics of urban land use whereas the remaining three\ncategories are more related to ecologically sensitive land\nuses. As a result, the classified images were further reclassi-\nfied into built-up and non-built-up categories, and a similar\nconversion matrix was derived. These conversion matrices\nwere then used to examine the patterns of land-cover changes\nin Brisbane between the periods.\nMeasuring Spatial Biases in Land-Cover Changes\nIn addition to identifying the statistical patterns, this research\nfurther investigates the spatial patterns of land-cover\nchanges. The aim was to examine whether the conversion\npatterns followed any spatial biases or whether they are ran-\ndomly distributed across Brisbane. As a result, the hot spot\nanalysis was conducted in ArcGIS based on the percentage\nof suburb's lands that were converted from non-built-up to\nbuilt-up areas in each suburb (157) in Brisbane. The suburbs\nwere chosen as a unit of analysis because of their relevance\nto planning and policy in Brisbane, Australia. Although all\nproperties in Brisbane are subject to at least two plans (e.g.,\nSEQ Regional Plan, Council's City Plan), many suburbs/\ncommunities in Brisbane also have their own local or neigh-\nborhood plan as a part of the City Plan. Consequently, these\nneighborhood plans are used to focus where growth and\nchange occur, and to protect the character of housing and\necologically sensitive areas (e.g., parks and wildlife corri-\nThe hot spot analysis tool calculated the Getis-Ord Gi*\nstatistics for each suburb based on the proportion of con-\nverted land in each suburb and also taking into account the\nproportion of conversion in surrounding suburbs. This means\nthat a suburb with a high percentage may not be a statistically\nsignificant hot spot unless it is surrounded by suburbs with\nhigh percentages of conversion. The tool calculated local\nsum of conversion for a suburb and its neighbors and com-\npares proportionately with the sum of conversions associated\nTable 1.

The hot spot analysis was conducted using the\ninverse distance conceptualization of spatial relationship.\nThis method is suitable for continuous data type and in situ-\nations where the closer the features are in space, the more\nlikely they are to influence each other. A fixed distance band\nwas used to generate the hot spots because the data sets were\npolygonal in nature (suburbs) with a large variation in sizes.\nThe Multi-Distance Spatial Cluster Analysis (Ripley's k\nfunction) tool in ArcGIS was used to derive an appropriate\ndistance band that exhibited maximum spatial autocorrela-\ntion (Kamruzzaman, Baker, Washington, & Turrell, 2014).\nThe tool returned z scores and p values for each suburb.\nInvestigating the Exurbanization Process in\nBrisbane\nFurther exploratory analysis was conducted to understand\nwhether the land use conversion patterns in Brisbane could\nbest be explained with the exurbanization phenomenon.\nFigure 2. Classified land-cover image of Brisbane in 1991.\nNote. SLA = statistical local area; CBD = central business district.\n8 SAGE Open\nCrump (2003) has mentioned that exurban development\noccurs beyond the suburbs and is outside easy commuting\nrange to the central city. As a result, the exurban locations are\nviewed as the middle ground between densely populated\n(urban and suburban) regions and sparsely settled rural\n(towns and countryside) areas (Pacione, 2009). Therefore, it\nis neither urban nor rural; it may, in fact, represent a new\nsettlement form that is giving rise to a unique landscape.\nNelson (1992) has identified four principal factors explain-\ning the exurbanization phenomenon: (a) continued decon-\ncentration of employment and the rise of exurban\nindustrialization; (b) the latent anti-urban and rural location\npreferences; (c) improved technology that makes exurban\nliving possible (e.g., car); and (d) an apparent policy bias\nfavoring exurban development over compact development.\nTo assess the exurbanization process, the converted built-\nup areas were spatially classified according to five major\nsub-divisions in Brisbane: (a) Inner Brisbane, (b) Northwest\nInner Brisbane, (c) Southeast Inner Brisbane, (d) Northwest\nOuter Brisbane, and (e) Southeast Outer Brisbane. Therefore,\nthe Inner Brisbane area represents the core of the city whereas\nboth Northwest Inner Brisbane and Southeast Inner Brisbane\nFigure 3. Classified land-cover image of Brisbane in 2001.\nNote. SLA = statistical local area.\nShatu et al. 9\nare the traditional suburbs in Brisbane. In contrast, according\nto Crump (2003), Northwest Outer Brisbane and Southeast\nOuter Brisbane possess the quality of exurban areas in\nBrisbane. Consequently, the locational preferences of people\nto live in these areas were investigated based on population\nrepresentative of the second factor of Nelson (1992; i.e., the\nlatent anti-urban and rural location preferences) as discussed\nearlier.\nIdentifying Drivers of Land-Cover Changes\nGiven that the driving forces cause observed landscape\nchanges, such causal relationship needs to be verified objec-\ntively and scientifically. Four criteria have been proposed in\nthe literature to establish causal linkages: (a) associations--a\nstatistically significant relationship between the cause (inde-\npendent variable) and effect (dependent variable); (b) non-\nspuriousness--a relationship that cannot be attributed to\nanother variable, that is, no third factor creates an accidental\nrelationship between the variables; (c) time precedence/\norder--the cause precedes the effect; and (d) causal mecha-\nnisms--a logical explanation for why the alleged cause\nshould produce the observed effect (Singleton & Straits,\n1999). An effort has been made to satisfy these criteria in\nidentifying the drivers of land-cover changes in Brisbane\nthrough estimating a multiple linear regression model.\nThe model was estimated using the proportion of non-\nbuilt-up land in 1991 that was converted into built-up use by\n2001 as an outcome variable. The variable was selected\nbased on the literature (Ottensmann, 2003). Note that differ-\nent types of models have been estimated in previous studies\nto identify drivers of land-cover changes including linear\nmultiple regression (Skonhoft & Solem, 2001), binary logis-\ntic regression (Braimoh & Vlek, 2005; Cheng & Masser,\n(Turner, Wear, & Flamm, 1996), aggregated logit model\n(Ottensmann, 2003), and so on. The binary logistic regres-\nsion model is suitable when the outcome variable is binary in\nnature (e.g., 1 = change from non-built-up to built-up areas;\n0 = no change). This model is better suited when cell-to-cell\nconversion patterns are analyzed. However, unlike the cell-\nbased analysis, the drivers were identified at suburb (statisti-\ncal local area) level in this research, and as a result, analysis\nshows that all suburbs in Brisbane experienced some levels\nbinary logit model was not suitable to operationalize in this\nresearch. The multinomial logit model is appropriate when\nthe outcome variable contains discrete conversion categories\n(e.g., from vegetation to built-up, from vegetation to water\nbody, etc.; Hepinstall, Alberti, & Marzluff, 2008). Although\nit was possible to categorize the outcome variable into sev-\neral discrete classes to run a multinomial logit model, such\ndiscretization would result in a natural ordering among the\nTable 3.

In addi-\ntion, such discretization means that minor variations would\nnot be captured in the model (Ottensmann, 2003).As a result,\na linear regression model was estimated. The outcome vari-\nable was also found to be approximately normally distrib-\nuted supporting the suitability of linear regression model\n(Figure 4).\nPotential drivers of land-cover changes as identified in the\nliterature (discussed in section \"Drivers of Land-Cover\nChanges\") were entered as independent factors in the model.\nThese included base population of the suburb in 1991, popu-\ntance to the motorways, distance to the central business\ndistrict (CBD), base rental (residential) values (Aus$) in a\nweek in the suburb in 1996, changes (%) in rental values\nurb land that was designated as built-up in 1991, topography\n(average slope), and proportion of individuals born in\nAustralia. Clearly some of the included factors meet all the\nfour criteria used to assess causal relationships (e.g., popula-\ntion growth, changes in rental values). Although other fac-\ntors do not satisfy the time precedence criterion (e.g., slope,\nAustralian), these factors were derived based on the well-\ndeveloped literature on this topic, and they together corre-\nspond to the five categories of drivers as discussed in section\n\"Drivers of Land-Cover Changes.\"\nStraight line distance from each converted cell to the\nmotorway and CBD was derived. These were subsequently\naveraged for each suburb. The distance to CBD variable\nreflects both accessibility and economic types of driver\nbecause most of the jobs and higher order goods and services\n(e.g., banks) are located in the CBD whereas the distance to\nmotorway variable represents an accessibility type of driver.\nage weekly rental (residential) values associated with each\nsuburb and their changes. The census data were downloaded\nfrom the ABS website (http://www.abs.gov.au/). Originally,\nthe rental value data were coded at census collection district\n(CCD) level (the smallest administrative unit used to collect\ncensus data in Australia). This was summarized to get an\naverage rental value at suburb level (suburb is the next higher\nlevel unit of CCDs). The rental values were assumed to be\nrepresentative of property values in these suburbs, and there-\nfore, they represent an economic type of driver associated\nwith land-cover changes. This is due to the fact that a higher\nconversion rate was expected (demanded) at lower priced\nland. The amount of urban land that existed in 1991 repre-\nsents the spatial interaction/neighborhood effect. Urban\nexpansion is only possible if there are lands available to\nbuild new houses. Number of population within a suburb\nindicates their habitability. Verburg, Schot, et al. (2004) have\nmentioned that urban expansion is often situated right next to\nthe already existing urban area. One of the biophysical/natu-\nral characteristics included in this study is the elevation\n(slope), which has been identified to be directly related to\nsettlement patterns (Verburg, van Eck, et al., 2004). The pro-\nportion of people born in Australia represents cultural fac-\ntors. About 71.5% of the people in Brisbane were born in\nAustralia. Any pattern of this factor would indicate the exis-\ntence of social segregation in land-cover conversion pattern.\nThe regression analysis was conducted using the Enter\nmethod, and the multicollinearity among the variables was\nchecked based on the Eigenvalue and Condition Index\nmethod.\nResults\nPatterns of Land Cover in Brisbane\nUpland natural areas were the main land-cover type in 1991,\nwhich comprised of 39.51% of the total land area in Brisbane\n(Table 4). An approximately equal proportion of areas\n(36.88%) were found to be dense vegetated land in this\nperiod in Brisbane, followed by built-up (21.61%) and water\nbody (2%). The overall patterns of land-cover classes\nchanged dramatically in 2001 (Table 4).

It is appar-\nent from Figure 5 that urban growth (both from non-built-up\nto built-up and the opposite) took place across the city. Also\nnoticeable from Figure 5 is that the conversion into built-up\narea took place mainly in the outskirts of the city. Table 6\ndetails the contribution of different non-built-up categories\nto the formation of built-up lands in 2001.\nIt is clear from Table 6 that almost every land-cover cat-\negory in 1991 received land from all other categories as well\nas contributed to the formation of all other categories in\n2001.

Clearly,\nFigure 6d shows that the coastal areas located in the east of\nBrisbane were subjected to conversion from water body to\nbuilt-up areas. However, the conversions to the built-up areas\nwere mainly in the southern and northern part of the city.\nNote. SLA = statistical local area; CBD = central business district.\nFigure 6. Specific land-cover conversion patterns in Brisbane.\nNote. SLA = statistical local area.\nSpatial Biases in the Conversion Pattern: From\nNon-Built-Up to Built-Up Areas\nFigures 5 and 6 show that the conversion from non-built-up\ninto built-up usage took place mainly in the outskirts of\nBrisbane. However, some orange spots are clearly evident\nwithin the inner city areas (Figure 5). Despite the existence\nof orange spots in different places in Figure 5, the hot spot\nanalysis results in Figure 7 confirm that the rate of conver-\nsion was significantly higher in the southernmost and north-\nernmost suburbs (brown and orange colors) whereas some of\nthe inner suburbs experienced a significantly lower rate of\nconversion (greenish color). Therefore, the conversion pat-\ntern shows some levels of sectoral bias in Brisbane.\nConversion From Non-Built-Up Into Built-Up\nAreas and the Process of Exurbanization\nThe spatial distributions of the converted lands within the five\nmajor sub-divisions in Brisbane are shown in Figure 8. Table\n7 shows that although the population in Brisbane grew by\nexurbs of Brisbane, with the greatest numbers of exurbanites\nFigure 7.

Despite the total\nnumber being higher in the north in 2001, the rate of growth\nwas, however, significantly higher in the south (27% in the\nsouth compared with 22% in the north) between the periods.\nIn addition, the conversion pattern was significantly higher in\nthe south (Figure 7;ABS, 2014). The findings suggest that the\nsouth experienced the exurbanization process more inten-\nsively between the periods than the north. This could be due\nto the fact that the north experienced the exurbanization pro-\ncess earlier than the south as evident in their population figure\nin 1991. Consequently, the north possessed little habitable\nland to accommodate further conversion between 1991 and\n2001. The exurbanization phenomenon was further confirmed\nwith the lowest rate of population growth within the inner\nsuburban areas (even lower than the Inner Brisbane area), as\nDespite the evidence of exurbanization process, the fol-\nlowing is not known: \"Why did the exurbanization process\ntake place?\" or \"why were the conversions so high in those\nhot spot areas?\" or \"was it only because of the transport cor-\nridor or did other factors contribute to the high conversion\npattern in those areas?\" The results from the regression anal-\nysis answered these questions as discussed below.\nFigure 8. Sub-divisions of Brisbane and the spatial distribution of land-cover changes.\nNote. CBD = central business district.\nDrivers of Land-Cover Changes in Brisbane\nTable 8 shows the results found from the regression analysis\nin identifying the drivers of land-cover changes (from non-\nbuilt-up to built-up) in Brisbane. About 40% of the variance\nin data was found to be explained by the factors considered\nfor regression analysis. This was also found to be representa-\ntive of previous studies (Skonhoft & Solem, 2001; Verburg,\nvan Eck, et al., 2004). The part and partial correlations and\nthe multicollinearity analysis results, using all the explana-\ntory variables entered in the regression model, showed that\nnone of the explanatory variables had a lower level of toler-\nance value. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was found to\nbe acceptable for all factors (Table 8). The collinearity diag-\nnostics (based on the Eigenvalue and Condition Indices) also\nconfirmed that there were no serious problems with\nmulticollinearity.\nAmong the different factors considered, four of them were\nfound to have significant association with the conversion of\nnon-built-up areas into built-up areas (e.g., slope, population\nsuburb area as built-up in 1991). The standardized beta coef-\nficients in the model show that the \"population growth\"\nwithin a suburb was the main driver of urban growth in that\nsuburb in Brisbane between the periods. Moreover, a positive\ncoefficient of the \"suburb population in 1991\" indicates that\nurban growth was higher in those suburbs where the popula-\ntion was already higher in 1991. However, this is only true in\nthose suburbs where there were lands available to accommo-\ndate further growth. A negative coefficient of the \"percent of\nsuburb area as built-up in 1991\" factor suggests that urban\ngrowth was significantly lower in already built-up areas. In\naddition, a negative coefficient of the \"slope\" factor indicates\nthat the conversion process was significantly lower in hilly\nsuburbs. In summary, the above findings signify that urban\ngrowth took place in those suburbs where there was pre-\noccupied habitation but with the potential to accommodate\nmore people in terms of available flat lands.\nTable 7.

The findings from this research\nbear important policy implications for Brisbane vis-\u00e0-vis\nQueensland in Australia, given that the drivers of land-cover\nchanges vary depending on the context (Verburg, van Eck, et\nal., 2004). However, the lessons learnt from this research can\neffectively be used to make an informed land use policy deci-\nThe Queensland Government aimed at promoting sustain-\nable urban growth by enacting various policies and Acts\n(e.g., the Environmental Protection Act 1994, the Integrated\nPlanning Act 1997). The analyses presented in this research\nenabled us to evaluate the effectiveness of such policy mea-\nsures based on an understanding of the patterns of land-cover\nchanges and by identifying their associated processes.\nThe findings presented in this study clearly show that the\npolicy interventions undertaken in the study period (1991-\n2001) were not as effective in promoting sustainable changes\nin the environment as they were aimed for. Most new devel-\nopments took place in green fields, thereby increasing the\necological footprint in the city (Tewolde & Cabral, 2011).\nThe influence of nature protection policies (e.g., the\nEnvironmental Protection Act 1994) was found to have little\nrole because about 3,850 hectares of vegetated lands and\nThe results from both the exploratory (e.g., hot spot,\ndescriptive statistics showing population growth with differ-\nent sub-divisions of Brisbane) and confirmatory (e.g., regres-\nsion) analyses showed the evidence of exurbanization\nprocess in Brisbane. The hot spot analysis showed that the\nconversions were significantly clustered in the outer\n(Northern and Southern) parts of the city. Population growth\nin these areas was significantly higher, whereas the popula-\ntion growth in Inner Suburb areas was significantly lower.\nConsistent with prior studies (Pfeffer et at., 2005; Sonis et\nal., 2007), results presented in this study showed that popula-\ntion growth is the main driving force of land-cover change in\nBrisbane. From this perspective, the findings clearly justify\nthat the current land use policies (e.g., South Queensland\npromoting sustainable urban growth. This is due to the fact\nthat the current policies aim to accommodate population\ngrowth through facilitating development in a more compact\nway--that is, smart growth--either through infill develop-\nment or through increasing density in some selected nodes or\nactivity centers (Queensland Government, 2009b). The cur-\nrent policy would also be effective because it identified\nurban footprint areas, and all developments must be located\nwithin the footprint to protect, manage, and enhance the\nregion's biodiversity values and associated ecosystem ser-\nvices and maximize the resilience of ecosystems to the\nimpacts of climate change. However, care must be taken to\nprotect the natural lands located within the urban footprint\nareas.\nIn addition to verifying the demographic hypothesis (pop-\nulation growth) of land-cover changes, this research also\nverifies the natural configuration hypothesis that topography\n(e.g., steep slope) can act as a natural constraint on urban\ngrowth (M\u00fcller, Steinmeier, & K\u00fcchler, 2010). However, the\ninsignificant influence of the ethnicity (e.g., percent\nAustralian) factor falsified the cultural hypothesis of land-\ncover changes in this context (B\u00fcrgi et al., 2004; Hersperger\ncase of technological (access to motorways) and economic\n(access to CBD, rental values) drivers.\nDespite the evidence of exurbanization process presented\nin this research, the findings are not complete because a\nnumber of other relevant factors were not analyzed in this\nresearch. Pacione (2009) has indicated that exurbia tends to\nbe dominated by middle-class residents, many of whom\ncommute long distances to work in the city or in the newer\nsuburbs. Other groups are also present in the exurban loca-\ntions including retirees and young households seeking social\nstatus, more land, and new housing at a lower cost than is\navailable in the suburbs. In addition, this study investigates\nthe exurbanization process only within the local government\nboundary of Brisbane. It is possible that the exurbanization\nprocess was more pronounced outside the study area bound-\nary. Future research should seek to explore this issue in a\nwider geographic context by utilizing the above omitted\nindicators and improve on the model presented in this\nresearch. Despite the rental values being considered in this\nresearch as a proxy of land value, the results were somewhat\nsurprising showing their insignificant impacts on urban\ngrowth in this context. Future studies should utilize the land\nvalue data to verify the findings reported in this study. In\naddition, although evidence in this research shows a surpris-\ning and significant land conversion pattern--from built-up\ninto non-built-up areas--these were not investigated inten-\nsively. Future research should examine this phenomenon to\nfurther the knowledge on this topic.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
