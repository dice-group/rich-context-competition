Sugar-sweetened soft drinks contain large amounts of fructose, which may significantly increase serum uric\nacid levels and the risk of gout. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between sugar-sweetened soft drink intake,\ndiet soft drink intake, and serum uric acid levels in a nationally representative sample of men and women.\nMethods. Using data from 14,761 participants age >20 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (1988\u00ad1994), we examined the relationship between soft drink consumption and serum uric acid levels using\nlinear regression. Additionally, we examined the relationship between soft drink consumption and hyperuricemia (serum\nuric acid level >7.0 mg/dl for men and >5.7 mg/dl for women) using logistic regression. Intake was assessed by a\nfood-frequency questionnaire.\nResults. Serum uric acid levels increased with increasing sugar-sweetened soft drink intake. After adjusting for covari-\nates, serum uric acid levels associated with sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption categories (<0.5, 0.5\u00ad0.9, 1\u00ad3.9, and\nconfidence interval 0.11, 0.73; P < 0.001 for trend). The multivariate odds ratios for hyperuricemia according to the\nDiet soft drink consumption was not associated with serum uric acid levels or hyperuricemia (multivariate P > 0.13 for\ntrend).\nConclusion. These findings from a nationally representative sample of US adults suggest that sugar-sweetened soft drink\nconsumption is associated with serum uric acid levels and frequency of hyperuricemia, but diet soft drink consumption\nis not.\nINTRODUCTION\nHyperuricemia is considered the precursor of gout,\nwhich is the most common inflammatory arthritis for\nadult men (1). The doubling of the prevalence (2) and\nincidence (3) of gout in the US over the last few decades\n(4) coincided with a substantial increase in soft drink\nand fructose consumption (5). For example, soft drink\nconsumption in the US increased by 61% in adults from\nsent the largest single food source of calories in the US\ndiet (5,6). Conventional dietary recommendations for\ngout have focused on restriction of purine and alcohol\nintake, but not on sugar-sweetened soft drink intake\n(7,8). Although these soft drinks contain low purine\nlevels, they contain large amounts of fructose, which is\nthe only carbohydrate known to increase uric acid levels\n(9\u00ad13). This led us to hypothesize that sugar-sweetened\nsoft drink consumption is positively associated with\nserum uric acid levels, but that diet soft drink intake is\nnot. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-\nsectional study based on the US Third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III) (14,\n15). In addition, we examined whether the intake of\norange juice, a common source of naturally occurring\nfructose, was associated with serum uric acid levels in\nthis study.\n1Jee Woong J.

After a home interview, participants were invited to\nattend examination sessions where blood and urine spec-\nimens were obtained. For participants unable to attend the\nexamination for health reasons, a blood sample was\nobtained during the home interview. Our analysis was\nlimited to participants age 20 years who attended the\nmedical examination, and only included the 14,761 par-\ninformation. We repeated our analyses among 14,317 par-\nticipants after excluding those who self-reported gout or\nwere taking allopurinol or uricosuric agents (n  444).\nIn addition, we analyzed the NHANES-III Supplemental\nNutrition Survey (SNS) of Older Americans (16), because\ntotal fructose intake was estimated only in this subpopu-\nlation. The NHANES-III SNS was conducted to estimate\nusual dietary intake in a sample of older subjects (age 50\nyears), and to identify the characteristics that influence\ndietary survey collection. Our analysis of these data was\nlimited to the 2,570 participants with complete informa-\ntion.\nUric acid measurement. Serum uric acid levels were\nmeasured by oxidization with the specific enzyme uricase\nto form allantoin and H2\nnel Analyzer; Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, India-\nnapolis, IN). Details about quality-control procedures have\nbeen published elsewhere (15). Values are reported in\nmilligrams per deciliter; to convert to micromoles per liter,\nAssessment of sweetened soft drink and diet soft drink\nintake. During the home interview, intakes of sugar-\nsweetened soft drinks, diet soft drinks, and orange juice\nwere determined from responses to the food-frequency\nquestionnaire that was administered to participants to as-\nsess their usual consumption over the prior month. Food-\nfrequency questionnaire assessment of dietary intake has\nbeen shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing\nAssessment of covariates. The average daily intakes of\ntotal meat, seafood, and dairy foods were derived from\nresponses to the food-frequency questionnaire (19,20). In-\ntake of total energy and fructose was calculated from a\n24-hour dietary recall. Total caffeine intake was calculated\nusing US Department of Agriculture food composition\nsources (21). We estimated that the caffeine content of the\nindividual beverages was 137 mg/cup of coffee, 47 mg/cup\nThe NHANES-III collected information on body measure-\nments (including height and weight), medication use\n(including diuretics, antihypertensives, allopurinol, and\nuricosuric agents), medical conditions (including self-\nreported hypertension and gout), and serum creatinine\nlevels. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by\nusing the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\nBody mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing a par-\nticipant's weight in kilograms by the square of their height\nin meters.\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were com-\nputed using survey commands of Stata statistical software\n(e.g., svymean and svyreg; Stata Corporation, College Sta-\ntion, TX) to incorporate sample weights and adjust for\nclusters and strata of the complex sampling design.\nWe used linear regression modeling to evaluate the re-\nlationship between beverage and fructose intake and se-\nrum uric acid level. Sweetened and diet soft drink con-\nsumption were each categorized into 5 groups of average\nFructose intake in the NHANES-III SNS was categorized\nThese cut-points were chosen, considering the distribu-\ntion of the data, to ensure sufficient sample size for each\ncategory according to the Analytic and Reporting Guide-\nlines of the NHANES-III (26). Multivariate models for sug-\nar-sweetened soft drink consumption were adjusted for\nage; sex; smoking status; total energy intake; BMI; use of\ndiuretics, beta-blockers, allopurinol, and uricosuric\nagents; self-reported hypertension; GFR; and intake of\nmeat, seafood, dairy foods, coffee, tea, total caffeine, diet\nsoft drinks, and orange juice. Multivariate models for fruc-\ntose intake were adjusted for the same variables, except for\nintake of diet soft drinks and orange juice. Trends in serum\nuric acid levels across categories of intake were assessed in\nlinear regression models by using the median values of\neach category to minimize the influence of outliers. We\nalso performed logistic regression with a dichotomous out-\ncome of hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level 7.0 mg/dl\nin men and 5.7 mg/dl in women) (15), adjusting for the\nsame covariates. We examined the potential impact of an\nalternative definition of hyperuricemia (serum uric acid\nlevel 6.0 mg/dl regardless of sex) in these regression\nmodels.\nWe explored potential interactions by sex, age group\nkg/m2), and alcohol use (abstainer versus drinker) by test-\ning the significance of interaction terms added to our final\nmultivariate models. For all difference estimates and odds\nratios (ORs), we calculated 95% confidence intervals (95%\nCIs). All P values were 2-sided.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics. The population's mean age was 45\nyears.

The association was independent of dietary and other\nrisk factors for hyperuricemia such as age, sex, BMI, alco-\nhol use, renal function, hypertension, and diuretic use.\nThe association persisted across subgroups stratified by\nsex, age, BMI, and alcohol use, and it tended to be greater\nin men. We also found a modest association with orange\njuice intake. In contrast, there was no significant associa-\ntion between diet soft drink consumption and serum uric\nacid level.\nThe difference in serum acid level between the extreme\ncategories of sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption was\n0.4 mg/dl. This magnitude of a population mean difference\nin serum uric acid level (20,27) can be translated into a\nclinically relevant difference in the risk for incident gout,\nas demonstrated in our previous studies (19,28). For ex-\nample, an increase of 1 daily serving in beer intake was\nassociated with a mean serum uric acid level increase of\n0.4 mg/dl in a cross-sectional analysis of the NHANES-III\nparticipants (19), and with a 50% increased risk of inci-\ndent gout in our prospective analysis of the Health Profes-\nsionals Follow-Up Study (27). This potentially significant\nimpact on the eventual risk of gout is also supported by\nour results using hyperuricemia as a dichotomous out-\ncome, and when using various definitions for hyperurice-\nmia.\nSugar-sweetened soft drinks contain large amounts of\nfructose from added sugars, whereas orange juice and\nother sweet fruit juices contain naturally occurring fruc-\ntose. Fructose induces uric acid production by increasing\nATP degradation to AMP, a uric acid precursor (4,9,29\u00ad\n31). Fructose phosphorylation in the liver uses ATP, and\nthe accompanying phosphate depletion limits regenera-\ntion of ATP from ADP, which in turn serves as a substrate\nfor the catabolic pathway to uric acid formation (32). Thus,\nwithin minutes after fructose infusion, plasma (and later\nurinary) uric acid concentrations increase (9). In conjunc-\ntion with purine nucleotide depletion, rates of purine syn-\nthesis de novo are accelerated, thus potentiating uric acid\nproduction (33). In contrast, glucose and other simple\nsugars do not have this effect (13). Furthermore, fructose\ncould indirectly increase serum uric acid levels and the\nrisk of gout by increasing insulin resistance and circulat-\ning insulin levels (34). Both experimental studies in ani-\nmal models and short-term feeding trials among humans\nFigure 1. Multivariate adjusted serum uric acid levels according to categories of A, sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption, and B, diet\nsoft drink consumption. Error bars indicate standard errors. Serum uric acid levels are adjusted for the same covariates included in the final\nmultivariate model in Table 2. Data are presented incorporating sample weights and adjusted for clusters and strata of the complex sample\ndesign of the Third National  .\nsuggest that higher fructose intake contributes to insulin\nresistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperinsulin-\nThere are important practical implications of our re-\nsults. It was over 100 years ago that Osler prescribed diets\nlow in fructose as a means to prevent gout (13). In his 1893\ntext (39) he wrote, \"The sugar should be reduced to a\nminimum. The sweeter fruits should not be taken\" (13).\nHowever, conventional dietary recommendations for gout\nhave focused on restriction of purine intake, although\nlow-purine diets are often high in carbohydrates, includ-\ning fructose-rich foods (7). Our data provide evidence that\nfructose poses a substantial risk for hyperuricemia, thus\nsupporting the validity and importance of Osler's ap-\nproach. Furthermore, because fructose intake is associated\nwith increased serum insulin levels, insulin resistance,\nimpact from fructose is expected to be larger in gout pa-\ntients, who often have the metabolic syndrome (63%) (42)\nand are overweight (71%) (43). Conversely, the conven-\ntional low-purine diet approach that allows fructose con-\nsumption may have contributed to the high prevalence of\nthe metabolic syndrome observed in cross-sectional stud-\nreducing fructose intake in dietary recommendations for\nhyperuricemia in order to reduce the patient's serum uric\nacid levels, as well as to improve long-term outcomes.\nWe found that the increase in serum uric acid level\nassociated with sugar-sweetened soft drink intake tended\nto be larger among men than women. This could be due to\ndifferences in sex hormones. Studies in rats have shown\nthat female sex hormones protect against the development\nof hyperinsulinemia associated with high fructose intake\n(46\u00ad48). Because hyperinsulinemia results in decreased\nrenal excretion of urate and correlates with higher serum\nuric acid levels (49\u00ad51), the protective effect of estrogen\nmay lead to an attenuated effect of fructose on serum uric\nacid levels. Confirmation of these findings by future stud-\nies would allow more refined dietary recommendations for\nboth men and women with hyperuricemia or gout.\nThe strengths and limitations of our study deserve com-\nment. This study was performed in a nationally represen-\ntative sample of US women and men; thus, the findings are\nlikely to be generalizable to the US adult population. As\nopposed to prospective studies, a cross-sectional study\ndesign tends to leave uncertainty regarding the temporal\nsequence of exposure\u00adoutcome relations, and is also vul-\nnerable to recall bias. For example, if some participants\nswitched their alcohol consumption to nonalcoholic bev-\nerages based on previously identified gout or hyperurice-\nmia before the NHANES study, the previous alcohol effect\nmight theoretically lead to a positive association with the\nnonalcoholic beverages. However, exclusion of individu-\nals with self-reported, lifetime history of physician-diag-\nnosed gout, or of those who were taking medications to\ntreat hyperuricemia, did not materially alter our results.\nFurthermore, the fact that the positive association existed\nwith sugar-sweetened soft drinks but not with diet soft\ndrinks argues against this potential scenario. Given the\nabsence of existing conventional recommendations on soft\ndrink consumption for hyperuricemia and gout, it is un-\nlikely that some participants changed their sweetened or\ndiet soft drink intake based on previously identified hy-\nperuricemia or gout. In the NHANES-III, the health exam-\nination component including serum uric acid measure-\nment (outcome) was performed after the household\ninterview that inquired about intake of these beverages\nduring the past month (exposure). Thus, it appears im-\nplausible that the serum uric acid levels measured in this\nstudy would somehow systematically influence the re-\nported intake of these beverages. Similarly, differential\neffects between the beverages would not be explained by\nthese potential methodologic limitations.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that sugar-sweetened\nsoft drink intake is associated with a higher level of uric\nacid and frequency of hyperuricemia, but that diet soft\ndrink intake is not. Furthermore, orange juice intake may\nalso be associated with a higher level of serum uric acid.\nThese data support strategies to reduce fructose consump-\ntion in the dietary recommendations for individuals with\nhyperuricemia and gout.\nFigure 2.
