Participants\ncomprised 80 students from eight schools drawn from four provinces in the country. Of the 80 participants, 40 were females\nand 40 were males.This qualitative research adopted phenomenological design.Two research instruments--a biographical\nform and a blank sheet of paper--were used in data collection. Content analysis method was used in analyzing the written\nand nonquantitative data collected. Results of data analysis revealed 20 salient characteristics of trained ineffective teachers\nin secondary schools.These characteristics are as follows: wastage of students' time, poor mastery of the subject, source of\nboredom to students, partial treatment of students, lack of respect for students, low level of self-confidence, poor mastery of\nteaching skills, emotional immaturity, inappropriate dressing, injurious to students, fond of frivolous talk, miscommunicate in\nclass, poor in providing feedback, nondialogical in class, poor in maintaining discipline, immoral in behavior, unapproachable to\nstudents, poor in counseling, poor psychological health, and autocratic to students.The findings of this study may be useful to\nstakeholders in education in developing instruments that may be used to identify ineffective teachers in schools.\n",

There is no doubt that most teachers in schools are\neffective and are committed to their students and profession,\nand are trying their best to meet students' needs every day.\nResearch has shown that effective teachers can lead all stu-\ndents to learn, even those from poor families or who have\nuninvolved parents (Stronge, 2010). But, the key question is,\n\"If most teachers are effective, does it matter that a small\npercentage of them are ineffective?\" The answer to this\nquestion is that yes, it matters a lot because one ineffective\nteacher inhibits the learning of a large number of students\nover time. Teachers are responsible for anywhere from 20 to\n200 students each year depending on the school size, class\nsize, and school level (whether primary or secondary). From\nthese estimates it is plausible that an ineffective teacher can\ndepress the achievement and inhibit the learning of many\nstudents during the course of his or her career (Chait, 2010).\nThe problems posed by ineffective teachers to students\nare numerous, and some of the most vivid and influential\nmemories that students have come from devastating incidents\nwith ineffective teachers in a hostile learning environment\n(Walls, Nardi, von Minden, & Hoffman, 2002). An ineffec-\ntive teacher makes it difficult for students to learn or decreases\ntheir desire to learn by a lack of enthusiasm for the subject, by\na hostile or inappropriate behavior toward the students, by a\nfailure to maintain discipline in the class, or by unfairly pre-\nferring some students to others. Research findings based on\nvalue-added scores of students in schools in the United States\nindicates that three straight years of the most ineffective\nteachers produce children who average the 45th percentile\nnationally. By comparison, three straight years of the most\neffective teachers produce children that average the 95th per-\ncentile. Furthermore, research shows that students do not\n\"make it up\" the next year. The damage of an ineffective\nteacher lingers, even if the student has more effective teachers\nin the following years (Lasagna, Laine, & Behrstock-Sherrat,\n1Moi University, Eldoret, Kenya\nCorresponding Author:\nHezborn M.

Misigo1,\nElizabeth A. Owino1, and Catherine K. Simiyu1\n Keywords\nineffective teachers, salient characteristics, secondary schools, Kenya\n2 SAGE Open\nThere is evidence in the literature that governmental and\nnongovernmental organizations all over the world are grop-\ning for solutions to ineffective teaching. For example, the\nU.S. government is hoping to solve the problem by identify-\ning ineffective teachers for assessment, assistance, and sup-\nport, and then dismissing them if they do not improve (Jerald,\n2009). However, research shows that it is difficult to accu-\nrately identify ineffective teachers, that teachers are rarely\ndismissed from employment for ineffective teaching, and\nthat dismissal of ineffective teachers as a means of improv-\ning students' academic performance has received least atten-\ntion and mixed reactions. Teacher unions in particular are\nagainst dismissal of ineffective teachers because they believe\nthat poor academic performance among students is a com-\nplex problem that cannot be attributed to ineffective teaching\nonly. They also argue that there are no proper measures in\nplace to identify ineffective teachers (Coggshall, 2009).\nThe proper documentation of the characteristics of inef-\nfective teachers is a significant step toward identification of\nteachers who possess the characteristics so that they can be\nassisted to improve or advised to discontinue discharging\ntheir teaching duties. The identification of ineffective teach-\ners is a worthwhile exercise because poor academic perfor-\nmance is common among secondary school students in many\ncountries including Kenya. For instance, in the year 2010, a\nSecondary Education (KCSE) examination. A small number\nobtained grade C+ and above, and therefore qualified to pursue\nuniversity education. A large number of the candidates--\nand did not meet the minimum university entry requirement\n(Siringi, 2011). There is no doubt that ineffective teaching is\none of the key factors contributing to this poor academic per-\nformance among secondary school students in Kenya.\nOne of the things educators know for sure about educa-\ntion is that there is nothing anyone can do to improve student\nachievement that is as important as providing effective\nteachers (Chance, 2008). They also agree that every student\nhas a right to highly effective teachers and there is no justifi-\ncation whatsoever for retaining ineffective teachers in\nschools who are doing more harm than good to innocent stu-\ndents (Acikgoz, 2005). The qualities of effective teachers\nhave been investigated by several scholars and are fairly well\nknown. For instance, Stronge, Tucker, and Hindman (2004)\nreported that effective teachers are knowledgeable in their\nsubjects, caring toward their students, fair and respectful to\nstudents; have positive attitudes toward teaching as a profes-\nsion; are sociable in class; and are motivating to learners.\nOkpala and Ellis (2005) reported that effective teachers are\ncaring, encouraging, approachable, enthusiastic, respectful,\nknowledgeable, empathetic, passionate, and having a sense\nof humor. Walls et al. (2002) conducted a qualitative study in\nwhich they examined the qualities of effective teachers and\nthe characteristics of ineffective teachers. Their findings on\nthe qualities of effective teachers agree with those reported\nby Okpala and Ellis, and by Stronge et al. They reported that\nthere are five characteristics of ineffective teachers, which\nare as follows: partial in treating students, disorganized, less\nresourceful, discourage students from asking questions, and\nauthoritarian in class.\nThe researchers of this study felt that the five characteris-\ntics of ineffective teachers as reported by Walls et al. (2002)\nand the four characteristics of ineffective teachers (yelling at\nstudents, giving empty threats, failing to give prompt feed-\nback, and giving too much work to students) reported by\nHorton (2009) were not exhaustive perhaps because they\ninvolved university students as the participants in their stud-\nies. The purpose of this study therefore was to reexamine the\ncharacteristics of ineffective teachers at the secondary school\nlevel of education. The study sought to identify all aspects of\nineffective teaching that persist in individuals even after they\nhave been trained and qualified as teachers. The ineffective\nteachers whose characteristics were described by the partici-\npants in this study were all trained and qualified as second-\nary school teachers in Kenya.\nObjective of the Study\nThe single objective of this study was to identify the salient\ncharacteristics of trained ineffective secondary school teach-\ners in Kenya. From this objective, one research question was\nposed and answered:\nResearch Question: What do secondary school stu-\ndents believe are the salient characteristics of\ntrained ineffective teachers?\nThis question was answered by investigating the per-\nception of secondary school students on the characteristics\nof their ineffective (worst) teachers. The method used in\nthis study is explained in the following section.\nMethod\nA qualitative research method was used in this study because\nit was most appropriate in the generation of rich narrative\ndata from students on the characteristics of trained ineffec-\ntive teachers in secondary schools in Kenya. This method\ninvolved collection and analysis of nonquantitative data.\nQualitative data collection methods often include open-ended\ninterviews, direct observations, focus group discussions, and\nwritten documents such as open-ended questionnaires\n(Bowen, 2005). In our study, the participants wrote their\ndescriptions of the characteristics of ineffective teachers on\nblank sheets of paper that were provided. The data-gathering\nmethod was chosen to be a written document because open-\nended, face-to-face interviews carry the potential of the\nparticipants feeling pressured, intimidated, or in some way\nstressed due to the presence of the interviewer (Jahangiri &\nKodero et al. 3\nMucciolo, 2008). The participants of this study were adoles-\ncent secondary school students who could have been intimi-\ndated if they were asked by an interviewer to identify a worst\nteacher and verbally describe his or her characteristics.\nMoreover, this study was conducted during school hours\nwhen involving students in time-consuming open-ended\ninterviews was considered prohibitive by the researchers.\nWithin the qualitative research method, the study adopted\nphenomenological design because the researchers were\ninterested in the perceptions of participants to understand inef-\nfective teaching as a phenomenon. According to Brumfield\n(2006), perceptions of individuals on a phenomenon can be\nbest investigated through phenomenological studies. Miller\nand Salkind (2002) described phenomenology as a method\nthat seeks to describe the experiences of individuals who are\nintimately involved or confronted with a concept or a phe-\nnomenon. The participants of this study were secondary\nschool students who were intimately involved with ineffec-\ntive teachers in class. The students have had firsthand experi-\nences with ineffective teachers, and they could vividly describe\nthe conduct of these teachers. They were therefore chosen for\nparticipation in this study because they were in the best posi-\ntion to describe the characteristics of these teachers. In short,\nthe design enabled the researchers to capture how secondary\nschool students perceive, describe, and judge ineffective\nteaching in their classrooms.\nPopulation and Setting\nThe research population comprised Form 3 secondary school\nstudents drawn from four provinces (Nyanza, Western, Rift\nValley, and Nairobi) out of the eight provinces in Kenya.\nNyanza, Western, and Rift Valley are provinces in the west-\nern part of Kenya, whereas Nairobi, which is the capital city,\nis a cosmopolitan province in the central part of the country.\nThe dominant ethnic group living in Nyanza is Luo, in Rift\nValley is Kalenjin, in Western province is Luhya, and the\nmost populous ethnic group in Nairobi is Kikuyu. Participants\nfrom different ethnic backgrounds were considered suitable\nin this study because research has shown that ethnicity influ-\nences people's perception (Merchant & Dupuy, 1996). The\nresearchers believed that ineffective teaching as a phenom-\nenon could be perceived differently by participants from\ndifferent provinces in the country. Thus, conducting this\nstudy in many provinces enabled the researchers to accu-\nrately capture the perceptions of secondary school students\non the characteristics of ineffective teachers in Kenya.\nForm 3 students were considered suitable for this study\nbecause they had been in secondary school for 3 years and\nhad therefore interacted with ineffective teachers for a long\ntime. Their inclusion based on length of stay in school was\nsupported by Patton's (2002) report that a phenomenologi-\ncal research is to address issues that pertain to experience\nwhereby responses are obtained from participants who have\nlived through the particular experience for a long time. Form\n3 students have longtime experience with ineffective teach-\ners and therefore were believed to have a better grasp of the\ncharacteristics of these teachers. Thus, they were involved in\nthis study because of their expertise regarding their own\nexperiences on ineffective teaching. Forms 1 and 2 students\nwere not involved in this study because they had learned in\nsecondary schools for a short time and were considered\nunsuitable to provide well-informed descriptions of the char-\nacteristics of ineffective secondary school teachers. Form 4\nstudents who had stayed longest in secondary schools were\nalso not involved in the study because they were busy pre-\nparing for their final-national secondary school examination\n(KCSE) at the time of data collection.\nSample\nThe participants of this study were 80 adolescents within the\nmended that a phenomenological study should have between\n5 and 25 participants, this study involved a large sample size\nof 80 participants (20 from each of the four provinces)\nbecause Kenya is a multiethnic society and ethnicity is known\nto influence people's perception. The participants (40 males\nand 40 females) were selected from eight provincial second-\nary schools (four boys' and four girls' schools) using crite-\nrion sampling technique.According to Green and Christensen\n(2006), criterion is the most appropriate sampling technique\nto use in a phenomenological research because it ensures\nthat all participants are purposefully selected based on the\nfact that they have experienced a similar phenomenon, in\nthis case, ineffective teaching in schools. Provincial sec-\nondary schools were involved in the study because they are\nwell-established government schools and all teachers in\nthese schools are trained and qualified. The researchers\nwanted to find out the characteristics of trained ineffective\nteachers in secondary schools in Kenya.\nInstrumentation and Procedures\nTwo research instruments were used in data collection: a\nbiographical form and a blank sheet of paper. A biographi-\ncal form developed by the researchers was used to collect\ndata on the participants' profiles. On this form, the partici-\npants were asked to indicate their unique characteristics\nsuch as age, gender, class, ethnic background, geographi-\ncal location (province), whether they volunteered to par-\nticipate in the study, and whether they knew an ineffective\nteacher in their class/school whose characteristics they\nwere willing to describe. They were also asked to state on\nthis form that the teacher they described was trained and\nqualified, and to indicate the duration they have known the\nineffective teacher.\nThe other instrument used in data collection was a blank\nsheet of paper on which the participants were individually\ninstructed to identify the most ineffective (worst) teacher who\n4 SAGE Open\nwas teaching their class and to describe the characteristics of\nthat teacher on the paper. The instructions were typed at the\ntop of the blank sheets of paper issued to the participants. The\nparticipants were also instructed orally and on the informed\nconsent letter not to write the name of the teacher they were\ndescribing, and not to write their own names and admission\nnumbers on the paper. This step was taken to ensure that the\nparticipants were protected and that they remained anony-\nmous throughout the duration of the study.\nPermission to conduct this study was obtained from the\nMinistry of Education and from the head teachers of the\nschools involved. The research instruments were adminis-\ntered to the participants by the researchers. The participants\nwere given 1 hr to complete the biographical form and to\ndescribe the characteristics of their ineffective teachers on the\npapers provided. They were instructed not to discuss their\nexperiences during this period because the researchers were\ninterested in tapping their own unique experiences. All par-\nticipants were proficient in English. At the end of the data\ncollection exercise, the papers were serially coded from 1 to\n80 for ease of reference and for data analysis purposes.\nEthical Considerations\nThe researchers explained the objectives of the study to head\nteachers, class teachers, and to the participants involved\nin the study. The participants were requested to read and sign\nthe informed consent letter before participating in the study.\nThey were informed that there were no physical or psycho-\nlogical risks involved and that their participation in this study\nwas voluntary. The respondents had the freedom to decline\nor withdraw from it at any time they deemed fit. They were\nalso assured of the anonymity and confidentiality of their\nresponses and that they were not required to write their\nnames on any of the research instruments used in the data\ncollection. Finally, they were instructed not to write, any-\nwhere, the names of the ineffective teachers whose charac-\nteristics they described.\nData Analysis and Interpretation\nContent analysis method was used in analyzing the written\ndata on sheets of paper collected from the participants. Content\nanalysis is a careful, detailed, systematic examination and\ninterpretation particularly of written documents in an effort\nto identify patterns, themes, and meanings (Berg, 2009).\nAccording to Leedy and Ormrod (2005), content analysis\nprovides a method of obtaining good access to the words of\nparticipants in text or written documents. This method was\nappropriate for this study because it enabled the researchers\nto analyze, synthesize, and interpret the words written by the\nparticipants about the characteristics of trained ineffective\nteachers in secondary schools. Under this method, the\nresearchers undertook gist and verbatim analyses. According\nto Yin (2011), gist analysis should be undertaken in qualita-\ntive research to capture the meaning of the statements made\nby the participants about the phenomenon under investiga-\ntion, whereas verbatim analysis is done to report the direct\nquotations from the statements made by participants to cap-\nture their feelings about the phenomenon. Through gist\nanalysis, the researchers identified and named the character-\nistics of ineffective teachers, and through verbatim analysis,\nthey reported the strong feelings the participants had about\nineffective teaching in schools.\nThe data analysis process started with participants' hand-\nwritten responses on the blank sheets of paper that were coded\nfrom 1 to 80, photocopied for each of the three researchers\ninvolved in data analysis to receive a copy. Each paper was\nindependently analyzed by the researchers after thorough\ndiscussion and agreement on the procedures and rules to fol-\nlow. It was agreed that the data analysis would begin with an\nexploration of the descriptions made on papers by the par-\nticipants on the characteristics of ineffective teachers. This\nexploration was an attempt to grasp participants'expressions\nand meanings in the broadest context (Reisetter et al., 2004).\nEach paper was then read a number of times to identify the\nsignificant statements as verb-referent phrases on the charac-\nteristics of ineffective teachers. The significant statements\nmade by the participants were annotated on the right-hand\nmargin of the paper (e.g., late to class, rigid in class, boring\nin class, rude to students).\nThe researchers then identified and eliminated the over-\nlapping or redundant significant statements as they read\nthe participants' descriptions. The nonredundant significant\nstatements were written on sheets of paper and were counted.\nThe order of the statements provided was based on the serial\ncoding of the papers on which the descriptions were made by\ntheparticipants.ThestatementsthatemergedfromParticipant\nSerial Number 1 came first and those that emerged from\nParticipant Serial Number 80 came last on the list. In total,\nof the three researchers.\nIn the next stage of data analysis, the researchers indi-\nvidually and critically examined the significant statements in\nsearch of the connections among them. In this examination,\nthe meaning and not the frequency of the statements was\ncentral to the researchers. The statements that were related or\nhad connections with others were grouped together into\n\"meaning units,\" which were extracted into meaningful ana-\nlyzable units called emergent themes (Smith & Osborn,\n2008). This was an analytical and theoretical process that led\nto clustering of the statements. Some of the statements clus-\ntered together and some did not. The statements that did not\nconnect with others were considered here as solitary themes.\nThe numbers of emergent themes that were generated from\nthe data analyses done independently by the three research-\nKodero et al. 5\nIn the final stage of the analysis, the researchers worked\ntogether to negotiate and compare their emergent themes.\nThe process involved one of the researchers selecting an\nemergent theme considered to be representative of ineffec-\ntive teacher characteristic (e.g., wastage of students' time,\npoor mastery of the subject taught, immoral in behavior) and\nasking whether the other researchers had a similar emergent\ntheme. When all researchers agreed that the emergent theme\nand the significant statements under it were correct, the theme\nwas noted down and the researchers moved to the next emer-\ngent theme. This process continued until all researchers had\nexhausted all of their emergent themes. Disagreement among\nthe researchers occurred on three themes. These themes were\nas follows: (a) \"nondialogical in class\"--one researcher\nrecorded this theme as \"nonparticipatory in class,\" (b) \"injuri-\nous to students in class\"--one researcher noted it as \"punitive\nto students in class,\" and (c) \"poor psychological health\"--\none researcher referred to this theme as \"having mood dis-\norder.\" These differences were resolved through discussion\nand agreement on the title of the emergent theme. Overall, all\nthe three researchers agreed on 96% of the emergent themes,\nan indicator that the interrater reliability was higher than .90.\nResults\nAt the end of the discussion and negotiation among the three\nresearchers, 20 emergent and 4 solitary themes were agreed\non. This large number of emergent themes that resulted from\nthe data analyses reflects the richness of the descriptions the\nparticipants had about the characteristics of ineffective teach-\ners in secondary schools in Kenya. The emergent themes\ncaptured what the participants collectively perceived as the\ncharacteristics of trained ineffective teachers. The 20 emergent\nthemes were named and accepted by the researchers as accu-\nrate reflection of the characteristics of ineffective teachers in\nKenya. However, the 4 solitary themes retained their initial\nnames and were treated as isolated cases atypical of the char-\nacteristics of ineffective teachers. They were discarded and\nnot included among the characteristics of ineffective teachers.\nThe 20 emergent themes, which were regarded in this study as\nthe characteristics of ineffective teachers, and the 4 solitary\nthemes, which were discarded, are presented in Table 1.\nUnder each emergent theme, the significant statements are\nreported to clearly show how the 20 characteristics of ineffec-\ntive teachers were arrived at by the researchers of this study.\nThe result of verbatim analysis is reported here in the\nform of excerpts of the descriptions made by the participants\nabout their ineffective teachers. They are reported as direct\nquotations, which capture vividly the strong feelings of the\nstudents about their ineffective teachers. In other words, they\ntap the \"voices\" of the participants involved in the study. The\nexcerpts are reported under the 20 characteristics of ineffec-\ntive teachers identified in this study:\nTable 1. Emergent and Solitary Themes\nEmergent themes\n1.

(continued)\nWastage of Students'Time\nTime wastage featured prominently as one of the character-\nistics of ineffective teachers. For instance, Participant Serial\nNumber 1 wrote that\nMy worst teacher comes to class very late without any\nparticular reason. She lies to us whenever we ask her\nwhy she came late to class.\nParticipant Serial Number 3 wrote that\nMy ineffective teacher is one who never keeps time--\ncomes to class late and is too lazy to teach for\n40 minutes as provided for in the school timetable.\nThe teacher leaves class before the bell which marks\nthe end of the lesson is rang.\nPoor Mastery of the Subject\nA large number of participants felt that ineffective teachers\nare poor in the subjects they teach. For example, Participant\nSerial Number 11 wrote that\nMy worst teacher does not know the subject he is\nteaching us and he is not ready to answer any ques-\ntions from students. When a student asks him a ques-\ntion he gets annoyed and refuses to answer the\nquestion because he does not know the answer.\nParticipant Serial Number 76 wrote,\nMy ineffective teacher comes to class only to intro-\nduce a new topic and teaches nothing about that topic.\nHe tells students to make notes on what they do not\nKodero et al. 7\nunderstand. I always feel like walking out of class\nwhen he comes to class because I don't gain anything\nfrom him.\nSource of Boredom to Students\nThe participants were unanimous that ineffective teachers\nwere boring in class. For instance, Participant Serial Number\nMy biology teacher is so boring that I have developed\na bad attitude towards the subject. My request to God\nis that she will change before I get to Form 4 so that\nI will not fail in this subject in my KCSE exam. The\nteacher cannot even make a silly joke to enable me be\nattentive and alert. To me she looks as if she just died\nand came back to life.\nParticipant Serial Number 36 wrote,\nMy worst teacher is boring and not lively in class. The\nteacher will not care about how much you score in his\nsubject. When you fail he will tell you \"you are not fit\nfor this subject and I think you are in the wrong place\".\nI always feel pissed off when he is in class.\nPartial inTreating Students\nThe participants in this study identified discrimination\nagainst students based on their ethnicity, ability, or gender as\none of the characteristics of ineffective teachers. For\ninstance, Participant Serial Number 19 wrote,\nMy worst teacher is the one who is tribalistic and\nalways praises students from his own tribe and con-\ndemns students from other tribes for no good reason at\nall. He also favours brilliant students hence demoral-\nizes the weak students.\nParticipant Serial Number 45 wrote,\nMy worst teacher is my biology teacher. She has taught\nus since Form 1. She has a bad attitude towards those\nwho don't pass exams in biology and those who are\nslow learners. I think she was never meant to be a\nteacher because teachers are trained to understand their\nstudents. She has a bad heart, she cannot spare her time\nto assist us in difficulty.\nLack of Respect for Students\nThe participants perceived respect for students as an integral\npart of teaching, and they believed that teachers who under-\nrate their students were ineffective. For instance, Participant\nSerial Number 71 wrote,\nMy bad teacher always abuses students in class. He\nonce told me to \"scan my brain\" because I did not\nanswer a question correctly. This actually makes a\nstudent develop hatred towards the teacher until he\ncannot understand what the teacher is teaching.\nParticipant Serial Number 64 wrote,\nMy worst teacher does not respect students and to him\nstudents are nothing but fools who are struggling to\nlearn his subject.\nLow Level of Self-Confidence\nA number of participants perceived self-confidence as impor-\ntant in teaching, and those who lacked it were seen as inef-\nfective. For instance, Participant Serial Number 51 wrote that\nMy worst teacher has low self-confidence e.g. if you\nlaugh in class he thinks that you are laughing at him.\nHe does not like jokes and he is always stone faced.\nParticipant Serial Number 4 wrote that\nMy ineffective teacher is not confident in class. He\nlacks a defined plan for the lesson and he is aloof and\ndoes not mingle with students. His subject is the worst\nperformed in the entire school.\nPoor Mastery ofTeaching Skills\nSome participants view ineffective teachers as those who\nlacked teaching skills. For example, Participant Serial Number\nMy ineffective teacher has inadequate teaching skills,\nas such might have graduated not long ago and is still\nin the process of learning how to teach.\nParticipant Serial Number 58 wrote,\nMy worst teacher appears to know the subject, but\ndoes not know how to teach it. He looks at the chalk-\nboard instead of looking at the students when he is\nteaching.\nEmotional Immaturity\nTeachers perceived as emotionally immature were described as\nineffective. For instance, Participant Serial Number 24 wrote,\nMy worst teacher behaves like a child, she cries in\nclass when disturbed by students. In fact, some stu-\ndents laugh at her when she is crying which makes her\nto cry more.\n8 SAGE Open\nParticipant Serial Number 58 wrote,\nMy worst teacher is short tempered and gets annoyed\ndue to small mistakes made by students in class. She\nis actually temperamental and abusive in class.\nInappropriate Dressing in Class\nThe participants considered dressing as an important attri-\nbute in their male and female teachers. For example,\nParticipant Serial Number 49 wrote,\nMy worst teacher comes to school dressed in a manner\nlikely to suggest otherwise. She leaves her cleavage\nopen which is provocative and she wears clothes that\n\"start too late and end too early\".\nParticipant Serial Number 63 wrote,\nMy ineffective teacher is dressed as if his salary is\npaid to somebody else. When he is in class you imag-\nine that you are being taught by an insane person\ndressed in rugs or by an old dirty man in the village.\nInjurious to Students in Class\nThe teachers who caused physical injury to students were\nseen as ineffective in their duty. For example, Participant\nSerial Number 51 wrote that\nMy worst teacher canes students in class for no good\nreason at all. He does not take time to advice students.\nThis has created a tense atmosphere in class and stu-\ndents find it hard to concentrate during his lessons.\nParticipant Serial Number 75 wrote in small and capital\nletters that\nMy worst teacher punishes me by caning me whenever\nI fail his exam. I hate the teacher because punishment\nFond of FrivolousTalk in Class\nThe participants of this study perceive teachers who engage\nthem in chit chat in class as ineffective. For instance,\nParticipant Serial Number 5 wrote,\nMy worst teacher wastes a lot of time talking about\nirrelevant things in class e.g. her house, husband, chil-\ndren and the number of cars she owns.\nParticipant Serial Number 41 wrote,\nMy worst teacher comes to class only to back bite\nstudents and staff. Sometimes I just feel like telling\nhim to stop because it is a waste of our learning time.\nMiscommunicate in Class\nTeaching requires good communication, and teachers who\nare poor in it were regarded as ineffective. For example,\nParticipant Serial Number 55 observed that\nMy bad teacher is keen on completing the syllabus and\nnot on teaching us to understand the subject. This atti-\ntude makes the teacher to rush and hence we do not\nunderstand what is being taught.\nParticipant Serial Number 44 wrote,\nMy worst teachers just enters the class, greets students\nwith a serious face and starts giving his lectures as if\nthe students are in a university.\nPoor in Providing Feedback\nStudents wanted to know their performance in the subjects\nthey learned and so perceived a teacher who did not give\nthem feedback as ineffective. For example, Participant Serial\nMy worst teacher gives assignments but does not\nmark them. He is also very poor in marking stu-\ndents' exams. When a question requires three points,\nif the first response is wrong, he marks all of them\nwrong.\nParticipant Serial Number 52 wrote,\nMy ineffective teacher does not give exercises to stu-\ndents in order to know whether or not the students are\nfollowing what she is teaching. I feel she hates to mark\nstudents' work.\nNondialogical in Class\nA number of participants perceived teachers who did not\nencourage dialogue in class as ineffective. For example,\nParticipant Serial Number 36 wrote,\nMy worst teacher does not ask questions about what\nshe has taught. She also does not answer any question\nposed by students in class. At the end of her lesson we\nlearn nothing because she lectures us as if we were\nuniversity students.\nParticipant Serial Number 47 wrote,\nKodero et al. 9\nMy English teacher is ineffective. She does not teach\nand the only thing she does is to tell us to turn to a\ncertain page and answer the questions or to do the\nexercise in that page.\nPoor in Maintaining Discipline\nInability to maintain discipline in classroom was perceived\nby the participants as a sign of ineffectiveness in teachers.\nFor example, Participant Serial Number 77 wrote,\nMy ineffective teacher is not in control of the class,\nstudents have no respect for him and they can do any-\nthing they want when he is class.\nParticipant Serial Number 64 wrote,\nMy worst teacher is quite traditional, he does not\nunderstand the \"Dot.com age\". He denies the boys\nopportunities to entertain themselves and to play foot-\nball which is important for their physical health and\ndevelopment.\nImmoral in Behavior\nThe participants involved in this study perceived teachers\nwho displayed immoral behavior as ineffective. For exam-\nple, Participant Serial Number 72 wrote,\nMy ineffective teacher brings boyfriends to students in\nschool, so that they talk to the girls and the teacher\nhimself grooves with the girls up to the extent of hav-\ning sex with them. And when you refuse to be his\nfriend, you will be abused for the rest of your life in\nschool.\nParticipant Serial Number 65 wrote,\nMy ineffective teacher is a perpetual drunkard and\nthere is no single time you would find him sober. After\ndrinking he spends most of his time chasing students\nand giving them heavy punishment. He also fights stu-\ndents like his own age mates.\nUnapproachable to Students\nParticipants perceived teachers who were unapproachable as\nineffective. For example, Participant Serial Number 75\nwrote,\nMy worst teacher is always in bad mood and not will-\ning to talk to students inside and outside class. This\nmakes students to fear answering his questions or ask-\ning him questions.\nParticipant Serial Number 49 wrote,\nMy worst teacher does not socialize with students and\ntherefore you can't consult him on any issue. I remem-\nber one day I went to consult him about what he had\ntaught and he furiously told me to walk out of his\noffice.\nPoor in Guidance and Counseling\nCounseling was perceived as being central to the teaching\nprofession, and the teachers who did not offer it to students\nwere considered ineffective. For instance, Participant Serial\nMy worst teacher keeps on talking to other teachers\nand workers about my weaknesses instead of helping\nme to overcome the weaknesses.\nParticipant Serial Number 71 wrote,\nMy worst teacher only thinks of academic work. He\ndoes not take his time to address emerging issues such\nas HIV/AIDS and drug abuse. This makes his lessons\nboring and monotonous.\nPoor Psychological Health\nThe participants were concerned about the psychological\nhealth of their teachers, and they described ineffective teach-\ners as having mood disorders. For instance, Participant\nSerial Number 80 wrote,\nMy worst class teacher is always moody and unpre-\ndictable and one cannot know the right time to\napproach her to solve a problem.\nParticipant Serial Number 54 wrote,\nMy worst teacher is a lady who is boastful and she\nlikes showing off to students and staff. I am telling\nyou she makes me sick and mad when I see her in\nschool.\nAutocratic to Students in Class\nThe participants perceived teachers who are dictatorial and\ndomineering as ineffective in their work. Participant Serial\nWe have a certain teacher in this school who is dis-\nliked by three quarters of the students. This teacher is\na dictator and uses modes of dictatorship which are not\nused even by the government nowadays.\nParticipant Serial Number 59 wrote,\nMy worst teacher is harsh and dictatorial in class. She\nlikes to punish students by ordering them to get out of\nthe class. I really hate this teacher and wished she was\nnever my teacher.\nDiscussion\nThe single objective of this study was to identify the charac-\nteristics of ineffective trained teachers in secondary schools\nin Kenya. This objective was achieved through gist analysis\nin which 20 characteristics of ineffective teachers were iden-\ntified and named. Moreover, this study captured through\nverbatim analysis the strong feelings the participants had\nabout each characteristic of ineffective teachers. But, it is\nimportant to note here that no single participant involved in\nthis study produced a rich description that contained all\nthese 20 characteristics of ineffective teachers. This was\ninterpreted by the researchers to mean that no single ineffec-\ntive teacher possessed all these characteristics. Indeed, an\nineffective teacher must have some but not all of these char-\nacteristics. The study did not investigate the average number\nof these characteristics a teacher needs to have to be per-\nceived as ineffective; this could be an objective for another\nstudy. Also, this study did not investigate whether the inef-\nfective teachers described by the participants may have been\neffective in the past and lost their motivation to teach, or\nwhether they may have always lacked the skills needed to be\neffective.\nThis study has provided perhaps one of the most compre-\nhensive descriptions of characteristics of ineffective teachers\nin secondary schools. Other studies found in the literature\nreviewed have reported fewer characteristics of ineffective\nteachers. For instance, a study by Walls et al. (2002) gener-\nated only five characteristics of ineffective teachers, which\nwere as follows: partial in treating students, disorganized,\nless resourceful, discourage students from asking questions,\nand authoritarian in class. Four of these characteristics match\nthe ones we identified in our study. The only characteristic\nthat they reported and does not directly correspond to the\nones we identified is \"disorganized.\" Perhaps it does not\nmatch the characteristics we reported because it is not spe-\ncific in meaning; for instance, a teacher who wastes time or\nhas poor psychological health may be described by students\nas disorganized.\nIn another study, Horton (2009) identified 4 characteristics\nthat make a teacher ineffective, which are as follows: yelling\nat students, giving empty threats, failing to give prompt feed-\nback, and giving too much work to students. Again, all these\ncharacteristics reported by Horton are captured in the find-\nings of our study except the last one. The participants involved\nin our study did not report \"giving too much work to stu-\ndents\" as a characteristic of ineffective teachers. It appeared\nthat they did not mind being given a lot of work, but they did\nmind not being given feedback by teachers on the assign-\nments they have done. One of the most comprehensive listing\nof the characteristics of ineffective teachers was made by\nMagar (2009). According to Magar, ineffective teachers have\n9 characteristics, which were as follows: no smart goals, no\nself-control, motivated by their own desires, do not realize that\nthey are boring, lack self-discipline, bribe students, threaten\nstudents, are empty shells, and do not know how to please stu-\ndents.Acritical examination of this list reveals that only one of\nthe characteristics mentioned does not correspond at all to any\nof the 20 characteristics of ineffective teachers we reported in\nour study. The characteristic is \"bribe students.\" Perhaps it did\nnot feature in our study because bribery is so common in the\nKenyan society that the participants failed to perceive it as\none of the characteristics of ineffective teachers.\nThe literature reviewed indicated that most studies have\nbeen conducted on the qualities of effective teachers and that\nvery few studies have been done on the characteristics of\nineffective teachers. The assumption behind this disparity in\nresearch is that some researchers believe that by knowing the\nqualities of effective teachers the characteristics of ineffec-\ntive teachers will be implicit (Marsh, 1991). According to\nMarsh (1991) this assumption is not right because the char-\nacteristics of ineffective teachers can only be best understood\nby studying the teachers who possess them. In fact, the find-\nings of our study support Marsh's position. For example, a\nstudy by Haydn (2007) investigated the views of secondary\nschool pupils on the qualities of effective teachers. He\nreported the following eight qualities: talks to students nor-\nmally, knows the subject well, explains things well, makes\nthe subject interesting, good at stopping other pupils from\nspoiling the lesson, friendly, enthusiastic about their subject,\nand has a sense of humor. Attempt to make these statements\nnegative and use them to describe ineffective teachers may\nbe problematic. For instance, converting \"talks to students\nnormally\" to \"talks to students abnormally\" does not make\nsemantic sense. Moreover, a participant in our study reported\nthat one characteristic of an ineffective teacher is \"chewing\ngum in class.\" If our study had investigated the qualities of\neffective teachers to understand the characteristics of inef-\nfective teachers, it is unlikely that this participant or another\nparticipant would have reported that one quality of an effec-\ntive teacher is \"does not chew gum in class.\"\nA scrutiny of the 20 characteristics of ineffective teach-\ners identified in our study shows that some of these charac-\nteristics can be eliminated administratively in schools, for\ninstance, wastage of students' time, injurious to students, and\nwearing inappropriate dress in class. The school administra-\ntion can ensure that teachers do not report to class late, leave\nclass early, or miss class without permission. Wastage of time\nis common in schools where there is laxity in administration\nand there is no vigilance on the conduct of teachers. In Kenya,\ncorporal punishment is outlawed, and no class teacher is\nallowed to cane or kick a student in school. It is the respon-\nsibility of the school administration to ensure that any teacher\nwho causes physical injury to students is dealt with accord-\ning to the law. It is also the duty of the school administration\nto ensure that teachers do not go to class poorly dressed.\nA teacher who is not well dressed should be advised by the\nschool administration to mind his or her dressing.\nFinally, the findings of our study challenge the assump-\ntion that qualified teachers are quality teachers (Rice, 2010).\nAll teachers whose characteristics were described by partici-\npants involved in this study were trained and qualified, yet,\nnumerous characteristics of ineffective teaching were identi-\nfied, and excerpts reported strong feelings the participants\nhad about ineffective teaching in schools. This assumption\nshould be put aside, and concerted effort should be made to\nidentify and help ineffective teachers improve their perfor-\nmance. The authors of this article are not aware of any\neffort made by stakeholders in education in Kenya to iden-\ntify these teachers.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study and other studies indicate that\nthere are very many characteristics of ineffective teaching\nthat remain in some individuals after they have been trained\nand qualified as teachers. There is no doubt that training\nimproves effectiveness in teaching, but it does not necessar-\nily eliminate all characteristics of ineffective teachers in\nsecondary schools. There is therefore a need for trained sec-\nondary school teachers to undergo regular observations and\nparticipate in regular in-service training. These should be\norganized by the stakeholders in education as part of continu-\ning professional development aimed at enhancing teaching\neffectiveness. The 20 characteristics of ineffective teachers\nreported in this study may be used to develop an assessment\ninstrument that can help identify ineffective teachers in sec-\nondary schools. Finally, some of the characteristics of inef-\nfective teachers identified in our study can be addressed and\neliminated by the school administration by being vigilant of\nthe conduct of teachers in secondary schools.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAcikgoz, F.
