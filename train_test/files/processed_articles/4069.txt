It opened in November 2005 and will\ncirculate to a number of museums before terminating at the London Natural History\nMuseum in February 2009. The Exhibition is also a major contributor to online instruction\nabout evolution for schools. The quality of the Exhibition's narrative is accordingly of\nsome significance. This paper argues that the narrative is the legendary history that\ndominates public opinion. The legend has been thoroughly disassembled by historical\nresearch over recent decades. My criticism is organized as six theses. (1) Publication of the\nOrigin was not a sudden (\"revolutionary\") interruption of Victorian society's confident\nbelief in the traditional theological world-view. (2) The Origin did not \"revolutionize\" the\nbiological sciences by removing the creationist premise or introducing new principles. (3)\nThe Origin did not revolutionize Victorian public opinion. The public considered Darwin\nand Spencer to be teaching the same lesson, known today as \"Social Darwinism\", which,\nthough fashionable, never achieved dominance. (4) Many biologists expressed significant\ndisagreements with Darwin's principles. (5) Darwin made little or no contribution to the\nrenovation of theology. His public statements on Providence were inconsistent and the\nliberal reform of theology was well advanced by 1850. (6) The so-called \"Darwinian\nrevolution\" was, at the public opinion level, the fashion of laissez-faire economic beliefs\nbacked by Darwin and Spencer's inclusion of the living world in the economic paradigm.\n",

It \"explores the extraordinary life and\ndiscoveries of Charles Darwin\", the public is told, \"whose striking insights in the 19th\ncentury forever changed the perception of the origin of our own species as well as the\nmyriad other species on this planet and launched modern biological science. Visitors of all\nages will experience the wonders Darwin witnessed on his journey as a curious and\nadventurous young man aboard the HMS Beagle on its historic five-year voyage (1831\u00ad\n1836) to the Galapagos Islands and beyond\" (www.amnh.org.exhibitions/darwin).\nThe Exhibition opened in November 2005. It will tour major museums in the\nUnited States and Canada before coming to rest in the Natural History Museum, London,\nGetting Our History Right: Six Errors about Darwin and His Influence\nwhere the official ceremonies will be held. This itinerary reflects the linkage of the\nExhibition with key science organizations (the American Association for the Advancement\nof Science, the National Science Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences, the Royal\nSociety), as well as with other major natural history museums, particularly the Museum of\nPaleontology, University of California, Berkeley. The Exhibition is also the gate to\nextensive online teaching materials covering biology instruction for all school grades,\navailable at the AMNH and UCMP web sites:\n(www.amnh.org/education/resources/exhibitions/darwin/index.php;\nhttp://copusproject.org;www.paleoportal.org/;\nhttp://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evohome.html). The Exhibition's Curator, Niles\nEldredge, states that the Exhibition is especially directed to school children, to provide\nthem evidence of evolution. My visit convinced me that the Exhibition's team has made\nthe complex story tangible by fusing it with the life of the great naturalist. We see the hero\non his celebrated voyage, and through his life at Downe, including a reproduction of the\nstudy in which he wrote the Origin. The gift shop offers many mementoes, from finger\npuppets of the man to a costly reproduction of the Beagle. The Founding Father comes\nalive. Might this have something to do with our contest with creationists? It does, as we\nshall see.\nGiven the Exhibition's top position in the science hierarchy, one would expect\nglowing reviews. Representative is biologist Robert Dorit's comment in the American\nScientist Online: \"His genius lay not, as heroic reconstruction would have it, in his ability\nto observe the natural world without preconceptions. Rather, Darwin's ability to discern the\nincompatibility of existing theories of organic change with the observations he was\ncompiling led to the breakthrough. Once the new theory of organic change began to take\nshape in his mind--descent with modification through the action of natural selection--the\nnatural world became one vast testing ground. This exhibit is intellectual history at its most\nthrilling, as we witness Darwin, with his deceptively simple new theory, make a whole set\nof predictions about the living world. Equally exciting is Darwin's revisiting of well-\nestablished observations in paleontology, embryology, comparative anatomy and\nbiogeography, now seen afresh in light of his growing confidence in his theory\" (Dorit,\nMy initial encounter with the Exhibition was its website. As a historian currently\nwriting a book on evolution in the 19th century, I promptly identified the Exhibition as\nhagiography--\"intellectual history at its most thrilling\", as Dorit deftly put it. But an\nedifying story isn't necessary factually sound. The profusion of historical studies over the\npast three or four decades has added enormously to the documentation of Darwin's work,\nhis life, his cultural milieu, and the numerous evolutionists whose very existence is\nWe are well advanced toward a factually reliable picture of this decisive period of science\nhistory. My objective is to promote the dissemination those results by showing that and\nhow they are at variance with the Exhibition's tale.\nIt is an important fact that the legend was created in Darwin's lifetime by a small\ncircle of admirers, as Janet Browne and others have shown (Barton, 1998; Browne, 2002;\nGetting Our History Right: Six Errors about Darwin and His Influence\nCaudil, 1994; Moore, 1991). One of the coterie, Thomas Huxley, penned this classic\nstatement: \"[Darwin] found a great truth trodden underfoot, reviled by bigots, and ridiculed\nby all the world; he lived long enough to see it, chiefly by his own efforts, irrefragably\nestablished in science, inseparably incorporated with the common thoughts of men, and\nonly hated and feared by those who would revile, but dare not. What shall a man desire\nmore than this?\" (Huxley, 1968, p. 244). The author of this mantra was among the many\nwho did not ridicule evolution. Indeed, none of his Amalekite-smiting statements is\nfactually warranted. Another devoted admirer, George Romanes, endorsed Huxley's (and\nDarwin's) idea that prior to Darwin there was no evolutionary thought of consequence. He\ndeclared: \"It was the theory of natural selection that changed all this, and created a\nrevolution in the thought of our time, the magnitude of which in many of its far-reaching\nconsequences we are not even yet in a position to appreciate; but the action of which has\nalready wrought a transformation in general philosophy, as well as in the more special\nscience of biology, that is without parallel in the history of mankind\" (Romanes, 1892, p.\n259; italics in the original).\nHuxley and Romanes wrote these statements in their hero worship mood. They\nknew, in some part of their minds, that their statements were inconsistent with Darwin's\n"
