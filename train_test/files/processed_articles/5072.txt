    "abstract": "Abstract\nCriminal history and race have been prominent figures in the research of discrimination in the labor market. Initially there\nwas a heavy reliance on statistical analysis of employment data as an indicator of bias in employment. The use of field\nexperiments that use audits conducted by testers applying for entry-level positions has become an important resource in the\nexamination of discrimination in the labor force. The testers are matched on all characteristics, but race. In the present study,\nevidence of discrimination relied heavily on a comparison of callbacks for entry-level positions of Black male and White male\ntesters based on their race and criminal history. Testers were required to participate in debriefings and maintain a diary of\nall of their interactions during the application process. Three themes emerged from the diaries and debriefings of the testers:\n(a) the application process was influenced by a \"gatekeeper,\" (b) racism was evident, and (c) an emotional effect was noted\non both testers.\n",

Pager found a\nsignificant effect of race in the findings in Milwaukee and\nNew York. Only 14% of Blacks received callbacks compared\nwith 34% of White noncriminals (p < .01).\nVeenman (2010) encouraged the use of triangulation of\nresearch methods when examining employment discrimina-\ntion. Veenman argued that one method is not superior to the\nother. Furthermore, one compensates for the weakness of the\nother and vice versa. Veenman argued each methodology\nduring triangulation could produce different information\nregarding employment discrimination. Guion, Diehl, and\nMcDonald (2011) described triangulation as the use of mul-\ntiple sources, or locations, or researchers in the analysis pro-\ncess. In the present research, the researcher (the researcher,\nunpublished) used a field experiment with testers, a tele-\nphone survey, and the diary entries of the testers to examine\nemployment discrimination for entry-level positions in\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin. The following research examined\nthe role of gatekeepers in the application process for entry-\nlevel positions in the labor market of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nAn added feature of the present research is the testers were\nrequired to maintain a diary of their interactions with the\ngatekeepers during the application process.\nLiterature Review\nThe dramatic role of the gatekeepers has been examined at\ndifferent levels of organizations. Mitchell (2003) defined a\ngatekeeper as anyone who stands between you and the person\nwho might want to hire you. Mitchell suggested gatekeepers\ncan be receptionists, HR recruiters, and resume screeners.\n1Cardinal Stritch University, Milwaukee, WI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLenard Wells, School of Urban Affairs and Public Policy, Department of\nGatekeepers: The Milwaukee Field\nExperiment in the Employment\nApplication Process\nLenard Wells1\n Keywords\ncriminology, social sciences, criminal behavior, deviance, public safety, crime\n2 SAGE Open\nColumbaro and Monaghan (2009) conducted a literature\nreview regarding the effect of the gatekeeper perceptions of\nonline degrees and employment. They suggested that employ-\ners' gatekeepers preferred someone with a degree from a tra-\nditional learning environment. Therefore, the employers'\ngatekeepers negative perception of online degrees was a bar-\nrier to hiring.\nAccording to Hammersley and Atkinson (1995), the gate-\nkeeper plays a prominent role in the communication process\nof organizations. It was suggested that the degree of author-\nity possessed by the gatekeeper is not necessarily an accurate\nreflection of their influence on the decision-making process.\nMorrill, Buller, Buller, and Larkey (1999) suggested that\nthe individual gatekeepers in an organization can be elusive.\nMorrill et al. argued that it is frequently a challenge to iden-\ntify them. Ruth-McSwain (2011) examined the influence of\npublic relations practitioners as gatekeepers to the news in\norganizations. One of the findings included that the gate-\nkeeper influenced the decision-making process of their orga-\nnizations. Ruth-McSwain argued that the gatekeeper had a\nrole in their organization's communication with the news\nmedia and other external sources. Furthermore, the use and\ninfluence of the gatekeeper authority in filtering communica-\ntion was evident at multiple levels of an organization.\nThe growing concern regarding gatekeepers in the appli-\ncation process resulted in the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC) to implement new federal guidelines\nregarding the use of a criminal history in the early stages of\nthe employment process (Berrien, 2012). The new guidelines\nwere implemented to show disapproval of criminal histories\nbeing abused as a barrier to employment. EEOC added spe-\ncific reference to the \"Timing\" of the use of criminal history\nin the application process. EEOC suggested that the questions\nregarding criminal history should be eliminated from the\napplication form. Furthermore, the questions regarding crimi-\nnal history should be reserved until the interview process.\nOther decision makers came to similar conclusions\nregarding the potential abuse of criminal history records in\ndenying employment. Some cities, counties, and states\nenacted laws to discourage the use of criminal history checks\non applications (Oberstein & Gilbreth, 2010). Oberstein and\nGilbreth (2010) reported on the measures taken by the state\nof Massachusetts to ban criminal history inquiries on job\napplication forms. The ban does not prohibit criminal history\ninquiries later in the application process.\nBackground of the Study\nThe researcher (unpublished) used a field experiment to\nexamine the effect of a criminal history and race on employ-\nment in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin labor market. The field\nexperiments used two testers (one Black male and one White\nmale) to audit 30 employers who were randomly divided into\ntwo categories: Criminal Record (CR) and No Criminal\nRecord (NCR) job sites. The two testers were matched in all\ncharacteristics except race. Each tester was required to main-\ntain a diary of the application process experience.\nData were collected on the number of callbacks and inter-\nviews received by each tester. A telephone survey was con-\nducted to allow the employers of the audit to express their\nwillingness to hire disadvantaged workers. Similar to the\nfield experiments of Pager (2003) and Pager and Quillian\n(2005), a dramatic disparity exists between the callbacks of\nthe Black male tester and the White male tester (the\nresearcher, unpublished). The Black male tester received no\ncallbacks when applying at CR job sites. The White male\ntester received 40% of his callbacks from the CR job sites.\nMoreover, the Black male received 27% of his callbacks\nfrom NCR job sites compared with the White male's 47%.\nAccording to the researcher (unpublished), the telephone\nsurvey of the same employers indicated a willingness to hire\nboth ex-offenders regardless of their race, yet the audit\nrevealed the opposite.\nThe diary entries of the testers were subjected to com-\nparative analysis (the researcher, unpublished). Three themes\nemerged from the diary entries and debriefings: (a) the appli-\ncation process was influenced in the favor of the White male\napplicant by the \"gatekeepers,\" (b) racism was evident, and\n(c) an emotional effect was noted on both testers.\nResearch Rationale--Diary\nThe purpose of the present report is to examine the emerging\nthemes from the testers' diaries and debriefings. During the\nfield experiment, each tester maintained a diary of his inter-\nactions with the employers. The testers recorded their inter-\nactions with the employer or representative immediately\nafter leaving the premises. They recorded the day, date, time,\nand location in their diary. They also recorded their conver-\nsations with the employer or representative at each site, as\nwell as a physical description of each. Furthermore, they\nrecorded the approximate age, build, hair color, and other\ncharacteristics to assist in identifying the individuals.\nConstant comparative analysis was used to obtain data\nrelevant to the testers' interaction with the employers. Each\ntester diary entry described the overall interaction with com-\nments made by the employer or representative. The diary\nentries were read four times and the top three prominent\nsimilarities or emergent themes were recorded.\nCategories were determined from the diaries' compara-\ntive analysis. This was done in part, to review the diary\nentries for clarity and correctness. Incidents were developed\nfrom making observations of differential treatment recorded\nby the testers for the job site that was visited. This was\nrecorded for that particular site and the tester. After the com-\npletion of all 30 job sites, it was determined through the com-\nparisons if any similarities or patterns existed among the\nincidents.\nData produced by constant comparative analysis were\ninterpreted through descriptive statistics. This systematic\nmethod of constant comparative analysis was used to eval-\nuate the content of the diary entries to determine what\nSpecifically, a comparison was made of the interactions of\nthe Black and White testers who applied at the same job\nsite using the same criteria with the employer or represen-\ntative. The only significant difference between the two tes-\nters was race. The two testers did not know each other,\nnever knowingly met each other, and the job sites were\nrandomly selected.\nResearch Rationale--Debriefings\nTesters were required to call the researcher after auditing\neach job site. This allowed the researcher the opportunity\nto debrief the tester after the completion of each job site\naudit by telephone. A second debriefing occurred at the\nend of the workday for the testers. This was a daily indi-\nvidual debriefing of each tester. The debriefing consisted\nof reviewing the diary entries of the testers. During the\nreview, the testers were instructed to describe their experi-\nences at each job site. This was done as the researcher\nreviewed each of the diary entries of the testers, requested\nclarification if needed, and checked the observations\nentered in the diaries for accuracy and completeness. The\ninformation obtained during the debriefings was subjected\nto the same comparative analysis rigor as the diary entries\nDescription of Testers and Sites\nTesters were employed from the local colleges and universi-\nties in the Milwaukee area. Two testers (one White male and\none Black male) were selected. The testers were selected and\nmatched based on their age and race. They were counseled\nby a professional employment specialist regarding their\ndress, physical appearance, and communication skills that\nare appropriate for seeking employment. Also, for the pur-\npose of this study, they were assigned similar characteristics\nof education and work experience for application purposes.\nTesters were required to have their own means of transporta-\ntion. Also, they were required to apply only at those places\nassigned to them by the researcher. Furthermore, they were\nnot allowed to accept any employment from any of the\naudited employers during this research.\nThe 30 employers were selected from the city of\nMilwaukee, randomly from the Sunday classified section of\nthe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper and JobNet. The\ntesters were randomly assigned to apply for entry-level posi-\ntions at the assigned employer.\nThe testers were trained to record their interactions with\nthe employer and others during the application process. The\ntesters recorded their interactions with the employer or rep-\nresentative immediately after leaving the premises. They\nmade their diary entries prior to going to subsequent job\nsites. They recorded the day, date, time, and location in their\ndiary. They also recorded conversations with the employer or\nrepresentative at each site, as well as a physical description\nof each. Furthermore, they recorded the race, gender, the\napproximate age, build, hair color, dress, and other charac-\nteristics to assist in identifying the individuals. These proce-\ndures were part of the training that was conducted by a\nformer member of law enforcement who had experience in\ncovert operations.\nThe present study design allowed both testers the oppor-\ntunity to visit the same employer under the same circum-\nstances of having a CR or NCR. Therefore, the impact of\npersonal contact by CR and race were examined as to their\ninteractions with each employer's representative.\nSummary of Findings: Emergent\nThemes\nThe present study found that 73% of the employers studied\ninquired of the criminal history through the application. The\nmajority of the employers (57%) who asked information\nregarding a criminal history in the application offered a dis-\nclaimer. A disclaimer is described as informing the applicant\nthat a CR does not necessarily bar them from being hired.\nThe debriefings and diary entries indicated that the per-\nsonal contact had a positive impact on the White male tester.\nThe White male tester reported enjoyable experiences during\nthe application process at the CR and NCR job sites. The\nWhite male tester debriefings and diary entries indicated the\napplication process was a positive emotional experience.\nThe debriefings and the diary entries revealed a dramatic\ndifference between the two testers. The Black tester indi-\ncated that he was frustrated and dissatisfied with the applica-\ntion process. The application process had a negative\nemotional effect on the Black tester. Also, the comparison\nrevealed that the negative effect experienced by the Black\ntester was across the CR and NCR job sites. Moreover, no\nexperiences reflecting such negativity were reported by the\nWhite tester.\nThe gatekeepers in the application process were barriers\nfor the Black male tester participation in the process. He\nwas not only denied applications by the gatekeepers, he was\ndiscouraged from participating in the process. For example,\nhe was asked direct questions regarding his willingness to\nparticipate in a drug screening, he reported being treated\nrude, and he was not offered assistance in completing the\napplication.\nThe use of constant comparative analysis of the diary\nentries resulted in three themes. These themes relate to\n(a) the power and authority of the gatekeepers in the employ-\nment application process, (b) racism, and (c) the emotional\neffect of the application process. All three of the themes\nemerged after careful examination of the diary entries.\n4 SAGE Open\nGatekeepers\nOne theme that emerged from the diaries of the testers is the\nrole of the employee having initial contact with the appli-\ncants. The employee was named the gatekeeper. It was\nobserved during this research that the gatekeepers' primary\nresponsibility in the hiring process was to dispense and\nretrieve applications. The analysis of the diary entries\nrevealed how these responsibilities were taken to various\nlevels of liberty with some gatekeepers on several occasions.\nIt was observed in the diary entries that the gatekeepers\ndecided who received applications and who did not. The tes-\nters' diary entries supported that the gatekeepers were deny-\ning applications more often to the Black male tester as\ncompared with the White male tester. At one location, the\nBlack male tester was denied an application and the White\nmale tester was given one immediately within minutes of\nthe Black tester being denied.\nI went to the office and was greeted by a White female, white\nshirt, 35- to 40-years old, blond-colored hair, and she was heavy\nbuild. I told her I was there to apply for the \"call taker\" position.\nShe told me they were out of applications and turned away. I\ndidn't believe her so I stood for a split second, surprised, and\nthen I started to walk away. I saw a White guy heading to the\nwindow so I was looking back to see was she going to give him\nan application. I could see her looking at me until I got to the\ndoor. She had to lean to look around the White guy who was now\nat her window. I believe she gave him an application but I\ncouldn't be sure. (Wednesday, Black Male Tester, NCR,\nCustomer Service Representative)\nWhen I first entered the building I went through the right\nentrance, walked to the counter, told the receptionist there,\nAfrican American female, petite black hair, mid-to-late 20s that\nI was there to apply for the \"call taker\" position, she informed\nme that I'd have to exit, go through the other entrance, and fill\nout an application in the other office (with the plate-glass\nwindow).\nI exited and reentered the correct office, approached the plate-\nglass window, informed the new receptionist, White female,\nblond hair heavy-set, white shirt, early 30s that I was there to\napply for the call taker position. She told me that I was free to fill\nout an application (located at a small table to the right) and if I\nwanted to return it tomorrow, it had to be in before 2:00 p.m.\n(Wednesday, White Male Tester, NCR, Customer Service\nRepresentative)\nThere were other examples of how the gatekeepers used\ntheir authority. The gatekeepers offered support to the White\nmale applicant in verifying that the information was com-\nplete and accurate. The White male tester commented on one\njob site, where the gatekeeper reviewed applications for the\nappropriate signature and indicated that was one of the first\nfew things the manager checked. This was the job site where\nthe same gatekeeper prescreened the Black male tester\nregarding his work behavior, and asked if he was amenable\nto being fingerprinted, taking a drug test, and allowing a\nbackground check before being given an application.\nWhen I first entered the business I approached the reception\ncounter and the clerk, White male, brown hair (short), red\ncompany uniform shirt with \"Pete\" written on front, asked how\nhe could help. I told him that I was there to apply for the driver's\nposition and he handed over a lengthy application. He pointed\nout that they needed information about job history up to\n10 years. He then told me that I could grab a seat in the lounge\nat the picnic table to fill out the application.1\nWhen I finished I returned to the counter. Pete reviewed the\napplication to make sure that all of the signatures were there\n(which he mentioned was the first thing that the manager looked\nat). He asked to photocopy my license and told me that the\nmanager would be in later today. He would review my\napplication and would be giving me a call later this week. I\nthanked him, we shook hands, and I exited. (Monday, White\nMale Tester, CR, Driver)\nI was greeted by four White males. All were in their early to late\n40s. I talked to the shortest of the four men, who had short\nbrown hair and a beard and mustache. They all had on the\ncompany uniforms with first names sewn above the pocket. I\ntalked to the one with \"Pete\" sewn onto his shirt. I told him I was\nthere to apply for the driver's position. He asked me if I would\nmind working long hours. I told him no. He asked if I would\nmind being fingerprinted, because by federal law they would\nhave to do it. I told him no. Then he asked me if I needed a few\ndays to take a drug test. I said no, I'm not worried about that. He\nsaid we also do background checks. I said O.K. After the\nquestioning, he said I'll go get you an application to fill out. I\ncompleted the application and returned it to the same person. He\naccepted the application and I left. (Friday, Black Male Tester,\nCR, Driver)\nThere were other examples in the diaries describing the\nroles of the gatekeepers. Another diary entry of the Black\nmale tester discussed being asked about previous experience\nin international shipping and the possibility of having a CR.\nAgain, these were questions that were asked prior to giving\nhim an application that were not asked of the White male\ntester.\nAt another job site, the gatekeeper asked the White male\ntester if he had an appointment. When he informed her that\nhe did not, she told him to have a seat and found someone to\ninterview him, thereby receiving an interview. The gate-\nkeeper also pointed out to him the areas on the application\nthat must be completed that included a skill list and math\nquiz. In interacting with the same gatekeeper, as described in\nthe diary, the Black male did not receive the special instruc-\ntion or specific directions in terms of which section to\ncomplete.\nIn a similar experience at a different job site, the White\nmale tester recorded his experience with a human resource\nmanager who informed him that she wanted to interview him\nafter he completed the application. The human resources\nmanager indicated that she was alerted to him by the recep-\ntionist (gatekeeper). There were similar diary entries where\nthe gatekeeper was offering assistance to the White male tes-\nter in the form of reviewing his application and referring him\nto interviews and no such support was given to the Black\nmale tester.\nWhen I first entered the building I approached the receptionist,\nWhite female, dark brown curly hair glasses, brown shirt, and\nearly 40s and I told her that I wanted to apply for the driver's\nposition. She showed me an introduction letter, which states that\nthe applicants must show two forms of ID, high school diploma,\nand three personal character reference letters. I explained that I\nonly had the ID and social security cards with me but I could get\neverything else. The receptionist gave me the application and\ninvited me to grab a seat and fill it out.\nWhile I was filling out the application, the HR manager came\nout (White female, blond hair, tan suit) and said that she was told\nby the receptionist that I was completing an application and she\nwanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions about getting my\ndiploma and letter of reference. I told her I could get both. She\nthen invited me to stay after my application was filled out for a\nprescreening interview.\nWhen I finished the application I gave it to the receptionist\nwho looked it over carefully, copied my SS card and driver's\nlicense, and then told me to have a seat and wait for the HR\nmanager. After a few moments she directed me to the HR\nmanager who invited me into her office. She began asking\nquestions about my employment history, driving history, etc.\nShe explained what the job entailed and described the 2-week\ntraining. She described the criminal background check as\nimportant and said that \"if there's anything on your record\nyou should write it down because it won't matter unless it\nrelates seriously to the job. But, if something came up that\nwasn't written down then it will be considered falsification of\napplication and I would get fired.\" She then stated that she\ndidn't foresee that being a problem in my case. We discussed\nsome other general points of the job. She handed me her\nbusiness card in case I had questions later. She thanked me\nfor coming in. We shook hands, and I thanked her for the\ninterview. I also made sure to thank the receptionist on my\nway out, and then exited the building. (Monday, White Male\nTester, NCR, Driver)\nUpon entering I was greeted by a receptionist, White female in\nher late 30s, brown shoulder length hair with glasses. I told her I\nwas there to apply for the driver position and she handed me a\nvery long application with several inserts. She asked did I have\na driver's license, social security card, diploma, and three letters\nof reference letters. She said you will need that before an\ninterview. I told her it would not be a problem to have this\ninformation for her. Upon completion of the application the\nreceptionist looked it over and said I will give this to the\nmanager. (Tuesday, Black Male Tester, NCR, Driver)\nDiary Entries: Racism\nAnother theme throughout the diary entries involved captur-\ning the \"real-life\" experiences of the testers. In the research\n(1986) discussed how audit studies provide \"real-life\" data.\nSuch data, rich in detail and story cannot be captured using\nsurveys (Yinger, 1986). For instance, the diary entry from the\nBlack male tester, who was prescreened in the presence of\nthe gatekeeper coworker, revealed on-the-spot details and\nreactions that could never be captured in such rich narrative\nafter the experience. The same situation also illustrated how\nthe gatekeeper verified the accuracy of information for the\nWhite tester, but not for the Black tester. If the two testers\nhad not been sent to the same location under the same condi-\ntions, these facts may never have been disclosed. This sup-\nported the theme that the disparity in treatment is based on\nthe race of the tester.\nThere are several examples that supported this theme of\ndisparities in the application process on the part of the gate-\nkeepers that are based on race. They included asking ques-\ntions that are not in the application, not reviewing all\napplications for accuracy, and being denied an application\nwhen the process was still open. The diary entries were cru-\ncial in capturing how the gatekeepers exercised their appar-\nent authority over the initial interview process. There is\nevidence that the gatekeepers discriminately selected who\ncould access the attention of their superiors and who could\nnot. In this case, the White male tester gained access, while\nthe Black male tester did not.\nOne example involved the description of an event where\nthe Black male tester sensed the gatekeeper did not tell the\ntruth regarding her assertion that they were not accepting any\napplications. He described his attempt to see if she was going\nto give an application to a White male who was walking up\nto the gatekeeper as he was leaving, who proved to be the\nother unknown tester. He could see her watching his every\nmove until he left the building. He reported not being able to\nsee her hand the White male an application, but it was veri-\nfied in the diary and debriefing of the White male tester that\nhe did receive an application.\nWhen I first entered, I approached the host, White male, Black\nshort hair, black shirt, late 20s and told him that I was there to\napply for the busser position. He got an application from under\nthe counter and handed it to me. I took a seat in one of the booths\nto fill it out.\nWhen I finished the application, I looked around for the host to\nturn it in, but he was nowhere to be found. I was going to just\nleave it on the table or wait a moment until he returned but then\na manager approached. I asked if I could turn in the application\nwith him. He informed me that he was looking for me because\n\"Paul\" said I was applying for the busser position. He invited me\nto take a seat at one of the tables for an impromptu interview.\nHe asked what type of hours I was looking for, if I was still\n6 SAGE Open\nattending school and how much, and whether I was presently\nemployed. My criminal history (CR job site) never came up in\nthe interview. When he ran out of questions, he introduced\nhimself as \"Tom\" (White male, balding brown hair, black shirt,\nand late 40s). He told me that he would pass the application on\nto \"Karen\" but he told me she was out of town for the week\nbecause her brother was getting married. He said that she'd\nprobably get in touch with me next week for a second interview.\nI thanked him, we shook hands, and I exited the restaurant.\n(Wednesday, White Male Tester, CR, Busser)2\nI was greeted by a young White male in his 20s with dark hair. I\ntold him I was applying for the bus boy position that was\nadvertised. He went to the dining area and returned with an\napplication. He told me if he wasn't around when I was done, I\nshould leave the application on the bar. I completed the\napplication and I was about to leave it on the bar when I saw the\nWhite male. I took him the application. I asked him will there be\ninterviews? The White male looks down at the application and\nsaid he just give them out and pass them on. He mumbled\nsomething under his breath and walked away. (Friday, Black\nMale Tester, CR, Busser)\nThe White male tester also described an interview where\nthe Human Resource Manager asked him where he went to\ngrade school. He reported although she had been told about\nhis CR \"she did not flinch.\" Similarly, he shared an incident\nwhere an owner hired him on the spot before he took a drug\ntest. This experience mirrored another position where he was\ntold he could start training before he took a drug test or com-\npleted his background check.\nWhen I arrived I had to be buzzed into the warehouse after\nringing the door bell and announcing myself. The owner of the\ncompany, White male, White hair with a bit of gray, black shirt,\nmid-to-late 50s, extremely nice guy, led me to the table with\napplications sitting in a box on top. Before grabbing me the\napplication he asked me a few questions, such as, \"Have you\never driven before?\" (yes). Where have you been working?\"\n\"Different jobs.\" \"Why stop?\" (Better opportunities somewhere\nelse), etc. He told me that the regular guy in charge of hiring was\non vacation, so I should just fill out the application and then talk\nto him [the owner].\nBefore I could even finish the first page of the application the\nowner sat down in front of me at the table and told me that since\nhe would be leaving soon that he'd take a look at what I had so\nfar. I offered him my resume as well since I hadn't even gotten\nclose to the employment history section. He looked it over,\nasked me about my experiences in college. He told me a story\nabout his times there in the 60s and how he was entering the\nUnion (still under construction when he heard that Kennedy had\nbeen shot; 1963). He asked some pointed questions and basically\ntold me that it was a foolish move (\"take it from the owner of a\ncompany; this ain't the way to do it\"), and told me about his\npartner whose kids are bankers and engineers because their dad\ndidn't want them in this business. He asked if lifting would be a\nproblem, whether I could pass a drug test, etc. He then told me\nthat he'd give me a job, but under one condition\" that after a\nyear of delivery I would return to school (or else he'd fire me so\nthat I could return to school). I agreed and we shook hands.\nThe owner then told me to finish up the application and he'd get\nthe paperwork started. When I'd finished the application, the\nforeman, White male short light brown hair heavy-set, green\nshirt, mid-to-late 40s, came over to the table with paperwork for\nthe drug test. He collected my application, got on the phone with\nthe drug testing center. He then filled out some paperwork, I\nsigned where I needed to, and he gave me directions to the\ntesting center. The owner came back over and told me to report\nto work tomorrow at 5:30 a.m. and that I'd be going out to\nMadison with him. We talked for moment longer (mostly about\nthe job and common sense), he told me that he wasn't just hiring\nme to be a fill-in, that he was getting ready to fire one driver and\nthat another had been on workman's comp for 3 months, and\nthat I'd have a fairly permanent position. I thanked him again for\nthe opportunity, we shook hands again, and I left the building.\n(Thursday, White Male Tester, NCR, Delivery Driver)\nI was buzzed in and greeted by a White female in her 30s with\nbrown hair. I told her I was there to put in an application for the\ndriver position. She asked me did I have a CDL. I told her that\nthe ad said no CDL was needed. She directed me to a table\nwhere the applications were in a box. I completed the application\nand returned it to her. She informed me that the hiring manager\nwas on vacation and he would be reviewing application when he\nreturned. (Thursday, Black Male Tester, NCR, Delivery Driver)\nThere were numerous examples of events captured during\nthe audit that promoted using the diary method of data col-\nlection and analysis. The \"real-life experiences\" of the tes-\nters provided rich understandings of events that are not\nrecorded by the employer or his or her agent.\nEmotional Effects\nIt was clear from the diary entries of both testers that the\napplication process had an emotional impact that is distinc-\ntively different. The debriefing sessions that followed each\nexperience disclosed these feelings over time. The White\nmale tester related more positive personal contacts during\nthe application process. He used phrases that expressed his\npleasure in his duties like \"I got to work.\" He frequently\nended his diary entries with how he thanked the person\nbefore exiting the building. In one of his diary entries he\nwrote, \"I also made sure to thank the receptionist on my way\nout . . . \" The White male testers related the experience with\nthe owner of a company who hired him on the spot. He\nreferred to him as a \"fatherly advisor.\"\nThe personal reactions by the testers were critical to\nunderstanding the feeling beneath the written word. In one\nentry the Black male tester accused the gatekeeper at one\nlocation of being untruthful. He described the experience of\nanother gatekeeper checking his background and looking up\nat him every 2 min. One gatekeeper was described as being\nrude, arrogant, and flippant, because he told him that his job\nwas merely to accept the applications and pass them on, and\nthen he walked away.\nWords describing the personal contacts were extremely\ninsightful. In our debriefing, the Black male became encour-\naged when an employee representative indicated that he was\nthe most qualified applicant he had seen in 2 years. His con-\nfidence seemed to improve after being approached at another\nlocation where he described a positive interaction with an\nAfrican American gatekeeper who described specifics about\nthe process, and the experience, \"we hit it off.\"\nThe application process also had a dramatic negative\nemotional effect on the Black male tester. He described situ-\nations in his debriefs but with more compelling terms. For\nexample, during the debriefing of the job site where he was\nprescreened by \"Pete,\" he explained that the questioning was\naccusatory. Also, he explained that the experience was more\nthan the questions and that it is something you had to experi-\nence. His emotional reactions became more apparent as the\nprocess continued. He questioned how people could do this\nevery day. He became disturbed regarding the incident where\nhe believed a gatekeeper did not tell the truth about being out\nof applications and turned him away. During the debriefing,\nhe became insistent that the receptionist (gatekeeper) delib-\nerately lied.\nThe Black male tester voiced frustration when he felt\nrejection from someone of his race. He revealed how an\nAfrican American woman in charge of hiring reacted when\nshe reviewed that he had marked on his application that he\nhad a CR. He provided the scripted explanation of his drug\narrest. He became distraught as he described how she rose\nfrom her chair as a signal that it was time for him to leave.\nI was greeted by a young Black male in his mid 20s, with short\nblack hair. I told him I wanted to apply for a driver position. He\ntold me to wait and he would get the manager. He returned with\na medium to heavy built African American woman with black\nhair. I told her I wanted to apply for the driver position. She gave\nme an application from a drawer and told me to bring it to her\noffice when I was done. I completed the application and went to\nher office. She invited me in and told me to have a seat. She\nlooked at the application and the first thing she asked about was\nthe arrest. I told her about the arrest and how the Judge sent me\nto the House of Corrections. Her attitude changed and she said\nsomeone would call me for an interview. As she said this, she\nstood up indicating I should leave. (Monday, Black Male Tester,\nCR, Driver)\nThe above experience of the Black male was not the same\nfor the White male tester. The White male tester visited the\nsame location the following Wednesday:\nWhen I first entered the building I approached the reception\nwindow and requested an application from the receptionist,\nAfrican American male, short black hair (shaved almost bald\nand late 20s, heavy-set). He asked to see my driver's license and\ngave me the application once I handed the license over. I took\nthe application to the table and began working. He came out of\nthe office about halfway through the application and returned\nmy DL.\nWhen I finished the application, I was told to take it and the\nphotocopy of my DL back to the processing office. I met with\nthe Human Resource/Hiring person (African American female,\nheavy-set, black hair, late 30s, white shirt) who gave me an\non-the-spot interview. She inquired about my driving experience,\nwhether I'd accept a job at the Waukesha office if the Milwaukee\njobs were all full, what my availability was. She even gave me a\nlittle quiz about Milwaukee street locations and the location of\ncertain places (Zoo, Museum, etc.), which I passed with flying\ncolors.\nThere was never any mention of a criminal record in the\ninterview but it was in the application. She finished by giving\nme a set of handouts to study in preparation for a CDL class\nmeant to train me for getting a permit. She then told me that she\nwould give me a call by Friday to let me know if I cleared the\nbackground, but she told me that I could start the class tomorrow\nat 9:00 a.m. It was my choice whether to wait for clearance. I\nthanked her, we chatted for another moment and then I exited\nthe building. (Wednesday, White Male Tester, CR, Driver)\nBased on these \"real-life\" experiences, the two testers\ndemonstrated very different emotional responses to the\napplication process. The White male tester appeared more\nupbeat and required less reassurance; he enjoyed the experi-\nence. The Black male tester needed notably more encourage-\nment particularly as the process continued and frustration\nand discouragement escalated.\nSummary\nThe diary entries richly reflect the significance of the per-\nsonal contact by the employer or representative as more\nfavorable to the White over the Black tester. Note that each\none of the locations resulting in a diary entry is frequented by\nboth testers. The diary entries supported the evidence that\nrace and criminal history impacted the employment decision\nto call back an applicant in the present study.\nInterestingly, the diary entries of the testers revealed how\nsome employers and their representatives responded to the\napplicants. The diary method facilitated insight into the com-\npelling nature of these writings. Each tester wrote of his\nunique experiences when interacting with employers and\neach representative as accurately as they could capture.\nThese findings were supported by the specific entries into\nthe diaries of the testers. This data reflected that the employ-\ners and their representatives favored the White male tester\nwho received more interviews from personal contact. For\ninstance, it became apparent that the gatekeepers were favor-\ning the White tester. The Black tester was denied applica-\ntions, whereas data supported that the White tester received\nan application from the same person. There was also evi-\n8 SAGE Open\ndence in behavior notations to support that this was inten-\ntional on the part of the employee.\nThe intentional disparity in treatment between the White\ntester and the Black tester support the theme of racism.\nThroughout the debriefings and diary entries, there are\nexamples of the gatekeepers favoring the White tester over\nthe Black tester. The Black male tester was denied applica-\ntions, treated indifferently, and not provided assistance that\nwas extended to the White tester. It was also evidence from\nthe debriefings and diary entries that this had a negative\nemotional effect on the Black tester. The White male tester\nexpressed a positive outlook on the application process.\nThere were events during the audit that could not be cap-\ntured using merely survey methods. For example, in some\ncases the Black male tester was denied applications, was\nsubjected to preapplication screening, and was told posi-\ntions were filled. Yet, at one job site the Black male tester\nwas praised by an African American manager as being one\nof the most qualified applicants he had seen in 2 years but\nstill did not get a callback. In another case, an African\nAmerican employer offered to make sure the application of\nthe Black male tester got to the manager. He also told him\nhow to follow-up on the process. The Black male tester\nreceived a callback from the employer.\nSimilar experiences occurred with the White male tester.\nThe White male tester reported that at a CR job site, the man-\nager asked him about a school she thought his brother may\nhave attended with her. He wrote in his diary that during the\ninterview he told her of his scripted response about his CR.\nHe wrote, \"She didn't even flinch.\"\nThe White male tester also wrote about being hired by one\nemployer before he completed the application by promising\nto have a drug screening. He described the employer as a\n\"fatherly advisor.\" He also described an experience with a\nhuman resource manager who interviewed him writing that\nshe encouraged him to disclose all of his criminal history on\nthe application. Another experience of the White male tester\noccurred at a CR job site. There is no question on the applica-\ntion regarding a criminal history, so he told the manager of\nhis scripted story during the interview. The White male tester\nwrote there was no follow-up regarding his criminal history.\nConclusion\nThe constant comparative analysis of the diary entries\nrevealed three dominant themes. These themes include\n(a) the power and authority of the gatekeepers, (b) racism,\nand (c) the emotional effects of the application process.\nSeveral visits indicated that the gatekeepers were denying\napplications to the Black male tester. In contrast, they were\noffering assistance to the White tester that resulted in him\nobtaining interviews and assistance with the completion of\nthe application. Furthermore, the Black male tester was\nasked prescreening questions by the gatekeepers that were\nnot asked of the White male tester. At one job site, the Black\nmale tester reported feeling intimidated by the questions\nasked by the gatekeeper, because they were asked in the pres-\nence of employees.\nThe emerging theme of capturing acts of disparate treat-\nment or racism observed during the \"real-life\" experiences of\nthe testers demonstrated the richness of information obtained\nthrough audit and diary entries. The behavior of the gate-\nkeeper was captured in the diaries as events resulting from\nthe interaction with the testers. The \"real-life\" experience\ninvolved the gatekeepers exercising authority in the process\nthat cannot be verified as legitimate.\nThe action of the gatekeepers had an emotional effect on\nthe testers. The White male tester was treated positively by\nthe gatekeepers so his behavior was positive and upbeat. The\nBlack male tester became frustrated at the repeat rejection\nand behavior from the gatekeepers. He required more coun-\nseling and coaching as the process progressed.\nSeveral instances were reported where the gatekeepers\ninfluenced who obtained an application and an interview. It\nappears that individuals in these entry-level positions have\nacquired a significant amount of power and authority. They\nhave either elevated themselves or have been elevated by\nothers in the organization. Moreover, it was not even appar-\nent if their superiors were aware of the liberties taken. The\ndetails captured in the diaries and debriefing sessions\nrevealed that the gatekeepers appeared to make decisions\nbased on their perceptions of the individuals who walked\nthrough their doors\nThe behaviors of the gatekeepers are examples of how the\nBlack male tester was discouraged and prevented from par-\nticipating in the process. These are also examples of activi-\nties and behaviors that cannot be captured by a survey.\nMoreover, it is difficult to design and implement an effective\nsurvey to capture the same information observed in the pres-\nent study. It is unlikely that a gatekeeper will admit in a sur-\nvey that they denied applications to Black applicants. It is\nalso unlikely that a gatekeeper shall admit to aiding some\napplicants based on their race to obtain an interview. There\nwere many similar incidents in the diaries that do not lend\nthemselves to a survey but are better suited for real-world\ncontrolled experiments.\nIt is important to recognize that the behavior of the gate-\nkeeper can persist because there appeared to be no visible\nmechanism or process in place to monitor their activity. In\nshort, they do because they can. One could argue that the\nemployers allow this behavior to occur at the hands of an\nentry-level low-paying and likely expendable person,\nbecause they comply with the will of the employer. This also\nallows the employer an opportunity to avoid taken positive\naction toward increasing diversity of the workplace.\nAuthor's Note\nThis article is based on the dissertation of Lenard Wells while\nattending Cardinal Stritch University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nLenard Wells is currently at the Department of Criminology and\nCriminal Justice, School of Urban Affairs and Public Policy, The\nUniversity of Memphis, TN, USA.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
