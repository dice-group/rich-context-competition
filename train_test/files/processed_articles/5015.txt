In his defini-\ntion, Socrates shows his distrust of their persuasive discourse\nas follows:\n. . . rhetoric is of two sorts: one, which is mere flattery and\ndisgraceful declamation; the other, which is noble and aims at\nthe training and improvement of the souls of the citizens, and\nstrives to say what is best, whether welcome or unwelcome, to\nthe audience . . .\nThen he asks, \"but have you ever known such a rhetoric\nto that question. It is a discussion of an exemplary rhetoric\nthat both ennobles and flatters audiences in the discourse of\nenvironmental studies.\nExamples of both kinds of rhetoric abound in works of\nenvironmental sciences, literature, and criticism. One promi-\nnent example is the emergence of the term sustainability\nevoking imminent crises, such as Earth in the Balance (Gore,\n1992). An Ngram (Figure 1) for sustainability shows a steep\nclimb since the 1970s, perhaps due in part to its Socratic\n\"noble aim,\" but also possibly its power to flatter audiences\nthat policies, practices, or products are sustainable (e.g., BP,\n2013). Another example is growing rebranding of global\nwarming as climate change (Figure 2) following audience\nresponses to weather patterns (Conway, 2008). In these and\nother examples, persuasive discourse leads to changes in\nscholarly research, public policy, and cultural practices.\nTo ask a rhetorical question, how does persuasive dis-\ncourse work? In seemingly small ways, ideas form, enter dis-\ncourse, and reproduce in a vehicle that Dawkins (1989)\ndefined as a meme, \"a unit of cultural transmission\" (p. 192).\nLong before, Hugo (1877) described the effects of persuasive\ndiscourse as, \"One resists the invasion of armies; one does not\nresist the invasion of ideas\" (Chapter X). In such cases, ideas\nattached to discourse can conquer and occupy the world.\nThis essay examines one specific rhetorical device that\nhelped to spread an environmental idea throughout the world.\nregarded as a seminal document in histories of environmen-\nfor the phrase, the land ethic, shows a steep upward curve\nstarting in the 1970s, long after its initial publication, as this\nidea spread along with the expansion of environmental stud-\nies (Worster, 1994). Previous analyses of Leopold's rhetoric\n(e.g., Willard, 2007) have looked at Leopold's writings as\nthrough a telescope, showing the depth of his invention and\ndisposition. This analysis looks as through a microscope at\none technique of his elocution, evidently aimed at both flat-\ntering and ennobling his audiences.\n\"That Imperial First Word\"\nTLE is about 6,650 words long, including its title and sec-\ntion headings.

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) lists\n23 various definitions of the, one of which is, \" . . .\nReferring to a term used generically or universally\" (Item\nII, Example 19). This study concentrates on Leopold's\nusage of that specific meaning, making a simple\ndistinction among three types of usage, as per The Chicago\nManual of Style (16th ed.):\nA definite article points to a definite object that (1) is so well\nunderstood that it does not need description (e.g., \"the package\nis here\" is a shortened form of \"the package that you expected is\nSt. Maurice 3\nhere\"); (2) is a thing that is about to be described (e.g., \"the\nsights of Chicago\"); or (3) is important (e.g., \"the grand prize\").\nExamples of these three usages are shown in Table 1, a\ntabulation of the fourth paragraph of TLE, in a section headed\n\"The Ethical Sequence.\"\nThis essay will concentrate on usages categorized as Type\n3 excluding some singular nouns (i.e., Plato's the soul). Most\nType 3 usages have grammatical and semantic alternatives.\nFor instance, Leopold's usage of the tendency could have\nbeen tendencies, which would be more grammatically con-\nsistent with two plural nouns that it precedes, individuals or\ngroups.\nAmong alternatives in English (Master, 1997), Leopold\nchose a Type 3 definite article in titling his essay TLE as\nwould have been distinct from a land ethic or land ethics.\nThe former usage is an example of an indefinite article, and\nthe latter use is an example of a null article. A fourth type of\narticle is partitive, as in some land ethics.\nThe incidence of Leopold's usages of Type 3 definite arti-\ncles in TLE is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Among 32 usages\ncounted as Type 3, Leopold uses the phrase the land ethic\nonly twice not counting the title; those usages are described\nbelow. He uses 75% of these Type 3 articles in three of the\neight sections, as will also be discussed below after some\ngeneral points about their rhetorical functions.\nFor what rhetorical purposes does Leopold use these\nwords? It seems fair to infer that he is using definite articles\nto claim universality, a well-known rhetorical technique.\nSuch claims are occasionally overstatements, known to rhet-\noricians as hyperbole, an example of which Mark Twain\n(1907) colorfully described in his article on The First Church\nof Christ, Scientist:\n\"THE\" I uncover to that imperial word. . . . It lifts the Mother-\nChurch away up in the sky, and fellowships it with the rare and\nselect and exclusive little company of the THE's of deathless\nglory--persons and things whereof history and the ages could\nfurnish only single examples, not two: the Saviour, the Virgin,\nthe Milky Way, the Bible, the Earth, the Equator, the Devil, the\nMissing Link--and now The First Church, Scientist . . .\nTwain found bombastic flattery in a usage that literally\nuplifts an institution's name. In addition to such sublime con-\nnotations, definite articles can be used to connote solidity, as\nLeopold does by invoking pyramids to describe invisible\necological relations. This technique is called reification as\n. . . a process of constructive abstraction [by which] we can\narrive at abstractions [through] simply located bits of material . . .\nIn short, using Type 3 definite articles can lend both uplift\nand solidity to abstractions. This usage, however, entails\nrisks along with benefits of accessibility. Whitehead calls\none great risk \"the fallacy of misplaced concreteness,\" mak-\ning false oversimplifications of complex abstractions.\ninveighed against misuses of this type: \" . . . inserting the\nwhere it is indefensible, in the false belief that it is impres-\nsive or literary . . . \" (p. 642). For example, the land is often\ninvoked as a reified abstraction without reference to specific\nplaces (Williams, 1985). Despite risks of illogical reifica-\ntion, Type 3 definite articles derive rhetorical force by com-\nbining specificity from Types 1 and 2 in a tactic that Burke\n(1966) called a \" . . . terministic screen . . . stretched to cover\nnot just its own special field but a more comprehensive\nIn TLE, Leopold uses Type 3 definite articles for specific\npurposes. First of all, he modulates them in alternating sec-\ntions that have more frequent usage than sections in which he\nuses few or even none (Figure 4).\nThree sections of TLE were modified from articles pub-\nlished in scholarly journals and had been edited for usage\naccording to various styles. Leopold revised them for this\nessay (Meine, 1988). In the resulting sections that Meine\ncalls \"the scientific backbone\" of TLE occur the most fre-\nquent usages of reified abstractions such as \"the land\" or \"the\nindividual.\"\nLeopold made special use of Type 3 definite articles in\ntwo other sections. In the section headed \"Land Health and\nthe A\u00adB Cleavage,\" Leopold identified two types of conser-\nvationists: One he called Group A, who use land for \"com-\nmodity production\" contrasted with Group B conservationists\nwho regard land \"as a biota, and its function as something\nbroader.\" In the next section headed \"The Outlook,\" Leopold\nelevated Group B's ethics to higher status with a canny usage\nof articles in his definition: \"A thing is right when it tends to\npreserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic com-\nmunity. It is wrong when it tends otherwise\" (at Word 6301,\nemphasis added). He could have used \" . . . a biotic commu-\nnity\" without diminishing the force of that statement, but he\nused a Type 3 article to infer a universal idea that all living\nthings are joined.\nIn that concluding section of Leopold's last published\nwork, in what Meine (2004) called \" . . . arguably the most\nimportant sentence that Aldo Leopold ever wrote\" (p. 210),\nLeopold said, \"I have purposely presented the land ethic as a\nTable 1.

The thing has its origin in the tendency\nof interdependent individuals or groups to evolve\nmodes of co-operation . . .\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 4.

What Leopold did in this\nsentence and in the title of the essay was to promote without\nlengthy argument his version of a land ethic--one of admit-\ntedly two types--over all others, despite Fowler's admoni-\ntion against indefensible logic. No less than THE First\nChurch, THE Land Ethic stakes a claim for universality. To\ncomplete his peremptory elevation, Leopold repeats the title\nwith its definitive article for the second time about 200 words\nfrom the end of the essay with a rhetorical technique known\nUpshots\nThe rhetoric of TLE was deployed to persuade a general\naudience. Leopold was a prolific author who had published\nmany scientific articles, textbooks, and tracts on land use,\nforestry, and wildlife. He was a recognized practitioner of\nscientific rhetoric in which universal statements and affecta-\ntions of impartiality are valued (Bazerman, 2000). He was\nalso a fecund writer of letters, journals, and phenological\ndata, who left a trove for scholars after his untimely death in\n1948. In that same year, he crafted TLE with rhetoric admit-\ntedly different from what he used for persuading professional\npeers. He renders judgments and calls for actions. For\ninstance, he refers to the conservation movement as \"the\nWord 6645) \"The case for a land ethic would appear hopeless\nbut for the minority which is in obvious revolt against these\nSt. Maurice 5\n`modern' trends\" (p. 188). He then appeals to the broadest\npossible audience by evoking two universals: evolution and\nOnly the most superficial student of history supposes that Moses\n\"wrote\" the Decalogue; it evolved in the minds of a thinking\ncommunity, and Moses wrote a tentative summary of it for a\n\"seminar.\" I say tentative because evolution never stops (p. 188)\nLeopold, a lover of music, here plays his prose instrument\nfortissimo. In this passage, he aligns his land ethic with the\nMosaic Decalogue, further enshrining a biotic and ecological\nland ethic as a version of the Golden Rule of universal moral-\nHe also connects his land ethic to evolution, which he\ncites in TLE 12 times as a noun or adjective and cites twice\nin the paragraph beginning, \"I have purposefully presented\nthe land ethic . . . \" He is unswerving in his conviction that\nevolution is a universal mechanism of natural, social, and\nmoral change. He nonetheless expressed doubt about future\nchanges.\nTLE was published in a section \"The Sand County\nAlmanac\" that he had titled The Upshot using another Type 3\ndefinite article. As Leopold well knew, the literal term\nderives from a hunting shot taken in an up-range direction.\nAs the heading for TLE, it denotes uncertainty about what\nlies ahead; it is repeated in the section titled with another\nType 3 definite article \"The Outlook.\" He said, \"Perhaps the\nmost serious obstacle impeding the evolution of a land ethic\nis the fact that our educational and economic system is\nheaded away from, rather than toward, an intense conscious-\nwar, plagued by illness, and disappointed that his colleagues\nhad not turned--as he had--away from exploiting natural\nresources toward their stewardship, Leopold was not\noptimistic.\nHe had been present at many changes, including forestry\nand ecology as disciplines of applied science; conservation\npolicy at public and private agencies; and as a pioneer\nresearcher and developer of wildlife and soil and water man-\nagement. He was an internationally renowned scholar whose\ndoubts set a tone for environmental communications in\ndecades to come, fusing rhetorics of science and morality to\nskeptically describe present harms and warn of impending\ndangers (AtKisson, 1999). Like Socrates, his skepticism\ncohabited with his idealism.\nConclusion\nTLE was published posthumously as an epilogue to the\ndescriptive prose of A Sand County Almanac and as a reflec-\ntion following his observations of life on a small plot of land.\nIn this analysis, one small but important effect in TLE was\nLeopold's deft usage of definite articles to confer universal-\nity on his proposed ethic. He eschewed fallacies or hyperbole\nthat have plagued rhetorics since Plato's time. Twain,\nWhitehead, and Fowler warned that bombast can sprout in\nthe shade of a tiny word but withers under scrutiny. Rather\nthan that, TLE's survival and prosperity have contributed to\nevolving rhetorics, policies, and practices in science, poli-\ntics, and philosophy.\nAfter two decades of neglect, TLE achieved much of its\nauthor's purpose. By its fifth decade, it had influenced a host\nof environmental activists who have affected environmental\npolicies and practices in deploying their own rhetoric com-\nbining scientific rigor and spiritual fervor, as Leopold did.\nThere is a worldwide secular religion which we may call\nenvironmentalism, holding that we are stewards of the earth,\nthat despoiling the planet with waste products of our luxurious\nliving is a sin, and that the path of righteousness is to live as\nfrugally as possible. . . . The worldwide community of\nenvironmentalists - most of whom are not scientists--holds the\nmoral high ground, and is guiding human societies toward a\nhopeful future. Environmentalism, as a religion of hope and\nrespect for nature, is here to stay\nWhether or not environmentalism is a secular religion, its\nalignment of practical wisdom and spiritual idealism does\nseem to be implanted in public discourse. By now, the land\nethic is a phrase that meets all the criteria of a successful\nmeme, along with such others as sustainability or climate\nchange. In coining it, Leopold combined Sophistic flattery and\nSocratic nobility in ways that have persuaded multitudes to\njoin his Group B among scientists, policymakers, and citizens\naround the world. In Twain's words, the land ethic with its\n\"imperial first word\" has indeed joined that \"rare and select\nand exclusive little company of the THEs of deathless glory\".\n"
