T2D differs from type 1\ndiabetes in that insulin intake is not required for survival. The\nincreasing prevalence of T2D is a major public health prob-\nlem, with approximately 13percent of the population world-\nwide having a diabetes diagnosis, of which around 90percent\nis a type 2 and an estimated total annual cost of US$348 bil-\nlion in North America, which correspond to almost 14\nper-\ncent of the total health budget of the region (International\nDiabetes Federation, 2015). Until recently, T2D manifested\nmainly in adults 40years and older, but in the last 20years,\nan increase in the prevalence of T2D among youth has been\nobserved (Dabelea et al., 2014). Physical activity (PA) plays\na crucial role in the treatment of T2D (Colberg et al., 2016;\nommendations of practicing at least 150minutes of moderate\nto vigorous PA (MVPA) per week (including aerobic and\nresistance exercises), regular PA practice promotes the man-\nagement of core metabolic goals for T2D, glycemia, arterial\npressure, and cholesterol (American Diabetes Association\nthat only 13percent of patients are achieving the composite\ngoal of these three clinical indicators (Leiter et al., 2013).\nDespite the benefits of PA for T2D, between 60 and 70per-\ncent of adults with diabetes in the United States and in\nCanada are not practicing enough PA or are not considered\ncent of adults in the non-diabetic US and Canadian popula-\nGiven these participation trends, it has become essential\nto understand why so few adults with T2D (hereafter T2D\nadults) regularly practice PA, despite the existing documen-\ntation on its beneficial effects for their health.

(2009) have summarized and\norganized the main barriers reported by T2D adults in seven\ncategories: lack of motivation, health problems, negative\nemotions (e.g. shame), lack of social support, lack of facili-\nties for exercises, cultural barriers, and weather.\nA promising theoretical approach to understanding and\nsolving this concern is the strength energy model (SEM,\nalso known as the strength model of self-control, the self-\nregulatory strength model, or simply the strength model),\ndeveloped by Baumeister and colleagues (Baumeister et al.,\nAccording to the SEM, self-control is a finite resource that\ndetermines the capacity for effortful control over dominant\nresponses and, once expended, it leads to impaired self-\ncontrol in task performance, known as ego depletion. More\nprecisely, \"ego depletion refers to the state of diminished\nself-control resources, when one cannot or does not suc-\ncessfully implement further control\" (Maranges and\nBaumeister, 2016). Building on the SEM's assumptions,\nliterature review offering researchers and practitioners a\nbetter understanding of self-regulation and ego depletion in\nthe context of health-related behavior adherence, especially\nin terms of PA engagement and adherence. Within their\nwork, these authors describe extensively how the SEM can\nexplain behavioral self-regulation in a PA participation\ncontext.\nThe SEM, its principal components, and its implications\nfor PA practice are described below. Then, based on this\nmodel's assumptions regarding self-regulation resources,\nthe herein work aims to explain how self-regulation could\nplay a major role in the difficulties experienced by T2D\nadults related to PA practice compared to adults from the\nnormal population. More specifically, section \"Components\nof the SEM\" presents the two key concepts of the SEM,\nnamely, self-control and self-regulation. Section\n\"Underlying assumptions of the SEM\" explains the under-\nlying hypotheses of the SEM as self-control resource exer-\ntion, replenishment, and improvement. Section \"The\nphysiological energy resource of self-regulation\" reports\nthe latest theoretical advances in terms of the physiological\ncounterpart of the SEM and its \"energy reserve.\" Section\n\"Fatigue, ego depletion, and self-regulatory failure\" pre-\nsents key concepts related to self-regulatory exertion and\nits expected consequences, while section \"Using the SEM\nto explain the low rate of PA participation among T2D\nadults\" introduces how, according to the SEM, T2D adults\ncould be vulnerable to chronic ego depletion, which can\nexplain their lower PA participation. Several strategies to\novercome ego depletion are then provided in section\n\"Strategies for preventing self-regulatory failure in the con-\ntext of PA participation among T2D adults,\" followed by\nsuggestions for future research in section \"Implications and\nfuture directions.\" Of note is that although few sections\nlook at self-regulation physiological substrates (i.e. glu-\ncose, brain structures, and executive functions), the main\nfocus of this work consists of examining the psychological\n(versus physiological) perspective of self-regulation and its\nimpact on PA engagement.\nComponents of the SEM\nSelf-control\nAccording to the SEM, self-control is a capacity that\ndepends on a global limited resource that can become\ndepleted or replenished following different behaviors. This\ncapacity tends to conserve energy and can be improved\nwith training (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016). Self-control\nresources are global and limited because every task that\nrequires self-control uses the same resources. No matter\nwhat caused the depletion, if the resource is so low that\nself-control cannot be exerted efficiently, successful com-\npletion of the task will be impeded (Hagger et al., 2010b;\nMuraven and Baumeister, 2000). More details on these\nunderlying assumptions of the SEM (conservation, recov-\nery, and training) are presented further below.\nSelf-control has major positive impacts on a variety of\nlife domains: work, school, relationships, health, health-\nrelated behaviors, and longevity (Maranges and Baumeister,\n2016). It also seems that the benefits of increased self-con-\ntrol are linear, never reaching a point where more self-con-\ntrol would be detrimental (De Ridder et al., 2012; Tangney\net al., 2004). Moreover, self-control as a trait (dispositional\nself-control) is strongly associated with the formation and\nmaintenance of habits, as well as breaking habits and mak-\ning life choices that reduce exposure to temptations (De\nspecific acts of self-control (Maranges and Baumeister,\n2016), like refraining the urge to eat a doughnut before an\naerobic class, are considered sub-processes of self-regula-\ntion, \"those that aim to override unwanted, prepotent\nimpulses or urges\" (Hofmann et al., 2012).\nSelf-regulation\nThe term \"self-regulation\" is considered as \"the ability to\nalter one's responses based on rules, goals, ideals, norms,\nplans, and other standards\" or as \"a set of psychological and\nperceptual processes by which individuals work toward the\nachievement of goals and objectives by keeping them on\ntrack and minimizing distractions or impulses\" (Baumeister\nspeaking, self-regulation arises in response to a clash\nbetween two desires, one that is more focused on immediate\ninterests and another that is more distant and that takes into\nconsideration what would be best, all things considered\nCastonguay et al. 3\n(Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). Self-regulation is a process\nworking as a feedback loop in which the actual state is com-\npared with the desired state and in which adjustments (punc-\ntual acts of self-control) are made when deviations from the\ngoal occur (Carver and Scheier, 2016). For example, when\npeople engage in a new PA routine, they may face barriers,\nincluding fatigue. Using self-regulation would mean\nremembering that a goal has not yet been achieved and then\nchoosing to push oneself to engage in the activity, despite\nfeeling fatigued. In this example, pushing oneself is a form\nof exerting self-control to stay in line with a goal.\nWhen we feel the desire to act in a certain way, but we\nchoose to act in a way that would be more appropriate or\nconsistent with our goals, we show self-regulation, which is\nbased on four variables: the standard, monitoring, energy,\nand motivation (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). The standard\nis the criterion or the goal according to which we want to\nalign our behavior. For example, when people attend fitness\nclasses, they try to replicate the movements made by the\ninstructor. They do not execute movements impulsively, as\nthe standard in such a situation is to imitate the instructor. It\ncould also be a more personal and broader goal, such as\nbeing physically active. Monitoring refers to focusing atten-\ntion on a behavior and to the desire to undertake and com-\npare different standards. In other words, it is the action of\ncomparing the actual state with the desired state and ensur-\ning the actual behavior stays in line with the goal.According\nto the SEM, controlling, changing, or retaining a behavior;\nmaking a decision; and showing willingness require energy.\nThis energy, also known as self-regulatory strength, a self-\ncontrol resource, or willpower, is considered a global lim-\nited internal resource (Baumeister et al., 1998; Baumeister\nnote is that the capacity and effectiveness to regulate oneself\ndepend on the available energy level. If this level is so low\nthat behaviors requiring self-control are affected negatively\nor the person lacks willingness, the individual will enter a\nstate of ego depletion (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). For\nexample, in the morning after a good night's sleep, it is more\nlikely that one will have enough energy to undertake a new\nresolution, such as starting a new workout program, com-\npared to in the evening. However, after a day of particularly\ndemanding work, it is possible that one will not have enough\nenergy to regulate him or herself. In this situation, it will be\nmore difficult to undertake the same resolution. The motiva-\ntion level is the fourth variable on which the self-regulation\ncapacity stands (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). For someone\nto self-regulate voluntarily, one must be motivated to\nobserve the standard, to use its resources, and, therefore, to\nself-regulate. Thus, even when the first three variables are\nfavorable, if the person does not consider it important or is\nnot motivated to self-regulate, he or she will not. Worth\nmentioning is that the four variables are all-important, but\nnot all necessary. For example, to some extent, motivation\ncan compensate for a lack of energy, allowing for successful\nself-regulation even within a state of ego depletion, but only\net al., 2010b). Eventually, the fatigue will become insur-\nmountable, and replenishing activities will become\nnecessary.\nUnderlying assumptions of the SEM\nbased on three main underlying hypotheses: the conserva-\ntion, the recovery, and the training hypotheses. According\nto the conservation hypothesis, as self-control is drawn\nfrom a limited energy reserve, individuals must allocate\nsuch energy strategically while considering future events.\nTherefore, if individuals consider that they will have to\nengage in a demanding self-regulatory task in the future,\nthey will be more likely to conserve their resources. By\ndoing so, tasks requiring self-regulation could be affected\nnegatively in the meantime. The recovery hypothesis states\nthat following depletion, the self-regulation capacity can be\nrestored. Just as with a muscle, the time for recovery\ndepends on the intensity and duration of the depleting task.\nThe more severe the exertion, the longer the recovery will\nbe. A sufficient amount of breaks, relaxation sessions, and\nsleep are essential in the replenishment of self-control\nresources (Krizan and Garrett, 2016; Tyler and Burns,\n2008). Finally, the training hypothesis supposes that the\nself-regulation capacity can be developed and increased\nJust as a muscle would develop through regular, specific\nexercises, appropriate exposure to self-control tasks is\nexpected to lead to improvements in self-regulation capac-\nity. Noteworthy is that such improvements are not limited\nto training conditions; they could also be generalized to\nother activities. For instance, as reported by Hagger et al.\n(2010b), if someone trains the self-regulation capacity by\nforcing him or herself to use a non-dominant hand for a\ncertain amount of time, the increase in the self-regulation\ncapacity could also benefit his or her adherence to a new\nPA. However, enough recovery time and experience with\nself-regulatory success are needed for the training to pro-\nduce self-regulation performance improvements (Hagger\nThe physiological energy resource of\nself-regulation\nEven though studies have reported a significant relation-\nship between glucose levels and ego depletion (Baumeister\net al., 2010a), others have not succeeded in replicating\nber of published arguments against the direct link between\nglucose and self-control, Baumeister and Vohs (2016)\n4 Health Psychology Open \nsuggested that glucose alone is not sufficient to explain the\nSEM, because ego depletion (the state of self-control\nresource exertion) appears long before glucose exertion.\nTherefore, other research avenues have been suggested to\nreplace the glucose hypothesis as a physiological equiva-\nlent to willpower, such as adenosine (Baumeister and Vohs,\n2016). Even if glucose were the equivalent of willpower\n(the limited physiological energy resource used by self-\nregulation), self-regulation alone would not be a threat to\nthe body's global reserve of glucose (Baumeister, 2016;\nSelf-regulation relies on several executive functions (e.g.\ninhibiting, monitoring, and shifting) (Hirt et al., 2016) and,\nby extension, brain structures (Magen et al., 2014; Vohs\nand Baumeister, 2016) that rely on glucose, but the energy\nconsumption of self-regulation is too small to disrupt glu-\ncose levels in the brain (Segerstrom et al., 2016).According\nto Baumeister and Vohs (Baumeister and Vohs, 2016; Vohs\nand Baumeister, 2016), the main taxing effect of self-regu-\nlation would not be on the glucose reserve, but on brain\nreceptiveness, attention, and mental effort.\nFatigue, ego depletion, and self-\nregulatory failure\nSimilar to the muscles, neurological processes associated\nwith self-regulation are incapacitated by continuous solici-\ntation (Wagner and Heatherton, 2016). Even though the\nbody's energy levels are still largely sufficient to sustain\neffort for a longer period, an increase in fatigue leads to\ndecreased performance (Krizan and Garrett, 2016). Only\nappropriate replenishment conditions (e.g. taking breaks,\ndoing enjoyable activities, and sleeping) can counteract the\ndeleterious effects. It has been suggested that this feeling of\nfatigue could be attributed to a conservation tendency\ntoward the executive functions required by self-regulation\n(Krizan and Garrett, 2016). This tendency would limit uses\nof executive functions and self-regulation to preserve brain\nreceptiveness for other processes. When willpower runs\nlow after self-control exertion, the individual enters a state\nof self-regulatory fatigue called ego depletion (Baumeister,\n2014). It is important to note that even though general\nfatigue can affect self-control and therefore ego depletion,\nego depletion is not fatigue (Baumeister et al., 2006; Hagger\ntion, there are not enough resources left to self-regulate,\nwhich increases the chance of a self-regulatory failure.\nA self-regulatory failure is characterized by a lack of self-\ncontrol or by its opposite, impulsivity, and it takes the form\nof either under regulations (\"failure to exert control over\noneself\") or misregulations (\"exerting control in a way that\nfails to produce the desired result\") (Baumeister et al., 1994;\nSayette and Creswell, 2016). In other words, a self-regula-\ntory failure occurs when the self-regulation process fails. In\na PA context, a self-regulatory failure would imply, for\ninstance, the skipping of a training session after an exerting\nworkday because one does not feel like training. A self-regu-\nlatory failure is expected to occur when (1) a desire becomes\ntoo strong, (2) self-regulatory fatigue becomes too strong, or\n(3) the importance of the goal (motivation) is not strong\nenough (Heatherton and Wagner, 2011; Krizan and Garrett,\n2016). Physiologically, a self-regulatory failure has been\nproposed to be the result of a connectivity impairment among\nthe brain structures responsible for the executive functions\nessential to self-regulation (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016).\nUsing the SEM to explain the low rate\nof PA participation among T2D adults\nThe limited resource model of self-control, as conceptual-\nized by the SEM, could prove useful in explaining the low\nPA participation among T2D adults (Adriaanse et al., 2013;\nCradock et al., 2017). As the integration of regular PA prac-\ntice is one of the many complex tasks T2D adults must\naccomplish to manage their condition optimally (Powers\net al., 2017), having a sufficient self-regulation capacity acts\nas a facilitator and is positively associated with goal achieve-\nment (Baumeister et al., 1998; Muraven and Baumeister,\n2000). Conversely, the self-regulation capacity becomes an\nimportant barrier to PA engagement if it becomes exhausted\nby previous self-control demands, too many self-control\ntasks undertaken simultaneously, or the anticipation of a\nfuture activity requiring self-regulation (Dorris et al., 2012;\net al., 2006). In such a situation, one is left in a state of\nexhaustion or ego depletion, and such consequences as self-\nregulatory failure are expected (Hagger et al., 2009).\nBecause T2D adults must engage in several tasks to manage\nand cope with their condition, such as monitoring their diets\n(what to eat, when to eat, what portion size, etc.), glucose\nlevels (keeping it within the acceptable range), and medica-\ntions (when to take what) (Powers et al., 2017), they are left\nwith few self-regulatory resources to integrate and sustain\nPA into their daily life. This in itself requires a high level of\nIn line with the issue raised above regarding PA engage-\nment and self-regulation, a highly interesting research ave-\nnue pertains to the SEM's capacity to explain the low rate\nFigure 1. How diabetes management related tasks influence\nself-regulation resources and PA practice among T2D adults.\nCastonguay et al. 5\nof PA participation among T2D adults compared to that\namong adults from the general population. Accordingly, the\npotential effects of (1) glucose, brain structures, and execu-\ntive functions; (2) mood regulation; and (3) T2D-related\nsymptoms on ego depletion and, as a consequence, on PA\nparticipation among T2D adults are presented below and\nresumed in Figure 1. Each topic is described as a potential\npredisposition for T2D adults to be ego depleted, rendering\nthem more vulnerable to self-regulatory failures when\nattempting to include PA in their daily life.\nGlucose, brain structures, and executive\nfunctions\nOver the past years, glucose has been proposed as a physi-\nological equivalent of willpower, the self-control resource\nthat becomes depleted with usage (Gailliot and Baumeister,\nreported by the meta-analysis of Vadillo et al. (2016), have\nfailed to establish a clear link between glucose and self-\nregulation, casting doubt on their hypothesized link.\nNevertheless, some evidence shows that glucose still plays\nan important role in self-regulation (Baumeister and Vohs,\n2016). This seems an important consideration for T2D\nadults, given that their condition is intrinsically related to\nFor instance, the impact of glucose on self-regulation\namong T2D adults could be indirect by means of its effect\non brain structures. This assumption is partially supported\nby a recent suggestion that a self-regulatory failure could\nbe the result of reduced coupling between brain regions,\nmainly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Wagner and\nHeatherton, 2016). In fact, three sub-regions of the PFC\n(ventromedial PFC, lateral PFC, and anterior cingulate cor-\ntex), each linked to executive functions and self-regulatory\nprocesses, are largely interconnected with one another and\nhave connections with other self-regulation-related brain\nregions. For example, the ventromedial PFC is associated\nwith maintaining self-control, the lateral PFC with recog-\nnizing when to switch tasks, and the anterior cingulate cor-\ntex with the capacity to keep a behavior in line with a goal.\nAdditionally, many studies have linked ego depletion to\nreduced connectivity between and from those three regions\nThe connectivity explanation of a self-regulatory fail-\nure concurs with the SEM idea that self-regulation\ndepends on a common resource that becomes depleted\nthrough exertion. It could explain why prior studies have\nfound a significant relation between glucose and self-reg-\nulation. As reported by a recent meta-analysis, swishing a\nglucose solution around in the mouth is the only way glu-\ncose may significantly be implicated in self-control\n(Dang, 2016). This could be explained by the activation of\nself-regulation-related brain regions by glucose-sensitive\nreceptors in the mouth (Wagner and Heatherton, 2016).\nMoreover, according to the results of a meta-analysis\nexamining the impact of diabetes on cognitive functions\n(McCrimmon et al., 2012), as well as a meta-analysis sur-\nveying the impact of T2D on memory and executive func-\ntions (Sadanand et al., 2016), T2D significantly burdens\ncognitive functioning. Among the reported affected cog-\nnitive functions, executive functions and attention are\nessential to self-regulation (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016).\nT2D is also associated with the deterioration of many\nbrain structures linked with those cognitive functions,\nsuch as the frontal lobe (Moulton et al., 2015), being\nhighly responsible for self-regulation and normal func-\ntioning (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016). Thus, even though\nthe exact dynamic between glucose and self-control\nremains to be explained, it is still accepted that glucose\nplays a significant role in self-regulation. Given the intrin-\nsic relation between glucose and their condition, T2D\nadults could be physiologically more prone to experience\nself-regulatory failures.\nMood regulation\nDepression, anxiety, stress, and diabetes-related distress.Com-\npared to the non-diabetic population, T2D adults are more\nprone to suffer from depression (Mezuk et al., 2008; Nou-\nand distress (Fisher et al., 2008), which can seriously hin-\nder diabetes self-management (Powers et al., 2017), includ-\ning PA participation (Ciechanowski et al., 2000). Moreover,\nT2D adults tend to feel negative emotions about PA. They\nfeel ashamed to train with people who do not have T2D,\nand they are afraid of getting hurt and of experiencing a\nhypoglycemic episode, which could impede their PA\nengagement (Korkiakangas et al., 2009). According to the\nSEM conceptual framework, regarding the assumption that\nthe self-control capacity is global and limited, it is expected\nthat negative emotional states, such as depressive and anx-\nious symptoms related to PA or not, would have a negative\nimpact on the self-control capacity (Baumeister et al., 1999;\nMuraven and Baumeister, 2000). Therefore, T2D adults\nwho are particularly vulnerable to negative emotional states\nwould also be more prone to experience ego depletion. In\nsuch a state, a self-regulatory failure is more likely to occur,\nand thus, PA practice and diabetes self-management are\nlikely to be impeded.\nIt is also important to consider the impact of stressful\nlife events on diabetes self-management and PA adherence\namong T2D adults. According to Baumeister et al. (1999),\nstressful life events tax the self-control capacity, and there-\nfore, fewer resources remain to cope with the demands\nassociated with other activities. Moreover, the act of coping\nin the face of stress depletes self-control resources and neg-\natively affects self-control performance (Muraven and\nBaumeister, 2000). As the integration of PA into one's life\nrequires a great amount of self-control, it is proposed that\n6 Health Psychology Open \nIn addition, as stress directly draws from one's self-regula-\ntion capacity (Baumeister et al., 1999), it is susceptible to\naffect negatively the executive functions and brain struc-\ntures (McEwen, 2016) associated with self-regulation and\nto worsen diabetes management and glucose levels (ADA,\n2017). Prior research supports the negative impact of\ndepression (Katon et al., 2010), anxiety (Lipscombe et al.,\nengagement among T2D adults.\nIn addition to daily stress, the multiple taxing tasks\nrelated to diabetes self-management are directly predictive\nof a specific form of stress called diabetes distress, which\nis highly common among people with diabetes (Young-\ntes distress is associated with \"significant negative\npsychological reactions related to emotional burdens and\nworries specific to an individual's experience in having to\nmanage a severe, complicated, and demanding chronic dis-\nease such as diabetes.\" T2D adults are exposed to a daily\nburden associated with a high stress potential, which is the\nself-management of their condition. Indeed, the ADA, the\nAmerican Association of Diabetes Educators, and the\nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics state, \"Diabetes is a\nchronic disease that requires a person with diabetes to\nmake a multitude of daily self-management decisions and\nto perform complex care activities\" (Powers et al., 2017).\nThis statement has two main implications regarding the\nself-regulation capacity and therefore ego depletion for\nT2D adults. First, it requires a person newly diagnosed\nwith T2D to learn and incorporate into his or her life and\ndaily routine complex new habits. Second, even after\nlearning is achieved or years after diagnosis, T2D still\nrequires daily complex self-management decisions. These\ntwo implications have an important impact on self-control\nresources, making T2D adults more prone to a state of\nchronic ego depletion, which has the potential to burden a\nwide variety of life aspects, including PA engagement\nT2D-related symptoms\nAccording to Grootenhuis et al. (1994), the most common\nT2D-associated symptoms include frequent urination, sig-\nnificant thirst, a lack of energy, irritability, fatigue, a lack of\nconcentration, palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, loss\nof sensation, sensations of tingling or prickling, and vision\ndeterioration. All of these symptoms are potential discom-\nforts with which T2D adults must cope, including during\ntheir PA session. In line with prior work by Solberg Nes\nnesses and on coping with chronic pain, the authors herein\nsuggest that symptoms related to T2D may diminish self-\ncontrol resources. Moreover, T2D adults are often afflicted\nwith poor sleep quality (Luyster and Dunbar-Jacob, 2011)\nWest et al., 2006). Those who do not have enough sleep and\nwho have a poor sleep quality also tend to present poorer\nglycemic control and therefore higher HbA1c levels (Trento\net al., 2008), which in turn leads to more severe diabetes-\nrelated symptoms, including fatigue. As explained above,\nself-control resources become replenished, among others,\nthrough sleep. If sleep sessions are deficient or incomplete,\nT2D adults potentially cannot restore fully the energy level\nrequired to self-regulate their daily lives and attain their\ngoals.\nConclusion on the SEM's capacity to explain the\nlow rate of PA participation among T2D adults\nCompared to the general population, T2D adults engage\nless frequently in PA (Health Canada, 2002; Morrato et al.,\ncould be explained by the fact that T2D adults present\nhigher self-regulation vulnerabilities compared to others.\nAlthough the hypothesis according to which glucose is the\nequivalent of willpower could potentially explain this dif-\nference (given that glucose regulation is a core problem\nassociated with T2D), recent developments in the SEM\ntend to confirm that glucose is not the equivalent of will-\npower, although it still plays an important role in self- regu-\nTherefore, besides the hypothetical direct link between glu-\ncose and self-regulation, other factors can explain why T2D\nadults, given their condition, would be more susceptible to\nchronic ego depletion. First, T2D has been shown to tax\nsignificantly cognitive functioning, including the executive\nfunctions essential to self-regulation, and to deteriorate\nbrain regions underlying these functions. Second, T2D\nadults present higher depressive and anxious symptoms\nthan the general population, directly impeding their self-\ncontrol. Finally, symptoms associated with T2D can also\ndrain self-regulation resources, if only because of pain and\nimpaired sleep quality. Specifically, every T2D-related\nsymptom comes with a potential self-control cost given that\nindividuals need to cope with discomfort or pain through\ndaily activities, including PA sessions.\nStrategies for preventing\nself-regulatory failure in the context of\nPA participation among T2D adults\nThe main objective of the present theoretical review was to\nhighlight the importance of the SEM when it comes to\nexplaining the lower rate of PA participation among T2D\nadults compared to adults from the general population. As\nsuch, the authors herein presented the latest theoretical\ndevelopments in the SEM, as well as the underlying rationale\nor reasons why T2D adults would be more susceptible to\nCastonguay et al. 7\nchronic ego depletion, which, in turn, favors self-regulatory\nfailure in PAengagement. In accordance with the SEM, chal-\nlenging new behaviors, such as PA practice, should be inte-\ngrated carefully and progressively to avoid ego depletion and\ndropout. T2D adults are often asked to work on multiple,\ncomplex, and challenging tasks and to perform new behav-\niors, such as acquiring knowledge related to diabetes man-\nagement, changing their diets, monitoring their glucose\nlevels, and, if required, discontinuing drinking alcohol and\nsmoking. This list cannot be undertaken all at once. Trying to\ndo so could render a person more vulnerable to burnout\n(Schmidt et al., 2007) and could lead to a state of chronic ego\ndepletion (Hagger et al., 2010a). Indeed, when managing\ntheir condition, T2D adults may experience an overload of\ndemanding self-control tasks combined with a lack of breaks\nand self-regulatory success. As outlined by Hagger et al.\n(2010a), such a situation could be the equivalent of over-\ntraining, which in this case would lead to a state of chronic\nego depletion.\nIn consideration of the above-mentioned points, T2D\nadults can use various strategies to cope with their condi-\ntion, while being careful with their self-regulation capacity\nand other demanding activities. The next section aims to\npresent strategies that can prevent self-regulatory failures\nin the context of PA participation and T2D adult-related\nvulnerabilities. Because few examples in the literature\nexist regarding the promotion of self-regulation in T2D\nadults in a PA participation context, strategies to prevent\nego depletion or to restore the self-regulation capacity are\nsuggested based on research conducted with non-T2D\nindividuals.\nSequential integration of new behaviors\nThe first technique to prevent ego depletion and increase\nPA engagement in T2D adults pertains to the progressive\nintegration of new behaviors. A new behavior integrated\ninto T2D adults' routines is more likely to be maintained\nover time if this additional demand on self-control is well\nplanned to occur when self-control resources are expected\nto be available (Hagger et al., 2010b). If several new behav-\niors must be integrated into one's routine, as is the case for\nadults newly diagnosed with T2D (e.g. acquiring knowl-\nedge associated with T2D management, managing a diet,\nand engaging in PA regularly), patients are advised to\nundertake one new behavior at the time. Even though other\nbehaviors are important, individuals are encouraged to ini-\ntiate each progressively and to select attainable goals\n(Hagger et al., 2010b). Trying to modify or to integrate too\nmany novel behaviors at the same time can be too demand-\ning on self-control resources, therefore increasing the risk\nof self-regulatory failure and PA dropout. Results obtained\nby Jenkins et al. (2016) corroborate this assumption among\nadults diagnosed with T2D trying to improve their dietary\nadherence. These researchers found that the more severe\nthe overexertion of self-control, the sooner the dietary\nrelapse.\nSelf-regulation training\nSelf-regulation training is another strategy to counter ego\ndepletion and increase PA engagement among T2D adults.\nSelf-regulation training can be undertaken in the same way\nas muscle training. Regular exposure to demanding situa-\ntions in which one experiences self-regulatory success, fol-\nlowed by sufficient breaks and rest to allow for the\nreplenishment of self-control resources, is expected to lead\nto self-regulation improvements (Hagger et al., 2010b).\nEvery task requiring self-control, from weak urges to those\nthat challenge self-regulatory capacity limits, is a potential\nself-regulation training opportunity, provided one remains\nwithin the limits of his or her current capacity. Exceeding\none's capacity, even for a training exercise, can lead to ego\ndepletion and self-regulatory failure. However, just as the\nbenefits of developing self-regulation are transferable to\nother situations, the costs of ego depletion are too. Thus,\nself-regulation improvements or ego depletion developed\nduring a training task could affect primary goal-related\nself-control tasks. Training self-regulation to achieve a spe-\ncific goal can be achieved in a goal-related context with\ntime and practice or in a second, easier goal-related context\nthat will bolster self-regulation in general, which will also\nbenefit the main goal. It is expected that these additional\nself-control challenges will promote PA self-regulation. In\nother words, additional self-control challenges will improve\nthe likelihood of self-regulatory success in PA engagement\nand adherence by improving individuals' self-regulation\ncapacity through prior integration of an easier behavior. For\ninstance, T2D adults could train their self-regulation skill\nby increasing the amount of vegetables they eat daily. Once\nthis behavior has been assimilated into their routine, eating\nmore vegetables won't require much self-regulatory\nresources anymore and PA practice will be easier to initiate.\nStated otherwise, the self-regulation process associated\nwith PA practice is expected to be facilitated by prior self-\nregulatory success related to vegetables consumption.\nThen, breaks within and between self-control tasks, includ-\ning quality sleep and relaxation, are to be planned accord-\ning to the intensity of the self-control demands.\nThe greater the depletion, the longer the resting period\nmust be. As previously mentioned, sleep quality has multi-\nple positive effects on the lives of T2D adults. Regarding\nbrain function, sleep has been shown to play an important\nrole in brain connectivity in the frontal brain regions\n(Verweij et al., 2014), which are considered to play a cen-\ntral role in self-regulation. Furthermore, reduced brain con-\nnectivity is actually considered a potential physiological\nequivalent of ego depletion (Vohs and Baumeister, 2016).\nTherefore, increasing sleep quality could improve the\ncapacity to self-regulate among T2D adults.\n8 Health Psychology Open \nEngaging in PA to diminish T2D-related self-\nregulatory vulnerabilities\nA third way to forestall ego depletion and promote PA par-\nticipation in T2D adults is actually to initiate and sustain\nPA engagement. In fact, engaging in PA regularly has been\nfound to be associated with an increase in brain volume,\nas well as better cognitive functioning, particularly in\nterms of attention, executive functions, and the brain\nregions associated with self-regulation in non-clinical\nengaging in PA regularly has been found to increase exec-\nutive functions in T2D adults (Indelicato, 2009; Vincent,\n2014), which are important for self-regulation. Therefore,\nPA could help counteract the damaging effects of T2D on\nthe brain and as such could diminish the self-regulatory\nvulnerability of T2D adults. In addition, PA has been\nshown to aid in blood glucose regulation, improve well-\nbeing, and diminish some T2D-related symptoms (Colberg\nZanuso et al., 2010). Finally, as indicated further above,\nthe integration of regular PA practice in one's daily rou-\ntine represents an opportunity for self-regulation training.\nWhen PA is performed appropriately, with enough rest\nand chances for success, it can increase the self-regulation\ncapacity and render future self-regulation tasks easier\nForming habits\nAnother strategy to hamper ego depletion and increase PA\nparticipation among T2D adults is converting PA into a\nhabit and making life choices that reduce exposure to temp-\ntations (e.g. going to a gym close to one's workplace or\nchoosing a route between work and home that does not pass\nby one's favorite fast-food restaurant). These are effective\nstrategies to reduce self-control demands (De Ridder et al.,\nhas been suggested that to preserve self-control resources,\npeople benefit from working on automatizing their behav-\niors (Baumeister and Alquist, 2009). When a behavior\nbecomes a habit, the action occurs almost automatically,\nwithout really paying attention to the pros and cons and\nrequiring less decision-making, thus necessitating less self-\ncontrol. T2D adults have many complex decisions to make\ndaily to manage their condition. To lighten this self-regula-\ntion burden, they could attempt to convert as many deci-\nsions as possible into habits. For instance, if one decides to\nincorporate PA practice into his or her daily life, automat-\ning this action could involve finding a parking spot a\n10-minute moderate walk from work and using this same\nparking spot every workday. Eventually, using this parking\nspot and taking this moderate walk will become a habit, and\nno self-control will be necessary.\nUsing planning techniques\nPlanning is another self-regulatory strategy that can facili-\ntate PA participation and limit ego depletion, because the\nexecution of such a strategy does not require self-control\ngoal has been chosen and the intention of acting toward this\ngoal has been set, planning concretizes the idea and helps in\nautomating future decisions related to goal-associated\nbehaviors (Hagger and Luszczynska, 2014). It allows for\ndeliberation and decision-making in advance so that when\nthe time comes to act, one will be able to follow the plan\nautomatically, almost without thinking or making any deci-\nsions, which will lighten the self-regulation burden.\nPlanning techniques facilitate the realization of one's inten-\ntion and favor its translation into action by defining a spe-\ncific context in which the action will take place (when and\nwhere) and the details of said action (how) (Hagger and\nLuszczynska, 2014). Worth noting is that planning tech-\nniques can be learned, practiced, and improved to help peo-\nple develop their self-regulatory capacity (Schwarzer,\n2008). However, one must be cautious when making sev-\neral plans because elaboration requires self-regulatory\nresources, which makes the elaboration of multiple plans\nparticularly taxing (Hagger and Luszczynska, 2014).\nHaving too many plans could hinder the adoption of each\nspecific plan as a result of the increased risk of triggering\nopposing goals (Hagger and Luszczynska, 2014).\nUsing mental contrasting\nAnother self-regulatory technique used to increase PA par-\nticipation while minimizing self-control demands is mental\ncontrasting. This technique consists of contrasting the\nachievement of a goal with the obstacles of the current real-\nshown to support T2D adults in the self-management of\ntheir condition, including PAparticipation (Adriaanse et al.,\n2013). To illustrate this technique, if one has the goal to\nengage in PA for 30minutes per day, he or she could think\nabout four desirable characteristics related to the achieve-\nment of this goal and then think about four current obsta-\ncles to achieving this goal. This technique brings the present\nand the future together, allowing for current obstacles to be\nperceived as being in the way, which forces individuals to\ntake position, according to the perceived feasibility of the\ntask (Oettingen and Gollwitzer, 2010). If the goal is deemed\nachievable, one will feel the need to surmount any obsta-\ncles to realize the goal. If expectations of success are low,\nthe goal is likely to be abandoned. Therefore, mental con-\ntrasting helps distinguish achievable from non-achievable\ngoals, thus preventing the waste of personal resources and\nfocusing on goals having higher chances of success\nMoreover, mental contrasting favors the informed selection\nCastonguay et al. 9\nof a reasonable goal, evaluates its feasibility, and provides\nengagement and energy for its achievement (Oettingen and\nSimply put by Oettingen et al. (2010), \"Mental contrasting\nis a self-regulation strategy to select effective means to an\nend.\" Interestingly, the positive impact of mental contrast-\ning does not require a precise end goal. One can simply\nfocus on the benefits of making progress toward the goal\nand contrast the obstacles hindering this progress (Oettingen\nWorth mentioning is that recent research has demon-\nstrated that the combination of mental contrasting and plan-\nning was associated with greater outcomes in terms of goal\nattainment than each one alone, although it requires self-\ncontrol during the elaboration stage (Hagger and\nommended that those techniques be used together with\ncareful consideration of self-regulatory resource availabil-\nity. More specifically, using mental contrasting in combina-\ntion with planning techniques can lead individuals to (1)\nchoose a goal considered important and achievable (e.g.\nminutes of PA/day); (2) realize the positive outcomes\nassociated with goal completion (e.g. better diabetes-\nrelated symptom management); (3) become aware of the\nobstacles separating the present state from the goal achieve-\nment state (e.g. poor weather and tiredness); (4) plan where,\nwhen, and how they will engage in their activity (e.g. after\nwork, I will go to the 30minute aerobics class on my way\nhome); and (5) elaborate on strategies to overcome poten-\ntial barriers (e.g. I took a class inside so weather will not be\nan issue and if I feel tired, I will adapt the intensity of my\nexercise).\nDistracting and reframing\nDistracting and reframing are also self-regulatory strategies\nthat can be used to increase PA participation while mini-\nmizing ego depletion. When exercising self-control, focus-\ning directly on the demanding task has been shown to\ndecrease performance, while focusing on something else\nincreases it (Alberts et al., 2008). Focusing on the \"cost\" of\nthe activity may add more weight to the impulse one is try-\ning to control by rendering it more tempting (Alberts et al.,\n2008). For instance, if one only concentrates on how diffi-\ncult and demanding his or her aerobics class is, engagement\ntoward achieving the goal could diminish and the tempta-\ntion of leaving class early could become more appealing.\nYet, focusing on anything other than the current activity,\nsuch as completing an intense mental calculation, should\nimprove self-control and engagement toward achieving the\nBy contrast, instead of thinking about anything but the\nactual task requiring self-control (which does not affect the\n\"weight\" of the temptation or goal), one could remember\nthat his or her future exercise-related goal (e.g. to run a\nmarathon, to lose 10 pounds, and to be healthy) has more\nvalue than the temporary pleasure of leaving the aerobics\nclass early. This strategy is called reframing and it refers to\nconsidering the importance of a present desire as secondary\nto a future goal (Magen et al., 2014). Thus, while mental\ncontrasting compares a future goal with current obstacles,\nreframing allows for the comparison of a future goal with a\nmore current, unanticipated one, usually associated with\ntemptation. Reframing could even be integrated as part of\nthe strategies used to overcome potential barriers. For\ninstance, one could tell himself or herself, \"If my friends or\nmy colleagues invite me to have a cocktail after work, I will\nreframe the importance of going to have a cocktail versus\ngoing to my aerobics class.\" In this example, the person\nwould diminish the importance of the immediate goal,\n\"having fun,\" compared to that of the future goal associated\nwith the choice of going to the aerobics class (e.g. control-\nling blood glucose level to feel healthier). In sum, refram-\ning helps one maintain perspective of the reasons for his or\nher actions.\nExamining one's motivation\nThe reasons or motivations behind a behavior also play an\nimportant role in terms of the self-regulation resource exer-\ntion associated with PA practice (Vohs and Baumeister,\n2016). According to the latest version of the SEM, motiva-\ntion is considered one of the fundamental pillars of self-\nregulation (Baumeister and Vohs, 2007). As some authors\nworking with self-determination theory (SDT) have sug-\nquality is important in terms of self-regulation. These\nauthors proposed that when motivated by controlled rea-\nsons (engaging in an activity because of internal or external\npressures, such as avoiding guilt or gaining social approval),\nPA engagement requires more self-regulation resources,\ngiven that the behavior follows internal or external pres-\nsures. By contrast, when PA is sustained by autonomous\nmotives (engaging in an activity for the inherent fun associ-\nated with it or for personally relevant outcomes, such as\nbeing healthy), the behavior does not require self-control\nand could even replenish self-regulation resources. Thus,\nindividuals with T2D would benefit in terms of self-regula-\ntion from engaging in PA for autonomous reasons, such as\nenjoying it or personally valuing its impact on their health.\nWhile examining the effects of each motivational regula-\ntion on a specific outcome (a variable-centered approach to\nmotivation) is acceptable, it is limited (Chemolli and Gagn\u00e9,\n2014), as it does not consider that for a given activity, differ-\nent motivational configurations may be present in an indi-\n1997). Using a person-centered approach with motivational\nprofiles allows for a better overview of individual motiva-\ntional configurations (Pintrich, 2003; Vansteenkiste et al.,\n2009). In line with this proposition, some researchers have\n10 Health Psychology Open \nexamined SDT-based motivational profiles in the PA\ndomain. While most have investigated motivational profiles\nwithin the general adult population (Friederichs et al., 2015;\nhave explored these issues among T2D adults. In brief,\nGourlan et al. (2016) demonstrated that compared to other\nT2D adults, participants presenting a self-determined pro-\nfile (i.e. individuals simultaneously showing higher levels\nof autonomous motivation and lower levels of controlled\nmotivation and amotivation) reported more time spent prac-\nticing PA over a 12-month period. Similarly, Castonguay\nand Miquelon (2017) found that T2D adults presenting a\nself-determined profile reported engaging in PA more fre-\nquently, and they were more likely to adhere to the PA\nguidelines recommended for T2D adults. These results\nhighlight that beyond having a high level of autonomous\nmotivation toward PA, T2D adults must also possess low\nlevels of controlled motivation to perform and maintain PA\npractice.\nImplications and future directions\nThe aim of this review was to highlight the importance of\nconsidering the SEM when it comes to explaining the rate\nof lower PA participation among T2D adults compared to\nadults from the general population. Based on this theoreti-\ncal review, significant research avenues can be proposed.\nThe first research agenda pertains to the verification of the\nhypothesis that states T2D adults are effectively more sus-\nceptible to chronic ego depletion than are adults from the\nnormal population, favoring self-regulatory failure in PA\nengagement. To examine this assumption, a questionnaire\nspecifically assessing day-to-day ego depletion could be\ndeveloped. Such a measure should be adapted to T2D and\noperationalized in line with prior works according to which\nself-regulatory success is mainly characterized by engage-\nment in a behavior despite obstacles, and it is highly\ndependent on sufficient rest (Baumeister and Vohs, 2016;\nwork, to gain a complete perspective of ego depletion (and\nits link to PA participation) among T2D adults and from the\ngeneral population, such a questionnaire should measure\n(1) participants' current self-regulation capacity level\n(Ciarocco et al., 2012) (e.g. \"If I had to engage in PA right\nnow, I would give up easily\"), (2) self-regulation efficiency\n(Neal and Carey, 2005) (e.g. \"Today, to what extent did you\nkeep track of your progress toward your PA goals?\"), and\n(3) overall fatigue (Arbuckle et al., 2009) (e.g. \"Today, to\nwhat extent did you abandoned or give up your PA goals\nbecause you were too tired or lack energy?\").\nUsing this questionnaire, it would be possible to meas-\nure ego depletion in adults with and without T2D (present-\ning no other chronic health problems either) and to compare\nthe results obtained within both populations, controlling for\nsuch key variables as sex, age, health issues, and body mass\nindex. As for PA frequency, it should be measured with\nboth subjective (self-reported) and objective (accelerome-\nter) measures on a daily basis among participants from both\npopulations. The main obstacles participants encounter in\ntheir day-to-day PA participation (e.g. lack of time or facili-\nties and weather conditions) should also be measured. To\nassess these constructs daily over a period of 1 or 2weeks,\nresearchers could use the ecological momentary assess-\nment (also known as the daily diary method or experience\nsampling method). Such a research design would allow for\nthe verification of whether T2D adults tend to be more\nchronically ego depleted, as well as how often they gave up\non their PA participation because of self-regulatory failure.\nBased on the herein work's assumptions, the number of\ntimes T2D adults (who should also be more susceptible ego\ndepletion) abandoned their PA goals because of self-regula-\ntory failure should be higher than the number of adults from\nthe normal population.\nFuture studies should also examine the effects of the\nvulnerability factors associated with ego depletion and PA\nparticipation among T2D adults proposed in the herein\nwork. For instance, using measures of sleep, psychological\ndistress, and stress, researchers could verify the effects of\nsleep quality, depression, anxiety, and stress on ego deple-\ntion, as well as the effect of ego depletion on PA frequency.\nThis investigation could also be realized by means of the\necological momentary assessment over a period of 1 to\n2weeks. Again, PA frequency should be assessed with both\nsubjective (self-reported) and objective (e.g. accelerome-\nter) measures on a daily basis. It would also be important to\nexamine the presence of a direct or indirect link among the\nintensity of symptoms associated with T2D, ego depletion,\nand PA frequency.\nAs to the application of the knowledge presented in the\nherein work into practice, we believe that some propositions\ncould be very useful for initiatives such as \"Exercise is\nMedicine\" (EIM). EIM is a global health initiative managed\nby the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and\nfocuses on encouraging primary care physicians and other\nhealth care providers to include PA when designing treat-\nment plans for patients and referring their patients to EIM\nCredentialed Exercise Programs and Exercise Professionals.\nIndeed, a first step toward the application of the herein sug-\ngestions to practitioners or professionals involved in EIM\ncould consists of advising T2D adults to carefully plan their\nPA practice, at moments when they will have enough\n\"energy\" to exert self-control (e.g. not just before, during, or\nright after another demanding task). Practitioners or profes-\nsionals should also support their patients'autonomy, a factor\nthat has been found to positively influence autonomous\nmotivation as well as glucose control in T2D adults (Julien\nthem \"Which PA would you feel the more confident and\nCastonguay et al. 11\ncomfortable to practice?\" It could also be effective to show\ntheir patients how to recognize signs of self-regulatory fail-\nures or ego depletion, so they can learn to monitor their self-\ncontrol capacity punctually, which could help them find the\nbest time to engage in PA.\nAs outlined by this manuscript, knowledge on self-regula-\ntion capacity, combined with knowledge on T2D manage-\nment, could positively influence PA practice among adults\nwith T2D. As previously mentioned, diabetes education pro-\ngrams, which require T2D adults to learn the extensive details\nof diabetes management, pose a certain demand on self-regu-\nlatory resources, although they cover content expected to pre-\nvent ego depletion (e.g. action planning). It is only once the\nnew information has been mastered that demands on self-\nregulation diminish and that knowledge then contributes to\nself-regulation. Therefore, education programs can foster a\nmore appropriate use of self-regulatory resources and thus\ngreater self-regulatory success. Consequently, we believe dia-\nbetes education programs should incorporate information\nregarding self-regulation into their curriculum and that their\ndirect (i.e. learning techniques that promote self-regulation)\nand indirect (pointing out which behaviors are worth modify-\ning) effects on self-regulatory skills should be evaluated. A\nsimple way to evaluate the impact of these education pro-\ngrams on self-regulatory resources and skills could consist of\na questionnaire assessing self-regulation efficiency (Neal and\nCarey, 2005). Participants could complete such a question-\nnaire before and at the end of the diabetes education program.\nTheir scores could be compared to those of individuals who\ndid not participated in this program.\nIn addition to these suggestions for future research,\nexamining several strategies for preventing self-regulatory\nfailure among T2D adults in a PA participation context,\nsuch as those presented in this work, would be worthwhile,\ngiven there are few examples in the literature of self-regu-\nlation promotion in T2D adults.\nConclusion\nPA engagement requires self-regulation. This is especially\ntrue at the beginning when one first engages in a new PA,\ngiven the energy required to plan and weigh the pros and\ncons associated with the performance of a new behavior\n2010a). T2D adults therefore need to use self-regulation to\nintegrate PA into their lives, which impedes their self-regu-\nlation capacity, at least in the short term (Audiffren and\nAndr\u00e9, 2015). Cautiousness is therefore recommended as to\nthe amount of PA incorporated into the everyday lives of\nindividuals with T2D. A gradual integration, starting with\nPA for as little as 10minutes per day, can have real positive\nis that regular aerobic PA is a core recommendation for\nT2D adults given its crucial role in the management of their\nCautiously integrating PA sessions into one's routine has\nthe potential to render future PA practice easier. In that\nsense, initiating PA increases the possibility of entering a\nloop promoting additional regular PA engagement, self-\nregulation, T2D management, and overall health.\nThe herein work presents avenues to increase PA partici-\npation according to the primary predisposition to self-regu-\nlatory failure in T2D adults. It is recommended that T2D\nadults, as well as their health care providers, consider their\nself-regulation capacity, chronic ego depletion and its impli-\ncations, and daily self-regulatory demands, including those\nassociated with PA participation. T2D and its management\nare complex and demanding. Because failure and dropout\nare not what individuals are looking for in terms of PA par-\nticipation and diabetes management, ensuring one has the\nresources to integrate successfully the required new knowl-\nedge, skills, and behaviors is crucial to their success.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAdriaanse MA, De Ridder DT and Voorneman I (2013) Improving\ndiabetes self-management by mental contrasting.
