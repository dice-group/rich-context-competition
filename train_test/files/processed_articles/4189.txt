The focus is on the extent to which it is\nintegrated with the reintegrative aims of the Probation Service and how this can be\nexplained from a cultural perspective, following the suggestion of Nellis (2014) in his\nearlier efforts to understand the use of EM in Europe. To give a better understanding of\nthe context in which EM is applied, we start with describing the main fluctuations in\nthe scale and composition of the prison population, since it becomes clear from a com-\nparative perspective that the extent to which EM is used, is often related to the need for\nprison capacity (Hucklesby et al., 2016). We continue with discussing the political and\nsocietal background in which EM originated and developed. After describing the dif-\nferent modalities of EM and how often they are used, we explain the reintegrative\napproach of EM in the Netherlands and how this approach is put into practice. It will\nbecome clear that the situation in the Netherlands is characterized particularly by two\nfeatures. The application of EM is highly interwoven with the Probation Service and\nits reintegrative objectives, a characteristic that dominates the organization and use of\nEM to a great extent. Paradoxically, EM is hardly used in the Netherlands as an autono-\nmous (stand-alone) replacement for short prison sentences. In the final section, we will\ntry to explain these peculiarities in the context of a few dominant characteristics of the\nDutch criminal justice system and the general development of community sentences\nand measures.\nThe research on which this contribution is founded was conducted in the context of an\nEU-funded comparative research project involving five jurisdictions, namely: Belgium,\nEngland and Wales, Germany, the Netherlands and Scotland. Because the focus of this\nresearch project is on mapping and exploring the practice of electronic monitoring in the\ndifferent jurisdictions, qualitative research methods were most appropriate. At the initial\nstage of the fieldwork, a number of observations were carried out at different organiza-\ntions involved in the execution of EM, more specifically the Dutch Probation Service,\nthe Transport and Support Service (since 2014, responsible for the installation, replace-\nment and de-installation of equipment) and Tyco (private organization and the operator\nof the monitoring centre of EM in the Netherlands at the time of the research). Between\nJanuary and April 2015 observations were carried out on 18 separate days. The objective\nof the observations was not only to map and investigate the working processes of EM but\nalso to identify key practitioners to be approached for an interview. In total, 34 inter-\nviews were carried out between January and May 2015. Thirty-six respondents were\ninvolved in these interviews; at two occasions two respondents joined the interview. Half\nof the respondents were representatives of either the Dutch Probation Service or the\nAddiction Probation. However, interviews were also carried out with the other organiza-\ntions involved in the operation of EM, namely: the Public Prosecution Service, the judi-\nciary, the Transport and Support Service, the Prison Service and private parties. During\nthe interviews topic lists were used that had been constructed based on a general inter-\nview template and on the observations. The topic lists were revised several times during\nthe course of the data gathering process to include new relevant topics or subtopics that\nwere discovered.\nScale and composition of the Dutch prison population\nTo understand the context in which EM is applied in the Netherlands, it is also important\nto have an idea of the size of the prison population and its main fluctuations in recent\nyears. The highest number of prisoners in 25 years was measured in 2005, with a total\nnumber of 15,206 prisoners (Custodial Institutions Agency, Dienst Justiti\u00eble Inrichtingen\nfor six different categories of prisoners. They came to the conclusion that while the cat-\negory of convicted offenders in prison had already started to stabilize, or even fall, from\n1996 there had been an impressive increase of the other categories of prisoners: prisoners\non remand, mentally ill offenders in penal-psychiatric institutions (TBS-clinics), irregu-\nlar immigrants awaiting deportation (i.e. not for any offence!) and youngsters detained\nfor child protection reasons (i.e. not for any offence either!). The doubling of prisoners\nin remand detention could be explained in particular by the increased detention of small\ndrug smugglers (`body packers'), `repeat'offenders (mainly drug addicts) and foreigners\nwithout valid papers. They explained the `cell explosion' by the increasing intolerance\nand indifference to the problems of these vulnerable groups (Boone and Moerings, 2007:\n51\u00ad76). This conclusion fits nicely to the main conclusions of Downes and Van\nSwaaningen (2007) who focused more on the macro-sociological explanations for the\ngrowing prison rates in the Netherlands in that period. They point, for example, to the\nsevere budget cuts in welfare-provisions in the 1980s that resulted in a situation in which\nsocial problems were no longer solved by social policy, but were referred to the police\nand the criminal justice system (Downes and Van Swaaningen, 2007).\nFigure 1 shows the development in the population of prisoners in the period\ntogether with Sweden and Finland, to the European countries with the lowest prison\nrates, according to the SPACE data of the Council of Europe (corrected by including the\nnumber of persons who are placed under a hospital order, DJI, 2015: 41). What the main\nfactors for this dramatic fall are still hotly debated in the Netherlands. Van Swaaningen\n(2013) and Boone and Van Swaaningen (2013) come to the conclusion that the develop-\nments as explained by Boone and Moerings (2007) are also most influential in explain-\ning the fall of imprisonment rates, but these do not particularly relate to a (reverse of a)\npunitive turn. Others suggest that the diminished need for prison capacity is mainly\ndriven by the reduced result of criminal prosecution of a limited number of serious\noffences (Berghuis, 2015) or the considerable reduction of crime rates (Van Dijk, 2010).\nFor the development of EM, it is important to realise that in the absence of overcrowding\nowing to a shortage of prison cells, no economic drive exists to replace imprisonment by\nelectronic monitoring. On the contrary, the decrease of the Dutch prison population has\ndramatic consequences for the Dutch prison staff, often loudly expressed in the media,\nwhich can easily function as an inhibitory factor for the development of further alterna-\ntives for prison.\nWith regard to the central topic of this study, the composition of this small remaining\nprison population is something to be aware of as well. Compared with other countries,\nthe Netherlands still has a remarkably high proportion of pre-trial detainees amongst the\nrepresented in the Dutch prisons are those serving a very short period of time in prison.\nAs becomes visible in Table 1, 35% of the prisoners that left prison in 2014, stayed in\nprison for a period of less than two weeks. This is much more compared with 2010, when\n26% of the prisoners stayed in prison for less than two weeks. Sixty percent stayed less\nthan one month (compared with 48% in 2010), while 89% left prison within six months.\nduration of less than one month and more than 75% of less than six months. Pre-trial\ndetainees and prisoners serving short sentences are considered as very suitable for EM,\nin the other jurisdictions involved in this study. Why this only partly counts for the\nNetherlands will also be explained in this contribution.\nThe political and societal background of EM in the\nNetherlands\nThe first Dutch media publication on the use of EM in the United States, where it origi-\nnated, came in 1987. In this period, the Dutch government was looking for solutions to\nease prison overcrowding and cell shortage. Against this background, it was no surprise\nthat the possibility of EM was quickly picked up by politicians. In 1988, a working group\nwas installed to explore the potential of electronic house arrest for providing an alterna-\ntive to imprisonment.This working group came to be known as the `Schalken Committee'.\nIn its report, the committee suggested that electronic house arrest could be valuable in\nterms of rehabilitation, provided that it would be combined with an intensive support\nprogram and `meaningful activities' such as schooling or work. It also stated that elec-\ntronic house arrest could have an economizing effect, with the side note that this effect\ncould be reduced by `net-widening' effects, which means including people in the penal\nsystem that otherwise would have been kept out. The committee further advised giving\njudges the exclusive authority for imposing electronic house arrest in order to prevent\narbitrariness. Some other concerns were expressed regarding the intrusiveness of the\nmodality and how continuous control may be interpreted as a sign of distrust towards the\nmonitored person. All in all, the committee did not take a clear position but instead\npointed at the importance of a broad debate on the desirability of electronic house arrest.\nIn response to this report, the Minister of Justice asked in June 1989 for the advice of\nmany organizations involved in the criminal justice system.According toVan Swaaningen\nand Uit Beijerse (2013), only the police was plainly positive as far as EM was applied as\nan alternative to an unconditional prison sentence and not as an alternative to remand.\nThe Probation Service rejected EM altogether, because surveillance with only minimal\nhuman input would be incompatible with the rehabilitative ideal of the Probation Service\n(Van Swaaningen and Uit Beijerse, 2013: 173). The debate culminated in a symposium\nwith 70 experts from several organizations. The majority of the persons present were not\nenthusiastic about the implementation of electronic house arrest either in the context of\ncustody, as an alternative to detention or towards the end of a prison sentence (Van\nFollowing this symposium, the advice was formulated to refrain from electronic house\narrest while other alternatives were being explored. But between 1985 and 1990 the prison\npopulation doubled and the debate on how to cope with these increasing numbers contin-\nproject group sent a recommendation to the Minister of Justice, in which it advised start-\ning a pilot with electronic house arrest in two forms: in combination with a community\nservice order and as an alternative to the last phase of a prison sentence in the context of\n# cases\n# cases\n# cases\n# cases\n# cases\n%\ndetention phasing. This plan was approved and in 1995 a two-year experiment started in\nthe north of the Netherlands. Despite the earlier resistance within the organization, the\nProbation Service became the organization responsible for the implementation of EM.\nThe interviews conducted within the current research make clear that some leading per-\nsons within the organization at the time agreed with cooperation, as they were convinced\nof the fact that a refusal would have major consequences for the organization. Also, Van\nSwaaningen and Uit Beijerse (2013: 175) state that the Probation Service was put under\npressure: if they remained unwilling to start a pilot on EM, the Minister of Justice would\nbe forced to look for other (i.e. private). From that time, the one experiment with EM fol-\nIn 2003, facing a pressing cell shortage, the modality of electronic detention or `home\ndetention' was introduced. Electronic detention could be imposed as a means of execut-\ning an unconditional prison sentence of up to 90 days for offenders without a `security\nrisk' who report themselves to the prison without coercion, so-called self-reporters. As\nopposed to the electronic supervision modalities, as described above, the sole objective\nof electronic detention was to reduce the shortage of prison cells. It was announced in the\n2000 Green Paper `Sanction in perspective' as an alternative for short prison sentences\nthat could annually save the Dutch taxpayer 115 million guilders, but that did not have a\ntronic detention, of which 1998 did not seriously violate the conditions, according to an\nevaluation of the Inspection for Sentencing Implementation. Contrary to the rehabilita-\ntive forms of EM, it was not the Dutch Probation Service that was made responsible for\nthe execution of electronic detention, but the Prison Service of the Department of Justice.\nThe Inspection for Sentencing Implementation was rather positive about the use of the\nelectronic detention modality. Despite the fact that the offenders involved usually\nbelonged to the medium risk category of offenders, actual recidivism was relatively low.\nIt concluded in its inspection report that electronic detention was an effective alternative\nfor a short prison sentence. However, the implementation could be improved (Inspectie\nvoor de sanctietoepassing [Inspection Justice Department], 2007).\nElectronic detention was also heavily criticized. The Council for the Administration\nof Criminal Justice and the Protection of Juveniles emphasized that home detention\nshould always be combined with some form of support or assistance and that the prisoner\nshould have the opportunity to work. Furthermore, the Council stated that the principal\ngoals of home detention in terms of retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation would have\nto be made explicit. This point is also emphasized by Van Swaaningen and Uit Beijerse\n(2013), who are concerned that the main rationale behind any form of EM simply tends\nto be cost reduction. In June 2010, the Minister of Justice decided to end the practice of\nelectronic detention awaiting new legislation that would codify EM as a principal pun-\nishment and as a condition to suspend remand (Van Swaaningen and Uit Beijerse, 2013:\n181). However, this law never came into force, because the need for home detention as a\nsubstitute for prison declined in the context of a cell surplus and the new State Secretary\nof Security and Justice was personally a strong opponent of EM.\ndescribes the intended changes in the prison system aimed at reducing the expenditures\ndetention is presented as one of the important instruments for realizing these cuts and a\nnew Bill on Electronic Detention was proposed in the same period as the Master plan.\nTwo modalities are mentioned. The first is the `backdoor modality' to be applied after\nhalf of the prison sentence has been served but before conditional release. The second is\nthe `front-door modality', which is meant to be a substitution for any prison sentence\nshorter than six months, unless the possibility for electronic detention is explicitly ruled\nout in the verdict. It is estimated that the implementation of electronic detention will\nfacilitate the reduction of existing prison capacity by 2033 places. For juvenile offenders,\nthe aim is to increase the imposition of EM as an alternative to remand (DJI, 2013).\nThe second proposal caused a wave of criticism. In the political arena, the dominant\nopinion was that EM was a far too mild alternative for detention. Therefore, EM was not\nacceptable as an alternative for short prison sentences. Most Advice Committees that\ncommented on the Bill were positive about EM as an alternative for short prison sen-\ntences, but only if it would become an autonomous sentence that could be imposed by the\njudge (courts). More enthusiasm existed for the `back door modality', although several\nconcerns were expressed in relation to this modality as well, in particular concerning the\nreplacement of the existing system of detention phasing by electronic detention and the\nexclusion of certain groups of prisoners of electronic detention as a result of contraindi-\ncations and conditions that would be required (Boone and Van Hattum, 2014; RSJ\n[Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Youth Protection], 2013).\nIn September 2014, the electronic detention Bill was rejected by the Upper House. To\nthe senate, abolishing the existing system of detention phasing was unacceptable and\nelectronic detention did not provide a workable and legally substantiated alternative.\nLegal modalities of EM and numbers\nSince its introduction, the use of EM has been remarkably stable until 2013, despite the\nfact that it can be used in many modalities since the start. However, since the introduc-\ntion of the digital desk (an online tool that enables judges, prosecutors and probation\nofficers to digitally request probation advice on the desirability of EM in a specific\ncase) in 2013, there has been a steady increase in the use of EM. Based on the registra-\ntions at Dutch probation organizations, a total of 2250 electronic tags were connected in\ntions were realized.\nEM can be applied in several legal modalities and by many different actors. Figure 2\nshows that the penitentiary programme that can replace the final phase of a prison sen-\ntence is clearly the most commonly used EM modality (746 times in 2015). Participants\nof a penitentiary programme are monitored by EM for at least one third of the duration\nof the programme. The decision to apply a penitentiary programme is made by the\nProbation Service, in close cooperation with the prison service. Much less use is made of\nEM in the phase of conditional release. This has probably to do with the fact that only a\nminority of the prisoners is conditionally released and special requirements are only\napplied scarcely. In cases where conditional release follows a penitentiary programme it\nis, moreover, not very logical to make use of EM again, because in that case the prisoner\njust has a period of EM behind. EM is increasingly used as a condition for prison leave,\nhowever, although it is not explicitly mentioned as a condition in the law. In the sentenc-\ning phase, EM can be used as a condition of conditional release to monitor a location ban\nor a location order, but this modality was only applied 82 times in the period between\nJanuary\u00adOctober 2015. Incidentally, it is also used as such in the context of a conditional\nhospital order for offenders who cannot be held responsible for their deeds, but this hap-\npens so incidentally that this modality is not included in Figure 2.2 In the current study it\nappeared that judges are still rather reluctant in the Netherlands to apply EM as result of\na lack of knowledge and fear for potential technical failures. This could, on the one hand,\nexplain the growing use since the introduction of the digital desk (as mentioned above),\nand, on the other hand, the underuse of EM in the pre-trial phase, although this use is also\ngrowing in the last two years.\nThe reintegrative approach of EM\nAs is described in the introduction, EM was never accepted as an autonomous replace-\nment of a prison sentence without supervision (stand-alone measure) in the Netherlands.\nThis is a striking difference with, for example, the community service order. This sen-\ntence was codified relatively short after its introduction in the Dutch sentencing system\nas an autonomous sentence that could only be imposed by an independent judge, mainly\nbecause it was considered to be a too severe sentence to apply with less legal guarantees\n(Boone, 2010, 2016). EM is always applied as an additional tool to control the conditions\nof a conditional sentence (in particular a location ban or a location order) to enhance the\ncredibility of such sanctions and enlarge their effectiveness. This character is reflected in\nthe answers our respondents gave to the question regarding what they considered to be\nthe most important objectives of EM. Rather unanimously, respondents with different\nbackgrounds mentioned the reintegrative objectives of EM before the more retributive or\npreventive aims. One of the main objectives of EM is considered to be improving the\nmonitoring of the behaviour of participants. Monitoring is needed to make sure that pro-\nbationers abide by the conditions that are attached to their supervision. Probation officers\nindicate that EM provides an easier and more effective means to monitor whether people\nFigure 2. Number of connections per modality 2015.\nSource: Dutch Probation Service, personal communication, 21 October 2016.\nobey the rules that are set. More specifically, the EM technique allows them to see if\nsomeone is at home during their curfew hours (in case of a location order) and/or if they\nstay away from exclusion zones (in case of a location ban).\nFor people who participate in a penitentiary programme, monitoring is found to be of\nparticular importance. Officially, prisoners who are in such a programme fall under the\nresponsibility of the Prison Service, because they are still in detention, although not in\nthe sense of staying inside a penitentiary institution. Therefore, the conditions attached\nto the programme, such as a curfew, need to be monitored appropriately according to our\nrespondents. One of the respondents articulates this as follows:\nI think it is good to monitor. I also think that it is good to give someone gradually more freedom,\nbecause it is quite something when you come from a closed setting and you go outside. So in\nthat sense it serves as a safeguard . . . I believe it has added value because you can expect that\nwhen the tag is removed no participant will think at 10.30pm, `I should be in a hurry now to be\nat home at 11pm'. And the later at night, the bigger the temptations. Well, the intention is to\nbring someone back into society. (Prison service 1 \u00ad Penitentiary facility administration\nmanager)\nIn the pre-trial phase, an important objective of releasing suspects with EM according to\nseveral respondents is that they can continue their work or education. The same counts\nwhen suspects are caring for children or parents. With EM, they can be released and\ncontinue their normal daily life, but their whereabouts can still be monitored. Judges also\nindicate that EM serves the purpose of enforcing the conditions that are attached to a\nconditional sentence or a conditional release from prison. EM is not perceived as a\nbehavioural condition in itself, but it can enforce other conditions attached to a sentence\nor conditional release (criminal court judge 1). Summarizing, the idea is that by means\nof EM re-offending can be prevented. This is achieved directly by monitoring the behav-\niour of participants and indirectly by giving participants the chance to continue their\nwork or education, while on EM. A structured lifestyle and a paid job are seen by many\nprofessionals as protective factors against crime.\nThe second main objective of EM is realizing behavioural change by providing sup-\nport. EM is part of the supervision that the Probation Service provides and it supports\nthe probation officer in steering the probationer towards changing their behaviour.\nFirst, EM can help the probation officer to set boundaries, to talk about the proba-\ntioner's behaviour and to make them aware of the fact they are being monitored.\nSecond, the emphasis can be shifted towards the own responsibility of the probationer\nand freedoms can be gradually increased. According to probation officers, EM has a\nstrong structuring effect on the life of participants, which was also observed in earlier\nA curfew, monitored by EM, means that someone is not allowed to be out on the street\nat night anymore. Therefore, the day and night rhythm of the participant normalizes and\nthe temptations provided by criminal friends are minimalized. Probation officers see EM\nas a tool that helps them to change the lifestyle and the behaviour of the participant. The\nfinal end result should be a reduction in re-offending. The following quote illustrates the\nvision of probation officers on the role of EM in their work:\n. . . it can offer conditions that you'll need to realize behavioural changes that last when the tag\nis removed. But, I believe, it cannot be a goal in itself, without support, because then you'll\nachieve nothing. When the tag is removed you lose that person, because mentally you have\nchanged nothing. (Probation officer 5)\nChanging the lifestyle of the participant is also achieved by providing an incentive to\npick up work or education, because when the participant does not have any daytime\nactivities, while on curfew, they are only allowed to leave their home for a couple of\nhours per day. Starting a job or education means that the participant can go outside of the\nhouse during the day.\nI: So, you believe that EM can contribute to structuring the life of a person?\nPO: Yes.\nI: How does that work? Can you tell a little bit more about that?\nPO: Yes, because in the first place they will be motivated to start school or a job, because\notherwise they will be at home all day. Well, they don't really like that. So, then they will start\nschool or a job. Because then they will have more free time, with the tag. From there, they will\nbe on the streets with friends less often, they will have to get up early in the morning. Often you\ncall them, around 2pm and they are still lying in bed. But then they will have to get up early and\ngo to school and in the end they go to bed early at night because they are tired. And that helps\na lot. Because they will not be on the streets at night. So, it can contribute to structure and day-\nand-night rhythm. (Probation officer 11)\nHow the reintegrative approach is put into practice\nThe dominance of the reintegrative approach is visible in the way in which EM is organ-\nized. Below, we describe five characteristics of the implementation of EM in the\nNetherlands that make more concrete how the reintegrative approach is put into practice.\nInvolvement of probation officers\nAs stressed before, the Probation Service plays a major role in the implementation of EM\nin the Netherlands. In case EM is considered as a condition to a penitentiary programme,\nan advice of the Probation Service is always taken into account. Also, when EM is opted\nto be applied in another modality, an advisor of the Probation Service advises on the\nappropriateness of EM following a request of the probation officer, prosecutor or judge.\nAfter a positive decision, the case is handed to a probation officer who is responsible for\ncarrying out the feasibility study (see below). When the outcome is positive and the pro-\nbationer is actually tagged, a probation officer is always present during the installation of\nthe equipment. Next, the probation officer takes all the decisions with respect to the\ngranting and withdrawing of liberties. Moreover, in contrast with other jurisdictions\ninvolved in this study, the response to violations is related more to the person than to the\ntype of violation. The circumstances of individuals are taken into consideration during\nthe initial response of probation officers to violations rather than after formal breach\nIndividualized decision-making\nNo categories of offenders are officially excluded from EM. The criteria for qualifying\nfor EM are identical to the criteria for qualifying for a certain modality in which EM can\nbe applied. EM is also applied to juveniles, but much less often than to adults. In the\ninterviews, however, certain contra-indications were mentioned regarding the applica-\ntion of EM. EM is deemed to be inappropriate for people who are seriously addicted or\nwho are suffering from serious psychiatric disorders. With regard to the first group of\npeople, it was explained that when people only live to score drugs it is very difficult for\nthem to comply with the rules that are attached to EM, such as being at home on time.\nAlso, the context of an offence can be a contra-indication. When the (alleged) offence\nhas been committed from the house of the person, for example in case of cyber-crime or\ndrug-dealing, EM is often not recommended by the prosecution service, because it could\neasily enhance the risk on recidivism. This is also the case when the situation at home is\nnot stable or safe, for example when domestic violence occurred or too many people stay\nat the place.\nA characteristic of the practice of EM in the Netherlands is that it is decided on an\nindividual level whether EM is feasible or desirable under certain circumstances. The\nfeasibility study plays an important role in this respect. A feasibility study is carried out\nby means of a home visit to the place where the potential participant wishes to live. It is\ncarried out by the probation officer who most likely will carry out the supervision of the\nparticipant in the later stages of the process. The results of this investigation are reported\nin written form to the advisor, who incorporates it in his final social enquiry report. A\nhome visit takes approximately thirty minutes and in general it is conducted by the pro-\nbation officer alone. Next to technical feasibility, the social circumstances of the place\nare taken into account as well. It is important that the home owner is able to pay the rent\nor mortgage and the electricity bills. Therefore, it is important that no outstanding fines\nor other debts exist, especially not with the energy company because of the risk of losing\nthe house. It is important that the participant will have his own bedroom and place to\nsleep, because he might have to be at home during a considerable time of the day. The\nprobation officer informs the cohabitants about the implications of EM and needs the\nconsent of the principal occupant of the house. Although the feasibility study almost\nnever results in a negative advice, it is considered to be an important part of the decision-\nmaking process, according to our respondents deriving from the probation service.\nAdded value\nThe general approach is that EM should only be added to a supervision order in case this\nenhances the possibility that the offender will comply with the rules. In case a supervi-\nsion order can also be successfully implemented without supervision, EM could be omit-\nted. EM can have added value because it provides the probation officer with information\nthey can use in his or her conversation with the person involved.\nEvery Monday, the national coordinator sends a weekly report of each participant to\nthe supervising probation officer. This report consists of a listing of all the notifications\nin a given week. The probation officers can use the weekly reports in their meetings with\nparticipants. They can, for example, discuss issues such as regularly coming home a\ncouple of minutes too late or problems with charging the tag. Probation officers can also\nconsult the national coordinators in case they would like to have more information gener-\nated by the tag. They can, for example, ask for GPS-trails of a given evening, as is\nexplained by one of the coordinators:\nAnd sometimes probation officers ask us for information. `I'd like to know what he is doing on\nSaturday night, because the local police officer says he is hanging around with his old group.\nCan you check for me where he was the last two Saturday nights between this and that time?'\nWell, we can do that. The probation service can check these data and talk about it with the\nclient. Exchanging information with a third party is something we don't do just like that, but a\nprobation officer can receive every trail, if he wishes so. And they make use of that. (Addiction\nProbation Service 1 \u00ad national coordinator).\nDaily activities\nA well-known metaphor in the Dutch debate on EM is the `beer on the couch', which was\nused by the former State Secretary to express his concern that electronic monitored people\nwould stay at home all day, doing nothing else but drinking beer. This critical approach\ntowards EM as a stand-alone measure without a reintegrative programme, is widely\nshared by our respondents, in particular those who are part of the Probation Service. In\ncase of a penitentiary programme (the most used modality), EM should be combined with\ndaily activities of at least 26 hours per week, this can be work, education or a combination\nof both. These strict requirements do not count for the other modalities, but when a loca-\ntion ban is imposed and the probationer does not have daily activities, he or she has to stay\nat home for 22 hours a day. According to our respondents, these severe restrictions stimu-\nlate people to put more effort in finding a job or other activities. In general, meaningful\ndaily activities are considered to be of utmost importance according to an overwhelming\nmajority of our respondents. Structured, daily activities give satisfaction and positive\nsocial contacts and have as a positive side effect that people have less energy to go on the\nstreets at night. Another valuable aspect according to some of our respondents is that peo-\nple have something to lose, such as a job. Probation officers help probationers to find\nmeaningful activities and to continue with it. Besides daily activities, regular contacts\nexist between the supervisor and the person under supervision. The number of fixed con-\ntact moments depends on the supervision level (see Table 2). The supervision level reflects\nthe risk score given to a probationer. At supervision level 3 they have two fixed contact\nmoments a week, at supervision level 2 one, and at supervision level 1, one talk every two\nweeks. Next to the compulsory meetings, supervisors may join participants to appoint-\nments at the municipality, an employer or a treatment facility.\nPhasing\nAs said, EM is mostly applied at the `back door' of the sentencing process as an execu-\ntion modality of the prison sentence (penitentiary programme) or during the early release\nphase. The dominance of the reintegrative approach is visible in the way EM is imple-\nmented. In the back door stage, increasing the hours of free time is standard practice.\nWhen a participant starts in level 3 the period of the programme is divided in three parts,\nand when the participant behaves well and sticks to the rules they are promoted to the\nnext level after one-third of the programme (see Table 2). Probation officers indicate that\nit is desirable that participants have functioned in level 1 before EM is ended, because\notherwise the gap between the number of free hours in level 2 and total freedom is too\nlarge, although it is possible that the curfew remains in place without being electronically\nmonitored. The probation officers take decisions with regard to increasing freedoms by\nthemselves and this is not discussed with a mandator. To take these decisions, probation\nofficers discuss cases with colleagues. They indicate that they regularly have meetings in\nwhich current cases are discussed and they find it important to always consult a col-\nleague when they are not sure about which decision they should take in a case. The fol-\nlowing quote illustrates this practice:\nWe can promote or degrade someone. So someone goes from level 3 to level 2. It has to be\nagreed by the team, team wide, I cannot decide that on my own, but it is decided during a case\nmeeting. When we promote someone to level two, different freedoms are applied. Then you get\nmore hours. But it can also be the case that someone in a penitentiary programme has to remain\ntagged, but then he enters his second one-third or last one-third and we can phase depending on\nhow someone is doing in the programme. It could be that we decide a participant is given 17\nhours of freedom seven days a week for the last period. But he stays tagged. We don't discuss\nthat with the mandator. That is the framework in which we can decide ourselves. (Probation\nofficer 6).\nThese freedoms concern the number of curfew hours and do not apply to a location\nban. Location bans are generally not changed structurally during the period on probation.\nIncidental changes can be made with regard to both the curfew hours and the location\nban. The contribution to rehabilitation is taken into consideration here. For example,\nthere may be a family event.\nDiscussion: Contextualizing the Dutch approach\nThis contribution demonstrates that the main objective of EM in the Netherlands is to\nenhance the rehabilitative potential of other non-custodial sanctions. The enhance-\nment applies, in particular, to the penitentiary programmes that are applied in the final\nstage of a prison sentence and conditions added to conditional custodial sanctions in\nall stages of the criminal justice process. This characteristic can be explained by the\nearly adoption of EM by some leading figures in the Probation Service. This\nTable 2. Number of hours free time under curfew.\nCurfew level Weekday Weekend\nintegrated or `goal oriented approach', as it is named by the Probation Service itself,\nis visible in all aspects of its application: selection of candidates, the emphasis on\nmeaningful daily activities, the gradual system of awarding more free time and the\nresponse to violations (more related to the person than to the type of violation). If EM\nhad become an instrument that was mainly in hands of the Justice Department, it\ncould easily have formed into another shape. In contrast with the views of probation\nofficers, our respondents of the Justice Department attached much more value to the\npotential of EM to protect victims or society in general. More specifically, they highly\nconsidered the potential of EM to signal to victims and society in general that their\ninterests are taken into account when granting liberties to suspects or offenders. As a\nmatter of fact: respondents of the Justice Department attached much less value to the\nidea that EM should only be applied in case it has `added value' and that it should be\nomitted in case a supervision order could also be successfully implemented without\nEM. The application of EM has already changed in recent years as a consequence of\nthe increasing approval of the point of view of the Justice Department. EM is, for\nexample, applied automatically when liberties are granted, in the form of leave, a\npenitentiary programme or conditional release, to suspects or offenders of high impact\ncrimes. As a consequence, EM is used increasingly as a condition of leave \u00ad as an\ninstrument of the prison service \u00ad without any interference of the Probation Service.\nBecause of these developments, it remains highly uncertain which direction the appli-\ncation of EM will take in the coming years.\nAn important question that arises in the context of the Dutch approach is what can\nexplain the stubborn refusal of EM as an autonomous alternative for short prison sen-\ntences? With a prison population of which 60% stays in prison for less than one month\n(see Table 1), it seems that EM can be extremely useful in this modality. EM as a stand-\nalone sentencing option for less serious offences is common practice in most other coun-\ntries involved in the comparative study this contribution is part of. Also, Sweden, a\ncountry that has a comparable rehabilitative approach towards EM (although embedded\nin a society in which social-democratic values still seem to be much more alive), has\nused EM deliberately to reduce short prison sentence (Nellis and Bungerfeldt, 2013),\nwhile a similar proposal has been firmly rejected again in the Netherlands in 2013. We\ncan think of two major reasons. The most straight forward explanation is that the\nNetherlands does not really need EM to replace prison capacity since its prison popula-\ntion decreased already drastically since 2005 with unemployment of prison staff as a\nresult. The comparative analysis conducted as part of this study (Hucklesby et al., 2016)\nshows that the size of the prison population is strongly connected to the use of EM. It is\ntrue for the Netherlands that the only period in which EM was used as a stand-alone\nalternative for short prison sentences, was between 2003 and 2005 when there was an\nurgent need for prison cells. Even then, this modality was strongly rejected, however, by\ndifferent parts of society and therefore ended despite its relative success. A second expla-\nnation is that EM is accepted in the Netherlands only as a tool to improve resocialization\nof offenders, predominantly in the final stage of their prison sentence, but not as a puni-\ntive sentence in itself. This explanation is in line with the development of other forms of\ncommunity sanctions (e.g. community service orders) and can probably be explained by\nthe intense involvement of the Probation Service in the execution and enforcement of\ncommunity sentences. This has as a side-effect that these sentences were fully framed\ninto the rehabilitative perspective (Boone, 2016). Therefore, EM is seen by the general\npublic and politicians as a soft and non-punitive alternative to imprisonment. It is not\nperceived as `a real sentence'with enough punitive elements to replace prison sentences.\nEM is accepted as a useful extra tool for the Probation Service to monitor probationers\nduring the resocialization process, but not as an autonomous sanction, with punitive as\nwell as rehabilitative characteristics.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: This research project `Creativity and effectiveness in the use of elec-\ntronic monitoring as an alternative to imprisonment in EU member states' (Hucklesby, Beyens,\nBoone, Dunkel, McIvor and Graham, 2016) has been produced with the financial support of the\nCriminal Justice Programme of the European Commission (JUST/2013/JPEN/AG/4510).
