Integrating natural and social\nscience perspectives on the Earth System has been a key aim of a suite of research initiatives over\nthe past decades (e.g. AIMES, IHOPE, International Human Dimensions Program and Future\nEarth). Despite these efforts, key characteristics of the Anthropocene \u00ad human agency, global\nsocial and economic networks and important feedback interactions between human systems and\nplanetary processes \u00ad have not been dynamically represented or otherwise resolved in existing\nEarth System and integrated assessment models.\nCapturing these dynamics in a new generation of Earth System models should allow us to\naddress a number of critical questions about socio-ecological turbulence in the Anthropocene, such\nas: Could transnational social movements such as the push for divestment from fossil fuels tip the\nsocio-economics of carbon emissions? How is climate change science processed in world cultures\nand traditions other than those of the secular West? How are climate tipping events such as in the\nWest Antarctic Ice Sheet interlinked with social and political transitions?\nThe biggest challenge in answering such questions is to understand human activities and social\nstructures as the least predictable, but at present also the most influential component of our planet\nin the Anthropocene. This would, finally, contribute to closing the loop in theory, analysis and\nTo meet this challenge, Earth System analysis requires significant progress in three key areas\nforming the systemic substratum that many pressing, real-world sustainability questions have in\ncommon (Figure 1).\nFirst: How best to represent human agency?\nThere is a long tradition of philosophical, anthropological, sociological and psychological research\non the nature and degree of human agency, i.e. to what extent are humans free to act and what is\nthe structure of the factors that constrain them. This has produced a wide variety of schools of\nthought, ranging from assumptions of substantial freedom of choice to behaviour within social\nnorms and economic rules (Ajzen et al., 1991), to no agency at all (e.g. physics-based theories of\nsocial macrodynamics; Garrett, 2014, 2015). Here, we are primarily motivated to understand how\nthis broad spectrum of (socially and structurally differentiated) human agency and behaviour can\nbe appropriately included and evaluated in Earth System models. Our starting assumption is that\nwe need to go substantially deeper than the common scenario approaches used in current Earth\nSystem modelling, where the dominant underlying social narrative is driven by macroeconomic\noptimization paradigms. These approaches, whilst computationally efficient, will necessarily\nexclude a wide spectrum of behaviours. Consequently, we call for new narratives of global change\nbased on the fundamental dynamics following from different assumptions about human agency,\nand within such analysis for differentiation by social groups.\nSecond: What are the system-level effects of social networks?\nThe social is networked. Social interactions are mediated via information, trade, political and infra-\nstructure networks. Such networks can change over time via adaptive, anticipatory and preference\nformation processes. The dominant existing conceptualizations of Earth System loops \u00ad essentially\nusing the same rigid box-and-arrow wiring diagram developed by the Bretherton Committee\n(NASA, 1988) \u00ad are no longer fit for purpose when the magnitude, direction of flows, and even\ncomposition of the components of the socio-environmental system are changing. Transformative\nphenomena such as the Great Acceleration (Steffen et al., 2015a) cannot be fully understood with-\nout digging into the network structure of the Anthropocene such as the wide-ranging teleconnec-\ntions that emerge in land use change (Seto et al., 2012) and are the essence of digital communication\nbetween people. Earth System analysis needs to recognize that values and norms shape human\nbehaviour, leading to changes in Earth System functioning with feedbacks to behaviours, values,\nand norms. This is a coevolving social-environmental network with an indisputably very rich\nstructure.\nThird: What tipping points and complex dynamics arise from\nsocial-environmental loops?\nEven simple nonlinear systems can surprise us with our mostly linear thinking; even more so\nhighly complex systems such as the Earth's climate. It is to be expected that social-environmental\nnetworks that feature myriad feedback loops will exhibit a wide range of complex behaviours.\nFrom observational records and modelling we know that there are several global-scale tipping ele-\nments in the climate system (Lenton et al., 2008; Schellnhuber et al., 2016). Even richer complex\ndynamics are expected and observed in the social sphere on comparably fast timescales (Bentley\net al., 2014), particularly when interactions in the Anthropocene alter and strengthen feedbacks\nFigure 1. Closing the loop. Understanding and modelling the Anthropocene, the tightly intertwined\nsocial-environmental planetary system that humanity now inhabits, requires addressing human agency,\nsystem-level effects of networks and complex coevolutionary dynamics. The loop sheds light on a\ncoevolutionary view of Earth System dynamics (Schellnhuber, 1998, 1999) in the Anthropocene including\nmultiple development pathways, obstacles (mountains), dangerous domains (spikes) and the sought-after\nsafe and just space for humanity (oasis).\nbetween biogeophysical and social processes. Research and assessments ignoring the loops\nbetween and within these two spheres will inevitably overlook critical phenomena such as emerg-\ning multi-stabilities and tipping points. Models that allow for a systemic view that classifies poten-\ntial pathways and identifies critical parameters, management options, windows of opportunity and\ndilemmas (Heitzig et al., 2016) represent important additions to studies more focused on quantifi-\ncation and prediction of individual trajectories.\nA complex systems view of the Anthropocene\nEffects that may arise even in simple systems due to complex dynamics may be illustrated for the\ncase of a deliberately elementary representation of decarbonization in the energy sector. A dirty\n-emitting) and a clean (e.g. sustainably renewable) energy technology compete while their\nmarket penetration can be influenced by a managing agent through subsidies. This is a hugely\nsimplified case of the more general problem of multiple technologies, multiple economic incentive\nsystems, non-economic values and, particularly, of a large number of interacting networked agents\nwith different objectives and means. However, already this simple case system reveals non-trivial\neffects not usually taken into account in integrated Earth System modelling (Figure 2):\n(i) A rich landscape of possible pathways exists that are sensitive to parameter settings and\ninitial state. The cost-optimal pathway, an example of the imposition of a utility to be opti-\nmized (a very common practice in the analysis of such problems), is but one pathway\ntoward a desired state and gives a rather incomplete picture of the dynamical landscape in\nwhich a manager is to operate. Closing the loop requires socio-ecological systems analysis.\nWhat is more, what is considered `desirable'can differ among networked agents and poten-\ntially lead to conflict. Closing the loop means better inclusion of plurality of worldviews,\npriorities and objectives.\n(ii) Large areas of parameter space form basins of attraction: pathways within these basins\napproach an end state that could have desired properties, but could also be an undesired\nstate, underlining the importance for a manager to understand the structure of the dynami-\ncal landscape. Closing the loop means considering agency that is more multi-dimensional\nthan single-purpose optimization, i.e. to follow broader concepts that allow potential access\nto a larger subset of trajectories.\n(iii) Pathways toward a desired end state do not always initially lead in the direction of this state\nbut can counterintuitively follow less obvious dynamical routes (which presents a problem\nto politics measured as short-term success). Along these lines, some paths that lead to\ndesired end states have to temporarily traverse intermediate states with undesired proper-\nties (the situation must get worse before it will get better). Closing the loop requires a\nbroader temporal perspective which may challenge short-term thinking in governance and\npolicy making.\n(iv) Pathways optimizing a given utility may display the phenomenon of `optimizing to the\nedge', i.e. they tend to follow the edge of domains bordering undesired states, rendering\nthem vulnerable against fluctuations that may tip them into neighbouring, less favourable\ndomains of attraction. Closing the loop informs notions of desirability by explicit consid-\neration of the resilience of trajectories.\nThis illustrative list of phenomena arising even in this simple example suggests that dilemmas in\ngoverning complex systems such as the global human\u00adenvironment system (Heitzig et al., 2016)\nrequire particular insight into three aspects of such dynamic landscapes. First, at issue is to what\nextent human intervention can alter the pathways upon which societies and the environment\ndevelop, i.e. what agency different types of agents have to manoeuvre on the landscape of trajec-\ntories, and what the instruments are to achieve this. Second, since humans act collectively as social\ngroups on environmental processes and these are equally characterized by hierarchical intercon-\nnectedness, the macroscopic effects of coevolving complex networks on dynamic pathways have\nto be explored. And third, the topology of these dynamic landscapes has to be discovered as\nopposed to dissecting thin policy slices \u00ad this will require complex systems analysis, particularly\nregarding separation of domains of attraction, regions with steep gradients and faults, and critical\ndependence on key parameters.\nConclusion\nWe have shown how a simple model that explores trajectories towards decarbonization can pro-\nduce complex behaviour and multiple outcomes, highlighting issues of agency over paths and of\nresulting complexity in the dynamical landscape of accessible paths. As such, this analysis demon-\nstrates the utility of taking a complex systems, coevolutionary approach to dilemmas of the\nAnthropocene. This example highlights the first and third key area identified above. It is to be\nFigure 2. Complex dynamics arising from a conceptual model of decarbonization\ntransformation. Mapping of trajectories in a dynamical system model of an energy market with\ncompeting dirty and clean technologies that can be influenced by subsidizing the clean technology\n(management). Business-as-usual trajectories without management (solid lines) as well as pathways with\nmanagement (dashed lines) are shown. In this example, a market share of the clean technology larger than\n50% is normatively considered as desirable. Background colours indicate state space regions such as the\nsafe operating space (shelter, light green), where trajectories can remain in the desirable domain without\nmanagement, or the region from which the safe operating space can only be reached through desirable\nstates when applying subsidies (glade, dark green), following Heitzig et al. (2016). A typical cost-optimal\npathway as generated by integrated assessment models is indicated by the red line.\nexpected that further complexities would arise by factoring in the collective effects of social net-\nworks on multiple agents and their interactions.\nIf science is to provide robust and useful input into this and other dilemmas that arise as a con-\nsequence of the transition to the Anthropocene, then Earth System models must embrace wherever\npossible these three areas: representation of socially differentiated agency, social-economic net-\nworks and complex coevolutionary dynamics. This would produce useful models of the\nWe see examples of such approaches emerging. For example, theory and models of biogeo-\nphysical dynamics in the Earth System are well established, and recently developed adaptive net-\nwork approaches (Gross and Blasius, 2008) offer a flexible framework for modelling\nsocial-environmental regime shifts and transformations in an emergent and dynamic way without\nstatic prescription of scenarios, including phenomena such as social learning, segregation, norm\nand value change, and group dynamics such as coalition formation (Auer et al., 2015; Schleussner\net al., 2016). Our vision for Earth System analysis calls for a synthesis of these so far disconnected\nphenomena within a complex systems framework.\nThe Paris climate targets (UNFCCC, 2015) and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n(UN SDGs, 2015) are examples of humanity's ambition to remain within a safe operating space at\nthe same time as continuing to increase the wellbeing of the global population. Earth System sci-\nence should play a critical part in this endeavour. To do so it must connect the behaviour and\nimpacts of humans to biophysical processes and seek to understand the resulting very rich dynam-\nics. We have existing tools and approaches to study such phenomena. Such analysis offers signifi-\ncant potential to augment existing models and methodologies and so help humanity chart a course\ntowards a desirable Holocene-like Anthropocene.\n"
