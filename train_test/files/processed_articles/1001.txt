We examined interactions between respondent\neducational level and HMO membership for the following measures: having a\nregular source of care and, in the past year, having had a physician visit, a men-\ntal health visit, a mammogram (women  50 years), an influenza vaccination\n(ages  55 years), or smoking cessation counseling (smokers).\nRESULTS After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, community size, insur-\nance type, physical and mental health status, and smoking, respondents with less\neducation were significantly less likely to have had a physician visit or mental\nhealth visit, mammogram, or influenza vaccination in the past year. Disparities in\nreceipt of preventive care by educational level were smaller among HMO mem-\nbers. Differences in disparities between HMO members and non-HMO members\nreached statistical significance for influenza vaccination and showed a trend for\nmental health visits (P = .06). Moreover, HMO members with less than 12 years\nof education received services at levels comparable to non-HMO members with\nmore education.\nCONCLUSIONS There are appreciable disparities in receipt of preventive care by\neducation among nonelderly insured persons. HMO membership is associated\nwith smaller disparities for some services. Those with the lowest levels of educa-\ntion appeared to benefit the most from HMO membership.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe elimination of disparities in health and health care is a central\ngoal of Healthy People 2010.1 Socioeconomic status and race-eth-\nnicity have been linked to standard measures of health care quality.\nLower socioeconomic status, often measured by years of education com-\npleted, is associated with receiving fewer Papanicolaou smears, mammo-\ngrams,2,3 influenza immunizations,4 and diabetic eye examinations,5 as well\nas later enrollment in prenatal care6 and lower quality ambulatory7 and\nhospital8 care.\nBecause of a population focus and greater reliance on performance assess-\nment, including accountability to accreditation organizations,9,10 health\nmaintenance organizations (HMOs) are potentially positioned to improve\nhealth care to persons of low socioeconomic status and reduce disparities\namong plan members. Yet relatively little is known about the quality of care\nprovided to persons of low socioeconomic status in HMOs or the impact of\nHMOs on disparities. In earlier studies, Ware and colleagues11,12 found that\nlow-income, ill persons fared worse in HMOs than outside HMOs.\nKevin Fiscella, MD, MPH1\nPeter Franks, MD2\nMark P.

Because HMOs can\nuse population-level quality measures and educational\ncampaigns, we hypothesized that we would observe\nsmaller disparities in the delivery of these services by\neducational level among HMO members.\nMETHODS\nData are from the Community Tracking Study (CTS)\na telephone survey of 60,446 persons representing the\nUS housed, noninstitutionalized population. Sixty\ncommunities were randomly selected using stratified\nsampling with probability in proportion to population\nsize to ensure representation of the US population.\nWhile random-digit dialing was used to select most\nhouseholds, a small sample also included households\nwithout telephones; these respondents were provided\ncellular phones for the interviews. Survey data included\nsociodemographic characteristics, health insurance,\nhealth care utilization, health status, and preventive\nhealth services. The number of elderly respondents\nwith Medicare who were enrolled in HMOs could not\nbe determined as a result of an error in the original\nsurvey; analyses for this study were confined to adults\naged 18 to 64 years with insurance (private or Medi-\ncaid). The final response rate for the CTS Household\nrespondents comprised the sample for the study.\nRegular source of care; likelihood of a physician\nvisit, mental health visit, mammogram, or influenza\nvaccination in the past year; and receipt of smoking\ncessation counseling were each modeled as a function\nof HMO membership and patient educational level.\nInteractions by insurance type were also modeled.\nCovariates, described below, were selected using the\nAndersen-Aday behavioral model that identifies predis-\nposing, enabling, and need factors.16\nPrimary Independent Variables\nEducation (Predisposing).

This was based on the\nrespondents' responses to a survey item asking whether\ntheir plan was an HMO or not.\nCovariates\nRace, Ethnicity, Language (Predisposing). The fol-\nlowing 5, mutually exclusive categories were based on\nthe respondent's self-identification and the language in\nwhich the interview was conducted: white; black; His-\npanic, English fluent; Hispanic, non-English fluent; and\nother race.\nDemographic characteristics (predisposing).

Respondents were asked\nwhether they currently smoked, formerly smoked, or\nnever smoked.\nDependent Variables\nWe used standard dichotomous measures for medical,\nmental health, and preventive health services use.\nHaving a Regular Source of Care. This variable\nwas dichotomous (\"Is there a place you usually go when\nyou are sick, or need advice about your health?\") This\nmeasure was also included as an independent covariate\nin analyses of the remaining dependent variables.\nPhysician Visit. This measure was based on a\nrespondent report of at least 1 physician visit in the\npast year.\nMental Health Visit. This measure was based on\nthe respondents report that they had \"seen or talked to\na mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psy-\nchologist, psychiatric nurse, or clinical social worker\"\nin the past year.\nMammography. Respondents were asked whether\nthey had received a mammogram in the past year\nsample).\nInfluenza Vaccination. Respondents were asked\nwhether they had received an influenza vaccination in\nthis subsample).\nSmoking Cessation Counseling. Respondents who\nsmoked were asked whether they had been counseled\nby their physician to quit smoking (adult smokers,\nAnalysis\nWe conducted analyses using the statistical software\npackage SUDAAN19 to account for the complex\ndesign of the CTS Household Survey.15 We compared\nHMO and non-HMO members overall and within\neach educational stratum.\nSeparate logistic regression models were developed\nfor having a usual source of care (all) and receipt in\nthe past year of at least 1 physician visit (all), at least\n1 visit with a mental health professional (all), smoking\ncessation counseling (all smokers), mammography\n(women 50 years and older), and an influenza vaccina-\ntion (all 55 years and older). We assessed for interac-\ntion between HMO status and education and also\nevaluated interactions between HMO status and\nincome, race and ethnicity, and Medicaid insurance.\nTo facilitate ease of interpretation of the size of the\neducation and HMO effects, adjusted predicted mar-\nginal effects were calculated.20\nRESULTS\nThe characteristics of respondents in HMOs and not\nin HMOs are shown in Table 1. In bivariate analyses,\nHMO members were more likely to be younger, male,\nsingle, minority, and more educated, have a higher\nincome, have private insurance as opposed to Medic-\naid, reside in a large metropolitan area, and have bet-\nter physical health status. Higher educational attain-\nment was significantly associated with greater likeli-\nhood of having a usual source of care, a physician\nvisit, mental health visit, mammogram, and influenza\nvaccination (Table 2). Adjustment resulted in loss of\nsignificance for having a usual source of care but had\nlittle effect on educational disparities for the other\nmeasures. Statistically significant differences in the\nlikelihood of having a mental health visit in the last\nyear by educational level increased after adjustment.\nInterestingly, there was no association of education\nwith receipt of smoking cessation advice.\nTable 3 shows crude (bivariate) and adjusted associ-\nations of health care access and use with HMO mem-\nbership. Following adjustment for race-ethnicity-lan-\nguage, age, sex, income, marital status, family size,\ncommunity size, smoking and health status, HMO\nmembers were more likely to have a usual source of\ncare, a physician visit, mammogram, and influenza\nvaccination.\nSignificant interactions were found between HMO\nstatus and educational attainment for influenza vacci-\nnation and smoking; there was evidence of a trend\nTable 1.

Educa-\ntional disparities were narrowed for influenza vaccina-\ntion and mental health visits within HMOs. For smok-\ning cessation counseling, HMO members with less\nthan 12 years of education were more likely to receive\ncounseling than persons with more than 16 years of\neducation. In contrast, there was little difference\namong non-HMO members. A careful review of\nTable 4 shows that in each instance, those with the\nleast education fared better if they were HMO mem-\nbers. This effect was less consistent among those with\nhigher education. With the exception of having a\nusual source of care and smoking cessation counseling;\nhowever, persons with lower educational attainment\ncontinued to fare worse than those with more educa-\ntion even within HMOs.\nThere were few other statistically significant inter-\nactions. Respondents with Medicaid HMO member-\nship had significantly higher likelihood of smoking\ncessation counseling than respondents with Medicaid\nin fee-for-service practices or respondents with private\nHMO or non-HMO coverage. Notably, there were no\nsignificant interactions between HMO membership\nand race-ethnicity (including non-English-fluent His-\npanics) for any of the health care utilization measures,\nsuggesting that HMO membership had no differential\neffect on care for minorities. There was also no inter-\naction between HMO membership and income.\nDISCUSSION\nIn a nationally representative sample of nonelderly,\ninsured adults, we found significant disparities by\nTable 2.

Consistent with previous studies,21-23 we\nfound that HMO membership was associated with an\noverall beneficial effect on care. Most importantly,\nthose with the least education tended to show\nimproved use when in HMOs. In particular, HMO\nmembers with less than 12 years of education received\nservices at levels comparable to non-HMO respon-\ndents with more education. Disparities were signifi-\ncantly smaller for influenza vaccination. The least\neducated smokers enrolled in HMOs reported the\nhighest likelihood of smoking cessation counseling of\nany group. In no instance were educational disparities\nworse in HMOs.\nTo our knowledge, this study is first to examine\nspecifically the impact of HMOs on educational dis-\nparities in health care utilization using nationally rep-\nresentative data. Previously reported results showed an\nabsence of any apparent effect of HMOs on racial and\nethnic disparities4 and an apparently harmful effect on\nhealth outcomes for ill persons of low socioeconomic\nstatus.11-13 Our findings suggest that HMOs might\nhave modest beneficial effects on at least some educa-\ntional disparities in care.\nThese findings should be tempered by the limita-\ntions of the study. All data were based exclusively on\nself-report. There is some inaccuracy in self report of\nHMO membership; among privately insured persons\nin the CTS Household Survey, self-report of HMO\nmembership had a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of\n78%.24 Educational bias in reporting HMO member-\nship alone, however, could not account for these find-\nings. Only if educational bias in reporting HMO\nmembership were correlated with a bias in reporting\nuse of services would such a bias explain these find-\nings. Available evidence suggests that self-report of\nreceipt of preventive services appears to be a sensitive,\nbut not specific, measure of actual receipt of the serv-\nice.25,26 It is important to note that there does not\nappear to be educational bias in reporting.27,28 Thus, it\nappears unlikely that these results are primarily attrib-\nutable to reporting bias.\nOur data are now more than 5 years old. Consider-\nable changes have occurred in managed care during\nthis period.29 The extent to which these findings hold\ntoday is uncertain.\nThese analyses examined a limited array of health\ncare indicators, mostly associated with prevention.\nWe were not able examine educational disparities in\ncare for chronic conditions or health outcomes. Thus,\nour findings and those from previous studies that sug-\ngest HMOs might adversely affect the health status of\npoorer, sicker patients are not directly comparable.11,12\nAlso, although we controlled for differences in the\ncharacteristics of HMO and non-HMO members, it is\npossible that unmeasured characteristics, such as atti-\ntudes about health care, differed between the 2\ngroups.\nOur analyses did not account for differences in\ntypes of HMOs. It is possible that different types of\nHMOs have differing effects on disparities. Our analy-\nses also did not account for HMO profit status. Not-\nTable 4.

Thus, there is ample\nopportunity for quality improvement. HMOs, by\nvirtue of their population focus and reporting through\nthe HEDIS, are better positioned than non-HMO\nplans to address disparities in care. Before they can\nbegin to do so directly, however, they will need to\nbegin collecting race, ethnicity, and education data on\ntheir members and begin stratifying their HEDIS per-\nformance measures by race-ethnicity and educational\nstatus.31 Once determined, these disparities can be tar-\ngeted through quality improvement efforts using vari-\nWe can only speculate about explanations for our\nfindings. It is possible that lower copayments improve\naccess to influenza vaccination within HMOs. It is\nalso possible that HMO physicians are targeting their\nefforts toward members who have higher rates of\nsmoking36 and who are at higher risk because of their\nlower educational status.37 Planwide interventions\nundertaken by HMOs to boost use of influenza immu-\nnizations, such as reminders to patients, might pro-\nvide slightly greater benefit to patients who are less\naware of the potential benefits of these services. At\nleast among the elderly, health literacy might be even\nmore important than educational level in promoting\nuse of preventive care.38 It is possible that HMOs\nmore effectively promote use of these services among\nthis population. Alternatively, given the relatively\nsmall observed effect sizes, it is possible that these\nrepresent chance findings. Replication of these find-\nings using other data sets is needed. Further research\nis also needed to assess the impact of improved pre-\nventive care on disparities in clinically relevant out-\ncomes among persons with low educational levels\nenrolled in HMOs.\nIn summary, our results should help allay concerns\nthat HMOs might have an adverse impact on receipt\nof preventive care by less educated persons. Instead,\nthe results suggest, in some instances, a modest salu-\ntary effect of HMOs. Further progress in addressing\ndisparities in managed care will likely require perform-\nance assessment and quality improvement based on\neducational attainment.31\nTo read commentaries or to post a response to this article, see the online\nversion at http://annfammed/cgi/content/full/1/2/90.\n",
