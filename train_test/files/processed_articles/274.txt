We\naddress this gap by examining substance abuse prevalence\nacross 4 geographic levels, focusing on youth (age 12-17\nyears) and young adults (age 18-25 years). Methods: The\nfrom the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We\nmeasure rurality using a four-tier consolidation of the\n2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes: urban,\nrural-adjacent, rural-large, and rural-small and medium.\nFindings: Rural youth have higher alcohol use and\nmethamphetamine use than urban youth and the more\nrural the area, the higher the use. Rural young adults\nliving in rural-large areas have higher rates of substance\nabuse than their urban peers; those living in the most\nrural areas have nearly twice the rate of methamphetamine\nuse as urban young adults. Rural youth are more likely\nthan urban youth to have engaged in the high-risk\nbehavior of driving under the influence of alcohol or other\nillicit drugs. Conclusions: Higher prevalence rates,\ncoupled with high-risk behavior, place rural youth and\nyoung adults at risk of continued substance use and\nproblems associated with this use. Rural community\ninfrastructure should be enhanced to support substance\nabuse prevention and intervention for these populations.\nThe increased use and impact of\nmethamphetamine (meth) over\nthe past decade have led county law officials\nto declare it America's top drug problem.1\nMeth use started in California several\ndecades ago and has spread steadily eastward, reaching\nhigh levels in a number of states that are largely rural.\nAs a result, meth is often described as a \"rural\nproblem.\"2-4 Depicting meth as a rural issue has helped\nto focus attention on an important problem. This\nshould also renew interest in other substances abused\nin rural America, including alcohol, marijuana, and\ncocaine. These substances are more prevalent than\nmeth, have significant clinical and social impact, and\nare associated with the use of other drugs, particularly\namong youth and younger adults.5\nAlthough there is more research today on rural\nsubstance abuse than 5 or 10 years ago, there is a major\nlimitation to much of this work: it compares all rural\nareas to all urban areas or to different size urban areas.\nBecause substance abuse is a public health problem that\naffects certain high-risk populations more than others, a\npopulation health approach, focusing on differences\namong sub-populations, is appropriate.6 The literature\nis clear that youth and young adults are at higher risk\nof substance abuse than older age groups.7,8 A more\nlimited literature suggests that rural youth and young\nadults may be at higher risk of abuse of some\nsubstances than urban youth and young adults and that\nthis risk varies by size of rural community.9 If we are to\ndevelop effective substance abuse prevention and\nintervention programs for rural youth and young\n1Maine Rural Health Research Center, Muskie School for Public\nService, University of Southern Maine, Portland, Maine.\nThis study was funded under a Cooperative Agreement with the\nfederal Office of Rural Health Policy, Health Resources and Services\nopinions expressed in the paper are the authors' and no\nendorsement by the University of Southern Maine, the Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), or the\nsponsor is intended or should be inferred.

We examine substance use by youth (age\npersons 12 and older. We focus on youth and young\nadults because they have the highest rates of substance\nuse and are the population for whom development of\neffective community intervention programs\n(prevention and treatment) may be most urgent.\nBackground\nPrevalence of Rural Substance Abuse. Our\nunderstanding of substance abuse in Rural America has\nchanged over time. For many years an assumption\npersisted that rural communities were more nurturing\nthan urban areas and offered more protection against\nsubstance abuse.10 Over the last decade, several major\nstudies and reports have found that rather than being a\nsafe haven, rural areas experience significant rates of\nsubstance abuse, although somewhat lower than in\nurban areas.7,10,11 Considering the population as a\nwhole (age 12 years and older), urban areas have higher\nrates than rural areas of alcohol use and abuse and illicit\ndrug use. Rural youth (age 12-17 years), however, have\nhigher rates of alcohol use and binge-drinking and are\nmore likely to use other illicit drugs, except marijuana,\nthan urban youth. Urban young adults (age 18-25 years)\nhave higher rates of alcohol and marijuana use than\nrural young adults. Rural-urban differences in illicit\ndrug use by young adults vary by type of drug.8 The\nliterature is consistent in its findings, but is based on\nbroad rural-urban comparisons. There are suggestions\nwithin this literature of intra-rural variations, but these\nvariations have not been systematically examined.8,9\nGeographical differences in substance abuse, both\nacross regions of the country and within individual\nstates, have been found using the NSDUH survey\nmonth alcohol use among persons 12-20 years was\nhighest in the Northeast (32.3%), and lower in the\nsubstance abuse literature suggests significant variation\nby race and ethnicity, but this variation is generally not\nbroken down further by rurality (Note 1).12\nThe Rural Context of Substance Abuse. Substance\nuse in rural areas is influenced by both location\n(population and proximity to urban areas of influence)\nand place (cultural, demographic, and economic\nfactors).15 Adjacency of rural to urban areas is\nimportant because of the influence that urban areas\nmay have on rural areas in terms of increasing the\nsupply of drugs, providing educational and economic\nopportunities, and promoting cultural influences. (For\nsome types of drugs, trafficking of drugs may be\nbi-directional between smaller and larger rural areas.)\nThe interplay among these factors may place residents\nof adjacent rural areas at relatively more or less risk of\nsubstance abuse than other rural or urban residents.\nThe economic downturn in much of rural America\n(starting with the Farm Crisis of the 1980s) has resulted\nin economic disadvantage and stress that are strongly\nassociated with substance abuse and other social\nproblems (eg, low school and educational attainment,\nunemployment).5,15 The similarity in prevalence of\nsubstance abuse and associated problems in very\neconomically depressed rural areas to economically\ndepressed inner cities led Davidson16 to coin the phrase\n\"America's Rural Ghetto\" (Note 2). Constrained\neconomic opportunities have contributed to an aging of\nrural America, with significant out-migration of\nyounger persons.17 This may result in younger adults\nremaining in rural areas who are less educated and less\nlikely to be working or earning a living wage than their\npeers who moved away, placing the \"stay-at-home\"\ngroup at higher risk for substance abuse.15\nData and Methods\nThe data used in this study come from the 2002,\nHealth, conducted annually by the US Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration, Office of\nApplied Studies. Slightly fewer than 70,000 randomly\nselected individuals, age 12 years and older, are\nsurveyed every year, approximately 17% of whom live\nin rural areas. This survey measures the prevalence and\ncorrelates of alcohol and other drug use in the United\nStates. The sample design supports the development of\nnational, state and regional estimates. The design of the\nNSDUH allowed us to pool multiple consecutive years,\nthereby creating a sufficiently large sample size to\ncompare substance use across the rural-urban\ncontinuum. Pooling the data in this manner to examine\nsubstance abuse across different size rural areas has\nbeen done only on a very limited and occasional basis\nby the Office of Applied Studies at SAMHSA.8,9\nThrough an arrangement with the Office of\nApplied Studies, we were able to access the NSDUH\n. . . . .

The analytic\nfiles contain the full nine-tiered Rural-Urban\nContinuum Codes upon which our analysis is based,\nwhereas the public use files contain a more limited\nclassification structure (ie, large-metropolitan,\nsmall-metropolitan, and non-metropolitan statistical\ncounties).\nMeasuring Rural and Urban Areas. We measure\nrurality using a four-tier consolidation of the 2003\nRural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC). The RUCC\nsubdivide the Office of Management and Budget\nclassification of metro and non-metro counties into 3\nmetro and 6 non-metro groupings (Note 5). This\nscheme distinguishes metropolitan counties by\npopulation size of their metro areas and\nnon-metropolitan counties by the size of their largest\ncities or towns and their proximity to a metro area(s).18\nIn this study we combine the 3 metro groupings into a\nsingle category, referred to as urban, and the 6\nnon-metro groupings into 3 categories, referred to as\nrural, resulting in the following four-tier classification:\nUrban consists of metropolitan counties in metropolitan\nareas of any population size; Rural\u00adAdjacent consists of\nnon-metro counties with any mix of urban and rural\npopulations adjacent to a metro area; Rural\u00adLarge\nconsists of non-metro counties with urban population\nof 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area; and\nRural\u00adMedium/Small consists of non-metro counties\na metro area (medium), as well as non-metro counties\nthat are completely rural or have fewer than 2,500\nurban population, not adjacent to a metro area (small).\nWe consolidated the RUCC in this manner because\nour primary interest was to examine variations in the\nprevalence of substance use across different types of\nrural areas and compare each rural category with the\nurban population (Note 6). We wanted to be able to\nexamine the rural adjacent areas, separate from\nnon-adjacent rural areas, because adjacent areas\ntypically have a higher degree of social and economic\nintegration with the adjoining urban areas19 and have\nlower levels of poverty, higher economic performance,\nand greater in-migration patterns than rural\nnon-adjacent counties.20-22 These factors are likely to\ninfluence the level and patterns of substance abuse.5 We\ncombined medium and small rural county categories\ninto one category given the relatively small sample size\nand relatively low prevalence rates for some substances\nin small rural counties (Note 7).\nAge was examined in terms of 3 categories: youth\nall respondents (age 12 years and older). We focused\nour analysis on youth and young adults because the\nliterature suggests it is these groups that tend to be the\nhigher users of many substances and they, therefore,\nmay be at risk for impaired life chances and prospects\nfrom substance abuse.\nMeasures of Substance Use. We examined the use\nof 6 commonly abused substances: alcohol, marijuana,\ncocaine, inhalants, methamphetamine, and OxyContin.\nThe first 4 substances have long histories of use and\nabuse and significantly impact the lives and well-being\nof those using them. Methamphetamine and OxyContin\nhave emerged more recently and have been widely\nreported to pose significant problems for rural youth\nand young adults. These 6 substances are reported in\nterms of past-year use. Although past month use is a\npreferred measure of recent substance use, the typically\nlower past month prevalence rates limit the sample size\navailable to conduct our analyses. We used past-year\nrather than past-month use to ensure sufficient cell size\nto make comparisons across geographic categories for\nall 6 substances. Two additional measures of alcohol\nuse are reported: binge-drinking (5 drinks on a single\noccasion one or more times in the past month) and\nheavy drinking (participated in binge-drinking 5 or\nmore times in the past month). Finally, we report the\nprevalence of driving under the influence in the past\nyear, in terms of alcohol only and any illicit drug or\nalcohol (illicit drugs include marijuana, cocaine,\ninhalants, hallucinogens [including LSD, PCP, or\nEcstasy], heroin, or non-medical use of\npsychotherapeutics, which include stimulants,\nsedatives, tranquilizers, and pain relievers).\nStudy Sample. Table 1 presents the number of\ngeographic area and by age category.\nAnalysis. To protect the confidentiality of NSDUH\nrespondents (given the need for the full geographic\nidentifier), we developed an arrangement with\nSAMHSA that gave us access to the results of our\nanalyses without having direct access to the full\nanalytic data files. The data runs for the analyses\nreported in this article were conducted by the Research\nTriangle Institute (Research Triangle Park, NC), which\nis under contract to the Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration to maintain the\nNSDUH database using standard suppression criteria\ndeveloped for analysis of the NSDUH. The authors\ndeveloped the analysis plan. File construction and\nprogramming were done jointly by the authors and the\nResearch Triangle Institute. Significance tests are\n. . . . .

Overall, all persons aged 12 years and\nolder living in urban areas report past-year use of\nalcohol, cocaine, and marijuana slightly more often\nthan persons living in rural areas (Table 2). However,\nTable 2.

Rural youth (age\n12-17 years) in all 3 rural categories have higher rates of\npast year use of alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine,\nand inhalants than urban youth. That rural youth use\nalcohol and illicit drugs other than marijuana at higher\nrates than urban youth has been previously\nestablished.10,11 Table 2 confirms and extends these\nfindings: youth in all 3 categories of rural areas use\nthese substances (with the exception of marijuana and\nOxyContin in small/medium rural areas) at greater\nrates than youth in urban areas. Methamphetamine and\n. . . . . Drugs & Alcohol . . . . .\nalcohol use are higher in rural than in urban areas, and\nthe more rural the area, the higher the use. The use of\nmarijuana and cocaine among youth is greatest in large\nrural and rural\u00adadjacent areas. Although comparisons\nwere not statistically significant for inhalant and\nOxyContin use (likely due to small sample size and\nprevalence rates), they show patterns of higher use in\nrural than in urban areas.\nSome, but not all, rural young adults have higher\nalcohol, cocaine, and marijuana use than their urban\npeers (Table 2). Past-year use of each of these\nsubstances is highest in large rural areas, next highest\nin urban areas, lower in rural\u00adadjacent areas, and\nlowest in rural\u00adsmall/medium areas. The difference in\npast-year alcohol use by young adults in rural\u00adlarge\nand in urban areas is statistically significant (P < .05).\nHowever, the differences in past-year cocaine and\nmarijuana use by young adults living in rural-large and\nin urban areas are not statistically significant. In\ncontrast to alcohol, cocaine and marijuana, the use of\nmethamphetamine and OxyContin by young adults\nincreases across the urban-rural continuum with the\nhighest use in small/medium rural areas. These\ndifferences (overall and specific rural-urban\ncomparisons) are statistically significant for\nmethamphetamine but not for OxyContin. (The lack of\nsignificance for OxyContin use may reflect the small\nsample size resulting from OxyContin being included\nas a separate substance for the first time in the 2004\nsurvey.) The depiction of methamphetamine as a\nproblem for rural areas appears to be well founded:\nyoung adults living in the most rural (small/medium)\nTable 3.

Under the data analysis arrangement,\nwe did not have direct access to the data files, limiting\nour ability to conduct follow-up analyses. As a result,\nthis study is an important, but exploratory, analysis of\nintra-rural variation in substance abuse. There are\nseveral limitations to our study, which arise from the\nneed to preserve sufficient cell-size to conduct our\nanalyses. We used a four-tier classification to measure\nrurality. Without the cell-size constraint, we would\nhave explored using multiple categories of urban (eg,\nlarge metropolitan, small metropolitan) and separate\ncategories for rural\u00admedium and rural-small areas.\nAlthough past-month use is a preferred measure of\nrecent substance use, we measured substance-abuse\nprevalence in terms of past-year use to ensure sufficient\ncell size to conduct our analysis. Finally, we were not\nable to explore regional and racial/ethnic differences in\nprevalence within the framework of our analysis\nbecause cell sizes would not be large enough across all\ncomparisons to conduct the analysis.\nDiscussion\nUntil a decade ago the literature suggested, and\npolicymakers assumed, that substance abuse was lower\nin rural than urban populations. Over the last decade,\nresearch has shown that among all ages substance\nabuse is slightly lower in rural than in urban areas and\nthat alcohol and illicit drug use, other than marijuana,\nis higher among rural than urban youth. What was not\nknown was how substance use varied across different\nlevels of rurality and how the use of more powerful and\nincreasingly prevalent drugs, such as OxyContin and\nmethamphetamine, differed between rural and urban\nareas and across different levels of rurality.\nThe data in this study show that rural youth (12-17\nyears) and young adults (18-25 years) have high\nprevalence rates in the use of a number of substances.\nIn general, substance use by youth is highest in\nrural\u00adsmall/medium areas and highest for young\nadults in rural large-non-adjacent areas. While we were\nnot able to explore these differences within the current\nstudy, it is possible to speculate on this pattern. For\nyouth, there may be fewer alternatives for recreation\nand higher sources of stress in the most rural and\nisolated areas. Young adults may move from smaller to\nlarger areas either for college, work, or both. Young\nadults living in rural large-non-adjacent areas may\nhave \"stayed at-home\" and not moved to rural-adjacent\nor urban areas.\nWhile some of the geographic differences reported\nin this study are modest, and the prevalence rates for\nsome substances such as meth are small, these\ndifferences are significant both statistically and from a\npolicy perspective. Overall, these prevalence rates,\ncoupled with high-risk behavior (eg, binge-drinking,\nheavy drinking, and driving under the influence) place\nrural youth and young adults at risk of continued\nsubstance use and substance use-related injuries. Rural\nAmerica's youth and young adults have a substance\nabuse problem that needs to be addressed.\nWhere do we start? The Carsey Institute's recent\nreport \"Substance Abuse in Rural and Small Town\nAmerica\" notes the need for alcohol prevention and\ntreatment programs for rural youth and the need to\nbegin to address the meth problem in rural areas.11 The\nlatter is a daunting challenge given the scarcity of rural\nsubstance abuse prevention and treatment services.\nDeveloping intervention programs for youth alcohol\n. . . . . Drugs & Alcohol . . . . .\nabuse is a logical and important starting place. Alcohol\nuse is, by far, the most commonly abused substance,\noften co-occurs with the use of illicit drugs, and is\ncorrelated with poor school performance and social\nproblems. It is also important to address meth and\nother illicit drug use among rural youth and young\nadults, particularly given the prevalence and likely\nconsequence of use of these substances.\nRather than craft intervention policies and\nprograms one substance at a time, it is important to\nconsider what can be done to enhance the\ninfrastructure of rural communities to support\nsubstance abuse prevention and early intervention for\nrural youth and young adults. One way to do this is by\nadapting best practice and model prevention programs\nto rural areas. While progress has been made in\nidentifying such practices and programs,23 we need to\nunderstand how to implement them and make them\nwork in diverse rural communities. Environmental\nprevention strategies tailored to the unique cultural,\neconomic, and geographic realities of rural\ncommunities should be developed and evaluated.24\nThis is particularly important for the most rural areas,\nwhich have the highest rates of youth alcohol and meth\nuse and young adult meth use. These areas face the\ngreatest challenge, from a law enforcement perspective,\nfrom a prevention perspective, and from a treatment\nperspective, due to low population density, limited\nresources stretched over large geographic areas (Note 8)\nand, in many cases, patterns of poverty,\nunemployment, and declining economic sectors.\nPooling three consecutive years of data with\ndiscrete geographic identifiers enabled us to conduct\nthe intra-rural analysis reported in this article. We\nrecommend that the NSDUH, which is conducted every\nyear, continue to be used in this manner and that the\nfull analytic file with geographic identifiers be made\navailable to other external researchers, with proper\nsafeguards for quality and confidentiality. A number of\nimportant questions should be examined. To what\nextent do observed intra-rural differences in prevalence\nvary by major region of the country? To what extent do\nthey vary by major ethnic and cultural groups? To what\nextent are they explained by underlying demographic\ncharacteristics? What are the intra-rural differences in\nalcohol and co-occurring drug use? To what extent do\nthey vary by major ethnic and cultural group and by\nregion? Understanding regional, ethnic, and\ndemographic differences is critical in developing\nculturally competent intervention programs.\nAddressing the shortage of health and social\nservices in rural America is a long and vexing\nproblem.25,26 Developing a coordinated substance abuse\npolicy in the United States has been a similarly uphill\nstruggle.27 However, the increased attention in policy\nand research circles to both rural health and substance\nabuse suggests that we can begin to address\nsystematically substance abuse by rural youth and\nyoung adults.\nEndnotes\nAmericans/Alaska Natives had the highest past-month\nrates of illicit drug use (12.3%), followed by African\nAsians (3.1%).7 There is significant variation among\ndifferent Hispanic sub-groups. Most of the research on\nsubstance abuse by African Americans has focused on\nalcohol use (which tends to be lower among African\nAmerican youth than other ethnic groups), but tends\nnot to be specific to, or broken down by, rurality.13\nNote 2. Subsequent reports and studies have lent\nsupport to Davidson's conceptualization. A 1994 U.S.\nNews and World Report article28 reported by Conger15\ndescribed Waterloo, Iowa, as one of the rural\ncommunities that include a growing white underclass,\nas identified by having more than 40% of its population\nliving below the poverty line and having high rates of\ncrime, domestic violence, single-headed households,\nand inter-generational poverty.\nNote 3. Our agreement with the Office of Applied\nStudies did not provide us with direct access to the data\nbut to results of data runs on the full analytic file based\non our specifications. Our project liaison at the\nResearch Triangle Institute (SAMHSA's contractor on\nthis project) ran the analyses on the full analytic file\naccording to our specifications.\nNote 4. The public use files have been modified to\nprotect the privacy of respondents by eliminating\nand/or collapsing geographic and other variables that\ncould be used to identify individual respondents and\nrandomly eliminating approximately 12,500 records per\nyear through a sampling sub-step that maintains the\nintegrity of the public use data file.\n(metro) county groupings are (1) counties in metro areas\nof 1 million population or more; (2) counties in metro\nnon-metropolitan (non-metro) groupings are (4) urban\npopulation of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area;\nadjacent to a metro area; (7) urban population of 2,500\nrural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a\n. . . . .

A similar classification was used in a study\nof heavy and binge-drinking using Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System data.29\nNote 7. Exploration of the data revealed that small\nsample size and low prevalence triggered the NSDUH\nsuppression criteria for many of the cells in the analysis\nof small/isolated as well as the medium rural counties.\nAs a result, we were unable to compare differences\nacross these 2 categories of rural counties, leading us to\ncombine the small/isolated and medium rural\ncategories to achieve sufficient cell size to report use of\nthe substances included in this study.\nNote 8. As with health and human services more\ngenerally, there are fewer substance abuse prevention\nand treatment services in rural than in urban areas.13\nReferences\n1. National Association of Counties.
