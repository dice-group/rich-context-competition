Hospital capital investment is important for\npurchasing technology and equipment necessary to serve\npatient needs, such as beds, magnetic resonance imaging,\nand health information technology. Cutbacks in capital\ninvestment by a hospital have negative implications for\npatient outcomes.\nThe great recession in the United States began in December\ncomprise about 58% of US community hospitals,2 rely on\ndebt in the form of bonds and bank loans as the main source\nof capital to fund capital investment. Investor-owned hospi-\ntals (21% of US community hospitals) have more flexibility\nin financing capital investment because in addition to debt,\nthey can raise equity by selling stocks. In 2008, nearly half of\nall non-federal hospitals had put capital projects, including\nfacilities, clinical technology, and information technology, on\nhold or stopped projects in progress.3 Also, the recession\ndeteriorated the value of marketable securities held by hospi-\ntals. Endowment loss due to the recession led hospitals to\ndelay purchase of health IT and cut unprofitable services.4 I\nfocused on California hospitals because their financial data\nwere readily available in detail through the California Office\nof Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD).

The recession was a\npowerful disruption to the national economy and hospitals\nmay have been liquidity constrained during the recession.\nMy study examined whether hospital capital investment was\naffected by liquidity constraints in the following periods:\npre-recession, during the recession, and during the recovery.\nFurthermore, hospital ownership differences in liquidity\nconstraint were addressed. Ownership differences allow for\ndifferent financing mechanisms. Not-for-profit and public\nhospitals do not have access to equity capital while investor-\nowned hospital do, and hence investor-owned hospitals are\nless likely to be liquidity constrained. If the effects of the\nrecession on capital investment were driven by a liquidity\nconstraint, policy changes that mitigate the information\nasymmetry between hospitals and lenders may facilitate\nhospitals to make timely capital investments even when\nmarket conditions are turbulent.\nPrevious Literature\nThe capital structure of a firm is defined as how much of its\ncapital is composed of debt versus equity. The seminal\nModigliani-Miller5 theorem showed that in a perfect capital\nmarket, the value of a firm is independent of its capital struc-\nture. In such a case, the value of a firm only depends on the\npresent value of the expected profits from its assets.\nTherefore, a firm is indifferent between using debt or equity\nto finance its investment.\nFurthermore, in a perfect capital market, the cost of debt\nand the opportunity cost of internal cash are equal; this\nmakes them perfect substitutes and makes the investment\ndecision of a firm independent of its ability to generate cash\nflow.6-8 A perfectly functioning capital market allows a firm\nwith low current cash flow, such as a startup company, to\ninvest by raising equity and debt capital if a firm is expected\nto generate high future profits.\nDeparting from the perfect capital market model, the lit-\nerature on capital market imperfections has explored how\ninformation problems in the capital market constrain the\ninvestment decision of a firm.9-12 Investment models with a\nliquidity constraint hypothesize that when lenders have less\ninformation than a firm regarding the financial performance\nof a firm, the cost of borrowing of a firm may be drastically\nhigher than its opportunity cost of using internal funds. If a\nfirm is liquidity constrained, then its investment should be\nrelated to its cash flow because a firm must rely more on its\ninternal cash to fund investment.\nTheoretical mechanisms through which the recession\naffected hospital capital investment have not been investi-\ngated in the health economics literature. A liquidity constraint\nmay be a mechanism through which the recession affected\nhospital capital investment. The presence of a liquidity con-\nstraint among firms can be empirically tested using the fol-\nlowing method: first, stratify the study population by the\npredictor of liquidity constraint; second, for each stratum\nestimate the effect of a liquidity variable (such as cash flow)\non investment controlling for the theoretical determinant of\ninvestment (Tobin's Q or marginal product of capital).13 A\nsignificant relationship between the liquidity variable and\ninvestment suggests that firms are liquidity constrained.\nPoor hospital cash flow led to cutbacks in hospital invest-\nments in plant and equipment among community hospitals\nliquidity constraints were driving the relationship. Medicare\npayment cuts resulting from the Balance Budget Act of 1997\nand the growth of Health Maintenance Organizations during\nthat time period may have increased the risk of lending to\nhospitals but the study did not address whether hospitals\nwere liquidity constrained.\nLiquidity was strongly related to investment among small\nnon-system hospitals.15 System hospitals are less likely to\nface financing constraints because they can diversify risk by\nearning revenue from a wider range of services. Having\ndiverse revenue sources also means that system hospitals are\nless likely to be affected by the disruptions in service lines or\nfluctuations in the demand for services. Health information\ntechnology systems can lower information asymmetries, but\nat a high fixed cost, which system hospitals can spread out\nover their affiliated hospitals. Also, system hospitals may\nhave greater negotiating power against payers and vendors to\ngenerate higher profit.\nNot-for-profit hospitals often carry large cash reserves to\nsmooth out fluctuations in revenues and expenses and to\nimprove their bond rating from credit rating agencies.16 In\nresponse to a liquidity constraint, a not-for-profit hospital\nmay compensate for its low borrowing limit by using its cash\nreserves in addition to cash flow to internally fund capital\ninvestment or to improve access to debt from the capital mar-\nket. Although cash reserves may improve access to debt,\nholding large cash reserves also has negative welfare impli-\ncations for patients as those funds are tied up in reserves\ninstead of being used for hospital operations.\nMethods\nTheoretical Model\nIn a perfect capital market, the neoclassical model of invest-\nment specifies the capital investment decision of a hospital\nmanager as a dynamic utility maximization problem.6,7 The\nhospital manager maximizes her profits over an infinite time\nhorizon by equating the marginal cost of capital investment\nof today to the expected discounted marginal benefit of capi-\ntal investment in the future. The optimal level of investment\nI measured in dollars, which is normalized by capital stock\nK measured in dollars, is a function of interest rate r (%)\nand marginal product of capital MPK (equation 1).\nNormalizing investment I to investment per dollar of capi-\ntal I K is done by dividing the investment I by capital\nstock K for hospital i at time t . Marginal product of\ncapital MPK is the change in hospital output in dollars from\na unit change in capital stock K :\nI\nK\nit\nit\nit it\n= + +\n+ +\n  \nWhen lenders do not have full information regarding the\nability of a hospital to service its debt, lenders may place a\nliquidity constraint on the hospital by limiting the amount it\ncan borrow, raising the cost of borrowing, or requiring cash\nreserves as collateral. A liquidity-constrained hospital, unable\nto borrow debt, may fund capital investments internally with\ncash. Hence, the capital investment decision by a liquidity-\nconstrained hospital should be related to its cash flow CF\n.12,17 Cash flow measures the net cash inflows and outflows\nfrom hospital operations. Cash inflows include payments\nfrom payers and donations, and cash outflows include cash\nexpensed to pay for labor and supplies. In addition to cash\nflow, liquid asset LA can be used to fund investment directly\nor used as a collateral to lower the cost of debt. Liquid asset\nincludes cash reserves and marketable securities separate\nfrom cash flow. Liquid asset should also be linked to invest-\nment in the presence of liquidity constraint (equation 2):\nI\nK\nit\nit\nit it t t\n= + + + +\n+ +\n    \nEmpirical Model\nI specified the empirical model based on the investment\nmodel with liquidity constraint.

However, the marginal product\nof capital was unobserved in the data, thus substituted with\nthe average product of capital APK , which was specified as\noperating revenue per capital. The substitution of marginal\nproduct of capital with average product of capital is consis-\ntent with the literature.17\nI hypothesized that (1) hospitals were not liquidity con-\nstrained before the recession, (2) hospitals were liquidity\nconstrained during the recession, and (3) hospitals were not\nliquidity constrained during the recovery. The recession may\nhave contributed to the information asymmetry between hos-\npitals and lenders because lenders expected the demand for\nhospital services to fall like the rest of the economy, whereas\nthe demand for hospital services may actually have been less\naffected. The Medicare population was probably not affected\nby the weak labor market and the loss of private insurance\nmight have been partially offset by the Consolidated Omnibus\nBudget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).\nInformation problem during the recession may have dis-\ncouraged capital investment by hospitals because lenders\nlimited how much hospitals can borrow, placing a liquidity\nconstraint. When unable to borrow debt due to liquidity con-\nstraint, hospitals may respond by using their own internal\ncash to fund investment.\nAlternatively, finding a significant relationship between\ncash flow and investment in the pre-recession or recovery\nperiod suggests that hospitals were chronically liquidity con-\nstrained, rather than the recession having an effect. Such find-\ning should raise further concerns about the inefficiencies in the\ncapital market that are preventing hospitals from investing.\nFurthermore, finding a null relationship between cash flow\nand investment during the recession suggests that hospitals\nhad access to a well-functioning capital market. Government\nstimulus during the recession may have encouraged lending to\nhospitals. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of\n2009 (ARRA) promoted banks to lend to the not-for-profit and\npublic sectors by expanding the definition of bank-qualified\nbonds. Bank-qualified bonds allow issuers to sell bonds\ndirectly to banks that reduce issuance costs. The banks who\npurchase bank-qualified bonds benefit from tax incentives.\nqualified bonds to fund new capital projects.18,19\nI anticipated average product of capital to have a signifi-\ncant positive effect because increasing profitability of capital\nshould be related to higher capital investment. The coeffi-\ncient on average product of capital captures the profit-seek-\ning behavior of hospitals. The investment model describes\nhow hospital investment decision is motivated solely by its\nprofit-maximizing objective. This gross simplification\nignores how hospitals may seek to provide high-quality care\nfor their patients. The omission of quality and the resulting\nendogeneity problem is further discussed in the identifica-\ntion strategy section.\nI tested the 3 hypotheses by stratifying the study popula-\ntion into pre-recession, during-recession, and during-recov-\nery periods, then for each period estimating the empirical\nmodel. Significant and positive beta coefficients for either or\nboth cash flow and liquid asset are evidence of liquidity con-\nstraint in the given period.\nnationally, the effect of the recession may have lagged for the\nhospital industry. A drop in employer-sponsored insurance\nwould have lagged behind the recession because COBRA\nallows people who lost their jobs to continue their coverage.\nsion period. Year 2007 was excluded because it was a transi-\ntion period with 11 months out of the year not in recession.\nOwnership differences may contribute to liquidity constraint.\nNot-for-profit hospitals and public hospitals are more likely\nto be liquidity constrained than investor-owned hospitals\nbecause they cannot raise equity. During the recession, I fur-\nther stratified hospitals by ownership and tested for liquidity\nconstraint.\nIdentification Strategy\nThe estimation model (equation 3) contains endogenous\nregressors and unobserved hospital effects that bias the ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS) estimates. The regressors cash flow,\nliquid asset, average product of capital, and interest rate are\nendogenous to unobserved shocks related to capital invest-\nment and the direction of bias can be positive or negative.\nFor example, the service mission of a hospital to improve the\nhealth of the community exerts a negative bias on the effect\nof cash flow. A service activity with a quality objective rather\nthan a profit objective is negatively correlated with cash\nflow. At the same time, investment is positively correlated\nwith service activity because equipment and facilities are\nneeded to carry out the service activity. In contrast, the repu-\ntation of a hospital exerts a positive bias on the effect of cash\nflow. Hospitals with a good reputation will attract patients;\nthus, reputation is positively correlated with cash flow.\nSimultaneously, hospitals invest more to maintain a good\nreputation and thus reputation is positively correlated with\ninvestment. Unobserved hospital effects, such as the perfor-\nmance of the hospital manager, may affect both cash flow\nand investment. OSHPD provides facility-level financial\ndata. System-level financial information and change in sys-\ntem affiliation were not observed. System affiliation is likely\ncorrelated with capital investment and other regressors.\nHospital fixed effects absorb the time invariant system\neffects. Omitted time-varying system effects may bias the\nOLS estimates. The system generalized method of moments\n(system GMM) estimator was used to address the fixed\neffects and endogeneity issues in the estimation model.\nExogeneity of instruments. System GMM estimates a system\nof levels and differenced equations using the lags and lag\ndifferences of the endogenous regressors as instruments for\nthe endogenous regressors. When the endogenous regressor\nis persistent, lags and lag differences of the endogenous\nregressors sufficiently removed from the contemporaneous\nerror term are exogenous. If the error term t is\nAutoregressive(p) in the levels equation, x a p\nt a\n-  >\n, is\nused to instrument for the endogenous regressors xt . In the\ndifferenced equation, x a p\nt a\n- +\n( )  >\n, is used to instrument\nfor the endogenous regressors xt .20 System GMM com-\nbines the moment conditions for the differenced equation\nwith the moment conditions for the levels equation.21 Com-\npared with estimating the differenced equation alone, system\nGMM improves the finite sample properties regarding the\nbias and root mean squared error.\nSystem GMM requires strong assumptions regarding the\nlags and lag differences of the endogenous regressors.\nValidity of the assumptions is rigorously tested in an appen-\ndix which is available on request.Aprevious study using sys-\ntem GMM identification strategy for estimating hospital\nproductivity yielded similar results to alternative identifica-\ntion strategies for estimating production functions.22 System\nGMM producing similar results to alternative identification\nstrategies provides support for the validity of using system\nGMM with hospital financial data.\nDecomposition\nThe Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique was used to\ndecompose the change in hospital capital investment between\nthe pre-recession and during-recession periods.23,24 Hospital\nobservations from 2006 were selected as the pre-recession\ngroup. Observations from 2009 were selected as the reces-\nsion group. Using the GMM coefficient estimates from the\npre-recession period and during-recession periods, capital\ninvestment was predicted in term of dollars and then sepa-\nrated into the following components.\nThe effect of the recession due to the change in the esti-\nmated coefficients was captured by the coefficient effect\n( )\n \nrecession pre recession recession\nX\n- - . Difference in investment\ndue to the change in the explanatory variables was captured\nby the change in the variable effect\n( )\nrecession pre recession pre rcession\n- - -\n . The effect of the\nrecession due to the difference in the intercepts was captured\nby the residual effect. Standard errors for the decomposition\nwere estimated by block bootstrapping the hospitals.\nData\nOSHPD collects financial data from about 450 not-for-profit\nand investor-owned hospitals in California each year.25\nParticipating hospitals report detailed financial information\nfrom balance sheets and income statements. OSHPD data\ninclude all non-federal California hospitals. The study panel\nwas limited to short-term general acute-care hospitals\nwere excluded because they do not report comparable finan-\ncial data. Hospitals with reporting days less or greater than\n365 (less or greater than 366 for leap years) were excluded.\nmissing and out-of-range values (negative numbers in capital\nstock or investment) were excluded because they are likely\nto be data entry errors. The remaining 298 hospitals with an\nunbalanced panel of 2557 hospital-year observations were\nanalyzed. Dollar amounts were adjusted to 2011 dollars\nusing the GDP deflator.26\nMeasures. Cash flow measures the net cash inflows and out-\nflows from hospital operations at the end of the reporting\nperiod. Liquid asset LA includes cash reserves and\nmarketable securities measured at the beginning of the\nreporting period, which excludes cash flow earned in the cur-\nrent reporting period. Liquid asset includes cash and market-\nable securities reported as current assets; it excludes cash and\nmarketable securities whose use is limited. Interest rate r for\nhospital i at time t was not observed in the data. Instead,\ninterest rate on outstanding long-term debt was observed.\nThe average interest rate on long-term debt was used a proxy\nfor interest rate. Average product of capital was measured as\noperating revenue divided by capital at the end of the report-\ning period.\nResults\nThe study data are summarized in Table 1. Pooling across\nownership types, hospitals had a mean annual capital invest-\ndollars, and investment per capital ratio of 0.098. Ownership\ndifferences showed that investor-owned hospital invested\nrelatively more than others with a higher investment per cap-\nital ratio. Investor-owned hospitals also generated greater\nreturns from a dollar of capital with a higher average product\nof capital than others. Investor-owned hospitals had the\nsmallest capital stock, about a third of the size of not-for-\nprofit hospitals and two thirds of the size of public hospitals.\nThe study hospitals comprised 1549 not-for-profit hospitals,\nFigure 2 shows the investment time trend separately\nplotted for hospitals with high cash flow and low cash\nflow. For each hospital, I calculated its mean cash flow in\nthe pre-recession period. Then I classified the hospitals\ninto high\u00ad or low\u00adcash flow group based on whether their\npre-recession mean cash flow was above or below the\nmedian. Assuming the lack of liquidity constraint, trends\nin investment prior to the recession should not vary by\ncash flow status. During the recession, I expected hospitals\nto be liquidity constrained. When liquidity constrained,\nhigh\u00adcash flow hospitals should invest more than low\u00ad\ncash flow hospitals because hospitals are limited in how\nmuch they can borrow and must use their own cash flow to\nfund investment. Time trend in Figure 2 shows that up to\n2008, trends in investment between the 2 groups track\nclosely; then the low\u00adcash flow hospitals experienced a\npared with the high\u00adcash flow hospitals. The time trend is\nconsistent with the expectation, showing that high\u00adcash\nflow hospitals invested more than low\u00adcash flow hospitals\nduring the recession.\nTable 1.

In addition to the GMM estimates, fixed effects\nregression estimates are reported for comparison. Pre-\nrecession period estimates are presented in Table 2. Cash\nflow and liquid asset were not significantly related to\ninvestment per capital for all hospitals, suggesting that hos-\npitals were not liquidity constrained in the pre-recession\nperiod. The GMM estimate for average product of capital at\ninvestment per capital was significantly related to the prof-\nitability of capital. The GMM estimate for average product\nof capital was smaller than the fixed effects estimate\nformance was positively biasing APK .\nRecession period estimates are presented in Table 3. Cash\nflow was significantly related to investment per capital, sug-\ngesting that hospitals were liquidity constrained during the\nrecession. Increasing cash flow increased investment per\ncapital.

The average product of capi-\ntal coefficient during the recession was smaller than the pre-\nrecession estimate, suggesting that investment decision was\nless sensitive to the profitability of capital during the reces-\nsion. Liquidity-constrained hospitals would be limited in\ntheir borrowing, thus unable to invest even when there are\nprofitable investment opportunities.\nRecovery period estimates are presented in Table 4.

In each of the tables presented, the Hansen\ntest of joint validity of the instruments failed to reject the\nnull, showing no evidence that the instruments were not\nexogenous. Also, over-instrumenting did not appear to be a\nproblem, as the Hansen test statistic was reasonably far from\n1.00.27 The Arellano-Bond test for Autoregressive (2) in first\ndifferences failed to reject the null, showing no evidence of\nAutoregressive (1) auto-correlation in the levels equation.\nTable 6 summarizes the decomposed change in hospital\ncapital investment between pre-recession and during reces-\nsion. The residual recession effect is the change in baseline\ncapital investment between the 2 periods. The residual reces-\nsion effect absorbs the change in capital investment unex-\nplained by the predictors in the empirical model. The residual\nrecession effect was not significant.\nDuring the recession, hospital investment was related to\ncash flow, whereas in pre-recession it was not. The cash flow\ncoefficient effect increased capital investment by $2.45*(P <\n.05) million. Change in cash flow between the pre-recession\ngroup and the recession group was not statistically different.\nThe average product of capital coefficient effect, change in\naverage product of capital, interest rate coefficient effect,\nand change in interest rate were not statistically different\nbetween the pre-recession and the recession groups.\nAlternative Specifications\nI investigated the robustness of my results against alternative\nspecifications of the empirical model. The effect of cash flow\nmay vary by the level of liquid asset. The interaction term for\ncash flow and liquid asset captures the substitution effect\nbetween the two. System GMM estimates for the pre-reces-\nsion, recession, and recovery periods including the interac-\ntion term showed consistent results with hospitals being\nsensitive to cash flow only during the recession period. The\ninteraction term was not significant in the 3 periods.\nInvestment may be persistent over time. A dynamic speci-\nfication included the lagged dependent and independent vari-\nables to test for the presence of an autoregressive (1) error\ncomponent. The coefficient on the lagged dependent variable\nwas not significant, thus failing to reject the absence of serial\ncorrelation in the error term.\nThe theoretical model and the subsequent empirical\nmodel do not explicitly include debt as a predictor of capital\ninvestment. However, debt may be correlated with interest\nrate, because lenders may evaluate existing debt and interest\nexpense. Debt is likely to be correlated with capital invest-\nment because it is a funding source for capital investment.\nIncluding debt as a predictor in the empirical model did not\nchange the coefficient estimates for cash flow and average\nproduct of capital. Also, debt was not a significant\npredictor.\nInterest rate in the empirical model was defined as the\naverage interest rate on long-term debt.

Alternatively, I tested the average\ninterest expense per debt as a proxy for interest rate and it\nwas not a significant predictor. The limitation with using\naverage interest expense per debt was that some hospitals\nhad interest expenses greater than debt, which made the ratio\nimplausible.\nOSHPD data capture limited use cash and limited use\nsecurities. Limited use securities, specifically stocks and\nbonds, are mainly invested in mutual funds or exchange-\ntraded funds, which can be liquidated within a week. The\nrestrictions on limited use assets may be set internally by\nthe board rather than an external agency; hence, hospitals\nmay have discretion over its limited use asset to fund\ninvestment. However, only about 30% of the study hospi-\ntals reported having limited use assets, most of them being\nnot-for-profits. Adding limited use cash and limited use\nsecurities to the liquid asset variable did not change the\nestimation results for the pre-recession, during, and recov-\nery periods.\nConclusion\nDuring the recession, capital investment of California not-\nfor-profit and public hospitals was linked to their cash flow.\nMy findings suggest that these hospitals were liquidity con-\nstrained during the recession. The fixed effect estimates that\nsuffer from an endogeneity problem underestimated the rela-\ntionship between cash flow and investment compared with\nthe system GMM estimates. The negative bias on cash flow\nmay be due to the unobserved quality objective of the hospi-\ntal. Cash flow and liquid asset (cash reserves and marketable\nsecurities) measure unrestricted assets that are not limited by\nexternal restrictions. These variables should capture the deci-\nsion of hospital managers, rather than external influences, on\nhow to allocate their cash flow and liquid asset to fund capi-\ntal investment under liquidity constraint.\nThe California hospital market is unique because it has a\nhigh managed care penetration and dominant multi-hospital\nsystems, specifically Hospital Corporation of America\n(HCA), Sutter, and Dignity. Therefore, findings from my\nstudy may not be reflective of other state markets. My study\nexcluded Kaiser Permanente hospitals, which are a major\ncompetitor in California, and this exclusion thereby limits\nthe generalizability of my findings within California. For\nmulti-hospital systems, system-level financial data were not\navailable; thus, my findings are limited to describing hospi-\ntal-level investment behavior.\nA liquidity constraint arises when lenders are uncertain\nabout the ability of hospitals to service their debt and conse-\nquently limit how much hospitals can borrow. If there had\nbeen a perfectly functioning capital market, cash flow would\nnot have been related to investment. A liquidity constraint\ndrives hospitals to generate large cash flows to fund capital\ninvestment rather than spending on expenses related to the\nprovision of health care. Hospital management can reduce\nexpenses by cutting hospital staff, delaying wage payments,\nand closing service lines. Trading off operating expenses for\ncapital investment may have adverse short-run consequences.\nAreduction in hospital staff may worsen patient outcomes by\nincreasing provider error.\nNot-for-profit hospitals hold a significantly greater pro-\nportion of asset as unrestricted cash and marketable securi-\nties than investor-owned hospitals.28 Not-for-profit hospitals\ncannot raise equity capital, which gives them less flexibility\nwhen raising capital compared with investor-owned hospi-\ntals. Because of this limitation, credit rating agencies empha-\nsize days-cash-on-hand, which is the amount of cash on hand\nto meet operating expenses, when rating not-for-profit hospi-\ntals.29,30 Having more cash and marketable securities help\nnot-for-profit hospitals improve their bond ratings and lower\nthe cost of debt. In contrast, investor-owned hospitals are\nless concerned about using internal cash to fund investments\nor improving their credit rating because of their broader\naccess to external funds. It is important to note that agency\nTable 6. All Hospitals Decomposition of Change in Expected Investment due to the Recession.\nNote. Millions of 2011 dollars. CI = confidence interval.\nproblems associated with excess cash may influence invest-\nment behavior of hospitals, which would obscure the rela-\ntionship between cash and investment. Among not-for-profit\nfirms, excess cash was not associated with increased invest-\nment, but with higher manager compensation.31\nThe effect of cash flow on investment varied by hospital\nownership. During the recession, capital investment of not-\nfor-profit hospitals was sensitive to cash flow; capital invest-\nment of public hospitals was sensitive to liquid asset. But\ncapital investment of investor-owned hospitals was not\nrelated to either. These findings suggest that during the reces-\nsion, not-for-profit and public hospitals were liquidity con-\nstrained. For investor-owned hospitals, cash flow and liquid\nasset were not significantly linked to capital investment, sug-\ngesting no evidence of liquidity constraint. Investor-owned\nhospitals can raise equity to fund capital investments,\nwhereas not-for-profit and public hospitals cannot. This\ninstitutional difference makes investor-owned hospitals less\nsusceptible to liquidity constraint.\nDecomposing the change in hospital capital investment\nbetween pre-recession and during recession did not reveal a\nsignificant drop in capital investment. The average decrease\nin capital investment is the change in capital investment\nwhile holding constant the effects of cash flow and other pre-\ndictors in the empirical model. This change in capital invest-\nment unexplained by the model, or the residual effect,\nincludes the net of the pre-recession year fixed effect and the\nduring-recession fixed effect. Thus, any policy changes\naffecting capital investment is captured by the residual effect.\nHowever, the large uncertainty around the estimated residual\neffect makes it unclear how policy changes, such as the gov-\nernment stimulus funds going to hospitals through ARRA,\naffected hospital capital investment.\nHospitals responded to the recession by using cash flow\nto offset the effect of restricted borrowing. Capital invest-\nment was more sensitive to cash flow during the recession,\nwhich increased capital investment by $2.45* (P < .05) mil-\nlion, other things equal. The cash flow effect isolates the\nchange in capital investment due to the change in coefficient\nestimate for the pre-recession group and the recession group.\nThe interval estimates in Table 6 reflect two sources of\nuncertainty: (1) uncertainty around the coefficient estimates\nand (2) uncertainty around the variables. Using bootstrap\nsampling, for each sample drawn I estimated the empirical\nmodel coefficients and then inserted them into the Blinder-\nOaxaca equation for decomposition. Low precision in the\ncoefficient effect is likely due to large variations in the beta\ncoefficient among the bootstrap samples. Stratifying the pop-\nulation by ownership did not improve the precision of the\nbootstrap confidence intervals. In Tables 2 and 3, the coeffi-\ncient on liquid asset was significantly positive in the pre-\nrecession period, and then negative but not significant during\nthe recession. I suspect that the relationship between liquid\nasset and investment was mixed because hospitals may be\nholding it as a collateral for debt rather than using it to\ndirectly fund investment. Average product of capital was sig-\nnificantly positive in the pre-recession period and signifi-\ncantly positive during the recession; the coefficient did not\nchange between periods would yield an estimate close to\nzero. Interest rate suffered from measurement noise, which\nmay explain the wide uncertainty around its coefficient\neffect.\nThe unexpected estimation results for liquid asset chal-\nlenge the hypothesized relationship between liquid asset and\ncapital investment. During the recession, the coefficient on\nliquid asset was negative and not significant. The negative\nestimate for liquid asset, where a positive estimate was\nexpected, raises the question of multi-collinearity due to the\ncorrelation between cash flow and liquid asset. In the pooled\ndata, the Pearson correlation coefficient between cash flow\nand liquid asset was 0.11; during the recession it was .24.\nBoth coefficients suggest a low correlation between the 2\nvariables. Removing 1 of the 2 variables from the estimation\nmodel did not change the result for the other. For the reces-\nsion period, estimating the investment model without liquid\nasset resulted in a positive and significant cash flow coeffi-\ncient; estimating the investment model without cash flow\nresulted in a negative but not significant liquid asset coeffi-\ncient. Overall, the robustness checks did not provide strong\nevidence of multi-collinearity.\nIf the imprecise coefficient estimate for liquid asset is\nunbiased and truly negative, a negative relationship between\nliquid asset and capital investment is nonetheless counterin-\ntuitive. Fluctuations in operating revenue and costs during\nthe recession may have prompted hospitals to build its liquid\nassets at the expense of cutting investments. But it is not\nobvious why increasing liquid asset decreases investment\nwhen increasing cash flow increases investment, given that\nthey are both internal funds that can be used at discretion by\nhospitals.\nBecause the negative coefficient on liquid asset was not\nsignificant, I am more comfortable interpreting the coeffi-\ncient as a null instead of a negative. A null relationship\nbetween liquid asset and capital investment is also inconsis-\ntent with expectation. Among not-for-profit hospitals, hold-\ning more liquid asset should improve their bond rating,\nwhich facilitates the debt financing of capital investment.\nBecause a certain level of liquid asset is needed to meet the\ndays-cash-on-hand requirement by credit rating agencies,\nnot-for-profit hospitals may not have been able to use liquid\nasset to directly fund investment. Another motive for hospi-\ntals to hold liquid asset is to engage in indirect arbitrage by\nborrowing funds at the tax-exempt interest rate while using\nthe liquid asset to generate returns in the taxable market.\nFor some hospitals, shift in financing strategy to bank\ndirect placements in response to the collapse of the auction\nrate bond market in 2008 may have diminished the role of\nliquid asset in financing capital investment. Hospitals can\ndirectly sell their bond to banks through a direct placement,\nwhich eliminates the need for a credit rating agency. In addi-\ntion, a direct placement does not require a debt service\nreserve fund, which is cash set aside to service debt. Hence,\na bank direct placement uncouples liquid asset from access\nto debt.\nA liquidity-constrained hospital with poor cash flow is\nlikely to fall behind on making the capital investment neces-\nsary for its operations and face the risk of closure. Hospitals\nwith low cash flow tend to be small rural hospitals that pro-\nvide care to underserved populations. During an economic\nrecession when poor financial performance is due to the\nexternal environment rather than the hospital management,\naccess to debt is critical for hospitals to endure the recession.\nPolicy changes that reduce payments to hospitals may dis-\ncourage liquidity-constrained hospitals from investing in\ncapital.\nThe relationship between average product of capital and\ncapital investment diminished during the recession, although\nthe change in coefficient was not statistically significant.\nCapital investment may have been forgone during the reces-\nsion because of greater uncertainty regarding the return on\ninvestment, even though the investment may have been prof-\nitable. The implications of the forgone profitable investment\nfor patient welfare depend on who is the residual claimant of\nhospital profits. Profits from investment may be returned to\nthe community, which in theory defines not-for-profit orga-\nnizations, or may be used to improve the quality of hospital\nservices. Decreased profits from investment would decrease\npatient welfare because less residual surplus is returned to\npatients. However, forgoing profitable investment that pro-\nvides no medical benefit to patients but only generates prof-\nits for the hospital manager would be beneficial to patient\nwelfare.\nPrior to the great recession, auction rate bonds and vari-\nable rate demand bonds were financing strategies available\nto hospitals that offered short-term interest rates on long-\nterm maturities. Auction rate bonds were especially attrac-\ntive to issuers because of low financing costs. During the\nsubprime mortgage crisis in 2008, the auction rate bond mar-\nket collapsed and the variable rate demand bond market was\nvolatile. Facing spikes in interest rates, many hospitals that\nheld these variable rate bonds refinanced into long-term\nbonds.32-35 Hospitals moving into fixed rate long-term bonds\nduring the recession may explain why interest rate did not\nvary year to year in the data.Also, direct placements between\na direct placement, hospitals directly issue bonds to banks\ninstead of public offerings. Regulation and accounting guide-\nlines surrounding direct placements were unclear during the\ntime,36-37 and hence direct placements may not have been\ncaptured in the OSHPD financial data.\nMy study provides evidence of liquidity constraint among\nCalifornia not-for-profit and public hospitals during the\nrecession. The theoretical cause of this liquidity constraint is\nasymmetric information, a market failure that warrants\npolicy intervention. Leading up to the recession, municipal\nbond market disclosures had shortcomings regarding their\ntimeliness, frequency, and completeness compared with the\nprivate bond market.38 These issues may have exacerbated\nthe volatility in the municipal bond market in 2008. Securities\nand Exchange Commission made rule changes in 2010 aimed\nto provide more information to investors in a timely man-\nner.39 The rule changes made certain information, including\nofficial statements, continuing disclosure, and real-time\ntrade price, available online to the public.40 The lack of trans-\nparency in the financial disclosures of not-for-profit hospi-\ntals may have disastrous consequences such as the failure of\nthe Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation.\nPolicy interventions that mitigate the problem of asymmetric\ninformation between hospitals and lenders may alleviate\nliquidity constraints during economic downturns. Improving\nhospital access to debt for investing in new equipment and\nfacilities is critical for maintaining and improving the quality\nof hospital services.\nAuthor's Note\nThe author is now at Owen Graduate School of Management,\nVanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.
