The Institute of Medicine of the National Acad-\nemy of Sciences has called for public and private purchasers of health care to create\nincentives for physician organizations (POs) to use CMPs and for the government to\nassist POs in implementing information technology (IT) to facilitate CMP use. Re-\nsearch is lacking about the extent to which POs use CMPs or about the degree to which\nincentives, IT, or other factors are associated with their use.\nObjectives To determine the extent to which POs with 20 or more physicians use\nCMPs and to identify key factors associated with CMP use for 4 chronic diseases (asthma,\ncongestive heart failure, depression, and diabetes).\nDesign, Setting, and Participants One thousand five hundred eighty-seven US\nPOs (medical groups and independent practice associations) with 20 or more physi-\ncians were identified using 5 large databases. One thousand one hundred four of these\nPOs (70%) agreed to participate in a telephone survey conducted between Septem-\nber 2000 and September 2001. Sixty-four responding POs were excluded because they\ndid not treat any of the 4 diseases, leaving 1040 POs.\nMain Outcome Measures Extent of use of CMPs as calculated on the basis of a\nsummary measure, a PO care management index (POCMI; range, 0-6) and factors\nassociated with CMP use.\nResults Physician organizations' mean use of CMPs was 5.1 of a possible 16; 50%\nused 4 or fewer. External incentives and clinical IT were most strongly associated with\nCMP use. Controlling for other factors, use of the 2 most strongly associated incentives--\npublic recognition and better contracts for health care quality--was associated with\ntional IT capability was associated with 0.37 additional CMPs (P.001). However, 33%\nof POs reported no external incentives and 50% reported no clinical IT capability.\nConclusions The use of CMPs varies greatly among POs, but it is low on average.\nGovernment and private purchasers of health care may increase CMP use by provid-\ning external incentives for improvement of health care quality to POs and by assisting\nthem in improving their clinical IT capability.\ncreased use of organized processes by\nPOs to improve the quality of care?\nTo address these questions, we con-\nducted a National Survey of Physician\nOrganizations and the Management of\nChronicIllness(NSPO).Weused5sepa-\nrate databases to develop the most ex-\ntensive census available to date of medi-\ncal groups and IPAs with 20 or more\nphysicians, and we conducted a tele-\nWefocusedonPOswith20ormorephy-\nsicians because, compared with indi-\nvidual and small group practices, these\nlarger organizations should have more\ncapacity to invest in the management\ntime and expertise, clinical IT systems,\nand skilled nonphysician staff that are\nthought to be necessary for the creation\nand maintenance of organized pro-\ncesses to improve the quality of care.19-22\nWecalledtheseorganizedprocessescare\nmanagement processes (CMPs) and hy-\npothesized that the extent to which a PO\nuses CMPs will vary with its IT capabil-\nity and with the incentives for improve-\nment of quality provided by health in-\nsuranceplansandhealthcarepurchasers.\nThe NSPO survey focused on 4 types\nof CMPs--case management, perfor-\nmance feedback to individual physi-\ncians, use of disease registries, that is,\nlists of a PO's patients with a particular\nchronic illness that make it possible for\nthe PO to organize care for patients with\nthat particular illness, and use of clini-\ncal practice guidelines in conjunction\nwith physician education and elec-\ntronic or chart-based reminder sys-\ntems.Supportforself-managementskills\nfor chronically ill patients was not as-\nsessed for the 4 individual chronic dis-\neases surveyed but only for managing\ntheir disease in general (BOX).\nWe chose these CMPs because evi-\ndence is growing that they are effective,\nindividually and especially in combina-\nCase management programs repeat-\nedly have been shown to improve out-\ncomes for patients with congestive heart\nfailure (CHF), diabetes, and mixed co-\nmorbidities.28 While clinical practice\nguidelines alone have not been dem-\nonstrated to change physician perfor-\nmance,29 a Cochrane review and re-\ncently published studies, including a\nmeta-analysis, have found that guide-\nlinesinconjunctionwithphysicianedu-\ncation or reminder systems do im-\nprove physician management of several\nchronic conditions and may improve\nfeedback to physicians has been shown\nto improve medical practice in both a\nCochrane review and a separate meta-\nanalysis, although the effect was\nsmall.17,32 Disease registries have been\nshown to be important components of\nhealth care management.33 Patient self-\nmanagement education can succeed in\nimproving clinical outcomes accord-\ning to a Cochrane review of use of this\ntechnique for patients with asthma34\nand according to randomized con-\ntrolled trials of patients with diabe-\nThe NSPO survey focused on POs'\n4 diseases are directly responsible for\nin the United States,51 generate at least\nconditions for which evidence sug-\ngests that CMPs can improve the qual-\nMETHODS\nDevelopment of a National Census\nof Medical Groups and IPAs\nTo generate as complete a national cen-\nsus as possible of medical groups and\nIPAs with 20 or more physicians, we\ncombined databases from the Medical\nGroup Management Association, Engle-\nwood, Colo; Dorland Healthcare Infor-\nmation, Philadelphia, Pa; National IPA\nCoalition, Oakland, Calif; American\nHospital Association, Chicago, Ill; and\nVirginia Commonwealth University\nStudy of Physician Organizations, Rich-\nmond (this database merges data from\n6 sources, including a survey of medi-\ncal groups by the American Medical As-\nsociation, Chicago, Ill) (R.R.G., un-\nOpinion Research Center at the Uni-\nversity of Chicago made preliminary\ntions identified to verify their type and\nsize and to arrange an appointment for\na telephone survey.

Care Management Processes Surveyed*\nCase Management\nCase management is available at the request of the physician and/or assigned to\nall severely ill patients with the disease.\nPhysician Feedback\nPhysicians receive feedback on specific practices (eg, use of anti-inflammatory medi-\ncation in asthma, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in congestive heart\nfailure, retinal screening in diabetes). Depression was omitted for this category.\nDisease Registry\nThis is maintained for patients with the disease.\nClinical Practice Guidelines\nThese are (1) adopted and (2) physicians are trained in the guidelines, and (3) the\nguidelines must be present in patient charts or in reminder systems or in order-\nentry systems. An answer of yes for use of all 3 is required.\nSelf-management Skills\nPrograms to teach chronically ill patients skills for better managing their illness in\ngeneral, not for each of the 4 chronic diseases surveyed.\n*For each care management process, the organization receives 1 point for each disease for\neach affirmative answer (except for feedback to physicians for depression) and 1 point for\nuse of programs to teach patients self-management skills.\nwere not a medical group or IPA (20%),\nwere duplicates (20%), or were ex-\ncluded for miscellaneous reasons\n(11%). In addition, we excluded the\n10% of POs that were composed of ra-\ndiologists, pathologists, chiroprac-\ntors, podiatrists, ophthalmologists,\nanesthesiologists, or emergency depart-\nment physicians.\nStudy Population\nInformation on nonrespondents is lim-\nited: they did not differ from respon-\ndents by size or by state where they were\nlocated, but response rates were sig-\nnificantly higher for IPAs (79%) than\norganizations that stated that they did\nnot treat any of the 4 chronic diseases\nmedical groups and 347 IPAs) in-\ncluded in our study.\nSurvey Development\nand Administration\nThe NSPO survey was developed based\non review of the literature on health care\nquality improvement, on dimensions of\nthe Assessment of Chronic Illness Care\nmodel,57 on feedback from the NSPO's\nnational advisory committee, and on in-\nput from a focus group of 9 medical di-\nrectors from POs. The survey was re-\nvisedafterapilottestwasconductedwith\nvey instrument is available from the cor-\nresponding author.\nOrganizations that agreed to partici-\npate were sent in advance a packet with\na worksheet to be completed prior to\nthe interview. Specially trained NORC\ninterviewers then conducted 60-\nminute telephone surveys between Sep-\neach organization's president, chief ex-\necutive officer, or medical director, us-\ning Computer Assisted Telephone In-\nterviewing.\nOutcome Measures\nTo assess POs' use of CMPs, interview-\ners asked, for each of the 4 chronic dis-\neases, whether the PO used case man-\nagement, a disease registry, clinical\nguidelines, and feedback to physi-\ncians (feedback was not asked for de-\npression) (Box). Organizations also\nwere asked whether they have general\nprograms to teach patients self-\nmanagement skills for chronic dis-\neases. To avoid positive but overly gen-\neral answers that might not accurately\nreflect an organization's use of CMPs\n(eg, \"Yes, we have guidelines\"), sur-\nvey questions were designed to probe\nfor more specific answers (eg, \"Are the\nguidelines placed in patient charts, re-\nminder systems, or order entry sys-\ntems?\" and \"Do you feed back data to\nphysicians on appropriate use of ACE\n[angiotensin-converting enzyme] in-\nhibitors for patients with CHF?\").\nTo assess the external incentives for a\nPO to improve quality of care, the sur-\nvey asked about a range of 7 incentives:\nwhether the PO received a bonus from\nhealth plans (ie, additional income from\nhealth plans for scoring well on quality\nmeasures), public recognition (eg,\nthrough report cards), or better con-\ntracts with health plans for quality and\nwhether it was required to report Health\nPlanEmployerDataandInformationSet\ndata,58 outcomes data, results of quality\nimprovement projects, or patient satis-\nfaction data to an outside organization\n(TABLE 1).\nThe use of clinical IT systems59 was\nassessed by asking POs whether they\nuse an electronic data system and, if so,\nwhether the IT system includes a stan-\ndardized problem list, the majority of\nphysician progress notes, medications\nprescribed, medication decision sup-\nport (ie, reminders and/or drug inter-\nactions information), laboratory re-\nsults, and radiology results (TABLE 2).\nTable 1.

We used InterStudy data to de-\nfine HMO penetration as the number of\npeople enrolled in HMOs in a PO's\ncounty divided by the county popula-\ntion.60 The survey asked whether a PO\ntook at least some risk for hospital-\nized HMO patients (964 POs an-\nswered this question) and whether\nHMOs delegate utilization manage-\nment responsibility for hospitalized\nHMO patients to the PO (965 POs an-\nswered this question) (Table 3).61\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used multivariate linear regres-\nsion to measure the association of ex-\nternal incentives, IT capability, char-\nacteristics of POs, HMO penetration,\nand physician group health plan con-\ntracting characteristics with POs' use of\nCMPs. The outcome variable in our\nmain model is a summary measure--a\nPhysician Organization Care Manage-\nment Index (POCMI)--with a range of\n0 to 16. An organization's POCMI score\nis the number of CMPs used by the PO\nfor the 4 chronic diseases: 1 point for\neach of the 4 CMPs for each disease\n(with the exception of feedback to phy-\nsicians for depression, which was not\nasked) plus 1 point for use of pro-\ngrams to teach patient self-manage-\nment support skills for chronic ill-\nnesses in general (Box). Omission of the\nfeedback question for depression meant\nthat depression was not weighted as\nheavily (3 possible points for CMP use\nfor depression) as the other diseases\n(each of which has 4 possible points for\nCMP use). Regression results did not\nchange significantly when depression\nwas excluded from the model nor when\ndepression was weighted equally to the\nother diseases.\nThePOCMIscoreswerenormallydis-\ntributed. The POCMI index exhibited a\nhigh level of internal consistency reli-\nabilitywithaCronbachof0.86.Analy-\nses were performed using SAS version\n8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).\nThe POCMI index treats the use of\neach type of CMP as equally impor-\ntant. Some CMPs may be more effec-\ntive in improving quality of health\ncare than others, but we did not\nbelieve that sufficient evidence existed\nto weight them differentially in our\nanalysis.17 We did, however, run\nregression analyses using a variety of\ndifferent weightings; the results of\nthese analyses did not differ signifi-\ncantly from our main model.\nThe 4 external incentives concern-\ning reports to an outside organization\n(of Health Plan Employer Data and In-\nformation Set data, outcomes data, re-\nsults of quality improvement projects,\nand patient satisfaction data) are highly\ncorrelated with each other and are in-\ncluded in our main regression analy-\nsis as a single summary variable with a\nrange of 0 to 4.

We included the 6 IT measures as\na single index variable, with a range of\n0 to 6, in our main model. Results did\nnot differ when the IT measures were\nexamined individually rather than as an\nindex in a regression analysis.\nNinety-three POs (9%) stated that\nthey treated only 3 of the 4 diseases, and\nfewer diseases. In our main model, we\nincluded these POs and assigned them\nscores for each disease they did not treat\nequal to the mean score for that dis-\nease for all POs that treated that dis-\nease. We also conducted regression\nanalyses that included only the 947 POs\nthat treated at least 3 of the 4 diseases.\nResults from these analyses did not dif-\nfer significantly from our main model.\nRESULTS\nThe mean POCMI score was 5.1, indi-\ncating that the average PO used 32% of\nused 13 or more CMPs. Case manage-\nment was the most commonly used\nCMP: that is, the mean percentage of\nPOs using case management across all\ncal guidelines used in conjunction with\nreminders placed in charts or in the\nelectronic medical record were least\nCare management processes were\nimplemented most often for diabetes\n(42.5% of POs) and least often for de-\npression (17.1% of POs). Few POs used\nany one type of CMP across all 4 ill-\ncal guidelines, disease registry, physi-\ncian feedback, and case management),\nsion, asthma, CHF, and diabetes) used\nall 4 types of CMP to focus on any 1\nillness (Table 5). Self-management pro-\ngrams for chronically ill patients were\nincluded in Table 5 because the sur-\nvey asked about self-management pro-\ngrams in general, not for each of the 4\ndiseases).\nThe results of multivariate analysis\nshowed that the presence of external in-\ncentives to improve quality of care was\nmost strongly associated with use of\nCMPs (TABLE 6). When all other vari-\nables, including other external incen-\ntives, are held constant, POs that re-\nceived public recognition for scoring\nwellonqualityofcaremeasuresused1.3\nmore CMPs (P.001).

Requiring POs to re-\nport quality of care data and activities\nto outside organizations also was sig-\nnificantlyassociatedwithincreasedCMP\nuse (P.001). Receiving a bonus for\nscoring well on quality of care mea-\nsures was not significantly associated\nwith CMP use (P=.08), possibly be-\ncause POs generally reported that the\namounts received were very small.\nThe mean number of external incen-\ntives reported by POs was only 1.7 of the\n7externalincentivessurveyed(Table1).\nThree hundred forty-one (32.8%) POs\nor fewer incentives, while only 177\nprove quality (data not shown).\nClinical IT also is significantly asso-\nciated with CMP use: each additional\ncapability is associated with the use of\n6).

For example,\nan increase of 100 physicians in a medi-\ncal group is associated with use of only\none fifth of an additional CMP, and an\nincrease from 0 to 50% in the percent-\nage of patients for whom the PO is del-\negated utilization management is asso-\nciatedwithuseofonly1additionalCMP.\nCOMMENT\nMany medical groups and IPAs have\nimplemented CMPs to improve the\nquality of care for their patients. But on\naverage, POs use 5.1 CMPs, which is\nless than one third of the 16 CMPs sur-\nveyed. These findings can be inter-\npreted as encouraging that POs are us-\ning any CMPs at all. However, the fact\nthat 50% of POs use 4 or fewer of the\n16 CMPs and that POs lacked regis-\ntries of patients with a chronic disease\n69% of the time suggests that orga-\nnized processes to improve the qual-\nity of health care remain relatively un-\ncommon in POs. It is difficult for an\norganization to provide proactive health\ncare for a specific group of patients if\nthe organization lacks these registries,\nthat is, it does not know who these pa-\ntients are.\nOur findings support the IOM and\nothers8-14 who argue that rewarding POs\nfor improving quality of care is impor-\ntant. Giving POs public recognition and\nbetter contracts for scoring well on\nquality measures is associated with the\nuse of 2.0 additional CMPs--a substan-\ntial increase, given that the average PO\nuses only a total of 5.1 CMPs. How-\never, our data also confirm the wide-\nspread perception that incentives for\nPOs to improve quality are uncom-\nported having no incentives and 74%\nhad 2 or fewer of 7 incentives sur-\nveyed to improve quality of care.\nOur findings also support the belief\nthat clinical IT is important, but that\nmost POs lack clinical IT capabili-\nties.10,20 Each additional IT capability\nwas associated with the use of 0.37\nmore CMPs, but 50% of POs had none\nof and more than 78% had 2 or fewer\nof the 6 IT capabilities surveyed.\nThe NSPO is the first study, to our\nknowledge, to provide national data on\nthe use of CMPs by POs to improve the\nquality of health care and to show that\nclinical IT capabilities and external in-\ncentives to improve quality are each\nstrongly associated with POs' use of\nCMPs. This strong association was pre-\nsent in every model for which we con-\nducted statistical analyses, including\nmodels using a variety of weights for\nindividual types of CMP, models test-\ning the association for individual types\nof CMP, and models testing the asso-\nciation for individual diseases.\nOur study has limitations, each of\nwhich suggests areas for future re-\nsearch.First,althoughrespondentswere\nassured that neither they nor their or-\nganizations would be identified, some\nmay have overstated their organiza-\ntion's CMP use, even though the sur-\nvey questions were designed to mini-\nmize this possibility. Also, it is possible\nthattheremayhavebeenaresponsebias,\nsuch that organizations that use few or\nno CMPs were less likely to agree to be\nsurveyed. For both these reasons, our\ndatamaysomewhatoverestimatetheex-\ntent of CMP use among POs in the\nTable 6.

Second, even though POs\nwere asked what CMPs were used by\ntheir organization as a whole, we do not\nknow whether each individual practice\nsite within a PO was in fact using the\nCMPs claimed for the organization. It is\npossible that some sites may have been\nusing less and some using more CMPs.\nThird, in this cross-sectional study we\ndemonstrate strong associations be-\ntween certain variables and CMP use,\nbutwecannotshowthedirectionofcau-\nsality, which may work to varying ex-\ntentsinbothdirections.Forexample,we\nsuggest that it is plausible that the pres-\nence of external incentives to improve\nquality would induce POs to imple-\nment CMPs, but we cannot exclude the\npossibility that health plans and pur-\nchasers are more likely to provide such\nincentivestoPOsthatalreadyhavesome\nCMPs in place, that is, that have shown\nsome capability to manage health care.\nAnalogously, clinical IT increases orga-\nnizations' ability to implement CMPs,\nbut organizations planning to imple-\nment CMPs may be more likely to in-\nvestinclinicalIT.Simplyprovidingclini-\ncal IT systems (eg, through government\nfinancial support) to POs that lack both\ninterest and incentives to improve qual-\nity may be unlikely to have much effect.\nUnderlying our study is the hypoth-\nesis that CMPs improve the quality of\nhealth care. Although evidence to sup-\nport this hypothesis is accumulating,\nmore research is needed to further\nexplore the relationship between CMP\nuse and clinical outcomes, specifically\nwhether certain individual CMPs and\ncombinations of CMPs are more effec-\ntive than others for specific chronic dis-\neases. This research will be difficult.61,63\nOur study also assumes that organiza-\ntions of 20 or more physicians are more\nlikely to implement CMPs than smaller\norganizations, but the extent to which\nphysicians who work in smaller prac-\ntices use CMPs is unknown. Further\nresearch is needed to identify the extent\nof CMP use and its relationship to clini-\ncal outcomes as well as the factors asso-\nciated with CMP use in these practices.\nFinally, we are able to explain 28% of\nthevarianceinCMPuseamongPOs,but\nthe literature suggests that factors not\nevaluated in this study, particularly an\norganization's leadership and culture,\nalso are important and should be a sub-\nThe findings from the NSPO have a\nnumber of important implications. For\nmedicine as a profession, the fact that\nthe use of CMPs is relatively uncom-\nmon in POs raises the question of\nwhether such processes will be devel-\nopedprimarilybyotherentities,suchas\nhealth plans and pharmaceutical com-\npanies, without adequate coordination\nwith physicians. For government and\nlarge private purchasers of health care,\nthis study provides strong confirma-\ntion for the IOM's assertions that orga-\nnized processes to improve quality of\ncare are not common in POs and that\nmany physicians work in practices that\nhave neither incentives nor IT capabili-\nties to improve quality.
