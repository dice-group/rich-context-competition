The study accounts for gender and socioeconomic and demographic variables to identify\nsubpopulations in which relatively large numbers of individuals misperceive their weight status.\nMEASUREMENTS: Survey data included clinically measured height and weight. BMI was categorized (overweight, healthy\nweight, or underweight) following conventional cutpoints. In addition, each surveyed individual was asked to assess their own\n(categorical) weight status.\nSUBJECTS: NHANES III is representative of the US population. The sample included 7758 males and 8451 females aged 20 y or\nabove after excluding women who were pregnant or breastfeeding.\nRESULTS: We show that large segments of the US population misperceive their weight status. The mix of misperceptions\ndiffers by gender, with men who are obese or overweight more likely than obese or overweight women to underassess their\nweight status. Women who are healthy weight/underweight are more likely than men to believe they are overweight. In\naddition to the gender differences, underassessors are more frequently found among those aged 65 y and over, individuals with\nrelatively low education levels, lower income levels, and among non-Hispanic black subjects. Overassessors are more frequently\nfound among women less than 65 y old (between the ages of 35 and 64 y for men), individuals with higher education levels,\nhigher income levels, and among non-Hispanic white subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Information programs linking overweight and obesity with health risks might fail to induce diet and lifestyle\nchanges if individuals fail to recognize they are overweight or obese. While there are large number of individuals who fail to\nrecognize their overweight or obese status, there are indicator variables that can help identify this subpopulation. Thus, it is\npossible to first target a message that would attempt to correct misperceptions. If successful, the size of the population\nsusceptible to a weight\u00adhealth risk information program could increase.\nKeywords: body mass index; health information programs; weight perceptions\nIntroduction\nAlthough health authorities have expressed growing concern\nover the high level of obesity in the US, most Americans are\nnot seriously concerned with obesity and express relatively\nlow support for policies to reduce obesity.1 The incongruence\nbetween the views of the health authorities and the public is\na problem for obesity prevention efforts. One reason for the\nrelatively low level of public awareness of the obesity\nepidemic may be that, while 64% of US adults are estimated\nto be overweight or obese,2 only 22% consider their own\nweight problem as serious.1\nIn this paper, we further explore this mismatch between\nindividuals' weight status based on criteria set by the health\nauthorities and their perceptions of their weight status. The\nextent of misperception about weight status has important\nimplications for health information programs that might be\nused to reduce the prevalence of obesity. For example, upon\nreceiving information about the connection between weight\n*Correspondence: Dr F Kuchler, Economic Research Service/USDA, 1800\nE-mail: fkuchler@ers.usda.gov\nThe opinions expressed here are these of the authors and not necessarily\nthose of the US Department of Agriculture.\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nstatus and health risks, a prudent individual might make diet\nand lifestyle changes to lose weight, hoping to reduce the\nhealth risks. However, health information programs might\nfail to induce this type of behavior if overweight individuals\ndo not believe they are overweight. These individuals will\nassume that the message is intended for someone else. In this\ncase, the people most in need of changing their diet and\nlifestyle will not do so. An entirely different strategy would\nbe necessary to induce desired diet and lifestyle changes.\nCurrently, there is widespread agreement that body mass\nindex (BMI) offers a fairly reliable means of assessing an\nindividual's total body fat, as BMI is significantly correlated\nwith total body fat content.3 Also important is that BMI is\ncalculated from information that can be gathered easily\n(height and weight). That simplicity along with the wide-\nspread use of BMI within both the private sector and the\npublic health community suggests that it is easy for\nindividuals to assess correctly their weight status. However,\nindividuals may not develop self-perceptions of their weight\nstatus solely based on criteria set by health authorities. Other\nfactors such as health risk perceptions, social norms, and\ncultural and ethnic traditions may influence how individuals\nassess their own obesity or overweight status. This may\ncreate a mismatch between the public health community's\nassessment of obesity prevalence and the public's own\nassessment of overweight and obesity.\nIn this paper, we examine the agreement between\nindividuals' weight status as indicated by their BMI, and\ntheir perceptions of their weight status. Using data from the\nthird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,\nthe population misperceive their weight status and that the\npattern of misperceptions differs by gender and system-\natically follows socioeconomic and demographic lines.\nMethods\nNHANES III is a nationally representative survey. Most\nsurveyed individuals went through an extensive health\nevaluation at a Mobile Examination Center (MEC). As part\nof the evaluation, technicians measured individual weight\nand height. We used weight and height measurements to\ncalculate BMI and classified adults as obese (BMIZ30 kg/m2),\nunderweight (BMIo25 kg/m2). In addition to physical\nmeasurements, adults also answered a health questionnaire\nduring the evaluation. They were asked to assess their own\nweight status: `Do you consider yourself now to be over-\nweight, underweight, or about the right weight?' We cross-\ntabulate the BMI-based weight classification against indivi-\nduals' own self-assessed weight status, namely whether\nindividuals believe they are overweight or fall into the\ncombined category of `about the right weight' or under-\nweight. We assume that individuals interpret `about the right\nweight' to mean healthy weight. We limit our attention to\nthree BMI-based weight classes (obese, overweight, and\nhealthy weight/underweight), two self-assessed weight\nclasses (overweight and healthy weight/underweight), and\nthe six cross-classifications.\nBased on this cross-tabulation, we identify two types of\nmisperceptions: underassessment and overassessment of\nweight status. Underassessment is defined here as occurring\nwhen individuals are obese or overweight but believe they\nare healthy weight or underweight. Overassessment occurs\nwhen individuals are healthy weight or underweight, but\nbelieve they are overweight. There are three cross-classifica-\ntions for which individual self-assessments are accurate.\nThese include the obese and the overweight who believe\nthey are overweight, and the healthy weight/underweight\nwho believe they are healthy weight/underweight.\nOur attention is especially focused on the size of the\noverweight and obese groups that underassess their weight\nstatus. Our work shares some similarity to that of Paeratakul\net al,5 in that they tabulate subpopulation percentages of\nindividuals who believe they are overweight. From their\nstatistics, one can calculate percentages that underassess\ntheir weight status. However, their analysis is based on self-\nreported height and weight data (from the US Department of\nAgriculture's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Indivi-\nduals). Self-reported height and weight data are unlikely to\nbe as precise as clinically measured data used in this study,\nand may be systematically biased.6 Further, our subpopula-\ntion definitions are finer than theirs, showing more precisely\nwhere the misperceptions are concentrated. We also examine\nthe size of the group that overassesses its weight status. This\nis important since there are two ways health information\nprograms may fail to yield desired diet and lifestyle changes.\nWhile information might fail to generate health concerns\namong the overweight and obese, information conceivably\ncould also unnecessarily generate health concerns among\nthose who are not overweight.\nTo highlight where misperceptions are concentrated, we\ncross-tabulated weight status and perceived weight status\nseparately by gender and by socioeconomic and demo-\ngraphic variables. These cross-tabulations help to identify\nthe proportion of underassessors and overassessors in\ndifferent subpopulations. Contrast t-tests revealed whether\ngender and differences in socioeconomic and demographic\nvariables are related to the accuracy of weight status beliefs.\nWe looked for differences in the frequencies of weight\nmisperceptions between those who did not complete high\nschool and those who attained higher education levels;\nbetween those below the poverty threshold and those in\nhigher income classes; between non-Hispanic white subjects\nand other broad race/ethnicity classes; and between indivi-\nduals aged 20\u00ad34 y and older age cohorts.\nIn addition to gender and socioeconomic and demo-\ngraphic variables, we examined the association between\nweight assessment accuracy with smoking behavior, Food\nStamp use, and food security. Smoking is known to influence\nadiposity and weight.7 Its impact on weight assessment\nMisperception as a barrier to reducing overweight\nF Kuchler and JN Variyam\nInternational Journal of Obesity\naccuracy has not been investigated. Studies of smokers' risk\nperceptions have shown that, on an average, smokers\nsignificantly overassess health risks of smoking. However,\nnonsmokers generally overassess risks of smoking to a greater\nextent.8 If smokers consistently make more informed risk\nassessments than nonsmokers, we should see more over-\nassessors among healthy weight/underweight nonsmokers\nthan among healthy weight/underweight smokers.\nFood Stamps have been hypothesized to influence weight\nstatus by raising energy intake.9 Receipt of Food Stamps\ncould have a variety of effects on weight status assessment\naccuracy as some Food Stamp users would be undernour-\nished and underweight without Food Stamps while others\nare badly nourished but not underweight. We examined the\nrelation between weight assessment accuracy and food\nsecurity because Food Stamps are intended to increase food\nsecurity.\nWe excluded from calculation women who were pregnant\nor breastfeeding, limiting the analysis to adults age 20 y or\nmore. A small fraction of individuals did not report self-\nassessed weight status. After these exclusions, the available\nAvailable sample sizes were slightly smaller for some cross-\ntabulations because of missing values for the relevant\nsocioeconomic variables.\nNHANES III was based upon a complex sample design. The\nsurvey drew a multistage, stratified, clustered sample, and\nrepresents the total civilian noninstitutionalized population,\n2 months of age or over, in the 50 states of the United States.\nOur estimates of population proportions incorporated\nsample weights to account for unequal probabilities of\nselection. The variances of statistics reflected design effects,\naccounting for strata and primary sampling units. We used a\nsoftware package, `SUDAAN-Software for the Statistical\nAnalysis of Correlated Data',10 so our contrast statistics\nwould accurately reflect the sampling variance.\nResults\nWe found that misperceiving weight status is commonplace.\nTabulating the number of individuals by weight status shows\nthat 59.00% of male subjects are either overweight or obese\n(BMIZ25 kg/m2). Tabulating male subjects by self-assessed\nweight status shows that 44.22% say they are overweight.\nThe relative magnitudes are opposite for female subjects. For\nfemale subjects, 50.49% are either overweight or obese, while\n60.09% say they are overweight. In effect, the mix of\nmisperceptions among men is different from that among\nwomen.\nTable 1 reports results of cross-tabulating actual and\nperceived weight status, with separate cross-tabulations for\nmale and for female subjects. The table shows the percen-\ntages of men and women of varying weight statuses that\nbelieve that they are healthy weight/underweight. For the\nobese and overweight, the table indicates the percentages of\neach weight class that are mistaken, underassessing their\nweight. Clearly, the number of mistakes is substantial. For\nthe healthy weight/underweight, the table indicates the\npercentages that are correct, here defined as accurately\nidentifying themselves as healthy weight/underweight.\nThe table shows that the mistakes are not all at the margin,\nwhere an individual who weighs a few pounds over the\noverweight cutpoint might say his weight is about right.\nInstead, many of the mistakes are much larger. Among male\nsubjects who are overweight, but not obese, 42.74% do not\nperceive that they are overweight. Instead, they say their\nweight is about right or that they are underweight. The error\nrate for this type of mistake is lower among obese males, with\n11.90% saying their weight is about right or that they are\nunderweight. So, being a little above the cutpoint for\noverweight makes a person more likely to say their weight\nis about right compared to a person who is obese. However, a\nnontrivial number of individuals whose BMI values are\n30 kg/m2 or more describe themselves as if their BMI values\nThese cross-tabulations show that gender differences are\nsubstantial. Women who are obese or overweight are more\nlikely than men to assess accurately their weight status,\nacknowledging they are overweight. For example, 18.40% of\nwomen who are overweight, but not obese, say they are\nthey are overweight. That is, men who are overweight are\nmore than twice as likely as women who are overweight to\nfail to recognize their overweight status. In contrast, women\nare more likely to believe they are overweight when they are\nnot overweight. For men, 10.96% of those who are healthy\nweight/underweight believe they are overweight (100.00\u00ad\nunderweight, 35.32% believe they are overweight. This\naccords with Sciacca et al's finding that more women (40%)\nconsidered themselves overweight compared with men\nTable 2 shows results of cross-tabulating weight status and\nself-assessed weight status separately by levels of four socio-\neconomic and demographic variables. As results for men and\nwomen differ so strikingly, we further refine the sub-\npopulations, differentiating by gender. Under columns\nheaded `obese' or `overweight', the table shows the propor-\ntion of underassessors among the obese and overweight,\nseparated by education, income, race/ethnicity, and age,\nTable 1 Percentages of men and women of varying weight statuses that\nbelieve they are healthy weight/underweight\nMales Females\nMisperception as a barrier to reducing overweight\nF Kuchler and JN Variyam\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nwith each socioeconomic and demographic variable further\ndifferentiated by gender. Numbers listed under `obese' are\nproportions of obese subpopulations who say they are\nhealthy weight/underweightFthe very optimistic. Similarly,\nnumbers listed under `overweight' are proportions of over-\nweight subpopulations who say they are healthy weight/\nunderweightFalso optimistic, but not so much as the obese\nwho claim to be healthy weight/underweight. For example,\n7.90% of male college graduates who are obese claim to be\nhealthy weight/underweight.\nUnder the columns headed `healthy/underweight', the\ntable also shows the proportion of overassessors among the\nhealthy weight/underweight similarly separated by four\nsocioeconomic and demographic variables and further\ndifferentiated by gender. For example, 34.83% of healthy\nweight/underweight female college graduates say they are\noverweight.\nBase levels for comparison are education of grade 11 or\nless, household income at or below 130% of the poverty\nlevel, non-Hispanic white subjects, and age of more\nthan 64 y, each estimated separately for male and for\nfemale subjects. We reported statistical significance of\ndifferences from base levels using * to denote an a \u00bc 0.10\nlevel of significance, ** to denote a \u00bc 0.05, and *** to denote\nEducation\nWe separated the population by educational attainment,\ndenoting those with 16 or 17 y of education as `college'. and\ncollege'. We assumed that 12 y of education implies high\nschool completion and that 11 y or fewer did not. As some\nrespondents did not report the highest grade they com-\npleted, the cross-tabulations included data from 7697 males\nUnderassessment falls as education levels reach or exceed\nhigh school. Among both the obese and the overweight\n(those who can underassess), the proportion of under-\nassessors is larger among those who did not complete high\nschool than among those with greater education levels. This\nassociation is realized for male and for female subjects. In\nfact, for each level of education at or above high school, the\npercentage of underassessors is significantly smaller than in\ncorresponding base levels of nonhigh school graduates (at\nleast at the a \u00bc 0.10 level). For example, among overweight\nTable 2 Percentages of men and women of varying weight and socioeconomic statuses that underassess or overassess their weight status\nMales Females\nUnderassessors Overassessors Underassessors Overassessors\nObese Overweight Healthy/underweight Obese Overweight Healthy/underweight\nSocioeconomic status\nEducation\nIncome level\nRace/ethnicity\nAge\n***Indicates P-value of contrast t-test (difference \u00bc 0) is 0.01 or less. **Indicates P-value of contrast t-test is 0.05 or less. *Indicates P-value of contrast t-test is 0.10 or\nless.\nVarying education levels were contrasted with grade 11 or less (base). Income levels were contrasted with 130% of poverty level or less (base). Races/ethnicities were\ncontrasted with Non-Hispanic white subjects (base). Age cohorts were contrasted with more than 64 y (base).\nMisperception as a barrier to reducing overweight\nF Kuchler and JN Variyam\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nwomen, 34.54% of those who did not complete high school\nunderassessed their weight status, while 14.48% of over-\nweight women who did complete high school underassessed.\nAmong overweight women who completed some college,\ncollege graduates underassessed.\nHowever, while education is associated with a lower error\nrate among the obese and overweight, education is asso-\nciated with a higher error rate among the healthy weight/\nunderweight. The proportion of overassessors is smaller\namong the healthy weight/underweight who did not\ncomplete high school than among those with more years\nof education. These differences are statistically significant for\nboth males and females.\nIncome\nWe segmented the population based on family income\nrelative to the poverty threshold. We established three\nincome classes: those with family income at or below\n130% of the poverty threshold, those with greater family\nincome but not more than 350% of the poverty threshold,\nand those with family income above 350% of the poverty\nthreshold. Poverty threshold was defined by the age of the\nfamily reference person, and the calendar year in which the\nfamily was interviewed. Poverty threshold values (in dollars)\nare produced annually by the US Census Bureau (Series P-60).\nThese threshold values are based on calendar years and\nadjusted for changes caused by inflation between calendar\nyears. As some survey respondents refused to discuss their\nincome, cross-tabulations included data from 7070 male and\nIn general, findings related to income are similar to those\nfor education. For obese and overweight female subjects in\nhigher income classes, there were fewer underassessors than\nin the lowest income class. There were significantly more\noverassessors among the healthy weight/underweight in\nhigher income classes. Results for male subjects were\napproximately the same, with one exception. The propor-\ntions of underassessors among the obese in higher income\nclasses appear to be smaller than in the lowest income class,\nbut the differences are not statistically significant.\nRace and ethnicity\nWe separated individuals by race and ethnicity, creating four\nmutually exclusive categories: Hispanic, non-Hispanic black,\nnon-Hispanic white (base), and non-Hispanic other people\n(Aleuts, Eskimos, American Indians, Asians, and Pacific\nIslanders). In the survey results, each sampled individual\nprovided complete information on race, ethnicity, and age.\nThus, cross-tabulations included data from 7758 male and\n8451 female subjects both for race/ethnicity and for age.\nFor both male and female non-Hispanic black subjects,\nthere were more underassessors among the overweight and\nobese, compared to non-Hispanic white subjects. Also, there\nwere fewer overassessors among the healthy weight/under-\nweight non-Hispanic black subjects. Hispanics were qualita-\ntively similar to non-Hispanic black subjects. Hispanics and\nnon-Hispanic black subjects displayed the same pattern of\ndifferences from non-Hispanic white subjects. Statistical\nsignificance of the differences between Hispanic and non-\nHispanic white subjects was not as high, however, as the\ndifference between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic\nwhite subjects.\nAge\nBased on respondent's age at the MEC exam, we classified\n64, and 65 y or more. Male and female subjects are alike in\nthat the number of underassessors among the overweight\nand obese is larger in the oldest cohort. The number of\noverassessors is smallest among the oldest cohort.\nSmoking, food stamps, and food security\nResults of these cross-tabulations are presented in Table 3.\nContrasts are indicated by comparing proportions on one\nrow with matching categories on the row below (base).\nCross-tabulations included data from 4256 smokers and\n11 952 nonsmokers. The percentage of overassessors among\nthe healthy weight/underweight is lower for smokers than\nfor nonsmokers. That is, healthy weight/underweight smo-\nkers are somewhat better at assessing their own weight status\nthan are nonsmokers. Assessing weight status is clearly not\nthe same as assessing health risks from being overweight, but\nTable 3 Percentages of smokers/nonsmokers, Food Stamp recipients/\nnonrecipients, and food secure/insecure that underassess or overassess their\nweight status\nUnderassessors Overassessors\nObese Overweight Healthy/underweight\nAdiposity influence\nSmoking status\nFood Stamp use\nFood security\n***Indicates P-value of contrast t-test (difference \u00bc 0) is 0.01 or less. **Indicates\nP-value of contrast t-test is 0.05 or less. *Indicates P-value of contrast t-test is\n0.10 or less. Those who smoke, received Food Stamps, or were food secure\nwere contrasted, respectively, with those who do not smoke, did not receive\nFood Stamps, or were food insecure (base levels).\nMisperception as a barrier to reducing overweight\nF Kuchler and JN Variyam\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ndoes suggest that healthy weight/underweight smokers are\nbetter informed than healthy weight/underweight nonsmo-\nkers about their own weight status. Overweight and obese\nsmokers demonstrate no such advantage over overweight\nand obese nonsmokers. There is no statistical difference\nbetween obese smokers and obese nonsmokers in weight\nassessment accuracy. Nor is there a difference between\noverweight smokers and overweight nonsmokers.\nThe survey asked, `Did (you/any member of this family)\nreceive food stamps in any of the last 12 months?' Food\nstamps refers to the Food Stamp Program administered by\nthe US Department of Agriculture. The cross-tabulations\nnonrecipients. Differentiating on the basis of Food Stamp\nreceipt yielded mixed results regarding weight assessment\naccuracy. There are a higher percentage of underassessors\namong overweight Food Stamp recipients than among\nnonrecipients. However, there are fewer healthy weight/\nunderweight overassessors among Food Stamp recipients\nthan among nonrecipients. These results mirror findings for\nincome and education. It is not possible to attribute causality\nto any one of these factors.\nThe survey asked respondents `Do you have enough food\nto eat, sometimes not enough to eat, or often not enough to\neat?' The intent of this question was to capture insufficient\nfood availability at the family level because of lack of money\nand/or other resources. Cross-tabulations included 15 200\nfood secure responses and 989 insecure. Results are similar to\nthose for Food Stamps, although statistical significance is\nlower.\nDiscussion\nIn cross-tabulating weight status, calculated from measured\nheight and weight, with perceived weight status, we found\nthat misperceptions are commonplace. Nearly 43% of over-\nweight (but not obese) men believe their weight is about\nright. Nearly 12% of obese men say their weight is about\nright. Underassessments are in the range of two to three\ntimes more common among men than among women.\nThese findings are important for the design of information\nprograms. An information program could be designed to\ninduce diet and lifestyle changes among the overweight and\nobese by demonstrating associations between weight status\nand health risks from chronic diseases. It is likely that\nunderassessors would ignore such a program. In effect, over\none-third of men to whom such a program would be targeted\nwould fail to recognize the program's importance.\nOur definition of misperceptions included both under-\nassessing and overassessing weight statuses. More than one-\nthird of healthy weight or underweight women say they are\noverweight. This should be of concern for information\nprograms designed to raise the awareness of the health risks\nof being overweight. Raising awareness could be harmful to\noverassessors by unnecessarily generating health concerns.\nAs Sciacca et al11 note, perception of overweight has been\nlinked to harmful eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa\nand bulimia, which afflict American women.\nWe found that many factors beyond gender characterize\nthe subpopulation that misperceives weight status. Under-\nassessors are more frequently found among those aged 65 y\nand over, individuals with relatively low education levels,\nlower income levels, and among non-Hispanic black sub-\njects. Overassessors are more frequently found among\nfor men), individuals with higher education levels, higher\nincome levels, and among non-Hispanic white subjects.\nThus, it is possible to first target a message that would\nattempt to correct misperceptions. If successful, the size of\nthe population susceptible to a weight\u00adhealth risk program\nwould significantly increase.\nReferences\n1 Lee T, Oliver JE.
