After adjusting for\ntemperature, day of week, season, and temporal trends, we\nfound little evidence of association between air pollution and\nhospital admissions for respiratory causes in Birmingham. In\ncontrast, we found that air pollution was associated with hos?\npital admissions for respiratory causes in Minneapolis-St. Paul.\nAmong the individual pollutants, 03 was most strongly asso?\nciated with admissions (estimated increase in hospital admis?\nsions associated with a 15-parts-per-billion increase in 03 on\n7.94%), and this association was robust in the sense that it was\nlittle affected by the simultaneous consideration of other pol?\nlutants.

Rather, attention was focused on the particulate\ncomponent of air pollution, with (usually) one other\npollutant considered as a possible confounder. In studies\nof daily mortality, S02 was most often considered as a\nconfounder.1,5 Studies of hospital admissions generally\nconsidered particulates and ozone.6,7\nIn previous publications11,12 on the association be?\ntween air pollution and mortality, we have argued that\nair pollution is a complex mixture and that the currently\navailable regression techniques cannot isolate the effects\nof individual components of this mixture. In this con?\ntext, results of regression analyses that consider only a\nfew of the criteria pollutants are even more difficult to\ninterpret because the possibility of confounding by the\nomitted pollutants cannot be ruled out.\nFromthe ^redHutchinson\nCancerResearch\nCenter,Seattle,WA, andSci?\nencesInternational,\nInc, Alexandria,\nAddress\ncorrespondence\nto: SureshH.

Table 2 shows the correlations\namong the pollution and weather variables.\nMethods of Analysis\nWe used a series of semiparametric Poisson regression\nmodels (generalized additive models) for analyses of the\ndata.13 All models inciuded an intercept term, indicator\nvariables for day of week and for season (defined as\nfollows: winter of a given year was December of that year\nand January and February of the next year; spring was\nMarch, April, and May; summer was June, July, and\nAugust; fall was September, October, and November),\nnonparametric smoothers for temperature and day of\nstudy (the latter to adjust for temporal trends and vari?\nations in hospital admissions not attributable to pollu?\ntion or weather), and one or more of the pollution\nvariables. In the \"basic\" model, with which we began the\nanalyses, temporal trends were adjusted by a 20 degree of\nfreedom smoothing spline. To investigate the impact of\nsmoothing on the estimates of pollutant effects, we then\nincreased the degree of smoothing. We used the Akaike\nInformation Criterion (AIC) to comoare models.13 The\nTABLE 2. Correlation among Pollutants and Temperature in Minneapolis*St.\nPaul and Birmingham\nAIC is the sum of the residual devi-\nance and twice the number of degrees\nof freedom used up in fitting the model\nto the data; it can be thought of as the\ndeviance with a penalty term added to\ntake account of the number of param?\neters in the model. In a comparison of\ntwo models, the model with the\nsmaller AIC is preferred.\nWe first undertook a limited explo-\nration of the lag between exposure to a\npollutant and hospital admissions.\nSpecifically, we examined lags of 0, 1,\n2, and 3 days for each of the pollutants\nand picked the lag that yielded the\nstrongest association with respiratory\nadmissions, although this lag was not\nnecessarily the lag that minimized the AIC. We then\nconsidered models with various combinations of pollut?\nants using that lag structure for each poiiutant. We also\ninvestigated the lag structure for temperature. We found\nthat a strong association between mean daily tempera?\nture and respiratory admissions persisted even with a lag\nof 10 days. Here, we present results of analyses in which\nwe controlled for temperature by using a smoother with\n10 degrees of freedom either for the current-day mean or\nfor a 7-day running average. Finally, with all covariates\nin the model, we examined the effect of using smoothers\nwith varying degrees of freedom for day of study to\ncontrol for temporal trends in hospital admissions. We\nfound that the AIC decreased with increased smoothing\nof temporal trends until it reached a minimum and\nreversed trend to increase again. Thus, by the AIC, there\nis an optimal degree of smoothing for temporal trends.\nAll models were fit using the statistical software pack-\nage S-PLUS.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the distributions of hospital admissions,\ndaily mean temperature, and pollutants in Minneapolis-\nSt. Paul and Birmingham, respectively. The pollutants\nin both cities were moderately correlated (Table 2). We\npresent the results of analyses with the lag structure for\nindividual pollutants that maximized the effect of that\npoiiutant. Unless otherwise stated, all results are pre?\nsented for the total of COPD and pneumonia admis?\nsions, which we call total respiratory admissions. We\nconsidered total respiratory admissions to increase the\ndaily number of hospital admissions. We also analyzed\nCOPD and pneumonia admissions separately (see Dis?\ncussion). For total respiratory admissions in Minneapo?\nlis-St. Paul, the lag structure that maximized the associ?\nation was 1 day for PM10, ozone, and NOz, and 2 days for\nS02. Carbon monoxide showed only weak and incon?\nsistent associations with total respiratory admissions. In\nBirmingham, we did not consider S02 because of the\nlarge number of days with missing information. Carbon\nmonoxide showed a weak association with total respira?\ntory hospital admissions. Since the focus of previous\nanalyses was PM10 and ozone, we present the results of\nthese analyses in detail. Both PM10 and ozone showed\ngenerally inconsistent associations with hospital admis?\nsions, with the coefficients either positive or negative\ndepending upon the lag chosen (Table 3). The strongest\npositive association of ozone with hospital admissions\nwas found with a lag of 2 days. For PM10, the strongest\nassociation was seen with a lag of 0 days, that is, with\nconcentrations of PM10 on the same day.\nIn both datasets, day of week, season, and temperature\nwere strongly associated with hospital admissions for\nrespiratory disease. In both cities, admissions were high?\nest in winter and lowest in summer after controlling for\nthe other covariates. Temperature was associated with\nhospital admissions even with lag times on the order of\n10 days. In our analyses, we considered either a 7-day\nrunning average or the mean temperature on the same\nTABLE 3. Coefficients (Natural Log of the Relative\nRisks) and Standard Errors for Individual Pollutants with\nVarying Lag Times Estimated from Regression Analyses of\n  Admissions (Pneumonia and COPD) in Birming?\nham. Each Pollutant Entered Individually into the Model,\nWhich Also Inciuded an Intercept Term, Indicator Terms\nfor Season and Day of Week, a 10 Degree of Freedom\nSmoother for Same-Day Mean Temperature, and a 60 De?\ngree of Freedom Smoother for Temporal Trends in Admis?\nsions. Reported Coefficients Are for 1 /xg/m3 PM10, 1 part\nper billion 03, and 1 part per million CO\nday. In both cases, the effect of temperature was modeled\nnonparametrically using a 10 degree of freedom smooth?\ning spline. In Minneapolis, we found that the 7-day\nrunning average of temperature was more strongly asso?\nciated with hospital admissions than the same-day mean\ntemperature. The opposite was true in Birmingham.\nThere are likely to be temporal trends in hospital\nadmissions not related to the covariates considered in\nthe regression models. In previous analyses, we have\ncontrolled for these by considering the seasons sepa?\nrately and by using indicator variables for year. Because\nof the rather small datasets (only 6 years of observation\nin each city) analyzed here, we focused our efforts on\nanalyzing the entire time series in each city. We used\nnonparametric smoothers to control for temporal trends\nin hospital admissions. We used the AIC as an explor-\natory tool to investigate what degree of smoothing best\ndescribed the data. We found, in both datasets, that the\nAIC decreased with increasing smoothing to a minimal\nvalue. Further smoothing increased the AIC, suggesting\nthat, for each dataset, there was an optimal level of\nsmoothing. For the Minneapolis dataset, this optimum\nappeared to be at approximately 130 degrees of freedom\nfor a smoothing spline. For the Birmingham data, the\noptimum appeared to be at approximately 60 degrees of\nfreedom for a smoothing spline. These procedures are\nroughly equivalent to using 17-day and 3 7-day running\naverage filters on the hospital admissions in Minneapolis\nand Birmingham, respectively.\nEstimates of the association between air pollutants\nand hospital admissions for respiratory causes are shown\nin Figures 1-3 and in Tables 3 and 4. We initially\nconducted analyses with the basic model (defined\nabove). In Minneapolis (Figures 1 and 2; Table 4), each\nof the pollutants, with the exception of CO, was asso?\nciated with total respiratory hospital admissions when\nconsidered alone in the basic regression model. The\nestimated effect for each pollutant, reported as the per?\ncentage change in hospital admissions associated with\nan increase in pollutant level approximately equal to the\nper billion for S02) were as follows: PM10\nMinneapolis COPD+ Pneumonia Admissions\nFIGURE 1. Estimated change in hospital admissions in\nMinneapolis-St. Paul associated with change in the concen?\ntrations of PM10 and ozone on the previous day. The esti-\nmates and 95% confidence intervals are given for a change in\nconcentrations for the pollutants that is equal to the intern\nper billion (ppb) for ozone. The estimates are derived from\nthe basic model (see text). The estimates in the left panel are\nwith the pollutants included singly in the regression; the\nestimates in the right panel are with pollutants considered\nsimultaneously.\n? 1 indicates that this estimate is for a lag of\n1 day, etc. Carbon monoxide showed inconsistent asso?\nciations with hospital admissions for COPD and pneu?\nmonia combined, with the coefficients either positive or\nnegative, depending upon the lag structure used. We\nfound, however, that CO was associated with hospital\nadmissions for COPD alone (see Discussion). When we\nconsidered PM10 and ozone together in the regression\nmodel, both continued to be strongly associated with\nhospital admissions, with the coefficient of each atten-\nuated somewhat (Figure 1). When the four pollutants\nneously in the regression models, the association of\nozone with respiratory admissions was the strongest (Fig?\nure 2). With increased smoothing, the pollution effects\nwere somewhat attenuated, as would be expected. The\nAIC decreased with increasing smoothing until it\nreached a minimum at approximately 130 degrees of\nfreedom for the smoothing spline (Figure 2). Among\nPM10, S02, and NOz, it was not possible to single out\none as being more important than the others. Although\nthe degree of smoothing affected the estimates of effects\nassociated with the pollutants, it did not affect the\nrelative importance of the pollutants. With the optimal\ndegree of smoothing as judged by the AIC, ozone was\nstill strongly associated with hospital admissions.\nIn Birmingham, neither PM10 nor ozone showed con?\nsistent associations with hospital admissions for respira-\ntory causes (Table 3). The estimated coefficients (log of\nthe relative risks) for these pollutants were either posi?\ntive or negative depending upon the lag structure used in\nthe regression models. The coefficient for CO, although\nsmall, was positive for the lag structures investigated.\nPositive associations of hospital admissions with PM10\nand with ozone were seen with lags of 0 and 2 days,\nrespectively. Results of analyses with both pollutants\ninciuded with these lag structures are shown in Figure 3.\nAs indicated above, the mean of the current-day tem?\nperature was more strongly associated with hospital ad?\nmissions in Birmingham than the 7-day running average\nand also described the data better as judged by the AIC\n(AIC = 1,717 for model with 7-day running average;\nAIC = 1,708 for model with same-day mean tempera?\nture; models include both pollutants).\nDiscussion\nIn previous analyses of time series data on daily mortal?\nity, we have advocated separate analyses by season. In-\ndeed, we have reported that seasonal factors modify the\neffect of pollution on mortality. We would have liked to\ninvestigate effect modification by season in this study as\nwell. The short time series and the small number of daily\nadmissions for respiratory diseases made this infeasible,\nhowever. As we accumulate more years of data, season-\nspecific analyses should become possible.\nPrevious analyses of respiratory admissions in Minne?\napolis6 and Birmingham7 concluded that PM10 was\nstrongly associated with admissions for both COPD and\npneumonia in both cities. Ozone was reported to be\nweakly associated with pneumonia admissions in Min?\nneapolis and with both pneumonia and COPD admis?\nsions in Birmingham. Our analyses in this paper with 2\nmore years of data and consideration of other pollutants\ndid not confirm these results. In Minneapolis, we found\na strong and consistent association of ozone with total\ndaily respiratory admissions. Although PM10 was strongly\nassociated with respiratory admissions when considered\nas the only pollutant in regression models, its effect was\ngreatly attenuated when ozone, N02, and S02 were\nsimultaneously considered, as can be seen by comparing\nFigures 1 and 2. With a 20 degree of freedom smoothing\nspline for temporal trends, the estimated increase in\nhospital admissions associated with a 20-u,g per m3 in?\ncrease in PM10 dropped from about 3% to about 2%.\nWith more smoothing of temporal trends, this estimate\nwas further attenuated until it stabilized at about 1%\n(Figure 2, second, third, and fourth panels). Ozone con-\ntinued to be strongly associated with respiratory admis?\npollutant stood out as being more important than the\nothers. In Birmingham, we could detect no consistent\nassociation of any of the available pollutants with hos?\npital admissions for respiratory diseases. Unfortunately,\ndata on N02 levels were not available, and the informa?\ntion on S02 had a large missing chunk. Therefore, we\nwere unable to investigate the effects of these pollutants.\nEpidemiologic studies of the association between air\npollution and hospital admissions for respiratory disease\nB\nMinneapolis\nCOPD\n+Pneumonia\nAdmissions\nAIC\nE\nMinneapolis\nCOPD\n+Pneumonia\nAdmissions\nAIC\nFIGURE 2. Effect of smoothing of temporal trends on parameter estimates and confidence intervals in Minneapolis-St. Paul.\nThe degree of smoothing of temporal trends and the resulting AIC for the model are given in each panel. AH pollutants were\nsimultaneously entered into the models, which contained, in addition, an intercept term, indicators for day of week and season,\nand a spline smoother for temporal trends with different degrees of freedom. PM10, 03, and N02 were considered with lags of\n1 day, and S02 was considered with a lag of 2 days. Note the lower AIC with increased smoothing of temporal trends. As\nthroughout this paper, all estimates are for concentration changes equal to the interquartile ranges, which are shown on the\nfigure.\nare summarized in a recent review.14 Most studies have\nreported positive associations between levels of particu?\nlate matter and hospital admissions with various lag\ntimes. The interpretation of these studies is limited,\nhowever, by the fact that they have considered at most\none other pollutant along with the particulates. More?\nover, these studies did not explore the sensitivity of the\nresults to various methods of adjusting temporal trends.\nOur analyses suggest that the procedure used for adjust?\ning temporal trend could have substantial impact on the\nconclusions.\nWe have used the AIC as an exploratory tool in this\npaper. We are not suggesting that AIC be used to choose\namong models when other information is available. Ide-\nally, biological plausibility should play an important role\nin the choice of a model. Unfortunately, however, there\nis little biology to guide us in the choice, for example, of\nthe optimal degree of smoothing for analyses of time\nseries in air pollution epidemiology. Even if one had a\nprior hypothesis based loosely on biological consider-\nations, how could one justify rejection of a model that\ndescribed the data better as judged by an objective\ncriterion? As pointed out above, our choice of smoothers\nfor temporal trends corresponds roughly to using a 17-\nday running average filter in Minneapolis and a 3 7-day\nrunning average filter in Birmingham. Similar filters\nhave been used in the past in the analyses of air pollu?\ntion data- In both Minneapolis and Birmingham, the\nAIC indicated that there was an optimal degree of\nsmoothing of temporal trends. Smoothing beyond this\npoint led to models that had a worse fit as judged by the\nAIC. Second, although there was some attenuation of\nthe air pollution effects with increased smoothing, these\neffects were not wiped out. In particular, the effect of\nozone on hospital admissions in Minneapolis was re-\nmarkably robust.\nIn Minneapolis, we explored as well the effect of air\npollution on COPD and pneumonia admissions sepa?\nrately. Table 3 shows the estimated associations between\nthe pollutants and these diseases while controlling for\nseason, temperature, and day of week. For COPD and\npneumonia, optimal smoothing of temporal trends oc?\nrespectively. S02 and N02 appeared to have little asso?\nciation with admissions for COPD; CO appeared to have\nlittle association with admissions for pneumonia. The\nmost striking association was that of ozone with admis?\nsions for pneumonia. No other single poiiutant stood\nout.\nBirmingham COPD + Pneumonia\nTemp:7-dayrunning\naverage\nSamedaytemperature\nFIGURE 3. Estimated changes in hospital admissions in Birmingham associated with changes in pollutant levels. Results\nwith both pollutants considered simultaneously. In the left panel, temperature is controlled by using a smoothing spline for the\n7-day running average. The optimal smoother for temporal trends in this case was a 50 degree of freedom smoothing spline.\nIn the right panel, temperature is controlled by a smoothing spline for same-day mean temperature. The optimal smoother for\ntemporal trends is a 60 degree of freedom smoothing spline. Note that the AIC is lower in the right panel, that is, when\nsame-day mean temperature is used in the regression model.\nIn Birmingham, we could not detect an association\nbetween air pollution and hospital admissions. In fact,\nby the AIC, a regression model incorporating day of\nweek, season, a 60 degree of freedom smoother for\ntrends, and same-day mean temperature described the\nadmissions data better (AIC = 1,699) than the identical\nmodel with PMin and ozone also in-\nTABLE 4.

We obtained similar results when\nadmissions for pneumonia and COPD\nwere each analyzed separately. Because\nthe original analyses7 of hospital ad?\nmissions in Birmingham were carried\nwe repeated our analyses with the data\nrestricted to these 4 years. We consid?\nered total daily respiratory admissions\nin Birmingham and fitted models that\ninciuded an intercept term, indicator\nvariables for day of week and season,\nspline smoothers for same-day mean\ntemperature and for temporal trends,\nand one or more pollution covariates.\nWe found that a 30 degree of freedom\nsmoother best described the data. We\nconsidered PM10 with a lag of 0 and\nozone with a lag of 2. With these lag\nstructures, and with each poiiutant considered individ-\nually in the model, the estimated increase in respiratory\nadmissions for an increase of 30 /xg per m3 (interquartile\nozone (interquartile range) 2 days before admission, the\n0.74%)- With both pollutants in the model, the estimate\nhowever, that the analysis with PM10 alone in the model\nwas based on virtually the entire 4-year series (there are\nfew days with missing PM10 data), whereas the analyses\nfor ozone and both pollutants together were based on\nmany fewer days because ozone readings were not avail?\nable in winter.\nOur findings in Minneapolis are in general agreement\nwith the conclusions of an earlier analysis.6 We found an\nassociation between air pollution and hospital admis?\nsions after adjusting for weather and temporal trends.\nBoth ozone and PM10 were associated with admissions\nwhen considered individually or together. We found, in\ncontrast to the earlier analysis, however, that the effect\nof ozone was stronger than the effect of PM10. Moreover,\nthe ozone effect was robust, whereas the effect of PM10\nwas greatly attenuated when S02 and N02, which were\nnot considered in the earlier analysis,6 were entered in\nthe regression together with PM10 and ozone. In Bir?\nmingham, we were unable to find an association be?\ntween air pollution and hospital admissions, as reported\nin a previous study.7 There could be several explana-\ntions. First, we analyzed 2 more years of data; when we\nrestricted analyses to the 4 years of data considered in\nthe original analysis, we found a weak association with a\nlag of 0 for PM10 and a lag of 2 days for ozone. With\ndifferent lag structures, however, the estimated coeffi?\ncients were negative. We controlled for temperature and\ntemporal trends differently from the original analysis,\nand a second possibility is that the results are sensitive to\nthe form in which these covariates are entered into the\nmodel.\nIn conclusion, there was clearly an association be?\ntween air pollution and daily hospital admissions for\nrespiratory diseases in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Of the pol?\nlutants considered, ozone was strongly associated with\ndaily hospital admissions, and this association was robust\nin the sense that it persisted with other pollutants in the\nmodel and was relatively little affected by the degree of\nsmoothing used to control for temporal trends. Although\nhospital admissions, no single one of this group of pol?\nlutants stands out as being more important than the\nothers. Our analyses in Minneapolis showed positive\nassociations between individual pollutants and hospital\nadmissions in regression models, even with multiple\npollutants in the model and when concentrations of\nsome pollutants (for example, S02) were quite low. The\nappropriate interpretation of this finding is that daily\nfluctuations in the concentration of the pollutant re-\nflected fluctuations in the air pollution complex associ?\nated with hospital admissions. In contrast to findings in\nMinneapolis, there was no clear indication of an associ?\nation of air pollution with hospital admissions in Bir?\nmingham in the 6 years of data we examined.\nDriven largely by the regulatory imperative, air pol?\nlution research has focused on single pollutants. This\nresearch has often been opportunistic because the avail?\nable data, which have been collected for regulatory\npurposes, are inadequate to address many issues that arise\nin a research setting. It seems clear, however, on patho-\nphysiologic grounds, that the component constituents of\nair pollution could not act independently of each other\nand of weather. The recent Health Effects Institute\nstudy15 of air pollution and daily mortality in Philadel?\nphia found evidence of the interaction of individual\npollutants with each other and with weather and season.\nIf we are to make further progress in this important area\nof science, the focus must shift from individual pollut?\nants to the consideration of air pollution as a complex\nmixture.\nReferences\n1.
