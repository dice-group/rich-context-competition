    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe slowed growth in national health care spending over the past decade has led analysts to question the extent to which\nthis recent slowdown can be explained by predictable factors such as the Great Recession or must be driven by some\nunpredictable structural change in the health care sector. To help address this question, we first estimate a regression model\nfor state personal health care spending for 1991-2009, with an emphasis on the explanatory power of income, insurance, and\nprovider market characteristics. We then use the results from this simple predictive model to produce state-level projections\nof health care spending for 2010-2013 to subsequently compare those average projected state values with actual national\nspending for 2010-2013, finding that at least 70% of the recent slowdown in health care spending can likely be explained\nby long-standing patterns. We also use the results from this predictive model to both examine the Great Recession's likely\nreduction in health care spending and project the Affordable Care Act's insurance expansion's likely increase in health care\nspending.\n",

For instance, the aver-\nage annual inflation-adjusted growth rate for national health\npartisan passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) has\nmade quantifying the determinants of health care spending\ngrowth quite politically controversial in recent years. For\ninstance, advocates behind the passage of the ACA tend to\ncredit structural changes to the delivery of health care as a\nmain determinant for the recent reduction in health care\nspending,2 whereas others tend to suggest that the Great\nRecession was instead responsible for most of this recent\nreduction in health care spending growth.3\nWhat does the broader literature say about the macro-level\ndeterminants of health care spending? Health economists have\nlong agreed that the introduction of new medical technologies\nover time explains the consistently higher rates of inflation for\nhealth care spending compared with the rest of the economy,\nthough other factors explaining rising health care spending\ninclude rising real income, increasing insurance, and aging of\nthe population.4 More recent analysis has focused on condi-\ntion-related increases in health care spending, with some\nanalyses of the increases in the prevalence of disease and other\nanalyses of the condition-specific increases in spending per\nRegarding the more recent slowdown in health care\nspending first seen in the late 2000s, some broad analysis\nfocuses on the effect of decreases in real income and their\nassociated changes with individuals moving from private\ninsurance coverage to public insurance coverage or\nuninsurance.8 Moreover, other analysis suggests that a tem-\nporary decline in the adoption of expensive new medical\ntechnologies explains some of the recent slowdown (along\nwith the rise in high-deductible plans and Medicaid payment\nreductions) but that prior high growth rates will likely persist\ndue to a sustained pipeline of new technologies.9 Other\nrecent analysis also suggests that changes in benefit design\n1Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA\n2University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBradley Herring, Associate Professor of Health Economics, Department\nof Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of\nEmail: herring@jhu.edu\nof employment-based coverage have had an effect on the\nrecent slowdown in health care spending.10\nOverview of Our Analyses\nOur contribution to this literature examining recent changes\nin health care spending growth is that we not only apply a\nmore systematic approach to modeling long-term health care\nspending but also exploit the wide geographic variation in\ntotal health care spending; see, for instance, the research\nassociated with the Dartmouth Atlas examining geographic\nvariation in Medicare spending.11 Specifically, we focus on\nthe association of health care spending with income, insur-\nance coverage, and provider market characteristics, in which\nwe use a regression-based modeling approach with a rela-\ntively longtime series of data, somewhat similar to that used\nin the modeling of national health care spending.12-14\nHowever, unlike those long-term models that focus on\nnational health care spending, we build on the Center for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the\nActuary's separate analysis of state personal health care\nexpenditures.15 Specifically, we use data for state total health\nHealth Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) data from the CMS\nOffice of the Actuary (as 2009 was the last year these state-\nlevel measures were released) and state-level data for various\nexplanatory characteristics.\nWe then examine the extent to which the recent slowdown\nin health care spending growth since 2009 can be explained\nby changes in these characteristics in our state-level model\nfor health care spending. To do so, we first take these models\nexplaining historical state health care spending (with one\npare their amounts, aggregated from the state level to the\nnational level, with actual national health care spending from\nabout the extent to which these three sets of explanatory\ncharacteristics for income, insurance, and provider markets\nperiod.\nWe also produce estimates of both the likely decrease in\nhealth care spending due to the Great Recession's decline in\nincome and the likely increases in health care spending\ninduced by the ACA's insurance expansions. For the latter,\nwe apply our observed relationships between insurance and\nspending from our model (presented below) to the\nCongressional Budget Office's (CBO) long-run projected\nchanges in health insurance coverage to determine the likely\npercent increase in future health care spending induced by\nthe ACA's insurance expansions. Although the CMS Office\nof the Actuary projects health care spending to increase in\nthe future due to the improving economy and expanded\ninsurance coverage,16,17 with the latter due to the strong\nconnection between insurance coverage and health care\nspending, it does not isolate the independent effects of these\nfactors.\nMethodology\nTo examine these various issues, we first quantify the histori-\ncal relationship between income, insurance coverage, and\nprovider market dynamics and the magnitude of personal\nhealth care spending. Our goal here is not to derive a careful\ncausal effect of any given characteristic on health care spend-\ning in isolation. Instead, our goal is to pull together as much\ncomprehensive data as possible (consistent with known\ncausal predictors of health care spending) to include in one\nsingle relatively straightforward regression model for total\npersonal health care spending.\nSpecifically, we estimate a state-level autoregressive model\nwith health care spending as the dependent variable and state-\nlevel measures of income, insurance coverage, and provider\nmarket characteristics and state fixed effects as the explanatory\ntiguous states, as data for some explanatory variables are\nincomplete for Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia.\nSpecifically, we estimate a regression model incorporating\nfirst-order autocorrelation assumed to have the following form:\nLog HC Inc Ins Prov State\nit it it it i it\nv\n= + + + + +\n     , (1)\nv v N\nit it i t it\n= - ( )\n-\n   \n, ~ , ,\nwhere Log HC\nit\nis the log of real total personal health care\nspending per capita for state i in year t, Inc\nit\nis a set of\nincome measures for state i in year t, Ins\nit\nis a set of health\ninsurance coverage measures for state i in year t, Prov\nit\nis a\nset of provider market measures for state i in year t, and\nState\ni\nis an indicator variable for state i. Because the model\nincorporates an autoregressive process for Log HCit, we\ndo not need to add a time trend variable, particularly\nbecause the model's predicted values of health care spend-\nfunctional form chosen; moreover, a full set of year-\nby-year indicators is not feasible for generating out-of-\nsample predictions.\nThe Yule-Walker estimation method for this autoregres-\nsive model is a two-step process in which a na\u00efve ordinary\nleast squares (OLS) model's residuals (from Equation 1\nalone) first generate an initial estimate of the autoregressive\nparameter, , which, in turn, generates a variance matrix for\nv (as specified in Equation 2). This covariance matrix for v\nthen enables a generalized least squares estimation for coef-\nficients , , and  (from Equation 2).18 Because our empiri-\ncal strategy still incorporates repeated observations over\ntime within each state, we generate robust standard errors\nthat account for this clustering.\nHerring and Trish 3\nBy examining the log of health care spending per capita as the\ndependent variable, each of the regression coefficients can be\ninterpreted as the percent change in spending associated with a\none-unit change in the explanatory variable. The vector of \ncoefficients measure the association of health care spending with\nincome, the vector of  coefficients measure the association with\nhealth insurance coverage, and the vector of  coefficients mea-\nsure the association with the provider market characteristics.\nThe remainder of this section provides details about\neach of these different explanatory measures in this\nregression model. Partly due to data availability (as indi-\ncated below) and partly due to an interest in exploring\nhow the effect of these characteristics might differ over\ntime, we examine regression models for two different\nfor the Characteristics Associated With State Health Care\nSpending\" section presents the results for the explanatory\neffects of these three sets of measures on health care\nspending from these models.\nData for State Health Care Spending\nThe data for state personal health care spending, HCit\nin the\nregression equation above, come from the CMS Office of\nthe Actuary's National Health Expenditures Account data\nseries \"National Health Expenditures Accounts by State of\nResidence\" (hereafter referred to as \"NHEA-S\" to contrast\nwith \"NHEA-H\" for the subsequent \"historical\" data series\nfor nationwide spending). These state-level data are for\ntotal health care spending, regardless of payer, that is, they\nare the sum of Medicare spending, Medicaid spending, pri-\nvate insurer spending, and out-of-pocket spending (whether\ninsured or uninsured). However, the state-level data do not\ninclude data for \"Government Administration and Net Cost\nof Health Insurance\" nor \"Government Public Health\nActivities.\" The NHEA-S data are provided by CMS in\nnominal amounts, but we adjust them (and relevant explan-\natory variables presented below) for inflation using the\nConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)\nby presenting all values in 2014 US dollars.\nData for Explanatory Variables\nIncome. The first set of explanatory variables, Inc\nit\n, is a set of\nthree state income characteristics. One is the state's real per\ncapita income in thousands of dollars. These data are avail-\nable from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Regional Eco-\nnomic Accounts (BEA REA) and, like the CMS NHEA-S\ndata, are presented in 2014 dollars here by adjusting by the\nCPI-U. The second characteristic is the percent of the state\npopulation living below the federal poverty line. These data\nare available from the Census Bureau's Small Area Income\n1994, which were not produced by the Census, are thus\ntrend by year). The third characteristic is the state unemploy-\nment rate. These data are available from the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics Local Area Unemployment (BLS LAU) data. The\nrationale here is the literature demonstrating that people gen-\nerally get healthier in recessions,19 though the relationship\nwith spending is not obvious, as it is possible that higher\nhealth spending (from increased free time) improves health\nor that improved health decreases health care spending.\nInsurance.The second set of explanatory variables, Insit, is a\nset of insurance coverage measures from the March Supple-\nment of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Specifically, we\nproduce estimates of the percent of the state covered by Medi-\ncare or TRICARE, covered by Medicaid or the Children's\nHealth Insurance Program (CHIP), and covered by private\ninsurance (with the remainder uninsured) The main underlying\nrationale here (when controlling for income's effect on afford-\nability) is the \"moral hazard\" effect of increased consumption\nof health care when covered by insurance.20 A secondary\nunderlying rationale here is the differences in prices paid for\nprivate versus public insurance, Medicare versus Medicaid\npublic insurance, and insurance versus uninsurance. TRICARE\nis the program covering the military and their dependents (pre-\nviously known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of\nthe Uniformed Services, or CHAMPUS), and we pool those\ncovered by TRICARE with those covered by Medicare due to\nlimited sample size of the former, especially for small states in\nthe CPS. Similarly, we do not distinguish employment-based\ncoverage from individual (or \"nongroup\") coverage in the pri-\nvately insured category due to small sample sizes.\nWealsoincludeameasureofHealthMaintenanceOrganization\n(HMO) penetration, as HMOs are generally associated with\nResources Group's HealthLeaders/InterStudy (HLIS) survey.\nTo have a consistent measure across the entire period, we define\nHMO penetration as total enrollment in Medicare Part C (ie,\nMedicareAdvantage after 2003), Medicaid HMOs, and private/\ncommercial HMOs divided by the entire population. After pro-\n(assuming a linear trend over time), and divided the total HMO\nenrollment by the total population.\nWe also include a measure of self-reported health, partly\nbecause those with higher expected spending may be more\ninclined to obtain health insurance coverage,23 and therefore\nthere might otherwise be an omitted variable bias for the\nassociation of insurance coverage with health care spending.\nThat said, we are also primarily interested in the direct effect\nof health status on health care spending. Our measure of\nhealth status comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System (BRFSS) question, \"Would you say that\nin general your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or\npoor?\" where we use a measure of the percent of adults\nreporting fair or poor health. Because this question was\nadded to the BRFSS in 1993 and a few states are missing for\ncertain years (specifically, Wyoming in 1993 and Rhode\nIsland in 1994, whereas District of Columbia missing in\nwe only use the 48 contiguous states in our analysis), we\nvations assuming a linear time trend over time. Although we\nwould ideally include additional measures (such as smoking,\nobesity, and related chronic conditions) if available through-\nout this entire time period, self-reported health status has\nbeen shown to be a quite valid measure for other specific\nobjective measures of health, including mortality.24,25\nProviders. The third set of explanatory variables, Prov\nit\n, is a set\nof provider market characteristics for physicians and hospitals.\nOne measure for physicians reflects the malpractice claim envi-\nronment for the state. Specifically, we include an indicator for\nwhether the state has a law in effect to cap noneconomic dam-\nages in jury awards and an indicator for whether the state has a\nlaw in effect to replace joint and several liability with propor-\ntionate share allocation of liability. These data come from Uni-\nversity of Texas Law School Professor Ronen Avraham's\nDatabase of State Tort Law Reforms (DSTLR).26 One underly-\ning rationale here is the direct effect of these reforms on mal-\npractice premiums paid by physicians and the resulting impact\nof these premiums on provider prices, whereas the second\nunderlying rationale here is the indirect effect of legal liability\nrisk on the practice of \"defensive medicine.\" Prior research has\nfound that caps on noneconomic damages decrease health care\nspending, whereas joint and several reforms increase health care\nspending (with the thought that proportionate share allocation\nseems to actually increase risk of lawsuits for physicians, as\nplaintiffs formerly focused on targeting hospitals).27,28\nAsecond measure for physicians is the number of physicians\nper capita, which reflects the equilibrium for both supply and\ndemand. These county-level data are available from the Health\nResources and Services Aministration's (HRSA) Area Health\nspending through welfare improvements in access to care or\ninefficiencies associated with supplier-induced demand,\nwhereas fewer physicians per capita could alternatively increase\nspending through decreased price competition.29\nOne measure for hospitals is the number of general com-\nmunity hospital beds per capita, which also reflects the equi-\nlibriumforbothsupplyanddemand.Thesedataareconstructed\nMore hospital beds could likewise increase spending through\nimproved access or increased supplier-induced demand,\nwhereas fewer hospitals could likewise increase hospital\nprices through increased price competition.30\nAsecond measure for hospitals is a more accurate measure\nwith the rationale that hospitals with increased market power\nwill have higher prices for those with private insurance.\n(We do not have access to these propriety AHA data before\n2000.) Specifically, we first construct a market-level concen-\ntration measure based on the commonly used Herfindahl-\nHirschman Index (HHI) using Core-Based Statistical Areas,\nand their Metropolitan Divisions (CBSD) therein, to define\ngeographic markets and hospital market shares using the\nAHA's private-pay inpatient days aggregated to the hospital\nsystem within the market. For nonmetropolitan areas outside\nCBSDs, we define the market as the nonmetropolitan collec-\ntion of counties within the state. We then take the average of\nthe market-level HHI measures across the state, weighting by\ncounty population. (We use only private-pay inpatient days\nrather than all inpatient days, because market concentration in\nthe Medicare and Medicaid markets would not have an effect\non Medicare or Medicaid prices.)\nWe also examine a measure of average insurer market con-\ncentration within the state using data available from HLIS for\nboth Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and HMO data\nenrollment are only available from HLIS for 2005 onward).\nThe rationale here is that insurers with increased market power\nwill negotiate lower physician and hospital prices.31 (Because\nthe CMS state-level NHEA-S data do not include the \"Net Cost\nof Health Insurance\" measures, we would not detect a marginal\neffect of insurer market concentration on the administrative\nmarkup of private premiums.) Similar to our hospital market\nconcentration measure, we construct a market-level HHI defin-\ning geographic markets with CBSDs, using private insurer\nmarket shares from the HLIS census of private insurers and\naveraging these market-level measures across the state using\ncounty population. Because of the relatively short time period\n(which limits the ability of our state fixed-effects analyses to\ndetect relationships), and because this measure of insurer mar-\nket concentration ultimately has an insignificant association\nwith health care spending, we do not show these regression\nconcentration is unrelated to fee-for-service Medicare and\nMedicaid prices, the insignificant result is not unexpected.\nFinally, we include a measure of the percent of the state\npopulation living in a nonmetropolitan area--specifically,\nnot in either Metropolitan or Micropolitan CBSDs, as defined\nby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These\ndata are available from HRSA's AHRF.\nAs noted above, the causal inference of these characteris-\ntics on spending from our analysis is limited by the lack of\nexogenous instruments for the explanatory variables (and\nthereby subject to possible reverse causality). Although an\nexplanation for higher spending leading to higher income is\nunclear, high spending could lead to increased insurance\ncoverage through a higher demand for insurance or lead to\ndecreased insurance coverage through reduced affordability.\nMoreover, high health care spending could lead to increased\nconsumer demand for HMOs, attenuating our expected\nresult. Endogeneity is also a concern for our provider mea-\nsures, in that high spending could lead to an increase in the\nsupply of physicians and hospitals, thereby likely biasing the\nHerring and Trish 5\nsupply measures' relationship upward but biasing the market\nconcentration measure's relationship downward.\nResults for the Characteristics\nAssociated With State Health Care\nSpending\nTable 1 presents the mean values for all of these state-level\nmeasures described in the \"Methodology\" section. As noted\nabove, the unit of observation in this table and in our subse-\nquent regression analyses is the state \u00d7 year, and the sample\nincludes the 48 contiguous states.

Overall, the two data series track\neach other closely with deviations potentially explained by\nthe NHEA-S data we present omitting Alaska, Hawaii, and\nDistrict of Columbia and perhaps by subsequent minor revi-\nsions to the NHEA-H data series after the 2009 NHEA-S\ndata were finalized (and thus not subsequently revised).\nsion model are shown in red in the figure for 1991 through\n2009 period with the available income, insurance, and pro-\nvider explanatory variables generates a predicted value of\ninflation-adjusted 2014 US$). The state-level regression\nvariables along with hospital market concentration generates\na slightly higher predicted value of $8150 for real per capita\nincluded in the figure. These estimates for 2013 (and addi-\ntional ones described below) are shown in Table 4.\nWhile actual real per capita health care spending from the\n2013 health care spending have been in the absence of the\nrecent slowdown in the growth rate? One counterfactual\n(shown in green in Figure 1) is that the 2009 value for real\nUS$) could have grown at a real rate of 3.0%, equal to the\nshown in the first row of Table 4). As a result, $603 (ie,\nFigure 1. Comparison of actual spending and counterfactual spending with the 1991-2009 prediction model.\nNote.

In other words, fully 98%\n(ie, $603/$613) of the recent slowdown in health care spend-\ning can perhaps be explained by the predictable characteris-\ntics rather than structural changes to the health care sector.\nthat 73% of the recent slowdown that can be explained by\npredictable factors.) Graphically, almost all of 2013's differ-\nence between the blue and green lines can be explained by\nthe difference between the red and green lines. This finding\nis dependent on the assumption made above about the unob-\nserved counterfactual growth rate in spending if the recent\nslowdown in spending had not actually occurred. If a higher\n(or lower) trend were assumed, the percentage spending\nreduction explained by the model would decrease (or\nincrease).\nWe also explore the extent to which the Great Recession\nversus other known characteristics appears responsible for the\nrecent decline in health care spending. To do so, we produce a\ncounterfactual level of per capita income in 2013 as if the Great\nRecession had not occurred, and determine the level of pre-\ndicted health care spending at that higher level of income. (We\nessentially assume that the poverty rate and unemployment rate\nreturned to \"natural\" levels by 2013, but the recession caused a\nsustained decline in income.) Specifically, we estimate that real\nobserved). Based on the 0.51 income elasticity observed in the\nexpected health care spending in the absence of the Great\nRecession (as shown in Table 4), which then suggests that the\nlikely permanent decline in real per capita income is responsi-\nble for 41% of the slowdown in health care spending, that is,\nthe other known characteristics in the model combined to\nexplain 57% of the predictable decline (to sum up to 98%). A\nthat 42% of the slowed growth can be explained by the Great\nRecession, whereas 32% of the slowed growth can be explained\nby other known characteristics (to sum up to 73%).\nFinally, we use the regression results from the \"Results\nfor the Characteristics Associated With State Health Care\nSpending\" section to produce estimates of the likely increases\nin personal health care spending associated with the ACA's\nMedicaid expansions. To do so, we rely on projections of the\nACA's likely changes in health insurance coverage from the\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO), supplemented with\ninsurance coverage data for Medicare and TRICARE from\nthe Current Population Survey. The first column of the top\npanel of Table 5 shows CBO's recent estimates of insurance\ncoverage in 2019 if the ACA were not in effect, whereas the\nsecond column of Table 5's top panel shows CBO's estimates\ninstance, CBO estimates that after the ACA is fully imple-\nmented, those who are uninsured will decrease from 14.7%\nof the US population to 7.8% of the population, and that\nTable 4.

That is, the level of spending in\n2019 is expected to be, averaging these two estimates, about\n1.0% higher with the ACA's Medicaid expansions than it\nwould be without theACA's Medicaid expansions. Practically,\nbecause CBO anticipates that insurance expansions will grad-\nwould be seen in slightly higher annual growth rates for health\nConclusion\nUsing data from the CMS NHEA-S data series for 1991-\n2009, we find that a number of state-level characteristics are\nsignificantly associated with state personal health care\nspending. These include real income, the percent in poverty,\nthe percent insured by Medicaid, HMO penetration, mal-\npractice reform to joint and several rules, the number of phy-\nsicians and hospitals, and the percent of the population\nresiding in nonmetropolitan areas. Our take is that the mag-\nnitudes of these estimates are both mostly comparable\nconsistent with the literature (when it exists for a given\ncharacteristic).\nAlthough there is value to these estimates, in and of them-\nselves, there are also interesting policy implications from\napplying these findings to recent and anticipated health care\nspending. Specifically, when comparing actual and counter-\nusing state-level variation in explanatory income, insurance,\nand provider characteristics, we find that at least 70%, if not\nall, of the recent slowdown in health care spending appears to\nbe explained by these predictable factors (although this find-\ning relies on the assumption made about the unobserved\ngrowth in counterfactual spending). The most important one\nof these factors appears to be the Great Recession's effect on\nreduced real per capita income and the subsequent effect on\nreduced health care spending, as about 41% of the recent\nslowdown can be explained by these reductions in income.\nOur findings are therefore consistent with other research that\nfinds that the recession's decline in income is a major influ-\nence on health care spending.3,8 Second, when applying our\nregression model's estimates for the relationship between\nMedicaid coverage and health care spending to the CBO's\nprojections of changes in Medicaid coverage resulting from\ntheACA's insurance expansions, we find that the level of total\nhealth care spending in 2019 is likely to be about 1% higher\nthan it would have been in the absence of these expansions.\nAuthors' Note\nThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors\nand do not necessarily represent the views of the Mercatus Center.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nresearch was funded by George Mason University's Mercatus Center.\nTable 5.
