With few excep-\ntions,notablyintheworkofDavidByrneandEmmaUprichard\napproaches have not converged, either philosophically or\nmethodologically. In this article, we make a modest attempt,\nthrough an empirical example, to show how complexity and\nrealism do converge, but also how that convergence can be\nharnessed to produce novel and useful understandings of\nmicro- and meso-level social change.\nThis article will proceed as follows: we will begin by restat-\ning the case for a realist approach to social research and intro-\nduce some suggested modifications to what has become the\ndominant view of realism in social science \u00ad that of `critical\nrealism'. In two further brief sections, we outline some features\nof probability theory and complexity that might be incorporated\ninto a complex-realist approach to social investigation.\nFollowing this, we provide an empirical example of how social\ncontinuity and change can be demonstrated using a complex-\nrealist approach to researching the trajectories of prisoners at\nrisk of self-harm.\nRealism, complexity and probability\nRealism\nThrough the 20th century, realism has offered an alternative\nparadigm in scientific thinking to that of idealism and\npositivism, and their variants (Harr\u00e9, 1986). It differs from\nthese (which would include phenomenology, logical positiv-\nism, instrumentalism, etc.) by equally privileging the issue of\nwhat exists, alongside our warrant to know what exists. That\nis, it reinstates ontology, which has been denied or postponed\nin rival philosophies of science. To its critics, this is a leap of\nfaith for it requires the theorisation of non-observables and\ntheir treatment as entities, or potentially so. In much of the\nearlier discussions of realism (see, for example, Potter,\n1996), entities were seen as simplified physical things or\nforces, capable of measurement. Relativist critics of realism,\nin social science, referred to this as the `death and furniture'\nargument, suggesting that social processes were dynamic,\ncomplex and, most of all, socially constructed and inevitably\ninterpreted (Potter, 1996). In the natural sciences, this was\nalready a bit of a straw person; where realist interpretations\nof wave\u00adparticle duality, in quantum physics, posited an\ninteraction between observer and the collapse of the wave\nfunction. In other words, the issues raised by unobservables\nin the physical world were meat and drink to realist philoso-\nphers of natural science. It has been a long while since the\nComplex realism in social research\nMalcolm Williams1 and Wendy Dyer2\n Keywords\nComplexity, realism, probability, prisoner self-harm, trajectory, longitudinal analysis, case based cluster analysis\n1Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK\n2Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK\nCorresponding author:\nMalcolm Williams, School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University Glamorgan\nBuilding, King Edward VII Avenue, Cardiff CF10 3WT Wales, UK\nEmail: williamsmd4@cardiff.ac.uk\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\nphysicist, in the laboratory, was able to rely on his or her own\nsenses for empirical confirmation or falsification!\nHowever, Potter and other relativists do have a point\nabout the social world, in that not only is it endlessly dynamic\nbut its existence and its development depend on human inter-\naction and, at root, individual action born of interpretation.\nAs Norman Denzin (1983) claimed, there is an `inherent\nindeterminateness in the lifeworld' (p. 133). This is a seduc-\ntive claim and one often deployed against realism. But, on\nthe other hand, a moment's reflection shows this to be a\nclaim too far. To begin with, supporters of social indetermin-\nism must explain how it is that social order exists and is\nmaintained and, perhaps paradoxically, how sometimes it\nbreaks down or changes quite dramatically. Added to this, if\nthe world was so indetermined and simply a product of con-\nsciousness (as Denzin goes on to claim), then the constraints\nthat prevent us from doing just as we wish (laws, rules, sanc-\ntions and physical constraints created by humans) should be\nroutinely capable of transcendence, but they are not.\nSocial science variants of realism do, however, seem to go\nthe other way,1 with what might be described as a `strong'\nversion of causality that depends on natural necessity. Critical\nrealism, the dominant variety in social science, relies on the\nidea of `causal powers' (elsewhere often referred to as `dis-\npositions'; Mumford, 2007). These can be either passive or\nactive, depending on context. Take the example of `labour\npower', used by Andrew Sayer (1992) \u00ad in his words,\nThe nature or constitution of an object and its causal powers are\ninternally or necessarily related: a plane can fly by virtue of its\naerodynamic form, engines etc; gunpowder can explode by\nvirtue of its unstable chemical structure; multinational firms can\nsell their products dear and buy their labour cheap by virtue of\noperating in several countries with different levels of\nHowever, gunpowder and multinational firms have quite\ndifferent kinds of dispositional properties. The unstable\nchemical structure of gunpowder can be explained by a rela-\ntively small number of environmental contingencies, them-\nselves grounded in physical laws, whereas multinational\nfirms are time-specific evolving and their dispositions\nexplained only in relation to other evolving structures, them-\nselves having a dispositional character.\nIn order to work, people must sell their labour, or make a\nproduct that they can sell, and there has to be a demand for\ntheir labour, or product. A person may possess labour power,\nbut the circumstances under which this may be activated or\nsustained can vary enormously. At no point can we specify a\nset of conditions necessary to the exercise of labour power,\nthough of course we might specify sufficient conditions.\nPowers must be realised under particular circumstances, but\ntheir necessity is ever elusive.\nCritical realism and its variants face both an ontological\nparadox and an epistemological one. The ontological one is\nthat the strong version of causality they propose is (at least\napparently) deterministic, yet the causal powers responsible\nare indeterministic. The `real' world is ontologically indeter-\nministic, yet structured. It is complex.\nComplexity\nSome systems in the world are deterministic and most of\nthese are more closely bound by fundamental physical laws,\nsuch as gravity and thermodynamics. They will never be\nentirely deterministic because local variations of (say) air\npressure or material construction will intervene. Some phe-\nnomena are wholly stochastic, for example, particles sus-\npended in a fluid (described as Brownian motion), some are\napparently stochastic, but through time some patterning can\nbe discerned, and others, though exhibiting some degree of\nrandomness, nevertheless exhibit order and form over time.\nIndeed, all phenomena that might be described probabilisti-\ncally exhibit some degree of stochastic behaviour. Karl\nwhen he contrasted the behaviour of clouds with that of\nclocks. The former have measurable properties, but these can\nonly be approximately known and measured through time,\nwhereas clocks (and he meant old-fashioned clockwork\nclocks) have relatively precise mechanisms that behave in a\nreliable and predictable way. Some systems, he goes on to\nsay, are more like clouds and some more like clocks.\nThis is a good analogy for the social world, in which its\ncomponents are mostly more cloud than clock like, yet some\nparts of it will veer towards `clockness', while others hardly\nachieve the recognisable form of clouds.\nClocks are complicated systems, so are mobile phones,\nmotorbikes and space shuttles, but they are not complex \u00ad their\nbehaviour and properties are not subject to influence of ran-\ndom variables (at least when they are working properly)\n(Cilliers, 1998). Clouds are, and so are most phenomena in the\nsocial world. This distinction is at the heart of the development\nof `chaos theory', and complexity, in the last 50years. The dis-\ncovery of `chaos' was in the behaviour of weather systems.\nWell into the 20th century, meteorologists subscribed to the\nview that if we knew enough about initial conditions, we\nwould be able to predict and even control the weather. But in\nthe 1960s, scientists modelling weather found that very slight\nchanges in initial conditions could bring about huge changes\nof chaos heralded a whole new way of thinking about the natu-\nral (and later social) world. Researchers noted how relatively\nstable systems in weather, oceans and biological systems\ncould change suddenly, or descend into apparent disorder, and\nconversely, how apparently stochastic systems could become\nordered. Complex systems, exhibiting such characteristics,\nexist throughout nature in the development of galaxies to cell\ndivision (Kauffman, 1995). There is much to say about chaos\nand complexity, but for our purposes, it is enough to make a\nfew observations about the social world that suggest that it and\nits components are a quintessentially complex system.\nWilliams and Dyer 3\nThe first thing to note is that despite what the social con-\nstructionists would say, it is possible to explain and predict\nthe social world, partly because it is rule based and partly\nbecause agents in it act inductively on past experience, which\nmostly exhibits a large degree of predictability. In other\nwords, in our everyday lives, we are aware of and (mostly)\nobey social rules, and those people with whom we interact\nalso do this and exhibit relatively predictable behaviour. This\npermits good enough lay explanations and predictions. It is\nmostly not stochastic. Social scientists, who wish to produce\nexplanations and predictions with a greater precision, see a\nworld that exhibits both continuity and change, but is also\ncharacterised by similarity and difference across social strata\nand time. It is fashionable to say that social scientists study\nsocial change, but in order to do this, they must also explain\nsocial stability. Stability is not stasis and will be disturbed\neventually to one extent or another. As Harvey and Reed\n(cited in Byrne, 1998: 23) put it, in the absence of significant\nperturbations, systems will follow a normal trajectory, but if\ndisrupted, random fluctuations may arise. Our clock analogy\nhas one further use: a mechanical clock, with a pendulum, is\na relatively precise and predictable instrument, but if you\ndisturb the pendulum, it will fluctuate randomly and, depend-\ning how much you disturbed it, that degree of randomness\npersists for a greater or lesser period, until it returns to equi-\nlibrium. Whack it hard enough and the `randomness' may\npreclude a return to equilibrium, because you have broken it!\nComplexity theorists employ a vocabulary of `Strange\nAttractors' and `Phase Space' to describe this. Strange\nAttractors, in complexity theory, refers to time-ordered pat-\nterns towards which other trajectories converge. Strange\nAttractors can be understood to exist within `Phase Space',\nthe space of the possible where anything can happen but not\neverything will happen given the structured, rule-driven\nnature of the social:\nThe geometry of dynamical systems takes place in a mental\nspace, known as phase space. It's very different from ordinary\nphysical space. Phase space contains not just what happens but\nwhat might happen under different circumstances. It's the space\nThe social world can therefore be thought of as overlap-\nping, or multi-dimensional, `phase spaces', with different\nprobabilities and trajectories of change.\nFor example, some social institutions, or practices, may\nexist for centuries, changing only slightly, because they have\nnot been `disturbed'. Others exist so briefly they are hardly\nnamed or recognised because they are greatly disturbed.\nCompare, for example, the institutions of a country in flux,\nsuch as Somalia, with the stability of Switzerland.\nThese kinds of comparisons are popular with those who\nwrite about social complexity (and rightly so), but this works\nbetter for historians or political scientists than it does for\nsocial researchers attempting to describe and explain social\nlife at the micro- or meso-level. In particular, how do the\nspecific changes and interactions at individual level create,\nmaintain, change or destroy specific local systems? We use\nthe term `systems'as a portmanteau term to describe ways of\ndoing things, mores, customs, rules \u00ad the reality of social life\nas experienced and acted upon by agents. Although the\nexplanation of continuity is crucial (why does the social tra-\njectory of an institution or practice remain undisturbed?), to\ndo this, we need to know what is going on at the point of\nchange and how that point of change is (seemingly) related\nto further change. Unlike Hume, who said that the striking of\none billiard ball against another is no warrant to claim the\ncause of the second moving was the striking of the first, as\nrealists, we want to theorise a system (or mechanism) that\nwill provide an explanation. Thus, measurement, in complex\nsystems, is an important aspect of realist `closure'.\nProbability\nWe noted that stochastic systems are described by probabil-\nity. Objective probability (as opposed to subjective, or\nBayesian probability) takes both an epistemological and an\nontological form. The first is familiar to us, through the sam-\nple survey, and is known as the frequency theory of probabil-\nity. A probabilistic sample of a given population can\nstatistically describe that population, within certain known\nand calculable tolerances. Those tolerances are described in\nthe error terms of a sample and are subject to the law of large\nnumbers. Roughly speaking, the larger the sample, the\nsmaller the error term. That is, the bigger the sample, the bet-\nter it will resemble the population. However, a sample can\ntell us nothing about the individual units (often people)\nbecause they are an `ideal' unit, that is, we do not have data\non all members of a population and we could substitute one\nrandom sample for another, within which those in the second\nmay or may not have been in the first.\nThere is another version of objective probability that is\nontological in character and better mirrors what is meant by\n`probability' in relation to complex systems (Gillies, 2000:\nof complex systems may be probabilistic (in the first, episte-\nmological, sense), it is the very character of the systems and\ncomponents of systems that are themselves probabilistic in\ncharacter. To fully grasp this, we need to consider what we\nmean by probability, in relation to certainty. The probability\nof an event always lies on a continuum between 0 and 1. Zero\nis the impossibility of an event and one is its necessity. All\nprobabilities eventually resolve themselves into zeros or\nones. So, for example, an accused person will have a proba-\nbility of conviction, which may change as a trial progresses,\nbut eventually will evolve into a `One' when the judge pre-\nsents his or her verdict. That One may be `guilty' or `not\nguilty'. To continue the hypothetical story, the One of `guilty'\nor 'not guilty' will then set the probability of future events,\nsuch as going to prison, re-offending (if guilty), personal\nstigma and so on. Also, the verdict is not neutral in respect of\n4 Methodological Innovations\nthe other agents involved, such as family members, police\nofficers, co-accused, victims and so on. Each of their life tra-\njectories will be `perturbed' and the probabilities of future\nevents initially set, or changed. In other words, the probabili-\nties are `nested' and changed at each bifurcation (such as the\njudgement of guilty or `not guilty').\nThe story so far\nBefore introducing the empirical example, let us summarise\nthe theoretical and methodological case we are making.\nThe reality of the social world is that it is indeterminate. As\none of us has argued elsewhere (Williams, 2011), there are\nno necessary conditions in the social world, but rather there\nare different levels of sufficiency, enough to produce out-\ncomes. In the physical world, such grounding exists in fun-\ndamental laws such as gravity or thermodynamics\noutcomes exist within relatively stable rule-bound social\nstructures, but change comes about as a result of perturba-\ntions \u00ad the greater the perturbation, the greater the change.\nIt follows that probability is not just an epistemological\nmatter of describing or predicting change, the social world\nitself is probabilistic, with some things very much more\nprobable than others. Within `phase space', all outcomes\nare possible, but some are very much more probable than\nothers. Yet it is often the `improbable' outcome that brings\nabout greater change. The challenge is to develop a method\nthat can follow these changes, or map these trajectories, in\nactual systems over time.\nExample \u00ad mapping the trajectories of\nprisoner repeat self-harm\nBackground\nThe data presented in this example were originally collected as\npart of a National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)-funded\nresearch project one of us was involved with which aimed to\nidentify a set of characteristics to assess future risk of self-\nharm in adult male and female prisoners (Horton et al., 2014).\nPrisoners are at increased risk of self-harm (Fazel et al., 2011;\nall prisoners experience the same level of risk; in particular,\nthere are a small number of prisoners who are responsible for\na large number of self-harm events. Much of the research and\ntheories in the area of self-harm broadly derive from the `Cry\nof Pain'model (Williams, 1997) which suggests self-harm is a\nbehavioural response to a stressful situation with three compo-\nnents which interact to increase risk, namely, (1) the presence\nof defeat, (2) no escape or entrapment, and (3) no rescue. At a\ngeneral level, prisoners share similar sociodemographic char-\nacteristics and all experience the `pains of imprisonment'\nprisoners at `ultra-high risk' of repeated self-harm?\nAs we noted above, the social world is neither simply\ndeterminate nor chaotically indeterminate or stochastic.\nCases (in this case prisoners) will experience periods of rela-\ntive stability and periods of change where, dependent upon\nperturbations or `disturbances' in their current conditions,\ntheir lives will bifurcate along different pathways (in this\ncase to repeat self-harm or not). Prisoners are not one single,\nhomogeneous group but instead consist of different groups\nor types of people, some of whom share common patterns of\nexperiences and individual characteristics. Rather than one\n`cry of pain' model, how different groups of prisoners cope\nwith perturbations caused by the `pains of life', including\nimprisonment, will be different, but within groups, their\nshared experiences give rise to the same or similar outcomes.\nIn other words, while we can identify the immediate pertur-\nbations that cause the self-harm, as in a Markov chain, these\ninitially appear to be independent of patterns of prior events.\nThe aim of this research was to identify different groups or\ntypes of prisoner where membership (described by shared\npatterns of experiences and personal characteristics) meant\nthey were at increased or decreased probability of repeated\nself-harm in prison.\nMethodology and method\nThis search for prisoner groups or typologies that are more or\nless likely to repeatedly self-harm is akin to the search for\n`Strange Attractors' described earlier in this article. Such\n`prisoner self-harm attractors' (in a metaphorical sense)\nemerge over time as shared individual characteristics such as\nresilience and coping (the hidden mechanism in Realism),\nwhich develop iteratively as a consequence of common\nexperiences (the contexts in Realism), mean that pathways or\npersonal trajectories converge. Strange Attractors describe a\nseries of bifurcations in systems, for example, in turbulence\nflow, which produces patterns, shapes or likenesses. In this\ncase, it is people who are more like one another than they are\nlike people in other attractors. These underlying patterns or\n`prisoner self-harm attractors' exist within Phase Space \u00ad the\nmacro-level conception of context within which are micro\nmultiple overlapping contexts or `state spaces'. These con-\ntexts include prisoners' previous experiences which impact\non the development of individual characteristics, including\nindividual vulnerabilities, resilience and coping, and how\nthey interact with the current prison environment (Griller,\nFigure 1 (a conceptual model or abstraction of the complex-\nrealist `space' within which prisoner self-harm pathways can\nbe understood).\nThis framework informed the development of the research\nstudy:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 From data collection: where a multi-stage prospective\ncohort study recorded data (including personal experi-\nences, thoughts, feelings and actions) describing the\nWilliams and Dyer 5\n`history' and `current' micro-contexts or state spaces\nfor male and female prisoners aged 18 and above who\nwere on an Assessment, Care in Custody, and\nTeamwork (ACCT \u00ad a Prison Service Instruction\n2012, which describes the process involved in super-\nvising the management of prisoners at risk of harm to\nself, to others and from others) (Ministry of Justice\nand National Offender Management Service, 2012),\nand a 6-month follow-up determined self-harm occur-\nrence since baseline;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To data analysis: where logistic regression analysis\nrevealed gender-specific characteristics that were sta-\ntistically significant in identifying prisoners who were\ninvolved with repeat self-harm, and which mapped\ndirectly onto a number of gender-specific prisoner\nself-harm typologies or attractors, uncovered using a\ntime-ordered cluster analysis method developed by\nResults\nThe results described four male and four female prisoner self-\nharm attractors defined by a number of bifurcation points\n(including history, current and future), where key experiences\nand personal characteristics \u00ad such as a history of self-harm\noutside of prison and/or within prison, a history of contact\nwith a psychiatrist, current feelings of self-blame and inability\nto concentrate \u00ad are responsible for perturbations in the trajec-\ntory which led prisoners down one pathway which included\nrepeat self-harm or another other with no repeat self-harm.\nThe first male trajectory (see Figure 2) describes the shared\nexperience and characteristics of those prisoners all of whom\nrepeated self-harm during the 6-month follow-up. This is a key\nAttractor which gives clues to the increased probability of\nrepeat self-harm in this high-risk prisoner population when\ncompared with the other Attractors, which map the trajectories\nof those who do not repeat self-harm during the follow-up. The\nkey differences or points of perturbation between the two most\nsimilar male prisoner Attractors 1 (where everyone went on to\nrepeat self-harm) and 4 (where no one went on to repeat self-\nharm) are the presence or absence of a previous experience of\nprison ACCT monitoring, and the presence or absence of a\nnumber of key experiences and personal characteristics labelled\nas `risk and protective factors'in the original study.\nFindings from the study of male prisoners at ultra-high risk\nof repeat self-harm suggest the probability of a negative out-\ncome is greatly reduced for those in Attractors 2 and 3 who\nhave no previous experience of self-harm or ACCT monitor-\ning in prison and who report more positive thoughts, feelings,\nactions and experiences, and fewer negative ones. A number\nof factors identified as greatly increasing the probability of a\nnegative outcome are shared by bothAttractors 1 and 4 includ-\ning a history of previous self-harm, contact with a Psychiatrist\nand current feelings of self-blame and inability to concentrate.\nHowever, those in Attractor 4 are much less likely to repeat\nself-harm because they also report a number of features in\naddition to no previous experience of prison ACCT monitor-\ning which `protect'them from this negative outcome including\nhaving obtained academic or vocational qualifications and\ncurrent access to support from prison healthcare.\nFigure 1. A conceptual model of the Phase Space of prisoner self-harm attractors.\n6 Methodological Innovations\nInterpreting the female attractors is a more difficult under-\ntaking, not least because the risk and protective factors iden-\ntified by the original logistic regression do not map as clearly\nonto the female attractors, again uncovered using a time-\nordered cluster method, as they did for the male attractors.\nThe first female trajectory (see Figure 3) describes the shared\nexperience and characteristics of those who repeated self-\nharm during the 6-month follow-up. The key points of per-\nturbation between the two most similar female prisoner\nAttractors 1 (where everyone went on to repeat self-harm)\nand 4 (where no one went on to repeat self-harm) which\nincrease the probability of repeat self-harm include\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A consistent history of previous contact with a psy-\nchiatrist and current mental health symptoms such as\nauditory hallucinations,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A history of scratching as a specific form of self-harm\nand current episodes of binge eating,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The experience of previous prison ACCT monitoring,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A significant current prison sentence such as life\nimprisonment or an indeterminate sentence,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Reports of negative personal actions such as recent\nepisodes of binge eating, physical assault on others\nand various forms of self-harm especially scratching\nbut also including cutting, head banging, burning, pre-\nventing wounds from healing and making medical\nsituations worse.\nThere is one risk factor shared by Attractors 1 and 4 which\nincreases the probability of repeat self-harm and this involves\nthe receipt of any form of outside communication, that is, fam-\nily visits, phone calls and letters. Attractor 4 also experiences\nmuch more consistent negative `symptoms' compared with\nattractor 1, but which includes negative thoughts and feelings\n(including `over the last week talking to people has felt too\nmuch for me', `anxiety has prevented me doing important\nthings', `I have felt panic', `made plans to end my life', and\n`felt overwhelmed by my problems') rather than actions (as in\nattractor 1, including `during the last week I had episodes of\nbinge eating', `over the last week I have been physically violent\nto others'and `I have scratched myself on purpose'), and which\ncommon sense might argue should put them at greatly increased\nprobability of a negative outcome. However, female prisoners\nin Attractor 4 did not go on to repeat self-harm during follow-\nup, which suggests that the key features which `protect' them\nfrom this negative outcome include no previous experience of\nprison ACCT monitoring and that reporting negative thoughts\nand feelings is not the same as actually acting on them.\nFigure 2. Adult male prisoner self-harm trajectories (pathways between clusters).\nWilliams and Dyer 7\nThis empirical example demonstrates how the application of\na complex-realist framework and associated methodology and\ntechniques can uncover patterns of similarity and difference at\nthe level of individual cases which, rather than suggesting the\nsocial world is either deterministic or stochastic, demonstrates\nthat common or shared contextual experiences and the hidden\nmechanism of personal characteristics lead to common or\nshared outcomes. This being the case, rather than applying the\n`cry of pain' model at a macro- or generalised level, we could\nuse data for individual prisoners with similar experiences to cal-\nculate the likely probability of future repeat self-harm events.\nThe methodological possibility of\ncomplex realism\nThe above examples demonstrate how within a relatively\n`contained' phase space, change occurs and patterns are\nestablished. There is an absence of necessity in these trajec-\ntories because they can be changed as a result of relatively\nminor perturbations (e.g. a history of previous ACCT moni-\ntoring). Yet what we witness is the reality of a complex\ncausal system operating through time. Although, here, the\nprobabilities themselves have not been measured, the clus-\ntering itself demonstrates that some events are very much\nmore likely to happen than others. The history of ACCT\nmonitoring in individuals, played out through bifurcations in\nrespect of variables through time, demonstrates patterns,\nwhich are not necessary (in the realist sense), but those pat-\nterns do coalesce into `Strange Attractors' (in a metaphorical\nsense), which in turn are predictors of continuing stability.\nThe reality of this world described is neither deterministic\nnor indeterministic, but complex.\nFor a long while, the methodologies of realism and com-\nplexity have promised much, but in both cases, empirical\nclosure has been elusive. In the first case, this has been hin-\ndered by the insistence on a principle of natural necessity\nand then the difficulty in demonstrating this satisfactorily\nthrough method. In the second case, a convincing broad\nbrush approach to macro-level phenomena can demonstrate\ncomplexity at work in its outcomes, but not its process. The\nexample above is an attempt to show complex social change\nat work at a meso-level. Unlike analyses based on sample\nFigure 3. Adult female prisoner self-harm trajectories (pathways between clusters).\n8 Methodological Innovations\ndata, which must produce probability estimates based on the\nideal units of a sample, this method follows the trajectory of\ncases through time and maps the interactions with key\nevents and features in the social world. It demonstrates the\nbifurcating points of change and how these contribute to\nfuture patterns and change. By taking slices through time,\nwe are sampling an actual reality. In this sense, the method\nis truly realist.\nAbove, we asked the question of whether there could be a\ncomplex realism that is based upon an ontology of probability.\nThisseemstobedemonstratedintheaboveexample,andindeed,\nthis, we believe, can give us warrant to be realist about entities\nbecause we are able to demonstrate the process of change and\nstability through the trajectories of individuals as cases.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
