The data came from the Virtual\nInternational Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) collabor-\nation19 and the Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke\nMethods\nData sources\nThe included patients came from the VISTA-ICH arch-\nive, which includes data from a number of completed\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs)19 and the acute\nENOS BP trial.20,21 Patients were those with spontan-\neous ICH, as diagnosed locally using routine neuroima-\nging, and who were treated within 6 h of onset. We\nincluded patients allocated to the control group in\nENOS, as patients assigned to intervention are not\nincluded in VISTA. Patients were excluded if:\nage < 18, ICH attributed to trauma, planned surgical\nevacuation, previously dependent (modified Rankin\nScale, mRS ! 2), concurrent illness with life expectancy\n<6 months, pregnant or breast feeding women, and\nthose already participating in a study involving another\ndrug or device.\nBaseline data\nData at baseline were obtained for age, sex, time from\nictus to treatment, medical history (previous stroke,\nhypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus,\nhypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, and prior\nantithrombotic use), level of consciousness (Glasgow\nComa Scale, GCS), stroke severity (National\nInstitutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS), systolic\nblood pressure (SBP), and heart rate. Race (and ethni-\ncity) was defined as Asian (Filipino, Oriental, Asian,\nIndian, Palestinian, and Arabic), Black (Black,\nAfrican/American, Caribbean), Caucasian (White or\nCaucasian), and Others (American Indian, mixed-\ncolored, mixed, Hispanic, colored, Hawaiian and\nPacific Islanders).\nOutcome data\nOutcome at day 90 was assessed using the mRS and all-\ncause mortality; where available, data on disability\n(Barthel Index, BI) and quality of life (European qual-\nity of Life-5 dimensions, EQ-5D) were also assessed.\nNeuroimaging\nDepending on trial protocol, CT scans were performed\nfollowing treatment and then again at 72 h.\nInformation from CT scans was collected for hemor-\nrhage location, lesion volume, edema volume, presence\nof mass effect, subarachnoid bleeding, intraventricular\nhemorrhage, brain atrophy, and leukoaraiosis.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary outcome was the mRS at day 90. Baseline\ncharacteristics and outcomes were compared by\nPearson 2 test for categorical variables and analysis\nof variance for continuous variables. The relationship\nbetween baseline hematoma volume and mRS between\nethnic groups was analyzed using multiple regression.\nIndividual comparisons between ethnic groups were\nmade using Bonferroni correction. Mortality was\nassessed using Kaplan\u00adMeier curves and Cox\nRegression. Analyses were adjusted for age, NIHSS,\nICH volume, and time to treatment. Confidentiality\nagreements precluded identification of the individual\ntrials in VISTA-ICH and so analyses were not adjusted\nfor trial. Since death is present in outcome scores such\nas mRS (6), HUS (0), and BI (\u00c05), death was scored for\nEuropean quality of life-visual analogue scale\n(EQ-VAS) as \u00c01. Statistical significance was set at\np 0.05.

Less than 2% were in the `other group' and\nthese were removed from further analyses. When ana-\nlyzed by baseline characteristics, Black patients were\nyounger and more likely to have a previous history of\nhypertension and higher SBP at baseline. Caucasian\npatients trended to have more atrial fibrillation, and\nAsian patients were less likely to have a prior history\nof antithrombotic use. The mean ICH volume was\n22.7 cm3 and most hematomas were located in the\ndeep subcortical white matter of the brain (Table 1).\nClinical outcomes\nTable 2 shows clinical and radiological outcome meas-\nures by ethnicity. The primary outcome, mRS, did\nnot differ between race groups at either day 7 or 90\n(Figure 1). Similarly, there was no difference in\nNIHSS during the first seven days. Whilst the BI dif-\nfered at day 7, it was not significant at day 90 using a\ntest of multiple comparisons. Quality of life, assessed\nusing two measures (health utility status derived from\nEQ-5D and EQ-VAS), differed between the three\ngroups (Table 2, Figure 2); following adjustment for\nmultiple comparisons, Caucasians had a worse quality\nof life scores for both EQ-5D and EQ-VAS as com-\npared to Asians (Table 2). Adjusted survival rates dif-\nfered between race\u00adethnicity groups (Table 2, Figure 3),\nexplained by a significant difference between Asians\nand Caucasians (p \u00bc 0.005). There were no other signifi-\ncant differences for other outcomes.\nNeuroimaging outcomes\nICH volume differed across the race groups on both the\nfirst follow-up scan (Table 2, Figure 4) and at 72 h.\n(Table 2); in both cases, Caucasians tended to having\nlarge hematoma (Table 2). Similarly, edema volumes\ndiffered across the race groups on both the first\nfollow-up scan and at day 7 with Caucasian patients\nhave large edema volumes than Black patients. The\npresence of hydrocephalus also differed and was highest\nin Caucasians. The presence of intraventricular hemor-\nrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and midline shift did\nnot differ between the race groups (Table 2).\nWhen assessing the relationship between baseline\nhematoma volume and mRS, there was a significant\ndifference in the slope of the regression lines between\nthe race\u00adethnicity groups; Blacks and Asians appeared\nto have a worse mRS for a given hematoma volume\nwere no other significant differences between any of\nthe other comparison groups.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to examine\nclinical and neuroimaging features and outcomes in\nFigure 1. Distribution of modified Rankin scores between the three race groups at day 90.\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 13(4)\nICH patients across three race groups. Significant dif-\nferences in age, the frequency or previous stroke and\nhypertension, GCS, BP, and ICH volume were present\nbetween Caucasian, Asian, and Black patients.\nSimilarly, differences in neuroimaging features were\npresent for hematoma location and volume, edema\nvolume, and the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage,\nhydrocephalus, leukoaraiosis, and cerebral atrophy.\nAlthough there was no difference in the primary out-\ncome of mRS at day 90, significant differences in case\nfatality and quality of life were present. Similarly, dif-\nferences in ICH and edema volume, and the presence of\nhydrocephalus, were present between the race groups.\nBlack patients were younger and a larger proportion\nhad a history of hypertension which could be associated\nwith increased smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse.17,18 It\nis noteworthy that BP in Blacks was higher on admis-\nsion and probably reflects inadequate control, poor\ncompliance with treatment or treatment resistance.17,23\nHigher BP in the acute phase of ICH is common24 and\nassociated with neurological deterioration through\nhematoma expansion and re-bleeding.24\u00ad26 The treat-\nment implications of racial difference in BP lowering\nneed investigation as evidence suggests that early treat-\nment is both safe and feasible20,27 and is now recom-\nmended in guidelines.28,29 In contrast to a previous\nreport of greater mortality in Blacks for every stroke\nsubtype,30 VISTA\u00adENOS found reduced survival in\nCaucasians with ICH. This finding is difficult to explain\nand may relate to hemorrhage location, inherent sus-\nceptibility to ICH or quality of care or simply that\nrace\u00adethnic differences persist even after controlling\nfor such characteristics.\nAs would be expected, ICH survivors had a quality\nof life worse than that reported in the general popula-\ntion.31,32 The difference between Caucasians and Asians\nhas been reported previously14,33 and may relate to\nfamily values, cultural attitudes, and care prefer-\nences.33,34 In one study, Asians were more likely to be\nliving at home, whilst Caucasians were less likely to be\ndischarged home despite better functional improve-\nment.35 Apart from cultural and family factors, age,\nfemale sex, stroke severity, persistent neglect, and\nsocioeconomic status have also been shown to affect\nThe strengths of the study include a relatively large\nsample size for a study population with detailed clin-\nical, radiological information, and multiple functional\nendpoints. The included patients were from neutral\nRCTs or control group and therefore assessment of\nthe race\u00adethnic differences avoided the confounding\neffects of active treatment. However, there are some\nlimitations. First, the analysis on observational data\nfrom RCTs has the disadvantage that patients were\nFigure 2. Box plots of European Quality of Life-5 dimension-3 level scores at day 90. Comparison by ANOVA 2p < 0.001;\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 13(4)\nincluded on the basis of pre-specified selection\ncriteria. It is possible that those with more severe\nstroke with reduced level of consciousness, older\npatients with multiple comorbidities and pre-existing\ndo not resuscitate orders, may have been excluded.\nTherefore, the results may not be applicable to a popu-\nlation of unselected ICH patients. Second, the VISTA\ncollaboration does not reveal the identities of the indi-\nvidual trials and so it is uncertain as to what inclusion\ncriteria were used to select patients. Additionally, ana-\nlyses could not be adjusted for the source trials, which\nis important since trials themselves are a determinant of\noutcome. Nevertheless, the data were subject to strict\nverification and so the results are externally valid.\nThird, ethnicity relates to culture, geography, language\nand it is not clear from the data if this was self-reported\nor defined by the investigator. Fourth, to compensate\nfor limited numbers, distinct subpopulations were\ngrouped into one ethnic group (for example Asians\nincluded people from China, Philippines, the Indian\nsubcontinent, and Arabian peninsula), whilst small\ngroups present in the `others' category were excluded.\nThis may have not been appropriate as stroke risk and\nfunctional outcome vary within subpopulations living\nin the same country and between countries.38,39 Last,\nthe analysis is limited to trials sharing information\nwithin the collaboration and therefore those studies\nthat are not represented in VISTA would not have\nbeen included.\nIn conclusion, this analysis from hyperacute trials in\nhemorrhagic stroke found significant race differences in\nbaseline clinical characteristics and hematoma meas-\nures. There were no difference in the primary outcome\nof death or dependency but differences in death rates\nand quality of life were apparent. Further studies are\nneeded to which factors explain race\u00adethnic differences\nand whether these differences become larger over time.\nOur results suggest that future trials should undertake\nmeasures to ensure adequate representation of all major\nrace\u00adethnic groups. This might include standard defin-\nitions for race\u00adethnicity that reflect common features\nbut not limited to biological, cultural, and social differ-\nences. Further research is also needed to understand\nwhere inadequacies in health care systems exist and\nwhat interventions can be made to reduce such dispa-\nrities. This could include allowing more resources to\nFigure 3.
