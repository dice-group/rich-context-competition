One of the\nstrategies that could be used to prevent STIs, HIV in particu-\nlar, is the correct and consistent use of condoms. However,\ncondoms are not always used effectively and consistently,\nwhich has led many researchers to investigate this issue\n(Santelli et al., 1997). In addition, despite having much\nknowledge on HIV and AIDS and how it is transmitted, peo-\nple still have unprotected sex with their partners. Even\nthough condom use is one of the elements in the ABC strat-\negy--Abstinence, Be Faithful, and Condom Use--when this\nstrategy was implemented in South Africa, it became clear\nthat it had little or no regard from local culture, especially\nwhen you take into consideration the cultural beliefs that\nwomen are expected to bear children once they are married.\nThis, therefore, makes it nearly impossible for women to\nnegotiate condom use with their partners.\nThe main purpose of this article, therefore, is to explore\nthe views of customarily married housewives to identify how\neasy or difficult it is for them to negotiate condom use with\ntheir husbands. Osuafor and Mturi (2014) stated that custom-\nary marriage takes place when two families are joined\ntogether by the groom and bride through the payment of\nlobola or the bride price. This practice is common among\nBlack SouthAfricans.According to the Department of Social\nDevelopment (2003), marriage symbolizes many social\nideas, and it embodies morality. Moreover, Corvino (2005)\nfurther stated that marriage also result in an accomplishment,\nstability, acceptance, and general good standing in communi-\nties as well as in personal commitment, sexual fidelity, and\nemotional fulfillment. Marriage is often regarded as a protec-\ntive institution when it comes to issues around exposure to\nHIV and AIDS. This study seeks to explore the experiences\nof customarily married housewives in their intimate relation-\nships with regard to condom use negotiation in Katlehong,\nthe East Rand of Gauteng Province in South Africa.\nCondom use has helped in reducing the risk of HIV trans-\nmission (Potts et al., 2008). However, evidence has shown\nthat the use of condoms has remained low, given the rise in\nHIV infection among women, particularly those in steady\nargued that the promotion of condom use among married\ncouples have been neglected despite the fact that HIV is\nmostly infectious through sexual intercourse within marital\n1University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa\nCorresponding Author:\nThobeka S.

It is therefore significant to investigate fac-\ntors related to condom use negotiation among customarily\nmarried women.\nThe Overview of the South African HIV\nEpidemic\nIntroduction\nBrouard, Maritz, and Lazarus (2013) declared that the\nNational Department of Health estimated that in 2011, South\nAfrica was home to approximately 5.6 million people living\nwith HIV (PLHIV)--the highest number of PLHIV of any\ncountry in the world. In addition, using the Actuarial Society\nof South Africa's model for projecting the impact of HIV and\nAIDS on the South African population in general, and find-\nings from household surveys undertaken by the Human\nSciences Research Council (HSRC), are slightly lower but\nbroadly in line with the Joint United Programme on HIV and\nAIDS (UNAIDS) estimates of 5.3 million in addition. In\n2012, the SouthAfrican National HIV Prevalence, Incidence,\nand Behaviour Survey found out that 6.4 million people in\nSouth Africa live with HIV. This figure represents a quarter\nof the burden of HIV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa and\nWomen's Vulnerability to HIV and AIDS\nSouth Africa has been rated among other African countries to\nhave one of the highest incidence and prevalence rates of HIV\nand AIDS in the world (Brouard et al., 2013). According to\nRamjee and Wand (2012), women are particularly heavily\naffected by the epidemic; they are at the greater risk of infec-\ntion due to biological, social, and economic factors. Women\nare also more vulnerable to HIV's and AIDS' impact for sev-\neral reasons, for example, the epidemic's potential of breaking\ndown the relationship between partners, parents, and children.\nFurthermore, Ross and Deverell (2004) argued that due to\nHIV and AIDS, \"families fall apart and burden of sustaining\nthe family life is socially placed on women who are also dis-\nadvantaged by cultural and gender inequalities\" (p. 259).\nIn terms of the risk of exposure to HIV infection, marriage\nis often presented as a protective institution, because it is\nassumed that in marriage, there is a monogamous fidelity\n(Weed, Ericksen, & Birch, 2005). This assumption underlies\nthe traditional belief that when one enters into marriage,\nsexual relationships should be done with the sole marriage\npartner. However, it should be noted that where societies\napply different norms to sexual regulation, marriage becomes\nan institution of vulnerability to HIV infection for women\n(Department of Social Development, 2003). Anecdotal evi-\ndence points to the idea that women continue to have unpro-\ntected sex with their wife even when they know the man has\nother wives. For example, Scamber (2009) stated that some\nmarried men have multiple and concurrent wives who put\ntheir partners at risk of getting infected. In 1998, a South\nAfrican Demographic and Health survey was conducted and\nthe results indicated that condom use in marriage was very\nlow; for example, only 5% of the men on the mines said they\nused condoms with regular partners (Van Dyk, 2008).\nAccording to Hardee and Leahy (2008), condom use is infre-\nquent among married couples for multiple reasons, including\nthe desire for children and the widespread association of con-\ndoms with infidelity and lack of trust. In Kenya, 97% of peo-\nple in marriage or cohabitating relationships reported that\nthey did not use condom the last time they had sex. Similarly,\na study in Zaire found that women were not able to insist on\ncondom use--even when they suspected their husbands of\nhaving multiple partners--because of their fear of an angry\nreaction (Maharaj & Cleland, 2005). Moreover, many cou-\nples throughout Sub-Saharan Africa want to have large fami-\nlies;thus,useofcondoms--particularlyifitisprolonged--may\nbe considered unacceptable (Central Bureau of Statistics\n[Kenya], Ministry of Health, and ORC Marco, 2004). Based\non this study, it is clear that condoms are one of the least fre-\nquently used contraceptive methods by married couples in\nAfrican countries.\nAnother contributing factor to women's vulnerability to\nHIV is gender-based violence. According to Maharaj and\nCleland (2005), gender-based violence plays an overlooked\nbut significant role in women's vulnerability to HIV. Forced\nunprotected sex obliterates women's ability to negotiate\ncondom use, and the threat of physical violence is a strong\ndeterrent to requesting condom use, particularly with a hus-\nband who may view the request as an admission or accusa-\ntion of infidelity. Social and legal factors that impede\nwomen's empowerment also have important impacts on\nmarried women's vulnerability to HIV. Hunter (2010) stated\nthat in Sub-Saharan Africa and many other parts of the\nworld, women have lower educational attainment and, sub-\nsequently, fewer economic opportunities than men. Much of\nwomen's work is unpaid or exists in the informal sector.\nFurthermore, economic dependence on a husband makes it\ndifficult to leave an unsafe marriage or refuse unprotected\nConceptualization of Marriage\nAccording to Giddens (2008), marriage is defined as \"a\nsocially acknowledgeable and approved sexual union between\ntwo adult individuals\" (p. 207). However, in the SouthAfrican\nsociety, it is socially acceptable for a man to have extramarital\nDube et al. 3\naffairs which may place their partners at risk of contracting\nHIV. This is one of the factors that lead to the increasing num-\nber of HIV and AIDS cases in South Africa.\nThere are different concepts and expectations that go\nalong with marriage. Scholars such as Mohlahlane (2004)\nand Hunter (2007) have presented marriage using an opti-\nmistic perspective, where the focus tended to be on the posi-\ntive aspects, whereas this study explored other contributing\nfactors in marriages which put couples at risk of contracting\nHIV and AIDS. Giddens (2008) argued that marriage nor-\nmally forms the bases of family through procreation; that is,\nit is expected that married couples will bear and raise chil-\ndren. It is from this perspective of reproduction that disease\nexchange transmission can happen among married couples.\nParticularly as this is where non-use of contraception, espe-\ncially condoms, occurs.\nCondom Use and Power\nPower is defined as an ability of the individual, or marriage\npartners, to achieve aims or further their interests (Giddens,\n2008). Max Weber, one of the sociology's founding figures\ngenerally defines power as the \"chance of man or a number\nof men to realize their own will in a command action even\nagainst the resistance of others who are participating in the\npervasive aspect of all human relationships. In many differ-\nent societies, conflicts occur due to struggles for power,\nbecause of how much power an individual or group has to\nachieve or to realize as their own wishes at the expense of\nothers (Harvey, Bird, Galavotti, Duncan, & Greenberg,\n2002). It is also argued that power in a society is all about\ngetting your own way, even when others do not want you to\nIn South Africa, power differentials are derived from eco-\nnomic, political, and social relations, which include gender,\nrace, age, and locality (Squire, 2007). In this research, the\nconcept of power was considered because some activities or\nexperiences that influence people's daily living revolve\naround who has power and how that power is utilized. In\nmale-dominated society, women do not hold a significant\npower especially in decision making. This notion makes it\nhighly impossible for women to exercise their abilities to a\nfull potential. For example, in a marriage, the man may\nalways have power when it comes to sexual decision mak-\ning, like condom use. Women tend to listen to their husbands\nbecause they are the ones who have the financial power in\nthe relationship, especially the housewives.\nThere have been so many debates on issues concerning\nwomen empowerment, and this study reveals how women\nperceive this notion of empowerment. This was done through\nthe research question as it tests the women's structure and\nagency initiatives when it comes to condom use negotiation\nwith their partners. In South Africa, the structure of the econ-\nomy and gender relations place women in a dependent rela-\ntionship to men, often outweighing educational, political,\nand other social gains (Rehle et al., 2010). The fact that\nwomen are not empowered to exercise the power with their\npartners can put their health status at risk, due to constant\ninability to control decision making regarding sexual consent\nand protection in marriage. Condom negotiation is made dif-\nficult due to a popular belief that the main objective of mar-\nriage is to reproduce and expand the family; this perception\nmakes the use of protection to be difficult within marriages\nCulture and Socialization\nAccording to Williamson, Liku, McLoughlin, Nyamongo,\nand Nakayima (2006), condom use among married and\nstable couples is low and underresearched in developing\ncountries, even in countries with high HIV prevalence like\nSouth Africa. Hence, introducing condoms into a long-\nstanding relationship, in spite of HIV risk, is likely to be\nawkward (Williamson et al., 2006). Maharaj and Cleland\n(2005) are of the view that most HIV prevention efforts\nfocus on premarital and extramarital sexual behavior, but in\nareas with high HIV prevalence, the protective needs of\nmarried and cohabiting couples are just as great and often\ngo unmet. Condom use by these couples is generally low,\nwith resistance from men and cultural norms commonly\ncited as barriers to increased use.\nIn most African societies, culture plays a major role in\nmarriage. It is argued that women are more physiologically,\nbiologically, social-culturally, and economically vulnerable\nthan men when it comes to HIV infection because they are\ncommonly subjected to patriarchal social cultures that do not\nallow them to exercise control over their health and well-\nbeing (Department of Social Development, 2003). However,\nit is a contested concept and it can be understood differently\ndepending on the context and background. For example,\nmost women in the African context do not have the power\nand the initiative to challenge their husbands as it will be\nviewed as culturally unaccepted behavior.\nSocialization is another element which determines wom-\nen's ability/inability to negotiate for condom use. According\nto Korpi (2000), socialization refers to \"a lifelong process of\nsocial interaction through which we become a consistent and\nrecognizable person and acquire the physical, mental and\nsocial skills needed for survival in the society\" (p. 81). On the\ncontrary, Giddens (2008) views socialization as involving a\nsituation whereby \"a helpless infant gradually becomes self-\naware, knowledgeable and a skilled person in terms of the\nculture into which he or she was born\" (p. 72). He further\nargues that development occurs through learning, genetic\nheritage, as well as through the norms, values, and roles we\nlearn through interacting with others. According to Giddens,\nsocialization can take place through different agencies, for\nexample, family, schools, peer relationships, and mass media.\nIt is through socialization that sexual taboos are created and\nreinforced within different societies. If behavior is said to\nbe learned from childhood, it continues throughout life to\n4 SAGE Open\ninfluence people to modify their behavior in relation to the\npeople around them. Socialization is, therefore, important in\nunderstanding women and their ability and/or inability to\nnegotiate for condom use when they are within the circles of\nmarriage as a social institution. Generally in theAfrican tradi-\ntion, men are socialized to be in charge of decision making in\nall aspects of life, and therefore, women have to succumb to\nthose decisions even if it is at the detriment of their health,\nincluding the aspect of negotiating for condom use.\nResearch Method\nAim\nThe aim of this study was to explore the views of customarily\nmarried women in Katlehong, Johannesburg, regarding con-\ndom use negotiation with their husbands.\nResearch Question 1: What are the views of customarily\nmarried women regarding condom use negotiation with\ntheir husbands?\nResearch Approach and Design\nThe study utilized a qualitative research approach. Within\nthe qualitative research dimension, an exploratory-descrip-\ntive research design was used to understand the phenomenon\nstudied. The study sample comprised of eight customarily\nmarried housewives who were selected using snowball sam-\npling, which is a non-probability sampling technique.\nSnowball sampling is useful in the investigation of sensitive\ntopics that explore issues that are too personal such as con-\ndom use negotiation (Monette, Sullivan, DeJong, & Hilton,\n2014). The criteria that were used for selection was that each\nparticipant was supposed to be a resident of Katlehong's\nKhumalo section and be a customarily married housewife\nyears was used because it has been found that women within\nthis age range are the most affected and infected with HIV\nIn-depth one-on-one interviews were used to collect\ndata. All participants were interviewed individually due to\nthe sensitivity and personal nature of the study. A minimum\nof 45 min and a maximum of 60 min were allocated per\ninterview. The interviews were guided by the use of a semi-\nstructured interview schedule that is comprised of open-\nended questions. The use of open-ended questions allowed\nfor flexibility and further probing of the responses that par-\nticipants gave. All the interviews were conducted on\nSaturdays in the homes of the participants. Saturday was\nchosen because it was the most convenient day for the par-\nticipants as their husbands were at work and they also did\nnot have the responsibility of fetching children to and from\nschool. Given the fact that an appointment was arranged\nprior to the interview, there was less destruction during the\ninterviews. This ensured that privacy and confidentiality\nwere maintained. Thematic content analysis was used to\nanalyze data. Data analysis was based on notes that the\nresearchers took during the data collection process, through\nwhich different themes were identified. Therefore, identi-\nfied themes were then used as headings and sub-headings\nguiding the reporting of the study findings.\nAvoidance of harm, informed consent, voluntary partici-\npation, confidentiality, and anonymity were some of the\nethical considerations that were employed in the study.\nParticipants were informed beforehand about the potential\nimpact of the study so that they can make informed decision\nabout whether they wanted to participate or not. Also, infor-\nmation about the purpose of the study, what participation is\nrequired of them, and duration of participation was made\navailable to the participants. Moreover, participation was vol-\nuntary and refusal to participate did not have negative conse-\nquences on any of the potential participants. Participants'\ninformation was treated with utmost confidentiality regard-\nless of their social, health, and socioeconomic status.\nThe study was ethically cleared by the University of the\nWitwatersrand's nonmedical ethics committee. Limitations\nthat were inherent in the study might have included the provi-\nsion of socially desirable answers by participants; however, to\nminimize this, all participants were told that there was no\nright or wrong answer.\nFindings and Discussion\nThe findings from the study indicate that customarily mar-\nried housewives in Katlehong found it challenging to negoti-\nate for condom use with their husbands due to a variety of\nreasons. Below is a discussion of the key findings that ema-\nnated from the study.\nWomen's Financial Dependency on Men\nAccording to Bassett and Mhloyi (1991), economic depen-\ndence on men has been identified as a key structural factor at\nthe root of women's vulnerability to poverty, sexual violence,\nunwanted childbirth, and STIs including HIV. This study\nshows that the majority of women were financially depen-\ndent on their male partners, and this was highlighted by one\nparticipant who said, \"I am not working because my husband\nsaid, why should I work when he can provide for the fam-\nily?\" Cases such as this pose a great issue as most of the\nwomen interviewed did not have any source of capital for\ntheir general and day-to-day requirements. This therefore\nplaced their husbands at very powerful positions and influ-\nence in terms of how their households were run. Even though\nsome women indicated that they were the ones who kept the\nbank cards, they did not have the power to go and withdraw\ncash without informing and getting permission from their\npartners. For example, one participant said, \" . . . I also have\na bank card, so I can withdraw cash anytime I want as long\nas I phone my husband first and tell him about it and the\nreason why I want the money.\" This response concurs with\nDube et al. 5\nthat a question need to be raised of whether women's access\nto cash income gives them more decision-making power\nwithin the household, or does not always lead to greater deci-\nsion-making power in the household or in wider society.\nFurthermore, the statement shows that even though the cus-\ntomarily married housewife appears to be handling the\nfinances, she does not have the power to spend as she pleases\nand/or as need arises, but will have to clear with the partner\nfirst, of which sometimes the partner refuses to authorize the\ntransaction. This concurs with what Rehle et al. (2010) found\nthat within the South African context, the structure of the\neconomy and gender relations places women in a dependent\nrelationship to men, which outweighs educational, political,\nand other social gains. Selikow, Zulu, and Cedras (2002) also\nhighlighted that in one of the studies that they conducted\nwith males, some males indicated that they deliberately keep\ntheir wives as housewives so that they can control them,\nwhich gives males even more power to engage in sexual\nintercourse with their wives without using condoms.\nCulture and Condom Use\nThe authors are of the view that cultural norms such as the\nneed to have children, polygamy, and negative attitudes\ntoward condom use are viewed as not being African and will\npromote promiscuity, thereby contributing to the inability to\nnegotiate for condom use. When a woman is married, there\nare so many expectations from different people, especially\nfrom the family that she is married into. She is expected to\nbear children, and condom use is viewed as an obstacle that\ncan hinder the fulfillment of her expected role of child bear-\ning. Therefore, it becomes nearly impossible for her to intro-\nduce the issue of condom use during sexual intercourse. One\ncustomarily married housewife said,\nSometimes you can say that you want to use a condom but then\nyour partner forces you not to use it. Or maybe sometimes he\nmay say you are not faithful to him or you do not trust him, and\nthat you do not want to give him a child and threatens to leave\nyou. Why do you want to use condoms and stuff, especially\nwhen you are married.\nThis statement shows that unequal gender relations within\nmarried partners promote male dominance over their hus-\nbands. It is also an indication that some women are coerced\ninto engaging in un-protective sexual practices with their\npartners due to the fear of being dumped or divorced. This\nposes a high risk to women because a condom is only seen as\na preventive measure for unwanted pregnancy and not as a\npreventive measure for sexually transmitted diseases, which\nincludes HIV/AIDS.\nMoreover, Walker et al. (2004) also stated that condom\nnegotiation is made difficult due to a popular belief that the\nmain objective of marriage is to reproduce and expand the\nfamily, and this perception makes the use of protection to be\ndifficult within marriage. This idea was supported by one\nparticipant who said,\nif you fail to reproduce in your marriage you will be labeled as a\nbarren and an evil woman and in some instances your husband's\nfamily will encourage their son to look for and marry someone\nelse who will bear children for him.\nThis idea of expansion and reproduction is embedded within\nthe cultural practices and beliefs in SouthAfrica and it makes\nit difficult for women to disentangle it. Furthermore, within\nthe sphere of cultural practice and expectations, one partici-\npant stated, \"the payment of lobola (pride price) makes the\nwoman to be like her husband's asset or property that he\nowns, to the extent that the husband decides on what the\nwoman can do and at what time.\" This cultural practice\nwhich is common, not only to South Africa but also in other\nAfrican countries, makes it difficult for women to negotiate\nfor condom use with their husbands as their male counter-\nparts normally claim that they paid for them; therefore, they\nshould respect and listen to what they order them to do. Also,\nonce the lobola is paid, the aunts of the woman emphasizes\nto the woman that she must be strong and endure whatever\ncircumstances she is subjected to. It is common knowledge\nthat it is a disgrace or embarrassment to the family should a\nwoman decide to return home when facing challenges in her\nmarriage. In such instances, the woman may not be accepted\nback home. Therefore, the decision of women on whether or\nnot to use condoms is shaped by factors such as culture.\nConformity Associated With Marriage\nAccording to Schulman (2006), women find themselves in a\ndifficult position of having to conform to the values and\nnorms of society for them to be socially accepted.\nTraditionally, the decision-making process is regarded as an\nexclusive preserve of the male folks, which places women at\nan inferior position in marriage. The fact that there should be\nconsultations before one takes a decision shows that mar-\nriage reinforces the structural ideas of patriarchy, where\nmales become dominant over women. Almost half of the\nwomen interviewed expressed fear of losing their partners,\nespecially after suggesting that they need to use condoms.\nThis is a sensitive area that women felt that even though they\nmight test HIV positive, they will never disclose to their part-\nners due to the fear of the implications, for example, domes-\ntic violence and stigma. One participant said,\nI am fully aware of the manner in which HIV spreads, and the\nthings that I can do to protect myself from being infected. But I\nam married and I feel that I have little or no voice to suggest to\nmy partner that we use condoms, because I can lose my marriage\nthrough that and also my man.\nWomen find themselves in a compromising position and\nbeing unable to voice out their concerns due to the fear of the\n6 SAGE Open\nunknown. It was clear that some women did things not just\nbecause they wanted to but because they wanted to conform\nto certain popular beliefs and expectations from their male\npartners. It also appeared that in some marriages, women\ndidn't have much say in terms of reproductive health issues,\nfor example, when to start a family.\nHowever, it was said to be an innate expectation that once\none gets married, she should not be worried about falling\npregnant, even though it might not be her choice. This is also\ndue to the inequalities that the institution of marriage pres-\nents to married partners. Losing one's man takes precedence\nto one's life and right to good health. To support this argu-\nment, one participant also said, \"When one gets married,\ncondom use automatically falls away as you will no longer\nbe afraid of getting pregnant because as a woman you are\nrequired to start having children and this means non-use of\ncontraceptives of any type.\" This statement is an indication\nthat women were at high risk of contracting STIs due to their\ninability to negotiate for condom use with their husbands.\nHunter (2004) also pointed out that society, through oral\npraise poems, puts pressure on men to have as many children\nas they can, as he will be viewed as a powerful and strong\nman who might be respected within his society.\nImplications and Recommendations for\nSocial Work Practice\nAn intensive effort is required from social work services,\nregarding support, education, and enhancement of all pro-\ngrams related to HIV and AIDS transmission. This could be\ndone through the involvement of all affected family mem-\nbers in all HIV andAIDS related programs within Katlehong.\nHowever, there is a need to create a mutually trusting envi-\nronment to enable the establishment of a functional and\npositive flow of communication between customarily mar-\nried couples. This strategy might serve to effectively break-\ndown the negative effects of silence and the abuse of power.\nThere is a need for improved awareness and prevention\ncampaigns on HIV and AIDS. This might enhance in mov-\ning away from traditional taboo that a man is responsible\nfor decision making, including sexually related issues that\naffects women. Furthermore, professional support from\nsocial workers is recommended through active engagement\nin empowering couples and communities to access avail-\nable resources with an aim of building successful and\nhealthier relationships. By doing this, the social work pro-\nfession will be on the lead in spearheading psychosocial\nchallenges related to social justice and power struggles\nwithin customary marriages in different communities.\nConclusion\nThe study showed that the majority of the participants could\nnot negotiate for condom use because they were dependent on\ntheir husbands for financial support, which reduced their\nchances of having sexual control in their relationships. In\naddition, such tendencies are mostly perpetuated by the soci-\netal expectations and roles that men are the breadwinners and\nwomen are supposed to stay at home and look after the chil-\ndren. Furthermore, the study revealed that some of the partici-\npants choose not to go against their husbands' decision of not\nusing a condom during sexual intercourse due to fear of sepa-\nration and/or divorce. This is mostly attributed to some of the\ncultural beliefs that a man has the whole power to mandate\nwhat the woman can or cannot do after paying lobola. The\nstudy also found that the majority of women fear to challenge\ntheir male partners with the view that it was socially unac-\nceptable in the traditional African society. This is an indica-\ntion that women, especially housewives, still subscribe to the\nsocietal roles that are said to be unfit for women. Hence, the\nstudy revealed that the majority of the participants had very\nlittle involvement in the decision making concerning their\nsexual activities. Findings showed that condom use was nega-\ntively associated with lack of trust in the relationship, and\ntherefore, women were willing to forgo their independence in\ndecision making even though they might have suspected that\ntheir husbands were having an extra marital affair. Therefore,\nstudies on gender and HIV are imperative given the fact that\nHIV vulnerability among women is prevalent and associated\nwith gender inequality, gendered power relations, inhibitive\nsocial structure, low sexual agency among women, forced\nsex, lack of sexual autonomy and sexual pleasure-seeking,\nand economic dependence on men.\nIn conclusion, it is apparent that women are unable to\nnegotiate for condom use in their relationships due to their\nfinancial dependency on their husbands. Therefore, there is a\nneed for women to be empowered while they are still young,\nthrough education, so that they can be assertive, financially\nindependent, and able to make their own decisions with\nregard to their sexual-related matters. Furthermore, HIV and\nAIDS prevention strategies have to incorporate issues around\nsocial, cultural, and psychological aspects of behavior\nchange to win the fight against this epidemic.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBassett, M.
