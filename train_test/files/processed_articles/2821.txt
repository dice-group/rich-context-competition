    "abstract": "Abstract\nPrevious empirical work on the link between domestic and foreign investment provides\nmixed results which partly depend on the level of aggregation of the data. We argue that\nthe aggregated home country implications of foreign direct investment (FDI) cannot be\ngauged using firm-level data. Aggregated data, in turn, miss channels through which\ndomestic and foreign activities interact. Instead, industry-level data provide useful\ninformation on the link between domestic and foreign investment. We theoretically show\nthat the effects of FDI on the domestic capital stock depend on the structure of industries\nand the relative importance of domestic and multinational firms. Our model allows\ndistinguishing intra-sector competition from inter-sector linkage effects. We test the\nmodel using data on German FDI. Using panel cointegration methods, we find evidence\nfor a positive long-run impact of FDI on the domestic capital stock and on the stock of\ninward FDI. Effects of FDI on the domestic capital stock are driven mainly by intra-\nsector effects. For inward FDI, inter-sector linkages matter as well.\n",

We would like to thank Johannes Becker, Theo Eicher, Clemens Fuest, Wolfram Schrettl\nas well as participants of seminars given at the ASSA Annual Meetings and at the University of\nCologne for helpful comments on an earlier draft. Franziska Peter, Kathrin Peters, and Martin\nSchlotter have provided most efficient research assistance. All errors are in our own responsibility.\n1 Motivation\nMultinational activity has increased significantly in recent years. German multinationals\nare no exception in this regard. Overall, German firms account for about 10% of world\noutward FDI (Unctad 2006), and these investments have grown quite dynamically.\nhas increased from 2 to 8% of the total domestic capital stock of German firms\n(Figure 1). German firms hold about twice as much capital abroad as foreigners hold in\nGermany. German firms have doubled the number of workers in their foreign affiliates\nfrom 2 to 4 million or the equivalent of 10% of the domestic workforce. Employment in\naffiliates of foreign firms in Germany has increased less dynamically from about 1 to 1.5\nmillion workers.\nThe labor market implications of increased FDI have received much attention in the\npolitical arena, in the media, and in academic research (see, e.g., Becker and Muendler\n2006). The integration of countries in Eastern Europe and in Asia that are richly endowed\nwith labor has given rise to concerns that persistent unemployment may be the result of\nincreased FDI. Low-skilled labor in Germany might be particularly affected.\nAs regards the long-run implications of FDI, the impact on the domestic capital stock is\neven more important. Yet, there is relatively little empirical evidence on the link between\nthe domestic capital stock and FDI.2 At first sight, aggregated data suggest that increased\nFDI has not had a significantly negative impact on the domestic capital stock. Over the\npast decade, the aggregated capital stock has instead remained almost unchanged.\nStill, developments of the aggregated capital stock might cloud important differences in\nadjustment across industries. In this paper, we thus use data at a semi-aggregated level\nthat allow considering channels of interaction between domestic and foreign investment.\nWe contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we use a theoretical model that nests\n1 Unless indicated otherwise, we use FDI to denote the stock of capital invested abroad.\n2 In their survey of the home country effects of FDI, Barba-Navaretti et al. (2004, Chapter 9) focus on\nthe complementarity between domestic and foreign employment, and on the effects of FDI on\ntechnology and productivity.\ndifferent types of multinational activity and that allows for input- and output-market\nlinkages among industries. We use the model to derive implications on the effects of FDI\non the domestic capital stock. Second, we break up domestic capital into the investment\nof domestic and of foreign firms (inward FDI). Third, we estimate the links between\ndomestic and foreign investment activities using data that are aggregated at the industry-\nlevel. Our data allow estimating the impact of input- and output market linkages on the\nrelationship between domestic capital and FDI. We also distinguish intra-sector\ncompetition from inter-sector linkage effects.\nWe are not the first to analyze the links between FDI and domestic capital. There are\nrather two strands in the existing empirical literature addressing this link. A first strand of\nliterature uses aggregated data. Feldstein (1995) finds a negative correlation between FDI\nand domestic investment in US data. He regresses domestic investment on domestic\nsavings and on FDI, accounting for the endogeneity of FDI using instrumental variable\ntechniques. Hence, the paper looks at the aggregated consequences of FDI for domestic\ninvestment. Desai, Foley, and Hines (2005a) replicate this study using more recent data\nfrom OECD-countries for the 1980s and 1990s and, again, find a negative relationship in\naggregated data. For a time series of aggregated investment stocks of US multinational\nfirms, in contrast, Desai, Foley, and Hines (2005a) find a positive association between\ndomestic and foreign investment. Faeth (2006) also finds a positive relation using\nAustralian balance of payments data. Recent studies also use German data. Using\nGerman balance of payments data, Lipponer (2006b) finds no evidence for a negative\nimpact of FDI on domestic investment. Herzer and Schrooten (2007) analyze the\ncointegration relationship between domestic capital formation and FDI outflows. They\nfind a positive relationship for the US and a negative relationship for Germany. None of\nthese studies allows studying the links between FDI and domestic capital at an industry-\nlevel.\nA second strand of literature uses firm-level data, again mostly for the US. Desai, Foley,\nand Hines (2005b) use information on the investment of US multinationals to link\nchanges in different types of domestic activities of US multinationals to changes in the\nforeign activities of these firms. They find a positive impact of FDI: firms that invest\nabroad also tend to invest more in the home economy.\nSo, at least for the US, the link between domestic investment and FDI partly differs in the\naggregated and in the firm-level data. There are several possible reasons for this\nobservation. First, across different firms that invest abroad, the correlation between\ndomestic and foreign investment need not be the same. Aggregation across firms might\nthus cloud different adjustment patterns at the firm-level. Second, firm-level studies\ndisregard the general equilibrium effects of FDI for the investment of other firms. If some\nfirms engage in FDI, other firms might be affected as well. Competition might become\nmore intense; output and product market conditions for competitors, suppliers, and\ncustomers of firms engaging in FDI may change. And, third, the differences between\nstudies at different levels of aggregation might simply be due to differences in the data\nused. Some studies use balance of payments data, while others use foreign direct\ninvestment stock statistics.\nWhen comparing results from studies using aggregated and firm-level data, one also\nneeds to bear in mind that these studies answer different types of questions. While using\nfirm-level data is of interest when testing specific partial-equilibrium effects of FDI, it is\nthe aggregated employment or investment implications that are important from a\nmacroeconomic perspective and, not least, for policy makers.\nIn this paper, we argue that both approaches used in the literature do not tell the full story\nabout the linkages between FDI and the domestic capital stock. Aggregation across firms\nand industries does not allow shedding light on sources of complementarities between\ndomestic and foreign investment. Using firm-level data does not allow analyzing\nfeedback effects between different firms. Assessing the effects of FDI on domestic\nactivities on the basis of firm-level data requires performing a counterfactual\nexperiment.3 Using, for instance, matching models, one needs to find a group of\ncomparable `non-treated' firms and to associate the outcome (here: domestic capital) of\nthe `treated' firms (here: FDI) to the outcomes of their `neighbors' in a comparison\ngroup. By definition, such firm-level estimation procedures ignore the impact that FDI of\nsome firms can have on other, non-comparable firms.\n3 See Becker and Muendler (2006) or Kleinert and Toubal (2006) for evidence using German data and\ntesting the labor market implications of FDI.\nWe follow an intermediate route by using semi-aggregated data at the industry-level. We\nexplicitly model the impact of FDI on other, non-comparable firms in the same sector, on\nsuppliers, and on customers of the firm under consideration. Hence, our model allows\ndistinguishing intra-sector competition from inter-sector spill-over effects of FDI.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are hardly any empirical papers studying the effects\nof FDI on domestic investment at the industry-level empirically. An exception is work by\nHejazi and Pauly (2002, 2003) for Canada. They find no statistically significant link\nbetween outward FDI and domestic investment across all industries while inward FDI\nsupplements domestic capital formation. However, their study does show a substantial\ndegree of heterogeneity when gross fixed capital formation is broken down in its\ncomponents, by industry, and by partner country.\nAlso, theoretical work on the link between FDI and the domestic capital stock is scarce.\nA few previous papers have also modeled the link between FDI and domestic capital\ntheoretically. Desai, Foley, and Hines (2005b) have a partial equilibrium model in which\nmultinational firms simultaneously choose domestic and foreign inputs. Their focus is on\nthe form of the production function and on how it affects the complementarity between\ndomestic and foreign capital. Our model, in contrast, focuses on the effects that changes\nin the activities of multinational firms have for domestic firms via changes in output\nprices and via linkages between firms in different industries. To analyze this relationship,\nwe use a production function that captures the complementarity between domestic and\nforeign capital at the firm level. This choice is motivated by the empirical results of\na model with backward and forward linkages between industries. They analyze the\neffects of FDI on the host economy by distinguishing product market, factor market, and\nlinkage effects. Linkage effects arise through demand and supply linkages between\nMNEs and local firms. These linkages can generate positive spillovers between\nmultinational and domestic production which can offset or overturn potential negative\nproduct or factor market effects. In contrast to our work, the focus of Barba-Navaretti et\n4 Results using data for German multinationals suggest a positive relationship between foreign and\ndomestic activities as well (see, e.g., Kleinert and Toubal 2006).\nal. (2004) is on the host country effects of horizontal FDI, and they do not consider the\nimpact of FDI on the capital stock.\nIn Part 2, we present a theoretical model which provides the intuition for the linkages\nbetween the domestic and the foreign capital stock. The model distinguishes the effects of\nFDI in the same sector from FDI in input and output industries, and we model intra-sector\ncompetition as well as inter-sector linkage effects. We also analyze effects of FDI on\ndomestic and multinational firms. In Part 3, we describe our data. In Part 4, we present\nthe empirical analysis. We distinguish long-run and short-run effects of FDI, and we use\ndetailed industry-level information to separate effects of FDI in different industries.\nUsing panel cointegration techniques, we find evidence for a positive impact of outward\nFDI in the same sector on the domestic capital stock and on the stock of inward FDI. To\nsome extent, this effect includes effects of input- and output-sector linkages as, on\naverage, about 30% of inputs and outputs are traded within industries. Apart from that,\nwe find no evidence of significant inter-industry linkage effects for domestic firms.\nInward FDI, in contrast, is positively affected by FDI of input and output sectors. Our\nresults also suggest that the long-run effects of FDI on the domestic capital stock should\nbe studied as the short-run dynamics are rather unstable.\n2 Theoretical Model\nIn this section, we develop a theoretical framework to investigate how foreign investment\naffects the domestic capital stock at the industry-level. For this purpose, we distinguish\nforeign direct investment in three different industries: FDI that is carried out by firms in\nthe industry under consideration, called industry Y, FDI that is done by firms in industries\nthat deliver inputs to industry Y, called industry I, and FDI that is carried out by firms in\nindustries that produce output with inputs received from industry Y, called industry O.\nHence, our model allows analyzing home country effects of FDI through backward and\nforward linkages.\nTo assess how FDI in these three different industries affects the domestic capital stock,\nwe further need to distinguish three types of firms active in industry Y on the home\nmarket: Purely domestic enterprises (PDE), domestic multinational enterprises (MNE),\nand foreign held enterprises (FHE). Purely domestic enterprises are owned by domestic\nowners, produce locally and serve only the domestic output market. Multinational\nenterprises are owned by domestic owners and operate (produce and sell) both on the\nhome market and abroad. Foreign held enterprises are owned by foreigners and operate\nboth on the home market and abroad. In our empirical analysis, we will be able to\ndistinguish the domestic demand for capital of domestic companies (i.e. MNEs plus\nPDEs), and of foreign held companies (FHEs).\nWe describe firms by their production function. Thus, we do not consider in detail how a\nfirm chooses to organize its production, as captured by the recent literature on the theory\nof the firm. (See, e.g., Barba-Navaretti et al. (2004: Chapter 5).) Our reduced form of\ndescribing a firm allows focusing on the profitability effects arising from FDI.\nThe production possibilities of the three types of firms, MNEs, PDEs and FHEs can be\ncharacterized as follows. Multinational firms produce for the domestic market with a\nproduction function )\n~\n,\n,\n~\n,\n(\nf\nf\nf\nf\nK\nK\nL\nL\nf where )\n~\n(\nf\nf\nK\nK is capital invested domestically\n(abroad) and )\n~\n(\nf\nf\nL\nL is any other input employed domestically (abroad). L could be any\nother non-traded factor input which, for convenience, we call `labor'. A  denotes foreign\nvariables. This production function captures the idea that the MNE takes advantage of the\npossibility to locate part of its production abroad. Domestic firms are characterized by a\nproduction function . Finally, foreign held firms produce with a production\nfunction\n)\n,\n(\ng\ng\nK\nL\ng\n)\n~\n,\n,\n~\n,\n( h\nh\nh\nh\nK\nK\nL\nL\nh . Like MNEs, FHEs have access to foreign production\nopportunities. For notational convenience, we assume that all MNEs are completely\nsymmetric and so are all PDEs and FHEs.\nWe use the following specifications of production functions for the domestic market:\nf f f f\nf f f f f f f f\nf (L ,L ,K ,K ) L L K K\n   \n= \n\n   \ng\ng g g g\ng(L ,K ) L K\n \nh h h h\nh h h h h h h h\nh(L ,L ,K ,K ) L L K K\n   \n= \n\n   \nTo rule out economies of scale, we restrict the sum of the factor shares in the production\nfunction to .\n\n+ \n \n 5 We focus on the short- to medium-run, where the number\nof firms is exogenously given, but the firms choose inputs \u00ad including the capital stock \u00ad\nto maximize their profits. The total number of firms is normalized to 1. For notational\nconvenience, we assume that all firms produce homogenous goods. Thus, the domestic\nproduct market can be described by a demand function , where X is total output\nproduced by MNEs, FHEs and PDEs. The market price p adjusts such that the product\nmarket is cleared. All firms take the market price as given, i.e. all firms behave as price\ntakers. A straightforward extension of our analysis would allow firms to produce\nheterogeneous goods. In this case, demand would not be characterized by a single market\nprice, but rather by product specific prices, with negative cross price elasticities and\nhence similar competition effects as described below.\n)\n(X\np\nWe assume that MNEs, PDEs and FHEs maximize profits by choosing factor inputs,\ntaking as given domestic (foreign) factor prices )\n~\n(w\nw for labor and )\n~\n(r\nr for capital. Due\nto restrictions in the mobility of labor, factor prices need not be equalized internationally.\nHowever, firms will choose their input demand such as to optimally take advantage of\nfactor price differences.

This would leave our\nmain results unaffected while making the exposition more cumbersome.\nWe start by investigating how factor demand reacts to changes in input and output prices.\nWe then address the specific effects of foreign direct investments in different industries.\nConsider an increase in domestic output price p, due to an exogenous change in demand.\nThen all firms increase their factor demand for both L and K.\nProof: See Appendix\nConsider a decrease in the domestic input price w.

An increase in the foreign capital stock\ncould be driven by production cost considerations or by market seeking motivations. The\nfirst type of investment is called a vertical investment; the second type is called a\nhorizontal investment. To fix ideas, we will capture these two motivations of investment\nby a change in foreign input prices, on the one hand, and by a change in output prices, on\nthe other hand. So, a vertical investment can be thought of as being motivated by a\nreduction in foreign input prices, for instance because of the integration of labor-rich\ncountries of Eastern Europe and Asia into the world economy. A horizontal investment\ncan be thought of as being motivated by an increase in foreign output prices, for instance\nbecause of the increased demand of the newly emerging markets or by a reduction in\ntransaction cost that affects the net revenue from foreign sales.\nThe effects of FDI on the home economy depend on the motive driving the foreign\ninvestment, and input and output sectors may be affected differently. Recall that we study\nFDI in three different industries. In each industry, FDI may be motivated by a change in\nthe input price or a change in the output price in the foreign market. Thus, there are six\npotential scenarios to be considered. Table 1 summarizes the implications of these six\ndifferent scenarios from the point of view of firms in industry Y.\nCase 1: Effects of vertical FDI in the same industry\nConsider first a vertical foreign investment that is driven by improved production\nopportunities abroad. We capture this effect by a change in the relative foreign input\nprices, in particular a change in w\n~ , while keeping r\n~ constant. Without loss of generality,\nwe restrict attention to MNEs and PDEs for this purpose. The total number of firms is\nnormalized to 1, and the share of MNEs and PDEs is given by q and (1-q) respectively.\nThus, total output is g\nq\nqf\nX )\n( -\n+\n= .\nFrom Lemma 3 above we know that a decrease in the foreign price for labor, w\n~ , induces\na MNE to increase its employment of foreign labor and hence, due to the positive cross\nderivatives of the production function, also the foreign and the domestic capital stock.\nThis leads to an increase in domestic production and hence a lower market price p. From\nLemma 1, however, we know that a decrease in p reduces factor demand. This has a\nnegative effect on PDEs, which use less domestic labor and less domestic capital. The\noverall effect is summarized in the following result.\nConsider FDI from sector Y that is motivated by a decrease in the foreign price for labor\nw\n~ . This has two effects:\n\u00b7 The domestic capital stock by MNEs increases and\nf\nK\n\u00b7 the domestic capital stock by PDEs decreases.\ng\nK\nThe overall effect on the domestic capital stock depends on the price effect on the\ndomestic product market and is more likely to be positive\n\u00b7 the larger the share of MNEs, q, and\n\u00b7 the less price elastic product demand.\nProof: See Appendix.\nThus, the overall effect depends on the strength of the negative price effect and on the\nrelative market shares of MNEs and PDEs.\nTotal production for the home market cannot decrease. If this were the case, the domestic\noutput price would increase and so would the production by PDEs. But due to the\nincrease in competitiveness of MNEs, production by PDEs is to some extent replaced by\nproduction by MNEs. Since MNEs produce with both, foreign and domestic capital, total\ndomestic capital may decrease even though total domestic plus foreign capital increases.\nWe have ignored FHEs so far. How would they be affected in this case of vertical\ninvestment? As multinationals, they should benefit from improved production\nopportunities like MNEs, and they should react like MNEs with an increase in production\nand in domestic input demand.\nCase 2: Effects of horizontal FDI in the same industry\nWe interpret a horizontal foreign investment as being driven by an increase in the foreign\noutput price, for example due to an increase in foreign market size. How would this affect\ndomestic production and factor demand? One possibility could be that the foreign output\nprice increase reflects a global economic upswing, leading also to an increase in the\ndomestic output price. In this case, we can capture the effect of a horizontal investment\nby an increase in domestic output price p. The more correlated changes in demand abroad\nand at home are, and thus the more symmetric changes in prices, the more likely is a\npositive impact on the domestic market.\nIf, however, the foreign output price increase is purely local, we would still expect\ndomestic production to be affected due to positive externalities of foreign on domestic\nproduction.6 In this case, the effects would be analogous to those resulting from a\nreduction in foreign input prices as analyzed in Case 1. Using Lemma 1 we can\nsummarize the results as follows:\nConsider FDI from sector Y that is motivated by an increase in the foreign market price.\nSuppose the domestic market price increases as well. Then the domestic capital stock by\nMNEs, PDEs and FHEs increases. The smaller the domestic price increase, the less likely\nis an increase of the domestic capital stock.\nCase 3: Effects of FDI in input industries\nNext, we consider foreign investment that is made by firms in industry I delivering inputs\nto industry Y. If this investment is motivated by output price changes (Case 3b), then\nthere is no reason to expect an impact on industry Y. If, however, the investment is\nmotivated by input price changes (Case 3a), then all firms in industry Y experience a\nreduction in their input prices. In this sense, FDI in input industries has effects similar to\nthose resulting from outsourcing of stages of production in the same industry. We capture\n6 Foreign production is not modelled explicitly but it can be thought of as being symmetric to domestic\nproduction insofar as foreign capita and domestic capital are complements.\nthis effect by a reduction in the price for domestic input L, w. As shown in Lemma 2 we\nget the following result:\nConsider FDI in input industry I that is motivated by lower input prices abroad. This\nleads to a reduction in the domestic input price w for firms in industry Y which in turn\nleads to an increase in the domestic capital stock.\nCase 4: Effects of FDI in output industries\nFinally, we turn to investments that are undertaken in industry O that is buying inputs\nfrom industry Y. If the investment is driven by an input price reduction abroad (Case 4a)\nand if this input is a substitute for the input produced in industry Y, then a reduction in\noutput prices for the industry under consideration will result. If instead the investment\nabroad is motivated by changes in price from inputs that are complementary to the input\nproduced by the industry under consideration, or if the investment is motivated by an\nincrease in output prices abroad (Case 4b), then output prices would increase. As shown\nin Lemma 1, this leads to the following results.\nConsider FDI in the output industry that is motivated by lower input prices abroad. If the\ninputs are substitutes for the inputs produced in industry Y, firms in industry Y experience\na reduction in output price p and hence reduce their domestic capital stock. If the inputs\nare complements or if the FDI in the output industry is motivated by higher output prices\nabroad, firms in industry Y experience an increase in output price p and hence increase\ntheir domestic capital stock.\nIn sum, our theoretical model has a couple of testable implications:\nFirst, the effects of FDI on the domestic capital stock in any particular industry depend on\nthe motive that drives the foreign investment as well as on the industry from which this\nforeign investment originates.\nSecond, market seeking (horizontal) investment tends to have a positive impact,\nproduction cost motivated (vertical) investments can have both, a positive or a negative\nimpact. Positive effects of vertical FDI are more likely the less price elastic industry\ndemand and the larger the share of multinational firms in this industry.\nThird, FDI in input industries tends to have a positive impact on the domestic capital\nstock whereas FDI in output industries can have a positive or a negative effect.\n3 The Data\nTo test the above model, we need a dataset which provides industry-level information on\nthe volume of FDI, on the domestic capital stock of domestic and foreign firms, on the\nnumber of multinationals and purely domestic firms, on input-output linkages across\nindustries as well as on the employment at the industry-level. Here, we describe the data\nthat we use to test the predictions of this model.7\n3.1 Data on Foreign Direct Investment\nOur industry-level data on inward and outward FDI come from the firm-level database\nMiDi (Micro database Direct Investment, formerly `International Capital Links')\nprovided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. (For details on this database see Lipponer\n(2006a).) The MiDi-database is a full sample survey of German firms' foreign affiliates\nand of foreign firms' affiliates in Germany, and it contains comprehensive information on\naffiliates' balance sheets.\nWe aggregate the data using standard NACE sectors which allow combining our FDI\ndata with industry-level data obtained from the German Statistical Office. The original\nMiDi-database contains information on more than 100 industries, following NACE\nRev. 1 categories, and these can be aggregated into 37 broader industries. We use only\nstandard manufacturing and services industries. We drop industries such as agriculture,\nmining and quarrying, public institutions, or households. Out of the industries dropped,\n7 Details on the data specification and sources are given in the appendix.\nholding companies, which account for about 46% of total outward FDI, are particularly\nimportant. The final dataset includes 13 manufacturing and 9 services industries.\nInvestments with a volume below a certain threshold need not be reported, and the\nreporting limits have changed over time. To avoid changes in our explanatory variables\nresulting from changes in reporting limits, we drop all observations that are not covered\nby the most restrictive reporting requirements. Overall, we delete about 60% of the\nnumber of firm-level observations (see Table 2). The loss of observations is less severe\nfor the total volume of activities as we drop the smaller units. The mean size of foreign\naffiliates increases moving from the full to the restricted sample by about 40%. For\noutward FDI, this increase is relatively uniform across the size measures used (affiliate\nsales, affiliate employment, and volume of FDI). For inward FDI, mean affiliate sales and\nemployment increase by about 40% but the mean volume of FDI is almost unchanged.\nWe create a dataset that contains two main measures of multinational activity: the volume\nof sales of foreign affiliates of German firms and the number of foreign affiliates by\nindustry. The same type of information is obtained for affiliates of foreign held firms in\nGermany.\nIn our theoretical model, we have stressed the importance of distinguishing vertically and\nhorizontally-integrated multinationals. Empirically, we cannot directly distinguish\nbetween the two motivations of FDI, i.e. we cannot identify changes in foreign input\nprices or foreign output prices for each investment project. In order to capture the\nmotives for FDI indirectly, we split the data in two ways. First, we split the data into\nmultinational activity with high-income countries \u00ad for which horizontal FDI is likely to\ndominate \u00ad and with low-income countries and accession states \u00ad for which vertical FDI\nis likely to prevail. Second, we split the data into cases where the parent and affiliate are\nactive in the same industry (as a proxy for horizontal FDI) and into cases where parent\nand affiliate are active in different industries (as a proxy for vertical FDI). For this\nbreakdown, we use the finer industry-level disaggregation contained in the data. This\nclassification is possible only for outward FDI since we do not have information on the\nsector of the foreign parent.\n3.2 Industry-Level Explanatory Variables\nThe MiDi-database does not provide information on a number of control variables of\ninterest. Most importantly, it contains very little information on the parent firms. We\ntherefore obtain industry-level information from the OECD's STAN database and from\nthe German Statistical Office. During our sample period (1991-2004), the Federal\nStatistical Office changed industry classifications for the national accounts twice. The\ndata that we use have been adjusted for these changes. For employment and hourly\nwages, we use data from national accounts, which are compatible with International\nLabour Organization (ILO) standards. We additionally include a dummy variable for the\npost-unification period which might also pick up some of the effects of the\nreclassification of industries described above.\n3.3 Measuring Capital Stocks\nOur main dependent variable is the domestic capital stock. Ideally, we would split up the\ndomestic capital stock into the capital owned by purely domestic firms (PDE), by\ndomestic multinationals (MNE), and by foreign multinationals (FHE). Unfortunately, we\nhave no comprehensive dataset which would allow identifying purely domestic and\ndomestic multinational firms. We therefore decompose the capital stock in Germany into\nthe capital owned by all domestic and by foreign firms. We define the total capital stock\nas FHE\nK\nK +\n= , where FHE\nK = stock of inward FDI, and D\nK = domestic capital\nstock of domestic firms. We obtain the domestic capital stock owned by residents by\nsubtracting the stock of inward FDI from the total capital stock, . We\nmeasure inward and outward foreign direct investment using the MiDi-database and\naggregating the data by industry and year. Data on aggregated capital stocks come from\nthe German Statistical Office. Using these distinctions, we thus have the domestic capital\nstocks owned by residents and owned by non-residents (inward FDI) as dependent\nvariables.\nD\n= - FHE\n3.4 Measuring Industry Linkages\nOne advantage of using industry-level data is that we can analyze the effect of FDI in\nother industries. Using industry-level input-output tables obtained from the German\nStatistical Office, we construct a year-specific weight of each industry in the inputs and\noutputs of other industries. Using these weights, we split up FDI into FDI in industries\nproviding inputs and industries buying the outputs of industry i.\nMore specifically, we include not only FDI in industry i but also FDI of input and output\nsectors denoting as the weighted amount of FDI that industry i ,,receives'' via\ninputs from other industries in year t and as the amount of FDI that is attributable\nto industry i via its output-links to other industries.\nI\nit\nFDI\nO\nit\nFDI\nWe define as the weighted sum of FDI from all industries k that\ndeliver inputs to industry i. We calculate the weights as the proportion of inputs that\nindustry i receives from industry k relative to its total inputs\n\n=\nk kt\nkit\nI\nit\nFDI\nw\nFDI\nit\nkit\nk kit\nkit\nkit\ninp\ninp\ninp\ninp\nw =\n=  with  =\n=\nk it\nkit\nw\nw 1 and inp = value added in input\nsectors.\nWe define as the weighted sum of FDI from industries j that\nindustry i delivers outputs to, where\n\n=\nj jt\njit\nO\nit\nFDI\nw\nFDI\nit\njit\nj jit\njit\njit\noutp\noutp\noutp\noutp\nw =\n=  , with\nand outp = value added in output sectors.\n =\n=\nj it\njit\nw\nWe have information on time-varying input-output sector shares from 1991 only through\nthe year 2000. Hence, in order to avoid loosing observations for recent years, we use the\nof inputs (outputs) received from (delivered to) the own sector are set equal to zero.\nOtherwise, we would double-count own sector FDI. On average, these intra-sector input-\noutput linkages account for about 30% of industries' inputs and outputs. Hence, for a\nlarge share of the total inputs and outputs, we cannot separate the competition from the\nlinkage effects identified in the theoretical model. Finding an effect of same-sector FDI\ncould thus be due to a positive direct impact of FDI on the domestic capital stock or an\nindirect effect working through inter-firm linkages.\nRecall from our theoretical considerations above that the impact of FDI on the domestic\ncapital stock in industry i depends on who is investing abroad and for what reason. We\nexpect FDI in the industry from which industry i receives inputs to have a positive impact\non the domestic capital stock. The effect of FDI in the industry to which industry i\nsupplies outputs can be positive or negative, positive in case of a market seeking\ninvestment, positive or negative in case of a production cost motivated investment.\n4 Empirical Model and Regression Results\nThe theoretical model has shown that the impact of FDI on the domestic capital stock is\nnot clear a priori. The impact rather depends on the input and output linkages between\nindustries, on the price elasticity of output demand, on the importance of multinationals\nin each industry, and on the importance of horizontal and vertical FDI. In this section, we\ndescribe the empirical model that we estimate to gauge the effects of FDI on the domestic\ncapital stock and to test the importance of input-output sector linkages.\nThe baseline empirical model that we estimate gives the response of the domestic capital\nstock owned by residents to the price of labor and the levels of employment, output,\nand FDI:\nD\nit\nK\n( )\n,\nD\nit o it it it i it\nit\nK w p L Y FDI d\n      \n= + + + + + +  (3)\nwhere is a vector including inward and outward FDI,\nit\nFDI ( )\nit\np\nw = real hourly wages,\n= employment, = output.\nit\nL\nit\nY\nit\n is an error term, i=1, ... , 21 denotes the industry, and t\n= 1991, ... , 2004 is time. Multinational activity is captured through the volume of inward\nand outward FDI and the number of multinationals in each industry. In contrast to Desai\net al. (2005b), who do not control for the level of output, this specification estimates the\nceteris paribus effects of FDI on the domestic capital stock at a given scale of activities.\n(See Hanson et al. (2003) for a similar specification using the demand for labor as the\ndependent variable.) All variables are in logs, thus the coefficients can be interpreted as\nelasticities.\nIdeally, we would also include a proxy for the real interest rate. However, we are\nunaware of data that measures the interest rate at the industry-level. We include a full set\nof industry fixed effects ( ) through which we aim to capture differences across\nindustries such as differences in (real) interest rates.\n4.2 Long-Run Determinants of the Domestic Capital Stock\nWe estimate equation (3) using data aggregated across industries and years. In addition,\nwe also estimate the response of the log of the stock of inward FDI to a similar set of\nexplanatory variables: ( )\n,\nFHE D outward\nit o it it it it i it\nit\nK w p L Y K FDI d\n       \n= + + + + + + + \nWhen using the capital stock as a dependent variable, the potential non-stationarity of the\ndata becomes an issue. Our model is a fairly typical macro-panel with a similar\nnon-stationarity of the data may thus lead to spurious regressions, as in time series data.\nWe run panel unit root tests to check whether our variables might be non-stationary. The\nresults of these tests, which are reported in Table 3, provide evidence for outward FDI to\nbe non-stationary. For some other variables, the results are less clear cut and depend on\nthe specific unit root test chosen. Moreover, panel unit root tests can be biased against\nfinding evidence for unit roots if the cross-sections are cointegrated, i.e. if developments\nacross industries are affected by a common trend (Banerjee et al. 2005). Using the panel\nunit root test proposed in Breitung and Das (2005), which accounts for cross-sectional\ndependence, in fact provides somewhat greater evidence for the presence of a unit root\nthan tests assuming cross-sectional independence. In the following, we therefore proceed\nunder the assumption that our main variables of interest could be non-stationary.\nWe have two options for dealing with non-stationary data. One option is to first\ndifference all data in logs and to estimate the model in growth rates rather than log-levels.\nThis method has the advantage that the dependent variable is stationary. It has the\ndisadvantage that information on the long-run relationships among the variables of\ninterest is lost. Essentially, such a model explains the short-run variation of changes in\nthe capital stock, but it does not give their long-run determinants. The second method is\nto test for cointegration among the variables of interest and to estimate the long-run\ncointegration coefficients.\nSince our main interest is in the long-run effects of FDI on the domestic capital stock, we\ntest for the presence of a long-run cointegration relationship among our variables of\ninterest by estimating a cointegrated panel model (Breitung 2005). For a VAR(1) model,\nthe cointegrated model has the following Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)\nrepresentation:\nit\nt\ni\ni\nit\ny\ny \n\n +\n=\n\n,\nwith t = 0,1,...,T and i = 1,...,N, ( ) 0\n=\nit\nE  , ( )\n'\nit it\nE\n\n  \n= . This specification requires the\nlong-run cointegration relationship (  ) to be identical across cross-sections while the\nloading coefficients and thus the speed of adjustment (\ni\n ) vary for each industry i. Since\nthe cointegration estimator requires a balanced panel, we drop all industries which have\nincomplete time series for the main variables of interest. This leaves us with our sample\nBefore looking at the estimated long-run cointegration coefficients, Table 4 provides\nresults of cointegration tests. These results support the presence of cointegration\nrelationships among the variables of interest. Some specifications for the domestic capital\nstock at the industry-level are exceptions. Yet, these specifications apply tests for panel\ncointegration which do not allow for cross-section heterogeneity. This is an unrealistic\nassumption considering the ongoing process of structural change and thus different time\ntrends across industries.\nIn Tables 5a and 5b, we present estimates for the long-run cointegration coefficients\nusing four different specifications: an OLS model, a fully modified OLS regression\n(FMOLS), a dynamic OLS regression (DOLS), and the Two-Step estimator proposed in\nBreitung (2005). Both, the FMOLS and the DOLS estimator, address serial correlation\nand endogeneity of the regressors. The FMOLS estimator corrects the OLS estimator\nnon-parametrically, while the DOLS estimator uses information from past and future\nleads and lags of all variables. We also present four specifications: the baseline\nspecifications for the domestic capital stock and the stock of inward FDI (Tables 5a\nand 5b) as well as the specifications using FDI of input and output sectors as additional\nexplanatory variables (Tables 5c and 5d). To save space, we report these specifications\nonly for the Two-Step estimator.\nBaseline Regressions\nTable 5a shows that our model explains about two thirds of the variation in the domestic\ncapital stock and FDI across industries. The explanatory power for inward FDI increases\nsignificantly as we add outward FDI as a regressor. Employment and wages have a\npositive and significant effect on the domestic capital stock. The employment and wage\nelasticities are estimated relatively consistently across the different specifications (around\n0.40), with a somewhat greater range for the wage elasticities. The impact of output is\npositive. Both, the stock of inward and of outward FDI have a positive effect on the\ndomestic capital stock, but the elasticities are small (0.04).\nInward FDI also reacts positively to outward FDI, but the estimated elasticity is much\nhigher than for the domestic capital stock (around 0.50) (Table 5b). Recall that inward\nFDI measures domestic investment of foreign-held firms. Thus, we expect inward FDI to\nreact to outward FDI as domestic investment of German multinationals. The larger\ncoefficient confirms our prediction that domestic capital investment of purely domestic\nfirms plus German multinationals should react less positively than domestic investment\nof foreign-held multinationals (inward FDI).\nThe main difference between the regressions for inward FDI and the domestic capital\nstock is the effect of the control variables. Employment has a negative impact on inward\nFDI, and the impact of wages differs across specifications. In the baseline equations, the\neffect of wages is positive as well, but it turns negative in some specifications if we\nadditionally use FDI measures as regressors. The elasticity of inward FDI with respect to\noutput is positive and significant. The estimated elasticity is close to one. The link\nbetween inward FDI and the domestic capital stock is positive and significant as well.\nInter-Sector Linkage Effects\nSo far, we have focused on the effects of FDI in the same sector on domestic capital.\nThese include intra-sector competition as well as linkage effects, to the extent that inputs\nand outputs are traded within sectors. Next, we turn to the results on inter-sector linkages.\nTables 5c and 5d have the results including the FDI of input and output sectors. In\naddition to inward and outward FDI of the same industry, we add inward and outward\nFDI of input and output sectors, and , as described in section 3.4. Generally,\nour results for the control variables are confirmed. For the domestic capital stock though,\nwe find no consistent effect of inward FDI in input or output sectors or of outward FDI in\noutput sectors. Even if some of these variables are significant, results are not stable across\nthe different types of specifications for the cointegration estimators. The effects of inward\nFDI in input sectors, for instance, is positive when using the FMOLS estimator\n(unreported) and insignificant when using the Two-Step estimator. Using the Two-Step\nestimator, inward FDI of output sectors even has a negative effect on the domestic capital\nstock, but this finding is not robust across unreported different model specifications. The\nonly inter-industry effect which has a consistent effect across specifications is that of\noutward FDI in input sectors. This variable has a positive and significant effect at least at\nthe 5% level of significant. This confirms our hypothesis that outward FDI which makes\ninput sectors more competitive has a positive spill-over effect.\nI\nit\nit\nFDI\nFor inward FDI, there is greater evidence for positive inter-sector linkages than for the\ndomestic capital stock. All four proxies of inter-industry linkages considered increase\ninward FDI. Moreover, the estimated elasticities are quite high (around 0.5). Thus, for the\ninvestment for foreign held multinationals, the coefficients have the predicted sign and\nare significant. Outward FDI in input sectors, which can be interpreted as a reduction of\noutput prices, leads to higher investment of foreign multinationals. Similarly, inward FDI\nin input sectors should lead to lower input prices, which explains the positive impact on\ndomestic investment.\nTo sum up the evidence on industry-linkages, we find consistent but rather weak effects\nof inter-industry effects of FDI on domestic investment. Hence, even when inter-industry\neffects are not taken into account, we can expect not to miss important effects with one\nparticular industry. Understanding the determinant of inward FDI, in contrast, requires\nusing information about inter-sector linkages. Note, in addition, that our measures of\ninput and output sector FDI capture the FDI of other industries only. Since almost a third\nof inputs and outputs is traded within industries, we cannot isolate this effect from the\noverall competition effects captured by our measures of same-sector FDI.\nEffects of industry concentration\nSplitting inward and outward FDI along different dimensions (results not reported) gives\nno clear answer to the question whether market-access-driven or production-cost-driven\nFDI is behind these results. On the one hand, outward FDI into different sectors (one\nproxy for vertical FDI) has a positive impact on the domestic capital stock. On the other\nhand, outward FDI into high-income countries (one proxy for horizontal FDI) has a\npositive effect as well. As regards inward FDI, FDI into different sectors and from high\nincome countries have a positive impact on the domestic capital stock.\nOur theoretical model shows that positive effects of outward FDI on the domestic capital\nstock are more likely the lower the price elasticity of product demand \u00ad and thus the\nlower the degree of competition. We do not have time-varying information on the price\nelasticity of product demand for different industries at hand. Hence, we proxy the degree\nof competition by the industry-level Herfindahl index. Information on the Herfindahl\nindex is obtained from the German Antitrust Commission, the Monopolkommission\nsample into sectors with a degree of competition above and below the median. Results for\nthese sample splits are reported in Table 6.8\nOur expectation is that a higher degree of competition in an industry makes a positive\nresponse of the domestic capital stock less likely. We would thus expect a less positive or\neven negative response of domestic capital (inward FDI) in industries with a Herfindahl\nbelow the median, and a more positive response in industries with a Herfindahl above the\n8 Note that the following results are based on fixed effects panel regressions using the first lags of each\nvariable to control for the endogeneity of the regressors and robust standard errors. We do not report\npanel cointegration test since the number of observations is relatively small for the individual sub-\nsamples.\nmedian. Our main results for domestic capital do not support this (see Table 6a). In both\nsub-samples, the effect of outward FDI is insignificant. However, in unreported fixed\neffects regressions the effect of outward FDI is weakly positive in sectors with a low\ndegree of competition and insignificant otherwise.\nEffects of the share of multinationals\nOur theoretical model also suggests that the number of multinational firms which are\nactive in an industry affect the response of the domestic capital stock to FDI. The higher\nthe share of multinationals, the more likely is a positive response. To test this prediction,\nwe use two time-invariant proxies for the importance of multinational firms in an\nindustry: the number of domestic headquarters of multinational firms and the number of\nforeign affiliates of domestic firms. Both measures are measured in relation to the total\nnumber of firms in an industry. For the domestic capital stock, our results strongly\nsupport our theoretical hypothesis. The effect of outward FDI on domestic capital is\npositive in industries with an above-average share of multinational firms. There is even\nweak evidence for a negative response of the domestic capital stocks in sectors with a\nbelow-average importance of multinational firms.\nInterestingly, these patterns in the data are not confirmed for the regressions using inward\nFDI as the dependent variable (see Table 6b). Here, the link between outward FDI and\nthe domestic capital stock is positive in all sub-samples, and the coefficient estimates are\neven higher in the industries with a high degree of competition. One reason for these\ndifferences in the responses of domestic capital and inward FDI could be that our proxies\nfor the degree of competition and the share of multinationals are related to domestic, not\nforeign industries. Therefore, results support our approach of treating the response of the\ndomestic capital stock and of inward FDI separately.\nThe analysis so far has focused on the long-run determinants of domestic investment.\nEarlier studies, in contrast, have focused on the short-run dynamics of the domestic\ncapital stock by using its first difference or gross capital formation as the dependent\nvariable. To check whether the relationships borne out in the long-run also affect the\nshort-run adjustment responses of the domestic capital stock, we have also estimated\nequation (3) using first differences of the data.\nTable 7 presents regression results using the growth of the domestic capital stock and of\ninward FDI as the dependent variable. All regressions are estimated using a panel fixed\neffects estimator with robust standard errors to correct for autocorrelation and\nheteroskedasticity. Tables 7a and 7b have the results for domestic capital and inward\nFDI. We present results of fixed effects panel regressions as well as of instrumental\nvariable regressions. Desai et al. (2005b) propose using weighted foreign GDP growth as\nan instrument for the foreign variables. However, Harrison and McMillan (2006) argue\nthat foreign variables such as GDP growth are significant determinants of domestic\nvariables (in their case employment) and thus propose using a set of exogenous foreign\nvariables (GDP per capita, tariffs, education expenditures, telephone mainlines etc.).\nHere, we simply used lagged FDI terms as well as lags of the remaining explanatory\nvariables as instruments.\nAll regressions are estimated without time fixed effects. The reason for not including\ntime fixed effects is that these would eliminate the general trend in the data. Our\nequations would explain the idiosyncratic deviations of the growth rates from these\ntrends. In unreported regressions, we have checked the sensitivity of our results by\nincluding time fixed effects. Some of the explanatory variables such as employment,\nvalue added, and wages become insignificant in these regressions, suggesting that these\nvariables in fact pick up trends in the data that are common to all cross-sections. Our\nmain results for the impact of FDI are unaffected by including time fixed effects.\nTurning to the results for the growth in the domestically-owned capital stock first, which\nare reported in Table 7a, we find positive effects of employment and wage growth. The\nelasticity of investment with regard to employment is about 0.2, the elasticity with regard\nto wages is about 0.3. The IV estimates yield higher elasticities for employment but lower\nvalues for wages. The impact of output growth is insignificant. These results are not\naffected by adding different measures of FDI as regressors. The FDI measures are\n(weakly) significant in only one specification, as we find a negative coefficient of the\ngrowth of inward FDI on the domestic capital stock. This effect is insignificant though in\nthe IV-estimates.\nWe also estimate the same set of regressions using the change in inward FDI instead of\ndomestic capital stock as the dependent variable. Results are given in Table 7b. Growth\nin the domestic capital stock is added as an additional explanatory variable, but the main\nresults are confirmed also by regressions excluding growth of the domestic capital stock.\nThe link between growth in inward FDI and our standard control variables is weak. If\nanything, there is a positive impact of growth in value added. In contrast to the results for\ndomestic capital, we now find a positive and significant impact of growth in outward FDI\n(both in terms of volume and in terms of the number of firms investing abroad) on inward\nFDI. This effect is insignificant though in the IV estimates.\nOverall, results using the first difference of the domestic capital stock as the dependent\nvariable provide less stable results on the link between the stock of foreign investment\nand the domestic capital stock. Moreover, these estimates do not inform us about the\nunderlying long-run relationships in the data.\nWhat are the effects of the increasing activities of multinational firms on the home\neconomy? Much of the earlier literature addressing the home-country effects of FDI\nstresses labor market implications, and many recent papers use firm-level data. The focus\nof this paper is on the long-run implications of FDI on the domestic capital stock and on\nthe effects of FDI at the industry-level. Our approach also allows distinguishing intra-\nsector competition from inter-sector linkage effects.\nOur theoretical model has shown that the impact of FDI on domestic investment depends\non the motive that drives the foreign investment as well as on the industry from which\nthis foreign investment originates. Market seeking investment tends to have a positive\nimpact, production cost motivated investments can have both a positive and a negative\nimpact. In the latter case, it is more likely to be positive the less price elastic industry\ndemand and the larger the share of multinational firms in this industry. FDI in input\nindustries tends to have a positive impact on the domestic capital stock whereas FDI in\noutput industries can have a positive or a negative effect.\nOur empirical results based on a detailed dataset on German FDI can be summarized as\nfollows:\nFirst, in the long-run, the effect of FDI on the domestic capital stock across industries is\npositive. This holds for the capital stock owned by domestic investors and the stock of\ninward FDI. For the domestic capital stock, this positive effect tends to be stronger the\nmore multinational firms are active in an industry, as predicted by our model.\nSecond, we split FDI into proxies for FDI driven by market-access considerations and\nFDI driven by cost considerations. Generally, we confirm the positive impact of FDI on\nthe domestic capital stock. However, results give no clear-cut implications as to whether\nthis effect is driven by a particular type of FDI.\nThird, FDI of other input and output sectors has no significant impact on the domestic\ncapital stock. The stock of inward FDI increases though if other input and output sectors\nengage in more FDI. When assessing the effects of FDI on the domestic capital stock,\nintra-sector effects thus dominate. Due to a high share of inputs and outputs that are\ntraded within industries, this may be due to both, competition and linkage effects.\nFourth, understanding the long-run impact of FDI on domestic economic activity requires\nestimating the long-run (cointegration) parameters. Estimating the model in first\ndifferences shows that the short-run link between the domestic capital stock and the stock\nof FDI is rather weak.\nOverall, we show that the activities of multinationals affect the allocation of capital\nacross industries. At the aggregated level, increasing activities of German firms abroad\nand \u00ad to a somewhat smaller degree \u00ad of foreign firms in Germany have been associated\nwith relatively stable patterns of the capital stock and employment. Yet, at the industry-\nlevel, differences are quite distinct. Industries that have invested more abroad have, in the\nlonger run, also increased their domestic capital stock.\n6 References\nBanerjee, A., M. Marcellino, and C. Osbat (2005).
