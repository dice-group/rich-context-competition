However, the existence of minority\nenrichment programs is challenged by recent changes in the political and economic environment,including the sharp reduction\nof federal funding support in 2006.This article presents case studies of two longitudinal minority enrichment programs located\nin Chicago, Illinois: the Urban Health Program (UHP) of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the Chicago Area Health\nand Medical Career Program (CAHMCP) at Illinois Institute of Technology. Prior to the cuts in federal funding, in 2005, we\nconducted in-person interviews with administrative staff of the two programs.The qualitative data were supplemented with\nfollow-up interviews conducted in 2008 with directors of the programs.During the interviews,we discussed how the programs\nresponded to the budget cuts and how the programs viewed their future prospects.The results of the study indicated that\nadequate funding is crucial for the continued success of these minority enrichment programs in ensuring a viable health\nprofessions pipeline.\n",

The report further\nargued that increasing the diversity of the health care\nworkforce is a necessary step toward the reduction of\nhealth disparities that adversely affect racial and ethnic\ncommunities in the United States. Various attempts to\nincrease the diversity of the U.S. health care workforce\nwere attempted. Included among these efforts were minor-\nity enrichment programs established in many universities\nand medical schools to promote careers in health profes-\nsions to students who are from underrepresented minority\n(URM) groups or are economically disadvantaged.\nHowever, the programs are now threatened by sharp\nreductions in federal funding. Case studies of two minor-\nity enrichment programs examine how the program direc-\ntors responded to the reductions in funding.\nBackground--Underrepresented\nRacial and Ethnic Groups in the\nHealth Professions\nAccording to the American Association of Medical Colleges,\nracial and ethnic groups are considered as \"underrepre-\nsented\" in a health profession if their proportional represen-\ntation in that profession is less than their representation\nwithin the general population (Association of American\nU.S. populations were Hispanic (all races), 12% were non-\nHispanic African Americans, and 0.9% were non-Hispanic\nNative Americans (U.S. Census, 2010). Yet, these groups\n1Governors State University, University Park, IL, USA\n2Central Michigan University, Mt.

Based on this defi-\nnition, Asians as a whole are not considered underrepre-\nsented in most health professions and are actually\noverrepresented based on their proportion of the U.S. popu-\nlation. However, some Asian subpopulations, such as\nCambodian and Samoan ethnicities, are considered under-\nrepresented (Smedley, Stith, & Nelson, 2003).\nBefore 1960, racial and ethnic minorities comprised less\nthan 2% of new U.S. medical school enrollees (Cohen,\nGabriel, & Terrell, 2002). Since then, the representation of\nminorities in medical school enrollments has risen apprecia-\nmedical school programs were Hispanic (all races), and\nDespite the growing proportion of minority medical students\nduring the past 40 years, the representation in medical school\nenrollment is still significantly below that of the U.S.\npopulation.\nMethod and Analysis\nThis study uses a Hermeneutic Dialectic Process methodol-\nogy (Guba, 1990) to gather data in the qualitative part of this\nresearch. The analysis of the data began with the construc-\ntion of the interview guide. This process was continually\nenhanced as the interviews progressed. The hermeneutic\naspect consisted of depicting individual constructions as\naccurately as possible, while the dialectic aspect consisted of\ncomparing and contrasting these existing individual (includ-\ning the researcher's) constructions, so that each person inter-\nviewed confronts and came to terms with the constructions\nbased on their own and other's perspectives (Guba, 1990).\nThe belief that each of us (the interviewer and those inter-\nviewed) brought individual interpretations to the table was\nthe basis for the methodology of this study. This method\nallowed for the interpretation of data in a collaborative and\ncommunicative manner, with the aim of generating one (or a\nfew) construction(s) on a substantial consensus (Guba,\n1990). Through this process, the researcher was able to\naddress from a qualitative perspective whether or not the\nfunding, program design, and outside program support for\ncareer development and enrichment programs affected the\nefficacy of the programs in producing a viable pipeline of\nracially/ethnically diverse health professions students.\nThis study consisted of 10 interviews across the two pro-\ngrams, Chicago Area Health and Medical Career Program\n(CAHMCP) and University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)\nUrban Health Program (UHP). Five individuals represented\nthe CAHMCP Program and five represented the UHP pro-\ngram. The results of the interviews were organized around\nthemes. The interviews contained 15 questions asked of each\nof the subjects, the first 4 being demographic in nature, and\nthe remaining 11 questions subjective and related to the\nstructure and function of each program--program design\nand implementation, institutional commitment, and outside\nprogram support from the local and corporate community.\nBefore conducting the interviews, a structured interview\nguide was developed, which ensured that the interviews\nwere conducted in a consistent fashion and that all relevant\nareas were covered. To ensure the questions were clear and\nunambiguous, field-tests were performed via mock inter-\nviews with five individuals who were either program manag-\ners or members of an academic faculty.\nThis study, which focuses on factors associated with the\neffectiveness and efficiency of minority enrichment pro-\ngrams, relied heavily on key informants'responses to the fol-\nlowing five questions:\n1. What is the goal of your enrichment program?\n2. How do you measure the success of your program?\n3. What are the strengths of your enrichment pro-\ngram?\n4. What are the barriers to the success of the pro-\ngrams?\n5. What impact do you feel your program has in\nimproving the pipeline of underrepresented minor-\nities in the health professions?\nThe responses to Questions 2 through 5 were organized\naround themes. The themes are outlined in Table 1.\nThe analysis consisted of three parts. First, the two minor-\nity enrichment programs in the study are described, includ-\ning a discussion of the similarities and differences among the\ngroups. Second, the analyses from key informant interviews\nwith executive and administrative staff of the two programs\nin 2005 are presented prior to the cuts in federal funding.\nFinally, the findings from the follow-up interviews, which\nwere conducted with the program directors in early 2008, are\npresented.\nThe program offerings and descriptions came from a vari-\nety of sources. Both programs maintain websites that pro-\nvided the program's mission, organizational structure,\nprogram design, activities, and the relationships with their\nacademic partners. Financial data were obtained from the\nannual budget reports for the two programs along with a\nreview of program's policies and procedures. Furthermore,\nthe primary researcher toured the offices and facilities of\nboth programs to obtain additional details of the program.\nThe interviews with key informants and the administrative\nstaff provided the most valuable information and provided\nadditional descriptive information about each program\n(described below).\nAll of the interviewees were directors or in high-level\nadministrative positions. All had master's degrees, and four\nof the interviewees had doctorates. Many of the interviewees\nhad received graduate training in more than one substantive\narea. The most common areas of training were health admin-\nistration, public health, and education. Both the CAHMCP\nand UHP programs served URM students from the following\nEvans et al. 3\ngroups: African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native\nAmerican/Native Alaskan/Native Hawaiian. Both programs\nhave representations from Asians and Caucasians. The\nCAHMCP program categorizes them as \"affiliates, who are\nindividuals who state they want to serve in health profes-\nsions shortage communities,\" while the UHP program\ndescribes them as \"economically and educationally disad-\nvantaged individuals.\" The CAHMCP program also serves\nindividuals of all races diagnosed with a learning disability.\nWhen asked the question \"What is the goal of your enrich-\nment program?\" interviewees from both programs gave sim-\nilar responses. This supported the goals of the Illinois Board\nof Higher Education's (IBHE) goal of being \"dedicated to\nproactive efforts regarding the advancement of access and\ndiversity throughout higher education in Illinois, and extend-\ning the voice of underrepresented student populations.\" The\nDirector of CAHMCP states, \"To increase the number of\nunderrepresented minorities in the health professions who\npractice in the State of Illinois.\" And the Executive Director\nof the UIC UHP states,\nTo improve the quality of health care services for\nmedically underserved urban populations, especially\nthose in Health Professions Shortage Areas of Illinois,\nby expanding health professions education opportuni-\nties for underrepresented groups (African Americans,\nHispanic Americans, Mainland Puerto Ricans, and\nNative Americans).\nThe responses from the other participants were in line\nwith the themes of each of these quotes.\nThe Importance of a Diverse Health\nCare Workforce\nIn recent years, a variety of studies have argued that to\nincrease the diversity of the U.S. health care workforce, a\nwide variety of policy enhancements must occur, including\nthe reduction of health disparities (Cohen et al., 2002;\nSullivan Commission Report, 2004). An increase in the sup-\nply of minority health care providers will likely increase\naccess to health care in minority communities. Previous\nresearch showed that Black and Hispanic physicians are\nespecially likely to treat disenfranchised patients and patients\nfrom their own race and ethnicity group (Xu et al., 1997).\nResearch also found that Blacks and Hispanics as compared\nwith other physicians are more likely to practice in neigh-\nborhoods where a high percentage of the population is from\ntheir own race and ethnicity (Saha, Taggart, Komaromy, &\nBindman, 2000). Increasing the supply of URM physicians\nwill aid in increasing the degree of racial concordance in\nphysician\u00adpatient relationships. Recent studies found that\nminority patients often prefer to be cared for by physicians\nof their own race and ethnicity (Saha et al., 2000). When\nphysicians of their own race and ethnicity treat patients, they\nhave longer physician visits, have more engaged and respon-\nsive interactions with their physicians, have higher utiliza-\ntion of health care services, and are less likely to postpone\nseeking health care (Saha et al., 2000).\nBoth the UHP at UIC and the CAHMCP were developed\nas outgrowths from community demands resulting in legisla-\ntive and policy funding and support. Since their inception in\nthe late 1970s, much has changed on a national and local\nfront from a political standpoint, yet Illinois State legislators\nhave continued to support program funding for these Medical\nHealth Professional Education Programs (MHPEPs) in part.\nAccordingly, the Evans's (2006) report revealed that funding\nwas identified as the most significant barrier to success for\nboth programs; CAHMCP 50% and UIC UHP 56%. The\npresence of URM students plays a crucial role in preparing a\nculturally competent workforce (Cohen et al., 2002). The\ngroups classified as URM students include ethnic groups\nincludingAfricanAmerican, Hispanic, and NativeAmericans\nwhose representation among professionals in health sciences\nTable 1.

This argument is central to the\nUniversity of Michigan's defense against antiaffirmative\naction lawsuits that challenged the admissions policies to\ntheir undergraduate school and law school (Cohen et al.,\n2002). A more diverse health care workforce will lead to\ngreater diversity among medically trained health care man-\nagers, policy makers, and researchers, who in turn may\nincrease the promotion and development of health policies\nand health care research priorities that would better suit the\nneeds of the increasingly diverse U.S. population (Cohen\nEfforts to Increase URMs in the\nHealth Professions\nAny effort to improve health care services or control costs\nmust consider the supply, distribution, use, and education of\nthe health care workforce (Kovner & Salisburg, 1999). The\nhealth care workforce is large and diverse. It ranges from\nhighly educated and highly paid professionals to caregivers,\nskilled technicians, and semiskilled workers. In 1994, there\nwere approximately 12 million health care workers, which\nrepresent approximately 10% of the nation's total workforce.\nBy the year 2018, the Department of Labor projected that\nand studies indicate that there is a need to produce sufficient\nnumbers and types of health professionals to meet the\ndemands of a diverse society (Gupta & Konrad, 1992).\nFindings of the 1993 Pew Report stated that nurses and allied\nhealth professionals would be essential players on the future\nprimary and preventive health care system. In addition, the\nreport emphasized the need to increase the number of minor-\nity health professionals, which was also a goal of the Healthy\nPeople 2000 initiative and was carried over in the Healthy\nPeople 2010 efforts (U.S. Department of Health and Human\nOne of the main barriers to better URM representation is\nthe costs associated with health professions education. Many\nURM students do not have the economic resources required\nto finance a health profession career. In accordance with the\nNational Institute of Medicine (IOM; 2004), on average,\nURM student resources are more limited compared with\ntheir majority counterparts: \"Because of the cost barrier to\nURM students, they may be discouraged from entering\nhealth professions training programs when faced with the\nprospect of high debt\" (p. 23). Many leaders in the health\ncare field have called for a reexamination of the costs and\nfinancing of health professions training to significantly\nreduce or eliminate many training costs, particularly for\nthose students who serve in the public sector. Promoting and\nencouraging health professionals to work in health care\nshortage areas are likely to increase access to care for medi-\ncally underserved populations.\nPublic and private organizations have tackled the chal-\nlenge and designed initiatives to assist URM students in\nfinancing the costs of their education and training. Some\nprovide direct financial assistance to students and others\nindirectly support URM students through funding provided\nto institutions for diversity activities. All of the organiza-\ntions, however, provide support to increase URM participa-\ntion in health professions and reduce financial barriers,\ndirectly or indirectly, for students who experience difficulty\nfinancing their training (Transportation Research Board,\nAnother challenge to achieving better URM representa-\ntion in health professions training programs relates to admis-\nsions policies and practices, which vary widely from\ndiscipline to discipline and among institutions. These varia-\ntions are reflected in the differences in entrance require-\nments, discipline-specific criteria, and institutional mission.\nAlmost all of the policies include standardized admission\ntest data and qualitative information (e.g., applicants' per-\nsonal characteristics, background, and motivation to enter\nhealth professions fields) to arrive at admissions decisions.\nPolicies and practices influence racial and ethnic diversity in\ngraduate health professions training programs. Standardized,\nnorm-referenced tests (e.g., the Medical College Admission\nTest [MCAT], Dental Aptitude Test [DAT], and Graduate\nRecord Examination [GRE]) are still critical in the admis-\nsions process. The IOM suggests that alternative admission\nmodels should be reviewed as well as their implications for\nURM applicant success in the admissions process. Finally, it\nis very important that organizations have an institutional cli-\nmate for diversity. This includes strategies that encourage the\nintroduction of diverse viewpoints and an appreciation of the\nuniqueness of the individual and the richness of the culture\nand backgrounds of the students. In most cases, there needs\nto be \"holistic\" institutional change. Evidence suggests that\nefforts to enhance diversity require comprehensive, system-\natic changes in the way institutions value and respond to\ndiversity. By themselves, diversity programs (e.g., sensitiv-\nity training, cultural programs, and workshops) are unlikely\nto affect meaningful change absent systemic, integrated\ndiversity efforts.\nDiversity must be institutionalized and leaders--\nincluding university presidents, deans, governance bodies,\ndepartment chairs, and other administrators--must clearly\narticulate the importance of diversity for the institutional\nmission. In addition, institutional leaders must establish\nclear guidance for all students, faculty, and staff regarding\ndiversity goals and the roles all members of the campus com-\nmunity must adopt to attain diversity and inclusion goals.\nMinority Enrichment Programs\nMany medical schools and universities have established\nminority enrichment programs to promote careers in the\nhealth professions among students from URM groups and\nEvans et al. 5\namong students who are economically disadvantaged. The\nsupport services provided by these programs may include\npersonal counseling, the development of study skills, assis-\ntance in test preparation, networking opportunities, and\nfinancial assistance.\nMinority enrichment programs vary considerably in orga-\nnization and format. For example, summer enrichment pro-\ngrams, which typically last for several weeks, are designed\nto increase interest in the health professions and to help stu-\ndents successfully compete for admission into professional\nschools. On the other end of the spectrum, pipeline programs\nmaintain long-term relationships with students, by providing\nsupport from high school to the completion of their training\nand entry into health professions.\nResearch Questions\nResearch Questions 1: Does funding, program design,\nand program support influence the effectiveness\nof career development and enrichment programs\nin improving the pipeline of racially/ethnically\ndiverse students in the health care field?\nResearch Questions 2: Do the CAHMCP and UIC\nUHP have differences in their respective designs\nthat have a positive or negative impact on the pro-\ngram's effectiveness?\nResearch Questions 3: How have the funding cuts from\nthe government affected programs in continuing to\nimprove the pipeline of racially/ethnically diverse\nstudents for the health care field?\nOur study interviewed staff members from two minority\nenrichment programs in Chicago, Illinois: the CAHMCP\n(pronounced \"Champ\") based at the Illinois Institute of\nTechnology and the UHP at the UIC.\nA consortium consisting of the Illinois Institute of\nTechnology and seven Chicago-area medical schools estab-\nlished CAHMCP (CAHMCP Description, 2006). Its mission\nwas to increase the number of students from URM groups\nwho are admitted to and graduate from Illinois medical\nschools. Later, the scope of CAHMCP's mission was\nexpanded to include health professions other than medicine\n(e.g., dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, public health, etc.).\nCAHMCP identifies and recruits participants to the program\nat an early point in their academic development and provides\nacademic counseling, motivation, and financial support until\ntheir entry into one of the health professions.\nThe UHP at the UIC has the mission of recruiting minor-\nity students into the health professions who wish, upon grad-\nuation, to practice in medically underserved urban areas\n(Amuwo, Scrimshaw, Adefuye, & Washington-Calvin,\n2006). The program coordinates programs in each of six\nhealth colleges within the UIC system (medicine, dentistry,\nnursing, pharmacy, public health, and applied health sci-\nence), including graduate programs. In addition, UHP\ncollaborates with the UIC's Early Outreach Program, which\nidentifies talented minority students early in their academic\ncareers and grooms them for college. It also collaborates\nwith the UIC's Academic Center for Excellence to provide\nadvice and academic counseling to university undergradu-\nates who plan to enter the health professions.\nFindings\nCAHMCP and UHP are similar in a number of respects.\nCAHMCP in 1979. Their missions are comparable. Both are\nlongitudinal intervention or \"pipeline\" programs, which\nidentify and recruit promising middle school and high\nschool students and provide them with academic and moti-\nvational support to develop the basic skills needed for a\ncareer in the health professions. With both programs, this\nsupport continues while they complete their training. Both\nprograms target URM students, includingAfricanAmericans,\nHispanics/Latinos, Native Americans, Native Alaskans, and\nNative Hawaiians. CAHMCP includes a small number of\nAsians and Caucasians who have indicated a desire to serve\nin health professional shortage areas. The UHP program\nincludes \"economically and educationally disadvantaged\nindividuals\" of all races and ethnicities (CAHMCP\nThere are also several significant differences between the\nCAHMCP and UHP programs. First, the two programs differ\nin their internal organization and in their relationships with\naffiliated institutions. CAHMCP serves a variety of medical\nschools, dental schools, and other health professions schools.\nHowever, it operates as an independent not-for-profit proj-\nect. It is housed on the campus of the Illinois Institute of\nTechnology but it has no direct ties to that university. In con-\ntrast, UHP is affiliated with only the UIC. Its activities are\ndivided across eight colleges and programs. UHP's opera-\ntions are, in some respects, more decentralized than\nCAHMCP's program, with the fact that the respective deans\nof each of the major health professions school control and\nexecute the programs independently.\nAnother major difference between the two programs is\nhow the programs are funded. UHP receives both state and\nfederal funding, augmented by foundation grants received\ndirectly by the colleges. CAHMCP, however, receives a\ndirect appropriation from the IBHE. CAHMCP received an\nUS$90,000. Although UHP received far less money from the\nstate, it received much more money from other sources. The\ntotal UHP program operated on an average budget of\nThere are also differences in how the two programs are\nstaffed. The CAHMCP program operates with seven paid\nfull-time employees (FTE). The UHP program operates with\nfour FTEs in a central office and an additional eight FTEs\n6 SAGE Open\nwho are employed by the Deans of the Colleges of Medicine,\nDentistry, Public Health, Pharmacy, Graduate Studies, and\nAllied Health Sciences. There are an additional two FTEs in\nthe Early Outreach Program and the Office of Admissions\nand Records.\nResults From the Initial Key\nInformant Interviews\nProgram Goals (Table 1) identifies the themes used to pres-\nent findings from key informant interviews. When asked the\nquestion, \"What is the goal of your enrichment program?\"\nkey informants from both the CAHMCP and UHP programs\ngave similar responses. The Director of CAHMCP stated\nthat the mission of that program is \"to increase the number\nof underrepresented minorities in the health professions who\npractice in the State of Illinois.\" Similarly, the Executive\nDirector of the UHP program stated that the mission of that\nprogram is\n[t]o improve the quality of health care services for\nmedically underserved urban populations, especially\nthose in Health Professions Shortage Areas of Illinois,\nby expanding health professions education opportuni-\nties for underrepresented groups (African Americans,\nHispanic Americans, Mainland Puerto Ricans, and\nNative Americans).\nThe responses from the other key informants were in line\nwith the statements made by the program directors. Thus,\nthe goals of both programs, as stated by the program direc-\ntors and other key informants, strongly support the IBHE's\ngoals of \"proactive efforts regarding the advancement of\naccess and diversity throughout higher education in Illinois,\nand extend[ing] the voice of underrepresented student popu-\nMeasures of Success (Table 2) present the key informant\nresponses to the question \"How do you measure the success\nof your program?\" The most frequent responses among\nCAHMCP key informants indicated the percentage of stu-\ndents who enter the health professions and the number\nadmitted to professional programs as the key measure of suc-\ncess. The key informants stated that they measure success by\n\"the number of underrepresented students provided the\nopportunity to pursue a career in a professional health pro-\ngram\" and by measuring \"the number of students who\nmatriculate from one level to the next.\"\nThe most frequent response among UHP key informants\nstated that the number of students who graduate from a\nhealth professions program is the key metric to success.\nHowever, some key informants also measured program suc-\ncess by other milestones in the students' academic career--\nfor example, the numbers who are recruited into the program,\nwho are admitted to professional programs, and who eventu-\nally enter the health professions. One UHP key informant\nstated, \"Every program component is evaluated individually.\nEach student is tracked to monitor their improvement in\nmath, science and test results, especially in verbal and quan-\ntitative sections.\" Another key informant included as a mea-\nsure of program success, \"the number of individuals who\nreturn to serve the underrepresented communities of the\nState of Illinois.\"\nProgram Strengths (Table 3) presents key informant\nresponses to the question \"What are the strengths of your\nenrichment program?\" One of the most frequent responses\nemphasized the support provided to students in the program\nas their key strength. A key informant from UHP listed as\nimportant program strengths \"the academic support and\ncounseling provided to students, review materials, tutoring,\noutreach, and stipends.\"\nKey informants from both programs considered the qual-\nity of faculty and staff to be strength. In addition, the staff of\nboth programs considered the long-term relationships with\nstudents to be an important strength. A UHP key informant\nstated that, \"a major strength is the ability to follow students\nthrough training and practice.\" Similarly, a CAHMCP key\ninformant noted that the program \"functions as a family; par-\nticipation is life long.\"\nBarriers to Success (Table 4) presents key informant\nresponses to the question \"What are the barriers to the suc-\ncess of the programs?\" The key informants from both pro-\ngrams considered the lack of resources and funding to be a\nsignificant barrier. A CAHMCP key informant noted that\nthere was \"not enough money or human resources to sup-\nport additional students or expand programs\" and that \"state\nbudgets cuts threaten continuation of the program.\" Funding\nconcerns are also evident in the responses about the lack of\nresources to provide student support. A CAHMCP key\ninformant noted the lack of \"appropriate funding necessary\nto support students who have financial difficulties\" and the\nlack of funds for \"diagnostic testing and supplemental\ncourses.\" In both programs, there were concerns that the\nlack of program visibility might present a barrier to the pro-\ngram's success. In addition, a number of UHP key infor-\nmants expressed concerns about the university not fully\nengaged and accepting of the program's mission. One key\ninformant stated, \"the barriers to the success of the program\nconsist of a lack of acceptance of the program by some fac-\nulty and administrators.\" Another stated that, \"some of the\nadmissions and faculty members are indifferent to the uni-\nversity's diversity goals.\" A third noted that there was \"push\nback from majority students and faculty.\" A fourth UHP key\ninformant indicated that the program faced obstacles pre-\nsented by the entire educational system. \"Students are not\nbeing prepared properly for higher education. Some of the\nreasons for this are social economic factors, educational\nachievement of the parents, financial support, family sup-\nport, and low self-esteem.\"\nImpact of the Program (Table 5) presents the distribu-\ntions of responses to the question \"What impact do you\nEvans et al. 7\nbelieve your program has had in improving the pipeline\nof underrepresented minorities in the health profes-\nsions?\" In general, the key informants believed their\nimpact was evident in the number of students entering the\nhealth professions and the number admitted into profes-\nsional training programs. A CAHMCP key informant\nnoted that, \"our programs have prevented the state of\nIllinois from having a large deficit in the numbers of\nunderrepresented health professionals.\" Similarly, a key\ninformant from UHP noted,\nThe program has definitely contributed to improving\nthe pipeline of underrepresented minorities in the\nhealth professions. This is illustrated through the num-\nber of graduates from the UIC medical program. If the\nprogram were discontinued, students would have dif-\nficulties in the program, which could lead to dismissal.\nThe pipeline would be disrupted.\nFollow-Up Interviews With Program\nDirectors\nFollow-up interviews were conducted with the directors of\nboth of the programs highlighted in the initial study to deter-\nmine what if any changes have resulted from the federal cuts\nin the programs' funding. According to CAHMCP data,\nsince the early 1980s, the program's \"pipeline\" has been\ntraversed by more than 4,000 individuals who have earned\nat least baccalaureates in the sciences and more than 1,300\nof whom have gone on to be medicine, osteopathy, dentistry,\nveterinary science, optometry, pharmacy, public health, and\npodiatry (MODVOPPP) professionals. A CAHMCP middle\nschool\u00adlevel student has better than a 95% probability of\ncompleting college in 5 years or less and a 80% probability\nof being enrolled in postbaccalaureate degree study within 2\nyears following completion of his or her undergraduate\ndegree. CAHMCP grads also include professionals such as\nTable 2.

The UIC has state\ncommitment, even with the funding cuts to continue to sup-\nport the UHP's mission to improve the quality of health care\nservices for medically underserved urban populations.\nSpecial focus on those in Health Professions Shortage Areas\nof Illinois is given by expanding health professions educa-\ntion opportunities for underrepresented groups (African\nAmericans, Hispanic Americans, Mainland Puerto Ricans,\nand Native Americans). The UIC celebrated their 30-year\nanniversary of the program and proudly profess that approxi-\nmately 70% of the African American and Latino physicians\nwho practice in Chicago are UIC graduates. The journal\nBlack Issues in Higher Education has ranked UIC third for\nthe past 15 years among the top 100 institutions in granting\nmedical degrees to minority students.\nDiscussion\nURM students are more likely than non-URM students to\ncome from low-income families; however, most low-income\nstudents are White. Policies that solely target financial sup-\nport to low-income students may or may not successfully\nhelp URM students to access and succeed in health profes-\nsions training programs. Therefore, it is important to imple-\nment financial strategies in conjunction with other\n\"race-conscious\" interventions targeting, for example,\nadmissions and accreditation policies.\nContributing to the problem is the recent attack on\nprograms that attempted to improve diversity in higher\neducation--for example, the lawsuits filed against the\nUniversity of Michigan and the University of California pro-\ngrams. Another example is the affirmative action rollbacks\nacross several states that produced severe reductions in\nAfrican Americans in college, law, and medical school\nadmissions (Turner, Gonz\u00e1lez, & Wood, 2008). The sudden\nand radical change in African American enrollments lead\none to the racial scoring gap between African Americans and\nCaucasians on standardized business school admissions tests\n(Turner et al., 2008). In a race-blind admissions system,\nadmissions officers must rely heavily on test scores. Because\nof grade inflation and extreme differences in academic rigor\nbetween various undergraduate institutions, grade point\naverages from different schools are of little value to officials\nwho must decide whether to admit a given student. In a race-\nblind admissions environment, scoring results on standard-\nized admissions tests will lead to the rejection of all but a\nsmall percentage of African American applicants.\nImplications for Future Research\nThis study suggested the need for further research in the area\nof developing the health professions workforce and ensuring\nthe diversity of that workforce. This study only addressed\nthe pipeline of URM students in a few targeted health pro-\nfessions. A logical follow-up study could address additional\nresearch to assess diversity among health professionals not\nonly within medical careers but also in executive administra-\ntion and academia. This will further identify the benefits of\ndiversity for holistic health care service delivery system.\nThis study did not address comparisons between individ-\nuals who participated in the MHPEP and those who did not\nbecause of data limitations. The data from such a study could\nanswer in a quantitative way the impact of the programs.\nAnother area for further study could include studying quali-\ntative attributes of applicants that may more accurately pre-\ndict success in health professions careers (e.g., patient\nsensitivity, leadership, commitment to service, cultural\ncompetence, linguistic ability, and interpersonal skills).\nFurthermore, an interesting research area could compare the\npeak years of URM participation in the mid-1990s to current\nyears, to determine whether there was a reduction in URM\napplicants and evaluate the causes of those reductions.\nStudy Limitations\nAfter collecting the data related to student participation in\nthe two MHPEP programs, some important limitations were\ndiscovered that prevented testing of the original hypothesis.\nThe most important limitation was that the data available\nwere for those individuals who participated in the MHPEP\nprograms. To test the hypothesis related to the programs'\nability to ensure entrance into professional school, data\nwould be needed on two groups of individuals: those who\nparticipated in MHPEP and those who did not. If those data\nwere available, the study could measure odds of admission\nbased on the participation in the MHPEP program. Because\nof the aforementioned limitation, an alternative analysis plan\nwas developed and an alternative hypothesis was con-\nstructed and used in the study.\nThe interaction and influences of three factors limited the\ninterpretations and conclusions of this study: the researcher's\nbiases, the interpretive method, and the selection of the case.\nThese factors, although limiting, are acceptable components\nof qualitative research methodology. Outcome bias can result\nfrom the use of unreliable methods or instruments as well as\ninadequate sample size or comparison groups. Selection bias\ncan also exist in the admission requirements between the dif-\nferent universities. The CAHMCP program, for instance, had\na special relationship with Rosalyn Franklin School of the\nHealth Professions (formerly Chicago Medical School),\nwhich worked with the CAHMCP program to ensure the\nmost favorable outcome for the students. The two MHPEP\nprograms serve a similar demographic population, but there\nare differences in the program offerings and approaches. In\naddition, each program had dissimilar levels of support and/\nor resources.\nThere are a number of ways to ensure the reliability and\nvalidity of this research study. The comparative case study\napproach strengthened the external validity of the research.\nTo ensure internal validity, the tools used to collect the data\nwere standardized to clearly define the scope and purpose of\nthe study. In addition, the questions were field-tested on\nthree program directors to ensure they were creditable and\nwell understood. The study focused on the intended con-\nstruct and purpose of the study, and not on any other problem\nor issue. However, as the interviews were not tape-recorded,\nthe interpretation of the notes was susceptible to recall bias.\nThis made the researcher depend solely on the ability to\ninterpret the notes accurately.\nConclusion\nThis study is supported by the literature and illustrates that\nthe CAHMCP and UIC UHP programs are effective in pro-\nducing a pipeline of URM health professionals. Both pro-\ngrams are, however, at risk due to the recent funding cut\nboth at the state and at federal levels makes it difficult for the\nprograms to continue. A further review of UIC UHP gradu-\nates and enrollees shows that the average number of enroll-\ncluded that enrollment for the MHPEPprogram has improved\nvastly over the compared period by 48%. The average UHP\nreview (233 average students graduated), it is concluded that\ngraduation rates also improved at approximately 16% over\nthe compared years. There continues to be a growing propor-\ntion of people from ethnic minority groups in the U.S. popu-\nlation and still there is a glaring shortage of minority health\nprofessionals and researchers in the country. This disparity\nis expected to worsen during the coming decades. Data sup-\nport the fact that Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians\ncomprise 26% of the U.S. population and they receive only\n16% of the undergraduate degrees and 9% of the doctoral\ndegrees in science and engineering (Shavers et al., 2005).\nOnly 11% of psychology PhD recipients are members of\nthese URM groups (Olson & Fagen, 2007). The National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH) reported that between 1999 and\ninstitutional research training grants of different types (e.g.,\nHispanic, and 0.18% were American Indian. The National\nInstitute of Mental Health (NIMH) reported that in 1998,\n16.9% of T32 trainees were Black, Hispanic, or American\nare members of these ethnic minority groups, they make up\nonly 3% to 4% of the principal investigators on NIH- and\nNIMH-funded research and program grants (Shavers et al.,\n2005). Shortages of health professionals in the United States\nin general and URM health professionals in particular will\nhave a serious impact on health care in the next 10 years. In\n2001, the American Hospital Association (AHA) predicted\nshortages of health care workers. The association surveyed\nhospital vacancies and found shortages of more than 10%\nfor nurses, imaging/radiology technicians, and pharmacists.\nSimilarly, high vacancy rates were seen across urban/rural\nsettings and different regions of the country. Over one in\nseven hospitals report a severe shortage of nurses with more\nare continuing while the population is aging. The uninsured\nand underinsured are continuing to grow and disparities\nabound. Programs similar to the two in this study are critical\nin continuing to have a viable URM pipeline to the health\nprofessions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Hospital Association.
