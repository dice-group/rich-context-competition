Trans-\nlational research calls for a shift in emphasis\nfrom just understanding what works (efficacy)\nto also understanding how it works in more `real\nworld' settings. This article describes the pro-\ncess evaluation design and findings, discuss how\nthese findings were used to better understand\nthe translational process and provide a set of\nprocess evaluation recommendations with com-\nmunity-based translational research. AFL com-\nmunity organizations across the United States\nimplemented one of two evidence-based PA\nprograms (Active Living Every Day--The Coo-\nper Institute; Human Kinetics Inc. or Active\nChoices--Stanford University). Both programs\nwere based on the transtheoretical model and\nsocial cognitive theory. Overall, the process\nevaluation revealed high-dose delivery and\nimplementation fidelity by quite varied commu-\nnity organizations serving diverse adult popula-\ntions. Findings reveal most variation occurred\nfor program elements requiring more partici-\npant engagement. Additionally, the results show\nhow a collaborative process allowed the organ-\nizations to `fit' the programs to their specific\nparticipant base while maintaining fidelity to\nessential program elements.\n",

Ory3, Diana Lattimore4,\nLaura Leviton5, Cynthia Castro6, Ruth Ann Carpenter7 and Carol Rheaume2\n Introduction\nPhysical activity (PA) plays a key role in promoting\nhealth and quality of life as adults age [1\u00ad3]. Un-\nfortunately, adults over the age of 50 are the least\nphysically active segment of the adult population\n[4, 5]. Recent studies show that PA in older adults\ncan be increased through behavior change programs\n[6, 7]. Individually adapted behavior change pro-\ngrams are strongly recommended as an approach to\nincrease PA [8]. However, little is known about\nhow these programs are implemented when taken\nout of the controlled research environment and dis-\nseminated for wider use in communities [9\u00ad11].\nTranslational research aids in understanding how\nprograms are adapted, if they are effective outside\nof research settings, and what factors moderate their\neffectiveness when implemented in less controlled\nProcess evaluation is used to identify program-\nmatic and contextual moderators of effectiveness\nand determine if a program was delivered as\ndesigned [14]. It also aids in understanding of\nhow programs were developed and why programs\nwere (or were not) successfully implemented [15\u00ad\n25].

In response to interest by\nthe sites, a 12-week adaptation of ALED was tested\nin AFLs the fourth year. Active Choices [AC; Stan-\nford University] provides one-on-one counseling\ndelivered through a face-to-face meeting followed\nby eight telephone counseling calls over a 6-month\nperiod [28\u00ad31]. More detailed descriptions of ses-\nsion topics and activities for the programs are found\nin Tables I and II. Both programs incorporate\nbehavior change strategies consistent with the\ntranstheoretical model [32] and social cognitive the-\nory [33]. According to the transtheoretical model,\npeople make changes gradually and in stages, and\nthe person's readiness for behavioral change should\nbe used to guide the types of intervention strategies\ndelivered. Social cognitive theory emphasizes the\nreciprocal interactions between the person, environ-\nment and behavior. Key intervention components\nfrom this theory include increasing self-efficacy and\nenhancing self-regulatory skills (goal setting, self-\nmonitoring, problem solving and self-reward).\nOrganizations responded to a competitive re-\nquest for proposals and indicated their preferences\nfor AC or ALED.
