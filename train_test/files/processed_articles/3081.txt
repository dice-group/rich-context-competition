Concerns include whether patients' ac-\ncess to large volumes of information will improve their\nhealth; whether the variable quality of the information\nwill have a deleterious effect; the effect on health dis-\nparities; and whether the physician-patient relationship\nwill be improved as patients become more equal part-\nners, or be damaged if physicians have difficulty adjust-\ning to a new role.\nMethods: Telephone survey of nationally representa-\ntive sample of the American public, with oversample of\npeople in poor health.\nhealth information on the Internet in the past 12 months,\n16% had found health information relevant to themselves\nand 8% had taken information from the Internet to their\nphysician. Looking for information on the Internet showed\nastrongdigitaldivide;however,onceinformationhadbeen\nlookedfor,socioeconomicfactorsdidnotpredictotherout-\ncomes. Most (71%) people who took information to the\nphysicianwantedthephysician'sopinion,ratherthanaspe-\ncific intervention. The effect of taking information to the\nphysician on the physician-patient relationship was likely\nto be positive as long as the physician had adequate com-\nmunication skills, and did not appear challenged by the pa-\ntient bringing in information.\nConclusions: For health information on the Internet to\nachieve its potential as a force for equity and patient well-\nbeing, actions are required to overcome the digital di-\nvide; assist the public in developing searching and ap-\npraisal skills; and ensure physicians have adequate\ncommunication skills.\nALTHOUGH USE of the Inter-\nnet continues to grow rap-\nidly, its impact on health\ncare is unclear. The advan-\ntages of the Internet as a\nsource of health information include con-\nvenient access to a massive volume of in-\nformation,easeofupdatinginformation,and\nthepotentialforinteractiveformatsthatpro-\nmote understanding and retention of infor-\nmation. Health information on the Inter-\nnet may make patients better informed,\nleading to better health outcomes, more ap-\npropriateuseofhealthserviceresources,and\na stronger physician-patient relationship.1\nHowever, health information on the Inter-\nnet may be misleading or misinterpreted,\ncompromising health behaviors and health\noutcomes, or resulting in inappropriate re-\nquests for clinical interventions.2,3 Physi-\ncians may accede to inappropriate re-\nquests, either because refusal is time-\nconsuming or because they fear refusal\nwould weaken the physician-patient rela-\ntionship.4,5 Respondingtoinappropriatepa-\ntient requests may be particularly difficult\nin managed care, where patients may be-\nlieve that physician refusals may be moti-\nvated by the need to control costs.6\nA second area of uncertainty is the im-\npact of the Internet on health disparities.\nThe Internet might reduce disparities if\nhealth information becomes available to\ndisadvantaged groups. However, it might\nincrease disparities if only higher socio-\neconomic groups are able to access health\ninformation, distinguish accurate from in-\naccurate information, and apply it to their\npersonal situation.\nFinally, it is unclear how health in-\nformation on the Internet will affect the\nphysician-patient relationship, the cor-\nnerstone of good medical care. Will it im-\nprove the relationship, as patients be-\ncome more active partners in their own\nhealth care? Or will physicians have dif-\nficulty adjusting as they no longer have\nunique access to medical information?\nThe evidence to date on these ques-\ntions is scanty.

Previous studies have ascertained how often\npatientsseekhealthinformationontheInternet.Ourstudy\ngoes further, by determining how often patients take in-\nformation from the Internet to a physician and explor-\ning what happens when this is done.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe survey was carried out between March 2000 and March\nous states. Households were selected through computerized ran-\ndom digit dialing generated through the Genesys Sampling Sys-\ntem. This stratified sampling technique ensured proper\nrepresentation of households in different regions of the coun-\ntry and in central city, suburban, and rural areas. Random-\ndigit selection also ensures sample representation of persons\nin households with \"unlisted\" telephone numbers. To ensure\na random selection of respondents at household level, partici-\npants were selected on the \"most recent birthday\" technique\nthat screens for an adult, 18 years or older, living in the house-\nhold, who has had the most recent birthday.\nVerbal informed consent was obtained from all respon-\ndents before they began the interview. Eligibility was limited\nto English and Spanish speakers without cognitive or physical\nimpairments that prevented completion of the interview. A small\nfinancial incentive was offered for completion of the inter-\nview. Where telephone numbers of nonrespondents could be\nmatched with an address, a maximum of 2 letters were sent to\nencourage response. The average administration time was 20\nminutes. All interviews were conducted by trained interview-\ners using computer-assisted telephone interviewing.\nAn oversample of individuals in poor health was achieved\nby screening a random subsample of households and includ-\ning only respondents who described their health as fair or poor\n(rather than excellent, very good, or good); had a disability or\nhandicap that prevented them from participating fully in school,\nwork, housework, or other activities; or had been hospitalized\nwithin the past 12 months, for reasons other than a normal de-\nlivery.\nThe survey instrument was developed following literature re-\nview and focus groups and was pretested on 92 individuals. The\ninterview was described as a survey on health issues, in par-\nticular how Americans make decisions about health care and\ntheir feelings about the health care available to them. No men-\ntion was made about the Internet in characterizing the study.\nThe first substantive questions were about different sources of\nhealth information. Subsequent questions identified respon-\ndents who had looked for health information on the Internet\nin the last 12 months and explored their experience of this, their\nperceptions of the quality of such information, their self-rated\nability to assess quality, and the use they had made of the in-\nformation. The final set of questions identified respondents who\nhad looked for health information on the Internet, found rel-\nevant information, and taken this information to their physi-\ncian. These questions concerned patient expectations of tak-\ning the information to their physician, their perceptions of, and\nsatisfaction with, the subsequent consultation, the impact on\nhealth service utilization, and the effect on the physician-\npatient relationship.\nDemographic and socioeconomic data, including age,\nself-defined ethnic origin, educational achievement, house-\nhold income per annum, health insurance status, and current\nhealth status were collected from all respondents. All respon-\ndents were also asked whether they had a relationship with a\nregular physician, whether they were in managed care, and\nhow well they rated the overall level of care from their regular\nphysician. All these independent variables were run against all\noutcome variables. For patients who brought information on\nthe Internet to their physician, we derived an overall commu-\nnication skill score by summing across 6 component ratings\n(on a 5-point scale: excellent, very good, good, fair, poor),\nincluding the amount of time spent discussing information,\nthe physician's listening skills, how well they answered ques-\ntions, their openness to the information, how seriously they\nconsidered the information, and the final decision or recom-\nmendation. A score of 18, corresponding to value at which the\naverage value of the component parts was 3 (good) was used\nto dichotomize the scores into \"high\" (18) or \"low.\"\nRespondents were defined as being proactive about health\ncare information if they stated they went out of their way to\nlook for information on health topics of personal relevance,\nrather than simply reading it if they came across it, or not\nreading any such information.\nANALYSIS\nWeighting\nTo maximize the generalizability of the results, data were\nweighted to adjust for unequal probability of selection (includ-\ning the oversample of individuals in poor health). To adjust\nfor survey nonresponse, stratification weights were developed\nusing the March 2000 Current Population Survey from the US\nCensus Bureau as standard. The poststratification weights were\nbased on gender within age within race, as well as education,\nhealth insurance status (insured vs uninsured), and house-\nhold size. This weighting procedure results in a sample that is\nrepresentative of the US population.\nAnalytic Procedures\nUnivariate relationships between independent variables and the\ndependent variables (looking for health information on the In-\nternet, effect on physician-patient relationship, and any result-\nant change in health care) were calculated using the 2 statis-\ntic or Fisher exact test. Variables with significant univariate\nrelationships (P.05) were entered into logistic regression. As\nwe had no a priori hypotheses, all variables with a significant\nunivariate relationship were entered into the logistic regres-\nsion, and an iterative process of forward and backward step-\nwise regression was undertaken to determine which variables\nprovided the best fit for the model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow\ngoodness-of-fit test was applied, and all results of multivariate\nanalyses reported come from final models with adequate fit, de-\nfined as P.2. As all data were weighted, the appropriate pro-\ncedures to correct P values and SEs were undertaken. We used\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association.

This represents a completion rate of 72% for\nthe main sample and 95% for the oversample and an adjusted\noverall response rate of 54%.\nResponse rates were maximized by making at least 15 at-\ntempts to contact each number. Where it was possible to cor-\nrelate numbers with addresses, up to 2 letters were sent, ex-\nplaining the purpose of the interview and encouraging response.\nA small incentive ($10-$50) was offered for completing the in-\nterview and was accepted by 75% of respondents.\nRESULTS\nBoth unweighted and weighted data for demographic and\nother characteristics of the 3209 respondents (includ-\ning health status, insurance status, and satisfaction with\ncare) are presented in Table 1.

For each of\nthese questions, fewer than 1% said that the informa-\ntion had been harmful; the remainder believed it had a\nneutral effect.\nOf the 513 people who had found information relevant\nhad taken the information to their physician. The main\nreasons for not taking information to the physician were\nthat it was not important enough (42%) or that they had\njust wanted to be informed (11%). Relatively few people\nhad scheduled a visit to their physician specifically (4%;\ndiscuss information they had found on the Internet.\nRather, they had needed to see the physician anyway\nand used the opportunity to mention information found\non the Internet.\nThe main factors associated with taking informa-\ntion to the physician were respondents' self-rated ability\nto critically appraise health information on the Internet\nand their health status. Respondents who rated them-\nselves as excellent or very good at assessing the reliabil-\nity of information on the Internet were more likely to take\ninformation than respondents who rated themselves as\nhealth were more likely to talk to their physician about\ninformation than those in good health (62% vs 47%;\nP=.007), as were patients whose physicians encouraged\nthem to look for information compared with those whose\nphysician did not encourage them to do so (58% vs 42%;\nP=.05). No demographic or health care factors (includ-\ning being in managed care) were associated, nor was the\nfrequency with which respondents used the Internet for\nhealth information, their concern about the reliability of\nInternet information, or whether they found it easy or\ndifficult to find good information on the Internet.\nOf the 256 people who took information to the phy-\ncause they just wanted the physician's opinion about the\ninformation, rather than wanting the physician to do\nsomething specific such as order a test, change medica-\ntion, or arrange a referral.

If the pa-\ntient felt more in control during the consultation, the re-\nlationship was likely to be improved. However, the re-\nlationship was likely to be damaged if the physician was\nperceived by the patient as \"acting challenged,\" if the pa-\ntient rated the communication skills of the physician as\ninadequate, or if the patient felt hurried during the con-\nsultation.\nSeveral variables did not affect the physician-\npatient relationship. Feelings of embarrassment or in-\ncreased confidence had no impact. Twenty-six percent\nof the people who asked their physician for a test, change\nin medication, or referral did not get any of these inter-\nventions. This did not appear to have an impact on the\nphysician-patient relationship, as these people were no\nmore likely than people who got what they requested to\nconsider that the relationship had deteriorated or im-\nproved after the visit. Demographic and health care fac-\ntors were not associated with a positive or negative im-\npact on the physician-patient relationship.\nAs a result of dissatisfaction with the consultation,\n12% of the 256 respondents who brought information\nto their physician sought a second opinion from an-\nother physician, 4% changed their physician, and 1%\n23%) carried out at least one of these actions. Such se-\nrious dissatisfaction was strongly related to the physi-\ncian's communication skills and perceived reaction to the\ninformation (Table 4). In particular, if the physician was\nperceived as being threatened by the patient bringing in-\nformation in, 49% of patients evinced serious dissatis-\nfaction as defined above, compared with 11% of pa-\ntients whose physician was not perceived as acting\nchallenged. Other important predictors of seeking a sec-\nond opinion or changing health care provider or plan were\nfeeling hurried during the consultation, or rating the phy-\nsician's communication skills as only fair or poor. Demo-\ngraphic and health care factors were not associated.\nCOMMENT\nThis is the first large population-based survey to go be-\nyond patients' use of the Internet for health information\nand examine the use patients make of the information\nonce they have found it. These data have substantial im-\nplications regarding public access to the Internet; pa-\ntients' ability to find, appraise, and use health informa-\ntion; and the resulting impact on health service utilization\nand on the physician-patient relationship.\nWe found lower rates of using the Internet to obtain health\ninformation in this general population sample than have\nbeen previously reported in surveys of people with In-\nternet access. Lack of access to the Internet may be a bar-\nrier to wider use of online sources of health informa-\ntion.12 Although we found a strong digital divide in terms\nof access to health information on the Internet, once ac-\ncess has been achieved, socioeconomic status and edu-\ncation do not predict whether patients find relevant in-\nformation or bring it to physicians. Hence, if access to\nthe Internet can be made more equitable, disadvantaged\npopulations may be able to reap the benefits of health\ninformation on the Internet. Other studies have found\nthat providing Internet access can reduce disparities in\nOne quarter of respondents who looked for health in-\nformation on the Internet were unable to find relevant\ninformation. Because this was not related to educational\nstatus, it is unlikely to be due to problems with spelling\nor literacy levels. Thus additional strategies are needed\nto help people locate pertinent information once they are\nonline.\nTable 3.

All rights reserved.\nWe found widespread concern about the reliability of\ninformation on the Internet, and only one third of\nrespondents were comfortable with their ability to\nappraise information. Current proposals to help patients\nassess online information include \"kitemarking\" (seals\nof approval) of health sites and development of trusted\nWeb sites.14 The large number and rapid growth of Web\nsites makes kitemarking infeasible,15 while promoting\nthe use of trusted Web sites is unlikely to be successful\ngiven that 50% of our sample did not know the site on\nwhich they found information. Other reports suggest\nthat people do not visit specific Web sites for health\ninformation, but instead use search engines and visit the\nfirst sites listed.16 Thus, new strategies are needed to\nhelp patients better appraise the quality of medical infor-\nmation they find online.\nOur data do not support concerns that health informa-\ntion on the Internet currently results in many requests\nfor inappropriate care. Moreover, most patients appar-\nently accepted physician judgments that requested in-\nterventions were not appropriate. Being in managed care\nhad no discernible impact on requesting interventions.\nHowever, these data suggest that health information on\nthe Internet may have a significant impact on physician\ntime. Although we have no objective measure of time spent\nduring a consultation, our data show that patients who\nfelt hurried during a consultation were also more likely\nto report serious dissatisfaction and a worsened physician-\npatient relationship. Even though only 8% of the sample\ntook information to the physician, as Internet use be-\ncomes more prevalent and people become more confi-\ndent about their ability to appraise information, more\npeople are likely to take information to their physician\nand request specific interventions.\nOur data suggest that patients believe health informa-\ntion on the Internet has more positive than negative ef-\nfects on the physician-patient relationship. Patients were\nmore likely to report a worsened physician-patient rela-\ntionship if the physician was perceived to have poor com-\nmunication skills or acted as if their authority had been\nchallenged, but not when they did not receive requested\ninterventions. Being in managed care or in disadvan-\ntaged groups was not associated with a worsened phy-\nsician-patient relationship after bringing in information\nfrom the Internet. These findings are consistent with pa-\ntients trusting physicians to interpret information they\nhad obtained independently. Some physicians appear to\nhave difficulty with this role, either lacking the neces-\nsary communication skills to discuss health informa-\ntion from the Internet adequately, or acting as if their pro-\nfessional authority is being challenged. Results from our\nsurvey of physicians show that visits where the physi-\ncian felt challenged were also associated with worsened\nquality of care and health outcomes (unpublished data).\nThere is an urgent need to elucidate the cause of this feel-\ning in order to implement preventive policies. Health care\norganizations, medical educators, and professional so-\ncieties need to consider how to ensure that their physi-\ncians acquire the skills needed to interpret information\nbrought in by patients, discuss the implications, and ne-\ngotiate a mutually acceptable management plan in a cost-\neffective manner.\nThe major strength of this study lies in its population-\nbased sampling and inclusion of an oversample of indi-\nviduals in poor health who were more likely to look for\nhealth information on the Internet. Although the re-\nsponse rate is only moderate, the weighting corrects for\nunequal probabilities of selection and nonresponse at the\nsurvey level, maximizing the generalizability of the find-\nings to the entire American population. Approximately\n95% of all households in the United States have tele-\nphones, and absence of a telephone does not affect health\nparameters.17 As the preamble to the interview did not\nspecify that the topic of interest was the Internet, it is un-\nlikely that there was systematic bias in the sample due\nto differential consent rates among individuals with strong\nviews about the Internet. Other recent population-\nbased telephone surveys have achieved similar response\nTable 4.

The relatively small number of\nrespondents who had sequentially looked for informa-\ntion, found information relevant to their own health,\nand taken it to the physician for discussion limits the\npower of the study at this point. However, we were able\nto determine large effect sizes likely to be clinically\nimportant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Internet has the potential to transform access to health\ninformation, thus enhancing patient satisfaction and par-\nticipation in health care. However, some problems must\nbe addressed before its true potential as a force for eq-\nuity and patient well-being can be realized. First, Inter-\nnet access must be improved for disadvantaged groups.\nSecond, the public needs to improve their information\nsearch and appraisal skills. This might be achieved through\na combination of government and private actions, in-\ncluding tutorials in these skills. Finally, physicians and\ntrainees need to develop their communication skills to\ninclude discussions about information from the Inter-\nnet brought by patients.\nThis study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation, Princeton, NJ.
