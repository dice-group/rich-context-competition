Exclusions were pregnancy, taking insulin or dia-\nbetic pills, and incomplete measurements.\nMain Outcome Measures: Fasting plasma glucose level,\ntriglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nlevel, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood\npressures.\nResults: Increases in fasting plasma glucose and high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels and decreases in dia-\nstolic blood pressure were observed. Rates of adoles-\ncents exceeding cutoff points for fasting plasma glucose\nlevels have increased. Compared with girls, adolescent\nboys had higher rates exceeding cutoff points for fasting\nplasma glucose and high-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol levels. Adolescent girls had higher rates exceeding\ncutoff points for waist circumference. The prevalence of\nMetS among adolescents has not changed. No sex dif-\nferences in MetS prevalence were observed.\nConclusions: Some criteria for MetS have remained stable\n(triglyceride level and systolic blood pressure) and one\nhas improved for boys (high-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol level), but waist circumference has increased in girls\nand the rate of an elevated fasting plasma glucose level\nhas nearly doubled for both boys and girls.

Our sample (n=3176) was drawn from par-\nticipants in the survey who were aged 12 to 19 years, were not\ntaking insulin or diabetic pills, were not pregnant, completed\nphysical examinations, and fasted for at least 8 hours prior to\nblood testing. Waist circumference, BP, and serum levels for\nfasting plasma glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-C), and triglycerides were recorded for all of the partici-\npants in this sample. Parents or guardians provided consent,\nand research participants younger than 18 years provided as-\nsent. Human subject approval was obtained by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.\nFasting blood samples were obtained by venipuncture at mo-\nbile examination centers and transported in recommended meth-\nods to laboratories for analysis. Triglycerides and HDL-C were\nprocessed enzymatically in a series of coupled reactions by the\nJohns Hopkins University Lipid Analytic Laboratory. Levels of\nHDL-C showed an average increase of 3.0 mg/dL (to convert\nto millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) in the last 2 survey\nperiods compared with the first 2 survey periods. It is most likely\nthat a change in methods was responsible for the increase in\nHDL-C values.27 Accordingly, in this study each research par-\ndL. The fasting plasma glucose level was determined by the Col-\nlaborative Studies Clinical Laboratory using the Roche/\nHitachi 911 instrument (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,\nGermany). (See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm for fur-\nther details about the measurement and laboratory proce-\ndures.) For this study, dichotomous variables were derived for\nhealthy and unhealthy values for each cut point including tri-\nglyceride (110 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, mul-\nmg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]),\nand HDL-C (40 mg/dL and 35 mg/dL) levels.\nWaist circumference was measured at the midpoint be-\ntween the bottom of the rib cage and above the top of the iliac\ncrest during minimal respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm. Waist\ncircumference greater than or equal to the 90th percentile for\nage and sex provided the cutoff for the dichotomous variable\nof abdominal obesity.28\nMeasurements of BP were completed during the physical\nexamination following a standardized protocol, including mea-\nsurement on the right arm with a cuff bladder two-thirds of the\narm circumference and 1 inch above the antecubital fossa. Up\nto 4 BP measurements were collected and the mean of all but\nthe first reading was calculated. A systolic or diastolic BP mean\ngreater than or equal to the 90th percentile based on age, sex,\nand stature using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-\ntute guidelines29 provided the cutoff for the dichotomous vari-\nable of hypertension. Metabolic syndrome was defined as par-\nticipants having 3 or more of 5 criteria (elevated triglyceride\nlevels, low HDL-C levels, elevated fasting plasma glucose lev-\nels, elevated abdominal obesity, and hypertension).\nSampling weights based on fasting participants were used to\ncomplete a complex sampling analysis. Estimated mean per-\ncentages and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as well as na-\ntional estimates of the prevalence of MetS and each compo-\nnent of the syndrome were calculated. Temporal and sex\ndifferences in MetS and each component were compared using\ncomplex sampling t tests and 2 test for proportions.

Adolescent girls\nhad higher rates exceeding cutoff points for waist cir-\ncumference. The prevalence of MetS among adolescents\ndefinition used. Finally, although boys have had histori-\ncally higher prevalence rates of MetS compared with girls,\nSpecifically, girls are showing an alarming increase in\nwaistcircumference.Waistcircumference,ameasureofab-\ndominal adiposity, has been associated with incidence of\ncardiovascular disease in adults. In children and adoles-\ncents, waist circumference has been identified as a predic-\ntor of insulin resistance.30 In conjunction with body mass\nindex, waist circumference predicts coronary artery dis-\nease risk factors.31 Children with increased waist circum-\nference at age 8 years were 4 times as likely to have car-\ndiovascular risk factor clustering during adolescence than\nthose with smaller waist circumference.32 The increase in\nprevalence of elevated waist circumference (90th per-\nmeasure body mass index and waist circumference and\nshould evaluate results using standardized growth grids.33\nElevations of central adiposity measures are reason to per-\nform comprehensive screening for other health risks and\nto apply appropriate interventions for lifestyle behaviors\nsuch as diet and activity.\nRates of elevated fasting plasma glucose levels nearly\nusing 100 mg/dL as the cutoff value. The difference in\nthe prevalence of elevated fasting plasma glucose levels\nusing 2 different cutoffs is intriguing. Fasting plasma glu-\ncose level, as any other criterion, can be viewed as a con-\ntinuous variable rather than as a dichotomous variable.\nIt has been noted that we are lacking large prospective\nstudies that can determine the best cutoff for fasting\nplasma glucose levels.23 At the very least, it seems logi-\nmg/dL) for adolescents because the lower level is pres-\nently recommended for adults. When doing so, the re-\nsults are startling. The prevalence of elevated fasting\nplasma glucose levels increased from 0.7% to 8.9% in\nalso striking that when using 100 mg/dL for the cutoff,\nboys showed an increase in the prevalence of elevated\nelevated fasting plasma glucose levels is not clear but sug-\ngests that adolescents are at higher risk for development\nof insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.\nThe improvement in HDL-C levels in boys is encour-\naging. Even after adjustments accounting for increases\nin HDL-C levels among NHANES samples in 2003-\n2006, rates of adolescent boys exceeding the cutoff have\nimproved. The increasing levels of HDL-C have helped\nto stabilize MetS rates and offset the increasing fasting\nplasma glucose levels. Similar to fasting plasma glucose\nlevels, the more stringent HDL-C level of 40 mg/dL (rather\nthan 35 mg/dL) is helpful to the clinician. For example,\nhad HDL-C levels of 35 mg/dL or lower, whereas 27.8%\nof boys and 18.7% of girls had levels of 40 mg/dL or lower.\nSex differences do exist in the rates of individual MetS\ncomponents. In all of the 4 survey periods, higher rates\nof elevated fasting plasma glucose levels were observed\nin boys compared with girls. In the most recent survey\nobserved for girls compared with boys.\nWhen examining the criteria collectively, the preva-\nlence of MetS in adolescence was unchanged from the\nless of the individual criteria used to define MetS. His-\ntorical sex differences were found in the rates of MetS,\nwith boys having significantly higher rates of MetS com-\npared with girls in 3 survey periods, whereas there were\nwithin prevalence rates for MetS previously re-\nported.14,15 Different inclusion and exclusion criteria in\nthe analyses by Cook et al,7 Duncan et al,8 and de Fer-\nranti et al9 explain their differences in subject numbers\nand specific results. In some studies, adolescents who were\nmissing MetS criteria measurements were included; in\nother cases, no exclusion was made for pregnancy or glu-\ncose-altering medication use; in 1 case, a 6-hour fast rather\nthan an 8-hour fast enabled subject inclusion; and fi-\nnally, in some studies a mean of all BP measurements taken\nrather than the mean of all but the first (as recom-\nmended by NHANES) was calculated.\nLimitations of this study include those of the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention sample itself, such as\nsampling and laboratory errors. For example, sample\nweighting for calculation of population totals are based on\nUS Census Bureau data. On the other hand, the stratified\nprobability sample of the NHANES data enables research-\ners to extrapolate the data to the entire population of US\nadolescents. Levels of HDL-C were higher in the last 2 sur-\nvey periods compared with the first 2 survey periods. It is\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

Further investigations are necessary to attempt to ex-\nplain the increased HDL-C levels and provide further guid-\nanceontheinterpretationofHDL-ClevelsfortheNHANES\nvide a snapshot in time but do not aid in tracking specific\nindividuals for MetS over an extended period. An addi-\ntional limitation is that subjects themselves provided the\ninformation regarding medication use that led to study ex-\nclusion.AuniversallimitationoftheworkonMetSforado-\nlescents is that the definitions, criteria, and cutoffs are not\nagreed on by consensus. However, this work contributes\nto the understanding of individual criteria and cutoffs, the\nelucidation of sex differences in specific criteria, and the\nreporting of MetS prevalence over time.\nCriteria for MetS individually and collectively can be\nused to examine historical epidemiological trends and to\nevaluate individual adolescents as part of a comprehen-\nsive health care approach.\nCorrespondence: Kenn B.
