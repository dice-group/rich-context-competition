We found no statistically\nsignificant effects on vasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral Doppler (relative risk [RR], 0.91;\nthese consolidated results were stable at different doses, different times to start of treatment, and\ndifferent courses of treatment in all included RCTs. Sensitivity analysis showed that the STASH\ntrial, which had a large population, did not influence the consolidated results of all three outcomes.\nConclusions: Simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or\nall-cause mortality after aneurysmal SAH. We conclude that patients with SAH should not be\ntreated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stage.\n",

To date, five rando-\nmized controlled trials (RCTs)6\u00ad10 have\nbeen performed to detect the benefit of\nsimvastatin over placebo based on the use\nof nimodipine. Unfortunately, the results of\nthese clinical trials were inconsistent. Two\nphase II RCTs have shown a potential\nbenefit of simvastatin therapy with respect\nto lower rates of radiologic vasospasm, DCI,\nand even mortality.6,7 However, two other\nphase II RCTs revealed opposite results:\nsimvastatin showed no significant effects on\nthe rates of vasospasm, DCI, and mortal-\nity.8,9 All of these studies were single-center,\nphase II studies with small samples of fewer\nthan 100 patients. Therefore, it is difficult\nto draw a credible conclusion. Lancet\nNeurology recently published a large multi-\ncenter phase III RCT (Simvastatin in\nAneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\n[STASH] trial) investigating the benefit of\nsimvastatin in patients with aneurysmal\nSAH.10 The results showed that simvastatin\ntreatment (40 mg/day, on 96 h of the ictus\nfor up to 21 days) had no beneficial effect on\nthe modified Rankin scale score or DCI of\npatients with SAH at discharge or 6 months\nlater, which was questioned for using low-\ndose simvastatin at 40 mg/day. Another\nRCT verified the hypothesis that high-dose\nsimvastatin might improve the clinical out-\ncomes after aneurysmal SAH.11 We per-\nformed a meta-analysis to determine\nwhether simvastatin plays a beneficial role\nin reducing delayed vasospasm, DCI, and\nmortality after aneurysmal SAH.\nMethods\nStudy protocol\nThe present study protocol was drafted\nfollowing the Cochrane Collaboration\nformat prior to study initiation. This proto-\ncol contained the patients' background\ninformation, a flow diagram, the search\nstrategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria,\noutcome definitions, the statistical design,\nthe methods of determining the risk of bias,\nand the discussion. We also conducted a\nclear division of labor and reached a con-\nsensus about the solution of controversy\nduring performing this meta-analysis. The\nmeta-analysis was performed in accordance\nwith the Preferred Reporting Items for\nSystematic Reviews and Meta-analysis\n(PRISMA) statement.12 Ethical approval\nwas not required because the meta-analysis\nwas conducted using published data.\nInformation sources and search\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane\nLibrary were searched by two independent\nauthors (J.H.L. and H.X.L.). The main\nsearch strategy involved the combination of\nthe variables ``simvastatin'' AND ``subarach-\nnoid hemorrhage.'' Searches were restricted\nto the English language and matched the\ntitles and abstracts of studies. To insure that\nall relevant studies were included in this\nsystematic review, the reference lists of the\nRCTs and systematic reviews were manually\nscreened in addition to performing the elec-\ntronic database search. Appendix 1 provides\nthe full details of the search strategy.\nEligibility criteria, study selection, and data\ncollection\nDouble-blind RCTs were included if they met\nthe following criteria: i) patients had aneur-\nysmal SAH diagnosed by computed tomog-\nraphy angiography or digital subtraction\nangiography, ii) simvastatin was regularly\nadministered during the initial 2 to 3 weeks\nfollowing SAH, and iii) outcomes of interest\nwere compared between the simvastatin and\nplacebo groups. Studies assessing outcomes\nbased on simvastatin use prior to aneurysm\nrupture were excluded. Outcomes of interest\nbased on intention-to-treat datasets included\nvasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral\nDoppler (TCD), the incidence of DCI, and\nall-cause mortality. DCI was assessed by\nclinical scales or cerebral angiography.\nThe following data were extracted: study\ncharacteristics (such as lead author, publi-\ncation year, and study setting), participant\ncharacteristics (such as diagnostic criteria,\nsex, age, and type of operation), intervention\ndetails (such as dose ranges, time to treat-\nment from SAH, and follow-up time), and\noutcome measures.\nRisk of bias and quality assessment\nBiases in the included trials were assessed\nby two independent investigators (J.L. and\nH.L.) using a seven-point quality control\nscale recommended by the Cochrane\nHandbook.13 The items included selection\nbias, performance bias, detection bias, attri-\ntion bias, reporting bias, and other potential\nbiases. Each item was categorized as high,\nlow, or unclear risk. The GRADE approach,\nwhich contains five items (risk of bias,\ninconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and\npublication bias), was used to assess the\nquality of the evidence.\nData analysis\nData were processed using Review Manager\n5.2 from the Cochrane Collaboration.\nDichotomous outcomes were analyzed as\nthe risk ratio (relative risk [RR] and 95%\nconfidence interval [CI]) using the Mantel\u00ad\nHaenszel technique and a random-effects\nmodel. Statistical heterogeneity was estimated\nby the I2 statistic. Tests were two-tailed, and\nP < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-\ncant in all analyses. All analyses were per-\nformed on an intention-to-treat basis.\nResults\nAccording to the initially established search\nstrategy, 738 records were retrieved from\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane\nLibrary. After removing duplicates, irrele-\nvant records, and non-RCTs, 17 full-text\narticles were assessed for eligibility. Among\nthem, 12 records were excluded for the\nfollowing reasons: secondary analysis of\npreviously published RCTs, meta-analysis\nreview, and RCT without a placebo-control\npatients were included in the qualitative\nanalysis (Figure 1).

The\nquality of the evidence was moderate.\nSensitivity analysis\nA sensitivity analysis was necessary to detect\nthe stability of the consolidated results\namong the included studies because of their\nvarious definitions of outcomes and different\nsample sizes. The sensitivity analysis showed\nthat the STASH trial, which had a large\npopulation, did not influence the consoli-\ndated results of all three outcomes (Table 2).\nThe quality of this evidence was moderate.\nRisk of bias in included studies\nThe risk of bias with respect to allocation\nconcealment was unclear in two studies.6,7\nThe risk of bias with respect to blinding of\nthe outcome assessment was unclear in four\nstudies.6\u00ad9 The risk of bias with respect to\nselective reporting was high in one study.6\nNo other items showed a high risk of bias\n(Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nSimvastatin, as the most potentially effective\nstatin in the treatment of SAH, has been\ninvestigated for several years.14 However,\nthe efficacy of simvastatin in clinical practice\nremains controversial because of the lack of\nlarge multicenter prospective clinical trials.\nThe recent STASH trail, which was expected\nto provide strong evidence for simvastatin in\nthe treatment of SAH, revealed discoura-\nging results in the Lancet Neurology.10 These\nresults exacerbated the debate. The present\nmeta-analysis has shown that simvastatin\ndoes not have significant effects on vaso-\nspasm detected by TCD, DCI, or all-cause\nmortality. Further subgroup analysis\nshowed that these consolidated results were\nTable 2.

These results indicate that sim-\nvastatin has no benefit in decreasing the\nincidence of vasospasm, DCI, and all-cause\nmortality after aneurysmal SAH.\nCerebral vasospasm is responsible for the\npoor prognosis of aneurysmal SAH.15\nApproximately 50% of patients with large\narterial vasospasm eventually develop DCI,\nwhich is associated with a high mortality\nrate.16,17 Thus, the low incidence of cerebral\nvasospasm and DCI is considered to predict\ngood functional recovery. In the present\nstudy, simvastatin had no significant effect\non either vasospasm detected by TCD or\nDCI. Our findings are consistent with those\nof previous studies. To date, five retrospect-\nive studies,18\u00ad22 one prospective cohort\nFigure 3. Summary of risk of bias in each study.\nthe efficacy of simvastatin on the incidence\nof vasospasm or DCI. Only one retrospect-\nive study18 and one RCT6 reported a\ndecrease in vasospasm by simvastatin, but\nthe study results were questionable due to\nseveral limitations. For example, Lynch\net al.6 reported a high rate of vasospasm in\ntheir placebo group (60%), while the inci-\ndence of vasospasm in the simvastatin group\nwas 26%, which is comparable with the\nincidence without treatment in a previous\nstudy.24 This unrepresentative placebo\ngroup made the statistical analysis meaning-\nless. Mortality is regarded as the most serious\noutcome of aneurysmal SAH, and it is usu-\nally analyzed to determine the acceptability\nand safety of treatment. Notably, however,\nthe present study evaluated all-cause mortal-\nity, which cannot reflect the acceptability of\nsimvastatin for SAH. Further studies are\nneeded to classify the cause of mortality.\nSeveral confounding factors may lead to\nheterogeneity, such as vasospasm measure-\nment technique, DCI diagnosis, and thera-\npeutic regimen; however, these factors are\nunlikely to have influenced our results. TCD\nwas regarded as the most common technique\nwith which to detect vasospasm by measure-\nment of the middle cerebral artery velocity.\nFour of the five studies in this meta-analysis\nused three definitions of vasospasm: any peak\nsystolic middle cerebral artery velocity of\nsubgroup analysis showed that the consoli-\ndated results were stable (data not shown).\nThe difficulty in diagnosing DCI is another\nconfounding factor. Although emerging data\nshowed that perfusion magnetic resonance\nimaging has high accuracy for identification\nof DCI,25 its high costs have restricted its\nwide application. The five RCTs in this meta-\nanalysis employed several neurological exam-\ninations to detect the incidence of DCI with a\nsimilar relevance ratio. We performed sub-\ngroup analyses according to the drug dose,\ntime to the start of treatment, and course of\ntreatment to detect the influence of the\nvarious therapeutic regimens. The STASH\ntrial was questionable because of its half-dose\nof simvastatin (40 mg/day) compared with\nthe other four RCTs (80 mg/day), and this\ndifference was regarded to influence the\nefficacy of simvastatin. The present subgroup\nanalysis showed no efficacy of simvastatin at\nvasospasm, DCI, or all-cause mortality.\nMoreover, a recent trial also showed no\nsuperiority of high-dose (80 mg/day) com-\npared with lower-dose (40 mg/day) simvasta-\ntin treatment for patients with aneurysmal\nSAH.11 The different times to the start of\ntreatment and various durations of simvas-\ntatin are also unlikely to influence the con-\nsolidated results. Cerebral vasospasm most\nfrequently occurred 7 to 10 days after aneur-\nysm rupture and resolved spontaneously\nafter 21 days.3 Although three RCTs only\nsufficient time to prevent the incidence of\ncerebral vasospasm. Similarly, the time to the\nstart of treatment in the included RCTs\nto the onset of cerebral vasospasm. The\nresults of the subgroup analysis also indicate\nthat the time to the start of treatment and\nduration of simvastatin had no influence on\nthe stability of the consolidated results.\nThere were several limitations in our\nanalysis. First, the present systematic\nreview included only 4 small RCTs involving\n148 patients and the STASH trial involving\n803 patients. The small sample is an import-\nant limitation in the present meta-analysis,\nalthough the sensitivity analysis showed that\nthe STASH trial with its large population\ndid not influence the consolidated results of\nall three outcomes. Second, the treatment\nmode for ruptured aneurysms may have\nplayed an important role in the final out-\ncomes. Surgical treatments might cause the\nsubarachnoid blood clots to fill both lateral\nventricles, leading to worse outcomes after\nSAH.27 Finally, the severity of the patients'\nconditions at the time of recruitment was\ninconsistent among the RCTs. Thus, the\nefficacy of simvastatin in patients with severe\nSAH might have been neglected.\nConclusion\nSimvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing\nthe incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or all-cause\nmortality after aneurysmal SAH. Routine\nprescription of simvastatin for aneurysmal\nSAH might not be beneficial. Further studies\nare needed to explore the mechanism of\nsimvastatin's neuroprotective effect. A multi-\ncenter prospective study of simvastatin for\npatients with SAH involving a large sample\nsize and long-term follow-up is still needed.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by Science and\nTechnology Foundation Projects of Fenghua\nScience and Technology Bureau, Ningbo,\nReferences\n1.
