Furthermore, those who\ncease driving are at increased risk for long-term care insti-\ntutionalization and mortality (4,5). As the percentage of\nolder adults comprising our population increases, health\ncare workers will increasingly be faced with advising older\npatients about driving. Finding ways of maintaining safe\ndriving mobility will be of ever more concern.\nResearch on risk factors for driving cessation has indi-\ncated that older adults who have ceased driving report\npoorer health and physical abilities (6,7). Ragland and col-\nleagues (8) found that older adults report concerns about\nbeing in an accident and vision problems as reasons for self-\nregulating their driving. Poor vision is a prospective risk\nfactor for driving cessation (8,9).\nRecent evidence also highlights the importance of cognitive\nabilities to maintained driving (10). Anstey and colleagues\n(11) found that older drivers with poor cognitive abilities,\nincluding speed of processing, had a higher probability of\ndriving cessation. Recent analyses found that slower speed of\nprocessing was a significant risk factor for driving cessation,\neven while considering baseline driving, age, health, vision,\nmemory, reasoning, and physical performance (10).\nOngoing research has indicated that speed of processing\ncan be enhanced through a computerized training regimen\n(12) and that such training may improve on-road driving\nsafety (13) and protect against declines in driving mobility\nacross 3 years (14). Given that the training has resulted in\nmaintained driving mobility, it was of interest to examine\nwhether training delays the outcome of driving cessation.\nThe current analyses were conducted to examine whether\ncompleting this speed of processing training regimen delays\ndriving cessation.\nMethods\nParticipants\nDriving cessation over a 3-year period among community-\ndwelling older drivers is a relatively low-frequency event. To\ngain statistical power and ensure an adequate sample size of\nthose who ceased driving, data from comparable populations\nfrom two studies were combined. The first study, Staying\nKeen in Later Life (SKILL), recruited relatively healthy com-\nmunity-dwelling older adults with intact vision and hearing\nwho did not have evidence of dementia or other severe cogni-\ntive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]\nscore of 23 or better). SKILL participants were primarily\nrecruited via mass-mailed letters to older adults residing in\nthe area as well as through local senior agencies and health\nclinics.

As our population ages, interventions that can prolong safe driving for older adults will be increasingly\nimportant.\nMethods. Data from two studies were combined in order to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive training in\ndelaying driving cessation. Stratified Cox hazard regressions were used to examine risk of driving cessation as a function\nof training participation, baseline driving, and visual acuity.\nResults. Older drivers with cognitive speed of processing difficulties who completed speed of processing training\nwere 40% less likely to cease driving over the subsequent 3 years (hazard ratio = 0.596, 95% confidence interval\nonly 9% of those who completed eight or more sessions of speed of processing training ceased driving.\nConclusion. Speed of processing training may delay driving cessation among older drivers with speed of processing\ndifficulty.\nKey Words: Cognitive training--Driving--Intervention.\nwho performed poorly on the UFOV (n = 124) were randomly\nassigned to either speed of processing training (n = 61) or a\ncontrol condition that involved the same amount of social\ncontact and computer contact (internet use, n = 63). One\nparticipant did not complete at least eight sessions of speed\ntraining.\nThe second study was Advanced Cognitive Training for In-\ndependent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE), which recruited par-\nticipants with the same inclusion criteria as described\npreviously for SKILL with the exception that participants\nwere not required to show UFOV difficulties, and ACTIVE\nspecifically excluded individuals with functional disabilities\nand life-threatening disease. In ACTIVE, older adults who re-\nsided in the community were recruited through senior centers,\nchurches, senior housing, senior community organizations,\nand health clinics. Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria\nare detailed elsewhere (16). Similarities and differences\nbetween the two studies are summarized in Table 1. ACTIVE\nparticipants were randomly assigned to speed of processing,\nmemory, or reasoning training or to a no-contact control group.\nTo aggregate the data sets, a post hoc subsample of ACTIVE\nparticipants from the speed of processing training and control\ngroups with baseline UFOV scores that met the SKILL inclu-\nsion criteria were selected (n = 444). Of these 444 participants,\nto speed of processing training. Seventeen of those random-\nized to training did not complete at least eight sessions.\nThe sample consisted of 568 adults ranging in age be-\n76% Caucasians. These participants had a wide range of\neducation from sixth grade to PhD, with an average of some\ncollege or vocational training.\nTo examine the impact of completing speed of processing\ntraining upon subsequent driving cessation, we compared\nthose who attended eight or more training sessions (n = 276)\nwith those who completed no training sessions. This crite-\nrion was chosen a priori in that attending at least 8 of 10\nsessions was considered completing the training in both the\nACTIVE and the SKILL studies as well as prior training\nstudies (15\u00ad18). The number of participants by study and\ncondition as well as the number of training sessions com-\npleted are presented in Table 2.\nMeasures\nMeasures common to the two studies are listed subse-\nquently and were administered with identical protocols in\nboth the SKILL and the ACTIVE studies.\nThe Mobility Driving Habits Questionnaire (19) was\nused to ascertain driving status and the number of days per\nweek driven.\nA standard letter chart was used to measure far visual\nacuity. Scores were assigned from 0 to 90 based upon how\nmany letters were correctly discriminated (90 is equivalent\nto a Snellen score of 20/16). The scores can be easily con-\nverted to Log minimum angle resolvable but for convenience\nare scaled so that higher numbers reflect better vision.\nMental status was assessed with the MMSE (20),\nwhich is commonly used to screen for dementia. Scores\ncan range from 0 to 30, with higher scores representing\nbetter cognition.\nTable 1.

Each subtest is scored as the display duration\n(16\u00ad500 ms) at which the participant could perform the task\ncorrectly 75% of the time.\nProcedure\nSpeed of processing training was led by a trainer and in-\nvolved 10 sessions in which trainees practiced computer-\nized exercises of visual attention aimed at enhancing the\nspeed and accuracy of visual performance. In both studies,\nthe training sessions were 1 hour in duration and were com-\npleted twice a week for a period of 5 weeks (15). The cogni-\ntive assessments, conducted by testers who were blind to\ntreatment condition, were repeated immediately posttrain-\ning, and the driving questionnaire was repeated 3 years after\ntraining.\nAnalyses\nThe two study populations did not significantly differ at\nbaseline in age, cognition, or days driven per week (ps >\n.05). However, the SKILL participants tended to have\npoorer vision overall (p < .05). Thus, vision was included\nas a covariate. Although older adults are likely to cease\ndriving due to poor vision (8,9), visual acuity would not be\nexpected to be significantly affected by training participa-\ntion. Given that driving cessation rates did not differ by sex\nor race (ps > .05), these variables were not further explored\nin analyses.\nStratified Cox regression analyses were used to assess the\nprobability that an individual would cease driving across\nthe subsequent 3 years as a function of training participation\n(completing eight or more sessions) while controlling for\nbaseline driving and vision, stratified by study. A different\nbaseline hazard is calculated for each study, and the overall\nhazard function is obtained for each covariate in the model.\nTime was right censored, calculated as the number of\nmonths between baseline and the 3-year interview, for per-\nsons who reported driving at the 3-year follow-up assess-\nment. For persons who did not remain drivers, the point at\nwhich driving ceased in terms of months after baseline was\nused to time the event.\nResults\nMultivariate analyses of variance were first conducted to\nassure that the training and control groups did not differ at\nbaseline in age, cognition, vision, or number of days driven\nper week.

Older drivers who initially\ndrove more often and those with better vision were less\nlikely to cease driving. Speed of processing training partici-\npation was protective against driving cessation (hazard ratio\np = .048). Participants who completed speed of processing\ntraining were 40% less likely to cease driving across the sub-\nsequent 3 years as compared with controls (see Table 4).\nTable 2.

No other significant group differences were found.\nDiscussion\nThere is increasing evidence that cognitive and physical\n(22) interventions can prolong driving mobility and safety\nfor older adults. In particular, cognitive speed of processing\ntraining may improve driver safety on the road (13), prolong\ndriving mobility across 3 years (14), and reduce rates of\ndriving cessation by 40% among older adults at risk for mo-\nbility decline. These results indicated that while 14% of the\ncontrol participants ceased driving, only 9% of those who\ncompleted training (eight or more training sessions) ceased\ndriving over 3 years.\nAlthough cognitive performance is emerging as a salient\npredictor of cessation (i.e., 10,23), it is important to note\nthat social and demographic factors are also related to the\ndecision to stop driving (24). Although female gender has\nbeen associated with higher risk of driving cessation in the\npast (25), it was not associated with driving cessation in this\nsample. In analyses that control for baseline driving, female\ngender has not emerged as a risk factor for cessation in\nmodern cohorts of older drivers (i.e., 10,23). Thus, the\nhigher rates of cessation found among females in the past\nmay reflect a cohort effect.\nTo have adequate power to examine driving cessation as\nan outcome with a sufficient sample size of speed of pro-\ncessing trained individuals, it was necessary to combine\ndata across two different studies. We recognize that this\nmethod of estimating the impact of training is not without\nlimitations. It is important to note that there were some\nmethodological differences between the ACTIVE and\nSKILL studies. Most notably, SKILL used a control group\nthat involved both social contact and computer contact,\nwhereas the ACTIVE study involved a no-contact condi-\ntion. However, the combination of these conditions is justi-\nfied by prior research that found no differences between this\ntype of social contact and computer contact condition and a\nno-contact control group when examining the impact of\nspeed of processing training (26). Another difference is that\nthe ACTIVE speed of processing training protocol involved\nspecified practice for the first five sessions and adaptive\ntraining for the remaining sessions, whereas SKILL used\nonly adaptive sessions (e.g., exercise difficulty is tailored to\nthe individual). One would expect that these differences\nwould not inflate the training effect size but rather would\nmake it more difficult to detect training effects in that adap-\ntive training is more effective than specified practice (15).\nAnother limitation is that the results presented are not\nintent-to-treat analyses. When examining all participants\nrandomized to speed of processing training (n = 294) as\ncompared with controls, the impact of training was mar-\n.083. Given that the noncompleting participants appear\nsimilar to completing participants on baseline measures,\nthis suggests that at least eight or more sessions of the\nTable 4.

Future research is required to confirm these re-\nsults in a single prospective study of older drivers at risk\nfor mobility problems.\nOverall, research indicates that speed of processing\ntraining may prolong safe driving mobility among older\nadults at risk for mobility loss based on cognitive speed of\nprocessing performance. Paired with prior research, these\nresults indicate that older drivers at risk for mobility prob-\nlems can be identified with measures such as the UFOV\nand Digit Symbol Substitution Tests (10) and referred to a\ncognitive training program. Cognitive speed of processing\ntraining may enhance on-road driving safety (13); protect\nagainst declines in driving exposure (number of challeng-\ning conditions encountered while driving), driving space\n(extent into environment driven), and increased driving\ndifficulty (14); and may delay driving cessation.\nFunding\nAdvanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly was\nsupported by grants from the National Institute on Aging and the\nNational Institute of Nursing Research to Hebrew Senior Life (U01\nEdward R.
