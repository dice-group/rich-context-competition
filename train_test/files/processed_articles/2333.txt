The population\nMain Outcome Measures: The known risk factors in-\ncluded having the following: mental health conditions;\na sad or depressed mood; substance abuse problems; medi-\ncal problems; recent crises; financial, job, and legal prob-\nlems; intimate partner and other relationship problems;\nand perpetrated interpersonal violence.\nResults: Nine distinct patterns of risk factors emerged.\nOf these classes, 1 only endorsed mental health\u00adrelated\nfactors and 1 only endorsed alcohol- and substance abuse\u00ad\nrelated factors; however, 7 classes of decedents had dis-\ntinct patterns of factors that spanned multiple domains.\nFor example, 5 of these classes had mental health fac-\ntors with other risks (eg, substance abuse, financial prob-\nlems, relationship problems, a recent crisis, and medi-\ncal problems). Two classes had recent crises with\nrelationship problems; one of these classes also had high\nprobabilities for criminal problems and interpersonal vio-\nlence. Class proportions differed during the 6 years. Dif-\nferences across classes by demographic and event char-\nacteristics were also found.\nConclusions: Most suicide decedents could be classi-\nfied by patterns of risk factors. Furthermore, most classes\nrevealed a need for more connected services across medi-\ncal, mental health/substance abuse, and court/social ser-\nvice systems. Reducing fragmentation across these agen-\ncies and recruiting family, friend, and community support\nfor individuals experiencing mental health problems\nand/or other stress might significantly reduce suicides.\nthe fourth-leading cause of\ndeath in the United States for\nyears of age.1 To prevent sui-\ncide, one strategy has been to identify and\nprevent the contributing circumstances (ie,\nrisk factors) common to those who take\ntheir own lives. Health-related risk fac-\ntors have included mental health (MH)\nproblems2-6;certainmedicalconditions(eg,\ncancer)7-9; prior suicide attempts2; and sub-\nstance abuse.2,10 Other life-stress\u00adrelated\nrisk factors have included intimate part-\ncial problems15; recent crisis or stress2; and\nexperiences with other forms of violence\n(eg, child abuse or peer abuse).16,17 While\nany one of these factors increases the risk\nof suicide, most suicide decedents have\nmultiple risk factors prior to death.2 There-\nfore, strategies designed to prevent sui-\ncide might be more effective if they ad-\ndress multiple risk factors.2 To provide\ndirection for such strategies, we identi-\nfied common patterns of health-related\nand life-stress\u00adrelated factors (ie, the\nmost common co-occurring factors)\nknown to increase risk of suicide among\na suicide decedent population, classified\ndecedents by these patterns, and as-\nsessed annual class proportions during a\n6-year period to determine which co-oc-\ncurring factors need more urgent atten-\ntion. We also characterized decedents\n(eg, demographic characteristics) and\nthe incidents (eg, the mechanisms and\nweapons used, location of incident) by\nthese patterns to further understand\ntheir surrounding circumstances.\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of\nViolence Prevention, Etiology\nand Surveillance Branch,\nNational Center for Injury\nPrevention and Control,\nCenters for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

In 2005, 4 states\nwere added (California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah),\nbringing the total (as of 2008) to 17 states. Data collection is\nstatewide with the exception of California, which collects data\nin only 4 counties (Los Angeles, Riverside, San Francisco, and\nSanta Clara).\nThe NVDRS collects details such as information on dece-\ndents, the mechanisms and weapons involved in the inci-\ndents, and the circumstances leading up to the violent deaths.18\nData are collected from coroner or medical examiner reports,\ntoxicology reports, law enforcement records, and death cer-\ntificates and are linked by incident into a single repository.\nStates manage data collection through state health depart-\nments or a subcontracted entity, such as a medical examiner's\noffice, where data are gathered and coded by trained abstrac-\ntors. Data may be manually extracted from reports or im-\nported electronically from other systems (eg, Bureau of Vital\nStatistics death certificate files). All data are reviewed by the\nabstractor to ensure accuracy of the codes and adherence to the\nNVDRS coding manual.20 The NVDRS has been described in\nThe data used for this analysis represent calendar years 2003\nto 2008. Case identification was conducted from an NVDRS\ndatabase that was updated through March 2010. Suicide dece-\ndents were identified by the final manner of death they were\nassigned by the data abstractors; abstractors make this deter-\nmination using information from the death certificates (ie, the\nlisted manner of death and the external cause of death codes)\nas well as from the coroner or medical examiner and law en-\nforcement reports. Based on this initial criterion, 49 265 sui-\ncide decedents were identified from 17 states. Two additional\ninclusion criteria were also required. First, because this study\nfocused on patterns of co-occurring risk factors, a case had to\nhave circumstance information documented for at least 2 health-\nrelated or life-stress\u00adrelated risk factors. This criterion yielded\ntwo-thirds of their cases meet this first criterion to be in-\ncluded. States that did not meet this criterion might have had\ndifficulties with capturing suicide circumstance information.\nIn such situations, it is likely that circumstance data were not\nmissing at random; therefore, a fair assessment of patterns for\nthese states might have been problematic. As a result of this\ncriterion, cases from 5 states (South Carolina, Georgia, Ken-\ntucky, California, and New Jersey) were excluded. The final\nVARIABLES\nThe known health-related and life-stress\u00adrelated risk factors\nused to assess the patterns included having a current de-\npressed mood; a current MH condition (ie, a documented con-\ndition); a history of MH conditions (approximated by having\na history of MH treatment); alcohol problems; other sub-\nstance abuse problems; medical problems believed to have pre-\ncipitated the suicide (eg, chronic pain or cancer); financial prob-\nlems; job problems; criminal legal problems; a recent crisis\n(within 2 weeks); a recent exposure to a death (eg, recent death\nof a friend or family member); IP or other relationship prob-\nlems; a history of perpetrating interpersonal violence; and a his-\ntory of suicide attempts. We also included information on\nwhether the decedent was suspected of using alcohol at the time\nof the incident and whether the decedent disclosed his or her\nintent to commit suicide. All of the variables were not mutu-\nally exclusive. Three known risk factors (ie, school problems,\nother legal problems, and violence victimization) were ex-\ncluded because of low prevalence estimates. (Throughout this\narticle, we use the term known risk factors because these items\nhave been identified as risk factors for suicide in previous stud-\nies; in the NVDRS, these items are often referred to as \"pre-\nceding circumstances of suicide\" because the system is cur-\nrently unable to assess relative risk.)\nAfter categorization by the pattern of known risk factors,\nwe also characterized the decedents by demographic factors\n(eg, race/ethnicity, sex, age, and marital status), military sta-\ntus (ie, whether the decedent ever served in the US military),\nand whether they accessed MH treatment prior to death. We\nalso characterized the incidents by the type of location (eg,\nhome, recreational area, or commercial area) and the type of\nmechanism and weapon used (eg, firearm, poisoning,\nhanging).\nLatent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify distinct pat-\nterns of known risk factors for suicide among the decedents\nand to classify these decedents by these patterns. The LCA\nmethod is very useful in identifying distinct classes based on\npatterns of nonmutually exclusive categorical variables21 such\nas the known risk factors.21 To determine which model best ex-\nplained the patterns of known risk factors (eg, a 3-class model\nidentifies 3 classes [or patterns], a 4-class model identifies\n4 classes, and so forth), we used the Bayesian information\ncriterion (see footnote i of the eAppendix, http://www\n.archgenpsychiatry.com). We also considered the entropy value\n(see footnote ii of the eAppendix). Based on these criteria, we\nchose a 9-class model. Details on LCA and our model selec-\ntion process are provided in the eAppendix and eTable. This\nanalysis was first conducted for suicide decedents in each NVDRS\ndata year to assess the stability of latent class structures (eg,\nwhether the characteristics of each class identified were simi-\nlar in each data year). Because the same classes (ie, distinct pat-\nterns) emerged in each data year, we then consolidated the data\nformed using Mplus version 5.1 statistical software (Muthen\nand Muthen, Los Angeles, California).\nTo show how each class had distinct patterns of known\nrisk factors, we provided the class-specific item endorsement\nprobabilities for each factor. We also assessed the proportion\nof each class by year and characterized each of the classes by\nthe descriptive variables. The Cochran-Armitage test for\ntrends was used to test for the presence of linear trends in the\nproportion of decedents in each latent class across data years\nexamined in this study. The tests determine significant\nincreases or decreases in class proportions using data from all\nyears beyond a reference year. Because the NVDRS was\ndetected by these tests might have been an artifact of the sys-\ntem capturing more cases; therefore, Cochran-Armitage tests\nwere conducted for each class using 3 starting points: 2003,\ncance was determined at the P=.05 level.\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

In contrast to the first 2 classes,\nthis class had low probabilities for all other factors.\nClass 4 decedents had a current depressed mood with\nhigh probability for being recognized as having a de-\npressed mood around the time of death; however, they\nhad a low probability for having a documented MH con-\ndition. This class also had the highest probability for hav-\ning experienced financial problems.\nClass 5 exhibited alcohol problems with other life\nabilities for alcohol-related risk factors and moderate to\nhigh probabilities for a variety of life stresses (eg, a re-\ncent crisis, job problems, IP problems). They also had a\nmoderately high probability for being identified as hav-\ning a depressed mood but a low probability for having a\ndocumented MH condition.\nClass 6 had medical problems with depressed mood\ning medical problems that were believed to have contrib-\n5,thisclassalsohadamoderatelyhighprobabilityforbeing\nidentified as having a depressed mood but a low probabil-\nity for having a documented MH condition.\nClass 7 experienced recent crises with criminal legal\nprobabilities for having a recent crisis and recent crimi-\nnal problems.

The Cochran-Armitage tests sup-\nported significant changes in the class proportions for 3\nor 2005) was used (comparisons were significant at the\nP=.05 level). The annual proportion of decedents allo-\ncated to class 2 significantly increased during the study\nperiod, while the annual proportions of decedents allo-\ncated to classes 6 and 7 steadily decreased in this time.\nMany similarities were observed across the classes. For\nexample, in each class, most decedents (73.9%) were\nof white non-Hispanic racial/ethnic status, most dece-\ndents (64.0%) were male, the most common mecha-\nnism or weapon used was a firearm (38.5%), and the\nmost common location of death was at a house or an apart-\n(those identified with a current MH condition) had simi-\nlar patterns of MH diagnoses, with depression or dys-\nthymia listed as the most common diagnosis (75.2%-\n77.8%), bipolar disorder as the second most common\nSeveral differences were also discovered. Classes 1\nthrough 3, those with documented MH conditions, had\nthe highest proportions of female decedents (25.6%-\n36.1%). These 3 classes were the only classes who had\ndecedents in MH treatment prior to death (75.9% were\nin treatment) and were the 3 classes with the highest pro-\nportion of decedents who died by poisoning (25.2%).\nClass 7 (those with recent crises and criminal legal prob-\nlems) had the highest proportion of decedents younger\nthan 20 years, whereas class 6 decedents (those with con-\ntributing medical problems) had the highest proportion\nof decedents aged 65 years or older. Class 6 also had the\nhighest proportion of decedents who were widowed, di-\nvorced, or separated from their spouse and who had served\nin the military.\nCOMMENT\nSuicide is a complex phenomenon often resulting from\nmultiple risk factors.2,22 We found that distinct patterns\namong these factors exist. Similar to previous research,\nwe found the following: the majority of decedents were\nnon-Hispanic white males1,23; the most common place of\ndeath was at a residence24; the most common mecha-\nnism or weapon used was a firearm23,25; decedents with\ncontributing medical problems were older7; those with\ncriminal legal problems were younger26,27; and many de-\ncedents who had MH conditions also had substance abuse\nproblems.28-31 Furthermore, previous research found that\nfemales are more likely than males to access MH treat-\nment32,33 and attempt suicide by poisoning or less lethal\nmeans.34-37 Therefore, as expected, we found higher pro-\nportions of females and poisoning deaths among classes\nwith higher proportions of decedents who accessed MH\ntreatment.\nAdditionally, we found that more than 10 000 dece-\ndents who had MH issues (ie, who either had a docu-\nmented condition or were known to have a sad or de-\npressed mood) were experiencing other risk factors prior\nto death and that the proportions of decedents experi-\nencing MH problems with a recent crisis (class 2) have\nbeen increasing in recent years, although more years of\ndata might be needed to substantiate this trend. Further-\nmore, at least 75% of those in classes 1 through 3--classes\nthat consisted of half the entire decedent population--\nwere in MH treatment around the time of death, which\nTable 2.

The MH treatment alone might not suf-\nficiently address both the MH condition and potential co-\noccurring life stressors, or these stressors might be dis-\nrupting the treatment process (eg, a recent crisis or\nsubstance abuse might deter compliance with treatment\nregimens). For those with only MH conditions, addi-\ntional social support might still be needed to help moni-\ntor treatment and prevent suicidal behavior.\nWe also found that many decedents had a recent cri-\nsis with IP or other relationship problems in the ab-\nsence of having known MH conditions, as indicated by\nTable 3.

Most of these decedents (93.9%) were classified in the first 3 classes; therefore,\ndiagnoses were provided for only these classes. There were 2457 decedents in class 1, 4070 decedents in class 2, and 7073 decedents in class 3 who had current\nMH conditions. Diagnoses could have been listed as either the primary diagnosis or the secondary diagnosis.

These findings suggest that there might\nbe a need for services that help build strong coping skills\nto better handle relationship issues during times of cri-\nses, especially because a high proportion of the class 7\ndecedents perpetrated interpersonal violence prior to\ndeath. Furthermore, a high proportion of class 7 dece-\ndents had criminal legal problems, indicating that the\ncourt/legal system might be in a position to act as a gate-\nway for multicomponent suicide and violence preven-\ntion strategies. Such strategies can incorporate indi-\nvidual counseling with family therapy, counseling on\nbuilding positive relationships and coping skills, and as-\nsistance with accessing additional resources that can help\nreduce stress on relationships (eg, employment assis-\nSimilar to Flensborg-Madsen et al,39 we also found that\nalcohol-related problems can be common among sui-\ncide decedents in the absence of psychiatric comorbid-\nity, as indicated by classes 5 and 9. Alcohol-related prob-\nlems were the most transparent characteristics for these\ndecedents. Both of these classes had moderate probabili-\nties for being identified as having a sad or depressed mood,\nwhich could mean they had MH problems that were not\nyet diagnosed. The class 5 decedents had moderately high\nprobabilities for having a recent crisis and other life stress-\nors, suggesting that these decedents might have been using\nalcohol as a coping device, which warrants efforts to re-\nduce this maladaptive coping behavior in favor of more\nsocially adaptive ways of dealing with stress.\nThe link between medical illness and depression with\nsuicide in older adults is well documented.40-42 This study\nfound that class 6 decedents (those with contributing\nmedical problems) mostly comprised older adults. Nearly\nhalf of them were identified as having a depressed mood,\nwhich indicates a need for increasing social support and\nMH screening and treatment once diagnosed as having\na severe or terminal medical condition. Class 6 deaths\nwere also characterized by the highest proportion of wid-\nowed, divorced, or separated decedents and more than\ndouble the number of decedents with prior military ser-\nvice than any other class, both of which may indicate the\nneed for additional support systems.\nIn light of these findings, many limitations of this study\nshould be considered. First, the NVDRS data were not\nnationally representative. As the NVDRS expands to in-\nclude all 50 states, the class structure, the class propor-\ntions, or both might change over time. Second, changes\nin class proportions over time might be a reflection of\nchanges in the population demographic characteristics,\nwhich signifies that scientists must continue to observe\npatterns of risk factors if they hope to help prevent sui-\ncide. Third, the reported information on MH and medi-\ncal health problems and substance abuse was obtained\nfrom coroners and medical examiners, family members,\nand friends of the victims. As such, it may be incom-\nplete based on the knowledge level of the informant. Fur-\nthermore, many of these decedents might have been liv-\ning with MH conditions but never received a diagnosis.\nBecause of the potential underdiagnosis of MH condi-\ntions, the proportion of decedents placed in classes 4\nthrough 9 might have been overestimated and the pro-\nportion estimates for classes 1 through 3 might have been\nunderestimated. Fourth, 5 states had to be excluded be-\ncause of lack of circumstance information. The ex-\ncluded population did not largely differ from the study\npopulation by demographic characteristics such as race/\nethnicity, sex, and age (significant differences were de-\ntected because large populations were compared, but the\ndifferences were slight); therefore, potential biases asso-\nciated with population demographic characteristics were\nmost likely minimal. However, our findings should still\nbe generalized only to the population of the 12 NVDRS\nstates included in the study. The fact that 5 states were\nexcluded because of the lack of suicide circumstance in-\nformation signifies the need for thorough reporting on\nsuicide deaths by medicolegal death investigators to ap-\npropriately monitor suicide trends. Lastly, LCA can of-\nten lead to subjective interpretation of class patterns; how-\never, the victim demographic and mechanism or weapon\ncharacteristics we observed across the classes were simi-\nlar to the correlations observed in previous research. These\ncharacteristics helped validate the existence of the pat-\nterns we identified. More research is still needed to help\nunderstand why different populations are drawn into dif-\nferent patterns of risk factors for suicide.\nSuicide is a complex problem that is typically precipi-\ntated by a variety of circumstances. With the use of LCA,\nthis study identified patterns of known risk factors among\ndecedents, which can hopefully provide more direction\non how to develop or combine prevention efforts. For\nongoing suicide mortality surveillance initiatives, this type\nof analysis also provides a more accurate and compre-\nhensive picture of the surrounding circumstances expe-\nrienced by suicide decedents. In this study, the com-\nmon theme across most classes of decedents was a need\nfor more connected medical, MH, substance abuse, court,\nand social services; one service alone might not suffi-\nciently prevent this problem. Furthermore, all dece-\ndents needed more social support, even those who were\ncurrently receiving MH counseling or treatment. Initia-\ntives that recruit family, friends, and community mem-\nbers to help those experiencing high levels of mental\nand/or life stress might further help prevent suicide.\nCorrespondence: Joseph Logan, PhD, Division of\nViolence Prevention, Etiology and Surveillance Branch,\nNational Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Hwy,\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Logan had full access to all of\nthe data in the study and takes responsibility for the in-\ntegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nFinancial Disclosure: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention.\nRole of the Sponsor: The Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention funding was provided for the design and\nconduct of the study; collection, management, analysis,\nand interpretation of the data; and preparation, review,\nand approval of the manuscript.\nDisclaimer: The findings and conclusions in this article\nare those of the authors and do not necessarily repre-\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.
