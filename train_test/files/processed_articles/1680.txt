As people age, fat becomes preferentially deposited in the abdominal region over the periphery, and such\nchanges are thought to be associated with adverse metabolic outcomes. We were interested in whether body mass index (EMI)\nand waist-hip ratio (WHR) are differentially associated with fasting insulin levels, triglycerides, and blood pressure (systolic\nand diastolic) in an older population. We were also interested in whether these associations change after controlling for genetic\ninfluences.\nMethods. Data were obtained as part of the Swedish Adoption/fwin Study of Aging. All blood samples and anthropometric\nResults. In men and women, WHR and BMI were significantly associated with all the metabolic variables except for dias-\ntolic blood pressure. When BMI's association with the metabolic variables was assessed independent ofWHR, it remained sig-\nnificantly associated with all metabolic variables except diastolic blood pressure in men and triglycerides in women. When\nWHR's association with the metabolic variables was assessed independent of BMI, it did not remain significantly associated\nwith any of the metabolic variables in men and remained significantly associated with insulin and diastolic pressure in women.\nAfter controlling for genetic effects, the relationship between WHR and the metabolic variables became nonsignificant.\nHowever, BMI remained significantly associated with systolic blood pressure and triglycerides in men, independent ofWHR,\nConclusion. The results suggest that overall body fat is important to consider in relation to these metabolic parameters in\nolder individuals. The results also suggest that BMI may share associations with blood pressure and triglycerides beyond those\nthat can be attributed to familial influences.\nOBESITY has been associated with numerous chronic con-\nditions including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\n(NIDDM), cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. However,\nresearch over the past 15 years has shown that abdominal obe-\nsity is more highly related to these chronic conditions than over-\nall obesity. For example, persons with a high waist-hip ratio\n(WHR) (measure of abdominal fatness) have a higher incidence\nof NIDDM, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperten-\nsion, and ischemic heart disease than those with peripheral obe-\nsity (1-5). There is still evidence, however, that general obesity\nis important; Young and Gelskey (6) found that noncentrally\nobese men did not differ from centrally obese men in levels of\nblood pressure and plasma lipids.\nThe clustering of these variables is often called the metabolic\nsyndrome, or syndrome X. Whether one disorder initiates the\nothers or whether the clustering of these relationships is due to\ngenetic effects is still unclear. There are known to be genetic in-\npressure (12,13), triglycerides (14), and fasting insulin levels\n(15), and these genetic effects may be in common to several of\nIt is important to address these issues, as aging is associated\nwith increased total fat mass, particularly in the abdominal area\n(17,18). We were interested in whether BMI and WHR were\ndifferentially associated with fasting insulin levels, triglyc-\nerides, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) in this older\nSwedish twin population. We were also interested in whether\nthere were any associations between BMI, WHR, and the\nmetabolic variables after controlling for genetic influences.\nMETHODS\nData for this study came from the Swedish Adoptionffwin\nStudy of Aging (SATSA). The SATSA sample of twins was\nidentified through the Swedish Twin Registry, which includes\ninformation on almost 25,000 pairs of like-sexed twins born in\nformed in 1984 by contacting twin pairs identified in the\nSwedish Twin Registry as having been reared apart, along with\nmatched pairs reared together. The identification and character-\nization of the SATSA sample has been described in detail else-\nwhere (20). In-person testing was conducted in three waves:\nstudy were taken from the second wave of in-person testing ob-\noriginally 266 complete twin pairs; however, after deleting\nthose pairs where at least one twin was using insulin, there were\nMZ and 98 DZ). The average age was 65 years, with a range\nof 45-89 years. Further details of SATSA are described by\nPedersen et al. (21).\nWHR was determined by dividing waist measurement by\nhip measurements. The waist circumference was obtained at\nthe smallest part of the waist, and hip circumference at the\nwidest point between the hip and buttock. BMI was calculated\nas weight (kg) divided by height (m-), Height (m) and weight\n(kg) were obtained from subjects dressed in lightweight clothes\nwith their shoes removed.\nSerum insulin was measured using a radioimmunoassay\ntechnique (RIA 100, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Blood pres-\nsure was obtained twice by trained nurses using a mercury\nsphygmomanometer with a cuff size of 17 em by 67 em with\nthe subject in a supine position after 5 minutes of rest. The fifth-\nphase Korotkoff sound was used as the diastolic reading. The\npressure was read to the nearest 2 mmHg. Serum triglycerides\nwere measured with an enzymatic calorimetric assay\n(Boehringer-Mannhein automated analysis for Hitachi system\n717, Diagnostica, Mannheim, Germany).\nStatisticalAnalysis\nDescriptive analyses and co-twin control analyses were per-\nformed using SAS software (22). The following variables were\nlog transformed due to their skewed distributions: BMI, triglyc-\neride levels, and fasting insulin levels. We used a multiple-\ngroup linear regression model to estimate the model coeffi-\ncients and standard errors using maximum likelihood\nestimation. The LISREL 8 (23) statistical package was used.\nTwin pairs with data for only one individual were deleted, as\nLISREL cannot use missing data. Covariance matrices were\nadjusted for age and used as input, and men and women were\nmodeled separately. The following dependent variables were\nused: log transformed fasting insulin levels, log transformed\ntriglyceride levels, and blood pressure (systolic [SBP] and dias-\ntolic [DBP]). WHR and BMI were used as the independent\nvariables in separate analyses. Analyses were also performed\nwith both WHR and BMI in the same model to assess each\nvariable's association with the metabolic factors independent of\nthe other. The correlation ofWHR and BMI was relatively high\nGenetically informative samples such as this are typically\nused to estimate genetic and environmental sources of variance;\nhowever, when such data are used for traditional analyses, such\nas the regression models in this study, the dependence among\nthe sample becomes problematic rather than informative.\nDependence among the sample can bias the estimates by de-\ncreasing the standard errors of the estimates, thus biasing to-\nward type I error (24,25). In twin studies, this problem is typi-\ncally dealt with by using only one twin of the pair at the\nexpense of losing half of the data. Eliminating subjects is un-\nnecessary because this source of bias is known and can be con-\ntrolled. This can be achieved by estimating the residual covari-\nance within a twin pair. [A marked increase in the standard\nerrors is noted when analysis adjusting for dependence is com-\npared to the unadjusted standard error (26).] Identical and fra-\nternal twins are treated as separate groups so that the residual\ncovariance can be modeled separately, while the regression co-\nefficients are constrained to be equal across groups (27).\nA co-twin control analysis was also performed in the identi-\ncal pairs to determine whether WHR and BMI had similar as-\nsociations with the dependent variables after controlling for ge-\nnetic effects. Because identical twins share 100% of their genes,\nany intrapair differences in measures of the dependent variables\ncan be attributed to nongenetic variation in the independent\nvariables. A linear regression analysis was performed where the\ndependent variables were intrapair difference in insulin levels,\ntriglyceride levels, and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)\nand the independent variables were intrapair differences in\nThe descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. The mean\nvalues for all variables are about average for an older adult pop-\nulation.\nIn Table 2, standardized estimates of regression coefficients\nare presented along with t values for the univariate association of\nfasting insulin levels, SBP, DBP, and triglycerides with BMI and\nWHR. In men, BMI and WHR were significantly associated\nwith insulin, SBP, and triglycerides, whereas only BMI was sig-\nnificantly associated with DBP. In women, BMI and WHR were\nalso significantly associated with insulin, SBP, and triglycerides\nbut only WHR was significantly associated with DBP.\nTable1.Means,StandardDeviations (SD), and SampleSize\nforMetabolic Variables in MalesandFemalesby Zygosity\nMales Females\nMean SD n (pairs) Mean SD n (pairs)\nWHR\nBMI\nFI\nlnFI\nSBP\nDBP\nTrig\nlnTrig\nNotes: WHR =waist-hip ratio, BMI =body mass index (kg/m'), InBMI =\nlog-transformed BMI (kg/m-), FI =fasting insulin levels (mU/liter), InFI =log-\ntransformed fasting insulin levels (mU/liter), SBP =systolic blood pressure\n(mmHg), DBP =diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), Trig =triglycerides\n(mmol/liter), and InTrig =log-transformed triglycerides (mmol/liter).\nTable2.

This analysis was per-\nformed only in the MZ twin pairs so it could be compared to\nthe co-twin control analyses. We found that in men, BMI was\nstillsignificantly associated with insulin, SBP, and triglycerides\nindependent of WHR, whereas WHR was not significantly as-\nsociated with any of the metabolic variables independent of\nBMI. In women, we found that BMI was still significantly as-\nsociated with insulin and SBP independent ofWHR, and WHR\nwas still significantly associated with insulin and DBP indepen-\ndentofBMI.\nGenetic effects were controlled for in a co-twin control anal-\nysis (Table 4). We found, in men, that BMI was independently\nassociated with SBP and triglycerides after controlling for ge-\nnetic influences, and WHR was not associated with any of the\nvariables after controlling for genetic influences. We need to in-\nterpret the results in women with caution, as we found that BMI\nbecame significantly associated with DBP after controlling for\ngenetic effects; however, all other associations became non-\nsignificant as they did in men. Overall, these findings suggest\nthat BMI may share influences with blood pressure and triglyc-\nerides beyond those attributed to familial similarities, whereas\nWHR does not appear to share such nonfamilial influences.\nDISCUSSION\nOverall, these results suggest that in older men and women,\noverall body fat and abdominal fat are both associated with the\nTable3.

When BMI and WHR are analyzed indepen-\ndently, men have a greater number of significant associations\nbetween BMI and the metabolic factors than between WHR\nand the metabolic factors. Women have a similar number of\nsignificant associations for WHR and BMI and the metabolic\nfactors. These results also suggest that BMI shares nonfamilial\ninfluences to a greater extent with blood pressure and triglyc-\nerides than the other metabolic variables.\nThe relationship ofWHR with these metabolic factors has\nbeen documented extensively over the past few years. Fat lo-\ncated in the abdominal area, specifically the visceral adipocytes,\nhas been shown to be more atherogenic than fat located in other\nareas of the body (1-5). Although we could not directly mea-\nsure the visceral adipocytes, the WHR has been shown to be a\ngood indicator of abdominal fat and the associated metabolic\nvariables (4). Interestingly we found that in men, the overall fat\nmeasure indicated by BMI was significantly related to more of\nthe metabolic variables than was WHR. In interpreting these\nfindings we must be careful, however, because of the limita-\ntions in our measure of abdominal fat. Aging is associated with\nchanges in body fat distribution toward the abdominal area,\nparticularly increases in visceral fat (4,18). Although these men\nare not considered centrally obese, they still could have a large\namount of visceral or deep fat. Overall, these results suggest\nthat peripheral fat, as indicated by BMI, is an important marker\nof metabolic parameters in aging individuals; however, we can-\nnot discount WHR as an important consideration. Young and\nGelskey (6) found both WHR and BMI to independently pre-\ndict blood pressure, triglycerides, and fasting glucose levels in\nmen and women with an age range 18-74 years.\nIn women, WHR is significantly associated with the same\nnumber of metabolic variables as BMI. Women, in general, do\nnot have the amount of abdominal fat as men, although more\nfat is deposited in the abdominal area, particularly the visceral\ndepots, as they become postmenopausal. Although we did not\nhave direct measures of menopausal status, the average age of\nthis population was 65 years-suggesting most of the women\nin this population were postmenopausal. As stated earlier, we\ncould not directly measure the type of adipocytes, and thus our\nconclusions are limited regarding the amount of visceral fat\nthese women may have; but as in the men, these results sug-\ngest BMI is important to consider in relation to the metabolic\nparameters.\nThe relationship of these variables is still not completely un-\nderstood. It could be that insulin resistance is the initiator of\nhigh triglyceride levels and increased blood pressure. This has\nbeen hypothesized by several people including Raven and col-\nleagues (28,29), Ferrannini and associates (30), and DeFronzo\nand Ferrannini (31). In this study, both BMI and WHR are as-\nsociated with higher fasting insulin levels to about the same de-\ngree; therefore, both BMI and WHR could be involved in initi-\nating insulin resistance, which in tum could influence the other\nmetabolic variables.\nThe co-twin control analyses were used to determine\nwhether associations remained once genetic influences of im-\nportance to the dependent and independent variables were con-\ntrolled. A finding of no association in these analyses suggests\nthat there may have been genetic influences shared by the mea-\nsures. Because almost all significant associations between BMI\nand WHR and the metabolic variables dropped out after con-\ntrolling for genetic influences, this study indicates that there\nmay be unique genetic influences or common genetic influ-\nences between both WHR and BMI and the other metabolic\nvariables. It could also be that there is some underlying liability\nwhereby the insulin levels or both abdominal fatness and over-\nall fatness reach a threshold, and this \"turns on\" other genetic\neffects that alter the other metabolic measures. The potential for\nshared genetic influences among these variables has been seen\nin other studies: Carmelli and coworkers (16) found, in a sam-\nple of male twins, that a common latent factor explained the\nclustering of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Fifty-nine per-\ncent of the variation in the latent factor was genetic variation,\nthe remaining being environmental. In the San Antonio Family\nHeart Study (10), the genetic correlations were high among\nfasting insulin levels, BMI, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL) level, WHR, and triglycerides, indicating that the same\ngene or set of genes may influence these traits. Finally, Hong\nand associates (13) found, using data also from SATSA, shared\ngenetic effects on BMI, insulin resistance, triglycerides, HDL\ncholesterol and systolic blood pressure; BMI and insulin resis-\ntance shared genetic effects to the greatest extent.\nIn males, the nongenetic or, more specifically, nonfamilial\neffects shared between BMI and blood pressure and BMI and\ntriglycerides are important to consider, as presence of these ef-\nfects suggests that these variables may cluster more as a result\nof nonfamilial environmental factors. Such influences would\ninclude factors within individuals that affect both BMI and\nblood pressure and BMI and triglycerides independent of\nshared environmental or genetic factors. It may be that BMI\nreaches a certain threshold whereby the individual becomes in-\nsulin resistant. This insulin resistance produces hyperinsuline-\nmia, and the hyperinsulinemia then affects the renin-an-\ngiotensin system causing sodium reabsorption, which eventu-\nally leads to hypertension (32,33). Insulin also has been shown\nto cause vascular smooth muscle proliferation (34) as well as\nincreases in plasma catecholamine concentration, which also\nmay increase blood pressure. The insulin resistance and hyper-\ninsulinemia may also affect triglyceride levels by increasing\nfree fatty acid release from adipocytes, which then act as sub-\nstrate for triglyceride synthesis (2, 28).\nMayer and associates (15) found in female twins, after con-\ntrolling for genetic effects, BMI to be associated with fasting\ninsulin levels. They also found, after controlling for BMI, atten-\nuation of the correlations between insulin, triglycerides, and\nblood pressure. The findings suggest that overall body fatness\nmay playa significant role in the development of the other\nmetabolic factors.\nThe next step is to evaluate, through a quantitative genetic\nanalysis, how much of the variance is genetic and how much\ngenetic variance may be shared among these variables. Hong\nand coworkers (13) have already performed such analyses at an\nearlier time point for BMI, insulin resistance, systolic blood\npressure, triglycerides, and HDL in the SATSA sample, as de-\nscribed earlier. However, further work including WHR and ob-\ntaining separate estimates for men and women is necessary.\nFuture work in this area also needs to clearly distinguish be-\ntween visceral adipocytes and subcutaneous adipoyctes (both\nabdominal and peripheral) and the extent to which metabolic\nproblems are associated with each as well as whether these as-\nsociations change for middle-aged to older individuals.\n"
