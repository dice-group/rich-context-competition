From relatively automatic processes, such as attention and memory, to more\neffortful processes, such as logical reasoning and decision-making, psychological\nadaptations are present at all levels of human cognition (Maner, Gailliot and DeWall,\n2007). In processing mating information, for example, one must first identify and\ndifferentiate between features of the opposite sex carrying different implications for\nreproduction. After reproductive-diagnostic cues have been perceived, one must decide on\nfunctionally beneficial behavioral responses that effectively facilitate reproductive success.\nA recent study reported that men preferred to look at a woman's face when primed by long-\nterm mating goals, whereas they preferred to look at a woman's body when primed by\nAttention towards face or body\nshort-term mating goals (Confer, Perilloux and Buss, 2010). These findings point to a\nmating-specific adaptive functioning of the higher-order cognitive process. Does the lower-\norder cognitive system have a similar perceptual preference between the face and body\nwhich is driven by long-term versus short-term reproductive goals? The purpose of the\npresent study is to answer this question by assessing automatic attention to the face or the\nbody of the opposite sex under long-term or short-term mating motivation.\nAttention is the first step in encoding information. Its evolutionary function is to\nsearch for and capture information relevant to survival and reproductive goals. Given\nlimited or finite attentional capacity (resulting from life history trade-offs and the\nevolutionary principle of economy) and the diverse and complex social information\npotentially available, attentional selectivity has evolved to capture and hold information\nthat is most relevant to fitness-enhancing goals. For example, human attention, as well as\nthat of other animal species, is preferentially drawn to animate over inanimate objects in\norder to avoid predation (New, Cosmides and Tooby, 2007), and it is more sensitive to\nemotional rather than non-emotional facial expressions of conspecifics as a means for\nconducting social interactions more effectively (Fox, Russo, Bowles and Dutton, 2001).\nThus, limited attentional capacity should be used in the most necessary fashion, thereby\nproviding optimal information for subsequent cognitive processing.\nAttentional selectivity is equally important in processing mating information. In a\nmating context, a heterosexual individual must be able to differentiate members of the\nopposite sex of high versus low mate value (Maner, Gailliot and DeWall, 2007). Automatic\nattention to features representing different aspects of mate quality is essential for efficient\nidentification and differentiation of suitable potential mates. Human attention is able to\ntarget (Duncan, Park, Faulkner, Schaller, Neuberg and Kenrick, 2007) and fixate toward\n(Maner, Gailliot and DeWall, 2007; Maner, Gailliot, Rouby and Miller, 2007) features of\nhigh-quality mating partners. For example, Duncan et al. (2007) asked participants to detect\nchanges in an array of four opposite-sex faces that differed in their level of attractiveness\nand appeared and disappeared alternately. Male participants with unrestricted sociosexual\norientation were faster at detecting changes in attractive female faces than they were at\ndetecting changes in unattractive female faces, suggesting attentional selectivity and acuity\nover the facial features that signal high mate quality. Similar to such attentional\nengagement is the effect of sexual attractiveness on attentional disengagement, whereby\nmale participants took a longer time to disengage their attention from attractive female\nfaces than they did from unattractive ones (Maner et al., 2007). Automatic attention to mate\nquality also differed between participants who either were primed by long-term romantic\nrelationships (Maner, Rouby and Gonzaga, 2008) or were committed to long-term\nrelationships (Maner, Gailliot and Miller, 2009) and those who were not primed to be or\nwere not already in a committed relationship. Similar effects were not found among\nwomen.\nWhereas the above supports attentional selectivity towards aspects of mate quality\ndistributed across different potential mates, selective attention is also exercised over\ndifferent facial and bodily features of the same individual. This may be particularly true for\nhuman males who face the challenge of assessing two mating-related uncertainties within\nthe same individual: (1) uncertainty over female fertility (i.e., actual reproduction),\nAttention towards face or body\nincluding fecundity (i.e., reproductive potential) which is age-graded (from menarche to\nmenopause), and fertilizability, which is time-sensitive (the fertile phase is brief and\nconcealed during the ovulation cycle), and (2) uncertainty over his own paternity because\nmales face the challenge of female infidelity which is facilitated by some of the same\nfemale fertility characteristics (e.g., concealed ovulation). The female face and body\nprovide both overlapping and distinct assessment information for the male evaluator. The\nface is the best indicator of age, which represents perhaps the most important aspect of a\nfemale's mate value (Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999). The color, luster, and volume of hair\nindicate youth and health (Gangestad and Scheyd, 2005), whereas the overall facial\nimpression of femininity implies fertility (Enlow, 1990) and maternal nurturing and warmth\n(Perrett et al., 1998). Corneocytes and collagen, which give the skin the appearance of\nsoftness and vascularization, are enhanced by estrogens and these degenerate after\nmenopause (Farage, Neill and MacLean, 2009). The face also contains information about\nfluctuating asymmetry and smoothness of skin which, as indicators of overall immunity\n(Sugiyama, 2004), represent long-term mating and child rearing considerations. Finally,\nfacial features and expressions contain perceptual cues to the assessment of paternity\nuncertainty. A face may look honest or dishonest, and sexually reserved or flirtatious\n(Grammer, Honda, Juette and Schmitt, 1999; Schmidt and Cohn, 2001), whereas such\nassessments cannot be made from visual inspections of the body.\nThe major contributors to female bodily attractiveness include waist-to-hip ratio\n(Singh, Dixson, Jessop, Morgan and Dixson, 2010) and body mass index (Cornelissen,\nHancock, Kiviniemi, George and Tov\u00e9e, 2009), both of which indicate her current fertility\nstatus (Confer et al., 2010). Optimal reproductive potential is reached at around 17 years of\nhormone-based developmental characteristics are arguably best summarized by the waist-\nto-hip ratio. Thus, calibration of overall reproductive value or fecundity as mostly indicated\nby the face is future-oriented, whereas fertilizability, most noticeably advertised by the\nwaist-to-hip ratio, carries time immediacy. For example, current infertility of a pregnant\nwoman is best shown by her unattractive waist-to-hip ratio, whereas her facial features\nrepresenting overall reproductive value (including future fertility) would not show similarly\ndrastic changes. On the other hand, pregnancy as indicated by a large waist-to-hip ratio\nrepresents a current state of infertility, whereas honest, prudent, and sexually reserved\nfacial cues and expressions are useful for assessing future fidelity that is related to\npaternity. As an adaptation to these potentially inconsistent cues, especially in representing\nfuture versus current reproduction, male visual attention may have evolved to selectively\nattend to different cues for long-term versus short-term mating goals.\nIn the present study, we tested the hypothesis that men's visual attention would\nautomatically shift to the face or body of the opposite sex as a function of long-term versus\nshort-term mating motivation. We focused this hypothesis on men because, as an\nadaptation to concealed and pre-menopausal ovulation, men have evolved special visual\nsensitivity toward secondary sexual features distributed in the female face and body\n(Thornhill and Grammer, 1999). We included women as a comparison group, in whom the\nsame perceptual effects were not expected, because women do not have the same fertility\nand maternity challenges. We also controlled for sociosexuality which taps individual\nAttention towards face or body\ndifferences in one's interest and willingness to engage in casual sexual relationships (Penke\nand Asendorpf, 2008) and has been found to influence aspects of mating behavior (e.g.,\nManer et al., 2007) including visual attention (Duncan et al., 2007). We tested our\nhypothesis in three experiments by using attention disengagement, engagement, and\ndistraction paradigms after participants were primed with long-term versus short-term\nrelationship goals. In Study 1, we used a dot probe task to examine the speed with which\nthe participants disengaged their attention from the face or the body of the opposite sex. In\nStudy 2, we examined how long the participants engaged their attention towards the face or\nthe body of the opposite sex while they were performing a change detection task. In Study\n3, we examined the probability of, and the speed with which participants were distracted by\nthe face or body while they were simultaneously performing another visual task. We\nexpected that, among men but not women, attention would be more drawn to and fixed on\nthe face of the opposite sex when primed by the long-term mating goal, and relatively more\ndrawn to the body under the short-term mating goal.\nMethods\nParticipants\nOne hundred and eleven heterosexual undergraduate students (mean age = 20.61,\nSD = .87, 47 males) were recruited from a 3-year community college in a large city in\nsouthern China. By random assignment, 56 participants were primed for a long-term\nrelationship and the others were primed for a short-term relationship. The dependent\nvariable was derived from a task in which the participants had to view photographs of\nattractive members of the opposite sex.\nPriming Material\nFor three minutes, the participants read one of two scenarios of similar length about\na long-term or a short-term mating relationship in which the participants were asked to\nimagine themselves as the protagonist of the mating scenario. This method has been\nsuccessfully used to activate long-term or short-term mating goals (e.g., Griskevicius,\nCialdini and Kenrick, 2006). In the long-term scenario, a male participant was asked to\nimagine that he spent a wonderful evening with his attractive girlfriend, cooking and\nhaving dinner at his place, talking about how he would like to spend the rest of his life with\nher and to provide her and their children with a nice home and a comfortable living, and, at\nthe end of the evening, he walked her home, kissed her goodnight and went back home by\nhimself. In the short-term relationship scenario, a male participant was asked to imagine\nthat, during an overseas trip, he met and flirted with an attractive woman in a bar, and the\nwoman liked him. They then went to his hotel room and had a passionate night, and on the\nnext day he said goodbye to her and continued with his trip. The two priming stories for the\nfemale participants were similar to those for males with the exception that the protagonist\nwas a woman who either planned her future life with her boyfriend (long-term condition) or\nhad a passionate night with a handsome man (short-term condition).\nAttention towards face or body\nFigure 1. Illustration of the attention task in Study 1. The example shows stimuli\nused for male participants, whereas female participants used a different set of\nstimuli using male targets.\nAttention Disengagement Task\nThe \"Dot Probe Task\" has been used previously to measure participants' focus of\nattention and to assess biases of attentional disengagement away from specific stimuli (e.g.,\nManer, Gailliot and DeWall, 2007). If a participant was attracted to the face (or the body)\nshown in the opposite-sex photograph, then his or her attention would be fixed to that part.\nThis fixation should therefore attenuate his or her attention away from the new stimulus, if\nthat stimulus is presented in a position different from the original stimulus, resulting in a\nslower response in this condition.\nIn each trial, in the center of the computer screen, a fixation cross \"+\" appeared for\n500 ms, and then an opposite-sex photograph appeared for 500 ms (Figure 1). The\nphotograph showed the person from head to knees and was positioned so that the chest area\nappeared in the center of the screen with the face and the waist each at a similar distance\nfrom the center. Immediately after the photograph appeared, an object (a circle or a square)\nappeared either in the upper (the face position in the previous photograph) or the lower part\nof the screen (the waist position in the previous photograph). The participant's task was to\nidentify as quickly as possible whether the object was a circle or a square; to do this they\nhad to press the letter \"O\" or \"P\" on the keyboard. After each response, the participant was\ngiven a 1,000 ms break before the next trial. There were four practice and 40 test trials. In\nAttention towards face or body\nhalf of the trials, the object appeared on the upper part of the screen and, in the other half,\nthe object appeared on the lower part of the screen. Half of the objects were circles and half\nwere squares. The order of location and shape of the object was randomized. The\nphotographs (44 women or 44 men for participants of the opposite sex) were selected from\ninternet picture banks and were processed by Photoshop in order to achieve the same size\nand a similar brightness and contrast. Rated by an independent group of 20 undergraduate\nmale and 18 female students on a 10-point scale, the attractiveness ratings were M = 7.62\n(SD = .46) for the female photographs and M = 7.48 (SD = .66) for the male photographs.\nSociosexual Orientation\nWe used scores on the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (Penke and\nAsendorpf, 2008) as a covariate to control for individual differences in participants'\nattitudes toward casual sex. Sample items include \"with how many different partners have\nyou had sex within the past 12 months\" and \"I can imagine myself being comfortable and\nenjoying `casual' sex with different partners.\" Rated on a uniform 9-point scale, higher SOI\nscores indicate more unrestricted sociosexual orientation or higher willingness to engage in\nan uncommitted sexual relationship. The internal consistency reliability estimate in this\nProcedure and Design\nAll tasks were completed individually. Upon arriving at the experiment room, each\nparticipant signed a consent form and received a brief introduction about the experimental\nprocesses. The participant was then given the mating scenario which they were asked to\nread and to remember the details for a memory test later on. Afterwards, the participant\ncompleted the attention task by viewing 44 opposite-sex photographs. The participants\ncompleted the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory last. The design was a 2 (participant\ngender) \u00d7 2 (mating prime: long-term versus short-term, manipulated between participants)\n\u00d7 2 (focus of attention: face versus body, manipulated within participants) mixed model\nANCOVA, with SOI score as a covariate.\nResults\nTrials with incorrect responses (3.10%) and those with unreasonably fast responses\n(usually due to starting the task before the starting prompt; RT < 300 ms; .85%) were\nexcluded from the analysis. Following previous priming experiments (e.g., Lemm, Dabady\nand Banaji, 2005), extremely long responses (more than 3 SD above the mean of each\nparticipant) were trimmed to the RT value of 3 SD above the mean (.74%). If a\nparticipant's attention was previously attracted to the face, his or her response to the object\nappearing in the face position should be faster than that appearing on the waist/hip position.\nSimilarly, if the participant's attention was previously drawn to the waist/hip position, his\nor her response to the object appearing on the face should be slower than that appearing on\nthe waist/hip position.\nThe ANCOVA showed a main effect of participant gender, reflecting generally\nAttention towards face or body\nThere was also a two-way interaction between mating prime and focus of attention (F (1,\nSeparate analyses of the male participants showed an interaction effect between the\n.21, p = .65, 2 = .005). The male participants primed with short-term mating goals\n.25), thereby suggesting that their attention was previously fixed at the waist/hip position.\nBy contrast, when primed with long-term mating goals, there were no significant\ndifferences in men's response time between the waist/hip position (M = 487.56 ms, SD =\n.04). For the female participants, there was no main effect either for mating prime (F (1,\nThere was also no interaction between mating prime and focus of attention (F (1, 61) = .63,\np = .43, 2 = .01). In the next study, we used the \"change blindness paradigm\" to further\nassess the location of the participants' natural visual attention (Rensink, O'Regan and\nAttention towards face or body\nFigure 2. Attentional disengagement from bodies and faces of the opposite sex as functions\nof mating prime and participant gender in study 2 (Error bars indicate \u00b1 S.E.).\nMethod\nParticipants and Design\nmales) were recruited from a community college in a metropolis of southern China. They\nwere randomly assigned to either a long-term (n = 58) or short-term relationship priming\nconditions. We used a 2 (participant gender) \u00d7 2 (priming of mating motivation: long-\nversus short-term) \u00d7 2 (focus of attention: face versus body) mixed model design. The\ndependent variable was the participants' reaction time in performing a change blindness\ntask.\nPreference of Attention\nThe \"change blindness paradigm\", which has been successfully used to access\npreferential attention to specific objects (New, Cosmides and Tooby, 2007), was used to\nmeasure the participants' visual preference for the face or the body. Two pictures that were\nidentical except for one feature change either in the face or in the waist/hip area of the\nopposite-sex photograph were presented to the participants as a stream of rapidly\nalternating pictures on the computer screen (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3, the change\noccurred on the clothes and accessories in the waist/hip area or, for the face position, in the\nhairstyle and clothing accessories near the face. The faster that a participant spotted the\ndifference between the two flashing alternations, the more preferentially he or she attended\nto the changing locale. In each trial, a fixation cross \"+\" of 500 milliseconds was followed\nAttention towards face or body\nby a flash of two almost identical pictures rapidly alternating on the computer screen. The\nparticipants were asked to locate the change by pressing the \"1\" key and then to type a few\nwords to describe the change. Participants then had to click a button at the bottom of the\nscreen to start the next trial. There were four practice trials and 40 test trials. In half of the\ntrials the change was in the face, and in the other half the change occurred in the waist/hip\narea. The same set of photographs used in Study 1 was used to generate the flashes. The\ntime that elapsed after the first picture appeared and before the computer key was pressed\nwas counted as Reaction Time.\nFigure 3. Illustration of the change blindness paradigm in Study 2. Below is an example of\nthe stimuli used for male participants (female participants used a different set of stimuli\ndepicting male targets)\nResults\nAs in Study 1, extremely long responses (above 3 SD from the mean of each\nparticipant) were trimmed to the RT value of 3 SD above the mean (.85%). No responses\nshorter than 300ms occurred. A 2 (participant gender) \u00d7 2 (mating prime: long-term versus\nshort-term) \u00d7 2 (focus of attention: face versus body) mixed model ANCOVA with SOI\nscore as a covariate showed a main effect of participant gender (F (1, 111) = 40.85, p <\nAttention towards face or body\n(Figure 4). A separate analysis of male participants showed an interaction between mating\n.38, 2 = .02). Males primed with short-term mating goals detected changes in the waist/hip\nterm mating goals, male participants were slower at detecting changes in the waist/hip area\nthe female participants, there were no significant interactions or main effects.\nFigure 4. Detecting changes in bodies and faces of the opposite sex as functions of mating\nprime and participant gender in study 2 (error bars indicate \u00b1 S.E.)\nStudy 1 used attention disengagement and Study 2 used attention engagement to\nassess automatic attention to the face or the body. In both studies, a faster response time\nconfirmed our mating-related hypothesis. In the next study, we used an opposite paradigm\nto see how much of the men's attention to an ongoing task was differently distracted by the\nface or the body of attractive members of the opposite sex. Because Study 1 and Study 2\nshowed no attentional differences between male faces and male bodies among the female\nparticipants, the next study used male participants only.\nMethod\nAttention towards face or body\nParticipants\nForty-four heterosexual male undergraduate students (mean age = 20.72, SD = 1.24)\nwere recruited from a 3-year community college in southern China. By random assignment,\nhalf of the participants were primed for a long-term relationship and half were primed for a\nshort-term relationship. The dependent variable was derived from a simple attention task in\nwhich participants had to view photographs of attractive members of the opposite sex.\nAttention Distraction\nA photograph of an attractive female face or waist/hip area was presented in the\ncentre of the screen. A letter \"O\" or \"Q\" appeared either on the left or the right side of the\nface or the waist/hip picture (Figure 5). Each participant's task was to indentify whether the\nletter was \"O\" or \"Q\". Response latency in completing this simple task indicates potential\nvisual distraction from either the face or the waist/hip area.\nFigure 5. Illustration of the Letter Identification Task in Study 3\nDesign and Procedure\nStudy 3 used a 2 (priming of mating motivation: long-term versus short-term\nmanipulated between participants) \u00d7 2 (distraction of attention: face versus waist/hip\nmanipulated within participants) mixed design. The procedure was the same as in Study 1\nand Study 2 except for the attention distraction task described above. There were four\npractice trials and 40 test trials. In half of the trials, the letter \"O\" or \"Q\" appeared next to\nthe face picture, and in the other half of trials it appeared next to the waist/hip picture. The\nposition (left or right) and the type of letter (\"O\" or \"Q\") were counterbalanced across the\ntrials.\nResults\nAs before, trials with incorrect responses (3.35%) and unreasonably fast responses\nAttention towards face or body\n(RT < 300 ms; 0%) were excluded from the analysis. Extremely long responses (above 3\nSD from the mean of each participant) were trimmed to the RT value of 3 SD above the\nmean (.91%). A longer RT in letter identification suggests that the participant's attention\nwas distracted by the face or waist/hip picture appearing on the side of the letter.\nA 2 (mating prime: long-term versus short-term) \u00d7 2 (distraction of attention: face\nversus body) mixed model ANCOVA with SOI score added as a covariate showed the\ninteraction effect between mating prime and distraction of attention (F (1, 41) = 37.91, p <\nterm mating condition, letter recognition was slower when the letter was presented with the\nletter recognition when the letter was presented with the face (M = 630.33 ms, SD = 67.89)\nwas similar to that when the letter was presented with the waist/hip area (M = 620.53 ms,\nFigure 6. Attentional distraction of bodies and faces as a function of mating prime in study\n3 (error bars indicate \u00b1 S.E.)\nDiscussion\nBy using different attention research paradigms, we demonstrated that there is an\nAttention towards face or body\nautomatic shift of attention between the body and the face of the opposite sex among men,\nbut not among women, as a function of their long-term versus short-term mating\nmotivations. Study 1 showed that under the short-term mating motivation, men's attention\nwas captured by the waist/hip area rather than by the face on photographs of attractive\nwomen, whereas women's attention was captured equally by the waist/hip area and the face\non photographs of attractive men. Consistent with Study 1, Study 2 showed that men's\nattention shifted between the female face and body as a function of long-term and short-\nterm mating motivations, and this same attention-shifting effect was absent in women.\nUsing a distraction task, Study 3 showed that when primed with short-term rather than\nlong-term mating goals, men's attention was more likely to be distracted by the waist/hip\narea than by the face of attractive women.\nThese results support the evolutionary view that, similar to other domain-specific\ncognitive adaptations, visual processing in the mating domain may also be fashioned by an\nadaptive process driven by sexual selection and specific mating goals. Human attention has\nbeen adaptively tuned to be sensitive to cues that help to solve fitness-relevant issues,\nincluding mating (Schaller, Park and Kenrick, 2007). Because men and women have faced\ndifferent reproductive challenges, they can be expected to pay attention to different\nperceptual cues within the mating domain. Men have faced two recurrent reproductive\nchallenges, namely, fertility uncertainty and paternity uncertainty. As an adaptation, men\ndirect attention to perceptual cues of female fecundity and fertilizability, especially when\nshort-term mating goals are activated. Whereas information about female fertility is\ncontained both in the face and the body, the most direct and noticeable indicator of current\nfertilizability is the waist-to-hip ratio (Confer et al., 2010; Currie and Little, 2009). As\nshown in the present study, men driven by short-term mating motivation paid greater\nattention to the waist/hip area rather than the face. Automatic attention to and subsequent\ncalibration of fertilizability based on the waist-to-hip ratio may have helped men to solve\nthe short-term mating challenge of fertility uncertainty.\nIn pursuing long-term relationships, on the other hand, it is adaptive for a man to\nattend to perceptual cues that help him to assess and perhaps reduce his paternity\nuncertainty. Most attributes leading to the reduction of paternity uncertainty are contained\nin facial rather than bodily appearance. These may include looking honest versus dishonest,\nsubmissive versus aggressive, and sexually reserved versus frivolous. In addition to\nindicating paternity, the face also carries cues of future reproductive value, including\ninformation about symmetry, fecundity, and femininity (Rhodes, 2006; Thornhill and\nGangestad, 1999). In the present study, men paid attention to the face rather than the body\nof attractive women when primed by long-term relationship goals. Such perceptual\nattention may have helped to solve long-term mating challenges, including that of reducing\npaternity uncertainty.\nIn the evolutionary past, a woman's reproductive challenge has been the\nprocurement of resources to help her during pregnancy and when raising her young.\nIndicators of paternal and provisioning ability are contained in the face (e.g., conspicuous\nbrow ridges indicating status (Mazur and Booth, 1998) and large pupils indicating\nsensitivity (Tombs and Silverman, 2004)) and in facial expressions (Roney, Hanson,\nDurante and Maestripieri, 2006). However, some of these traits are also contained in body\nAttention towards face or body\nfeatures (e.g., masculinity and muscularity; Frederick and Haselton, 2007; Singh, 1995).\nAncestral women also needed to procure good genes to ensure offspring genetic quality,\nincluding immunity against pathogens. Indicators of good genes are also contained in both\nthe face (e.g., symmetry) and the body (e.g., muscularity). Such pre-copulation\nconsiderations are also driven by the fertilizable status of women. Women are more\ninterested in short-term mating relations when they are ovulating than when they are not\n(e.g., Gangestad, Thornhill and Garver, 2002; Gu\u00e9guen, 2009). It is likely that women may\nlook at the male face and body differently during the different phases of their menstrual\ncycle (Penton-Voak et al., 1999). Whereas the present study focuses on men, future studies\ncould examine automatic perceptual processes among women as functions of their\nmenstrual cycle phase.\nFuture studies may also investigate other conditions which may result in perceptual\nchanges in the visual processing of the opposite sex. For example, whether or not a man is\ncurrently engaged in a long-term relationship (Maner et al., 2009), and whether or not he is\nsecure about the relationship, may affect his sense of paternity certainty and hence his\nperceptual processing of the female face and body. Social status or self-perceived social\nstatus, which could be measured as one's current social status or could be experimentally\nmanipulated, may also affect men's self-efficacy regarding paternity assessment and female\nfertility accessibility. These mental states may in turn result in automatic attention to\ndifferent perceptual cues from the opposite sex. Future studies may also employ eye-\ntracking technology to obtain more detailed and precise measurements of perceptual\ncharacteristics in processing the secondary sexual features of the opposite sex. Despite\nthese and other improvements that could be made in future studies, this is one of the\nearliest studies to examine how men and women view the face and the body of the opposite\nsex. Building on Confer et al. (2010), the present study examined men's automatic attention\nto photographic images of the female face or body which were also presented\nsimultaneously. The results confirm the evolutionary view that mating-related perceptual\nprocessing is domain-specific and has been shaped by sexual selection and specific mating\ngoals.\nReferences\nBuss, D. M.
