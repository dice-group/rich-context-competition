    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe usefulness of wood to mankind varies from place to place, community to community, state to state, and nation to nation.\nWood is a natural product, which is one of the components of biodiversity and a bio-product that serves numerous purposes\nto mankind. Such multifunctional purposes include those of sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural aspects of man.\nThis article examines some traditional aspects of wood consumption in Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State,\nNigeria, with a view to ascertaining the uses to which the people put wood as a by-product of the trees around them. In-\ndepth interview, on-the-site observation, and focused group discussion were used to elicit information from knowledgeable\nelders, artisans, and wood vendors in different towns that make up the local government area. This research brings to\nlimelight aspects of wood consumption in Anaocha and lends credence to the belief that wood is still the major source of\nrevenue and energy in rural areas, probably because it is a free gift of nature. The research findings show that modernization\nhas not completely eroded the value of wood in the study area.\n",

Kramer (2006) also noted\nthat man has learnt to burn wood to warm up himself and to\novercome fear of the night. With time, he began to cook with\nit. Thus, cooking and eating utensils were also fashioned\nfrom wood. Therefore, wood is the most important material\ncontact man has with the entire body of his ancestry. It has\nbeen paramount in aiding, comforting, and paving the way to\ncivilization. Wood is one of the oldest source of energy and\ncommonest service material known to man, and has been\nfamily size, cost of wood, season, type of cooking device,\nalternative energy sources, and the type of wood determine\nthe level of wood consumption (Hamed, 1990). According to\nFood and Agricultural Organization of United Nations\n(1995), two out of five people worldwide depend on wood or\ncharcoal as the source of domestic energy. Floor (1997)\nnoted that wood represented 60% to 90% of the energy\nconsumption of Africans. In the dry savanna zone of Africa,\nwood is the major source of energy (Keita, 1987). In the\nSudan and Sahel climatic zones, majority of the urban popu-\nlation and the totality of the rural people depend exclusively\nThe introduction of Western culture has led to the love\nand quest for metal/enamel wares, and ceramic objects, with\ndeclining interest in wood products. Hence, wood products\nare now sold side by side with metal or ceramic objects in\nmarkets, with the latter gaining upper hand in terms of quan-\ntities and quality of products produced and sold. In fact, there\nis the belief in some quarters that if wood products are not\npatronized, it would over time discourage their production.\nThis belief has led to the fear that if wood resources are not\nconserved for future generations, they will go into extinction\nlike most African phenomena. In recognition of this immi-\nnent disappearance of natural assets, Eluyemi (2002) has\nadvised that all movable and immovable cultural heritage\n1Department of Archaeology and Tourism, University of Nigeria, Nsukka,\nNigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nEmeka E.

Unless this is done, the material evidence of our past\nstands the risk of obliteration. If that happens, the link\nbetween the past and the present is severed. This argument\nexplains why there is need to document aspects of wood con-\nsumption in Anaocha Local Government Area (LGA) of\nAnambra State, Nigeria.\nMethod\nThe article examined the various aspects of wood consump-\ntion in Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State,\nwith a view to ascertaining its implications on the lives of the\npeople (see Figure 1). The study used in-depth interview and\non-the-site observation to elicit information. Semistructured\ninterview was conducted with two categories of people (key\ninformants). They are those who are directly involved in the\nwood consumption and the local historians. The local arti-\nsans provided information on the production processes, the\nraw materials used, and uses of finished products. They also\ngave insights into the types of products, patterns of demand,\nprices, and categories of buyers, whereas the local historians\nprovided useful background information. A cross-case analy-\nsis method was used to analyze the interviews conducted.\nThis entailed grouping the responses from different people to\nthe questions or analyzing different perspectives on central\nFigure 1. Map of Anaocha Local Government Area showing wood consumption areas.\nOkonkwo et al. 3\nissues. Through this technique, the semistructured interview\nguide constituted a descriptive analytical framework for the\nqualitative data analysis.\nResults and Findings\nWood for Architectural Purpose\nIn Anaocha LGA, hardwoods such as mahogany (Afzelia\nafricana), iroko (Milicia excelsa), palm trees (Elaeis\nguineensis), ebony (Diospyros species), and others constitute\nmajor raw materials for architectural works such as roofing\nof houses, wooden doors and windows, fortifications, and\nwooden floors. These wood species are used by most people\nin building shops/stores, dwelling houses, shrines, animal\npens, and yam bans. Presently, due to the influence of civili-\nzation, architectural uses of wood are gradually being\nreplaced with modern raw materials for building such as\ncement blocks, bricks, aluminum roofing sheets, window\nglasses, and rods (see Figure 2).\nWood for Musical Instruments\nMost musical instruments, such as flutes, drums, gongs,\nbongo, okbokolo, ichaka, and so forth, of both ancient and\ncontemporary Anaocha people are made of wood of different\ntypes, ranging from hardwood Iroko to soft ones such as\nAkpu--Ceiba pentandra. Four types of wooden musical\ninstruments were identified. The differences are based on\ntheir functions. They are membranophones (Uboaka), aero-\nphones (wind instruments; Opi onu), metallophone\n(Okungwa), and other resonant materials (Akumaku Aka).\nMembranophones (Uboaka) are rhythmical sound-\nproducing instruments furnished with tensely strained mem-\nbranes, which are caused to vibrate by percussion or by fric-\ntion to produce sound. The pitch produced from them varies\nwith the degree of tension of the membrane. Because of this,\nthe name \"leather drum\" properly applies. There are two\ndrums of this type: Amounya Abia and Igba. Aerophone, on\nthe contrary, is a musical instrument that produces sound pri-\nmarily by causing a body of air to vibrate, without the use of\nstrings or membranes, and without the vibration of the instru-\nment itself adding considerably to the sound. Metallophone\nconsists of tuned metal bars, which are struck to make sounds\nusually with a mallet. The instrument has a single row of bars\ntuned to the distinctive pelog or slendro scale, or a subset of\nthem. The Western glockenspiel and vibraphone are also\nmetallophones. They have two rows of bars in an initiation of\nthe piano keyboard and are toned to the chromatic scale.\nFinally, resonant materials are those materials which are\ncaused to vibrate forcibly by striking one against another -\npercussion (see Figure 3).\nWood for Carving Religious Figurines\nAnaocha like other Igbo societies practiceAfrican Traditional\nReligion (ATR). This is exemplified in their continued use of\nwood to carve religious figurines. As noted by Kramer\n(2006), Africans use wood from birth till death. The abun-\ndance of works of wood may have been caused by the fact\nthat wood is readily available and easier to work on. Softwood\ntypes such as Akanta (Rauvolfia vomitoria), Ngwu (Alba\nfeminea), Akpu (C. pentandra), and Ube (Dacryodes edulis)\nare used by most wood carvers in Anaocha for carving figu-\nrines and other sacred objects such as Ikenga, Agwu, mas-\nquerade masks, and royal stools/drums. This aspect of wood\nusage in the area is very important because it affirms the\npeople's support for African cosmology and preference in\ncarved objects made with good wood. The woods for carving\npurposes in Anaocha are shown in Table 1 and Figure 4.\nIt should be noted that carved objects are admired based\non the beauty of the carved work. Inquiry about the quality of\nwood used comes to play only when the admirer wants to\nmake a purchase. This is to assure him or her of the durability\nof the carved work. Again, the final touch of the master\ncarver on the object represents his desire and love for\nperfection.\nWood for Fortification\nIn the ancient times, wooden materials such as Ogilisi\n(Newbouldia laevis) and palm fronds (E. guineensis) were\nused in making fences and gates of most compounds in Igbo\ncommunities. This is still obtainable in Anaocha LGA. Palm\nfronds, Ogilisi, and planks lumbered from palm trees are\nused to fortify family compounds of those that cannot afford\ncement blocks. Wood is also used for boundary demarcation\nof compounds, farmlands, villages, and towns (see Figure 5).\nWood for Casket Production\nRight from time immemorial, products from wood have been\nused in various forms to bury the dead. In many Igbo-\nspeaking communities and beyond, wood resources such as\nbamboo stems and banana leaves were used to bury people\nof diverse social classes. Presently, wood is put into a\nFigure 2. Wood used for architectural purposes.\n4 SAGE Open\nspecialized and constructive shape known as the casket, with\nthe sole purpose of burying the dead. Caskets are of different\nsizes, shapes, and patterns/designs, and are made from dif-\nferent types of wood such as Agbu (whitewood--Alstonia\nboonei), Obeche (Terminalia superba), Mansonia (Mansonia\naltissima), teak (Oworo)--Tectona grandis. According to\nour informants, five types of caskets are produced in\nAnaocha: up-high casket, six-corner casket, dome casket,\ntop-stone caskets, and concord caskets.\nThe Up-high casket after production does not require\npainting, rather fanny is applied as a decorative substance.\nThe six-corner casket is next in rank of quality to the up-high\ncasket, and all types of wood can be used for its production.\nThe dome casket is the most expensive type of casket in\nAnaocha because of the complex dome shape design carved\non top of the casket's cover. Two types of hardwood (Agbu\nand Mansonia) are used for its production. The top-stone\ncasket, on the contrary, derives its name from the grave stone\nfound on the top of the cover of the casket, whereas the con-\ncord casket is the most affordable casket among the study\ngroup. It is good looking and well designed, and quality\nwood types such as Agbu, Obeche, and Oworo are used for\nits production (see Figure 6).\nWood as a Source of Energy Supply\nAccording to Babanyara and Saleh (2010), fuelwood consti-\ntutes the main source of fuel for cooking, as more than 76%\nof Nigerians use fuelwood, leaving only 26% for cooking\ngas, kerosene, coal, and electricity. On the contrary, Sambo\nfuelwood are used by Nigerians for cooking and other\nFigure 4. Carved religious wooden figures.\nFigure 5. Wood used for fortification.\nTable 1.

Sources of fuelwood include\ndeadwoods, dry branches, twigs, wet/life woods, sawdust\nfrom wood, and charcoal extracted from wood. Users of fuel-\nwood in the study area include smiths, palm oil millers, cas-\nsava (garri) producers, and bakery industries, among others.\nWood extracts from trees such as Dialium guineense, Burkea\nafricana, Pentaclethra macrophylla, Cylicodiscus gabunen-\nsis, and Tamarindus indica are mostly used for fuelwood/\nenergy supply and as such are threatened by extinction due to\ntheir excessive exploitation (see Figure 7).\nWood as a bio-product can serve as a source of income\ngeneration to man. In Anaocha, wood resources such as fuel-\nwood (firewood), sawdust, and charcoal (extracted from\nwood) constitute major sources of income to most families\nthat depend on it to improve their standard of living.\nEthnographic sources revealed that fuelwood (firewood) and\nwood resources are highly demanded by most entrepreneurs,\nsuch as bread bakers, plastic companies, brick makers, garri\nproducers, smiths, and so forth, on daily basis in Anaocha\nand beyond. Mostly wood and wood sources (charcoal, saw-\ndust, etc.) are transported by wood vendors from rural areas\nto urban cities for sale and use. Monies generated from sale\nof wood resources are used in solving domestic problems\nsuch as payment of children's school fees, house rents, and\nfeeding, to mention but a few.\nWood for Household Furniture\nAnaocha traditional crafts reveal an understanding of the\nharmonious utilization of wood resources. Furniture pro-\nduced from wood sources in the study area included uphol-\nstery, cane chairs, basket, broom, mat, and mortar/pestle. All\nthese constitute household materials used for subsistence liv-\ning in the study area.\nOga tree provides major raw material for cane weaving,\nand cane crafts are produced in various sizes and shapes to\nserve different purposes. Its products include cane cupboard,\ncane bed, cane chair, cane basket, and cane mirror. Baskets,\non the contrary, are produced in large quantities, ranging\nfrom large to medium and small to extra small sizes serving\ndifferent purposes.\nscrapped off their leaves neatly. The sticks are tied strongly\ntogether with a twine and are ready for use. Brooms are\npackaged in bundles and are sold in the market. Palm leaves\nand coconut palm leaves can be used in the production of\ndifferent kinds of mats. Mats are used either for sleeping (a\nkind of bed), ornamental shrub, or for fencing compounds.\nMortar plays an important role as kitchen utensil. In\nAnaocha, mortar and pestle are too important to be missed\nout in any family, and this explains why it is among the items\na newly married lady takes to her husband's house. The\nobjects are used together for pounding of yam, cassava, and\npalm fruit, and for grinding pepper and other ingredients\nused in cooking soup and stew. Mortars and pestles are of\ndifferent sizes: Ikwe--big mortar, Odo--medium-sized mor-\ntar, and Okwa--small mortar. They have different design\npatterns and perform different functions in every household\nin Anaocha. Hardwood types such as Iroko (M. excelsa) and\nmahogany (A. africana) are used for making mortars and\npestles of various types. Outside the aforementioned types,\nthe people also carve utilitarian equipments like bowl for dif-\nferent purposes such as food bowl (Okwa nri), meat bowl\n(Okwa anu), kola nut bowl (Okwa oji), and axe handle\n(Anyuike).\nDiscussion: Implications of Wood\nConsumption in Anaocha LGA\nIn Anaocha, wood and wood products have socioeconomic,\npolitical, religious, and cultural implications. These are\nenshrined in the people's ways of life and exemplified in\ntheir norms, values, beliefs, and customs. Religiously, some\ntrees (Iroko, Ofor, Anunuebe, and Ogilisi) are perceived to be\nsacred because of the religious roles such trees play within\nthe locality as well as their perceived inherent supernatural\npowers. Trees, such as Iroko, coconut, and so forth, are\nlinked to reincarnation of certain individuals. It is a general\nbelief that a reincarnated individual buries his or her Iyi-uwa\n(a special kind of stone, which forms the link between an\nOgbanje and the spirit world) with which his or her\nFigure 6. Wooden casket.\nFigure 7. Woods displayed for sale.\n6 SAGE Open\nreincarnation was made possible under such trees. Iyi-uwa is\nan object from Igbo mythology that binds the spirit of a dead\nchild (known as Ogbanje) to the world, causing it to return\nand be born again by the same mother. Furthermore, coconut\ntree is associated with reproduction. This explains why\nAnaocha people bury the umbilical cord of a new born baby\nunder the tree upon its natural fall-off. Thus, the child owns\nthe tree upon maturity with the belief that as the coconuts are\nharvested, his or her offspring will be multiplied.\nTrees such as Ofor and Iroko are regarded as sacred; such\ntrees are perceived to be living sacrifice. Ethnographic\nsources revealed that white or red cloths are tied around the\ntree and that such cloth is often stained with blood of sacrifi-\ncial animals such as fowls, goats, cows, and so forth.\nFurthermore, the foot of the tree is decorated with broken\npieces of potsherds and stones that are arranged strategically.\nPrayers and libations are often done under such a tree which\nis often linked to a particular deity.\nWood types such as Iroko, Akanta, and Ngwu are used in\ncarving sacred objects such as masquerade heads, images of\ndeities (gods and goddesses), and religious musical instru-\nments such as drums, gongs, and flutes. This is because of\nthe belief that they are associated with Ala, the earth god-\ndess, and has connection to the supernatural beings or the\nspirit world that links the people with their ancestors and\nancestress. Thus, some trees are revered as demigods and\nattract lots of rituals, ceremonies, offerings of sacrifices,\nand dedications in the communities where they are found. In\nfact, sacred trees such as Iroko, Ngwu, and Ofor are installed\nas gods by most communities in Anaocha.\nWood and wood resources constitute diverse economic\nbenefits to the people of the study area. Trees such as Iroko,\nmahogany, and Obeche provide the people with timber mate-\nrials such as planks, plywood, and sawdust used by most\nwoodworkers in the area. Wood also provides raw materials\nfor building and construction of houses, shops, schools,\nchurches, furniture, and agricultural implements for farmers\nin the area. Wood products such as firewood (fuelwood),\ncharcoal extracted from wood, provide homes and industries\nwith alternative sources of energy.\nIn most homes in Anaocha, firewood performs several\nfunctions and purposes such as cooking, frying, roasting of\nfood stuffs, lighting, and warming of homes, whereas opera-\ntors of most local industries such as bread bakers, local wine\nbrewers, clay brick makers, wood carvers, and food vendors\nmake use of wood/wood products in large quantities. Also,\nwood products such as firewood and sawdust constitute\nmajor sources of income generation among the people.\nWood, in its own regard, provides the people with timber and\nlogs of wood used in the building and construction of lorry\ncarriages, trucks, canoes, boats, and bridges used in convey-\ning goods and services from rural to urban centers within and\nbeyond the local government. Economic trees, such as\nmango, guava, orange, pawpaw, pears of all species, coconut\ntrees, and so forth, serve as sources of food, revenue genera-\ntion, and are of medicinal values.\nCultural and sociopolitical values of wood are critical.\nWood products perform numerous functions in Anaocha cul-\ntural activities and political organizations. Ethnographic\nresources revealed the cultural and political significance and\nsymbolisms of some sacred woods such as Ofor stick\n(Detranium macrocapun) and the Ogilisi plant (N. laevis) in\nAnaocha. The Ofor stick, for instance, is a symbol of author-\nity and is held by the eldest in the family. The Ofor stick in\nthe hand of a titled man (Ozo or Nze) signifies and symbol-\nizes a staff of office, symbol of authority, justice, and upright-\nness. This implies that the Ozo title holder in Anaocha is both\nthe political and spiritual head of his people. The person in\ncustody of the Ofor is believed by his people to be a man of\nintegrity, trustworthiness, and dignity whose judgment is\nacceptable by all and sundry. On the contrary, it is a general\nbelief that whoever tells lies or judges wrongly could be\nstruck dead by the spirit inhabiting the Ofor. The Ogilisi tree\nfound in most shrines and palaces of paramount personalities\nin Anaocha is believed to be a special type of tree with spiri-\ntual potency.\nIt is noteworthy that wood types mostly harvested are the\nones readily available within the area as a free gift of nature,\nrather than from a tree plantation. Suffice it to say that some\nwood materials are more durable and stronger than others;\nhence, wood users prefer them to others. Wood types, such as\nmahogany, Iroko, Ngwu, and so forth, are more favored than\nAkpu wood. The above statement is in consonance with Njiti\nand Kemcha (2002) that wood species which do not essen-\ntially serve as a food source but burn well and smoke less are\nexploited for fuelwood, whereas some species which are\nknown to produce gradual and good flame are much more\npreferred. On the contrary, wood species that are dense and\nresistant to rot and insect attack are exploited for use in furni-\nture and construction works. It should be noted that wood\nusage will always be patronized in view of its values to the\npeople. Thus, rural dwellers tend to depend on wood for con-\nsumption and subsistent living, which over time would lead to\ndeforestation, and as such the impact of climate change would\nbe felt more within such areas. To avert such impending cri-\nsis, efforts should be geared toward wood conservation.\nWood Conservation Practices in Anaocha\nAccording to Eluyemi (2002, p. 3), conservation is \"the iden-\ntification, documentation (appropriate registration) and\nproper storage of cultural objects, whether in private hands\nor in museum.\" The obvious reason for proper conservation\nof cultural and natural objects (wood, wood resources, and\nwood products) is to keep them whole and safe for now and\nfor the future and to make them available for research and for\ninterpretation. Thus, the major objective of conservation or\npreservation is to keep the heritage in good condition, that is,\nto prevent damage or destruction from natural, chemical, and\nThe forefathers of the people already had their traditional\nways of preserving and conserving wood/wood products.\nOkonkwo et al. 7\nAnaocha people ofAnambra State conserve and preserve avail-\nable wood resources in their environment. There are two meth-\nods of wood conservation practiced inAnaocha: traditional and\nmodern methods. The traditional methods of wood conserva-\ntion are enshrined in the people's norms, values, beliefs, and\ncustoms exemplified in taboos, local laws, and sacred sanctions\nwhich have, over time, become the people's way of life. These\nmethods are effective in conserving trees, grooves, wood\nresources, and/or wood products. Trees such as Iroko and Ofor\nare perceived as sacred and as such people are prohibited from\nharvesting them for any purposes. However, in the event of a\nproposed developmental project around such a tree, consulta-\ntions to oracle are made and the final decision lies with the\nchief priest of the deity to which the tree is associated. The\nreason is that such sacred trees are regarded as \"demigods\" and\nare believed to be linking humanity to divinity. It is a general\nbelief among Anaocha people that defaulters might be pun-\nished by the gods, which may result to poor harvest of farm\nproducts, strange ailments, hardship, and even death.\nWood products such as religious figures (Ikenga and mas-\nquerade masks/objects) and a titled man's regalia (such as\nOzo's sitting stool, staff, etc.) are all conserved using taboos\nand sacred sanctions. For instance, noninitiates into mas-\nquerade cults are prohibited from touching carved masks,\nwhile women are not allowed to carry or sit on an Ozo's\nstool. These local laws and sacred sanctions help in instilling\nfear and respect for the objects, and as such, their values are\nheld in high esteem by the people. Such objects are protected\nand preserved from damage caused by humans.\nWet/life wood resources are preserved by allowing them\nto sun dry and are further preserved under a roof to prevent\ncontact with rain or water (which are agents of wood decay).\nSuch wood species are also suspended from touching the\nground where termites could easily attack them. Ethnographic\nsources revealed that used or spent engine oil or palm oil is\nused as a wood preservative to deter insect attack on timber\nmaterials as well as to protect them from adverse climatic/\nweather effects leading to breaking and cracking of wood\nsurfaces during the harmattan/dry season.\nThe modern method of wood preservation among the peo-\nple involves the use of chemicals such as insecticides and\npesticides (chemical formula such as Barrettine and\nGamaline, etc.). While those who can afford the cost make\nuse of these chemicals, others who cannot resort to tradi-\ntional methods of preserving wood, wood resources, and\nwood products. It is important to note here that the integra-\ntion of traditional and modern conservation/management\nsystems will no doubt move Anaocha wood management\nforward. Okpoko and Okonkwo (2005) noted that integrating\nmodern and traditional methods promises enormous advan-\ntages of sustainable conservation practices and methods.\nConclusion\nThis study has been able to bring to limelight aspects of\nwood consumption in Anaocha, ranging from architecture,\nmusical instruments, religious carvings, and fortification,\namong others. The study showed that wood is still the major\nsource of energy in rural areas and for the majority of urban\ndwellers. Wood is essentially obtained from the natural forest\nmore than from plantation. It is also a flourishing business in\nparts of Anaocha area of AnambraState due to their entrepre-\nneurship in baking business and other manufacturing indus-\ntries within the study area.\nWood is a bio-product that needs to be effectively man-\naged for the purpose of sustainability as well as for posterity;\nthus, wood consumption in Anaocha has different aspects\nand tells a lot about the people's socioeconomic, cultural,\nreligious, and political lifestyles. This portrays the fact that\nwood resources are used in all ramifications in the develop-\nment and growth of the people's everyday life activities,\nincluding the tangible and intangible aspects of their lives.\nFor this reason, mechanism should be put in place to ensure\nthat constant harvesting of wood does not lead to deforesta-\ntion in the area. The people should also be encouraged to\nmake use of other alternatives rather than relying solely on\nwood.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBabanyara, Y.
