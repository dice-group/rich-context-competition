    "abstract": "Abstract\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules that regulate nervous system physiology. ROS have been related to\nneural differentiation, neuritogenesis, and programmed cell death. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms\ninvolved in the regulation of ROS during neuronal development. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms by which\nROS are regulated during neuronal development and the implications of these molecules in this process. Primary cultures\nof cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) were used to address these issues. Our results show that during the first 3 days of\nCGN development in vitro (days in vitro; DIV), the levels of ROS increased, reaching a peak at 2 and 3 DIV under depolarizing\n(25 mM KCl) and nondepolarizing (5 mM KCl) conditions. Subsequently, under depolarizing conditions, the ROS levels\nmarkedly decreased, but in nondepolarizing conditions, the ROS levels increased gradually. This correlated with the\nextent of CGN maturation. Also, antioxidants and NADPH-oxidases (NOX) inhibitors reduced the expression of Tau\nand MAP2. On the other hand, the levels of glutathione markedly increased at 1 DIV. We inferred that the ROS increase\nat this time is critical for cell survival because glutathione depletion leads to axonal degeneration and CGN death only at 2\nDIV. During the first 3 DIV, NOX2 was upregulated and expressed in filopodia and growth cones, which correlated with the\nhydrogen peroxide (H2\n) distribution in the cell. Finally, NOX2 KO CGN showed shorter neurites than wild-type CGN.\nTaken together, these results suggest that the regulation of ROS is critical during the early stages of CGN development.\n",

A primary aim of neurobiology is\nto unravel the molecular mechanisms that control neur-\nonal development that is essential for the correct assem-\nbly of neuronal networks (Barnes and Polleux, 2009).\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated\nin several pathological conditions, but they have also\nemerged as endogenous modulators of numerous physio-\nlogical functions.

The variety of ROS functions in the CNS\nis wide ranging from cell proliferation to cell death.\nInterestingly, several studies have shown that the mech-\nanism that governs the physiological action of ROS may\nbe similar to those underlying their pathological actions.\nThus, studies pertaining to ROS actions during neuronal\ndevelopment may contribute to the understanding of the\ndevelopment and the disease of the nervous system.\nNADPH-oxidases (NOX) family is one of the main\nROS forming complexes in neurons. The NOX family\ncomprises seven homologues (NOX 1-5 and DUOX\n1-2) that produce superoxide anion and H2\nfrom\nmolecular oxygen. NOX enzymes are widely expressed\nin most cell types, including neurons and glial cells\nAlthough the physiological functions of NOX enzymes\nin the nervous system are largely unknown, studies have\nshown that NOX might be involved in some processes\nsuch as the early phase of the long-term potentiation in\nhippocampus (Kishida et al., 2006) and neurogenesis and\nneuronal maturation.\nThe members of the NOX family can be activated by\nseveral regulators of nervous system development, includ-\ning growth factors (neurotrophins and fibroblast growth\nfactor [FGF]), cytokines, and the activation of N-methyl-\nD-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), among others\nstudies in vitro have shown that ROS produced by NOX\ninduce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (Suzukawa\n(Kennedy et al., 2010). Furthermore, it has been shown\nthat NOX2 participates in the neurogenesis in the sub-\nventricular zone (Le Belle et al., 2011), as well as in the\nregulation of the actin cytoskeletal dynamics of axonal\ngrowth cones in Aplysia neurons (Munnamalai et al.,\n2014). In the developing cerebellum, we recently showed\nthat a transient increase of ROS produced by NOX seems\nto be involved in the cerebellar foliation and motor\nfunction (Coyoy et al., 2013). In view of this, the\ndeveloping cerebellar cortex constitutes a suitable model\nfor studying the mechanisms by which ROS regulate\nneuronal development.\nThe intracellular ROS levels depend not only on\nthe ROS sources but also on the antioxidant systems in\nthe cells. In this regard, the glutathione is a major anti-\noxidant system in the nervous system (Dringen, 2000).\nGlutathione scavenges a variety of ROS and is an\nobligated cosubstrate of glutathione peroxidase, which\nis a major mechanism of defense against H2\n(Franco\nchanges in the reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized gluta-\nthione (GSSG) ratio are considered important determin-\nants in the redox environment and redox signaling in the\nand Cidlowski, 2012). Therefore, the actions exerted by\nROS during nervous system development may be influ-\nenced by the glutathione antioxidant system.\nNot much information is available on the glutathione\nlevels during cerebellar development, and the experimen-\ntal evidence is rather controversial. Rice and Russo-\nMenna (1998) reported a sudden increase in glutathione\nfrom postnatal day 12 that remianed high until the adult.\nHowever, other study indicates that the levels of glutathi-\none transiently increase during the first week and then\nvalues return to basal levels, remaining relatively low\nduring the subsequent stages of cerebellar development\nAlthough some studies have established a physio-\nlogical role of ROS during nervous system development,\nlittle is known about the interdependence of ROS\nand NOX enzymes during neuronal development.\nFurthermore, the mechanisms through which ROS are\nregulated in the developing neurons remain largely\nunknown. In this study, we aim to determine the physio-\nlogical role of ROS in neuronal development of cerebellar\ngranule neurons (CGN) and evaluate the role of\nNOX and glutathione in the regulation of ROS during\nthis process. To address these issues, we employed\ncultured CGN that represents a model of study that\nrecapitulates many of the stages of the development of\nthe CGN in the cerebellar cortex in vivo. (Powell et al.,\ntotic CGN precursors generate neurites and migrate to\nthe internal granule layer, where they develop dendrites\nand establish synaptic contacts with mossy fibers (Solecki\net al., 2006). The presynaptic inputs at this stage seem to\nplay a key role in the maturation and survival of CGN.\nThe state of depolarization of CGN influences their sur-\nvival (Gallo et al., 1987), the activation of the enzymes\ninvolved in the synthesis of cell-specific neurotransmitters\n2 ASN Neuro\n(Caballero-Benitez et al., 2004), and their dendritic\npruning and maturation (Shalizi et al., 2006; Ramos\nHere, we determined the changes in the basal levels\nof ROS in CGN cultures under depolarizing and nonde-\npolarizing conditions throughout CGN development, as\nwell as their effects on CGN maturation. To elucidate the\nrole of glutathione in the developing CGN, we examined\nthe outcome of glutathione depletion on cell viability and\naxonal integrity. Subsequently, we measured the expres-\nsion of NOX2 at different stages of CGN development\nand its localization in these neurons. We also explored\nthe specific production of H2\nin growth cones and filo-\npodia. Finally, we evaluated the physiological relevance\nof ROS, glutathione, and NOX2 during CGN\nneuritogenesis.\nMaterials and Methods\nMaterials\nFetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from\nGibco\u00d5 (Grand Island, NY, USA).

All efforts were made to min-\nimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of ani-\nmals used.\nCGN cultures were prepared from postnatal Day 8\nWistar rats and from postnatal Day 7 NOX2\u00c0/\u00c0 and\nwild-type mice as previously described (Moran and\nPatel, 1989). CGN were plated at a density of\nwith poly-L-lysine (5 mg/mL). Culture medium contained\nbasal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-\ninactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 25 mM\nKCl, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin.\nCells were maintained under these conditions between\n0 and 8 days in vitro (DIV). Culture dishes were incubated\nTo prevent the development of nonneuronal cells, cyto-\nsine arabinoside (10 mM) was added 24 hr after seeding.\nAt the end of the preparation, CGN cultures contained\napproximately 95% neurons. The colonies of NOX2\nwere purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar\nHarbor, ME, USA) and bred in our Institute.\nCell Viability\nCGN were incubated with calcein (10 mM) and propidium\nphotographed in a fluorescence microscope using filters\nwith the following characteristics: excitation filter wave-\nlength/dichromatic mirror cut-on wavelength/barrier\n590 nm for calcein and propidium iodide, respectively.\nSubsequent analysis involved the determination of immu-\nnopositive cells from at least two different images for each\ncondition.

Cells were washed twice with Locke\nHEPES) and then incubated with 3.2 mM of dihydroethi-\ndium for 35 min. After that, cells were washed twice with\nLocke medium, and images were acquired in an epifluor-\nescence microscope using a filter with the following\ncharacteristics: excitation filter wavelength/dichromatic\nmirror cut-on wavelength/barrier filter wavelength of\nwere acquired, one in phase contrast and the other in\nfluorescence. Fluorescence measurements of the ethidium\ncation (E\u00fe), which is the product of the oxidation of\ndihydroethidium, were performed tracing a region of\ninterest (ROI) in the soma of 15 cells. These ROI were\nconsidered in the fluorescence image, and the mean gray\nintensity values were averaged. The backgrounds of two\ndifferent fields were subtracted from the fluorescence\nvalues of each measured cell. At least two different\nimages of each condition were evaluated. We measure\nthe fluorescence of 15 cells per photograph, and the aver-\nage of four wells per experiment was considered as n \u00bc 1.\nResults are expressed as absolute values, or data were\nnormalized with respect to 2 DIV.\nMeasurement of Glutathione Content\nGlutathione was assayed using enzymatic recycling\nfrom 0 to 5 DIV. Cells were washed in PBS and sonicated\nKPE (0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer with 5 mM\nEDTA disodium salt, pH 7.5). Next, samples were\nmixed with equal volumes of DTNB and glutathione\nreductase, after which 30 s b-NADPH was added.\nImmediately, kinetic measurements of the absorbance\nAbsorbance recordings and the injection of solutions\nwere performed in the microplate reader Synergy HT\n(BioTek Instruments, USA). To determine GSSG levels,\nthe samples were preincubated with 2.5% vinylpyridine\nfor 60 min and neutralized with triethanolamine prior\nto kinetic measurement. Glutathione and GSSG standard\ncurves were prepared to calculate the actual concentra-\ntion in the sample. GSH was calculated from the subtrac-\ntion of GSSG from the total glutathione.\nWestern Blot\nCGN were grown on 60 cm culture dishes from 0 to\n3 DIV in presence or absence of the antioxidants\n24 hr treatments at the indicated times. Cells were\nwashed twice in ice-cold PBS and homogenized in lysis\nSDS, and complete protease inhibitors, pH 7.4). The\nprotein concentration of cellular homogenates was deter-\nmined by using the Lowry method. A total of 60 mg of\nsoluble protein per lane was loaded on SDS-PAGE and\nelectrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)\nmembranes which were blocked with fat-free milk (5%\nin Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween 20 (TTBS) buffer\npH 7.5]) and incubated overnight at 4C with the follow-\nanti-MAP2.\nMeasurement of NAPDH-Oxidase Activity\nin Living Cells\nThe NAPDH-oxidase activity was determined by\nextracellular superoxide anion production that was mea-\nsured by the reduction of cytochrome c. CGN were\nseeded during different days in the same multiwell plate;\ncells were washed twice with Locke medium and then\nwere incubated with 100 ml of Locke media containing\nCytochrome c reduction absorbance (550 nm) was\nrecorded at 37C in the microplate reader Synergy HT.\nThe amount of superoxide anion released was calculated\nusing an extinction coefficient of 21 mM\u00c01 cm\u00c01. It was\nconsidered 300 mm as the distance that occupies a volume\nof 100 ml in a well plus the base of the plate.\nQuantitative Real-Time Reverse-Transcription\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)\nTotal RNA was extracted from CGN grown in depolar-\nizing conditions from 0 to 5 DIV using Trizol Reagent\n4 ASN Neuro\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA qual-\nity was assessed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis\nand with NanoDro p2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo\nScientific, USA). One mg of total RNA from each\nsample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using\nM-MVL Reverse Transcriptase with an oligo (dT)12-18\nprimer. One microgram of cDNA was used to determine\nthe relative gene expression, which was performed in a\nthermal cycler Rotor-gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science),\nusing TaqMan Universal Master Mix 2X and TaqMan\nApplied Biosystems\u00d5, USA). The relative level of ampli-\nfied mRNA was normalized to the expression of the\nhousekeeping gene GAPDH. The average Ct value of\nthe endogenous control (GAPDH) for every sample was\nsubtracted from the Ct value for each target gene, result-\ning in the \u00c1CT\nvalue. Fold change was calculated using\nthe 2\u00c0\u00c1\u00c1CT method where the comparative cycle thresh-\nold (\u00c1\u00c1CT\n) was defined as the difference between \u00c1CT\nof\n1 to 5 DIV minus \u00c1CT\nof the DIV in which the expres-\nsion reached its maximum.\nImmunocytochemistry\nwere grown onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides from 0\nto 3 DIV. Cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed with\n4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Subsequently, cells\nwere blocked and permeabilized overnight at 4C in\nblocking solution (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100\nand 10% normal goat serum) and then were incubated\nantibodies. The primary antibody anti-NOX2 was\ndetected with an Alexa Fluor\u00d5 488 goat anti-Rabbit\nIgG (H\u00feL) secondary antibody (1:1000) incubated for\n2 hr at room temperature. The primary antibody anti-\nTau was detected with a DyLight 594 goat anti-Mouse\nIgG (H\u00feL) secondary antibody (1:1000) incubated for\n2 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted\nusing Vectashield mounting media with DAPI. Images\nwere captured in the FV10i-LIV confocal microscope\n(Olympus, USA). Coverslips incubated without primary\nantibody or with 1:50 (10 mg/ml) normal rabbit IgG\nshowed no staining. The staining for Tau detection did\nnot affect the detection of NOX2 and vice versa.\nMeasurements of H2\nLocalization in Living Cells\nCGN were transfected before plating with 5 mg of\nHyPer-cyto (Evrogen, Rusia), using the Nucleofector\nprogram C-13. CGN were visualized in a microscope\nAxiovert 200 M (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Germany) with\na Lambda DG-4 system (Sutter Instrument, USA) and\na PECON system (PECON, Germany) for cell culture\nwas used to visualize the cells. HyPer fluorescence was\nacquired in two different channels: CH1 (excitation\nexpressed as the ratio of CH1 to CH2 minus their\nrespective backgrounds. A higher index corresponds\nto higher levels of H2\n. In order to determine the\nregions where the levels of H2\nwere higher, an ROI\nwas traced, and the mean fluorescence intensity was\nregistered during different photograms; the average of\nthese points was normalized with the average of the\nfluorescence in the soma. The measurements were\nonly considered in the photograms where the ROI\nwas in focus. The measurement of each structure rep-\nresents n \u00bc 1. The image analysis was performed in\nAxonal Morphology\nCGN were labeled with PKH67 in a proportion of\nPKH67 is a dye used for membrane labeling, which\nis composed by a green fluorescent dye with long ali-\nphatic tales that intercalates into lipid regions of the\nmembranes (Wallace et al., 2008). Cells were treated\nwith BSO (100 mM) at the time of plating and, in some\nexperiments, the cells were treated with Euk-134\n(10 mM) 24 hr after plating. Cells were visualized in a\nfluorescence microscope and photographed. The\nmorphology of the axons was classified into three dif-\nferent categories that were as follows: unaltered, with\nmultiple spheroids, and collapsed. The proportion of\nneurons categorized into these three types of morphol-\nogies was determined per experiment and averaged in\nindependent experiments.\nAxonal Growth\nCGN were labeled before plated with 3 mM PKH67 at\nroom temperature for 5 min. An equal volume of 1%\nBSA in PBS was then added, and the cells were further\nincubated for 1 min to stop the staining reaction. The\nlabeled cells were then centrifuged at 400 g for 8 min at\nroom temperature and resuspended in culture medium in\nlabeled cells. The neurites were measured manually, and\nonly those neurites longer than the cell diameter and that\ndid not show contacts with other neurites were con-\nsidered; in the case of bipolar CGN, only the longest\nneurite was considered. The measurement of each neurite\nrepresents n \u00bc 1. The measurements were made in Image J\nwith the plugin Neuron J.\nOlgui\n\u00b4n-Albuerne and Mora\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was done by using SigmaPlot 12.1\nsoftware. Data are expressed as means \u00c6 SEM, unless\notherwise indicated. Pairwise comparison within multiple\ngroups was done by analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol-\nlowed by the Holm\u00adSidak post hoc test; in some cases,\nANOVA nonparametric test was performed. The statis-\ntical significance in the comparisons between two groups\nwas determined by the Student's t test and by the Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U test. For the time course results, a paired t test\nwas used; p values less than 0.05 were considered statis-\ntically significant.\nResults\nThe Levels of ROS Are Differentially Regulated\nDuring CGN Development\nIn order to determine the basal levels of ROS throughout\nCGN development, we cultured CGN in depolarizing\n(25 mM KCl) and nondepolarizing (5 mM KCl) concen-\ntrations of potassium chloride. This enabled us to com-\npare two conditions of neuronal development in vitro\nwhere neurons under depolarizing conditions develop\nnormally, while those in nondepolarizing conditions\nmature only partially and died by 8 DIV in a ROS-depen-\ndent manner (Schulz et al., 1996). Under these condi-\ntions, we measured the cell viability and the metabolic\nactivity of CGN during the first 5 DIV in order to deter-\nmine the time at which cell survival is compromised\nduring CGN development. In agreement with Gallo\net al. (1987) and others, CGN survival, measured as cal-\ncein-propidium iodide incorporation, was dependent on\nthe state of depolarization after 3 DIV. Figure 1 shows\nthat when CGN were cultured in nondepolarizing condi-\ntions, the cell viability diminished from 4 DIV, while in\ndepolarizing conditions, the cell viability remained unal-\ntered (Figure 1(a) and (b)). On the other hand, the meta-\nbolic activity, measured as MTT transformation, was\nreduced by 30% at 5 DIV in nondepolarizing conditions\n(Figure 1(c)). In contrast, the metabolic activity of CGN\ngrown in depolarizing conditions showed a sustained\nincrease during the first 5 DIV (Figure 1(c)).\nWe also evaluated the basal levels of ROS by the oxi-\ndation of dihydroethidium in depolarizing and nondepo-\nlarizing conditions during the first 5 DIV (Figure 1(d)).\nWhen CGN were cultured in depolarizing conditions, the\nlevels of ROS increased steadily over time from 0 to 1\nlevels reached at 2 DIV were sustained until 3 DIV\n(Figure 1(e) and (f)). Subsequently, the levels of ROS\ndecreased to similar values to those found at 1 DIV\n(Figure 1(e)). Then, the levels of ROS remained low\nuntil 8 DIV (Figure 1(f)). On the other hand, when\nCGN were cultured in nondepolarizing conditions, the\nlevels of ROS were similar to those observed in depolar-\nizing conditions from 1 to 3 DIV (Figure 1(e)); however,\nat 4 and 5 DIV, the levels of ROS increased gradually\n(Figure 1(e)). Thus, under these conditions, ROS levels\nshow two distinct phases: the first phase, from 0 to 3 DIV,\nwhich is independent of the state of depolarization, and a\nsecond phase, after 3 DIV, which is dependent on the\nstate of depolarization.\nIncreased Glutathione Levels Are Required for CGN\nSurvival During Early Development\nThe levels of ROS in the cell are determined by the equi-\nlibrium between the production of ROS and the levels\nand activity of the antioxidants (Halliwell, 2009).\nAmong the numerous antioxidants, we evaluated the\nglutathione system that is one of the most relevant anti-\noxidant systems in neurons. Moreover, it has been\nreported glutathione content changes during the cerebel-\nlar cortex development (Nanda et al., 1996; Rice and\nRusso-Menna, 1998). Thereby, in order to evaluate a\npossible relationship between glutathione and ROS\nlevels throughout CGN development, we estimated the\nlevels of GSH and GSSG throughout CGN development\nin depolarizing and nondepolarizing conditions. Figure\n2(a) shows that when CGN were grown in depolarizing\nconditions, the GSH content increased during the first 2\nDIV. It is important to note that the most significant\nincrease was recorded between 0 and 1 DIV ($90%)\nthat was followed by a slight increase of 10% between\n1 and 2 DIV, which persisted until 5 DIV. At 8 DIV, the\nlevels of GSH significantly decreased to values similar to\nthose observed at 0 DIV (Figure 2(b)). When cells were\ngrown in nondepolarizing conditions, the increase in the\nlevels of GSH was similar to that in depolarizing condi-\ntions from 0 to 2 DIV; however, after 3 DIV, the level of\nGSH decreased significantly in CGN under nondepolar-\nizing conditions at 5 DIV (Figure 2(a)). Interestingly, the\nlevel of GSSG did not change throughout the different\nstages of CGN development, and no significant difference\nwas observed between depolarized and nondepolarized\ncells (Figure 2(a).\nConsidering that the levels of glutathione increase in\ncorrespondence with ROS, we hypothesized that gluta-\nthione might be involved in the actions of ROS during\nthe first 3 DIV. This is further supported by previous\nstudies showing that high levels of ROS induce cell\ndeath in these cells. It is possible that the observed\ndecrease in glutathione content in CGN maintained in\nnondepolarizing conditions during 3 DIV could either\nbe a cause or the result of the cell death observed at this\ntime. In this regard, it has been shown that glutathione\ndepletion triggers cell death and that glutathione deple-\ntion occurs during the cell death process (Franco and\n6 ASN Neuro\nBased on these evidences, we evaluated the role of\nglutathione in CGN survival by reducing the glutathione\ncontent in CGN cultures treated during the last 24 hr or\n48 hr of culture with BSO, an inhibitor of g-glutamylcys-\nteine synthetase, which is the first and rate-limiting\nenzyme for the biosynthesis of glutathione. Figure 2(c)\nand Supplementary Figure 1 show that BSO treatment\nfor 48 hr, markedly decreased GSH content at 2, 3, 5,\nand 8 DIV. Similarly, GSSG content were also signifi-\ncantly reduced by BSO at all ages measured. When cell\nviability was evaluated, we found that BSO did not affect\nCGN survival at any time when cultures were treated\nduring the last 24 hr (Figure 2(d); however, when cultures\nwere treated for 48 hr, we observed a significant complete\nreduction of cell viability in CGN cultures at 2 DIV\n(Figure 2(e). The observed effect of BSO was completely\nprevented by the antioxidant Euk-134 (Figure 2(f) and\n(g)), suggesting that cell death induced by BSO at 2\nDIV is due to an oxidative stress induced by glutathione\nreduction. Interestingly, under these conditions, cell\nviability was not affected in cultures of 3 to 8 DIV.\nThese results indicate that CGN vulnerability to cell\ndeath related to oxidative stress is present only at 2\nDIV, when CGN are in the process of maturation. The\nfact that the levels of glutathione were also completely\ndiminished in CGN treated with BSO plus Euk-134 at 2\nDIV (Figure 3(c)), a condition that does not affect cell\nviability, indicates that glutathione estimation was not\naffected by the antioxidant nor by the low protein content\ninduced by the cell death process.

In addition, from 3 to 8\nDIV, ROS are no longer required for cell maturation, but\nthe lack of trophic influences (nondepolarizing condi-\ntions) could induce some mechanisms leading to an\nincrease in ROS levels and then to cell death.\nROS Promote CGN Development\nPrevious studies suggest that ROS regulate some events\nof the nervous system development (Tsatmali et al., 2006;\n2013). In order to evaluate the relevance of ROS during\nCGN development, we tested the effect of two antioxi-\ndants, the mimetic of glutathione peroxidase Ebselen\n(Parnham and Kindt, 1984) and the mimetic of\nsuperoxide dismutase and catalase Euk-134 (Baker\net al., 1998), as well as two general inhibitors of\nexpression of Tau and MAP2 during CGN development.\nThe expressions of these proteins are indicators of neur-\nonal maturation (Dehmelt and Halpain, 2004). First, we\ndetermined the relative levels of Tau and MAP2 from 0 to\n3 DIV, and, as expected, we found a correlation between\nthe levels of these two proteins and the CGN develop-\nment (Figure 3(a)). In both cases, the highest increase was\nbetween 1 and 2 DIV. When CGN were treated with\non the levels of Tau and MAP2 were observed; however,\nAEBSF and apocynin significantly diminished the levels\nof Tau by 50%, while AEBSF, but not apocynin treat-\nment, significantly diminished the levels of MAP2 by\n70% (Figure 3(b)). When CGN were treated during\n24 hr at 1 DIV, the antioxidants had no effect on the\nlevels of Tau, but diminished MAP2 levels by 30%. In\ncontrast, both AEBSF and apocynin significantly\nreduced the expression of Tau and MAP2 by 60% and\n30%, respectively (Figure 3(c)). Finally, when CGN were\ntreated from 2 to 3 DIV, none of the treatments had any\neffect in the levels of Tau and MAP2 (Figure 3(d)).\nNADPH Oxidase Activity and the Expression\nof NOX Homologues Change During CGN\nDevelopment\nIt has been shown previously that NOX enzymes are\nmajor source of ROS in several cell types (Bedard and\ninhibitors interfere with CGN maturation, we hypothe-\nsized that members of the NOX family could be mediat-\ning ROS production during CGN development. In order\nto determine the relevance of ROS producing enzymes in\ndeveloping CGN, we measured the NOX activity in cul-\ntured CGN by determining the extracellular reduction of\ncytochrome c by superoxide anion produced by NOX\n(Figure 4(a)). In CGN grown under depolarizing condi-\ntions, the NOX activity gradually increased between 1 to\n3 DIV ($50%) and then the activity decreased to levels\nclose to those found at 2 DIV, which is similar to the\nROS production observed from 1 to 5 DIV (Figure 1(e)).\nTo evaluate the importance of some NOX homologues\nin the CGN development, we determined the expression of\nNOX1 and NOX2 in CGN cultured in depolarizing condi-\ntions from 0 to 5 DIV by using quantitative real-time RT-\nPCR (Figure 4(b) to (e)). Under these conditions, we found\nthat NOX1 and NOX2 showed the lowest expression at 0\nDIV. NOX1 reached the highest expression at 1 DIV and\nafterwards it gradually decreased (Figure 4(b)). NOX2 pre-\nsented a marked increase from 1 to 2 DIV and a minor\nincrement between 2 and 3 DIV. Afterwards, the levels of\nNOX2 diminished abruptly from 3 to 4 DIV (Figure 4(c)).\nWhen the relative mRNA expression of NOX1 and NOX2\nwere compared, we observed a higher abundance of NOX2\nthan NOX1 at both 1 and 3 DIV (Figure 4(d) and (e)).\nLocalization in Developing CGN\nSome studies have highlighted the importance of the com-\npartmentalization of ROS production in cells (Mishina\net al., 2011), which may allow ROS to activate particular\nredox signaling events in specific regions of the cells\n(Ushio-Fukai, 2009). Accordingly, we studied the local-\nization of NOX2 in developing CGN cultured in depolar-\nizing conditions, based on the finding that this is one of\nthe most abundant homologues in CGN (Figure 4(d) and\n(e)). Supplementary Figure 2 shows an immunocyto-\nchemistry study at normal density, in which the mark\nof NOX2 is localized in the axons, but no details of the\nspecific location of the label can be appreciated.\nTherefore, the immunolocalization of NOX2 was carried\nout in cultures with a lower density than in the rest of the\nexperiments in order to visualize the NOX2-positive\nstructures. This condition did not affect the cell survival\n(data not shown). Figure 5 shows that NOX2 was mostly\ndistributed in neurites, and it was closely associated with\nthe growth cones at 0 and 3 DIV. Particularly, at 0 DIV,\nNOX2 was preferentially concentrated in the growth\ncones of most developing neurites (Figure 5(a)), as well\nas in some protrusion. In the more advanced stage of\ndevelopment (3 DIV), NOX2 was enriched in filopodia,\naxonal varicosities, and growth cones (Figure 5(b)); thus\nsuggesting that ROS might be produced in specific regions\nof the developing neurons. The distribution of Tau, a\nmarker of early neurites, showed a close correlation with\nNOX2 labeling, particularly at 3 DIV (Figure 5).\nSeveral studies have shown that ROS are produced in\naxonal growth cones during axonal outgrowth and\nOlgui\n\u00b4n-Albuerne and Mora\nFigure 4.

At this time, ROS reach their maximum\nlevels, and the plasmid HyPer also reaches its maximum\nexpression.\nFigure 6(a) to (f) show that, although basal level of\nwas present in all the neuronal structures, there is\na clear difference in H2\nlevels between the soma and the\naxon and dendrites. H2\nis evenly distributed in the\nsoma, and the levels are relatively low (Figure 6(a), (c),\nand (e)). The levels of H2\nin the soma did not change\nwith time under basal conditions, but the fluorescent\nsignal increased when cells were treated with exogenous\n(Supplementary Figure 3(a) to (d) and\nSupplementary videos 16\u00ad17). In contrast, the distribu-\ntion of the H2\nalong the axon shaft was variable under\nbasal conditions; in some areas, the concentration was\nslightly lower than those observed in the soma, while\nsome other areas showed relatively higher H2\nlevels\nthan in the soma. In the regions where no filopodia or\nvaricosities are presented, the average level of H2\nwas\napproximately equal to the values recorded in the soma\n(Figure 6(a) to (f)). Interestingly, the axonal zones showing\nhigh levels of H2\ncorresponded to regions with high\ngrowing or remodeling activity, such as axonal growth\ncones and filopodial regions (Figure 6(b) to (d) and (f)).\nIn all cases, these zones showed H2\nlevels that doubled\nthe levels detected in the soma or other regions of the axon\n(Figure 6(h)). We also observed that, regardless of the\nmagnitude of movement in the axonal growth cones,\nthese regions always showed high levels of H2\n(Supplementary videos 6 to 9). High levels of H2\nwere\nalso found in dendritic growth cones (Figure 6(a), (c), and\n(h)). Not all the dynamic regions corresponded to high\nlevels of H2\n, but also in the varicosities (Figure 6(d)\nand (h)). The relative levels of H2\nin the different regions\nof the axon are indicated in Table 1.\nAs mentioned, high levels of H2\nare localized in the\nregions of the axon shaft where filopodia are located\n(Figure 6(f) to (h)); this was more prominent in regions\nwhere filopodia are constantly remodeling (dynamic\nzones). In these regions, we found clear variations in\nlevels that are restrained to microdomains of the\naxon shaft where filopodia are growing and retracting. It\nwas generally observed an increase in H2\nlevels\nimmediately before the filopodia formation, which\nreached its peak during the process and then dropped\nto the basal value at the end of the process. In certain\ncases, high levels were found inside the filopodia, par-\nticularly in situations when filopodia were very motile\nor other protrusions were formed in the filopodia\n(Figure 6(g) and (i)). These findings are illustrated in\nFigure 6(g), in which serial images of the dynamic zone\nare shown.\nThe observed changes in H2\nlevels occurred in a\ntime scale of minutes (such as in the case of axonal\ngrowth cones, the axon, the soma, and varicosities) or\nin a range of seconds (such as in the case of dendritic\ngrowth cones, dynamic zones, and filopodia).\nSupplementary Figure 3(e) and (f) show that although\nlevels are continuously fluctuating during the\nperiod registered, the levels of H2\nare always relatively\nhigh. Each image presented in this study has its corres-\nponded supplementary video (see Supplementary videos\n1\u00ad6) . The scales bars of Figure 6(e) and (f) are different\nthan in Supplementary Figure 3(c) and (f) in order to\nallow a proper measurement of the ratio during the\nperfusion.\nGlutathione Maintains Axonal Integrity During the\nEarly Development of CGN\nHigh levels of ROS have been associated with an\nalteration of cell physiology and structural damage that\nleads to cell death (Ryter et al., 2007). Also, as we men-\ntioned above, glutathione is a major antioxidant system\nin neurons. Thus, we evaluated the effect of glutathione\ndepletion by BSO treatment in the structural integrity\nlevels of CGN axons. To achieve this, we\nvisualized a partial population of CGN stained with\nPKH67 dye, which allowed us to study individual axons\n(Supplementary Figure 4). Figure 7(a) shows that 2 DIV\nCGN treated with BSO during 42 hr show a clear alter-\nation in the axonal structure. Some cells show axons with\nmultiple spheroid-like structures (Figure 7(b)). In other\ncells, these structures seem to increase in size and number\nleading to a collapse-like appearance of the axon. No\nevident alteration in the structure of the somas was\ndetected. The observed effects of BSO are mediated by\nROS because the presence of the antioxidant Euk-134\ncompletely prevented the mentioned alterations\n(Figure 7(a) and (b)). The quantification of the morpho-\nlogical alteration induced by BSO is shown in Figure 7(c).\nAbout 40% of the BSO-treated cells showed a collapsed-\nlike axon and 50% corresponded to CGN with little spher-\noid-like structures. Also, about 10% of the cells with\nspheroid-like structures were not rescued by Euk-134,\nand no collapsed-like axons were observed in the presence\nof the antioxidant, suggesting that the formation of the\nsmall spheroids precede the formation of the collapsed-\nlike axons and that neurons show different susceptibility\nto glutathione depletion. When CGN transfected with the\nplasmid HyPer were treated with BSO for 42hr, we found\nthat practically all the spheroid-like structures contained\nhigh levels of H2\n, which was more evident in the col-\nlapsed-like axons. No evident increment in H2\nlevels\nwas detected in the somas (Figure 7(d) and\nSupplementary videos 10\u00ad15). We also observed that\naxonal continuity was not lost in the collapsed-like\naxons, as it was possible to observe the continuity of the\naxons in neurons transfected with HyPer (data not shown).\nis produced in specific regions of developing CGN.

To\naddress this, we measured the neurite outgrowth and\nROS levels in CGN obtained from NOX2 KO and\nwild-type mice (Figure 8). Under these conditions, we\nfound no apparent differences in wild-type and NOX2\nKO CGN in the phase contrast images at 1 and 2 DIV\n(Figure 8(c)). When CGN were stained with PKH67\nand the neurites were measured, we found that CGN\nneurites from wild-type mouse showed a consistent\ngrowth that was markedly increased by about 3 times\nfrom 1 to 2 DIV (Figure 8(a) and (b)). In contrast, the\nneurite outgrowth of NOX2 KO CGN was about 25%\n(at 1 DIV) and 20% (at 2 DIV) lesser than that\nobserved in CGN from wild-type animals (Figure\n8(a) and (b)). When we measured the levels of ROS\nin wild-type and NOX2 KO CGN, we found that\nROS levels increased by twofold from 1 DIV to 2\nDIV (Figure 8(c) to (e)). When we compared the\nlevels of ROS between wild-type and NOX2 KO\nCGN at 1 and 2 DIV, no differences were found\n(Figure 8(f)).\nFigure 6. Continued.\nDiscussion\nROS and NOX During CGN Development\nIn this study, we found that ROS production is regulated\nthroughout CGN development. In this regard, we pro-\npose that CGN development could be divided into two\ndistinct phases. In the first phase, ROS increase during\nthe first 2 DIV and remain high until 3 DIV, which is\nindependent of the state of depolarization. In the second\nphase, the levels of ROS are dependent on the state of\ndepolarization; in depolarizing conditions, ROS levels\ndiminish at 4 DIV and then remain low during the sub-\nsequent days, while in nondepolarizing conditions, ROS\nlevels continue increasing at 4 and 5 DIV (Figure 9(a) and\n(b)). During these two phases, CGN undergo different\ndevelopmental processes. During the first phase, CGN\ninitiate the biochemical (Gallo et al., 1987) and morpho-\nlogical (Powell et al., 1997) processes of maturation, and\nat 3 DIV, most CGN have already developed the axon\nand multiple short dendrites (de la Torre-Ubieta et al.,\n2010). The second phase is coincident with a dependence\nof CGN survival on depolarization (Gallo et al., 1987)\nand dendrite maturation (Shalizi et al., 2006; Ramos\nOur results show that, in spite of the high levels of\nROS observed at 2 and 3 DIV, CGN viability is not\ncompromised regardless the state of depolarization. In\ncontrast, during the second phase, our data show a cor-\nrelation between low ROS levels and CGN survival in\ndepolarizing conditions, but in nondepolarizing condi-\ntions, high ROS levels are associated with a reduction\nof the metabolic activity and cell survival (Figure 9(a)\nand (b)). In this regard, we have previously shown that\nROS could be signals that trigger the process of apoptotic\ncell death of CGN at 8 DIV when CGN are switched\nfrom a depolarizing condition to a nondepolarizing\ncondition (Ramiro-Cortes and Moran, 2009; Ramiro-\nCortes et al., 2011). Together, these results suggest\nthat the regulation of ROS during CGN development\nmay be critical for the survival of CGN during the\nsecond phase.\nGlutathione Regulation During CGN Development\nHere, we also addressed the possibility that glutathione\ncould be responsible for regulating the levels of ROS\nduring development, this is supported by the idea that\nthe balance between ROS production and the expression\nand activity of the antioxidant systems determine ROS\nlevels in the cells. It is known that during nervous system\ndevelopment, neurons and glial cells contain glutathione,\nand by the postnatal Day 5, most neurons have decreased\nthe levels of glutathione, while olfactory mitral and\ngranule cells, CGN, and dorsal root ganglion neurons\nconsistently retain high levels of glutathione throughout\ndevelopment and in adulthood (Beiswanger et al., 1995).\nMoreover, glutathione deficient mice die before the embry-\nmice lacking of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) die before\nthe embryonic Day 8 also by an increase in apoptosis\n(Yant et al., 2003). Interestingly, while GPx4 is expressed\nin neurons, glial cells are devoid of GPx4 (Savaskan et al.,\n2007); furthermore, it seems that the developing brain con-\nstitutes a major site for GPx4 expression, while the specific\nsuppression of GPx4 between the embryonic Days 7.5 and\n10.5 led to microcephaly and abnormal hindbrain devel-\nopment (Borchert et al., 2006). These studies suggest a\nfundamental role of glutathione during nervous system\ndevelopment.\nIn this study, we found changes in the levels of gluta-\nthione content during CGN development. In the first\nphase, when ROS levels are relatively high, the\nTable 1. Frequency Counts of Structures With Low or High Levels of H2\n.\nFrequency counts of HyPer ratio values (%)\nNote.

One possibility to explain this obser-\nvation could be associated with a mechanism to balance\nthe levels of ROS required for optimal redox signaling\nand to prevent the deleterious effects of ROS during the\nfirst phase. The major increase of glutathione content\noccurred from 0 DIV to 1 DIV which precedes the\nmajor increase observed in ROS (Figure 9(a) and (b)).\nThereby, these results might suggest that glutathione con-\ntent in CGN development responds to an internal genetic\nprogram of the cells, which is independent of the trophic\nconditions and ROS levels. The idea is supported by the\nfact that in vivo, the glutathione content in the developing\ncerebellum increases by the time when CGN precursors\nbegin their process of differentiation CGN (Nanda et al.,\nIt is known that chronic treatments with BSO and\noxygen in rat-pups lead to a high rate of apoptosis in\nthe hippocampus, cerebellum, basal forebrain, and stri-\natum (Taglialatela et al., 1998). In this regard, our results\ndemonstrate that the increase in the glutathione content\nFigure 8. Continued.\nOlgui\n\u00b4n-Albuerne and Mora\nis necessary to allow CGN development because glutathi-\none depletion at 2 DIV drastically reduces CGN survival,\nbut it does not affect CGN survival in later stages of\nCGN development. This process could be explained by\ntwo major mechanisms of action of glutathione, one is\nthe interaction of glutathione with proteins, which modi-\nfies signaling pathways during variations in ROS homeo-\nstasis (Grek et al., 2013) and by a second mechanism that\ninvolves the antioxidant actions of glutathione. The fact\nthat the antioxidant Euk-134 completely rescues CGN\nviability under glutathione depletion strongly suggests\nthat the effect of glutathione in CGN survival is due to\nits antioxidant properties.\nDuring the second phase, the levels of glutathione con-\ntent are dependent on the state of depolarization. In\ndepolarizing conditions, glutathione remains high from\n3 to 5 DIV, a time when ROS levels decrease markedly.\nIn contrast, in nondepolarizing conditions, the glutathi-\none content diminishes since 4 DIV, which correlates with\nthe observed decrease in CGN survival and high ROS\nlevels (Figure 9(a) and (b)). This decrease in glutathione\ncontent can be considered an early hallmark of the cell\ndeath progression (Franco and Cidlowski, 2012). To rule\nout the possibility that the decrease of glutathione con-\ntent is responsible for the cell death observed during the\nsecond phase in nondepolarizing conditions, we dimin-\nished the levels of glutathione with BSO; however,\nalthough glutathione content was importantly reduced\nwith BSO treatment, the cell viability at the incubation\ntested times did not alter CGN survival at 5 DIV under\ndepolarizing conditions, indicating that a decrease in\nglutathione content is not sufficient to trigger cell death\nin developing CGN and that the decrease in glutathione\ncontent during the second phase in nondepolarizing\nFigure 9. Summary of the principal findings. (a, b) Relationship between the levels of ROS, reduced glutathione and cell survival in CGN\nunder depolarizing and nondepolarizing conditions. During the first 3 DIV, ROS and reduced glutathione increase, reaching the highest\nlevels around 2 DIV. By the third DIV, CGN maintained under depolarizing conditions (a) show a significant decrease in the ROS levels, as\nwell as a moderate reduction of glutathione levels. Cell viability remains unaltered. In CGN cultured in nondepolarizing conditions (b), the\nlevels of ROS remain increasing, while the levels of reduced glutathione decrease and the cell survival is compromised. (c to e) Effect of\nROS in the development of CGN. (c) During normal development, the levels of ROS are regulated by reduced glutathione. Also, (d) when\nROS production is decreased by NOX2 inhibition, the development of CGN is altered, as indicated by a low expression of the neuronal\nmarkers, Tau and MAP2, as well as a reduced axonal growth. (e) In contrast, the reduction of the levels of glutathione leads to an alteration\nin the axonal development and cell death. (f) The H2\nproduced in CGN is mainly localized in the axons; this H2\nis associated with the\nformation of filopodia and with axonal growth cone dynamics. (g) Glutathione depletion leads to the formation of multiple spheroid-like\nstructures in the axon that are rich in H2\n.

Interestingly, we found\nthat the antioxidants Ebselen and Euk-134 only reduced\nMAP2 expression at 2 DIV, while the NOX inhibitors,\nAEBSF, and apocynin diminished the levels of Tau at 1\nand 2 DIV, suggesting a more specific action of the ROS\nproduced by NOX activity in this process (Figure 9(c)\nand (d)). None of these treatments diminished the expres-\nsion of these proteins at 3 DIV, which could be explained\nby the fact that between 2 and 3 DIV the levels of these\ntwo proteins are not significantly increased under control\nconditions or that by this time the maturational process\nof CGN is no longer dependent on ROS.\nIt is noteworthy to mention that, based on the pro-\nposed mechanism of inhibition of AEBSF and apocynin,\ntheir primary target would be the NOX1 and NOX2\nhomologues (Jaquet et al., 2009). However, because the\neffect of these inhibitors is only partial, in this study, we\ncannot exclude the contribution of other NOX homo-\nlogues and other sources of ROS in the CGN develop-\nment. Also, although we cannot discard that part of\nthe effects of apocynin or AEBSF could be due to unspe-\ncific actions, their effects are validated with the use of a\nsecond NOX inhibitor (apocynin or AEBSF). Thus, we\nthink that the results obtained using separately both\ninhibitors with similar results may indicate that NOX is\ninvolved in the production of ROS required for CGN\nmaturation.\nOur results are in accordance with previous observa-\ntions indicating that ROS produced by NOX enzymes\nmay act as signaling molecules in the regulation of the\nneuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. In these cells, it is\nwell known that the neurotrophin NGF induces the\nexpression of different neuronal markers such as bIII-\ntubulin, GAP-43, and neurofilament L through the acti-\nvation of the receptor TrkA which leads to the activation\nof the signaling pathway Ras/Raf/MEK/ERKs (Kaplan\nBesides, NGF induces an increase in the levels of ROS\nproduced by NOX after 10 min of treatment (Suzukawa\net al., 2000). These ROS induce the phosphorylation of\nTrkA through the inhibition of protein tyrosine phos-\nphatases and the formation of complexes with the scaf-\nfold proteins Shc, Grb2, and Sos, which are required for\nthe activation of the MAPK pathway (Kamata et al.,\n2005). On the other hand, NGF also induces the phos-\nphorylation of ERKs after 30 min, which induces the\nexpression and activity of the mitochondrial super oxide\ndismutase (MnSOD), and the H2\nresulting from the\nMnSOD activity induces a second phosphorylation of\nERKs, which is essential for PC12 differentiation\nFurther studies have shown that NOX enzymes medi-\nate the neuronal differentiation in different models (Wang\nBelle et al., 2011). In the present study, we found that\nNOX shows a pattern of activity similar to the ROS levels\nobserved during the first and second phases of CGN\ndevelopment in depolarizing conditions. Different NOX\nhomologues could contribute to the observed NOX activ-\nity, which is in line with our findings about the expression\nof NOX1 and NOX2 enzymes that are highly regulated\nthroughout CGN development. Overall, in the first\nphase, the mRNA levels of both NOX1 and NOX2 are\nupregulated, while in the second phase, they are down-\nregulated. Interestingly, each NOX homologue showed a\nslightly different pattern of expression, which suggests\nthat these enzymes might have distinct roles during\nCGN development.\nIt is important to note that the expression of NOX2\nfollows more closely both the total NOX activity and the\nROS levels. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of NOX2 are\nconsiderably more abundant than mRNA NOX1 levels.\nThereby, we hypothesize that NOX2 could be the main\nsource of the ROS produced during CGN development.\nHowever, we found no differences in the levels of ROS\nmeasured by dihydroethidium between NOX2 KO and\nwild-type CGN at 1 DIV and 2 DIV. Thus, these results\nsuggest that NOX2 is not responsible for the increase of\nROS observed during the first phase of CGN develop-\nment. Nevertheless, we cannot discard a possible com-\npensatory mechanism in the NOX2 KO CGN, which\nhas been demonstrated in other preparations where an\nupregulation of NOX4 occurs in NOX2 KO mice in\ncells where NOX2 gene has been silenced (Pendyala\net al., 2009) or when an indirect downregulation of\nNOX2 leads to an overexpression of NOX4 (Sedeek\nDespite the fact that ROS levels measured by dihy-\ndroethidium were not affected in NOX2 KO CGN, we\nfound a slight decrease in the length of CGN axons at 1\nDIV and 2 DIV, which corroborates the importance of\nNOX2 during CGN development. Our findings that\nNOX2 KO CGN showed a reduction of neurite outgrow\nis in agreement with other studies carried out in Aplysia\nneurons that shows that NOX inhibitors reduce actin\nflow and its assembly at the leading edge of the axonal\ngrowth cone, leading to a decrease of the neurite out-\ngrowth (Munnamalai and Suter, 2009). The regulation\nof NOX2 in the axonal growth cones of Aplysia neurons\nseems to be bidirectional because the stimulation of\n, which regulates F-actin dynamics\nand neurite outgrowth; on the other hand, the\nOlgui\n\u00b4n-Albuerne and Mora\nstimulation of neurite outgrowth induces the proximity of\nthe cytoplasmic subunit of NOX2, p40phox, to its cata-\nlytic subunit, gp91phox, indicating that the regulation of\ncytoskeleton dynamics affects NOX2 activity\nThe relevance of NOX2 in the nervous system devel-\nopment is strengthened by the alterations of the brain\nphysiology observed in NOX2 KO mice. These animals\ndisplay deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and\nmild impairments in cognitive function, as well a slight\ndeficiency in motor learning (Kishida et al., 2006), which\nmight be attributed to an altered function in either the\ncerebellar cortex or the deep cerebellar nuclei (Caston\net al., 1995). Moreover, these mice have less proliferating\ncells in the subventricular zone, less migrating cells\nand fewer neuronal differentiation in the olfactory bulb\nthan in wild-type mice (Le Belle et al., 2011). However, it\nhas not been reported if the alterations in motor behavior\nobserved in NOX2 KO mice are due to aberrations in\nthe formation of cerebellar circuits or alterations in the\nsynaptic plasticity and function. In a previous study,\nwe found that the treatment of developing rats with apoc-\nynin or with the antioxidant MnTmPyP, produced alter-\nations in the cerebellar foliation as well as a deficiency\nin motor behavior, measured as alteration in the rod\nwalking and Rotarod tests (Coyoy et al., 2013).\nThe results obtained in the present study suggest that\npart of the actions of ROS and NOX could be related\nto neurite development during cerebellar cortex\nformation.\nand NOX Localization\nIn line with the above findings, we explored the possibility\nwere produced locally in developing CGN, as\nwell as the possible contribution of glutathione as a regu-\nlator of H2\n. Although it is not completely understood\nhow redox signaling occurs, there is increasing evidence\nindicating that the physiological function of ROS, and\nparticularly H2\n, might occur by the activation of spe-\ncific signaling pathways through reversible redox modifi-\ncations of proteins in subcellular compartments (Chen\nInterestingly, we found different regions of the developing\naxons and dendrites where H2\nis continuously pro-\nduced. These regions apparently correspond to those\nregions where NOX2 is expressed. For example, NOX2\nis enriched in filopodia, either in the axonal shaft where\nfilopodia are located or inside the filopodia, coincident\nwith the microdomains where H2\nis continuously pro-\nduced (Figure 9(f)), which suggest that both NOX2 and\nmight be related to filopodial dynamics. Moreover,\nwe also observed that the increase of H2\ninside the\nfilopodia occurs previous to the filopodia elongation\nand that after the process of filopodia retraction, the\namount of H2\nreturns to basal levels. Together,\nthese results strongly suggest that H2\nis involved in\nfilopodia formation and that NOX2 might be a possible\nsource for the H2\nproduced. This idea is supported by\nprevious studies showing that ROS control actin dynam-\nthe physiological levels of H2\nproduced by NOX2\nnegatively regulate the actin polymerization by inducing\nactin glutathionylation, while the overexpression of glu-\ntaredoxin 1, which is the enzyme that catalyzes actin\ndeglutathionylation, leads to multiple pseudopodia for-\nmation (Sakai et al., 2012). In macrophages, the forma-\ntion of filopodia and actin polymerization are regulated\nby the reversible oxidation of two methionine residues\nby MICAL1 and MICAL2; the oxidation of these resi-\ndues leads to actin disassembly, while the reduction of\nthese residues by the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase\nB1 lead to actin assembly, which in conjunction orches-\ntrate actin dynamics and macrophage function (Lee\net al., 2013). Therefore, we speculate that redox reac-\ntions might control filopodia formation in developing\nOn the other hand, the localization of NOX2 in the\naxonal growth cones also correlates with the observed\nhigh levels of H2\n. This result suggests that H2\nmight be related to axonal growth cone dynamics and\ncould be produced by NOX2, which is in\nline with the observation that NOX2 KO CGN showed\nless axonal growth than the wild-type CGN (Figure 9(d)\nand (f)). This association has been previously examined in\nAplysia neurons, where the H2\nproduced by NOX2\nmodulates f-actin dynamics and promotes axonal\ngrowth (Munnamalai et al., 2014). On the other hand,\nit has also been shown that H2\nnegatively regulates\naxonal growth. In dorsal root ganglion neurons,\nsemaphorin3A induces growth cone collapse by the regu-\nlation of cytoskeleton through CRMP2. Semaphorine3A\ninduces the generation of H2\nin the axonal growth\ncone through MICAL, which oxidizes CRMP2 and\ninduces the formation of a transient disulfide-linked\nhomodimer between the cysteines 504 of two CRMP2\nproteins. Then, this homodimer is reduced by thiore-\ndoxin that forms a disulfide bond with one molecule of\nCRMP2. This complex is crucial for CRMP2 phosphor-\nylation by GSK3-b, which ultimately produces the\ngrowth cone collapse of these neurons (Morinaka\net al., 2011). Although it is not completely understood\nthe regulation of the axonal growth cone dynamics by\n, it seems that multiple ROS sources are localized\nin this region, and it is clear that ROS regulate the mech-\nanisms responsible for the morphological organization of\nthese structures; thereby, further studies are required to\nasses these issues.\nFinally, we explored the possibility that axonal integ-\nrity were altered in the absence of glutathione.\nInterestingly, while we found no evident alterations in\nthe neuronal soma, we observed a severe aberrant\naxonal alteration in CGN treated with BSO that con-\nduces to axonal degeneration followed by cell death,\nwhich suggest that ROS levels are critical for both\naxonal formation and integrity (Figure 9(e) and (g)).\nThe spheroid-like structures formed in BSO treatments\nare possibly formed by the dysregulation of the H2\nproduction in the axon because these structures are\nenriched in H2\nand their formation is drastically inhib-\nited by the antioxidant treatment. The spheroid-like\nstructures found in CGN treated with BSO resemble the\nstructures found in a classic model of axonal degeneration.\nThis could have clinical implications because axons degen-\nerate before cell bodies in different neurodegenerative dis-\neases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's\ndisease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease,\nwhich has been related to a process of oxidative stress\n(Barnham et al., 2004). Thereby, we speculate that the\ndysregulation of the mechanisms that regulate ROS\nduring neuronal development could be similar to those\nthat are involved in neurodegenerative diseases.\nConclusions\nIn the present study, we showed evidence suggesting\nthat ROS regulate different aspects of CGN develop-\nment. During the first 3 DIV, ROS increased which is\nnecessary for CGN maturation. If the production of\nthese molecules is not regulated in the subsequent\ndays due to the trophic conditions (i.e., low potassium),\nROS lead to CGN death. Before the peak of ROS,\nglutathione content increased, which seems to be\nrequired for CGN to complete their development\nbecause the pharmacologically induced depletion of\nglutathione at this time conduced to CGN death.\nMost of the ROS produced at this stage are probably\nproduced by NOX2, which is mainly localized in filo-\npodia and growth cones. These regions correspond to\nmicrodomains in which H2\nis continuously produced.\nIn line with these results, neurite outgrowth is less in\nNOX2 KO CGN than in wild-type CGN, which suggest\nthat NOX2 is important during the early stages of CGN\ndevelopment. Finally, the pharmacological depletion of\nglutathione demonstrated the importance of glutathione\nas a regulator of the H2\nproduced in CGN axons\nand the importance of ROS during the axonal morpho-\ngenesis. Together these results suggest that the\nproduced by NOX2, in combination with glutathi-\none, controls axonal morphogenesis in CGN, which con-\ntribute to our understanding about neuronal\ndevelopment.\nSummary\nThe antioxidant systems involving glutathione and the\npro-oxidant NOX2 system regulates the reactive oxygen\nspecies levels involved in the axonal morphogenesis and\ncell survival of cerebellar granule neurons during the\nearly stages of development in an in vitro model.\nAuthor Note\nThis study is part of the requirements for the PhD degree\nin Biomedical Sciences of Mauricio Olgui\u00b4n-Albuerne at\nUniversidad Nacional Auto\n\u00b4 noma de Me\n\u00b4 xico.\n"
