For these groups, cumu-\nCompared with those with normal glucose tolerance, the multivariate adjusted RR of all-cause\n0.001). A similar pattern of risk was observed for cardiovascular disease mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS -- In the U.S., there was a gradient of mortality associated with abnormal\nglucose tolerance ranging from a 40% greater risk in adults with IGT to a 110% greater risk in\nadults with clinically evident diabetes. These associations were independent of established\ncardiovascular disease risk factors.\nDiabetes is a well-established risk fac-\ntor for cardiovascular disease mor-\ndeaths in the U.S. annually (1,2). How-\never, less is known about the relationship\nbetween mortality and subclinical states\nof glucose intolerance, namely impaired\nglucose tolerance (IGT) and undiagnosed\ntype 2 diabetes. Whereas previous studies\nhave generally indicated increased mor-\ntality related to these states (3\u00ad14), they\nhave been limited by nonstandard meth-\nods of glucose tolerance assessment (4,6\u00ad\n8), short follow-up (7,11), small numbers\nof events (10,11), suboptimal classifica-\natypical of the general U.S. population\n(3\u00ad14). Moreover, it remains unclear\nwhether this excess mortality is conferred\nby glucose intolerance per se or rather by\nother known cardiovascular disease risk\nfactors that commonly accompany diabe-\ntes, i.e., high blood pressure, dyslipide-\nstudies did not evaluate the relationship\nbetween subclinical states of glucose\nintolerance and death independent of\nthese potential confounding factors\ndent association of IGT and undiagnosed\ndiabetes with mortality in the general\npopulation would support the idea that\nimproved screening programs and early\nintervention may help reduce diabetes-\nrelated mortality in the U.S.\nTherefore, we conducted a prospec-\ntive study with two objectives: 1) to com-\npare the mortality among individuals\nwith diagnosed type 2 diabetes, undiag-\nnosed diabetes, and IGT with individuals\nwith normal glucose tolerance in the gen-\neral U.S. population; and 2) to determine\nwhether excess mortality in adults with\nabnormal glucose tolerance was indepen-\ndent of other established cardiovascular\ndisease risk factors.\nMETHODS -- Data were from the\nSecond National Health and Nutrition\nSurvey (NHANES II) Mortality Study, a\nprospective cohort study that passively\nfollowed participants 30 years of age\nwho underwent a detailed examination in\nby the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics. A stratified multistage sample design\nwas used to produce a representative sam-\nple of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civil-\nian population between the ages of 6\nmonths and 74 years (17).

Thus, the fi-\nnal sample for this analysis included\nadults whose glucose tolerance status was\nknown. However, participants with miss-\ning values for blood pressure, HDL, edu-\ncation, smoking, or physical activity were\nexcluded from the multivariate analysis\nBaseline assessments\nParticipants' age, sex, race, years of edu-\ncation (less than high school and high\nschool or greater), and personal health\ncharacteristics were obtained by inter-\nview. Smoking status was categorized as\ncurrent, past, or never. Participants were\nasked to rate both their recreational and\nnonrecreational physical activity as \"much,\"\n\"moderate,\" or \"little to no activity.\" Re-\nsponses for both types of physical activity\nquestions were summed and recorded\naccording to the following classification:\n1 (high in either recreational or nonrec-\nreational and moderate in the other), 2\n(moderate in both), 3 (moderate in one\nand low in the other), and 4 (low activity\nin both recreational and nonrecreational\nactivity).\nPhysical examination included mea-\nsuring height, weight, and blood pres-\nsure. BMI was calculated as kilograms per\nsquare meter for each participant (17). A\nphysician recorded each participant's\nblood pressure twice in the sitting posi-\ntion. The average of the two blood pres-\nsure readings for each participant was\nused in this study. Laboratory measures\nincluding standard blood assays for total\nserum cholesterol, HDLs, triglycerides,\ncreatinine, and plasma glucose levels\nwere obtained after participants fasted\nblood sample was taken, participants in-\nmin postchallenge.\nDefinitions\nGlucose tolerance was classified accord-\n(WHO) criteria (17). Participants were\nclassified as having previously diagnosed\ndiabetes if they answered \"yes\" to both of\nthe following questions: \"Do you have\nglucose diabetes?\" and \"Did a doctor tell\nyou that you had it?\" (n  248). Partici-\npants were classified as having undiag-\nnosed diabetes if fasting plasma glucose\nas having IGT if fasting plasma glucose\nmg/dl. All other participants were classi-\nfied as having normal glucose tolerance\nParticipants were defined as having\ncardiovascular disease at baseline if they\ntested positive on a modified Rose angina\nquestionnaire (17) or answered \"yes\" to\nany of the following questions from the\nmedical history questionnaire: \"Has a\ndoctor ever told you that you had a heart\nattack?\" or \"Have you ever had a stroke?\nAnd did a doctor tell you this?\" (17).\nOutcomes\nMortality status was ascertained for the\ntional Death Index and the Social Security\nAdministration Death Master File (19).\nThere was no censoring in this cohort;\nparticipants not found to be deceased by\nalive. Deaths were ascribed to cardiovas-\ncular disease if any of the following con-\nditions were coded as underlying causes\nof death according to the ninth revision\nof the International Classification of Dis-\neases: hypertensive heart disease (402.0\u00ad\nheart failure (428.9), unspecified cardio-\nvascular disease (429.2), cerebrovascular\nthe arteries, arterioles, and capillaries\nAnalysis\nAll analyses were weighted to the U.S.\npopulation at the midpoint of NHANES II\nsoftware, version 6.4 (Research Triangle\nPark, NC), to account for the complex\nsurvey design and to provide nationally\nDemographic characteristics and car-\ndiovascular disease risk factors at baseline\nwere compared for participants with di-\nagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes,\nIGT, and normal glucose tolerance using\nanalysis of variance or Pearson's 2 test.\nAll tests of significance were two-tailed.\nNo corrections were made for multiple\ncomparisons.\nPerson-years analysis. The weighted\nnumber of person-years was summed\nseparately for each glucose tolerance\ngroup. The weighted numbers of deaths\ndue to all causes and to cardiovascular\ndiseases were also summed for each\ngroup. Mortality was calculated for each\ngroup using these weighted sums. The\nPoisson distribution was used to calculate\nLife-table analysis. Cumulative mortal-\nity was determined using a life-table\nmethod. For each 5-year age-group, the\nweighted population, based on age at\ndeath or at the end of follow-up, was cal-\nculated along with the weighted number\nof deaths from all-cause mortality and\ncardiovascular disease mortality for each\nglucose tolerance group. A life table was\ndeveloped, and the probability of mortal-\nity based on age was then calculated. Cu-\nmulative mortality was determined for\nall-cause and cardiovascular disease mor-\ntality and plotted as cumulative mortality\ncurves by glucose tolerance group. Cu-\nmulative mortality curves were compared\noverall and by 5-year age intervals using\nlog-rank tests.\nProportional hazards analysis. To de-\ntermine whether differences in relative\nhazard between glucose tolerance groups\ncould be explained by other variables,\nproportional hazard models were con-\nstructed including age, sex and race, ed-\nucation, behavioral risk factors (physical\nactivity and smoking), and biological risk\nfactors (BMI, systolic blood pressure, and\nHDL cholesterol). When participants\nwith baseline cardiovascular disease were\nexcluded from the analysis, there was no\nchange in the direction or magnitude of\nthe results. Therefore, the analysis in-\ncludes participants with baseline cardio-\nvascular disease. There were no signifi-\ncant first-order interactions between the\nglucose tolerance state and any covariate\n(P  0.05). Graphs of the log-log plot of\nthe relative hazards by time showed that\nthe assumption of proportional hazards\nwas met. To test for trend, glucose toler-\nance was treated as a single ordinal vari-\nable. Furthermore, because of potentially\ndiffering effects of glucose tolerance by\nage, all-cause mortality analyses were re-\npeated after stratification at age 60 years.\nThis cut point was selected due to the\nSubclinical glucose intolerance\noversampling of adults 60 years of age\nin the NHANES II. Age-stratified models\nwere adjusted for all of the same risk fac-\ntors as the unstratified models, including\ncontinuous age. Because of the small\nnumber of cardiovascular deaths in adults\n60 years of age, stratified analyses were\nnot performed for cardiovascular out-\ncomes.\nWHO criteria (21). Based on this criteria,\nparticipants were classified as having\ndiagnosed diabetes (n  248); undiag-\nnosed diabetes if fasting plasma glucose\nplasma glucose was 200 mg/dl (n \n464); or impaired fasting glucose if fasting\nBecause of the small number of partici-\npants with impaired fasting glucose and\nthe small number of deaths in the group,\nwe combined the impaired fasting glu-\ncose and the IGT groups into an abnormal\nglucose tolerance group.

The expected trends were ob-\nserved across the groups from normal glu-\ncose tolerance to diagnosed diabetes.\nSpecifically, compared with their coun-\nterparts with normal glucose tolerance,\nindividuals with abnormal glucose toler-\nance were older and more likely to be fe-\nmale, less educated, and sedentary. They\nalso had a greater adiposity, a lower HDL,\na higher blood pressure and triglyceride\nlevel, and a stronger history of cardiovas-\ncular disease.\nDeath rates\nyears was highest for the diagnosed dia-\nbetes group (40.9%), followed by the\nundiagnosed diabetes group (33.2%), the\nIGT group (20.8%), and the normal glu-\n(Table 2).

Com-\npared with their counterparts with nor-\nmal glucose tolerance, RR of mortality\nwas 1.42 times greater in those with IGT,\n1.77 times greater in those with undiag-\nnosed diabetes, and 2.11 times greater in\nthose with diagnosed diabetes (Table 2).\nA similar gradient in adjusted risk was ob-\nserved for cardiovascular disease mortal-\nity, although the individual RRs for those\nwith IGT and undiagnosed diabetes were\nnot statistically different from those with\nnormal glucose tolerance (Table 2).\nWe repeated the analysis using the\nbetes and abnormal glucose tolerance.\nSimilar trends were observed for both all-\ncause mortality and cardiovascular dis-\nease mortality.

However, this apparent\nattenuation of age with glucose tolerance\nwas not statistically significant (P \nCONCLUSIONS -- These data sug-\ngest that in the U.S., subclinical states of\nglucose intolerance are associated with a\n42\u00ad77% greater risk for all-cause mortal-\nity and a 15\u00ad54% greater risk for cardio-\nvascular disease mortality. These asso-\nciations are independent of established\ncardiovascular disease risk factors that\ncommonly accompany abnormal glucose\ntolerance. Strengths of this study include\na large nationally representative sample,\n12\u00ad16 years of follow-up, use of standard\ndefinitions of glucose tolerance, and a\nspecific focus on the subclinical states of\nglucose intolerance that would be the ob-\nject of screening programs.\nNonetheless, there were three limita-\ntions of this study. First, there was nonre-\nsponse in NHANES II at each stage of the\nsurvey. In particular, for adults aged\npants selected for the survey in the oral\nglucose tolerance test subsample com-\npleted the examination (18). Previous\nanalysis showed that respondents and\nnonrespondents did not differ signifi-\ncantly in demographic or health-related\ncharacteristics (18,22). The respondents\nand nonrespondents also did not differ by\nmortality experience: all-cause mortality\nbecause mortality follow-up was passive,\nmisclassification of vital status was possi-\nble. Previous studies indicate that deaths\nmay be underascertained in African-\nAmericans (19). In as far as African-Amer-\nicans were overrepresented in the abnor-\nmal glucose tolerance groups, this may\nhave produced an underestimate of the\nmortality risk. Finally, glucose tolerance\nstatus was only assessed at baseline, and it\nis likely that many participants in the IGT\ngroup developed diabetes. Recent evi-\ndence from several U.S. cohort studies\nsuggests a conversion rate from IGT to\nTable 2--All-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality by glucose tolerance group for 3,174 adults aged 30\u00ad74 years in the NHANES II\nNormal glucose\ntolerance\nImpaired glucose\ntolerance\nUndiagnosed\ndiabetes\nDiagnosed\ndiabetes\nAll-cause mortality\nCardiovascular disease mortality\n*Adjusted for age (continuous), sex, race (Caucasian or African-American), education (less than high school or high school or greater), smoking (current, past, or\nnever), physical activity (1-high to 4-low), HDLs, systolic blood pressure, and BMI (all continuous).\nSubclinical glucose intolerance\ngroup who died had diabetes coded on\ndeath certificates.

Three studies were\nlimited to employed, primarily Cauca-\nnonstandard glucose tolerance tests (4,6\u00ad\n8), the results of which cannot be directly\ncompared with WHO standards. Al-\nthough the Seven Counties Finnish Study\nand the Paris Prospective Study used a\n75-g standard, neither evaluated individ-\nuals with undiagnosed diabetes sepa-\nrately; instead, individuals were pooled\ninto a single diabetes category to compen-\nsate for small numbers of incident cases\n(4,10).

There are several possi-\nble explanations for this finding (25,26).\nFirst, the subclinical states may be mark-\ners for greater or more prolonged expo-\nsure to established cardiovascular disease\nrisk factors (such as high blood pressure),\nbeyond what is captured by measure-\nments of these risk factors at a single point\nin time, as in this study. Second, the sub-\nclinical states may be mainly important\ninsofar as they predict the development of\nclinically evident (i.e., more severe) dia-\nbetes. Finally, hyperglycemia or hyperin-\nsulinemia may directly confer risk.\nElucidation of the exact causal pathway\nmay lead to improvements in treatment.\nNonetheless, even without such informa-\ntion on mechanism, subclinical states ap-\npear to convey important prognostic\ninformation that would otherwise be\noverlooked during routine clinical assess-\nment of adiposity, blood pressure, and\nlipids.\nThus, subclinical states of glucose in-\ntolerance may represent logical targets for\nmass screening programs aimed at reduc-\ning diabetes-related mortality in the U.S.\nHowever, identification of prognostically\nvaluable subclinical states alone is not suf-\nficient justification for mass screening.\nOne must also demonstrate that treat-\nments applied at the subclinical stage are\nmore effective (and perhaps more cost-\neffective) than treatments applied after di-\nUnfortunately, data on the treatment of\nsubclinical states of glucose intolerance\nare sparse. The U.K. Prospective Diabetes\nStudy (UKPDS) demonstrated that more\naggressive glycemic control of adults with\nnewly diagnosed type 2 diabetes pro-\nduced reductions in microvascular com-\nplications, but these individuals had\nclinically manifested diabetes. In other\nwords, UKPDS recruitment relied on\nphysician referral of patients, not screen-\ning of asymptotic individuals (29). With\nregard to IGT, one small treatment trial\nhas been completed (30), and several\nlarger trials are currently being under-\ntaken, including the Diabetes Prevention\nProgram (31), but these trials are not\npowered to study the effects of early in-\ntervention on diabetic complications or\ndeath. Nonetheless, the main implication\nof our study is that improvement in the\ndetection and treatment of undiagnosed\ndiabetes and IGT should reduce mortality\nin the general U.S. population. The deter-\nmination of effective treatments depends\non the results of ongoing trials and ad-\nvances in our understanding of the patho-\ngenesis of cardiovascular disease and\nother diabetes-related complications that\nlead to premature death.\n"
