The data collected in October to\nNovember 2014 are from the emotional exhaustion dimension of the Chinese version of Safety Attitudes Questionnaire in\na regional teaching hospital in Taiwan. The number of effective questionnaires including the entire staffs such as physicians,\nnurses, technicians, pharmacists, medical administrators, and respiratory therapists is 680. The results show that 8 clusters\nare generated by kernel k-means method. Employees in clusters 1, 4, and 5 are relatively in good conditions, whereas\nemployees in clusters 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 need to be closely monitored from time to time because they have relatively higher\ndegree of burnout. When employees with higher degree of burnout are identified, the hospital management can take actions\nto improve the resilience, reduce the potential medical errors, and, eventually, enhance the patient safety. This study also\nsuggests that the hospital management needs to keep track of medical staffs' fatigue conditions and provide timely assistance\nfor burnout recovery through employee assistance programs, mindfulness-based stress reduction programs, positivity\ncurrency buildup, and forming appreciative inquiry groups.\n",

Physicians' overwork, stress, and\nfatigue are contributing factors to medical errors. That is,\nmedical errors are highly related to physicians' degree of\nburnout and mental quality of life.2 Cimiotti et al3 described\nthat nurse burnout is highly linked to job satisfaction and\npatient safety. An increase in nurses' workload would result\nin higher infections. Bria et al4 further concluded that burn-\nout is a response to the prolonged exposure to occupational\nstress that influences the individuals, organizations, and\nhealth care service recipient negatively. Most importantly,\nthe patients might suffer serious medical errors from burnout\nmedical staffs.\nBecause medical staffs with burnout would result in poor\npatient safety, it is essentially important for hospital manage-\nment to observe and understand the attitudes from medical\nstaffs toward burnout.5 Maslach Burnout Inventory\u00adHuman\nServices Survey (MBI-HSS) with 3 dimensions along with\n22 questions has been widely used in practice to assess the\ndegree of burnout for medical staffs.6 These 3 dimensions are\nemotional exhaustion with 9 questions, depersonalization\nwith 8 questions, and low personal accomplishment with 5\n1Cheng Ching General Hospital\u00adChung Kang Branch, Taichung City,\nTaiwan\n2Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan\n3Hung Kuang University, Taichung City, Taiwan\n4National Changhua University of Education, Changhua City, Taiwan\n5Hubei University of Economics, Wuhan City, China\nCorresponding Author:\nHsin-Hung Wu, Department of Business Administration, National\nChanghua University of Education, No. 2 Shida Road, Changhua\nEmail: hhwu@cc.ncue.edu.tw\nLee et al7 used a Chinese version of MBI-HSS to assess\nnurses' burnout in Taiwan. Loera et al6 uses MBI-HSS to\nevaluate Italian nurses' burnout. Furthermore, Lee et al5\npointed out that the Chinese version of Safety Attitudes\nQuestionnaire (SAQ) originally developed by Sexton et al8\nhas incorporated 9 questions from the emotional exhaustion\ndimension of MBI-HSS to form a new Chinese version of\nThe purpose of this modified Chinese SAQ is to assess the\npatient safety culture as well as the degree of burnout (emo-\ntional exhaustion) from all of the staffs' perceptions for each\nhealth care organization in Taiwan on a yearly basis.\nAssessing the patient safety culture in a particular health\ncare organization is critically important. Through the Chinese\nSAQ survey from staffs' perceptions, staffing deficits of the\npatient safety culture can be identified such that the hospital\nmanagement can improve health care quality and patient\nsafety.9 Wagner et al10 also pointed out that health care orga-\nnizations with a more positive culture and reflective attitude\ntoward errors and patient safety would result in reducing the\nnumber of accidents and failures. That is, a positive patient\nsafety culture implies that the health care organization places\npatient safety in one of the highest priorities.9\nBy considering the needs of health care organizations in\nassessing the patient safety culture in Taiwan from medical\nstaffs' viewpoints, the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital\nAccreditation adopted emotional exhaustion dimension from\nMBI-HSS to evaluate the degree of burnout with 9 questions.5\nThat is, emotional exhaustion dimension might be the better\ndimension to characterize and assess the degree of burnout for\nmedical staffs in health care organizations in Taiwan. When\nmedical staffs are in high degree of burnout from occupational\nstress, the patients might suffer medical errors from burnout\nmedical staffs. Therefore, regularly assessing the patient safety\nculture through the Chinese SAQ survey to evaluate employees'\ndegree of burnout is essentially important. Moreover, when\nemployees in health care organizations have higher degree of\nburnout, the hospital management needs to take actions to keep\ntrack of medical staffs' fatigue conditions and then provide\ntimely assistance for burnout recovery to enhance patient safety.\nLee et al5 used 9 questions of emotional exhaustion\ndimension from the Chinese version of SAQ and found that\nmedical staffs with different demographic variables perceive\nburnout differently by analysis of variance. On the contrary,\ncluster analysis which is one of the data mining techniques\ncan be applied to divide the entire medical staffs into an\nappropriate number of groups based on their similarities.11 In\nmarketing applications, the values of different customer\ngroups after cluster analysis can be calculated and evaluated\nto provide the management useful decisional information for\nresources allocation.11-15 The purpose of this study is to iden-\ntify medical staffs with high burnout by cluster analysis such\nthat the hospital management can take actions to improve the\nresilience, further reduce the potential medical errors, and,\neventually, enhance the patient safety.\nMethods\nThe data collected in October to November 2014 are from\nthe emotional exhaustion dimension of the Chinese version\nof SAQ survey results conducted by a regional teaching hos-\npital in central Taiwan. By removing incomplete question-\nnaires, the number of effective questionnaires including the\nentire staffs such as physicians, nurses, technicians, pharma-\ncists, medical administrators, and respiratory therapists is\n680. The demographic variables included in the Chinese ver-\nsion of SAQ survey are gender, age, supervisor/manager,\nrespondents reporting events in the past 12 months, job posi-\ntion, job status, experience in organization, experience in\nposition, education, and direct patient contact.\nEach question in emotional exhaustion dimension uses a\n5-point Likert scale that ranges from strongly agree to\nstrongly disagree with the respective values of 5 to 1. In\naddition, all questions in emotional exhaustion dimension\nare reversed questions such that each respondent's answer is\nadjusted. That is, a higher (lower) value for each question\nrepresents a lower (higher) degree of fatigue or burnout. On\nthe contrary, each demographic variable uses a numerical\nvalue from 2 to 7 to represent the selections of that particular\nvariable.\nTable 1. Nine Questions of Emotional Exhaustion Dimension From the Chinese Version of SAQ.\nDimension Question\nEmotional exhaustion Q1. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.\nQ2. I feel burned out from my work.\nQ3. I feel frustrated by my job.\nQ4. I feel I'm working too hard on my job.\nQ5. I feel emotionally drained from my work.\nQ6. I feel used up at the end of the workday.\nQ7. I feel fatigued when I get up in the morning and have to face another day on the job.\nQ8. Working with people all day is really a strain for me.\nQ9. Working with people directly puts too much stress on me.\nNote. SAQ = Safety Attitudes Questionnaire.\nLee et al 3\nKernel k-means method by R language with package\n\"Kernlab\" along with the kernel function of the radial basis\n(Gaussian kernel) is chosen to perform cluster analysis.\nKernel k-means method, which is a more generalized\nk-means method for cluster analysis, is very suitable for both\nlinear and nonlinear separable inputs because the type of the\ndata is usually unknown.16,17 Similar to k-means method,\nkernel k-means method cannot determine the number of\nclusters itself. In this case study, we employ variance ratio\ncriterion introduced by Calinski and Harabasz to determine\nthe number of clusters.18,19 Table 2 summarizes the values of\nvariance ratio criterion, where a higher value indicates the\nbetter cluster quality. In this study, the number of clusters is\nset to 8 with the highest value based on variance ratio\ncriterion.\nResults\nNine questions from emotional exhaustion dimension and 10\ndemographic variables are the input variables. In addition,\nthe number of the clusters by kernel k-means method is set to\n8. Six hundred eighty employees are classified into 8 groups,\nwhere Table 3 summarizes the average values of 9 questions\nfrom emotional exhaustion dimension for each cluster and\nthe grand average values of 9 questions from the entire\nemployees. The notations denoted by Q1 to Q9 represent 9\nquestions of emotional exhaustion dimension, and an aster-\nisk sign indicates that the average value of a particular ques-\ntion from a cluster is greater than the grand average.\nFrom the numerical values of 9 questions depicted in\nTable 3, Q1, Q3, Q8, and Q9 are above the average value of\n3 based on a 5-point Likert scale, showing that employees\nfeel less in emotional exhaustion. In contrast, Q2, Q4, Q5,\nQ6, and Q7 are below the average value of 3, indicating that\nemployees are in relatively high emotional exhaustion.\nSpecifically, Q6 has the lowest value among 9 questions\nshowing that employees agree that they feel used up at the\nend of the workday followed by Q4 which has the second\nlowest value, stating that employees also agree that they are\nworking too hard on their jobs. On the contrary, Q9 has the\nhighest value among 9 questions. That is, employees agree\nthat working with people directly does not put too much\nstress on themselves. In addition, Q8 has the second highest\nscore which shows that working with people all day is not\nreally a strain for employees.\nIn contrast to the numerical values of 9 questions from\nemotional exhaustion, the performance for each cluster can\nbe assessed by these 9 questions in terms of asterisks.\nSpecifically, all of the average values in cluster 4 are greater\nthan the grand average values, indicating that employees in\nthis cluster are in low degree of fatigue or burnout. Employees\nin cluster 1 are also in lower degree of fatigue or burnout\nexcept for Q9 (Working with people directly puts too much\nstress on me) that has a slightly lower average value than the\ngrand average value. Moreover, employees in cluster 5 are in\nlower degree of fatigue or burnout except for Q3 (I feel frus-\ntrated by my job) and Q9 that both questions have slightly\nlower average values than the grand average values.\nClusters 2, 3, 6, and 7 having all of the average values less\nthan the grand average values show that these employees are\nin high degree of burnout or fatigue. In addition, cluster 8 has\n8 out of 9 questions having the average values smaller than\nthe grand average values except for Q4 (I feel I'm working\ntoo hard on my job) which has a larger average value than the\ngrand average value. From the viewpoints of the hospital\nmanagement, employees in clusters 1, 4, and 5 are relatively\nin good conditions, whereas employees in clusters 2, 3, 6, 7,\nand 8 need to be closely monitored from time to time because\nthey have relatively higher degree of fatigue or burnout.\nIn general, employees in 8 clusters can be further catego-\nrized into 2 types of groups, that is, lower degree of fatigue\n(clusters 1, 4, and 5) with the sample size of 396 and higher\ndegree of fatigue (clusters 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8) with the sample\nsize of 284. The hospital management needs to pay much\nattention to those who are in higher degree of fatigue. The\nfrequencies of these 2 groups in demographic variables are\nquite similar. Table 4 provides the more specific information\nfor each cluster in terms of demographic variables. The\nmajority of employees are characterized as follows: female,\n21 to 50 years old, not in charge of supervisors/managers,\nreporting less than 6 events in the past 12 months, nurses,\nfull-time, with the experience of 5 to 20 years in organization,\nwith the experience of 5 to 20 years in position, college/uni-\nversity degree, and very often to direct patient contact. From\nthe cluster analysis results, the hospital management might\nnot be able to identify those employees who are in higher\ndegree of burnout. However, with the link of further demo-\ngraphic variables such as the department a particular employee\nworks along with the individual demographic variables,\nemployees who are in higher degree of burnout can be found.\nThis study suggests that the hospital management needs\nto keep track of medical staffs' fatigue conditions and then\nprovide timely assistance. The recommendations are as fol-\nlows. First, unit heads can use team resource management\n(TRM) on a daily basis for improvement. The coverage of\nTRM includes leadership, situation monitoring, mutual\nsupport, and communication. That is, unit heads can group\nall of the members before the work every day and then use\nan I'M SAFE (Illness, Medication/Menstruation, Stress/\nSleep, Alcohol/Drugs, Fatigue, and Emotion/Eating and\nElimination) checklist to know whether each employee is\nin a good condition physically or psychologically. If not,\nadjust the employees' daily work to ensure members and\npatient safety.\nTable 2. The Number of Clusters Analyzed by Variance Ratio\nCriterion.\nSecond, labor safety and health management committee\nshould be established, and the members should include\nsuperintendent or vice superintendent, labor safety and\nTable 4.

The\ncommittee should establish fatigue management plan, inves-\ntigate the staff's level of fatigue, and then provide preven-\ntion and elimination programs for recovery. The specific\ncontents are depicted below. The labor safety and health\nmanagement or human resource management personnel can\nset up a high secrecy instant notification system. The hospi-\ntal can provide each staff a \"self-fatigue prevention\" booklet\nissued by Institute of Labor, Occupational Safety and\nHealth, Ministry of Labor, Executive Yuan in Taiwan since\n2007. If an employee is found to have the symptoms listed\nin the booklet, the committee should provide timely inter-\nvention for necessary assistance to avoid further fatigue\nphenomenon. In addition, the committee should regularly\nconduct hospital-wide fatigue surveys by using the fatigue\nscales with both reliability and validity such as MBI-HSS or\nCopenhagen Burnout Inventory. The committee can develop\nand then implement fatigue prevention, recovery, and elimi-\nnation for each medical staff based on survey results.\nMoreover, the fatigue surveys and analyses should be con-\nducted annually such that the fatigue management plan and\nthe employee assistance programs (EAPs) can be performed\nto relentlessly reduce the staffs' levels of fatigue.\nDiscussion\nThis study has 4 major recommendations for burnout recov-\nery. First, the hospital (human resource management depart-\nment) should establish EAPs to set up a long-term service\nsystem plan to prevent and resolve the possible causes from\neither the organization or individuals that might lead to the\ndecrease of employee productivity. In doing so, employees\ncan work in good conditions physically and psychologically\nto reduce medical accidents that might strengthen the hospi-\ntal competitiveness and establish a good relationship between\nthe hospital management and the staff. EAP covers 3 indi-\nvidual levels, that is, job including the work adaptation,\nadjustment of organizational change, work-life balance,\ncareer (retirement) planning, and so forth; life including\nlegal advice (such as legal issues containing the public ser-\nvice, car accidents, debt, inheritance, marriage, conflict, etc)\nand financial advisory (such as tax treatment, debt manage-\nment, insurance planning, etc), and health including mental\nhealth (such as stress adaptation, anger management, work-\nplace interpersonal communication, the major crisis response\nand management during the various stages of the career, etc)\nand health care (such as providing the health care measures\nand health care resources information in civil societies).\nSecond, the hospital can provide mindfulness-based stress\nreduction (MBSR) programs to its staff. MBSR, created by\nDr Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 at the University of Massachusetts\nMedical School, combines western medicine/psychology\nand traditional eastern meditation to assist participants in the\nmindfulness view of dealing with stress, pain, and illness. In\nthe past 3 decades, MBSR has been proven to be an effective\nThird, cultivate and help employees to build up their \"posi-\ntivity currency.\" Resilience cannot be printed just the way coun-\nties print money. In contrast, when individuals focus on positive\nattitudes toward interactions, life events, and memories and\nexpress his or her gratitude, then the \"positivity currency\" can\nbe printed and stored as assets. In addition, maintaining a posi-\ntive outlook and expressing gratitude regularly are the real val-\nues for employees to build resilience. Kopans23 pointed out that\ncreating \"positivity currency\" can decrease anxiety, reduce ill-\nness symptoms, improve the quality of sleep, and, ultimately,\nlead to greater personal resilience. By being more positive our-\nselves, we encourage others to do the same. This in turn creates\na positive feedback loop that our own resilience is increased and\nstrengthened by the actions of others.\nFourth, set up \"appreciative inquiry\" groups.Appreciative\ninquiry is a model that can be used to cultivate employees in\nself-determined changes. Cooperrider and Whitney24 stated\nthat appreciative inquiry is the coevolutionary search for the\nbest in people, their organizations, and the relevant world\naround them. By attempting to praise the employees who\nhave been achieved over the past, the reasons behind the\nresults to the past successful experience can be found and be\nthe beginning to encourage medical staffs enthusiastically to\nenhance resilience and positive psychology, which will\nbecome the driving force for the organizational develop-\nment. That is, appreciative inquiry seeks to enlarge the traits\nof the past behaviors to achieve the organizational progress\nand enhance the cohesion of purpose. Therefore, this study\nsuggests that the hospital can form appreciative inquiry\ngroups to focus on those employees with high burnout to\nimprove their resilience.\nAuthors' Note\nThe clinical trial approval certificate (ethic statement) was approved\nby Cheng Ching General Hospital in Taichung City, Taiwan, with\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was partially supported by Ministry of Science and\nReferences\n1.
