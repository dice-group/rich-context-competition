Allison, PhD\ncials and organizations\nhave tried to warn the\npublic about the dan-\ngers of obesity.1,2 One of the strongest\nwarnings came from the US surgeon\nGeneral who stated that a failure to ad-\ndress overweight and obesity \"could\nwipe out some of the gains we've made\nin areas such as heart disease, several\nforms of cancer, and other chronic\nhealth problems.\"3\nFor a health message to be effective,\nit should be both understood by the re-\ncipient and the information should be\nperceived as relevant.4 In trying to con-\nvey the magnitude of the deleterious ef-\nfects of obesity, investigators have pre-\nsented information on the health care\ncosts due to obesity,5 the relative mor-\ntality rates among obese vs nonobese\npersons,6 and the number of annual\ndeaths that might be attributable to obe-\nsity.7 These messages may not be effec-\ntive for individuals in the United States,\nwho may be less interested in popula-\ntion-level effects. One way to quantify\nthe individual effect is in terms of the\nexpected number of years of life lost\n(YLL). The YLL is defined as the dif-\nference between the number of years a\nperson would be expected to live if he/\nshe was not obese and the number of\nyears expected to live if the person were\nobese.\nTo our knowledge, only 1 study has\nattempted to calculate YLL estimates\ndue to obesity. Stevens et al8 found that\nYLL estimates were greater for older\nthan younger obese individuals. This\nseems counterintuitive and may be the\nresult of the investigators restricting\ntheir analysis to a 12-year period rather\nthan estimating YLL across the remain-\ning life span. This may have led to\nmarked underestimation of YLL and\nmay have created a spurious positive\ncorrelation between baseline age and\nYLL. Therefore, we conducted a study\nestimating YLL across the entire life\nspan to provide meaningful values.\nMETHODS\nMethod of Calculation\nThe YLL due to obesity can be esti-\nmated by combining 3 types of infor-\nmation1: an estimate of the distribution\nof body mass index (BMI) for each year\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of Rheumatology, Johns\nHopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Md\n(Dr Fontaine) and Department of Biostatistics (Drs Red-\nden, Wang, and Allison and Mr Westfall), Section on\nStatistical Genetics, Clinical Nutrition Research Cen-\nter (Drs Wang and Allison), University of Alabama, Bir-\nmingham.\nCorresponding Author and Reprints: David B.

Body mass index (BMI) integer-defined cat-\nBMI of 24 was used as the reference category.\nMain Outcome Measure The difference between the number of years of life ex-\npected if an individual were obese vs not obese, which was designated YLL.\nResults Marked race and sex differences were observed in estimated YLL. Among\nwhites, a J- or U-shaped association was found between overweight or obesity and\nYLL. The optimal BMI (associated with the least YLL or greatest longevity) is approxi-\nmately 23 to 25 for whites and 23 to 30 for blacks. For any given degree of over-\nweight, younger adults generally had greater YLL than did older adults. The maxi-\nmum YLL for white men aged 20 to 30 years with a severe level of obesity (BMI 45)\nis 13 and is 8 for white women. For men, this could represent a 22% reduction in ex-\npected remaining life span. Among black men and black women older than 60 years,\noverweight and moderate obesity were generally not associated with an increased YLL\nand only severe obesity resulted in YLL. However, blacks at younger ages with severe\nlevels of obesity had a maximum YLL of 20 for men and 5 for women.\nConclusion Obesity appears to lessen life expectancy markedly, especially among\nyounger adults.\nFor editorial comment see p 229.\nof adult life2; an estimate of the hazard\nratio (HR) for death given various BMI\nlevels in each year of adult life (ages\nduring each year of adult life.3 Each of\nthese types of information was ob-\ntained from existing public use data\nsources.

NHANES\nIIIcollectsinformationabouthealthand\ndiet in a representative sample of the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized US popu-\nlation. This survey also estimates the\nprevalence of a variety of health con-\nditions and risk factors, such as obe-\nsity. NHANES combines a home inter-\nview with health tests, which are\nperformed in a mobile examination cen-\nter. NHANES III has been described in\ndetail elsewhere.9,10 In brief, NHANES\nIII represents a 6-year study, involv-\ning two 3-year phases, conducted from\nestimates of the population-based BMI\ndistribution are from both phases of the\nNHANES III data collection. Mexican\nAmericans, non-Hispanic blacks, and\nolder adults were oversampled in\nNHANES III to ensure weighted, un-\nbiased estimates from these particular\ngroups. Herein, only black and white\nsubjects were used because sample\nsizes of other groups were generally in-\nsufficient to allow reasonably precise\nestimates.\nBody mass index was divided into or-\ndered, nonoverlapping categories start-\nSecond, for each race and sex group, the\nproportion of individuals within each\nBMI category was estimated. The pro-\nportions were calculated using a\nsmoothing procedure based on mov-\ning averages. This procedure was nec-\nessary because continuous scales made\ncategorical with fine gradations may re-\nsult in insufficient data to produce pre-\ncise estimates. Smoothing is a nonpara-\nmetric way to minimize this problem.\nSpecifically, we first estimated the prob-\nability of being in each of a series of 34\noverlapping BMI intervals starting with\nthe interval BMI of less than 17, then\nprogressing through BMI intervals with\n45). For each interval, we assigned\nsubjects a score of 1 if their observed\nBMI was within the interval and zero\nif it was not. This resulted in 34 bi-\nnary variables. Each of these binary vari-\nables was then regressed on age to a\nthird-degree polynomial via logistic re-\ngression.\nWe chose a model with a cubic poly-\nnomial because past research, which in-\ncluded the NHANES I data, showed that\n(over the adult life span) the change in\nBMI with age is convex and can be well\ncharacterized by a third-degree poly-\nnomial or less.11 Using the resulting lo-\ngistic regression equations, the prob-\nability of being in each of these broad\nintervals was calculated for each age\nage, the probability of being in each in-\nteger-defined BMI category was calcu-\nlated as the moving average of all the\nbroader BMI bins containing the inte-\nger-defined BMI category of interest.\nThese smoothed proportions were used\nto represent the probability of being in\na given BMI category at each age.\nThird, also using NHANES III data,\nwe estimated the mean BMI within each\nBMI category for each race and sex\ngroup. This was simply estimated as the\nobserved arithmetic mean within each\nsex by race by BMI category grouping.\nThe HR for BMI Levels\nin Each Year of Adult Life\nTo estimate the HR for death at a\ngiven BMI level in each year of adult\nlife, we combined data from the First\nNational Health and Nutrition Epide-\nmiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS)\nand the NHANES II Mortality Study\nThe NHEFS is a national longitudinal\nstudythatwasdesignedtoinvestigatethe\nrelationships between clinical, nutri-\ntional,andbehavioralfactorsassessedin\nNHANES I and II and subsequent mor-\nbidity,mortality,andhospitaluse,aswell\naschangesinriskfactors,functionallimi-\ntation, and institutionalization.12 The\nNHEFS includes all persons aged 25 to\n74yearswhocompletedamedicalexami-\nall the participants, 96% have been suc-\ncessfully traced at some point through\nThe NH2MS cohort is composed of\nthe time of their NHANES II examina-\nTwo participants were unable to be fol-\nlowed-up because of incomplete per-\nsonal identifying data and are consid-\nered lost to follow-up. The NH2MS\ncohort members were tracked through\ncontaining mortality and cause-of-\ndeath information. The 2 datasets were\ncombined to increase sample size and\nprecision of estimates.\nUsingthesedata,Coxregressionmod-\nels were used with mortality as the out-\ncome and BMI, BMI2, age, age2, and their\ninteraction terms as covariates. Poten-\ntial age, race, and sex interactions were\naccounted for by fitting separate mod-\nels to each race and sex group. Interac-\ntions of BMI and BMI2 with age2 were\nnot used because prior research indi-\ncated that change in the BMI param-\neters appears to be roughly linear in\nage.13 In addition, removal of such terms\ngreatlyreducedcollinearity.Despitethis,\nthere may be some collinearity, particu-\nlarly among variables such as age and\nage2. However, this is not a major con-\ncern in this situation because collinear-\nity will increase the variance of the co-\nefficients,butwillnotbiastheparameter\nestimatesortheoverallpredictions.Prior\nto estimating the Cox regression model,\nBMI was transformed to BMI inverse\n(1/BMI). We chose inverted BMI as a\npredictor instead of BMI because prior\nresearch has shown that inverted BMI\nis more suitable for modeling the con-\nvex but asymmetrical relationship be-\ntween BMI and mortality.14,15 Within ev-\nery sex and age group examined in\nNHANES III, inverted BMI was more\nhighly correlated with body fat than was\nBMI.16 Smoking status (defined as cur-\nrent, former, never, or unknown) was\ncontrolled for in all analyses. Using the\nresulting equation, we calculated the es-\ntimated HR for each BMI category at\neach age interval by substituting the\nmean BMI in each BMI category for the\nBMI in the equation and the midpoint\n19-year-olds) for age in the equation. As\na sensitivity analysis, we also calcu-\nlated the estimated HRs across the cat-\negories of BMI using the sample weights\nthat account for the complex sampling\ndesign of NHEFS and NH2MS. These\nweightedestimateswereextremelysimi-\nlar to the unweighted estimates and\nwhen they differed, the HRs for obesity\nwere higher with than without weight-\ning, suggesting that our results may be\nconservative.\nTo test the proportionality assump-\ntion, Schoenfeld residuals were com-\nputed for each variable in the model.\nWhen the proportionality assumption is\nmet, Schoenfeld residuals should be in-\ndependent of survival time. Therefore,\nwe plotted these residuals against sur-\nvival time for each independent vari-\nable involving BMI (ie, BMI; BMI2;\nBMIage; BMI2age) and also com-\nputedthatSpearmannonparametriccor-\nrelation between these residuals and\nsurvival time. This was performed sepa-\nrately for each of the 4 sex and race\ngroups. In each group, all 4 plots gave\nno indication of a nonrandom pattern\nof association. Moreover, across all 4\nvariables in all 4 groups, the largest\nSpearman r2 for the correlation with\nsurvival time was less than 0.5% of the\nvariance. Thus, there is substantial evi-\ndence for the validity of the proportion-\nality assumption.

The probability of death within\nthe interval conditional on having lived\nto the start of that interval and being\nin a given BMI category was also esti-\nmated. For a person of a given age in a\ngiven BMI category, we estimated their\nexpected age of death (operationally de-\nfined as the median age of death for a\nperson with their starting age and BMI).\nFinally, the YLL for a person of a given\nage in a given BMI category is the dif-\nference relative to being in the refer-\nence category (ie, BMI=24). A BMI of\n24 was chosen as the reference cat-\negory because it represents the upper\nbound of desirable weight.\nRESULTS\nThe YLL due to obesity estimates for\neach sex and race group (compared\nFIGURE 1 and FIGURE 2. A complete\ntabulation of the YLL estimates across\nthe entire range of BMI is posted on our\nWeb site (http://www.soph.uab.edu\n/statgenetics/Research/Tables/YLL\n.htm). Among whites, the overall\npattern suggests a J- or U-shaped asso-\nciation. For example, YLL would be\n1 to 9 in individuals with low BMIs\nwith high BMIs (35). White men aged\nestimated to have 13 YLL relative to\nwhite men aged 20 years with BMIs of\n24. A similar, although less pro-\nnounced pattern occurs throughout the\nupper range of BMI (Figure 1). Among\nwhite women, the pattern shows less\nvariability across the range of BMI dis-\ntribution as a function of age. White\ngreater than 45 are estimated to have\n8 YLL due to obesity (Figure 1).\nThe overall pattern of findings among\nblacks was somewhat different. Among\nblack men, estimated YLL due to obe-\nsity did not begin for any age group un-\ntil a BMI of 32 was reached. Obesity ap-\npeared to be associated with a slightly\nincreased life expectancy across much\nof the moderate obesity range for the\nwas the maximum YLL found among\nblack men aged 20 years with BMIs\ngreater than 45 (Figure 2). The maxi-\nmum YLL for black women aged 20\nyears with BMIs greater than 45 was 5\n(Figure 2).\nCOMMENT\ntion-baseddatatoderiveestimatesofthe\nBMI distribution for each year of adult\nlife, as well as the HR for death for each\nBMI category in each year of adult life,\nwe found that obesity has a profound\neffect on life span. That is, mirroring the\nassociation between BMI and mortal-\nity, a J- or U-shaped association be-\ntween BMI and YLL at all ages was ob-\nserved. Moreover, the optimal BMI (ie,\nthe BMI associated with the greatest lon-\ngevity) for adults aged 18 to 85 years is\nA 20-year-old white male with a BMI\nYLL due to obesity. Assuming a life ex-\npectancy of 78 years, this translates into\na 17% reduction in total life expec-\ntancy. When one considers that a 20-\nyear-old white male is expected to live\ndue to obesity actually represents a 22%\nreduction in remaining years of life.\nWhite women aged 20 years with BMIs\ngreater than 45 are estimated to have 8\nYLL due to obesity, which is a 10% re-\nduction in total life expectancy. Assum-\ning 61 years of life remaining for a 20-\nyear-old woman, an 8-year reduction\ndue to obesity actually represents a 13%\nreduction in remaining years of life.\nThus, our findings suggest that obesity\nhas a marked effect on the life span of\nwhites,andthattheriskofincreasedYLL\nwas greatest at younger ages.\nThe pattern of findings among blacks\nwas somewhat different. Obesity was as-\nsociated with only slightly increased life\nexpectancy across much of the over-\nweight and moderate obesity range for\nmost age groups. A consistent reduc-\ntion in expected life expectancy was not\nreached. The maximum YLL was 20\namong black men aged 20 years with\nduction based on a life expectancy of\nmaining years of life. Given the small\nsample size of black men with ex-\ntremely high BMIs, it is worth consid-\nering the more conservative estimate\nobtained among black men with BMIs\nin total life expectancy and a 22% re-\nduction in remaining years of life.\nAmong black women aged 20 years\nwith BMIs greater than 45, the YLL was\n5, which is a 6.6% reduction in total life\nduction in remaining years of life. De-\nspite the different pattern of findings\nfrom whites, we also observed that YLL\nwere greatest at younger ages.\nIn one respect, our findings run\ncounter to those reported by Stevens et\nal8 in that the YLL attributable to obe-\nsity increased with age, but declined for\nthose in the oldest decade (70-79 years).\nA possible explanation for the diver-\ngent findings is that we estimated YLL\nacross the remaining years of life while\nStevens et al restricted the analyses to\na 12-year period using data from the\nCancer Prevention Study I. This ap-\nproach may have led to both an under-\nestimation of YLL and a spurious posi-\ntive association between baseline age\nand YLL. This is because the method\nof estimating YLL used by Stevens et al\ndefined the observed YLL to be zero for\nall subjects who did not die within the\nduration of the study. This results in an\noverall underestimation of YLL be-\ncause those individuals who will die be-\nfore the median life span for their de-\nmographic group (ie, would have an\nYLL 0), but did not die during the\nstudy, are coded as YLL=0. Moreover,\nyounger individuals (independent of\nBMI) are less likely to die than older\npeople within any defined period. This\npresumption results in a greater un-\nderestimation for younger rather than\nolder individuals and potentially leads\nto a spurious positive correlation be-\ntween YLL and age. Our YLL esti-\nFigure 1. Years of Life Lost Among White Men and Women\nYears of Life Lost\nWhite Men\nBody Mass Index\nYears of Life Lost\nWhite Women\nAge, y\nmates also seem markedly higher than\nthose obtained by Stevens et al who con-\nsidered all levels of obesity as a single\nclass (ie, BMI 30) so the results are\nnot easily compared directly with ours.\nNevertheless, the YLL associated with\nobesity did not exceed 1 for any age or\nsex group considered.\nThere was some difference in the pat-\ntern of findings in YLL due to obesity\nbetween whites and blacks. This is ac-\ntually consistent with what has been ob-\nserved regarding the association be-\ntween BMI and mortality between these\nblack women who were members of the\nKaiser Foundation Health Plan and\nwere followed-up for 15 years, Wien-\npahl et al18 found an essentially flat as-\nsociation between BMI and mortality\nacross the entire range of BMI. Other\nlar results, which suggests that the effect\nof a given BMI increase on mortality rate\nmay be different and sometimes less del-\neterious among blacks relative to\nwhites.\nA recent review17 of the literature on\nthe association between BMI and mor-\ntality in blacks indicates that obesity re-\nsulted in a smaller increase in mortal-\nity among blacks compared with whites.\nUsing data from the Cancer Preven-\ntion Study II, a J- or U-shaped pattern\nbetween BMI and relative rates of mor-\ntality among whites was obtained. In\ncontrast, the pattern among black men\nand women suggests that the only cat-\negory in which the relative mortality\nrate is consistently and substantially el-\nevated is among black women with\nAt least 4 possible explanations may\naccount for the differential relation-\nship between moderately high levels of\nBMI, mortality, and YLL across races.\nFirst, the true causal effect of BMI on\nmortality rate may differ between blacks\nand whites. Second, blacks and whites\nmay be exposed to different compet-\ning risks for mortality and this may\nFigure 2. Years of Life Lost Among Black Men and Women\nBlack Women\nBody Mass Index\nYears of Life Lost\nBlack Men\nYears of Life Lost\nAge, y\naffect the outcome.23 That is, distribu-\ntions of age, health status, socioeco-\nnomic status, and other variables that\ncan affect mortality rate may differ by\nrace and this can affect the estimated\nHR which, in turn, influences the YLL\nestimates. For example, homicide is the\nleading cause of death among blacks\naged 15 to 34 years, and the third lead-\ning cause of potential YLL.24 Thus, it is\npossiblethathomicides,acauseofdeath\npresumably independent of BMI, may\ndisproportionately account for excess\ndeaths among blacks, particularly\nmales, thereby altering the influence of\nobesity on YLL estimates. Third, there\nmay be different distributions of con-\nfounding variables among blacks com-\npared with whites. Fourth, the critical\nvariable may be body composition, not\nBMI, and the relationship between me-\ntabolism, BMI, and body composition\n(central adiposity) may differ by race,\npotential explanations are neither mu-\ntually exclusive nor exhaustive.\nWe also observed some sex differ-\nences in the association between obe-\nsity and YLL. On the whole, indepen-\ndent of race, men were at increased YLL\nrisk. Among white men, the increased\nYLL risk was generally more uniform\nacross age than it was for white women.\nThis is consistent with Stevens et al,8\nwho also found that YLL was higher\namong men than women with compa-\nrable BMIs.\nThe results of this study should be in-\nterpreted in light of several limitations.\nAlthoughelevatedBMIistheprimaryin-\ndex of obesity used in most studies, it is\na proxy of adiposity and may not pro-\nvide the best estimate of the association\nbetween obesity and outcomes such as\nmortality or YLL. Body mass index in-\nvolves fat mass and fat-free mass, so its\nusemaymaskanydifferentialhealthcon-\nsequences associated with fat mass and\nfat-free mass,27-30 which suggests that fu-\nture studies should obtain not only BMI,\nbut direct measures of body composi-\ntion as well.\nDue to insufficient sample size, the\nassociation between obesity and YLL\ncould not be reliably estimated for other\nracial/ethnic groups, including Mexi-\ncan-Americans and Pacific-Islander\nAmericans, groups that are known to\nhave high prevalences of overweight\nand obesity. Until databases of suffi-\ncient size are available for these racial\ngroups, the association between BMI\nand YLL will remain unknown.\nA related issue concerns the rela-\ntively small sample size of individuals in\nthe upper BMI categories. We chose to\ncollapse the upper BMI categories at 45\nor greater, as opposed to some other cut\npoint because of the increasing propor-\ntion of individuals with BMIs above 40\nandthemarkedlyacceleratedincreasein\nmortality rate for individuals with high\nrelative sparseness of data in the upper\nBMI categories may have rendered YLL\nestimates imprecise, we reversed the or-\nder of the pi's for the upper BMI catego-\nries for white men and black women to\nevaluate the extent to which this influ-\nencedYLLestimates.Lessthan1%ofthe\nYLL estimates for white men in the up-\nper BMI categories were altered, and in\nallof these cases, the changes were mini-\nmal(ie,\u00b11year).Forblackwomen,there\nweremorechanges(approximately8%),\nbut the magnitude of these changes on\nYLL estimates were small (\u00b11 year).\nThus, although sample sizes in the up-\nper BMI categories were modest, our re-\nsultsappeartobequiterobusttoanymis-\nestimation of the frequency distribution\nof BMI at the upper end of the BMI con-\ntinuum.\nAlthough an estimate of YLL due to\nobesity is interesting and important, it\nis only 1 consequence of obesity. A re-\ncent review33 indicates that obesity sig-\nnificantly impairs quality of life, argu-\nably a more potent marker of the effect\nof obesity because quality-of-life defi-\ncits are experienced in the moment\nrather than anticipated sometime in the\nfuture.\nWe controlled for smoking status as\na potential confounder of the associa-\ntion between BMI and YLL. Specifi-\ncally, we categorized individuals as cur-\nrent, former, or never smokers, and\nunknown. The number of cigarettes\nsmoked was not taken into account be-\ncause of the limitation of the data. We\nalso did not consider that changes in\nsmoking prevalence are occurring over\ntime. Given that smoking affects both\nbodyweightandmortalityrate,thismay\naffect the YLL associated with obesity\nat future time points. Thus, future re-\nsearchers may wish to reestimate YLL\nvalues at periodic intervals to see if\nchanges occur.\nWe also did not control for the pos-\nsible confounding effects of subclini-\ncal or occult disease. This is because it\nis unclear exactly how to control for\nsomething that is, by definition, unob-\nservable. Excluding individuals who\ndied early in follow-up (eg, 5 years)\nto reduce confounding due to preex-\nistingdiseasehasbeenshowntobeinef-\nfective and possibly even exacerbat-\ncontextofBMIandYLLstudies,itispos-\nsible that preexisting occult disease\ncouldconfoundtheassociationbetween\nBMI and YLL and lead spuriously to a\ndiminution in the observed increase in\nYLL across the upper range of BMI. To\nthe extent that confounding due to\noccult disease exists, our YLL esti-\nmates are likely to be underestimates.\nOur YLL calculations assume that an\nindividual'sBMIremainsconstantacross\nage. We sought to address the ques-\ntion: Given that an individual has a BMI\nof 37, for example, how much longer\nwould he/she be expected to live if the\nBMI was 24? This is different than ad-\ndressing the question: Given that an in-\ndividual has a BMI of 37, for example,\nandgainsorlosesweightatthesamerate\nas others with BMIs of 37, for example,\nhow much longer would he/she be ex-\npected to live if the BMI was 24 and\ngained or lost weight at the same rate as\nothers with BMIs of 24? The former\nquestion is more germane to public\nhealth and clinical communication.\nGiven that we used information from\n3 separate and different data sets in our\ncalculation procedure, we were un-\nable to provide confidence intervals for\nour YLL estimates. We are unaware of\nany developed analytic formula that\nwould allow easy calculation of SEs and\nconfidence intervals. Computer-\nintensive sampling procedures could be\nused, but that is a topic for future re-\nsearch. It is likely that our YLL esti-\nmates will be least precise when there\nis less data such as among blacks and\namong extremely obese individuals.\nFinally, we did not determine statis-\ntical power a priori. Although, given our\nsample size, this is not a limitation per\nse for most of our analyses, it should\nbe noted that as one moves to the ex-\ntremes of the distribution of predictor\nvariables under study, fewer data are\navailable and estimates become less\nstable, and the HRs can substantially in-\nfluence estimates of YLL. Therefore, it\nwill be useful for future research to rep-\nlicate and refine the results herein us-\ning larger data sets, particularly among\nnonwhites.\nThere are also several strengths of the\nstudy. We used large nationally repre-\nsentative samples to derive our esti-\nmates of BMI distribution and HR of\ndeath across the life span. We also used\nan analytic approach that generated YLL\nestimates for each remaining year of life\nalong the range of BMI. Moreover, our\nYLL estimates are likely conservative\nbecause we did not exclude cohort\nmembers (eg, ever smokers, weight\nfluctuators).\nOur results confirm that obesity is a\nmajorpublichealthproblemthatappears\ntolessenlifeexpectancymarkedly,espe-\ncially among individuals in younger age\ngroups.
