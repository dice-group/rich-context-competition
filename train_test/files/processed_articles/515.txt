Pediatrics 2011;\nINTRODUCTION\nYouth in the juvenile correctional system are a high-risk population1\u00ad3\nwho, in many cases, have unmet physical, developmental, and mental\nhealth needs. Multiple studies have found that some of these health\nissues occur at higher rates than in the general adolescent popula-\ntion.3,4\u00ad6 Although some youth in the juvenile justice system have inter-\nfaced with health care providers in their community on a regular basis,\nothers have had inconsistent or nonexistent care. The health needs of\nthese youth are commonly identified when they are admitted to a juve-\nnile custodial facility. On-site correctional health care providers must\nnot only try to identify these health issues but also determine if there\nhas been active medical management in the community. Pediatricians\nand other health care providers play an important role in the care of\nthese youth, and continuity between the community and the correc-\ntional facility is crucial.\nTwo-thirds of those arrested were referred to juvenile court, and 10%\nwere referred to the adult criminal court system. One-third of all juve-\nniles arrested were female. Gender differences exist in patterns of\narrest-related charges such that adolescent girls are more likely to\nhave runaway and prostitution/vice offenses, whereas boys have a\njuvenile justice, correctional health care, juvenile detention,\nmental health, substance abuse, reproductive health, financing\nof health care\nABBREVIATIONS\nSES--socioeconomic status\nTBI--traumatic brain injury\nTB--tuberculosis\nSYRP--Survey of Youth in Residential Placement\nNCCHC--National Commission on Correctional Health Care\nSTI--sexually transmitted infection\nCDC--Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nThis document is copyrighted and is property of the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics and its Board of Directors.

Girls are also more likely\nthan adolescent boys to fight with fam-\nily members and become involved in\ndomestic disturbances.8 Racial differ-\nences were seen in juvenile arrest\npatterns. Although black youth only\nold population in the United States,\nthey represented 52% of the Violent\nCrime Index arrests and 33% of the\nProperty Crime Index arrests (see\nTable 1). The greatest racial dispari-\nties were seen with some of the most\nserious crimes--murder, robbery,\nand assault.9\nReasons for these racial disparities\nare complex and involve social context\nas well as individual characteristics\nand are not well understood. When\ncomparing minority youth to white\nyouth, differing opinions exist about\nthe relative contributions of several\nfactors including possible differential\ninvolvement in various offenses and in-\nequalities in the treatment of minority\nyouth compared with white youth once\nwithin the juvenile justice system.10\nYouth arrests and delinquent behavior\nhave been related to lower socioeco-\nnomic status (SES), family disruption\n(marital separation, divorce), living in\nhouseholds with only 1 biological par-\nent, less residential stability (length of\ntime living in 1 location), poorer neigh-\nborhood collective efficacy (capacity of\nresidents to achieve social control\nover the environment), and educa-\ntional failure.11\u00ad13 Overall, poverty is\nlikely to be the underlying factor that\nmost influences trends in juvenile\nSES plays a significant role for black\nand Hispanic youth, because they are\nmore likely to live in poverty than their\nwhitecounterparts.13 Educationalfailure\niscorrelatedwithunemployment/under-\nemployment. Studies have found that\nemployment can prevent or reduce de-\nlinquent behavior. Lower educational\nattainment is most likely to affect\nblack and Hispanic youth, who have\nhigher dropout rates than their white\ncounterparts.13 Family structure influ-\nences youth socialization and the capa-\nbility to control the youth's behavior.12\nFamily structure, itself, is not the\ncause of a youth's behavior. Rather it is\nlinked to other factors, as illustrated\nby the correlation between single-\nparent households and increased\nprobability of living in poverty.13 Black\nyouth are most likely to be living in a\nsingle-parent household, and Hispanic\nyouth are less likely than white youth\nto be living with both parents.13\nNot all juvenile arrests result in a cus-\ntodial placement in either a short-term\ndetention facility (usually 3 months)\nawaiting adjudication or a longer-term\npostadjudication residential facility.\nCustody rates are higher for male ad-\nolescents than female adolescents.\nGirls are more likely to be held for\ntechnical violations, such as violating\nthe terms of probation, or status of-\nfenses, such as running away, rather\nthan more serious illegal activities9\n(see Table 1). Data on custody rates\nare similar to data on arrest rates,\nwhich demonstrate disproportionate\ncontact of minority youth with law en-\nforcement. Although minority youth\nrepresent only 39% of the US juvenile\npopulation, they represented 65% of\nthe national juvenile custody popula-\nticularly relevant when considering\nunmet mental and physical health\nneeds, because poorer health status is\nrelated to lower SES, and lower SES is\nmore likely to be found among minor-\nity youth (see \"Sociodemographic Fac-\ntors and Health Status\").\nplacement was 65 days, including both\nshort-term and long-term facilities.\nEighty percent of postadjudicated\nyouth were in the facility for at least 30\ndays, and 57% were in the facility for at\nleast 90 days. Twelve percent were still\nin placement at 1 year.9 A significant\nnumber of youth are incarcerated for\na period of time that would permit\nhealth care providers to diagnose, as-\nsess, and treat them for identified\nhealth problems.\nThe categories of health needs of youth\nin the correctional system are similar\nto those of their peers in the commu-\nnity. They include dermatologic, respi-\nratory, dental, gastrointestinal, genito-\nurinary, and metabolic problems as\nwell as developmental and mental\nhealth issues. Other categories are in-\nfluenced, in part, by the youth's en-\ngagement in high-risk behaviors such\nas violence, substance abuse, and sex-\nual activity, which may be more preva-\nlent than those of their peers in the\ngeneral population.5,14 Some health is-\nsues result from living in impover-\nished and abusive environments (eg,\ntraumatic brain injury [TBI], lead expo-\nsure, positive tuberculosis [TB] test re-\nsults, and poor dental care). Others\nare acquired health problems (eg, hy-\nTABLE 1 Definitions of Crimes, Offenses, and\nViolations\nViolent Crime Index\nMurder and nonnegligent manslaughter\nForcible rape\nRobbery\nAggravated assault\nProperty Crime Index\nBurglary\nLarceny-theft\nMotor vehicle theft\nArson\nStatus offense: an offense that is illegal for a\nminor but would not be criminal if\ncommitted by an adult\nRunaway\nTruancy\nCurfew violation\nUnderage drinking\nTechnical violation: violation of a court order\nProbation violation\nCurfew violation\npertension, diabetes) that are ne-\nglected or remain undiagnosed.15 In\nsome instances, youth have had inade-\nquate health care, because they have\nbeen runaways or living in inconsis-\ntent living situations that do not allow\nfor continuity of care.\nUnderlying the poorer health status of\nyouth in the juvenile justice system is\nSES. Just as lower SES is correlated\nwith juvenile delinquency, lower SES--\nspecifically, income inequality--has\nbeen shown to correlate with teen\nbirths, overweight, and mental health\nproblems.16 Minority youth, including\nblack and Hispanic youth, who are\noverrepresented in the juvenile justice\nsystem in the United States, are more\nlikely to live in lower-SES environments\nand have been found to have overall\npoorer health care than their white\ncounterparts. Studies have shown sig-\nnificant disparities between white and\nminority youth aged 0 through 17\nyears in insurance coverage, lack of a\nusual source of care, use of the emer-\ngency department, and not receiving\nadequate mental health care, dental\ncare, or prescription medications.17\nFactors other than SES may also be\nimportant. A recent review of the liter-\nature confirmed racial/ethnic dispa-\nrities in adolescent health care. How-\never, the results also suggested that\nsome disparities are not totally under-\nstood and seem to be independent of\nFew studies have provided a broad na-\ntional perspective on the health needs\nof youth in the juvenile correctional\nsystem in the United States. The most\nrecently published information is from\nthe Survey of Youth in Residential\nPlacement (SYRP).3 The findings in this\nreport are based on interviews with a\nnationally representative sample of\nobtained by using audio computer-\nassisted self-interview methodology\nand included youth at both short-term\ndetention and longer-term residential\ntreatment facilities. The survey re-\nvealed high rates of mental health and\nsubstance abuse problems as well as\ntraumatic experiences with docu-\nmented rates that exceeded those of\nthe general adolescent population.\nMore than two-thirds of youth in this\nsurvey reported a health care need, in-\ncluding injury, problems with vision or\nhearing, dental needs, or \"other\nillness.\"\nAlthough more than 20 years old, an-\nother study with a national scope was\nmission on Correctional Health Care\nyouth from 39 short-term or long-term\ncorrectional facilities in the United\nStates. These youth had higher rates of\nsubstance abuse, trauma, unpro-\ntected sexual activity, history of sexu-\nally transmitted infections (STIs), sui-\ncidal ideation, and reported violence\nthan those in a general high school\npopulation.\nIn the following sections, the data re-\ngarding general physical health issues\nare reviewed, and mental health and\nsubstance use/abuse diagnoses are\naddressed.\nISSUES\nIn addition to the SYRP and NCCHC\nstudies, 3 other studies that involved\neither a single facility or a region have\nprovided important information. Two\nstudies similarly found that approxi-\nmately half of youth in these facilities\nhad an identified medical problem. The\nfirst study, the results of which were\nmitted during an 11-year period to a\nsecure detention facility in New York15;\nthe second study, the results of which\nfrom 15 detention and longer-term fa-\ncilities in the Maryland Juvenile Jus-\ntice System.19 The third study involved\nyouth admitted to a detention center in\nthat although most youth (76.9%) de-\nnied preexisting conditions or com-\nplaints at the time of admission, 10.6%\nhad a medical condition that required\nmedical follow-up after release.20\nThere are a few specific health con-\ncerns that require particular attention\nin this population.\nDental\nThe preponderance of dental needs\nwas documented in a 30-year-old study\nin a detention center in New York, in\nwhich almost all of the youth (90%) re-\nquired dental care.15 A more recent\nstudy of youth in a juvenile detention\ncenter in Dallas County, Texas, con-\nthat among a random sampling of 419\nolds, half of them had untreated de-\ncay and fewer than one-fifth had\npreventive sealants. High-urgency\ndental problems defined as infection,\ntooth or jaw fracture, pulpitis, or se-\nvere periodontal disease with bleed-\ning were found in 6.2% of the\nsubjects. Moderate-urgency condi-\ntions, including cavitated asymptom-\natic decay or moderate gingivitis\nwere found in 13.1%. One of the chal-\nlenges noted by the authors was the\ninability to provide comprehensive\ntreatment plans except in the case of\nlong-term detainees.\nInjury\nTraumatic injuries are commonly iden-\ninjuries are caused by multiple etiolo-\ngies that range from accidental to de-\nliberate. The Maryland study19 found\nthat almost one-fifth of the youth expe-\nrienced an injury including burns,\nhead trauma, and musculoskeletal\ninjury, and that 12% of these youth had\nnot had previous treatment. As demon-\nstrated in the NCCHC study, interper-\nsonal violence is an important cause of\ninjury in this population.5 Approxi-\nmately 70% of the surveyed youth had\nbeen involved in at least 1 fight during\nthe previous year, and one-quarter of\nthem had experienced an injury that\nrequired medical attention. Three-\nquarters of youth in the NCCHC study\nreported fights that involved a weapon.\nThere was a relationship between sub-\nstance use and physical fights, use of\nweapons, and gang membership.\nMore details are described in the re-\nport of a study from a secure residen-\ntial facility in North Carolina that exam-\nined the types of traumatic injuries\nyouth.22 More than half of the youth had\nan injury that required medical atten-\ntion. One-third of the injuries were re-\nlated to sports, 20% related to fights,\n13% self-inflicted, 9% related to sui-\ncide attempts, 8% vocational, 3% re-\nlated to horseplay, and 11% attributed\nto \"other.\" The most common trau-\nmatic injury was musculoskeletal\n(one-third). One-quarter of the injuries\nwere significant enough to necessitate\nreferral for further evaluation to an\noutside facility.\nA previous history of TBI is particularly\nsignificant in this population, because\nit can affect mental health and behav-\nioral issues. Studies of detained ado-\nlescents have found high rates of TBI.\nCompared with youth without TBI,\nthose with a positive history were\nmore likely to have a psychiatric di-\nagnosis, report earlier onset of crim-\ninal behavior and substance use,\nhave more lifetime substance use\nproblems, have more previous-year\ncriminal acts, report lifetime suicid-\nality, and demonstrate impulsivity or\nfearlessness in the year preceding\nTuberculosis\nResidents of correctional facilities\nhave among the highest rates of TB\ninfection and are housed in an envi-\nronment with an increased risk of\nexposure. For those reasons, it is\nrecommended that adolescents in cor-\nrectional facilities be screened annu-\nally for TB. A positive Mantoux skin test\nresult is considered to be 10 mm or\ngreater, which is a lower threshold\nthan that for an adolescent without ad-\nditional risk factors.25\nReproductive Health\nSexual Activity/Contraception\nthe best nationally representative\nsamples evaluating sexual activity and\ncontraceptive use among incarcer-\nated youth. The study used a survey\nmethod based on the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s\nYouth Risk Behavior Surveillance Sys-\ntem, which allowed for comparison\nwith a general high school population.\nIncarcerated youth reported higher\nrates of sexual activity and were more\nlikely to report 4 or more lifetime sex-\nual partners. Incarcerated youth also\nhad much lower self-reported use of\ncontraception or condoms at their\nmost recent sexual intercourse.\nTransmitted Disease Surveillance Re-\nport26 demonstrated that youth in the\njuvenile detention system have among\nthe highest rates of STIs (Table 2). Sim-\nilar data were collected in another\nstudy that represented 12 juvenile cor-\nrection facilities in 5 jurisdictions be-\nprotected sex with multiple partners,\nprostitution, or injection drug use,\nyouth in correctional facilities are also\nat increased risk of HIV and hepatitis C\nvirus infection. In addition, they are at\nrisk of hepatitis B virus infection when\nthe vaccination series is incomplete.\nHigh rates of STIs, alcohol and drug\nuse, and lack of consistent condom use\nalso contribute to increased risk of HIV\nAlthough the risk of STIs/HIV infection\nis high in incarcerated youth, many fa-\ncilities fail to screen for either STIs or\nthe Juvenile Residential Facility Cen-\nities offered STI testing for all adoles-\ncents on admission and that 8.3% of\nthe facilities did not even have STI test-\ning available. Some facilities only pro-\nvided STI testing services when re-\nquested by the youth or deemed\nmedically necessary, which is espe-\ncially problematic, because STIs are\ncommonly asymptomatic. Even fewer\nfacilities tested all youth for HIV or\nhepatitis C virus infection, and these\ntests were much less likely to be\navailable.35 One of the challenges as-\nsociated with HIV testing by tradi-\ntional methods is that it involves a\nblood draw and use of an outside lab-\noratory. Youth may refuse phlebot-\nomy and can be released from a\nshort-term detention setting before\nobtaining the results. Currently\navailable rapid HIV tests provide the\noption of a less invasive oral test and\ncan provide results within 20 min-\nutes while the youth waits. Providing\nopt-out HIV testing is recommended\nby the CDC as a part of routine health\ncare, even in correctional facilities.36\nTABLE 2 STI Rates Among Incarcerated\nDisease Overall Positivity, %\nFemale Male\nChlamydia data are from 83 juvenile detention facilities for\nwomen and 123 facilities for men. Gonorrhea data are\nfrom 71 juvenile detention facilities for women and 118\nfacilities for men.\nPregnancy/Fatherhood\nThe SYRP found that 14% of incarcer-\nated youth have children; males (15%)\nwere more likely to have fathered a\nchild compared with 9% of females\nwho reported having a child.37 This\nrate is much higher than that of the\nolds, in which 2% of males and 6% of\nfemales have children. In addition, 12%\nof incarcerated youth were expecting a\nchild.

Pregnancy among incarcerated\nteenagers is complicated by other ex-\nisting problems including substance\nabuse, posttraumatic stress disorder,\nprevious sexual abuse, and additional\nconsiderations regarding postdelivery\noptions.43 In addition to altered activity\nschedules and changes in menu op-\ntions related to the higher caloric re-\nquirements of pregnancy, postpartum\ndepression and other psychological\nproblems require particular attention.\nBecause most juvenile justice facilities\ndo not have arrangements for infant\nresidency or visitation, the adolescent\nand her family may be expected to\nmake a plan for foster care placement.\nOverview\nThe available literature indicates that\nthe prevalence of psychiatric and sub-\nstance abuse disorders among youth\nin correctional facilities exceeds that\nof the general adolescent popula-\nthe mean prevalence of psychiatric\ndisorders in the general adolescent\n41.3%). In comparison, prevalence\nrates in the juvenile justice population\ntive behavior disorders are included.47\nInclusion of disruptive behavior disor-\nders, such as conduct disorder, in the\npsychiatric disorder prevalence esti-\nmates is controversial, because most\nteenagers would not be incarcerated\nunless they came to the attention of\nauthorities because of significant dis-\nruptive behaviors. To some extent, en-\ngaging in disruptive behavior is part of\nnormal adolescent development. Mul-\ntiple studies have found that most ad-\nolescents in the general population\nparticipate in behaviors that would be\nconsidered delinquent.48 These behav-\niors, which include imitation of antiso-\ncial models/styles and social rein-\nforcement, are usually transient. Most\nof the adolescent offenders (85%)\nknown to the criminal justice system\nstop offending by the age of 28 years.\nFurthermore, severe, persistent anti-\nsocial behavior over time is only found\nin approximately 5% of males.48\nThe wide range in the prevalence of\nmental health disorders among\nyouth in the juvenile justice system is\nindicative, in part, of the limitations\nof the studies in the literature. These\nlimitations include the use of non-\nstandardized measures and differ-\nent diagnostic tools; noncomparable\nsociodemographic variables; data that\nare not generalizable because they are\nspecific to an individual facility, state,\nor other locale; variation in the timing\nof the evaluation from the detention\nsetting to after adjudication; and\nbias when samples only include\nyouth referred for psychiatric evalu-\nconsider the fact that for some youth,\nwhen mental health resources in the\ncommunity are not sufficient, the juve-\nnile justice system may be the place-\nment of last resort by default.51\nPrevalence of Psychiatric and\nSubstance Use Disorders\nstudy was the only published study\nthat included a national sampling of\nmultiple juvenile custodial sites in the\nUnited States. In the NCCHC study, all of\nthe mental health and substance use\nbehaviors were self-reported through\na modified version of the CDC's Youth\nRisk Behavior Surveillance instrument.\nThe data from that survey are summa-\nrized in Table 3. The more recent SYRP\nstudy3 found that at least half of youth\nreported problems with anxiety, an-\nger, and loneliness, and approximately\none-fifth had a previous suicide at-\ntempt. In addition, only 56% of the gen-\nolds report a lifetime use of alcohol,\ncompared with 74% of youth in cus-\ntody, and only 40% of the general pop-\nulation has used any illegal drug com-\npared with 85% of youth in custody.\nDetails from the SYRP are summarized\nin Table 4.\nAlthough the NCCHC and SYRP reports\nhave provided information on youth\nfrom multiple sites across the United\nStates, these 2 studies are limited by\nonly providing information based on\nyouth self-report rather than from di-\nagnostic evaluation tools. Between\nstudies that were designed to elimi-\nnate some of the previous study-\ndesign problems were published. The\nauthors of these reports, Teplin et al,50\nCocozza,49 used randomly selected\nyouth; the Diagnostic Interview Sched-\nule for Children (DISC) as a standard-\nized screening and assessment instru-\nment; and included more ethnically/\nracially diverse samples. These\nstudies yielded a smaller prevalence\nther a psychiatric and/or substance\nuse disorder (see Tables 5 and 6). The\nstudies by Teplin et al50 and Shufelt and\nCocozza,49 specifically, were able to\nshow that the high rates of psychiatric\nillness were not just a reflection of dis-\nruptive behavior disorders. Both stud-\nies found similar results: 60.9% (Teplin\net al) and 66.3% (Shufelt and Cocozza)\nhad either a psychiatric or substance\nuse disorder when conduct disorder\nwas not included among the diagno-\nses. When Shufelt and Cocozza re-\nmoved substance abuse disorders\nfrom the analysis, 45.5% of the youth\nstill had a mental health diagnosis. In\ngeneral, substance abuse is concern-\ning, because youth who start using and\nabusing drugs during early adoles-\ncence are more likely to have serious\ndelinquency and longer deviant ca-\nreers, antisocial personality disorders\nlater in life, and more risk behaviors.\nOverall substance abuse is associated\nwith poor academic performance and\nmore psychiatric disorders.54\nMultiple studies worldwide have found\nthat youth with psychiatric diagnoses\ncan have more than 1 psychiatric diag-\nnosis (comorbidity) or co-occurring\npsychiatric and substance abuse dis-\nwith a psychiatric diagnosis had 2 or\nmore diagnoses. In another study with\nyouth in the juvenile justice system,\nMcClelland et al62 found that approxi-\nmately half of the youth had multiple\nsubstance use disorders; 80% of those\nwith an alcohol use disorder also\nabused other drugs, and half of those\nwith a drug disorder also abused alco-\nhol. Co-occurring psychiatric and sub-\nstance use disorders were found in the\nShufelt and Cocozza study, in which\n60.8% of those with a psychiatric diag-\nnosis also had a substance use disor-\nder. In that study, co-occurring sub-\nstance use and psychiatric disorders\nwere more common when there was a\nhistory of disruptive behaviors or\nsymptoms suggestive of mood disor-\nders. Because co-occurring major psy-\nchiatric and substance use disorders\nare common and develop in a close\ntime frame, more dual-diagnosis treat-\nment programs are needed to simulta-\nneously address both issues.\nRacial/Ethnic Differences\nRacial/ethnic differences in the diag-\nnosis of mental health disorders have\nbeen found in multiple studies. The\nwell-designed study by Teplin et al50\nfound that incarcerated black youth\nhave the lowest rate of mental health\ndiagnoses, non-Hispanic white youth\nhave the highest rate, and the rate for\nHispanic youth falls between that of\nthese 2 groups. However, as discussed\nin the literature, interpreting rates of\nmental health diagnoses and then\nevaluating racial/ethnic disparity\nwithin the juvenile justice system may\nbe problematic. Concern has been\nraised that minority youth may be\nmore likely to have their behavior in-\nterpreted as criminal rather than in\nneed of mental health service.47 In ad-\ndition, minority youth may be more re-\nluctant to admit to experiences with\nmental illness, or they or their families\nmay have a cultural bias against seek-\nTABLE 3 Mental Health and Substance Use Data From the 1991 NCCHC Study5\nCategory Male\nFemale\nTotal Sample\nSuicidal ideation previous year 19 40 --\nTried smoking -- -- 87\nSmoked whole cigarette by age 12 y -- -- 51\na Not all youth indicated gender on the survey.\nb Other illegal drugs used 10 or more times in lifetime: lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), ecstasy,\nhallucinogenic mushrooms, speed, ice, heroin, and pills without prescription.\nTABLE 4 Lifetime Substance Use Data From\nSubstance % of Youth\nin Custody\nMarijuana or hashish 84\nAcid or lysergic acid\ndiethylamide (LSD)\nGender Differences\nGender differences are also evident.\nFemales are more likely than males to\nhave any psychiatric diagnosis and,\nspecifically, to have higher rates of\nmood and anxiety disorders (Table 6).\nWith respect to substance use disor-\nders, in general, males and females\nhave similar rates, but the study by\nTeplin et al50 found that females are\nmore likely than males to use sub-\nstances other than alcohol and mari-\njuana. Although both genders experi-\nincluding emotional abuse, are more\ncommon in girls. As such, posttrau-\nmatic stress disorder is also more\ncommonly diagnosed in females. Long-\nterm outcomes for delinquent adoles-\ncent females reveal greater persis-\ntence of emotional problems and\nworse outcomes complicated by rela-\ntionship and parenting issues, drug\nproblems, and suicidality.65\nSuicide\nSuicide and suicidality have been a\nlong-standing concern for juveniles in\nrates of suicidal ideation among incar-\ncerated youth. In addition, 2 nationally\nrepresentative studies explored sui-\ncidality in more detail. One study, the\nresults of which were published in\ning cause of death in juvenile justice\nfacilities in the United States between\nteristics of Juvenile Suicide in Confine-\nment,\" described the results of a\nretrospective evaluation of all identifi-\nable juvenile deaths in confinement\nlated to suicide, the mechanism was\nhanging in all but 1 case. There were\nseveral important findings in this re-\nport. Sixty percent of the suicides oc-\ncurred between 3 PM and midnight,\nwhich included a time frame in which\nyouth were most likely to be around\nother people. Suicides were also most\ncommon during waking hours for\nthose confined to their rooms. In ad-\ndition, the potential for suicidality\namong these youth should have been\nrecognized by staff, because 70% had\nbeen assessed by a mental health pro-\nfessional--half of them within the pre-\nvious 6 days. Two-thirds of them had a\ndiagnosis of depression, and half were\ntaking a psychotropic medication. Sev-\nenty percent of the youth had a history\nof suicidal ideation, and almost half\nhad had a previous suicide attempt.\nPrecipitating factors were identified\nmore than half of the time and in-\ncluded fear of transfer or placement,\nrecent death of a family member, fail-\nure in the program, recent suicide in\nthe facility, and parental failure or\nthreats not to visit.\nRecent studies6,68 found that facilities\nwith suicide-prevention training and\nsuicide risk screening shortly after ad-\nmission to the facility had a lower sui-\ncide rate.

These\ncomponents include written protocols,\nintake screening, suicide-prevention\ntraining, safe housing, observation,\nmortality review, and cardiopulmo-\nnary resuscitation certification. The\nreport also discussed the need to fur-\nther evaluate room confinement, in-\ncluding the role of isolation in suicidal\nbehavior.\nTABLE 5 Design of Selected Studies That Evaluated Psychiatric and Substance Use Diagnoses in\nAuthor Year Conducted Location No. of\nSubjects\nCenter\nplacement\nprograms and facilities\nTABLE 6 Estimated Rates of Mental Health Disorders in Incarcerated Youth From Studies\nDisorder Rate Males % Rate Females %\nAll subcategories under the \"any\" headings are from refs 50, 52, and 53.

However,\nas summarized by Desai et al,44 2 stud-\nies representing data from 2 states\nfound that psychotropic medications\nwere used for approximately half of\nthe youth in detention facilities and\nmore than two-thirds of youth in\nlonger-term facilities. The fact that the\nmajority of youth are prescribed these\nmedications emphasizes the need for\npsychiatric services to appropriately\ndiagnose and manage these youth.\nMental health services are needed at\nthe time of admission to a correctional\nfacility for youth who are already on\npsychotropic medications and to eval-\nuate youth who may need to initiate\nmedications. In addition, subsequent\nevaluation is needed to decide\nwhether ongoing use is needed during\nconfinement. Attitudes of the parents\nand youth need to be considered when\nprescribing these medications, and\ncontinuity of care between community\nprescribing physicians and the juve-\nnile justice facility is crucial.\nThe American Academy of Child and Ad-\nolescent Psychiatry has published a\ndocument that addresses mental\nhealth assessment and treatment for\nyouth in the correctional system.69 In\nthis document, the authors recom-\nmend that psychotropic medication\nshould only be used as part of an indi-\nvidually developed comprehensive\ntreatment plan. Medication should\naugment other treatment interven-\ntions including individual, group, and\nfamily therapy along with behavioral\ninterventions such as regular exer-\ncise, improved sleep hygiene, and\nstaff/family support. The need for pre-\nviously prescribed medications should\nbe assessed on the basis of current\nsymptoms and level of functioning.\nNew medications should be used cau-\ntiously after review of potential risks\nand benefits, adverse effects, and al-\nternatives with both the youth and the\nparent/guardian when the youth is a\nminor.\nIdeally, youth with mental health and\nsubstance abuse problems would be\nidentified and treated in the commu-\nnity rather than being first identified\nand addressed within the juvenile jus-\ntice system. One recent study found\nthat improvement in mental health\nservices could reduce involvement\nwith the juvenile justice system, partic-\nularly among youth with the most seri-\nthat substance use screening before\nadmission to detention might allow\ncommunity diversion of some youth,\noptimize treatment choice, and mini-\nmize restrictive detention. However,\noptimal screening procedures have\nnot been established, and many com-\nmunities have limited availability of\npsychiatric and substance abuse\nservices.\nTo better address the mental health\nneeds of youth in the juvenile justice\nsystem, a panel of experts72 was con-\nvened to create guidelines and a road\nmap for best practices in the juvenile\njustice setting. The recommendations\nincluded a (1) valid and reliable mental\nhealth screening within 24 hours of ad-\nmission, (2) a more extensive assess-\nment by a mental health professional\nas soon as possible to determine\nneeds, (3) use of multiple sources of\ninformation (records, family, schools,\netc), (4) rescreening before release\nand preparation for transition out\nof custody, and (5) regular repeat\nscreenings while in custody. These rec-\nommendations are consistent with ex-\nisting standards from the NCCHC.\nOne of the commonly used screening\ntools for mental health and substance\nabuse specifically developed for the ju-\nvenile justice system is the Massachu-\nsetts Youth Screening Instrument\u00ad\nSecond Version (MAYSI-2). This 52-item\nscreening instrument takes 10 min-\nutes to complete and is validated as a\nself-report response tool that requires\nno clinical expertise to administer,\nscore, or interpret; is low cost and can\nbe used by a range of ages, different\nethnic groups, and both genders; and\nhas good psychometric properties.73\nThis tool can be completed by using\naudio computer-assisted technology\nfor youth who have literacy problems.\nThe MAYSI-2 is designed as a screening\ntool only, and staff trained in mental\nhealth should be available for further\nassessment. This tool should never\ntake the place of well-trained staff who\ncan recognize symptoms of mental\nhealth disorders and substance use\nwithdrawal.\nThere is no standardized approach\nused in the juvenile justice system to\nscreen for substance use/abuse. It is\nimportant to screen for the use or\nabuse of alcohol, tobacco, and the\ngamut of other drugs, including illicit,\nprescription, and nonproprietary sub-\nstances. Possible methods include\nself-report, which is the least expen-\nsive method but requires youth to un-\nderstand the questions and have accu-\nrate recall and honest disclosure.\nBioassays with urine or hair are most\ncommonly used by detention facilities\nand are easy to collect. However, al-\nthough these tests provide objective\ndata, urine is only sensitive for most\ndrugs used in the previous 2 to 3 days.\nHair analysis has significant problems\nincluding external contamination,\nwhich can lead to false-positive results\nand differences in binding for different\ndrugs and with different types of\nSpecific screening for substance use\nwas addressed in a recent report from\nthe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delin-\nnile facilities screened all youth for\nsubstance abuse, and 19% reported no\nscreening. An additional 20% only\nscreened youth identified by court or\nprobation officers or facility staff.\nOther reasons to assess were if they\nhad drug- or alcohol-related charges\nor by parent/youth request. Approxi-\nmately one-third of the youth were\nscreened on the day of admission, and\nanother one-third were screened 1 to 7\ndays after admission. Three-quarters\nof the facilities that conducted screen-\nings used staff-administered ques-\ntions, and 55% used self-report by\nstandardized instruments or checklist\ninventories. Overall, 73% of the facili-\nties used urine-based drug screening;\nhowever, one-third of all facilities only\ntested a subset of admitted youth or\nonly when use was suspected or a re-\nquest was made by the court or proba-\ntion officer.\nThe decision to initiate or change med-\nical treatment of psychiatric disorders\nin detention is challenging,74 but acute\nsymptoms may need to be treated with\nsome urgency. Medications should be\nused to manage symptoms and mini-\nmize distress but not to manage be-\nhaviors alone. As discussed in the\npractice parameter from the American\nAcademy of Child and Adolescent Psy-\nchiatry, it is ideal to determine the\nyouth's legal disposition and place-\nment before initiating or changing\nmedication regimens.69 Unlike in\nlonger-term, postadjudication facili-\nties, the length of stay in detention is\nusually too short for most counseling\ninterventions to treat major psychiat-\nric disorders. However, trained per-\nsonnel can provide observational data,\nand short-term counseling interven-\ntions can provide support and facili-\ntate the use of problem-solving strate-\ngies to prevent problem-escalating\ninterpersonal behaviors. A more exten-\nsive evaluation may also be required\nbefore making a disposition to resi-\ndential or community-based mental\nhealth treatment. Family involvement\nis critical at that stage, because it is\nthe key determinant of treatment en-\ngagement and success. Whenever the\nyouth is returning to the community,\nan essential part of the disposition is\nto include identification of a behavioral\nhealth home and care plan.\nported mental health evaluation data\nhad in-house mental health profes-\nsionals who evaluated all admitted\nyouth. Another one-third evaluated\nsome youth. Facilities that provided\nmental health treatment on-site were\nmore likely to also have a mental\nhealth professional evaluate all the\nyouth. Larger facilities were more\nlikely than smaller ones to screen all\nyouth for suicide risk and to evaluate\nall youth for mental health needs. Pri-\nvately operated facilities (62%) were\nmore likely to evaluate all youth than\nwere public facilities (41%).\nTwo-thirds of the facilities that re-\nported substance abuse services pro-\nvided them on-site; the majority (97%)\nof them provided drug education, and\ntwo-thirds provided individual or\ngroup therapy with a substance abuse\ntreatment professional. However, it\nwas also common (60%) for the coun-\nseling to be provided by someone not\nspecifically trained in substance abuse\ntreatment. Only 2 of 10 facilities had\nongoing specialized treatment for sub-\nstance abuse, and 1 in 10 had no sub-\nstance abuse treatment services. Most\nfacilities used in-house services,\nwhereas only 20% relied on off-site\nNCCHC\nStandards for care of youth in a juve-\nnile correctional facility have been\npublished by the NCCHC, which also\nserves as an accreditation organiza-\ntion.75,76 The latest version of the stan-\ndards for youth was published in\nfacility accreditation but are valuable\nto help inform facilities about both the\nminimal and ideal health care for in-\ncarcerated youth. The currently pub-\nlished standards do not specifically\ndistinguish between detention cen-\nters, which typically involve shorter\nlengths of stay, and longer-term post-\nadjudication residential facilities.\nHowever, at a minimum, the standards\nstate that all youth should be screened\nimmediately on arrival at the intake fa-\ncility by qualified health care profes-\nsionals or health-trained staff to iden-\ntify and meet urgent health needs and\nto screen for any potentially conta-\ngious conditions or dangerous behav-\niors such as suicidal ideation. The\nsubsequent length of stay would deter-\nmine further evaluation.\nAccording to the standards, all youth\nmust receive a comprehensive health\nassessment within 7 days of arrival\nwith hands on assessment by a physi-\ncian, physician assistant, or nurse\npractitioner. This assessment includes\na complete medical, dental, and men-\ntal health history, review and update\nof immunizations, screening for TB,\nmeasurement of vital signs, physical\nexamination, and genitourinary ex-\namination, including a gynecologic\nassessment, as indicated by gender,\nage, and risk factors. The need for lab-\noratory and/or diagnostic tests for\ncommunicable diseases, including\nSTIs, are determined by the responsi-\nble physician.\nA mental health screening that pro-\nvides a full assessment by qualified\nmental health professionals or mental\nhealth staff using a structured inter-\nview is to be conducted within 14 days\nof admission and includes past his-\ntory, suicidal behavior, victimization,\nexposure to traumatic events, sub-\nstance use, violent behavior, cerebral\ntrauma or seizures, and psychotropic\nmedication. In addition, an oral health\nscreening is to be performed by a den-\ntist or health care professional trained\nby the dentist within 7 days of admis-\nsion, and an oral examination is to be\nperformed by a dentist within 60 days\nof admission.\nFacilities are required to provide an\nopportunity for the adolescent to re-\nquest health care on a daily basis, and\nall requests must be triaged within 24\nhours. The facility must provide 24-\nhour emergency mental health and\ndental services. Discharge planning\nmust include arrangements for\nfollow-up or referrals to community\nproviders and a supply of current med-\nications to last until that follow-up can\noccur.\nA recently published study35 that as-\nsessed whether juvenile detention\nfacilities follow the standards set out\nby the NCCHC found significant defi-\ncits when comparing reported prac-\ntices to published standards. Data\nwere analyzed from the Juvenile Res-\nconducted by the Office of Juvenile\nJustice and Delinquency Prevention\nof the US Department of Justice.\nMost juvenile correctional facilities\nare not accredited by the NCCHC, and\nin the absence of mandatory accred-\nitation, it is not clear whether most\nfacilities would fail to meet the stan-\ndards or just choose not to be ac-\nthat overall, fewer than half of the\nfacilities were compliant with rec-\nommended health screening and as-\nsessments. Few detention facilities\nmet even minimal levels of care, al-\nthough better care was seen as the\nlength of stay increased.\nContinuity of care, both on entering the\nfacility and when transitioning back to\nthe community, is crucial for youth in\nthe juvenile corrections system. How-\never, continuity of care is a challenge.\nOne study20 found that fewer than half\nof families showed interest in care\ndeemed important by the on-site med-\nical staff, and a large proportion of\nfamilies were not successfully con-\ntacted. These youth had nonideal med-\nical care before admission; only half of\nthe youth had care in the previous\nyear, and only one-third of them were\nable to identify a source of regular\nmedical care. The juvenile justice sys-\ntem may be the only place where these\nyouth have received a recent compre-\nhensive medical history or physical\nAs custodial placement comes to an\nend, transitions are difficult, particu-\nlarly for youth who have experienced\ndisruption and failure and who have\nlimited internal resiliency and external\nsupport. Transitions of communities,\nresidences, schools, programs, thera-\npists, friends, and family members as\nwell as adjustment to a less restrictive\nenvironment can be difficult. Continu-\nity of care starts at the time of admis-\nsion to the facility. If the youth already\nhas a primary care provider, it is cru-\ncial for the medical staff to be able to\ncontact that clinician to verify previous\ndiagnoses and treatment. For cases in\nwhich the youth does not have a pri-\nmary care provider, resources to es-\ntablish primary care should be pro-\nvided. Providing summaries of medical\ncare for the primary care provider,\nappropriate subspecialist, or mental\nhealth specialist on discharge back to\nthe community is also extremely im-\nportant. In some cases, a chronic med-\nical condition may be first diagnosed\nwhile the youth is in custody. Facilitat-\ning the transition to a provider who\ncan ensure continuity is key, because it\nis not uncommon for youth to return to\nthe correctional facility with unmet\nchronic health needs. For some condi-\ntions, such as STIs or TB, public health\nfacilities may be able to help with\nTraditional cognitive behavioral\ntherapy (CBT) is helpful for both in-\nternalizing and externalizing behav-\niors, including anger management,\ndepression, and posttraumatic stress\ndisorder. However, it may not be the\nbest choice for many delinquent youth.\nThere are several promising interven-\ntions that have been shown to be effec-\ntive in treating youth with mental\nhealth issues. In some cases, these in-\nterventions have been shown to re-\nduce recidivism.77 Programs that\nbroadly address multiple domains,\nincluding the adolescents' family,\nschool, peers, and community, are the\nmost effective. These programs are in-\ntensive and highly structured and in-\nclude social skill development, behav-\nior management, attitude adjustment,\nand cognitive perceptions. Many of\nthese programs are community-based\ninterventions conducted in the youth's\nhome environment and directly en-\ngage the family members. Examples in-\nclude multisystemic therapy, func-\ntional family therapy, and wraparound\ntherapy. In another program, multidi-\nmensional treatment foster care,\nyouth are placed with families trained\nto provide a structured therapeutic\nenvironment as an alternative to in-\ncarceration. The biological family is\ntaught the system with the goal of\nreturning the youth home. Multisys-\ntemic therapy and functional family\ntherapy have been found to be partic-\nularly effective for youth with co-\noccurring mental health and sub-\nstance use disorders. Some of the\nchallenges with implementing these\nprograms are the high initial up-\nfront costs and the labor-intensive\nnature of the interventions.\nWhen assessing interventions, it is\nalso important to note that the Girls\nStudy Group78 found that interventions\nfor boys may not directly translate to\ngirls. Protective factors, such as car-\ning adults, school success, school con-\nnectedness, and religiosity, may be\nless effective for girls who have expe-\nrienced physical and sexual assault,\nneglect, and neighborhood disadvan-\ntage. More research is needed to un-\nderstand the interaction between risk\nand protective factors in girls to best\ndesign successful intervention pro-\ngrams. Programs for girls need to ad-\ndress victimization, which is com-\nmonly found in these youth.\nAs evidenced by the interventions de-\nscribed above, the approach in the ju-\nvenile court system is generally reha-\nbilitative rather than punitive. The\nOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delin-\nquency Prevention79 advocates a com-\nprehensive strategy that includes sup-\nporting the adolescent's family and\nengaging core institutions, such as\nschools, businesses, and religious\norganizations, in helping to develop\nmature and responsible youth. This\nstrategy utilizes the principle that\ndelinquency prevention is the most ef-\nfective approach while recognizing\nthat there is a need for graduated\nsanctions that protect the community.\nThe best prevention involves targeting\nrisk factors for delinquency, such as\ndrugs and firearms in the community,\nfamily conflict, abuse and neglect,\npoor commitment to school, and nega-\ntive peer influences, while focusing on\nprotective factors such as a resilient\nindividual temperament; close rela-\ntionships with family, teachers, other\nadults, and peers; and promoting\nschool success and avoidance of drugs\nand crime. Reentry plans need to ad-\ndress education, mentoring, prosocial\nactivities, and positive community\ninvolvement.\nAs summarized in the recently pub-\nlished findings of the SYRP, educa-\ntional difficulties and low commitment\nto academics are risk factors for delin-\nquency.3 In this nationally representa-\ntive survey, one-fifth of the youth re-\nported that they were not enrolled in\nschool at the time they entered cus-\ntody. This rate is 4 times higher than\nthat for the general population. In ad-\ndition, 61% had been expelled or sus-\npended, compared with 8% of the gen-\neral population. Although only 28% of\nyouth in the general population are\nfunctioning below grade level, 48% of\nthose in custody reported being below\nthe level expected for their age. Simi-\nlarly, a higher percentage (25%) of\nyouth in custody reported being held\nback in school, compared with 11%\namong peers in the general popula-\ntion. Although the majority (92%) of\nyouth reported attending school while\nin custody, only half of these youth re-\nported that the school program was of\ngood quality, and most youth did not\nspend as many hours in school as did\nthe general population.\nLearning disabilities are also much\nmore common among youth in custo-\ndy; rates of 30% have been reported by\nyouth in custody, which is 7 times\nhigher than that of the general popula-\ntion. Despite the requirements of the\nfederal Individuals With Disabilities Ed-\nucation Act, which states that youth in\ncustody must be identified and given\nspecial education services, even in\nshort-term facilities, only 46% report-\nedly receive these services. The SYRP\nreport concluded that there is a need\nto obtain more information on how\ncustodial facilities address educa-\ntional needs, including an assessment\nof the curricula used, the provision of\nspecial educational services, and\nwhether individual educational needs\nare being met for each youth in\ncustody.\nPENALTY\nIn the past decade, an increasing num-\nber of states have enacted laws that\nrequire that juvenile cases be trans-\nferred to adult courts for certain of-\nfenses.80 A parallel increase has been\nseen in the number of juveniles incar-\ncerated in adult facilities for certain\nfelonies. When convicted in adult court,\nthese juveniles commonly receive lon-\nger sentences than those sentenced in\njuvenile courts. Although these laws\nwere enacted with the thought that\nthey would be a deterrent for juvenile\ncrimes, 6 studies, conducted in 5 dif-\nferent states, with approximately 500\nshowed the opposite effect. Compared\nwith youth retained in the juvenile\ncourt system, recidivism rates were\nhigher for juveniles whose cases were\ntransferred to adult criminal court.\nThis was particularly true for violent\noffenders for whom transfer may actu-\nally be promoting rather than deter-\nring further criminal involvement.\nJuveniles in adult prisons report\nlearning more about criminal behavior\nfrom adult inmates and having fear of\nvictimization; these juveniles were\nleast likely to say they would not reoff-\nend. Juveniles incarcerated in adult\nprisons compared with juvenile facili-\nties have an eightfold increase in sui-\ncide, fivefold increase in being sexually\nassaulted, and twofold increase in\nlikelihood of being attacked with a\nweapon by other inmates or beaten\nby staff.80 Adult facilities have much\nless emphasis on rehabilitation and\nfamily support than do juvenile facil-\nities, and juveniles have expressed\nboth resentment and a feeling of in-\njustice when tried and punished in\nthe adult system.\nAt the extreme, issues of whether to\ninvoke the death penalty for adoles-\ncents have been debated in the past. In\nrics and the Society for Adolescent\nHealth and Medicine issued a joint\nstatement opposing the death penalty\npreme Court ruled that it was uncon-\nstitutional to impose capital punish-\nment of individuals who committed\ntermined to be the age for death-\npenalty eligibility. This age was based\non currently available scientific re-\nsearch that indicates that juveniles do\nnot have the cognitive maturity or\nsense of responsibility found in adults.\nThis was echoed in the most recent rul-\nin which life without the possibility of\nparole was not permitted for juveniles\nwho committed nonhomicide crimes.83\nFINANCING\nFinancing of health care for incarcer-\nated adolescents presents many chal-\nare entitled to health care under the\nUS Constitution (see Estelle v Gamble,\ntional guarantee does not include ac-\ncess to federally funded health bene-\nfits programs such as Medicaid or the\nChildren's Health Insurance Program\n(CHIP), and it does not apply to private\nof the federal Social Security Act spe-\ncifically prohibits federal money from\nbeing used for medical care of inmates\nin a federal institution and has been\napplied equally to adolescents.\nThere is also a federal prohibition on\nthe use of Medicaid benefits for any\nmonth during which the individual is a\nresident of a public institution. Many\nstates have terminated Medicaid ben-\nefits rather than suspend them to\navoid improper use of federal funds.\nBecause financing for medical care in\njuvenile justice facilities then largely\nrelies on state and local resources, the\nextent of medical care provided can be\nlimited. When Medicaid benefits are\nterminated, there is also commonly a\nlag in reinstatement when the youth is\nreleased back into the community. This\noccurs even when screening for eligi-\nbility is offered before release and ap-\nplication assistance is provided. Al-\nthough current law allows states to\nsuspend rather than terminate bene-\nfits for incarcerated youth, many\nstates do not follow this procedure for\nOther states have passed legislation\nspecifically to address this issue and\nrequire that Medicaid be suspended\nand not terminated for at least 6\nmonths while in detention.87 Ideally,\ncontinuation and utilization of active\nbenefits while the youth is incarcer-\nated or detained would ensure that\ncorrectional facilities can provide\nmore comprehensive medical care.\nContinuation of active benefits would\nalso facilitate continuity of care and\nmay prevent some recidivism, espe-\ncially for those with mental illnesses\nfor Medicaid benefits to remain active\nfor youth in the juvenile justice system,\nfederal law must be amended to en-\nsure both continuation of benefits and\nfunding for the federal government\nshare of Medicaid. Advocacy is needed\nat both the federal and state levels to\nensure provision of necessary medical\nservices for these youth.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe current and predicted ongoing\nshortage of child and adolescent psy-\nchiatrists, the separation of mental\nhealth and drug and alcohol treatment\nservices and personnel, the limited ac-\ncess to health care dollars for youth in\ndetention, and the institutional vari-\nability in procedures and human and\nmonetary resources will continue to\nprovide a challenge to meet a reason-\nable standard of health care for this\npopulation. The following recommen-\ndations are provided for caring for\nyouth in the juvenile correctional\nsystem.\n1. Delivery of Medical Care\nYouth incarcerated in the juvenile cor-\nrections system should receive the\nsame level and standards of medical\nand mental health care as nonincar-\ncerated youth accessing care in their\ncommunities.\na. Health care services should be\nequivalent to those recommended\nby guidelines of the American Acad-\nemy of Pediatrics (Bright Futures\n[see www.brightfutures.aap.org]).\nAlthough the extent of health ser-\nvices provided during the period of\nincarceration may be mitigated by\nthe length of stay in the facility,\nshorter-term facilities, at a mini-\nmum, should focus on the identifi-\ncation and treatment of immediate\nmedical and psychiatric issues\nsuch as injury; infectious diseases\n(TB, scabies, lice); alcohol, tobacco,\nand other drug use/addiction, in-\ncluding withdrawal; psychiatric\nemergencies including suicidal ide-\nation; and identification of chronic\nmedical or mental health problems\nthat require continuation of daily\nmedications.\nb. For youth incarcerated for more\nthan 1 week or in longer-term facil-\nities, recommended pediatric and\nadolescent comprehensive preven-\ntive services should be provided. In\naddition to a comprehensive his-\ntory and physical examination,\nyouth should receive a dental\nscreening and mental health\nscreening for psychiatric illness\nand substance use/abuse. Assess-\nments should focus on develop-\nmental and psychosocial issues.\nImmunizations should be provided\nas recommended by the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics and the Advi-\nsory Committee on Immunization\nPractices of the CDC. The Vaccines\nfor Children (VFC) program is a re-\nsource from which eligible youth\ncan access vaccines. Additional\nevaluation, including for neuro-\nlogic, genetic, and developmental\ndisorders, should be ordered by\nmedical personnel as clinically indi-\ncated. Clinicians caring for incar-\ncerated youth should have training\nand expertise in pediatrics or ado-\nlescent medicine.\nc. Evaluation should include screen-\ning for infectious diseases result-\ning from unprotected sexual activ-\nity. In view of the high rate of risk-\ntaking behaviors, STI screening\nshould be included for the most\ncommon pathogens (Neisseria gon-\norrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis).\nease (STD) treatment guidelines\nfrom the CDC recommend universal\nscreening of all female adolescents\nfor both N gonorrhoeae and C tra-\nchomatis at intake to juvenile de-\nguidelines also recommend screen-\ning sexually active young men for C\ntrachomatis in clinical settings in\nwhich there is a high prevalence,\nsuch as in correctional facilities. Al-\nthough not specifically recom-\nperiodic assessment of the local\nprevalence of N gonorrhoeae would\nbe ideal with initiation of screening\nin male adolescents when preva-\nlence rates indicate that screening\nwould be cost-beneficial. Urine-\nbased nucleic acid amplification\ntesting provides a convenient, non-\ninvasive option for screening. De-\npending on community prevalence,\nscreening for syphilis should be in-\ncluded. HIV testing should be of-\nfered to all sexually active youth per\nCompletion of the hepatitis B immu-\nnization series should be con-\nfirmed. Screening for hepatitis C\nwith serologic testing should be\nconsidered for high-risk youth, in-\ncluding those who have a history of\ninjection drug use, are HIV-positive,\nor have signs or symptoms of liver\ndisease, per current CDC recom-\nmendations.89 Juveniles with signs\nor symptoms of hepatitis should\nalso be tested for serologic mark-\ners for acute infection with hepati-\ntis A and hepatitis B. For most youth,\nthe first Papanicolaou test is not in-\ndicated until 21 years of age . If clin-\nically indicated per published\nguidelines, a pelvic examination\nshould be performed for a Papani-\ncolaou test (see pelvic examination\nand male reproductive health\nd. Screening of pubertal girls\nshould include pregnancy testing.\nBecause of the high rates of sex-\nual activity, all pubertal girls\nshould be screened for preg-\nnancy. Nonjudgmental counseling\nregarding options should be pro-\nvided for pregnant youth, and ac-\ncessibility to prenatal services\nshould be provided on-site or in the\ncommunity. Prenatal vitamins, in-\ncluding iron and folate supplementa-\ntion, should be provided to all preg-\nnant girls at the time pregnancy is\ndiagnosed and continued throughout\nthecourseofthepregnancy.Forboth\nfemale and male youth who are par-\nents, parenting classes should be in-\ncluded in the educational offerings.\ne. On-site mental health and sub-\nstance abuse professionals should\nbe available to provide both evalua-\ntion and treatment services. Mental\nhealth services can be provided by\nstaff either hired by the facilities or\nthrough a contractual arrange-\nment with an outside community\nprovider. Services should include\npsychiatric services to facilitate\ncontinuation of medications from\nthe community mental health pro-\nvider and ongoing evaluation and\ntreatment. Psychiatrists should\nhave training in child and adoles-\ncent psychiatry and preferably be\nboard certified. Tobacco-, alcohol-,\nand drug-cessation programs\nshould be available during the pe-\nriod of incarceration. Attention\nshould be paid on an ongoing basis\nto the medical and mental health\nstatus of youth, because new issues\ncan arise during their time in con-\nfinement. Correctional staff should\nreceive training in suicide preven-\ntion, and specific attention should\nbe paid to youth confined to their\nrooms in the housing unit. The prac-\ntice parameter from the American\nAcademy of Child and Adolescent\nPsychiatry provides specific recom-\nmendations on therovision of men-\ntal health services within the juve-\nnile correctional system.69\nf. Regular physical activity and nu-\ntritionally balanced meal plans ap-\npropriate for adolescents should be\nprovided in all facilities. Given the\ncurrent national epidemic of obe-\nsity, attention to these aspects of a\nhealthy lifestyle is even more\ncritical.\ng. Pediatricians should encourage\nall correctional care facilities\nto adopt and comply with the\nNCCHC's \"Standards for Health\nServices in Juvenile Detention\nand Confinement Facilities.\"76 Ac-\ncreditation is encouraged as a\nmeans to reach desired levels of\nhealth care. Information regard-\ning accreditation can be found at\nwww.ncchc.org.\n2. Developmentally Appropriate\nConfinement Facilities\nChildren and adolescents should be\nhoused in facilities that are able to ad-\ndress their specific developmental\nneeds.\na. Pediatricians, adolescent health\ncare specialists, mental health pro-\nfessionals, and drug and alcohol\ntreatment providers should be con-\nsulted about health care policies\nand procedures governing all cor-\nrectional care facilities in which\nchildren and adolescents are\nincarcerated.\nb. Children and adolescents should be\ndetained or incarcerated only in fa-\ncilities with developmentally appro-\npriate programs and staff trained\nto deal with their unique social, ed-\nucational, recreational, and super-\nvisory needs.\nc. If children and adolescents must be\nhoused in adult facilities, they\nshould have routine access to the\nsame developmentally appropriate\nenvironment and be separated by\nsight and sound from the adult\npopulation.\n3. Integration of Available Systems\nof Care\na. Coordination between juvenile jus-\ntice system health care providers\nand community providers is essen-\ntial. Health care information elic-\nited in the juvenile corrections set-\nting should, at a minimum, be\nshared with the adolescent and, as\nappropriate (when not violating\nconfidentiality), with the parent/le-\ngal guardian to allow for continuity\nof care and prevent unnecessary\nduplication of services. Pediatri-\ncians are a crucial link in the pro-\ncess of ensuring continuity of care\nbetween the community and the ju-\nvenile correctional system. Infor-\nmation should also be shared be-\ntween the relevant community\nproviders and correctional health\ncare staff both on admission and at\nthe time of release to ensure conti-\nnuity of care. If the youth does not\nhave a medical home, correctional\nstaff should make every effort to\nidentify a medical home within the\ncommunity for that youth. Pediatri-\ncians should also coordinate with\nprobation officers who are fre-\nquently entrusted with ensuring ap-\npropriate follow-up once the youth\nreenters the community.\nb. Electronic medical records avail-\nable within the community should\nalso be accessible by correctional\nhealth care staff. Existing publicly\naccessed databases, such as state\nimmunization data banks, should\nbe used to document care provided\nin correctional facilities. With the\nevolving use of electronic medical\nrecords, consideration should be\ngiven to the need to share informa-\ntion between correctional institu-\ntions and community providers to\nensure continuity of care.\nc. All youth incarcerated in the juve-\nnile corrections systems should\nmaintain eligibility for their existing\nhealth insurance benefits. Unin-\nsured youth should be able to be\nenrolled in Medicaid while incar-\ncerated. Both Medicaid and private\ninsurance should be available for\nall youth without suspension or ter-\nmination during incarceration and\nwithout a lag for reinstatement on\nreentry into the community. Youth\nwithout insurance coverage before\nincarceration should be automati-\ncally made eligible for Medicaid at\nthe time of incarceration so that ac-\ncess to appropriate care may be fa-\ncilitated. Advocacy is needed at\nboth the federal and state levels to\namend existing regulations and en-\nsure the provision of necessary\nmedical services for these youth.\n4. Treatment and Intervention\na. Evidence-based mental health and\nsubstance abuse treatment inter-\nventions that have been shown to\nreduce recidivism should be ad-\nopted to improve long-term out-\ncomes for incarcerated youth.\nPediatricians should advocate for\nadequate funding for implementa-\ntion of programs such as multisys-\ntemic therapy and functional family\ntherapy with the recognition that an\nincreased investment in the short-\nterm will lead to cost savings in\nterms of improved long-term\noutcomes.\nb. Resources should be invested in in-\nterventions that address the risk\nand protective factors involved\nwith juvenile delinquency. There\nshould be emphasis on investing in\ninterventions that address the re-\nlated family and community factors\nassociated with delinquency. Spe-\ncific emphasis should be placed on\nfactors that will improve SES such\nas educational achievement and\nemployment, because these factors\nare highly correlated with both ju-\nvenile delinquency and overall\nhealth status.\nc. More nationally representative\ndata are needed on the health\nneeds of youth in the juvenile justice\nsystem. Funding is needed to collect\nnationally representative data on\nyouth involved in the correctional\nsystem to better inform program-\nming needs and desired outcomes\nand help guide the choice of appro-\npriate cost-effective interventions.\n5. Advocacy\nPediatricians should work with their\nAAP chapters, the juvenile justice sec-\ntions of their state judiciary and bar\nassociations, and state and local gov-\nernmental officials.\na. Pediatricians should advocate to\nensure that the appropriate legisla-\ntion and funding is available to pro-\nvide for medical, educational, and\nbehavioral health needs of juve-\nniles while confined and on reentry\ninto the community.\nb. Pediatricians should advocate for\nadequate health insurance for all\nmedical and behavioral health ser-\nvices for youth both during and af-\nter incarceration to ensure that re-\nsources are available to provide\nadequate and continuous care.\nc. Pediatricians should support both\nefforts to decrease the number of\nyouth incarcerated by advocating\nfor interventional programs in the\ncommunity that address risk and\nprotective factors and legislation\nthat requires education of law en-\nforcement officers about at-risk\nyouth and teaches skills to manage\ninteractions with these youth.\nPaula K.
