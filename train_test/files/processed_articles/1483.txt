    "abstract": "Abstract\nEstimating the population distribution of the usual intake of a nutrient relative to that of another nutrient requires\ndetermination of individual-level ratios. If intake data are available on a per-day basis, as with 24-h dietary recalls, those\nratios can be determined in 1 of 2 ways: as the usual ratio of intakes or the ratio of usual intakes. Each of these ratios has its\nown meaning and determination; the ratio of usual intakes is conceptually consistent with determinations obtained from\nFFQ data. We present a method for estimating the ratio of usual intakes that uses bivariate modeling of the 2 nutrient\nintakes in question. Application of the method to the NHANES data for the years 2001\u00ad2004 yielded estimated\ndistributions for percent of usual energy intake from total fat, percent of usual energy intake from saturated fat, and usual\nsodium intake per 1000 kcal (4184 kJ) of usual energy intake. Distributions for both the total population and for age-gender\nsubgroups were estimated. Approximately 60% of adults (.19 y) had a usual total fat intake that was within the\nrecommended range of 20\u00ad35% of total energy, but only ~34% had a usual saturated fat intake ,10% of total energy. The\nresults changed only minimally when the other definition of usual intake, the usual ratio of intakes, was adopted. J. Nutr.\n",

Krebs-Smith,6\nand Douglas Midthune6\n4Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and Health Policy Research, Tel Hashomer 52161, Israel; 5Center for Nutrition Policy and\n Introduction\nA major purpose of dietary surveillance or monitoring is to\nevaluate dietary intakes relative to some standard. Standards\nmay be averages, around which the population's intakes should\nbe distributed, or thresholds, above or below which the\npopulation's intake should fall, but they are all established\nwith regard to usual intake, generally defined as the long-run\naverage daily intake over a period of time (1,2). This is\nimportant because diets vary considerably from day to day.\nNonetheless, the primary assessment method used in dietary\nsurveillance is the 24-h dietary recall (3), a method that\ninherently captures intake one day at a time and thus yields a\nlarge amount of within-person variation.\nIn previous work on estimating the proportions of the\npopulation meeting recommended dietary intake levels, inves-\ntigators have either presented the distributions of the reported\nvalues (4) or have adjusted the variance of the distribution to\nexclude within-person variation (5\u00ad8). Only the latter methods\nsuccessfully remove the within-person variation and produce\ndistributions of usual intake that have approximately the correct\nspread or variance. However, these methods have heretofore\nbeen available only for intakes of single dietary components that\nare consumed nearly every day by nearly everyone [see Dodd\net al. (9) for a review].\nIn dietary surveillance, it is often of interest to examine the\npopulation distribution of usual intake for a ratio of 2 dietary\ncomponents. Examples include the distribution of intakes of\nsaturated fat, total fat, or sodium, each expressed as a ratio of\ntotal energy intake. Estimating such distributions from national\nsurvey data that are based upon dietary intake reports from 24-h\nrecalls is not trivial.\nIt has been noted previously (10,11) that there are 2 ways of\ndescribing the distribution of ratios of intakes. Likewise, 2\ndefinitions of an individual's usual intake ratio are available.\nFirst, one could take the long-term mean of the daily ratio of\nintakes, which we will call the usual ratio (of intakes). Second,\none could take the ratio of the long-term means of the daily\nintakes, which we will call the ratio of usual intakes. A simple\n(but rather extreme) example shows that these are different.\n1 L.S.F. was supported through a contract held by Information Management\nSystems Inc with the US National Cancer Institute; the remaining authors were\nsupported by their respective institutions: USDA and the National Cancer\nInstitute.\n2 Author disclosures: L.

Using the ratio of\nusual intakes, the usual fat intake is 2300 kJ, the usual energy\nThe question of which definition is the more appropriate for\npurposes of dietary surveillance is not an easy matter to resolve,\nTABLE 1 Summary of the distribution of percent of usual energy intake from total fat in the total US\nSubpopulation n Mean 6 SE\nPercentile\nMales and females % %\nMales\nFemales\nAll persons\n2 Percent of usual energy intake from fat = 100 3 [usual intake of fat (kJ)] / [usual intake of energy (kJ)].\nTABLE 2 Summary of the distribution of percent of usual energy intake from saturated fat in the\nSubpopulation n Mean 6 SE\nPercentile\nMales and females % %\nMales\nFemales\nAll persons\n2 Percent of usual energy intake from fat = 100 3 [usual intake of fat (kJ)] / [usual intake of energy (kJ)].\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nbecause the decision may depend on biological knowledge that is\noften lacking. The usual ratio is simpler to calculate, but the\nratio of usual intakes is conceptually consistent with the ratio\nthat would be determined from FFQ, because they query long-\nterm intake. For this reason alone, it is desirable to have a\nstatistical method for estimating the ratio of usual intakes and\nderiving its distribution in the population from 24-h recall data.\nTherefore, our purposes in this article are to describe the\nmethodology for estimating the population distribution of\nthe ratio of usual intakes and to apply the method to estimate\nthe distributions of several ratios. A feature of the method is the\nability to estimate distributions in subpopulations. Accordingly,\nwe also present distributions according to selected age and\ngender groups. Finally, we compare the results of estimating the\npopulation distribution of the ratio of usual intakes with those\nfor the usual ratio and shows that the difference was small in the\nexamples.\nMethods\nData. The data for this study were obtained from 17,889 participants\n$1 y were included except those deemed unreliable by survey staff (297\nindividuals), those reporting breast milk consumption (39 individuals)\nbecause breast milk intake was not quantified, and 1 individual who\nreported fasting on the survey day.\nDietary intakes were assessed via computer-assisted, interviewer-\nadministered 24-h recalls. In 2001, a single recall was requested from all\nThe first dietary interview was conducted in a mobile examination center\nand the second was conducted 3\u00ad10 d later via telephone.\nThe NHANES has a complex, multistage, probability design. For this\nstudy, one of the authors (K.W.D.) created replicate weight sets suitable\nfor the balanced repeated replication method of variance estimation. The\nreplicate weights were based on the dietary survey weights accompany-\ning the NHANES data files, which adjust for survey design, nonresponse,\nday of week, and any sequence effect in the second recall.\nInstitutional Review Board under protocol no. 98\u00ad12. Further informa-\ntion about the NHANES is available elsewhere (12).\nEstimating the population distribution of the ratio of usual\nintakes. The method, described briefly here, is based on a joint bivariate\nmodel for the 2 nutrients (the numerator and the denominator of the\nratio) in question. A more precise and technical description is provided in\nthe Supplemental Appendix.\nEach reported nutrient intake was first mathematically transformed\nto approximate normality using a Box-Cox (power) transformation. The\ntransformation was chosen to minimize the mean squared error around a\nstraight line fit to a weighted QQ plot using the sampling survey weights\nof each participant.\nThe data were then analyzed using a bivariate linear mixed effects\nmodel, including the following terms for each nutrient: an intercept\n(fixed effect), an indicator for whether the reported day was a weekday\nor a weekend (fixed effect), an indicator for the sequence number (first\nvs. second) of the report (fixed effect), indicators for age group (fixed\neffects), a subject-specific term (random effect), and a within-subject\nerror term (random error). For the analysis of children's intakes, an extra\ncovariate for gender (fixed effect) was included. For adults, men and\nwomen were analyzed separately.\nThe covariate weekday/weekend was included to accommodate the\ndifference in intake that often occurs between the weekend (Friday to\nSunday) and the rest of the week. The covariate sequence number was\nincluded to accommodate the possibility that participants report less\nfully on the second recall than on the first. The first recall was taken to be\nthe unbiased report.\nThe covariate age group, which is a factor with several levels, was\nincludedto allow estimation of the distributionwithin specific age groups.\nTABLE 3 Summary of the distribution of usual sodium intake relative to usual energy intake in the\nSubpopulation n Mean 6 SE\nPercentile\nMales\nFemales\nAll persons\n2 Usual intake of sodium (mg) per 1000 kcal of usual energy intake = 1000 3 [usual intake of sodium (mg)] / [usual intake of energy (kcal)].\nDistribution of ratios of usual intakes 113\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nIncluding a covariate in the model allows estimation of distributions in\nsubpopulations and results in much greater precision than analyzing the\nmodel on only the subset of data from that subpopulation (13).\nThe subject-specific terms of the 2 nutrients were assumed to have a\nbivariate normal distribution, with 2 variances and a covariance\nestimated from the data. Likewise, the within-subject terms were\nassumed to be bivariate normal and independent of the subject-specific\nterms and required another 2 variances and a covariance to be estimated.\nThe model parameters could be estimated, because many participants\ncompleted more than one 24-h recall. If there are no repeated\ndeterminations, then within-subject variance parameters could not be\nparticipants completed 2 24-h recalls.\nThe model was fitted to the data using the NLMIXED procedure in\nthe statistical software package SAS and the sampling weights of each\nparticipant were incorporated into the analysis. The output yielded\nestimates of the fixed-effect and random-effect model parameters,\nincluding the within-subject covariances. Three runs of the NLMIXED\nprocedure for each type of ratio were performed on children aged 1\u00ad8 y,\nmales aged $9 y, and females $9 y.\nMonte Carlo simulations were then run using the parameter values\nestimated from the model. These simulations generated usual intakes of each\nnutrient for a large number of pseudo-individuals (the details of these\nsimulations are described in the Supplemental Appendix). The ratio of usual\nintakes was calculated for each pseudo-individual and, using the sampling\nweights, the percentiles of the distribution of ratios of usual intakes were\nestimated. SE were estimated using balanced repeated replication.\nThese procedures were used to estimate distributions for 10 age-gender\nsubgroups. The distributions for men and women $19 y were estimated by\ncombining the distributions of 4 finer age groupings according to the\npopulation proportion in each subgroup. Results are shown for the\nfollowing ratios: total fat:energy, saturated fat:energy, and sodium:energy.\nValues in the text are means or proportions 6 1 SE, or estimated percentiles.\nThe SAS code for performing these analyses is available at http://riskfactor.\ncancer.gov/diet/usualintakes/.\nEstimating the population distribution of the usual ratio. The\nmethod for estimating the population distribution of the usual ratio is\nsimpler than for the ratio of usual intakes, because it is based on the\nunivariate distribution of the ratio of daily intakes rather than on the\nbivariate distribution of the numerator and denominator. Several\nmethods can be applied directly to individuals' 24-h recall reported\ndaily ratios (5,6,13) and would be expected to give very similar results.\nFor this report, the one-part version of a method developed at the\nNational Cancer Institute (13) was used.\nResults\nThe estimated mean percentage of usual energy intake from total\n42.9%, respectively. There was modest variation with age, with\nolder persons tending to have a higher percentage intake and\nvery little difference between men and women.\nThe estimated mean percentage of usual energy intake from\nsaturated fat in the total population was 11.2 6 0.1% and the\nand 15.0%, respectively. The youngest children (1\u00ad3 y) had the\nhighest percentage; the percentage was lower in children aged\n4\u00ad18 y and lowest in adults . 19 y, with little variation among\nadults by age group or between men and women.\nThe estimated mean usual intake of sodium per 1000 kcal\n(4184 kJ) of usual energy intake in the total population was\nwere lower among young children (1\u00ad3 y). Intakes were also\nslightly lower among younger adults (31\u00ad50 y) than older adults\n(.50 y). Differences between men and women were minor.\nSupplemental Tables providing SE for the individual percentile\nTABLE 5 Comparison of the mean ratio of usual intakes to\nthe mean usual ratio for percent energy from total\nfat in the total U.S. population and selected\nSubpopulation n\nRatio of\nusual intakes\nUsual\nratio Difference\nMales and females %\nMales\nFemales\nAll persons\n1 Values are means 6 SE, estimated from data on 17,889 participants in NHANES.\nTABLE 4 Proportions in the total U.S. population and selected\nage-gender subgroups with usual intake of total fat\nequal to 20\u00ad35% of usual energy intake and\nproportions with usual intake of saturated fat less\nSubpopulation n\nProportion with\nof energy 6 SE\nProportion with\nof energy 6 SE\nMales and females\nMales\nFemales\nAll persons\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nestimates for these ratios and the estimated distributions for\nother ratios are available.7\nThe methodology described also allows estimation of the\nproportion of the population whose ratio of usual intakes\nfalls within a chosen interval. An estimated 62 6 1% of the\npopulation had a usual total fat consumption that was within\nthe acceptable macronutrient distribution range for total fat\n(Table 4). The proportion meeting this recommendation was\nApproximately 34% of the adult population's usual saturated\nfat consumption was ,10% of energy, as recommended by\nthe Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2). The proportion of\nchildren meeting that recommendation was smaller.\nThe difference between the estimated distribution of the ratio\nof usual intakes and the distribution of the usual ratio of intakes\nfor the same 3 ratios was small (Tables 5\u00ad7). The differences\nwere in both directions but very small compared with the\nquantity estimated. All differences were ,3% of the estimated\nvalue.\nDiscussion\nThe method described in this article has provided for the first\ntime, to our knowledge, estimates of the distribution of ratios\nof usual intakes of nutrients to usual energy intake for the U.\nS. population and age-gender subgroups. Ratios give more\ndirect information on the quality of the composition of the\ndiet consumed than is provided by absolute intakes of\nnutrients and distributions of such ratios have heretofore\nbeen unavailable.\nFor the 3 examples given, differences between men and\nwomen were minor. Thus, although absolute intakes of these\nnutrients differed substantially between men and women, after\nadjustment for energy intake, the intakes were very similar.\nBecause there are 2 different definitions of usual intake of a\nratio, investigators may ask which to use and whether it matters\nwhich is used. The following formula provides the investigator\nwith a method of judging whether the 2 definitions will lead\nto similar results. Denote an individual's ratio on a given day\nby x/y. If CVy\nis the within-person CV of the denominator\n(expressed as a proportion, not as a percentage) and CVx\nis that\nof the numerator, and if rxy\nis the within-person correlation\nbetween the numerator and denominator, then:\nindividual0s usual ratio ffi \u00f01 \u00fe CV2\ny\n\u00de\n3 individual0s ratio of usual intakes:\nThis approximate result is obtained using Taylor's expansion\nand should provide reasonable accuracy for CV ,0.75. It is\nsimilar to and mathematically consistent with the expression\ngiven by Krebs-Smith et al. (10), although those authors were\nconcerned with ratios at the population level rather than at the\nindividual level. The closer the bracketed expression is to 1.0,\nthe closer the usual ratio will be to the ratio of usual intakes and,\nconsequently, the closer the 2 methods of estimating the\npopulation distribution of usual intake will be for the ratio of\nnutrients in question. Data from repeat 24-h recalls in the Eating\nat America's Table Study (15) indicate that the within-person\nCV for energy is ~0.32, for saturated fat is 0.37, and for sodium\n0.43 [Supplemental Table 1 in (11)]. The within-person corre-\nlations with energy were 0.78 for saturated fat and 0.71 for\nTABLE 7 Comparison of the mean ratio of usual intakes to\nthe mean usual ratio for sodium relative to energy\nintake in the total U.S. population and selected\nSubpopulation n\nRatio of\nusual intakes\nUsual\nratio Difference\nMales\nFemales\nAll persons\n1 Values are means 6 SE, estimated from data on 17,889 participants in NHANES.\nTABLE 6 Comparison of the mean ratio of usual intakes to the\nmean usual ratio for percent energy from saturated\nfat in the total U.S. population and selected\nSubpopulation n\nRatio of\nusual intakes Usual ratio Difference\nMales and females %\nMales\nFemales\nAll persons\n1 Values are means 6 SE, estimated from data on 17,889 participants in NHANES.\nDistribution of ratios of usual intakes 115\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nsodium [Supplemental Table 1 in (11)]. Thus, the bracketed\nexpression above for the saturated fat:energy ratio is equal to\nclose enough to 1 that one would expect very little difference\nbetween the methods. That the values are so close to 1 is due to\nthe relatively high correlation between numerator and denom-\ninator, together with the similarity in their CV.\nAs predicted by the above formula, the results presented in\nTables 6 and 7 show very little difference between the 2\nmethods for the saturated fat:energy ratio and the sodium:\nenergy ratio. Table 5 shows that the difference was also small\nfor the total fat:energy ratio. The formula predicts, however,\nthat differences could be more important in other situations.\nFor example, in a case where the denominator has a high CV\nand the numerator has little or no correlation with the\ndenominator, one might expect larger differences. Thus, ratios\nof micronutrients, such as vitamin C, to energy may display\nlarger differences.\nIn view of the possibility of larger differences being found\nbetween the 2 methods, it would seem appropriate to identify if\nand when one of the definitions is more appropriate. As\nmentioned in the Introduction, this choice is difficult in the\nabsence of relevant biological information. For example, high\nintakes of saturated fat are considered deleterious and it is\nrecommended that Americans consume ,10% of energy from\nsuch fatty acids. What is less clear is whether this ratio of 10% of\nenergy should not be exceeded on a diurnal basis or over time. If\neach day's ratio has some relevance, then the usual ratio may be\nmore appropriate. If, however, the relevant ratio is the propor-\ntion of all energy consumed over a long period of time derived\nfrom saturated fat, then the ratio of usual intakes may be more\nappropriate. For most ratios of interest in nutrition, biological\ninformation to guide choosing the most relevant ratio is not yet\navailable. It may be that one or the other method will be found to\nbe more appropriate for some ratios than others. Most nutri-\ntionists we have questioned have stated a preference for the ratio\nof usual intakes, perhaps reflecting an intuition that this term\nbetter reflects the steady state of an individual. As mentioned\nearlier, the ratio of usual intakes has the added advantage of being\nconceptually consistent with determinations based on food\nfrequency data.\nThe method described can be applied to data gathered by\nrepeated 24-h recalls on nutrients or other dietary constituents\nthat are consumed nearly every day by nearly everyone in the\npopulation. The method is intended for use on quite large\ndatasets with sample sizes of at least 1000 or more, especially if\ndistributions in population subgroups are to be estimated. If one\nis interested in the distribution of a total population only, then a\nsample of several hundred may suffice.\nOn occasion there is a need to examine the population\ndistribution of the ratio of an episodically consumed food or\nnutrient (one that is not typically consumed every day) to\nanother food or energy. For example, one may be interested in\ncholesterol intake from eggs as a proportion of total cholesterol\nintake. In such cases, the required statistical modeling becomes\nmore complex. Methods using an extension of the 2-part model\ndescribed by Kipnis et al. (16) are now being developed to allow\nthe estimation of these types of distributions.\n"
