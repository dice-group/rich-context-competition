During the crisis banks\nwere hit by global aggregate as well as idiosyncratic, i.e. bank-specific shocks. The crucial\nquestions are how stable is interbank lending to shocks of a different kind and how periods\nof market turmoil affect the general functioning of market discipline.\nCONTRIBUTION\nA number of features clearly distinguish our paper from the existing literature. First, we\ncontrol not only for the volume but also for the persistence of interbank lending. This allows\nus to explore both intensive and extensive margins of interbank market dynamics. Second,\nwe are the first that by disentangling the effects and the inherently differing information\ncontent of aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, provide evidence of whether the inability of\nsome banks to roll over their interbank positions was due to a failure of the interbank\nmarket, or rather to revised bank-level risk perceptions that lead to a stressed money\nmarket.

Most importantly, our results uncover a so far undocumented ability\non the part of the interbank market to distinguish between banks of different quality in\ntimes of aggregate distress. We show empirical evidence that questions the hypothesis of\nmarket discipline being undermined by a lower sensitivity to fundamentals in times of\naggregate market turmoil. In fact, our results show that the negative effect of higher risk\nlevels is even larger in the crisis period than in the non-crisis period. In this regard,\nrelationship banking is not capable of containing these frictions, as hard information seems\nto dominate soft information.\nFRAGESTELLUNG\nWir untersuchen, in welchem Ausma\u00df die Finanzmarktkrise des Jahres 2007 zu einem\nMarktversagen auf dem Interbankenmarkt gef\u00fchrt hat, z.B. durch eine unzureichende\nFinanzierung fundamental gesunder Banken. W\u00e4hrend der Finanzmarktkrise waren diese\nsowohl aggregierten als auch idiosynkratischen Schocks ausgesetzt, d.h. Schocks, die\neinerseits den Gesamtmarkt und andererseits die individuelle Bank betreffen. Die\nentscheidenden Fragen in diesem Zusammenhang sind, wie stabil Interbankenm\u00e4rkte\ngegen\u00fcber Schocks unterschiedlichen Typs sind und wie sich Perioden allgemeiner\nMarktunsicherheit auf die Funktionsweise von Marktdisziplin auswirken.\nBEITRAG\nUnsere Analyse unterscheidet sich wesentlich von der bisherigen Literatur. Erstens zielt\nunsere Studie nicht nur auf das Interbankenvolumen ab, sondern auch auf die\nBest\u00e4ndigkeit von Interbankenbeziehungen \u00fcber die Zeit. Diese Herangehensweise\nerm\u00f6glicht es, die gesamte Bandbreite der Interbankenmarktdynamik zu untersuchen.\nZweitens sind wir die ersten, die systematisch zwischen aggregierten und\nidiosynkratischen Schocks unterscheiden und damit die Verwerfungen auf dem\nInterbankenmarkt erkl\u00e4ren und quantifizieren. Drittens erlaubt uns die L\u00e4nge unserer\nBeobachtungsperiode nicht nur den Krisenzeitraum selbst, sondern auch die\nVorkrisenperiode zu untersuchen.

Das zentrale Ergebnis ist, dass wir eine bis dato nicht\ndokumentierte Eigenschaft des Interbankmarktes aufzeigen, n\u00e4mlich die Eigenschaft,\nzwischen Banken hoher und niedriger Qualit\u00e4t in Zeiten allgemeiner Marktunsicherheit zu\nunterscheiden. Somit entkr\u00e4ften wir empirisch die Hypothese einer geringen Relevanz\nfundamentaler, harter Informationen im Fall hoher Marktunsicherheit. Vielmehr deuten\nunsere Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass die Sensitivit\u00e4t der Marktteilnehmer gegen\u00fcber\nbankindividuellen Risiken zugenommen hat.

The large scale of\nthese policies over the past few years has effectively made central banks the main money\nmarket intermediaries (Br\u00e4uning and Fecht, 2012). Such interventions have been\nsuccessful in preventing liquidity crunches, but come at the cost of neglecting the market\ndiscipline mechanism inherent to the interbank market. The question of how reliable the\nfunctioning of market discipline is in times of aggregate distress is therefore crucial for an\nevaluation of the benefits and costs of the interbank interventions. In this regard, empirical\nresearch has already documented the role played by the intensity of interbank relations for\nthe availability and the conditions of interbank borrowing in times of crisis (Cocco et al.,\ninterbank positions change in response to idiosyncratic shocks and whether this change is\ncontingent in times of aggregate distress.\nIn this paper, we close this gap and empirically examine the sensitivity of bilateral\ninterbank positions to both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. We employ several\ndefinitions of idiosyncratic shocks which are based on measuring the relative deterioration\nof a bank's capital, liquidity or credit quality. We then study how idiosyncratic shocks which\nhit the borrowing or lending bank affect the intensity of interbank positions in normal times\nand time of aggregate distress. By disentangling the role of idiosyncratic and aggregate\nshocks, we aim to provide evidence of whether the turmoil in the interbank market was due\nto a general failure of the interbank market in reallocating liquidity efficiently within the\nbanking sector itself, or rather to revised bank-level risk perceptions that lead to a stressed\nmoney market.\nThe study is based on data on the bilateral exposures of German banks for the period\nprobability of the existence of a bilateral interbank position and then estimates the\ndeterminants of the volume of this position.\nOur results show that aggregate distress has a statistically significant negative effect on\nbilateral interbank exposures, although, in economic terms, idiosyncratic shocks are\neconomically by far more important. Also, we find that interbank positions react to\nidiosyncratic shocks even if the market as a whole is in distress. More specifically, we\nshow that lending banks statistically and economically reduce their exposures to banks\nthat have suffered idiosyncratic shocks. In terms of existing relationships, we find that\nthese are not fully terminated following a shock but that their intensity is reduced.\nInterestingly, the intensity of bilateral exposures is driven not only by the shocks that hit the\nborrowing bank but also by those that hit the lending bank.1 In the case of borrowing\nbanks, we find that the intensity of the interbank relation is sensitive to shocks to capital,\nliquidity and to credit quality. This sensitivity is highest, however, for the shocks to a\nborrower bank's liquidity position. In the case of lending banks, we find that shocks to their\ncapitalization do not affect the intensity of interbank relations, but shocks to liquidity and, in\nparticular, shocks to credit quality have a strong negative effect. Further, the effects are\nnonlinear for both borrowing and lending banks. They are also contingent on the\naggregate state of the financial system.\nMoreover, we explore whether relationship banking can outweigh the negative effects\ninduced by bank-specific shocks. Unlike results of earlier studies, which find that\nrelationship banking helps to overcome financial instability, we show distinct evidence that\nhard information seems to dominate soft information, as neither longer nor more intense\n1 This is contrary to Afonso et al. (2011) who find a relationship for the US interbank market between bank characteristics\nand the volume of the exposure only for the borrowing banks but not for the lending banks.\ninterbank relationships in the past contain the negative effects of either aggregate or\nidiosyncratic shocks regarding the banks' capital, credit quality or liquidity.\nA number of features underline the novelty of our paper relative to the existing\nliterature. First, we control not only for the volume but also for the existence of lending.\nThis allows us to explore both intensive and extensive margins of interbank market\ndynamics. In this regard, we are the first to utilize a Heckman Correction methodology to\ncounter the empirical problem of sample selection arising from the fact that banks\nparticipating in a bilateral interbank relation may differ in important unmeasured ways from\nbanks which do not participate. For example differing business models may foster\ninterbank market participation or restrain banks from doing so. Hence, we provide insights\ninto both the main drivers which increase or decrease the probability of forming bank-to-\nbank relationships, as well as their impact on interbank lending exposures. Second, the\nlength of our sample allows us to make comparisons between normal and crisis times. In\ndetail, we analyze the most extensive dataset so far comprising over 1.9 million interbank\nOur results contribute to several strands of the literature. To start with, by showing that\ninterbank exposure, even in times of aggregate distress, is related to the conditions of the\nborrowing bank, we confirm an insight gained from various studies on market discipline in\n(1992), for example, also find that banks are well-informed parties in judging the solvency\nof illiquid peer banks. This view has been debated by Goodfriend (2002) and Martin and\nMcAndrews (2007). These papers claim that banks are not apt to monitor other banks,\nbecause the implicit guarantee supplied by central banks, which are expected to intervene\nin case of crisis, undermine banks' incentives to monitor their peers. More recent studies,\nreconcile the two sides of the debate by finding that banks possess knowledge regarding\nother banks' health, even while highlighting that this is only complementary to the\nknowledge of central banks. More specifically, Furfine (2001) documents that interbank\ninterest rates in the US federal funds market reflect in part the credit risk of the borrowing\nbanks. Similarly, King (2008) demonstrates that high-risk banks pay more than safe banks\nfor interbank loans. Dinger and von Hagen (2009) show that in systems characterized by\nlonger-term interbank exposures the monitoring role of lenders is more important, and\nBr\u00e4uning and Fecht (2012) find evidence for the existence of private information in the\nGerman interbank market, as relationship lenders were already charging higher interest\nrates to their borrowers in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, whereas, during\nthe crisis, borrowers paid lower rates on average to their relationship lenders than to spot\nlenders.\nWhile, in the case of a well-functioning interbank market, the evidence on peer\nmonitoring is mixed, for times of aggregate market turmoil most existing literature predicts\nthat market discipline will be further undermined by a lower sensitivity to fundamentals\ncommon that information asymmetry becomes worse during a crisis when the percentage\nof risky banks goes up and investors are unable to differentiate among the credit risks of\nindividual banks. As a result, lenders require a higher yield to participate in the market. In\ncases of particularly severe distress, adverse selection issues can generate a complete\nfreeze of the interbank market. Following this argument, central banks should intervene as\na lender of last resort in order to prevent liquidity distress of solvent banks. The results of\nour study contradict this view and uncover a so far undocumented ability on the part of the\ninterbank market to distinguish between banks of different quality in times of aggregate\ndistress.\nThe remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data.\nSection 3 introduces the methodology. The main estimation results are presented in\nSection 4. Section 5 describes a battery of robustness tests. Section 6 concludes.\nWe construct a unique unbalanced panel bank-to-bank level dataset that contains\ninformation about the German interbank market from the first quarter of 2000 to the third\nquarter of 2012.23 The construction of the dataset makes use of several data sources. The\ncentral source is the Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register data (MiMik) which contains\ninformation on all big individual exposures of German banks to firms (including other\nbanks). This source gives us information on whether a bank with a German charter has\nlent to any other banks and, if so, how much of the interbank lending is outstanding at the\nend of each quarter. Next, we add information from the balance sheet of the lending and\nborrowing banks. This information stems from the monthly balance sheet statistics Bista\nand BAKIS.4 Moreover, we utilize the banks' estimates of their counterparty's probability of\ndefault (PD) which has been part of the general MiMik dataset since 2008.5\nPanel A of Table 1 provides summary statistics on the number of banks, their distinct\nbank group and the number of bank-quarter observations on those entities as well as the\noverall number of observations. In total, our dataset covers an extensive amount of 4.6\nmillion bank-quarter observations on a total of 3,550 German banks. In around 40% of\n2 Details on the credit register can be found in Schmieder (2006), and in published work by Schertler et al. (2006), Hayden et\nal. (2007) and Ongena et al. (2012), for example. The Bundesbank also maintains a website with working papers based on\nits credit register.\n3 For a more detailed definition, see Section 14 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). If exposures existed\nduring the reporting period but are partly or fully repaid, the remaining exposure is reported even if the amount is zero. Due\ndata limitations we take the actual amount of exposures into consideration that is the reported end-quarter amounts.\n4 We match the end of the quarter value of the Bista variables to the quarterly frequency of the interbank data. A few balance\nsheet items - such as non-performing loans - are not covered by Bista. We therefore uncover them from BAKIS, which is\nan information system that is shared between the Bundesbank and BaFin (the German Federal Banking Supervisory\nOffice) and comes with annual frequency.\n5 Each counterparty is assessed by several different creditor banks; we take the median value of all estimated PDs.\nthese bank-quarter observations we detect actual bank lending relationships between a\ncreditor bank C and a borrower bank B. In the minority of the cases, lending is conducted\nbetween banks belonging to the same bank holding company (BHC). Surprisingly, we\ndetect a considerable amount of reciprocal lending relationships, that is more than 820,000\nbank-quarter observations show a pattern of a contemporaneous reverse lending from the\ninitial borrowing bank B to creditor bank C.\nMoreover, the German interbank market is not fragmented along the lines of the\ntraditional three-pillar structure of the German banking system, in which private\ncommercial banks form the first pillar, public banks, such as Landesbanken and saving\nbanks, form the second pillar, and cooperative banks the third pillar. We detect a\nconsiderable interconnection between all market participants, where the large banks such\nas the big, i.e. major banks, regional banks and the Landesbanken emerge mostly as\nborrowers, and savings and cooperative banks emerge as lenders (see Craig et al. 2015).\nFor instance, savings banks provide lending not only to the Landesbanken but also to\nprivate mortgage banks and big banks.\nPanel B of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on these interbank exposures as well\nas some initial impressions of how German interbank relationships are structured.\nInterbank exposures and, especially, reciprocal exposures exhibit a strong variance with\nmean values of 51 million and 86 million and a standard deviation (SD) of around 0.9\nbillion and 1.4 billion, respectively. Following Furfine (1999), we measure the strength of\nan interbank relation by (i) the duration of the bilateral exposure, as well as by (ii) the\nconcentration of the banks' lending and/or borrowing activity. Regarding the relationship's\nduration, we calculate Credit relation span by adding up the bank quarters of a creditor\nbank C providing continuous lending to a specific borrower bank B. As in the case of\ninterbank lending, both borrower and creditor are financial institutions and can, for\ninstance, cooperate by mutually providing liquidity to each other. We also consider the\npossible two-sided nature of interbank relationships by computing Reciproc relation span\nby adding up the quarters the current borrower bank B is continuously lending to creditor\nbank C. Accordingly, Total relation span adds up the number of quarters in which both\nbanks C and B are related to each other in either direction. In line with Petersen and Rajan\n(1994) Total relation span is a proxy for private information mitigating problems of\nasymmetric information. Overall, interbank relationships between distinct bank pairs last on\naverage for around three years. If a relationship breaks at some point, it takes\napproximately the same amount of time for a relation to be re-established. Regarding the\nconcentration on one lender/borrower, we follow Cocco et al. (2009) and Br\u00e4uning and\nFecht (2012) and compute the amount lent by a creditor bank C to a borrower bank B\nrelative to the overall amount lent by bank C in any distinct quarter . Formally, this lender\npreference index (LPI) is defined as\n\n=\n\n \n\nwhereas we set the variable to zero if the denominator is zero, i.e. if the lender did not lend\nat all. Similarly, we compute the borrower preference index (BPI) as the amount borrowed\nby bank B from bank C relative to the overall borrowing by bank B in quarter \n\n=\n\n \n\nAgain we detect a considerable high variance with some banks lending to and borrowing\nfrom only a single counterparty, whereas the mean values of the indices are 6.1% and\nLast, Panel C provides descriptive statistics on the most important bank\ncharacteristics.6 Regarding size, most banks in our sample are rather small ones with total\nassets amounting to 378 million, but with 3.6 billion as a mean value. In general,\n6 To control for spurious outliers we delete all observations except Size at the 0.1% level. As robustness checks we rerun our\nspecifications with varying measures or without any outlier correction measures.

The importance of the traditional bank loan for financial intermediation in\nGermany is mirrored by the loans to asset ratio (LAR), as loans to non-financials comprise\naround 60% of the banks' balance sheet. Around 4% of those loans are non-performing\n(NPLR)7. 20% of the banks' assets are liquid (LIQR) and the return on risk-weighted\nassets (ROA(rw)) amounts in the mean (median) to 1.2% (1.7%). The mean (median) Z-\nThis rich data source makes it possible to observe the behavior of nearly the entire\nGerman interbank market and the use of the bank-specific balance sheet information\nenables us to analyze the most important determinants of interbank market (in)stability.\nHowever, before we can make meaningful causal inferences some methodological\nshortcomings have to be solved.\nFirst, between the first quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2012 a number of bank\nmergers took place. We carry out a merger correction procedure by creating a new\nseparate bank after the merger takes place.8 The relationships' duration still amounts to\nnearly three years, which should be a sufficient amount of time to overcome asymmetric\ninformation due to relationship banking (Rochet & Tirole, 1996). Nevertheless, results are\nrobust to alternative specifications.\nSecond, and most important, we have to account for the possibility of an endogenous\nsample selection, as around 60% of our bank quarters do not contain an interbank lending\nrelationship, because either banks stopped participating in the interbank market in general\n7 Especially saving and cooperative banks exhibit high values of non-performing loans.\n8 Our approach is based on separating the pre-merger banks from the merged bank. In the end, we have three banks, which\nare treated independently from each other. We repeat this procedure as often as a merger takes place. Each time a new\nmerged bank receives a new identification number, we drop the target banks in that quarter.\nor interrupted a specific interbank relationship. A sample selection bias may arise if the\nsample consists only of banks which choose to participate in the interbank market and\nthese banks differ in important unmeasured ways from banks which do not participate. We\nutilize the Heckman Correction methodology to overcome this issue. That is, we first\nestimate the probability of an interbank lending relationship taking place with a Probit\n(selection) equation by MLE\n( \nwith  being a vector of explanatory variables,  a vector of unknown parameters and \nthe cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.9 Afterwards, we\ncompute the inverse Mills ratio\n\n() =\n()\nas the ratio between the standard normal probability density function  and the standard\nnormal cumulative distribution function , each evaluated at observation , and utilize \n\nfinally in the second step as a further regressor in a standard OLS regression model.10\nThe dependent variable for the second step is the logarithmic change in the exposure of\ncreditor bank C to borrower bank B and is defined as\n \n= (\n)\n(\nMoreover, to compare our results with those of earlier studies we also employ LPI and\nBPI concentration measures as proxies for the change in the intensity of an interbank\nrelation. Accordingly, we estimate the following baseline regression model with parameters\nestimated using OLS\n9 We use clustered standard errors with the lending relationship between creditor bank C and borrower bank B as our cluster\nvariable.\n10 We use robust standard errors.\n\n \n\n\n =  + \n\n() + \n= \n+ \n + \n\n+ \n \n,\n+ \n\n()\n+ \nwhere  is the vector of explanatory right-hand side (RHS) variables,  a vector of\nunknown parameters,  the unknown parameter of the estimated inverse Mills ratio \n and\n\nis the composite error term including the time invariant unobserved effect.

As described in the previous section\n  \ncaptures the interbank history of a specific pair of banks C and B\nby adding up the quarters in which those two banks have either a lending or borrowing\nrelationship in . To proxy the bank's relationship intensity we use the logarithm of the\nlagged exposure from the creditor bank C to the borrower bank B, ln()\n.\nMoreover, to analyze the effect of reciprocity we also utilize the reciprocal lending from the\ninitial borrower bank B to the creditor bank C, ln\n( \n)\n\n. In the case of\nthis variable we take the contemporaneous values, since we are particularly interested in\nexploring whether truly reciprocal exposure increases the stability of the relation11. And\nfinally, we account with a dummy variable for banks belonging to the same bank holding\ncompany (BHC) where the variable  \ntakes the value of one if both banks\nbelong in quarter  to the same BHC and zero otherwise. Regarding the set of control\nvariables, we use standard bank characteristics with a one quarter lag and a set of dummy\n11 Results do not change qualitatively or quantitatively if we utilize reciprocal exposure with one quarter lag.\nvariables classifying each bank in any distinct quarter into a specific bank group listed in\nPanel A of Table 1. We utilize both types of controls for every bank . More precisely,\nbank-specific characteristics are the bank's logarithm of total assets \n, the loans\nto assets ratio (\n), the liquidity to assets ratio (\n), the regulatory capital ratio\n(\n) and the return on risk-weighted assets ratio (()\nTable 2 describes all variables employed in the estimations. Its Panel A illustrates the\nleft-hand side (LHS) variables, while Panel B is focused on the right-hand side (RHS)\nvariables, including our fix set of control variables.\nTo give an answer to the question of whether the German interbank market was frozen\ndue to an aggregate shock disabling an efficient liquidity allocation or whether it was\npartially stressed due to bank-specific shocks and possibly revised risk perceptions, we\nexpand this Heckit baseline model consisting of both model (3) and (6) stepwise. First, to\nanalyze whether a longer or stronger interbank relationship in the past mitigates possible\nnegative  effects, we expand the plain baseline models by interaction terms of the\nfollowing form\n  [  \n()\n( )\n\nSecond, we augment the baseline models by () which is a vector of different\nlagged risk measures for every bank  defined as\n ()\n,\n= \n\n  \n\nand to analyze whether risk perception changes to some extent during periods of\naggregate distress, we estimate an interaction term model also with an interaction term of\nthe following form\n12 As robustness checks we utilize varying sets of control variables and use varying lags for our main variables of interest.\nFurthermore we rerun the models for private banks only, i.e without Landesbanken, savings and cooperative and\ncooperative central banks. Results do not change qualitatively or quantitatively.\n   ()\n,\n.\nThird, and most important, we expand the baseline models (3) and (6) by an alternating\nset of idiosyncratic shock variables. In detail, we compute idiosyncratic shocks at the\nbases of the creditor, respectively the borrower bank's capitalization (), credit quality\n(), liquidity () and profitability (()). Further, we specify shocks regarding\nthe bank's    and . Our framework distinctively expands those of existing\nstudies. For instance, Afonso et al. (2011) concentrate on the banks' non-performing loans\nand profitability, whereas Cocco et al. (2009) and Br\u00e4uning and Fecht (2012) do not\nexplicitly account for these and measure liquidity risks solely via reserve holdings and the\nbanks' maturity mismatch. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to\naccount for a possible non-linear behavior of these determinants by employing the\nfollowing method to determine bank-specific shocks.13 First, we construct the yearly\ndistribution of each of the above variables and divide this distribution into its ten deciles. In\na second step, we define an idiosyncratic shock as an alternating dummy variable that\ntakes the value one if the value of the respective variable for the bank has moved by 1\n(2,..., 9) decile(s) in an unfavorable direction from one quarter to another and zero\notherwise. All in all, the basic idea is to stress-test somewhat not the bank's balance\nsheets to an unfavorable macroeconomic scenario, but rather the interbank relations to\ndetect breaking points that, in turn, destabilize the interbank market itself. Hence, we\nexpand both steps of the baseline Heckman Correction models by the following term\n    \n\n\n\n\n,\nwhich determines creditor and borrower bank  specific shock variables for every\nunderlying shock variable  of any strength . It can be seen that we run a comprehensive\nset of regressions analyzes in which the idiosyncratic shock variable changes in two\n13 Results of unreported tests where we examine the effect of quadratic terms indicate a non-linear behavior of those\nunderlying bank determinants.\ndimensions. First, with regard to the potential shock, we want to analyze shocks of the\nbank's capitalization, credit quality, liquidity, profitability and risk. And, second, the\nidiosyncratic shock variable alters regarding the strength of the shock, i.e. whether it is a\nmoderate or a more serious shock, such as a heavy slip from one quarter to another\namounting to several deciles in the underlying variable's distribution.\nLastly, to analyze possible differences between the crisis and the non-crisis period we\nestimate an interaction term model with an interaction term of the following form\n      \n\n\n\n\n,\nand to answer the question of whether relationship banking, i.e. a longer and more intense\ninterbank relationship in the past, can help to overcome possible negative effects of\nidiosyncratic shocks, we expand the baseline models (3) and (6), finally, by\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n,\nWe start by presenting the results of the baseline regression model of the determinants\nof interbank lending and the effects of the 2007 financial crisis period in Table 3. To\ncapture the effect of an aggregate shock we utilize a  variable which is a time\nthis quarter, several important events happened likely to disrupt market confidence,\ntriggering general market turmoil, such as the announcement by the German bank IKB that\nit was in distress on July 30th and the close-down of two BNP Paribas funds on August\n9th.14 Additionally, we run robustness tests with altering crisis period definitions, for\nexample also splitting the crisis period into different sub-crisis periods, such as the\nare presented in Column 2, 4, 6 and 8. Nevertheless, as results applying these alternating\ndefinitions do not vary a lot either economically or statistically, we adhere to the\naggregated  definition in subsequent analyses.\nWith regard to the parameter estimates, columns 1 and 2 depict the results of the first\nstep of the Heckman Correction method where the dependent variable is Credit relation,\nwhich is a binary variable taking the value one if there is a specific lending relationship\nbetween a creditor bank C and a borrower bank B, and zero otherwise. The results of the\nsecond step of the Heckman correction method are presented in columns 3 to 8, where the\ndependent variable in columns 3 and 4 is the Exposure change in log differences, the\nlender preference index (LPI) in columns 5 and 6, and the borrower preference index (BPI)\nin columns 7 and 8, respectively.\nNot surprisingly, we detect a highly significant negative effect of  on the\nprobability of establishing an interbank lending relationship, although the effect is most\nsevere in the commercial paper and euro crisis period. The negative coefficients can be\ninterpreted to some extent as rising search costs due to the inability to assess institutions'\nrisk during the crisis. However, the actual economical effect is rather small. Unreported\nmarginal effects show a decrease of between 1.5% and 9.6% in the probability.15\nIn contrast,  distinctively affects the lender and borrower preference indexes\nleading to a higher concentration of interbank lending and borrowing. It is unclear whether\nthis is due to creditor banks tending to lend to a smaller number of banks and perhaps\nstaying with those with which they have a stronger interbank relationship. As we do not\n14 As BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing those\ntwo funds exposed to it, this date is generally seen as the start of the global credit crisis.\n15 To draw conclusions about the economic effects, we estimate both the probit model's marginal effects at mean (MEM) and\nits average marginal effects (AME) (Williams, 2011).\nobserve the price for liquidity, it could also be the case that borrower banks shift their\nborrowing to banks that provide them with cheaper liquidity. Indeed, Br\u00e4uning and Fecht\n(2012) show some evidence that, at the height of the 2007 financial crisis, relationship\nlenders charged lower interest rates than spot lenders.\nRegarding the actual interbank exposures, we do see a negative effect of  but not\na decisively strong one. Though the   coefficient is a substantially higher one\ninstituted the long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) programs in which banks could lend\nin total over a trillion euros for a period of up to three years. Following Gabrieli and Georg\n(2014) who point out that the striking increase in risk premia in the Eurozone money\nmarket in 2008Q3 was clearly subsequent to rather than before the change in the\noperational framework involving a switch from a regular variable-rate tender procedure to a\nfixed-rate full allotment policy, it is more likely that those exceptional measures are the\ncause rather than the outcome of the reduced interbank lending activity.16 Nevertheless,\naggregated interbank lending is remarkably stable over time (Gabrieli and Georg, 2014).\nFigure 1 shows the amount of quarterly interbank lending as highly aggregated, while the\nsolid line depicts interbank exposures without quarterly bank-to-bank exposures of 100\nbillion, and more and the dashed line shows aggregate interbank lending without\nexposures between banks belonging to the same BHC.17 The beginning of the aggregated\ncrisis period is indicated by the vertical bar at 2007Q3.\nAlthough we do not adjust for price changes, it can be seen, however, that interbank\nexposures are surprisingly stable over time and actually rise to some extent even in\ndistinct time frames of the crisis-period. Nevertheless, there is indeed a decrease in\n16 Unreported robustness tests show that in the full allotment period (2008Q4) itself the likelihood of interbank participation\nsignificantly drops between 1.6 and 7 percent but we do not detect reduced interbank market exposures in that nor in the\npreceding quarters. Hence, from an aggregated point of view in the case of Germany one could question the need to\nchange the operational framework. Especially as the Italian Interbank market was not affected by the 2007 financial crisis\n17 It is noteworthy that there is an upwards shift of excessive high bank-to-bank exposures of more than 100 billion since\n2007Q3. All of these cases are conducted between parent banks and their affiliated mortgage banks. But as there is in\nsome quarters of the crisis period only one such observation, we refrain from showing these data points. In general,\ntaken by the ECB.\nBesides the effects of the 2007 financial crisis period, we are particularly interested in\nthe determinants that potentially foster bank-to-bank relationships. In this regard, all\nrelationship proxies have a positive impact on the probability of renewing the lending\nrelationship as well as on the concentration measures, except  . In\nparticular, belonging to same BHC strongly enhances the probability of a credit relationship\nand also the amount lent. Unreported marginal effects show an increase of up to 25% in\nthe probability. Longer and stronger interbank relations in the past, on the other side, only\nimpact positively on the probability of continuing lending, but do not lead to higher\nexposures. In fact, the opposite is true, implying that banks tend to hesitate to terminate\nrelationships once they are established and instead prolong lending but on a reduced\nlevel, possibly avoiding risk concentration. In contrast, reciprocal lending shows the exact\nopposite results. Though it is negatively related to the probability of forming a lending\nrelationship between a specific pair of a creditor bank C and a borrower bank B, reciprocal\nlending from the initial borrower B to creditor C leads to significantly higher exposures from\nC to B in the first place. The first result regarding the lower probability of forming a credit\nrelationship due to reverse lending is not exactly odd, as it is possible to argue that\nborrower banks generally hesitate to lend during the same quarter in which they actually\nborrow. The second result however could be a initial indication that reverse relationship\nbanking has a positive effect owing to the fact that it signals the bank's own soundness.\nAnother possible explanation might be a swap in maturities. Unfortunately information on\nmaturities is not directly available in our data.\nCreditor and borrower bank specific variables reveal unexpected results insofar as\nhigher capital () and liquidity () do not to lead to higher interbank exposures. In\ngeneral, better capitalized banks seem to avoid participating in the interbank market,\nmaybe because they tend to engage in more profitable retail business rather than\ninterbank lending activities and also have different ways of financing. Indeed, creditor\nbanks with higher loans to assets ratios () are less likely to participate in the interbank\nmarket and provide less lending as well, while consequently borrowing more. Results\nregarding the creditor and borrower bank's liquidity are to some extent more puzzling, but,\nthough they are statistically significant, they are economically negligible. In contrast,\nparameter estimates of  indicate that larger banks are more likely to establish\ninterbank lending relationships and that they receive and provide more interbank financing.\nAs the borrower bank's coefficient is around seven times larger than the coefficient of the\nlender, it seems to be the case that this is not only due to the simple fact that larger banks\nare faced, on the one hand, with higher financing needs and, on the other hand, are also\ncapable of providing more lending. For one thing, these results might reflect different\nbusiness models. Descriptive statistics (Table 1 Panel A) already indicate that typically\nsmall banks, such as savings and cooperative banks, which can be characterized as retail\ndeposit gathering institutions step in as interbank creditors, while larger banks such as big,\nregional and Landesbanken are mostly liquidity recipients. Nonetheless, it could also be\nthe case that larger banks benefit from \"too-big-to-fail\" as there is a substantially higher\nlikelihood of these banks being bailed out. In quantitative terms, a borrower bank's one SD\nincrease in  enhances its interbank market borrowing capacity by around 70\npercentage points. Not surprisingly, higher profitability (()) also enhances the\nprobability as well as the amount a bank can borrow via the interbank market. Results\nregarding the concentration measures are in line with common expectations, for instance\nlarger banks lending to or borrowing from a larger number of counterparties.\nFinally, the highly significant and positive coefficient of the inverse mills ratio \nsignifies that simple OLS would indeed produce upwardly biased estimates.\nResults of the previous section reveal a remarkably stable interbank market, which was,\nin fact, affected to a high degree statistically but, on an aggregated level, not economically\nby the ongoing 2007 financial crisis. Considering the non-standard measures of the ECB\nwhich provided nearly inexhaustible cheap liquidity and which even changed its monetary\npolicy instruments owing to some banks' inability to roll over their interbank position, it\ncould be asked how the above results fit into this reality. To shed some light on this\nquestion, we expand our baseline Heckit models which consists of the probit model (3) in\nthe first and the corresponding OLS model (6) in the second step by interaction terms (8)\nand (10), that is we interact the aggregated  variable with our relationship proxies\nand risk measures. Regarding the latter, we do only report the results for the non-\nperforming loans to total loans ratio (). As a robustness check, we utilize the bank's\n   and for a sub-period since 2008Q1 the bank's  as well, but qualitatively\nresults do not change.18\nPanel A of Table 4 shows the parameter estimates of these models, while the\ninteraction term models' corresponding marginal effects at representative values ( =\n1|0) are shown in panel B. In both panels, columns 1 and 2 present results of the\nextended probit model where the dependent dummy variable is Credit relationship, and\ncolumns 3 and 4 present results of the corresponding extended OLS model with Exposure\nchange in log differences as the dependent variable.\n18 Though PD parameter estimates show negative signs, only creditor banks exhibit a statistically significant reduction of\ninterbank exposures. One possible explanation for these weak results might be given by Behn et al. (2014), who show that\nthe introduction of Basel II-type, model-based capital regulation affected the validity of banks' internal risk estimates. They\nfind that for the same firm (in our case bank) in the same year, both reported PDs and risk-weights are significantly lower,\nwhile estimation errors and loan losses are significantly higher for loans under the new regulatory approach. Thus, risk\nestimates for loans under the model-based approach systematically underestimate actual default rates. Also, results of the\nquadratic term model show a considerable decreasing effect of higher PDs for both creditor and borrower banks.\nRegarding the effects of relationship banking on interbank exposures in times of\naggregate uncertainty, columns 1 and 3 of Panel B present the marginal effects of the\nrelationship variables for the interaction term model of Panel A, that is the marginal effects\nof a longer, more intense and reciprocal interbank relationship in the aggregated crisis and\nthe non-crisis period. Generally, the effects of relationship banking on interbank exposures\nare qualitatively the same as those in the baseline model. Though banks hesitate to\nterminate bank-to-bank relationships once they have been established, it does not\ndetermine persistent interbank lending, as unlike to Affinito (2012), we do not detect a\nsignificantly positive effect of relationship banking in the crisis period. Although longer and\nmore intense relations in the past do slightly increase the probability of renewing interbank\nlending relations in both the crisis and the non-crisis period, we do not detect any positive\neffects regarding the amount lent. Only reciprocal lending again increases interbank\nexposures from the initial creditor bank. Moreover, the positive effect is in fact two times\nlarger in the crisis than during the non-crisis period. Whether this is actually due the fact\nthat the initial borrower bank signals its own soundness, since reverse lending is even\nmore important in crisis periods than in non-crisis periods or whether this is due to maturity\nswaps in this period is a matter for future research.\nThe most striking result, however, is that in contrast to Martinez-Peria and Schmukler\n(2001) and others who claim that, in periods of aggregate distress, information about\nfundamentals is diluted  we show that the exact opposite is true with regard to the 2007\nfinancial crisis. Columns 2 and 4 of Panel B present the marginal effects of the interaction\nterm risk model of Panel A. Results reveal that the risk coefficient for borrower banks is\nmore than five times larger in the crisis than during the non-crisis period. In other words, a\none SD increase in risk reduces interbank exposures by around 18.7 percentage points\nduring the crisis compared with a rather moderate decrease of 3.4 percentage points in the\nnon-crisis period. Additionally, more risky creditor banks reduce their exposures less in the\ncrisis than in the non-crisis periods and, in fact, are, overall, more likely to engage in the\ninterbank market in times of aggregate distress.19 Unreported results regarding the\nconcentration measures show that riskier borrower banks lend from more counterparties\nas the BPI coefficient is statistical highly significant negative.\nAll in all, results uncover a so far undocumented ability of the interbank market to\ndistinguish between banks of different quality in times of aggregate distress. As only the\nworst-performing banks have been rationalized by the interbank market, regulators should\nbe reluctant to step in as a lender of last resort to avoid failures in liquidity reallocation\nfostering moral hazard.20 Moreover, relationship banking does not stabilize interbank\nlending during periods of aggregate turmoil, as hard information seems to dominate soft\ninformation.\nOne major result of the previous section is that we find that, even during times of\naggregate market turmoil and high uncertainty, the intensity of interbank relations reacts to\nthe risk characteristics of the participating banks. This result suggests that idiosyncratic\nfactors might be important drivers of interbank market outcomes. Hence, in this section we\nexpand the analysis by exploring the role of a wide range of idiosyncratic bank shocks that\ncapture banks' most important determinants. As described in Section 3.2, we run a set of\nregression analyses where the idiosyncratic shock variable changes in two dimensions.\nFirst, with regard to the potential shock we want to analyze that is a shock of the bank's\ncapitalization, credit quality, liquidity, profitability and risk. And, second, the idiosyncratic\nshock variable alters regarding the strength of the shock that is whether it is a moderate or\na more serious one, i.e. a heavy slip from one quarter to another of several deciles in the\n19 In unreported tests we also examine the effect of quadratic terms of our risk measure and find a more concave risk-\nexposure relationship for borrower and a convex one for creditor banks, which confirms an increasing effect of risk for\nborrower banks and a diminishing effect for creditor banks.\n20 Indeed, unreported results show that in the full allotment period (2008Q4), that is the period where the ECB switched its\noperational framework from a regular variable-rate tender procedure to a fixed-rate full allotment policy, the markets'\nsensitivity to risk was rather impaired, as risk has a significantly negative impact on interbank borrowing outside the full\nallotment period and an insignificant one at that time. Nevertheless, this effect was not permanent, as banks generally\nexhibit a stronger sensitivity to risk in the crisis period than in the non-crisis period.\nunderlying variable's distribution.21 All in all, the basic idea is to somewhat stress-test not\nthe bank's balance sheets to an unfavorable macroeconomic scenario, but the interbank\nrelations in order to detect breaking points which, in turn, destabilize the interbank market\nand to account for their non-linear behavior.\nThe outcome of this extensive procedure is illustrated in Figure 2, where every tile\ndepicts both the sign and the significance of the regression model's bank-specific shock\nvariables.22 In detail, it depicts the parameter estimates of bank-specific shocks regarding\nthe creditor, respectively borrower bank's capitalization, credit quality and liquidity, with the\ndashed grey tiles representing significantly negative coefficients and the dotted white tiles\ndenoting significantly positive coefficients. We present results only for these idiosyncratic\nshocks as they are the most important ones, severely affecting interbank relations and\nlending.23 Generally, the left- hand side of Figure 2 shows the results of the first step of the\nHeckman selection method and the right-hand side shows the results of the second step.\nMoreover, parameter estimates of the idiosyncratic shock variables of the baseline models\n(3) and (6) expanded by the creditor and borrower bank-specific shock variables (11) are\npresented in the first and third lines and marginal effects at representative values ( =\n1|0) of the idiosyncratic shock variables of the baseline models (3) and (6) expanded by\nthe interaction term (12) are shown in the second and fourth line marked by \"in crisis\".\nStarting with idiosyncratic shocks regarding the banks' capitalization, it can be seen\nthat, similar to results of the bank characteristics in the baseline model presented in\nSection 4.1, lower capital ratios do not affect creditors' interbank exposure. In fact, even\nthe most severe creditor specific capital shocks do not affect the probability of continuing\n21 It is important to point out that the distribution of each of the underlying idiosyncratic shock variables is computed at a\nyearly base, as definitions of what constitutes an adequate or unfavourable level regarding those variables may change\nover time.\n22 Underlying regression results of all idiosyncratic shocks tested are reported in the Appendix (available on request).\n23 Similar to results of our baseline model in Section 4.1, lower profitability does not affect interbank stability at all. Even after\nvery heavy declines in profitability from one quarter to another, creditor banks do not reduce interbank lending nor do\nborrower banks face problems prolonging their interbank positions. Higher risk in terms of shocks regarding the banks' Z-\nscore or PD did not impair interbank relationships in the recent crisis either.\nlending nor the amount lent.24 Idiosyncratic borrower capital shocks do show a different\nbehavior, however, revealing two important insights. First, borrower-specific capital shocks\naffect both the probability of continuing an interbank lending relation and the actual\nexposure itself. Second, results show like in Section 4.2, some kind of revised risk\nperception as the capital shocks' negative effect is triggered earlier in the crisis period.\nNevertheless, while even moderate capital deteriorations in the distribution from one\nquarter to another have a significantly negative impact on the probability of continuing an\ninterbank relation, we do not detect an actual reduction in interbank exposures before a\nborrower banks' capital ratio slips in the crisis period four deciles in its yearly distribution\nor, in other words, after an idiosyncratic shock of the strength four. In quantitative terms,\nborrower banks suffer from capital write-offs not before generally losing 38% of their\nregulatory capital, or 43% in the crisis period.25 The actual economic effects of such a\nsevere idiosyncratic capital shock are presented in Table 5, where Panel A shows the\nparameter estimation results of the baseline Heckit models (3) and (6) expanded by the\ninteraction term (12), and Panel B depicts the corresponding marginal effects at\nrepresentative values ( = 1|0). In this regard, columns 1 and 2 present results of the\ninteraction term model where the idiosyncratic shock variable is defined as a negative one\ndecile change in the bank's capital ratio's distribution from one quarter to another. In\ncolumns 3 and 4 the shock is defined as a two decile change, and in the model presented\nin columns 5 and 6 the shock dummy variable takes the value one if the capital ratio slips\nfour deciles or more, and zero otherwise. Results show a looming negative effect of\nborrower-specific capital shocks, starting with a slight decrease in the probability of\ncontinuing lending relationship in the case of a moderate shock of the strength two. The\noutcome of the actual breaking point is presented in Column 6 of Panel B, where we detect\na reduction in lending of around 66 percentage points after a capital shock of the strength\n24 We detect negative effects only for creditor banks that are in the worst decile of the yearly capital distribution.\n25 The mean regulatory capital reduction for a borrower bank in the case of an idiosyncratic shock of the size five is 7.79\npercentage points, which refers to a capital reduction in relative terms of 38.18% regarding a mean capital ratio of 20.4%.\nIn contrast, the mean capital ratio of a borrower bank in the crisis period is 23.77% and the capital reduction in the case of\nan idiosyncratic shock of the size four is 10.12 percentage points, which amounts to a relative capital reduction of 42.57%.\nfour. Summing up, interbank relations are remarkably resistant with regard to bank-specific\ncapital shocks, that is only severe capital-write offs of around 40% actually impair lending\nrelationships. Most notable is the fact that idiosyncratic capital shocks affect interbank\nstability solely via the borrower side and even more in periods of aggregate turmoil. In\ncontrast, creditor banks do not reduce their interbank market activity independently of their\nlevel of capitalization.\nIdiosyncratic liquidity shocks show results which are quite similar to those of shocks\nregarding the banks' capitalization. Again, creditor banks seem to be remarkably resistant\nto liquidity drains, but, in contrast even small bank-specific liquidity shocks affect borrower\nbanks negatively, i.e. reducing interbank lending. Table 6 presents regression results of\ninteraction term models with the idiosyncratic shock variable alternating from a one decile\nchange in columns 1 and 2, over a two decile change in columns 3 and 4, up to a bank-\nspecific shock of the strength three in columns 5 and 6, i.e. a three decile change in the\nyearly distribution of the creditor, and the borrower liquidity ratio from one quarter to\nanother, respectively. In general, we detect a higher reduction in interbank exposures, the\nstronger the idiosyncratic shock is. But most interestingly, effects are nearly four times\nlarger in the non-crisis period than in the actual crisis period. For instance, an idiosyncratic\nshock in the crisis period of the strength three, i.e. a loss of around 34% in the borrower\nbanks' liquid assets reduces interbank exposures by 11 percentage points. In contrast, a\nbank-specific shock of the same strength in the non-crisis period leads to reduction in\ninterbank exposures of nearly 44 percentage points. One possible explanation for liquidity\nshocks affecting interbank lending less in the non-crisis than in the actual crisis period\nmight be the role played by the central bank in flooding the market with huge amounts of\nliquidity and acting as the central counterparty in large parts of the money market\nThe banks' level of capitalization and liquidity has been an important and intensively\ndiscussed issue and problems of undercapitalization and insufficient liquidity have been\naddressed at the international level not only by Basel III, for example, but also at national\nand European levels by compelling banks to hold higher capital and liquidity buffers.\nNevertheless we reveal another, so far broadly underexplored issue which plays a part in\ndestabilizing interbank market stability, namely the banks' credit quality. In contrast to\nidiosyncratic capitalization and liquidity shocks, shocks regarding the banks' credit quality\nimpair interbank relations not just from one side of the lending relationship but also from\nthe other. On the one hand, creditor banks withdraw from the interbank market by reducing\nlending and, on the other hand, borrower banks are becoming less financed as well.\nTable 7 provides some detailed results on the interaction models' parameter estimates,\nwhere columns 1 and 2 depict shocks of the strength one, columns 3 and 4 show shocks\nof the strength four, and columns 5 and 6 contain shocks of the strength eight. In line with\nresults on the banks' capitalization, idiosyncratic credit quality shocks affect borrower\nbanks distinctly more during the crisis period than in the non-crisis period. And, similar to\ncapitalization shocks, we see a looming effect of credit quality shocks first affecting the\nprobability of continuing the interbank lending relation, and, since a slip of three deciles in\nthe distribution of the underlying variable, an increasing reduction of interbank exposures\nstarting with a lending cut of 11percentage points, which ultimately adds up to a reduction\nof more than 75 percentage points in the case of a severe idiosyncratic shock of the\nSo far we have demonstrated that idiosyncratic shocks heavily disturb interbank lending\nrelations and can potentially impair market stability itself. As in Section 4.2, one can ask\nwhether relationship banking in the form of a longer and more intensive interbank\nrelationship in the past can help to overcome the negative effects of idiosyncratic shocks.\nTo answer this question, we further expand both steps of the baseline Heckman Correction\n26 These results are to some extent mirrored by the ones of the quadratic term models which show for creditor banks a\nconvex and for borrower banks a more concave relationship between the non-performing loans to total loans ratio and\ninterbank exposure indicating a decreasing effect for the former and an increasing effect for the latter.\nmodels (3) and (6) by the interaction term (13), that is we interact the creditor and borrower\nbank-specific shocks with our relationship proxy variables.\nIn contrast to Cocco et al. (2009), Affinito (2012) and others who present empirical\nevidence that relationship banking indeed helped to overcome market turmoil in the recent\nfinancial crisis, our results show that hard information dominates soft information. Tables 8\nto 10 show parameter estimates of the interaction term models, where columns 1 and 2\npresent the regression coefficients and columns 3 and 4 the corresponding marginal\neffects at representative values (  = 1|0).27\nTable 8 shows that the negative effects of a capital shock of the strength five cannot be\nundone either by a longer or a more intensive interbank relation in the past or even by\nreciprocal lending. It should be borne in mind that an idiosyncratic capital shock of that\nstrength is the weakest possible shock that impairs interbank lending in general. Results of\nmore severe shocks are analogous to those presented and imply that, in contrast to the\nliterature on bank-firm customer relationships which predicts that banks ensure the\navailability of credit to customer firms when these firms are in trouble, does not hold in a\nbank-bank context. As the interbank market is able to distinguish between banks of\ndifferent quality even in times of aggregate distress, hard information seems to dominate\nsoft information.\nLikewise, Table 9 presents results of the case where a creditor or a borrower bank is hit\nby an idiosyncratic liquidity shock of the strength one which represents a slip of one decile\nin the underlying variable's yearly distribution. Though we do not detect a significant\npositive effect of relationship banking in terms of a longer and more intensive relationship,\nwe do again present some evidence that reciprocal lending has a number of benefits if the\nborrower bank has been hit by such an idiosyncratic liquidity shock. A one SD increase in\nreciprocal lending that is lending from the initial borrower bank B to the creditor bank C,\nincreases interbank lending by between 6 and 13 percentage points in the first place.\n27 We report marginal effects at representative values only for cases where the idiosyncratic shock exhibits an interbank\nlending reduction for the first time, that is in its weakest definition.\nThe positive effect of reciprocal lending also shows up in cases where either the\ncreditor or the borrower bank is hit by a shock regarding its credit quality (Table 10). As\nidiosyncratic shocks regarding the banks credit quality affect interbank lending from both\nsides of the interbank lending relationship, Panel A in Table 10 presents estimation results\nand the corresponding marginal effects of a credit quality shock of the strength one which\naffects creditor banks in particular and Panel B shows results of a shock the strength five\nwhen borrower banks also start to suffer from an exceptionally strong increase in their non-\nperforming loans to assets ratio (NPLR). In this regard, a one SD increase in reciprocal\nlending increases interbank lending to the stressed borrowing bank by between 16 and 22\npercentage points and by between 12 and 14 percentage points even when it is the\ncreditor bank that is in stress.\nAll in all, results show that relationship banking is not distinctively capable of\novercoming bank-specific, i.e. self-induced problems, as hard information seems to\ndominate. Only reciprocal lending does, to some extent, increase interbank lending\nactivity, maybe due to signaling effects or maturity swaps.\nWe employ a broad range of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our\nfindings. In general, we conduct various robustness checks on our overall dataset, such as\nthe level at which we correct for outliers, the overall sample that we analyze, and the\nutilized merger correction procedure. We also conduct checks on the definition of our main\nvariables of interest and the models' distinct specification for testing.\nWe start with sensitivity analyses for the overall structure of our database. For the first\nset of control variables, namely bank characteristics, we delete outliers except for Size at\nthe 1% level, but rerun our specifications without carrying out any outlier correction\nmeasures. In general, we utilize varying sets of control variables, such as alternative\ncapital, liquidity and profitability ratios and specifications without bank group controls, or\nwithout any set of control variables at all. Regarding the sample size, we rerun the models\nfor private banks only, that is without Landesbanken, savings and cooperative banks and\ncentral institutions of cooperative banks, as well for a sub-period since 2008 where we are\nable to utilize the banks' estimates of their counterparty's probability of default (PD).\nResults qualitatively do not change. Finally, a number of bank mergers took place between\nthe first quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2012. Therefore, we carry out a merger\ncorrection procedure by creating a new separate bank after the merger takes place.\nGenerally, the duration of the relationships still amounts to nearly three years, which\nshould be a sufficient amount of time to overcome asymmetric information due to\nrelationship banking (Rochet & Tirole, 1996). Nevertheless, results are robust to alternative\nspecifications.\nSecond, regarding our main variables of interest, such as the relationship proxies, we\nuse varying lags especially for those utilized in the baseline specification with\ncontemporaneous values. Further, beyond splitting the aggregated crisis period into\nstarting points of these crises periods, we analyze a set of periods of special interest; for\ninstance, periods in which the ECB switched its operational framework from a regular\nvariable-rate tender procedure to a fixed-rate full allotment policy. Results show that in the\nfull allotment period in 2008Q4 itself the likelihood of interbank participation drops\nsignificantly by between 1.6 and 7 percent, but we do not detect reduced interbank market\nexposures in that period or in the preceding quarters. Regarding the risk measure, we\nutilize not only the non-performing loans to total loans ratio (NPLR) but also the bank's Z-\nscore, such as the bank's PD for a sub-period since 2008Q1.\nAbove and beyond that, as we identify idiosyncratic shocks to be the most important\ndeterminants of interbank market stability, we examine a broad range of model\nspecifications and modify the definition of an idiosyncratic shock in several ways. First, we\nredefine idiosyncratic shocks so that a shock is associated only with a drop into the second\nquartile of the distribution of the underlying shock variable. In other words, the shock\ndummy variable does not take the value one in those cases where the borrower or the\ncreditor bank experiences a quarter-to-quarter slip, say, in their capital or liquidity ratio\ndistribution from a high to a moderate point, but at least into the 50th percentile. Second,\nwe extend our models by a dummy variable that takes the value one if a bank is already in\nthe worst decile of the underlying variable's distribution, as those banks by definition do not\nexhibit an idiosyncratic shock. Results do not differ substantially from the ones presented;\nat the most, effects are to some extent even more pronounced. Finally, we examine the\neffect of quadratic terms, which do indeed display a non-linear behavior. For instance, we\nfind a more concave risk-exposure relationship for borrower banks and a convex risk-\nexposure relationship for creditor banks, confirming an increasing effect of risk for\nborrower banks and a diminishing effect for creditor banks.\nAlongside the main idiosyncratic shocks presented, which severely affect interbank\nrelations and lending, we also examine shocks of creditor banks' and borrower banks' Z-\nscores, PD and profitability.28 As in results of our baseline model in Section 4.1, lower\nprofitability does not affect interbank stability at all. Even after extremely sharp declines in\nprofitability from one quarter to another creditor banks do not reduce interbank lending nor\n28 See Appendix (available on request)\ndo borrower banks face problems in prolonging their interbank positions. Higher risk in\nterms of shocks regarding the banks' Z-score did not impair interbank relationships in the\nrecent crisis either. Similar to liquidity shocks, results show a difference between the crisis\nand the non-crisis periods as lower Z-scores destabilize interbank lending more in the non-\ncrisis period than in the actual crisis period. In fact, lower Z-scores only reduce interbank\nlending in the non-crisis period (Appendix Table A10). Results regarding higher\nprobabilities of default are to some extent sketchy, as we only detect interbank exposure\nreductions of up to 7.4 percentage points after a creditor, or borrower PD shock of the size\nof one (Appendix Table A5). One possible explanation might give Behn et al. (2014), who\nshow that the introduction of Basel II-type, model-based capital regulation affected the\nvalidity of banks' internal risk estimates. Also, results of the quadratic term model show a\nconsiderable decreasing effect of higher PDs for both creditor and borrower banks.\nThough the importance of interbank relations for the distribution of liquidity is well\nrecognized, the main drivers that foster the persistence and the strength of interbank\nrelations or trigger their collapse are as yet unknown. In this study we present novel\nevidence of the microeconometric determinants of banks' bilateral positions. In particular,\nwhile existing research is mostly concerned with the effects of aggregate shocks, such as\nthe 2007 commercial paper crisis or the Lehman insolvency, on the functioning of\ninterbank relations, we focus on the so far underexplored importance of idiosyncratic bank\nshocks that is shocks with regard to distinct individual bank's balance sheet positions. By\ndisentangling the effects and the inherently differing information content of aggregate and\nidiosyncratic shocks, we provide evidence of whether some banks' inability to roll over their\ninterbank positions in the recent financial crisis was due to a failure of the interbank market\nin reallocating liquidity efficiently within the banking sector itself, i.e. a frozen interbank\nmarket, or rather to revised bank-level risk perceptions that lead to a stressed money\nmarket.\nOur results clearly confirm the latter proposition. Though detecting a statistically\nsignificant but small reduction in the bank-to-bank exposures due to the crisis we clearly\nidentify idiosyncratic shocks to be substantially more important for the recent disruptions\non the interbank market. Indeed, banks avoid terminating interbank relationships, but,\neconomically and statistically, they reduce their exposures based on hard information\nabout their peers.\nMoreover, identifying idiosyncratic shocks as the main driver disrupting interbank\nlending, we also analyze the effects of risk taking and reciprocal behavior on the banks'\nbilateral exposures and test whether relationship banking can outweigh the negative\neffects induced by bank-specific shocks. Unlike earlier studies which find that relationship\nbanking helps to overcome financial instability, we show distinct evidence that, except\nreciprocal lending, this is not the case for the German interbank market. Neither longer nor\nmore intense interbank relationships in the past contain the negative effects of either\naggregate or idiosyncratic shocks regarding the banks' capital, credit quality or liquidity.\nSumming up, our results show that the inability of some banks to roll over their\ninterbank position and the ensuing financial market turmoil were not due to a failure of the\ninterbank market per se but rather to bank-specific shocks affecting the banks' capital,\nliquidity and credit quality. Most importantly, the results uncover a so far undocumented\nability of the interbank market to distinguish between banks of different quality in times of\naggregate distress.\nREFERENCES\nAffinito, M.

The LHS variable for the second\nstep is \"Exposure change\" in log differences (Column 2 and 4). For the the right hand side variables (RHS) we\nuse all variables of the baseline regression model augmented by the interaction terms of the bank-specific\nshock variable and the relationship proxies whereas the table presents in Panel A estimation results of an\nidiosyncratic shock the strength one, that is an unfavourable change in the underlying variable's distribution\nfrom one quarter to another of one decile and in Panel B results of an idiosyncratic shock the strength five.\nYes\nfive decile change"
