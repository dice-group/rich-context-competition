    "abstract": "Abstract\nValproic acid is a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant that has also gained attention in the psychiatric\nsetting. With respect to safety, valproic acid may induce a seemingly rare condition,\nhyperammonemia, which can induce a wide variety of symptoms ranging from irritability to\ncoma. The proposed mechanism of hyperammonemia involves depletion of carnitine and\noverproduction of a toxic metabolite, 4-en-valproic acid, both of which impair the urea cycle\nand thus ammonia elimination. Carnitine is a commonly used antidote for acute intoxication of\nvalproic acid, but is not a therapeutic option for management of chronic adults with adverse effects\nrelated to valproic acid. We herein report a case involving a woman with epilepsy who developed\nhyperammonemia after a change in her anticonvulsant therapy. She reported increased seizures\nand gastrointestinal disturbances. Her ammonia, valproic acid, 4-en-valproic acid, and carnitine\nlevels were monitored. Her ammonia level was elevated and her carnitine level was at the inferior\nlimit of the population range. She was supplemented with carnitine at 1 g/day. After 1 month, her\nammonia level decreased, her carnitine level increased, and her seizures were better controlled.\nCarnitine supplementation was useful for reversal of her hyperammonemia, allowing her to\ncontinue valproic acid for seizure control.\n",

The carba-\nmazepine was stopped and lamotrigine\n(LTG) was added at 300 mg/day. After\nseveral months of treatment, the patient\npresented with increased seizures, cephalea,\nand nausea and was referred to our service\nfor monitoring. Her hepatic and renal func-\ntion was normal. At that time point, she was\ntrough VPA level was measured using a\npreviously described validated high-perfor-\nmance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tech-\nnique with minor modifications,9 and her\n2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-en-VPA) level\nwas determined using the same technique.\nThirty microliters of internal standard (octa-\nnoic acid) was added to 1 mL of plasma.\nA Phenomenex Luna CN 5 mm column\nphase.

The patient was then\nmonitored 2 months later at the doctor's\nrequest; the results are shown in Table 1.\nWith addition of the LCAR, the ammonia\nlevel decreased to within the reference range.\nThe metabolite concentration also\ndecreased, while the LCAR level increased\nafter supplementation, as expected, from a\nborderline-low concentration to a normal\nvalue.10 Finally, the ACYLCAR/LCAR\nratio decreased due to resolution of the\nLCAR deficiency.\nThis study was conducted in accordance\nwith the principles of good clinical practice\nand the Declaration of Helsinki and was\napproved by the Ethics Review Committee\nof the Faculty of Chemistry (Uruguay).

It was initially considered to be a\nsafer alternative to first-generation anticon-\nvulsants and free of serious side effects.\nHowever, some reports have associated\nVPA with fulminant hepatitis, a Reye-like\nsyndrome, and encephalopathy. Although\nhyperammonemia has also been reported,\nlittle attention has been paid to its preva-\nlence. One report stated that up to 50%\nof patients taking VPA developed\nhyperammonemia, although they were\nWith respect to its pharmacokinetics,\nVPA is highly protein-bound and undergoes\nextensive liver metabolism. During its elim-\nination, VPA follows three main routes:\nglucuronidation (50%), b-oxidation in the\nmitochondria (40%), and o-oxidation\n(10%); the latter leads to formation of a\ntoxic metabolite, 4-en-VPA.13 This metab-\nolite impairs the function of carbamoyl\nphosphate synthetase (CPS), which cata-\nlyzes the conversion of ammonia in the\nfirst step of the urea cycle.14 Consequently,\nthe ammonia level rises. However, this is not\nthe only factor affecting ammonia elimin-\nation. In the b-oxidation pathway, VPA\nmust cross the mitochondrial membrane\nvia the carnitine shuttle, as fatty acids do.\nLCAR depletion may occur in patients\nreceiving high doses of VPA or who experi-\nence acute intoxication, which may in turn\nresult in less b-oxidation of fatty acids\n(including VPA), less acetyl-CoA produc-\ntion, and decreased synthesis of N-acetyl\nglutamic acid, an allosteric activator of\nCPS.15 As b-oxidation decreases, o-oxida-\ntion of VPA is favored and higher levels of\n4-en-VPA are formed, which enhances CPS\ninhibition as described above.\nA well-established risk factor for hyper-\nammonemia in the neurological literature\nis the combination of VPA with other\nantiepileptic medications, particularly\nTable 1.

The mechanisms of action are thought\nto be related to an increase in the production\nof toxic VPA metabolites because all of them\nare inducers of the o-oxidative pathway.16\nCase reports have also raised the possibility\nthat hyperammonemia results from an inter-\naction between the effects of VPA and\nIn our patient, no VPA or ammonia\nmonitoring was performed while she was\ntaking carbamazepine and VPA. LTG is\nmainly eliminated by glucuronidation and\ncompetes with VPA for this metabolic route.\nThe addition of LTG may have enhanced\ndeviation of VPA metabolism to oxidative\nroutes favoring the production of 4-en-VPA\n(by o-oxidation) because b-oxidation was\nimpaired by LCAR depletion.19 All of these\nprocesses in combination could have led to\nthe development of hyperammonemia, the\nconsequences of which (seizures) are difficult\nto differentiate from the pathology itself\n(epilepsy) and that can be misdiagnosed as\ntherapeutic failure instead of an adverse\ndrug reaction related to the use of VPA.\nHence, seizures might be seen as the final\nstep of the excitatory symptoms of hyper-\nammonemia due to the increase in glutamate\nneurotransmitter synthesis.20\nExogenous supplementation of LCAR\nhas been proposed to prevent the develop-\nment of hyperammonemia. In Uruguay,\nhowever, this strategy has only been applied\nin the pediatric setting. Collectively, the\navailable evidence provides a reasonable\nargument for the role of LCAR supplemen-\ntation in certain cases of childhood-onset\nepilepsy.21,22 However, well-designed stu-\ndies of LCAR replacement therapy in chil-\ndren with epilepsy are still needed. LCAR\nsupplementation was useful for resolution of\nour patient's VPA-related adverse drug\nreaction. This is important knowledge for\nclinicians, who might otherwise change the\ntherapeutic strategy in such patients.\nLCAR supplementation not only favors\nammonia elimination but also restores\nVPA metabolism to normal routes, increas-\ning b-oxidation and thus decreasing\no-oxidation and therefore 4-en-VPA forma-\ntion. The metabolic ratio decreased after\nLCAR addition. This can be explained by the\nhigher impact that the decrease in carnitine\nhas on the kinetics of 4-en-VPA, which is also\na fatty acid. The ACYLCAR/LCAR ratio\nalso decreased and was maintained within the\nreference ranges reported in the literature.11\nThe ammonia level also returned to the\nWide variation exists in the doses and\nroutes of administration of LCAR, making\nit challenging to identify the optimal dosing\nstrategy.23 A dose of 1 g/day was proposed\nas the initial dose in the present case, but as\nthe patient's condition improved, this dose\nwas maintained as long as the VPA treat-\nment continued.\nThe patient's renal and liver function\nremained normal despite her elevated\nammonia, VPA, and 4-en-VPA levels.\nMonitoring of the ammonia level is\nadvisable in adult patients undergoing\nchronic VPA treatment, and LCAR supple-\nmentation could be a solution to this VPA-\nassociated adverse drug reaction.\nThe main limitation of this study is that\nthe case report included only one patient.\nDespite the usefulness of this intervention,\nmore patients still need to be studied to draw\nstronger conclusions.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n\u00a8 scher W.
