Physicians who derive at least 85% of their practice revenue\nfrom managed care plans were considerably less likely to provide charity care and spend\nfewer hours providing charity care than physicians with little involvement in managed\ncare plans (P = .01). In addition, physicians who practice in areas with high managed\ncare penetration provided fewer hours of charity care than physicians in other areas,\nregardless of their own level of involvement with managed care (P.01). Differences\nin charity care provision were also shown for other important factors, including own-\nership of the practice and practice arrangements (more charity care occurred in solo\nand 2-physician practices; P.01).\nConclusion Physicians involved with managed care plans and those who practice\nin areas with high managed care penetration tend to provide less charity care.\ncommunity in which they practice, we\nexamine the level of managed care in\nphysician practice as well as managed\ncare penetration at the market level. We\nalso consider other important character-\nistics of physician practice, including\npractice arrangements and whether the\nphysician owns his or her practice.\nMETHODS\nData Source\nThe data for this study are from the Com-\nmunity Tracking Study physician sur-\nsurvey was designed to be representative\nofdirectpatientcarephysiciansinthecon-\ntinental United States, as well as in se-\nlectedcommunitiesorsites.Thefirststage\nof sample selection involved the selec-\ntion of 60 sites.19 Metropolitan sites were\ndefined based on Metropolitan Statisti-\ncal Areas as defined by the Office of Man-\nagement and Budget, while the Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis Economic Areas were\nused to define nonmetropolitan sites.\nThe 60 sites were selected with prob-\nability in proportion to population to en-\nsure representation of all US physicians\nand were also stratified to ensure diver-\nsity by region and size. The sample of\nphysicians for each of the 60 sites was\nrandomly drawn from the American\nMedical Association (AMA) and the\nAmerican Osteopathic Association Mas-\nterfiles. The sample includes active non-\nfederal office- and hospital-based phy-\nsicians in selected specialties who spend\nat least 20 hours per week in direct pa-\ntient care. While primary care physi-\ncians were oversampled, radiologists, an-\nesthesiologists, pathologists, and a few\nnonpatient care specialists (eg, legal\nmedicine) were excluded. Residents and\nfellows were also excluded. The aver-\nage length of the telephone interview was\nsites completed the survey between Au-\nsicians constitute an overall response rate\nof 65%. Physicians practicing in certain\ntypes of settings were excluded from this\nanalysis, including those employed by\nmedical schools, government-owned fa-\ncilities, federally funded community\nhealth centers, and industrial clinics.\nThese physicians were excluded either\nbecause the issue of charity care is not\nparticularly relevant (in the case of in-\ndustrial clinics) or because these facili-\nties have an explicit mission to serve the\nmedically indigent and they receive pub-\nlic subsidies to do so. After these exclu-\nsions, the total sample of physicians for\nAll estimates presented in this article\nwere weighted to be representative of all\nnonfederal patient care physicians in the\ncontinental United States. Weights were\nconstructed to allow nationally repre-\nsentative estimates to be produced from\nthe 60 sites and to restore proportion-\nality to the sample arising from survey\nnonresponse, the clustering of the sample\ninto 60 sites, and oversampling of pri-\nmary care physicians. The weights were\nexplicitly adjusted to reflect the distri-\nbution of physicians by age and spe-\ncialty for the nation as well as for each\nsite, based on the AMA Masterfile. All es-\ntimates were produced using the\nSUDAAN software package, which also\nadjusts the SEs of estimates to take into\naccount the complex sample design.20\nDependent Variable\nDuring the interview, physicians were\nasked the following question: \"During the\nlast month, how many hours, if any, did\nyou spend providing charity care? By this\nwe mean, that because of the financial\nneed of the patient you charged either\nno fee or a reduced fee. Please do not in-\nclude time spent providing services for\nwhich you expected, but did not re-\nceive payment (ie, bad debt).\"\nThis question was derived from the\nAMA Socioeconomic Monitoring Sys-\ntem survey,2 although estimates of char-\nity care are not directly comparable be-\ncause the 2 surveys use different reference\nperiods when asking about charity care.\nIndependent Variables\nTheextentofmanagedcareinvolvement\nwas measured as the percentage of total\npractice revenue derived from managed\ncare plans. In the survey, managed care\nwasdefinedtoincludeplanssuchashealth\nmaintenanceorganizations(HMOs),pre-\nferred provider organizations, indepen-\ndent practice associations, and point-of-\nservice plans, including Medicare and\nMedicaid managed care plans. This also\nincludes managed care revenue received\nbyphysicianswhotreatpatientsonanout-\nof-network basis. The percentage distri-\nbution of the weighted sample of physi-\ncians by percentage of practice revenue\nfrom managed care plans is shown in\nTABLE 1. The average percentage of rev-\nenuefrommanagedcarecontractsforall\nphysicians--44%--isidenticaltothees-\nnomic Monitoring System survey.21\nManaged care penetration at the site\nlevel was measured by computing a\nweighted average for each site of the per-\ncentage of physicians' total practice rev-\nenue from managed care plans and then\nmerging the site-level averages onto the\nsample of physicians. This measure is\nhighly correlated with the more com-\nmonly used \"HMO penetration\" mea-\nsure (which refers to the percentage of\npersons at the site enrolled in HMOs) de-\nP.001) and is used in this study be-\ncause it is a more direct indicator of \"fi-\nnancial pressure\" in the market. The dis-\ntribution of the weighted physician\nsample by managed care penetration at\nthe site level is shown in Table 1.\nThe analysis also controls for a wide\nrange of physician, practice, and other\nTable 1.

A question on\nwhether the physician was a full or part\nowner of his or her practice was asked\nseparately from the questions about prac-\ntice arrangements and is also included\nin the analysis.\nOther practice characteristics include\nwhether the practice accepts any new pri-\nvately insured or Medicaid patients, per-\ncentage of revenue from Medicaid pa-\ntients,physician'sincomerelativetohours\nworked, and hours spent providing pa-\ntientcareinthepreviousweek.Adichoto-\nmous variable, whether the physician\npracticed medicine throughout the pre-\nceding year, was also included because\nsome information (eg, annual income)\nonly reflects part of the preceding year for\nphysicians who were not practicing the\nentire year. Variables are also included for\nsex, years of practice, board certifica-\ntion, and whether the physician is an in-\nternational medical graduate. Specialty\ncategories are identified as family prac-\ntice,generalinternalmedicine,generalpe-\ndiatrics, medical specialties, and surgical\nspecialties.\nMarket measures were used to control\nfor the variation in the (potential) de-\nmand for and supply of charity care. The\npercentage uninsured at the site (de-\nrived from the Community Tracking\nStudy household survey)is used as amea-\nsure of the demand for charity care, while\nsupply measures include the number of\npublic hospital beds, teaching hospital\nbeds, and hospital emergency depart-\nments at the site (all obtained from the\nnualSurvey).23 Thesemeasureswerestan-\ndardized relative to the number of unin-\nsured persons at the site. It was not\npossible to fully assess the effects of all tra-\nditional safety net providers--including\ncommunityhealthcentersandlocalhealth\ndepartments--on physician charity care\nbecause of the lack of data. The number\nof nonfederal physicians per capita at the\nsite was also included.\nAnalysis\nWe initially separated the decision to pro-\nvide any charity care from the amount\nof charity care physicians provide, given\nthat they provide any. Logistic regres-\nsion was used to estimate the likeli-\nhood of providing any charity care, while\nordinary least squares (OLS) regression\nwas used to estimate the log of the num-\nber of hours spent providing charity care\n(given that physicians provided any). Log\nhours were used because of the highly\nskewed distribution of charity care hours.\nTo account for some nonlinearity in\nthe relationship between managed care\nrevenue and charity care, binary vari-\nables representing different levels of prac-\ntice revenue from managed care were\nused in both regressions. However, a con-\ntinuous measure of managed care pen-\netration at the site level was used be-\ncause initial tests indicated that this\nassociation was strictly linear.\nWe then derived expected values from\nthe 2 regression equations to summa-\nrize the effects of managed care on phy-\nsician charity care provision. To do this,\npredicted values for the probability of\nproviding any charity care (based on the\nlogistic regression) were computed for\nthe various levels of managed care rev-\nenue at the practice level and site level.\nFor physicians who provided any char-\nity care, predicted values for the num-\nber of charity care hours by level of man-\naged care revenue (practice and site level)\nwere computed from the OLS regres-\nsion. Because the OLS regressions were\nbased on the log of the number of char-\nity care hours, it was necessary to \"un-\ntransform\" the predicted values back to\ntheir original scale. Because untrans-\nformed values may be biased and incon-\nsistent with the original scale, a \"smear-\ning factor\" based on the exponentiated\nmean of the regression residuals was used\nto adjust the predicted values of charity\ncare hours.24 Although the smearing fac-\ntor itself may be biased when the residu-\nals are heteroscedastic,25 tests indicated\nthat this was not a problem with re-\nspect to managed care revenue.\nExpected values for total charity care\nhours were then obtained by comput-\ning the product of the 2 individual pre-\ndictions for each level of managed care\nrevenue (practice and site level).\nRESULTS\nOverall, 77.3% of physicians in our study\nprovided some charity care in the month\nprior to the interview (data not shown).\nPhysicians who provided some charity\ncare spent an average of 10.3 hours on\ncharity care. The regression results show\nthat physicians with the heaviest level of\ninvolvement with managed care plans\n(85% of practice revenue) are signifi-\ncantly less likely to provide any charity\ncare (TABLE 2, column 1) and provide\nfewer hours of charity care (column 2)\ncompared with physicians with only 1%\nto 20% of practice revenue from man-\naged care (P.01). However, physi-\ncians with 0% of revenue from man-\naged care were less likely to provide\ncharity care than physicians who de-\nrived some revenue from managed care\nplans (P.01). On the other hand, for\nthose physicians who provided some\ncharity care, those with no involvement\nwith managed care provided the high-\nest number of hours. In addition, higher\nmanaged care penetration at the site level\nwas associated with fewer charity care\nhours (P.01), but did not have statis-\ntically significant effects on the likeli-\nhood of providing charity care.\nThe results also show that practice ar-\nrangementsandownershiparesignificantly\nrelatedtocharitycare.Theoddsofprovid-\ningcharitycareforphysiciansinmedium\nandlargegrouppracticeswereabouttwo\nthirds that of physicians in solo and 2-\nphysicianpractices(P.01),whiletheodds\nofprovidingcharitycareforphysiciansin\nstaff and group model HMOs were only\nabout one third that of physicians in solo\nand 2-physician practices (P.01).

However, there is very little differ-\nence between physicians with 21% to\npractice revenue from managed care.\nThus, differences in overall charity care\nprovision occur primarily at the 2 ex-\ntremes of managed care involvement.\nRegardless of the physician's level of\ninvolvement with managed care, those\nwho practice in areas with high man-\naged care penetration (defined as 2 SDs\nabove the average for all sites) provide\nabout 25% fewer hours of charity care\nthan physicians who practice in areas\nwith low managed care penetration (de-\nfined as 2 SDs below the average), al-\nthough the differences by level of man-\naged care penetration in the market\nappear smaller than differences in char-\nity care based on physician's practice rev-\nenue.\nCOMMENT\nOur results suggest that physicians who\nare more heavily involved with man-\naged care plans and who practice in mar-\nkets with high managed care penetra-\ntion provide less charity care, perhaps\nbecause greater financial pressures limit\ntheir ability to cross-subsidize care for the\nmedically indigent by shifting the costs\nonto third-party payers. However, it is\nimportant to point out that this expla-\nnation would reflect an unintended con-\nsequence of the more aggressive cost-\ncontrol methods used by managed care\nplans, rather than explicit and direct at-\ntempts by managed care plans to limit\ncharity care provision. In other words,\nany type of cost control (whether aris-\ning from the private market or public\npolicy decisions) could result in the same\nbehavioral response by physicians.\nIt is also important to note that the\ncausal mechanism attributed to these re-\nsults--financial pressure--was not mea-\nsured directly in this study. Further-\nmore, because the study was based on\ncross-sectional rather than longitudinal\ndata, the results do not allow us to con-\nclude with certainty that an increase in\nmanaged care over time is resulting in a\ndecrease of physician charity care. There-\nfore, alternative explanations for these\nfindings need to be considered.\nItispossiblethatbecausemanagedcare\nplanstypicallyhavelowerdeductiblesand\nother copayments, physicians who are\nheavilyinvolvedwithmanagedcareplans\nseefewerunderinsuredpatients.However,\nitislikelythatmuchoftheunpaidcopay-\nmentsanddeductiblesareconsideredbad\ndebt,whichwasexplicitlyexcludedfrom\nourcharitycaremeasure.Also,anyreduc-\ntions in charity care because of lower co-\npaymentsmaybeoffsetbymorefrequent\ndelays or denials of care because of the\nstricterutilizationcontrolsusedbyman-\naged care plans.\nThe findings relating to managed care\natthepracticelevelmayreflectsomeself-\nselectiononthepartofphysicians.Given\nthat charity care comprises a very small\namount of a physician's practice (an av-\nerageofabout5%oftotalpracticehours),\nwe believe it unlikely that physicians in\nour study sample make major decisions\nabouttheirpracticearrangementsandrev-\nenue sources based on how much char-\nitycaretheywanttoprovide.Itisalsopos-\nsiblethatphysiciansself-selectintoprac-\nticeswithdifferentlevelsofmanagedcare\nand charity care based on other criteria,\nandtheresultsreflectthis\"sorting\"rather\nthanthedirecteffectsofmanagedcareper\nse.

While our\nsurvey did not include questions on ter-\nminations or denials of contracts with\nmanaged care plans, our data show that\nphysicians who provide a lot of charity\ncare do not have significantly fewer con-\ntracts with managed care plans than phy-\nsicians who provide less. Also, it is un-\nclear why the relatively small amount of\ncharity care provided by an individual\nphysician would be a major concern to\nmanaged care plans or how plans would\neven know the extent of charity care be-\ning provided given the lack of data on\ncharity care.\nOne exception to the general trend was\nthat the small group of physicians who\ndid not have any involvement with man-\naged care plans were less likely to pro-\nTable 3.

Expected values are derived from the\nlogistic regression analysis and the ordinary least squares regression analysis (Table 2). The predicted values from\nthe logistic regression equation were transformed back to the original scale to produce predicted probabilities of\nproviding charity care, while the predictions from the weighted least squares regressions (based on the log of the\nnumber of charity care hours) were transformed back to their original scale using a smearing method to produce the\npredicted number of charity care hours. For each cell in this table, the predicted probability was multiplied with the\npredicted number of charity care hours to derive the overall average number of charity care hours.\nDefined as the percentage of revenue from all managed care plans averaged across all physicians at a given site.\nAverage managed care penetration reflects the mean for all sites, low managed care penetration is based on 2 SDs\nbelow the mean, and high managed care penetration is based on 2 SDs above the mean.\nvide any charity care than physicians with\nsome managed care involvement, al-\nthough those who do provide some char-\nity care tend to provide more than phy-\nsicians who are involved with managed\ncare. Additional analysis showed that\nthese physicians have been practicing\nlonger, are much more likely to be in solo\npractice, work fewer hours, have lower\nincomes, and are more likely to have\nclosed practices than other physicians in\nour sample. It is possible that some of\nthese physicians prefer to keep their prac-\ntices small and exclusive, are highly se-\nlective about the patients they see, and\nwould prefer to avoid potential compli-\ncations arising from managed care and\npatients who lack the ability to pay.\nOtherfindingsalsoillustratethepoten-\ntial effects of health system changes on\ncharity care, particularly the increasing\nnumberofphysiciansaffiliatedwithlarger\nand more formally organized groups.\nCharitycareprovisiontendstobegreater\nin solo practices or small groups where\nphysicians own all or part of their prac-\ntice.Itispossiblethatphysiciansinlarger\ngroup practices provide less charity care\nbecausethelargerandmoreformalstruc-\nturesofthesesettingsintentionallyorun-\nintentionally result in greater organiza-\ntional barriers. In addition, \"employed\"\nphysicians may have less autonomy and\ndiscretion in treating medically indigent\npatients.\nThe results show that the relative num-\nber of uninsured persons in a commu-\nnity (as a measure of the demand for\ncharity care) is not significantly related\nto physician charity care, although it is\npossible that the level of aggregation for\nthe measure (based on entire metropoli-\ntan and nonmetropolitan areas) was too\nlarge to detect any significant effects. Phy-\nsician charity care may be more af-\nfected by the level of demand closer to\ntheir own practice (eg, the neighbor-\nhood).\nWhile findings for the effects of tra-\nditional safety net providers on physi-\ncian charity care are incomplete because\nof the absence of data on community\nhealth centers and other free clinics, the\nresults do show that physicians tend to\nprovide more charity care in areas with\nrelatively fewer public hospitals or hos-\npitalemergencydepartments,whichsug-\ngests that physicians do pick up some of\nthe excess demand for indigent care in\nareaswheretheseprovidersarelesspreva-\nlent.

Increases in the\nnumber of uninsured persons they serve\nwould severely strain their already lim-\nited resources for indigent care, which\ncould result in a reduction or rationing\nof this kind of care. Thus, a signifi-\ncantly decreased role in serving the un-\ninsured by private practice physicians\ncould negatively affect access to care for\nthe uninsured directly, as well as indi-\nrectly because of the increased burden\non an already fragile safety net.\nFunding/Support: The Center for Studying Health Sys-\ntem Change is supported in full by the Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation, Princeton, NJ.\n"
