The recent development of a non-\ninvasive measure of nicotine metabolism, the nicotine metabolite ratio (trans-3#-hydroxycotinine/cotinine), makes it\npossible to examine the association between rate of nicotine metabolism and smoking behavior in the general\npopulation. This US study examined group differences in the ratio measured in urine and the association between\nthe ratio and multiple measures of smoking behavior and nicotine dependence in a large, national representative\nthe National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health. Nicotine dependence was measured by using the\nFagerstro\n\u00a8m Test for Nicotine Dependence. Females had higher nicotine metabolite ratios than males; Whites\nand Hispanics had higher nicotine metabolite ratios than African Americans or Asians. This finding is consistent\nwith those from laboratory studies of older smokers based on intravenous infusion of nicotine. No significant\nassociation was found between the nicotine metabolite ratio and number of cigarettes smoked per day or nicotine\ndependence.

Nicotine is metabolized primarily to cotinine (COT),\nwhich is itself metabolized to trans-3#-hydroxycotinine\n(3HC) (1). The rate of nicotine metabolism has been hy-\npothesized to affect smoking patterns, including extensive-\nness of smoking, progression of smoking, persistence of\nsmoking, and nicotine dependence (2\u00ad4). Persons who me-\ntabolize nicotine rapidly may need to smoke more exten-\nsively to achieve the same level of nicotine in the body as\nthose who metabolize nicotine slowly (5).

Results are inconsistent. Some studies\nshow that adult and adolescent smokers with CYP2A6 gene\nvariants associated with very slow nicotine metabolism\nsmoke fewer cigarettes per day than smokers with normal\nor intermediate rates of metabolism, whereas those with\na very fast metabolism smoke more cigarettes (2\u00ad4, 10\u00ad\n13). Other studies have failed to find these associations\n(e.g., 14\u00ad17). Patterns regarding dependence appear to dif-\nfer among adolescent and adult smokers. Among adults,\nslow metabolism is associated with decreased rates of de-\nadolescents with a slow metabolism are more likely to pro-\ngress to dependence (13). A recent study found that adoles-\ncents with the slowest CYP2A6 activity were most likely to\nremain current smokers by age 18 years (21).\nExamination of the hypothesis that nicotine metabolism\nis associated with smoking behavior requires large popula-\ntion samples with measures of smoking and nicotine metab-\nolism. Until recently, this type of study was unfeasible. The\nmost direct method for assessing the rate of nicotine me-\ntabolism requires intravenous infusion of nicotine and mea-\nsurement of serial blood levels, which can be accomplished\nin a laboratory setting only (22). However, it has recently\nbeen shown that the nicotine metabolite ratio of 3HC to\nCOT in plasma or saliva is highly correlated with oral clear-\nance of nicotine and is thought to index CYP2A6 activity\n(9). 3HC/COT ratios in urine and plasma are highly corre-\nlated (9). The 3HC/COT ratio differs significantly in persons\nwith CYP2A6 gene variants associated with reduced en-\nzymatic activity compared with variants associated with\nnormal activity, although the ratio across gene variant\ngroupings overlaps considerably (23). The development of\nthis noninvasive technique makes it possible for the first\ntime to examine the association between nicotine metabo-\nlism and smoking behavior in the general population.\nBenowitz et al. (24) used this noninvasive approach in\na self-selected sample of 72 mainly White adult smokers.\nThe urine nicotine metabolite ratio was significantly corre-\nlated with number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD),\nespecially among Whites, but was uncorrelated with the\nFagerstro\n\u00a8m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).

We also examine the excretion of\nnicotine metabolites in urine as indicators of daily intake of\nnicotine and their associations with smoking behavior and\nnicotine dependence. Because of its large size and multieth-\nnic representation, this sample is well suited for examining\nsubgroup differences in rates of nicotine metabolism. These\ndifferences are of particular interest given the differences\nin smoking patterns across racial/ethnic groups documented\nin epidemiologic studies.

CPD\nwas lower in women than men and was lower in minorities\nthan Whites. Minorities, especially African Americans and\nAsians, started smoking a whole cigarette at a later age than\nWhites, on average 1.5 years later. Hispanics and Asians\nscored lower than Whites on the FTND (table 1). Compared\nwith males, females experienced fewer pleasant and more\nunpleasant symptoms with their initial cigarette; African\nAmericans experienced fewer unpleasant symptoms than\nWhites did.\nDistributions of nicotine metabolite excretion data\nThe distribution of the absolute urine 3HC/COT ratio in\nthe sample is displayed in figure 1. Distributions of the\nlogged ratios by race/ethnicity are shown in figure 2.\nThere were strong gender and racial/ethnic differences in\naverage values of the 3HC/COT ratio. It was higher among\nwomen than men, higher among Whites than African Amer-\nicans, and lowest among Asians (table 2).\nCorrelates of the 3HC/COT ratio\nThere were significant gender and racial/ethnic associa-\ntions with the ratio (table 3). In the total sample, when we\ncontrolled for other covariates, there were two highly sig-\nnificant predictors: gender, with females having a higher\nratio than males; and race/ethnicity, with African Americans\nand Asians having a lower ratio than Whites. The same\nracial/ethnic differences were observed among females,\nwhereas, among males, only Asians had a lower ratio than\nWhites. Among females, higher age at onset of smoking\na whole cigarette was negatively associated with the ratio.\nThere were several racial/ethnic subgroup differences.\nWhite and Hispanic females had higher ratios than males;\nthe reverse was observed among Asians. Higher education\nwas positively associated with the ratio among African\nAmericans. At the univariate level, unpleasant symptoms\noccurring during the initial smoking experience were nega-\ntively associated with the ratio among Hispanics, and pleas-\nant symptoms and dizziness were negatively associated\namong Asians. After we controlled for other covariates, un-\npleasant symptoms were the only symptoms of initial sen-\nsitivity that remained significant among Hispanics, as was\nfound for dizziness among Asians. With control for other\ncovariates, none of the other variables included in the\nNicotine Metabolite Ratio and Patterns of Smoking 903\nmodels--CPD, nicotine dependence (FTND), or body mass\nindex--had any unique association with the ratio in any\nracial/ethnic group.\nIn their sample of heavy smokers, Benowitz et al. (24)\nreported a significant association between CPD and the ra-\ntio. To parallel this analysis among heavy smokers in this\nsample, we identified those who met criteria for dependence\naccording to the FTND and those who did not, excluding the\nCPD item.

Although not precise, COT\nlevels have been used to indicate daily nicotine intake.\nBecause 3HC is the major urinary metabolite of nicotine,\nthe sum of COTand 3HC may be a better measure than COT\nalone of total daily nicotine intake. There was a significant\ncorrelation between total FTND score and COT, 3HC, and\nthe sum of these two metabolites (table 4).

We examined these associations with\na noninvasive method for assessing nicotine clearance, the\nnicotine metabolite ratio of 3HC (the major metabolite of\nCOT) over COT (the proximate metabolite of nicotine). The\n3HC/COT ratio in plasma or saliva is highly correlated with\noral clearance of nicotine and is thought to be a marker of\nOur sample is of particular interest because young adults\nare often in an early stage of developing nicotine addiction.\nWe focused on only daily smokers, for whom the urine\nmetabolite data were the most useful given the relative short\nhalf-life of these metabolites. The average number of ciga-\nrettes smoked was 12 per day, well below the national av-\nerage of 16.8 per day (38). The average FTND score for our\nsubjects was 3.3, indicating a relatively low level of depen-\ndence. Men smoked on average more cigarettes than women,\nand Whites smoked considerably more than African Amer-\nicans, Hispanics, or Asians. Racial/ethnic differences in\nrates of smoking are consistent with those for young adults\nin their twenties in the general population observed in other\nAs indicators of daily intake of nicotine, we used urine\nconcentration of COT and the sum of COT and 3HC. In gen-\neral, the findings for COTand 3HC were similar. These mea-\nsures were significantly associated with CPD, as expected,\nand with sex, race/ethnicity, and education--reflecting dif-\nferences in cigarette smoking in these subgroups. The COT,\n3HC, and COT \u00fe 3HC measures were also significantly cor-\nrelated with total FTND score and the individual items. The\nstrongest correlations were with time to smoking the first\ncigarette after awakening and CPD. These findings are con-\nsistent with those from many (but not all) prior studies that\nhave documented that extent of dependence on nicotine is\nrelated to daily intake of nicotine (41).\nAs an indicator of nicotine intake per cigarette, we exam-\nined COT concentration normalized for number of ciga-\nrettes smoked. This index of nicotine intake per cigarette\nwas considerably higher in African Americans compared\nwith other racial/ethnic groups. Similar findings have been\nreported using plasma or saliva COT normalized for ciga-\nAs a phenotypic marker of the rate of nicotine metabolism,\nwe examined the distribution of the nicotine metabolite ratio in\nthe total sample and among racial/ethnic subgroups.

At this time, we cannot explain the\nobservation that the metabolite ratios were greater for women\nthan men among Whites and Hispanics only. Of note is that the\nrate of nicotine metabolism was slower in African Americans\nand Asians than in Whites or Hispanics.

Perhaps we\nhad very few very slow metabolizers, although this possi-\nbility would be surprising given the substantial number of\nAsians, among whom the prevalence of slow metabolizers is\nhigher, in our population. We speculated that the lack of\nrelation between the nicotine metabolite ratio and cigarette\nuse is associated with the relatively low level of smoking\n(average CPD \u00bc 12) among our subjects, who may not have\nbeen as nicotine dependent or whose smoking may have\nbeen more constrained by environmental restrictions com-\npared with older, heavier smokers studied by other investi-\ngators. Our speculation was not supported by additional data\nanalysis. The association was still null within each of four\ngroups varying in the extensiveness of smoking. Our data\nsuggest that the rate of nicotine metabolism is not an im-\nportant determinant of smoking behavior in young smokers.\nTitration of nicotine intake with related changes in smoking\nbehavior due to individual variation in the rate of nicotine\nmetabolism appears to be more relevant to smokers in a more\nmature stage of nicotine addiction.\nSimilarly, among our subjects, there was no relation be-\ntween the nicotine metabolite ratio and level of dependence.\nWe also examined response to the first smoked cigarette of\nthe day because it might predict progression from experi-\nmentation to addictive smoking. The rate of nicotine metab-\nolism would be expected to influence how long nicotine\nstays in the body and potentially the experience from smok-\ning the first cigarette. We found no association between the\nratio and the response to the first cigarette. We found sig-\nnificant associations between the nicotine metabolite ratio\nand some initial sensitivity responses by sex and race/\nethnicity: heart pounding in men, unpleasant symptoms in\nHispanics, and dizziness in Asians. In these subgroups, slow\nmetabolizers experienced more adverse symptoms from\ntheir first cigarette. Why this finding was observed in some\nsubgroups but not others is not clear. As in all subgroup\nanalyses, replication in future studies is needed.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the utility of using\nurine nicotine metabolite measurements to study racial/\nethnic and sex differences in smokers and smoking behavior\namong young adults. Our findings with respect to sex and\nrace/ethnicity differences in nicotine metabolite ratio gener-\nally replicate results regarding nicotine metabolism from\nstudies of older smokers that used more invasive laboratory\nmethods. The noninvasive urine metabolite ratio approach\ncan be used for large population studies in which more in-\nvasive methods are unfeasible. Replication of findings\namong young adult smokers is important to understanding\nhow smokers differ early in their smoking history, before\nthey have reached the maximal level of nicotine dependence.\nA limitation of our study is that we considered only daily\nsmokers--that is, chronic smokers who had already devel-\noped some level of nicotine dependence. Further studies are\nneeded to determine how differences in nicotine metabolism\npredict the transition from experimental smoking to addic-\ntion and the ability of addicted smokers to quit. That the rate\nof nicotine metabolism may influence these behaviors is\nsuggested by studies of the CYP2A6 genotype showing\ndifferences in very slow metabolizers compared with\nothers, although the patterns may differ at different phases\nof the life cycle. Since genetically defined very slow\nmetabolizers account for only a small percentage of all\nsmokers, measurement of a nicotine metabolism phenotype,\nsuch as the nicotine metabolite ratio, is needed for popula-\ntion studies.\n"
