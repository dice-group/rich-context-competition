This rate was lowest in the 5- to 24-\nyear age group and highest in the oldest 2 age groups. In\ncontrast, the infectious diseases visit rate was highest in\nthe youngest age group and decreased with age until the\n65- to 84-year age group, after which the visit rate lev-\neled off. In general, the proportion of all visits attribut-\nable to infectious diseases decreased with age. Infec-\ntious diseases accounted for 45% of all visits in 0- to 4-year-\nolds but only 15.9% of visits in all other age groups\ncombined.\nVisit rates for all diagnoses and visit rates for\ninfectious diseases were higher for females than for\nmales (Table 2, and Figure 2). Compared with the\nvisit rate for males, that for females was 41% higher\noverall and 27% higher for infectious diseases. For\ninfectious diseases, this difference resulted from dis-\nparities in visit rates in the age groups between 5 and\n84 years. There was no significant difference in infec-\ntious disease visit rates between boys and girls aged 0\nto 4 years or between men and women 85 years old\nand older.\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed data from the NAMCS from 1980 through\n1996.7 The NAMCS is a national probability sample sur-\nvey that has been conducted by the NCHS in each year be-\nThe sampling frame of the survey includes physi-\ncians in the American Medical Association and American\nOsteopathic Association master files who are (1) office\nbased, (2) principally engaged in patient-care activities,\n(3) not federally employed, and (4) not in the specialties\nof anesthesiology, pathology, or radiology. Within this\nframe, physicians are chosen according to a multistage\nprobability sampling design. Chosen physicians are then\nasked to collect information on a random sample of\npatient visits during the course of a randomly selected\nFor each visit, the physician or office assistant fills out\na 1-page form that includes questions about the patient's\ndemographic characteristics, the principal diagnosis made\nat the visit, other diagnoses, tests ordered, and medica-\ntions prescribed. Information on the forms is then entered\ninto the database by staff at the NCHS, and diagnoses are\ncoded according to the International Classification of Dis-\neases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).9 Each visit is assigned a weight\nequal to the reciprocal of its probability of selection to ob-\ntain national estimates.\nsicians participated in the survey (participation rate, 70%\nvisits were sampled.\nPopulation data were obtained from the US Bureau of\nCensus. Intercensal or postcensal estimates of the civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population were used in all calcula-\ntions of rates. The populations of Hawaii and Alaska were\nstates were not included in the surveys performed in those\nyears.\nWe used a previously described protocol to classify ICD-9\ncodes according to whether they were infectious or non-\ninfectious.5 We restricted our analysis to those diagnoses\nthat are always or almost always caused by infectious agents.\nInfectious diseases were grouped into 10 categories of re-\nlated conditions (Table 1) that accounted for 94% of all\ninfectious disease visits. A category of \"other infectious dis-\neases\" was created for the remaining 6% of visits.\nData were analyzed with SAS software (SAS Institute Inc,\nCary, NC). Standard errors of point estimates of the num-\nber of visits were calculated according to algorithms pub-\nlished in the documentation for the public use data tapes.8\nOnly principal diagnoses were considered in the analy-\nses. All visit records were weighted by using weights sup-\nplied on the public use data tapes. Analyses used either (1)\nthe visit rate, expressed as the number of visits per 1000\npersons per year, or (2) the visit proportion, expressed as\na percentage of all visits that year attributed to the particu-\nlar diagnosis. Visit rates and visit proportions were com-\npared by means of t test or 1-way analysis of variance, as-\nsuming no covariance between the groups. When data from\nseveral years were combined to give a single estimate, the\nSE of this estimate was calculated according to algorithms\nrecommended by the NCHS (Iris M.

The model included\nthe year as the independent variable and the age-adjusted\nnumber of visits in each year as the dependent variable. For\neach year, the point estimate of number of visits was\nweighted with the inverse of its variance. The model was\nsegmented, allowing the slope before a designated pivot\npoint to be different from that afterward. To decide where\nto place this pivot point, the point was varied from 1981\nto 1995 and the model was fit to the data. The model that\nproduced the lowest residual sum of squares was chosen.\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association.

The visit rates among non-\nHispanic whites were 43% higher overall and 11% higher\nfor infectious diseases than rates for Hispanics.\nThe segmented linear regression model fit the data best\nwhen the pivot point was placed at 1990.

Within these categories, as in most of the\ncategories, a small number of diagnoses accounted for\nmost of the visits (Table 4).\nDuring the 1980s, significant increases in visit\nrates were seen in the 3 largest categories of infectious\ndiseases (upper respiratory tract infections [P = .02],\notitis media and otitis externa [P = .001], and lower\nrespiratory tract infections and influenza [P = .008])\nas well as in enteric infections (P = .02; Table 3).\nBecause visits for all 4 of these categories were increas-\ning faster than all visits, the proportion of visits attrib-\nutable to diseases in these categories also increased\nsignificantly.\nOf the disease categories, only sexually transmit-\nted diseases declined during this period. The decline in\nvisit rate was not statistically significant, but, because over-\nall visits were increasing during this time, there was a\nsignificant decline in the proportion of visits attribut-\nable to this category (P = .04).\nDuring the 1990s, visit rates for 6 infectious dis-\nease categories decreased: otitis media and externa\n(P = .02), skin infections (P = .02), urinary tract infec-\ntions (P = .04), vaginitis and cervicitis (P = .001), sexu-\nally transmitted diseases (P = .001), and enteric infec-\ntions (P = .008).

These measures provide con-\nservative estimates of the impact of infectious diseases\non outpatient medicine, because they include only con-\nditions that are always or almost always caused by in-\nfectious agents. Numerous conditions that are often a di-\nrect result of infectious diseases, especially chronic and\nneoplastic diseases such as hepatic cirrhosis and cervi-\ncal cancer, were not examined.\nAdditionally, certain outpatient visits fall outside the\nscope of NAMCS. Visits to emergency departments and to\nhospital-based outpatient clinics are captured in a sepa-\nratesurvey,theNationalHospitalAmbulatoryMedicalCare\nin the 1995 survey12 with the use of criteria from this study\nshows that infectious diseases accounted for 21.5% of the\nestimated96.5millionvisitstoemergencydepartmentsand\nbased clinics. Government-sponsored health clinics, such\nas sexually transmitted disease clinics, military clinics, and\nprison clinics, fall outside the scope of both surveys.\nTrends in visits for infectious diseases were not uni-\nform during the course of our study. It is clear that visits\nfor infectious diseases increased slightly from 1980 un-\ntil the early 1990s and that infectious diseases consti-\ntuted an increasing proportion of illness seen by outpa-\ntient practitioners. But the magnitude of this increase was\nsmall compared with that seen for the infectious disease\nmortality rate5 or the proportion of hospitalizations for\ninfectious disease.6\nInfectious disease visits have declined slightly since\n1990. The reason for this decline and the increase that\npreceded it is unclear. Infectious disease visit rates de-\npend not only on the incidence of disease but also on fac-\ntors such as access to care, current diagnostic practices,\nand the availability of over-the-counter medications.\nVisits for certain categories of infectious diseases de-\nclined during the study, most prominently for vaginitis\nand cervicitis and for sexually transmitted diseases. The\ndecrease in vaginitis and cervicitis mostly reflects a de-\ncline in unspecified vaginitis and candidal vaginitis, which\naccounted for 82.8% of the visits in this category.

First, the\nsurvey is not large enough to provide precise estimates\nof visits for most specific diseases. Second, the diag-\nnoses used are clinical diagnoses given by the physician\nat the time of the patient visit and often have not been\nconfirmed by laboratory tests. It is possible that many of\nthe visits attributed to infectious diseases in the survey\nare actually the result of noninfectious conditions such\nas allergies that are sometimes clinically indistinguish-\nable from certain infectious diseases. Third, diagnoses\nin the survey are not assigned according to uniform case\ndefinitions.\nThree indicators of overall burden of infectious dis-\neases increased during the 1980s: the mortality rate at-\ntributable to infectious diseases,5 the proportion of hos-\npitalizations attributable to infectious diseases,6 and the\nrate of ambulatory visits for infectious diseases. Many fac-\ntors, such as the emergence of acquired immunodefi-\nciency syndrome, the reemergence of tuberculosis, and\nthe increase in antibiotic resistance, probably contrib-\nuted to this increase. The trends in the 1990s have been\ndifferent. Ambulatory visits for infectious diseases have\ndeclined, while infectious disease mortality may have\nleveled off (G.L.A. and R.W.P., unpublished data, 1998).\nInterpretation of these trends is complex, given the di-\nverse, sometimes offsetting factors that influence them--\neg, the impact of protease inhibitors on improved\nsurvival in persons with acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome, increased public health efforts to control\ntuberculosis, and structural changes in health care\ndelivery that have resulted in trends toward fewer\nhospitalizations and outpatient visits. It is clear, how-\never, that many dynamic factors continue to promote\nthe emergence of infectious diseases and that trends in\nthe infectious disease burden will probably continue to\nfluctuate.\nThis work was supported by a National Foundation for\nInfectiousDiseases\u00adMerckPostdoctoralFellowshipinEmerg-\ning Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Md (Dr Armstrong).\nPresented in part at the International Conference on\nREFERENCES\n1.
