The Bayesian model takes into account the proportions of polled subjects who favor each\ncandidate and the proportion who are undecided, and produces a posterior probability that each candidate will win each\nstate. From this, a dynamic programming algorithm is used to compute the probability mass functions for the number of\nelectoral votes that each presidential candidate receives and the number of Senate seats that each party receives. On the\nfinal day before the 2012 election, the model gave a probability of (essentially) one that President Obama would be reelected,\nand that the Democrats would retain control of the U.S. Senate. In 2014, the model gave a final probability of .99 that the\nRepublicans would take control of the Senate.\n",

Members of the House of\nRepresentatives serve 2-year terms, while Senators serve\n6-year terms and the President serves a 4-year term. As such,\nevery House seat and approximately one third of the Senate\nseats are up for election during each election cycle (2-year\nperiod), with presidential elections occurring every other\ncycle. Collectively, the Senate and House constitute the two\nchambers of Congress, and control of each chamber is deter-\nmined by the political party that possesses a majority of the\nchamber's seats. Control of the presidency is determined by\nwhichever party's candidate is elected. There is a great deal\nof interest in predicting which party will control which\nchambers of Congress and the presidency.\nRigdon, Jacobson, Cho, Sewell, and Rigdon (2009) pro-\nposed a Bayesian model to estimate the probability that a\npresidential candidate would win each particular state given\nthe available polling data, and then combined the state-by-\nstate predictions into an overall probability of a candidate\nwinning the presidency by using the dynamic programming\nalgorithm of Kaplan and Barnett (2003). This article dis-\ncusses an extension of the original model to handle Senate\nmodel was used to make forecasts throughout the election\ncycle, with updates occurring when new polling data became\navailable. All results were made available on the Election\nAnalytics project website. Results for 2012 can be found at\nhttp://election12.cs.illinois.edu while results for 2014 can be\nfound at http://electionanalytics.cs.illinois.edu.\nThe remainder of this article proceeds as follows. The\n\"Background\" section presents more details on the national\nelection process in the United States and highlights some\nrelated work in the area of election forecasting. \"The\nForecasting Model\" discusses the model of Rigdon et al.\n(2009), the dynamic programming algorithm of Kaplan and\nBarnett (2003), and how both can be adapted to handle\ncess of making daily forecasts for them. Concluding remarks\nare presented in the final section.\nBackground\nIn presidential races in the United States, the winner is deter-\nmined through votes in the electoral college and not through\na direct popular vote. Electoral votes are allocated to the\nstates based on the number of senators and representatives\nthat they have, for a total of 538.

To secure the presidency, a\ncandidate must win an absolute majority (270 or more) of the\nelectoral votes. Because of this, predictions for the presi-\ndency should use forecasts for the outcomes in each state to\ndetermine the likely electoral vote totals of each of the\ncandidates.\nWithin the U.S. Senate, each state has two senators, each\nof whom serves a 6-year term. Approximately one third of\nthe seats in the Senate are up for election every other year,\nand the election cycle is set up such that no state ever has\nboth its seats up at the same time (barring special elections to\nhandle unexpected vacancies). There are currently 100 sena-\ntors, so each election usually involves 33 or 34 seats. Control\nof the Senate belongs to the party that holds a simple major-\nity (51 or more) of the seats.\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives, states receive a\nnumber of representatives in proportion to their population\n(as measured during the most recent census), with the total\nnumber of representatives across all states set at 435.\nRepresentatives serve 2-year terms, and thus seats in the\nHouse are up for election every 2 years. As with the Senate,\ncontrol is typically defined by having a simple majority of\nthe seats (218+). For both the House and the Senate, predic-\ntions for which party will have control of the chamber should\nrely on race-by-race polls to forecast the results of the indi-\nvidual races, and then combine these results to forecast the\ntotal number of seats that each party secures.\nElection forecasting has received a great deal of scholarly\nattention over the years. As new sources of information\nbecome available, researchers continue to hunt for any\ninsights and trends that can be found. Numerous forecasting\nmodels have been presented that make use of these insights\nand the available data in a variety of ways (Brown &\n2013). Some models rely on fundamentals such as economic\nindicators, candidates' incumbent status, campaign spend-\ning, and historical trends to predict the outcomes of the cur-\nrent election, while other models utilize pre-election polling\ndata at the national and state levels to construct forecasts.\nThese two sources of information can also be combined. For\na more detailed review of election forecasting models, see\nThe Bayesian model of Rigdon et al. (2009) attempts to\nestimate the true proportion of voters for each candidate in\neach race on election day. These estimates are initially based\non prior election results and are updated using race-specific\npolls as they become available throughout the election cycle.\nThe forecasts provided by the model are perhaps more appro-\npriately called snapshots, as they summarize the current state\nof knowledge about the likely voter preferences and repre-\nsent the outcomes if the election were held on that day. The\nfocus of this article is to demonstrate how the original model\nof Rigdon et al. (2009) can be extended to handle Senate\nraces, and also to provide a summary of the application of the\npublished online and updated throughout the election cycle\nat the project website.

The former\nis described in section \"The Bayesian Model\" while the latter\nis described in section \"The Dynamic Programming\nAlgorithm.\" The assumptions and limitations of this fore-\ncasting approach are described in section \"Assumptions and\nLimitations.\"\nThe Bayesian Model\nThe Bayesian model of Rigdon et al. (2009) utilized polling\ndata for each of the individual races to predict which candi-\ndate will win each race. These data came from polls con-\nducted by various organizations throughout the election\ncycle, with each poll summarizing the voting preferences of\na sample of individuals from the (potential) voting popula-\ntion. Individuals' responses varied depending on the specif-\nics of the race, and Rigdon et al. (2009) considered responses\nindicating preferences for the Democrat, the Republican, any\nindependent or third-party candidate, and undecided in a\npresidential poll. These categories are usually reasonable for\nthe presidential election because very few independent or\nthird-party candidates are competitive. However, this may\nnot be the case in Senate races. As such, the model of Rigdon\net al. (2009) needed to be adjusted to allow for more poten-\ntial responses in polling data.\nPriors and polling data. Polling results can be broadly classi-\nfied into k categories, where k depends on the specifics of\nRigdon et al. 3\nthe race. Categories 1 through k - 2 correspond to com-\npetitive candidates in the race (e.g., Democrat, Republican,\nleading Independent), category k -1 corresponds to all non-\ncompetitive candidates, and category k corresponds to\nundecided. In U.S. national elections, it has typically been\nthe case that k  5, implying that there are at most three\nviable candidates. Generalizing the model to allow for an\narbitrary value of k ensures that it can be applied to a wider\nset of elections.\nGiven a set of k voting categories, let pi , 1 2\n  -\ni k ,\nrepresent the proportion of voters who intend to vote for can-\ndidate i on election day, let pk-1 represent the proportion of\nvoters who intend to vote for any non-competitive candidate,\nand let pk represent the proportion of voters who remain\nundecided until election day, with pi  0 for 1  i  k and\npi\ni\nk\n=\n=\n. Let p = ( )\np p pk\n, , ,\n\nbe the vector of\nproportions, which is unknown until the actual election. In\nthe Bayesian model of Rigdon et al. (2009), the prior for p\nis a Dirichlet distribution with parameters b b bk\n, , ,\n\n; the\nprior probability density function is\nf\nb\nb\np p p\ni\ni\nk\ni\ni\nk i\nb\ni\ni\nk\ni\ni\nk\ni\np\n( ) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( )\n =\n=\n=\n-\n= =\n\n\n \n\n\n, , .\nThe parameters bi are chosen to reflect prior beliefs about\nthe actual values for pi . For the presidential race, Rigdon\n= \u00d7 \u00d7\n.\nFraction of votes for\nDemocrat in previous elect\ntion\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= \u00d7 \u00d7\n.\nFraction of votes for\nRepublican in previous ele\nection\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n= \u00d7 \u00d7\n.\nFraction of votes for all other\ncandidates in pr\nrevious election\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n= \u00d7\n. .\nFor the Senate races, the bi can still be constructed using rules\nsimilar to the above, but it is less clear which previous election\nresults should be used. Possible choices include the results of\nthe last general election for any Senate seat in a given state, the\nresults of the last general election for the seat currently up, or\nthe results of the last special election in the state for either\nSenate seat or for the seat that is currently up. The Senate\nmodel presented here used the results of the last election (gen-\neral or special) for the specific seat that was up. (Thus, in\nthe Senate seat held by Kyl through 2012 were used to con-\nstruct priors, while the priors for Massachusetts were based on\nthe results from the 2010 special election between Brown and\nCoakley, as Brown's seat was up in 2012.) When an incum-\nbent candidate is present, this approach uses the results of the\nmost recent race in which the candidate was (re-)elected.\nAdditional historical election results and other race fun-\ndamentals such as economic indicators can also be used to\nconstruct the prior parameters for the Bayesian model, and\ndoing so can potentially improve the accuracy of initial fore-\ncasts. However, the model of Rigdon et al. (2009) relied pri-\nmarily on polling data, and as such the choice of priors had a\nrelatively minor impact on the outcomes after polls become\navailable. Because of this, more complicated schemes for\nconstructing priors were not considered. Other forecasting\nmake more comprehensive use of race fundamentals.\nOnce the priors for a particular Senate race have been\ndetermined, they are updated using appropriate polling data\nas they become available. Polls are assumed to follow\na multinomial distribution, with the random vector\nX = X X Xk\n, , ,\n\n( ) representing the numbers of indi-\nviduals in a poll of size n whose voting intentions fall in\neach category. The likelihood function for the multino-\nmial distribution is\ng\nn\nx\np x x n\ni\ni\nk i\nx\ni\nk\ni i\ni\nk\ni\nX p\n|\n!\n!\n, , .\n( ) =  =\n=\n= =\n\n \nBayes's theorem can then be applied to obtain the posterior\ndistribution\nh C f g\nb x\nb x\np\ni i\ni\nk\ni i\ni\nk i\nbi\np X p X\n| | p\n( ) = ( ) ( )\n=\n+\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n( )\n=\n=\n+\n\n\n\n\nx\nx\ni\ni\nk\ni\ni\nk\ni p p\n-\n= =\n =\n \n, , ,\nwhere C is a proportionality constant that ensures the poste-\nrior integrates to one. Thus, p given X is Dirichlet distrib-\nuted with parameters b n\ni i\n+ , 1  i  k.\nOnly race-specific polls are used, as they are likely to be\nthe most reliable indicators of actual voter turnout in a par-\nticular race. Although national polls or polls from other races\ncould be used to supplement races with infrequent polling\n(Linzer, 2013), such an approach was not incorporated here.\nThe justification for not doing so is because races with infre-\nquent polling are (typically) polled infrequently for a reason:\none candidate is very strongly favored over the remaining\ncandidates (either from initial polling data, historical trends,\n4 SAGE Open\nor both), and so the outcome is believed to be known.\nEvidence for this is presented in Figure 1, which plots the\nmargin of victory against the number of polls in a state.\nBecause of the inverse relationship between these two quanti-\nties, using external polls to update races with infrequent poll-\ning is not likely to significantly alter the forecast for that race.\nWhen multiple polls are available for a race, the data are\nweighted based on how recently the poll was conducted. If\nthree or more polls are available within the past 2 weeks,\nthen polls within the past week have a weighting factor of 1,\npolls between 1 and 2 weeks old have a weighting factor of\n0.5 (i.e., the sample size is reduced by half while the propor-\ntions for each candidate remain constant), and polls older\nthan 2 weeks have a weighting factor of 0. If two or fewer\npolls are available within the most recent 2 weeks, then the\nthree most recent polls are used, with polls within the past\nweek having a weighting factor of 1 and polls older than 1\nweek having a weighting factor of 0.5. If no polls are avail-\nable for a race, then only the priors are used.\nMore sophisticated weighting schemes for polling data\nare certainly possible, including a more complicated decay\nfactor or correcting for house effects (Jackman, 2005; Linzer,\nincluded in the original model of Rigdon et al. (2009), nor\nExtending the model to include these components is a pos-\nsible direction for future research.\nComputing a candidate's probability of winning.The Bayesian\nmodel produces a posterior distribution of the true propor-\ntion of voters ( , , , )\np p pk\nwho fall in each of the voting\ncategories for a given race. From this, the goal is to find the\nprobability that each competitive candidate (1 through k - 2)\nwill win the race. How the undecided voters split their vote\non election day may also influence the outcome of the race.\nIf wi is the proportion of undecided voters who vote for can-\ndidate i on election day (1 2\n  -\ni k ), with wi  0 and\nwi\ni\nk\n\n=\n-\n, then the probability that candidate j wins can\nbe found by integrating the posterior distribution h p X\n|\n( )\nover the region defined by the following inequalities in\n( )\nk -1 -dimensional space:\nNumber of Polls\nMargin of Victory\nAL\nAK\nAZ\nAR\nCA\nCO\nCT\nDE\nFL\nGA\nHI\nID\nIL\nIN\nIA\nKS\nKY\nLA\nME\nMI\nMN\nMS\nMO\nMT\nNE\nNJ\nNM\nNY\nNC\nND\nOH\nOK\nOR\nPA\nRI\nSC\nSD\nTN\nTX\nUT\nVT\nVA\nWA\nWV\nWI\nWY\nDC\nFigure 1.

Note that this assumes all candidates in voting\ncategory k -1 are uncompetitive, and hence cannot win. In\naddition, if wi\ni\nk\n=\n-\n <\n1, then some of the undecided voters\neither voted for an uncompetitive candidate or did not vote at\nall.\nThe selection of the wi values can be used to represent\ndifferent possibilities for the behavior of undecided voters.\nRigdon et al. (2009) considered five different swing scenar-\nios for the 2008 presidential election, with these choices rep-\nresenting between 0, 5, and 10 percentage point swings of\nundecided voters toward one of the two primary party candi-\ndates. All results presented in this article are for a neutral\nsplit of undecided voters, though the 2012 website also\nshows forecasts for other scenarios.\nWhen no swing is present (i.e., w w wk\n= = = -\n\n) the\nregion of integration is somewhat simplified because the last\nset of inequalities can be replaced by p p\nj i\n for\n<= <=\ni k - , and i  j. Rigdon et al. (2009) demonstrated\nhow the integration process works for two competitive can-\ndidates under the no swing scenario. In this case, a double\nintegral needs to be computed to determine the probability\nthat Candidate 1 wins, which occurs when p p\n> . In addi-\ntion, the probability that Candidate 2 wins is just one minus\nthe probability that Candidate 1 wins. The presence of more\nthan two competitive candidates or a non-uniform undecided\nsplit for the candidates requires the evaluation of three or\nmore integrals. After computing the appropriate integrals,\nthis process yields the posterior probability that each candi-\ndate wins the race given the available polling data.\nmultiple competitive independent candidates, so at most\nthree competitive candidates (Democrat, Republican, and\nIndependent) were needed. The 2012 races with three com-\npetitive candidates were Maine, with Dill (D), Summers (R),\nand King (I) and Maryland, with Cardin (D), Bongino (R),\nand Sobhani (I). In 2014, only the race in Kansas featured\nthree competitive candidates at any point in time, with Taylor\n(D), Roberts (R), and Orman (I). However, Taylor dropped\nout in September, resulting in a two-way race once his name\nwas officially removed from the ballot. To simplify the inte-\ngration procedures for these races, it was further assumed\nthat the trailing candidate would not win, and so only the\npotential proportions of voters for the leading two candidates\nwere compared. This assumption was justified by the polling\ndata: Initial polls in both Maine and Maryland indicated that\none candidate was clearly leading (polling at or above 50%),\nand these candidates maintained their leads through election\nday. As such, the Bayesian model consistently predicted with\nprobability 1.0 that the proportion of votes received by these\nleading candidates would exceed the proportion of votes\nreceived by the runners-up. Thus, the probability that the\nthird-place candidate in the polls would receive more votes\nthan the leading candidate was safely assumed to be zero.\nThis assumption allowed the two-candidate model of Rigdon\nSenate races. However, had the polling data indicated a close\nthree-way race between the candidates, the general model\nwould have been required. For the 2012 House races, all\nindependent candidates were considered non-competitive.\nHouse races were not considered in 2014.\nAdditional considerations.An additional complication for the\nSenate model occurs due to the later primaries for some of\nthe races. For example, Wisconsin had a Senate seat up in\n2012, but its primary elections for that seat were not held\nuntil August 14. Prior to the primary, there were several\nRepublican candidates (Thompson, Hovde, Neumann, and\nFitzgerald) in the running. Thus, early surveys presented to\nWisconsin voters had two levels. The first level asked\nrespondents which candidates they preferred within each\nparty (e.g., Thompson, Hovde, Neumann, or Fitzgerald for\nthe Republican primary), and the second level asked respon-\ndents who they would vote for in hypothetical matchups\nbetween the primary candidates from opposing parties. For\nexample, Wisconsin voters could be asked who they would\nvote for in a race involving Baldwin (the Democrat) and\nThompson, Baldwin and Hovde, Baldwin and Neumann, or\nBaldwin and Fitzgerald. Thus, before its primary, Wisconsin\nhad potentially four sets of polling data that could be used to\npredict which party would win the state, based on which\nRepublican candidate won the primary.\nSimilar issues occur with presidential polling, except that\ntypically one candidate emerges from each party as the inevi-\ntable winner long before the primaries are finished, and often\nbefore major polling gets underway. As such, foregoing pres-\nidential forecasting until a fairly clear consensus has devel-\noped on who the candidates will be does not sacrifice much.\nThe same does not hold for Senate races, however; in some\ncases no clear winner is present prior to the primary, and so\nit is necessary to wait until the actual votes come in before\nbeing certain which set of polling data should be used. This\nis not ideal, particularly because some states have fairly late\nprimaries (e.g., Wisconsin on August 14, Arizona on August\n28). To address this issue in 2012, the model of Rigdon et al.\n(2009) was adapted to use polling data from the candidates\nwho were currently leading (as determined by the Real Clear\nPolitics, 2012, weighted averages) in their respective prima-\nries at the time of the forecast. For example, if Hovde was the\n6 SAGE Open\nleading Republican candidate on a specific date, then the\nforecasting model would use polling data from a hypotheti-\ncal matchup between Baldwin and Hovde, whereas if\nThompson was leading, the Baldwin and Thompson polling\ndata would be used. For the 2012 elections, the only states\nwhere this issue arose were Wisconsin and Missouri.\nIn 2014, a more comprehensive solution to this problem\nwas used. Forecasts were constructed for each primary and\neach potential general election matchup based on the avail-\nable polls. Each general matchup's probability of occurring\nwas equal to the probability of both candidates in that\nmatchup winning their respective primaries. The probability\nof a candidate winning the seat was then computed as a\nweighted sum of the probability of winning each matchup in\nwhich that candidate participated. Similarly, the probability\nof a party winning the seat was computed by summing the\nprobabilities of all candidates in the party. A hypothetical\nexample with two Democratic candidates and two Republican\ncandidates is shown in Figure 2. Once the primaries were\nfinished, the extraneous matchups were dropped.\nSome states use a non-partisan blanket primary in which\nall candidates appear on the same primary ballot and the top\ntwo candidates, regardless of political party, advance to the\ngeneral election. Additional considerations need to be made\nwhen constructing forecasts for these races. For the 2012\nelection, both California and Washington had non-partisan\nblanket primaries. California's primary was on June 5, prior\nto the start of forecasting, with one Democrat (Feinstein)\nand one Republican (Emken) advancing to the general elec-\ntion. Washington's primary was on August 7, but the out-\ncome of the primary (Democrat Cantwell and Republican\nBaumgartner) was expected prior to that based on initial\npolling. Thus, the model did not need to be adjusted to\nIn 2014, a closely related issue was present in Louisiana,\nwhich uses a jungle primary system. Whereas the non-partisan\nblanket primary is typically held before the general elec-\ntion, Louisiana's jungle primary is held on the day of the\ngeneral election. If no candidate in the jungle primary\nreceives more than 50% of the vote, then a runoff race\nbetween the top two candidates is held on a later date. To\naccount for this possibility, the model of Rigdon et al.\n(2009) was adjusted to compute the probability of a runoff\nrace occurring as\nPr Pr\nPr\nRunoff No runoff\n( ) = - ( )\n= - \n- \n( )\n= - \n( )+ + - \n( )\n\n\n\n\n= -\n%\nPr Pr %\nPr\np +\n+ \n( )- - + \n( )\n- -\nw p p w p\nk k k k\n. Pr . .\nThis requires computing the probability that each candi-\ndate receives at least 50% of the vote, which can be done by\nintegrating over the appropriate region. Once this is com-\nputed, the probability of a candidate winning the seat is equal\nto the probability of that candidate winning the jungle pri-\nmary outright plus the probability of that candidate winning\nthe runoff, weighted by the probability of the runoff actually\noccurring. This computation does not take into account\nwhich pair of candidates will advance to the runoff, however.\nInstead, only the runoff race with the two leading candidates\nfrom the jungle primary was considered at the second stage.\nThis assumption was reasonable for 2014, as every race that\ncould lead to a runoff only featured two competitive\nDemocratic Primary\nRepublican Primary\nGeneral: Dem A vs. Rep A\nWeight :\nGeneral: Dem A vs. Rep B\nWeight :\nGeneral: Dem B vs. Rep A\nWeight :\nGeneral: Dem B vs. Rep B\nWeight :\nProbability of Candidate\nWinning the Senate Seat\nProbability of Party\nWinning the Senate Seat\nFigure 2. Hypothetical Senate race with unfinished primaries.\nRigdon et al. 7\ncandidates. A hypothetical example of this situation with one\nDemocratic candidate and three Republican candidates is\nshown in Figure 3. This same approach was applied to pri-\nmary runoff races, as well.\nThe Dynamic Programming Algorithm\nAfter determining the candidates' probabilities for winning\neach of the individual races, these probabilities can be com-\nbined to construct a comprehensive forecast. In the case of the\npresidential election, this consists of identifying the distribu-\ntion of electoral votes that each candidate receives, whereas\nin the case of the Senate and House, it consists of identifying\nthe distribution of seats secured by each of the major parties.\nKaplan and Barnett (2003) developed a dynamic program-\nming algorithm for finding the posterior distribution of elec-\ntoral votes for each presidential candidate conditioned on all\nof the polling data. The algorithm proceeds through all 50\nstates plus the District of Columbia, and at each stage it cal-\nculates the posterior distribution for the accumulated number\nof electoral votes for all states through the current stage. After\nthe last stage, this yields the exact posterior distribution of\nelectoral votes given the candidates' probabilities of winning\neach state. An adaptation of this algorithm for the Senate is\ndiscussed in the following sections.\nThe Senate algorithm. For the Senate, the goal is to determine\nhow many seats each party will secure given the candidates'\nprobabilities in each of the individual Senate races. The com-\nputations are completed in stages by considering each Senate\nrace one by one in alphabetical order. The first stage deter-\nmines the probabilities for each of the possible numbers of\nseats that the Democratic party (or Republican, or indepen-\ndents) could win when considering only the first race (in 2012,\nthis was Arizona). The only two possibilities are either zero\nseats or one seat--either the Democratic party wins the seat\nthat is up inArizona, or it doesn't. In the second stage, the first\ntwo states with Senate races are considered, after which the\nDemocratic party could win either zero, one, or two seats. This\nproceeds all the way through the last Senate race, at which\npoint the probability that the Democratic party wins any spe-\ncific number of seats when considering all races is obtained.\nTo formalize this, let qi denote the probability of the\nDemocratic party winning race i , and let D j k\n( , ) represent\nthe probability of the Democratic party winning exactly j\nseats from the first k races. The base case is\nD q D q D j j\n( , ) , ( , ) , ( , ) ,\n= - = = >\nfor\nand the recurrence is\nD j k\nj k\nD j k q j\nD j k q D j k\nk\nk\n( , )\n,\n( , )( ),\n( , )( ) ( ,\n=\n>\n- - =\n- - + -\nif\nif\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\nqk otherwise\nfor 0  j  N, 2  k  N, where N is the total number of\nSenate races.\nOnce the probabilities D j k\n( , ) have been obtained, they\ncan be used to determine a variety of useful quantities. For\nexample, to determine the probability that the Democratic\nparty holds exactly 51 Senate seats after the 2012 election,\nthe number of seats held prior to the election (in this case, 30)\nis first subtracted to yield the number of seats the Democrats\nneed to gain as a result of the election (in this case, 21).

This is done by using the fact that the number of elec-\ntoral votes received by Romney is 538 minus the number of\nelectoral votes received by Obama, because these two were\nthe only candidates with non-zero probabilities of winning\nany state. However, such a relationship does not hold in the\nSenate, or more generally, when there are more than two fac-\ntions competing for the units of interest (e.g., electoral votes\nor Senate seats). Thus, it is necessary to compute for each\nparty the probabilities of securing any number of Senate\nseats.\nThere is one additional complication with the Senate\nresults, namely, that independent candidates, if elected, gen-\nerally choose to caucus with one of the two major parties.\nThis can potentially affect the balance of power in the Senate.\nAnalyzing the possible effects of independents' caucus\nchoices can quickly become intractable even for a moderate\nnumber of candidates. Fortunately, for the 2012 elections\nthere were only two independents who had a non-zero prob-\nability of winning in their respective states, and both inde-\npendents were widely expected to caucus with the Democrats.\nBecause of this, the likely size of the Democratic caucus\ncould be determined by applying the dynamic programming\nalgorithm with the probability of winning each seat set to the\nprobability of the Democrat winning plus the probability of\nthe independent winning. This approach was used for all\nSenate ties.In a two-party system, a tie in the Senate can\noccur if both parties secure 50 seats. The probability of such\nan event is equal to the probability that one of the parties\nsecures exactly 50 seats, because the other party must then\nsecure the remaining 50 seats. However, when third-party\ncandidates must be taken into account, the situation becomes\nmore complicated. For example, a tie could occur with both\nmajor parties securing 50 seats, or with both major parties\nsecuring 49 seats and two seats going to independent candi-\ndates, or with both major parties securing 48 seats and four\nseats going to independent candidates, and so on. One way to\nsimplify this is to make assumptions regarding the parties\nwith which each third-party candidate will caucus, and then\ntreat those candidates as members of the appropriate party\nfor the purposes of determining seat totals and probabilities.\nAs mentioned previously, in the 2012 elections, both third-\nparty candidates who had a non-zero probability of winning\ntheir respective race were expected to caucus with the Demo-\ncrats, so this simplifying step could be applied when comput-\ning the probability of a 50\u00ad50 Senate seat split between the\ncoalition of Democrats and independents and the Republi-\ncans. Using this procedure in 2012, there was a significant\nprobability of a tie in the Senate (between .25 and .30) during\nthe summer (June 26 through September 16), but after Sep-\ntember 17 this probability dropped significantly and stayed\nbelow .04 after that. In 2014, the probability of a tie remained\nsignificant throughout the election, though it started to drop\nin mid-October and ended at .01 in the final election day\nforecast.\nAssumptions and Limitations\nThe primary assumptions made by the model of Rigdon et al.\n(2009) are reviewed here. The purpose of presenting these\nassumptions is to identify and highlight the model's strengths\nand limitations. These assumptions are as follows:\n1. The impact of race fundamentals is captured in poll-\ning data, and so these fundamentals are not explicitly\nincorporated into the model.\n2. Forecasts for races are made using only race-specific\npolling data. Infrequently polled races are assumed to\nbe those whose outcomes are unlikely to change.\n3. House effects from pollsters will tend to cancel out\nwhen averaging polls for each race and so adjust-\nments for these effects are not incorporated into the\nmodel.\n4. Polls are representative of the actual election turnout.\nAny possible biases, systematic errors, or other prob-\nlems within the polling data are not taken into\naccount.\n5. Outcomes across races are assumed to be indepen-\ndent, with no correlated error in the polls.\nIf any of these assumptions are incorrect, then the fore-\ncasts from the model will most likely be misleading or inac-\ncurate. Other forecasting models relax or remove some of\nthese assumptions by attempting to compensate for them,\nthough this adds complexity to the model and has the possi-\nbility of introducing additional noise into the forecasts\ntions can be found in the section \"Comparisons to Other\nForecasting Sites.\"\nAssumption 4 in particular implies that no uncertainty is\nadded to the forecasts to account for possible problems with\npolls. As such, forecasts tend to be overconfident in the out-\ncomes of individual races and consequently also in the\nnational outcomes. Interpreting each forecast as a snapshot\nRigdon et al. 9\nof the current state of the election puts the probabilities into\na better perspective, where they can be viewed as estimates\nof likely outcomes if the election were held on that day.\nAssumption 5 simplifies the process of translating race\nforecasts into national forecasts. For example, if Ei (Ei) is the\nevent that the Democrat wins (loses) race i , thenAssumption 5\nguarantees that Pr | Pr | Pr\ni j i j i\n( ) = ( )= ( ) for races\ni and j with i  j. This does not prohibit polls from other\nraces being used to estimate the probability of the Democrat\nwinning in a particular race, only that the actual outcomes of\nother races do not influence the outcome of that race.\nWhen Assumption 5 is valid, the dynamic programming\nalgorithm of Kaplan and Barnett (2003) computes the exact\ndistribution of electoral college votes whereas simulation\nmethods that use independent coin flips for each race approxi-\nmate this distribution. If this assumption is not made, then\nsome model of dependency between the races is necessary to\nestimate probabilities for national outcomes from the individ-\nual races. For example, if simulation is used to approximate\nthe distribution of electoral college votes for a candidate, then\nit would be necessary to know how to update the probability of\nthe candidate winning race i based on which of the preceding\nraces he or she had won in that particular iteration.\nOne reason why Assumption 5 might not hold would be\nthe presence of correlated errors within the polling data. For\nexample, polls across all races might overstate the actual\nlevel of support for one candidate, and thus if that candidate\nloses in one race, then it becomes more likely that he or she\nwill lose in the other races as well. However, Assumption 5\nis made not so much because it is believed to hold, but rather\nbecause incorporating dependency between the races seems\nmore likely to introduce noise in the forecasts if it is not\nmodeled correctly. The fact that Assumption 5 can be used to\nconsiderably simplify the calculations of national outcomes\nis an added benefit. Correlated error in the polls can be par-\ntially accounted for by the various swing scenarios, which\nshift the proportions of undecided voters uniformly across all\nraces. To update candidates'polled levels of support directly,\nthe forecasting model could be extended to include a random\nvariable that represents global bias across all polls. Simulated\ndraws from the distribution of this random variable could be\nused to update the polling data based on the sampled value,\nrecompute the candidates' probabilities of winning, and then\napply the dynamic programming algorithm to compute the\nexact distribution of electoral votes or Senate seats under that\nparticular realization of the random variable. Repeating this\nprocess many times and averaging the resulting electoral col-\nlege distributions would provide one way to potentially\naccount for the possibility of correlated error within the polls\nwithout having to explicitly model the dependency between\nstates. An approach such as this appears to have been used by\nSilver (2012), though without the dynamic programming\ncomponent. Relaxing Assumption 5 within the model of\nRigdon et al. (2009) is a direction for future research.\nElections\nous races were monitored through the Real Clear Politics\n(2012) website. As new polling data became available, it was\nused to update the probabilities of each presidential candi-\ndate securing a majority of electoral votes and each party\nsecuring a majority of seats in the Senate and House. All\nforecasts were made available online (Sauppe, Jacobson, &\nPresidential Forecasts\nIn 2012, the primary presidential candidates were Democrat\nBarack Obama, the incumbent running for his second term,\nand Republican Mitt Romney, the challenger. The priors for\nthis election were constructed using the 2008 presidential\nelection results.\nFigure 4 shows a time-series plot of the probabilities of\nObama winning, Romney winning, and a tie. A timeline of\nsome of the important events in the election campaign are\nshown across the top of the graph. The figure indicates that\nObama had a very high probability of winning at every point\nduring the election, though Romney had a few surges. The\ndetails of the state-by-state results (based on data published\non the morning of election day) are shown in Table A1 in the\nappendix. On the day of the election, the model correctly\npredicted the outcomes in 50 of the 51 states, missing only\nFlorida, which had the smallest margin of victory (.007) of\nall the states.\nFigure 5 shows a probability histogram of the posterior\ndistribution for the number of electoral votes for Obama on\nthe morning of November 6, 2012.

Nearly all of the probability lies on the numbers\ngreater than or equal to 270, making it virtually certain that\nObama would win.

The forecasting model correctly predicted\n35 of these races, missing only North Carolina (predicted\nDemocrat/Republican probabilities of winning were .959\nand .041, respectively, whereas the actual turnout was 47.3%\nDemocrat to 49.0% Republican). The races in Louisiana and\nGeorgia were both expected to be decided by runoff races,\nthough this occurred only in Louisiana; in both cases the\neventual winner was correctly identified. The Democrats\nwon 12 seats while the Republicans won 24, for post-elec-\ntion totals of 44 seats and 54 seats, respectively.\nEvery seat in the House was up for election in 2012. Prior to\nthe election, the Democrats had approximately 190 seats\nwhile the Republicans had approximately 240 seats. (These\ntotals fluctuated during the run-up to the election due to\nvacancies and the appointment of temporary replacements.)\nDue to political districting, most of these seats were consid-\nered safe for the party currently holding them.\nThere were several issues and limitations for the forecasts for\nthe 2012 House races. First, the construction of priors for the\nHouse races in 2012 was complicated by the redistricting that\noccurred after the 2010 census. Because the previous House\nelections in 2010 used potentially different districts than those in\n2012, it was not always clear how to use election results from\ndifficulty, all House priors were based on a combination of pun-\ndits'subjective ratings. Second, many House races were consid-\nered to have a clear winner prior to the election so no polls were\nElectoral Votes\nPosterior Probability\nObama wins VA\nRomney wins FL\nRomney wins VA\nRomney wins FL\nObama wins VA\nObama wins FL\nRomney wins VA\nObama Wins FL\nActual result of\nFigure 5.

Even for close races, polling data were\ntypically limited due to the difficulties associated with collect-\ning the data. These two factors meant that the House forecasts\ndepended heavily on the subjective priors.\nHouse forecasts were posted on the project website from\nOctober of 2012 through election day. On the day of the elec-\nraces, incorrectly predicted 14 races, and considered 13 races\ntoo close to call (50/50 split between candidates). The elec-\ntion day forecast predicted a Republican-controlled House\nwith the Democrats securing 193 seats and the Republicans\nsecuring 242, whereas the actual election led to 201 seats for\nthe Democrats and 234 seats for the Republicans.

For the presidential election, both 538 and PEC are\ngiven half a point for listing Florida as essentially a toss-up.\nTable 4 provides a list of Brier scores for the election day\nforecasts of various models computed across all races in the\nelection. The model of Rigdon et al. (2009) fared worst in the\npresidential election, due primarily to the poor prediction in\nFlorida. For the 2012 Senate election, it performed slightly\nbetter than the model of Silver (2012) by hedging more on\nMontana and North Dakota, but it lost to the model of Wang\n(2012), which correctly predicted both of those races. In\n2014, the model came in third out of seven, losing only to\ntainty in Kansas and a lower uncertainty in North Carolina.\nThese results demonstrate that the model of Rigdon et al.\n(2009) performed competitively with other models and was\nable to produce accurate forecasts in almost all races in 2012\nand 2014, missing only four states in the presidential and\nSenate elections. Thus, the assumptions discussed in section\n\"Assumptions and Limitations\" did not significantly affect\nthe quality of the final forecasts. One limitation of this analy-\nsis is that these comparisons are for the final election day\nforecasts, not forecasts made in the weeks before the elec-\ntion.

In addi-\ntion, constructing a metric for measuring the costs and\nincreased model complexity associated with mitigating the\nassumptions discussed in the \"Assumptions and Limitations\"\nsection will help in identifying whether or not potential\nimprovements should be made.\nConclusion\nThis article describes an extension of the Bayesian model of\nRigdon et al. (2009) that allows it to forecast which party\nwill control a majority of seats in each chamber of Congress.\nThe model uses race-specific polls to estimate the likelihood\nof each candidate winning each individual race in the elec-\ntion. These individual race outcomes are then aggregated to\nassign probabilities to national outcomes of interest such as\nthe seat totals for each political party in the U.S. Senate and\nHouse of Representatives.\nThe model was applied to the 2012 presidential and congres-\nsional elections and the 2014 Senate elections. Forecasts were\nupdated throughout the election cycle and made available\nonline. The 2012 presidential election was not close at any time,\nwith Obama's probability of winning exceeding .80 throughout\nmost of the presidential campaign. On the morning of election\nday, the probability that Obama would win the election was esti-\nmated to exceed .999. In contrast, the model indicated a close\n2012 Senate election until mid-September, at which point\nDemocratic control was expected with high probability up\nthrough election day. For 2014, the model indicated a close race\nthrough mid-September, after which the Republicans were\nincreasingly favored to take control of the Senate.\nAppendix\nTable 4.
