This study was designed to evaluate\nthe association of obesity with an early marker of kidney disease, albuminuria, among young adults.\nDesign, setting, participants, & measurements: Urinalysis (n  9371), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (n  4463), and body mass\nindex (kg/m2) were measured in the Add Health Wave III cohort (2001 to 2002), a multiethnic sample of young adults followed\nfor approximately 6 yr. Multivariate logistic regression modeled the association of sex-specific albuminuria with body mass\nindex, adjusted for sample weights, sex, race, ethnicity, and glycosuria.\nResults: Urinalysis revealed that 0.8% had proteinuria, 4.6% had hematuria, 0.2% had combined hematuria and proteinuria,\nand 1.5% had glycosuria. Albuminuria prevalence was 4.4%. Mean body mass index was higher among those with albuminuria\ncompared with those without. There were no associations between body mass index categories of 25 to <30 or 30 to <35 kg/m2\nwith albuminuria compared with the lowest body mass index (<25 kg/m2); however, the highest category (>35 kg/m2) was\nConclusions: Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, the association of albuminuria associated with obesity in young\nadults is particularly concerning. Obesity may be a target for primary prevention of kidney and cardiovascular disease.\nMore than 60% of adults who live in the United States\nare overweight (1). Overweight is associated with in-\ncreasing rates of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipi-\ndemia (2). This constellation of risk factors is also associated with\nend-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the prevalence of which has\nincreased despite the availability of interventions to control blood\nsugar and blood pressure (3). In the past several years, various\nstudies (4\u00ad8) have highlighted the importance of higher body\nmass as a risk factor for kidney impairment; however, few studies\nhave focused on renal consequences of obesity among young\nadults or in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nThe prevalence of early CKD has also increased in the past two\ndecades (9). Albuminuria is an early marker of CKD, as well as a\npredictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the general\npopulation (10\u00ad12), with well-documented correlates and conse-\nquences of albuminuria in older adults, including hypertension,\ndiabetes, and the metabolic syndrome (12,13). Because albumin-\nuria appears early in the natural history of kidney disease, it is a\npotential target of primary prevention (14).\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the hypothesis that\nbody mass index (BMI) and obesity were related to albuminuria in\nyoung adults who participated in the third wave of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health Wave III).\nA better understanding of this association in this age group will\nimprove our understanding of cause as well as guide prevention\nand intervention. This study also allowed assessment of urinalysis\nresults among a large population of young adults, which has not\nbeen well described in this age group.\nConcise Methods\nStudy Population\nA subsample of young adults who were aged 18 to 26 yr and\nparticipated in the Add Health study were evaluated for this study.

Briefly, 80 high schools, each paired with a feeder middle\nschool, were selected from all high schools with more than 30 students.\nWithin schools, students were stratified by grade and sex, then ran-\ndomly selected within stratum with approximately 200 selected from\neach school pair. Oversampling was conducted within select minority\ngroups. A total of 20,475 individuals were enrolled in Wave I. Wave III,\nspondents. Study procedures were approved by the institutional re-\nview board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nData and Specimen Collection and Definitions\nParticipants entered directly into a computer self-reported survey responses\non demographics, education, socioeconomic status, height, weight, medical\nconditions, exercise frequency, and smoking history. Field workers also mea-\nsured height and weight. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided\nby height in meters squared (kg/m2), using measured height and weight or\nself-reported values when not measured (n  136).\nParticipants provided a random (i.e., any time of day) first-stream 15-\nto 20-ml urine sample with the primary purpose for evaluation of\nsexually transmitted diseases in participants and their romantic part-\nners (16). Urine samples were stored at 4\u00b0C until shipped overnight\nwith ice packs in insulated containers. Automated urinalysis was per-\nformed using the Roche Chemstrip 10 UA urine dipsticks and a Roche\nUrisys 1800 System Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)\nwithin 72 h of collection. The remaining urine was stored at 70\u00b0C for\nmeasurement of albuminuria approximately 1 wk later.\nA total of 12,566 urine samples were available. Samples that were at\nroom temperature, improperly shipped, or insufficient were discarded\nation. Exclusions were applied later, when urine results were merged\nwith the full Add Health data set. Urine samples from romantic part-\nwomen were excluded, leaving 9371 samples for urinalysis evaluation.\nUrinalysis results were defined as positive for protein when 30\nmg/dl (0.30 g/L), red blood cells (RBC) when 25 erythrocytes per l,\nwhite blood cells (WBC) when 25 per L, and glycosuria when urine\nglucose was 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/L) (17). Two quality control urinal-\nyses were conducted each day samples were evaluated.\nUrine albumin and creatinine were measured by the Roche Cobas\nMira analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Albumin was\nquantified using the Roche Tina-quant Albumin reagent, an immuno-\nturbidimetric method for the in vitro measurement of human albumin\nin the urine, and measured spectrophotometrically. Albuminuria was\ndefined using sex-specific albumin-to-creatinine ratios of 17 mg/g in\nAlbuminuria was evaluated in a subset of respondents, chosen by\nBMI to maximize statistical power. Of the 10,868 adequate specimens\nfrom Wave I participants (romantic partners excluded), 2100 samples\n30, and 30 kg/m2. To limit false-positive albuminuria values, we also\napplied exclusions on the basis of the population-based Prevention of\nRenal and Vascular End Stage Disease (PREVEND) study (17,19) by\nexcluding pregnant (n  224) or menstruating (n  680) women and\nand 139 samples, 40 were in the same participant). Urinalysis-based\nexclusion criteria were applied to rule out albuminuria associated with\nurinary tract infections or non\u00adkidney-related hematuria; therefore,\nthey differ from definitions used to describe urinalysis findings, with\nthe exception of glycosuria. Upon applying exclusion criteria after\nurine results were merged with the full Add Health data set, 4463\nrespondents were included in the albuminuria analysis.\nThe obesity category was further divided into BMI from 30 to 35\nkg/m2 (class I obesity) and BMI of 35 kg/m2 (class II or greater\nobesity) (20). History of hypertension and diabetes was self-reported.\nBecause adult values for obesity are not applicable to adolescent BMI,\nage- and sex-specific percentiles of BMI based on 2000 Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention growth charts was used (21), then\npercentiles. Change in BMI from Wave I to Wave III was also evaluated.\nAdditional measures used in this study included education, health\ninsurance status (insured versus noninsured), having smoked at least\none cigarette within the past 30 d, and any or heavy exercise two or\nmore times in the week before the interview.\nStatistical Analyses\nDescriptive statistics included frequencies and percentages or means\nwith standard errors (SE) for demographic, health characteristics, and\nurinalysis results. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association\nof BMI categories with albuminuria. We also assessed associations of\nalbuminuria with race, sex, Wave I BMI, education, health insurance,\ndiabetes, glycosuria, hypertension, exercise, low birth weight, and smok-\ning. Variables that were associated with albuminuria in univariate analysis\nor that influenced the association between BMI and albuminuria by 20%\nwere retained in the final multivariate model. Multiplicative interactions of\nBMI with sex, race, and glycosuria were explored using logistic regression\nmodels. Interaction terms with P  0.15 (P interaction) led to evaluation of\nseparate models by interaction terms. Logistic regression results are ex-\npressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P\nvalues. All analyses were weighted for sample selection probabilities and\nnonresponse using SUDAAN 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC).\nResults\nThe Add Health respondents for whom urinalysis (n  9371)\nand albuminuria (n  4463) were evaluated for this study were\nsimilar to the overall Add Health Wave III respondents (n \n15,197) with respect to age, education, health insurance, diabe-\ntes, hypertension, and smoking (Table 1). Because of oversam-\npling of overweight individuals and exclusion of pregnant and\nmenstruating women, BMI and sex were significantly different\n(P  0.05) in the albuminuria assessment group compared with\nthe overall cohort. Race/ethnicity and exercise were also dif-\nferent between these two groups (P  0.05).\nElevations of urine protein, RBC, and WBC are depicted in\nFigure 1. The most common findings were WBC 25/l in\n(n  73). As shown in Figure 1, proteinuria in the absence of\nother urinary abnormalities was seen in 0.5%, with the other\n0.3% overlapping with hematuria, increased WBC, or both.\nGlycosuria was evident in 1.5% (n  142) of respondents.\nThe median measured albumin-to-creatinine ratio (n  4463)\nin 4.4% (n  194) of respondents. Among those with albumin-\nuria, dipstick proteinuria was positive (30 mg/dl) in 11.9%\n(n  23). With the exception of BMI, those with and without\nalbuminuria were not statistically different across many char-\nacteristics, although those with albuminuria had consistently\nhigher representation of black race, Hispanic ethnicity, hyper-\ntension, and glycosuria (Table 2). Mean BMI was significantly\nkg/m2; Table 2). There was a nonlinear association between\nBMI and albuminuria, with only the highest BMI category (35\nkg/m2) related to albuminuria compared with the reference\n0.04; (Table 3), controlling for sex, ethnicity, and glycosuria\n(Table 3). Consistent results were seen when adjusting for\nadditional covariates including education, hypertension, health\ninsurance, diabetes or both diabetes and glycosuria, exercise,\nand smoking.

Figure 2 shows the unadjusted\nprevalence of albuminuria by class II or greater obesity (35\nkg/m2) within race/ethnicity and sex subgroups. White and\nblack men showed much greater prevalence of albuminuria in\nthe class II or higher group compared with others. Separate\nmodels were evaluated within combined sex and race/ethnic-\nity categories, but CI were too wide to provide accurate esti-\nmates; however, the models suggested that the strongest asso-\nciations between albuminuria and the highest BMI category\nTable 1.

The association was particularly evident among both black\nand white men. This study also reveals a prevalence of elevated\nglycosuria that is considerably higher than in previous reports,\nwhereas other urinalysis results are within range of previous\nstudies, although there have been few estimates in young adults.\nOur findings are consistent with other reports that link\nhigher BMI with ESKD (7,8), CKD (4\u00ad6), and albuminuria\n(4,22\u00ad27). Two cohort studies have shown evidence of an asso-\nciation between higher BMI and development of ESKD (7,8),\nwith one study finding an association only in men (8), consis-\ntent with our findings. In another study, ESKD risk increased\nacross categories of obesity among participants who were fol-\nlowed for an average of 26 yr (7), with the strongest associa-\ntions among young adults (age 40). Several studies (4\u00ad6)\nhave also shown an association between higher BMI and risk\nfor CKD, defined by reduced estimated GFR.\nSimilar to our study, Verhave et al. (22) found an association\nbetween BMI and albuminuria in a Dutch population. Other stud-\nies (22\u00ad30) supported this association, but most relevant to this\nstudy, two US cohort studies evaluated the association of BMI and\nalbuminuria in younger adult populations: The Coronary Artery\nRisk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (24) and the\nBogalusa Heart Study (25). In the CARDIA study, subjects aged 18\nto 30 yr were enrolled; albuminuria was measured at 10 and 15 yr\nand found in 6.3 and 6.7% of participants, respectively. A U-\nshaped relation was observed between quartiles of BMI measured\nat year 10 and albumin excretion, independent of BP and fasting\nglucose. The Bogalusa study enrolled subjects aged 5 to 17 yr and\nfound a 4.7% prevalence of albuminuria at 16 yr of follow-up.\nChildhood BMI was not associated with adult albuminuria,\nwhereas the relationship of adult BMI and albuminuria was not\nreported. One limitation of these two cohort studies is that partic-\ndramatic increase in obesity in the US population that our study\ncaptures.\nIn this study, change in BMI over 6 yr but not baseline BMI\nwas associated with albuminuria at follow-up, suggesting that\ngrowth in body mass may occur faster than the kidneys can\nadapt. Only one other study evaluated the relationship of\nchange in BMI with kidney function using data from the Phy-\nsicians Health Study, which is not directly comparable because\nof the older age of their cohort and use of a GFR-based measure\nof CKD (31). Nevertheless, our results are consistent with\ntheirs, because they found that an increase in BMI 10% over\n14 yr was associated with a 27% increased risk for CKD. Other\nstudies were cross-sectional or evaluated a single measurement\nObesity-related glomerulopathy has been well described,\nwith damage to the kidney suspected through a combination of\nhyperfiltration, high protein and salt intake, hypertension, hy-\nperinsulinemia, and increased tubuloglomerular feedback as a\nresult of increased sodium reabsorption, dyslipidemia, inflam-\nmation, and elevated leptin levels (33\u00ad35). A frequent compli-\ncation of obesity-associated glomerulopathy is secondary FSGS\n(34). Renal biopsy diagnosis of obesity-related glomerulopathy,\nwhich often manifests clinically as albuminuria, has increased\n10-fold in 15 yr, with a trend for more frequent diagnosis\namong men than women (1.6:1) compared with primary FSGS\nof an association of high BMI and albuminuria in men suggests\nthat there may be an absolute body size, not just a proportional\nmass, that stresses the capacity of the kidney.\nUrinalysis estimates from our study are important because\nfew studies have reported these findings among young adults\nadults (40\u00ad43). The 4.6% prevalence of hematuria in our study\nis generally higher than reports of 0.5 to 4.1% in pediatric and\nadults (mean age 21.8 yr) who were screened in the United\nKingdom (44) yet similar to adult prevalence reports (42,43).\nFigure 1. Urinalysis results of proteinuria and hematuria, with\nelevated white blood cells (WBC) also shown because their\npresence could lead to a false-positive evaluation of protein\nexcretion. Hematuria (red blood cells [RBC] 25/l) was found\nProteinuria may have been falsely elevated as a result of the\npresence of WBC in 0.13%, meaning that approximately 0.6%\nhad elevated proteinuria, with 0.1% having both proteinuria\nand hematuria.\nProteinuria (30 mg/dl) in the absence of leukocyturia and\nhematuria among 0.5% in our study is consistent with pediatric\nand adolescent studies (37\u00ad39), as well as with adult studies\n(42,43). Our finding of dipstick proteinuria (30 mg/dl) in just\n11.9% of those with albuminuria highlights the danger of rely-\ning solely on dipstick measures, which, unlike albumin-to-\ncreatinine ratio, do not take urine concentration into account.\nGlycosuria among 1.5% in this study, considerably higher than\nin other studies (43,44), is likely related to the high frequency of\noverweight and obesity that is, in turn, associated with more\nfrequent and often undiagnosed diabetes.\nThis study has several strengths. We used a sample drawn from\nthe general US population of young adults. The large sample size\nof 4000 young adults, although not the full Add Health cohort,\nhad sufficient statistical power to study the relationship between\nalbuminuria and obesity, with statistical differences in class II or\ngreater obesity (35 kg/m2) detected between those with and\nwithout albuminuria. However, it should be noted that sample\nweighting adjustments specifically based on urinalysis exclusion\ncriteria were not used in the analysis, so caution should be used in\nmaking inferences to the general US population of young adults.\nAnother strength is that the Add Health study population is\ncomposed of an understudied young adult population, with a\nmean age of 21.7 yr. This group represents the ideal target for\nprimary prevention of CKD. Our study also included Hispanic\nindividuals, another understudied population in which advanced\nkidney disease is becoming more prevalent (45,46). Disparities\nfaced by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States may take\ndecades to develop, which could explain the lack of association\nbetween race/ethnicity and albuminuria (47). Nevertheless, the\nassociation between high BMI and albuminuria was highest\namong black men.\nThere are several limitations to our study. Definitive kidney\ndisease cannot be assessed using a single urine specimen,\nwhich may be subject to random variation and transient pro-\nteinuria from prolonged standing or exercise (48); however,\nTable 2.

Urine was collected at any\ntime during the day, whereas first-morning midstream urine\nmay be preferred for albuminuria assessment and urinalysis\n(19,42). Urinary measures were evaluated only at the Wave III\nstudy visit, precluding assessment of incident cases of albumin-\nuria. This study also lacked many clinical attributes, such as\nmeasured blood pressure, serum creatinine, and medication\nuse; however, self-reported hypertension and diabetes were\navailable, and measured glycosuria may indicate undiagnosed\nor undertreated diabetes. Two studies in adult populations\n(mean ages of approximately 50) suggested that obesity as a\nrisk factor for albuminuria and CKD may be confounded by\nlarger waist circumference (49) and that waist-to-hip ratio may\nprovide additional information on risk (50). Unfortunately, these\nmeasurements were not available for this study. Also, changes in\nBMI for people who cross from adolescence into young adulthood\nare difficult to assess because different standards are used for\nthese ages; however, a recent study (51) suggested that among\nadolescents, change in actual BMI works better than change in\nstandardized BMI z score for longitudinal studies.\nDespite these limitations, this study represents a large sample of\nyoung adults in the United States, and the finding of albuminuria\nassociated with obesity is particularly concerning. Primary pre-\nventive strategies are needed to stem rising rates of CKD, and\nobesity is a potential target. If there is in fact a causal link between\nobesity and kidney disease, then rising obesity prevalence por-\ntends a continuing rise in kidney disease rates in the United States.\nThe guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney\nDisease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommend screen-\ning for albuminuria among people who are at risk for kidney\ndisease, including those with established diabetes or hyperten-\nsion, other systemic illnesses, family history of kidney disease, and\nage 60 yr (10). Obesity may be a novel candidate screening\ncriterion. A prospective study of the relationship between obesity\nand early markers of kidney damage in young adults is warranted.\n"
