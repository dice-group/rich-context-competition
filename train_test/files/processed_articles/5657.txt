This was the period when the three\nMinistry of Education (MOE) \"Strategic Objectives,\"\nnamely, improving access to and participation in basic edu-\ncation, improving the quality of teaching and learning, and\nimproving the management efficiency of the education sec-\ntor, were formulated to inform and facilitate the implementa-\ntion of the various education sector policies in the country.\nThis period, essentially, was characterized by Ghana's par-\nticipation in and endorsement of international and multilat-\neral agreements and conventions such as the United Nations\n(UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the\nWorld Declaration on Education for All (EFA) Conference,\nthe Beijing Declaration on Women's Rights, the Lome\nConvention, and World Education Forum (or what is com-\nmonly referred to as the Dakar Framework for Action or the\nMillennium Development Goals Conference).\nGhana's endorsement of the agreements and declarations\nof these international meetings, coupled with commitments\nto her own internal constitutional reforms, for example, led\nto major constitutional and educational reforms of which the\nFree Compulsory Universal Basic Education (fCUBE) pol-\nicy was a formidable part (Nudzor, 2012). The Fourth\nRepublican Constitution of 1992 and the policy acts that\nfollowed it set the stage for the national provision of basic\ntion formulated the policy titled \"Basic Education--A Right:\nProgramme for the provision of Free Compulsory and\nUniversal Basic Education by the year 2005,\" which was\nlaunched officially by MOE in 1996 (Government of Ghana\nA year after (that is, in 1997), a fourth objective, decen-\ntralization and sustainability of management structures, was\nadded to the three strategic objectives formulated to guide\nthe execution of the fCUBE policy implementation and gen-\nerally education policy formulation and implementation in\nthe country. The objective of the decentralization component\nof fCUBE includes decentralizing the management of the\neducation sector's budget for pre-tertiary education to\nDistrict Assemblies (DAs). This involves capacity building\nand financial management at the district level (GES, 2004).\nThus, historically speaking, although attempts to decentral-\nize the general administration of Ghana dated back to the era\n1University of Cape Coast, Ghana\nCorresponding Author:\nHope Pius Nudzor, Institute for Educational Planning and Administration\n(IEPA), University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana.\nEmail: hpnudzor@gmail.com\nAn Analytical Review of Education Policy-\nMaking and Implementation Processes\nWithin the Context of \"Decentralized\nSystem of Administration\" in Ghana\nHope Pius Nudzor1\n Keywords\npolicy making, decentralization, policy implementation, rationalist approach to policy making, Ghanaian education system\n2 SAGE Open\nof the introduction of indirect rule by the British colonial\nregime (Ayee, 2000), the strategy of education decentraliza-\ntion as the fourth strategic objective of fCUBE was aimed\nspecifically at shifting responsibility of education decision\nmaking into the hands of local education authorities. To do\nthis, the strategy sought to devolve central administrative\nauthority and divest implementation responsibility to the dis-\ntrict level. As Maikish and Gershberg, citing the National\nDecentralisation Action Plan (NDAP) (GOG, 2003), rightly\nnote, the policy of decentralization in Ghana (which receives\nthe necessary legal impetus from Chapter 20, Article 240 of\nLocal Government Act [GOG, 2003]; as well as from several\nother subsequent policy acts) aimed to establish a decentral-\nized administration through the transfer of power from the\ncentral government to sub-national institutions such as DAs\n\"to enhance the capacity of the public sector to plan, manage\nand monitor social, spatial and economic development\"\n1993 Local Government Act; and several other subsequent\nlegal frameworks) that brought to being the strategic objec-\ntive of decentralization are still in force, and some reason-\nable amount of efforts are perceived to have been made and\nare still being made to decentralize education policy making\nto the local and/or district levels. Unfortunately however, a\ncritical assessment of education policy and practice in Ghana\ngenerally suggests in rather stark terms that despite the initia-\ntion and adoption of the strategic objective of decentraliza-\ntion, education policy making and implementation is still\nperceived as adopting a hierarchical structure with its inher-\nent practice of concentration of power at the center. Policy is\nstill largely formulated at the national level by political fig-\nureheads and technocrats and \"pushed down\" for implemen-\ntation at the local level through regional and district\nrepresentatives of the Ghanaian education authority. While\nthis \"top-down\" rationalist approach to the policy process\narguably has its own merits, the practice does raise a number\nof interesting questions worth examining. For example, the\nquestion does arise as to how the concept of educational\ndecentralization can take hold when policy making remains\nthe preserve of political figureheads and technocrats at the\ntop echelons of the policy process? Conversely, the question\nalso comes to mind as to how or the extent to which this\nrationalist approach ensures the avoidance of adoption of the\nstraitjacket of external accountability which favors imposi-\ntion of change from the \"center.\"\nThis article seeks to respond, although indirectly, to these\nand other concerns and challenges that confront the Ghanaian\neducation system as a result of the adoption of the rationalist\napproach to policy making. In particular, the article analyzes\ncritically the practice of education policy making and imple-\nmentation within the context of \"decentralized system of\nadministration\" in Ghana. This is done with the view to\nilluminating the potential theoretical and practical challenges\nand limitations that this \"top-down\" approach to the policy\nimposes on the functioning of the education system. In pur-\nsuit of this goal, the article presents proposals for democra-\ntizing and decentralizing the processes of policy making and\nimplementation. Essentially, the article argues that Ghana's\ninterest and focus on strengthening central government con-\ntrol at the local levels rather than the focus on devolution has\nencouraged education policy making and implementation to\nassume the managerial \"top-down\" posture, causing educa-\ntional decentralization structures and institutions and their\nlocal governance counterparts to operate as dual hierarchical\nand parallel structures. Consequently, and as the article con-\ntends, education policy has come to be conceptualized and\nreduced to simplistic routines of decision making rather than\na complex undertaking involving contestations, struggles,\nand negotiations between and among the various actors of\npolicy.\nThe article is organized as follows. The next section sets\nthe article in context by describing crisply some underlying\ndrivers and concepts of decentralization vis-\u00e0-vis a brief his-\ntory of the initiation of the policy of decentralization in\nGhana. This is followed by detailed description of education\npolicy-making and implementation processes in the Ghanaian\ncontext. Thereafter, the theoretical and practical challenges\nand limitations imposed on the Ghanaian education system\nby the top-down and rationalist approach to policy making\nare presented. Then, proposals for democratizing education\npolicy processes are highlighted before the summary and\nconclusion.\nDecentralization: Underlying Drivers\nand Concepts\nThe preponderance of available evidence from empirical\nstudies and literature on public administration suggests that\ndecentralization entails and/or could be defined generally as\nany act in which a central government formally cedes its\npower and authority to sub-national and diversified levels of\nwords, decentralization as a concept concerns the transfer of\nauthority in public planning, management, and decision\nmaking from national and/or central levels to sub-national\nlevels (Rondinelli cited by Egbenya, 2010) with the view to\nachieving positive outcomes in both democratic and devel-\nA remarkable empirical evidence from the various studies\neconomic, political, administrative, and conflict resolution\narguments for decentralization. For example, while in some\ncountries (particularly central and eastern Europe and Latin\nAmerica) the drive for decentralization came from demands\nfrom local levels as a reaction against the failures of the cen-\ntralized state, in some other parts of the world, decentraliza-\ntion of the state has been a response to actual or potential\nregional conflict (e.g., Indonesia) and/or as a way of recon-\nstructing states afflicted by conflict arising from ethnic\ndiversity (e.g., Uganda, South Africa, Iraq). However, in\nreality, the process in most countries (especially countries in\nsub-Saharan Africa) has generally been driven by local and\nnational political elites, by certain political realities at the\ncenter, and by \"external pressures,\" rather than by local-level\ndemocratic demand (Devas, 2005, p. 3). Thus raising further\nthe critical issue about whether or not governance institu-\ntions at the local levels have the capacity to offer the prospect\nof increased accountability to citizens through the greater\naccessibility of decision making.\nThree main types of decentralization, namely, administra-\ntive decentralization or deconcentration, fiscal decentraliza-\ntion, and political/democratic decentralization or devolution,\nare also discernible from a critical review of the literature\nRibot, 2001). Administrative decentralization or deconcen-\ntration, as illustrated in the literature, involves the relocation\nof branches of the central state to local areas, entailing a\ntransfer of power to locally based officials who remain part\nof, and upwardly accountable to, central government minis-\ntries and agencies. Fiscal decentralization, however, entails\nthe transfer of fiscal resources and revenue-generating pow-\ners, inclusive of authority over budgets and financial deci-\nsions, to either deconcentrated officials and/or central\ngovernment appointees or to elected politicians. The third\ntype of decentralization (i.e., political/democratic decentral-\nization or devolution), according to the public administration\nliterature, is concerned essentially with the transfer of pow-\ners and resources to sub-national authorities who are largely\nor wholly independent of the central government and are\ndemocratically elected (Manor, 1995, cited by Crawford,\nWhile these remain the commonly identifiable types of\ndecentralization in the literature, it is worth noting for the\npurposes of this article that two competing concepts of\ndecentralization appear to be operating in the Ghanaian con-\ntext currently (Gariba, 2009). The first is the devolution of\nmajor political and administrative responsibilities from cen-\ntral Government to DAs, comprising the establishment of\npartially elected bodies with the mandate for local govern-\nment and local community development. The second, run-\nning parallel to the concept of devolution, entails the process\nof administrative and technical deconcentration practiced by\nMinistries, Departments, and Agencies that plan and deliver\nspecific services (such as water and sanitation, health, educa-\ntion, agriculture, roads, works) and other allied municipal\nservices. Devolution, as set out under the former illustration,\nhas far reaching implications for political, administrative,\nand technical setup, proposing to restructure institutions and\nmandates for service delivery. Deconcentration as illustrated\nin the latter case has involved the simpler re-arrangement of\nthe locations of key personnel and where their functions are\ndelivered, while retaining the loyalties, promotion incen-\ntives, and the \"chain of command\" of the centralized agen-\ncies (Gariba, 2009, p. 6). This second entrenched concept\nand/or process of deconcentration depicts, to a large extent,\nGhana's interest and attempt at decentralization all along and\nis aimed at strengthening central government control at the\nDecentralization in Ghana: A Brief\nHistorical Account\nThe history of decentralization in Ghana dates back from the\nintroduction of indirect rule by the British colonial authori-\npost-independence eras to the current democratic and \"Fourth\nRepublican\" dispensation. During the period of colonialism,\nthe British administration ruled indigenes indirectly through\nthe native political chieftaincy system. They (i.e., the British\ncolonial authorities) set up a native political institution\nwhereby chiefs and elders in given districts were constituted\nas local authorities with powers \"to establish treasuries,\nappoint staff and perform local government functions\"\nsystem of administration, according to Crawford (2004), the\ndemocratic ideals underlying chieftaincy in Ghana, which\nmade chiefs accountable to their subjects was replaced by\nupward accountability to the colonial \"master.\" This was\nbecause, and as Nkrumah (2000) for example, notes, \"the\nrecognition by the central government was more crucial to\nthe chief than support of his people\" (p. 5).\nIn the periods after this (i.e., the period immediately\nbefore, during, and after Ghana's independence in 1957),\nlocal government generally was weak and subject to the cen-\ntralization of power that was typical of most post-colonial\nstates inAfrica. Several attempts at decentralizing the admin-\nistration of the country, for example, the decentralization\nreforms introduced in 1974 under the military regime of Lt.\nCol. Acheampong, were generally characterized by decon-\ncentration and aimed at strengthening central government\ncontrol at the local level. A historical aspect during these\neras, nonetheless, was the decentralization reforms intro-\nduced in the early period of Rawlings's military regime (i.e.,\nDefence Council (PNDC) government announced a policy of\nadministrative decentralization of central government minis-\ntries, alongside the creation of People's Defence Committees\n(PDCs) in each town and village. The PDCs, made up of\nlocal PNDC activists as self-identified defenders of the \"rev-\nolution,\" effectively took over local government responsi-\nbilities,thoughoftenlimitedtomobilizingtheimplementation\nof local self-help projects (Nkrumah, cited in Crawford,\n2004, p. 7), while the deconcentrated ministries played a\nmore significant role. While this policy reform was\n4 SAGE Open\nremarkable in terms of its \"politico-historical antecedents,\"\nest in decentralization reflected that of previous regimes. He\nargues that its interest was not the devolution of political\nauthority to the local level but rather in the administrative\ndecentralization of central government.\nThe most significant push toward decentralization in\npost-independence Ghana however occurred in 1988 when\nthe PNDC government introduced a major piece of legisla-\ntive reform, \"the Local Government Law 207\" (also known\nas PNDC Law 207). The introduction of this Law saw the\ncreation of 110 designated administrative districts (ADs)\nwithin Ghana's 10 regions, with non-partisan DA elections\naddition to the two thirds of DA members elected on an indi-\nvidual, non-partisan basis, one third was appointed by cen-\ntral government, along with a chief executive for each\ndistrict. The stated aim of the 1988 Local Government Law\n(according to Map Consult Ltd, 2002), was \"to promote pop-\nular participation and ownership of the machinery of govern-\nment . . . by devolving power, competence and resource/\nmeans to the district level\" (p. 35). According to Crawford\n(2004, p. 8), the language of \"participation\" and \"owner-\nship,\" interestingly anticipated the \"donor speak\" of the\n1990s (particularly World Bank), although it had some reso-\nnance also with the revolutionary rhetoric of \"popular par-\nticipation\" of the earlier PNDC period.\nThe 1988 decentralization reform was endorsed by\nGhana's Fourth Republican Constitution of 1992 which\nmarked the transition to multiparty democracy at the national\nlevel. The 1992 Constitution consolidated the aim of decen-\ntralization within the overall context of a liberal democratic\nconstitution. The objective of decentralization as laid out\nand 2 of the 1992 Constitution states emphatically that\nLocal government and administration . . . shall . . . be\ndecentralised. . . . The functions, powers, responsibilities and\nresources should be transferred from Central Government to\nlocal government units. . . . Measures should be taken [by\nParliament] to enhance the capacity of local government\nauthorities to plan, initiate, co-ordinate, manage and execute\npolicies in respect of matters affecting local people. (GOG,\nThe principles of local government participation and\ndownward accountability to the populace are inferred in the\nTo ensure the accountability of local government authorities,\npeople in particular local government areas shall, as far as\npracticable, be afforded the opportunity to participate effectively\nCurrently, these constitutional provisions regarding\ndecentralization are further deepened under President\nJohn Mahama's National Democratic Congress (NDC)\nGovernment through the adherence to the three-tier sub-\nnational structure created by the 1992 Constitution. This\nthree-tier sub-national structure comprises Regional\nCo-ordinating Councils (RCCs), ADs (or what is known in\ngeneral terms as DAs), and Sub-District Structures. Each of\nthe 10 regions has a RCC, chaired by a regional minister,\nappointed by the president. The RCC is composed of the\nregional minister and his or her deputy, the presiding mem-\nber and District Chief Executive (DCE) from each district,\ntwo chiefs from the Regional House of Chiefs, and regional\nheads of decentralized ministries in the region who sit as\nnonvoting members. The RCC's main functions are to co-\nordinate and regulate the DAs in their respective regions.\nThe DAs, as per the 1992 Constitution, the Local Government\nAct, and other previous policy acts/laws, are responsible for\nthe overall development of districts and are, among other\nthings, permitted to exercise deliberative, legislative, and\nexecutive functions. Currently, the number of DAs/ADs has\nAssemblies, 55 Municipal Assemblies, and 155 DAs. The\nthird-tier (i.e., sub-district structures) of the sub-national\nstructure, consist of Urban, Zonal and Town/Area Councils,\nand Unit Committees, who are essentially implementing\nagencies of DAs and are what Ayee (2000) describes as \"ral-\nlying point of local enthusiasm in support of the develop-\nment objectives of DAs\" (p. 17).\nIn all, the objective of decentralization, along with the key\npowers and responsibilities enshrined in sub-national gov-\nernment structures, as can be seen above, is clearly estab-\nlished in and/or by the Fourth Republican Constitution of\n1992. Yet, certain essential democratic elements of decen-\ntralization appear to remain compromised. As this article,\nusing the education system as case in point, will later show,\nsub-national educational institutions and structures in Ghana\nlack the necessary wherewithal to enact their own policies\nowing mainly to the hierarchical structure of the education\nsystem. This state of affairs does not enable the educational\nsystem to engage effectively with local governance institu-\ntions. Ayee (2000), for example, endorses this argument\nforcefully. He contends that a key feature of local gover-\nnance in Ghana is the adoption of a dual hierarchical struc-\nture in which central government institutions and local\ncounterparts (including education) \"operate in parallel\" (p.\n49), but with encroachment many at times by better-resourced\ncentral government on the roles and responsibilities of under-\nresourced local government.\nEducation Policy Making in Ghana: The\nNarrative\nEducation policy making in the Ghanaian context adopts the\ntraditional rationalist model whereby policy formulation pro-\ngresses through phases, namely, conception, consultation,\ndevelopment, implementation, and evaluation stages\n(Working Group on Education Sector Analysis, 2000).1 The\nprocess begins with perceived or felt need for changes in the\neducation provision and delivery systems. Such changes are\nnecessitated by and/or for various reasons such as the find-\nings of research on ineffectiveness and/or failure of a partic-\nular education policy or the recognition that a particular\neducational reform program is no longer appropriate or has\noutlived its usefulness. Similarly, policy-making initiatives\nare also prompted by the concern to fulfill earlier promises\nmade, especially by politicians, seeking the votes of the elec-\ntorates, or in some cases, the need to supplement, strengthen,\nor address weaknesses in existing policies to improve\nconditions.\nIn the Ghanaian context, the practice at the conception\nstage of the policy-making process is to respond to demands\nfor change by first setting up a national committee or com-\nmission, with membership from a wide range of stakeholder\norganizations, to review the situation warranting change\n(Working Group on Education Sector Analysis, 2000). The\nreview at this stage is expected to draw heavily on the analy-\nsis of the experiences gained in the implementation of exist-\ning policies that are the focus or targets of the proposed\nchange. The main concern of the review at this stage is not\nonly to find out why targets of existing policies are not being\nachieved and whether implementation has gone on as\nplanned. The task here, equally importantly, involves exam-\nining what unintended outcomes or unforeseen obstacles\nhave emerged during the process of implementing existing\npolicies which are the target of change, and what alternative\nmeasures can be adopted to address existing challenges. A\ngood example to illustrate policy formulation at the concep-\ntion stage (and typically how demands for educational\nchange are responded to in Ghana) is the setting up of the\nmandate to review Ghana's policies on basic education. The\nactivities of this Committee culminated in the initiation and\nimplementation of fCUBE policy and/or program in 1996.\nThe consultation stage of education policy-making pro-\ncess in Ghana solicits views for the purpose of review by\ngovernment. An essential part of the task here involves con-\nsidering which options are available or are still open to the\nsector while taking into account the past experiences and the\nextent to which the sector has drifted off course. Generally, at\nthis stage, all-round stakeholder conferences or meetings are\nconvened to which individuals of the various constituent\nbodies as well as representatives of the development partners\nare invited to discuss the options proposed by the review\ncommittee for consideration. The review committee then re-\nconvenes to put together the various proposals discussed and\nadopted at the round-table conferences. Thereafter, the out-\ncomes of this exercise are submitted to the MOE in the form\nof policy recommendations for considerations. Humes\n(1999) contends that a relatively open process of consulta-\ntion canvasses views widely and sets few limits to the issues\nthat are set up for debate while a relatively closed consulta-\ntion restricts both those who qualify as legitimate respon-\ndents and what they are invited to comment on. While this\nholds true for the activities at the consultation stage of the\npolicy-making process in the Ghanaian context, it is impor-\ntant to stress that whether an open or closed process is\nadopted, it is the prerogative of government, and in most\ncases, the minister in-charge of the education portfolio, to\neither revise or not to revise the policy recommendations in\nthe light of the responses and/or feedbacks received.\nSimilarly, it is instructive to add that for reasons of political\nexpediency, the extent of revision of the policy recommenda-\ntion by government at the consultation stage depends on the\ndegree of political will behind the policy initiative.\nAt the development stage, the policy-making process is\nmoved beyond the broad enunciation of principles to the\nclarification of aims, detailed planning, pre-testing of materi-\nals, or alternative plans among others. Most often, new poli-\nciesarepilot-testedbeforewholesalenationalimplementation.\nA case in point is the piloting of the Junior Secondary School\n(JSS) initiative (which was an offshoot of the 1987 education\nreform program) in 1981 before a nationwide implementa-\ntion in the 1990s. The important management implications\ninvolved at the development stage of the policy-making pro-\ncess include the remit given to individuals and groups, and\nparticularly the role of key institutions such as the GES\nCouncil, the Curriculum Research Development Division\n(CRDD), the National Inspectorate Board (NIB), the Ghana\nNational Association of Teachers (GNAT), the National\nTeaching Council (NTC), and many others. In the Ghanaian\ncontext, the development stage of the policy formulation\nprocess also has as its integral part, the submission of policy\nrecommendations in the forms of bills to parliament for\napproval after which the policy is then ready for\nimplementation.\nOnce the policy decision has been taken and the policy\nrecommendations are approved and/or passed by parliament,\nthe policy then moves to the implementation stage. The long-\nstanding practice in Ghana, backed by acts which established\ntively, is for pre-tertiary education policy to be implemented\nby the GES for and/or on behalf of the MOE. However, a\nrecent complimentary practice is to set up a unit to monitor\nthe implementation process and carry out periodic impact\nmonitoring assessments. Granted that this is where the policy\nis rolled out, activities at this stage call for decisions on phas-\ning, timing, the production of explanatory documents and\nstrategies to aid the process of implementation, as well as the\nprovision of in-service training programs and courses for the\n\"actual\" implementers of the policy.\nThe final stage of evaluation is where the success or fail-\nure of the \"new\" policy is assessed, and this is normally sep-\narated in time from the other four stages. Normally, sector\nanalysis is conducted virtually at all the stages of policy for-\nmulation but is emphasized particularly at the policy analy-\nsis, pilot testing, and impact monitoring phases. Generally,\nthe practice in Ghana has been to choose persons who have\nbeen involved with the policy formulation processes as\n6 SAGE Open\nevaluators. However, this, over the years, has been fraught\nwith issues relating to \"insider biases\" and \"blinded objectiv-\nity.\" That is, the evaluators, more often, tend to be favorably\ndisposed toward finding success rather than failure of policy\nformulation processes. For this reason, the practice nowa-\ndays is to call on independent and \"objective minded\" indi-\nviduals and agencies to serve as evaluators of the processes\nof policy formulation.\nEducation Policy Implementation in\nGhana: A Descriptive Account\nAlthough represented as the fourth stage of the policy-\nmaking process, the act of implementing education policy\nconstitutes a discrete process conceptualized as a hierarchi-\ncal structure involving four main levels, namely, governmen-\ntal, regional, district, and school levels.\nPolicy implementation at the governmental level in the\nGhanaian context is controlled by the MOE. The MOE has\noverall responsibility for education sector policy formula-\ntion, planning, monitoring, evaluation, budgeting, and co-\nordination. The MOE is headed by a minister who is\nresponsible for all educational issues and reports directly to\nthe president of the Republic. The tertiary sector manage-\nment of education falls into the hands of the Governing\nCouncil of the tertiary institutions and is co-ordinated by the\nNational Council for Tertiary Education (NCTE). The pre-\ntertiary-level management of education is managed by the\nGES, which is the legally mandated body for implementing\nall educational policies at the pre-tertiary level. The GES is\nheaded by a director-general who carries out his or her func-\ntions of implementation and advice through the regional\ndirectors of education, the general managers of mission/\nfaith-based schools, the regional managers of mission/faith-\nbased schools, the district directors of education, headteach-\ners and teachers of both public and private schools in the\ncountry.\nTwo other bodies, namely, CRDD and NIB (formerly\nInspectorate Division), play an invaluable role in the imple-\nmentation process. These are supposed to be independent\nbodies created and its members appointed by government,\nfor the purposes of quality improvement and control in pre-\ntertiary education (Quasi Autonomous Non-Governmental\nOrganisations [QUANGOS]), and are intended to be account-\nable solely to government. Interestingly, however, the CRDD\ntoday is still under the GES and is headed by a divisional\ndirector accountable to the director-general of GES. The\nCRDD is responsible for curriculum development, evalua-\ntion, innovation, and implementation whereas the NIB is\nresponsible generally for supervision and inspection of\nschools to ensure educational standards at the pre-tertiary\nlevel. The functions of the NIB thus augment the endeavors\nof the CRDD. Apart from the CRDD and NIB, there are\nother national agencies whose activities and functions also\naugment the endeavors of the GES. These agencies include\nthe NTC, GNAT, the West African Examinations Council\n(WAEC), the National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI),\nand the National Council for Vocational Education and\nTraining (NACVET). The job of the NTC includes the\naccreditation of teacher training institutions and the accredi-\ntation of individuals who pass out of teacher training col-\nleges. GNAT is the official and exclusive bargaining agent\nrepresenting teachers in pre-tertiary educational institutions\nin matters relating to employment working conditions.\nWAEC is a regional examining body of Anglophone West\nAfrican States, which conducts all types of academic exami-\nnations for students in the sub-region. The NVTI and\nNACVET are involved in the development, assessment,\ntraining, and certification of pre-tertiary technical and voca-\ntional subjects.\nThe implementation of educational policy in each of the\n10 regions in Ghana is carried out at the regional directorates\nof education. Each directorate is headed by a regional direc-\ntor who is accountable to the director-general of GES. The\nregional director is responsible for all educational matters in\nthe region, and therefore liaises with the district directors and\nregional managers of the various religious educational units\nin the region for the implementation of all educational poli-\ncies introduced and/or emanating from central government.\nThe regional director of education is also responsible, among\nother things, for providing the necessary support and making\navailable funds, educational resources, and materials from\ncentral government to all the districts under his or her\njurisdiction.\nAt the district level, the implementation of education pol-\nicy is done by the district directorate of education which is\ncommonly known as the District Education Office (DEO).\nThe DEO is headed by the district director of education\n(DDE) who takes charge of all educational matters and is\nthus responsible for the implementation of education policies\nand programs of GES within and throughout the district. The\nDDE is accountable ultimately to director-general of GES\nthrough the regional director of education for his or her\nregion. The DDE's responsibilities include, but are not lim-\nited to, the following: supervision and monitoring of schools\nwithin the district; dissemination of education-related infor-\nmation to headteachers, teachers, and educational institu-\ntions (both public and private) under his or her jurisdiction;\norganizing training programs for teachers and headteachers;\nprovision of educational resources (including furniture,\nbooks, and infrastructural facilities); management of the cap-\nitation grant scheme; resolution of conflicts between schools\nand communities; organizing school/community participa-\ntion programs; and setting up in schools school/community\norganizations and district-level support systems such as the\nparent teacher associations (PTAs), school management\ncommittees (SMCs), district education oversight committees\n(DEOCs), and district teacher support teams (DTSTs).\nThe activities of the DEOs are, in principle, supported and\ncomplemented actively by the DAs. The DAs are statutory\nbodies created by law for the primary purpose of decentral-\nizing government business at the local or district level. They\nare charged with the development of school infrastructure\nand the mobilization of local communities to support and be\nactively involved in the provision and delivery of pre-tertiary\neducation at the local levels. The DAs, thus, have statutory\nduty for providing communities under their jurisdiction with\neducation in accordance with national policy guidelines laid\ndown by central government.\nThe \"actual\" implementation of educational policies for-\nmulated at the national level and recommended for action is\ncarried out at the school level (GOG, 2001). Two very impor-\ntant groups of actors, headteachers and teachers, undertake\nthis task. The headteachers, for example, are the chief execu-\ntives or administrators of schools, and are the key imple-\nmenters of change that central government has at its disposal.\nThey are responsible for running of schools, and as such, the\nsuccess and/or failure of change initiatives in schools, to\nsome considerable extent, rest on their shoulders. The\nresponsibilities of headteachers within the resources avail-\nable include, but are not restricted to, conducting affairs of\nschools (through the pursuance of achievable and measur-\nable objectives) to the benefit of all pupils, their parents, and\nthe communities they serve; implementing policies set by the\neducation authority under the overall direction and guidance\nof DDE; the general day-to-day administration and manage-\nment of schools; and determining the job descriptions of\nother members of teaching staff (GOG, 2001).\nThe teachers or class teachers as they are commonly\ncalled in Ghana, however, have responsibility for the man-\nagement of teaching and learning of their classes. They are\nresponsible for meeting the educational as well as other\nrelated needs of the pupils they teach, which they must con-\nduct in tandem with national or central government policy.\nThe class teachers, therefore, are seen or regarded in the\nGhanaian context as the \"actual\" implementers of policy,\nparticularly those intended to impact pupils learning out-\ncomes positively. Apart from their teaching roles, they are\nalso required to liaise with parents, guardians, and communi-\nties to reflect the local circumstances, needs, and aspirations\nof the children they teach.\nIn summary, the above exposition describes how educa-\ntional policy formulated at the national level in Ghana is\nimplemented and the various bodies involved in the pro-\ncess. Granted, however (and as noted earlier), that educa-\ntion policy in the Ghanaian context is expected to be\nformulated and implemented within a decentralized system\nof administration, raises some pertinent questions which\nbeg asking. One of these critical questions worth asking is\nwhether or not this top-down and rationalist approach to\neducation policy process imposes any restrictions, chal-\nlenges, or limitations on education policy-making pro-\ncesses and indeed the functioning of the educational system\nin general. This and other related issues are addressed in the\nfollowing section.\nPicking Strawberries From the Jam\nIn this section, a few of the theoretical and practical chal-\nlenges and limitations imposed by the top-down and ratio-\nnalist approach on the processes of education policy making\nin the Ghanaian context are highlighted and elaborated on.\nThe rationale essentially is that this could provide some use-\nful information to facilitate and inform national education\npolicy dialogue to improve the Ghanaian education system.\nOne of the theoretical shortfalls of the rationalist approach\nto education policy making and implementation adopted in\nGhana relates to its reduction of the policy process to sim-\nplistic routines of decision making. The examples in this\narticle show that a group of authorized decision makers\nassemble at particular times and places, review a problem,\nconsider a number of alternative courses of action with more\nor less explicit calculation of the advantages and disadvan-\ntages of each opinion, weigh the alternatives against their\ngoals or preferences, and then select an alternative that seems\nwell suited for achieving their purposes. As proponents of\nthe \"policy cycle\" tradition to the study of policy (Ball, 1994;\nwould have us believe, the processes of policy making go\nbeyond this simplistic traditional approach to decision\nmaking. For them, policy is a complex process involving\ncontestations, struggles, negotiations, and dialogues between\nthe different actors of policy within and outside the policy-\nmaking machinery. According to the adherents of the process\nconception of policy, the contested and negotiated nature of\nthe policy process, for example, is evident at both the policy\n\"encoding\" and \"decoding\" phases, which are also referred\nto in policy terms as policy as both text and discourse. The\nencoding phase of policy formulation denotes the initial\nstage of formal policy making where the ideas, values, and\naspirations of both the key actors involved in the policy pro-\ncess and the people and/or interests they represent are elic-\nited and enlisted via struggles, compromises, authoritative\npublic interpretations, and reinterpretations. The decoding\nphase, however, is marked by the disputed and complex\nways by which the policy messages and outcomes are inter-\npreted by actors and implementers in the contexts of their\nown culture, ideology, history, resources, and expertise. For\nthis reason therefore, conceptualizing education policy pro-\ncesses in quite straightforward terms into phases, as the\nGhanaian case shows, tends to ignore the wider structural,\nsocio-cultural, and political dimensions of policy by over-\nsimplifying or reducing the processes to operational plans\nand routines which need following to achieve desired out-\nFollowing on from the above, the top-down, and rational-\nist approach to policy adopted within the perceived decen-\ntralized system in Ghana could also be criticized theoretically\nfor reinforcing implicitly the prevailing traditional view of\n8 SAGE Open\npolicy as a problem-solving tool. As per the expositions in\nthis article (particularly the conception and consultation\nstages of the policy-making process), the rationalist approach\nto policy adopted in Ghana appears to reiterate the assump-\ntion that experts trained in proper analytical techniques can\napply their expertise to the political marketplace, discover\nand measure the impact of policy on citizen interests, project\npolicy consequences with some accuracy, and affect the deci-\nsions of identifiable clients, who will use policy and its anal-\nyses to solve problems. Trowler and Knight (2002) capture\nthis erroneous impression forcefully when they write that\n[T]he technical-rational approach to policymaking invigorated\nin/by the change management perspective assumes that if\nsufficient energy can be elicited from those involved by\nenthusiastic leaders with clear vision of change then large scale\ntransformations can be accomplished relatively quickly and\nTheoretically, and in policy terms, not only is this assump-\ntion overly deterministic but represents a change manage-\nment perspective driven by the \"stages\" view in which the\nfinal stage of policy making is a timely recommendation to a\nclient or a timely intervention to solve pressing problems.\nThis, consequently places huge limitations on our under-\nstanding of policy processes. This is particularly because the\n\"client orientation\" invigorated implicitly in this rationalist\napproach endorses the prevailing view of policy making as\nrelatively orderly in which analysis and implementation are\nseen as advice to clients, and their usefulness is assessed as\nits contribution to eventual decisions or actions by policy\nmakers and/or reformers, rather than as contributions to\nbroader cultural, socio-economic, and political discourses\nIn practical terms, the hierarchical approach to policy\nmaking adopted in the Ghanaian education system has, in\nmany instances, led to the allied agencies responsible for\nplaying key roles in education sector policy decisions operat-\ning in parallel to national and sub-national institutions and\nstructures of decentralization. A case in point worth citing to\nillustrate this issue concerns the activities of GES. As per the\nrules that established it as the sole agency for implementing\npre-tertiary education policy in 1974, the GES was/is man-\ndated to, among other things, liaise and/or engage with other\nnational and sub-national institutions of decentralization in\nproviding and delivering education at/to the local levels.\nDishearteningly however, the hierarchical nature of the edu-\ncation system and its inherent concentration of power at the\ncenter appear not to have enabled the GES to be able to per-\nform this onerous role effectively. Consequently, to be able\nto perform its mandated role, the GES has had, in many\ninstances, to arrogate to itself decision-making powers con-\ntrary to its subordinate position within the MOE. The effect\nof this is that, sometimes, some top management staff and\nfield officials of GES made pronouncements bordering on\npolicy without the prior knowledge of the MOE and the min-\nister of education. This particular issue led to the abolishing\nfunctions and powers were vested in the PNDC Secretary for\nEducation (Working Group on Education Sector Analysis,\n2000). However, since the re-establishment of the GES\nCouncil in 1996, the situation has improved considerably\nand there is now a greater institutional participation of GES\nin education policy-making processes.\nConversely, the top-down and rationalist approach to\npolicy formulation and implementation discussed in this\narticle has more often resulted in what is perceived as the\nduplication of function among the various agencies respon-\nsible for policy implementation at the grassroots level in\nGhana. A good illustration here relates to the tensions and\nunnecessary conflicts between some District Education\nDirectorates and DAs. As per the policy implementation\nstructure presented earlier in this article, policy implementa-\ntion at the district or local levels falls directly under the\nambit of DEOs. The DEOs are headed by the DDOs who are\nresponsible, among other things, for the supervision and\nmonitoring of schools within the district, training of person-\nnel of the education service, provision of educational\nresources (including furniture, books, and infrastructural\nfacilities), management of the capitation grant scheme, and\nsetting up in schools school/community organizations and\ndistrict-level support systems. Ironically, however, (and\nowing largely to the adoption of the decentralization initia-\ntive), DAs have also been mandated by law as both direct\nrepresentatives of government and agencies of development\nto engage in some aspects of education provision and deliv-\nery mainly through the development of school infrastruc-\nture. Clearly, what some people see as a duplication and/or\ncontradiction in the functions of both the DEO and DAs\nhave been noted, and measures such as making DDEs auto-\nmatic members of District Education Select Committees\nhave been put in place to cure any mischief that may arise.\nHowever, the sad news in Ghana is that owing to reasons of\npolitical expediency and/or perhaps lack of education, fre-\nquent tensions and conflicts rear their ugly heads between\nDEOs and DAs regarding their core mandates, thus throw-\ning the entire education provision and delivery agenda vis-\n\u00e0-vis the concept of decentralization off gear.\nDemocratizing Policy Processes:\nProposals for Change\nHaving unearthed the effects of the hierarchical approach to\npolicy making and implementation on the education system\nin Ghana in the previous section, this part of the article\nmoves now into a brief discussion of proposals for change in\nterms of how education policy processes could be democra-\ntized and decentralized to benefit the Ghanaian education\nsystem.\nThe first proposal, as far as this article is concerned,\nrelates to the urgent need and action to be taken to \"de-\npoliticalized\" education policy initiation, or to discourage\nwhat for the purposes of this article is referred to as the impo-\nsition of policy from the \"center.\" In this context, \"de-politi-\ncalization of policy\" is not a suggestion that the processes of\npolicy making and implementation should necessarily be\ndevoid of politics. Rather, what this is intended to de-empha-\nsize is the petty partisan politics currently being practiced in\nGhana to the extent that political parties (ruling governments\nmost especially) are able to hijack educational policies and\npractices for purposes of political expediency. A good exam-\nple in support of this suggestion concerns the provision of\npre-tertiary education in Ghana and matters arising from its\nstructure and duration. Until the third quarter of the 1980s,\nGhana operated a 17-year (6 years primary, 4 years middle, 5\nyears secondary, and 2 years sixth form) pre-tertiary educa-\ntion system. However, in 1987, President Jerry John\nRawlings's military regime introduced a new system of edu-\ncation mooted earlier in 1974. This new system reduced the\nlength of pre-tertiary education from 17 to 12 years (i.e., 6\nyears primary, 3 years junior secondary, and 3 years senior\nsecondary education) owing to the perceived weakness that\nthe 17 years had a telling effect on national budget because it\nwas too long (MOE, 1987). Upon assumption of government\nin 2000, President JohnAgyekum Kufour's National Patriotic\nParty (NPP), under the pretext that too many subjects were\ntaught and were poorly handled in Ghanaian basic schools,\nalso changed the name, structure, and duration of pre-tertiary\neducation to 15 years. This new system comprised 2 years\npre-school, 6 years primary, 3 years junior high school (JHS),\nand 4 years senior high school (SHS; MOE, 2005). As if\nthese changes were not enough, the late President John Atta\nMills\u00adled NDC government, which took over the mantle of\ngovernance from the NPP in 2008, subtracted 1 year from the\nSHS component of the existing structure under the pretext of\nlack of infrastructural facilities, equipment, and logistics.\nThus, the duration of the existing pre-tertiary education\nstructure in Ghana was reduced from 15 to 14 years. While it\nneeds to be acknowledged that change in policy direction is\none of the ways by which successive governments get to\noperationalize their ideological beliefs, programs, and poli-\ncies, the point being made here forcefully is to ensure that\neducational processes and policies are not opened up to the\nwhims and caprices of unscrupulous and self-seeking politi-\ncal parties and leaders who, for purposes of gaining political\ncurrency, may cause long-term and lasting injuries to the\neducational system. One strategy to achieve what I call \"a\nde-politicalized education policy making\" is to ensure that\nthere is in place a national development policy, plan, or\nframework from which educational policies of the country\nwould emanate and whose goals educational policies are\ngeared toward achieving. Quite apart from providing a\nnational policy framework against which all successive gov-\nernment would lean, this will also ensure consistency and\nalacrity in the provision of good quality education to all\nGhanaian citizens.\nFollowing up closely on the first proposal is the advice for\ngovernment and its allied agencies of education to embark\nupon devolution of power to formulate and implement edu-\ncation policy to local or district levels. Undoubtedly, some\narrangement to this effect could be said to be in place already\nin Ghana under the policy of decentralization. However, the\npoint of emphasis here is that this does not appear to be tak-\ning hold in practice because of the problems associated with\nthe policy-making regime in place currently. Therefore, what\nthis article is calling for is not necessarily re-inventing the\nwheel of decentralization, but a more concerted and sus-\ntained efforts aimed at rejuvenating the processes and struc-\ntures of decentralization. One of the practical ways of\nachieving this objective is by adopting the local education\nauthority (LEA) system or strategy practiced in countries\nsuch as the United Kingdom. The LEA strategy of decentral-\nization ensures that local actors of policy are empowered and\npositioned to take strategic decisions regarding the planning,\nadministration, management, and leadership of schools in\ntheir local jurisdictions.\nAn equally important way of democratizing and decen-\ntralizing education policy processes in Ghana is through the\nencouragement and support of bottom-up approaches to pol-\nicy making. As has been indicated already in this article,\nsome structures or agencies of decentralization (such as DAs,\nDEOs, DEOCs, DTSTs, PTAs, SMCs) are already opera-\ntional in the Ghanaian educational setup. For example, under\nthe current policy of decentralizing educational administra-\ntion, the Education Management Information System (EMIS)\nis being positioned as a resource to construct operational\nplans and develop budgets at the district levels to ensure that\neducation provision becomes more efficient and responsive\nto local needs. Essentially, under this process, the MOE is\nstill required to retain overall responsibility for teacher train-\ning, curriculum development, and monitoring policy at the\nnational level. However, the districts, unlike before, are to\ntake responsibility for their own policies, operational plans,\nand budgets based on accurate and up-to-date information\nobtained from EMIS as opposed to their needs being deter-\nmined by the MOE and GES.As a step toward democratizing\nand decentralizing education policy formulation and imple-\nmentation, this article advocates for the actualization of\narrangements such as this one. This, in the view of the article,\nwill empower and enable local-level actors of policy to gen-\nerate policy at their levels which will then feed into the\nnational development agenda and hence bring about the\nneeded changes and improvements in the education system\nand in the lives of the Ghanaian citizenry.\nSummary and Conclusion\nThis article is built on the premise that traditional hierarchi-\ncal approaches to policy processes do not support and/or\nencourage devolution of power from the center to local-level\nactors of policy. Using the Ghanaian education context as an\nexemplar, the article analyzes critically the practice of educa-\ntion policy making and implementation within the context of\ndecentralized system of administration. This is done to\nunearth the challenges and limitations that the adoption of\nthe rationalist approach to policy places on policy processes\nand indeed, the functioning of the educational system.\nEssentially, the article finds that some reasonable amount\nof decentralization efforts was and is still being made, and\nsome education decentralization structures (e.g., DAs,\nDEOs, DEOCs, DSTSs, PTAs, and SMCs) are also in place\nto devolve power to local levels to ensure that decision mak-\ning in education becomes more efficient and responsive to\nlocal needs. However, the article argues, although implicitly,\nthat Ghana's interest and focus on strengthening central gov-\nernment control at the local levels (rather than on devolution)\nhave had a \"knock-on\" effect on policy processes to the\nextent that education policy making and implementation is\nseen to have assumed the traditional and managerial \"top-\ndown\" posture. This consequently, and as the article con-\ntends, has caused the educational decentralization structures\nand institutions and their local governance counterparts to\noperate as dual hierarchical and parallel structures.\nWithin the context of unearthing the theoretical and prac-\ntical effects this rationalist approach to policy has on the\nGhanaian educational system, the article makes three key\nproposals for change in terms of how education system could\nbe democratized and decentralized to benefit the Ghanaian\ncitizenry. The proposals puts forth include de-politicalizing\neducation policy making, devolving and deconcentrating\npower to formulate and implement education policy from\ncentral government to local or district levels, and support for\nbottom-up approaches to policy making.\nSo, while this article concerns itself mainly with educa-\ntion policy processes in the Ghanaian context, the discus-\nsions reverberate strongly the criticism against centralized\nsystems of education administration and policy making in\nthe sense that these systems do not support decentralization.\nRather, they tend to adhere to the straitjacket of external\naccountability models which favors imposition of change\nfrom the \"center.\"\n"
