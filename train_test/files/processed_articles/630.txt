Gabel\nAt a time when the nation's leading\nnewspapers are proclaiming that\nhealth care costs are rising again, this\nreview of trends in health care costs tells a\ndifferent story. The media report that insurers\nare raising premiums to restore their profit\nmargins and that underlying costs are rising\nas a result of growing use of expensive phar-\nmaceuticals and diminished abilities of health\nplans to obtain discounts from providers.1 Al-\nthough there is truth to these observations,\nthe most recent systematic data on cost\ntrends--1998 private insurance premiums,\npayrolls in health services establishments--\nshow only a small upswing in the rate of in-\ncrease of costs. Perhaps a more substantial in-\ncrease is just around the corner, but recall that\nin early 1997 the media were trumpeting that\nhealth care costs were rising.2 The data de-\nscribed in this paper show that their predic-\ntions have not come to pass.\nWe begin with a discussion of trends in\nthe rate of growth of health care costs, which\nare proxied by data on providers' revenues\nand on payrolls in health services estab-\nlishments. We then turn to premiums for\nemployment-based health insurance. Finally,\nto gauge the impact of these trends on con-\nsumers, we look at employees' share of health\ninsurance premiums and their out-of-pocket\nspending for medical services and prescrip-\ntion drugs.\nSPENDING\nData on revenues reported by health care\nproviders show that the rate of increase in\nhealth care expenditures rose modestly in\nMilliman and Robertson Health Cost Index\nshows that after adjustment for general infla-\ntion, revenues per capita increased 1.8 percent\nThis rate of increase is less than the rate of\ngrowth in real per capita gross domestic prod-\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on\npayroll costs in health services establishments\nprovide another vantage point on expenses in-\ncurred by health care providers.4 Although\npayroll is only one component of provider\ncosts, it is an important one, and these data\nare available with the shortest lag. Real pay-\ncrease is comparable with that of provider\nrevenues. In nominal terms, payroll data for\nthe first five months of 1998 are similar to\nRates of growth in both provider revenues\nand payrolls have declined sharply in the\nthough growth rates have increased since\nthen, the increases have been modest, well be-\n\u00a91998 ThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nPaul Ginsburg is president of the Center for Studying Health System Change in Washington, D.C.

For example, in 1997 ex-\npenditures increased 11.5 percent, while the\ndrug component of the Consumer Price Index\n(CPI) increased only 2.5 percent.7 The trends\nin revenues for hospitals and physicians are\nsimilar to each other, but one should note that\nhospital revenues consist of a decrease in reve-\nnues for inpatient services (from declining\nrates of admissions and lengths-of-stay) and a\nrelatively high rate of increase for outpatient\nservices (not shown).\nAmong the components of payroll costs,\naccounted for entirely by more hours worked\n(Exhibit 3). The increase in the average hourly\nwage--3.2 percent--was the same as that for\n1996. In contrast, increases in average hourly\nwages in all industries rose to 3.8 percent.

They show roughly un-\nchanged rates of growth for hours but an in-\ncrease in the rate of growth of wages in health\nservices establishments--roughly in line with\nthe increase for workers in all industries.\nIn sharp contrast to anecdotes in the media,\npremiums for employment-based health in-\nsurance actually increased only 3.3 percent in\nincreases in the 5\u00ad7 percent range. Although\npercent increase in 1997, it continues to be\nbelow the rate of growth of hourly earnings\n(Exhibit 3). The premium increase was rela-\ntively uniform among health plan types,\nranging from 2.9 percent for both health\nmaintenance organizations (HMOs) and\npoint-of-service (POS) plans to 3.8 percent for\npreferred provider organizations (PPOs).\nSome analysts have questioned whether\nlow premium increases could reflect changes\nin plan mix or reduced benefits, but neither\nexplanation appears to be correct. The KPMG\nPeat Marwick data that we use here are based\non responses to a question on the premium\nchange from the previous year for the most\npopular plan of each type. So if one type of\nplan had a higher level of premium than an-\nother type, changes in mix would not affect\nthe data used here to describe trends. The\nKPMG survey indicates that deductibles for\nconventional and in-network PPO and POS\nservices today are lower than they were in\ndecline in the overall level of covered benefits\nExhibit 4 combines data on premium\ntrends with data on provider revenue for the\nnon-Medicare population. From 1992 through\n1994 premium increases exceeded underlying\ncost increases by a substantial margin, and\nhealth plans were very profitable. However,\nmium increases lagged behind expenditure\nincreases, and profit margins in health plans\nfell considerably. For 1998 analysts have been\nexpecting that premium trends will be above\ntrends in provider revenues.10 However, the\nKPMG estimate of premium increases re-\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment, Hours, and Earnings database.\na Product of second and third columns.\nb Product of number of production workers (excludes executives and managers) and average hours per week, adjusted for\nchanges in U.S. population.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 8\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The 1998 increase in premi-\nums is no higher than the 1997 rate of increase\nin the corresponding Milliman and Robertson\nindex.\nThis pattern traces an underwriting cycle.\nWhen insurance is profitable, firms keep pre-\nmiums low to enter new markets and expand\nmarket share in existing markets. However,\nthese activities tend to be cut back when prof-\nits are down.\nConsumers appear to be receiving substantial\nbenefits from the low rates of growth in costs.\nThis was not the case a few years ago, when at\nthe same time that growth rates of premiums\nfor employment-based insurance were drop-\nping rapidly, the proportion of the premium\npaid by employees was rising (Exhibit 5).\nThis trend appears to have reversed (or at\nemployee contributions to coverage have\ngrown more slowly than premiums. Indeed,\nwhen we combine the data in Exhibits 4 and\n5, we find that employee contributions have\nbeen declining over the past three years. A\ndelayed reaction to the slowdown in premium\ngrowth and tightening labor markets may\nhave been factors in ending the trend of re-\nquiring employees to contribute a higher pro-\nportion of the premium.\nConsumers also have had very good news\non their out-of-pocket spending for medical\ncare. For example, data from the U.S. Depart-\nment of Labor's Consumer Expenditure Sur-\nvey show that out-of-pocket spending for\ndrugs increased only 11 percent--compared\nwith a 56 percent increase in drug expendi-\ntures per capita (Exhibit 2). Similar declines\nin the proportion of medical services financed\nthrough consumer out-of-pocket payments\nare reflected in the Health Care Financing\nAdministration's (HCFA's) National Health\nThese low trends in out-of-pocket spend-\ning may be attributable to the rapid shifts\nfrom conventional coverage to managed care.\nSwitching to an HMO reduces consumers'\nout-of-pocket responsibility from a deduct-\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 7 , N u m b e r 5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For those\nswitching to PPO or POS products, similar\nsavings are available to the extent that pa-\ntients use network providers. However, some\nof consumers' financial gains are accompanied\nby restrictions in choice and other constraints\nof managed care.\nCONCLUSION\nWhen Health System Change began this an-\nnual synthesis of data on cost trends two\nyears ago, our major challenge was to demon-\nstrate to readers that the decline in the rate of\nincrease in costs was broad and sustained.\nMany were skeptical that data they had seen\nreflected only the employer share of premiums\nor that it reflected only the routine underwrit-\ning cycle in insurance and not the costs expe-\nrienced by insurers. Now that the trends are\nbetter understood, many want to look beyond\nWhen looking to the future, we must dis-\ntinguish between trends in premiums and\ntrends in the costs that underlie insurance.\nMuch of the media discussion has focused on\npremiums. In the short run, low profit mar-\ngins for insurers will affect the rate of growth\nof premiums as insurers become less aggres-\nsive in keeping prices low to expand market\nshare. Consequently, premium increases\ncould well be higher in 1999, about two years\nafter originally predicted by the media. But\nover a slightly longer period, the dominant in-\nfluence on premiums is underlying costs. An\nacceleration of costs could be brought on by\nthe rapid introduction of new drugs and other\nnew technologies and by the increasing diffi-\nculty that health plans have in obtaining\nprovider discounts. However, the expansion\nof information on effectiveness, growing use\nof secondary prevention, continuing excess\ncapacity among health care providers, and\ncontinued aggressiveness on the part of pur-\nchasers will work to hold costs down.\nThe authors acknowledge the superb research assis-\ntance of Peter Swanjlung, access to data provided by\nJay Thayakaran of Milliman and Robertson, and the\nfinancial support of the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-\ndation.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 8\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

HCFA's National Health Accounts obtain a two-\nway matrix of data from both providers and in-\nsurers. These data are generally recognized as\nthe \"gold standard\" for studying cost trends and\nare used extensively by researchers and policy\nanalysts. Readers of Health Affairs are familiar\nwith these data from the regularly published\nwork of Katharine Levit and colleagues at the\nHCFA Office of the Actuary.\nThe Milliman and Robertson Health Cost In-\ndex (HCI) is obtained from various surveys of\nproviders, some widely known and some pro-\nprietary. It is designed to serve as a leading indi-\ncator of private health insurers' claims experi-\nence. Thus, it is limited to health services that\ntend to be insured: inpatient and outpatient hos-\npital services, physician services, and prescrip-\ntion drugs. Because provider revenue data tend\nto cover all patients, the HCI analysts subtract\ndata on Medicare reimbursements. Revenues for\nMedicaid and uninsured patients are not re-\nmoved. The HCI contains more current data\nthan the National Health Accounts. Because the\nHCI is designed to track the experience of a pri-\nvate policy with a $250 deductible, but we are\ninterested in tracking total expenditures, we\nhave obtained data adjusted to reflect a $0 de-\nductible and expanded it to include Medicare\nspending.\nFor 1996 and ealier years, some of the esti-\nmates from the National Health Accounts and\nthe Milliman and Robertson index have been re-\nvised from those published in previous syntheses\non health care cost trends. These series are rou-\ntinely revised as more complete data become\navailable. The implication for users of the series\nis that estimates for the most recent years are\nsubject to more error than are those for earlier\nyears. This is a price we willingly pay for more\ntimely tracking of trends.\n4. These data include all nonsupervisory workers\nin health services establishments. Nonsalaried\nhealth professionals are not included.\n5. We use nominal rates of growth because the\nGDP price index is not yet available for the sec-\nond quarter.\n6. Note that these data and the data presented in\nthe remainder of the paper are in nominal terms\n(not adjusted for inflation).\nprices have reflected sharp increases in drug\nprices. If this proves to be more than an aberra-\ntion, it would portend an acceleration in growth\nof spending for drugs.\n8. See, for example, Findlay, \"Study: Health Costs\nHeld in Check.\"\n(Montvale, N.J.: KPMG Peat Marwick, 1998),\n10. \"Wall Street Comes to Washington: Analysts'\nPerspectives on Health System Change,\" Confer-\nence sponsored by the Center for Studying\nHealth System Change, Washington, D.C., 3\n11. The Consumer Expenditure Survey asks a sam-\nple of approximately 5,000 households about\ntheir spending by category of goods and services\nover the past quarter. For health services, there\nare separate questions for health insurance pre-\nmiums, medical services, drugs, and medical sup-\nplies. The results that we report for medical serv-\nices refer to the second category only and do not\ninclude insurance premiums. These questions\nhave not changed over the period reported, so\ncomparisons over time are expected to be valid.\n12. K.R.
