    "abstract": "Abstract\nGrounded theory is well supported as a qualitative research method that historically responded to the epistemological\nchallenges of defining knowledge and determining how it has been acquired. While its historical and unique methodological\nunderpinnings remain consistent, its ongoing application and methods of execution continue to expand its use. The\nconsideration of using grounded theory by researchers embodies the need to explore the methodology and thereafter seek\nto develop the method that reflects the researcher's skills, the research setting, and the research aims. This article sets out\na particular method of applying it to the study of change management using a rich single case study in the nonprofit sector.\nKey findings are that nonprofit specific change management models may need to incorporate a focus on formal reflection\nfor change agents and change recipients, development of trust and confidence in the organization prior to the actual change,\nfocusing on the individual experience of change, and recognizing the sequencing of events from a planning perspective.\n",

On one hand, it\nseeks to uncover what reality may be, while on the other\nhand determines how that reality has been arrived at. This\ndual process provides opportunity for the application, as well\nas the adaption, of various methods. These enable interpreta-\ntion of wide-ranging data and information, sourced from\nmultiple perspectives, and assessed through multiple meth-\nods to be applied, enabling researchers to understand mean-\ning in the context of life setting scenarios. A key outcome of\nsuch research is to understand the what, the why, and the how\nwithin research settings, and to apply this to the broader\nresearch agenda of both extant and emerging theory.\nGrounded theory represents a key qualitative research\nmethod. It identifies a range of essential elements that,\nwhen combined, offer a consolidated framework within\nwhich wide-ranging data are gathered, assessed, and subse-\nquently used in developing theory, based on what has been\nobserved. These essential elements include the coding and\ncategorization of data, concurrent data collection and anal-\nysis, the writing of memos, theoretical sampling, constant\ncomparative analysis using inductive and abductive logic,\nthe application of theoretical sensitivity, the development\nof intermediate coding practices and routines, the selection\nof core categories from the data, and the application of\ntheoretical saturation.\nApplying grounded theory in the manner identified in\nthis article results in the hypothesis that change manage-\nment in the nonprofit sector may necessitate the inclusion\nof four key considerations that should be built into planned\norganizational change programs. In the context of a single\ncase study approach, these include that reflection for both\nthe change agent and the change recipient should be\naccounted for, that preexisting confidence and trust levels\nin management are a necessary element, that a balanced\nfocus on both the individual and the organization must be\nevident, and the sequencing of specified events before,\nduring, and after the change, impact change outcomes\n(Rosenbaum, More, & Steane, 2016). The grounded theory\nmethodology applied to this research suggests that the\ninclusion of these elements in existing change manage-\nment models may, with the aid of further research, support\nthe development of specific change management models\nfor application in this sector.\n1Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia\n2Australia Institute of Management, Sydney, Australia\n3Australian Catholic University, Sydney, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid Rosenbaum, Faculty of Business and Economics, Macquarie\nEmail: drosenbaum@optimumnfp.com.au\nApplying Grounded Theory to\nInvestigating Change Management\nin the Nonprofit Sector\nDavid Rosenbaum1, A.

In feeding\nthis ongoing dilemma, qualitative research appears to have\ndivided itself into two quite broad camps, one which seeks to\nlink its own legitimacy to the positivist world, and the other\nwhich seeks to specifically extricate itself from this poten-\ntially restrictive set of barriers and be differentiated by focus-\ning on an interpretivist approach. The former seeks to\nlegitimize itself in the eyes of quantitative researchers, and\nthe latter seeks to substantiate qualitative research as a valid\nalternative, supportive rather than competitive, motivated to\nachieve additional, and valuable, research outcomes.\nResearchers have, over the years, identified the challenges of\nsuch broad epistemological variations (Angen, 2000; Jardine,\nhas grown in application and use (Cooper & White, 2012;\nCummings, Daellenbach, Davenport, & Campbell, 2013;\nMorse et al., 2009), debates concerning the methodological\nparadigms between approaches, and questions about the\nbroader practical use of qualitative research continue (Bansal,\nBertels, Ewart, MacConnachie, & O'Brien, 2012; Denyer &\nRecognizing the important distinction between the meth-\nodology of grounded theory, represented by the principles\nembodied in these essential elements, and the methods of\ngrounded theory, as a prescriptive process of applying these\nelements into a practical, prescriptive set of procedures to\ngenerate and analyze data, underpins the central purpose of\nthis article. The fundamental aim of the research reported\nhere was to identify the extent to which change management\nin the nonprofit sector displayed characteristics and features\nthat distinguished the process from change management in\nthe commercial sector, from which all contemporary change\nmanagement models originate. A qualitative research\napproach was identified as relevant because (a) there was a\nneed to understand change based on interpreting relevant\nprocesses in the context of everyday activities of those who\nexperienced it, and (b) to work within the settings of their\ndaily routines and work programs. Together, these pointed to\nthe applicability of grounded theory as the appropriate\nmethod for pursuing these aims, especially given that sym-\nbolic interactionism, which underpinned the development of\ngrounded theory, had been crucial to understanding and\ninterpreting patterns of human behavior (Chenitz & Swanson,\nWhile grounded theory has developed along different lines\nof execution and use since its first application (B. G. Glaser &\nStrauss, 1970), there has been recognition of the ongoing\ndevelopment and adaptation that each application of such\nmethodology makes to the original theory (Morse et al., 2009).\nWhile variation in method, as distinct from methodology, is\nbeing applied in the research described in this article, com-\nmonly accepted aspects of the recognized methods remain as\ncornerstones (Tummers & Karsten, 2012). Consequently, the\nresearch method applied here ensures the application of true\ngrounded theory as distinct from a descriptive or exploratory\nresearch approach (Birks & Mills, 2011).\nThis article identifies a specific application of grounded\ntheory method to study change management in the nonprofit\nsector, and in doing so, provides input into the development\nof a range of prescriptive processes that may guide future\nresearchers and future applications of the methodology. This\nis consistent with the views expressed by Strauss and Corbin\n(Denzin & Lincoln, 1994) regarding the potential develop-\nment of grounded theory in the course of applying it to dif-\nferent research settings:\nAs with any general methodology, grounded theory's actual use\nin practice has varied with the specifics of the area under study,\nthe purpose and focus of the research, the contingencies faced\nduring the project, and perhaps also the temperament and\nparticular gifts or weaknesses of the researcher. (p. 276)\nProcess Overview\nAs described in more detail throughout this article, the spe-\ncific application of grounded theory to the study of change\nmanagement in the nonprofit sector, via a longitudinal case\nstudy, was structured in a manner consistent with the princi-\nples developed by its founders (B. G. Glaser & Strauss,\n1970), as well as those that underpinned variations to the\noriginal application (B. G. Glaser, 2001).\nFigure 1 identifies an overview of the processes devel-\noped and applied by the principal researcher where spe-\ncific procedures become individualized through ongoing\napplications of grounded theory to new research settings.\nThis further defines the range of tools that, when applied,\nmay lay another foundation stone in the bridge-building\nexercise between a process that provides little by way of\nprescription, and the broad criticism of grounded theory as\na means of escaping theory testing (Goldthorpe, 1997,\nalso be fueled by poor appreciation of the role of qualita-\ntive research and its importance in identifying new inter-\nwhich a well-developed and well-applied grounded theory\nresearch may offer.\nThis process of moving from the design phases to the col-\nlection and analysis phases is detailed further in Tables 1 to 3.\nResearch Design\nTable 1 identifies the various subprocesses involved during\nresearch design and identifies the activity level for each as\nwell as the linkages back to the broader grounded theory\nmethodology and methods.\nRosenbaum et al. 3\nThe design of the research focused on contributing to\nchange management theory through the use and application\nof grounded theory, observing that such an approach focuses\nthe research on how change is perceived by those that are\naffected by the process and recognizing that existing change\nmanagement models in use do not adequately capture the\ncomplexity of the change process from the perspective of\nchange recipients (Balogun & Jenkins, 2003). The original\nimpetus for the research was the need to move beyond tradi-\ntional methodology used in understanding change manage-\nment, given that anecdotal evidence revealed how a range of\ncharacteristics of people working in this sector may affect\nhow change unfolds and is therefore managed.\nThis sees the principal researcher applying a constructiv-\nist approach to the application of grounded theory, where the\nemphasis on data is predicated on personal attachment to the\nresearch, the role that previous knowledge and experience\nplays during the research process, and emphasizing the\nresearcher's role and actions (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007;\n2012), the reality that data and analysis are social constructs\nrather than pure objective facts (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007),\nand the epistemological underpinning regarding how data\nare constructed and interpreted (Fendt & Sachs, 2008).\nThe importance of understanding change through the lens\nof those experiencing it was viewed as a pivotal approach,\nespecially in the context of studying change management\nwhere historical approaches have viewed change from an\norganizational perspective, with limited research regarding\nthe views, thoughts, and feelings of actors immersed in the\nprocess (Fox-Wolfgramm, Boal, & Hunt, 1998; Oreg &\n2011). In addition, in order to account for the impact of\nchange on organisational actors over time, a longitudinal\napproach (van den Broek, Boselie, & Paauwe, 2013) was\nadopted to enable views of their changing environment, and\ntheir feelings toward these events, that would impact on the\nsuccess or otherwise of the change program to be assessed\n(Bartunek, Rousseau, Rudolph, & DePalma, 2006).\nExisting literature and its use remains one of the outstand-\ning issues in the ongoing debate between Glaser and Strauss'\noriginal approach to grounded theory, and the approach sub-\nsequently developed by Strauss (B. G. Glaser & Strauss,\nthat suggested no engagement with existing literature on the\nresearch topic prior to any forms of data collection. It was\nreasoned that such engagement would inhibit the natural\nemergence of categories from the empirical data (Dey, 2007;\nResearch Design\nSubject literature\nreview\nMethods\nliterature review\nCase study\ndeterminaon\nInfrastructure\ncreaon\nData Collecon\nProtocols\nProcesses\nField work\nData Analysis\nInterviews\nOther data forms\nTheorecal\nsampling\nTheorecal\nsaturaon\nGrounded Theory\nChange\nmanagement in\nthe nonprofit\nsector\nFigure 1.

This base\nknowledge was further developed during the data analysis\nphase as specific research-related issues developed, which\nfocused the attention of the researcher to different areas of\nliterature on related subject matters, designed to expand\nknowledge in areas considered relevant. This also supported\nthe research question of what can be learned from a nonprofit\nTable 3.

An extensive litera-\nture review was undertaken on grounded theory as a method-\nology to enable the researcher to effectively design and\ninitiate an appropriate grounded theory method to answer\nthis question.\nA single case study (Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, 1989;\nidentified as relevant, given the need to source an organiza-\ntional change program that enabled longitudinal analysis on\na before-the-change, during-the-change, and after-the-\nchange basis. This accounts for the temporal aspects of the\nchange program (Beer & Nohria, 2000; Buchanan et al.,\nThe research was undertaken over a 3-year period in a\nlarge nonprofit general hospital undergoing the implementa-\ntion of an in-house designed E-Pathways system that sought\nto replace an existing paper-based patient records process\nwith an integrated online pathways-based platform. The\nresearch involved data analysis from 56 structured and semi-\nstructured interviews (Mossholder, Settoon, Harris, &\nposes (Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, 1989), a range of hospital-\nbased documentation, as well as information gleaned from\nattendance at a number of staff meetings, which the principal\nresearcher attended as a nonparticipant observer (Denzin &\nThe software program Nvivo 10 was used as a tool to ana-\nlyze the transcripts. As has been suggested by some research-\ners (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007), the software application was\nnot the central focus for developing the grounded theory.\nRather, the software was merely an aid, or tool, in the pro-\ncess. Theory development resulted from intimate involve-\nment with the data, avoiding the possible risk of displacing\npersonal immersion in the data through a cognitive process,\nwith a detached software driven process that, if fully applied,\n\"extracts\" themes from word usage and frequency patterns.\nA heavy focus and reliance on the software application, for\npurposes other than maintaining easier access and tracking of\nlarge data volumes and cross referencing, could jeopardize\nthe quality of the developed grounded theory.\nIn this manner, the research deemphasized the role of soft-\nware in the process and stressed the fluidity and dynamic nature\nof qualitative analysis (Morse et al., 2009). This was further\nemphasized by appreciating that the outcomes of each inter-\nview were dependent on a number of key attributes of the inter-\nviewer, including preexisting knowledge and how that would\nbe applied, levels of sensitivity that are brought to the inter-\nview, and the ability to apply empathy toward the interviewee\nduring the conduct of the interviews (Kvale, 1996), thereby\ngaining their trust and eliciting meaningful data. This under-\npins what has been described as the \"discovery tradition\" of\nfield research and stressing the creativity involved in data inter-\nData Collection Supported by Ongoing\nData Construction\nTable 2 identifies the various subprocesses involved during\ndata collection and identifies the activity level for each, as\nwell as the linkages back to the broader grounded theory\nmethodology and methods.\nInterviews were undertaken at the hospital's premises as\nnurses and allied health staff were either commencing their\nshifts or completing them. All interviews were conducted in\nstaff rooms, offices, hospital cafes, or vacant ward rooms,\ndepending on the shift that the interviewee was completing\nor about to commence. With permission of each of the inter-\nviewees, a recording device was used from which transcripts\nwere created and used for purposes of data analysis. In this\nmanner, rapport with interviewees ensued, and while the\npure neo-positivist approach to interviews was largely\nrejected, in line with the principal researcher's epistemologi-\ncal view of data gathering and data generation, the straddling\nbetween a \"romantic\" and \"constructionist\" approach was\nInterviews were semistructured, which maximized the\nbreadth of interactions between the researcher and the inter-\nviewee (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994), and well supported in a\ngrounded theory methodology (Goulding, 2002). This\napproach remains consistent with approaching interviewer\nand interviewee interaction from a constructionist perspec-\ntive (Rowley, 2012). In addition, in researching such an orga-\nnizational process as change management, interview-based\napproaches have been widely applied in qualitative studies\nInterviewees included representatives from all ward nurs-\ning staff, ward nursing managers, allied health professionals,\nmanagerial staff involved in designing the E-Pathways sys-\ntem as well as those tasked with implementing the system,\nincluding the internally designated change agent. Members\nof the hospital's executive team, including the chief execu-\ntive officer, were also interviewed. This wide source of inter-\nviews ensured that interview data were obtained from an\narray of those who were impacted by the changes, directly\nand indirectly. In keeping with theoretical sampling princi-\nples, these interviews developed an iterative framework as\ndata analysis informed ongoing interviews.\nThe areas covered by the contents of the semistructured\ninterviews, focused on the phases through which the organi-\nzational changes associated with the E-Pathways implemen-\ntation went through, as well as the areas within the hospital\nfrom which the interviewees originated. In this manner, there\nwere a series of semistructured questions that reflected the\nlongitudinal nature of the research and related to the stages\nof \"before-the-change,\" \"during-the-change,\" and \"after-the-\nchange.\" In addition, there was a different focus of interview\n6 SAGE Open\nquestions for different interviewee groups, namely, execu-\ntive-level team members, manager-level team members, and\nstaff-level team members. Each group's semistructured inter-\nviews reflected their different levels of responsibility and\nexperience with regard the implementation, and therefore the\nassociated change program. In this manner, purpose and\nstructure were closely interlinked (Cassell, 2009).\nRecognizing interviews as being the predominant source\nof data (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994), in keeping with the tradi-\ntions of grounded theory, the concept of data was widely\napplied (B. G. Glaser, 2001) and related to data extracted\nfrom interview transcripts, from organizational documenta-\ntion, from attendance by the researcher at numerous hospital\nstaff and working party meetings as a nonparticipant observer,\nand from general observation of hospital staff interactions\nthroughout the hospital during the period of the change pro-\ngram. In this manner, data triangulation (Trent, 2012; van den\nBroek et al., 2013) supported data analysis, which also\ndirected ongoing interviews.\nData Analysis\nTable 3 identifies the various subprocesses involved during\ndata analysis and identifies the activity level for each, as well\nas the linkages back to the broader grounded theory method-\nology and methods.\nAll interviews were recorded and transcribed using a pro-\nfessional transcription service to cope with the volumes of\ndata that were obtained during the course of the interviews,\nwhich resulted in 360 pages of interview data, all of which\nprovided the depth of rich descriptions and explanations to\nsupport the emerging theory and much of the raw material\nnecessary in the discovery process (Bryant & Charmaz,\ndata also included the researcher's attendance at the numer-\nous staff and other in-house meetings attended as a nonpar-\nticipant observer, where recordings were also made of all\nproceedings (with approval of participants and meeting\nchairs). These transcripts were also prepared in a similar\nfashion to the one-on-one interviews. Transcripts were fur-\nther enhanced by the inclusion of documentation reviews,\nwith the latter incorporated into WORD documents for ongo-\ning analysis. When combined, the interview data, the meet-\ning notes, and the documentation review notes resulted in\nmore than 400 pages of raw data to be applied in the overall\ninterpretation and theory development process.\nCoding of data was undertaken using Nvivo software ver-\nsions 9 and 10 (updates applied as available throughout the\nresearch process). Using Nvivo terminology, Nodes (Codes)\nwere identified a posteriori, and in the process, descriptions\napplied for each newly identified Node. These descriptions\nlaid the initial foundations for detailed memos that were used\nin redefining the Nodes as more and more data were coded\nthat underpinned the constant comparison of data and Nodes.\nThis led to Nodes being initially created in large numbers as\nmore and more data were coded, followed by Node changes\nand rationalization as previously coded data were reviewed,\nNode relationships were identified, themes extracted and the\nformation and definition of levels of Nodes that enabled the-\noretical sampling and, finally, theoretical saturation, leading\nto theory development.\nWhile memos provided the framework and glue that\nenabled the process to evolve, as identified in recognized\ngrounded theory method (Birks & Mills, 2011; Bryant &\nreliance on the development of a detailed research log,\nreferred to by some as a research diary (Newbury, 2001), and\nin other cases extended to be known as a reflective journal\n(Ortlipp, 2008), as distinct from participant diaries which\noften support data collection and interpretation (Jacelon &\nImperio, 2005). The principal researcher applied more of a\nreflective component to its development and maintained this\nthrough the theory development stage of the research, apply-\ning the research log in ways that identified his own experi-\nences and values. This approach supported the way chosen to\nrepresent the research findings (Harrison, MacGibbon, &\nMorton, 2001), while also utilizing the log to effectively\n\"think-through\" the more challenging aspects of qualitative\nresearch, and grounded theory more specifically, in areas of\nconstant comparison, theoretical saturation, theoretical sam-\npling, validity, and transparency.\nThe overall process has been detailed diagrammatically in\nFigure 2 and focuses on a range of process issues. These\nwere designed to inform a prescriptive aspect to the \"doing\"\nof grounded research, while maintaining the cognitive com-\nponent. Such a structured and integrated approach ensures\ndifferentiation between grounded theory and a descriptive\nexploratory research perspective (Birks & Mills, 2011).\nFigure 2 identifies the bottom-up approach that was\ndeveloped in applying grounded theory (remembering the\nuse and application of Nvivo descriptors which were manda-\ntory). An explanation of terms developed and used in this\nprocess are as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 LRM = Linkage Review Memos, being the memos\nidentified in grounded theory method. The term link-\nage was introduced by the principal researcher to\nensure clarification regarding their use in theoretical\nsampling and constant comparison.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 RL = Research Logs, being the document created that\nidentified an activity or observation for which detailed\nideas were documented with high levels of detail, and\nsupported by their levels of importance and action\npoints that required consideration.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 NIML1 and NIML2 = Node Interrelationship Map\nLevel 1, being the assessment of the first level Nodes\nthat resulted from the first level coding of interview\ntranscripts and other data gathering sources. These\nwere structured using a purpose designed Excel\nspreadsheet format. When combined with the LRMs\nand the RL, these developed into NIML2 (Node\nInterrelationship Map Level 2), which operated at\nRosenbaum et al. 7\nvarious levels including, supporting constant compar-\nison and theoretical saturation, given the emphasis on\nbio-direction between them. These essential compo-\nnents of grounded theory were, accordingly, applied\nin this formal circular movement to eventually evolve\nto a higher level, being the HLDC.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 HLDC = Higher Level Descriptive Characteristics,\nbeing the result of the above interactions which sought\nto identify the characteristics identified in the data,\nstructured in the form of Node Groupings (NG),\ninformed by the LRMs and the RL, and developed\ninto key aspects of theory which evolved inductively\nfrom the data.\nThe process began with the Nvivo coded interview tran-\nscripts (\"NCIT\"), which informed the Linkage Review\nMemos (\"LRM\"). The LRMs were created from the begin-\nning of data collection, document reviews, and observational\nopportunities. As informed by grounded theory application,\nthese became the linchpin of the research. The LRMs were\nconstantly updated by, and referenced in, the Research log\n(\"RL\"). The LRMs, supported by the RL evolved into two\nlevels of Node Interrelationship Maps (\"NIML1\" and\n\"NIML2\"). Level 1 maps identified the first level of Node\nrelationships that were identified in the data and supported\nby detailed comments made in the LRMs. These LRMs were\ncreated around a four-level structure which sought to develop\nthe researcher's views around general thoughts regarding the\nNodes, the relationships between other existing Nodes, the\npotential creation of new Nodes, and considerations regard-\ning further analysis in existing literature.\nThe NIML1 and supporting comments in the RL led to the\nflow of information into the NIML2, which grouped Nodes\ninto broader categories that was supported by the ongoing\nanalysis of the data. Continued assessment of the LRMs in the\ncontext of the RL identified the linkages between Nodes,\nNvivo Coded Interview Transcripts\n(and other data sources)\nNode Interrelaonship Map Level 1\nNode Interrelaonship Map level 2\nLower Level Nodes\nNode Groupings [NG]\nHigher Level Nodes\nHigh Level Descripve\nCharacteriscs [HLDC]\nLinkage Review Memos\nResearch Log\n[RL]\nGrounded Theory\nFigure 2.

This ongoing\niterative process enabled the creation of both higher level and\nlower level Nodes, which underpinned theory development\nthrough a foundational structuring process of Node Groupings\n(\"NG\") that linked a range of Nodes to their Higher Level\nDescriptive Characteristics (\"HLDC\"). A secondary attach-\nment to a further list of potential Nodes in the NIML2 were\nalso identified in this process, and were used to reinforce the\ntheory through both positive and negative correlations. This\nwas identified in the LRMs throughout the process.\nThe structure in Figure 2 illustrates the links between data\nand the construction of theory, via the use and application of\nmemos (LRMs and RL) and the iterative process of compar-\ning data with categories and categories with categories\n(NIML1 and NIML2), in recognition of the importance of\nconstant comparative analysis as a cornerstone in true\ngrounded theory. As categories are developed and refined,\ntheoretical sampling provides further input into the process\nto support theory creation (NG and HLDC). At this point in\nthe process, theoretical saturation of categories is achieved\nwhen no further developments can be identified in category\nlinkages (NG) or category refinement (HLDC), supporting\nthe essence of grounded theory as developed, and reinforcing\nthe utility of the method.\nThis research method identifies the unique attributes of a\nconstructivist approach to grounded theory. It highlights\nvariations in the position of the researcher, where reality is\nnot independent of the researcher, and where multiple reali-\nties and nuances of data construction exist. This is distinct\nfrom data collection, as well as the construction of theory\nrather than the discovery of theory, and the earlier recogni-\ntion of extant literature around the subject area (Aminian,\nUse of Literature\nWhile grounded theory method is the focus of this article and\nthe processes identified in Figure 2, the use and timing of\nliterature in grounded theory research has been one of the\nissues that has loomed large as a focal point of dissention\namong the three broad grounded theory \"camps\" of its origi-\nnal founders (B. G. Glaser & Strauss, 1970), its refiners\n(Corbin & Strauss, 1990), and its revisionist (Charmaz,\n2006). The use of existing literature in grounded theory has\nbeen described as a \"polemic\" and \"divisive\" (Dunne, 2011)\nissue among experienced researchers, and a potential for\nconfusion for less experienced researchers and those consid-\nering its use in PhD research.\nThis is a challenge of timing (Cutcliffe, 2000; McGhee,\nMarland, & Atkinson, 2007), not of application. However, it\nresults in a range of theoretical and practical considerations.\nIn the context of the founders of grounded theory, the key\nissue was the extent to which a review of existing literature\nat the onset of the research would effectively inhibit the\nemergence of categories naturally from the empirical data,\nowing to the impact of extant theoretical frameworks and\ntheir related hypothesis (Dunne, 2011). The approach\nadopted by Corbin and Strauss (1990) placed less emphasis\non the process issues of grounded theory and viewed proce-\ndures as tools that help the researcher to build theories\ngrounded in data. In this manner, the literature could support\nthe development of the research question. The approach\nadopted by Charmaz (2006) was even more practical in that\nit considered researchers having ideas about the literature\naround the subject area as a possible vantage point which\nwould add value to the process of theory construction.\nThe approach adopted in the present research was\nimpacted by a range of factors including the professional\nbackground of the principal researcher which involved prac-\ntical management experience in change, as well as a practical\nhistory in the management of change within the nonprofit\nsector, and, specifically, within a hospital setting. This led to\nthe proposition of using literature during the process of data\nanalysis as well as during theory construction. As referenced\nearlier, focused literature reviews were undertaken through-\nout the use of the LRMs to inform the identification of Node\nrelationships (categories). Counteracting any possible nega-\ntive impact of such early engagement with literature was a\nprocess of reflexivity that was effectively built into both the\nLRMs and the RL, an approach well referenced in the\ngrounded theory process literature (Heath, 2006; McGhee\nRecommendations for Further\nResearch\nAs a single case study, the hypothesis developed should be\ntested in further nonprofit settings in order that a more gen-\neralized application of the findings can be tested. To support\nsuch an approach, further research, which could be under-\ntaken and is currently being considered, would include the\nfollowing elements:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Alongitudinal grounded theory study in a second non-\nprofit hospital undergoing similar change in order,\nmagnitude, and type as was undertaken in this\nresearch. Such a study would seek, in a similar man-\nner to the present study, to understand change from\nthe perspective of those experiencing it, with out-\ncomes being compared with those achieved in the\npresent study. This would provide clarity as to the\nhypothesis derived in the present study and determine\nboth its veracity as well as potential other intervening\nfactors that could expand it.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A longitudinal grounded theory study in a nonprofit\norganization outside of the hospital sector in an orga-\nnization that is undergoing major change of the order\nof magnitude experienced in this present study. This\nwould provide clarity as to the extent to which the\nhypothesis developed here is applicable to a broader\nRosenbaum et al. 9\nnonprofit context or the possibility that it may be\nmore specific to a hospital setting.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Finally, a longitudinal grounded theory study in a for-\nprofit organization within the hospital sector in an\norganization undergoing similar change. Such a study\nwould seek to determine the extent to which the\nhypothesis identified in the present study is in fact\nunique to the nonprofit sector through a process that\nhas had limited application in previous change man-\nagement case study research.\nConclusion\nWhile this article identifies a specific approach to grounded\ntheory research in a unique application, it does so from the\nperspective that methodology is different from method,\nwhere the former remains true to the origins of grounded\ntheory, and the latter recognizes that each application of\ngrounded theory further develops it as a qualitative research\nmethodology. The approach developed in this research\nresponds to the prescriptive challenges of applying a set of\nepistemological approaches to qualitative research, while\nmaintaining the core elements of grounded theory--namely,\nconstant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling, and\ntheoretical saturation.\nThe historical roots of grounded theory evolved from the\nearly dominance of research settings that reflected the\nstrong quantitative ideological framework. This dominance\nsaw qualitative methodologically based research viewed in\nadverse terms (Johnson, Long, & White, 2001) and rele-\ngated as subsidiary to more scientific based quantitative\nmethodologies. Responding to this positivist paradigm,\ngrounded theory developed as a means of generating theory\nfrom real-world data, evolving over time, to incorporate a\nwider application of methods, in a world that has since\ncome to value the addition to knowledge that qualitative\nresearch can bring, resulting in part, from the rigor of anal-\nysis as well as the richness and depth of interpretation (D.\nThe grounded theory approach to both collecting and ana-\nlyzing interview and related data supported an understanding\nof how change recipients as well as change agents, involved\nthemselves in, and responded to, a wide range of organiza-\ntional processes and dynamics that characterized the changes\nat the hospital. As a recognized qualitative research method-\nology, its unique inductive underpinning supported a depth\nof understanding through the thoughts, feelings, responses,\nattitudes, and emotions of those involved in, and affected by\nthe processes, over its duration. In the context of a growing\nappreciation in recent change management literature as to the\nimportance of the individuals in change, as distinct to just the\norganizational focus, grounded theory supports the depth of\nanalysis and understanding to be achieved by seeing change\nthrough the eyes of those who are experiencing it, planning\nit, and managing it, and doing so in the context of an iterative\ndata analysis approach that is sensitive to the gradation\nwithin that data and its meaning.\nThe research outcomes resulting from the application of\ngrounded theory methodology, and supported by the specif-\nics of the method identified in this article, to the study of a\nsingle case study in the management of change in the non-\nprofit sector, supported the hypothesis identified earlier\nregarding the identification of four key characteristics that\nnecessitated an increased focus in planned organizational\nchange. These were the inclusion of formal reflection time\nfor change agents and change recipients during the change\nprogram, the development of trust and confidence in the\norganization prior to the actual change commencing, ensur-\ning an appropriate focus on the individual experience of\nchange rather than an entirely organizational focus, and the\nidentification of a range of sequencing events necessary\nthroughout the change program. By outlining specific\ngrounded theory design characteristics focused on research-\ning change from the perspective of change recipients, this\nstudy has further developed grounded theory as a research\nmethod, while identifying a number of change management\nactivities that may underpin successful change management\nwithin the nonprofit sector, thereby contributing to the theory\nand practice of change, in a sector that has not been the sub-\nject of such research to date.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAminian, E., Kirkham, R., & Fenn, P.
