At 1 minute past 3, a stream of the youngest children pours out into\nthe square and starts to noisily disperse in the crowd of waiting parents. A few\nminutes later, the older children join their younger schoolmates in the square.\nA number of children gather in groups, observably more boisterous than the chil-\ndren who have joined their parents. They pull out stacks of cards and start trading.\n``A seal for these two!'' ``I already have a seal!'' ``I'll trade you this giraffe\ninstead'' . . . Excitement is mounting, children push and shove.\nA number of boys climb the monkey bars in the school playground, followed by\nother children who shout excitedly: ``Strooien, strooien!'' [``Throw them around!'']\nOne of the boys pulls out his stack of cards, shows them to the group below, and\nannounces that he is going to tear the cards. Children below shout ``Don't tear\nthem'' and implore him to throw them down instead. The boy takes his time,\npulling out one card after another and showing each to the public, while children's\nhands extend up in an effort to grab the cards. One girl almost succeeds in grabbing\na card, but the boy pulls it back and tears it into two, telling the girl to pick up the\npieces. Following the shouts of discontent from other spectators, the boy throws all\nthe cards in the air and they start to land like confetti in the outstretched hands of\nthe children who stand under the monkey bars.\n``They are just like monkeys!'' \u00ad remarks a mother with a white scarf, standing\nnext to the researcher.\n``I cannot wait till this promotion is over . . . '' \u00ad sighs another mother in red coat.\n``Well, I think it's great!'' \u00ad interjects a third mother in a yellow coat excitedly.\n``These are beautiful cards!''\n``What about this trading?'' \u00ad ventures her husband.\n``Trading is good for children's social skills . . . and this way they learn about\nanimals!'' \u00ad replies his wife. Their daughter runs toward them, excitedly waiving the\ncards in the air.\n``Isn't it some kind of Greenpeace promotion?'' \u00ad reflects the father.\n``I think it's just the way to make us buy more stuff in the store'' \u00ad shrugs the\nmother in the red coat. ``My kid wants to collect all those soft animals they sell\ntoo!'' \u00ad reflects the white scarfed mother. ``I don't mind having them myself!'' \u00ad the\nmother in a yellow coat offers.\n``Greenpeace probably gets part of the proceeds'' \u00ad reflects the father and looks\nat the researcher: ``Do you have any idea, does this Greenpeace or whatever it was\nget part of the proceeds?'' ``Probably, in a way . . . '' \u00ad the researcher answers.\n``Well, everybody's got to make a living!'' \u00ad the father reflects gaily.\n``They are probably made in China'' \u00ad the mother in red coat sniffs and ventures\ninto the playground to disengage her child from the group of trading children.\nThis article links the literature and empirical observations on sustainable con-\nsumption, strategic choices of environmental non-governmental organizations\n(ENGOs) and business stakeholders, and environmental education (EE). The crit-\nical literature addresses issues associated with ``green'' consumption and locates\nconsumers and their practices in the cultural, social, and economic contexts\n2009, 2010). We shall discuss how this critical literature interrogates the rhetoric\nand assumptions of ethical consumption and its relationship to environmental\nawareness.\nNext, we shall examine the literature on strategic collaboration between ENGOs\nand businesses, particularly in the Dutch context (Bos et al., 2013; Glasbergen,\nation is to gain insight into the reasons why businesses and ENGOs cooperate\nstrategically and how different stakeholders relate to this cooperation. This litera-\nture is embedded within the broader research on ``green alliances'' between busi-\nnesses and their suppliers, competitors, and other stakeholders (Arts, 2002; Crane,\ncommon in recent decades, raising concerns about the motives behind collaborative\npartnerships between agencies whose relationships were traditionally antagonistic\nWhile this literature explores green marketing strategies within stakeholder\ntheory and the networks model of industrial markets (e.g. Crane, 1998), critical\nenvironmental interdependencies between commercial companies, NGOs, and con-\nsumers are rarely examined. This article will examine interdependencies between\ncommercial companies, ENGOs, and consumers, and educational benefits of such\nalliances to the consumer, focusing on the congruity of bonds between various\nalliances in the context of sustainability.\nThe interest in the purpose of collaborations between businesses and ENGOs\nintroduces the third strand of literature on EE. EE normally refers to a learning\nprocess that increases students' awareness and knowledge about the environment\nand associated challenges, develops the necessary skills and expertise to address the\nchallenges, and fosters attitudes, motivations, and commitments to make informed\ndecisions (Tbilisi Declaration, 1978). While research in EE is very broad, dating\nback a few decades to the first issues of The Journal of Environmental Education\nin 1969, this article will particularly draw upon the EE literature relevant to con-\nsumption and environmental awareness.\nWe shall focus on the Super Animals collectable cards (hereafter referred to as\nAnimal Cards) promotion as a catalyst for the discussion on sustainability and\nconsumption. The Animal Cards grew out of the partnership between the Dutch\nbranch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF; in Dutch Wereld Natuur Fonds or\nWNF) and the Dutch supermarket Albert Heijn (AH).\nThis article addresses the case of the Animal Cards as an example of a collab-\norative effort between WWF and AH. As WWF claims that its cooperation with\nAH serves an educational function, this article focuses on the educational effects of\nthe strategic collaboration between WWF and AH.\nCase description\nIn The Netherlands, these included a growing number of youth members, through\ntheir membership of youth clubs such as WNF-Bamboekidz, WNF-Rangers, and\nWNF-Lifeguards. Founded in 1887, AH is the oldest company owned and oper-\nated by Ahold and currently owns more than 850 stores and employs around\n74,000 people, making it one of the largest employers in The Netherlands\n(https://www.ahold.com/Media/Albert-Heijn.htm).\nSince 2007, the partnership between these two organizations has developed ``to\nhelp find solutions to a range of sustainability issues'' (Ahold, 2011). In March\n2011, AH and WNF launched the Animal Cards promotion for the first time.\nSupermarket customers could receive Animal Cards by spending 10 euros on gro-\nceries. The cards contained pictures and information about animals and were dis-\ntributed in small paper\u00adplastic packages of four cards. A plastic-coated collector's\nalbum or a wooden box in which to store the full set of 204 Animal Cards could\nalso be purchased at the store. Additionally, a selection of soft toy animals with\nWNF labels could be purchased (WNF, 2012c). AH announced that it would pay\nthe first 2 months of WNF membership subscription for customers who were\n``inspired by the promotion'' (Ahold, 2011).\nThe success of this joint initiative in 2011 led to the second Animal Cards pro-\ndifferent cards in 17 different categories, ranging from ``animals with funny names''\nto ``animals with crazy hair styles'' (Albert Heijn Koornneef, 2012). As in the\nprevious year, customers were encouraged to collect all the cards and buy newly\ndesigned albums and boxes in which to keep them (Albert Heijn, 2012a). Instead of\nthe paper\u00adplastic packages used in 2011, smaller paper attachments were used. In\ninformation).\nJudging by postings by both AH and WWF, the partners considered the action\nBoth AH and WWF reported that their cooperation is going to stimulate sustain-\nability of the international production of palm oil, timber, paper, and soya, and\nserves to stimulate the green economy. Both partners reported that their efforts\nwere targeted to stimulate sustainable production and consumption, with WWF\nadditionally emphasizing the role of environmental awareness that such cooper-\nation raises. AH, on the other hand, assumed benefit from the commercial success\nof increased sales (although official numbers were not reported) or at least through\nthe ``greener'' image acquired through association with ENGO. The commercial\nsuccess of Animal Cards was not only evident from AH's sales but also from the\nnumber of postings on Martplaats.nl (the largest on-line market platform in The\nNetherlands, similar to e-Bay) offering Animal Cards collections since 2011\nMethodology\nThis research is based on a case study involving participant observation conducted\nwith upper elementary Montessori elementary school children aged between 7 and\n10 years and their parents between September and December 2012. The school has\na population of 79 children and is located in a predominantly ethnically Dutch\nwell-to-do area in Amsterdam. The researcher approached the children and their\nparents after school at regular intervals. While the researcher attempted to engage\nin conversations with children independently of their parents or guardians, these\nconversations were often conducted in mixed groups of children and parents.\nConversations with individual children were conducted with parental consent\nand sometimes outside the school premises in their homes. Conversations with\nparents were conducted with and without children present, within school premises\nand at home. All names were changed.\nThe participant observation method was chosen because it enabled the\nresearcher to gain a close familiarity with the parents and children over an extended\nperiod of time (Spradley, 1980). Children were chosen as ``stakeholders'' because,\nfirst, the Animal Cards are targeted toward the children and, second, because\nchildren can be seen as future ``potential'' customers or donors. The parents and\nguardians were chosen because they were the ``financers'' of the Animal Cards and\npresumably had an influence on their children's opinions and behavior.\nThe researcher spent a total of about 15 hours socializing with children and\nparents outside the school area and about the same amount of time in the homes of\nfive families. Since this was a predominantly ethnographic descriptive study, dis-\ncourse analysis was applied to organize the data in thematic clusters. Discourse\nanalysis involves recording interactions; transcribing the recorded material; formu-\nlating claims about the conversational moves, structures and strategies demon-\nstrated in the interaction and then building an argument using transcript\nexcerpts that have been analyzed (Tracy and Mirivel, 2009: 153). The segments\nof informal conversations were entered in notes. These were then analyzed to create\nbasic qualitative sections by coding key words or sentences. The researcher has\nfiltered only those segments of observed behaviors and conversations that were\nrelated to the children's and parent's attitudes toward ethical consumption or to\ncooperation between commercial and non-profit sector organizations. The three\ninterlinked strands of literature are presented below and then linked to the case\nstudy.\nConsumption and sustainability\nRichard Wilk (2009) has inquired, ``What makes human wants and needs grow?\nHow do things that were once distant luxuries \u00ad say, hot water \u00ad become basic\nnecessities that people expect on demand for civilized life?'' One of the possible\nanswers is that various retailers have discovered that triggering consumption is\nrelatively easy, despite religious, ideological, moral, and political barriers\nsocial status marker since consumer products are symbolic objects through\nwhich we communicate our social status. Marketing psychologists, economists,\nand retailers have long discovered that goods are facilitators of symbolic commu-\nnication and exploited the opportunities offered by the knowledge of human psych-\nology in devising marketing strategies to entice the consumers (Blowfield, 2013).\nThese marketing strategies are increasingly applied on the global scale. While\n``raising the standard of living'' may be aimed at ending severe deprivation, trans-\nlated into policy the expression is a euphemism for the global dissemination of\nwealth leads to a greater spread of consumerist culture. Unless the consumption\npattern in rich countries is made more sustainable, the crisis of resources is likely to\n``Sustainable,'' ``responsible,'' ``ethical,'' or ``green'' consumption may seem like\nthe silver bullet. The ``moral nature'' of objects can spring from the objects' social,\neconomic, environmental, and political contexts. Ethical consumers can be defined\nas those whose decisions as to what to consume are shaped by their assessment of\nthe moral nature of that context (Carrier, 2012: 1).\nYet, even the most environmentally minded consumers find it difficult to con-\nsume less or consume sustainably. In Confessions of an Eco-Sinner, Fred Pearce\n(2008) set out to track down the people behind the production and distribution of\neverything in his daily life. He discovered that awareness of unsustainability is not\nenough to lead sustainable lifestyle. In the same spirit, Colin Beavan performed the\npublic experiment of ``extreme environmental living'' in the middle of Manhattan,\nlooking for alternatives to the typical American's consumption-based way of life.\nThe popular book No Impact Man has brought concerns about the social dimen-\nsions of consumption to the fore (Beavan, 2009). One of the most acute observa-\ntions was how Beavan's family and friends reacted to what they saw as his\nextremely odd way of living.\nIn line with the ``rebound effect'' theory that states that green marketing drives\neven more consumption (Greening et al., 2000), scholars have noted contradictions\nof ``green consumption'' (e.g. Connolly and Prothero, 2008; Kopnina, 2014; Wilk,\nalso be driving more consumption as it aims to absolve consumers of their guilt but\nfails in stopping over-consumption (Isenhour, 2010).\nWilk (2010) notes that there may even be a ``moral rebound effect'' where\nreiterating the message creates guilt, which ``drives the continuing bulimic cycle\nof binge and purge so characteristic of contemporary consumer culture'' (p. 42).\nThe concept of ``sustainable consumption'' has been a ``bit of jargon that allows\nscience to say one thing and the public to hear another'' (Wilk, 2010: 47). Green\nconsumption or ``capitalism with the human face'' can be a clever marketing trick\nto avoid fundamental change (Zizek, 2010). In elaborating on the paradoxes of\nsustainable consumption, Bryant and Goodman (2004) describe contrasting com-\nmodity cultures, namely, the Edenic myth-making culture used to assimilate con-\ncerns over tropical deforestation in the South and the consumption-intensive\nculture lifestyles in the North. Both are weakened as a form of social and political\n``caring at a distance'' owing to the uncritical acceptance of consumption as the\nprimary basis of action.\nSustainable consumption may have only marginal benefits:\nMany people will try a product that promises green benefits, but they will only make it\na routine part of their lives if it saves them money or time, increases their comfort, or\nconfers some kind of valued social status or recognition. On a more fundamental level,\npeople's everyday moral concerns are much more about other people in their imme-\ndiate social sphere than they are about the well-being of the planet or people in the\nIsenhour (2010) notes that contrary to the contemporary dominance of theories\nwhich link sustainable action to awareness, the most significant barrier to sustain-\nable lifestyles concerns conformity, equality, and fairness. Purchasing decisions are\nmade in part because of people's inherited or learned habits (e.g. children following\ntheir parents' consumption patterns), acquired habits (e.g. what consumers have\nbought before), beliefs and assumptions (e.g. that a product is good for their\nhealth), emotions (e.g. ``retail therapy''), social influences (e.g. what their peers\nbuy), and conformity to class expectations (e.g. products aimed to enhance one's\nthat responsible consumption is not necessarily about ``reducing consumption'' per\nse, but about making sure that the ``goods and services people buy, use and throw\naway'' consume fewer resources (p. 27). For a very small segment of Western\nconsumers, ethical consumption means not consuming anything socially or envir-\nonmentally damaging at all, as in the case of vegans. It is open to question how\n``responsible'' the majority of consumers are when they choose between what is\ncheap and what is ``right.''\nSignificantly, Miller (2001) noted that utopian fantasies about how much hap-\npier everyone would be if they gave up their cars and became vegetarians are not a\nsubstitute for sound public policy that will move the majority of society \u00ad not just a\ncommitted fringe \u00ad toward a less environmentally destructive society. It is the\nbusinesses and the governments that are the largest consumers, and individual\nconsumption decisions are insignificant in proportion. Thus, ``many consumption\ndecisions are not made by consumers at all, but by governments, regulatory agen-\ncies, and businesses'' (Wilk, 2009: 4). Focus on individual responsibility reflects the\ndominance of neoliberalism whereby governments delegate responsibility to con-\nsumers and thus avoid politically unpopular decisions that would limit\nconsumption (Hobson, 2002). While the focus on market-based solutions makes\npolitical sense, the current emphasis on lifestyle choices can be seen as a new\nmanifestation of the existing system and ultimately a strategy for the powerful to\nresist the regulation of resource-intensive, polluting, or socially damaging products\n(Isenhour, 2010: 457). Considering the growth of human population, the scope for\nde-coupling growth in production and consumption from environmental degrad-\nation is limited. If left to open market mechanisms, sustainable consumption is\nlikely to fail.\nOne of the most hopeful political mechanisms is consumer choice editing\nthat denies consumers the chance to buy non-sustainable goods (Blowfield,\n2013: 282). Whether companies' decisions to restrict consumer choice are taken\nas a result of economic calculation or consumer pressure, consumer choice editing\navoids the thorny issue of relying on individual good will. However, this\noption is rarely practiced in neoliberal democratic societies (Kopnina and\nAnother opportunity lies in the ``sharing economy'' and consumption of experi-\nences and services rather than ownership (Tennant et al., 2015). Consumers can now\naccess an expanding number of sites providing opportunities to share cars, rooms,\nitems, and tasks. Social sharing sites for goods and services and leasing companies\ncould alter the nature of consumption to the less material forms. Yet, keeping a\nproduct in use for longer implies that direct sales of new products decrease, impacting\nprofits that could otherwise be made (Tennant et al., 2015). Also, not everybody\nwants to share, and many items can simply not be shared.\nAnother opportunity for sustainable consumption lies in the kind of production\nsystem used. The new conception of the system of production design, in which\nwaste becomes impossible, is exemplified by the Circular Economy, Natural Step,\nand the Cradle to Cradle frameworks (Kopnina, 2011a; Kopnina and Blewitt,\nDespite all these hopeful frameworks, there is still concern about the pricing of\nsustainably produced goods and the question of whether sustainable choices can be\nmade available and affordable on the global scale. The challenge is to apply these\nframeworks, despite the current social constraints and political status quo. Since\nthe individual consumer's sphere of influence can be too small to initiate significant\nchange and many consumers may be simply unwilling to consider sustainable\noptions, efforts to encourage sustainable living depend on structural changes that\nrequire political and corporate leadership (Blowfield, 2013).\nIn essence, the fundamental question remains whether sustainable consumption\ncan be realized within the present market-based society and whether the WNF and\nAH cooperation does anything to address these challenges. The same debate can be\nobserved in the ENGO community, with some ENGOs opting for strategic collab-\noration with business in order to reach their sustainability goals while operating\nfrom within the system.\nStrategic cooperation between companies and ENGOs\nTraditionally, adversarial relations between business and ENGOs have given way\nto increasingly collaborative strategies, including corporate philanthropy, corpor-\nate foundations, licensing agreements, sponsorships, transaction-based promo-\ntions, joint issue promotions, and joint ventures (Wymer and Samu, 2003). The\nmotives for businesses to collaborate have been largely reputational (Bos et al.,\nMotives for ENGOs to collaborate also included goal achievement and funding\nVan Huijstee and Glasbergen, 2010a, b). Among others, advantages of collabor-\nation included more sustainable products and funding for environmental goals.\nSuch mutually beneficial collaboration can be exemplified by the joint effort of\nthe Dutch Rabobank and WNF to produce a climate-neutral credit card on the\nbasis of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in 2001. This collabor-\nation was the result of the combination of the rising importance of climate change\nas an issue, the intention of Rabobank's climate expert to develop a climate-neutral\nconsumer product, and the fact that consumers did not perceive the Rabobank as a\ncredible source of climate-related communication. All these factors strengthened\nthe rationale for promoting a climate-friendly consumer product alongside a cred-\nible organization such as WNF. This joint effort to stimulate green investment and\nissue bank cards with WNF logos was targeted to provide the Rabobank with a\nsymbolic (i.e. reputational) gain. WNF, on the other hand, gained recognition by\na wider audience, as well as some modest gains in climate change mitigation (Van\nHuijstee and Glasbergen, 2010a, b). ENGOs were seen to apply pressure to cor-\nporations by using shareholder activism (Gritten and Mola-Yudego, 2010), simul-\ntaneously increasing shareholders' loyalty to a corporation that was seen to\ncooperate with ENGOs, leading to mutual benefits.\nSome observers, however, have blamed ENGOs for ``selling out'' (Figure 1) and\nserving the interests of the elites (West, 2006). Risks of such cooperation included\nmarginalization of more critical and ambitious alternatives (Kopnina and Blewitt,\n2014; Van Huijstee et al., 2011). The use of the terms ``natural capital,'' ``natural\nresources,'' and ``ecosystem services,'' prominent in the rhetoric of corporations as\nwell as large ENGOs, is criticized for reducing complex natural and social\nphenomena into priced and thereby tradable commodities whose priced value\nis set from afar (Sullivan, 2009). ENGOs were blamed for siding with dominant\npolitical and corporate elites and instituting corporate conservation as the only\nnormative institution controlling both the environment and the local people (Igoe\net al., 2009). These criticisms have emphasized that far from curbing corporate\nefforts to increase economic growth and consumption and contrary to the desire to\nincrease environmental awareness, such cooperative ventures risk alienating envir-\nonmentally committed donors.\nOn the other hand, corporate leaders risk being seen as too soft and forgetting\nthe ``bottom line'' (profit) in the eyes of their shareholders (Van Huijstee et al.,\nReturning to the case of WWF and collaboration, WWF Global states that\nit establishes partnerships with companies ``to help change the way business is\ndone'' (http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/how_we_work/businesses/). Business\nEducation, through WWF's One Planet Leaders program, is listed as one of such\npartnership (http://www.oneplanetleaders.org/). We shall therefore address the\nissue of how EE fits within the objectives of WWF before returning to the case\nof Animal Cards.\nEE\nThe focus of EE has been moving in many different directions, starting with conser-\nvation education (e.g. Norris and Jacobson, 1998), education for deep ecology (e.g.\nLaChapelle, 1991), and progressively moving toward the more socially focused edu-\ncation for sustainable development (ESD) (e.g. Bonnett, 2003). While the earlier\nFigure 1. Selling out.\nGraffiti on the street, Amsterdam.\nforms of EE focused on negative human impact on the environment, arguing for the\nneed to recognize limits to growth and the need to curb the growth of human popu-\nlation and consumption, the late 1980s have been characterized by the aim of bal-\nancing economic, social, and ecological concerns (Stevenson, 2006). This turn away\nfrom concerns about environmental problems toward social inequality signifies a\nchange congruent with the dominant sustainable development rhetoric (Bonnett,\nexperiential education, has remained part of EE repertoire (e.g. Sandell and\nO\n\u00a8 hman, 2010), ESD has become an essential component of EE (Aarnio-\nMany NGOs saw their connection to EE and ESD as part of their strategy to\nachieve environmental awareness (Blum, 2009). Part of WWF's objective is to\neducate people about the need to live sustainably and address unsustainable con-\nsumption. Where does this leave the Animal Cards?\nCase study results\nThe reactions of both children and parents can be clustered into a number of\nthemes, based on cognitive (knowledge-related) and effective (emotional) reactions,\nranging from general appreciation or resentment of the promotion to nuanced\nviews on how they relate Animal Cards to issues associated with consumption,\nsustainability, and concrete opinions about AH and WNF.\nChildren\nObservation of the children's behavior is exemplified by the vignette provided at\nthe beginning of this article. Segment 1 illustrates the response of a 7-year-old girl\nZoe explaining her reasons for trading (Figure 2):\nSegment 1.\nZoe: First, mum didn't want to go to Albert Heijn, but I asked whether we could go\nfor cards because my friends already had cards . . .\nResearcher: But why did you want Animal Cards?\nZoe: They are beautiful! And you learn a lot about animals!\nResearcher: What kind of things do you learn about animals?\nZoe: Oh lots of . . . that some animals are very quick . . . some can fly very far, others\nspend winters at home . . . Birds and such are also animals. Oh yeah, many animals are\nin danger . . . [hesitates, long pause]\nResearcher: Endangered?\nZoe: Yeah, endangered! Mum read about it in the album!\nResearcher: Does the album explain what animals are endangered?\nZoe: Yes! But I forgot . . .\nResearcher: Does the album explain why they are endangered?\nZoe: Oh because they are eaten and so . . . other animals eat them . . . [hesitates, looks\nhopefully at the researcher for help, when the researcher does not respond, adds\nbrightly] But many animals can be saved, and we can help!\nIt must be noted that not all children participated in the card sharing or trading\nactivities nor did all the children show interest in the Animal Cards promotion. The\nresearcher has followed those children who were engaged with the cards, although\na few significant observations were made by children who were not engaged in such\nactivities. Those children who were not engaged in exchanges were observed to join\ntheir parents and guardians and leave the school premises or to occupy areas of\nthe playground where the card trading was not taking place. While the\nresearcher mostly engaged in conversations with card trading children, two\nextracts from conversation with the non-trading children are significant as\nthey exemplify the reasons why some children liked to trade or not to engage in\ntrading:\nSegment 2.\nResearcher (talking to two non-trading girls Carla and Mila, both aged 8): So, you\ngirls don't trade Animal Cards?\nCarla: Naaa . . .\nFigure 2. Animal Cards.\nMila: I got cards from last year! Mum says we have no place to put them . . .\nResearcher (to Carla): Do you also have cards from last year?\nCarla: Not really . . .\nMila: She doesn't like them!\nResearcher (to Carla): Why not?\nCarla: Ahhhh . . . I don't know . . .\nMila: Her parents don't buy them . . . don't get them for her . . .\nResearcher (to Carla): Really? (to Mila): Can Carla answer herself? (Mila nods\nreluctantly)\nCarla: I don't know . . . Mum doesn't like them, I guess.\nResearcher: What about yourself?\nCarla: Ahhh . . . They are nice. But I don't really need them.\nMila: You can share mine!\nCarla: You don't have any . . . new ones.\nMila: Well, last year they were more fun. I got a whole book of them!\nResearcher (to both girls): So, what's the difference between this year's cards and last\nyear's?\nMila: There's a lot of . . . writing . . . on new ones . . . I just like the pictures! I like the\nfunny animals, and this year they write stuff about . . . I don't know . . . I guess they are\ntrying to teach us about animals . . .\nResearcher: Who is ``they''?\nMila: Albert Heijn! If you buy stuff in the store they want you to learn about\nanimals . . . We are learning about animals at school too!\nSegment 3.\nResearcher (talking to a non-trading boy Hans aged 9): How come you are not trading?\nHans: Animal Cards are for babies . . .\nResearcher: Why is that?\nHans: They like to collect stuff. I don't need these cards. I collect mini-bikes. My\nfather has a big collection too . . .\nResearcher: So, you think only young children are interested in Animal Cards?\nHans: Naaa . . . It's just that I know all this stuff . . . About animals . . . Albert Heijn\nmakes those cards every year. We have books about animals at home . . .\nResearcher: Do you like to learn about animals?\nHans: Sure! But I'd rather go to the zoo . . .\nResearcher: Do you think it's a good idea that you get Animal Cards when you do\nshopping?\nHans (stares, thinks for a while): I don't know . . . It's kinda weird that you get them\n[cards] at the supermarket . . . I guess they want to have more . . . eh . . . people in the\nstore. They have more . . . things that they give away when you shop.\nIt seems from these two segments that the children do not perceive the link between\nthe cards and WNF, thinking that it is AH that produces them. The children are\naware of the fact that this is not the first year that the cards have been produced\nand that there are more promotional activities that AH engages in. Although they\ndo perceive an educational value in ``learning about animals,'' they acknowledge\nthat they get their information elsewhere (at school or from books about animals\nat home).\nParents\nAs illustrated by the vignette preceding the ``Introduction'' section, parents'\ninvolvement with Animal Cards was through their children, but as one father\nacknowledged it in the segment below, the children's association with Animal\nCards was also through the parents:\nSegment 4.\nFather of a 7-year-old son (F7S) (talking to the researcher): The funny thing is, we [me\nand my wife] started this madness . . . Max, my son, would not let us do the shopping\nwithout hanging on our arm, but we were the ones who started this\ncollection . . . Maybe if he was the one with the money, he would have gone to another\nstore . . .\nResearcher: Why do you refer to the collection [of Animal Cards] as madness?\nF7S: Ah (laughs) t's just this whole exchange out there (points to the trading\nchildren, then pauses thoughtfully) . . . But I think it's actually a good idea, it\nteaches them [the children] to cooperate, to share . . . Also it taught Max some\nresponsibility: we told him in the store [Albert Hein] that we are not going to\nspend 10 euros on shopping any time he wanted more Animal Cards, and that he\nhad to figure out what we really needed to buy \u00ad and no ice-creams! \u00ad what we\nreally needed in the house . . . and if it added up to 10 euros or above \u00ad sure, he\ncould have the cards . . .\nResearcher: So Max learned to be a more responsible shopper?\nF7S: Yeah, and note what costs what, what deals there are, as well as think about\nwhat is already in the fridge and what we still need.\nResearcher: And what about the cards? What do you think, is this a good promotion?\nF7S (sounds a bit hesitant): Yeah, well . . . I don't know what they are really\npromoting . . .\nResearcher: Albert Hein or WNF?\nF7S: Was it WNF? I didn't know that . . . (looks through the cards his son has stuffed\nin his pocket) . . . Aha, the panda! I guess they want to promote their cause . . .\nResearcher: Do you think it's working . . . with kids?\nF7S: Promoting cause with kids? I don't know . . . I think Max is too young for\nit . . . But maybe this is meant as educational . . .\nThe intention of the promotion and cooperation between AH and WNF was\ndiscussed by two mothers in Segment 5:\nSegment 5.\nMother 1: I think Albert Hein's making some extra money on this! Everybody's\nshopping for over 10 euros, just to get these cards . . . I also got them, because every-\nbody has them, but then I thought: what am I doing?\nMother 2: I don't think anybody really buys extra . . . You know, a year ago there were\nthese footballers cards, then there were the Sesame street toys, or Disney toys, there's\nalways something . . . It's not very transparent how this works, I think . . . I don't think\nanybody always buys more to collect everything . . .\nMother 1: My son loved the football cards! He is still mad about the\nplayers . . . I wonder whether FIFA [football organization] or whoever was also\nparticipating? . . .\nMother 2: I guess so! I think they like stunts, partnering with some big\norganizations . . . Albert Heijn is probably the biggest with these co-operations!\nMother 1: They are like H&M [chain retail store] working with famous designers!\nMother 2: I think these Animal Cards are different though, they have this big thing\nwith WNF . . .\nMother 1: Oh?\nMother 2: Yeah, you know, they work with stores to have more sustainable\nproducts . . . (Turns to the researcher who until now was passively listening in) You\nwere just asking somebody about it, right?\nResearcher: Yeah, I am curious about what this Animal Cards promotion is\nabout . . . So, how do they participate in making these sustainable products, Albert\nHeijn and WNF?\nMother 2: I think when an NGO puts its logo on the product, like with Fair Trade,\nboth the farmers \u00ad or the environment \u00ad profit because the NGO controls how the\nproduct is made . . .\nResearcher: And with these Animal Cards?\nMother 2 (shrugs, turns to Mother 1): I don't know . . . Maybe they use part of the\nproceeds to reinvest in some jungle-saving actions . . . Do you have an idea? (Mother 1\nappears blank) I guess it's on their website . . .\nReflection: Linking literature to the case\nThe vignette and segments above illustrate some of the impressions of how children\nand parents perceive Animal Cards as well as some larger issues connected to the\npromotions, cooperation, environment, and consumption. Linking three strands of\nthe literature, we may reflect on the ideological tensions and management's co-\noption of consumer concern, as discussed by Jose\nthe Whole Foods Market. Organic produce is commonly distributed by trans-\ncontinental and global commodity chains to disparate market niches, involving\nunsustainable transportation, which is in direct contrast to the original aspirations\nof the organics movement (Johnston et al., 2009). Consumers seek social trans-\nformation within the constraints of neoliberal regulatory regimes, and corporate-\norganic marketing constitutes a hybridized identity that interacts with political\nopportunities (Johnston et al., 2009). This hybrid identity involves both consent\nto consume and, in the very act of consumption, buying ``redemption'' from the\n``sin of consumption'' (Zizek, 2010). Remarkably, the educational value of Animal\nCards seems to be disconnected from these acts of consumption. Consumption and\nsustainability are not necessarily consciously linked to each other by either children\nor their parents. While the parents perceived the continuity between their act of\nshopping and children's satisfaction, the children perceived possession of certain\ncards as a desired good and means of enhancing social contacts (through\nexchange).\nShopping was directly related to the promotion, causing some resentment\nas it was linked to financial pressures (having to spend 10 euros on shopping to\nget the cards) or social pressures (children sometimes insisted on parents doing\nshopping to get cards, or parents wanted to get cards themselves because others got\nthem, etc.). Sustainability was only mentioned in connection to the sponsor of the\nAnimal Cards, WNF, which was recognized by some parents as sustainability-\nrelated.\nStrategic cooperation between companies and ENGOs did not occupy the chil-\ndren at their age. This cooperation did elicit some parental responses, particularly\nrationalizing this cooperation in terms of mutual benefit. The parents were not\naware of the nature of this benefit and, as one reflected, felt that the results of this\ncooperation were not made transparent. However, the cooperation was not further\ndisputed.\nThe literature about collaborations between NGOs and commercial organiza-\nStafford, 1997; Shah, 2011) as well as that on shareholder activism (Gritten and\nMola-Yudego, 2010), indicates that such alliances can help to simultaneously\nincrease shareholders' loyalty to commercial companies and to increase main-\nstream acceptance of the work of ENGOs, leading to mutual benefits. While it is\nclear from this case that the partnership exemplifies a strategy for integrating cor-\nporate environmental responsibilities with market goals, environmental values\ntransferred to the consumers in the process remain ambiguous. If we assume\nthat such alliances are an outgrowth of the ``Market-based Environmentalism''\nwhich advocates making ecology attractive to businesses through market incentives\n(Hartman and Stafford, 1997), the environmental awareness of the consumers\nmight not reach beyond the commercial interests such as shopping discounts.\nThe motives for AH/WNF and consumer alliances seem to be manipulated by\nthe market-based environmentalism.\nThe educational effects of Animal Cards, such as knowledge of animals and\ntrading skills, were appreciated by children and parents. However, the educational\nvalue of linking animals to the availability of sustainable products in AH or the\npurported intention of WWF to educate consumers about animals through the very\nact of consumption remains open to doubt. Bryant and Goodman (2004) have\ndiscussed how values like conservation are marketed, arguing that green consump-\ntion is a form of narrative that stimulates even more consumption. Educators who\nincreasingly came to treat neoliberal education with suspicion (Jickling, 2005;\nStevenson, 2006) could see how these manipulative forms of sustainability inter-\ntwine with the work of ENGOs and the narratives of corporate sustainability.\nMoreover, the literature about consumption as an essential part of education for\nstrates the need to highlight consumption as one of the key areas of education\nfor sustainability.\nLimitations of the case\nPrevious studies of the environmental attitudes of Dutch upper elementary school\nthat the environmental attitudes are not always consistent across generational or\nsocio-economic boundaries. For example, it appeared that children from the well-\nto-do families with parents who own at least one car exhibited more environmental\nawareness than children from the lower social status families whose parents did not\nhave cars. While this supports the post-material values hypothesis that postulates\nthat the underprivileged groups cannot ``afford'' environmental care, the evidence\nalso showed that while the wealthier families were more aware, their consumption\npatterns were far from sustainable.\nThis study focused on the rather homogeneous sample of predominantly ethnic\nDutch middle-class income families, providing generational comparison only.\nFollow-up research could focus on a more stratified sample and involve children\nand parents from different socio-economic backgrounds.\nConclusion\nThe relationship between NGOs and commercial companies is a developing one,\nand we have much to learn about it, particularly from consumer culture and sus-\ntainability perspectives. This case of Animal Cards and the literature involving\nsustainability, consumption and strategic cooperation reveals the tension between\nthe effort to foster environmental protection on the one hand and to address con-\nsumption on the other hand. Cross-sector partnerships have the potential to lead to\nimprovements in corporate social responsibility and environmental awareness\namong consumers, for example, by making the children more aware of biodiversity.\nHowever, negative trade-offs of the animal card promotion become apparent when\nconsumption of all kinds of products in the supermarket is rewarded by the same\ncards. As observed by some of the parents from the case study of Animal Cards,\nthis promotion has possibly stimulated increased consumption. Judging from this\ncase, the effort has not led to questioning the connection between one of the largest\nthreats to environmental sustainability \u00ad Western-style consumption \u00ad that may be\nindirectly threatening the habitats of the animals portrayed on the Animal Cards.\nWhile it might not have been the WWF's intention to link consumption to sus-\ntainability, promoting Animal Cards through the very act of consumption and\nplacing Animal Cards within the larger educational strategy do seem ironic. This\ncase study also raises questions about effectiveness of such partnerships in terms of\nsustainable development and thus strategic considerations for ENGOs with their\ncollaborative strategy.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication\nof this article.\nReferences\nAarnio-Linnanvuori EI (2013) Defining EE and ESD.
