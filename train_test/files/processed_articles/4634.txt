    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this study was to examine body image discrepancies in elementary-age children in a racially diverse sample.\nBody image and body image discrepancy were measured in elementary school children (N = 58) of various racial groups (35%\nHispanic, 33% African American, 16% Caucasian, 14% other). Each participant was shown a set of silhouette figure drawings\nand reported current and ideal body sizes. Children's body discrepancies appear to change between Grades 1 and 2. Notable\ndiscrepancies between their current and ideal figures, and their current figure and those that they believe are most attractive,\nare largely absent in Grade 1, but are evident in Grade 2 and older children. No substantive racial or gender differences in\nbody image perceptions or dissatisfaction were observed in this sample. Body image dissatisfaction may begin as early as\nsecond grade in both girls and boys of various racial and ethnic backgrounds.These findings provide preliminary evidence that\nbody discrepancies may begin much earlier than previously thought.\n",

Recent studies have examined the develop-\nment of body image dissatisfaction in young children, as it\nmay be a risk factor for the onset of unhealthy eating behav-\niors later on in life (e.g., eating disorders, obesity; Levine &\nSmolak, 2005). Body dissatisfaction has been defined as dis-\npleasure with some aspect of one's appearance (Rosen,\n1992), which can occur when perceptions of one's physical\nattributes do not match the characteristics one would like to\npossess (i.e., body image discrepancies). Evidence suggests\nthat children as young as 8 years report wanting to be thinner\nthan their current body sizes, wishing they weighed less, and\nhaving tried dieting (Jung & Peterson, 2007; Robinson,\nChang, Haydel, & Killen, 2001). These data suggest that\neven young children may be dissatisfied with their bodies.\nAs such, pediatric health care providers, health educators,\nand parents should be aware of children's concerns; increased\nawareness may improve the early identification of poten-\ntially problematic body preoccupation and eating behaviors,\nand allow for the utilization of early prevention and\nintervention.\nChildren learn social norms associated with physical\nattractiveness at a young age. Children as young as 7 years\nreported that obese children have fewer friends, are lazier,\nand are less attractive than nonobese children, whereas they\ndescribed their thinner peers as more likable, friendlier, and\nmore polite (Kostanski & Gullone, 1999). Children also\nreport wanting to be thinner than their actual body sizes,\nwishing they weighed less, and having tried dieting (Rolland,\nFarnill, & Griffiths, 1997). Therefore, it is not surprising that\neven young children may be dissatisfied with their bodies.\nBody image dissatisfaction increases with age for all chil-\ndren, though girls report higher levels of dissatisfaction, more\nconcerns about dieting, and greater preoccupation with their\nweight than boys do (Gardner, Sorter, & Friedman, 1997;\nLowes & Tiggemann, 2003; Phares, Steinberg, & Thompson,\nences in body image dissatisfaction have been found for chil-\ndren as young as 8 years, but such differences appear to be\ninconsistent or absent in younger children (Gardner et al.,\n1Pennsylvania State University, University Park, USA\n2Syracuse University, NY, USA\n3Neuropsychiatric Research Institute, Fargo, ND, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJoshua M.

Most research on body image among\nchildren utilizes Caucasian samples, with the few studies of\nbody image in children of different racial groups producing\ninconsistent results (Edwards George & Franko, 2010). For\nexample, some studies suggested that Caucasian children\nhave more body image discrepancies than other racial groups\n(Lawrence & Thelen, 1995; Thompson, Corwin, & Sargent,\n1997), whereas others show children from various ethnic\ngroups (e.g., Caucasians, Hispanics, African Americans,\nAsians) experience body discrepancies at similar rates\nsometimes conflicting literature on racial and ethnic differ-\nences in body image suggests the need for studies that con-\ntinue to utilize diverse samples. Furthermore, research on\nrace effects are typically conducted with children in middle-\nto-later childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood (e.g.,\nRoberts, Cash, Feingold, & Johnson, 2006), which has led\nresearchers to call for the inclusion of minority groups in\nstudies of body image and disordered eating in young children\nAdditional studies clarifying the developmental timing of\nbody image dissatisfaction in children of various racial back-\ngrounds are needed. In a sample of racially diverse elemen-\ntary school children, the present study cross-sectionally\nassessed body image perceptions and discrepancies, as a\nmeasure of body dissatisfaction. This study addressed three\nprimary questions: (a) \"Do older children report larger (fat-\nter) body images and discrepancies than younger children?\"\nIt was hypothesized that older children would select larger\nbody figures and report a larger discrepancy than younger\nchildren. (b) \"Do children of diverse racial backgrounds\nreport different levels of body image perception and discrep-\nancy?\" No predictions about how racial groups may differ\nwere made because previous research is inconsistent on this\npoint. (c) \"Do boys and girls in kindergarten through third\ngrade experience similar levels of body image discrepancy?\"\nPrevious research suggests gender differences are apparent\nbeginning at about age 8, but there is more inconsistent evi-\ndence in children younger than 8 (e.g., Gardner et al., 1997;\nwas hypothesized that younger boys and girls would report\nmore similar body image perceptions and discrepancies, and\nthat gender differences would not emerge until about Grade\n2 (approximately age 8).\nMethod\nParticipants\nfrom urban elementary schools (kindergarten [K] to third\ngrade) were recruited to participate in this study. They were\nfrom diverse ethnic backgrounds: 35% Hispanic (n = 20),\nand 14% \"other\" races, including mixed race (n = 8). Two\nchildren did not report their race.\nMeasures\nDemographics. Each child reported age, gender (boy/girl),\nand race. Race was selected from Caucasian, African Ameri-\ncan, Asian, Hispanic, or \"other\" (including mixed race).\nFigure Rating Scale. This measure consists of seven gender-\nspecific line drawings of increasing size, labeled from 1\n(thinnest figure) to 7 (thickest/heaviest figure; Collins,\n1991). Separate sets of figures corresponding to participant\ngender were used for boys and girls. Respondents selected\nfigures that represent current body size and variations of\nideal body type. Discrepancy scores are calculated as the dif-\nference between current and ideal body types and are inter-\npreted as measures of body dissatisfaction (Fallon & Rozin,\n1985). Research shows young children of various racial\nbackgrounds can reliably complete this measure, and in a\nsample of more than 1,000 first to third graders, a test\u00adretest\nreliability of r = .71 was demonstrated (Collins, 1991). This\nFigure Rating Scale measure was selected because it is one\nof the few measures that was developed specifically for chil-\ndren that assesses self-reported body discrepancies without\nrequiring extensive child interviews. Previous studies have\nfound that children with larger body mass indexes (BMIs) or\nheavier weights select larger current figures, suggesting they\nare able to provide valid ratings of their current body figure\nGriffiths, 1996). This effect does not vary by age, suggesting\nchildren as young as 5 years can accurately select appropri-\nate figures (Williamson & Delin, 2001). The concurrent\nvalidity for this measure has been demonstrated, with larger\ndiscrepancies correlating with more dieting behavior\n(Kostanski & Gullone, 1999) and lower self-esteem (Tigge-\nmann & Wilson-Barrett, 1998) in children.\nProcedure\nThe university's institutional review board and the elemen-\ntary school administration approved this research. Informed\nconsent was obtained from participants' parents, and assent\nwas received from the children. During school hours,\nresearch staff visited the children's classrooms. The children\nindividually met with researchers and completed the demo-\ngraphics questionnaire and Figure Rating Scale, and research\nstaff recorded participants' responses. On the Figure Rating\nScale, participants pointed to the figure they most looked\nlike (current body image), wanted to look like (ideal body\nimage), felt like (feel body image), and thought the opposite\nsex would find attractive (i.e., what a boy/girl would think\nwas pretty/good looking; attractive body image). On com-\npletion of these measures, all children were thanked for their\nparticipation and returned to their class.\nHeron et al. 3\nGeneral Analytic Approach\nA MANOVA was used to appropriately handle the high\ndegree of relatedness among the body image variables and to\nreduce the likelihood of Type I error that would result from\nconducting numerous univariate statistical tests (Tabachnick\n& Fidell, 2007). Two sets of MANOVA models were used,\nand all analyses were conducted in the SPSS statistical pack-\nage. In the first set of MANOVAs, the dependent variables\nwere the four body image perception measures (current,\nideal, feel, and attractive body image ratings), and in the\nsecond set, the dependent variables were the three body\nimage discrepancy scores (ideal-current, feel-current, attrac-\ntive-current). The independent variables were grade, race,\nand the Gender \u00d7 Grade interaction. Wilks's Lambda crite-\nrion was used for all analyses, and significant multivariate\nomnibus tests were followed up with univariate testing for\nindividual dependent variables (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007).\nA p value of .05 was used for significance testing. This ana-\nlytic approach provides information regarding whether chil-\ndren's grade (as proxy for age), race, and gender influenced\ntheir overall body image perceptions (across the four depen-\ndent variables: current, ideal, feel, and attractiveness ratings)\nand/or discrepancy scores (across three dependent variables:\nideal-current, feel-current, attractive-current discrepancies).\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nMean ratings corresponding to the four Figure Rating Scale\nquestions were calculated by the child's grade. These four\nitems (current, ideal, feel, and attractive) are measures of\nbody image self-perception, and three body image discrepancy\nscores were then calculated from these perception ratings--\nideal minus current, feel minus current, and attractive minus\ncurrent--and provide an index of body image discrepancy\nor dissatisfaction. Descriptive statistics for body image per-\nception scores (current, ideal, feel, attractive) and discrep-\nancy scores (ideal-current, feel-current, attractive-current)\nare presented in Table 1 by grade level and in Table 2 by\nrace. The mean perception scores (current, ideal, feel, attrac-\ntive) reflect the average figure children selected (on a 1-7\nscale), with smaller numbers reflecting thinner figures. The\nmean discrepancies are difference scores between children's\nratings of their current figure and the ideal, feel, and attrac-\ntive figure ratings; negative discrepancies suggest a desire to\nbe thinner, and positive discrepancy scores indicate a desire\nto be larger. All participants did not provide fully usable data\nfor each question; the actual number of children included for\neach body image self-perception item and discrepancy is\nindicated in Table 1.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics of Reported Body Image Self-Perceptions and Discrepancies by Grade Level\nCurrent Ideal Feel Attractive Ideal-current Feel-current\nAttractive-\ncurrent\nNote:All = all students Grades K-3; ideal-current = ideal image rating minus current image; feel-current = feel image minus current image; attractive-\ncurrent = attractive body image minus current image.\nTable 2. Descriptive Statistics of Reported Body Image Self-Perceptions and Discrepancies by Race\nCurrent Ideal Feel Attractive\nIdeal-\ncurrent Feel-current\nAttractive-\ncurrent\nNote: Ideal-current = ideal image rating minus current image; feel-current = feel image minus current image; attractive-current = attractive body image\nminus current image.\n4 SAGE Open\nHypothesisTesting\nThe effect of grade, race, and the Gender \u00d7 Grade interaction\non body image perceptions and discrepancies were evaluated\nto address the three hypotheses. The MANOVA analysis\nrevealed a significant multivariate omnibus effect of grade on\n2 = .37, but not on body image discrepancies,  = .78,\nbody image perceptions was significant, the multivariate\nanalyses were followed up with univariate analyses of the\nindividual dependent variables. There was a significant effect\n2.44, p = .08. These results suggest that--using a continuous\ngrade variable--older children reported larger current body\nfigures and thought the other sex would find larger figures\nmore attractive, but grade had no overall effect on children's\nideal or feel figures, or body image discrepancy.\nThe mean discrepancy score ratings in Table 1 suggest\nthat a change in body image perceptions may occur between\nGrades 1 and 2 because the ideal-current discrepancy goes\nfrom 0.80 (indicating children want to be larger than their\ncurrent figure) to -0.38 (suggesting they want to be thinner).\nTo explore this relationship further, post hoc analyses with a\nrecoded grade variable were conducted, comparing children\nin Grades K and 1 to Grades 2 and 3. Table 3 presents the\nmeans and standard deviations for the self-perception and\ndiscrepancy scores. Independent sample t tests were used to\nevaluate for differences in ratings between younger (Grades\nK-1) and older children (Grades 2-3). As is presented in\nTable 3, older children selected large current body figures,\nreported they felt larger, and thought the opposite sex would\nfind larger figures more attractive than younger children;\nthere were no significant differences in older and younger\nchildren's ratings of their ideal figure. Regarding the body\nimage discrepancy scores, results showed children in Grades\n2 and 3 wanted to be significantly thinner than their current\n(ideal-current discrepancy) and thought the opposite sex pre-\nferred thinner bodies (attractive-current discrepancy) than\ndid children in Grades K and 1. These data provide evidence\nthat in this diverse sample, body image discrepancy, or dis-\nsatisfaction, may emerge between Grades 1 and 2 (or approx-\nimately around age 8).\nThe second question this study aimed to address was\nwhether racial background differentially influenced body\nimage perceptions or discrepancy. No specific predictions\nabout whether children from different racial backgrounds\nperceive their bodies or discrepancies differently were made\nbecause of limited and inconsistent findings from previous\nresearch.\nResults of the multivariate omnibus test showed that there\nsample, children of all races perceived their bodies and dis-\ncrepancies in similar manners.\nFinally, this study examined whether there was a Gender \u00d7\nGrade interaction. Based on previous research, it was expected\nthat younger boys and girls would report similar body image\nperception, but that discrepancy and gender differences\nwould emerge after approximately age 8, with girls showing\nlarger discrepancies than boys (i.e., an interaction of grade\nand gender). The results did not confirm this prediction; the\nomnibus multivariate test was nonsignificant for both body\nThese results suggest that boys' and girls' body image devel-\nopment show similar trajectories in this diverse sample.\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study was to examine body image discrep-\nancy in a young, ethnically diverse sample of children. It is\nimportant to describe body image and body image discrep-\nancy in children at a young age to provide a better under-\nstanding of the ways in which children's early distortions in\nTable 3.

Although\nthis study used a relatively small sample of young children,\nthe findings are generally consistent with previous research\nexamining body image concerns in older, less ethnically\ndiverse samples (Jung & Peterson, 2007; Robinson et al.,\nevidence that body discrepancies may develop at a very\nyoung age, highlighting the importance of considering body\nimage concerns in children in both research and practice.\nThere is consistent evidence indicating that body dissatis-\nfaction in older children (at least 11 years old) is a risk factor\nfor the development of eating problems (Levine & Smolak,\n2005), and the present findings suggest that dissatisfaction\nmay develop at a much younger age. In particular, the direc-\ntion of body image discrepancy effects were different in\nyounger and older children, suggesting a desire to be heavier\n(bigger) early in grade school (Grades K-1) and thinner later\nin grade school (Grades 2-3). One possible explanation for\nthis difference is that during middle and later childhood,\nsociocultural factors (e.g., media, peers, parents) have been\nshown to affect children's body image perceptions and satis-\nfaction (see Levine & Smolak, 2005, for a review of socio-\ncultural influences on body image). For instance, in children\nas young as 9, appearance-related media exposure and peer\nconversations have been shown to be negatively associated\nwith body esteem and body dissatisfaction (Clark &\nTiggemann, 2007). It is less clear whether and how sociocul-\ntural factors influence younger children, although there is\nsome recent evidence that appearance messages from the\nmedia and peers may not affect very young children (ages\ntion for the present findings is speculative, it suggests that\nfuture research examining the influence of sociocultural fac-\ntors on body perceptions and discrepancies in young children\nis warranted. The findings from such studies could help to\nelucidate the role of sociocultural factors and, in particular,\ndetermine the age at which these factors begin to influence\nchildren's body image perceptions and discrepancies, and\nmay affect the risk trajectory for subsequent psychological\nor physical health conditions.\nThe racial diversity of the current study's sample allowed\nfor a preliminary examination of racial differences in body\nimage. Previous research suggests that Caucasian children\nwant to be thinner (Lawrence & Thelen, 1995) and that\nAfrican American children want to be heavier (Thompson et\nal., 1997). In the present sample, which was composed pri-\nmarily of Hispanic and African American children, no racial\ndifferences were seen. Although racial differences in the\ndesire for thinness may be evident later in childhood, at a\nvery young age, this may not be the case. This study provides\npreliminary evidence that, in young children, body image\nconcerns may be relevant for racial groups (e.g., African\nAmerican) that were not previously considered prone to\nbody image dissatisfaction. As such, the demographic fac-\ntors associated with higher levels of body image dissatisfac-\ntion in older children and adults (e.g., Caucasian, female,\nadolescent) may have more limited applicability in very\nyoung children. As was demonstrated in the present study,\nbody image concerns are beginning to present in younger\nboys and girls from diverse backgrounds than previously\nthought, and this issue clearly warrants future research\nattention.\nAlthough the findings of the present studies are prelimi-\nnary, they do provide initial evidence that body image dis-\ncrepancies can be detected in children at a young age and\nthus there may be opportunity for intervention. An associa-\ntion between body image discrepancy and psychological\nwell-being has been demonstrated in adolescents and adults\n(Stice, 2002), however, considerably fewer studies have\nexamined this issue in young children. Identifying and pro-\nviding intervention for children who experience body dis-\ncrepancies may provide an opportunity to prevent or mitigate\nmore serious behavioral (e.g., unhealthy eating behaviors),\npsychological (e.g., eating disorders, mood disorders), or\nhealth issues (e.g., obesity), which are known to be associ-\nated with body image concerns (Stice, 2002; Xanthopoulos\nDespite the important contributions of this study, includ-\ning the use of very young children and a racially diverse\nsample, as with any study, there are limitations. First, this\nwas a preliminary research study using a relatively small\nsample of young children. Although the findings are gener-\nally consistent with previous studies using less diverse sam-\nples, it is possible that some effects--particularly regarding\nracial and gender differences--were not detected due to the\nsmall sample size. This was a pilot study and thus general-\nizing to larger populations should be done with great caution.\nSecond, this study used a child figure drawing measure for\nthe assessment of body image discrepancies. Criticism in the\nliterature regarding the reliability of these measures in chil-\ndren under the age of eight have led to the suggestion that\nthey should not be used (Smolak, 2004). However, empirical\nwork has also demonstrated that children as young as six can\naccurately report on their health and well-being if the mea-\nsure is appropriately adapted and simple questions are used\n(Forrest, Riley, Vivier, Gordon, & Starfield, 2004). The mea-\nsure used in the present study asked children four short ques-\ntions (e.g., \"Which drawing looks the most like your body\nnow?\") in an attempt to make the questionnaire administra-\ntion as simple and straightforward as possible. Furthermore,\nin the present study, older children selected larger current\nfigures than younger children, and previous research has\ndemonstrated that children with larger BMIs or heavier\nweights select larger current figures (Collins, 1991;\nleast in part) that they understand the appropriate use of this\nmeasure. Importantly, this study should be viewed as pre-\nliminary work that encourages future research addressing the\n6 SAGE Open\nissue of body image dissatisfaction in young children, and\nthe resulting psychological and health concerns.\nThis study adds to the growing literature that body image\nperceptions and discrepancies can develop at a young age in\nboth boys and girls in a diverse sample of children. However,\nas has been noted throughout, the present findings are pre-\nliminary work and should ideally be used to encourage addi-\ntional research on this important topic. Future research\nshould include prospective evaluations of the relationship\nbetween body image discrepancies, dissatisfaction, psycho-\nlogical well-being (e.g., self-esteem, depression, anxiety),\ndevelopmental processes (e.g., physical maturation), and\nphysical health (e.g., eating/exercise habits, appropriate\ngrowth) in young children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nClark, L., & Tiggemann, M.
