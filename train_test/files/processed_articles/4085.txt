    "abstract": "Abstract. This paper presents a review and interpretation of the apparent inertia and resistance to\nchange that has characterised the last twenty-five years of UK policing. We argue that attempts\nto introduce New Public Management to policing have not proved as effective as in other public\nservices. Most of the activities of the police have explicitly spatial consequences yet, we argue, the\nslow diffusion and adoption of geographic information systems (GIS) and other technical innovations\nhas been a particular issue. The current round of political aspirations to reform policing depend in\nlarge part on a rapid increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of police management information\nsystems and their deployment at strategic and tactical levels. Generic opportunities and constraints\narising in the field of geographic information science are identified and summarised followed by a\ncritical appreciation of current GIS deployment in policing. Direct practical experience in GIS\npolicing applications is used to outline observed barriers to progress and also forms the basis for a\nnumber of strategic recommendations.\nElsewhere, we have suggested that constabulary discretion tends to disable senior line\nmanagers' attempts to initiate change and to control the quality of outputs (Irving and\nAs a prologue to the Thatcher public service marketisation and privatisation reform\nprogramme (Ascher, 1987), there was a relentless build up of official criticisms of the\nquality of policing. Sir Robert Mark's battle against corruption in the Metropolitan\nPolice (Cox et al, 1977) was followed by exposure of dubious CID methods in the\nMaxwell Confait murder investigation (Fisher, 1977). By then, such a body of evidence\nabout police malpractice had accumulated that a Royal Commission was inevitable.\nThe Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure's report (1980), the first to be based\nextensively on empirical research, revealed unacceptable practices, poor management,\nand ineffective administrative procedures.\nThe litany of bad news continued with Lord Scarman's report on the Brixton riots\n(1981) which criticised Metropolitan Police management for its unjust and heavy-\nhanded approach to the community. Two years later, the Policy Studies Institute's\nclassic study of the policing of London (Smith et al, 1983) confirmed and elaborated\nmany of Scarman's judgments.\nConstructive responses to this very public stream of bad news flowed from two\nsources: the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 created a new legislative frame-\nwork for managing and controlling criminal investigation. However, it was the\nMetropolitan Police itself, under Sir Kenneth Newman, that initiated the police\nservice's own comprehensive management-reform process. Newman also continued\nto support the Neighbourhood Policing Experiment that he had inherited from his\npredecessor, Sir David McNee, and which had been the most immediate product of\nScarman's criticisms (Irving et al, 1989). This experiment, designed for and by police\nofficers (Beckett and Hart, 1981), sought to achieve exactly the kind of localism\nand devolution of operational strategy making that now sits at the core of the\nNewman's corporate planning and performance-management system foreshadowed\nNeither Sir Kenneth Newman nor his successor, Sir Peter (later Lord) Imbert,\ncould make any impact on the rising crime rate (Home Office, 1993a; Mirrlees-Black\net al, 1996). Meanwhile, successive Home Secretaries (Kenneth Baker and Ken Clarke)\nsufficient ways of interpreting crime rates through the late 1980s and early 1990s to give\nammunition to most political agendas, and certainly they could be presented to make\npolice reform look essential.\nSir Patrick Sheehy's (1993) report on police responsibilities and rewards was\nintended to pave the way for the NPM reform programme by removing inflexibil-\nity in police organisational structures, rules, and procedures. The Police Reform\nWhite Paper (Home Office, 1993b) assumes successful implementation of Sheehy's\nrecommendations. In fact, concerted and effective resistance from the service left the\npolice virtually unaffected (McLaughlin and Murji, 1993). Twin investigations of police\nroles and responsibilities, one from the Home Office (Posen, 1994), one indepen-\ndent (Police Foundation and Policy Studies Institute, 1994), briefly raised the issue of\nprivatisation, a stalwart of Thatcherite NPM (Walsh, 1995), but without any immediate\neffect.\nThe Police Reform White paper of 1993 laid out no real plans for setting, much\nless achieving, goals. Sheehy's 232 recommendations might have produced a new era\nin police management if they had not been so strenuously resisted (Caines, 1994).\n160 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley\nThe Police and Magistrates Courts Act of 1994 certainly gave the Home Secretary new\npowers to set national policing objectives, supported by measurable performance\nindicators. It also required more explicit articulation of local policing plans, with local\nobjective setting (Hough, 2003). However, these long legislative levers were never\nattached to any appropriate gearing mechanism to reach down into the service itself.\nexpert-practice guides in an attempt to lift performance in criminal investigation and\npatrol management. However, these guides relied heavily on feeding back to the service\nin authoritative and accessible form what expert informants on the inside told Audit\nCommission researchers. In drawing upon the experience of Neighbourhood Policing,\nsome accounts tended to excise the problems and criticisms that had emerged during\nappropriate caveats in the Audit Commission's handbooks. In fact, before the 1993\nConservative police-reform watershed, the service itself had completed a unique\nOperational Review involving all three representative organisations (ACPO et al, 1990).\nThis important critique identified a clear disparity between police and public priorities\nfor the service, and started a process of internal debate about change which Sheehy\nmanaged to dissipate. It can also be argued that neither the Audit Commission reports\nnor the Sheehy report give a sense of the extraordinary difficulties involved in coor-\ndinating, controlling, and improving federated ranks' response to strategic redirection\nNPM and the police under New Labour\nNew Labour's attempts to outperform Conservative efforts to apply NPM reforms to\nthe police service have been admirably summarised and cogently criticised by Loveday\nand Reid (2003). They adduce evidence that steady centralisation and the micro-\nmanagement of police operations from Whitehall have been largely ineffective (pages\n25 ^ 28). They also present powerful and persuasive expert opinion as to the distorting\neffect of facile performance measurement on policing operations (page 19).\nSince 1997 successive Home Office initiatives aimed at top-down reform of policing\nfrom the Home Office have taken the NPM mission to a new phase. Newman (2002)\nhas produced a timely and helpful account of this evolution that seeks to explain\nresistance and the slow pace of change in the face of so much political enthusiasm.\nTwo factors are singled out. First, she cites the limitations imposed by the technical\nmeans available to achieve political ends. Second, she acknowledges the inertia of\nestablished institutions, particularly in the face of unresolvable tensions between eco-\nnomic and social goals in public service provision. The professions, as traditional\nmanagers of these tensions, resent and resist governmental interference (Broadbent\nAlthough it was not apparent in the academic consultation exercise which preceded\nits publication (Irving, 2004) the latest Police Reform White Paper (Home Office,\n2004a) is itself something of a model of improved NPM. This includes new commit-\nments to more specific means of delivery, and greater recognition of the realities of\nlocal police management. In particular, the need to improve middle management's\nskills is properly recognised.\nWe shall try to complement this welcome trend by focusing attention on a critical\nelement in the `means to ends' equation. The White Paper (Home Office, 2004a) credits\n(1) Some of those closely involved in the Neighbourhood Policing Experiment maintained a dialogue\nwith the Police Foundation as they were promoted through the ranks to senior levels in the service.\nThis conclusion is drawn from unpublished notes of that dialogue made by Irving between 1992 and\n1998. This can be verified by comparing Audit Commission and Neighbourhood Policing reports.\nPolice reform and the new public management paradigm 161\nthe National Intelligence Model with being the ``single most significant nationally\nimplemented change (in policing)'' (paragraph 2.4). There are significant aspirations to\n``increase the responsiveness and customer service of the police'' (paragraph 2.18 ^ 22)\nand the use of market-analysis tools in this respect is recommended (page 56).\nThe new Neighbourhood Policing mandate is to be intelligence led and proactive. If\nthese aspirations are to be approached without defeating the pledge to reduce bureau-\ncracy (paragraph 3.19), local policing management will need a rapid and consistent\nimprovement in the availability of smart information handling capacity. Moreover,\nlocal managers will need rapidly to increase their ability to use such smart systems\neffectively. The White Paper implicitly acknowledges the challenge this poses by\nhighlighting the ``lessons from Bichard and the Soham case'' (Home Office, 2004a,\nThe police management challenge and the critical role of information technology\nThe Police Reform White Paper (Home Office, 2004a, page 1) vaunts the increase in\nfigures need to be contextualised: consideration of time and space quickly diminish\ntheir power to impress. Even assuming that all available personnel are engaged in\ncore policing tasks, they must still be divided between four basic shifts.(3) Thus, there\nare an absolute maximum of 36 000 officers at any one time to cover 53 million citizens\nThese crude figures gloss over considerable variability between Basic Command Units\nhighest population density where the nature of the built environment creates special\nproblems for police surveillance (Audit Commission, 1996).

These accounts and\nexplanations, arising from the criminology literature, do not acknowledge the simi-\nlarities between the police service and many other enterprises.(4) Input resources are\nalways limited, production processes are always less efficient than would be ideal,\nand consumer demand for product is fickle, often irrational, and, without the control\nof price, potentially insatiable. The static role of management is to order operational\nprocesses so that, notwithstanding these difficulties, the total return on investment\nin inputs is optimised. The dynamic role is to foresee and forestall environmental,\nargue that because the police are expected to manage problems resulting from social\nprocesses far beyond their control, much police effort is thus devoted to asserting the\nfalse impression that they are, in fact, controlling the problems.\n(2) For a full treatment of the information technology issues arising in this case, see the Bichard\n(3) Three time periods and the rest/absent/training condition.\n(4) There are, of course, many differences.\n162 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley\nGeographic information systems (GIS) provide much of the technology backbone\nto local government\u00f6various estimates suggest that 70% ^ 80% of local government\nwork involves GIS in some way, and inventory-analysis applications are legion. Yet the\npotential of GIS to represent the characteristics of local populations remains very\nunderexploited in the delivery of public services, and local service delivery in policing\n(and also in education and health) seems to assume a passive population undifferen-\ntiated in attitudes, expectations, or even needs. In short, today's consumer-led public\nservices remain very much less sophisticated in targeting services than their counter-\nparts in the private sector\u00f6almost every public-facing part of the retail sector has had\ngeodemographic segmentation systems for years, if not decades.\nIn general terms, GIS make it possible to devise practical, rational measures of local\nservice demand, as well as facilitating transparent assessment of current performance\nlevels relative to locationally sensitive measures of need. In relation to specific urban\nservices, GIS can be used to anticipate and accommodate the priorities and preferences\nof local communities in terms of how services are delivered, or create the opportu-\nnity to achieve savings by targeting communication programmes to populations for\nwhom their messages are most appropriate (as, for example, with Neighbourhood\nWatch schemes in policing, or primary health care interventions). Chan (2003, pages\n655 ^ 676) provides a recent summary assessment of the impact of new technologies on\npolicing. In doing so, she echoes the conclusions of the general change and strategy\ntheorists quoted above. New technology, such as GIS, is absorbed into and modified\nPerhaps inevitably, new technology usually creates winners and losers and disturbs\nTechnological systems have their own inefficiencies: the success of a technology is\ncontingent on appropriate choice and implementation (Burnes, 2000, pages 80 ^ 87;\nare usually a prelude to instrumental action: unblocking resistance and creating and\nimplementing effective change strategy (Burnes, 2000, page 155). However, progress in\npolicing since 1980 has been painstakingly slow.\nInnovation in policing\nBeckett and Hart's (1981) Neighbourhood Policing strategy was built in twenty years\nof US legal realism research (Goldstein, 1979). A central plank of the strategy was\nthat the basic policing needs of communities could be met only if police used scientific\nand information technology (IT) methods to order and control the flow of infor-\nmation with which they had to deal (Beckett and Hart, 1981). It was on this basis\nthat the Metropolitan Police Neighbourhood Policing team commissioned the first\nlocal personal computer (PC)-based police information-handling system in the United\nKingdom and initiated the development of CRIS, the ambitious force-wide Crime\nReporting and Information System (see Turner, 1986, chart 11).\nEarly community-policing specialists in the United Kingdom, notably John Alderson\nin Devon and Cornwall (Alderson, 1979), were well aware of the interdependence\nbetween spatiotemporal crime mapping and the practical application of Goldstein's\nproblem-oriented approach. Although the Neighbourhood Policing IT plans do not\nstretch to mapping software, it was intended that their outputs should provide the basis\nfor crime-pattern analysis (Beckett and Hart, 1981).\nBy the mid-1980s Professor Stan Openshaw was already developing what was\nto be the basis of the first smart crime pattern analysis software in the United\nKingdom. At the same time Sir Stanley Bailey, Chief Constable of Northumbria,\nwas importing crime and incident recording concepts from the USA that were to\nPolice reform and the new public management paradigm 163\nmake Openshaw's ideas practicable by the end of the decade. However, in London the\ndifficulties of implementing area-based information-management systems during\nthe life of the Neighbourhood Policing Experiment (1981 ^ 89) are evident in Turner's\n(1986) evaluation report. The slow progress in the development of CRIS and its\nparallel offender-recording system, CRIMINT, can be charted through contemporary\nthe United Kingdom's premier police force were still incapable of performing smart\nThe IT difficulties that emerged during the Neighbourhood Policing project\nconvinced the Police Foundation of the need to invest in the development of crime\npattern analysis software. Between 1989 and 1995, the Police Foundation, Northumbria\nPolice, and Newcastle University (Centre for Urban and Rural Development Studies)\njointly developed an appropriate crime and incident mapping system which was com-\nmercialised by Forensic Technology Ltd, which was taken over by ABM Ltd in 1998.(5)\nIt is ironic that, if the Home Office had supported this development process in its early\nyears, police forces in the United Kingdom would have had for free what they now\nhave to acquire at standard commercial prices. ABM's PROphecy system was acquired\nby the much-praised New York Police Department in 2004.\nCope (2003, page 355 et seq.) describes the problems associated with the intro-\nduction of crime-pattern analysis and associated IT: the quality of data, data-input\nand back-record conversion difficulties, the relative inefficiency of analytic algorithms,\nthe insufficiency of background research, and so on. What is missing is an assessment\nof the efficacy of technological support provided to police managers by force IT\ndepartments and their central government mentors.\nIn an attempt to understand the sociotechnical constraints on the introduction\nand development of IT-led police project and performance management, Irving fol-\nlowed the fortunes of a Problem Oriented Policing project in Thames Valley and\nNorthumbria (Irving and Dixon, 2002). In large part, the failure of the project\ncould be ascribed to lack of appropriate IT support and training which even negated\nthe effect of Northumbria's nominal software superiority. Moreover, Northumbria's\nanalytic capability appeared to have degenerated since the end of the force's active\ninvolvement in relevant research and development.\nIn the conclusion to their report, Irving and Dixon (2002) comment on the police\nservice's poor record in managing technical innovation and recommend that the Home\nOffice pay more attention to forces' capacity and capability to undertake and champion\ninnovation. This recommendation harks back to a previous paper on the diffusion\nof innovation prepared for the Home Office (Faulkner and Irving, 1994). This recom-\nmendation in relation to project IT support was again tested in an early phase of the\nNational Reassurance Policing Programme. Participating forces' IT capability to\nsupport problem-oriented policing strategies at local community level was found to be\ngenerally unsatisfactory and in urgent need of rectification to render the wider project\nThis brief history of one important aspect of change and innovation management\nin the police service provides some compelling evidence that NPM aspirations to\nmimic private sector use of technology to improve organisational efficiency may be\nproblematic. Where no other means of improvement are available, the NPM mission\nwould seem to depend on investing more in understanding the dynamics of innova-\ntion lag in policing. To this end, we go on to look at a particular emerging avenue of\ntechnical innovation in crime-pattern analysis; and consider the gap between its\nmanagement potential and its take-up, and how that gap might be reduced.\n(5) See http://www.abm-uk.com/uk/index.asp\n164 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley\nKnowledge base and technology: opportunities and constraints\nOpportunities\nTechnology is clearly necessary, but not sufficient, for success in implementing an\neffective criminal justice system. Some of the key technology trends that will shape\nthe technological setting to criminal justice reform and neighbourhood policing in the\nrest of this decade include:\n(1) Data sharing under agreed protocols and subject to robust user-authentication\nprocedures.\n(2) Services-oriented architectures\u00f6web services will make it much easier to integrate\ntechnology into neighbourhood-based policing strategies, and will drive the acceptance\nand adoption of technology by those charged with implementing policies.\n(3) Spatial data infrastructures (SDI) and portals\u00f6access to data is still a constraint on\nGIS, and top-down programs that organize data access via web portals will alleviate\nthese problems.\n(4) Sensory webs\u00f6new hardware and network developments now allow low-cost sensors\nto be placed in many more remote locations (for example, in vehicles, or on people).\nThese can track and monitor objects that move or change state, and can relay this\ninformation to central GIS logging and analysis systems. These open up many new\napplications for GIS in neighbourhood policing.\n(5) Modelling and analysis\u00f6our ability to perform GIScience is being enhanced by the\navailability of improved software for spatial analysis and modelling. Key develop-\nments in GIS include both exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), and developments\nin inferential statistics. Techniques that are sensitive to local context without sacrific-\ning the power of generalisation are also important\u00f6such as geographically weighted\nregression [GWR (Fotheringham et al, 2002)].\n(6) Data management\u00f6information systems now have vastly improved facilities for\nmeasuring and monitoring changes in systems in real time, and for accommodating\nmultiuser transactions.\n(7) Mobile technologies\u00f6for example, hand-held GIS which incorporate global posi-\ntioning systems (GPS). A portable GIS may be used for reporting policing activity and\nextend to the extended policing family, for example, neighbourhood wardens reporting\n`envirocrime' such as graffiti, fly-tipping, and vandalism whereby real-time mapping\nGPS and GPRS (global packet radio service) technologies are used to report incident\nlocations to a central GIS database thus enabling rapid and appropriate response\n(8) Visualisation\u00f6the ability to visualise geographic data in conventional two-dimen-\nsional maps and three-dimensional representations is already providing new scientific\ninsights, as well as helping to popularise GIS-based representations of localities. For\nexample, ESRI ArcGlobe has been used at University College London to bring\ntogether information on socioeconomic distributions (fear of crime) with built environ-\nments, and this kind of approach may allow police forces to understand the physical\ncontext of neighbourhood satisfaction with reassurance policing better.\nSuch tools and technologies are, however, applied in particular institutional and\norganisational contexts. As such, constraints may pertain to the external operating\nenvironment (such as data-protection legislation), or to the particular setting in which\npolicy is formulated.\nConstraints\nAccessibility\nIn spite of broad public familiarity with geographic and the simpler GIScience con-\ncepts through exposure to education and the Internet, there is evidence that more\nPolice reform and the new public management paradigm 165\nadvanced GIScience and its applications exclude a large number of potential users\nand beneficiaries because of their complex statistical and computing base. They may\nalso disenfranchise some of those who might otherwise wish or need to appreciate\nthe basis on which current GIS users make strategic and tactical decisions that affect\nthem.\nMany of the insights gained from applications of GIScience are counterintuitive\nand counterexperiential. Public trust and confidence in GIScience depends on improv-\ning current levels of accessibility. Software needs to be more user-friendly and to be\nfail-safe in the hands of inexpert practitioners.\nThe quality of geodemographic data infrastructures\nAs geodemographic data sources proliferate, extracting valid and reliable information\nfrom them to apply to public service operational decision making becomes more of\na challenge. Dedication to unsatisfactory data by dint of previous investment, or force\nof habit and convenience, undermines the management process that GIScience is\nintended to support and improve. Zonally coarse, infrequently collected, unstable,\nor otherwise inappropriate and inaccurate data can marginalise and/or disempower\nindividuals, groups, and communities when important public sector investment\nand resource-deployment decisions are made on an empirical geodemographic basis.\nPoor geographic data and information extraction defeat the very moral political and\nideological ends that its use is meant to serve.\nModelling and visualising complexity\nThe current generation of GIS have limitations in their ability to represent real geo-\ngraphic phenomena, particularly their dynamics. In the best of all possible worlds,\nGIS would include data models for all types of geographic phenomena, including those\nthat are well beyond the range of currently supported data models. It is impossible,\nfor example, to build effective representations today of phenomena such as crime hot\nspots that simultaneously move, change shape, and change internal structure. Many\nmore examples exist, leading us to suggest that the development of data models\nfor complex geographic phenomena should be given high priority by the GIScience\nresearch community.\nThe effects of ontological anxiety\nThreats to community security transmitted and amplified by commercial media hungry\nfor audiences and politicians hungry for votes are creating an ontological form of\nanxiety (Giddens, 1991). Military and security-service investment in surveillance, fuelled\nby public and political concern, has created an unparalleled flow of geographical data\nwhich GIScience can help turn into useful warnings, risk assessments, and general\nintelligence. But the very anxiety that helps to create the necessary investment to\nproduce this flow tends to keep the product hidden from many of those who are best\nplaced to help with the extraction and interpretation processes.\nFeeding the technology with adequate science\nRecent advances in GIS modelling and analysis may be helping us to model the world\nbetter and to test ever more sophisticated hypotheses about the future in respect, for\nexample, of climate and population change. However, the utility of this increase in\nmodelling capability depends on the adequacy of the scientific explanatory paradigms\navailable to select variables, define relationship algorithms, and interpret outputs.\nThe better the modelling, the more severe the test on the scientific backup\u00f6witness\nthe state of the climate-change debate.\n166 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley\nPolice reform, local management, and technological innovation\nThe new localism philosophy of central government establishes community engagement,\ncitizen-focused service delivery, and the neighbourhood at the heart of policy and its\ndelivery management. However, in spite of significant reform in strategic management\nstructures, performance-assessment frameworks, and the focused redistribution of\nresources across the criminal justice system, many outputs and outcomes fail to\nsubstantiate the political rhetoric surrounding the local, the neighbourhood, and the\ncommunity (Ashby, 2005). The most recent Police Reform White Paper explicitly calls\nfor effective engagement strategies from the police service, which necessarily require\na ``detailed, neighbourhood level understanding of the demographics of the community\nit serves'' (Home Office, 2004a, page 67). However, it is our experience that such a\ndetailed appreciation of local populations is usually lacking in UK policing.\nMoreover, although the public may reasonably expect their local police to retain a\ndetailed knowledge of crime hot spots, evidence suggests that police perceptions are\nusually at odds with evidence-based computer-generated hot-spot maps (Ratcliffe and\nMcCullagh, 2001, page 336). Furthermore, commentators have consistently argued\nthat, given the nature of operational policing, officers are most unlikely to identify\nsubtle and intricate differences in performance between neighbourhoods (see Ashby,\n2005; Scott, 1998). Similarly, in those areas where policing response to incidents is low,\nvariation in concerns, anxieties, and fears in the community are unlikely to be\nobserved whilst operating under traditional reactive policing strategies. In recognition\nof such arguments, significant resource commitments, research, and political rhetoric\nsurrounds terms such as `citizen-focused service delivery', `neighbourhood policing',\nand `reassurance policing'. Although such evidence challenges the maxim that a `good\ncopper knows his beat', large sectors of the police service have been slow to adopt\nmuch of the technological and analytical expertise which may help rectify the disparity\nbetween external expectations, police perceptions, and reality.\nGIS and crime mapping is proving to be of mounting importance in policing, with\na wide range and increasing number of application texts (for example, Chainey and\nformal fora (the US National Institute of Justice held its Eighth Annual International\nCrime Mapping Conference in September 2005), and online discussion outlets [for\nexample, the CrimeMap listserv(6)] both for practitioners and for researchers. Further-\nmore, the Home Office has recently commissioned a good-practice guide on crime\nmapping in policing and an evaluation of the various GIS-based information-sharing\nsystems currently utilised across the United Kingdom. However, the very fact that central\ngovernment needs to conduct such assessments and evaluations suggests that there is\ncurrently a lack of cohesion and consensus on the subject, leading to different practices\n(at worst, conflicting; at best, inefficient) across the forces of the United Kingdom.\nRatcliffe (2002b, page 63) corroborates these concerns, citing mismatches between\ndatabases, GIS software functionality, user expertise, and intelligence needs.\nAlthough the increased focus on geospatial technologies is welcome, the predom-\ninant applications for crime mapping in UK Basic Command Units remain relatively\nunsophisticated and often only tactical in nature. Mirroring the US example of\nCompStat, the geographical plotting and spatial analysis of recent UK crime trends\nin tactical briefings is probably the most advanced and high-impact current use of\nspatial techniques. These techniques commonly identify the extent and location of a\ncrime problem, and form a basis for subsequent targeting of police resources. Notwith-\nstanding command and control/dispatch, hot-spot detection and risk propensity surface\n(6) http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/maps/listserv.html\nPolice reform and the new public management paradigm 167\nidentification are currently perceived as the pinnacle of GIS deployment in a\nlocal policing context. Comparatively little geographical expertise is employed in\nmore strategic tasks such as performance review and the objective evaluation of\ncrime-reduction or community-safety initiatives. Although proactive, intelligence-led,\nevidence-based policy and policing strategy may dominate political rhetoric in the\nUnited Kingdom, GIScience expertise native to the police service predominantly\nremains focused on high-profile, reactive policing strategies. Proportionally, relatively\nlittle resource is directed to understanding the composition of local populations, their\nconcerns, and priorities, and the development of successful engagement strategies\ntherefore argue that, just because GIS is currently used in simple hot-spot analysis,\na smooth and untroubled transition to strategic deployment cannot be assumed.\nThe National Reassurance Policing Programme (NRPP) and signal-crimes perspec-\ntive indicates an interesting developmental pathway (Innes et al, 2004). After fifteen\nyears of `regime drift'\u00f6where performance indicators had dominated and efficiency\nhad become more influential than public satisfaction and confidence (Ashby, 2005)\u00f6a\nreturn to community policing styles and engagement with local communities is postu-\nlated as a means of tackling declining public confidence and satisfaction with policing\nin a period of falling crime rates. However, the reassurance-policing paradigm requires\ngeospatial expertise, technology, and capacity, and as yet the project plans contain few\nprescriptive requirements for spatial analysis. For example, fundamental geocoding\nprocedures remain a topic for research and development (see, for example, Ratcliffe,\n2004) and current practices are undeniably variable across Basic Command Units of\ncontemporary police forces. Similarly, the lack of IT commonality further hampers\ncommon training standards, and historically the important role of the intelligence\nofficer has not attracted the most appropriate candidates (Ratcliffe, 2002a). Further-\nmore, Radcliffe's arguments sustain the view that the police service has failed to\ntransplant business practice effectively and to diffuse technical innovation at a rate\ncomparable with that in the private sector:\n``In many police services, new technologies take a long time to implement, and\nby the time they are in place a brief tour of the policing and commercial sites\non the Internet show that they have been invariably superseded by something better\nGeodemographics: an example of geospatial technology diffusion in the police\nWithin the domain of spatial analysis, geodemographics (the classification of small\nareas into similar neighbourhood types) has been widely used within the private sector\nfor decades and has become pivotal to tactical and strategic resource management.\nHowever, despite its origins in deprivation studies (Webber, 1975; 2004), adaptation to\npublic service delivery applications has only recently been mooted (see Ashby, 2005;\nrecent Police Reform White Paper cites Avon and Somerset Constabulary's use of\n``market analysis tools to reduce crime'' (Home Office, 2004a, page 56), and the use\nof the proprietary ACORN geodemographic classification as a component in allocat-\ning some top-up allowances in police resourcing (Home Office, 2004b). Rudimentary\ngeodemographic analyses have been published in Home Office Statistics Bulletins (for\nexample, Aust and Condon, 2003), with yet more limited analyses regularly summar-\nised in a generalised context (Dodd et al, 2004; Simmons, 2002; Simmons and Dodd,\n2003). Nevertheless, geodemographics applications in UK policing remain surprisingly\nscarce and limited given the political rhetoric surrounding a `customer-service culture'\nfor policing and the drive to adopt best business practice.\n168 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley\nOur own research in Devon and Cornwall Constabulary has pioneered geodemo-\ngraphic analysis of recorded-crime databases and national surveys as a strategic tool\nfor local resource allocation, effective community engagement, and strategic delinea-\ntion of priority areas. The adoption of such technologies has been championed by\nforward-looking local managers, keen to grasp the potential value both of locally\nadministered and of centrally available datasets. Leveraging extra information from\nsuch databases has been common practice in commercial marketing operations for\nmany years, but the benefits in the public sector remain largely unrealised (for dis-\ncussion of preliminary findings and strategic opportunities see Ashby, 2005; Ashby\nand Longley, 2005). Until recently, the public sector culture purposefully ignored\nsegmentation of the communities it served. The adoption of geodemographics for the\ncustomisation of local public service delivery potentially offers benefits far exceeding\nthose observed in the commercial world. In commercial practice, geodemographic\nanalysis is usually used to target appropriate markets with specific private goods.\nThe benefits therefore accrue to particular segments of the population through free-\nmarket mechanisms. Public goods such as policing are, by their nature, inclusive, and\na challenge is to ensure that benefits accrue across the entire population.\nA pragmatic approach to enable the leverage of extra information from adminis-\ntrative datasets, with a view to informing intelligence-led neighbourhood policing\nstyles, has been described elsewhere (Ashby, 2005; Ashby and Longley, 2005). Further,\nit has been commented that such data-driven approaches and heuristic models of\nappropriate policing styles for different localities are consistent with theoretical models\nof neighbourhood development: for example, the concepts of collective efficacy (7) and\nthe notion of social capital (see Ashby, 2005; Williamson et al, 2005). Although further\ndiscussion of these methodologies and results is inappropriate here, the fundamental\nunderpinnings should be clarified. Using statistical clustering algorithms it is possible\nto cluster every neighbourhood (in our case, unit postcodes which on average consti-\ntute fifteen households) into a distinct category based upon a range of social-economic,\ngeographic, demographic, financial, property, consumption, and lifestyle traits. In\npractice, such classifications are regularly developed by leading commercial vendors\n(for example, Experian(8) or CACI(9)), academics, and/or governmental organisations\nfor a range of purposes and spatial scales (for discussion of such typologies, see Sleight,\n2004). The number of categories within such typologies ranges from thirty to sixty-five\nneighbourhood types, with aggregated groups (typically eight to fifteen in number) also\nfrequently utilised. National classification of very small areas (postcodes), based on\nsocioeconomic and demographic composition rather than upon geographic location\nalone, enable the comparison of similar areas in different regions of the country.\nThe classification of areas based upon underlying data rather than crude groupings\nof administrative areas such as Police Force areas, Basic Command Units, or local\nauthority districts is consistent with the remit of the Public Service Reform Agenda\nregarding devolution and delegation to the lowest appropriate scale to meet the needs\nof local communities. As such, the analysis of administrative datasets and national\ngovernment surveys would enable: comparative performance assessment and bench-\nmarking of similar areas with similar policing environments; the dissemination of\n(7) ``Defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control\nof public space, collective efficacy explains lower rates of crime and observed disorder after con-\ntrolling for neighbourhood structural characteristics'' (Sampson and Raudenbush, 1999, page 603).\nDevelopments of this concept and discussion of the progression of neighbourhoods in a policing\ncontext are given in Nolan et al (2004).\n(8) http://www.business-strategies.co.uk\n(9) http://www.caci.co.uk\nPolice reform and the new public management paradigm 169\n`what works' to other regions in similar circumstances; and the effective targeting\nof resources and communications strategies based upon a detailed understanding of\nthe likely activity patterns, attitudes, expectations, and concerns of local communities.\nAlthough the potential value of such geodemographic analysis is recognised by\nlocal managers when they are exposed to such techniques, the adoption of these new\ntechnologies and methodologies within the police service has yet to be firmly estab-\nlished within the crime analyst's toolbox. A summary of relevant findings from our\nown experience with a wide range of police forces, partner organisations, and central\ngovernment departments are outlined below. This list also highlights some of the key\nobserved barriers to the diffusion of new technologies in the police service:\n(1) Tendered contracts for IT management and the provision of GIS software can\nhinder the swift adoption of desktop spatial analytical packages.\n(2) User requirements are too frequently written by semidetached IT specialists, who\ntend to impose their view of what end users require.\n(3) Data-protection safeguards and restrictions, often assumed and untested, can\nadversely affect the flexibility that analysts may require to explore datasets and to\naugment ancillary data sources for strategic analyses.\n(4) Information-sharing infrastructures remain poorly developed and local managers\nhave frequently expressed the need for further guidance and clarity regarding legislative\nduties and responsibilities, statutory requirements, liabilities and legal vires to enable\nmore efficient and effective partnership work. Police managers often do not appreciate\nthe sophisticated flexibilities available within the data-protection legislation.\n(5) Appropriate and relevant training for crime analysts is an essential prerequisite to\nthe diffusion of any new technologies or techniques. The capability of trainee analysts\nis often appropriate only for current technology. Therefore innovation may be resisted\nor rejected in order to preserve individuals' capabilities.\n(6) The research industry that has grown up around GIS development tends to favour\nthe generation of `training' as opposed to supporting technological innovation that\nwould ultimately reduce or eliminate the current market value of available training\nmaterials.\n(7) Managers trained largely on legal notions of evidence find it difficult to cope with\nsoft probabilistic information in their decision making.\n(8) Police managers have not yet acquired the military trick of leading and directing\nlevels of technical expertise that they do not share.\nSome strategic recommendations\nThe authors' experience in disseminating and implementing new technologies and\nanalytical methods into the police service at a local level has encompassed myriad\nresistances, and although many obstacles have been overcome, many challenges remain.\nWhereas the value and potential of more sophisticated spatial analyses of policing\nenvironments is widely appreciated, the capacity to negotiate a range of obstacles\nsuccessfully needs fostering. A working group of police forces, partnership organisa-\ntions, academics, and commercial sponsors is assisting us in the dissemination of\ngeodemographic analysis `best practice' and in the formulation of key standards\nand principles to enable effective comparisons and dialogues between apparently\notherwise disparate partners. We suggest that the development of such partnerships\nacross administrative boundaries, functional specialisms, and divisions within the\npublic sector would enable efficient, appropriately targeted, service delivery founded\nupon evidence-based policy and best practice. Although the absence of competition\nacross public service regions and departments should enable much more effective\npooling of resources, intelligence, technology, and expertise than is currently observed,\n170 D I Ashby, B L Irving, P A Longley\nor indeed could be practised in commercial environments, it remains the case that\ncompetitors in the commercial world remain far more advanced in the sharing of key\ndata and the development of standards, protocols, and infrastructures. This paradox\nneeds to be addressed. It may be, as Lord Browne (cited by Sylvester, 2005) recently\nobserved, that the public sector needs to appreciate its distinctive characteristics better.\nPublic services may compete for public money, but that should not act to the\ndetriment of their public clients. Geodemographic analysis of public service require-\nments has the capacity to demonstrate ways in which different public service delivery\nunits can act synergistically. For example, by representing the policing concerns of a\ncommunity in a geodemographic framework, the need for interagency partnership\nworking becomes less rhetorical and more concrete: planning, architectural, housing,\ntransport, and educational requirements to aid problem solving are rapidly made\nmanifest. The danger of splitting each citizen client into a number of discrete service\ncomponents to be treated separately diminishes. The campaign for data sharing is a\ndangerous oversimplification: what is required is information sharing, and this presup-\nposes a shared conceptual framework, technology, and informatics expertise. Only then\nwill interagency working become the efficient public service tool of recent political\nvisions.\nHowever, echoing Ratcliffe's discussion of intelligence-led policing, such prescrip-\ntions have to be accompanied by well financed process and outcome evaluation:\n``A more pressing problem is the absence of a conceptual framework ... that is\nsupported by an evidence-based theory. The dearth of any empirical and contextual\nresearch into the effectiveness of intelligence led policing in either the academic or\nprofessional literature leaves the police with little option other than to experiment\nEngaging with a wide range of managers, analysts, strategists, and researchers in the\naforementioned working group, the authors have observed that fundamental concepts\nand practices can remain straightforward and transparent, and lucid guides to best\npractice can be produced. Clear visualisation is highly valued and spatial analyses need\nnot be limited to specialist GIS products. Professional GIS software is largely unneces-\nsary (and prohibitively expensive) for a wide variety of users and, although such\nfunctionality is required by analysts, a full working knowledge of these applications\nis unwarranted for a manager simply wanting to create, view, and manipulate a\ncomputer-generated map. Whereas basic mapping tools could become part of a generic\noffice suite of applications, more advanced analytic tools will remain the domain of\nspecially trained personnel. However, GIS and geodemographics need not be limited\nto highly trained analysts with top-end computers.\nIn the light of this discussion we recommend the following:\n(1) Further clarity and guidance to public service managers and their supporting\nanalysts about harmonising data-capture, processing, and analytic systems so that\ninformation sharing is rendered not only viable but attractive.\n(2) Commitment to open up knowledge-transfer networks beyond their current,\nrelatively rigid, boundaries allowing academic and commercial influences to dissipate\npublic sector protectionism.\n(3) Reaffirmation of central government's role, not as an arbiter of system design, but\nas `referee' capable of ensuring the level of interoperability necessary for open system\nknowledge transfer benefits to accrue.\n(4) Designing GIS to fit management needs from strategic through tactical to\noperational planning and feedback without allowing current low expectations and\nlow levels of expertise to determine how the technology is developed\u00f6empowering\nend-users in the design process.\nPolice reform and the new public management paradigm 171\nConcluding remarks\nThe police service continues to struggle to bridge some of the gaps between what\nlegislators want and what managers need in terms of performance management.\nAlthough it is understandable that training and research in strategic spatial analysis\nwithin the police force has to compete with the pressing demands of tactical policing\nfor limited resources, the commitment by central government to provide a customer-\nservice culture and to deliver local, community-focused, neighbourhood-style policing\nsuggests the need to explore state-of-the-art solutions from the private sector. In light\nof the current commitment to new localism we suggest that, although geodemographics\nis never likely to become a panacea for neighbourhood policing (nor should it), the\napparent failure to embrace such ideas, evaluate their potential, and provide a robust\nevidence base will perpetuate the gap between the best practice of the public and\nprivate sectors. The available evidence and experience indicates that substantial\nand tangible benefits are available.\nCrime and disorder are perennially important to voters and, therefore, to politi-\ncians. The current political requirement to control taxation and the high cost of\npolicing society creates a chronic gap between political aspirations and the reality\nof operational policy. Performance management and the efficient use of technology\nprovide reasonable scope for closing this gap. Although GIS must compete with a host\nof other management and technology solutions, it uniquely offers an essential compo-\nnent of management control: a means of making sense of the police service's arena of\noperations. Without it, the National Intelligence Model (NIM) and the new localism\nare largely rhetoric.\nPrivate sector managers whose companies depend absolutely on understanding\ntheir markets have already embraced GIS and are adapting it to their special needs.\nThis process of development has been stunted in the police service, and now needs to\nbe continuously vitalised to overcome a clutch of evident threats to progress.\nProspectively, the future of geodemographics in the public services is encouraging\nand although our argument highlights the time lag between public sector and private\nsector practice, the counter argument is legitimate; we support Radcliffe's view (2002a,\npage 54) that the apparent ineffectiveness of the traditional policing paradigm is\nfuelling enthusiasm for new technology and processes, and that bona fide evaluation\nis fundamental. We believe that this enthusiasm paradoxically raises the risk that GIS\nwill not be properly developed and deployed in policing. For this reason, careful\nprocess and outcome evaluations are essential, not solely, or even mainly, as a civil\nservice dominated check on ministerial strategy or investment, but as an essential part\nof an internal police service led process of innovation management.\nAcknowledgements.

    "reduced_content": "Context and pressures for change\nNew public management (NPM) has been built around private sector techniques of\nenterprise regulation, coordination, and control, and reflects a sense of their innate\nsuperiority (Osborne and McLaughlin, 2002; Willcox and Harrow, 1992). The essence\nof NPM has been summarised as `managers, markets, and measurement' (Ferlie et al,\n1996), although differing degrees of emphasis can be identified and there is some minor\ndisagreement in the literature over the nature of the key features of NPM (Butterfield\nNPM as it pertains to the police service in Britain, stressing the importance of the\n`practitioner manager' in changing managerial roles and the reassignment of strategic\nresponsibilities. The police, caricatured as the service industry where the customer is\nalways wrong (Squires, 1998, page 169), has presented NPM with a serious challenge\nduring both its Conservative and its New Labour manifestations (Newman, 2002).\nIn this paper we focus upon the sociotechnical issues (Trist et al, 1963) that are integral\nto the current NPM reform process.\nCommentators have been aware of the unique challenge of police management for\nmany years.
