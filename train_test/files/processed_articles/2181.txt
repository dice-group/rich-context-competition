    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Persons who are likely to be the heaviest users of medical and\nsupportive care services--those with chronic illnesses, disabilities, and func-\ntional limitations--are often forced to navigate a system that requires them to\nperform most of the coordination functions themselves and is generally not\norganized around their needs. In 1996 an estimated 128 million Americans had\nat least one of these three conditions, and 9.5 million had all three. This paper\nexamines the current programs designed to assist these persons and suggests\nchanges in eligibility rules, coverage policies, and educational programs to\nprovide a system more oriented to people's chronic care needs.\nAn estimated 125 million americans had one or more\nchronic illnesses, fifty million had a disability, and fifteen\nmillion had a functional limitation in 2000. Unfortunately,\nthe medical care system is not oriented around the needs of persons\nwith chronic illnesses; many persons with disabilities have difficul-\nties obtaining appropriate services; and the long-term supportive\ncare system does not facilitate access to some of the services that\npeople with functional limitations need. The challenges to obtaining\nappropriate care, however, are exacerbated when a person has two\nor all three of these problems. Such persons often have to navigate a\nsystem that requires them to coordinate several disparate financing\nand delivery systems themselves, making it more difficult to obtain\nthe full range of appropriate services.\nIn this paper we first estimate the number of persons who have\nchronic illnesses, disabilities, and functional limitations and then\nexamine the number who fall into one, two, or all three categories.\n\u00a92001 Project HOPEThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nJerry Anderson is a professor of health policy and management and international health at\nthe Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and national program\ndirector for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Partnership for Solutions: Better Lives\nfor People with Chronic Conditions.

The paper focuses on two prob-\nlems: (1) the need to better integrate eligibility and coverage stan-\ndards across disparate programs; and (2) the need to change the\nprofessional culture of clinicians.\nChronic Illnesses\nOver the past 100 years the medical care system has evolved to\nbecome oriented primarily toward the treatment of acute illnesses.\nBut these developments lag behind demographic trends. Care for\nchronic illnesses has become the most common reason why Ameri-\nhad one or more chronic conditions and were responsible for 75\ncans will have one or more such conditions, accounting for 80 per-\ncent of health spending.\"\nI Inadequate clinical information systems. A lack of conver-\ngence between persons' needs and the system's orientation can lead\nto numerous problems. Most clinical information systems, for exam-\nple, do not permit clinicians to know what other clinicians are doing\nfor a patient. Our analysis of Medicare claims data suggests that the\naverage Medicare beneficiary with one or more chronic conditions is\nseen by eight different physicians during a year; this indicates that\nthe potential scope of the problem is quite large.# The need for\ncoordination of care and integrated information systems becomes\nespecially important when a person has multiple chronic illnesses\n(for example, heart disease, asthma, and depression), each of which\nmight require treatment by a different specialist. In these cases, each\nclinician may be unaware of the exact treatments being delivered by\nthe others.\nA national survey conducted in 2000 indicates some of the impli-\ncations of inadequate communication among clinicians. Approxi-\nmately twenty million Americans with chronic illnesses received\ncontradictory information from different health care providers dur-\ning the year, eighteen million received a contradictory diagnosis for\nthe same chronic illness, and seventeen million reported going to the\npharmacist only to be told of a potential drug/drug interaction.$\nBetter communication among clinicians could reduce these numbers.\nI Preventable hospitalizations. Ambulatory care\u00adsensitive\nconditions are hospitalizations that might have been prevented\nwith good ambulatory care.% We compared the number of such con-\nditions in Medicare beneficiaries with one chronic illness to those\nwith five or more chronic illnesses. Our analysis of the 1999 Medi-\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ N o v e m b e r / D e c e m b e r 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

How-\never, 12.8 percent of beneficiaries with five or more chronic illnesses\nwere hospitalized with an ambulatory care\u00adsensitive condition.\nI Insurance coverage. Health care benefits generally provide\nbetter coverage for acute episodes than for ongoing care. Medicare,\nfor example, does not cover some services needed by beneficiaries\nwith chronic illnesses, the most prominent being prescription\ndrugs. In addition, definitions of medical necessity, used by insurers to\ndecide if certain services will be reimbursed, frequently restrict re-\nimbursement to situations in which the person is showing improve-\nment. As a result, services designed to slow the progression of a\nchronic illness may not be covered. For example, physical therapy\ncoverage may end if the person is not showing any improvement,\neven though the treatment objective is to slow the progression of\ndisease or maintain the present level of mobility.\nCost-sharing provisions are another coverage issue that may dis-\nproportionately affect persons with chronic illnesses. Such persons\nare more likely to spend more out of pocket on coinsurance and\ncopayments and because of their higher use of services that their\ninsurance does not cover.&\nI Provider payment. Payment systems are oriented to acute\nepisodes. Some systems do not pay providers for the time they spend\ncoordinating care with other providers. Payment rates are typically\ngreater when the physician is treating an acute episode than when\nhe or she is providing ongoing care or counseling. Physicians and\nother health care providers may respond to these signals and empha-\nsize episodic over ongoing care.'\nI Coordination of care. Most clinical education programs em-\nphasize hospital-based, episodic specialty care. As a result, less at-\ntention may be given to comorbid conditions or the need to coordi-\nnate care with other clinicians. Studies have shown that physicians\nare less likely to give adequate attention to chronic conditions that\nare unrelated to the reason for the patient's visit. An estimated\nsixty million Americans had multiple chronic illnesses in 2000, and\nthe number is projected to increase to eighty-one million by 2020.\nClinical education programs need to give greater attention to coor-\ndination of care for these persons.\nFunctional Limitations\nFunctional limitations are a second way of identifying persons with\nspecial medical and supportive care needs, although some may have\nboth chronic illnesses and functional limitations. Generally, func-\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~\nV o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 6\nC o o r d i n a t i o n O f C a r e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Approximately fifteen million\nAmericans had a functional limitation in 1995.!\nI Evolution of the long-term care system. The financing and\nprovision of supportive services evolved very differently from those\nof medical care. Unfortunately, the differences in organization and\nfinancing are never clear to most people until the need arises for\nlong-term care.\nLong-term care services, such as custodial nursing home and per-\nsonal care, were considered \"social\" rather than \"medical\" services\nby the crafters of early health insurance plans, and this perspective\nwas adopted by the designers of Medicare. Thus, long-term care\ndeveloped in an environment where the Medicare program did not\nprovide long-term care benefits, and, with the exception of Medic-\naid, the medical model, not the supportive care model, has been\nadopted by most other third-party payers.\nI Insurance coverage. Most health insurance plans do not pay\nfor custodial long-term care services. Medicare, for example, pays\nfor some long-term care when it is rehabilitative, such as care after a\nstroke or a hip replacement. This means that benefits are limited\nbecause services are covered only as long as the person is showing\nimprovement. Most private insurers have similar provisions. Medic-\naid is the major public source of service funding for persons with\nfunctional limitations. Other public sources include state-only pro-\ngrams, Administration on Aging programs, and Title XX of the So-\ncial Security Act, all of which provide support mostly for home and\ncommunity services.\nWhile the coverage and protection offered by these policies has\nimproved over the years, limitations still exist. Insurance coverage\nfor supportive services is less extensive than that for medical care\nservices. Generally, eligibility criteria for public coverage include\nboth functional limitation and financial criteria. Insurance coverage\ncan have a major influence on treatment options. A physician, for\nexample, needs to consider one range of possible services for a\nmiddle-income elderly person who has supportive care needs but\ncan consider a different range of services for a poor elderly person\nwho is eligible for Medicaid. Ironically, because of better coverage\nfor supportive services under Medicaid, a poor person is likely to be\n\"Under Medicaid, a poor person is likely to be eligible for a wider\narray of services than is a middle-income person.\"\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ N o v e m b e r / D e c e m b e r 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The actual delivery of formal, paid\nsupportive services includes a panoply of systems that vary with a\nperson's specific needs. Services vary from \"meals on wheels\" pro-\ngrams to highly skilled nursing home care. Often, supportive serv-\nices are not organized in a way that a frail person or a family can\nunderstand the full range of available services, how the services can\nbe obtained, the costs and available subsidies, and the pros and cons\nof each type of service. According to a national survey, the most\ncommon information source about supportive services remains fam-\nily and friends.\"\nA combination of scarcity of funding, complex eligibility require-\nments, and preferences of families has meant that informal care\ncontinues to be the most common method of providing supportive\nservices. Almost two-thirds of those with functional limitations\nwho live in the community receive support exclusively from family,\nfriends, and volunteers.# Fewer than 10 percent rely exclusively on\nformal, paid long-term care providers. Recent estimates suggest that\nthe economic value of informal caregiving far exceeds what is spent\non formal long-term care services.$\nI Other concerns. First, most information systems do not allow\nthe various supportive care providers to share data on their patients.\nIn addition, a person's medical care provider often will have little if\nany contact with the long-term care provider, and rarely will the\nmedical care provider offer advice to the long-term care provider\nabout managing the person's care.\nPeople beginning to need supportive services often go as long as\npossible before entering the long-term care system when their con-\ndition has reached a crisis point. A detailed study of how people\nenter the long-term care system in Springfield, Massachusetts, for\nexample, documented the unmet long-term care needs that occur for\npersons who lacked coordination of care.% Most people who started\nto receive supportive care services did so only after some acute\nexacerbation, many of which might have been avoided if the person\ncould have found needed long-term care services earlier.\nCoverage for long-term supportive services is likely to be re-\nstricted to persons who qualify for Medicaid. As a result, only per-\nsons with low incomes and no assets can receive extended long-\nterm care services. Although there is growing private long-term care\ninsurance, out-of-pocket spending remains the most common\nmeans of paying for long-term supportive services for those who do\nnot qualify for Medicaid.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~\nV o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 6\nC o o r d i n a t i o n O f C a r e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Government and insurance programs use the\nterms disability and functional limitations differently, however, when\ndetermining eligibility requirements.\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine, disability \"is the expres-\nsion of a physical or mental limitation in a social context--the gap\nbetween a person's capabilities and the demands of the environ-\nment. People with such functional limitations are not inherently\ndisabled...It is the interaction of their physical or mental limitations\nwith social and environmental factors that determines whether they\nhave a disability.\"& The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\ndefined disability as a \"a physical or mental impairment that substan-\ntially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individ-\nual.\"' Almost fifty million Americans have a disability according to\nU.S. Department of Education estimates. \nGovernment agencies have applied these definitions in multiple\nways to identify persons who qualify for specific government pro-\ngrams. The Social Security Act, for example, requires the use of one\nof the most restrictive criteria to determine who qualifies for disabil-\nity benefits, primarily because its definition of disability incorpo-\nrates vocational criteria.  Workers' compensation law defines dis-\nability more broadly as \"reduced capacity to perform the activities of\ndaily living or work.\" The Department of Education uses a two-part\nqualification criterion to administer the Individuals with Disabili-\nties Education Act (IDEA). According to the IDEA criterion, the\nchild must have one or more of a specified list of disabilities but also\nbe evaluated by a team of educators to determine if special education\nand related services are required. !\nNavigating A Convoluted System\nPersons who need access to multiple programs are most likely to\nfind that each program has different eligibility criteria, has different\nsets of providers, and is not organizationally linked. Very simply,\nthese persons will be on their own to coordinate most of the services\nthey receive and will find baffling inconsistencies about which serv-\nices are covered and which are not. Only the most aggressive will\nreceive all of the services they are entitled to.\nWe used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to ex-\namine the number and characteristics of persons who have one or\nmore chronic illnesses, functional limitations, or disabilities. \" Ac-\ncording to our analysis, 128.2 million noninstitutionalized Ameri-\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ N o v e m b e r / D e c e m b e r 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The 141 million\npersons with no chronic conditions, functional limitations, or dis-\nabilities in 1996 had the lowest direct medical and indirect costs,\nhad the least amount of health care use, and were most likely to be\nworking or in school (Exhibit 2). # For the 87.8 million Americans\nwith chronic conditions only, their costs and use of services was\ngreater, and their school and work attendance was lower. For the\n21.5 million Americans with one or more chronic conditions and a\ndisability, the costs and utilization are nearly double, and the per-\ncentage going to work or school is nearly half the rate of those with\na chronic condition only. The 9.5 million Americans with one or\nmore chronic conditions, disabilities, or functional limitations have\ncosts that are approximately sixteen times greater than those with-\nout any chronic conditions, disabilities, or functional limitations;\nare ten times more likely to be hospitalized; are twice as likely to use\nphysician services and prescription drugs; and are one-sixth as\nlikely to be in school or working.\nI Characteristics of persons with more severe problems.

Most of the differences were an-\nticipated: For example, a much lower percentage of people over age\nsixty-five were working or in school. The analysis by age did show\none surprising difference: Children with disabilities and functional\nlimitations appeared to have greater difficulty carrying out their\ndaily activities than adults (ages 18\u00ad64) did, perhaps because dis-\nabled children are likely to have developmental difficulties, particu-\nlarly mental retardation, that inhibits normal school progress.\nDelivery System Challenges\nA challenge to policymakers in the coming decades will be to make\nit easier for persons with special medical and supportive needs to\nreceive appropriate care. A wide range of experts have suggested\nthat persons with special medical and supportive care needs would\nbenefit if medical, disability, and supportive services were better\ncoordinated.

The following section focuses on two factors: (1)\neligibility and coverage standards, and (2) professional culture.\nI Different eligibility and coverage standards. Different eligi-\nbility standards can make it difficult for a person with multiple\nspecial medical and supportive care needs to receive appropriate\ncare. Most supportive services are means-tested, most medical serv-\nices are not, and most disability income programs are dependent on\nthe person's ability to return to work or school.\nReturn-to-work incentive. In the United States, a key driver in the\ndesign of disability programs is the concern that cash payments will\nerode work incentives. The primary objective of most disability\nincome-support programs is to have people return to work as soon\nas possible. Workers' compensation experts have expressed con-\ncern that the duration of medical services or rehabilitation services\nmay be limited to accomplish this. % The push to return people to\nwork can also impede access to medical services because of the\neligibility link between income support and medical services. For\nexample, the loss of Medicaid benefits typically is associated with a\ndetermination that the person no longer qualifies for Supplemental\nSecurity Income (SSI) benefits. As a result, there is concern that\nhealth insurance may not be available once the person has returned\nto work. Programs such as Ticket to Work and new Medicaid pay-\nment options are recent attempts to rectify this problem.\nFunding \"games.\" A second problem is that funding for different\nservices often comes from different programs. Unfortunately, most\nprograms have a financial incentive to shift expenditures from their\nprogram to other programs. For example, the parents of a child who\nqualifies for both Medicaid and special education could find them-\nselves negotiating with both programs, each of which wants the\nother program to pay a larger share of the cost. These funding\n\"games\" are also played across different levels of government. For\nexample, states may encourage providers to substitute services that\nare covered by Medicare for services covered by Medicaid even\nwhen the person could do equally as well with a lower-cost service\nthat is covered by Medicaid. &\nDifferent payment systems. A third problem is that different third-\nparty payers use different payment systems to reimburse providers.\nWorkers' compensation programs, for example, typically pay much\nmore than Medicaid programs do. As a result, providers may have\ndifferent financial incentives to treat patients in different ways de-\npending on the funding source.\nPerhaps less well known is that individual third-party payers also\nuse different payment systems for different types of providers. This\ncan make coordination of care across providers difficult. The March\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ N o v e m b e r / D e c e m b e r 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\n2001 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) report,\nfor example, lists eleven different payment systems used by Medi-\ncare to pay its providers. ' This report identifies three problems that\ncould affect Medicare beneficiaries if the payment systems are not\naligned and rates not set appropriately. First, if some payments are\nset too high and others set too low, then \"providers have incentives\nto shift the mix of services they produce towards relatively profit-\nable services and away from unprofitable ones.\" Second, when rates\nare set too high or too low, providers have incentives to furnish too\nmany units, \"exposing patients to unnecessary health risks,\" or too\nfew units, causing providers to \"limit patients' access to care or stint\non the services.\" Third, in the absence of risk adjusters for managed\ncare plans, \"providers have incentives to engage in risk selection,\nseeking only the least costly patients and avoiding those who are\nexpected to need unusually expensive care.\"\nCoordination of care. Another problem is that most payment sys-\ntems do not explicitly reimburse any provider for coordination of\ncare. Instead, the coordination function is included in the evaluation\nand management fee that clinicians may receive as part of a visit.\nThis fee is not dependent on the number of chronic conditions a\nperson has or the number of clinicians involved. As a result, some\nclinicians may be unwilling to undertake the considerable effort to\ncoordinate care across multiple clinicians and institutions.\nManaged care plans could improve coordination of care. How-\never, staff and group models--which were organized to emphasize\ncoordination of care--have not emerged as the dominant organiza-\ntional approach. The fastest-growing forms of managed care, inde-\npendent practice associations (IPAs) and preferred provider organi-\nzations, have not focused on coordination of care.\nOne approach that could improve coordination across different\nprograms is to give individuals greater autonomy over their spend-\ning. For example, the Cash and Counseling Demonstration and\nEvaluation operated by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and\nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is an attempt to\nintegrate income support and service benefits. Cash and counseling\nprograms are intended to educate Medicaid beneficiaries about the\nrange of available services and thereby give them greater choice and\nfreedom in obtaining the assistive services they need. This includes\npurchasing services such as transportation or hiring family members\n\"Most payment systems do not explicitly reimburse any provider\nfor coordination of care.\"\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~\nV o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 6\nC o o r d i n a t i o n O f C a r e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Although cash payments are designed to\ncover services, they can be used to support family members as\ncaregivers, thus indirectly providing additional family income. Par-\nticipants can carry over their cash benefits in special accounts, which\nenables them to save for a time when extra services may be required.!\nI Professional culture. Most services and treatment protocols\nare now organized to take care of medical \"episodes,\" not ongoing\ncare. The typical physician generally thinks in terms of his or her\n\"day's appointments.\" Most of these appointments are triggered be-\ncause a patient with a chronic condition has an immediate medical\nproblem. The strength of this approach is that it is strongly oriented\ntoward problem solving, at which most physicians are adept. This is\nhow medical school and residency programs train physicians, and\npayment systems reinforce it. Unfortunately, the model does not\nwork well for persons with chronic conditions, because the focus is\non \"appointments\" and not on people. This focus often means that\nthe same physician may not see that person when the next problem\noccurs. Ten percent of persons with chronic conditions report that\nthey do not have a usual source of care.!\nMore training is needed in ambulatory care settings, where ongo-\ning care of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and disabili-\nties can be emphasized. Medical school curricula and residency\ntraining are being slowly revised to respond to the growing number\nof persons with chronic conditions. The American Academy of Pedi-\natrics (AAP), for example, recently published a comprehensive re-\nview of pediatrics education that calls for major changes in pediatric\neducation.! The AAP recognizes that \"although pediatricians in\npast decades spent much of their time dealing with acute illnesses,\nthe care of patients with chronic conditions is now beginning to\ndominate many pediatric practices.\" Similar efforts are occurring in\nother medical specialties and among medical school deans.\nAchieving Coordination And Integration\nThe medical, supportive care, and disability systems need to provide\nbetter services to persons with chronic conditions, functional limi-\ntations, and disabilities. First, it is important for coordination to\noccur within each sector. The more difficult challenge, however, will\nbe to integrate programs across the three. One approach is to create\nintegrated financing and delivery programs. For example, the social\nhealth maintenance organization (S/HMO) and Program of All-\nInclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) models integrate acute care\nand some coverage for long-term care into one delivery system. A\nnumber of states are experimenting with integration approaches for\nfrail populations who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ N o v e m b e r / D e c e m b e r 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This may be appropriate for some people as long as\nthey and their providers have the requisite information. Cash and\nCounseling, Ticket to Work, and linkages between SSI and Medic-\naid are other examples.\nIf coordination within and across the programs is so important,\nwhy is it not happening more regularly? One explanation is that\nindividual programs have their own constituencies. Long-term care,\nmedical care, and disability income-support programs have different\norientations and supporters. Providers develop around these pro-\ngrams and form a second constituency for the status quo.\nThe problems of care coordination are subtle, and often the issue\ndoes not capture the attention of the public until they personally face\ncomplex coordination problems. Also, while many people see the\nproblems caused by poor coordination, they generally do not have\nenough knowledge to frame possible solutions. Without a demand\n\"push\" for improvements by the public, changes will occur slowly.\nPolicymakers need to take the lead in crafting solu-\ntions. Because so many of those with special medical and sup-\nportive care needs are covered by government programs, gov-\nernment policymakers can help to identify specific solutions.\nBreaking down government \"silos\" that inhibit integration across\nmultiple programs is one approach. It is also critical for actual\nproviders of care and the leaders of health care delivery organiza-\ntions to devise creative organizational solutions to meet the care\nneeds of this population. For the system to change substantially, the\npublic, policymakers, and providers will all need to recognize the\nnumber of people having difficulties with the current system and\ninitiate solutions.\nThis work was supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as part of the\nproject Partnership for Solutions: Better Lives for People with Chronic Condi-\ntions.\nNOTES\n1. How each of these numbers was derived is explained later in the paper.\n2. In this paper a chronic condition is one that has lasted or is expected to last\ntwelve months or longer and either requires ongoing medical care or places\nlimitations on at least one of the following: age-appropriate task performance,\nbasic self-care, independent living skills, or social interactions.\n3.

For aged Medicare\nbeneficiaries who were classified as having a chronic condition, we counted\nthe number of visits to different physicians during the year. Some visits may\nnot have been related to the chronic condition, but this cannot be ascertained\nfrom the claims data.\n6. Harris Interactive conducted a nationally representative telephone survey of\ndetermine if they had a chronic condition. They were given the same definition\nof a chronic condition as in Note 2. Those with a chronic condition were asked\na series of questions about their interaction with the health care system. Based\nupon the number of people who responded that they had a chronic condition\nand the percentage who said they had a problem with the health care system,\nwe estimated the number of Americans with a particular problem with the\nhealth care system.

Functional limitations were\ndefined as the need for help or supervision with any ADLs or IADLs. Disability\nwas defined by either (1) the use of assistive technology; (2) difficulty walking,\nclimbing stairs, grasping objects, reaching overhead, lifting, bending or top-\nping, or standing for long periods of time; (3) any limitation in work, house-\nwork, or school; (4) social/recreational limitations; (5) cognitive limitations\nsuch as confusion or memory loss, problems making decisions, or requiring\nsupervision for their own safety; (6) vision problems, such as blindness, inabil-\nity to read newsprint or recognize familiar people; (7) deafness or difficulty\nhearing; (8) age-related limitations for children; or (9) presence of a physical\nor mental health problem that limited school attendance or required a special\nschool program for children.\n25. Indirect medical cost was calculated using a human capital approach--for\nexample, work hours lost multiplied by the wage rate for that person.\n26. W.N.
