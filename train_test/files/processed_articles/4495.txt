    "abstract": "Abstract\nOver the past two decades, researchers have described many facets of forgiveness. Presently, we explore the mood regulatory\nproperties of forgiveness. The mental and physical health benefits associated with forgiveness are well documented, and it\nhas been suggested that these benefits may be due to the negative affect regulating properties of forgiveness. However,\nthe relationship between forgiveness and negative affect has not been studied experimentally. We conducted three studies\ndesigned to explore the relationship between mood and forgiveness. Results showed that participants induced with a\nnegative mood were more likely to forgive a hypothetical transgression than those in a neutral mood, a moderate level of\nnegativity was associated with a greater likelihood of forgiveness, and participants who forgave a hypothetical transgression\nexperienced less negative affect than participants who did not forgive. Implications of the present results and directions for\nfuture research are discussed.\n",

It warms the heart and cools the\nsting.\n--William Arthur Ward\nWard's quote suggests that forgiveness can not only\ninduce positive feelings, but alleviate the psychological pain\nresulting from an interpersonal transgression. Although\nWard was perhaps speaking metaphorically, there is a sub-\nstantial body of research linking forgiveness to physical and\nphysiological well-being (e.g., Hannon, Finkel, Kumashiro,\nWitvliet, Pietrini, & Miller, 2007). While forgiving is known\nto reduce negative feelings, resentment, and vindictive moti-\nvations toward a transgressor (Worthington, 2006;\nWorthington et al., 2007), much less is known about the rela-\ntionship between forgiveness and negative affect more gen-\nerally. It is important to fill this gap in the literature, because\nthe nature of this relationship has important implications for\nnot only how forgiveness is conceptualized, but also for\nunderstanding its origins.\nOur primary objective in this research is to explore the\nreciprocal relationship between negative affect and forgive-\nness--specifically, to test whether experiencing a negative\naffective state increases the likelihood of forgiveness, and\nwhether forgiving can reduce negative affect. After a brief\nliterature review, we present a series of studies designed to\nanswer three questions about the relationship between nega-\ntive affect and forgiveness: First, are people in a negative\nmood more likely to forgive a hypothetical transgressor?\nSecond, what is the affective range in which this effect occurs\n(i.e., does it occur with minor, moderate, and/or extreme bad\nmoods)? Third, can forgiving improve a negative mood? In\nanswering these questions, we aim to contribute to the for-\ngiveness literature by expanding the range of constructs\nknown to affect (and be affected by) forgiveness, advance\nthe debate on whether forgiveness is altruistic, and to con-\ntribute to the discussion of the origins and purposes of\nforgiveness.\nForgiveness has traditionally been defined via dictionar-\nies as ceasing to feel anger or resentment against an offender,\nor forgoing a desire for revenge or restitution for a wrongdo-\ning (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2011).

This definition provides distinction from similar, but\nnon-forgiveness-related constructs (such as pardoning, rec-\nonciling, condoning, forgetting, and excusing) while tapping\ninto the motivational components of forgiveness\n(McCullough & Witvliet, 2001). Theoretically, forgiveness\nhas been conceptualized as a transition from negative to pos-\nitive affect, feelings, and behaviors toward a transgressor\nover time (Enright & The Human Development Study Group,\nargue that this affective transition need not be restricted to a\nspecific target (i.e., a transgressor), but can occur more gen-\nerally as well. Specifically, we suggest that the tendency to\nforgive is enhanced by negative affect, and that the act of\nforgiving can alleviate or lessen a negative moodstate.\nWe focus on two important conceptualizations of mood.\nFirst, mood is a person's ephemeral, subjectively perceived\naffective state (Isen, Clark, & Schwartz, 1976). Second,\nmood is not directed at a specific person or situation (namely,\nthe transgressor or the transgression; Clark & Isen 1982).\nThere are theoretical grounds on which to hypothesize that\nexperiencing a negative mood will increase the likelihood of\nforgiveness. The foundation of this supposition is that people\nare motivated to improve or repair a bad mood (Wegner &\nPennebaker, 1993). Many of our behaviors and thoughts are\nrooted in the simple motivation to experience more positive\nthan negative affect (Larsen, 2000). These behaviors need\nnot necessarily be conscious or explicit. We describe some\npossible mechanisms through which the experience of a neg-\native mood should increase the likelihood of forgiving.\nPeople can improve a negative moodstate by pursuing\nstrategies such as helping others or behaving prosocially.\nAccording to the negative state relief model, when people\nexperience negative affect or emotions, they will behave in a\nprosocial manner in an attempt to repair their mood (Cialdini,\nDarby, & Vincent, 1973). Since its inception, numerous stud-\nies have supported the model (e.g., Cialdini & Kenrick,\nand amplified by Taylor (1991) is that positive affective\nstates will be sought and maintained, whereas negative affec-\ntive states will be avoided or repaired. The prosocial motiva-\ntional component of forgiveness (e.g., McCullough, Fincham,\nviable strategy for mood reparation or improvement.\nFurthermore, Morris (1992) suggested that moods serve\nas an indicator of what is wrong or right with one's internal\nsystems, and those systems can be regulated by altering or\nchanging the environment (Larsen, 2000). Negative moods\nsuggest the presence of a stressor (Eckenrode, 1984), signal-\ning the need for its elimination via environmental change.\nThis type of regulatory behavior may explain the mental and\nphysical health benefits of forgiveness. For instance,\nless forgiving individuals displayed stronger sympathetic\nnervous system activation and stress reactions than those\nwho are more forgiving (Witvliet et al., 2001). Forgiving\nindividuals also report better mental health than those who\nare unforgiving, including employment of better coping\nstrategies (Pargament & Rye, 1998) and reports of greater\nlife satisfaction (Maltby, Day, & Barber, 2004). Given the\nrobust stress-reducing properties of forgiveness (Lawler et\nal., 2003), we suggest it is a likely candidate for the type of\naffect regulation mentioned hereinbefore. If this is the case,\nindividuals in a negative mood should be more likely to for-\ngive (given the opportunity) than individuals who are in a\nneutral mood.\nOverview\nIn Study 1, we experimentally manipulated mood to test the\nimpact that a negative mood has on forgiveness likelihood.\nGiven the stress- and negative affect\u00adreducing properties of\nforgiveness coupled with the principles of negative state\nrelief, we predict that participants induced with a negative\nmood will be more likely to forgive relative to those in a\ncontrol condition (Hypothesis 1).\nWe also note that the relationship between personality and\nforgiveness has been extensively documented, revealing that\nforgiveness is positively related to agreeableness (Berry,\nWorthington, Parrott, O'Connor, & Wade, 2001; Brose, Rye,\nLutz-Zois, & Ross, 2005) and negatively related to neuroti-\ncism (Berry et al., 2001). The relationship between conscien-\ntiousness and forgiveness is less well-established, with some\nresearchers reporting a relationship between the two con-\ning a weak or nonexistent relationship (e.g., Brose et al.,\nableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness to control for\nthese factors in Study 1.\nMethod\nundergraduate students from a large Southwestern university\nwho participated for partial course credit. To avoid problems\nassociated with too much or too little statistical power, we\nencourage focus on effect size figures not affected by sample\nsize, including Cohen's d and regression betas. We addition-\nally report conventional p values, per American Psychologi-\ncal Association (APA) guidelines. Ethnic makeup of the\nother or unspecified ethnicity. Mean participant age was 19.5\nyears.\nMaterials. The survey packet contained a demographic sur-\nvey, a personality measure, a mood manipulation, and the\nMarks et al. 3\ndependent forgiveness measure. The personality measures\nconsisted of the agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neu-\nroticism scales from the Big-5 Personality Inventory (BFI;\nJohn, Donahue, & Kentle, 1991). The mood manipulation\nconsisted of a set of news headlines established as effective\nby Trafimow, Bromgard, Finlay, and Ketelaar (2005). The\nneutral headlines consisted of news stories about an airport\nand a restaurant, and the negative headlines consisted of sto-\nries about a nation's rampant starvation and a school shoot-\ning. Participants in the neutral and negative conditions read\nthe respective set of headlines. To ensure participants read\nand understood the headlines, they were asked to write a one-\nor two-sentence summary of the headlines immediately after\nreading each one.\nThe dependent measure was the 10-item Forgiveness\nLikelihood Scale (FLS; Rye et al., 2001), in which respon-\ndents are instructed to imagine that they have experienced a\nvariety of transgressions, and then indicate the likelihood that\nthey would forgive the transgressor in each case. Sample items\ninclude, \"A friend borrows your most valued possession, and\nthen loses it. The friend refuses to replace it. What is the likeli-\nhood that you would choose to forgive your friend?\" and \"A\nstranger breaks into your house and steals a substantial sum of\nmoney from you. What is the likelihood that you would choose\nto forgive the stranger?\" The scale uses a 5-point Likert-type\nformat ranging from not at all likely to extremely likely, with\nhigher scores indicating a greater likelihood of forgiving. The\nFLS was chosen due to an optimum balance of brevity, sound\npsychometric properties, adequate reliability, and strong con-\nvergent validity with other established measures of forgive-\nness (including the 60-item Enright Forgiveness Inventory\n[EFI; Subkoviak\net al., 1995], which measures positive and negative affect,\ncognitions, and behavior toward an offender; Rye et al., 2001).\nProcedure. On arrival to the lab, an experimenter gave par-\nticipants a short overview of the study. After granting con-\nsent, participants read and summarized the condition-specific\nset of headlines, then completed the forgiveness measure. On\ncompleting the study, participants were fully debriefed,\nthanked, and dismissed.\nResults and Discussion\nIn the present sample, reliability for the FLS was adequate\n(Cronbach's  = .82). In the main analysis, an independent-\nsamples t test on FLS scores was conducted. As predicted,\nparticipants in the negative mood condition (M = 2.82, SD =\n0.72) were more likely to forgive than those in the neutral\nd = .22, supporting Hypothesis 1 (see Table 1). Participant\nsex was not related to FLS scores.\nAnalysis of the personality variables revealed that forgive-\nness likelihood was negatively correlated with neuroticism\n(r = -.18. p < .001), positively correlated with agreeableness\n(r = .21. p < .001), and uncorrelated with conscientiousness\n(see Table 2).As such, we performed a supplementary analysis\nto test the effects of the mood manipulation while controlling\nfor personality and other demographic variables. After con-\nfirming there were no violations of linearity, normality, and\nmulticollinearity, a simultaneous regression was performed,\nwith FLS score regressed on mood, personality (neuroticism\nand agreeableness), and demographic variables (ethnicity, age,\nand sex). The overall model explained approximately 7% of\ntendency to forgive (see Table 3), suggesting that participants'\nmood affected their tendency to forgive independent of per-\nsonality and demographics. A subsequent hierarchical regres-\nsion analysis on the same six predictors revealed no higher\norder interactions between mood and any of the predictors.\nThe results of Study 1 support our hypothesis that the\ninduction of a negative mood would lead to a greater likeli-\nhood of forgiving.Although this finding supports our hypoth-\neses and establishes causation, the study has two limitations.\nTable 1.

CI = confidence interval.\nFirst, the affective experience felt by the participants in the\nnegative condition may have been closer to an emotional\nexperience (resulting from the negatively valanced stimuli)\nrather than a more general affective state. Second, although\nwe ensured participants read and understood the mood\nmanipulation, we did not conduct a more overt manipulation\ncheck (out of concern that the manipulation check would\nprime mood) to ensure the participants were actually experi-\nencing a negative mood. To address these two limitations, we\nconducted a quasi-experimental study designed to capture\nthe likelihood of forgiving across a more naturally occurring\n(i.e., nonmanipulated) range of moods.\nBecause the disposition to forgive is negatively related to\nanger and hostility (Tangney, Fee, Reinsmith, Boone, & Lee,\n1999), we predict that the effects of mood on forgiveness\nwill be most robust at slight or moderate levels of negativity.\nSpecifically, Tangney et al.'s (1999) finding suggests that\nforgiveness is not likely at high levels of negative affect.\nBased on this finding and the results of Study 1, it is unclear,\nthen, whether the relationship between negative mood and\nforgiveness likelihood is strongest at low or moderate levels\nof negativity. If the effect is most robust at a low level of\nnegative affect, the regression will reveal either a negative\nlinear or a concave down J-shaped function (Hypothesis 2a)\npeaking at the low end of the negativity dimension. If the\neffect is most robust at a moderate level of negative affect,\nthe regression will reveal a concave down, U-shaped func-\ntion (Hypothesis 2b) peaking near the center of the negativity\ndistribution. Although we do not make predictions related to\npositive affect, we include positive affect in the analyses for\nexploratory purposes.\nMethod\nunspecified) undergraduate students from a large Southwest-\nern university who participated for partial course credit.

We counterbalanced the order of\nissue of the FLS and PANAS across participants. Participants\nalso provided demographic information.\nProcedure.

After confirming there were no violations of\nnormality and multicollinearity, we conducted a hierarchical\npolynomial regression with the FLS mean as the outcome\nvariable. To test for hypothesized curvilinear relationship,\nwe entered linear (Step 1) and quadratic (Step 2) terms for\nboth PANAS dimensions into the equation. In Step 1, the\nmodel explained 2% of the variance in FLS scores. In Step 2,\nadding the quadratic terms resulted in an 11% increase in\nvariance explained, F\nchange\nThe final model thus explained 13% of the variance in FLS\ndratic term entered in Step 2 was significant, B = -0.68, t(62)\nThese results reveal a concave down U-shaped function,\nwith forgiveness likelihood peaking near 2 of the negative\nPANAS distribution (responses ranged from 1 to 3.2), sup-\nporting Hypothesis 2b and failing to support Hypothesis 2a\n(which predicted a negative linear or a concave down,\nJ-shaped function, which the data did not fit).\nThe results of Study 2 further support our claim that nega-\ntive affect is positively related to forgiveness. Furthermore,\nthe fact that mood was not experimentally manipulated sup-\nports the claim that sadness or anger that might have resulted\nfrom the negative condition stimuli did not drive the effect\nfound in Study 1. The final question we aim to answer is that\nof whether forgiving can reduce negative affect. To answer\nthis question, we measured participants' baseline mood,\ninstructed them to forgive or not to forgive, and then mea-\nsured their mood postmanipulation. Given our earlier discus-\nsion of the well-documented health benefits associated with\nforgiving, we predict that participants who forgive will expe-\nrience a reduction in (or comparatively less) negative affect\nMarks et al. 5\nrelative to participants who do not forgive (Hypothesis 3).\nAlthough we do not make predictions related to positive\naffect, we include positive affect in the analyses for explor-\natory purposes.\nMethod\nspecified) undergraduate students from a large Southwestern\nuniversity who participated for partial course credit.

Participants then completed a demographics\nsection, completed the premanipulation PANAS, responded\nto the forgiveness manipulation, and finally completed the\npostmanipulation PANAS. After completing the study, par-\nticipants were thanked, debriefed, and dismissed.\nResults and Discussion\nReliability coefficients for pre- and postmanipulation posi-\nrespectively) PANAS scores were adequate. We initially con-\nducted two independent-samples t tests comparing pre- and\npostmanipulation negative and positive scores. See Table 5 for\ndescriptive statistics. There were no differences between the\nnegative (d = .09) or positive (d = -.16) premanipulation\nscores of the forgiveness and nonforgiveness groups.\nRegarding the postmanipulation negative scale scores, par-\nticipants who forgave reported marginally less negative\naffect (M = 1.53, SD = .45) than those who did not forgive\nwere no differences in postmanipulation positive scores\nbetween the two groups (d = -.27, ns).\nWe also compared pre- and postforgiveness scores within\ncondition to assess the degree of affective change associated\nwith forgiving and not forgiving. For participants who did\nnot forgive, positive PANAS scores decreased postmanipula-\nscores did not change (see Figure 1).\nTwo noteworthy effects occurred in Study 3. First, in par-\ntial support of Hypothesis 3, participants who forgave\nreported marginally less negative affect than those who did\nnot forgive. Second, regarding within-condition change, par-\nticipants who did not forgive reported a significant decrease\nin positive affect following the manipulation.\nAt face value, the first finding implies that those who for-\ngive will, after the decision point (of deciding to forgive or\nnot), experience less negative affect than those who do not\nforgive. To more fully understand this effect, we must con-\nsider how the PANAS scores changed from pre- to postma-\nnipulation. Participants who did not forgive experienced a\nTable 5.

In sum, the results\nof Study 3 suggest that the effect of forgiveness on affect is\ntwofold: Forgiveness reduces negative affect more than not\nforgiving, while simultaneously buffering against decreases\nin positive affect following a decision not to forgive.\nGeneral Discussion\nDespite an increase in forgiveness research in the last two\ndecades, the relationship between mood and forgiveness is still\nambiguous. The primary objective of the present research was\nto address this gap in the literature by exploring the mood regu-\nlatory properties of forgiveness. In Study 1, participants induced\nwith a negative mood were more likely to forgive compared\nwith participants in a neutral mood. In Study 2, participants\nexperiencing a moderate amount of negative affect were most\nlikely to forgive. In Study 3, participants instructed to forgive a\nhypothetical offense reported marginally less negative affect\nthan those who did not forgive, and did not experience a reduc-\ntion in positive as did participants instructed not to forgive.\nOverall, effect sizes in the present research were small.\nAltogether, the present results help support the claim that\nforgiveness has mood regulatory properties. This claim is\ncompatible with theorizing that forgiveness is rooted in emo-\ntions (e.g., Worthington & Wade, 1999). Worthington and\nScherer (2004) described a process called emotional forgive-\nness whereby the construct known as unforgiveness (the\ncomposite of negative emotions, feelings, and motivations\ntoward a transgressor) is replaced with positive, other-ori-\nented emotions like empathy or compassion (Worthington,\nUnforgiveness is characterized as a stress reaction (Harris &\nhaving health consequences similar to those caused by\nchronic stress (see Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, & Miller, 2007).\nThus, one implication of the present results is that the stress-\nreducing capabilities of forgiveness may extend beyond the\nalleviation of transgressor-focused stressors, and apply to\nstressors more generally.\nThe conceptualization of forgiveness as having mood\nregulatory capabilities raises the question of the primary\nfunction of forgiveness: Is forgiveness primarily a means of\nrepairing relationships through the overcoming of transgres-\nsions, or is it a self-preservation mechanism? In other words,\ndo people forgive others because of primarily relational and\npersonal reasons? Or do people forgive as a more implicit\nmeans of regulating their stress levels and maintaining their\nphysical health? Although we note that these two functions\nneed not be mutually exclusive, the veracity of the latter\nexplanation is supported by the present results. This has\nimplications for evolutionary perspectives on forgiveness.\nMost contemporary evolutionary perspectives on forgive-\nness focus on the adaptive behavioral advantages offered by\nforgiveness, such as choosing the optimal response following a\ntransgression (Godfray, 1992), or curtailing an escalating series\nof retaliations that might otherwise result in death or grievous\ninjury to one or all parties involved (see Enright, 1996;\nMcCullough, Kurzban, & Tabak, 2010; Newberg, d'Aquili,\nNewberg, & deMarici, 2000). However, another possible adap-\ntive advantage of forgiveness is better health via the reduction of\ninternal stressors. The suppressive effects of chronic stress on\nthe immune system are well documented (see Segerstrom &\nMiller, 2004). Indeed, state forgiveness (the act of forgiving) is\ncorrelated with reduced stress and negative affect (Lawler et al.,\n2005). The present results lend experimental support to these\nfindings, strengthening the claim that forgiveness offers better\nhealth via the reduction of stress reactions, not only in response\nto an offense, but more generally as well. In sum, forgiveness\nmay not only have been physically adaptive in the environment\nof evolutionary adaptedness, but physiologically as well, bene-\nfits which continue today.\nTaken as a whole, the body of empirical evidence gath-\nered thus far raises the question of whether forgiveness is\naltruistic or egoistic. Some researchers have argued against\nthe possibility of there being \"true\" altruism, as there are\ngenerally self-rewards (e.g., good feelings, avoiding nega-\ntive feelings such as guilt) that occur whenever a person\nhelps or assists others (see Batson, 1998, for a review). Our\nresults suggest that the primary (or at least much of the) ben-\nefit in forgiving may be for the actor, and not the recipient of\nforgiveness. If one strictly defines altruism as selfless behav-\nior with no benefits for the actor, it is logically impossible to\ndefine forgiveness as altruistic. Even if one defines altruism\nin a less absolute sense, such as a behavior in which the ben-\nefits for the recipient outweigh or are greater than those\ngained by the actor, it still may be a philosophical and empir-\nical challenge to declare forgiveness as altruistic.\nIn summary, the present results contribute to the concep-\ntualization of forgiveness as a rich, multifaceted system of\nbehaviors, thoughts, and motivations that impact and interact\nwith many areas of human life. In the debate concerning the\nnature, function, and purpose of forgiveness, there may be\nveracity toward most, if not all, of the ways that forgiveness\nhas been theoretically conceptualized.\nFigure 1. Positive and negative affect pre- and postforgiveness\nmanipulation.\nNote. Error bars represent two standard errors.\nMarks et al. 7\nLimitations and Directions for Future Research\nAlthough the present research provides a novel perspective\nwith which to study forgiveness, there are several limitations\nthat future research might address. The survey-based, hypo-\nthetical nature of the present research lacks context that may\ninfluence how individuals think about and cope with actual\ntransgressions and transgressors. The severity of an offense,\nfor instance, may be a strong determinant of whether forgive-\nness is granted. Other important factors may include the\nquality and nature of the relationship between the transgres-\nsor and the victim, the amount of time that has passed since\nthe transgression, and the victim's subjective perception of\nthe offense. All of these factors may interact with each other\nto varying degrees as well. Future research should examine\nthe degree to which these factors mediate or moderate the\nmood effects reported in the present research.\nA further limitation of the present research was that the\nresults were generally characterized by small effect sizes.\nOne possible reason for this outcome is that the PANAS is a\ngeneral measure of affect positivity and negativity. Such a\nmeasure may not fully tap into the mechanisms responsible\nfor the effects in the present research. Future research might\nmake use of more specific or specialized affect scales, such\nas the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule\u00adExtended\nForm (PANAS-X; Watson & Clark, 1994), which measures\n11 specific affects in addition to the two original higher order\ndimensions, or a specialized negative affect scale such as the\nState\u00adTrait Anger Scale (STAS; Spielberger, Jacobs, Russell,\n& Crane, 1983). Also related to the measures, the FLS and\nthe scenario in Study 3 contained hypothetical situations that\nmay not have had the same impact as a genuine transgres-\nsion. Asking participants to recall genuine transgressions\nthat they have actually experienced may result in stronger\neffects, as well as increase internal and ecological validity.\nFinally, our hypothesis that negative affect would be\nreduced by forgiving was not supported. There are at least\nthree plausible reasons for this lack of support. First, it is\npossible that, beyond being instructed to do so, participants\nlacked motivation to forgive, thus attenuating any possible\neffects of forgiveness. Second, it is possible that a floor effect\nwas present, whereby participants felt, on average, a low\namount of negative affect before being presented with the\nscenario. Finally, perhaps a hypothetical transgression was\nnot sufficiently strong to elicit the predicted effect. We felt\nusing the hypothetical example was justified by the control it\nallowed us to exert over the experiment (i.e., all participants\nreceived a consistent stimulus). Future research should fea-\nture genuine, participant-generated transgressions, while\ncontrolling for such factors as the severity of offense and the\nparticipants' relationship with the transgressor.\nIn conclusion, let us restate that the act of forgiveness\nclearly has many benefits, among them the reparation and\nmaintenance of relationships (McCullough, Worthington, &\nRachal, 1997), better physical and mental health (Pargament\nlife satisfaction (Maltby et al., 2004). However, all of the\nmechanisms through which these benefits are reached have\nyet to be uncovered. The various factors involved may be\nprocessed by the victim of a transgression, allowing him or\nher to make the best judgment possible when deciding\nwhether to forgive an offender. It is our contention that one\nfunction of forgiveness is an unconscious motivation stem-\nming from the desire to reduce or eliminate negative affect.\nOur results suggest that there is a small yet reliable relation-\nship between mood and forgiveness. We hope that the pres-\nent research serves as an inspirational early step in the\nexploration of this phenomenon, and that it presents new\nopportunities to understand the nature, purposes, and out-\ncomes of forgiveness.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBalliet, D.
