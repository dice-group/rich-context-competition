Ferraro, PhD\nPROBLEMS regarding the mental health of the older\npopulation are becoming increasingly severe. In the\nUnited States, the rate of suicide among individuals aged 65\nyears and older is higher than that for any other age group,\nwith men making up 85% of these suicides (Coren &\nHewitt, 1999). Indeed, mental health is closely associated to\nthe aging process for older adults. Aging has been tied with\nloss of sense of control (Mirowsky, 1995) and an increase in\ndepressive symptoms in late older adulthood (Mirowsky &\nReynolds, 2000). Understanding the factors that influence\nthe mental health of the aging population is especially im-\nportant. One such factor that is highly entangled with men-\ntal health is religious participation. Religious life and\nparticipation become increasingly important to Americans\nas they age (Dillon & Wink, 2007). The link between reli-\ngion and mental health is well established (Ellison & Levin,\nseeks to investigate if and how the relationship between\nreligious activity and mental health varies by gender.\nStudies exploring how gender affects the relationship be-\ntween religious activity and mental health are sparse and\ninconclusive (Krause, 2008). Similarly, only one study has\ninvestigated this relationship among older adults (Idler,\n1987), despite the fact that older Americans are especially\nsusceptible to losses in mental well-being and represent one\nof the fastest growing demographics. The study of religion\nand depressive symptoms by Idler (1987) found that public\nreligiosity was negatively related to depression for both\nwomen and men, but had a stronger impact for women. Al-\nthough the study by Idler (1987) was the first investigation\ninto how the effects of religious involvement on depressive\nsymptoms vary by gender for older Americans, it was not\nwithout limitations. This study used cross-sectional data,\nonly contained one dimension of mental health, was not\nnationally representative, and did not test for nonlinear\neffects.\nContemporary perspectives on gender socialization, gen-\nder roles, and aging process suggest that religious activity\nwill have a different impact on mental health for men and\nwomen (Beit-Hallahmi & Argyle, 1997). Accordingly, this\nstudy is based upon the notion that men and women hold\nunique social roles that are acquired through the process of\ngender socialization. These gender roles place men and\nwomen in very different social contexts within religious\ncommunities and hence the salutary effects of religious in-\nvolvement may vary by gender. By utilizing longitudinal\nnationally representative data, two dimensions of religious\ninvolvement (organizational and nonorganizational religios-\nity), and four dimensions of mental health (depressive symp-\ntoms, death anxiety, optimism, and self-esteem), this project\naims to answer three question regarding older Americans.\nFirst, does religious activity bolster mental health for women\nand men? Second, how does the effect of religious involve-\nment on mental health differ by gender? Finally, are there\nnonlinear effects in the relationship between religious\ninvolvement and mental health.\nReligion and Mental Health Among Older Adults: Do the\nEffects of Religious Involvement Vary by Gender?\nMichael J. McFarland\nDepartment of Sociology, University of Texas at Austin.\nObjectives. Few studies explore how the relationship between religious involvement and mental health varies by gen-\nder among the aging population. This article outlines a series of arguments concerning the effects of gender in moderating\nthe effect of religious involvement on mental health and examines them empirically.\nMethods. Using two waves (2001 and 2004) of the Religion, Aging, and Health Survey, this study estimates the dif-\nferential effect of gender in the religion\u00admental health connection using multivariate analyses for a nationally representa-\ntive sample of U.S. adults aged 66\u00ad95 years.\nResults. Results suggest that (a) men obtain more mental health benefits from religious involvement than women, (b)\nwomen with higher levels of organizational religious involvement have similar levels of mental health as those with\nmoderate and lower levels of organizational religious involvement, (c) men with very high levels of organizational reli-\ngious involvement tend to have much higher levels of mental health than all other men.\nDiscussion. The relationship between organizational religious involvement and mental health is found to be mostly a\nnonlinear one such that those with the highest levels of religiosity receive all the benefits. The findings suggest a number\nof promising research directions on the religion\u00admental health connection among older Americans.\nKey Words: Aging--Gender--Mental health--Religion.\nMCFARLAND\nTheoretical Framework\nReligion and Mental Health\nA large array of research documents the positive effect\nreligion has on mental health (Ellison & Levin, 1998;\nLarson et al., 1992), although some research suggests that\nreligion can have a deleterious impact on mental health as\nliterature proposes several mechanisms in which religious\npractices affect mental well-being (Koenig et al., 2001).\nUnderstanding the context in which religious activity af-\nfects mental health is crucial in conceptualizing how gender\nmay moderate this relationship. One mechanism, which is\nespecially important for this study, that affects mental health\nis social integration and support.\nThrough the sharing of religious belief and practices,\ncongregants often achieve a high level of social integration.\nReligious involvement may increase social integration and\nconsequently reduce suicide rates (Colucci & Martin, 2008).\nThe religious setting provides a context in which offering\nand asking for social and emotional support are both en-\ncouraged. Ferraro and Kelley-Moore (2000) show that indi-\nviduals who are the most integrated in a religious community\nare likely to seek religious consolation when enduring de-\npressive symptoms. Many religious groups provide formal\nprograms for members in need (Trinitapoli, 2005). Research\nsuggests that individuals ask for assistance more frequently\nin groups when potential support providers are sure about\neach other's obligations (Cutrona, Suhr, & MacFarlane,\n1990). Attendance at religious services conveys the mes-\nsage that other individuals share the same faith, beliefs, and\nhave a lot in common (Sosis, 2000). Accordingly, one of the\nkey forms of social support older people gain from religious\nparticipation is perceived emotion support. Krause (2008)\nshows that the anticipated level of emotional support one\nwould receive if they needed it plays a crucial role in the\nmaintenance of mental health.\nThe Possibility of Nonlinear Effects\nAn often-overlooked component in the relationship be-\ntween religious activity and mental health is the role of po-\ntential nonlinear effects. Previous work finding a linear\neffect of religious activity may in fact be masking one of\nthree theoretically justified nonlinear effects: squared,\nthreshold, or exponential. The theoretical impetus for ex-\npecting a quadratic relationship can suggest either a \"U\"\nshaped or an inverted \"U\" shaped relationship between\nmental distress and religious involvement. The \"U\" per-\nspective suggests that those with moderate levels of involve-\nment will garner the benefits (e.g., social support) without\nextracting the social cost of high levels of involvement. At\nleast two studies have found this type of nonlinear relation-\nship with self-esteem and depressive symptoms as outcomes\nperspective suggests that those who are only marginally\ncommitted to religion will fair worse in mental health out-\ncomes because of uncertainty compared with those with no\ncommitment or high levels of commitment. A study of reli-\ngious beliefs and psychological distress provides some sup-\nThe threshold perspective suggests that only at some\nlevel of religious involvement will the effects begin to man-\nifest. For example, the threshold perspective suggests that\nindividuals with low or moderate levels of religious involve-\nment may have similar levels of depressive symptoms,\nwhereas those with high levels of involvement will witness\nfewer symptoms of depression. Exponential effects suggest\nthat the effects of religious involvement will increase with\neach increase in involvement but the magnitude of this in-\ncrease will grow exponentially. Overall, research is incon-\nclusive in regards to the nonlinear relationship between\nreligious involvement and mental health.\nReligion, Gender, and Mental Health\nGender socialization suggests that boys are socialized to be\ncompetitive, aggressive, and independent, whereas girls are\ntaught to be obedient, sociable, and nurturing. Beit-Hallahmi\nand Argyle (1997) argue that women are more likely to be\nattracted to religion because many of the traits valued in\nreligion are considered feminine traits, such as obedience\nto God and the nurturing of others. Similarly, Miller and\nHoffman (1995) contend that one reason why women are\nmore religious than men is that religion is essentially risk\naverse, which resonates with behaviors associated with fe-\nmale socialization such as passivity and obedience. Women\nmay also be more religious because they are more relation-\nally restricted than men, and the religious community offers\na social setting where the formation and maintenance of\npersonal relationships are encouraged (Idler, 1987). Several\nother explanations also exist and are reviewed elsewhere\n(see Miller & Stark, 2002). Women tend to have more ex-\ntensive social ties and social support systems both within\nthe church and in secular settings than men (Ajrouch,\nBlandon, & Antonucci, 2005; Krause, Ellison, & Marcum,\n2002). Although older women are more ubiquitous in\nreligious settings, a number of studies indicate that they\noccupy more subordinate roles in these settings. For exam-\nple, Heyer-Grey (2000) finds that women are less likely\nto lead or say prayers during services, assist in communion,\nor read from the bible than men. Additionally, women are\nmore likely than men to clean up after church, work in the\nnursery, and to cook and serve meals.\nThe manner in which gender affects the relationship be-\ntween religious activity and mental health is unclear. Two\ncompeting frameworks can be drawn from the concepts of\ngender socialization, gender roles, and the aging process to\npredict how gender affects this relationship. The first sug-\ngests that women, because they develop and maintain more\nweak and strong ties in church, will benefit more from reli-\ngious involvement than men in terms of mental health and\nwell-being. The second perspective suggests that the reli-\ngious world provides a unique context in which men are\nencouraged to respond to and ask for (when needed) both\nemotional and physical support. Additionally, men may oc-\ncupy formal roles in the church that bestow social status and\nrespect, whereas women may tend to occupy more subordi-\nnate roles. The acquirement of social status and respect may\nbe especially pertinent to retired older men who seek to re-\nplace the status they once possessed via their careers.\nThe first framework suggests that women tend to make\nlarger and stronger interpersonal relationships than men,\nand because the church embraces traits associated with\nfemininity (sociability, communication skills, and nurtur-\nance), women may be able to extract more from their strong\nrelationships. Women are more likely to maintain weak ties\nthan men, and this becomes especially pronounced in reli-\ngious communities (Scott & Wenger, 1995). Older women\nare much more likely to be widowed and single than men\nand may seek out kinship in religious communities. Indeed,\nolder women are more likely to have a church-based com-\npanion friendship, to both provide and receive more social\nand emotional support and to attend bible or prayer groups\nthan their male counterparts (Krause, 2008). Bible and\nprayer groups provide an avenue for members to share per-\nsonal problems and receive sympathy as well as practical\nadvice (Wuthnow, 1994). Because women comprise the ma-\njority of members of these groups, they may be especially\napt in providing support and advice for issues common\namong women. Women tend to be more involved; therefore,\nthey may also be more likely to hear of and engage in\nchurch-related programs that can lead to better mental\nhealth (e.g., pastoral counseling). Support for this perspec-\ntive is found in a study of adults living in Indianapolis show-\ning that religious involvement decreased depressive\nsymptoms for women but not men (Mirola, 1999).\nThe contrasting framework suggests that the religious\ncontext provides a unique avenue that encourages men to\nask for help, share feelings and concerns, and engage in be-\nhaviors that in other social contexts would suggest to others\nthat they are weak. Because men are socialized to be inde-\npendent and aggressive, they are less likely to develop\nstrong social ties and interpersonal relationships than\nwomen. One of the pathways in which religion improves\nmental health is through social support. Social support is\nonly effective if it is provided in a manner that makes the\nrecipient feel comfortable (Eckenrode &Wethington, 1990),\nand this is especially the case for men who are socialized to\nbe independent. The church provides a religious context for\nmen to receive assistance in a way that is acceptable to them\n(Krause et al., 2002). Also, a religious community may pro-\nvide men with an environment where they perceive that\nemotional support is available to them if they need it. This\nperspective suggests that women are likely to have both\nsecular and church-based support systems, whereas men\ntend to rely more exclusively on church-based support. Sup-\nport found from religious involvement may be more vital to\nthe maintenance of mental health for men. Additionally,\nmen may gain more from involvement because women\nmaintain such extensive networks that they are actually del-\neterious to their mental health (i.e., the cost of caring). Sup-\nport for this perspective was found in a study of Presbyterian\nadults exploring how the effect of emotional support on\nself-reported health differed by gender. Women tended to\nhave more emotional support available to them, whereas\nmen experienced more gains in health from the emotional\nsupport available to them (Krause et al.).\nThe effects of religious involvement may vary by gender\ndue to roles men and women occupy within the church and\nthe social status that those roles confer. Social status tends\nto increase physical well-being and self-esteem (Reitzes &\nMutran, 2006) and those with higher levels of social status\ntend to deal with stress better than those of a disadvantaged\nsocial status (Kessler, 1979). Many churches emphasize\npatriarchal gender roles that are rooted in biblical doctrine\ncalling for female submission to masculine authority within\nsocial spheres. Men may witness a larger gain in mental\nhealth because they disproportionately occupy more revered\nroles that convey social status than women (Heyer-Grey,\n2000). Conversely, women tend to occupy more private and\nsubordinate roles in the church and perform tasks such as\ncleaning, cooking, and staffing the nursery.\nThe religious context may be especially important for\nmen because of the social relationships they lose from re-\ntirement. Also, retired men who have been socialized to be\ncompetitive may have a desire for power. Older men are\nmore likely than older women to have worked outside the\nhome during adulthood (Henretta, 2001). The vast majority\nof men retire by the age of 65 years and may not be able to\nmaintain the relationships they developed over the last de-\ncade. Women are less likely to have lost close ties among\nwork-related relationships because the current cohort of\nolder women was less likely to be employed outside the\nhome. Men are initially disadvantaged in terms of develop-\ning and maintaining social relationships and tend to lose the\nemployment-related relationships they have; hence, partici-\npation in a religious community may become their primary\nsource of socialization and have a stronger effect for men\nthan women. Also, the self-esteem and sense of control that\ncame with employment may slowly erode after retirement.\nAs mentioned earlier, men tend to disproportionately oc-\ncupy formal roles in the church that convey social status\nwithin the church. Social status within the church may pro-\nvide a compensatory role in the maintenance of mental\nwell-being. Evidence for this perspective is found among a\nstudy of older adults living in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel\nHill metro area where religious identity had a greater posi-\ntive impact on mental health for those who are retired than\nthose still employed (Keyes & Reitzes, 2007).\nMCFARLAND\nData and Methods\nThe data from this study come from the Religion, Ag-\ning, and Health Survey, a nationally representative longi-\ntudinal survey. The population of this study was designed\nat the baseline interview as White or Black household\nresidents, noninstitutionalized, English speaking, and at\nleast 66 years of age. Geographically, the study was lim-\nited to the contiguous United States. The study population\nwas limited to currently practicing Christians, individuals\nwho were Christians in the past but no longer practice any\nreligion, and individuals who were never associated with\nany faith.\nOne thousand five hundred baseline interviews took place\nin 2001 and were conducted by Harris Interactive. Older\nBlacks were oversampled and represented roughly half the\nsample (752 Blacks). The overall response rate for the base-\nline interviews was 62%.\nThe second wave of interviews took place in 2004 where\nsuccessfully. Among those who were not reinterviewed, 75\nrefused to participate, 112 could not be located, 70 were too\nill to participate, 11 were currently in nursing homes, and\n208 were deceased. The interview rate for the second wave\nwas 80% when those who died or living in nursing homes\nwere excluded.\nListwise deletion was used to account for non-item re-\nsponses, and the following analyses are based upon between\ngraphic landscape, survey data were weighted to account\nfor oversampling. Preliminary analyses using weighted data\nshow that roughly 58% were older women and roughly 42%\nwere older men. The average age of these individuals was\nried and roughly 9% were older Blacks and 91% older\nWhites. Finally, the average respondent had completed\napproximately 12.4 years of schooling (SD = 3.2 years).\nMeasures\nReligiosity.--Table 1 presents the survey items that com-\npose the primary variables used in this study. Previous re-\nsearch documents the lack of multidimensional measures of\nboth organizational and nonorganizational religiosity in\nwork on older adults (Krause, 1993). Consequently, this\nstudy will utilize 3-item scales for both organizational and\nnonorganizational religiosity. Organizational religiosity\ntaps the extent to which an individual engages with a public\nreligious institution. The internal consistency reliability es-\ntimate for this composite measure is .753. Nonorganizational\nreligiosity taps the extent to which an individual engages in\nprivate religious practices (i.e., usually at home). This pri-\nvate engagement with religion is especially salient for older\nAmericans, as physical limitations often restrict public reli-\ngious practices. The internal consistency reliability estimate\nTable 1. Core Study Measures\n1. Organizational religiosity (Wave 1 only)a\n A. How often do you attend adult Sunday School or Bible study groups?\n B. How often do you participate in prayer groups that are not part of\n regular worship services or Bible study groups?\n C. How often do you attend religious services?\n2. Nonorganizational religiosity (Wave 1 only)a\n A. When you are at home, how often do you read the Bible?\n B. How often do you pray by yourself?\n C. How often do you watch formal church services on TV or listen to\n them on the radio?\n3. Depression (Wave 1 and Wave 2)b\n A. I felt I could not shake off the blues even with the help of\n my family and friends.\n B. I felt depressed.\n C. I felt sad.\n D. I did not feel like eating, my appetite was poor.\n E. I felt that everything I did was an effort.\n F. My sleep was restless.\n G. I could not get going.\n4. Death anxiety (Wave 1 and Wave 2)c\n A. Thinking about death makes me feel uneasy.\n B. I do not feel prepared to face my own death.\n C. I am disturbed by the shortness of life.\n5. Optimism (Wave 1 and Wave 2)c\n A. I always look at the bright side of things.\n B. I'm optimistic about my future.\n C. In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.\n6. Self-esteem (Wave 1 and Wave 2)c\n A. I feel I am a person of worth, or at least on an equal plane with others.\n B. I feel I have a number of good qualities.\n C. I take a positive attitude toward myself.\naThese items were scored in the following manner (coding in parentheses):\nNever (1), Less than once per year (2), About once or twice per year (3), Several\ntime per year (4), About once a month (5), 2\u00ad3 times per month (6), Nearly\nevery week (7), Every week (8), Several times per week (9).\nbThese items were scored in the following manner (coding in parentheses):\nRarely or none of the time (1), Some or little of the time (2), Occasionally or a\nmoderate amount of the time (3), Most or all of the time (4).\ncThese items were scored in the following manner (coding in parentheses):\nStrongly disagree (1), Disagree (2), Agree (3), Strongly agree (4).\nThe functional forms of the religious involvement\u00admental\nhealth connection have not been verified; they may be\nlinear, quadratic, exponential, or observed only at or above\nsome threshold. Accordingly, organizational and nonorga-\nnizational religiosity are defined using three categories\n(high, medium, and low) to account for potential nonlinear\nrelationships. Those with low organizational religiosity tend\nto attend church less than once per week and rarely or never\nengage in bible or prayer groups. Those with medium val-\nues tend to attend church regularly but do not consistently\nengage in bible or prayer groups. Those with high values go\nto church regularly and consistently attend bible and prayer\ngroups. Those with low nonorganizational religiosity tend\nto rarely or never read the bible, read religious literature or\nwatch religious TV, or pray at home. Those with medium\nvalues tend to regularly do one of these things on a regular\nbasis and occasionally or never do the others. Those with\nhigh levels on nonorganizational religiosity tend to regu-\nlarly do all three things or do two regularly and the third\noccasionally.\nDepressive symptoms.--Seven indicators were used from\nthe Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to\nassess depressive symptoms. The reliability estimates for\nthis measure at Wave 1 is .866. In order to deal with issues\nregarding the distribution of this measure (high levels of\nkurtosis), the natural log of these variables was used\nthroughout this study.\nDeath anxiety.--The three items measuring death anxiety\nreflect the extent to which an individual feels anxious or\nfearful about death. Higher values reflect higher levels of\nanxiety or fear about death. The reliability estimate for this\nmeasure at Wave 1 is .868. Death anxiety represents a di-\nmension of mental health that may be most pronounced\namong the older population and be intimately tied with\nreligious beliefs and practices.\nOptimism.--Optimism is measured with three indicators.\nThe reliability estimates for this scale is .782 at Wave 1.\nHigher values reflect higher levels of optimism and mental\nhealth.\nSelf-esteem.--Feelings of self-worth were assessed with\nthree items.A higher score reflects higher levels of self-esteem.\nThe reliability estimate for this measure at Wave 1 is .900.\nFunctional limitations, health, and controls.--Functional\nmobility and physical health are closely related to mental\nhealth among older adults; hence, sufficient control variables\nmeasuring functional limitations and health are included in\nall multivariate analyses. A scale measuring functional limi-\ntations was constructed using 16-items from Wave 2 (this\nvariable is not available in Wave 1) that asks respondents if\nthey encounter difficulty when performing activities of daily\nliving such as walking, dressing, bathing, and so forth. The\nreliability estimate for this scale is .885. The self-reported\nhealth variable asked respondents how they would rate their\noverall present health. Responses varied by four categories\nfrom 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent). Controls for age, race, educa-\ntion, and marital status were also included. Race and marital\nstatus were measured as dummy variables indicating if\nthe respondent is \"Black\" or \"currently married.\" Age and\neducation were measured in years.\nWeighted means for all variables (not shown) indicate\nthat women tend to have higher values of depressive symp-\ntoms and men tend to have higher values of death anxiety.\nMen and women tend to have similar mean values of opti-\nmism and self-esteem. Women appear to be more religiously\nactive than their male counterparts in both organizational\nand nonorganizational religiosity. Nearly 20% of women in\nthe sample have high levels of organizational religious in-\nvolvement, whereas only 13% of men fall into this category.\nSimilarly, 32% of women have high levels of nonorganiza-\ntional religious activity, whereas only 16% of men fall into\nthis category.\nResults\nThe purpose of this study is to test if and how the effects\nof religiosity on mental health differ for older women and\nolder men. The mean values of the organizational and non-\norganizational variables show that older women are more\nreligious than older men. In order to test if the impact of re-\nligious involvement is different, all analyses are divided into\ntwo subpopulations: women and men. The analyses pre-\nsented here are divided up into two sections. Due to the lon-\ngitudinal design and the relatively large number of\nrespondents who were not reinterviewed at Wave 2, the first\nsection tests for attrition effects. The second section employs\nmultivariate longitudinal ordinary least squares regression\nmodels to test how the effect of religiosity varies by gender.\nAll of the effects found in multivariate models occur across\ntime controlling for the mental health outcome at Time 1.\nThe primary aim of this study is to test the claim that\nolder men obtain more mental health benefits from organi-\nzational religious participation than women. Accordingly,\nin multivariate analyses, this study implements split-sample\n(between men and women) models and tests if the regres-\nsion coefficients between models differ statistically. This\nstudy will test for these differential effects using a formula\ndevised by Clogg, Petkova, and Haritou (1995). This t test is\nof the form:\n( ) ( )\n[ ( )] [ ( )]\n-\n=\n+\nb x b y\nt\nse x se y\nwhere b(x) and b(y) represent the regression coefficients for\nmen and women and se(x) and se(y) represent their standard\nerrors. Significance implies that the effect of religious\nactivity on mental health differs by gender net of all other\nvariables in the model.\nAttrition Effects\nThe loss of subjects between Waves 1 and 2 may poten-\ntially bias results; hence, analyses that may give insight into\nif and how this is occurring are required. These analyses\nprobe how data from the baseline survey are related to study\nparticipation in Wave 2. The following procedures docu-\nment this strategy: first, a dummy variable indicating miss-\ning status, coded 1 missing and 0 not missing was created;\nthen, using logistic regression, this binary variable was re-\ngressed upon all of the Wave 1 variables mentioned earlier.\nIf any of the key independent or dependent variables in this\nstudy is significantly related to absence at Wave 2, then this\nwould suggest that further analyses are likely biased.\nResults of these analyses (not shown here) suggest that\nparticipation in Wave 2 was not a random phenomenon.\nNonparticipants at Wave 2 were more likely to be older,\nmale, unmarried, and have lower levels of educational at-\ntainment than those successfully reinterviewed. This pattern\nof findings is consistent with prior research on attrition ef-\nfects (Groves, 1989). These findings are not surprising as\nMCFARLAND\nthe majority of respondents who were not reinterviewed\nwere either deceased or too sick to participate. Significant\ndifferences in attrition effects failed to emerge for organiza-\ntional and nonorganizational religiosity, depressive symp-\ntoms, death anxiety, optimism, or self-esteem. Ancillary\nanalyses differentiated nonparticipation by indicating those\nwho were sick or deceased from those who could not be\ninterviewed for other reasons. All models were replicated\nusing a Heckman selection procedure. This differentiation\ndid not have any substantive impact on the results presented\nhere. These findings suggest that further analyses in this\nstudy are unlikely to be biased by attrition effects.\nMultivariate Analyses\nDepressive symptoms.--Models 1 and 3 in Table 2 show\nthat depressive symptoms at Time 1 are positively related to\ndepressive symptoms at Time 2 and health is negatively re-\nlated to depressive symptoms at Time 2 for both women and\nmen. For women, being Black is associated with lower lev-\nels of depressive symptoms, whereas for men, age is posi-\ntively related to depressive symptoms. Models 2 and 4 show\nthat the negative effect of high organizational religiosity is\nsignificantly different from zero for men but not for women.\nThe difference in effect size between men and women for\nhigh organizational religiosity is trending toward statistical\nsignificance (t = 1.347, p < .10). Modest levels of organiza-\ntional religiosity also decrease symptoms of depression for\nmen but not for women. These results point toward an expo-\nnential relationship between organizational involvement\nand depressive symptoms. The difference in effect size is\nfind modest support that organizational religiosity is more\nimportant for men than women and strong support that or-\nganizational religiosity shares a nonlinear relationship with\ndepressive symptoms.\nDeath anxiety.--Models 5 and 7 in Table 2 show that\ndeath anxiety at Time 1 is positively related to death anxiety\nat Time 2 for both women and men. For women, nonorgani-\nzational religiosity decreases levels of death anxiety, but\nhaving high levels of organizational religiosity increases\ndeath anxiety. For men, modest amounts of organized reli-\ngion are positively related to increased anxiety about death.\nThis finding among men suggests an inverted \"U\" shaped\nrelationship between organizational religiosity and death\nanxiety. The size (and sometimes direction) of these effects\nis statistically different for men and women. These findings\nsuggest that religious involvement is highly entangled with\ndeath anxiety and that its effects tend to play out in different\nways for men and women.\nOptimism.--Models 1 and 3 in Table 3 show that opti-\nmism and health at Wave 1 are positively related to optimism\nTable 2. Estimated Effects of Religious Activity on Depression and Death Anxiety\nDepressiona Death anxietya\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses.\naIndicates that the difference in the religious activity coefficients between women and men is statistically significant at the p  .05 level.\nTable 3. Estimated Effects of Religious Activity on Optimism and Self-Esteem\nOptimisma Self-esteema\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses.\naIndicates that the difference in the religious activity coefficients between women and men is statistically significant at the p  .05 level.\nat Wave 2. Black women tend to report higher levels of opti-\nmism than White women, whereas Black men tend to report\nlower levels of optimism than White men. Model 4 shows\nthat high levels of organizational religiosity tend to increase\noptimism over time for men. This finding suggests that there\nis a threshold effect between organizational involvement and\noptimism. The effect for women is not statistically different\nfrom zero. The difference in effect size is statistically sig-\nnificant (t = 1.961, p < .05). For women, both high and mod-\nest levels of nonorganizational religiosity increase optimism\nover time. The organizational aspects of religion are the most\nimportant for men, whereas the nonorganizational aspects\nare the most important for women.\nSelf-esteem.--Model 5 in Table 3 shows that for women,\nself-esteem at Wave 1 positively predicts self-esteem at\nWave 2 and functional limitations are negatively related to\nself-esteem. For men, none of the predictors in Model 7 are\nstatistically significant. Models 6 and 8 show that high lev-\nels of organizational religiosity are positively associated\nwith self-esteem for men only. Again, these results suggest\nthe presence of a threshold effect between organizational\ninvolvement and self-esteem. The difference in effect size\nbetween men and women is statistically significant (t =\n2.607, p < .01). This analysis suggests men with high levels\nof organizational involvement tend to receive large divi-\ndends in the form of positive mental health.\nDiscussion\nSummary\nLongitudinal multivariate models show a strong associa-\ntion between organizational religiosity and mental health\nafter controlling for health and demographic factors. For\nmen, the effects of high organizational religiosity were neg-\natively related to depressive symptoms and positively re-\nlated to optimism and self-esteem. These effects were not\nstatistically different from zero for women. For men, mod-\nerate levels of organizational religiosity had a deleterious\neffect on death anxiety. For women, both high and moderate\nlevels of nonorganizational religiosity were related to lower\nlevels of death anxiety. High levels of organizational religi-\nosity had a deleterious effect upon death anxiety for women.\nOther than death anxiety, religiosity did not have much of\nan effect on mental health outcomes among women.\nTable 4 displays the differences in the religiosity regres-\nsion coefficients between women and men. This shows\nwhether the effect of religiosity on each of the four mental\nhealth outcomes varied by gender. The most stark finding is\nthat the effect of being highly involved in organized religion\nis much different for men (usually more beneficial) than\nwomen. Although not as clear, there is also evidence to sug-\ngest that the effect of modest organizational religious involve-\nment varies by gender as well. The difference in effect size\nbetween men and women for nonorganizational religiosity is\nMCFARLAND\nstatistically different from zero when looking at death anxi-\nety. Overall, these findings provide strong support that reli-\ngious involvement has a relationship with mental health that\nvaries by gender and that men receive more mental health\nbenefits from organized religious involvement than women.\nOne of the core arguments of this paper is that men expe-\nrience and gain more from church-based social support\nwhen they share similarly high levels of religious involve-\nment as women. This proposition was tested in ancillary\nanalyses (not shown) using four dimensions of social sup-\nport: emotional support received, emotional support pro-\nvided, tangible support received, and anticipated support.\nThis perspective was partially supported as increases in re-\nligious involvement resulted in greater gains in social sup-\nport among men, but social support did not diminish the\nrelationship between high organizational religiosity and\nmental health in multivariate models. This lack of findings\nin multivariate models does not negate this framework. Pre-\nvious literature has shown that social support becomes es-\npecially important in the maintenance of mental health in\nthe presence of acute and chronic stressors (Krause, 2006).\nIncluding such stressors is outside the scope of the current\nstudy, but their absence may explain why they are seem-\ningly unrelated to mental health.\nConclusions\nThis study addresses the moderating effect of gender on\nthe religion and mental health connection among older\nadults. Organizational religiosity decreases symptoms of\ndepression and increases levels of optimism and self-esteem\nover time for men but not women. Similarly nonorganiza-\ntional religiosity decreased levels of death anxiety over time\nfor women but not men. These findings are consistent with\nthe framework that religion provides men a unique context\nin which they were able to reap more benefits from religious\nactivities than women. Organizational religious activity\n(i.e., involvement in religious services, bible groups, and\nprayer groups) appears to have a more pronounced impact\non mental health for men than women. These findings are\nbuttressed by the work of Krause and colleagues (2002),\nwhich found that women had more church-based emotional\nsupport than men, but men received a greater benefit from it\nin regards to health. Additionally, the results found here\nmay be due to the cost of caring women pay in maintaining\nvast social networks. Research shows that maintaining ex-\ntensive social networks may extract a price on mental well-\nbeing (Kessler, Price, & Wortman, 1985). If women tend to\nhave large social networks outside of the church, then the\nnetworks they have within the church may not yield any\nbenefits, and could possibly be detrimental, to their mental\nwell-being.\nThis study finds that religious involvement has a greater\nimpact on mental health for men. A number of studies\ndealing with adults have found the exact opposite, that or-\nganizational religious activity has a more pronounced ef-\nfect on mental health among women. Mirola (1999) found,\nin a sample of adults living in Indianapolis, that religious\nattendance decreases symptoms of depression for women\nbut not men. Similarly, in a sample of Mexican-origin\nadults, Ellison, Finch, Ryan, and Salinas (2009) found that\norganizational religious activity was inversely related to\ndepressive symptoms for both men and women but the re-\nlationship was much more pronounced among women.\nThese studies in which the differential impact of religion\nwas greater for women than men were not based on older\nindividuals. This study suggests that this differential rela-\ntionship between men and women may be reversed in old\nage because of the unique social contexts associated with\naging. Men at older ages (especially among the cohorts\nstudied here) are likely to be retired and have limited ave-\nnues for social engagement and contexts to obtain social\nstatus. Men are disproportionately able to acquire posi-\ntions within the church that convey social status. For men,\nthe church may serve as a compensatory device in main-\ntaining and increasing mental well-being that former ca-\nreers and jobs once served.\nThe results of this study suggest that the effects of orga-\nnizational religiosity on mental health are largely nonlinear.\nOnly the most religiously active individuals will incur men-\ntal health benefits. The important issue is that individuals\nwho have moderate levels of religious involvement do not\ntend to have different levels of mental health than those with\nlittle or no religious involvement. These findings are consis-\ntent with previous work on religious attendance and mortal-\nity among older Mexican Americans (Hill, Angel, Ellison,\nThis study has several limitations that deserve mention\nand should be considered in future research. First, this study\ndid not take into account acute and chronic stressors occurring\nTable 4. Differences in Effect Size of Religious Activity Between Men and Women\nDepression Death anxiety Optimism Self-esteem\nNote: The t statistics are given in parentheses.\nthroughout the duration of the study. The presence of\nacute or chronic stressors could have confounded the re-\nsults found here. Second, this study did not take into ac-\ncount the level of secular support available to the\nrespondent. Religious involvement may not appear to af-\nfect women's mental health because they have large secu-\nlar support networks that men do not. Finally, the\nlongitudinal data may have masked some of the effects\nfrom religious activity on mental health through temporal\nlags. As with most longitudinal analyses, more time points\nwould be beneficial.\nThe findings presented here suggest new avenues for\nresearch on religion and mental health among the aging.\nFuture work should begin exploring the specific mecha-\nnisms in which gender differences manifest themselves\nand include acute and chronic stressors as potential mod-\nerators. A broader picture of how religious involvement\ninfluences mental health throughout the life course is also\nessential. Perhaps women gain mental health benefits\nfrom religion much earlier in life than men. More work is\nrequired on different dimensions of mental health and\nto further explore the understudied concept of death\nanxiety--which has been shown to be intimately related\nto religious activity. Work on religion, gender, and mental\nhealth among the older population is still in its infancy\nand future research is needed to unravel these complex\nrelationships.\n"
