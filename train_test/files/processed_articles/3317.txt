    "abstract": "Abstract: The MHC (major histocompatibility complex) is a group of genes that play a\ncrucial role in immune recognition and in tolerance of tissue grafting. The MHC has also\nbeen found to influence body odors, body odor preferences, and mate choice in mice and\nhumans. Here we test whether verbal descriptions of human body odors can be linked to the\nMHC. We asked 45 male students to live as odor neutral as possible for two consecutive\ndays and to wear a T-shirt during the nights. The odors of these T-shirts were then\ndescribed by five evaluators: two professional perfumers and three laymen. One of the\nperfumers was able to describe the T-shirt odors in such a way that some of the allelic\nspecificity of the MHC was significantly revealed (after Bonferroni correction for multiple\ntesting). This shows that, although difficult, some people are able to describe MHC-\ncorrelated body odor components.\n",

A group of genes within the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) has been\ndemonstrated to be linked to body odors and odor preferences (reviews in Penn and Potts,\nThe MHC is also one of the most polymorphic regions of the genome and plays a central\nrole in controlling immunological self and non-self recognition (Apanius, Penn, Slev, Ruff,\nHuman noses can distinguish between two congenic inbred mouse strains that differ\nonly in their MHC (Gilbert, Yamazaki, Beauchamp and Thomas, 1986), and rodents seem\nto be able to recognize human MHC-types (Ferstl, Eggert, Westphal, Zavazava, and\nM\u00fcller-Ruchholtz, 1992). Wedekind, Seebeck, Bettens, and Paepke (1995) found that\nwomen's preference for male odors correlated negatively with the degree of similarity\nbetween their own and the men's MHC type. T-shirt odors were judged as more pleasant\nwhen they were worn by men whose MHC genotype was different from that of the judging\nwoman. This finding is analogous to findings in mice (Egid and Brown, 1989; Potts,\nFurthermore, the odors of MHC-dissimilar men more frequently reminded the\nwomen of their present or a former mate than did the odors of MHC-similar men. These\nmemory associations suggest that the MHC or linked genes still influence human mate\nchoice. A link between MHC alleles and body odor intensities could not be demonstrated\n(Wedekind, Seebeck, Bettens, and Paepke, 2006). In a second set of experiments with new\ncombinations of T-shirt wearers and smellers, Wedekind and F\u00fcri (1997) found again that\ndissimilar MHC types smell on average more pleasant than similar MHC types, and that\nagain according to the reported memory associations the MHC or linked genes influence\nmate choice today. Moreover, when men and women sniffed male and female odors, there\nwas no significant effect of gender in the correlation between pleasantness and MHC\nsimilarity. Ober, et al. (1997) then demonstrated in American Hutterites that married\ncouples were less likely to share MHC loci than expected by chance, even after incest\ntaboos were statistically controlled for, but the result could not confirmed in two other\nhuman populations (Hedrick and Black, 1997; Ihara, Aoki, Tokunaga, Takahashi, and Juji,\nMontag, et al., (2001) demonstrated that an \"electronic nose\", i.e. a chemical sensor\nsystem combined with pattern recognition software, is able to detect MHC-dependent odor\ncomponents in mice and humans. Later T-shirt experiments confirmed a link between\nMHC dissimilarity and the perception of odor pleasantness in humans (Santos,\nSchinemann, Gabardo, and Bicalho, 2005; Thornhill et al., 2003), and a recent study on\nromantic couples at the University of New Mexico suggests that as the degree of MHC\nsharing increased, women's sexual responsivity to their partners decreased (Garver-Apgar,\nGangestad, Thornhill, Miller, and Olp, 2006). Here we test whether humans can describe\nbody odors in such a way that the link to the MHC is revealed.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe asked 45 male students (average age: 24.6 years, SD = 2.6), which we had typed\nfor their HLA-A, -B and -DR (methods in Wedekind, et al. 1995, see also Appendix), to\nMHC and perfumers' descriptions of body odors\nlive as odor-neutrally as possible for two consecutive days, i.e. to use only perfume-free\nsoap that we had provided, to use only clothes and bedclothes that had been washed with\nperfume-free detergent, to avoid a list of odor-producing food, to refrain from drinking\nalcohol or smoking tobacco, and to avoid any activities that could potentially produce\ndisturbing smells (e.g., staying in smelly rooms, sexual activity, etc.). During the two\nnights, they were asked to wear a T-shirt (100% untreated cotton) and to keep it in an open\nplastic bag in between (we provided the bags). On the third day, these T-shirts were\nwrapped one by one in a new plastic bag (first layer) and aluminum foil (second layer) and\nstored at -78\u00b0C for later use.\nBefore the tests, the 45 T-shirts were thawed in 1.5 liter glass containers equipped\nwith a lid. Five evaluators (A, B, C, D and E), two of them professional perfumers\n(evaluators A and B), then described the odors of the 45 T-shirts by opening these\ncontainers and sniffing the content. The evaluators had no information about the MHC-\ntypes of the odor donor, and they described the odors independently of each other using\ntheir own personal vocabulary. Their evaluations were classified into groups of similar\ndescriptors by a person who was unaware of the MHC-types, with the help of the respective\nevaluator (the descriptors are listed in Table 1; inconsistencies between the different lists of\nodor descriptors reveal different kind of odor perception and/or subjective differences in\nverbalizing odor components). The T-shirts were stored at -30\u00b0C in between the days of\nevaluation.\nIn order to test whether the odor descriptions of a given evaluator correlated with\nthe MHC of the T-shirt wearers, we used the following statistical procedure: We recorded\nfor every possible pairwise comparison of two T-shirt wearers each (= 990 pairs) whether\ntheir odors shared at least one descriptor (i.e. odor similarity for each pair was recorded as\n0 or 1), and whether the T-shirt wearers shared more or less MHC antigens than expected\nfrom the overall average (i.e. MHC similarity for each pair was also recorded as 0 or 1, the\naverage antigen sharing among all possible pairs was 1.3). To test whether the resulting 2\nis significantly different from random, we compared it to a distribution of 2 that was\nderived from randomly reassigned data (randomization test with 5000 permutations). The\ntest was done for each evaluator separately. Odor descriptions that were used only once by\nan evaluator were excluded from this analysis. We calculated directed p-values because if\nthere is a significant link between odor descriptors and MHC-antigens, the 2 is expected to\nbe positive (see also Rice and Gaines, 1994, for a discussion of directed p-values). We\nreduced the critical -value to 0.01 according to the number of tests we did to account for\nmultiple testing (Bonferroni correction).\nResults\nThe evaluators differed in their average number of odor descriptors per T-shirt (Fig.\n1a). Evaluator A (a professional perfumer) provided the most detailed and therefore the\nmost useful description of odors for the further analyses (Fig. 1a). Similarities in odor\ndescriptions given by this evaluator correlated with similarities in the MHC of the T-shirt\nwearer (Fig. 1b) even after correcting for the fact that we had looked for such a correlation\nin all five evaluators (Bonferroni correction). No significant overall connection between\nodor description and MHC could be found in the other four evaluators. We therefore\nMHC and perfumers' descriptions of body odors\nFigure 1. a) The number of odor descriptors per T-shirt of evaluator A to E (mean\u00b1SE; ANOVA: F4\nP << 0.001). b) In order to test for a link between odor descriptors and MHC-antigens, we recorded for every\npossible pair of two T-shirt wearer (990 pairs) both the similarity in odor description as sharing at least one\ndescriptor or none, and the MHC similarity as sharing more or less antigens than the overall average of 1.3.\nThe correlation between these two binary variables is described in a 2 for each evaluator.

It appears that the\ndescriptors \"spicy\" and \"mud, wet\" correlated best to the MHC of the T-shirt wearers, and\nthe category \"other\" (that summarizes all descriptions that were used only once and could\nnot be attributed to one of the chosen descriptors) appeared to correlate worst to the MHC\nFigure 2: Odor descriptors of perfumer A relative to the average number of MHC-antigens shared by the T-\nshirt wearers whose odors were described with one of these descriptors.

The table reveals that\nthese descriptors assemble quite a heterogeneous group of odors, although the global\nanalysis in Figure 1 detected a general association between these descriptors and the MHC.\nNone of the 13 men whose odor was described as \"spicy\" possessed the antigen HLA-A1, a\ncommon antigen in the study population. However, these men carried the antigen HLA-A2\n(another very common antigen) more often than expected by chance (Fig. 3). It further\nappears that men with HLA-B14, a relatively rare antigen, smelled like \"mud, wet\" to the\nevaluator.

This more detailed\nantigen-specific analysis also indicates how much of the variance in the MHC is not, or\nonly weakly, connected to the odor descriptors: most Z-values are small and <2.\nFigure 3.

This may explain why the three laymen and even one of two professional perfumers\nwho are used to evaluate and describe fragrances could not find enough odor descriptors\nthat would enable us to do a sensitive statistical analysis. Nevertheless, one evaluator found\non average more than three different descriptors per T-shirt. It turned out that these\ndescriptors provided enough information about the odors to link them significantly to the\nMHC type of the T-shirt wearers (after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing).\nAlthough the link between MHC and odor description was only significant in one of five\nevaluators, our findings show that the association is possible, i.e. odors can, in principle, be\ndescribed in a way that the description is statistically linked to the MHC. Our more detailed\nanalysis suggests that some descriptors may be more closely linked to certain MHC\nantigens than others. Such first observations offer testable predictions. However, most of\nthe variation in odor description remains still unexplained.\nIt seems obvious that the MHC cannot be the only correlate to human body odors\nSommerville, et al., 1994). Even an experimental procedure that controls for disturbing\nodors of garlic, tobacco, etc. cannot get rid of, for example, potential age effects, of\ncomponents that reveal developmental stability (Gangestad and Thornhill, 1998; Rikowski\nand Grammer, 1999; Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999), or of volatile steroid components\nthat may not be linked to the MHC (Singer, Beauchamp, and Yamazaki, 1997). When the\ninfluence of many potentially confounding variables is experimentally reduced, up to 23 %\nof the variance in pleasantness can be explained by the degree of similarity at the loci of the\nMHC between T-shirt wearer and smeller (Wedekind and F\u00fcri 1997). In mice, the\nestimates are even higher and reach up to 50% (Ziegler, Kentenich, and Uchanska-Ziegler,\n2005). However, the pleasantness of one and the same body odor can be perceived very\ndifferently by different individuals. In Wedekind and F\u00fcri (1997), when 121 students rated\nthe same six odors for intensity, pleasantness, and sexiness, all the odors received nearly all\npossible scores from very unpleasant to very pleasant and from very weak to very intense.\nThe perception of human body odors therefore seems to vary enormously, i.e. the\ndescriptors used by evaluator A in the present study may therefore not work for other\nevaluators.\nolfactory receptor genes, of which two belong to the vomeronasal family. This cluster is\nlocated at the telomeric end of the MHC complex. Thirteen of these genes were tested and\nfound to be polymorphic. Although the physiology of MHC-correlated body odors and\nodor preferences is not well understood yet (Penn and Potts, 1998b; Ziegler et al., 2005),\nthis polymorphism, and the proximity of such a cluster of olfactory receptor genes to the\nMHC, suggests that the olfactory receptor genes could somehow be involved in MHC-\nrelated odor preferences. If so, the allelic diversity on these loci could partly be responsible\nfor individual differences in odor description.\nMilinski and Wedekind (2001) tested in two experiments whether individual\npreferences for perfume ingredients correlate with a person's MHC-genotype. They found a\nMHC and perfumers' descriptions of body odors\nsignificant correlation between the MHC and the scorings of scents in both tests. Different\npeople prefer different fragrances, and a statistically significant part of this variation is\nlinked to variation on the MHC and/or MHC-linked genes like (possibly) the olfactory\nreceptor genes described by Ehlers et al. (2000) and Younger et al. (2001). It should be\nstressed, however, that the effect found in Milinski and Wedekind (2001) was a weak one,\ni.e it is probably only detectable in large sample sizes. Also, there are obvious further facets\nof the psychology of fragrance selection besides MHC-correlated odor preferences (Van\nIn conclusion, we found that MHC-linked odor components can be verbally\ndescribed, but that it appears to be very difficult to describe odors in sufficient detail to link\nthe description to the allelic specificity of the MHC. Moreover, there are good reasons to\nassume that the perception of body odors differs between different evaluators. Descriptors\nthat work for one evaluator may therefore not work for another. Our results may help to\nidentify MHC-linked odor components that may then be chemically analyzed. A better\nunderstanding of the chemistry of MHC-linked body odor components will eventually\ncontribute to an understanding of the physiology of MHC-linked odor production and odor\nperception.\n"
