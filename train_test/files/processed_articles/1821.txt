We used multivariate regres-\nsion to test whether A1C levels differed by NHANES wave after controlling for other factors.\nMultivariate dichotomous logistic regression and predictive margins were used to test whether\nthe percentages of individuals with diabetes in selected A1C intervals differed by NHANES wave.\nRESULTS -- Mean A1C levels among individuals with diagnosed diabetes declined from\n2000.

A follow-up of the Diabetes\nControl and Complications Trial (DCCT)\nreaffirmed the value of glycemic control\nbecause microvascular complications re-\nmained lower among intervention partic-\nipants 7 years after the trial concluded (3).\nThese and other studies highlighted the\ncentral role of glycemic control in the\nmanagement of diabetes. Accordingly,\nprofessional associations, including the\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocri-\nnologists (AACE), the American Diabetes\nAssociation (ADA), and the European As-\nsociation for the Study of Diabetes\n(EASD), established clinical guidelines in\nthe range of 6.5\u00ad7.0% to motivate health\nprofessionals and patients to consistently\nmanage blood glucose levels (4,5). The\nNational Diabetes Quality Improvement\nAlliance, a private-public entity, devel-\noped national performance measures to\nmonitor glycemic control and other dia-\nbetes care processes and outcomes.\nDespite the emphasis on glycemic\ncontrol, evidence of improvement in A1C\ncontrol over time remains scant. In a re-\ncent study comparing nationally repre-\nmean A1C level declined from 7.8 to\n7.7% (not significant at the 5% level)\namong adults with self-reported diabetes\n(6). The study found some evidence sug-\ngesting an improvement in poorly con-\ntrolled A1C; the percentage of patients\n20.6%, but this decline was not signifi-\ncant at the 5% level. Other studies have\nalso shown little or no time trend in A1C\nlevels (7,8); one study (8) reported that\nthe rate of glycemic control (A1C 7.0%)\nglycemic control in clinical disease man-\nagement and public health programs dur-\ning the past decade, these observations\nare both concerning and surprising. In\nthis study, we examined recent national\ntrends in glycemic control among adults\nwith diagnosed diabetes.\nMETHODS -- We examined data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES), the\nsame data source used in the previous\nstudies (6\u00ad8). NHANES is a nationally\nrepresentative, population-based survey\ndesigned to collect information on the\nhealth and nutrition of the U.S. civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population.\nNHANES is now an ongoing survey, with\nresults released in 2-year waves.

This focus allowed us to use the\nmost recent data to examine recent trends\nin glycemic control. We limited our anal-\nysis to adults (aged 18 years) who re-\nported a previous diagnosis of diabetes by\na health care professional and who re-\nceived an A1C measurement.\nBlood specimens were processed,\nstored, and shipped to the Diabetes Diag-\nnostic Laboratory at the University of Mis-\n                                                \nFrom 1RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and the 2Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Thomas J.

After publication of\nthe DCCT and UK Prospective Diabetes\nStudy (UKPDS) results, clinical guide-\nlines for diabetes care were strengthened,\nwith adoption of lower goals for A1C.\nHealth plans embraced multifaceted dis-\nease management programs to improve\ncare and reduce A1C levels. These plans\nwere targeted to health systems and pro-\nviders as well as to patients with diabetes.\nNational public health awareness pro-\ngrams, including those promoted by the\nNational Diabetes Education Program,\nthe National Diabetes Quality Improve-\nment Alliance, and several professional\norganizations (ADA, EASD, and AACE),\nemphasized improved glycemic control\nalong with cardiovascular risk factor con-\ntrol.

Medicare also increased coverage\nfor diabetes-related supplies during this\nperiod. Whether these or other factors\ncan explain the decrease in mean A1C lev-\nels is a topic for future research.\nOur findings will be strengthened if\nthey are confirmed by analyses of other\ndatasets and future NHANES waves.\nNonetheless, our analysis has certain\nstrengths. The NHANES sample is nation-\nally representative and has a sufficient\nsample size to detect differences between\ntime periods. Uniform methods were\nused for the diabetes section of NHANES,\nand A1C values were assessed by a single\nlaboratory with close attention to quality\nof control and measurement. Our results\nare significant even after we controlled for\ndemographic variables in the multivariate\nanalysis. The fact that mean A1C was\nfor the entire sample and for most demo-\ngraphic groups (Table 2), further suggests\nthat there was a real trend in A1C levels.\nOur analysis has at least two potential\nlimitations. First, diabetes status was self-\nreported and, in the absence of a clinical\npatient history, some individuals in the\nsample might not have had diabetes and\nwould thus be expected to have A1C lev-\nels near normal. However, previous stud-\nies have suggested that the self-reported\ndiabetes variable has high reproducibility\nand validity (14,15), and there is little rea-\nson to believe that errors in self-reporting\nwould increase over time. Second, al-\nthough respondents reported time since\ndiagnosis of diabetes, information on di-\nabetes onset is not available. It is possible\nthat earlier detection of diabetes in recent\nyears could bias the results toward lower\nmean A1C. On the other hand, we found\na time trend toward lower A1C levels for\nall categories of years of diagnosed dura-\ntion, and the percentage of individuals\nwith duration of diagnosed diabetes 5\nyears changed little among NHANES\nwaves. We also controlled for time since\ndiagnosis in the regression analyses.\nHowever, these results do not fully re-\nsolve the issue of whether diagnosis has\nbeen occurring closer to onset.\nOur findings are encouraging for the\nlong-term outcomes of patients with dia-\nbetes. Hazard model estimates based on\n10-year outcomes observed in UKPDS\ndata suggest that a mean 0.511 percentage\npoint decrease in glycemic level would, if\nmaintained, produce a 10.7% reduction\nin diabetes complications (16) and an im-\nportant improvement in diabetes morbid-\nity with accompanying reductions in\ncomplication costs. However, these re-\nsults should not breed complacency\nabout the need for further efforts to\nachieve glycemic control. Although aver-\nages are improving, many individuals still\nare not meeting the optimal control tar-\ngets, and A1C levels and rates of subopti-\nmal control are especially high in some\ndemographic groups. Moreover, our esti-\nmated reduction in A1C is only about half\nof the average 0.9 percentage point reduc-\ntion achieved by intensive glycemic con-\ntrol in the UKPDS relative to conventional\ncontrol (2), suggesting that more im-\nprovement is possible. Perhaps the best\nresponse to our results is a continuing ef-\nfort to make even more progress in the\nfuture both for A1C and for other risk\nfactors for diabetes complications.\n"
