Ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), together with Cyprus and\nMalta, (\"the candidate countries\") are presently negotiating their entry into the European\nUnion (EU). According to the current schedule and the main (most likely) accession\nscenario, a first wave of candidate countries can be expected to enter the EU around 2005.\nThe new entrants will, at the time of EU entry, also become members of Economic and\nMonetary Union (EMU).1 However, as they will not be able to adopt the euro at that time\n(given the two-year qualifying period for satisfying the convergence criteria implied by the\nMaastricht Treaty2), they will become EMU members ZLWK D GHURJDWLRQ. Upon fulfilment\nof the Maastricht convergence criteria (but not before the end of the two-year qualifying\nperiod), they can adopt the euro and thereby relinquish their own currencies. Consequently,\ncounting from today (December 2001), the new member states could adopt the euro in\nabout five years from now, i.e., around 2007, at the earliest3. At first sight, this seems to be\nplenty of time to make the necessary preparations in the EU and the applicant countries.\nHowever, for many of the CEE candidate countries this may be a too short period of time\nto manage the task of not only adopting and implementing the EU's DFTXLV FRPPXQDXWDLUH\nbut also of fulfilling the Maastricht convergence criteria without great sustaining costs.\nThe enlargement of the European Union is SROLWLFDOO\\ wanted and intended. Nonetheless,\none may ask whether there are HFRQRPLF pitfalls or risks, which politicians, in the\ncandidate countries as well as in the core countries, should be prepared for. It would be\n\n An earlier version of this paper was presented at the conference on How to Pave the Road to E(M)U: The\nMonetary Side of the Enlargement Process (and its Fiscal Support), in Eltville, 26/27 October 2001,\norganized by the Deutsche Bundesbank, the National Bank of Hungary, and the Center for Financial\nStudies. I thank Florian Sp\u00e4te for research assistance and Gerhard Illing and Friedrich Ki\u00dfmer for\ncomments.\n1 An opt-out clause like the one granted to the UK and Denmark will not be available to them.\n2 These criteria are contained in Article 109j of the Treaty establishing the European Community and\ndefined in Protocol 6 of that Treaty (the \"Maastricht Treaty\") and comprise an inflation criterion, a long-\nterm government bond yield criterion, a government budget deficit criterion, and participation in the\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM-II).\n3 Baldwin et al. (2000) even suggest that enlargement of Euroland might come as early as mid-2005 if the\nexchange rate criterion is interpreted loosely (as was done for Italy and Finland) and if euro-ised countries\nskip the changeover period.\nunwise (and could be regretted later) to refuse to discuss this for fear of violating alleged or\nmisunderstood political correctness. Instead, precautions (similar to those set up in and\nafter the Maastricht Treaty) have to be developed to minimise the risks and the costs of\n(likely) economic pitfalls.\nThe risks and the costs of E(M)U enlargement are dependent upon the starting position of\nthe accession countries. They are the greater the larger is the gap in development between\nthe accession countries and the core countries. How developed are the eastern European\ncandidate countries now? The 7UDQVLWLRQ ,QGLFDWRUV of the European Bank for\nReconstruction and Development (which have been published since 1994 and are listed in\nTable 1 of the appendix) give a first impression. They indicate that the Central and Eastern\nEuropean candidate countries (CEECCs) have attained substantial progress in their\ntransition process to market economies and that their economic relations to the European\nUnion are well-developed. The share of the private economy has been raised to 60 percent\nor more of GDP. Inflation has been substantially reduced, and foreign indebtedness has\ndecreased. On average, two thirds of exports are sold on EU markets, and two thirds of the\nforeign direct investment come from the EU. The prospect of EU entrance has certainly\nfostered and speeded the transition process in the CEECCs. Nevertheless, the development\ngap between some CEECCs and the average of the EU core countries is still significant in\nmany areas. This has been demonstrated in various recent studies (e.g. EBRD 2000, 2001,\nCEECCs differ sharply from the EU core countries in terms of their economic structures\nand their per capita incomes. This can be used as an argument or warning against a `hasty'\nand `broad' (almost-all of the CEECC10-encompassing) accession strategy. (The current\nassessment of the `most likely' EU-accession scenario assumes a large convoy in 2005\nincluding all CEECCs with the exception of Bulgaria and Romania, and the attempt of\nsome of these countries to adopt the euro as soon as possible after accession; see Deutsche\nBank Research 2001.) Though there may be good political and administrative reasons for\narguing for such a rapid and almost-all CEECCs encompassing accession solution (cf.\nLackenbauer and Wenzel 2001)4, the economic consequences may be problematic.\n4 The main arguments are:\n- Use the opportunity (of enlargement) as long as there is one.\n- Against the background of historical experiences, it may be appropriate to admit certain countries together\nas a group (for example the Czech Republic and Slovakia).\n- If the CEECCs are admitted gradually, substantial frictions in the workflow of the EU-institutions and of\nthe EU as a whole have to be taken into account.\n- If enlargement comes gradually, political discrepancies may arise when countries which just have entered\nthe E(M)U participate in deciding about the accession of succeeding accession countries.\nThis paper points to various pitfalls of such a hasty and/or broad (almost-all-encompassing)\naccession strategy. It argues that the structural requirements and challenges associated with\nE(M)U enlargement, which include (I) liberalisation of capital flows (for EU-enlargement),\n(II) fulfilment of the convergence criteria (for EMU-enlargement), and (III) compliance\nwith the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (after accession to EMU), lead to pitfalls\nand dangers for the candidate countries as well as for the core countries of E(M)U and are a\ngreat challenge for monetary policy (in the candidate countries and for the European\nCentral Bank (ECB)).\nIn chapter II, two alternative problems are analysed against the background of the required\nrapid liberalisation of capital flows. First, as long as candidate countries (softly) peg their\nexchange rates5, the danger of financial instability arises. This will be briefly examined in\nthe next section. Second, to prevent this pitfall (and prepare for ERM-II), candidate\ncountries may switch (and have switched) to a flexible exchange rate arrangement. Then,\nhowever, they need an appropriate nominal anchor to stabilise inflation expectations.\nFrequently, inflation targeting is suggested. The paper illustrates that transitional countries\nare likely to have problems in practising inflation targeting successfully, thus creating\ncredibility problems for monetary policy.\nChapter III analyses pitfalls that could arise if candidate countries try to fulfil the\nMaastricht convergence criteria within a very short period of time in order to adopt the\neuro as quickly as possible and then have to comply with the rules of the Stability and\nGrowth Pact. This may overstrain the candidate countries as well as the core countries and\neventually endanger the whole enlargement process as it leads to (1) structural problems,\nand to (2) cyclical problems. First, if EMU enlargement comes over-hastily, the objective\nof real convergence may be hurt; i.e., the danger of real divergence then may arise. This is\nbased on the effects of restrictive fiscal policy (which is necessary to meet the Maastricht\nconvergence criteria and to comply with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact) on\ninfrastructure in the candidate countries. The question arises of how this can be avoided\nand what monetary policy can contribute. If the danger of divergence can be avoided,\nanother problem may still arise: against the background of the Balassa-Samuelson-effect,\nsuccessful catching-up to EU per capita GDP levels adds to upward pressure on the real\nexchange rate and hence produces inflation pressure. After EMU enlargement, this may\neven trigger (at a given money supply associated with a common inflation target) a\nrecessionary effect in the core countries. Should the ECB react to this? Second, when\nfinancial markets assess the scenario of the occurrence of real divergence (in the case of a\n5 Hard pegs, however, are not likely to be implementable in most of the CEECCs in the run-up to accession\nto E(M)U because of formal and institutional reasons, as will be discussed in the text.\n`too broad' and/or `over-hasty' enlargement) as sufficiently likely, an anticipatory recession\nmay arise in the EU. Real divergence may happen after an early adoption of the euro and\nthen induce the EU to counteract and bail out the problem countries. The expectation on\nthe financial markets of such bail-out-actions of the core countries would immediately lead\nto an increase in interest rate that would put the ECB under pressure.\nChapter IV concludes.\nIn the 10 CEECCs (or CEECC-10), a wide range of exchange rate regimes has been used\nduring the past 10 years. Not only have different arrangements been implemented, but they\nhave also been changed, in some cases several times, in all countries except Estonia (which\nhas kept its currency board regime since 1992) and Slovenia (which has used managed\nfloating, also since 1992).6 However, there has been a clear trend towards corner solutions\nof fixed and flexible exchange rate arrangements. In particular, there was a trend towards\nmore flexible arrangements which resembles the same evolution pattern as in the emerging\nmarket economies as a whole (Fischer 2001; or Buiter and Grafe 2001). The interpretation\nof this trend towards a corner solution may, however, be a fallacy as emerging market and\ntransition economies alike, especially the smaller ones, typically show \"fear of floating\"\n(Calvo and Reinhart 2000). That is, the majority of these types of countries manage the\nexchange rate quite heavily.\nThe range of exchange rate regimes currently (officially) followed still covers the whole\nrange of options from free floating to currency board hard pegs (see Table 4 in the\nappendix). Against the diversity of the exchange rate arrangements chosen, and contrary to\nthe policies of relatively slow, gradual liberalisation of capital flows followed in western\nEuropean countries after the second World War, the CEECC-10 have moved rapidly and\nquite uniformly to liberalise capital account transactions. This, however, may prove to be a\nproblem, as argued below.\n6 For a more detailed description of the evolution of exchange rate regimes in the CEECCs see Tullio\nIn principle, the CEECCs have three options when they decide how to arrange their\nexchange rate systems in the run-up to EU. Besides polar regimes - hard pegs and pure\nfloats - intermediate regimes (soft pegs, managed floating, crawling bands etc.) may be a\nfeasible option under specific circumstances. The main conclusion of most recent\ndiscussions on exchange rate regimes is that optimal regimes vary across countries and\nthrough time as country circumstances change, whereas some years ago, following the\nAsian crisis, the dominant opinion was that only corner solutions are appropriate regimes\nfor emerging market economies.\nAlthough the CEECCs can choose among a variety of alternative regimes, they are not\ntotally free in choosing their exchange rate systems in the period leading up to adoption of\nthe euro. Formally, there are three stops which the CEECCs have to consider on their way\nto Euroland:7\n1. Until entry into the EU, the exchange rate policies of the candidate countries remain\ntheir concern, implying freedom of choice of the monetary framework and exchange\nrate regime.\n2. Upon accession, the exchange rate policies of the candidate countries become a\ncommon concern of the EU. The new Member States will participate in EMU with the\nstatus of Member States with a derogation of adoption of the euro. Nevertheless, they\nwill have to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common concern and are\nexpected to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM-II) at some point after accession,\nfor at least two years.8\n8 The ECOFIN Council (the European Council of the Ministers of Economics and Finance of the fifteen\nMember States) already voiced its opinion that all exchange rate regimes, except a free float, a crawling\npeg and a peg to a currency other than the euro, are, in principle, compatible with the ERM-II. See\n3. Finally, after fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria (as a symbol of a high degree of\nsustainable nominal convergence), these countries will have to adopt the euro. This\nrequires an unanimous decision by the European Council at the level of heads of states\nor government. Recall that the fulfilment of the Maastricht convergence criteria is not\nrequired for EU-entry but only for adoption of the euro.\nArticle 56.1 of the EU Treaty stipulates that capital movements be already liberalised\nEHIRUH EU accession9. At the same time, the adaptation of institutions - intended by the\nacceptance of the DFTXLV FRPPXQDXWDLUH 10 - remains imperfect as institutions such as the\nbanking system and the financial system in general, as well as corporate governance and\nthe legal system cannot be completely reformed and adjusted to the level of the EU core\ncountries within a time period of 5 or 10 years (see Tables 1-3 in the appendix). Therefore,\nthere will be a mixture of liberalised capital markets and imperfect institutional adjustment\nin the CEECCs,11 which involves a problem for these countries, particularly if they choose\nsoft pegging (in the context of ERM-II) as their exchange rate system. This can be derived\nas a main lesson from the Asian crisis (Baig and Goldfajn 1999; Levy-Yeyati and Ubide\n2000). A softly pegged exchange rate regime, although it may be a successful strategy for\ncontrolling inflation, may increase financial instability.12 This danger arises in particular in\nemerging markets with a weak banking and financial system.13 An exchange rate peg that\nhas been stable for a rather long period of time might lead market participants to\n9 Article 56.1 says: \"Within the framework of the provisions set out in this Chapter, all restrictions on the\nmovement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be\nprohibited.\"\n10 This includes the creation of conditions for sound banking systems and financial stability, which means\nthat the accession countries will need to implement the EU Directives in the banking and financial area\nbefore EU accession. These involve, in particular, the need for appropriate legislation on capital\nadequacy, insolvency, the adoption of accounting standards, effective prudential supervision, settlement\nfinality and the avoidance of moral hazard problems (cf. Bundesbank 2001).\n11 See Table 3 in the Appendix. For example, financial intermediation is still very shallow in the CEECC-10,\ni.e., the ability of the banking sector to channel the financial savings of households and enterprises into\nprivate investment is still limited and lags far behind the EU-average; however there are striking\ndifferences between individual countries. Moreover, there is a lack of experience in credit risk assessment\nand in building the appropriate regulatory framework. This carries the risk of over-lending cycles. These\ninstitutional imperfections will not be overcome within the next 3 years.\n13 In particular, there are two groups of factors that make CEECCs vulnerable to a financial crisis. First,\nstructural deficiencies, i.e., low accounting standards or the lack of deep derivative markets, still hinder\nthe proper functioning of the banking sector. Second, and even more importantly, new risks linked to the\ncatching-up process have arisen, e.g., lending booms to SMEs and households under conditions of weak\naccounting and risk assessment.\nunderestimate, or even totally neglect, the exchange rate risk. Excessive capital inflows are\nthe consequence.14 This process is spurred on if the countries sterilise the massive capital\ninflows15 thereby raising domestic interest rates far above the international rates. Thus, a\nlarge amount of foreign-denominated debt is accumulated, which makes a country\nvulnerable to sudden shifts in market sentiment.16\nFurthermore, if bank supervision does not meet international standards, as is often the case\nin emerging markets, the likelihood of a financial crisis rises significantly17. The capital\ninflows typically lead to a lending boom and a financial or real estate bubble. If these\nbubbles burst, banks are left with a huge number of bad loans and exploding foreign debt if\nthe financial crisis is accompanied by a successful speculative attack. The severe\ndeterioration of banks' and domestic firms' balance sheets not only jeopardises the\nfinancial stability but also hampers economic growth.18\nThis recurrent pattern of emerging market crises led the IMF and most observers to advise\ncountries to take care of a sound and stable financial system before fully opening the\ncapital account. The tasks of greatest importance are considered to be: strengthening\ndomestic banking and financial systems; providing better information and policy\ntransparency; strengthening corporate finance, including bankruptcy laws and their\nimplementation; taking precautions against potential capital flow reversals; and last but not\nleast, building packages of sound macroeconomic and exchange rate policies.19 Against\nthis background, the adoption and implementation of the DFTXLV FRPPXQDXWDLUH is very\nimportant for a successful transition to Euroland for the candidate countries.\nOn the other hand, the experiences of the recent financial crises led many observers to ban\nintermediate regimes and advocate corner solutions as the appropriate menu of choice. This\nis also reflected in the practice of the last years which has shown a trend away from softly\npegged exchanged rate regimes toward floating rates or hard pegs.20 Since the institutional\n14 The CEECCs are likely to attract capital inflows as investors anticipate the convergence of interest rates\nand the appreciation of their exchange rates. Furthermore, investment opportunities are large in the\nCEECCs. This attracts large capital inflows.\n15 If they do not sterilise the capital inflows, there will be downward pressure on interest rates and upward\npressure on the money supply, thereby potentially conflicting with the inflation goals.\n16 A common feature of the recent emerging market crises was that the stock of foreign exchange reserves\navailable in the short run was typically far lower than foreign debt.\n19 For more on these requirements see, e.g., Fischer (1999).\n20 Cf. Fischer (2001) who notes that this trend seems to be well established, both for countries that are\nintegrated into international capital markets and those that are not.\nframework (including the financial system) cannot be overhauled and completely reformed\nwithin a short period of time, the choice of exchange rate regimes gains a special\nsignificance for avoiding financial instability in emerging and transition economies.\nThere are two polar regimes or corner solutions that help to avoid some of the severe\nconsequences of financial instability associated with the intermediate regime, namely hard\npegging and free floating.\nThe term \"hard peg\" refers to exchange rate systems, such as currency boards or\ndollarisation (euroisation), where monetary policy autonomy is completely given up. Hard\npegs have gained prominence in the debate about the right exchange rate system for\nemerging markets because severe currency crises, which often have devastating\nconsequences for the economy as a whole, are not possible under hard peg regimes. Thus,\nit can be excluded that a financial crisis, because of an underdeveloped institutional\nframework, results in a currency crisis.21\nBut before a hard peg can be established, certain institutional preconditions must be\n- a developed, well-supervised, and regulated financial system;24\n- access to a sufficient level of reserves;\n- the rule of law;\n- fiscal discipline\n- wage and price flexibility.\n21 Crises are then confined to the financial and banking sector of an economy. Cf. Chang and Velasco\n(2000a) who analyze financial instability under alternative exchange rate systems.\n22 In considering the desirability of establishing a hard peg (euroisation or currency board), the crucial\nfactors are, on the one hand, the gains to credibility of tying the hands of monetary authorities and of\nabolition of the exchange rate risk against the currency (area) to which it is linked, versus, on the other\nhand, the possible costs of inflexibility. Possible costs that have to be contrasted with the gains arise if the\ncountry concerned is likely to face different shocks from those hitting the currency area to which it is\nlinked.\n24 This includes not only well-supervised and regulated banks but also equity and bond markets in order to\ngather enough venture capital and to reduce the problem of interdependencies between banks and firms.\nOne can supplement this list by some factors which may not be necessary but helpful for\nthe success of a currency board, for example:\n- a foregoing wide use of the foreign currency in the economy;25\n- a desire for further close integration with the currency partner(s).26\nAnother polar regime or corner solution (besides hard pegging), that could avoid the pitfall\nof financial instability associated with the intermediate regime, would be free floating.\nAgain, currency crises as a result of financial instability, which is a key problem in\nintermediate regimes, cannot occur. However, we know that free floating includes a\ntendency toward volatility. This exchange rate volatility is not always based on\nmacroeconomic fundamentals and includes occasional speculative bubbles and crashes.\nHence, exchange rate flexibility tends to raise the exchange rate risk premium. There are\nother caveats, too. One caveat is that flexible exchange rates cannot protect banks against\npanic by external creditors who hold short-term claims denominated in foreign currency.27\nThis was the case in Asia to a significant extent. Therefore, a flexible exchange rate system\nwould have provided only limited protection.28 Furthermore, emerging economies set\npolicy in a world in which their own financial markets are underdeveloped, many structural\nrigidities exist, and corporate sectors have very limited opportunities to hedge. In these\nemerging market economies, stock markets are a relatively recent phenomenon and bank\nlending is the dominant form of financing. Exchange rate movements are costly in this\nenvironment, and hence, the fixed option may look very attractive29.\nThis may be a main economic reason why the CEECCs aspire to enter the European\nmonetary union quickly. Before entering the EMU, however, the choice of a flexible\nexchange rate system may be useful for the CEECCs. This could make it easier to find the\nright real exchange rate before adopting the euro or entering ERM-II. Hence CEECCs\nshould have an interest in allowing market forces to find the right exchange rate. The\nNational Bank of Poland (NBP), for example, has substantiated its plan or proposal for\nchanging to a flexible exchange rate regime with this argument: \"The entry to the ERM-II\n25 The reason is that in a country that is already partly euroised, devaluation is of little use.\n26 This has the advantage of increasing the political credibility of the commitment.\n27 They can only protect banks against the self-fulfilling pessimism of GRPHVWLF depositors, i.e., of depositors\nwhose claims are in local currency.\n28 Floating rates, however, would have altered behaviour on the part of private lenders and borrowers but\npresumably without being able to prevent the crises.\nshould take place at the equilibrium rate, difficult to determine without resorting to market\nforces. A fixed rate would offer little guarantee of attaining this goal.\" (National Bank of\nPoland 1998, p. 9) The NBP's position, however, testifies to great faith (perhaps too great)\nin the ability of market forces to produce the equilibrium exchange rate at the right\nmoment. Experience with floating exchange rates up to now does point to long lasting\nmisalignments and inherent high short-term volatility30. Therefore, it would be a stroke of\nluck if the market rate, say on January 1, 2005, coincides with the equilibrium rate. In any\nevent, the NBP argument is an argument against a too-early fixing of the exchange rates of\ncandidate countries.31\nOn the other hand, one has to consider that recent studies (e.g., Calvo and Reinhart 2000 or\nBailliu et al. 2000) have emphasised that many countries that claim to have floating\nexchange rates do not, in practice, allow the exchange rate to float freely, but use interest\nrate and intervention policies to affect its behaviour (\"fear of floating\").32 That is, even\nthose countries which claim to fully float, de facto practise managed (\"dirty\") floating. This\ncan be turned into an argument in favour of hard pegging (e.g., Reinhart 2000): The low\nrelative exchange-rate variability in countries that claim to have floating exchange rates is\nseen as the deliberate result of policy actions to stabilise the exchange rate. Since countries\nthat are classified as having a managed float mostly resemble non-credible pegs, the only\nway to avoid the \"floating and credibility problems\" simultaneously may be a very hard\npeg, namely euroisation /dollarisation (ibid).\nAnother alternative may be to supplement managed floating with a \"credible\" nominal\nanchor. When exchange rate flexibility increases, it is important for a country to determine\nthe basis for its monetary policy, i.e., to choose an appropriate nominal anchor. The record\n30 Moreover, the CEECCs are highly open economies. They are integrated into a global financial system in\nwhich the flow of capital is much less restricted than it was, for instance, when Greece, Spain and\nPortugal joined the EU. Because of their status as emerging economies, the accession countries remain\nexposed to volatile capital flows and hence to large real exchange rate variability and moreover, are\nvulnerable to shifts in market sentiment triggered by financial crises elsewhere.\n31 On the other end of the spectrum are the hard peggers, such as Estonia, which want to stick to the current\nexchange rate (8 kroon for 1 DM, i.e., about 16 kroon for 1 euro) and let the price level adjust to give the\nappropriate real exchange rate at the time of ERM-II entry. In this context the statement contained in the\nletter of intent of February 2000 is relevant and should be read together with the statement of the NBP\nabove: \"Our economic objectives will be pursued in the context of our long-standing currency board\narrangement, which continues to provide a stable, transparent, and consistent policy framework. As\ndemonstrated by the sharp improvement in our current account position and solid export growth to\nwestern markets, the current exchange rate peg remains appropriate. :H LQWHQG WR PDLQWDLQ WKH FXUUHQW\n(08 DW ZKLFK SRLQW WKH HXUR ZLOO EHFRPH (VWRQLD\u00b6V FXUUHQF\\\" (Eesti Pank (2000), para 12 p. 4; emphasis\nadded).\n32 The interest-rate volatility (both real and nominal) as well as the reserve volatility have been found to be\nsignificantly higher in these countries than that of \"true(r)\" floaters (Calvo and Reinhart 2000).\nof inflation targeting is often regarded to be a good one in this regard (see e.g., Bernanke et\nal. 1998, and Fischer 2001). Hence, supplementing managed floating with inflation\ntargeting is sometimes regarded as the locally optimal solution for emerging countries\nInflation targeting here takes a significant role: it is expected to avoid the danger of\nfinancial instability associated with non-credible pegs (such as managed floating) and to\novercome or fill the lack of institutional conditions that are responsible for credibility\nproblems. However, it is difficult to see how inflation targeting can meet these\nexpectations. It is overstrained with these tasks, in particular in emerging countries such as\nthe CEECCs. In order to serve as a firm anchor for monetary policy in the context of a\ntransparent and credible operating framework, inflation targeting needs to involve more\nthan vague commitments to bring inflation down to EU levels. As argued in Masson et al.\nframework needs to satisfy certain prerequisites. They include a quantitative framework\nlinking policy instruments to inflation, and the freedom to carry out an independent\nmonetary policy. However, most developing countries and also many of the CEECCs do\nnot satisfy these prerequisites. For example, as inflation is not controllable in the short term\nby monetary policy, and hence hitting a target requires forecasting the effects of policy\ninstruments at a one- or two-year horizon, it is essential to have a reliable and generally\naccepted way of making those forecasts. It is doubtful whether (many of) the CEECCs are\ncapable of meeting this requirement. In particular, one has to consider that, in general, the\nCEECCs do not satisfy a main requirement of inflation targeting, namely the existence of a\nstable and predictable relationship linking monetary policy instruments to future inflation.\nStructural changes, which are natural in emerging and transition countries, are bound to\naffect the stability of relationships for forecasting inflation. If, however, inflation targeters\ndo not have reliable inflation forecasting tools, inflation targeting, instead of helping to\nconsolidate central bank credibility, will have the opposite effect. Furthermore, there are\ndoubts whether the CEECCs already exhibit a political consensus in favour of low inflation\nand fears that the central bank independence in some of the CEECCs is not solid (or only\n\"legal\") so that it may eventually be ineffective and perhaps even counterproductive\n(Wagner 1999b). If a central bank is not believed to have the freedom to carry out an\nindependent monetary policy, it can hardly gain enough credibility to sustain a price-\nstability oriented monetary policy. As a result, sometimes a \"hybrid\" system with some\nweight given to both inflation and the exchange rate is suggested (Masson 2000). This will\n33 Chang and Velasco (2000, p. 75) state: \"(T)he evaluation of exchange-rate policy should move away from\nthe `fix versus flex' dichotomy, and toward the characterisation of optimal monetary policy in well-\nspecified analytical frameworks.\" Inflation-targeting is regarded to be one such framework.\nlikely to be the alternative that most of the CEECCs will choose in the interim phase of\nERM-II between EU admission and the adoption of the euro. Structural differences\nbetween the CEECCs and western Europe, however, may make adjustable pegs especially\nvulnerable to speculative attacks.34\nIn the case of liberalised capital flows, the choice of the exchange-rate regime\npredetermines whether there is a degree of freedom for other policies, in particular\nmonetary policy. The choice of exchange-rate regime is primarily an issue for the candidate\ncountries themselves, at least before EU-admission. Upon EU-entry, the exchange rate\npolicy of the candidate countries becomes a common concern of the EU. At some stage\nafter accession, the candidate countries are expected to formally participate in ERM-II for\nat least two years. Because of the danger of speculative attacks mentioned above, the\ncandidate countries might be considering the need for an exit strategy from administered\nexchange rates. Sticking to the ERM-II may prove to be too costly for countries that are\ndirectly hit by a speculative attack as well as for neighbour countries hit by negative\nspillovers.35 Adhering to capital controls, however, is not a real option for CEECCs. On\nthe one hand, it would probably postpone the catching-up process as capital shortages\nwould emerge. On the other hand, and more fundamentally, liberalised capital markets are\na VLQH TXD QRQ of full participation in the single market and are part of the \u00b3DFTXLV\nTherefore, one may think that immediate adoption of euroisation by accession countries is\nan adequate solution to the financial instability problem (Dornbusch and Giavazzi 1999).\n34 Experiences with \"hybrid\" regimes seem to confirm this fear. For example, Chile and Poland recognised\nthat a dual nominal system (to target both the real exchange rate and inflation; in order to both maintain a\ncompetitive edge in the markets and to reduce inflationary pressures) is unsustainable in the medium-term.\nAfter Chile had operated a crawling band that targeted the real exchange rate, it introduced inflation\ntargeting in 1997, but the increased financial integration and large capital inflows of the 1990s made it\ndifficult to target both the real exchange rate and inflation. Consequently, the authorities adopted a free\nPoland managed the nominal exchange rate in the early 1990s, to both maintain a competitive edge in the\nmarkets and to reduce inflationary pressures. After the conflict between these two objectives became\nevident, the authorities decided in favour of the first objective. This led to large capital inflows, a strong\ncurrent account, and accumulation of reserves, and thus made the need to maintain a competitive real\nexchange rate less urgent. This allowed the authorities to adopt price stability as the primary objective.\nThis was supported by the adoption of a crawling, but widening, exchange rate band in 1995. In 1998\ninflation targeting was introduced, and in early 2000 a full float was adopted since it was recognised that a\ndual nominal system is unsustainable in the medium term.\n35 Berger and Wagner (2001b) show how the interdependencies of the private sector expectations in\ndifferent countries may contribute to the spreading of foreign exchange market turmoil.\nHowever, a unilateral introduction of the euro by individual accession countries or new\nmembers is not desirable from the Community's point of view, as was expressed by the\nECOFIN council in November 2000 in a report it submitted to the European Council on the\nexchange-rate aspects of enlargement. The ECOFIN held that the euro should be\nintroduced only by way of accession to monetary union and the convergence process,\nwhich is to be demonstrated in the course of the accession process. The exchange rate of\nthe national currency plays an important role as an adjustment instrument during the\nconvergence process, yet it may also serve as a yardstick of success in adjustment.\n(Bundesbank 2001) Moreover, euroisation without solid institutional fundaments may\nIf, however, ERM-II is regarded as an indispensable precondition for introducing the euro\n(entering EMU), the question arises of whether it is rational for all of the candidate\ncountries to join ERM-II immediately after EU-accession and to try to keep the period\nbetween joining ERM-II and introducing the euro as short as possible. By doing this, some\nmay run into the danger not only of speculative attacks but also of real divergence as will\nbe argued in the next chapter. It may be better for some candidate countries to maintain\nflexible exchange rates after EU-accession for a while and use the time to improve\ninstitutional fundamentals.\nA main (economic) motive for the accession countries to join the E(M)U is the hope that\njoining the E(M)U will foster their economic development and lead to a (quicker)\nconvergence of their standards of living to that of the EMU core countries (Wagner 2001a).\nThis is in line with the spirit of the European Treaties. These show that an alignment of\nstandards of living at a high level in the participating states was a target of the process of\nintegration from the beginning. For example, the preamble of the European Community\nTreaty talks of the aim of the contracting states \"...to strengthen the unity of their\neconomies and to ensure their harmonious developments by reducing the differences\nexisting between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions\".\nThis idea can also be found in Article 2 of the European Community Treaty, which also\n36 See the discussion on hard pegs in II.2.2.2(2) for the necessary institutional preconditions.\nexpresses the view that monetary union is seen as an instrument for achieving real\nconvergence.\nThe E(M)U enlargement has to be compared with this objective. I shall argue in this\nchapter that there is a danger or pitfall for some accession countries that the enlargement\nprocess may result in real divergence, i.e. an increase in the backwardness of their\nstandards of living compared to that of the EU core countries, instead of a quicker\nconvergence process.\nThe basic idea is: premature E(M)U-enlargement/accession could delay real convergence\nand, at least for a while, lead to real divergence. (Such J-curve costs may not only have\ntransitory effects but can also have long-term effects, if, for example, public opinion about\nthe desirability of E(M)U-enlargement in various countries changes and, therefore, the\nenlargement process is stopped politically.) This is based on the effects of restrictive fiscal\npolicy (that is necessary to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria and to comply with the\nrules of the Stability and Growth Pact) on infrastructure in the accession countries.\nThe envisaged enlargement will bring small open economies into the EU that are in a\nprocess of catching-up with the EU (see Tables 1 \u00ad 3 in the appendix). However, a trade-\noff may exist between successful catching-up (real convergence) and achieving the\nbudgetary discipline implied by the Maastricht convergence criteria and the rules of the\nStability and Growth Pact. Therefore, CEECCs may run into a problem when they try to\nreach real and nominal convergence at the same time.37 The main reason for a trade-off\nbetween real and nominal convergence lies in the following: catching-up can be sustained\nonly if there is an adequate public infrastructure. Provision of this infrastructure may\nrequire high rates of public investment. As the rate of return on this public investment\nwould be high, deficit financing may be justified in the CEECCs. In these circumstances, a\nbudget deficit above 3% and certainly above the \"close to balance\" rule of the Stability and\nGrowth Pact may be optimal for these countries. Even a rate of inflation above the required\nconvergence level may seem desirable to these countries as they can profit from\nseigniorage revenues (as long as they keep their own currency).38 It has to be realised that\n37 This means that ERM-II participation and the adoption of the euro may need to be postponed for some\ntime after EU accession. This is the case if it is believed that even in the countries most advanced in\ntransition, the reform agenda relating to accession and real convergence must have priority over policy\nmoves inspired by full EMU participation (Stage III).\n38 However, it may be feared that accession countries will respond with what is sometimes called the\n\"weighing-in\" syndrome: they may maintain very tight macroeconomic policies and resort to various\ntechniques to squeeze down inflation prior to accession, only to revise the course and ignore the criteria\nafter they enter EMU. This would, however, result in economic and political problems and quarrels within\nthe enlarged EMU. Moreover, the looser the commitment to pursue macroeconomic polices that will\nensure internal and external stability, the less likely it is that a rigidly fixed system can survive the\npressures of the market.\nthe CEECCs have to satisfy these convergence criteria and comply with the rules of the\nStability and Growth Pact DIWHU admission to EMU DV ZHOO. Insofar, they will permanently\nbe restrained with respect to fiscal financing of budget deficits. Moreover, by acceding to\nEMU, they lose their control over monetary policy so that they cannot monetarily finance\ntheir budget deficits autonomously any more. This means, to finance a given amount of\ngovernment expenditures, the accession countries would have to raise their tax rates. As\nempirical evidence shows, often this is not politically feasible. Hence, there may be no\nother choice but to reduce government expenditure to satisfy the Maastricht convergence\ncriteria and to comply with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. Reducing only the\nconsumption or welfare state parts of government expenditure will be politically difficult\n(in particular, accession countries where the welfare state is much less developed than in\nthe rest of the E(M)U may feel they have the \"right\" to catch up with the rest of the\ncommunity). Therefore, the public investment in infrastructure will have to be decreased,\ntoo. This will decrease the real growth rate in the accession countries.\nMoreover, quick disinflation (within the one-digit-area) in the CEECCs is (because of\nnominal rigidities) hardly possible without restrictive fiscal policy, i.e. lower rates of public\ninvestment. Furthermore, even successful real catching-up involves problems in that it adds\nto upward pressure on the real exchange rate and hence produces inflationary pressure and\nthus aggravates nominal convergence (Balassa-Samuelson-effect)39. The Maastricht\ninflation criterion can then only be achieved either through an appreciation of the nominal\nexchange rate, or (if this is not desired or possible because of the limited range of permitted\nfluctuations within the EMR-II system which the CEECCs have to enter before adoption of\nthe euro),40 through more restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, which would jeopardise\npublic investment, growth and employment. Moreover, if this productivity gap continues to\nexist after EMU-enlargement, not only the CEECCs but also the EU core countries may be\nhurt. As the average inflation rate in the core countries then has to decline (to compensate\nfor the higher inflation rates in the new member countries in order to meet the common\ninflation target), they may be forced to run a more restrictive fiscal policy than otherwise.\n39 The Balassa-Samuelson model for real appreciation implies that the stability of the price level is only\npossible if the exchange rate appreciates at a rate which equals the product of the share of non-traded\ngoods in the price index and the difference in productivity growth in the two sectors of traded and non-\ntraded goods. On the contrary, exchange rate stability will produce higher inflation than in foreign (i.e.,\nEU) countries by that same amount.\n40 One solution might be to widen the range; another one would be to increase the entrance inflation\ncriterion. However, either would violate the principle of equal treatment between the initial EMU\nmembers and those that join the monetary union later. Furthermore, this watering down of the Maastricht\ncriteria could create credibility problems and therefore increase the risk premium in the interest rate (thus\nimplying negative growth effects).\nSumming up, attempts to follow a kind of \"big-bang-strategy\"41 and quickly adopt the euro\nafter EU-accession may involve real (growth) losses in the respective CEE countries. But\nnot only the candidate countries themselves may be hurt, the EU-core countries may suffer\nalso from premature adoption of the euro by the CEECCs (see section 3 below).\nThe discussion in the foregoing section refers to the loss of monetary and fiscal financing\nof budget deficits caused by accession to EMU against the background of the necessary\nfulfilment of the Maastricht convergence criteria and the compliance with the rules of the\nStability and Growth Pact. Existing levels of government expenditures would therefore\ninstead have to be financed by an increase in the tax rate. This, however, may be not\nfeasible because of national-political opposition. Therefore, government expenditures have\nto decrease and the real growth rate may decline.\nNow suppose that there is no national-political opposition to a rise in tax rates. Even then,\nthere may be other, mainly international obstacles (related to globalization, policy\ncoordination agreements or other endogenous integration aspects)42 against a rise in tax\nrates which is necessary for financing a maximum growth rate and a real convergence\nprocess. The need for such a rise in tax rates need not be substantiated by the necessary\nfulfilment of the nominal convergence criteria and the rules of the Stability and Growth\nPact, but can also be explained by a technology gap between accession countries and the\nincumbents of EMU. This will be shown in the following model.\nWe start with the assumption that a small country with a lower technological level enters\nE(M)U. The lower technological level forces it to use more public infrastructure\n(expenditures) to attain its maximal real growth rate. This requires a higher tax rate in this\naccession country compared to that in the incumbent countries which have a higher\ntechnology level. Now, when this (technologically) less developed country enters E(M)U\nand thus intensifies trade with the incumbents,43 it, being an economically small country,\n41 A \"big bang\" strategy tries to implement reforms as quickly as possible no matter how costly they are in\nthe short run. See section IV below for a comparison with the discussion about big-bang- versus\ngradualistic strategies of transformation ten years ago.\n42 See, for example, Wagner (2001c). A major international obstacle is the increased tax competition. Other\nobstacles, in particular within an Economic and Monetary Union, are the requirement to coordinate\neconomic policy, and political pressure or agreement to harmonize taxes.\n43 Cf. Rose (2000, 2001). In the model, we use the simplifying assumption that entering a currency union\nimplies starting trade with the incumbents.\nhas to adjust its tax rate (at least partially) to that of the (average of the) incumbents.44\nTherefore, the fiscal autonomy of the accession country is reduced through accession to\nEMU. This will force it to reduce government expenditure, and hence its real growth rate\nwill decline below its maximum level. This has to (and will) be contrasted with positive\ntrade and technological spillovers from E(M)U accession. The main conclusion of this\nsection is that the larger is the development (real convergence) gap between an accession\ncountry and the incumbents, the greater is the danger of ending up with negative net real\ngrowth effects of an accession to E(M)U, for at least some period of time.\nThe basic idea of this danger of ending up in real divergence instead of convergence for a\nsmall accession country can be sketched using a simple model.\nWe use a 2-country growth model with public goods and assume that a small country\n(country B) intends to accede to an existing (big) currency union (country A). Initially, both\ncountries are assumed to be totally autarkic, i.e., there are no economic links. Countries A\nand B are assumed to be largely identical (except for their sizes). There are only two\ndifferences (besides of size): first, country A is technically more advanced than country B;\nsecond, the output effect of public investment in country B is larger than in country A (that\nis, we assume a higher output elasticity of public investment in country B than in country\nA). In the following model, the growth rate of country B can be affected by variations in\npublic expenditure. Therefore, the accession to the currency union (country A) can lead to\nnegative growth effects for country B. The reason is that the fiscal autonomy of country B\nis reduced through the accession to the currency union. We shall assume that the accession\nto the currency union will require a decline in the public (government) sector share in the\ngross national product. This will reduce public investment and thus the growth rate of\ncountry B.\nBefore accession, the growth-maximising government sector share in the GNP in country B\nis higher than in country A because of the higher output elasticity of public investment.\nAfter accession, therefore, country B has to reduce government expenditure, that is, it has\nto adapt its government sector share to that of the currency union. Since, initially, country\nB chooses the government expenditure to maximise the growth rate, an accession to the\ncurrency union implies a change in the expenditure level and thus a lower growth rate.\n44 The reasons are the same as those indicated in footnote 42.\nAt first, we develop a model of a closed economy (country A). The model is an extension\nof the Barro (1990)-model. The model economy has two sectors: capital and consumer\ngoods, and two production factors: labour and capital. In the capital goods sector,\nproductivity can be increased by public investment (e.g., by establishing a stable legal\nframework and implementing institutional infrastructure). The firms consider the quantity\nof public services to be exogenous. To exclude scale effects, we assume that the state\nprovides public services with congestion.46 Public expenditure is financed by tax incomes.\nThe production function of a producer, j, in the capital goods sector of country A is:\n.\nK\n*\n.\n%\n< M\n$\nM\n\n-\n-\n]\n)\n/(\n[ ,\nwhere < is output, % is a productivity parameter which reflects the technological level, .\nM\nis\nprivate capital input by producer M, * is government expenditure, (1-K) is that part of the\ncurrent capital stock (K) which is used in the capital goods sector, and 1\n-\n< \ndenotes the output elasticity of the public goods with congestion. The superscript $ is\ninserted only when there is a deviation from the values of country B (see below). For given\n* and ., the firm's production exhibits constant returns with respect to the private input\n.\nM\n. The production process equals the AK model modified by the term that involves public\nservices. An increase in G relative to (1-K). expands <\nM\nfor given .\nM\n. Because of\ncongestion, only an increase in *, relative to the capital input in the capital goods sector,\n(1-K)., increases the marginal productivity of the private capital. An increase of (1-K). for\ngiven * lowers the public services available to each producer and therefore reduces <\nM\n. As\nlong as */(1-K). is constant, the marginal productivity of\nM\n. is also constant, and steady\nendogenous growth results.\nWe suppose that the government runs a balanced budget financed by a proportional tax at\nrate  on <:\n* \n=\n45 Wagner (2001b) includes details with respect to calculations and interpretations.\n46 This means that we model a congestion effect: Many state activities such as water systems, highways,\npolice and fire services, and courts are subject to congestion. For a given quantity of aggregate state\nservices, *, the quantity available to an individual declines as other users congest the facilities.\nThe firms in the capital goods sector thus have to pay a part of their gross income to the\ngovernment.\nThe producers in the consumer goods sector use the remaining capital stock (K.) and\nlabour to produce consumer goods. We assume the following production function for\nfirm L:\n\nL\nL\nL\n.\n./\n; -\n)\n( ,\n<  . ; denotes output of consumer goods and / describes the (constant) labour\nforce. The production function implies that the stock of knowledge is linked to the stock of\ncapital. The stock of knowledge is available to all producers, i.e. knowledge is a public\ngood. The function is linearly homogenous in the private factor inputs. On the level of\nsectors, however, there are increasing returns to scale.\nBy aggregating (1) and inserting into (2), one gets:\n$\n%\n.\nK\n* \n\n)\n(\n)\n( -\n= .\nThe higher the tax rate and the higher the level of technology, the higher is the government\nexpenditure. By inserting (4) into the FOC for profit maximisation in the capital goods\nsector, one gets the equilibrium rate of interest conditional upon the tax rate:\n$\n$\n$\n%\nU \n\n\n\n\n\n)\n(\n)\n(\n-\n-\n=\n+\nwhere U denotes the rate of interest, and  describes the rate of depreciation.\nThe interest rate is positively dependent upon the level of technology. There are no\ntransitory dynamics and all variables exhibit the common growth rate  .\nNow we introduce the behaviour of households. The representative (infinite-lived)\nhousehold maximises overall utility. Assuming the common functional form for the utility\nfunction, utility is given by\nH\nF\n\n\n\n-\n -\n\n-\n-\n=\nFrom this we get, after some algebra, the equilibrium rate of growth conditional upon the\ntax rate:\n)\n(\n)\n[(\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n-\n-\n-\n=\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n% .\nThe effect of government on growth involves two channels. On the one hand, an increase\nin the tax rate lowers marginal productivity of capital after taxes and therefore reduces the\nrate of growth; on the other hand, an increase in the tax rate raises the provision of public\ngoods and hence increases the growth rate.\nNow we assume that the government selects a tax rate that maximises the growth rate. By\nsetting the derivative of (7) to zero, we get\n$ \n -\nBy inserting (8) into (7), the maximal growth rate in country A is given by\n)\n(\n)\n(\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n-\n-\n-\n=\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$ % .\nNow we come to model country B (the accession country). We assume that country A\nexhibits a higher level of technology. That is, we assume that the productivity of private\ncapital in country A is higher than in country B: $\n% %\n% < . Furthermore, we assume that\nthe output elasticity of public goods with congestion in country B is higher than in country\nA: $\n% \n < . This implies that country B profits from public investments to a greater\nextent than country A.47 Otherwise, countries A and B are symmetric (except of size).\nHence, the aggregated production function in the capital goods sector of country B is given\nby:\n.\nK\n*\n.\nK\n%\n< % \n-\n-\n-\n]\n)\n/(\n[\n)\n( .\n47 The reason is that the provision of a functioning infrastructure induces a higher growth push than an\nimprovement of an already available functioning infrastructure does.\nAlso in country B, the government runs a balanced budget financed by a proportional tax at\nrate  on <:\n* \n= .\nBy doing the same calculation steps as above, we get the growth rate of country B\nconditional upon the tax rate as\n)\n(\n)\n[(\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n-\n-\n-\n=\n-\n%\n%\n%\n%\n% .\nThe growth-rate maximising tax-rate is\n% \n -\nBy inserting (13) into (12) we get the maximal growth rate in country B as\n)\n(\n)\n(\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n-\n-\n-\n=\n-\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n% % .\nWe have supposed three differences between countries A and B: their sizes, the level of\ntechnology, and the level of output elasticity of public goods with congestion. The\ntechnological advantage of country A over country B leads to a higher growth rate in\ncountry A. However, the direction of the output elasticity effect is ambiguous. Therefore,\nwe cannot say unambiguously, whether the growth rate in autarky of country A is higher or\nlower than that of country B.\nNow we can analyse which growth effects are induced by the accession of a small country\n(country B) to the currency union (country A). The assumption of a small country implies\nthat the enlargement of the monetary union has no influence on the endogenous variables\nof country A. The growth rate of country A will not change. We assume that accession to\nthe monetary union requires that country B lowers its government expenditure (see above).\nIn the above model structure, this is synonymous with a reduction of the tax rate in country\nB. For simplicity (and without any consequences for our basic results), we assume that all\ncountries of the monetary union have to implement a common tax rate. That is, we assume\nthat country B has to implement the lower tax rate of country A ( $\n\n -\n= 1 ). The\naccession country thus cannot implement a fiscal policy according to its national\npreferences any more. It has to reduce public investments (below the level desired in\nautarky) so that it is confronted with a decrease of its growth rate.48\nSo far, we have only concentrated on potential QHJDWLYH effects of an accession to the\nmonetary union for the accession country. However, there are also potential SRVLWLYH\ngrowth effects for the accession country. We can assume that the accession country B\nprofits from the higher level of technology in the monetary union (country A) after\nadmission to the monetary union. The resulting spillovers are positively dependent upon\nthe difference in technology. That is, the higher the technology gap, the higher are the\nspillovers.49 Furthermore, the spillovers are also determined by the extent of economic\nintegration (proxied by trade flows)50 as well as by further factors of influence (in\nparticular, transfer payments and other integration programs, these factors could be\nmodelled by variations of , see below). Depending on the strength of the positive and\nnegative growth effects explained above, accession to monetary union leads to either an\nincrease or a decrease of the growth rate of the accession country.\nWe model this by supposing the following production function in the capital goods sector\nof country B:\n[ ( ,( ))](1 ) [ /(1 ) ] %\n% $ %\n< % I % % K . * K .\n<\n\n -\n= + - - - ,\n( / )\nI\n\n>\n\n( )\n$ %\nI\n% %\n\n>\n -\n.\n48 If we change the assumption that B is a small country into B being a big country (interpreted as the group\nof admitted accession countries), then it may appear useful to assume that the common tax rate in the\nmonetary union is a mean of the tax rates in autarky. In this case, it is possible (in the above model) that\ncountry A has to suffer from loss in growth as a consequence of the entrance of country B. (Because of the\ntechnology leadership, spillovers are lower for country A than for country B). Then it is possible that both\ncountries have to suffer from a decline in their growth rates. However, this does not necessarily imply a\nloss in welfare. To prove this, the solution of the model would have to be calculated, and a welfare\nanalysis would have to be carried out.\n49 This seems to be an adequate assumption as long as the technology gap is not too big. See, e.g., Xie\nIn order to exclude that the spillovers increase the level of technology in country B beyond\nthe level in country A, we moreover assume that $ %\nI % %\n  - where  denotes the\nstrength of the spillovers, and 1\n  . T denotes trade flows, and %6\u00c3  %7 delineates the\ntechnology gap between countries A and B. It is obvious that for 0\n=\n , the production\nfunction remains unchanged, and there are no spillovers.\nBy considering the reduced tax rate and the changed production function, we can derive the\ngrowth rate in the (small) accession country after admission to the monetary union:\n{ (1 ) [ ( ,( ))] }\n%\n% %\n% $ $ % $ %\n% I % %\n<\n\n \n     \n\n-\n= - + - - - .\nWe see that the growth effect of an accession to the monetary union is not unambiguous:\nWhile the exogenously given tax rate $\n\n -\n= 1 tends to lower the growth rate, the\nspillovers increase the growth rate. It depends upon the strength of the individual effects\nwhether the growth rate increases or decreases. Only for 0\n = we can unambiguously state\nthat there will be a decline in the growth rate in country B.51 However, it makes sense to\nassume that directly after enlargement of the monetary union,  tends to be low. This\nmeans that the accession to the monetary union tends to result in a decrease of the growth\nrate in country B, at least initially (see below). In order to be consistent in our argument we\nhave to interpret  as the strength of the spillovers of PRQHWDU\\ LQWHJUDWLRQ. The spillovers\nof monetary integration, however, usually become significantly effective only after\nadoption of the euro by the accession countries.52 Hence it makes sense to assume that \nwill only gradually increase so that it is very likely that the positive growth effects of an\naccession to the monetary union will be low in the beginning. Therefore, the negative\ngrowth effects worked out above will tend to outweigh the positive effects during the first\nperiod of time after monetary union accession. That is, before and after the admission to\nthe monetary union, the growth rate in country B may decline for a while.\nIn the model, we assumed that the higher the technology gap, the higher are the spillovers.\nHowever, in practice, we have to consider a factor which is usually associated with such a\ntechnology gap - that the higher the technology gap, the greater is the lack of institutions. A\n51 We cannot generally determine whether the growth rate in country B will be higher or lower than in\ncountry A. If, however, the growth rate in country B is higher, the assumption that B is a small country\nwould have to be revised in the long run. In general we can state that the higher the trade ratio and the\nhigher , the more likely it is that the growth rate in country B will lie above that in country A.\n52 Actually, there may already be positive spillovers before EMU entry because accession countries may\nattract capital inflows as investors anticipate the convergence of interest rates and the appreciation of their\nexchange rates. Nonetheless, spillovers will gradually increase after EMU entry.\nsignificant lack or low standard of institutions (schooling etc.), however, presents a\nhindrance to exploiting the technology input so that the positive growth effects in country\nB may not eventuate. If the experience of negative (or only slow positive) growth effects\nleads to political disappointment, it may result in turmoil and pressure for redistribution\nwithin the EMU that would destabilise and (at worst) eventually stop further integration\nprocesses (especially in the case when several such countries are admitted and run into\nsuch problems simultaneously). This may even occur earlier if the pitfall of an anticipatory\nrecession, which will be discussed in the next section, is realised.\nIn the foregoing sections we have described the danger that restrictive macroeconomic\npolicies, which may be necessary in CEECCs which want to enter not only EU but also\nEMU very early, produce negative growth effects. In addition, effects of anticipatory\nrecessions may arise. These may be based on anticipated future expenditures of western EU\ncountries for bailing out new member countries in trouble, in order to prevent economic\ndecline and political disorder, which would have negative spillovers on the western EU\ncountries and could jeopardise the whole project of European integration and its\nenlargement. The likelihood of bail-outs, despite of the \"no bail-out\" clause in Article\n104b of the ECT, increases as soon as the CEECCs have adopted the euro and thus become\n\"full\" members of the union (increased political pressure within a union53). This\nlikelihood also increases, the more problem cases arise (which is dependent upon the\ntiming and the \"broadness\" of the accession strategy of the EU), because this would raise\nthe extent of the negative spillovers on the western EU countries.\nIt shall be shown in this section that this pitfall can be modelled by deriving\nunder/overshooting tendencies in interest rates within a traditional dynamic\nmacroeconomic model. Based on these under/overshooting tendencies, an anticipatory\nrecession in the context of the EMU enlargement process may arise. This anticipatory\nrecession may produce a retardation or even a reversal of the enlargement process. The\nmodel, its implications and its restrictions can be discussed only briefly here.54\nThe logical structure of the kind of models referred to is as follows. For ease of graphical\nexposition, one starts with two endogenous variables, the financial market price and a\ngoods market variable. The financial market price jumps discontinuously in anticipation of\n53 See also the statements in section III.1 above.\n54 In the following, I shall draw heavily on an earlier publication (Wagner 1996).\nfuture events. The goods market variable is \"sticky\"; i.e., it adjusts gradually over time.\nAdjustment following unanticipated exogenous disturbances to policy variables\n(representing the \"fundamentals\") follows a unique saddle path. This assumes that the\nspeculative bubble paths eventually collapse to the relevant saddle path. Such models\nexhibit financial market overshooting in reaction to monetary disturbances and\nundershooting with respect to goods market disturbances. In the following only the\nsimplest version of such models, which is an integrated world model, is discussed.\nActually, it is a version of an Aoki average model (Aoki 1981) and a dynamic version of a\nworld ISLM model discussed in Branson et al. (1986). The same model without equation\n(20) but with price dynamics is used in Wagner (1991) (see also in more detail, Branson\n1992). Here the financial variables are bond prices and short-term and long-term interest\nrates, and the fundamentals are monetary and fiscal policy. The model illustrates the\npossibility that an anticipated fiscal expansion can cause a recession by driving up long-\nterm interest rates.\nThe following exposition is based on the simplest fixed-price ISLM model of a closed\neconomy or here the `European economy'. This, however, is sufficient to describe the link\nfrom fundamentals to expectation dynamics in financial markets. Price dynamics will be\nadded at the end of this section. The basic model can be expressed in four equations:\n(17) yd = cy - a(iL - e) + d Aggregate Demand\n(18) m - p = ky - biS LM\n\u00b7\n= f(yd - y) Gradual output adjustment\nL\nL i\ni\ni\n^\nE -\n= Terms structure of interest rates\n(yd = aggregate demand; y = output; iL = long-term nominal interest rate; iS = short-term\nnominal interest rate; d = budget deficit; e= expected inflation; m = nominal money\nbalances; p = price level; E = rational expectations operator; c, a k, b and f are parameters;\nall variables except interest rates are in logarithms. Note: a hat (^) over a variable denotes\nits proportional rate of change and a dot, its time derivative.)\nEquation (17) gives aggregate demand as a function of output, the real long-term (actually\nconsol) interest rate, and budget deficit (i.e. the exogenous component of fiscal policy).\nExpenditure is, in Keynesian fashion, assumed to be a function of current income. The\nexpected inflation rate e\n is given exogenously in equation (17), and set at zero for the\ntime being. It will be endogenised later. Equation (18) is the traditional LM curve equating\nreal money supply and demand. The short-term interest rate is assumed to clear the money\n\n\nmarket at all times. Equation (19) gives the change in output over time as a gradual\nadjustment to the excess of demand over output. Equation (20) specifies the term structure\nof interest rates.55 It provides one link with the future and thus brings expectation\ndynamics into the model. For the bond market to be in equilibrium, the long-term interest\nrate must be expected to rise (i.e., the consol price to fall), if the long-short differential (iL-\niS) is positive, to generate a capital loss that offsets the rate differential.56 The dynamics of\nthe model are described in the ISLM diagram of Figure 1.\nThe stationary equilibrium is at point A, where .\ni\ni\nand\ny\ny S\nL\nd =\n= Away from\nequilibrium, y and L\ni move along the saddle path XX, whereas S\ni moves along the LM\ncurve. The XX saddle path comes from the combination of equation (20) and the\nassumption of rational expectations in financial markets. (In this nonstochastic model,\nrational expectations equals perfect foresight.) The XX path has two essential properties:\nfirst, it leads to the equilibrium and, second, along this path the expected movement of\nlong-term rates is realised. All other paths explode away from the equilibrium. They are so-\ncalled \"bubble\" paths. Assuming that the market seeks out the stable XX path, is equivalent\nto supposing that speculative bubbles are unsustainable, i.e., they eventually collapse. Later\nin this section this assumption will be questioned.\n56 By assuming that any long-short differential must be equal to the expected rate of change of the long rate,\nwe ignore the risk premium, which we set to zero.\nA\nThe effects of anticipated future expenditures of western EU countries for bailing out new\nmember countries in trouble can now be interpreted as an announcement of a future\noutward shift in the IS curve of the world economy. This is illustrated in Figure 2.\nWith the economy at point A, a future autonomous demand expansion is announced. The\nfinancial markets will understand that the future equilibrium is at point D, with higher\ninterest rates. That is, the long-term rate L\ni will jump immediately. It will jump to iL\nin\nFigure 2 with output at\ny . This depresses investment and pushes the economy into\nrecession along the unstable branch from point B to point C. Output and the short-term\ninterest rate fall to\ny and\niS\nrespectively, while the long-term interest rate rises to iL\n. When the actual demand\nexpansion occurs, the recovery begins. Output will increase from\ny to\ny , with the short-\nterm and long-term rates rising to converge to D. What is important here, is that the\nfinancial market's anticipation of the future demand expansion raises the present long-term\ninterest rate and thus pushes the economy into an anticipatory recession.\nFuture IS\nThe equilibrium path in the above model is a saddle path that has the two mentioned\nproperties: it goes into the equilibrium, and along this path expectations are realised. The\nfirst property rules out speculative bubble paths that go off to infinity. There are at least\ntwo problems with this common line of reasoning. The first is the existence of\nheterogeneous agents in the financial markets, and the second is the potential existence of\npolicy bounds on price movements.\nTo the first point: if agents are heterogeneous, i.e., differ in their knowledge or beliefs\nabout the system, and know that they differ, the question of who acts first arises. This\nmakes the timing of the collapse uncertain, and eliminates the presumption that a bubble\ncannot even begin. (If all market participants were the same, then, when one participant\nsees that the price is on a bubble path, all would act simultaneously so that the bubble\ncollapses. If the agents' knowledge is complete, a bubble could never start.)\nTo the second point: another problem with the no-bubble assumption arises if the market\nbelieves that the government will intervene to prevent the financial market price from\nmoving too far. The clearest example is a credible target zone for the interest rate. Then the\nmarket has no reason to prefer the saddle path over any bubble path that goes to the edge of\nthe zone. (In the context of exchange rate volatility, see Choe (1987), and for the stochastic\nThus we cannot rule out the existence of bubbles and the implied indeterminacy. Thus, the\nJ-curve enlargement costs derived in the above model are types of minimum costs to which\nthe possibility of bubbles and an accompanying aggravation of the anticipatory recession\nmust be added. This means J-curve effects can well extend to structural crises that may\nendanger the whole enlargement process as well as the objective of real convergence in the\nThe main thesis of this chapter is that an over-hasty attempt to accede to the European\nmonetary union as quickly as possible, can be very costly for some (namely the\ntechnologically and institutionally least developed) of the candidate countries but indirectly\nalso for the other candidate countries and the EU core countries. The core argument is that,\nby trying to enter EMU at a low real convergence level (with a high technology or\ninstitutional gap), the goal of real convergence may be missed. This argument was\nsupplemented by a simple endogenous growth model. The model used in this chapter,\nhowever, should only be regarded as a first approach to support the general argument\ndeveloped above. Further research should stress the government's intertemporal budget\nconstraint. Thereby one could derive a decrease in government expenditure and a\nsimultaneous increase in the tax rate as a consequence of, or compensation for, the loss of\nmonetary and debt financing of budget deficits. Both measures would decrease output and\ntherefore tend to lead to real divergence.57\nHowever, the core argument can also be substantiated and it can also be criticised without\nthe model. Which counter-arguments could be used? The main counter-argument would be\nthat the danger of real divergence derived above may be only a phoney danger, as the\naccession to E(M)U may induce endogenous adjustment processes that suppress this\npotential danger. Furthermore, it could be argued that, even if the endogenous forces did\nnot suffice, the governments would have enough simple economic policy measures to\ncounteract the described danger. Both aspects will be briefly discussed in an argument\nversus counterargument-style in this section.\nFirst, it is sometimes contended that the flow of IRUHLJQ GLUHFW LQYHVWPHQW into the\naccession countries will increase after the accession to E(M)U. This flow of foreign direct\ninvestment would imply technology spillovers and thus affect learning by doing and induce\ninstitutional reforms. This would produce positive productivity and growth effects.\nHowever, if the initial infrastructure conditions in the accession countries are weak58, the\npotential for learning effects (via technology spillovers) induced by foreign direct\ninvestment, and thus for growth effects in the accession countries, is low. Moreover, there\nis the danger that the flow of foreign direct investment fails to materialise or even\ndecreases when the economic development does not develop as positively as expected.59\nSecond, it can be expected that, by transferring monetary policy to the ECB and thereby\ngiving up the possibility of seigniorage financing, the accession countries can hope for an\nimprovement of SROLWLFDO VWDELOLW\\ and a reduction of the risk premium in the interest rate\nof government bonds. This, together with the competition arising from increased price and\n58 As argued, an improvement of the infrastructure conditions may be prevented by the restrictive fiscal\npolicy that may be necessary for fulfilling the nominal convergence criteria and for complying with the\nrules of the Stability and Growth Pact.\n59 One could also argue that the \"goal conflict\" between real and nominal convergence is defused if public\ninfrastructure is financed by foreign direct investment.\nCounterargument: Financing of public infrastructure by foreign direct investment is likely to be dependent\nupon the expectation of real convergence. If real convergence is not expected (any more), an outflow, not\nonly of portfolio capital, but (with some time lag) also of foreign direct investment, is likely, as the Asian\ncrisis has shown.\ncost transparency, could induce an endogenous impetus for institutional reform and\npositive growth effects. This expectation is usually substantiated by referring to the\nexperiences of the southern member countries of the EU and Ireland after their accession to\nHowever, again, the extent of this reform and growth impetus depends upon the initial\ninfrastructure conditions. Moreover, the comparison with the southern EU countries does\nnot work since the former accession countries had longer time periods to adjust, and real\nconvergence was further developed there compared to that in the present accession\ncountries.\nThird, against the background of increasing competition after accession to E(M)U,\nrigidities and inflexibilities on the ODERXU PDUNHW are expected to decline so that the costs\nof disinflation may also decline. In principle, this is possible; however, it appears to be\nequally likely that there will be institutional incrustation: There is a real danger that, after\naccession to EMU, the demand for a quick(er) adjustment to the living standards of the\nEU-core countries will increase in the new member countries. This may occur in the form\nof D higher wage demands (the demand for wage adjustment will be stronger when the\nwages are directly comparable in the same currency and when labour flexibility increases\nwithin the EU, inducing threats to exit), and E demands to adjust the welfare legislation to\nthat of the richer member countries. These demands will be substantiated by expected club\nsolidarity expressed in transfer payments and bail out actions in economic crises (despite\ncontrary agreements in the Maastricht Treaty). This solidarity may be enforced F through\npolitical pressure, i.e. threatening to use blocking power (exercising veto rights and\nblocking decisions which are in the interest of the core countries), G through permanent\ndominance of EU-summits with distribution debates,60 H possibly also through increased\nunion power based on centralisation of the unions beyond country borders, enforcing\nadjustment to the more inflexible labour legislation in the EU core countries.\nIf this danger of institutional incrustation materialises, the real convergence process would\nbe slowed down if not stopped.61 The development in East Germany (the new\n60 Both will weaken the political decision capability of the EU-organisations and will destabilise the EU.\n61 The hope that the unions in the accession countries would be content with lower wage demands, since they\nare smaller relative to the monetary area and therefore have no chance of influencing the ECB, is naive, as\nsuch demands can be transferred and emphasised through political pressure. Moreover, one can argue that\nthe unions have already taken into account the effects on the international competitiveness of the firms\nthat have already been exposed to the international competition process. Therefore, union behaviour\nshould not change too much after accession to EMU. Instead of resulting in lower wage demands, the fact\nthat the unions in the accession countries become smaller relative to the monetary area is even more likely\nto decrease their perception of the inflationary repercussions of their individual wages, thus inducing them\nto more aggressive wage demands (Cukierman and Lippi 2001).\nbundesl\u00e4nder) after the currency union with West Germany can be used as a warning\nexample.\nEven if the hopes for endogenous upgrading and greater flexibility on the labour markets\neventuate, the implementation of better structure and institutions would take time.\nHowever, given sufficient time, the scenario of real divergence could then become a\nreality.\nOne could further argue that, even if there is no endogenous solution to the problem,\ngovernments could easily master the problem by conducting appropriate economic policy\nmeasures. Two political solutions are obvious: \"easing\" the entrance criteria for the new\naccession countries, and \"creative\" bookkeeping or financing.\nThere are well-founded economic reasons for arguing that the nominal convergence criteria\nset up in the Maastricht Treaty and the stipulations in the Stability Pact are too restrictive\nfor the CEECCs. First, as argued above, the demand for public infrastructure investment\nand its marginal productivity is high in the CEECCs, so that less restrictive fiscal accession\ncriteria appear to be appropriate for those countries. Second, the Balassa-Samuelson-effect,\nthat substantiates higher inflation in emerging economies, apparently justifies a less\nrestrictive inflation accession criterion for the faster growing CEECCs.\nHowever, an easing of the accession criteria for the new accession countries would violate\nthe principle of equal treatment between the initial EMU members and those that join the\nmonetary union later. Moreover, it would lead to credibility problems on the financial\nmarkets with the consequence that the risk premium in the interest rate of government\nbonds increases and the external value of the euro weakens.\nThe above justification for higher optimal rates of inflation and budget deficits in the\ntransition process may be understood as an attempt to legitimise the characterisation of the\nMaastricht convergence criteria as \"artificial constraints\" and therefore to try to circumvent\nthem in a \"creative\" way. Sometimes \"creative\" bookkeeping or financing, such as\nexpenditure switching to shadow budgets, is suggested. However, any such strategies\nwould lead to a loss of confidence on the financial and foreign exchange markets and thus\nincrease the risk premium in the interest rate of government bonds of these countries and\nhurt the external value of the euro.\nIn contrast, privatisation could be regarded as the \"correct\" way to master the problem.\nHowever, it has to be considered that privatisation can often only be implemented slowly\nand with public opposition. Furthermore, it may be doubted that, after privatisation, all so-\ncalled public goods are still supplied in sufficient quantities; it may result in a deficient\nsupply of public infrastructure and institutions, which are important for the catching-up\nprocess in the candidate countries.\nIn summary, it may be dangerous for CEECCs to accede to EMU with all possible speed\nand rely on endogenous or simple and quick political solutions of the problems described\nabove. The candidate countries should recognise that they face a decision dilemma between\ntwo evils or dangers, namely between the danger of financial instability in the period prior\nto euro-introduction, and the danger of real divergence (or slow real convergence) in the\nperiod after euro-introduction in the case of an over-hasty attempt to accede to the EMU as\nquickly as possible. The extent of either danger is negatively correlated with the state or\nlevel of real and nominal convergence already attained by the single candidate countries at\nthe point of time of EU-accession. The problem, particularly for those candidate countries\nthat lag behind in terms of real and nominal convergence, is that the fear of financial\ninstability in the period prior to euro-introduction is likely to cause them to be eager to\nkeep the period between EU- and EMU-accession very short. However, it is exactly these\ncountries that have the most to fear from the danger of slipping into real divergence if they\ntry to make the period between EU- and EMU-accession too short.\nFrom an economic point of view, it would be better to conduct E(M)U-enlargement in\nsmall convoys or on a single country basis instead of accepting the accession of a large\nconvoy consisting of countries with different conditions of real and nominal convergence.\nIn contrast, an immediate unilateral euroisation of all CEECCs, which is sometimes\nproposed (Dornbusch and Giavazzi 1999), would solve the first of the above evils or\ndangers but would aggravate the second evil or danger, at least for the least developed\nOur analysis assumes that the CEECCs will not only try to enter the EU as quickly as\npossible but also to adopt the euro at an early date.62 This is justified by the effort to avoid\nthe danger of financial instability in the period prior to euro-introduction. However, by\ntrying to avoid this danger, the CEECCs, at least the (economically, institutionally and\ntechnologically) less developed, may run into another danger or pitfall, namely of real\ndivergence (or slow real convergence). The paper investigates these dangers or pitfalls. It\nargues that for some accession countries the costs of an entry at an early date may be very\nhigh, and that there may also be negative spillovers for the other accession countries and\nfor the EU core countries.\nThe probability of this scenario arising is higher, the greater are the political pressures to\nadopt the euro as quickly as possible after the EU entrance in those (less developed)\naccession countries. However, entry into the EU does not guarantee acceptance into the\nmonetary union. The question is whether the EU, given the warnings of the dangers or\npitfalls of such a speedy procedure, will and can slow down this process of adoption of the\neuro by immature candidate countries after their admission to the EU. The answer tends to\nbe negative since the new EU member states will have blocking power in the Ecofin\nCouncil over a variety of matters requiring unanimous consent. They can use this power to\nblock progress on other matters if the incumbents try to delay the enlargement of EMU. A\nspecial problem exists in that the earlier the EU-enlargement is implemented and the\nbroader the EU-enlargement process, the earlier the danger of real divergence may become\nvirulent. That is, a political decision or compromise to let many CEECCs into the EU at a\nvery early point of time increases the probability of being confronted with countries which,\nbecause of economic or political reasons or pressures (or national prestige), speed up\nfulfilment of the Maastricht convergence criteria in a very short period of time to be able\nto adopt the euro as quickly as possible. The main danger is that this results in a real\ndivergence process where some of the CEECCs will lag behind more and more, so that the\nother EU core countries will politically be forced to bail these countries out. As soon as the\nfinancial markets assign a high enough probability to this scenario, this may result in a\nsignificant EU-wide increase in interest rates and thus, at the worst, lead to an anticipatory\nrecession. This danger has to be weighted against the main argument for a rapid EU-\n62 See Eichengreen and Ghironi (2001) for a discussion of the reasons why the CEECCs will seek DQG JDLQ\nentry at an early date.\nenlargement: that countries that have a prospect of joining the EU seem to have (had) more\nfocus to their reform efforts.\nThe above discussion resembles the debate about the right timing and sequencing of the\nreforms in the transformation process a decade ago. The two main strategies of entering the\nEMU that the CEECCs can choose are: a \"big bang\" strategy, and a \"gradualistic\" way. A\n\"big bang\" strategy tries to implement reforms as fast as possible no matter how costly they\nare in the short run. (An extreme case example of a \"big bang\" strategy is the transition\nprocess in East Germany (Sinn and Sinn 1991; Wagner 1993).) Such a strategy is not very\npromising when it implies a drastic temporary decrease in living standards for most people\nand big redistributions in wealth that are regarded as unjust by the population. (This has\nlargely been avoided in East Germany by huge transfer payments from West to East\nGermany. None of the CEECCs can, not even approximately, expect such big transfer\npayments.) Moreover, a big bang approach is hindered by the unavoidable time it takes to\nchange fundamental societal institutions, the implementation of which is a precondition for\nother necessary institutional changes. (Here, East Germany has had the big advantage in\nthat it could take over almost the whole institutional infrastructure from West Germany.\nNonetheless, the transition process in East Germany today is often characterised to have\nbeen a failure or disaster, measured on a cost-benefit-scale.63)\nBy contrast, a \"gradualistic\" strategy tries to spread the transition costs over a longer period\nof time. As this strategy gives the CEECCs more time needed to establish necessary\ninstitutions in the beginning for efficiently managing the transition challenge, the transition\ncosts associated with a gradualistic approach may even be lower. However, a gradualistic\nstrategy is often regarded as hesitant behaviour. This can lead to a loss in credibility of the\nreform policy or the reform will of the government. Consequently, the private initiatives\nstarted by governmental measures slow down. The implementation of reform measures\ncan, therefore, fail. Furthermore, it is often a matter of national prestige to insist on not\nlagging behind neighbour CEECCs in their speed of accession, regardless of the fact that\nthe readiness to accede depends critically on the initial conditions faced by the respective\ncountries which are different between the individual CEECCs. This is sufficient reason to\nbelieve that most of the CEECCs will choose a big bang strategy on their way to Euroland.\nThe EU Commission and the Council can control this process only imperfectly since they\nwill only assess the attainment of the nominal Maastricht convergence criteria and not the\ncurrent and future costs associated with the strategy chosen in the respective country.\n63 The reason is that not all of the institutional infrastructure that then was taken over has been appropriate\nfor a transition country such as East Germany.\nSumming up, the larger the development gap between a CEECC and the average EU\ncountry, the more favourable is a more flexible exchange rate regime for the CEECC to\naccommodate potential inflationary shocks. The requirement to meet the convergence\ncriterions not only before but also after EMU-entrance as well, may (for some less mature\ncandidate countries) argue against entering into a rigidly fixed exchange rate system\nbecause it would not leave room for a nominal appreciation of the currency to help bring\ndown inflation. The burden would then fall entirely on other policies at a cost which may\nbe unjustified.\nThe main challenges of an early EMU enlargement for monetary policy are as follows.\nAs the candidate countries join the EU, the incumbents, concerned about low-wage\ncompetition from the east, are likely to insist on the provision in the Maastricht Treaty that\nrequires countries that have joined the EU but are not yet part of the monetary union to\nparticipate in an ERM-II, which will constrain the flexibility of their exchange rates. But\nexchange rate bands are fragile and crisis prone. The main risk to their qualifying is a\ncurrency crisis leading to their forceable ejection from the ERM-II, precipitated by\nproblems in the banking sector64. Therefore (and because of political or national prestige\nreasons), the accession economies will want to exit the exchange rate bands of ERM-II as\nquickly as possible by entering the monetary union.\nHowever, enlargement to the east will imply a more heterogeneous monetary union. The\nnew member countries will lag behind the incumbents in terms of development stage, and,\nin particular, their standards of living. The question is whether that heterogeneity will be\nonly transitional or will persist. On the one hand, the accession countries will try to catch\nup to EU per capita GDP levels. This will put continuous pressure on spending and\ndownward pressure on central bank rates. This harbours risks, especially before important\nelections. On the other hand, if an accession country, which lags behind the incumbents\neconomically, institutionally and technologically, sticks to quickly adopting the euro, the\nrisk scenario of a divergent development with a widening gap in the standards of living\namong the member countries within the E(M)U may be realised.\n64 A banking crisis occurring before the decision was taken to admit an accession country would have major\nbudgetary costs, and could jeopardise the ability of the country to satisfy preconditions of participation in\nthe ERM-II without involuntary devaluations. As currency speculators know that the authorities would\nhave to inject liquidity to prop up the banking system, they have an incentive to attack the currency.\nTherefore, a banking crisis could force an ERM-II member to devalue involuntarily, providing the EU\nwith a rational for denying it early admission to EMU.\nIn the absence of sufficient institutional upgrading (which takes time), there will be the\ndanger of continued real divergence between the EU incumbents and new members (as\nexplained above). After EMU enlargement, this will force the incumbents to bail out new\nmembers that continue to lag behind65 and also put the ECB under pressure to participate\nin such bail out actions and thus places considerable strain on the common monetary\npolicy.66 Knowing or anticipating this will lead to reactions on the international financial\nmarkets that may even create an anticipatory recession. This again would put pressure onto\nthe ECB's monetary policy. However, this risk scenario is only relevant if institutional\nupgrading to EU levels continues to lag. At least for the medium run, there is hope that the\nupgrading of institutions is endogenous in that integration into the Single Market and the\nMonetary Union will intensify the pressure on the accession economies to upgrade their\ninstitutions as otherwise labour will flow out and capital will have no incentive to flow in.\nMoreover, enlargement will enhance labour mobility within the EMU and thereby ease its\nmembers' adjustment to shocks. The key question, however, is whether the peer pressure\nand mutual surveillance that E(M)U membership entails will sufficiently accelerate the\nprocess of institutional reform, or whether institutional incrustation and demands to adjust\nwages and the welfare legislation to that of the richer incumbents materialise.\nIn contrast, if institutions are upgraded to levels representative of the EU incumbents, the\nCEECCs will grow considerably faster than the present EMU members, thus producing a\ntendency toward real convergence. However, greater dispersion of growth rates will imply\ngreater dispersion of national inflation rates due to the operation of the Balassa-Samuelson\neffect. This again intensifies the strains on monetary policy. Monetary policy will be pulled\nin competing directions, increasing the difficulties created by a \"one-size-fits-all\" policy\nand placing additional political pressures on the ECB.\nMonetary policy alone cannot do much to avoid the pitfalls highlighted above, because\nfirst, the choice of the exchange rate regime is not usually up to the central bank, and\nsecond, monetary policy alone will not be able to affect real convergence or divergence\npaths in a significant way.67 However, monetary authorities should try to be prepared for\nthe challenges that would come if the crisis situations described above eventuate. The main\ntask of the central banks in CEECCs that do not have a hard peg is to adopt a monetary\npolicy strategy which serves as an appropriate nominal anchor. Furthermore, central\n65 One can imagine that all EU-summits would then be dominated by distribution policy matters.\n66 There will be strong political pressure, not only on the other member countries to fiscally bail these\nproblem countries out, but also on the European Central Bank to lower interest rates. In this case, there\nwould be a real danger that, despite the precautions set up in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and\nGrowth Pact, politicians (including those in the ECB) would eventually give in to this pressure.\n67 Rather one would guess that monetary policy tends to be neutral with respect to long-term growth.\nbankers of Western member states can (at best) try to convince their colleagues in the\ncandidate countries not to support in public the popular, however dangerous, route of an\nASAP-accession-strategy,68 at least not as long as they are not sure whether the adaptation\nor transition costs can be politically mastered. (In principal, one may hope that the above\nconsiderations also shape decision-making by the candidate countries (rational-\nexpectations hypothesis), so that these countries deliberately renounce pressing for an early\nadmission to the EMU. However, there are also political pressures (national prestige etc)\nwhich have to be considered, and they play a role and can force a government into the\ndangerous goal of a too early EMU entrance.)\nMonetary authorities could also (if they choose) try to make the dangers of a `hasty'\naccession transparent and warn other political authorities and the public about the costs of a\nbig bang enlargement strategy. This, however, will only be useful if the main reason for\nfollowing or accepting such a strategy is a lack of knowledge or information. If, however,\nthe reason is different views or interpretations of the reality or transmission mechanism\n(model uncertainty) or political pressures (different values or preferences), the influence of\ncentral banks is very limited. Then the only implication may be: wait and see, hope for the\nendogeneity of institutional upgrading, and be prepared with the solutions should the risk\nscenarios be realised.\nA further and last pitfall that shall be mentioned here only briefly is the implications of\nEMU enlargement for ECB policy formulation, i.e. for the ability of the ECB decision-\nmaking process to handle larger numbers of participants69. Without a major reform prior to\nenlargement of the monetary union, the Governing Council will consist of six Executive\nBoard members plus anywhere from 17 to 28 national central bank governors. A risk\nscenario sometimes talked of is that countries accounting for less than, say, a third of euro-\nzone economic activity, where the conditions were quite different from those in the rest of\nthe monetary union, could dictate the common monetary policy. This could be the case if\nthe six Executive Board members were outvoted by a coalition of national representatives\nof the large accession group and a group of smaller member incumbent countries who\nprefer a different policy, suitable for only a small part of the EMU economy. A more\nimportant problem, however, is that the EMU enlargement will slow the ECB decision-\nmaking process. However, an ECB that is slow to react to shocks would enjoy neither\npolicy credibility nor political support.\n68 ASAP here stands for \"as soon as possible\".\nCountries\nPopulation\n(millions,\nPrivate sector\nshare of GDP\nestimate)1\nLarge-scale\nprivatisation\nSmall-scale\nprivatisation\nGovernance &\nenterprise\nrestructuring\nPrice\nliberalisation\nTrade &\nforeign\nexchange\nsystem\nCompetition\npolicy\nBanking\nreform &\ninterest rate\nliberalisation\nSecurities\nmarkets &\nnon-bank\nfinancial\ninstitutions\nThe measurement scale for the indicators ranges from 1 to 4+, where 1 represents little or no change from the previous regime and 4+ represents a standard that would\nnot look out of place in an industrialised market economy.\nEnterprises Markets and trade Financial institutions\n1 The \"private sector shares\" of GDP represents rough EBRD estimates, based on available statistics from both official (government) sources and unofficial sources.\nThe underlying concept of private sector value added includes income generated by the activity of private registered companies as well as by private entities engaged in\ninformal activity in those cases where reliable information on informal activity is available.
