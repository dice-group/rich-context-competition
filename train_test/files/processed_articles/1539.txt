Two-thirds of the US adult popula-\ntion is overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI)\nX25, and the prevalence of obesity (BMI X30) has doubled\nweight and obesity increases the population's risks of several\nobesity-related illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes and\nhypertension.4\u00ad6 Modest weight loss treatment targets of\n5\u00ad10% of initial body weight are recommended based on the\nevidence that morbidity and mortality are significantly lower\nat this level, although any intentional weight loss improves\nhealth in patients with comorbidities.7,8\nHelping patients lose weight and keep it off, however,\nremains a vexing public health problem. On average,\ncurrent state-of-the-art behavioral weight loss programs\nproduce weight losses of 10% of initial body weight over\n30 weeks.9,10 Although many patients have weight regain,\nsome individuals are successful at both losing weight and\nmaintaining this weight loss over the long term. The\nidentification of individuals who are able to achieve long-\nterm weight loss maintenance (LTWLM) may allow for\nfurther development of interventions to aid others in\nmaintaining weight loss.\nDespite the wealth of data on obesity rates and efficacy of\nclinical trials of weight loss treatments, little information\nCorrespondence: Dr CN Sciamanna, Division of General Internal Medicine,\nDepartment of Public Health Sciences, 500 University Drive, H034, Penn State\nE-mail: CSciamanna@hmc.psu.edu\nThe information presented in this paper has been presented at the March\n2008 national meeting of the Society for Behavioral Medicine in San Diego,\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nexists about the epidemiology of individuals achieving\nLTWLM. Much of the data to address this issue come from\ntwo sources: published clinical trials and the National\nWeight-Control Registry (NWCR).11,12 The NWCR is a\ndatabase of individuals who were recruited initially based\non their being able to lose at least 13.6 kg of their body\nweight (average, 30 kg) and keep it off for at least 1 year\n(average, 5 years).11 The NWCR, however, is not population\nbased and is therefore not useful for providing estimates of\nLTWLM in the United  .11\nThe goals of this study were to provide nationally\nrepresentative estimates and correlates of LTWLM among\nUS adults. On the basis of the evidence that loss of at least\n10% consistently produce beneficial changes to health-risk\nfactors, we defined LTWLM as losing 10% of maximum body\nweight and keeping it off for at least 1 year.7,12\nSubjects and methods\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), an annual survey\nevaluating the health and nutrition of a representative\nportion of the US population. We included surveys from\nweight history questionnaire was added to NHANES. The\ndata were collected through in-home interviews using a\nstandard questionnaire, which has been described in pre-\nWeight status and weight history were evaluated using\nseveral self-reported measures. Self-reported measures were\nused because measured weight was only available for\nindividuals' current weight, not their maximum weight or\nweight 1 year ago. Maximum weight was assessed by the\nquestion, `Up to the present time, what is the most you have\never weighed?'; weight 1 year ago by, `How much did you\nweigh a year ago?'; current weight by, `How much do you\nweigh without clothes or shoes?'; and current height by,\n`How tall are you without shoes?' The question that assessed\nmaximum weight asked women to exclude maximum\nweights during pregnancy. Individuals who lost at least\n10 pounds in the previous year were asked, `Was the change\nbetween your current weight and your weight a year ago\nintentional?' BMI was calculated by dividing the partici-\npant's self-reported weight in kilograms by the self-reported\nheight in meters squared. These values were then classified\nNational Institutes of Health cut-points.\nFor this study, we calculated whether or not each\non the self-reported maximum weight, weight 1 year ago and\ncurrent weight. For example, for an individual to meet the\ncriterion of X5% LTWLM, an individual's weight 1 year ago,\nas well as their current weight, would have to be X5% less\nthan their maximum weight.\nThe demographic variables analyzed included gender, age,\nrace/ethnicity, education level and marital status, according\nto standard NHANES categories. Weight-related variables\nincluded current BMI categories, years since the maximum\nweight and current weight-control status (attempting to lose\nand maintain weight, attempting to lose weight only,\nattempting to maintain weight only and neither attempting\nto lose nor maintain weight). We also included several health\nquestions taken from NHANES, including the diabetes\nquestionnaire, blood pressure and cholesterol questionnaire,\nand current health status questionnaire including high\ncholesterol (yes, no), hypertension (yes, no), diabetes (yes,\nno) and overall health (poor, fair, good, very good,\nexcellent).\nParticipants were excluded if their maximum BMI was\nfinal sample size included 14 306 individuals. Data were\nweighted according to the NHANES analytical guidelines to\naccount for the complex sampling design and were analyzed\nusing weighted methods, primarily bivariate and multi-\nvariate logistic regression, with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute\ntables represent weighted analyses and reflect nationally\nrepresentative estimates.\nResults\nDemographic and weight-control characteristics of 14 306\nUS adults who were ever overweight or obese, representing\nshown in Table 1.

First, individuals who participate in clinical trials\nmay be less likely to have long-term success, possibly because\nthis is a selected population.17 Second, some of the current\nweight loss experienced in our estimates includes uninten-\ntional weight loss. Third, there may be a substantial number\nof individuals who may experience weight gain during a\nparticular time in their life but manage to return to a normal\nweight, such as those who gain the `freshman 15' when\nentering college. Given the brevity of such experiences, these\nindividuals would be less likely to be included in clinical\ntrials, but would be captured in our analysis. Finally, we\nreport on individuals who maintain a weight loss of 45%\nbelow their maximum weight, whereas clinical trials will\noften capture participants who maintain weight below their\nbaseline weight upon entry into the trial. Again, clinical\ntrials will be less likely to capture individuals at their\nmaximum weight.\nLTWLM was more common among women, older adults,\nindividuals who reported poor overall health and those with\nless than a high school education. We observed that 19.1% of\nLTWLM of at least 10% and that recent weight losses were\nmore likely to be intentional for women. This variation in\nLTWLM by gender may occur as a result of different uses of\nweight-control behaviors. Neumark-Sztainer et al.18 observed\nthat women were more likely than men to report dieting and\nusing each of the 23 weight-control practices surveyed,\nsupporting our observation that LTWLM was more common\nin women. Although we found that LTWLM was more\ncommon in older adults (age 75\u00ad84 years), this population\nwas more likely to have unintentional weight loss. In\naddition, patients with diabetes had a higher prevalence of\nLTWLM. This is encouraging, but not surprising, given the\nconsistent recommendations from the American Diabetes\nAssociation and other professional organizations for patients\nwith type 2 diabetes to lose weight.19 In addition, individuals\nwith diabetes were much more likely to report poor health,\nwhich was also associated with LTWLM. Individuals with less\nthan a high school education also had a higher prevalence of\nLTWLM. Further research is necessary to examine the reason\nwhy these individuals are more successful with LTWLM.\nAn interesting finding was that 480% of the US adults\nwho were overweight or obese reported their health as\n`good', `very good' or `excellent'. This finding is despite a\nsignificant percentage of individuals with hypertension\n(82%) and/or hyperlipidemia (42%). Obesity has been shown\nto have a negative impact on self-rated health among adults,\neven in the absence of comorbidities.20\u00ad22 However, this\npopulation does have a percentage of participants who are\ncurrently overweight (45.6%), which has been shown to be\nassociated with a slight reduction of self-rated health.20,23 In\naddition, 17.4% of individuals were normal weight, which\nwould not be expected to influence overall reported health.\nWe also found that only one in three individuals had a\ncurrent weight-control goal to lose weight. Health-related\nquality of life, or more generally, health status, have been\nfound to influence weight loss effort.24\u00ad26 This raises\nconcerns for the potential implications of overweight and\nobese individuals with positively rated health and their\nresultant motivation to lose weight. However, multiple\nfactors influence weight loss motivation, especially in\nfore, it is not entirely surprising that a minority of\nindividuals were attempting to lose weight.\nPhysician advice also has an important role in the decision\nto lose weight.24 Therefore, it is important for health\nprofessionals to understand the true prevalence of long-term\nweight loss, as it may help to change the underlying beliefs\nand influence clinical practice. Foster and colleagues ob-\nserved that physicians rated the treatment of obesity as\nsignificantly less effective than therapies for 9 of 10 other\nTable 3 (continued)\nCharacteristic Percentage with LTWLM OR (95% CI) unadjusted OR (95% CI) adjusted\nHypertension\nDiabetes\nSurvey years\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; GED, General Equivalency Diploma; LTWLM, long-term weight loss maintenance; NHANES, National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey; OR, odds ratio. aAll percentages are population percentages estimated from a weighted analysis taking into consideration\nthe complex sampling stratification and clustering. *Po005, **Po0.01, ***Po0.001, ORs and P-values from weighted logistic regression taking into consideration\nthe complex sampling stratification and clustering, adjusted analyses using significant demographic variables from unadjusted analyses as covariates (age, gender,\nrace, education, marital status, current BMI, diabetes).\nLong-term weight loss maintenance in United  \nJL Kraschnewski et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nTable 4 IWL in the previous year among individuals who were ever overweight (BMI X25) who reported at least a 10 pound loss in the previous year, NHANES\nCharacteristic Percentage with IWL OR (95% CI) unadjusted OR (95% CI) adjusted\nAge (years)\nGender\nRace\nEducation\nMarital status\nCurrent BMI (kg m\u00c02)\nMaximum BMI (kg m\u00c02)\nYears since reaching maximal weight\nOverall health\nHigh cholesterol\nHypertension\nLong-term weight loss maintenance in United  \nJL Kraschnewski et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nchronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes.27 Tsui\net al.28 observed that only one-quarter (27%) of physicians\nwere confident in their weight loss counseling skills.\nSciamanna et al.29 found that fewer than half (47.3%) of\nthe obese patients with a weight-related comorbidity (for\nexample, hypertension) reported having received advice to\nlose weight in the previous year from a health-care profes-\nsional. Although these studies did not directly measure the\nbelief that patients could actually lose weight and keep it off,\nthey suggest physicians may not believe offering weight loss\nadvice and counseling is a worthwhile activity in clinical\npractice. An awareness of our findings may encourage health\nprofessionals to pursue weight loss counseling for over-\nweight patients.\nIn addition to informing health-care providers, identifica-\ntion of a significant percentage of the population that is\nattempting and succeeding in some weight loss may be an\nimportant target population for weight maintenance pro-\ngrams. Although the amounts lost are modest, if a sub-\nstantial number of individuals achieved such losses, it would\nhave a significant public health effect. Particularly, those\nindividuals who have lost at least 5% and kept it off (one in\nthree ever-overweight Americans) may represent a unique\nopportunity to reach a target population who has had some\nsuccess but could benefit from greater weight loss efforts.\nThere are several potential limitations to this study. First,\nthis is a single time point study and we only have\ninformation of individuals' current, maximum and weight\n1 year ago. Therefore, we cannot determine the total\nduration of weight loss maintenance. In addition, we are\nunable to note whether individuals have experienced weight\nregain or weight cycling. For example, someone with a\nTable 4 (continued)\nCharacteristic Percentage with IWL OR (95% CI) unadjusted OR (95% CI) adjusted\nDiabetes\nSurvey years\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; GED, General Equivalency Diploma; IWL, intentionality of weight loss; NHANES, National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey; OR, odds ratio. aAll percentages are population percentages estimated from a weighted analysis taking into consideration the\ncomplex sampling stratification and clustering. *Po0.05, **Po0.01, ***Po0.001, ORs and P-values from weighted logistic regression taking into consideration\nthe complex sampling stratification and clustering, adjusted analyses using significant demographic variables from unadjusted analyses as covariates (age, gender,\nrace, education, marital status, current BMI).\nFigure 1 Distribution of weight lost by participants with 410% long-term\nweight loss maintenance.\nTable 5 Characteristics of participants of the NWCR compared with NHANES\nParticipant\ncharacteristics\nNWCR participantsa\nEducation (%)Fhigh\nschool or less\nEthnic status (%)\nNon-Hispanic African\nAmerican\nMarital status (%)\nDuration of weight loss\n(years)\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; LTWLM, long-term weight loss\nmaintenance; NWCR, National Weight-Control Registry; NHANES, National\never overweight (BMIX25) and had 10% long-term weight loss. cMean\u00b1s.e.\nLong-term weight loss maintenance in United  \nJL Kraschnewski et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nand currently weighs 85 kg would be classified as achieving\nLTWLM of 410%. However, it can be argued that this\nindividual still remains more successful at weight loss than\nhe or she was at their maximum weight.\nA second limitation is we were not able to determine the\nmethod of weight loss. Therefore, the data may include\nindividuals with unintentional weight lost from illness. One\nin three individuals with LTWLM of at least 10% reported\ntheir health as poor. Given the cross-sectional nature of this\nstudy, we are unable to determine when the weight loss\noccurred with respect to the individual's health. In addition,\nwe cannot determine whether those individuals with large\namounts of weight loss had undergone bariatric surgery.\nIncreasingly, surgery is a popular option for weight loss in\noverweight individuals. The number of people overall who\nundergo weight loss surgery, however, remains too small to\naffect our results. In 2002, rates of gastric bypass surgery were\nwe did not observe an increase in LTWLM over time.30\nAnother potential limitation is that the data are self-\nreported and therefore are subjected to recall problems in\naddition to over- and underestimation. Casey et al., however,\nreported that recall of past weight is relatively stable over\ntime and was affected by a mean underestimation of 1.98 kg\nfor men and 1.86 kg for women. Stevens et al.32 observed a\ncorrelation between reported and measured weights of 0.98\nweight 28 years ago. We expect some degree of inaccurate\ndata reported but, based on the available data supporting the\naccuracy of current and past weight reporting, these\ninaccuracies are unlikely to affect the main observations.\nA major strength of this study is the use of a large,\nnationally representative sampling of LTWLM in US adults.\nWe are aware of only a few studies that have examined the\nepidemiology of LTWLM in US adults. One study, limited to\nwomen in Iowa, examined weight loss that occurred\nbetween the ages of 18\u00ad30 years and evaluated for main-\ntenance of this weight loss (\u00b15%) between the ages of 30\nand 50 years.33 Using this narrow definition, investigators\nobserved that only 1.6% of the total sample was classified as\nhaving achieved LTWLM.33 A second study, by McGuire\net al.34, examined the rate of LTWLM in a random-digit-dial\nsurvey that included only individuals who were ever over-\nweight. One in five (20.6%) of the adults in the study\nintentionally lost at least 10% of their maximum weight and\nkept it off for at least 1 year. In comparison to the NWCR\nparticipants, a selected group of individuals recruited for\ntheir weight loss and maintenance efforts, NHANES offers a\npopulation-based sample and insight on estimates of\nLTWLM in the United  .11 Although Weiss et al.13 also\nexamined the NHANES population, their work focused\nlargely on weight regain and only includes participants from\nIn conclusion, more than one-sixth of individuals who has\never been overweight and obese are able to lose and maintain\nlong-term 10% weight loss, a success rate significantly better\nthan those reported in weight loss clinical trials. Although\nwe find this information encouraging, it remains clear that\nthe great majority of individuals who are overweight are not\nable to lose much weight and keep it off for the long term.\nThis suggests that the majority of Americans will be unable\nto maintain a significant amount of weight loss without a\nsignificant change in either the efficacy or availability of\nweight loss and weight maintenance interventions. Further\ninvestigation of the LTWLM methods of individuals who are\nable to achieve success may reveal important knowledge\nrelevant to the creation of successful weight maintenance\ninterventions.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n1 Ogden CL, Flegal KM, Carroll MD, Johnson CL.
