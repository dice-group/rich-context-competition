In this article, I discuss some of the organizational\nchallenges for one specific language change implementation, taking the stance that language change must be treated as any\nother organizational change for it to have an effect. I work with the case of the Danish tax authorities' language project\naimed at producing more readable letters. The empirical data that I work with are two qualitative informant interviews. One\nrecorded at the language project's headquarters where they lay out the general lines for the project, and the other at the\npayment center where they use the revised letters.\n",

While a change to a more comprehensible lan-\nguage practice seems quite sensible, the organizational chal-\nlenges should not be underestimated.\nJames (2010) argues that the introduction of plain lan-\nguage is an organizational endeavor.\nIn the following, I will discuss language changes as orga-\nnizational changes.\nThe Danish tax authorities (called SKAT from the Danish\n`skat' meaning `tax') are in the middle of a large language\nchange program, which includes a centralization of the lan-\nguage in standard letters as well as occasional letters. Among\nother things, this means that the central language unit (in col-\nlaboration with local offices) is responsible for language\nchange in a substantial number of letters. I interviewed a rep-\nresentative for the central language unit (D. Piil) and two\nrepresentatives for the changed letters (L. Pallesen and D.\nPoulsen). The names used in this article are fictitious.\nAll template-based letters are being changed and occa-\nsional letters exceeding a thousand in numbers have to be\nsent to the language unit (D. Piil, interview, L. Pallesen and\nD. Poulsen, interview). The language project is a kind of\nplain language project, although not referred to as such, nor\naffiliated with any of the plain language organizations.\nHead of the language program states the goal of the proj-\nect to be to save time and money: \"There may be any number\nof reasons to work systematically with language in compa-\nnies. At SKAT we do it because it pays\" (Holdgaard, 2012,\nmy translation).\nIn the following, I will take a look at the SKAT project\nand use the SKAT language project as a case, trying to illus-\ntrate how the language changes in SKAT are reflected in\norganizational changes to support and maintain the language\nchanges.\nLiterature Review\nPlain Language\nTo begin with, let me just say that here I discuss organiza-\ntional change in relation to language change. That means that\nI will not discuss reception. This is done by Krone (2013) in\na sense-making approach to how citizens receive letters, and\nby Bell (2007) who discusses research methodology when\ndealing with the reception of plain language.\nPlain language has to do with clear and effective\ncommunication--nothing more or less. It does, though, signify\na new attitude and a fundamental change from past practices. (p.\nKimble's definition makes plain language sound as if it is\nthe most logical of approaches to communicating with cus-\ntomers and clients, but he also includes a few words on why\nchanging language from hazy and convoluted to clear and\n1Roskilde University, Denmark\nCorresponding Author:\nKarsten Pedersen, Roskilde University, Universitetsvej 1, Bld. 43.3,\nEmail: kape@ruc.dk\nPlain Language and Organizational\nChallenges\nKarsten Pedersen1\n Keywords\norganizational communication, human communication, communication studies, communication, social sciences, interpersonal\ncommunication, business communication\n2 SAGE Open\neffective can be a daunting task, because sometimes people\njust do not accept plain language as a language practice that\nthey can adopt even if it can be shown to work. But even if it\ndoes seem counterintuitive that one would prefer a text that\ndoes not work, over a text that does, we must not disregard\nfactors such as tradition and professional identity when we\ntalk about the use of language in organizations (Becker\nout what it takes for a text to work, we will have to discuss\nthe organizational settings as well as the actual and desired\n(organizational) functions of the text. Also we will have to\nacknowledge the existence of communication culture as a\nreflection of the degree of openness and dialogue to which an\norganization wants to dedicate itself. In such an understand-\ning, organizations that seek secrecy over openness will have\nand maintain a culture of secrecy, and organizations that seek\nopenness over secrecy will have and maintain a culture of\nopenness. Therefore, an organization that adopts a plain lan-\nguage approach must realize that it entails openness and\ndialogue.\nOrganizational Changes\nBolman and Deal (2008) identify four issues that they claim\nare present in all organizational changes or innovation\nprocesses:\nFirst, it affects individuals' ability to feel effective, valued, and\nin control . . . Second, change disrupts existing patterns of roles\nand relationships . . . Third, change creates conflict between\nwinners and losers--those who benefit from the new direction\nand those who do not . . . Finally, change creates loss of meaning\nfor recipients of the change. (p. 396)\nSo change, in the eyes of Bolman and Deal (2008), means\nthat an organization loses some of the stability that it used to\nhave and that means that any change process must have\nsomething to offer the employees to make up for the loss. In\nthe case of language change, it means that old ways of\naddressing the public are no longer valid, that a more direct\nor perhaps inviting way of writing will change the role of the\nSKAT employees from that of the keen controller to that of\nthe friendly advisor. As we shall see later, there will also be\npeople who find the new ways wrong and hard to live with.\nThey will be the losers. Those who find the new ways inter-\nesting and challenging will be the winners. And all of the\nabove adds to a loss of meaning that was attached to the tra-\nditional way of writing.\nSome of central problems in organizational change pro-\ncesses are addressed by Bolman and Deal (2008) in their\nreinterpretation of Kotter's (1995) change stages. Bolman\nand Deal emphasize a number of elements in change pro-\ncesses and list Kotter's change states adding their own four\nframes (see Table 1).\nKotter's change states (on the far left of the schematic) are\nan attempt to find and isolate the crucial elements in\norganizational change processes. The model is a top-down\nmodel, and therefore it applies very well to my case in which\nthe management has decided to implement language changes\nand to have them distributed to the entire organization. The\neight change states are not an exhaustive list, but should be\nregarded as the eight most important aspects of organiza-\nBolman and Deal's (2008) four frames represent an iden-\ntification of four perspectives on organizational change. The\nperspectives can be seen as separate in the way that each of\nthe four perspectives can be the main focus point in change.\nAt the same time, the four frames must be seen as comple-\nments to each other:\nMultiframe thinking is challenging and often counterintuitive.\nTo see the same organization as machine, family, jungle and\ntheatre requires the capacity to think in different ways at the\nsame time . . . Success requires artistry, skill, and the ability to\nsee organizations as organic forms in which needs, roles, power,\nand symbols must be integrated to provide direction and shape\nBolman and Deal's (2008) four frames, it could be said,\nlend Kotter's eight stages more detail and make it possible to\nsystematically talk about quite different initiatives applicable\nat each stage.\nThey say,\nKotter's stages depict a dynamic process moving through time,\nthough not necessarily in a linear sequence. In the real world,\nstages overlap, and change agents sometimes need to cycle back\nThis counters, according to Appelbaum, Habashy, Malo,\nand Shafiq (2012), Kotter's own idea of the stages'\nimplementation:\nKotter argues that the eight steps should be followed in sequence\nand that extended overlapping of the steps will compromise\nsuccess, implying that steps are requisite of one another.\nTherefore, not implementing the first step will make it difficult\nor impossible to implement the subsequent steps. Burnes (1996)\nargues that such a prescriptive approach does not correlate well\nwith studies that suggest that organizations prefer to use\napproaches to change that stems from their culture and thus\ncannot easily be amended or replaced (Cummings and Huse,\nTable 1 is made with organizational change in mind.\nTherefore, it might be fruitful to compare it with James'\n(2010) list of success factors in dealing with a transition to\nplain language.\n1995), takes organizational matters into account and identi-\nfies six \"critical success factors\" for implementing plain\nlanguage in an organization. Below, I list James' six factors\ntogether with the corresponding terminology according to\nKotter's stage of change Structural frame Human resource frame Political frame Symbolic frame\n1.

Reform of templates and procedures\nKotter: Remove obstacles and empower people to move\nforward\nBolman and Deal: New culture to support new ways\nAs we can see, only Success Factor 6 (Reform of tem-\nplates and procedures) specifically has to do with language.\nThe five previous success factors are organizational\nactivities.\nIn terms of plain language, it should be noted that where\nJames (2010) talks about evaluating the plain language\neffort, this is not the focus for Kotter and Bolman and Deal.\nThey are interested in anchoring change in the organization\nand therefore are not necessarily interested in external fac-\ntors such as readability but more so in internal ones such as\nacceptance of the changes. The challenge for the proponents\nof plain language, then, is to unite these two different\napproaches and make external success a criterion for internal\nditto.\nPlain Language and the Organization\nSeeing plain language as just a skills problem for junior staff is\nbound to fail. It is equally about changing the underlying culture\nthat staff have about the way they communicate and how that\ncommunication represents them. It is also about changing the\nunderlying systems and processes that determine how they will\ncommunicate. (p. 18)\nFor us to understand the scope of the changes involved in\nlanguage change, it is fruitful to view it as organizational\nchange. So what I discuss here are the prerequisites for a\nchange in an organization's approach toward writing prac-\ntices, not whether or not these practices support plain lan-\nguage. Because this is not a question of whether or not plain\nlanguage is recommendable, but a question of how organiza-\ntional change is implemented.\nAs we shall see below, making people accept organiza-\ntional change seems very dependent on communication that\nwill make change acceptable and relevant to the employees\naffected by the changes. This is why the actual change is as\nimportant as the management's ability to show that new\npractices are preferable to the old ones.\nMethod\nMy empirical data come from informant interviews. The\ninterviews were designed to provide me with new knowl-\nedge about the change process and therefore I chose to inter-\nview a representative for the language center as well as\nrepresentatives for the daily users of the letters:\nAn important use of informant interviews concerns the\nexploration of a less well-understood topic of interest. Informants\nare selected on the basis of their knowledge, experience, or\nunderstanding of a given topical area (Johnson, 1990). In such\ncases, the interviewer takes on the role of student and directs the\ninterview in such a way as to learn from the informant, who is an\nI performed two interviews. One with D. Piil, spokesper-\nson for the language project, and the other with two employ-\nees at the payment center, L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen. The\ninterviews were semi-structured and both lasted slightly\nmore than an hour. To secure the informants' reliability, I\nrephrased some of my questions to give the informants an\nopportunity to change their minds. Also I asked for elabora-\ntions and for the informants to explain some of their answers.\nTo make sure that the interviews were valid, I explained my\npurpose for the informants to give them an impression of the\ncontext in which I would use the interviews.\nResults\nThe schematic that I introduced and commented on above is\nmade with organizational change in mind. Therefore, I found\nit fruitful to compare it with James' (2010) list of success\nfactors in dealing with a transition to plain language. Below,\nI will show how the Danish SKAT project deals with these\nfactors.\nPedersen 5\n1. Example of other agencies\na. Sense of urgency, compelling story\nThere are two elements at stake here. First (the creation\nof), a necessity for change; if people can see that other\nagencies, other organizations, have changed and gained\nfrom the change, there is a better chance that they will see\na planned change in their own organization as something\npositive. Second, change might not seem as too daunting a\ntask if other organizations have already made similar\nchanges.\nIt is not clear from my interview with SKAT (D. Piil,\ninterview) whether or not they tried to create this sense of\nurgency. The informants in the payment center, however,\nstate that they found some of the letters used before the lan-\nguage project started, were \"embarrassingly hard to under-\nstand\" (L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen, interview). That means\nthat there has been the feeling that it was necessary to do\nsomething about the letters. This feeling did not come from\noutside examples. When I ask L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen if\nthey have been presented with examples of other parts of\ngovernment making similar changes, they say that that has\nnot been the case.\nSense of urgency regarding language practice could take\nas its point of departure that if the organization is supposed\nto communicate adequately with its costumers, clients, or\npartners, a change to different language practices is neces-\nsary. Reference to similar organizations that have gone\nthrough the same kind of changes could serve as inspiration\nfor skeptics. SKAT does not seem to have used reference to\nother government agencies with similar projects (L. Pallesen\nand D. Poulsen, interview) as a way of creating a feeling of\nurgency. In fact, L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen said that as\nSKAT is such a large organization, there is no comparison\n(L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen, interview).\n2. Training\na. Provide training, resources, and support, run team-\nbuilding exercises for guiding team\nTraining is central to change, for it creates the framework for\nunderstanding why change is necessary and what the out-\ncome of the change is supposed to be. Team-building can be\nan important part of the training, because not only might it\nsupport the general training efforts, it might also give col-\nleagues an opportunity to align their views on the changes. In\nchanges that involve language practices, training is abso-\nlutely imperative for the organization to be able to get rid of\nwhat could be perceived as well-proven practices.\nIn my case, SKAT has done exactly what 2 (Training)\nPrescribes. The central language unit trains and builds teams,\nso that language workers are dispersed all over the organiza-\ntion (D. Piil, interview).\nThis is confirmed by L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen (inter-\nview) who state that there have been local as well as central\ncourses and that the courses have focused upon the letters,\nrather than on general writing principles. They emphasize\nthat they find the local anchoring a central part of the\ntraining.\nSo training is important, but so is prior education. As\nnoted by Lund (2004), education is a key element in letter\nwriting, as any letter writing employee in an organization\ndraws on his or her general and/or specialized education to\ndo their job. Drawing on education also means drawing on\nany writing norms and traditions implanted therein. But\none's original educational background might also be a con-\nservative factor counterbalancing the changes aimed at. And\nthat is why Bolman and Deal's schematic emphasizes the\ntraining aspect of organizational change. If an organization\ncan further educate its employees, they will have the possi-\nbility of drawing on new organization-specific knowledge,\nrather than profession-specific norms. And therefore a\nchange in language or writing norms is essential, if an orga-\nnization does not want several profession-based writing\nnorms to exist throughout the organization. Writing norms\nmay come from a strong writing tradition, such as legal writ-\norganization. If an organization wants its employees to fol-\nlow a specific writing norm, such as plain language, it will\nhave to change any already existing writing norms that are in\nconflict with its own goals. L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen are\nalso aware of this aspect. They tell me how some of their col-\nleagues still use what they call \"drawer letters\". These are\nletters that the colleagues in question use instead of the new\nletters, because the \"drawer letters\" conform to tradition\nrather than the new principles. The reason they give for this\nbehavior is that the colleagues have been with SKAT for\nquite a number of years and they even say that \"it is easier for\nus, because we come from the private sector\" (L. Pallesen\nand D. Poulsen, interview).\n3. Evaluation\na. Plan for short-term victories, invest resources and\npower to ensure early wins, celebrate and communi-\ncate early signs of progress\nThere are several reasons why one would want to evaluate\norganizational changes. The most important one is that it\nenables you to monitor the development in the change pro-\ncesses, so that you might change approach if necessary. Also,\npositive evaluations (early wins) might add to the elements\nmentioned under 1 (Example of other agencies) above,\nthereby giving the process more stamina, as now the positive\nstories are coming from within the organization itself.\nAlso in terms of evaluation, SKAT has done some of the\nthings that are suggested in 3 (Evaluation) above. What they\ndid not do was plan for early successes, but instead they were\n6 SAGE Open\nquite swift to change strategies if there was a reason to do so\n(D. Piil, interview).\nSo evaluation is not only a tool to find out if what you are\ndoing actually works, it is also a way of convincing employ-\nees of the value of the change. The experience from SKAT is\nthat one has to be very careful when preparing evaluations,\nbecause one of the experiences was that one specific letter\nhad prompted the receivers to phone the tax office sending\nthe letter. This did not happen with the corresponding old\nletter and SKAT's assessment of the reason for this is that the\nreformulated letter was much more inviting than the old one\n(D. Piil, interview). L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen do not recog-\nnize the experience that D. Piil talks about when I confront\nthem with what D. Piil said. They do, however, say that there\nwas quite some editing going on with the first letter changes\nand that some of the changes did come about as a result of\nreactions from the receivers of the letters (L. Pallesen and D.\nPoulsen, interview). But they are not, as is D. Piil, able to\npoint to one specific letter and say that it was changed as a\nresult of more phone calls than they were aiming at. What\nthis means is that the episode with the letter referred to by D.\nPiil seems to have been less significant to L. Pallesen and D.\nPoulsen.\nAlso, according to L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen, there are\ngenerally fewer phone calls now than before the changes in\nthe letters began. There are, however, no data to substantiate\nthe claim.\nSeen from a plain language perspective, this is a good\nthing, but if the promise in the organization has been that the\nuse of plain language would diminish the time used on the\nphone, because receivers now understand the letters, this\nincrease in the number of phone calls could be counterpro-\nductive in the change process.\n4. Internal champions\na. Create a \"culture\" team, broad involvement in devel-\noping culture, put commanding officer on team, in-\nvolve people throughout organization, solicit input,\nstack team with credible, influential members\nInternal champions are what communication theorists would\ncall opinion leaders; people who are important in an organi-\nzations' construction of reality and interpretation of results.\nThese are the people who will make sure that results are\ncommunicated throughout the organization, and by making\nthem part of the process chances are they will communicate\na positive take on the changes.\nSKAT identified a number of language project ambassa-\ndors, so that they have a contact within the various depart-\nments, and that the departments themselves have a contact\nwith the project. The contacts in the departments are \"some-\nbody interested\" within the various parts of the organization.\nThere are various functions of the local contacts. Two very\nimportant ones are to make the local colleagues part of the\nprocess and to give the central task force knowledge about\nrules, regulations, and so on,. that are special to the various\ndepartments (D. Piil, interview). In the payment center, the\napproach to this has been exactly as D. Piil outlined with\nlocal steering committees responsible for the development in\nthe different offices in the payment center (L. Pallesen and\nD. Poulsen, interview).\nL. Pallesen and D. Poulsen point out that the local com-\nmittees have been in contact with various central offices to\nmake sure that the new letters meet communicational as well\nas legal (central) standards.\n5. Executive support\na. Put commanding officer on team, stack team with\ncredible, influential members\nThis is where the difference between on one side James and\non the other Kotter/Bolman and Deal becomes most clear.\nWhere the latter seems to take for granted that organizational\nchange is initiated at executive level, the former finds it rel-\nevant to stress the point, to emphasize that changes of some-\nthing as basic as an organization's use of language must be\ntaken seriously, also by its executives.\nThe SKAT language project was initiated by management\nand backed by management. Also management members\nhave traveled with the language task force to show that they\ndo back the project. New rules such as mailings with more\nthan a thousand receivers must be approved by the language\ntask force have shown that management backs the project\n(D. Piil, interview).\nLocally, the involvement of commanding officers varies.\nIn D. Poulsen's office, the head of the office was also the\nlocal head of the language project, whereas in L. Pallesen's\noffice the head of the office was merely \"supportive\" of the\nchanges (also the latter office holds significantly more\nemployees than the former). It was in L. Pallesen's office that\nsome of the colleagues used \"drawer letters.\"\n6. Reform of templates and procedures\na. Align structure to new culture, remove or alter struc-\ntures and procedures that support the old ways\nThe structures must support the new ideas, and a way of\nsecuring that, for example, letters are written according to\nnew principles is to update the stock letters and letter tem-\nplates, so that everybody has no choice but to use the new\nformulations.\nI already mentioned SKAT's implementation of new rules\nfor sending out mass letters, but the most profound language\nchange was accomplished by simply replacing old letter tem-\nplates in various computer systems with new ones (D. Piil,\ninterview). This ensures that the letters sent to the public are\nthe letters that management wants to send out. It does not,\nPedersen 7\nhowever, ensure that the senders of the letters feel comfort-\nable with the reformulated letters. That, however, can be\ndealt with by a targeted approach to change organizational\ncommunication practices. And communication practices are\nthat mix of organizational, educational, and traditional\napproaches to communication that must be addressed in any\nstrategic language change in an organization.\nIn my interview with L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen, we saw\nthat some of the older colleagues still used some old letters,\nthe so-called \"drawer letters.\" L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen\noffer the explanations that this is possible in the office in\nquestion (a) because of the nature of the letters and the fact\nthat it is possible to bypass the computer system in which the\nletters are supposed to be conceived, and (b) because the col-\nleagues responsible for bypassing the system are uncomfort-\nable with the new letters. In D. Poulsen's office, this would\nnot be possible at all, because all the letters they send out\nmust be accessed via a computer system, so even if they\nwanted to use the old letters, that would not be possible.\nOrganizational and educational changes are addressed in\nBolman and Deal's schematic. But tradition and profession-\nbased norms will be altered as a combination of organiza-\ntional change and time. That means that, given enough time\nand effort, an organizational (or a communication practice)\nchange can become a lasting change in the attitude toward\norganizational communication. This is emphasized by the\nsuccess factors identified by James (2010).\nDiscussion\nThe above findings suggest that if plain language practices\nare supposed to catch on in an organization, education, eval-\nuation, local anchoring, management involvement, among\nother initiatives, are crucial. That means that even if plain\nlanguage reforms are the goal, they do not have to be in\nfocus, organizational change does. The interviews seem to\nsuggest that plain language can actually be accepted and seen\nas a relevant and desirable development by most staff as a\nresult of it being seen as organizational change.\nFrom my interviews, it is clear that what happened in\nSKAT was not a point-by-point implementation of Kotter's\nchange state, but rather a recursive process in which the local\nemployees were quite instrumental. When asked if they were\nlistened to and felt that they had a genuine influence on the\nletters, L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen both said that they defi-\nnitely found that to be the case. But deeming from the exis-\ntence of the \"drawer letters,\" it is also clear that had I had the\npossibility to talk to other colleagues at the payment center, I\ncould have heard quite a different take on the project.\nThe SKAT language project seems to indicate that Bolman\nand Deal's interpretation of Kotter's stages as recursive\nrather than sequential is the more fruitful approach; as it lets\nthe changes find local as well as central ownership in the\norganization.\nFurthermore, the data seem to indicate that there has been\nan organizational anchoring of the project, and that, even if\nthere is the odd \"drawer letter,\" the payment center staff\naccept the language changes and adopt the language project.\nIt is quite clear from the interview with D. Piil that even if\nit can be shown that the language project seems to fit nicely\nwith Bolman and Deal's interpretation of Kotter, they did not\nimplement the changes by following a model.\n\"plain language has to do with clear and effective communi-\nthat there is more to language change than language change.\nAnd that the introduction of such measures as plain language\nis also very much an organizational project. James' claim\ncertainly seems to be confirmed in the case of SKAT in the\nsense that many of the initiatives taken by the project group\nare language change initiatives backed by organizational ini-\ntiatives. The corollary for other plain language projects could\nvery well be to focus much more on organizational changes\nthan on arguments for the logical reasoning behind the\nchanges.\nBeyond the scope of this organizational investigation lie\ninvestigations to unveil whether or not the organizational\nendeavors to convince employees and colleagues of the use-\nfulness of plain language or plain language like projects can\nbe shown to be fruitful in the contact between government\norganizations and citizens.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAppelbaum, S.
