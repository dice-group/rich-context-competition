    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Serum cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, is frequently used in research as a biomarker of recent\ntobacco smoke exposure. Historically, secondhand smoke (SHS) research uses suboptimal statistical methods due to\ncensored serum cotinine values, meaning a measurement below the limit of detection (LOD).\nMethods: We compared commonly used methods for analyzing censored serum cotinine data using parametric\nand non-parametric techniques employing data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys (NHANES). To illustrate the differences in associations obtained by various analytic methods, we compared\nparameter estimates for the association between cotinine and the inflammatory marker homocysteine using\ncomplete case analysis, single and multiple imputation, \"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier, and logistic regression models.\nResults: Parameter estimates and statistical significance varied according to the statistical method used with\ncensored serum cotinine values. Single imputation of censored values with either 0, LOD or LOD/2 yielded similar\nestimates and significance; multiple imputation method yielded smaller estimates than the other methods and\nwithout statistical significance. Multiple regression modelling using the \"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier method yielded\nstatistically significant estimates that were larger than those from parametric methods.\nConclusions: Analyses of serum cotinine data with values below the LOD require special attention. \"Reverse\"\nKaplan-Meier was the only method inherently able to deal with censored data with multiple LODs, and may be the\nmost accurate since it avoids data manipulation needed for use with other commonly used statistical methods.\nAdditional research is needed into the identification of optimal statistical methods for analysis of SHS biomarkers\nsubject to a LOD.\nBackground\nA biomarker is a laboratory measure of a biological pro-\ncess [1]. The lowest quantity of a biomarker that can\nbe distinguished from the lack of that biomarker is the\nbiomarker's limit of detection (LOD), below which the\nlevel of biomarker cannot be accurately measured. One\nimportant yet unresolved issue in analyzing biomarker\ndata arises when biomarker measurements fall below the\nLOD (i.e. \"non-detects\", \"left-censored\").\nStatistical analyses of data that include biomarker\nmeasurements below the LOD are complicated since\nprecise quantitative levels cannot always be determined\n[1]. In all analyses involving biomarkers with a LOD,\nresearchers working with biomarker data inevitably have\nto deal with data containing non-detects, and must\ndecide how to combine non-detects with values above\nthe LOD for analysis. The choice of an appropriate\nstrategy for dealing with data affected by LODs requires\nan understanding of both experimental and statistical\nprocedures. Until now, the common practice has been\nto impute (i.e. substitute a single value, such as a half of\nthe detection limit, for each measurement below the\nLOD), and to then conduct the analysis under the\nassumption that the imputed values are the actual\nobserved values [2-4]. This assumption may be invalid,\nleading to biased results, especially when trying to pre-\ndict small exposure-health outcome associations [5,6].\n* Correspondence: tsengul@med.miami.edu\n Contributed equally\n1Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at Leonard Miller School of\nMedicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nhttp://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.com/content/9/1/11\n\u00a9 2011 Koru-Sengul et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The use of traditional statistical meth-\nods to analyze serum cotinine measurements often\nintroduces bias into the study results due to measure-\nments falling below the LOD, potentially affecting the\naccuracy of analytic results and validity of study conclu-\nsions [1-4]. Furthermore, this bias may be greatest in\nstudies investigating the health effects of tobacco smoke\nexposures at very low exposure levels, a situation where\nthe subjects' cotinine levels are more likely to be unde-\ntectable. Therefore, the impact of low-level SHS expo-\nsure on human disease may be underestimated using\ntraditional statistical methods for handling biomarkers\nbelow the LOD [1,2].\nThe purpose of our research was to demonstrate and\ncompare the performances of commonly used statistical\nmethods as a case study for analyzing associations\nbetween serum cotinine measurements with non-detects\nand levels of the inflammatory marker homocysteine\nNutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) [7].\nMethods\nThis project's data consisted of adults 18 and older par-\nstudy designed to assess the health and nutritional sta-\ntus of adults and children annually in the United States\nbines interviews and physical examinations; the resulting\ndata can be pooled across multiple years. Anonymous\nsurvey data and related documents were obtained from\nthe NHANES website http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.\nhtm.\nSubjects included in this analysis were non-smoking\nadults age 20 years and older as defined by a serum\ncotinine level less than or equal to 3.08 ng/mL or by\nself report of not smoking within the past 5 days. This\nparticular cotinine threshold for adults has reportedly a\nentiating smokers from non-smokers [8]. The subjects\nincluded in this analysis had detectable or undetectable\nserum cotinine levels and complete information on\nadditional variables of interest (i.e. homocysteine, age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, and SHS exposure) in order to\nfocus on the issue of properly handling left-censored\nIn the NHANES surveys, serum cotinine was assessed\nusing an isotope dilution high performance liquid chro-\nmatography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization\ntandem mass spectrometric method [9]. The laboratory\ntest detection limit for serum cotinine in NHANES was\nImprovements in the laboratory testing methods\nreduced the LOD to 0.015 ng/mL; this lower detection\ncysteine was analyzed using an automated fluorescence\npolarization immunoassay [9].\nWe compared commonly used statistical methods\n(Table 1) as a case study for analyzing serum cotinine\nwith measurement values below the LOD using para-\nmetric and non-parametric techniques: complete case\nanalysis, single and multiple imputation methods,\n\"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier method, and logistic regression\nmodels [2].\nMethods of Handling Left-Censored Data\nComplete-case analysis is a method of analysis that\nincorporates only subjects with serum cotinine values\nabove the LOD. This is a widely used method due to its\nsimplicity, but is highly inefficient since it reduces sam-\nple size and produces bias and loss of precision in the\nImputation is the practice of replacing undetectable\nserum cotinine with \"plausible\" values [11]. After impu-\ntation, data can be analyzed as if imputed values were\nactual observed values. In single imputation, each non-\ndetect value is replaced with an estimate, but this does\nnot account for the sampling variability produced by\nimputed values. Single imputation generally results in\nthe underestimation of variance, which directly affects\nconfidence intervals and statistical tests. In our analysis,\nwe performed single imputation analyses substituting\none of three different commonly used substitution\nvalues for non-detect cotinine measurements: 0, LOD,\nand LOD/2. Depending on the LOD of the cotinine\nmeasurement method, single imputation values changed\nwhen the LOD changed across survey cycles (i.e. 0.05 ng/\nMultiple imputation is a simulation-based approach\nwhich can provide a good solution to missing data pro-\nblems; and it has been used extensively with complex\nnational surveys [12-16]. The basic idea of multiple\nimputation is to replace each non-detect with a vector\nof more than two plausible values from the predictive\ndata distribution [13-15]. In general, multiple imputation\nresults in unbiased estimates, uses all available data, pre-\nserves both sample size and statistical power, and\nhttp://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.com/content/9/1/11\nreflects the sampling variability. After imputation, any\nstatistical software designed for analyzing complete data\ncan be used.\nIn our multiple imputation method, we considered\nnon-detect cotinine measurements as missing values\nbased on an imputation model derived from multivariate\nnormal distribution used to construct the predictive dis-\ntribution for non-detected serum cotinine that included:\nhomocysteine, serum cotinine, age, gender (female/male),\nrace/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White/Other), and self-\nreported SHS exposure (yes/no). The number of imputa-\ntions was set to 10 (i.e. 10 complete datasets including\nboth the detected and imputed non-detected serum coti-\nnine measurements in addition to other variables of inter-\nest such as homocysteine, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and\nself-reported SHS exposure). Ten completed datasets are\nusually sufficient for multiple imputation [14].\nTwo different multiple imputation models were used\nfor creating the imputed serum cotinine with LOD.\nThey were both based on a multivariate normal distribu-\ntion which takes into account the correlation between\nthe variables included in the imputation model. The\nfirst model included only homocysteine and serum coti-\nnine; the second imputation model not only included\nhomocysteine and serum cotinine, but also included age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, and self-reported SHS exposure\nto take into account the strength of the relationship\namong all other variables. The imputation model pre-\ndicted distribution for non-detected serum cotinine\nfrom the subjects' homocysteine, age, gender (female/\nmale), race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White/Other), and\nself-reported SHS exposure (yes/no).\nThe \"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier method is a non-parametric\nmethod that does not require a probabilistic distribution\nto estimate the survival function from time-to-event\ntype of biological data [17]. It is frequently used with\nright-censored survival data. For left-censored data,\nan equivalent estimator can be obtained by Turnbull esti-\nmator, which is equivalent to the \"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier\nestimator. We performed the \"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier\nmethod by considering left-censored serum cotinine as a\n\"time-to-event\" outcome.\nLogistic regression is a modelling technique for\ndichotomous outcomes [18]. We fitted a logistic regres-\nsion model using dichotomized serum cotinine (below\nvs. above LOD) as the outcome variable, and the contin-\nuous homocysteine values as a predictor variable.\nIn all of the methods, the univariate regression models\nfor serum cotinine included only continuous homocys-\nteine values as a predictor. The multiple regression\nmodels not only included continuous homocysteine\nvalues, but also age, gender (female/male), race/ethnicity\n(Non-Hispanic White/Other), and self-reported SHS\nexposure (yes/no).\nStatistical analysis\nTo illustrate the differences in the estimates obtained\namong different analytical methods for handling LOD,\nstudy variables were regressed on the inflammatory mar-\nker homocysteine. The NHANES survey weights were\nnot incorporated in any of these analyses to show the\ndifferences between the methods as a case study under a\nrandom sampling schema. In this case study, the pri-\nmary objective was to compare the parameter estimates\nfrom univariate and multiple regression models that\nquantify the relationship between inflammatory marker\nhomocysteine and serum cotinine subject to LOD. The\nunivariate regression models for inflammatory marker\nhomocysteine included only serum cotinine as a predic-\ntor variable; the multiple regression models included\nadditional variables (as described above). The regression\ncoefficient estimate of serum cotinine, its standard error,\nand the ratio of the regression coefficient to its standard\nerror as well as the statistical significance were reported\nand compared among all the methods. All of the ana-\nlyses were implemented using SAS version 9.2 for\nWindows statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,\nNC, USA). Statistical significance was attained with\nResults\nTable 1 summarizes and compares the characteristics of\nthe different methods considered for analyses of left-\ncensored serum cotinine data.

The methods differed on how censored\nvalues were treated in the analyses. The complete case\nanalysis method was not suitable since it simply\nexcluded all of the censored cotinine values from the\nanalysis. Logistic regression models were also not suita-\nble methods since it collapsed cotinine values into\na dichotomous categorical variable (detectable vs.\nundetectable).\nMethods that replaced censored measurements with\nimputed values were the single and multiple imputation\nmethods. This happens for both single and multiple\nimputation when either: 1) a non-detect is substituted\nwith an imputed value; or 2) when more than one LOD\nexists and all values below the highest LOD are treated\nas non-detects. The methods inherently able to deal\nwith multiple LOD were the multiple imputation,\n\"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier method, and logistic regression.\nBased on the three criteria listed in table 1, the \"reverse\"\nKaplan-Meier method was the most efficient method\nbecause it did not require transformation of data to a\ncategorical variable, did not replace censored data with\nan imputed value, and was able to handle data with\nmultiple LODs.\nParameter estimates and statistical significance for\nserum cotinine varied according to different methods\n(Table 2). All the methods found positive associations\nbetween serum cotinine and homocysteine in both uni-\nvariate and multiple regression models. In all methods\nof analyses, univariate regression estimates (range: 0.001\n\u00ad 0.524) were smaller than multiple regression estimates\nreported the smallest estimates in both the univariate\nand multiple regression models, while the logistic\nregression models resulted in the largest regression esti-\nmates. The only method that did not reveal statistically\nsignificant associations between serum cotinine mea-\nsurements and levels of homocysteine was multiple\nimputation.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this analysis suggest that different statisti-\ncal methods for handling LODs can result in variable\nparameter estimates with resulting p-values both above\nand below the level of 5% when investigating the asso-\nciations between serum cotinine and the inflammatory\nmarker homocysteine. While all methods revealed posi-\ntive associations between serum cotinine and homocys-\nteine, the multiple imputation method did not yield\nsignificant parameter estimates. The complete case\nanalysis, single imputation, \"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier, and\nlogistic regression demonstrated statistically significant\npositive associations between cotinine and homocysteine\nlevels.\nSignificant variation between methods was seen in the\nsize of the estimates using both univariate and multiple\nregression models; a 524 and 55 fold difference was\nseen in the size of estimates between the multiple impu-\ntation and logistic regression using univariate and multi-\nple regression models, respectively. The smallest ratio\n(estimate/SE) was observed with multiple imputation,\nwhile the largest in the logistic regression model. Single\nimputation using different values for substitution also\nresulted in slight variation in the size of both univariate\nand multiple regression models; regression estimates\nTable 2 Association between Homocysteine and Serum Cotinine in Non-Smokers: Results by Different Analytical\nMethods for Analyzing Left-Censored Biomarker Data\n#subjects included Univariate* Multiple*\nMethod Estimate (SE) Estimate/SE p-value Estimate (SE) Estimate/SE p-value\nSingle Imputation with\nLOD: limit of detection; sqrt: squared root\nEstimate (SE): regression coefficient and its standard error between Serum Cotinine and Homocysteine\n*Univariate regression models for inflammatory marker Homocysteine include serum cotinine only as a covariate; Type-I error rate = 5%.\n**Multiple regression models for inflammatory marker Homocysteine include serum cotinine, age in years, gender (female/male), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nWhite/Others), and second hand smoking status (yes/no) as covariates; Type-I error rate = 5%.\n*** Outcome of these methods is left-censored serum cotinine.\nhttp://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.com/content/9/1/11\nfor univariate and multiple regression models, respec-\ntively, as the imputation value was changed from the\nSince the true regression coefficient parameter is not\nknown, we do not know for sure which result is the\nmost accurate. Multiple imputation, although believed\nto be appropriate for complex sample survey data and\nendorsed in the past for use with NHANES data, is sub-\nject to many of the same limitations as complete case\nand single imputation analysis due to the replacement\nof censored values with values that were not measured\ndirectly [19]. While the creation of binary (below vs.\nabove LOD) or ordinal (below LOD, above LOD as low,\nmedium, high) categorical data from censored data does\nnot violate any assumptions of logistic regression, such\nstatistical methods have much less power compared to\n\"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier due to aggregating biomarker\nmeasurements into subgroups. Additionally, the group-\ning and subsequent loss of statistical power with the\ncreation of categorical/ordinal cotinine variables may\nnot be able to detect small associations, such as with\nthe health effects of very low levels of SHS exposure.\nThe \"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier method, however, appears\nto be both the most efficient and the most accurate\nmethod for this analysis since it is inherently able to\nhandle censored data with multiple LODs, and it avoids\nthe need for data manipulation (needed with imputation\nmethods or logistic regression).\nConclusions\nResearchers who use tobacco smoke exposure bio-\nmarkers, such as serum cotinine, should be aware that\ncommonly used analytic techniques for handling left-\ncensored data may bias study results by using suboptimal\nstatistical methods, especially in studies investigating the\nhealth effects of SHS exposure due to typically small\neffect sizes. Analysis of left-censored data requires special\nattention, as different methods may yield different results\nas shown in our case study. Many commonly used statis-\ntical methods do not properly handle left-censored serum\ncotinine data because these methods either exclude sub-\njects with undetectable cotinine levels or impute values\nthat are treated as actual observed values. Our analysis\nsuggests \"reverse\" Kaplan-Meier is the preferred method\nof analysis of serum cotinine with censored data and with\nmultiple LODs until more in depth research on optimal\nmethods of analysis for left-censored data finds its place\nin the scientific literature.\nStatistical simulation studies are needed to compare\nthe results and to generalize the conclusions to other\nsurveys, as well as to other left-censored biomarker\ndata. In statistical simulation studies, one can compare\nthe estimates obtained from different methods with the\ntrue estimates to understand bias and error introduced\nby varying the different scenarios (such as the percen-\ntage of LOD, the magnitude of the correlation between\nthe left-censored biomarker, and the other variables of\ninterest).\nConsidering the frequent use of SHS biomarkers in\npublic health research and their impact on public health\npolicy, research is needed into the most appropriate sta-\ntistical methods for use with SHS biomarkers, and well-\ndefined guidelines need to be developed for analyzing\nSHS biomarkers data.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute\n(FAMRI) Clinical Innovator Awards to Dr. Koru-Sengul and Dr. Lee, the\nand the European Union Convergence funding (ECEHH, PCMD, University of\nExeter).
