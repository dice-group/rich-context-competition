Easterlin, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, and approved November 12, 2010 (received for review June 10, 2010)\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that\ntemperatures in the major grain-growing areas of North America\nwill rise by 3\u00ad4 \u00b0C by 2100. Such abrupt changes will create major\nchallenges, significantly altering the area suitable for wheat. The\nhistorical record offers insight into the capability of agriculture to\nadapt to climatic challenges. Using a new county-level dataset on\nwheat production and climate norms, we show that during the\n19th and 20th centuries North American grain farmers pushed\nwheat production into environments once considered too arid,\ntoo variable, and too harsh to cultivate. As summary measures,\nthe median annual precipitation norm of the 2007 distribution of\nNorth American wheat production was one-half that of the 1839\ndistribution, and the median annual temperature norm was 3.7 \u00b0C\nlower. This shift, which occurred mostly before 1929, required new\nbiological technologies. The Green Revolution associated with the\npioneering work of Norman Borlaug represented an important\nadvance in this longer process of biological innovation. However,\nwell before the Green Revolution, generations of North American\nfarmers overcame significant climatic challenges.\nadaptation | agricultural technology | food security\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\nprojects that by 2100 annual mean temperatures in North\nAmerica will increase by 2 to 3 \u00b0C at midlatitude coastal regions\nand by \"up to more than\" 5 \u00b0C at more northern latitudes. In the\nmain grain-growing areas, the IPCC forecasts temperatures will\nrise 3 to 4 \u00b0C (1). A more recent MIT study suggests far greater\nchanges will occur (2). There are a wide range of estimates of\nhow climate changes will impact agricultural production (3\u00ad7).\nNumerous researchers have speculated about how farmers might\nchange cultivars, cropping patterns, and farming methods to\nmitigate some of the costs of abrupt climatic changes (8). Re-\nsearchers at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement\nCenter (CIMMYT) anticipate that North American wheat farmers\nmay extend the margin of wheat production roughly 1,000 km north\ninto northern Canada and Alaska, whereas heat and drought will\nmake cultivation untenable in many areas of the southern Great\nPlains (9). To provide perspective on these and other predictions,\nthis paper asks how farmers responded to past climatic challenges.\nThe spread of wheat cultivation across North America required\nthat farmers repeatedly adapt to unfamiliar and hostile climatic\nconditions. The variations in climatic conditions that settlers en-\ncountered rivaled the magnitude of the predicted changes at given\nlocations over the next century. We quantify the extent of the\ngeographic variations and decipher how wheat growers learned to\nproduce in new environments. Because of the paucity of Mexican\ndata before 1929, most of our analysis of \"North America\" refers\nto Canada and the United States. Inclusion of Mexico in the later\npart of the 20th century highlights the role of the Green Revo-\nlution in pushing production into hotter and drier zones.\nResults\nThe quantification of the geoclimatic conditions of wheat pro-\nchanges to adjust to climate; most of the changes in location and\nthe technological adjustments that made settlement possible oc-\ncurred before the Green Revolution.\nQuantifying Geographic Changes in Production and Climate. Between\ngraphic center (mean) of North American wheat production was\nlocated in eastern Ohio. Cultivation was concentrated in Ohio\nand New York; relatively little wheat was grown as far west as\nwest, into west-central South Dakota (Methods). Almost all this\nmovement occurred when plant sciences were in their infancy.\nThe change in the location entailed large shifts in growing\nconditions. The six panels of Fig. 1 display the main features of\nthe changing geographic distribution of the North American\nwheat crop across latitude; longitude; annual, January, and July\ntemperature norms; and annual precipitation norms.

The median latitude of production (Fig. 1B)\nwas relatively constant until the 1890s, when the northern Plains\nand the Canadian Prairies began to enter cultivation. The me-\ndian latitude of production in 1929 was near the northern fringe\nquarter of production (reflected by the 75% line) moved north\nFig.1C\u00adFquantifiesthechangesinclimaticconditionsassociated\nwith these geographic shifts in production. In 1839 median pro-\ntook place on land with a norm of less than 50 cm of precipitation;\nthis environment was drier than virtually any place growing wheat in\nthe United States or Canada in 1839. Almost all the changes in the\ndistributionofproduction,asmeasuredbyannualprecipitation,had\noccurred by 1929. In that year the marginal fringe (the 10% line)\nwith 35 cm or less of precipitation produced about one-fifth more\nwheat than North America's total output in 1839. The range of\nannual moisture conditions widened substantially, as indicated by\nthe growing spread between the 10% and 90% lines. Data on pre-\ncipitationinJanuaryand July (Figs.

Again, most of the change occurred before\nthe dawn of modern plant sciences. Focusing on annual temper-\nature norms, the coldest 10% of production occurred at 8.4 \u00b0C in\nmore extreme (Fig. 1E). For the coldest 10% of production as\nmeasured by January temperature, the norm in 1839 was -5.1 \u00b0C\nwheat was grown in places where the January temperature norm\naveraged less than -17 \u00b0C than was grown in all of North\nAmerica in 1839, a date when little wheat was produced in areas\nwith a January temperature norm as low as -7 \u00b0C. The colder\nproduction locations also have tended to be drier. The pro-\nduction-weighted correlation coefficient between annual tem-\nmatic conditions, but a positive association between temperature\nand precipitation remained.\nThe changes have not been limited to production moving into\nplaces with colder climates, but the expansion in hot areas has\nbeen swamped in our figures by the much greater geographical\nshift into cold areas. Fig. 1F shows that, although the median\nJuly temperature norm in the wheat-growing area declined, the\nJuly temperature in the area supporting the warmest one-quarter\nof production increased.

However, in 1944,\nwhen Borlaug started his work for the Rockefeller Foundation in\nMexico, there already was a long history of agriculturalists who\nhad successfully improved wheat to meet climatic conditions.\nBiological Innovation to Adapt to Environmental Challenges. Wheat\ncultivation was introduced into Mexico in 1521, but it did not\nappear in the territory that would become Canada and the\nUnited States until 1602 (10). Discovering wheats suitable for\nnew areas was a reoccurring struggle. Farmers in eastern Canada\nand New England continuously experimented to find cold-tol-\nerant and pest-resistant wheats (11). In the more temperate\nMiddle colonies, the cultivars (cultivated varieties) transplanted\nfrom Western Europe fared better. However, the challenges\nwere particularly acute when pioneers moved wheat cultivation\nwestward onto the northern Prairies, Great Plains, and Pacific\nCoast. All these regions eventually became major wheat suppli-\ners, but only after farmers learned to overcome climatic con-\nditions far different from those prevailing to the East and in\nWestern Europe. The initial attempts to grow traditional wheat\ncultivars frequently failed.\nThe experiences of the Selkirk colonists who settled near Lake\nWinnipeg offer an example. The winter wheat, first tried in 1811\u00ad\n1812, failed. Successive crops of spring wheat also succumbed to\ndrought, freezing, and insects. To obtain sufficient seed for the\nkm (round trip) to Prairie du Chien on the upper Mississippi\nRiver during the dead of winter. After about a decade of hungry\ntimes, the colony began to sustain itself (12). The prolonged\ntroubles of the Selkirk colonists represented a clear case of\nsettlers leapfrogging beyond the limits of their climatic knowl-\nedge. However, even when settlers inched west in a more orderly\nfashion, the challenge of adapting was daunting. In the 1840s,\nattempts to grow soft winter wheat on the Wisconsin Prairie\nfailed repeatedly, and wheat culture succeeded only after farm-\ners switched to a new hard spring wheat cultivar (13).\nThe Great Plains were depicted as the \"Great American\nDesert\" and were considered incapable of supporting agricul-\nture. The first waves of settlers from the humid East and Mid-\nwest moved into the High Plains during the relatively wet years\nof the 1880s. These farmers, along with railroad and government\nofficials, significantly miscalculated the climatic obstacles that\nhad to be overcome (14). Success required decades of experi-\nmentation and frequently depended on knowledge and cultivars\nintroduced by immigrants from frigid and arid locales of Eurasia.\nThe spread of wheat cultivation across the Great Plains and\nCanadian Prairies was made possible by mechanization and the\nextension of railroads. A host of mechanical innovations cut in\nhalf the labor required to produce a unit of wheat between 1840\nPrairies served to link farmers to expanding distant markets (15,\n16). However, the expansion of wheat cultivation also depended\non the introduction and breeding of hard red winter and spring\nwheats that were entirely new to North America. During the late\n19th century, the premier hard spring wheat cultivated in North\nAmerica was Red Fife (which probably made its way from Eastern\nEurope to Ontario via Scotland). According to the standard ac-\ncount, David and Jane Fife of Otonabee, ON, selected and in-\ncreased the grain stock from a single wheat plant grown on their\nfarm in 1842. It was not introduced into the United States until\nthe mid-1850s. Red Fife was the first hard spring wheat grown in\nNorth America and became the basis for the spread of wheat into\nWisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Canadian Prairies (13).\nAnother notable breakthrough was the introduction of Turkey\nwheat, which, like Red Fife, allowed production to shift into more\nmarginal environments (SI Text). This hard red winter cultivar\nwas especially well suited to the harsh growing conditions of the\nsouthern wheat belt. The standard histories credit German\nMennonites, who migrated from southern Russia to Kansas, with\nimporting Turkey in 1873. This transfer was far from haphazard,\nbecause local railroads recruited these migrants for their knowl-\nedge of farming in such environments (ref. 16, pp. 88\u00ad89.). Fur-\nthermore, before departing for Kansas, the Mennonites tediously\nselected high-quality seed considered suitable for the new lands.\nEarlier Kansas settlers experimented with soft winter cultivars\ncommon to the eastern states, but these wheats proved unreliable\nin the cold winters and hot, dry summers. Tests at the Kansas\nAgricultural Experiment Station (AES) demonstrated Turkey's\nsuperiority and helped popularize the wheat. In 1919, Turkey-type\nwheat made up more than 80% of the wheat acreage in Nebraska\nand Kansas and nearly 70% of the wheat acreage in Colorado and\nSalmon, a leading US Department of Agriculture (USDA)\nbreeder, concluded that, without Turkey cultivars, \"The wheat\ncrop of Kansas today would be no more than half what it is, and\nthe farmers of Nebraska, Montana and Iowa would have no\nchoice but to grow spring wheat\" (20).\nIn both Canada and the United States many varietal innova-\ntions were the result of government investments. In 1886 Parlia-\nment created the Canadian Federal Experiment Station system.\nIts most acclaimed breeder, William Saunders, commenced\na systematic program of hybridizing high-quality cultivars with\nearly-maturing wheats introduced from around the world. In 1903\nhis son, Charles Saunders, took over the work at the Dominion\nExperimental Farm, near Ottawa. The most valuable result of\ntheir combined research efforts was Marquis, a cross between Red\nFife and Red Calcutta, a very early wheat from India. Released in\n1909, Marquis was an immediate success and accounted for about\nwheat in its network of experiment stations, the USDA released\nfor 17% of United States acreage, and its range stretched from\nWashington State to northern Illinois (19). The rapid spread of\nMarquis was not an isolated case. Around 1900, Mark Alfred\nCarleton, the USDA's most prominent wheat breeder and plant\nexplorer, introduced scores of cultivars from the Russian Empire.\nHe explicitly was seeking cultivars that thrived in harsh environ-\nments. After proving drought and rust resistant in controlled\ntests, several durum introductions diffused rapidly in Minnesota\nTable 1, which lists a number of important new wheat culti-\nvars, hints at the growing importance of public breeding (18, 23,\n24). (The distinction between the public and private sectors is\nnot precise, because breeders in both sectors use germplasm\nfrom the other.) In 1919, 27% of the wheat acreage in the United\nStates was planted in cultivars introduced or bred by the public\nsector, and almost all Canadian wheat was a product of gov-\nPublic breeding activities in the United States increased during\nmuch of the 20th century. In 2008 varietal surveys of United\nStates and Canadian wheat (SI Text) indicate that roughly 84%\nof wheat acreage is planted to cultivars bred by the public sector.\nImprovements in breeding technologies along with environ-\nmental and economic factors have accelerated the rate of turn-\nover of wheat cultivars. The surveys show that the median\nvintage of modern wheats is 12 y. By comparison, the 1919 me-\ndian vintage was about 3 decades. Changes in technologies have\nallowed farmers to adopt seeds tailored to narrower geoclimatic\nsurveys accounted for more than 6% of total United States and\nCanadian wheat acreage. Breeding advances in the United States\nand Mexico accelerated the evolution of wheat germplasm and\nthe plant's adaptability to more varied conditions.\nHome of the Green Revolution. Although wheat appeared early in\nMexico, the crop always was secondary to maize. By the early\n1940s, rust diseases were taking a heavy toll, and national pro-\nduction accounted for less than one-half of consumption. In 1943,\nthe Mexican government together with the Rockefeller Founda-\ntion established a wheat-breeding program, hiring Norman Bor-\nlaug as the chief breeder the following year. His invention of\nshuttle breeding (whereby researchers took seed grown at high\nelevations over the summer to grow at low elevations over the\nwinter and then planted the resulting seed at high elevations the\nfollowing spring, and then repeated the process) allowed Borlaug\nto cut the breeding time in half and develop plants adapted to\na wider range of environmental conditions. Borlaug bred a series\nof early-ripening, fertility-responsive, rust-resistant cultivars, but\nthese were prone to lodging (the bending and breaking of the\nstems). Building on the work of Orville Vogel at the Washington\nState AES, Borlaug began to produce semidwarf lines in 1954\nbased on a cross of Norin 10 (from Japan) and Brevor (from the\nWashington State AES). The resulting plants had strong straw,\nhigh yield potential, and good rust resistance, including pro-\ntection against the new stem rust race, 15b, which was ravaging\nNorth America. A succession of new lines began to diffuse rap-\nidly, increasing production and transforming Mexico into a net\nexporter by the early 1960s. With the transfer of the Mexican\nseeds and breeding approaches to India and Pakistan, the Green\nTable 2, which incorporates data on Mexican production,\nhighlights the role of the Green Revolution in pushing production\ninto hotter and drier zones. In 1929, Mexico accounted for only 1%\nof the sum of United States, Canadian, and Mexican output, so\nMexico's inclusion has little effect on the overall North American\ndistributions. However, its share grew about fourfold by 1969 and\neven more by 2007, so its inclusion in the latter years is important,\nparticularly for the distributions of latitude, temperature, and\nprecipitation. The row in Table 2 marking the southern 10% of\nproduction shows that the latitude of the distribution including\nMexico. The row showing 90% by annual temperature quantifies\nthe movement into hotter domains. The temperature line for the\nhottest 10% of North American production including Mexico in-\nMexico excluded. Finally, the row for the lowest 10% of wheat\nproduction measured by annual precipitation shows a greater ex-\npansion into drier areas. Including Mexico substantially widens the\nconditions under which North American wheat was grown after\n1929, essentially continuing trends that had been underway over\nthe previous century.\nAdaptation. Adjusting to climate change will require shifts in the\nlocation of production along with changes in germplasm, sowing\ndates, tillage practices, and water management at specific loca-\ntions (28, 29). We can obtain a sense of the significance of past\nadjustments by examining the shifts from spring to winter wheat\ncultivars. When the upper Midwest, the northern Great Plains,\nand the Canadian Prairies were first settled, hard red spring\nwheat generally was the only reliable option. Wherever feasible,\nfarmers prefer to grow winter wheat instead of spring wheat.\nWinter wheat generally offers significantly higher yields and is\nless subject to damage from insects and diseases, but in colder\nclimates it suffers high losses to winterkill.\nAgronomists have long recognized that the development of\nhearty winter cultivars that could be grown in harsher climates was\nan historic achievement. Our detailed data on production and cul-\ntivars allow us to quantify the extent of the change. Fig. 2 maps the\nTable 1.

Data incorporating Mexican wheat production,\nNorth America\n(including Mexico)\nCanada and United\nStates only\nLatitude (degrees)\nLongitude (degrees)\nAnnual temperature (\u00b0C)\nAnnual precipitation (cm)\n(by regression analysis). Spring wheat output generally exceeded\nwinter wheat output in the counties north of the estimated frontier,\nand winter wheat dominated south of the frontier. Between 1869\nand 1929 scientific advances allowed winter wheat production to\nspread northward across most of Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and\nOklahoma as well as into large regions of Illinois, Wisconsin, and\nfrontiers accounted for more than one-fifth of all North American\nlarge areas in South Dakota and Montana (30).\nThis displacement of one wheat type by another represented one\nof many ways that farmers used technology to adapt to climatic\nconditions. Within each class of wheat, farmers generally have\nadopted later planting dates during the 20th century (31, 32).\nMechanical technologies allow more rapid and timely performance\nof tillage operations. Low-tillage practices and irrigation have be-\ncome increasingly common. In addition, farmers in many areas\nhave increased efficiency by substituting other crops for wheat.\nBecause of climate change, some areas presumably will decrease\nor cease wheat production, whereas other areas, particularly in\nnorthern Canada and Alaska, are expected to enter production.\nAlthough the anticipated movement in the wheat frontier is sub-\nstantial, it is unlikely to be as great as the past geographic shifts in\nproduction. The difficulties in extending the transportation in-\nfrastructure to facilitate future shifts also appear less imposing\nthan those overcome to open the Plains and Prairies. The chal-\nlenging problems deal with adapting growing practices and creating\nimproved cultivars.\nTable 3, which relates the predicted changes in annual mean\nclimatic conditions to the current geographic variation across five\nsample locations, offers some guidance on agricultural adaptability.\nture and precipitation (baseline climate data) and the conditions in\ncirculation model (33, 34) used by the World Bank, among others.\nColumbus, OH, serves as useful point of comparison, because its\nmatic conditions that existed near the geographic center of the\ndistribution of North American wheat production in 1839 (35). The\nlast two columns of the table, which show the differences between\nthe Columbus baseline and the other four locations, illustrate the\nwidearrayofclimaticconditionstowhichwheathasbeenadaptedin\nNorth America during the past 170 y. Even with the predicted an-\nnual mean temperature by 2100, farmers near Edmonton, AB, and\nDickerson, ND, will confront substantially colder conditions than\neastern wheat growers faced circa 1839. Even with the anticipated\nincrease in precipitation, the northern farmers will have to make do\nwith about half the precipitation that the earlier generation of\neastern farmers received. The predicted changes in Dodge City, KS,\nandCiudadObreg\u00f3n,Sonora,Mexico,suggest bothhotteranddrier\nconditions than were common at the center of North American\nproduction in 1839 (again, a climate akin to that in Columbus, OH,\nin the baseline period). Note, however, that the difference in tem-\nperature between Columbus and Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n was roughly six\ntimes the increase predicted in the latter city by 2100. Wheat pro-\nduction is sensitive to seasonal fluctuations in weather conditions,\nwhich probably will become more variable in the future and which\nare not captured by annual mean data (29). Nevertheless, the his-\ntorical record of adapting wheat cultivation to areas with widely\nvarying climates is impressive.\nConclusions\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, new technologies allowed\nNorth American farmers to push wheat cultivation repeatedly\ninto environments once thought too arid, too variable, and too\nharsh to farm. Most notably, the median precipitation norm of the\n1929 distribution of North American wheat production was one-\nhalf that of the 1839 distribution--that is, about 50 fewer cm/y.\nFor the most part, the settlement process required adapting cul-\ntivation to colder and more arid regions, not to hotter climates\nas predicted in the future. Farming with less water is more of a\nproblem if the temperature also is hotter. However, biological\ninnovations also were crucial to the expansion of production in\nhot-arid areas such as Texas, Oklahoma, central California, and\nnorthern Mexico. The currently predicted changes during the\nnext century will, in a sense, reverse the predominant historical\npath of the past two centuries by creating a warmer and wetter\nenvironment in the Plains and Prairies that will partially approach\nthe conditions that existed in the Middle Atlantic region when it\nconstituted the North American wheat belt.\nThere will be enormous challenges to the agricultural sector\nassociated with impending climate changes. Public and private\nresearch will be crucial to address the new environmental re-\nalities, as it was in facilitating the past movement in production.\nGiven the challenges ahead and the long lags between invest-\nments in research and their payoffs, reinvigorating public sup-\nport for research to promote agricultural adaptability should be\na high policy priority (36).\nMethods\nProduction Data.
