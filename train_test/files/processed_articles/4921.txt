Such departments are affected by patient\nintake and discharge, as well as internal processes and staff-\ning, thus waiting times are difficult for staff to handle (Derlet\n& Richards, 2000; Swedish Council on Health Technology\nThere have been numerous cases of medical error in\nSwedish emergency departments (K\u00e4llberg, G\u00f6ransson,\n\u00d6stergren, Florin, & Ehrenberg, 2013; The National Board\nof Health and Welfare [Socialstyrelsen], 2013). Bodily harm\nand mental suffering occur as a result of contact with the\nhealth services. In Sweden, patient safety is defined by law\nas protection against medical error, and each hospital must\nproactive is a way to reduce the risks and according to Crant\n(2000), proactivity results in individual questioning of the\nstatus quo to create change, rather than passively adapting to\nthe existing situation.\nPrevious studies have revealed that a high workload\nmakes emergency department staff members become more\nreactive, that is, reacting to something that already has\nhappened. Reactive can be defined as reacting to problems\nwhen they occur instead of doing something to prevent\nthem (Rollenhagen, 2005), that is, a patient who becomes\nhypotensive while waiting for medical assessment. The\norganization's approach to patient safety also becomes\nreactive as the deviation from standard procedure is only\nfocused upon after an incident has occurred. The area of\npatient safety is still underdeveloped and has been\ndescribed as too focused on the individual, that is, the pro-\nfessionals are subject to supervision and sanctions as\nopposed to the organization and authorities responsible for\nthe healthcare system as a whole (Rollenhagen, 2005).\nTo improve patient safety and the working environment,\nstaff and management must be flexible, patient-focused, and\nproactive (Rollenhagen, 2005). The latter implies taking\ncontrol and making things happen, anticipating and prevent-\ning problems, as well as seizing opportunities (Parker, Bindl,\n& Strauss, 2010). The following is a comprehensive descrip-\ntion of the concept of proactivity based on previous research:\nThe emergency room can be defined as a closed system\nwhere its different parts affect each other. The activities at the\nemergency room are, as Donabedian already highlighted in\n1978, a triad of structure, process, and outcome (Donabedian,\n1NU sjukv\u00e5rden, Trollh\u00e4ttan, Sweden\n2School of Health Sciences, Trollh\u00e4ttan, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nElisabeth Dahlborg-Lyckhage, School of Health Sciences, Gustava Melins\nEmail: Elisabeth.dahlborg-lyckhage@hv.se\nProactive Interventions: An Observational\nStudy at a Swedish Emergency\nDepartment\nKarin Rehnstr\u00f6m1 and Elisabeth Dahlborg-Lyckhage2\n Keywords\nadvanced nursing interventions, patient safety, practical wisdom, proactivity\n2 SAGE Open\n1978). A proactive personality identifies opportunities to act\nand to avoid obstruction between these parts. This quality has\nbeen found to have positive effects on work performance and\ninnovation. From a team perspective, the proactive individual\nexhibits greater productivity and efficiency. Personal initia-\ntive is when an individual actively takes the initiative, even if\nit means going beyond the stated job description. High confi-\ndence in one's ability to carry through own decisions increases\nthe individual's chances of performing beyond her or his offi-\ncial duties. Personal initiatives that exceed prescribed assign-\nments and challenge the status quo are constructive for an\nAn employee who is both willing and able to perform beyond\nher or his professional duties is important for the flexibility of\nan organization. The purpose of proactive behavior is\nimprovement, which may require the individual to develop or\neven reformulate her or his role, representing a situation-\nbased approach to proactivity (Crant, 2000; Morrison Wolfe\nA narrative study by Kucera, Higgins, and McMillan\n(2010) presents nurses' perceptions of advanced nursing\ncare. A characteristic of nurses who perform such interven-\ntions is that they have foresight and consider the conse-\nquences for all involved before taking action. Advanced\nnurses focus on the patient, and their interventions often alle-\nviate patient suffering. Their thoughts and actions form a\nunit, as theoretical knowledge and experience constitute the\nfoundation of advanced practice. Experience-based knowl-\nedge has been defined as a combination of theoretical and\ntacit knowledge, intuition, experience, personal maturity,\nand practical wisdom. It is developed in practical situations\nby interaction with patients and discussion with colleagues\nWhen nurses perform advanced nursing interventions\nbased on knowledge and experience, it can be compared with\nwhat Crant (2000) defined as a proactive personality.\nAdvanced nurses can be said to work on the basis of proactive\nbehavior, which requires something beyond the usual job per-\nformance. However, not all nurses have sufficient knowledge\nand experience. Identifying proactive interventions that less\nadvanced nurses can perform in stressful situations in the\nemergency department would be valuable. In this study, we\nfocus on proactive actions as no previous study on proactive\nactivities in the emergency department has been found.\nAim\nThe aim of this study is to describe emergency nurses'proac-\ntive activities as well as barriers to and opportunities for pro-\nactive work.\nMethod\nBy focusing on human interactions, the researcher can\nunderstand and describe the participants' social reality by\nparticipating in it. The ethnographic approach enables\ndescriptions of both events and actions as well as compris-\ning an emic and an etic perspective together providing a bal-\nanced picture of the reality (Fetterman, 1998; Hammersley\nDesign\nA case study with a qualitative approach inspired by ethnogra-\nphy was performed. During the field work in an ethnographic\nstudy, the participants' behavior is more or less influenced by\nthe researcher's presence (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007).\nPellatt (2002) described this as reactivity in a group. Participant\nobservation is a data collection strategy that requires the\nresearcher to be open to the various processes. There is a risk\nof the researcher becoming more subjective and lacking objec-\ntivity by \"going native\" (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007).\nThus, reflexivity is the basis for credibility and accuracy in\nethnographic research and requires the researcher to highlight\nemerging social relationships and their possible impact on\nfuture work (Pellatt, 2002). Observations are a qualified form\nof data collection, during which a person's condition, non-\nverbal language, and specific activities are studied. An ethno-\ngraphic design also contains interviews with key persons\nIn a qualitative study, it is important to reflect on one's\nown pre-understanding of the phenomenon in question and\nhow it can influence the observations (Hammersley &\nAtkinson, 2007). The data were collected by the first author,\nwho has 14 years of experience as a registered nurse, 10 of\nwhich were spent in an emergency department.\nSetting and Participants\nThe case study was conducted at a Swedish emergency\ndepartment with an annual patient flow of about 57,000 and\nbased on both participant observations and interviews. The\nextent of the data, such as the number of observations and\ninterviews, is determined by what emerges during the data\ncollection. For this reason, the number of observations was\nnot determined in advance. The observations were performed\nInterviews complemented the observations to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the phenomenon of proactivity. A strategic\nselection of participants working during the actual study period\nwas made by the first author, leading to the recruitment of one\nman and two women aged between 22 and 45 years. Nurses\nwith varying lengths of experience of working in the emergency\ndepartment were chosen to explore whether the number of years\nin the profession influenced the perception of proactivity.\nData Collection\nThe observations were carried out by the first author who\nfollowed four emergency nurses in their daily work and\nRehnstr\u00f6m and Dahlborg-Lyckhage 3\nmade field notes structured as a protocol. Their time in the\nprofession ranged from 6 months to 19 years. This included\nthe time at which and location where the observation was\ncarried out, details of the various situations, who acted and in\nwhat way. The researcher's own reflections were also docu-\nmented. A total of 32 hr of observations were conducted to\nidentify proactive interventions.\nThree other emergency nurses were interviewed. An\ninterview guide with the following open-ended questions\nwas used; in your opinion, what does a proactive approach\nmean? Do you see any barriers to working proactively? Do\nyou see any opportunities for working proactively? The\ninterviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.\nAnalysis\nThe field work was conducted in parallel with the reading of\nand reflection on the field notes. This constituted a prelimi-\nnary analysis, where the first reading provided ideas for new\napproaches and questions for future observations. Nineteen\nfield notes were analyzed by means of content analysis and\nvarious proactive interventions identified (for an example,\nsee Table 1).\nThe interviews were also analyzed by means of content\nanalysis on a manifest level (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004),\nmeaning that it is the transcribed text itself that is analyzed,\nwithout interpretation. The recorded interviews were thus\ntranscribed verbatim and formed the unit of analysis. The\ntext was read several times and broken down into meaning\nunits, which were then condensed and abstracted to make the\ntext shorter and more manageable, while preserving the core\ncontent. The condensed text was grouped into categories that\nillustrate the nurses' opinions of various proactive interven-\ntions (for an example, see Table 2).\nEthical Reflection\nEthical approval was obtained from the University West\nThe manager of the emergency department approved the\nstudy, and each of the participating nurses provided written\nconsent. Only the nurses were observed, and the patients\nwere not included (Central Ethical Review Board, 2012). In\nethnographic studies, the researcher has close contact with\nthe participants, making it important to establish a good rela-\ntionship with them. The researchers must be aware that their\npresence may be perceived as intrusive or unpleasant and\nshould therefore leave in sensitive situations or ask the par-\nticipants to inform them when observations are not appropri-\nate (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007). This was taken into\naccount during the study. The four ethical principles govern-\ning the humanities and social sciences were adhered to, thus\nthe study meets the requirements on information, consent,\nconfidentiality, and utilization (World Medical Association\nFindings\nThe results of the observations and interviews, which have\nbeen grouped into categories and sub-categories, are pre-\nsented below.\nBeing One Step Ahead\nThe nurses identified risks in their assessment and prioritiza-\ntion and tried to address them, such as giving medications\nbased on general prescriptions, meaning that pharmaceutical\ntreatment can be given by the nurse before the physician\nencounter the patient. They would like more general pre-\nscriptions and memorandums but worried that their own\nexpertise might be insufficient. The interviews revealed that\nthe nurses made risk assessments to maintain patient safety.\n\"Being one step ahead, identifying risks and taking action\nbefore anything serious happens\" (Nurse 1).\nWhen the nurses had clear patient goals and care plans,\nthey could identify safety risks and take action to prevent\nthem. The observations revealed that with a higher inflow of\npatients, the greater the importance of a proactive approach.\nTable 1.

The team took care of patients upon\narrival. The collaboration between the two professional\ncategories ensured focus on the patient and the formulation\nof a clear care plan, which shortened the administrative pro-\ncedure. An example was when the physician and the nurse\naccompanied the patient for a chest X-ray test and obtained\ndirect response. This patient passed quickly through the\nemergency chain, demonstrating a proactive approach.\nThe observations showed that the number of proactive\ninterventions carried out when the patient inflow was high\nlargely depended on the nurse responsible for coordinating\nthe work in the emergency department.\nIf you work in a different way [more proactively] it may well be that\nit will lead to less work and quicker handling, which will prevent a\nbottleneck developing here and having to move patients around. If\nwe stay on our toes from the start, we can save time. (Nurse 1)\nFigure 1. Prerequisites for proactive work.\nRehnstr\u00f6m and Dahlborg-Lyckhage 5\nPrerequisites for Proactive Work\nThe gradual development of a proactive approach was\ndescribed by a nurse as follows:\nProactivity develops gradually. You may not be very proactive\nwhen you are new on the job as an nurse . . . it will come with\ntime, experience and understanding of what you're doing.\nDuring the interviews, the nurses highlighted the impor-\ntance of gaining skills through training, which to some extent\nwould make them willing to assume more responsibility.\nThey considered that there was a need to upgrade the skills of\nall staff members as well as for additional memorandums and\nguidelines. \"It would be possible to do more if it was made\nclear how we should work, i.e., more guidelines\" (Nurse 3)\nIn the observations, it was noted that experienced nurses\ncould identify new questions and cues that facilitated a more\naccurate assessment based on patients' narratives. They could\nalso clearly envisage the likely treatment plan and therefore\nworked more proactively than their less experienced colleagues.\nAn example from the observations was the treatment of a\npatient with newly discovered diabetes. The experienced nurse\ntook an arterial gas sample shortly after the patient had entered\nthe triage room to determine further interventions. She then per-\nformed the routine checkups and put the patient on a drip. The\npatient's blood glucose was 24 mmol / l (432 mg/dl), and when\nthe result of the arterial gas sample was available, no acidosis or\nelectrolyte disorders were found. The nurse knew that if the\nblood glucose could be corrected in the emergency department,\nthe patient could probably go home after medical assessment.\nThe nurse asked a physician to prescribe rapid insulin, which\nshe administered to the patient. When the patient was subse-\nquently assessed by a physician, the blood sugar had normalized\nand she or he was able to return home with oral treatment for the\ndiabetes and follow-up at her or his health center. This nurse\nused advanced nursing interventions thanks to her long emer-\ngency department experience.\nWorking Reactively\nOrganizational barriers to a proactive approach were mentioned\nby all the informants. Such barriers included time constraints,\nshortages, hierarchy, an increased number of patients, poor col-\nlaboration between hospital departments as well as between\nmunicipal care, primary care, and the county council. When the\ncontinuum of care did not function in an optimal way, the staff\nlost control of patients' care plans and reverted to a reactive\napproach, which meant patients having to spend more time in the\nemergency department as well as a risk to their safety.The nurses'\nwork environment was also affected, resulting in negative stress.\nThe patient has to wait before being transferred to the ward . . .\ncontinue caring for those who are ready for transfer to the ward. . . .\nthere is no time to work proactively with other patients. (Nurse 2)\nLess proactive interventions were used if the nurse had\nlittle skill and experience. The observations also high-\nlighted a difference between nurses in terms of length of\nprioritization and assessment experience. For example, two\nnurses with between 1 and 3 years of experience asked\nstandard questions about the patients' condition and lacked\nthe ability to follow up on important cues that emerged\nfrom patients' narratives. They carefully adhered to and\nbased their assessment on standard care plans. This was in\ncontrast to the work conducted by two other nurses with\nbetween 14 and 19 years of experience. In addition to stan-\ndard questions, they were able to identify new questions\nand cues that facilitated a more accurate assessment. They\ncould also clearly envisage the likely treatment plan and\ntherefore worked more proactively than their less experi-\nenced colleagues.\nTo illustrate proactivity a narrative was constructed from\nthe data.\nA morning at the emergency department.10:16 a.m.: Some\npatients have been in the emergency department overnight\nbut generally it is quiet. New patients begin arriving, and\nwithin 2 hr the department is crowded. When the seventh\npatient's name is called, the nurse notices an elderly woman\nwho was brought to the ward in a wheelchair by a relative. On\nthe referral note, the nurse read that the General Practitioner\n(GP) suspected a deep venous thrombosis in the left leg. The\nrelatives had driven the patient 60 kilometers in their own car\nfrom the health center to the hospital. The nurse takes the\npatient's medical history while an assistant nurse checks the\npatient's blood pressure, pulse, oxygenation capacity, respira-\ntory rate, and temperature. The nurse then examines the\npatient's leg and comes to the conclusion that the referral is\nincorrect and diagnoses a partial Achilles tendon rupture, an\northopedic disorder, being one step ahead. The emergency\northopedic clinic is located in a hospital 30 kilometers away.\nHowever, the nurse does not have the authority to change the\nreferral, which can only be done by a physician after exami-\nnation of the patient. The nurse now tries to contact the emer-\ngency physician on duty, but without success. Expected\nwaiting time for the physicians on the medical emergency\nward is about 4 hr for low priority patients. The nurse's goal\nis for this patient to obtain appropriate care from the right\nphysician as quickly as possible. She realizes that the patient\nwill have to stay in the emergency department for at least 4 hr\nbefore probably being referred to the orthopedics department.\nShe phones the orthopedic clinic at the same hospital and con-\ntacts the orthopedic surgeon on call, and start proactive inter-\nventions. The orthopedic department staff usually only treat\npatients who have an appointment. However, the orthopedic\nsurgeon is able to come to the triage room to examine the\npatient and confirms a partial Achilles tendon rupture. The\npatient is brought to the orthopedic clinic where she is set in\nplaster and discharged.\n6 SAGE Open\nIn this narrative, the nurse was one step ahead and envis-\naged the patient's passage through the continuum of care as\nwell as the probable treatment plan. The definitive treatment\nplan is determined by the physician after her or his assess-\nment of the patient. The use of standard care plans for vari-\nous medical conditions is common in the emergency\ndepartment. Although these are helpful when the patient's\ndiagnosis is clear, they are not individualized and require the\nnurses to assess the patient's medical condition. In the above\nscenario, the patient had leg pain and the GP suspected a\ndeep vein thrombosis. Experience combined with practical\nand theoretical knowledge is a prerequisite for nurses to act\nin accordance with a likely treatment plan and provide indi-\nvidualized care. In the above example, the nurse used\nadvanced nursing interventions and exhibited practical wis-\ndom as prerequisites for proactive work.\nDiscussion\nThe proactive interventions described are only possible if the\nnecessary conditions are in place. Many obstacles to proac-\ntive work were organizational. Lack of time, overcrowding,\nas well as poor internal and external collaboration are some\nexamples. We observed that opportunities for proactivity\nincreased when the care plan was established at an early\nstage of the continuum of care and when all team members\nwere aware of it.\nPatient safety would probably be improved by nurses con-\ntinually assessing risk and priority. A clear care plan facili-\ntates and simplifies risk assessment, which is likely to enable\nnurses to work toward a common goal where proactive\npatient care is in focus. Formulating a care plan requires the-\noretical, practical, and experiential knowledge. The nurses\nwho performed advanced nursing interventions had such\nknowledge. The fact that some nurses possessed practical\nwisdom, which according to Crant's (2000) theory can be\nequated with a proactive personality, meant that they worked\nmore proactively.\nOberle and Allen (2001) attempted to define what is\nrequired for nurses to be able to perform advanced nursing\ninterventions and suggested that practical wisdom is a hall-\nmark of such nurses. Practical wisdom enables the nurse to\nknow when a particular action should be initiated and when\nit gives maximum benefit to the patient, indicating that skills,\nability, and maturity are the main attributes of the advanced\nnurse in practice. Aristotle described three forms of knowl-\nedge: episteme, techne, and phronesis. Episteme is \"true\"\nknowledge, as it is general and safe. Techne is preparedness\nfor how to perform practice. Phronesis is reflection in the\nform of moral reasoning with the intention of doing \"good\"\nin a given situation and important for the development of\npractical wisdom (Connor, 2004; Dahlborg-Lyckhage &\nBy informing patients about the likely care plan, nurses\nare in a position to prevent the suffering of care as well as\nincreasing patients' feeling of being looked after, thus allevi-\nating their sense of powerlessness and uncertainty. Patients'\nexperience of care is of great importance both for the indi-\nvidual herself or himself and as an indicator of the quality of\ncare and what needs to be improved. Patient satisfaction is\ninfluenced by the care process (Cooke, Watt, Wertzler, &\nDuring the observations, it was found that teams compris-\ning a physician and a nurse were beneficial for patients, as\nthere was greater focus on them and the treatment was pro-\nvided with less delay. Problems arose when the team had to\ndeal with too many patients, as for example, the physician\nhad time to examine a new patient while the nurse did not;\nthus, the positive effects of teamwork were lost. Previous\nstudies have revealed that teamwork functions best when the\nteam members jointly conduct the first assessment of each\npatient (Lau & Leung, 1997; Mazzocato, Hvitfeldt Forsberg,\nThe long waiting times due to an increase in the number of\npatients led to the suffering of care and also posed a risk to\npatient safety. When nurses had to keep track of too many\ncare plans, continuous re-prioritization and risk assessment\nbecame impossible. The nurses experienced this as negative\nstress, which in turn can lead to decreased cognitive function-\ning and is one reason why there is a greater risk of making\nmistakes while under stress. While individual professionals\ncan handle stress, it becomes more difficult in a context where\nboth the organization and the technology make high demands.\nTools that can provide an overview of patients' care plans\nThe nurses considered that there was a need for all staff\nmembers to develop higher skills in order to be able to work\nproactively. A high level of competence is important for both\nthe individual patient and the emergency department organi-\nzation (SBU, 2010).The ability to perform advanced nursing\ninterventions may thus evolve over time, which means that\nFigure 2. Factors leading to a reactively work.\nRehnstr\u00f6m and Dahlborg-Lyckhage 7\nnurses can gradually develop a proactive approach. The\nstudy revealed various proactive interventions that nurses\nperform irrespective of their level of skill, such as improving\nvarious forms of documentation and guidelines.\nIn other parts of the world, emergency departments are\nstaffed by specially trained \"nurse practitioners.\" In the United\nKingdom, this has generally led to benefits for patients (Byrne,\npractitioners perform advanced nursing interventions and their\nskills are utilized, which could also increase the quality of\nemergency department care in Sweden.\nThe observations indicated both organizational and\nskills related barriers to and opportunities for maintaining\na high level of patient safety. Due to the long waiting time\nfor physicians, the nurse's skill in prioritizing patients'\nmedical conditions was important. The study revealed that\nthe nurses' experience affected their assessment of a\npatient's medical condition. Lack of skills and time ren-\nders the organization vulnerable, possibly resulting in\npoorer patient safety (Andersson, Omberg, & Svedlund,\n2006). In an organization such as that in which the study\nwas conducted, staff members possess different levels of\nexperience and skills; thus, not everyone can perform\nadvanced nursing interventions. It is therefore important\nthat the organization provides nurses with opportunities\nand conditions to work in a way that can develop their\npractical wisdom over time. Being involved in and able to\ninfluence their workplace promotes individuals' learning\nability, as they are shaped by each other. The organization\nplays a major role in supporting human relations, work\nethics, motivation and the creation of a stimulating learn-\nOrganizational conditions that sustain and enhance staff\nskills could be a first step in promoting more concrete proac-\ntive interventions which, in combination with a clear focus\non the patient, would ultimately generate a higher level of\npatient safety and indirectly cost-effectiveness (Olsson,\nLimitations of the study\nPerforming an observational study at one's own workplace\ninvolves both advantages and disadvantages. The benefit of\nan emic perspective is that the researcher's pre-understand-\ning can lead to a deeper comprehension of and a trusting rela-\ntionship with the participants. A disadvantage may be that it\nis difficult to be objective. The first author's pre-understand-\ning included experiences as a nurse and theoretical knowl-\nedge, but also preconceptions. Taken together, this may have\ninfluenced the results of the data collection as well as the\nanalysis and interpretation. During the observations, the role\nof participant observer enabled the researcher to be close to\nthe participants, but without losing the distance necessary for\nthe objectivity of the data collection and subsequent analysis\nThe first author was known in the department, which\nmade it easier to perform the study in the limited timeframe.\nHowever, the researcher is also influenced by the partici-\npants. In the present study, this meant that on some occa-\nsions the researcher had to prevent herself from entering\ninto a nurse role. Reflexivity can be achieved by moving\nbetween reflection and the field notes, something that was\ndone. To achieve credibility, sources of potential influence\nshould be made visible and discussed with the co-author\nthroughout the study. Citations have been presented to\nstrengthen credibility, and the analysis remained close to\nthe original text. However, a certain degree of abstraction\nand interpretation is needed for the result to be deemed\nmeaningful and comprehensible (Hammersley & Atkinson,\nConclusion\nIt is not easy to identify and describe proactive interventions,\nas emergency work is very complex and dynamic. Various\ncare interventions, tasks, and processes are interdependent.\nWhen something is done in one part of the system, it affects\nanother. Nevertheless, the study has contributed knowledge\nof proactivity within emergency departments and highlighted\nvarious ways of increasing patient safety, which involve\nlooking beyond the organizational problems and cost effi-\nciency to ensure that the patient is prioritized. The proactive\ninterventions concerned concrete actions aimed at benefiting\npatients in both the short and the long term. More research is\nneeded on how proactive interventions can be implemented\nin practice. Much of the frustration experienced by patients\nas well as staff in an emergency department concerns antici-\npation. Patients and nurses have to wait for, among other\nthings, the physician, patients to be admitted to a ward, and\nX-ray test results. For nurses, this study may contribute to\nthe understanding of how one can work proactively to pro-\nmote the patients' progress in the continuum of care while\nmaintaining patient safety. The results presented might be\nuseful for nurses who have not yet developed practical wis-\ndom and the hope is that they will become a basis for discus-\nsion, contributing new ideas that can help them in their daily\nwork. Opportunities for education and systematic reflection\nmust be present in the organization to enable nurses to work\nproactively.\n"
