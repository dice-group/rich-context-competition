AVCM was classified as mild (type I), moderate (type II) or\nsevere (type III), according to laryngoscopic findings.\nResults: The study included 1619 patients, of whom 39 had preoperative AVCM and 65 had\npostoperative AVCM. Recovery rates for preoperative, postoperative and total type I AVCM were\nhigher than the corresponding type III AVCM. Recovery rates for total type II AVCM were higher\nthan those for type III AVCM at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Asymptomatic patients had\nbetter recovery rates than symptomatic patients.\nConclusion: We have developed a useful classification system for patients with AVCM after\nthyroidectomy. Pre- and postoperative laryngoscopy can identify asymptomatic AVCM and is\nessential to evaluate the extent of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in these patients.\n",

Generally, the\nvocal fold initially remains in the parame-\ndian position, and definite vocal changes\nmay develop over days or weeks.10 The\nincidence of RLNI is highest during re-\nexplorations, Graves' disease or thyroid\noccur as a result of stretch injury, pressure,\ncrush injury, electrocautery, suction trauma\nor ischaemia,13,14 but it is difficult to deter-\nmine the cause of RLNI during surgery as\nthese injuries are not visually discernible. To\nreduce the incidence of RNLI, the anatom-\nical structure should be carefully assessed.\nThe integrity of the recurrent laryngeal\nnerve can be guaranteed by careful identifi-\ncation and assessment during the surgical\nprocedure, as visual identification may\ndecrease the risk of permanent nerve palsy\nafter thyroid surgery.15\nPerioperative vocal fold paralysis can be\nassessed using functional voice assessment\n(via endoscopy) and vocal function assess-\nment (e.g., maximum phonation time, pitch\nrange, perceptual voice quality, etc.).16\nThere are no validated laryngoscopic stand-\nards available for vocal cord function assess-\nment after thyroidectomy, however. Such\nstandards would allow assessment of the\npresence and extent of nerve damage, and\nthe risk of aspiration or respiratory com-\npromise due to vocal cord impairment. The\naim of the present study was to develop a\nnew classification scheme for AVCM before\nand after thyroid surgery. Such a scheme\ncould be used to evaluate the extent of pre-\nand postoperative RLNI in patients with\nthyroid disease, and predict the prognosis\nof RLNI.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective cohort study included all\npatients (including those with vocal cord\ndysfunction caused by thyroid disease) who\nunderwent partial or total thyroidectomy\nand perioperative laryngoscopic examin-\nation at the Department of Thyroid\nSurgery, China\u00adJapan Union Hospital,\nand January 2011. Exclusion criteria were:\nother vocal cord disease; laryngeal disease;\nlaryngeal surgery.\nThe study was approved by the institu-\ntional review board of China\u00adJapan Union\nHospital, Changchun, China, and all\npatients (or their next-of-kin if aged <18\nyears) provided written informed consent.\nIONM\nIn all patients, the recurrent laryngeal nerve\nwas exposed during thyroidectomy, and its\nfunctional integrity was determined using\nintraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM), as\ndescribed.11,17 The four-step IONM proced-\nure obtains electromagnetic signals from the\nvagus nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve\nbefore and after resection of the thyroid\nlobe. All IONM procedures were performed\nby the same physician (J.X.).\nLaryngoscopy\nAll patients underwent routine laryngo-\nscopic examination to assess vocal cord\nmovement (VCM) before and 1 day after\nsurgery (ENF-P4 laryngoscope; Olympus,\nTokyo, Japan). All laryngoscopic exam-\ninations were performed by the same\nphysician (J.X.), and abnormal vocal cord\nmovements were confirmed by an experi-\nenced otolaryngologist. Pre- and postopera-\ntive laryngoscopy findings were compared.\nPatients were stratified between three\ngroups: control (normal pre- and postopera-\ntive findings); preoperative abnormal\n(abnormal preoperative findings); and post-\noperative abnormal (normal preoperative\nbut abnormal postoperative findings).\nIn the case of normal postoperative\nlaryngoscopy findings, no further examin-\nations were performed. In all other cases,\nlaryngoscopy was repeated at 7 days and 1, 3\nand 6 months after surgery, or until normal\nVCMs were observed (to a maximum of 1\nyear). Patients were considered to have\npermanent vocal cord damage if their laryn-\ngoscopy findings were abnormal 6 months\nafter surgery. Patients with postoperative\nAVCM were given standard treatment,\nwith intravenous dexamethasone and oral\nvitamin B.\nRecurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring\nThe NIM\u00d5 II monitoring system\n(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was\nused to monitor, test and confirm visual\nidentification of the recurrent laryngeal\nnerve. After its intraoperative visual\nidentification, the nerve stimulator settings\nrepeated at the most distal part of the\ndissected recurrent laryngeal nerve to the\nentry point. The stimulus necessary to gen-\nerate a response at the cricoarytenoid joint\nand distal dissection was recorded for each\nnerve. Vagal stimulation was performed\nwith a current of 1 mA after direct anatom-\nical exposure of the vagus nerve. Pathologi-\ncal reports and information regarding\npatients' pre- and postoperative vocal cord\nmobility were reviewed and documented.\nAVCM classification\nNormal VCM was defined as bilaterally\nsymmetrical and fast, with normal ampli-\ntude. AVCM was classified as mild (type I),\nmoderate (type II), or severe (type III),\nbased on laryngoscopic findings and neuro-\nmonitoring (Table 1).\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as n (%) and compared\nusing 2-test. Statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS\u00d5\nChicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5. P-\nvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nTable 1.

RLNI is\ngenerally unilateral and transient, but is\nsometimes bilateral and permanent, causing\nparalysis of the vocal cords or true vocal-\nfold paresis.12,20 Surgeons can prevent per-\nmanent injury to the RLN during surgery by\nidentifying and carefully tracing the recur-\nrent laryngeal nerve's path21 or using nerve-\nmonitoring devices, but the most effective\nmethod for protecting the nerve remains\nunclear. Although the incidence of perman-\nent recurrent laryngeal nerves paralysis\nafter thyroidectomy is relatively low\nplication that may affect a patient's health-\nrelated quality-of-life.\nTable 4.

The results of the current\nstudy underline the importance of laryngos-\ncopy for visual identification of VCM.\nPatients with preoperative type I AVCM\nwere at a high risk of developing RLNI\nduring surgery in the present study, but all\nrecovered within 7 days after surgery. Of the\npatients with type III preoperative AVCM\nin the current study, the vast majority had\nRLN involvement due to cancer invasion\nand none recovered from the injury. The\nprognosis for patients with type I AVCM\nwas better than that for those with type III\nAVCM. In addition, the majority (87.2%)\nof patients in the present study with pre-\noperative AVCM were asymptomatic.\nTaken together, our findings indicate that\npreoperative laryngoscopy is necessary in\npatients undergoing thyroidectomy, in order\nto identify the underlying cause of AVCM\nand aid in determining prognosis.\nRepeated laryngoscopic examination\nmay provide essential information regarding\nAVCM recovery. Compared with day 1\nfindings, laryngoscopic findings were signifi-\ncantly improved at day 7 after surgery in\npatients with type I AVCM in the present\nstudy. Recovery was slower in patients\nwith type II or III AVCM. Timely laryngo-\nscopic examinations are therefore extremely\nimportant for the assessment of type II and\ntype III patients.\nThe present finding that 87.2% of\npatients with preoperative AVCM and\n55.4% of those with laryngoscopically-\nobserved postoperative AVCM were asymp-\ntomatic concurs with others who have sug-\ngested that it is arbitrary to judge VCM\npurely on the basis of clinical symp-\ntoms.22\u00ad25 We suggest that regular pre- and\npostoperative laryngoscopic examinations\nshould be performed in all patients sched-\nuled to undergo thyroid surgery, in order to\noffer timely medical treatment, shorten\nrecovery time and improve the outcome of\npatients with perioperative AVCM.\nAsymptomatic patients with pre- or post-\noperative AVCM had significantly better\noutcomes than symptomatic patients, in the\npresent study. It is possible that RLNI was\nless severe in asymptomatic patients than\nsymptomatic ones, resulting in more rapid\nrecovery. The presence of clinical symptoms\nmay therefore be an indicator of poor\noutcome in patients with RLNI.\nThe present study is limited by the follow-\nup schedule, since it was not possible to\ndetermine precise recovery times for RLNI.\nThe relationship between recovery time\nand RLN electrophysiological signals also\nrequires further investigation.\nIn conclusion, we have developed a useful\nclassification system for patients with RLNI\nafter thyroidectomy. Pre- and postoperative\nlaryngoscopy can identify asymptomatic\nAVCM and is essential to evaluate the\nextent of RLNI in these patients.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by funding from the\nChanges in Spectrum of Thyroid Diseases in Jilin\nProvince Before and After Universal Salt\nIodization and its Diagnosis and Treatment\nProvince Science and Technology Department.\nReferences\n1.
