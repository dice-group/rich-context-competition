In clinical trials, a 100-\nmmol reduction in dietary sodium in-\ntake was associated with an average re-\nduction in diastolic blood pressure of\ntially result in a 15% decrease in stroke\nmmol difference in dietary sodium in-\ntake was associated with a 32% in-\ncrease in stroke risk. The apparent\nexcess of observed RR of cardiovascu-\nlar disease associated with sodium in-\ntake compared with that expected on\nthe basis of anticipated blood pressure\nincrease suggests the possibility of an\nindependent direct effect of sodium in-\ntake on cardiovascular disease.\nAlderman and colleagues44 used data\nfrom the NHANES I Epidemiologic Fol-\nlow-up Study to examine the relation-\nship between dietary sodium intake and\nmortality from cardiovascular disease\nand all causes. In contrast with our find-\nings, they identified an inverse relation-\nship between sodium intake and mor-\ntality from cardiovascular disease\na positive relationship between sodium-\nto-energy ratio and mortality from car-\ndiovascular disease (P = .006) and all\ncauses (P.001). However, several\nmethodological concerns make it diffi-\ncult to interpret their findings. For in-\nstance, they did not exclude from their\nmain analysis participants with base-\nline histories of cardiovascular disease,\nalbeit such participants might have been\nexpected to have changed their dietary\nintake of sodium. In addition, they did\nnot exclude participants who were con-\nsuming low-sodium diets at baseline.\nAcute rheumatic fever, chronic rheu-\nmatic heart disease, and diseases of the\npulmonary circulation were included as\ncardiovascular mortality outcomes, al-\nthoughthereisnoobviousbiologicalba-\nsis for a relationship betweensodium in-\ntake and these diseases. Perhaps of\ngreatest concern is the fact that they in-\ncluded sodium intake, energy intake,\nand sodium-to-energy ratio as continu-\nous variables in the same multivariate\nmodel. Given that an interaction term\nwas included in their analysis model, it\nis not possible to interpret the main ef-\nfect of sodium intake alone on the out-\ncomes of interest. The inconsistency of\ntheassociationbetweenthe2sodiumin-\ntake indicators (sodium alone and so-\ndium-to-energy ratio) and outcomes of\ninterest in the study by Alderman et al\nmightreflecttheheterogeneityofthisre-\nlationshipinastudypopulationwithdif-\nferent body weights. In our analyses, we\nfound a consistent relationship be-\ntween both sodium intake and sodium-\nto-energy ratio with risk of cardiovas-\ncular disease and total mortality in\noverweight persons but not in nonover-\nweight persons.\nIn an earlier study, Alderman and col-\nleagues45 reported a significant inverse\nassociation between urinary sodium ex-\ncretion and incidence of myocardial in-\npatients treated for hypertension. Un-\nmeasured variables and imprecision of\nthepotentiallyconfoundingvariablesthat\nwere measured might have contributed\nto the occurrence of this unexpected\ndium excretion was measured after 5\ndaysofdietarysodiumrestriction,which\nmost likely would not have provided a\nvalid assessment of habitual intake of di-\netarysodium.Finally,thestudywascon-\nductedinhypertensivepatientswhowere\nenrolled in a work-site treatment pro-\ngram.Assuch,thefindingsmaynothave\ngeneral applicability. In our study, di-\netary sodium intake was not associated\nwithcoronaryheartdiseaseincidencebut\nwith increased coronary heart disease\nmortality. Similarly, analyses from the\nMultiple Risk Factors Intervention Trial\ncohort did not find an inverse associa-\ntion between sodium intake and inci-\ndence of myocardial infarction.48\nA limitation of our study is the esti-\nmation of sodium intake by a single\n24-hour dietary recall. This may result\nin misclassification of usual sodium\nintake at the individual level. In addi-\ntion, the dietary recall method used in\nNHANES I may have underestimated\nsodiumintakebecauseitdidnotinclude\nquantitativedataondiscretionaryuseof\nsalt in the cooking or seasoning of food\nat the table, settings that account for\nNHANES I study participants may have\nunderreported their dietary energy\nwould tend to bias our RR estimates\ntoward1(effectto0)inunivariatemod-\nels.Asidefromapossibleloweringofsen-\nsitivity to sodium intake in nonover-\nweight compared with overweight\npersons, these measurement errors in\nsodium intake might have contributed\nto our finding of a null association in\nnonoverweight persons. Another limi-\ntationisthatparticipantswerepassively\nfollowedupforclinicaloutcomes.How-\never,anyresultantmisclassificationbias\nis likely to have been confined to char-\nacterizationofincidentcasesandshould\nhavehadnoeffectonestimationofmor-\ntality experience.\nOur study has several important\nstrengths. First, the findings can be gen-\neralized to overweight persons in the\nUS general population because the\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up\nStudy cohort is a random sample of this\npopulation. In addition, temporal rela-\ntionships can be established with con-\nfidence because dietary sodium intake\nwas measured at baseline, and subse-\nquent cardiovascular disease and total\nmortality were assessed over an aver-\nage of 19 years. The fact that follow-up\nexperience was available for more than\n96% of study participants further en-\nhances the validity of our findings.\nOur study indicates that a high so-\ndium intake is strongly and indepen-\ndently associated with an increased risk\nof cardiovascular disease in over-\nweight persons. While we await addi-\ntional studies on this important pub-\nlic health issue, our findings support\nexisting recommendations for moder-\nate reduction in sodium intake aimed\nat reducing blood pressure and cardio-\nvascular disease risk in the over-\nweight adult population.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by grant\nthe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and a ca-\nreer development grant to Dr He from the Office of\nthe Dean, Tulane University School of Public Health and\nTropical Medicine.
