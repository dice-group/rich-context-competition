Regularly performed aerobic\nPA can increase fitness and reduce the risk of death from\ncardiovascular disease, various cancers, and complications\nof diabetes (22). Despite these public health recommenda-\npopulation engaged in regular activity that met the public\nhealth recommendations (4). Moreover, a large proportion\nof the population (39%) reported some activity, but not in\ncombinations of frequency, duration, and intensity equal to\nor exceeding recommendations (11).\nEpidemiological research suggests that the total amount\nof energy expended in PA has an important bearing on\nmortality rates (18). The rationale for recommending\nactivity on most days of the week is attributable to\nevidence from early intervention studies that involved\nexercise training over multiple days (7,21). The literature\nsuggests that certain risk factors such as blood pressure\n(14) and depressive symptoms (6) respond more favorably\nto more frequent bouts of aerobic PA. However, few\nstudies have been able to isolate the effect of physical\nactivity frequency for all-cause mortality (9).\nWeekend warrior is a colloquial term used to describe\npeople who tend to compress their weekly activity into\nlong durations (i.e., 4-h hike, 3 h of yard work, or an\nafternoon of basketball) on 1 or 2 dIwkj1. Anecdotal\nevidence suggests that weekend warriors are common in\nthe U.S. population and that they may be at risk of future\ninjury (20). Only recently, in a paper by Lee et al. (8), has\nthe dose of the weekend warrior pattern been examined in\nrelation to health outcomes. To date, there is insufficient\nevidence that an irregular PA pattern with an energy\nexpenditure comparable with the minimum PA recommen-\ndations is associated with overall health benefits. Weekend\nwarriors are of interest to public health because they may\nreap some health benefits by being physically active, but\nthey may be at a higher risk for chronic disease than those\nwho are regularly active. In addition, weekend warriors\nmay be receptive to increasing their PA frequency to\nimprove their cardiovascular health.\nAddress for correspondence: Judy Kruger, Ph.D., Division of Nutrition\nand Physical Activity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770\nCopyright \u00d3 2007 by the American College of Sports Medicine\nCopyright @ 2007 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

The purpose of this paper\nis to describe the prevalence, estimated energy expenditure,\nand types of activities performed by adults (Q 18 yr) who\nengage in irregular patterns of PA (1\u00ad2 dIwkj1) with a total\ntime of Q 150 minIwkj1 spent in moderate- and vigorous-\nintensity activity (i.e., weekend warriors).\nMETHODS\nSurvey descriptions. Data for this study were\nobtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance\nSystem (BRFSS) and the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES). These two surveys\nhave been described elsewhere (5,13) and are briefly\nsummarized below. For the purpose of our study, two\ncomplementary data sources were used to allow a more\ncomplete description of weekend warriors.\nThe BRFSS is a state-based, random-digit\u00addialed tele-\nphone survey of health risk behaviors in the civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized population in the United States. Data\nare collected each year by all 50 states and the District of\nColumbia. Self-reported data on moderate- and vigorous-\nintensity leisure-time, household, and transportation-\nrelated PA are reported in odd-numbered years. In 2003,\nthe sample size for 50 states and the District of Columbia\nwas assessed from responses to six questions about the\nfrequency and duration of moderate- and vigorous-intensity\nnonoccupational physical activity. Respondents were clas-\nsified as weekend warriors if their summed frequencies of\nmoderate- and/or vigorous-intensity PA was 1 or 2 d and\nif their summed durations totaled Q 150 minIwkj1 of\nmoderate- and vigorous-intensity PA. To estimate weekly\nenergy expenditure, moderate-intensity activities were\nassigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) value of 3.0, and\nvigorous-intensity activities were assigned 6.0 METs\naccording to the compendium of physical activities (1).\nMET-minutes per week were calculated by multiplying the\nMET value by the minutes per week of activity and\nsumming the moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity\nMET-minutes per week.\nBecause the 2003 BRFSS does not include questions\non specific types of physical activities performed,\nNHANES data were analyzed as part of this study to\nprovide additional descriptive details about PA patterns\namong weekend warriors. The NHANES is an in-person\nhealth interview and examination that collects information\non health conditions and risk factors. Data are collected\nin 2-yr cycles from the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized\npopulation. Survey questions about PA collected in three\nparable in wording and methods and, therefore, were com-\nbined to increase the sample size of adults aged Q 18 yr\n(N = 31,126). To examine types of activities reported, we\nanalyzed survey data questions about transportation, house-\nhold, sports, and leisure-time PA. Because the sample size\nfor each specific activity was small, we created two\ncategories: household/transportation-related activities, and\nsports/exercise-related activities.\ncdc.gov/nchs/guidelines1.pdf) were analyzed to identify\nweekend warriors, using responses to 16 PA questions on\ntransportation, household, sports, and leisure-time activities.\noverall response rate for those interviewed was 79.3%.\nTransportation-related PA was defined as walking or\nbicycling to work, school, or to do errands. Respondents\nwere asked about participation, frequency (i.e., how many\ntimes per day, per week, or per month), and duration\n(i.e., how many minutes or hours per day) of walking and\nbicycling. The NHANES survey also included three ques-\ntions about participation, frequency, and duration per\nsession of moderate-intensity household-related PA such as\ngardening, yard work, or heavy cleaning. The question on\nparticipation in vigorous-intensity leisure-time PA was,\n``Over the past 30 d, did [you] do any vigorous activities\nfor at least 10 min that caused heavy sweating, or large\nincreases in breathing or heart rate?'' Respondents who\nanswered ``yes'' were then asked to report on the specific\nsports and exercises from a list of 23 possible activities\n(e.g., running, basketball, aerobic exercise). Respondents\nwere then asked how often and for how long they performed\neach activity. Participation in moderate-intensity leisure-\ntime PA for at least 10 min per occasion, during the past\n30 d, was evaluated in a similar manner. Respondents were\nasked to report on the specific sports and exercises from a\nlist of 33 possible activities (e.g., hiking, walking, garden-\ning, yard work, or martial arts). Using the aforementioned\nquestions, respondents were classified as weekend warriors\nif they answered ``yes'' to any of the questions and if they\nreported participating in four to eight sessions of total\nactivity within the 30 d before the interview, for a total of\nQ 600 min per month. We considered this to be equivalent\nto one to two sessions per week and Q 150 minIwkj1 of\nmoderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. To determine\nparticipation in types of activities, data from questions\nabout household and transportation-related activities and\ngardening and yard work that were reported as leisure-time\nphysical activities were combined into household and\ntransportation-related activities (e.g., gardening, yard work,\nheavy cleaning, walking or bicycling for transportation),\nand data from specific sports for either vigorous- or\nmoderate-intensity activities (e.g., jogging, walking) were\ngrouped as sports and exercise-related activities.\nStatistical analysis. To demonstrate the compara-\nbility of the surveys, sample characteristics for weekend\nwarriors were described by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A WEEKEND WARRIOR Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 2007 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

Overall and sex-\nspecific prevalences of weekend warriors were reported\nfrom the BRFSS and the NHANES data.

A greater proportion of\nmen than women participated in sports/exercise-related\nDISCUSSION\nThis study suggests that approximately 1\u00ad3% of U.S.\nadults may be weekend warriors--adults who participate in\nPA patterns that may be equivalent to recommended levels\nin terms of total volume but that are accomplished on 1 or\n2 dIwkj1. The national prevalence was less than expected\nin light of anecdotal evidence suggesting that occupational\nconstraints and lack of leisure time lead to difficulty in\nscheduling physical activity during the workday (12,19).\nAccording to BRFSS data, this pattern of activity is highest\namong those aged 45\u00ad64--an age group that often\nexperiences time constraints from having to care for\nchildren as well as parents, in addition to large occupa-\ntional time requirements.\nIt cannot be determined from these data whether\nthe same volume of PA achieved through infrequent bouts\n(1\u00ad2 dIwkj1) or regular activity (Q 5 dIwkj1) has different\nhealth effects. The estimated energy expenditure for those\nclassified as weekend warriors may be sufficient to confer\nsome of the health benefits of regular PA. We found that\nweekend warriors had an estimated median energy expen-\nsuggest that at least 525 METIminIwkj1 are needed to meet\nPA recommendations for health (e.g., 30 min of moderate\nintensity on five or more days per week). Lee et al.\n(8) found that healthy men who were physically active only\n(equivalent to Q 150 minIwkj1 of moderate-intensity PA)\nhad reduced risk of all-cause mortality compared with\nsedentary men. However, the same study found that men\nwith any risk factors for chronic disease who engaged in\nthis PA pattern did not have a reduced risk of all-cause\nmortality, whereas those whose energy expenditure met the\nrecommendations had a reduced risk of mortality.\nIn our study, we found that a large proportion of weekend\nwarriors participate in household/transportation-related activi-\nties and sports/exercise-related activities. Because studies\nhave shown that household activities such as home repair and\ngardening are associated with health benefits (10,15), and\nbecause these activities are often performed in intermittent\nbouts and on weekends, future research comparing the\nconditioning response and health effects gained from\nhousehold versus leisure-time activity is needed. One study\nfound that engaging in two consecutive days of walking or\nrunning as endurance training for 75 minIdj1 (e.g., weekend\nwarriors) compared with 30 minIdj1 of similar activities\nperformed on 5 d at the same intensity produces a similar\ntraining effect on V\n(12). Although not significant, the\ncumulative training effect was slightly lower for those who\nengaged in more frequent bouts of endurance training for a\nshorter duration than it was for the weekend warriors. Future\nresearch is needed to compare the health benefits gained by\nparticipation in activities of low intensity (e.g., golf) (16)\nversus more strenuous activities (e.g., basketball, yard work)\n(2) among weekend warriors.\nThe results of this analysis are subject to several\nlimitations. First, data from both the BRFSS and NHANES\nare self-reported, and physical activity levels may be\nunderestimated. Additionally, these datasets were not\nspecifically designed to study weekend warrior behavior.\nSecond, the survey questions did not specifically ask\nrespondents to report the actual day(s) of the week they\nengaged in activity (i.e., weekday or weekend); therefore,\nwe conducted the analysis on the basis of the frequency of\nactivity (i.e., 1\u00ad2 dIwkj1; four to eight sessions per month),\nand we cannot verify whether activities were performed on\nthe weekend, or whether multiple activities were per-\nformed on the same day or different days. Moreover,\nthere were different sample frames in the questions used\n(i.e., BRFSS measured times in the past week, and\nNHANES measured times in the past 30 d), which may\nintroduce bias when comparing the surveys. Third, the\nNHANES sample was small, limiting the subgroup\nanalyses that could be performed. Furthermore, NHANES\nasked respondents to report on 23 questions about sports\nand exercise activities, possibly leading to reporting of\nmore PA. Fourth, our computation of MET-minutes per\nweek was based on the absolute MET-value activity codes\nin the compendium of physical activities (1), and we\nclassified total energy expenditure for moderate- and\nvigorous-intensity at the low end of each intensity range\nwithout adjusting for respondents` age. Because many\nactivities can be performed at multiple intensities, respond-\nents could have reported time spent in moderate-intensity\nactivity when light-intensity activity had been performed.\nFIGURE 3--Participation among weekend warriors in household\nand transportation-related activities and sports and exercise\nfour to eight sessions of transportation, household, moderate- and\nvigorous-intensity leisure-time activity (e.g., sports and exercise) in the\npast 30 d, totaling Q 600 min per month. Household and transportation\nactivities refers to respondents reporting that they engaged in one or\nmore of the following activities: household activities reported as\nleisure-time PA (e.g., gardening, yard work), walking/biking for\ntransportation, or moderate-intensity household tasks (e.g., raking\nleaves, mowing the lawn, heavy cleaning). Sports and exercise refers to\nmoderate- or vigorous-intensity leisure-time activity, such as various\nsport activities, or walking for exercise.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A WEEKEND WARRIOR Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 2007 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

Specifically, the NHANES included questions on\nspecific types of activities; this was not part of the BRFSS\nsurvey.\nIn summary, roughly 1\u00ad3% of the U.S. population engages\nin irregular patterns of PA (i.e., 1\u00ad2 dIwkj1) that approxi-\nmate PA recommendations in terms of volume of activity,\nand more men than women have this activity pattern.\nAmong men and women, the distribution of this pattern is\nhighest among those aged 45\u00ad64. The types of PA reported\nby weekend warriors include household and transportation\nactivities, such as gardening, yard work, and sports, or\nexercise. More research is needed to help further describe\nthe activity patterns and trends in these individuals.\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors\nand do not necessarily represent the views of CDC.
