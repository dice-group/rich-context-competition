This has been underscored by recent\nepidemiologic1\u00ad4 and experimental5\u00ad8 evidence supporting increased risks at low expo-\nsure levels. In this context, it is critical to understand the biology and the technical\nlimitations of biomarkers of inorganic arsenic exposure, usually measured in urine.9\u00ad11\nTotal urine arsenic integrates exposure from multiple sources including inorganic (arsen-\nite, arsenate) and organic (mainly arsenobetaine, arsenosugars, and arsenolipids)\narsenic compounds and their metabolites (Fig. 1). In population-based studies, arsenic\nspeciation in urine is important to differentiate inorganic from organic exposure\nbecause organic arsenicals, mostly found in seafood, have little toxicity relative to\ninorganic arsenic and its metabolites. Despite analytic advances in the measurement\nof arsenosugars, arsenolipids, and their metabolites,9 their determination remains\ntechnically challenging in epidemiologic studies. For example, those compounds were\n(NHANES). Moreover, because arsenite, arsenate, and methylarsonate--species that\ndirectly reflect inorganic arsenic exposure and metabolism (Fig. 1)--were measured in\nlarsinate, arsenobetaine and arsenocholine (a minor seafood arsenical) were available\nfor analyses of arsenic and health end points.\nTo evaluate the association of inorganic arsenic exposure with the prevalence of\ncontribution of organic arsenicals of marine origin to total urine arsenic. First, we\nconducted analyses of the association between total urine arsenic and the prevalence\nof type 2 diabetes adjusted for sociodemographic factors, diabetes risk factors, and 2\nmarkers of seafood intake (urine arsenobetaine and blood mercury). More importantly,\nwe reported analyses of the association between total urine arsenic and the prevalence\nof type 2 diabetes adjusted only for sociodemographic and diabetes risk factors but\nrestricted to participants with low arsenobetaine levels (ie, participants with unlikely\nseafood intake, in whom urine arsenic would be derived mainly from inorganic\narsenic). The magnitude of the association in this subgroup was similar to the analysis\nFrom the aDepartment of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; bDepartment of\nEpidemiology, Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health,\nBaltimore, MD; cNational Center for Epidemiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; dCIBER en Epidemiolog\u00eda y Salud Pu\n\u00b4blica (CIBERESP),\nMadrid, Spain; eDepartment of Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Population Genetics, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC),\nMadrid, Spain; and fDepartment of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD.\nEditors' Note: Related articles appear on pages 807 and 821.\nCorrespondence: Ana Navas-Acien, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, 615 N\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins\nadjusting for urine arsenobetaine and blood mercury, dem-\nonstrating that the association between arsenic and type 2\ndiabetes identified in the whole sample was driven by\ninorganic arsenic exposure and was not dependent on the\nstatistical method used to control for organic arsenicals of\nmarine origin.\nIn a reanalysis of the association between arsenic ex-\nissue of EPIDEMIOLOGY, Steinmaus et al15 used total urine\narsenic minus urine arsenobetaine and urine arsenocholine (in\n13 individuals in whom it was detected) as an \"estimate of\ninorganic arsenic exposure,\" in an attempt to remove the\ncontribution of organic arsenicals of marine origin to total\nurine arsenic. Total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and\narsenocholine, however, is an inadequate estimate of inor-\nganic arsenic exposure because it does not remove other\nunmeasured organic arsenicals and their metabolites derived\nfrom seafood. Indeed, the correlation between arsenobetaine\nand total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine\n0.51, Fig. 2). In their Discussion, the authors indicated that\nafter subtracting arsenobetaine and arsenocholine from\ntotal arsenic, 24% of the variance in the remaining arsenic\nwas still explained by arsenobetaine \"probably due to\nsome dimethylarsinate and some other arsenosugars that\nare present in the same seafoods that contain arsenobe-\ntaine.\"15 The magnitude of the misclassification induced\nwhen estimating inorganic arsenic by total urine arsenic\nminus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine in the NHANES\nsample can be further appreciated by comparing the dis-\ntribution of total arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arseno-\ndistribution of total urine arsenic among participants with\n30.4 g/L, respectively). As a consequence, any analysis\nthat uses total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and\narsenocholine as an estimate of inorganic arsenic exposure\nstill needs to adjust for markers of seafood intake, such as\narsenobetaine itself. Furthermore, the misclassification in-\nduced by using total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and\narsenocholine as an index of inorganic arsenic exposure is\naggravated in categorical analyses, for example, quintiles.\nMany participants in the highest quintile (80th percen-\ntile) of total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arseno-\ntial amounts of organic arsenic compounds from seafood,\nand categorization in this situation could reduce the effi-\ncacy of statistical adjustment for seafood intake in multi-\nvariable models.\nGiven the longstanding experience of Steinmaus et al\nin investigating the health effects of arsenic, it is difficult\nto understand why the authors used total urine arsenic\nminus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine as an estimate of\ninorganic arsenic exposure without controlling for seafood\nintake in their main analyses and conclusions. Indeed,\nwhen controlling for seafood intake, Steinmaus et al re-\nFIGURE 1.

Other metabolites of arsenosugars and arsenolip-\nids (thio-arsenic and oxo-arsenic compounds, etc.) were not\nmeasured.

The exclusion criteria and end point defini-\ntion were similar to those in our original paper,2 except for\nparticipants missing glycosylated hemoglobin (an end\ndiabetes) aged 20 years or older were included. Statistical\nanalyses were performed as described previously, taking\ninto account the complex NHANES sampling design and\nspecific weights for arsenic analyses, as recommended by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics.\nMedian (interquartile range) urine concentrations for\ntotal arsenic, total arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arseno-\ncholine (in 21 participants with detectable concentrations),\nparticipants with undetectable (0.4 g/L) arsenobetaine\nconcentrations (n  381), the median (interquartile range)\nTotal arsenic was highly correlated with arsenobetaine\n(r  0.78). Total arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arseno-\ncholine also showed a moderately strong correlation with\narsenobetaine (r  0.50), confirming again that subtracting\narsenobetaine is not sufficient to eliminate the contribution\nof unmeasured organic arsenicals from total urine arsenic.\nWe conducted analyses of total arsenic (as in our\noriginal study2) and total arsenic minus arsenobetaine and\narsenocholine (as in Steinmaus et al15), progressively ad-\njusting for markers of seafood intake (urine arsenobetaine\nand blood mercury). The findings (Table) were similar to\nour original analyses. In the categorical analyses, the\nhighest quintiles of total urine arsenic and total arsenic\nminus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine were not clearly\nassociated with an increased risk of diabetes because,\nrather than high inorganic arsenic, these quintiles mostly\nincluded participants with high intakes of organic arsenic\ncompounds from seafood that are difficult to control for in\nthe analysis.

A total of 11 participants with\nnegative values for total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine were excluded.

The corresponding odds ratio\nfor diabetes comparing the highest versus the lowest quin-\ntiles (80th vs. 20th percentile) of total urine arsenic in\nratio directly estimates the association between exposure\nto inorganic arsenic and the prevalence of diabetes without\nassuming a linear dose-response relationship.\nIn summary, when adequately controlling for mark-\ners of seafood intake, our original analysis2 and those of\nsimilar conclusions. Furthermore, updated findings in\nganic arsenic is associated with the prevalence of diabetes\nin US adults and rule out collinearity as an explanation to\nour findings. As we indicated in our original paper, these\nfindings are inherently limited by the cross-sectional na-\nture of NHANES data. Prospective evidence in popula-\ntions exposed to a wide range of arsenic exposure levels,\nincluding arsenic in drinking water 50 g/L and other\nsources, is clearly needed. We also recognized that the use\nof spot urine samples and the need to account for urine\ndilution are limitations of our data common to many\nepidemiologic studies, and that single urine arsenic mea-\nsures may not reflect long-term arsenic exposure.\nFrom the perspectives of both science and public\nhealth, there can be no question about the need to evaluate\nthe impact of inorganic arsenic exposure on diabetes de-\nvelopment at low to moderate exposure levels (and not\nonly at arsenic levels in drinking water from 50 to 200\ng/L, as Steinmaus et al indicate). First, evidence linking\narsenic with diabetes end points in populations exposed to\nlow1 and moderate16 levels is already available. Second,\nincreasing experimental evidence supports several diabe-\ntogenic mechanisms of arsenic.5,6 Third, low to moderate\narsenic exposure levels are widespread, affecting most\npopulations worldwide. Inorganic arsenic is an established\ncarcinogen and a high priority contaminant for screening\nin drinking water sources.17 Although 10 g/L is the current\nsafety standard for arsenic levels in drinking water in most\ncountries, the World Health Organization indicated that 10\ng/L is a provisional standard because many uncertainties\nremain at low exposure levels, in particular for noncancer end\npoints.17,18 Evaluating these health effects of low to moderate\narsenic exposure is a public health priority. Knowledgeable\nuse of biomarkers of arsenic exposure,10,11 high quality\nlaboratory methods with adequate limits of detection,19\u00ad21\nhigh-quality prospective epidemiologic designs, and adequate\nstatistical analysis techniques are needed to evaluate the\nimpact of low to moderate inorganic arsenic exposure on\ncardiovascular disease and diabetes risk.\nREFERENCES\n1.
