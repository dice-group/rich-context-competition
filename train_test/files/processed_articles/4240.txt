    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe essay examines India's journey from \"colonialism\" to \"post-colonial awareness.\" It also explores the ideals of the Republic\nand their fulfillment as seen in India as a nation founded on the principles of a welfare state. Discussion of three selected texts\nexplores the connections between water management and social welfare to instantiate the obstacles in India's aspirations\nas a functioning welfare state as well as narrativizing resistance built in the interstices of society against caste hegemony and\npower politics. One instance is access to or denial of the life-sustaining element, water. Interestingly, Rabindranath Tagore's\n1922 play Muktadhara/Free Current conveyed a percipient warning about politics of control over water. The chosen texts,\nSarabhai's The Well of the People, Mahasweta Devi's Jal/Water, and Vinodini's Daaham/Thirst, besides highlighting the politics\nof \"hydro power,\" also portray the deep and mystical relationship between water, ecology, and gender. I argue that India as\na welfare state would obviously benefit from gender sensitization of its developmental policies, especially regarding water\nmanagement if women's views are taken into serious consideration.\n",

However, the\njourney appears decidedly longer if one takes into consider-\nation the history of the struggle against imperialism when the\nnation was \"imagined,\" the seeds of nationhood were sown,\nand the concept of the republic took shape. The Indian\nFreedom Struggle raged from 19th century.

From this political condition, an inference is often\ndrawn that only those people who need not struggle for daily\nsubsistence so have sufficient time to spare, become politi-\ncally active. In other words, the wealthy are often seen as the\nclass establishing a republican form of government.\nApprehension of such class-dominated polity was appar-\nent in ideologues like E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker or \"Periyar\"\nagainstAryans, especially Brahmins, and organized the \"Self-\nRespect Movement\" for Dravidian Upliftment; Jyotirao Phule\ndowntrodden and wanted to reconstruct the social order on\nthe basis of social equality and justice for shudras and ati-\nshudras (lowest in caste hierarchy); and Bhimrao Ramji\nand declared that \"it is wrong to say that the problem of the\nuntouchables is a social problem . . . [this] is fundamentally a\npolitical problem of minority versus majority groups\" (1946,\np. 190) and launched a revolutionary movement for the lib-\neration and advancement of Dalits. The Periyar\u00adPhule\u00ad\nAmbedkar thrust represents an effort to ensure a more\ninclusive representation in the political body of the \"imag-\nined\" republic. Perhaps the reluctance of Sir Syed Ahmad\nKhan to join the Congress can be interpreted as minority\ncommunity's fear of majoritarian domination in the formula-\ntion of a nation-state. Thus, one becomes aware of the differ-\nences, complexities, and debates during the Swadeshi\nMovement and the Freedom Struggle which governed the\nconceptualization of the relationship between nation, culture,\nand identity. Sensitive to the political nuances of the time,\nRabindranath Tagore cautioned against ideas built around sin-\ngular identities because, as he explained in his monograph\nNationalism (1917), the social and the national must not be\nregarded as discrete. He emphasized that social composition\ndetermines a nation's republican character. Therefore, the\ntask before the formulators of the Constitution of India would\nbe to create a liberatory document to strengthen and validate\nthe country's heterogeneity by engaging with the issues of\nsocial-cultural inequalities and exclusions, addressing them,\nand thereafter making adequate provisions for their resolution\nin the text of the new Republic.\nSensitivity and experience deriving from the Independence\nMovement framed the Directive Principles of State Policy,\nenshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, defining\nrights, duties, entitlements, and social justice that a welfare\nstate would be committed to providing food, clothing, hous-\ning, education, and medical relief for citizens in need. In\n2009, Supreme Court's directive to guarantee education to all\nand a midday meal to all schoolchildren led to the Right to\nEducation Act being passed. The welfare state could hence be\nexpected to monitor satisfactory outcomes in social policies\nto positively and directly affect overall human development.\nYet, anyone who knows India would immediately inter-\nject that despite social welfare schemes launched by succes-\nsive governments, any social indicator would easily prove\nthat the welfare state model has had a disappointing record in\nterms of implementation of the schemes for the disprivileged\nand marginalized sectors. Problematic management, corrup-\ntion, and/or mismanagement of funds are very often the rea-\nsons for failure. Indeed, as Upamanyu Chatterjee's (2000)\nprotagonist Agastya Sen, an administrative officer in the\nsatirical novel Mammaries of the Welfare State discovers, the\nWelfare State is \"a mystery within and without and getting\nthings done is pretty much last on the list of everyone's pri-\norities,\" reminding one that \"Self-interest is the only com-\nmandment . . . the rest is waffle\" (p. 147).\nAdmittedly, the transformation of latent thought into\nmanifest content is a complex process, but what could pos-\nsibly cause such mismatch between the vision of a well-\nmeaning republic and the reality of the life of its citizens?\nThis essay attempts to read three texts which span the colo-\nnial and the \"postcolonial\" divide to emphasize that the pas-\nsage is not an unproblematic one. The colonial times have\npassed but neo-colonial practices of subjugation and denial\nremain. The texts appear distant from each other--one writ-\nten in English and published in 1943, another written in\nBengali and published in 1986, the third in Telugu appeared\nin 2005. Yet, they seem to reflect each other's words/worlds\nand together instantiate sociohistorical continuities and\ncoherence. In Mikhail Bakhtin's (1986) words,\nThe text lives only when it comes into contact with another text\n(with context). Only at this point of contact between texts does a\nlight flash . . . joining a given text in a dialogue. We emphasize\nthat this is a dialogic contact between texts. . . (p. 162)\nThese texts are explored through the lens of gender and\ncaste with the hope of finding some answers about the mili-\ntating issues in the colliding zones of their dialogic contact.\nThe comparative perspective suggested here is founded upon\nthe conception of social life as discursively constituted, pro-\nduced, and reproduced in situated acts of speaking and other\nsignifying practices or utterances.\nThe first text, Bharati Sarabhai's (1943) The Well of the\nPeople, a verse drama published in 1943, is accorded a spe-\ncial place in the literary history of India as the first play writ-\nten in English by a woman. She explains the play was\ninspired by her experience of the Haridwar kumbh mela in\nthe spring of 1938 with its \"phenomenal gathering of people\"\n(1) and a true incident reported in the journal Harijan about\nan old village woman. Sarabhai is a Gandhian and like emi-\nnent novelists Bhabani Bhattacharya and Mulk Raj Anand\nallows her faith in the Gandhian principles of self-truth, self-\nreliance, and service to permeate her writing. The text bears\nthe mark of the colonial yoke very clearly. The second text,\nMahasweta Devi's (1997 rpt) play Jal or Water, published in\nplicated relationship of the mainstream and the marginalized\n\"untouchable dome\" community and its many deprivations\nthrough the machinations of the \"empowered\" when their\nMukherjee 3\ncaste is threatened by the \"untouchable\" Maghai Dome\nknown as a water-diviner. He is summoned by the upper\ncaste to trace water, but once the subterranean stream is\nlocated and a well is dug, his caste is not allowed to draw\nwater from it for fear of pollution as they eat \"fowl and pigs.\"\nThe third text, Vinodini's (2005) Daaham meaning Thirst, a\nTelugu play published in translation in 2005, is accorded a\nspecial place in Indian literary history being among the first\nplays written by a Dalit woman. Vinodini is a social activist\nand her activism lends power to the language of daily usage\ndeployed in the play to depict the deprivations and oppres-\nsion of the downtrodden Dalit. The text interrogates India's\nclaim of being a \"postcolonial\" state when internal coloniza-\ntion and \"neo-colonial\" mind-set prevails.\nNotably, the three texts share another significant feature: the\nrole of life-generating element \"water\" manipulated and con-\ntrolled as an instrument of oppression, hinting at future machi-\nnations of the politics of hydropower (see Baruah, 2012). The\ntexts suggest a deep, almost metaphysical, relationship of water\nwith women and this bonding acquires a gendered subalternity.\nAlthough subalternity is associated with the lowest socioeco-\nnomic classes and castes, the texts depict the social role of\nwomen under patriarchy that relegates all classes of women to\nsubalternity. Theorists of subaltern studies like Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak and Ranajit Guha note that the treatment\nof gender often transcend class/caste, especially regarding\ncommon concerns such as water, food, shelter, security, and\nexperience of violence. The trans-class/caste awareness makes\ngender evident in various ways. Most significantly for this\nessay, the selected texts emphasize the connections between\ngender and water as complex, multifaceted, and heterogeneous\nreflected in the struggles of those living in the interstices of the\nwelfare state. Invariably in India as elsewhere, activism for\nenvironmental and water conservation has been led by women,\nfor instance, the Chipko Movement, Silent Valley and Save the\nForest Movements, Navadanya and Aranyani Movements in\nIndia--all for what Vandana Shiva (1988) calls \"reclaiming\nTerra Mater\" (p. 218) toward well-being of all. On March 26,\n1986, activist Medha Patkar who motivated Narmada Bachao\nAndolan (Save River Narmada Movement) was arrested for\nprotesting against Narmada Control Authority's decision to\nraise the height of Sardar Sarovar dam without rehabilitating\nthe displaced villagers. The two dams--Sardar Sarover and\npeasants and tribals, and could cause immense ecological dam-\nage through the inundation of forests, including prime habitats\nof rare species. There were also doubts, drawn from the experi-\nence of dams elsewhere in the country like the Koyna-Morvi\ndisaster, protests against Kabini dam in Karnataka, Tehri dam\nin Garhwal, Koel-Karo dam in Jharkhand, whether the dams\nwould fulfill their projected benefits of hydropower, irrigation,\nand drinking water. It was widely feared that this project could\nalso become a human and ecological \"development disaster.\"1\nIndia's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru is often cited for\ndescribing dams as \"temples of modern India\" necessary for\nthe country's economic growth. Yet, it is Nehru who in 1958\nrescinded his view and referred to such projects as \"disease of\nThis essay does not intend a judgmental stance on the\nNarmada agitation nor the success of the project but aims to\nhighlight the discourse generated on the notion of \"develop-\nment\" (as a Western paradigm and value) that could become\n\"destructive\" for pushing reckless \"progress\" as has been\ndiscussed for instance by Michael Jacobs (1999) in his essay\non \"Sustainable Development as Contested Concept\" (pp.\n21-45). A grassroots-level activity to harmoniously integrate\nlocal communities and habitat could be far more beneficial\nand effective. The issue drew nationwide attention to the role\nof res publica premised on an egalitarian society ensuring\nwelfare of all sections of the people without prejudice or\nbias. In Medha Patkar's words,\nIf the vast majority of our population is to be fed and clothed, then\na balanced vision with our own priorities in place of the Western\nmodelsisamust.Thereisnootherwaybuttoredefine\"modernity\"\nand the goals of development, to widen it to a sustainable, just\nsociety based on harmonious, non-exploitative relationships\nbetween human beings and between people and nature. (http://\nwww.rightlivelihoodaward.org/speech/acceptance-speech-\nmedha-patkar-and-baba-amte-narmada-bachao-andolan)\nEchoing such sentiments, Vandana Shiva emphasizes the\nrole women can and should play in water management. She\nwrites in her discussion of \"Women and theVanishingWaters\"\nWater management has been transformed from the management\nof an integrated water cycle by those who participate in it,\nparticularly women, into the exploitation of water with dams,\nreservoirs and canals by experts and technocrats in remote\nplaces, with masculinist minds . . . the masculinist mind, by\nwanting to tame and control every river in ignorance of nature's\nways, is in fact sowing the seeds of large scale desertification\nAlthough the knowledge gained through research and\npraxis is yet to enter and enrich public discourse in a notewor-\nthy way, critiques of the conventional water management\nmethods, particularly with regard to environmental/ecological\nvalues, are becoming louder. Indeed, while women as \"water\nexperts\" (p. 197) often have primary and informal responsibil-\nity of managing water in many societies, men tend to wield\ngreater control over water use, and are often overrepresented\nin formal decision-making bodies associated with farming,\nfishing, and other agricultural activities. In areas where wom-\nen's roles or the impact upon them are more tangible, such as\nriver basins and catchment management, or climate change or\nsudden environmental changes, gender issues associated with\nwater resources have received relatively more attention.\nAs has been argued by Ruth Menzein-Dick and Margreet\nZwarteveen (1998) in their essay on \"Gender Participation\n4 SAGE Open\nand Water Management,\" \"it is problematic to assume the\nexistence of a `natural' (or essentialist) relation between\nwomen and nature . . . and requires thinking across and\nbeyond stereotype bipolar hierarchies\" (p. 176). However,\nthey also acknowledge that examined empirically \"the links\nbetween gender and community have direct consequences\nfor the efficiency and sustainability of natural resources as\nwell as for the livelihoods of people who depend on those\nresources\" (p. 176) and can be achieved at substantial levels\nby female participation. Several streams of thought tracking\nfuture trajectories of feminist explorations as, for example,\nthe loosely defined term hydrofeminism have nuanced think-\ning about the closeness of gender and water, while eschew-\ning the essentializing tendency of biological or reproductive\nmorphology (for theorization of \"hydrofeminism,\" see\nNeimanis, 2012). Required is a gradual and increasing need\nfor participation in people-friendly sustainable and gender-\njust projects. The obvious benefit is sensitization to the ear-\nlier gender-blindness of water development discourses and\npractices, as the matter of women's participation in policies\nregarding water management. At the level of policy formula-\ntion, the Dublin Statement on Water and the Environment\nadopted the following:\nPrinciple No. 3--Women play a central part in the provision,\nmanagement and safeguarding of water . . . Acceptance and\nimplementation of this principle require positive policies to\naddress women's specific needs and to equip and empower\nwomen to participate at all levels in water resources programs,\nincluding decision-making and implementation, in ways defined\nby them. (ICWE 1992:4 cited by Menzein-Dick and Zwarteveen,\nIndeed, making \"gender\" a central concern in water man-\nagement in the so-called \"developing nations\" is a critical\nneed. The useful roles women can play in managing the eco-\nnomic infrastructure both within and outside the homestead,\ndealing with water-related matters, are being acknowledged\nas a welcome contrast to the way gender distinctions under-\nvalued women's work, contributions, and knowledge. In\nIndia, drawing and saving water and performing water-\nrelated chores pose daily challenges for women who act as\ninformal but primary water managers, carriers, end-users,\nand family health educators. Women also play significant\nrole in water management outside the household as in agri-\nculture (household gardens and laboring), irrigation, fishing,\nand other forms of water-based economic activities, and the\nconservation of water in general. Water is used in highly\ngender-specific ways in rural and urban societies, at home\nand in farms, for food processing and local cottage indus-\ntries. Women often develop considerable understanding\nabout water; its availability, quality, and reliability; its\nrestrictions; and acceptable storage methods through the\nroles they perform in daily activities. Such knowledge can be\nutilized or prioritized while making plans for water utiliza-\ntion. In her illuminating essay titled \"Gendered Water,\nPoisoned Wells,\" Farhana Sultana (2006) highlights the\ndeeply inflected \"socio-ecological relationships\" (pp. 363-\n364) of women especially with rivers and other sources and\nbodies of water which would be enriched by their views on\npolicy matters on water management and related impacts.\nShe bemoans that \"gender and water literature does not ade-\nquately deal with the role of the state and other powerful\nagents of development\" (p. 366). Indeed, such a discourse is\nyet to acquire the seriousness it deserves.\nThe three texts taken up for discussion probe the relation-\nship between individuals and society, more specifically, exam-\nine welfare measures for catering to basic human needs\nthrough the lens of gender and caste. Interestingly, all three\ntexts highlight women's grasp of the social agency of \"water\"\nas a practical welfare indicator. The masculinist nature of\nknowledge and understanding of \"water\" is problematized as\nis the nature of gender-neutral scholarship on the subject.\nSarabhai imagines India in terms of its multitudes and presents\nthe panorama of Haridwar and Varanasi river-front against the\nbackdrop of the Himalayas. River Ganga that came down as\nan answer to Bhagirath's prayers in mythic times and contin-\nues to succor people of the cities and towns that crowd her\nbanks and millions of pilgrims who worship her daily is pre-\nsented as symbolizing \"the confluence of time\" (16)\nthe river of India, beloved of her people, round which are\nintertwined her memories, her hopes and fears, her songs of\ntriumph, her victories and her defeats . . . a symbol of India's\nage-long culture and civilization, ever changing, ever flowing,\nand yet ever the same Ganga. (51)\nI see India with the accumulations of different and heavily\ndeveloped civilizations . . . Full cycles of cultural entities turn\nand dip, fall and rise again in time which is continuous like the\nGanga . . . the many steps of synthesis and the burden, accepted\nby her naturally, without bitterness and without opposition, as\nthe season of old age approaching the stages of life is assimilated\nby women of this country. (Preface, 4)\nFrom this central symbol of hoary multilayered civiliza-\ntion emerge both the structure and the theme of the play (2).\nWith the movement of the river and the stasis of the Himalaya\nframing it, a choric mood is aroused as the play opens at\nHaridwar teeming with pilgrims, and returns to it coda-like\nat the end. In the interim, action shifts to a village where a\nconflict--the \"struggle between the traditional devotee and\nthe practical unconscious mystic\" (9)--is acted out.\nThe opening scene shows the river glimmering in the twi-\nlight. A temple adorned with golden pitchers is visible on its\nbank and the Himalayas tower in the background. This is the\npicturesque Rishikesh where Ganga reaches the plains to\nbegin her long journey through the northern expanse.\nMidstage holds a cyclorama of shadowy figures of old\nwomen--ancient, huddling forward, seated at a loom. These\nMukherjee 5\nshadowy figures form the Chorus (9) filling the narrative\ngaps in the drama. Three young persons, Chetan, Sanatan,\nand Vichitra, stand in the foreground gazing at the river and\nthe cyclorama. The metaphorical naming of the characters as\nChetan (consciousness), Sanatan (hoary), and Vichitra (vari-\nety) emphasize the coexisting aspects of Indian culture. They\nare enthusiastic \"national worker volunteers\" (23) and serve\nas catalysts for the essential argument embodied in the play.\nCued by Vichitra, the Chorus begins the graphic and evoca-\ntive recital of the different kinds of people from across the\ncountry crowding the banks of Ganga, importuning her\ngrace, immersing themselves, worshipping the life-nurturing\nwaters so \"the sacred river become(s) a bed for all, enough a\nbundle and a pitcher\" (11). Foreshadowing the dramatic\ndevelopment, an old woman appears:\nFixed in aloofness she is--an aged woman\nHolding her own in day's trumpeting crowd,\nHerself an island truncated on edge . . . a pebble forgotten\nSafe on the side. (13)\nThe figure of the old woman influences the ethos of the play\nfrom the very beginning, with the opening cyclorama. Who is\nthis woman, they wonder; is this \"she for whom we work and\nlive?\" (15) (a suggestion of \"Bharat Mata\" in pre-Independence\nIndia)? They learn she is left behind in the village because she\ndid not have enough money and later was too old to accompany\nthe villagers on pilgrimage. They also wonder what these pil-\ngrims hope to attain by looking into the \"maya kunda\" (the\npool of illusion) (51) that they readily sell their belongings to\nreach the banks of Sur Ganga? (17). Echoing the wisdom of\nages, a sonorous Voice appeals to the \"sleeping souls\":\nWhy do you go to Haridwar, to Kashi Varanasi,\nO my soul, when I am within?\nPilgrim, pilgrim why, what is it you seek outside? . . .\nThere is nothing but water at your holy bathing places . . .\nThe golden antelope runs on seeking; the priceless\nmusk laughs, laughs within.\nThe bee in a cave of the petal's vermilion;\nfragrance donning her anklet flies . . .\nSays Kabir, the weaver of Benares . . .\ndear sadhu, I laugh when I hear that the fish in water is thirsty.\nTwilight changes to daylight, indicating the passage of\ntime. Pilgrims return home and the scene shifts to their vil-\nlages. Nothing is changed; life goes on as before, showing\ngrim circumstances of living and the struggle for survival.\nThe villagers remain a collective--unnamed and amorphous.\nBut in their song is encapsulated the history of the people who\nwere born in a land of plenty but were slowly pulverized \"like\nblades of flower before a mower\" (25) into poverty and pow-\nerlessness first by oppressors among themselves and then by\nthe exploitative colonizer the British, \"the new usurer, trader,\ncollector, administrator\" (26). Bearing the message of change\ncame Gandhi into their midst. He appealed to them to be self-\nsufficient and to look at themselves through his eyes:\nHe gave his eyes to them that day. Their eyes\nBlinded with pain saw the Hindu outcaste\nHarijan, banned of man, like lonely chatak\n(The rain-thirsty eternally thirsty bird),\nCrying for water of equal men. (43)\nThe young and the old were enthused by Gandhi's call for\nfreedom and equality and like Sanatan, Chetan and Vichitra\njoin his programs for village upliftment. The old woman\ninspired by Gandhi's message, embraced the outcaste chil-\ndren. She sat at her loom, wove cloth, and saved money for a\npilgrimage to Benares. Her story is narrated by the Workers\nIt is now time we speak for her whose life\nWas dumb. She is you, you and all of us . . . (33)\nShe is Rani and has worked with them for 20 years,\n\"Come late at end of each long day and stand/Upon twilight\nthat winds her cowdust through/The scattering basket of sun-\nset harvest\" (33). She came from Madhubani in Bihar, a\nbeautiful girl of the Maithili Brahmins who marry their\ndaughters young. It was said that it was not unusual to see\nwhole village of widows--the result of child brides married\nto much older men. Rani too was a child widow who lost her\nrelatives and was left to fend for herself. In her blood was the\nart of weaving and she sat at her spinning wheel, \"her body\nwaning miniature like shadow cast/by candle light\" (36)\n(noteworthy is charkha or the spinning wheel as the Gandhian\nsymbol of self-reliance). And thus, \"She went on living. She\nlived to set apart/Crystal from rock, gold from dross . . .\"\n(36). She saved money--shining silver coins, imagined her-\nself \"a pilgrim star upon the western end of life,\" each coin a\nstep \"On the path to golden walled God-appareled temple of\nBenares/Lotus seat of Tathagata at Sarnath . . . \" (36), as\nthrough her pilgrimage, her husband, and ancestors will\n6 SAGE Open\nattain salvation (37). But when she saved enough, she had a\nbroken leg. No pilgrim group would take her along, \"Not\neven for life's money? She wept, she begged, she promised.\nAll her love/Was it enough?--No, it was not enough\" (37).\nAs Chetan, Vichitra, and Sanatan listen to her story, the old\nwoman enters, mutters as though alone: \"I could not go\"--\n(39) . . . then declares: \"I want to build a temple well!\" Adds,\nI may not see Benares. God does not\nPush a sick vessel like this body to\nEach port of earthly pilgrimage, always\nTo stop and fill, still stop and fill to full . . .\nBut my soul, my free swan, can bring inland\nOn a small well, with water pure as\nMother Ganga, the merit lost. . . .\nBefore I die, people who pray may drink\nAt my well . . . (41)\nRani acquires agency. No longer a seeker of illusory ben-\nefits from a pilgrimage to Ganga, she is instrumental in\nbringing Ganga to her village, thus changing the condition of\nlife of the villagers. Through self-realization, instead of seek-\ning personal salvation she arranges \"salvation\" for her peo-\nple and her enterprise becomes the meaningful legacy for\nposterity. Her words resonate through the final lines of the\nplay to uphold the idea of Ganga as prakriti/nature and\nshakti/power--the two facets of femaleness now synony-\nmous with the old woman who, in trying to build a well,\nwould actually enable the subterranean stream (Ganga) to\nrise to the surface for people's welfare. W. T. S Thakara\n(1994) comments on how rivers are regarded in India:\n. . . They (the rivers) evoke an image of spiritual-intellectual\nenergies cascading through the manifold planes of cosmic and\nindividual life, linking us intimately with our spiritual source,\nnourishing and sustaining us, and flowing forth to connect us\nwith all things . . . For sacred rivers are not only mythic reminders\nof forgotten truth, they represent the ever-present stream of who\nand what we essentially are: not a static being, but a dynamic\never-becoming flow of godlike radiance . . . (http://www.nw.org/\ntheosnw/world/general/my-wtst1.htm)\nThe closing lines of the play seem to echo such senti-\nments: \"O how/Great India's torrent has been turned outward\nfrom/Lonely river and mountain!\" (48), when, reflective of\nthe message of truth that rivers carry, the individual wish (the\nold woman's lifelong wish to go on a Ganga pilgrimage) is\nsubsumed by her realization of the need of the many--a well\nfor the village.\nSarabhai's play also makes apparent a dialectical representa-\ntion of the nature\u00adhuman relationship. Although autonomous\nnature exists outside human endeavor, human agency tries to\ncontrol nature ostensibly for \"larger good\" often exacerbating\ndisaster. It is worth noting that politics over control of water is\ngaining ground with the grim awareness that future wars may be\nfought for water. In this context, a fascinating intertextual refer-\nence is Rabindranath Tagore's remarkable play Muktadhara\n[Free Current] which also highlights a conflict, the struggle\nbetween tyrannical power and collective welfare, a text Sarabhai\nmay have read. Tagore's 1922 play anticipates with uncanny\nperspicuity how water management could become a key to\npower relations and social and political dispute, as has become\nincreasingly evident in contemporary times. The concern with\nwater is not new. Hindu sacred texts, the Vedas, describe Indra\ndefeatingVritra, a demon, who held back the river waters behind\nstone dams. Water, beyond its practical use as commodity, also\nsuggests a complicated set of cultural values which makes it a\nmultivocal symbol (Turner, 1974) and can absorb within it\nmany references and unites them into a single cognitive and\naffective field which can propel social action. A multilayered\nand a deeply symbolical text, Muktadhara's plot revolves\naround the harnessing of a river at higher altitude of Uttarakut\nby its king planning to dominate the people of Shivtarai by con-\ntrolling the flow of the water into their valley. He intends to use\nthe water for other purposes. In a stark contrast to the Nehruvian\nidealized metaphor of river dam as a \"temple of progress,\"\nTagore presents it as a menacing machine that is antinature and\nantifreedom, of controlling nature and dominating the land-\nscape, and susceptible to the ideas of oppression and despotism.\nReflecting an understanding of a typically colonial enterprise,\nKuntala Lahiri-Dutt (2006) writes in her essay on \"Nadi O Nari:\nRepresenting the River and Women\":\n. . . Instead of treating the rivers as avenues of prosperity, the\ncolonial notion was to control them, treating the rise and fall of\ntheir waters as aberrant and uncivil. By the end of nineteenth\ncentury, the idea of transforming rivers into natural engines to\ndrive the machines of the industrial world had transplanted itself\non the muddy and sticky soils of the delta . . . The colonial vision\nof rivers did indicate an understanding of the rivers' power, but\nalso demonstrated that they were being utilized to no conceivable\nend, and were unprofitable to them. (388)\nTagore's play opens with the impending imprisonment of\nthe prince for being sympathetic toward the oppressed peo-\nple of the valley. Shivtarai people are restive but lack the\ninitiative for open revolt. Into the crisis enters the enigmatic\nDhananjay Bairagi, a mendicant and minstrel, a free spirit\nwho bows to no bondage. He comes with a song on his lips:\nI shall sail the seas of injury\nthrough the terrible storms\nin my fear-dispelling little boat . . . [translation: mine]\nMukherjee 7\nBairagi's inspiring leadership and clarion call for freedom\ncombined with Prince Abhijit's spirit of sacrifice propel the\npopular uprising against oppression. Bairagi's advice that\n\"waves do not subside when one hits them; one must hold the\nstern of the boat with firm hands to steer it through the tem-\npest\" is obviously a call to fight all forms of hegemony and\nestablish social-political conditions to ensure the well-being\nof the larger populace.\nThat colonialism did not--and has not--disappeared\nwith the departure of the British from India is demonstrated\nby the two texts: Mahasweta devi's Jal and Vinodini's\nDaaham. The plots of the plays are similar and derive from\ncontextualized indigenous domains. Both recount stories of\ndiscrimination and denial of basic human necessities as food\nand water suffered by the so-called casteless/untouchable\npeople. The poor and untouchable Dalits are used as labor to\ndig wells for the rich upper castes but are refused access to\nthe same. The plays portray the interstices of social life and\nthe failures of the welfare programs of a republic. Devi's\nplay Jal is set in village Charsa named for the river flowing\nby it. The river overflows every monsoon, yet the untouch-\nables--Domes, Chamars, and Chandals--experience severe\nshortage during dry seasons every year as there is neither\nwater storage nor other water bodies they can access. Many\ndie as the relief material sent by the government is stolen by\nthe village headman Santosh. Additional worry is police sor-\nties pursuing escaped Naxalites. The police camps in the\narea despite Santosh's assurance that there is no trouble\nexcept the untouchables clamoring for water. Exhausted\nwith their daily struggle for water and food supplies, villag-\ners demand to be allowed to draw water from the Panchayat\nwell or dig another well. They are refused both. The women\ndeclare:\nPhulmani: Daughters, mothers, sisters! Let's go and beg from\nour co-wife, the river.\nFirst woman: Is the river Charsa your co-wife?\nPhulmani (in a dry wail): My co-wife! . . . The river's a woman,\nshe feels for us, that's why she yields water . . . Come sisters let's\npray for water. . . .\nWomen: [singing] Give us water!\nWater, water, water!\nThe sky drips with molten fire.\nThe land gasps for water\nRivers in India (as in other ancient cultures) are configured\nas feminine, are given feminine identities, and are treated as\npotent symbols of power and fecundity, at once hope-giving\nand nourishing or terrifying and destructive. The river-bed is\nlike a womb that can generate and revive life. Rivers in flood\nsweep away villages, and are worshipped and feared. Bengali\nliterature begotten of riverine imaginary is replete with such\ngenderedmetaphorsoftheriver(e.g.,ManikBandyopadhyay's\nPadma Nadir Majhi; Adwaita Mallabarman's Titash ekti\nNadir Naam; Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay's Hansuli Banker\nUpakatha; Samaresh Basu's Ganga etc.).An intriguing image\nprovided by Tarashankar is of the river as unruly and wild like\na low-caste girl:\n. . . From the beginning of the monsoons, the motherless young\ngirl grows up. Her body fills up with youthfulness. Then\nsuddenly one day she turns into a witch. Like one of the low\ncaste, a Kahar girl, suddenly turning savage, shouts at her\nparents, family and neighbours and leaves home, her hair flaring\naround her face, her clothes disheveled, roaming the village\nstreets, spreading fire with her eyes, running amok . . . Again,\ntwo or four days later, she calms down within her banks, just as\nthe Kahar girl comes back home, singing a tune. (cited in Lahiri-\nAs Lahiri-Dutt explains, the wild behavior of the river\nreflecting the free living style of the lower class adds to the\ngendering of the river and the nuances of caste, class, and\nbehavioral codes. Similarly, the image of River Charsa\ninvoked in Jal is of such a free woman, often described as a\nseductive and flirtatious whore. Maghai Dome, the water-\ndiviner, possessing intuitive power to locate the subterranean\nstream prides himself as the descendant of \"Bhagirath of the\nnether-Ganga\" (the mythical sage who summoned Ganga\nupon Earth with his penances) and recounts the story of Earth\nhiding a portion of Ganga in her womb that can be coaxed to\nthe surface only in response to the summons of the mythical\nBhagirath's descendants:\nMaghai: The water lies captive deep down till it gushes out at\nMother's bidding\nO water, to whom do you belong?\nI belong to him who knows how to call me.\nNow who calls you?\nIt's Maghai who calls me.\nAnd who's Maghai?\nHe's slave to the one who keeps me slave.\nWhose bidding is it?\nIt's the bidding of the Mother, the nether Ganga. . . . (116)\nMaghai nurtures lifelong love for River Charsa as the\nmanifestation of nether Ganga. When the rains come and\nCharsa is in spate, Maghai stands entranced upon her bank:\n8 SAGE Open\nMaghai: . . . how gloriously beautiful you appear my Charsa!\nYes my girl, go dancing all the way, dance, dance, ah, my darling\nlife blood!\n. . . Such a beautiful wench, in the monsoons of June and July\nshe breaks across the banks, she laughs with bursts of flood,\nCharsa the youthful river . . . Dhura's mother is right. You're a\nwhore, a fallen woman. In the summer months when I scrape at\nyour breasts how you flirt with me. You sing to me: The water\nwon't be easy to get, I've kept the water hidden deep under.\nYou've to scratch at my breasts before I let it loose not to you but\nyour wife and daughters. . . . (125)\nThe village schoolteacher Jiten finds Maghai talking to\nthe river. Jiten suggests they dam the excess flood water for\nuse through the year. The villagers, convinced of the good\nsense, build the dam to store excess flood water soon find to\ntheir delight a fine tank of water for their use. Maghai\nannounces that Jiten's empathy and concern made him one of\nthem:\nMaghai: . . . You became a Dome when you found us threatened.\nYou became a Dome when you took up the issue of our school.\nYou became a Dome when you gave us the dam . . . The dam is\nthe proof that you are the true Bhagirath of the holy mother, the\nnether Ganga. I've divined water but I've not been able to give\na drop to my mothers, sons, fathers, brothers. The dam that\nyou've given us will quench the thirst of all my people. (135)\nAcknowledging Jiten as the \"true Bhagirath,\" Maghai\ncaricatures his own posturing and vanity as the water-diviner.\nHe expresses deep regret for not appreciating the river's\nbounty despite his love for her. He finally understands the\nriver had always been available to them as a perennial water\nsource. He is ashamed for betraying her love by calling her a\nwhore whose love is short-lived or seasonal. Maghai and his\npeople also realize the importance of self-help instead of\ndepending on charity of the so-called relief dispensers of the\nState.\nThe crisis of the play grows out of upper caste fear of the\nDomes becoming self-reliant, the threat that by managing\nnatural resources they can challenge the game of power. So,\nthey collude with the police and attack the village, ostensibly\nstaging a Naxalite \"encounter.\" Their anger is directed at\nJiten for supporting the Domes. Jiten is hit in the head by the\nbutt of a gun during the fight and Maghai trying to save him\nis fatally shot. The waters of Charsa roar in flood and the\ndam breaks. People watch in awe as the river sweeps Maghai\naway.\nLike Jal, Vinodini's Daaham/Thirst is a poignant repre-\nsentation of the daily struggles of the untouchable/Dalit for\nsurvival without food and water. A Dalit Mala community\nresides at the village periphery and ekes out life in dire pov-\nerty, oppression, and exploitation, discriminated against by\nthe prosperous upper caste. The play opens as Souramma\nreturns home beaten by upper caste women when unable to\nbear thirst any longer she \"dared\" to go to the village well to\ndraw water. Souramma reports:\n. . . I went in the morning with the pitcher and stood near the\nwell. Not even a single bitch gave me water. It was getting late.\nMy legs ached. How long could I wait? I asked every woman\nwho came to the well . . . amma, pour one pitcher of water into\nmy vessel . . . I pleaded with them . . . not even a single bitch\nlistened to my pleas. The sun was scorching. I couldn't stop\nmyself. I went up to the well and tied the rope, that's all. Then all\nof them came running, broke my pitcher, pulled me down from\nthe well and beat me up. (493)\nAlthough Dalit labor is used to dig wells, the \"polluted\"\nDalits are not allowed to even touch the pulley to draw water.\nSouramma's act becomes a serious breach of social norm. To\nmaintain the oppressive exploitative hierarchy and prevent\nthe recurrence of such incidents which might give the Dalits\nideas about \"equality\" and \"rights,\" it is imperative that such\naction is immediately and harshly suppressed. Dasu is\nshocked to learn that killing Dalits perceived as rebellious\nnonconformists is not uncommon and has been resorted to\nbefore. Dasu's uncle who was a fearless social rebel had been\nthus dispensed with. The issue escalates. There is lot of dis-\ncussion as to what course of action should be taken in\nresponse to the summons of Pedda Reddy, the upper caste\nvillage headman and leader of Panchayat.Adivision becomes\napparent among the Malapalli Dalits. While the group of\nelders is cautious and fearful, subservient and obsequious in\nattitude, the group comprising younger generation Dalits\nsome of whom are educated is unwilling to tolerate any form\nof unfair dominance. Present in the latter group are women\nwhose daily struggles have pushed them to the limit of for-\nbearance. The second group resolves not to succumb to any\nabuse or threat and assumes an aggressive stance to demand\nequal rights to natural resources.\nWhen the Dalits come to the village center for the meet-\ning, Souramma's son Dasu identifies himself as the new\nspokesperson of the Malas instead of the Elder Pedda Mala\nas was the earlier custom. The upper caste village headman\nPedda Reddy demands that Dalits pay a fine of 10,000 rupees\nbecause Mala Souri broke the norm and touched the pulley\nof the well. Her act is a grievous one because as a conse-\nquence, Ganga has been polluted and might recede and cause\nthe well to dry up. Mala youth are not intimidated by threats\nnor accept such reasons. They refuse to pay the fine and\nanswer every abuse and threat with collective aggression.\nThey argue that Ganga answered their call and rose to the\nsurface when they dug the well, why should she disappear\nnow? Amid heated exchange, a maid from the landlord's\nhouse comes to urgently summon Gangi who has been\nbreastfeeding Younger Reddy's newborn son as the mother's\nbreasts had not yielded any milk. Despite much pleading,\nGangi refuses to go until their problem is resolved. Dalits\nreact strongly to Younger Reddy charges:\nMukherjee 9\nVenkata Reddy: (To Gangi's husband) You fellows, are you\nhuman beings or what? See, you don't allow Gangi to go though\nthe child is suffering. And you talk of morals, morals!\nPrasad: Your child, one child, born day before yesterday . . .\nmakes you feel so bad when he cries for milk. Were you bothered\never when so many of us along with our children thirsted for a\nlittle drinking water? Not one day but for years altogether? Did\nyou think of us or our babies even once?\nPushpamma: We served food for our children and waited for\nhours near the well for one pitcher of water and that nobody\nfrom your caste had the time to pour. And nobody gave water,\nwe went home with empty pitchers. How many times we were\nbeaten up by our husbands for not getting water to drink? Did\nyou feel for us when our throats were dry? . . . When you didn't\ngive water we walked ten miles and brought dirty water from\npuddles--the bathing water for dogs, pigs and cattle--and drank\nThe Domes of Charsa built a dam to solve their water\nproblems, the Malas of Malapalli demand their right to use\nthe village well which they had dug. Replicating the practices\nof a capitalist state instead of a social welfare state that India's\nrepublican ideals vouchsafe, Dalits, subalterns, and the poor\nare exploited as labor and/or commodities--for hard labor or\nfor breastfeeding the babies of the rich (a memorable text\nexemplifying this is Mahasweta devi's \"Stanadayini\"/The\nBreastgiver) yet are denied the fruit of their labor, are dis-\ncriminated against and forced to accept unequal and arbitrary\ncaste/class rules. Hence, when basic amenities are appropri-\nated by a section of the people to deny others, it is time for the\ndistressed to acquire agency and recall the Gandhian mantra\nof collective dissent and noncooperation to be able to shape\nand protect their future. Thus, to quench the \"thirst\" of the\nReddy baby, the rich and the powerful of the village are forced\nto acquiesce the Dalit demand for the use of the well water to\nquench the \"thirst\" of their community.\nIt is significant that the dominating image that all the texts\ncarry is that of \"water\" in relation to human life: as the agent\nof purification and life-sustaining element. The texts also\nemphasize the close yet practical relationship of women with\nwater. While the old woman wants a well for the people,\nDalit women want to access the wells their men have dug.\nAlso made apparent in the three plays, as in the play by\nTagore, is the perception and use of water as socially con-\nstructed with cultural implications, which in turn determine\nthe way water politics can operate in different contexts,\nrevealing the relationship between those who use it and those\nwho supply/control it. Emphasizing this point, Lahiri-Dutt\n(2006) writes that water is \"subjectively constructed, or `pro-\nduced' like any other element of nature; a part of the cultural\nlandscape, rooted in history, both the producer and product\nof the material culture through which human agency is\nenacted\" (p. xvii). Evidently, as reflected in the texts, the\nclosest relationship water has (itself \"gendered\") is with\nwomen, the archetypal water carriers, and validated as such\nthrough symbols and icons. This is especially true of the\nThird World societies where the burden of household chores\nand the responsibility of fetching and carrying water often\nfrom distances rest upon women. Using water and perform-\ning water-related chores constitute a daily challenge for\nwomen who thus become \"informal but primary water man-\nagers, water carriers, end-users and family health educators\"\n(Lahiri-Dutt, 2006, p. xx). Thereby, women gain consider-\nable knowledge and insights about availability, quality, and\nstorage of water. As argued above, policy planning for water\nresource development and management would greatly bene-\nfit with the participation of women.\nTogether, the texts record the complexity of human life\nimplicated in \"developmental\" history. Such \"histories\" have\nrendered the project of nation-state governance particularly\nopen to counter representations and resistance. Yet, regretta-\nbly, such discourses do not appear to occupy the mainstream\npolitics of the Welfare State as much as they should and are\ngenerally relegated to the in-between spaces of social inter-\naction. As illustrated by the texts, lives in the in-between\nspaces, in the interstices of the society, enact resistance to\nhegemony and power play in the society. Such articulation of\ndifference from the perspective of the disprivileged is a com-\nplex and continuous negotiation that take shape during\nmoments of historical transition or transformation and that\npolitical empowerment and the enlargement of the cultural\nspace come from posing questions about community and\nidentity from such interstitial perspectives.\nIndia remains a republic struggling with manifold layers\nof social exclusion and must confront processes of internal\ncolonization and address the systematic or de facto processes\nof denial of entitlements, based on class, caste, clan, gender,\ntribe, language, and religion--factors that are often bundled\nwith location. Resources of the country must be equitably\nshared. Exclusion is experienced at all levels of society, at\nthe regional, community, interpersonal, and intrapersonal\nlevels that hinder the consolidation of an egalitarian civil\nsociety. The essay tries to show a text's genesis in a sociohis-\ntorical situation from which nontextual social \"truths\" are\ninterpreted. The three texts perform several tasks. They com-\nprise a political and social discourse from interstitial per-\nspectives as reminders of the founding principles of a\nRepublic. They serve as mediators between the governmen-\ntality of the state apparatus and the lives of a vast number of\npeople that remain untouched by the so-called \"developmen-\ntal\" policies. The texts also emphasize the need to \"listen\" to\nthese voices with ethical sensitivity to move toward a truly\ndecolonialized condition to be able to fulfill the vision of a\nRepublic.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
