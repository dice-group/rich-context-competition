    "abstract": "Abstract thinking is a cognitive domain that captures\nrespondents' ability to identify relationships be-\ntween concepts. Thirteen percent were missing a\nscore on abstract thinking, and we assigned these\nindividuals the mean score. To assess the impact of\nthis imputation process for delayed word recall and\nabstract thinking on our estimates, we ran our\nmodels without the imputed scores. The results from\nthose models did not differ from what we report\nlater. Self-rated memory, as well as vision and audi-\ntory acuity, are based on reports of excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, and poor, which we recoded to fair\nor poor reports versus all others. Vision and auditory\nratings are with the use of glasses, contacts, or hear-\ning aid.\nOur dependent variable, physical function, was\ncreated out of questions of difficulty with body\nmovements. Johnson and Wolinsky (1993) have\nshown that both an upper and lower body dimension\nof body movement may exist, but our interest is in\nthe lower body dimension, because of its strong\nassociation with perceived health, depression, mor-\ntality, and health care utilization (Guralnik et al.,\nphysical function items such as walking and climbing\nstairs \"have been shown to be valid in comparisons\nwith direct, standardized observations of perfor-\nThe eight items were walk several blocks, walk 1\nblock, walk across a room, climb several flights of\nstairs, climb 1 flight of stairs, carry 10 pounds, push\nor pull a heavy object, and one question about diffi-\nculty stooping, crouching, or kneeling. Based on our\ninterest in modeling significant limitation, respon-\ndents who reported no or a little difficulty on an item\nwere coded 0, and those who reported some or a lot\nof difficulty on an item, or who reported that they\ncannot or do not do the movement, were coded 1.\nFactor analysis of eight items that have primarily\nlower body requirements, but are not traditional\nactivity of daily living items, yielded one factor with\nloadings ranging from .66 to .86 for both men and\nwomen. Cronbach's alpha for the eight physical\nfunction items was .92 for men and .91 for women.\nFor our multivariate models, we dichotomized the\nphysical function measure by separating those with\ndifficulty on at least 1 item from those with no diffi-\nculty on any of the items.\nAnalyses\nIn the presentation of results, we discuss rates of\nhigh-risk behaviors and diseases, which are shown in\nTable 1, and we discuss differences in those rates for\nmen and women, which are assessed using the Chi-\nsquare or t-test as appropriate. We then discuss the\nresults of logistic regression models intended to as-\nsess associations between the sets of independent\nvariables (e.g., sociodemographic, behavioral, dis-\nease, and impairment) and the existence of some\ndifficulty in physical function. This is done in order to\nreflect the causal sequencing of the natural history of\nfunctional status and to capture any decomposition\nof distal effects. We do this by estimating a series of\nlogistic regression models. Following the first model,\neach model in the series incorporates the next con-\nceptually relevant set of independent variables.\nResults\nThe presentation of data in Table 1 follows our\nmodel of functional status; sociodemographic char-\nacteristics, followed by high-risk behaviors, disease\nprevalence and severity, impairments, and finally,\nphysical function. Much of the data presented in\nTable 1 has not been available on African American\nadults, and there are some interesting results con-\ntained in that table. Women were more likely to be\nmarried than men and were less likely to be in the\nlowest education category. With regard to high-risk\nbehaviors, the CAGE scores indicate that as much as\n1/3 of the men have responses considered to be\nsuggestive of alcohol abuse at some point in their\nlives (score of greater than 2). It is also important to\npoint out that the prevalence of cigarette smoking is\nat 40% for men and 24% for women. One-half of the\nmen who smoke are smoking more than V2 pack per\nday. Distributions on the percent of ideal body mass\nindicate that nearly 2 out of 5 women are above 140%\nof their ideal body mass (obese), and more than 3 out\nabove 140% of their ideal body-mass.\nChronic disease affected a majority of respon-\ndents; 73% of men and 82% of women reported at\nleast 1 chronic disease. Among the chronic diseases,\nthe most prevalent, by far, was hypertension. One-\nhalf of the men and 3 out of 5 women reported\nhaving ever been told they have hypertension. One\nout of 3 men and a little more than 2 out of 5 women\nreported currently taking medication for hyperten-\nsion. Arthritis is the next most common condition,\nwith 32% of men and 48% of women reporting having\never been told they have arthritis. Nearly as many\nreported joint symptoms associated with arthritis,\nbut only 13% of men and 22% of women report\ntaking medication for their arthritis. Diabetes and\nheart disease are evident in 15 to 19% of the sample.\nWomen were more likely than men to have ever\nbeen diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, can-\ncer, respiratory illness, psychiatric illness, and arthri-\ntis, while men were more likely to have ever been\ndiagnosed with congestive heart failure and cerebro-\nvascular disease.\nAmong impairments, women reported greater\ndaily pain and greater severity of pain when at its\nworst. Interestingly, women were more likely than\nmen to self-rate their thinking ability as fair or poor,\nbut they scored equally well on the objective tests of\nimmediate word recall, delayed recall, and abstract\nthinking. Finally, women were much more likely to\nreport difficulty with physical function. One-half\n(51.6%) of the African American women reported\nsome difficulty in physical function, whereas one-\nthird (33.5%) of the African American men reported\nsome difficulty.\nTables 2 and 3 present the odds ratios for some\ndifficulty in physical function obtained when so-\nciodemographic, behavioral, disease severity, and\nimpairment indicators were included in a logistic\nregression model for men (Table 2) and women (Ta-\nble 3). The first of four models included sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics only, with each subsequent\nmodel incorporating the next relevant block of vari-\nables. Model 1 of Table 2 shows that, among men,\nbeing married and having greater education were\nnegatively associated with reports of some difficulty\nin physical function. Men who were married were\ntwo-thirds as likely as men who were not married to\nreport some difficulty. Each year of completed\nschooling was associated with a 13% lower probabil-\nity of reporting some difficulty.\nAmong men, the incorporation of behavioral mea-\nsures (cigarette and alcohol abuse scores and per-\ncent of ideal body-mass) in Model 2 did not change\nthe association of education, and the association of\nbeing married was reduced only slightly. The behav-\nioral measures associated with some difficulty in\nphysical function were the alcohol abuse score, cur-\nrently smoking, having stopped smoking in the last\n10 years, being at or below 90% of ideal body mass,\nand being at or above 160% of ideal body mass. Net\nof other variables in the model, each additional point\non the alcohol abuse score was associated with a 25%\ngreater likelihood of reporting difficulty in physical\nfunction. Currently smoking was marginally signifi-\ncant (those who currently smoke were 50% more\nlikely to report some difficulty), as was having\nstopped smoking in the last 10 years. Being at or\nbelow 90% of ideal body mass was strongly associ-\nated with reports of some difficulty, and being at or\nabove 160% of ideal body-mass was associated with a\n160% greater likelihood of reporting some difficulty\nin physical function among men. Note, however,\nthat the confidence interval around the estimate for\nthose at or below 90% is very large due to the small\npercent of respondents in this category.\nModel 3 shows the results obtained when severity\nscores for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, respira-\ntory illness, heart disease, congestive heart failure,\ncerebrovascular disease, psychiatric illness, and ar-\nthritis were incorporated. The incorporation of these\ndisease scores did not change the net effect of edu-\ncation, but being married, the alcohol abuse score,\ncurrently smoking, and having stopped smoking in\nthe last 10 years were no longer significant. Similarly,\nthe highest obesity category was no longer signifi-\ncant. Marriage, smoking, alcohol abuse, and obesity\nall appear to have been associated with reports of\nsome difficulty in physical function in part because of\nTable 1.

With\nthe exception of hypertension and congestive heart\nfailure, each of the disease scores was associated\nwith a greater likelihood of reporting some difficulty.\nBecause all patients with congestive heart failure\nwould also have heart disease, difficulty in physical\nfunction associated with congestive heart failure may\nbe explained by the heart disease score.\nModel 4 shows results from the incorporation of\neach of the pain, cognitive, and sensory impairment\nmeasures. The incorporation of these measures\nslightly changed the net association of education,\nwhich was no longer significant. Also, the net associ-\nations of two of the disease scores were no longer\nsignificant. Cancer and respiratory illness were no\nlonger associated with reports of difficulty in physi-\ncal function, and the net associations of the psychiat-\nric and arthritis scores were reduced by 20 to 25%.\nThus, as expected, disease scores were associated\nwith reports of some difficulty in part because of\ntheir association with impairment. The only impair-\nment measures that reached significance among\nmen were severity of pain when at its worst and\nabstract thinking, which was marginally significant.\nNet of sociodemographic, behavioral, disease sever-\nity, and other impairment measures, each additional\npoint on the pain severity score was associated with a\n235% greater likelihood of reporting some difficulty\nin physical function. Thus, those who reported se-\nvere pain were considerably more likely to report\nsome difficulty than those who reported no pain. To\nsummarize, the variables with significant net associa-\ntions in the final model for men were diabetes, heart,\ncerebrovascular, psychiatric, and arthritis disease se-\nverity scores, pain when at its worst, and abstract\nthinking. The area under the receiver operating char-\nacteristic (ROC) curve in this final model was .88. The\nHosmer and Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit statistic\nTable 2.

Again, Model\n1 examines associations between sociodemographic\ncharacteristics and some difficulty in physical func-\ntion. For women, education had a significant net\nassociation with a report of some difficulty in physi-\ncal function, but marital status did not. Each year of\ncompleted schooling was associated with a 13%\nlower likelihood of reporting some difficulty in phys-\nical function.\nModel 2 presents the association of both sociode-\nmographic and behavioral indicators with some diffi-\nculty in physical function. The net association of\neducation remained essentially unchanged, and al-\ncohol abuse and each category of obesity over 120%\nhad significant associations with some difficulty. Be-\ning at or below 90% of ideal body mass was strongly\nassociated with some difficulty. Each additional point\non the alcohol abuse score was associated with a 40%\ngreater likelihood of reporting some difficulty, and\n333% greater likelihood of difficulty, respectively,\nrelative to those between 91 and 120% of their ideal\nbody mass. Interestingly, smoking had no associa-\ntion with some difficulty among women.\nThe results of the incorporation of disease scores\nis shown in Model 3. The significant net associations\nof education, and the highest and lowest ideal body\nmass categories remain significant, though some-\nwhat reduced. The disease scores with a significant\nnet association with reports of some difficulty were\nhypertension, respiratory illness, heart disease, psy-\nchiatric illness, and arthritis. Cerebrovascular dis-\nease had a very marginal association. An additional\npoint on these disease severity measures was associ-\nated with between a 24 and 77% greater likelihood of\nreporting difficulty.\nResults from the inclusion of impairment measures\nis shown in Model 4. Again, the net associations of\nthe highest and lowest ideal body mass categories\nwere significant. Education, however, was not. Thus,\nconsidering the slightly reduced associations of obe-\nsity noted in Model 3, obesity's association with\nTable 3.

The\nnet association of education, on the other hand,\nappears to be due in part to its association with\nhealth behaviors, disease severity, and impairment.\nThe associations of the disease severity scores were\nchanged somewhat with the inclusion of impairment\nmeasures, and of the 5 severity scores that were\nsignificant in Model 3, only the respiratory illness\nand arthritis disease scores remain significant in\nModel 4. Unlike the models for men, severity of pain\nwhen at its worst did not have a significant net associ-\nation with reports of some difficulty, but immediate\nword recall scores did have significant net associa-\ntions. Thus, the final model of some difficulty in\nphysical function for women included highest and\nlowest ideal body mass categories, severity scores\nfor respiratory illness and arthritis, and immediate\nword recall scores. The area under the ROC curve for\nthis final model was .83, and the HL goodness-of-fit\nwas more than acceptable. The model did underesti-\nmate difficulty in the fourth, fifth, and sixth deciles\nby 10 to 20%, however, and overestimated difficulty\nby 10% in the eighth decile of risk.\nDiscussion\nThe data and analyses presented in this article\nprovide important, preliminary information for those\nconcerned with the health of African American men\nand women. Data in this detail have not been avail-\nable for African Americans of any age, and 51 to 61 is\nan important age group because this is an age when\nmany chronic diseases and limitations begin to sur-\nface. In light of this, a number of the findings warrant\nfurther consideration, including gender differences\nand similarities in both the prevalence data and the\nmodel estimates.\nAs expected (see Clark & Maddox, 1992), the mean\neducation level is less than high school among this\nage cohort of African Americans. The rate of high-\nrisk behaviors is of particular concern. The rate of\nsmoking is high and a potential target for interven-\ntion among this cohort (40% for men and 24% for\nwomen), as is evidence of alcohol abuse among men\nand obesity among women. Alcohol abuse can exac-\nerbate existing conditions through noncompliance,\nand is associated with trauma and social dislocation\n(e.g., job loss). Obesity is a risk factor for a full range\nof chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabe-\ntes, congestive heart failure, and arthritis, and can\nalso have a direct effect on physical function. In light\nof the prevalence and importance of smoking, alco-\nhol abuse, and obesity, further efforts to understand\nand manage these risks among African Americans\nshould be a primary public health goal.\nThere has been much controversy over the impact\nof being \"very thin\" (measured here as less than 90%\nof ideal body mass), but a recent study (Manson et\ncluded that there is little evidence of harm in being\nvery thin. We found a substantial and direct effect of\nbeing very thin on difficulty in physical function\namong males and females, but the confidence inter-\nvals around these estimates were very large.\nDespite gender differences in the factors found to\nhave direct associations with physical function, the\nfit of the final model was quite good for both men\nand women (ROC = .88 for men and .83 for women).\nSample size has been a concern in previous studies\nof older African Americans, particularly sample sizes\nfor older African American men. Sample size was a\nconcern for the analyses of the present article as\nwell, despite the availability of 600 men. The rela-\ntively low rate of difficulty in physical function\namong men leads to some concern for logistic re-\ngression models that depend on a large number of\nevents (i.e., difficulty in physical function). We are\nconfident in the results of the final model for men,\nhowever, because Model 3 of Table 2 includes 19\nvariables as opposed to the 27 of Model 4, and has an\nThere are also several other potential limitations\nthat must be considered. First, because these analy-\nses use cross-sectional data, contentions about\ncause and effect regarding the independent variables\nin these models and difficulty in physical function are\nnot appropriate. Accordingly, we have been cautious\nto report our findings as associational and note that\nsome of the independent variables used here (e.g.,\npsychiatric illness) deserve particular attention in the\nfuture due to their likely reciprocal association with\nphysical function. Other factors need to be incorpo-\nrated into the model, such as income, labor force\nstatus, and physical activity. This was not possible\nhere with cross-sectional data because of the expec-\ntation that these factors will both affect and be af-\nfected by physical function. Extension of the model\nto further outcomes (e.g., ADLs, perceived health,\nand depression) also deserves attention as the longi-\ntudinal data become available.\nSecond, although the existence of difficulty in\nphysical function has been modeled here, extent of\ndifficulty in physical function has not. In preliminary\nanalyses on the extent of difficulty for men and\nwomen, it was found that the same model presented\nhere accounted for 46% of the variance in extent of\ndifficulty among women, but only 23% of the vari-\nance among men. Those analyses identified only two\nfactors associated with extent of difficulty among\nmen. In light of this, and the possible impact of work-\nor trauma-related disability among men, future work\nneeds to consider the role of employment status,\noccupational demands, and job history in models of\nextent of difficulty in physical function. Furthermore,\nit is likely that estimation of the extent of difficulty\nwould be more dependent on an accurate measure\nof severity of chronic disease than would the exist-\nence of difficulty. For example, a myocardial infarc-\ntion as a manifestation of heart disease, or a stroke as\na manifestation of cerebrovascular disease, would be\nexpected to have an immediate and direct impact on\nphysical function. Some myocardial infarctions or\nstrokes would cause mild symptoms, however,\nwhereas others could cause patients to become con-\nfined to a bed or chair. Thus, specification of the\nseverity of disease would be expected to be more\nimportant to modeling extent of difficulty as com-\npared to the presence or absence of difficulty.\nThird, there are a number of issues yet to be\naddressed with the disease severity score. The as-\nsignment of scores, although unique, is admittedly\narbitrary. Alternative assignments and scoring al-\ngorithms are certainly possible. Also, the predictive\nvalidity of the scores has not been established. With\nthe availability of follow-up data, the ability of the\nscores to predict adverse events and health service\nutilization can be established.\nDespite these limitations, the model of the natural\nhistory of physical function appears to fit these data\nvery well. The presence of some difficulty in physical\nfunction is differentiated quite well by the factors of\nthe model. Each set of factors added a critical compo-\nnent to the model. The most notable increment to\nthe fit of the models came with the incorporation of\nthe disease severity scores. In analyses not shown,\nwe estimated Model 3 of Tables 2 and 3 using individ-\nual disease prevalence indicators in place of the\ndisease severity scores. At .69, the ROC curves for\nthese models were considerably lower than those\nwomen). Furthermore, only 2 of the disease preva-\nlence indicators were significant among men and\nnone was significant among women. Thus, the dis-\nease severity scores incorporated into the model of\nthis article appear to represent a considerable ad-\nvancement over traditional disease summation and\nindividual disease prevalence indicators.\nUltimately, the most important issue regarding any\nconceptual model of functional status is whether the\nmodel can inform decisions about prevention and/or\nmanagement of functional impairment. Most of the\nfactors with the largest direct and indirect associa-\ntions with difficulty in physical function among these\nAfrican American men and women are potentially\npreventable (e.g., obesity, alcohol abuse, heart dis-\nease, respiratory illness) or manageable (e.g., pain,\ndiabetes, arthritis). We conclude, therefore, that fur-\nthering and supporting current efforts to understand\nthe social, behavioral, and medical causes of these\nfactors within the African American population will\nlikely have considerable public health impact. Effec-\ntively implemented, this information could lead to\nsignificant improvements in physical function within\nthe older African American population. Given the\npublic and private costs associated with functional\nlimitation (Schneider & Guralnik, 1990), such efforts\nwould benefit the U.S. population as a whole.\nReferences\nByers, T. (1995).

    "reduced_content": "The Cerontological Society of America\nThe Cerontologist\nPrior attempts to identify factors associated with physical function (here, major lower body\nmovements) among African Americans have been constrained by a narrow range of measures,\nsmall sample sizes, or both. The 1992 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) contains a\nsubstantial over-sample of African Americans (649 men and 957 women self-respondents aged\n51 to 61 years), and detailed measures of high-risk behaviors, disease prevalence and severity,\nimpairment, and physical function. We extend the natural history of disease to the natural\nhistory of functional status and model sociodemographic characteristics, high-risk behaviors,\ndisease prevalence and severity, and impairments as direct and indirect influences on physical\nfunction in this African American sample. This natural history of functional status model fits\nthe data well for both men (ROC = .88) and women (ROC = .83), although there are gender\ndifferences. Slightly over one-half of the women report some difficulty in physical function,\ncompared with one-third of the men. Women also have a higher mean body-mass and report a\ngreater prevalence and severity in 6 of 9 chronic diseases and more pain, but are less likely to\nsmoke or abuse alcohol than men. Importantly, many of the factors with the largest direct and\nindirect associations with difficulty in physical function among these African American men\n(alcohol abuse, smoking, body mass, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, arthritis,\nand pain) and women (alcohol abuse, body mass, arthritis, and respiratory illness) are all\npotentially preventable or manageable.\nKey Words: African Americans, Physical function, Chronic disease\nPhysical Function Among Retirement-Aged\nAfrican American Men and Women\nDaniel O. Clark, PhD,12 Christopher M. Callahan, MD,12\nSimon M. Mungai, MA, MBA,2 and Fredric D. Wolinsky, PhD12\nDetailed information on functional status among\nAfrican Americans has rarely been available, and\nwhen it has, sample sizes and/or measures have lim-\nited comparisons of functional status and its model-\ning across African American subgroups (Clark & Mad-\nTo provide such comparisons across African Ameri-\ncan subgroups and estimate more complete models\nof functional status, there are at least two data re-\nquirements. First, a large sample of African Americans\nof particular age cohorts is needed so that an age-\nspecific, if not age- and gender-specific, model or\nmodels can be estimated. Age- and gender-specific\nmodels are necessary because of the potential impact\nof selective survival (see Gibson, 1991; Markides &\nMindel, 1987) on parameter estimates within specific\nage cohorts, and evidence that chronic diseases may\nhave gender-specific associations with functional sta-\ntus (Johnson & Wolinsky, 1994). Second, to model the\nnatural history of functional status, detailed measures\nof sociodemographic characteristics, health-related\nbehaviors, disease, impairment, and functional status\nare required.\nIndiana University, Department of Medicine.\n2Regenstrief Institute for Health Care.\n3Address correspondence to Daniel O. Clark, PhD, Department of Medi-\ncine, Regenstrief Institute for Health Care, 1001 West Tenth Street, RC-5,\nWith the availability of the 1992 Health and Retire-\nment Study (Juster & Suzman, n.d.) data on African\nAmericans aged 51 to 61 years, and an explicit, in-\nformed model of the natural history of functional\nstatus, these conditions can be met, including the\nestimation of gender-specific models. In addition,\nthe groundwork for future use of the HRS follow-up\ndata can be laid. For example, although physical\nfunction is the focus of this article, it represents just\none of a series of health-related quality of life (HRQL)\noutcomes (e.g., disability, perceived health, depres-\nsion). As data from subsequent waves become avail-\nable, the natural history of the functional status\nmodel can be expanded to represent the natural\nhistory of HRQL (e.g., activity of daily living [ADL]\ndisability, perceived health, and depression). We\nfocus here on physical function because of recent\nevidence that physical function is the entrance point\nto a decline in HRQL. Several recent reports have\nshown that among older adults, physical function\nhas a strong positive association with activities of\ndaily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, and perceived\nhealth (Johnson & Wolinsky, 1994; Stump, Clark,\nJohnson, & Wolinsky, 1995), and is predictive of ADL\ndisability onset (Gurnalnik, Ferrucci, Simonsick,\nIn this article, we specifically refer to self-reports\nof some or a lot of difficulty performing any 1 of 8\nlower-body functions as some difficulty in physical\nfunction. Our objectives are to use the HRS data to 1)\ndescribe and 2) model sociodemographic, behav-\nioral, chronic disease severity, and impairment fac-\ntors associated with physical function among African\nAmerican men and women aged 51 to 61 years. Al-\nthough most studies of health and functional status\namong African Americans have included a white\ncomparison and have been able to show that African\nAmericans are much more likely to report functional\nlimitations than whites (Clark & Maddox, 1992; John-\nwe elected not to take such an approach in this\narticle. Information on physical function and its cor-\nrelates within African American subgroups can in-\nform research and health care policy concerned with\nthe health of African Americans.\nMethods\nModel\nOur model draws heavily on a model of the natural\nhistory of functional status presented in Johnson and\nWolinsky (1993), but extends that model by incorpo-\nrating behavioral factors, disease severity, and im-\npairment. The model hypothesizes that sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics affect behavior, that each of\nthese influence chronic disease prevalence and se-\nverity, and all of the preceding factors affect pain and\ncognitive and sensory impairment. These factors ulti-\nmately affect physical function. Impairment (i.e.,\nhealth problems or feelings not directly observable)\nhas been excluded from most empirical assessments\nof functional status because of a lack of available\nmeasures and data. Although the conceptualization\nof impairment focuses on anatomical, physiological,\nor psychological dysfunctions as measured through\nlaboratory data or medical records, self-reports of\nsymptoms, pain, and sensory deficits can also be\nused (Patrick & Bergner, 1990). Measures of cognitive\nimpairment, pain, and disease-specific symptoms\nhave just begun to be measured in social and health\nsurveys (e.g., the Established Populations for the Epi-\ndemiologic Study of the Elderly; Inouye, Albert,\nMohs, Sun, & Berkman, 1993), and their associations\nwith sociodemographic, behavioral, chronic disease,\nand physical function measures have been minimally\nstudied. Theoretically, cognitive impairment, pain,\nand disease-specific symptoms are an outcome of\nsociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, in\naddition to disease. Each of these factors has poten-\ntially important associations with physical function.\nData\nThe purpose of the HRS is to provide in-depth data\nfor the investigation of analytic and policy issues\nsurrounding the retirement decision. Thus, the age\ngroup selected (ages 51 to 61 years) was intended to\ninclude a majority of persons who had not yet retired\nbut who would likely retire in the coming years. Due\nto the intricate relationship between health (physi-\ncal, cognitive, and emotional) and retirement, exten-\nsive information was collected not only on income,\nwealth, and occupational demands and histories, but\non health as well. An over-sample (2:1) of census\ntracts containing a high proportion of African Ameri-\ncans or Hispanics reflects the fact that these popula-\ntions make up an ever-growing segment of the labor\nforce, and that data on minority health and retire-\nment is inadequate.\nholds to identify age-eligible respondents (aged 51 to\n61 years). All age-eligible persons living in the se-\nlected households were interviewed. All spouses\nwere included in the study regardless of age because\nof the frequency of dual-earner couples and the\ninfluence of spouses in the retirement decision pro-\ncess. Thus, the HRS includes data on 2,912 persons\neither younger than 51 or older than 61 years of age.\nThese persons were excluded from the analyses pre-\nsented here. By the most conservative criteria, the\noverall response rate was 82%, and comparisons to\n1990 census data provide no indication of sample\nbias. Due to the subjective nature of physical func-\ntion assessments, our analyses use self-respondents\nself-respondents who identified themselves as pri-\nwomen. Because all African American respondents\nhad the same probability of selection, the HRS sam-\nple weights were not used. The Beta release version\nof the HRS baseline data was used.\nMeasures\nThe distributions and coding algorithms of each\nmeasure used in the analyses are presented by sex in\nTable 1. We will not review every measure, but in-\nstead highlight coding algorithms that may not be\napparent by looking over Table 1. Behavioral variables\ninclude the \"cut down, annoyed, guilty, and eyes\nopen\" alcohol abuse scale (CAGE; Mayfield, McLeod,\n& Hall, 1974), smoking status, and body mass index as\na measure of obesity. The CAGE questions are:\n1. Have you ever felt that you should cut down on\n. your drinking?\n2. Have people ever annoyed you by criticizing your\ndrinking?\n3. Have you ever felt bad or guilty about drinking?\n4. Have you ever taken a drink first thing in the\nmorning to steady your nerves?\nThose who do not drink, or drink lightly, score a zero\non the CAGE, and all others receive a value ranging\nfrom 1 to 4 depending on the number of positive\nresponses to questions about drinking patterns.\nCronbach's alpha for the scale was .75 for men and\n.74 for women. For smoking, two measures were\ncreated: the percent who currently smoke (as well as\nthe percent smoking V2 pack or less and more than V2\npack), and the percent who quit within the last 10\nyears. Obesity is common among and important to\nthe health of African American women (Lieberman,\n1988), and we assessed its association with physical\nfunction using a set of dummy variables, including\none representing those at or below 90% of ideal\nbody mass. The calculation of the percentages is\nbased on a medically determined ideal (maximized\nlife expectancy) body mass index of 21.6 for women\nIntheHRS, several questions were used to provide\nan indication of the extent and severity of major\ndiseases. This is important because indicators of the\nprevalence of disease alone do not provide informa-\ntion on how the disease has progressed or been\nmanaged. There are 9 major diseases covered: hy-\npertension, diabetes, cancer, respiratory illness,\nheart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovas-\ncular disease, arthritis, and psychiatric illness. For\neach of these, we assigned one point for a self-report\nof ever having been diagnosed with the illness, one\npoint for current treatment for the self-reported ill-\nness, and one point for current symptoms due to the\nself-reported illness. The assigned points reflect the\nclinical observation that patients receiving treatment\nfor an illness and currently symptomatic from an\nillness would be expected to have more severe dis-\nease than an asymptomatic patient who doesn't re-\nquire treatment for control of the self-reported dis-\nease. For hypertension, diabetes, and cancer there\nwas no question about current symptoms. For diabe-\ntes, we assigned an additional point for those with a\ngreater than 10-year history of the disease because of\nthe higher prevalence of end-stage organ damage.\nAlso, for a very small number of patients (n = 24), the\nuse of both insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents\nwere reported. Therefore, we allowed one point for\neach of these treatments. For respiratory illness, we\nassigned an additional point for those reporting limi-\ntations in activities in addition to current symptoms\ndue to respiratory illness. Finally, for heart disease,\nwe assigned an additional point for those reporting a\nhistory of cardiac surgery. Thus, each condition had\na severity range of either 0-2 (hypertension and can-\ncer only), 0-3, or 0-4. We did not tabulate the nine\nchronic disease severity scales into a single measure\nof comorbidity; rather, the severity scores are\ntreated as individual variables as described later. In\nthis manner we are assigning severity within disease\ncategory, but we do not necessarily equate a point\ngiven for one condition with a point given for an-\nother condition.\nWe incorporate non-disease-specific pain reports\nbecause of their likely, but understudied, impact on\nphysical function. We are able to use ratings of the\nseverity of pain most of the time and when at its\nworst. A recent review of experiments investigating\nthe reporting of chronic pain on health surveys con-\ncluded that pain recall is quite reliable (Salovey et al.,\n1992). Sensory and cognitive impairment measures\nhave also been included. We have used immediate\nand delayed word recall, an abstract thinking score,\nand self-rated memory questions as indicators of\ncognitive impairment, which has been shown to be\nmore prevalent among young and old African Ameri-\ncans compared to whites (Callahan, Hendrie, & Tier-\nney, 1995). The immediate and delayed word recall\ntests were conducted by giving respondents a list of\n20 common words and asking them to recall as many\nas possible. Somewhat later in the interview, the\nrespondents were again asked how many words they\nwere able to recall. Valid immediate and delayed\nrecall scores range from 0 to 20. Twelve percent of\nthe respondents did not have a delayed word recall\nscore. The average difference between immediate\nand delayed word recall was 2.3 words, so we as-\nsigned those with missing data on delayed recall a\nscore of 2.3 less than their immediate word recall\nscore. Three percent of the respondents did not have\nan immediate word recall score, and were excluded\nfrom our models of difficulty in physical function."
