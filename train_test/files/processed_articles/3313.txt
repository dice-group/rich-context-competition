    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis work is aimed at establishing key organizational strategies that push small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT) services sector to be more innovative. Following an input and output\napproach, a theoretical model is built that helps determine such key factors. Then the model is validated with fieldwork\ncarried out on a representative sample in Castile-Leon region (Spain). According to this model, the decision to innovate (and\nthe trigger for research and development [R&D] activities in SMEs in the ICT services sector) is the result of needs that are\npresented by customers (public or private sector) in tailored projects. All the same, the factors leading to innovation are in\norder of importance, the technological level of the company, the effort made by the company in R&D, and finally, systems\nof incentives.\n",

(1995) refer to them as knowledge-intensive business\nsectors, sharing this classification with other specialized ser-\nvices sectors such as engineering, business consultancy, and\nresearch and development (R&D) services.\nBusinesses in the ICT services industries face a high com-\npetitive environment, because ICT industry is characterized\nby high rates of technological change and innovation, and\nnew value chain and business models. At the same time, ICT\nindustry is extremely globalized and dynamic and is highly\nconcentrated in specific areas (Garc\u00eda Manj\u00f3n, 2008).\nAccording to Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and\nDevelopment (OECD; 2015), the ICT sector is characterized\nby continued high R&D expenditures and a large number of\nICT-related patents which reflect the key role of the ICT sec-\ntor in innovation activities, resulting in an R&D business\nexpenditure accounting for almost 0.5% of GDP. Working in\nsuch a highly demanding environment represents a challenge\nfor all ICT businesses, especially SMEs.\nBeing aware of the aforementioned, we consider innova-\ntion as a key issue for business strategy, because it is expected\nthat it triggers competitiveness and firm performance. Thus,\nscientific literature postulates that innovation represents a\nsignificant factor in determining firm's success (Pratali,\nEsposito, & Soufani, 2016) while others (Wilkinson &\nThomas, 2014) alert that firms that do not innovate face\nunderperformance or dissolution.\nGarc\u00eda-Manj\u00f3n and Romero-Merino (2012) stated that\n\"given the greater knowledge-intensity presented by these sec-\ntors in comparison with nontechnological or medium-tech\nsectors, it is reasonable to expect strong correlations between\nR&D (knowledge creation) and firm growth.\" (p. 1085) Chan,\nMartin, and Kensinger (1990) and Zantout and Tsetsekos\n(1994) found a positive market response to increased R&D\ninvestment for high-tech industry firms, while the relation-\nship turns out to be negative for low-tech industry firms.\nAccordingly, there are many authors who posit a positive\n1Universidad Europea Miguel de Cervantes, Valladolid, Spain\n2Universidad Internacional de la Rioja, Spain\n3Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain\nCorresponding Author:\nJudith Redoli, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Madrid, Spain.\nEmail: judit.redoli@uah.es\nAccelerating Innovation in Small and\nMedium-Sized Enterprises in the ICT\nServices Sector\nJuan Vicente Garc\u00eda Manj\u00f3n1, Rafael Momp\u00f32,\nand Judith Redoli3\n Keywords\nSME, ICT, innovation, social change, regional development\n2 SAGE Open\nrelationship between innovation and firm performance\nnoted that \"firms that engage in developing innovative prod-\nucts and services are positioned to compete more successfully\nthrough the development of new products and processes,\nbefore competitors in first-mover advantage, increasing mar-\nket share, return on investment (ROI), and overall firm suc-\ncess\" (p. 1). Finally, Coad and Rao (2008) also studied the\neffects of innovation on firm growth in high-tech sectors\n(including computers and office equipment, electronics, medi-\ncal instruments, and drugs); their results vary within the differ-\nent sectors analyzed, but they generally find that growth is\nrelated to innovativeness for most firms.\nInnovation Patterns in Intensive\nKnowledge and Tech SMEs\nICT service industries show two singular characteristics; on\none hand, they belong to the service sector; on the other\nhand, they are technology and knowledge based sectors. So,\nit is expected that the innovation patterns in these sectors\nvary from other industrial or low-tech sectors. For instance,\nsome authors report significant differences between the\neffect of R&D investment in the manufacturing sector, which\ncontributes more positively to firm market value than in the\nservice sector (Ehie & Olibe, 2010). Another difference\nbetween innovation in industrial and service sectors is the\nproper definition of innovation. Thus, it is worth posing a\ndefinition of service innovation as \"an offering not previ-\nously available to a firm's customers resulting from the addi-\ntion of a service offering or changes in the service concept\nthat allow for the service offering to be made available\"\nFollowing with the description of service innovation, we\ncan lean on the taxonomy of innovation (Pavitt, 1984) who\ndistinguished among scale intensive, supplier dominated,\nspecialized equipment suppliers and science-based firms. The\nlatter category (science-based firms) is the one that better\ndefines ICT service industries. The author stated that the main\nsources of technology for science-based firms are the R&D\nactivities of firms while they appropriate their innovating\nleads through a mix of methods (i.e., patents, secrecy, natural\ntechnical lags, and firm-specific skills). It is also worth citing\nDen Hertog (2000), who studied the special features of inno-\nvation in services, proposing five types: supplier dominated\ninnovation, innovation in services, client-led innovation,\ninnovation through services, and paradigmatic innovation.\nThe author affirmed that software firms, for instance, have to\nadapt their activities to new products from hardware compa-\nnies and it involves near continual updating and expansion of\nsoftware to exploit the facilities of new equipment. At the\nsame time, ICT is an important input for innovation in other\nsectors, because the implementation of ICT-based solutions\nis an innovation process or product itself. It is likely that\n\"client-led innovation\" and \"innovation through services\" are\ndominant types of innovation in these sectors.\nMore specifically, De Jong, Bruins, Dolfsma, and\nMeijgaard (2003) studied the innovation in specialized ser-\nvice sectors. The authors found out that innovation is heavily\ndependent on the knowledge and skills of coworkers, being\nthe innovative activities of the service firms themselves the\nmain source of innovation, oriented to fit the specific cus-\ntomer needs and developing this work in close interaction\nwith clients. Besides, these firms operate in a business-to-\nbusiness environment, having only a few customers with\nrelatively long client contact times, making considerable\nadjustments in their services to meet customer needs.\nHowever, some authors, such as Miles (2008), indicated\nthat some service organizations behave very much like high-\ntechnology manufacturing, being this especially true in tech-\nnology-based, knowledge-intensive business services. The\nauthor states that there are \"instinctive innovation patterns\ndisplayed by knowledge intensive business services are\nbased more on professional knowledge and by large net-\nwork-based service firms, while many smaller service firms\nconform to a supplier-driven pattern\" (p. 115) and he adds\n\"project management and on-the-job innovation are common\nways of organizing service innovation.\" (p. 115)\nOnce we have shed light on the patterns of innovation in\nservice sector and specialized services sector, we want to\ncope with another relevant point to our research, which is the\nsize of the businesses. Because we focus on small and\nmedium-sized businesses in the ICT service industry, we\nwould like to deep into the innovation patterns of SMEs.\nAccording to Yin and Zuscovitch (1998), innovative behav-\nior in small companies faces different kinds of problems than\nin other organizations. Harris, Rogers, and Siouclis (2001)\nfound that large companies are more innovative than SMEs.\nthe innovative process in SMEs is in general not the result of\nformal R&D activities carried out at specific laboratories, but of\ninformal accumulated learning that is manifested in the\ndevelopment of skills that allow them to assimilate, adapt and\nimprove new technologies and adapt the company's production\nbetter to specific market demands (p. 234).\nRothwell (1991) found that innovation activities of SMEs\nare important determinants of these SMEs' successes, while\nother authors like Storey (1994) posited that SMEs in all\nindustries do not innovate. According to Tether and Storey\n(1998), the impact of innovation on sales is an important\nmeasure of innovativeness, but the impact in SMEs is lower\nthan in large companies.\nSuh and Kim (2012) indicated that technology acquisition is\nthe most efficient type of collaboration for R&D of service\nSMEs, while networking is not significantly related to any type\nof R&D performance. Yeonhee, Sooyoung, and Hyejin (2011)\ninvestigated whether R&D efforts influence the financial and\nnonfinancial business performance of ICT business with a\nGarc\u00eda Manj\u00f3n et al. 3\nfocus on SMEs in South Korea. The authors postulated positive\nrelationships between R&D efforts and a firm's performance.\nAs a contribution to broaden the approach to study this\nproblem, this article proposes to validate a theoretical model to\nshed light on the innovation process of SMEs in the ICT ser-\nvice industry. Thus, first a theoretical model is built, which is\nthen validated against a sample of ICT service industry SMEs\nin Spain.\nModel Development\nInnovation Model\nAccording to Ramadani, Abazi-Alili, Dana, Rexhepi, and\nIbraimi (2016), firm performance is usually measured by\nindicators such as profit, revenue, growth, productivity, effi-\nciency, stock price, new markets, and export.\nInnovation models try to represent innovation procedures\nfor a territory, sector, business, or group of particular busi-\nnesses, including its relationships and behavior. However,\nthere is a major methodological challenge on how to measure\ninnovation behavior or technological change and its effect on\nfirm performance and at the same time getting appropriate\nindicators or using proxies that reflect only some aspects of\nthe innovation process (G\u00ebrguri-Rashiti, Ramadani, Abazi-\nIn this respect, G\u00ebrguri-Rashiti et al. (2015) posited that\nthe most common measures used in the literature analysing the\ninnovation process are as follows: (1) a measure of the inputs\ninto the innovation process, such as R&D expenditure or the\nnumber of scientists and engineers; (2) a measure of output,\nsuch as the number of inventions that have been patented; and\n(3) a direct measure of innovation output, such as new products\nor new processes (p. 5).\nWe have selected the conversion model (Crepon, Duguet,\n& Mairesse, 1998) to establish our theoretical model. We con-\nsider that innovation is a process that is driven by INPUTS or\ncontributions in the form of R&D, technology acquisition,\nhuman or financial resources, that give rise to a series of\nOUTPUTS or results of innovation in the form of product\ninnovations, process innovations or both. All this is based on\nthe application of a particular innovation process. Thus, the\nmodel considers that the OUTPUT of innovation is a depen-\ndent variable that shows positive and significant correlations\nbetween the presence of some INPUT or PROCESS variables\nand the achievement of product or process innovations in the\ncompany.\nIn the logic of the model, it can be supposed that those com-\npanies that have developed new processes or products as a\nresult of their innovation should obtain a superior business per-\nformance to those companies that do not develop innovative\nbehavior. In this sense, companies that are innovative in prod-\nucts or processes should have a greater increase in sales, prof-\nits, markets, or type of customer. The advantages of Crepon\net al. (1998) model is that it does not try to explain the innova-\ntion process as a sequence of a series of activities in developing\nnew products or services; rather, the innovation process appears\nwith much less structure, chaotic, and less rational. By its\nnature, the conversion model can define the innovation process\nin service companies much better.\nFigure 1 includes a graphic representation of the model\nwe propose (on the basis of the one of Crepon et al., 1998),\nFigure 1. Graphic representation of the model.\n4 SAGE Open\nin which we can see that once the decision to innovate has\nbeen taken (whether this is as a response to changes in the\nmarket or a decision based on the organization's own strat-\negy) the company will make a series of resources (INPUT)\navailable to its innovation strategy to put new products onto\nthe market or make significant improvements to those\nalready existing, or to incorporate new or improved pro-\ncesses into the company (OUTPUT). The above is put into\npractice through an innovative practice which implies the\nimplementation of a series of activities, strategies, interrela-\ntions, and management modes.\nWhen the innovation process obtains the expected results,\na number of effects occur in the business development of the\norganizations. At this point, there is feedback across the\nwhole model, as the business performance of the organiza-\ntion will have an influence on the decision to continue the\ncommitment to business innovation as a strategy, and on the\nresources the organization will make available for the inno-\nvation strategy or the innovation process that is applied.\nVariables Selection\nThere is a consensus in the literature about using multidi-\nmensional approaches for measuring the effects of innova-\ntion, although there are many theories about which such\nvariables should be (Dewangan & Godse, 2014). Specific\nvariables are established within the development of a model\nthat makes up the set of input, process, output, and business\nperformance variables. The set of variables depends on each\ncase of study (Edison, Bin Ali, & Torkara, 2013; Gurhan,\nUlusoy, Kilic, & Alpkan, 2011), and for that reason, the\npresent research should take into consideration the case of\nservice companies. To determine the proposed variables\n(input and process), we have analyzed the scientific litera-\nture and selected those that are considered factors of success\nfor innovation in service companies (De Jong et al., 2003).\nThe proposed variables in the group of output and business\nperformance variables have been selected in line with those\nused in the statistical studies in Spain for the case of output\nvariables, and following the contributions of Kemp, Folkeringa,\nJong, and Wubben (2003) for the case of business performance\nvariables. Table 1 establishes the list of variables proposed.\nInput and Process Variables Validation\nTo validate and refine the input variables, an analysis has\nbeen made using companies located in a region of Spain\n(Castile-Leon) as a population. The population that is the\nsubject of the study is composed of a total of 51 companies,\nemployees. The research was carried out through the submis-\nsion of a survey by post and telephone follow-up. A total of\n45 valid surveys were obtained with a confidence level of\nA factor analysis was made with the aim of reducing the\ndimensionality of the variables used and thus enabling work\non a set of variables by exploring the existence of underlying\nfactors or dimensions. This makes it much easier to handle\nthe model and to carry out later analyses.\nThe extraction of the factors was carried out using the\nprincipal axes method, which explained more than 60% of\nthe variation. This gave rise to the appearance of seven fac-\ntors. By applying an orthogonal Varimax model, a matrix of\nrotated factors was obtained, which is set out in Table 2.\nAfter analyzing the matrix of rotated factors, it was deter-\nmined that the composition of the factors is as follows:\nFactor 1: The variables that mainly correlate with this fac-\ntor are:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Staff exclusively dedicated to R&D activity\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 No. of R&D projects set out in writing\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 R&D activities have been carried out\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 R&D activities have been carried out continuously\nTable 1.

The improved model\ncan thus be represented as in Figure 2.\nTable 2. Rotated Factor Matrix.\nFactor\nUniversity or vocational training grant recipients carrying out R&D and\ninnovation work\nNote.

Research hypotheses.\nHypothesis 1: The seven factors that comprise INPUT and\nPROCESS variables individually show a positive and significant\nincidence on the probability that the company will show positive\ninnovation outputs.\nHypothesis 2: Companies that show a positive innovative\nperformance (in other words those that have developed\nproduct or process innovations) have had their own customers\nas the main source of these innovations.\nHypothesis 3: There is a positive and significant relation\nbetween the positive OUTPUT of the innovation process and\nthe company's business performance, which is materialized in an\nincrease in sales, profits, and reference markets, or an extension\nof the company's type of customers.\nTable 3. Origin on the Changes in ICT Products and Services\nPopulation\n(%)\nAND\nInnovative (%)\nTechnological suppliers or\npartners\nNeeds of the customers\nthemselves\nNote. ICT = information and communication technologies.\nHypotheses\nOnce the factors that conveniently explain the INPUT and\nPROCESS variables for our model have been determined,\nthe interest is to find out whether these factors have a posi-\ntive and significant influence on the innovative or nonin-\nnovative character of the companies that apply them. In\nthis case, we want to know how the presence or absence of\nvarious factors (those determined above) and their value or\nlevel, influence the probability of the appearance of a\ndichotomic event, such as the absence or presence of busi-\nness innovation. This is the objective of Hypothesis 1\n(Table 4).\nout that interaction with customers is key to the success of\ninnovation in services. An examination of the characteris-\ntics of innovation in the service sector presents a taxonomy\nthat is clearly dominated by customers and their needs.\nThe companies analyzed declared that the main source\ngenerating change in products and services in the ICT sec-\ntor is the needs of the customers themselves, with nearly\n70% of the companies answering in this way. Table 3\nshows details of the results corresponding to the induce-\nment to innovation variables. This is the objective of\nHypothesis 2 (Table 4).\nIn the logic of the model, it can be supposed that those\ncompanies that have developed new processes or products as\na result of their innovation should obtain a superior business\nperformance to those companies that do not develop innova-\ntive behavior. In this sense, companies that are innovative in\nproducts or processes should have a greater increase in sales,\nprofits, markets, or type of customer. This is the objective of\nHypothesis 3 (Table 4).\nGarc\u00eda Manj\u00f3n et al. 7\nAnalysis and Results\nLogistical regression analyses are used to determine whether\na binomial variable depends or not on other variables (not\nnecessarily binomial). In our case, the process is a binomial\nvariable as there are only two possible results: \"success\" or\n\"failure\" (innovative or not innovative), with the probability\nof each being constant in a series of repetitions.\nThe individual significance analysis showed that F2, F3,\nand F6 variables were not significant for the model. The\nresults of the logistical regression were that the factors lead-\ning to innovation are, in order of importance, the technologi-\ncal level of the company (F7), the effort made by the company\nin R&D (F1), and finally, systems of incentives (F5). Thus,\nHypothesis 1 is only partially validated.\nFinally, the specific Hypotheses 2 and 3 were validated.\nThis was done by carrying out two correlation analyses that\ndetermined the relation between the inducement to innova-\ntion variables for innovations and the innovative output of\nthe company; and a second showed the relations between the\noutput variables and those of business performance.\nThe first correlation analysis (for validating Hypothesis\n2) showed a Pearson correlation value of .432 for the cor-\nrelation analysis between the inducement to innovations\nvariables and the innovative output. This shows statistical\nsignificance for the analysis carried out, with a bilateral\nobtained for specific Hypothesis 2 show that the main\nsources of generating innovation in products and services\nin the ICT services sector for SMEs are those that come\nfrom products tailored to specific customers. Thus,\nHypothesis 2 is validated.\nThe second correlation analysis (for validating Hypothesis\n3) was a study carried out for each of the business perfor-\nmance indicators to undertake the correlation analysis\nbetween the innovative output and business performance. The\nfirst one (increase in company profits) showed a Pearson cor-\nrelation of .339, with a bilateral level of significance of .028.\nThe second (increase in the geographical market of reference)\nobtained a value of .332 in the Pearson correlation with a\nbilateral level of significance of .032. The third and last\n(extension of the number of type of customers) generated a\nvalue in the Pearson correlation of -.362, with a bilateral sig-\nnificance level of .017. Results confirm that the direct effect\nof product innovation is the extension of the geographical\nmarket of reference; in other words, innovative companies in\nthe sector have geographically more extensive markets and\ncompanies that innovate in processes also extend the number\nor type of customers. On the other hand, such innovative\ncompanies do not necessarily show an increase in sales or\nprofits. Thus, Hypothesis 3 is only partially validated.\nConclusion\nThe results show that a more convenient theoretical innova-\ntion model for SMEs in the ICT services sector is that of\nAccording to this model, the decision to innovate (and the\ntrigger for R&D activities in SMEs in the ICT services sector)\nis the result of needs that are presented by customers (public\nor private sector) in tailored projects. All the same, the factors\nleading to innovation are, in order of importance, the techno-\nlogical level of the company, the effort made by the company\nin R&D, and finally, systems of incentives.\nFigure 3. Theoretical innovation model.\n8 SAGE Open\nBesides, innovative companies in the sector have geo-\ngraphically more extensive markets and companies that\ninnovate in processes also extend the number or type of\ncustomers.\nThe result of the business policies expressed in the above\nparagraphs is an increase in innovation both in products and\nprocesses, but what influence does this increased innovation\nhave on the company's business performance? SMEs in the\nICT services sector that have introduced new or substantially\nimproved products onto the market have done so on the basis\nof extending their geographical market of reference and suf-\nfered a fall in sales over the same period. In addition, these\ncompanies have extended the number or type of their cus-\ntomers. In other words, innovation has been for them a mar-\nket growth strategy.\nFrom a managerial perspective, each company needs to\nidentify which of the factors should be boosted more within\nthe organization, and also the implications on the business\nstrategy to be followed. Future research directions to deal\nwith that question are the study of practical strategy models\nthat should be followed according to their competitive posi-\ntion in the market.
