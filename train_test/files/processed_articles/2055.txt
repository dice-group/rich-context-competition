Health-risk behaviors,\nincluding cigarette smoking and alcohol use, may exacerbate chronic diseases and complicate their management. The aim of this\nstudy was to longitudinally analyze rates of cigarette smoking and alcohol use in adolescents and young adults who have asthma\nand those who do not have asthma. A secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\nwas undertaken. Individuals with asthma were found to exhibit increasing rates of cigarette smoking and alcohol use as they\naged. When an adolescent with a chronic health issue begins health-risk-taking behaviors, behavior change interventions must\nbe planned. Pediatric nurses, practitioners, and clinicians are uniquely positioned to assess for health-risk behaviors in youth with\nasthma and to intervene with plans of care that are tailored for the needs of this vulnerable population.\n1. Introduction\nRisk-taking behaviors that can have lifelong implications are\noften begun in adolescence and young adulthood. Two com-\nmon health-risk behaviors that are frequently initiated are\ncigarette smoking and the alcohol consumption. The long-\nterm negative health consequences of these behaviors have\nbeen well documented, as has their prevalence in the general\nhealthy adolescent population; however, what is beginning\nto emerge in the literature is that health-risk behaviors are\nalso occurring among youth and adults with chronic health\nconditions, specifically asthma. This paper discusses the\nfindings from a study that examined cigarette smoking and\nalcohol use in adolescents and young adults who have asthma\nand in those who do not have asthma. The sample was drawn\nthrough a secondary analysis of data from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) [1].\nOur study addressed the following research questions:\n(1) How many adolescents and young adults with asthma\nare engaging in health-risk behaviors (e.g., smoking\ncigarettes and drinking alcohol)?\n(2) How do cigarette smoking and alcohol use rates and\npatterns change as adolescents with asthma age?\n(3) Are there differences in cigarette smoking and alcohol\nuse behaviors between adolescents and young adults\nwith asthma and those who do not have asthma?\nAsthma is a significant and growing public health prob-\nlem in the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) estimating that about 7 million\nchildren under the age of 18 years are affected [2]. Asthma\nis considered the most common serious chronic disease\nin children accounting for approximately 3 million visits\nannually [2, 3]. It is estimated that asthma affects 5% to 15%\nof the pediatric population with prevalence peaking between\nthe ages of 5\u00ad17 years [2, 4]. Further, recent research suggests\nthat the prevalence rates of asthma in children are on the\nrise; a nearly 72% increase in cases was reported between\nleading cause of hospitalizations in those under the age of\n2  \nThe course of asthma may vary in the pediatric popula-\ntion with young children, school-age children, and adoles-\ncents being managed and managing their asthma and related\nsymptoms differently. Typically younger children rely on a\nparent or caregiver to monitor their health status, coordinate\nvisits to healthcare providers, and manage medications,\nincluding rescue drugs (inhalers, nebulizers, etc.). As chil-\ndren age into adolescence, expectations change such that the\nmonitoring and management of asthma and symptoms are\nincreasingly taken on by the individual adolescent or young\nadult. At the same time that adolescents may be assuming\ngreater responsibility and control for their own asthma\nmanagement, they are being faced with the same temptations\nand motivations that their peers face to engage in \"adult-\nlike\" health-related risk behaviors. Cigarette smoking is of\nparticular concern as smoking is known to exacerbate asthma\nand directly contradicts the basic tenets of asthma education\nand health promotion efforts [6\u00ad8].\nIn the United States, each day approximately 6,000 ado-\nlescents, aged 12 to 18 years, try smoking a cigarette for the\nfirst time, and 3,000 adolescents become daily smokers [9].\nMost of these individuals do so without fully understanding\nthe health risks associated with cigarette smoking both in\nthe short and long term. In addition to being a well-\nrecognized health risk to the general population, cigarette\nsmoking exacerbates asthma and complicates management\n[6, 8, 9]. Exposure to cigarette smoke is often associated\nwith increased clinical manifestations of asthma symptoms\n(e.g., wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath) and\nan increased need for rescue medications and or medical\nmanagement [9\u00ad11]. Almost all asthma health education\nmaterials contain specific references to the hazards of\nairborne or inhaled irritants and the exacerbation of asthma\nsymptoms by cigarette use, second-hand smoke, wood\nsmoke, or fumes [7, 9]. Yet, contrary to healthcare providers'\nassumptions and \"common sense,\" there is growing evidence\nthat individuals with asthma do smoke cigarettes and that\ntheir rates of cigarette smoking may be comparable to those\nof peers who do not have asthma or another chronic illness\nA large body of research suggests that adolescents who\nparticipate in one health-risk behavior are more likely to\nengage in additional risk behaviors [9, 16, 17]. According to\nthe CDC [9], 75% of high school students report drinking\nalcoholic beverages at least once. The cooccurrence of\nalcohol consumption and cigarette smoking documented in\nthe general adolescent population is now being reported\namong chronically ill youth [18]. The impact of alcohol\nconsumption on lung and airway function is dependent\nupon concentration, duration, and route of exposure [19]. It\nhas been reported in the literature that prolonged and heavy\nexposure to alcohol may complicate asthma management\nin addition to exerting direct negative effects on lung\nfunctioning [19]. However this has not been well studied in\nindividuals who have asthma.\nRecent studies have shown that adolescents' engagement\nin health-risk behaviors may be influenced by the social\npressures from peers and by their parent role models [6,\n20, 21]. Specifically, children who have parents and friends\nwho smoke cigarettes are more likely than others to smoke\nthemselves [20]. Adolescents who smoke cigarettes may also\nbe influenced by parents or guardians who do not supervise\nthe activities of their child. Low parental monitoring has been\nassociated with high school students' reports of smoking\ncigarettes, using other tobacco products, drinking alcohol,\nand smoking marijuana [21].\n2. Materials and Methods\nThe current study represents a secondary analysis of the\npublic-use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of\nAdolescent Health (Add Health) [1]. Data were obtained\nthrough a contractual arrangement with the proprietors of\nAdd Health [1], and IRB approval was obtained prior to\nundertaking the secondary analysis. The decision to utilize\na secondary analysis for the current study was based on\nthe understanding that, in the nursing literature, the use\nof \"secondary analysis of large databases is increasingly\nrecognized as a valid and efficient method of research\"\n[22]. Using nationally representative databases provides\nopportunities to address important health issues as these\ndatabases allow researchers to study their phenomenon of\n2.1. Procedures. The original study, the National Longitudi-\nnal Study of Adolescent Health, is the largest, most compre-\nhensive survey of adolescents ever undertaken in the United\nStates and is based upon a nationally representative sample\nAdd Health contains survey data about adolescents' social\ncontexts (families, friends, peers, schools, neighborhoods,\nand communities) and how these contexts may influence\nadolescents' health and risk behaviors. The sampling design\nfor Add Health included complex, multilevel cluster sam-\npling techniques described in detail elsewhere [1, 26\u00ad28].\n2.2. Setting and Participants. Add Health researchers selected\nUnited States stratified by size, school type, census region,\nlevel of urbanization, and percent White. Fifty-two schools\nagreed to participate, and the remaining 28 were replaced\nby high schools with similar characteristics. Feeder schools\nwere also identified and included in data collection. Parental\nconsent was obtained prior to data collection [1]. Data for\nquestionnaires, school administrator questionnaires, and in-\nhome interviews with students and one of the student's\nparents (usually the mother). The in-home interview data\nwith students and parents were collected in 1995. A second\nwave (Wave II) of data was subsequently collected in 1996\n(not used in our analyses); a third wave of data (Wave III)\nat the time of Wave III, were reinterviewed to investigate their\ntransitions to young adulthood.\nThe sample for our study's secondary analysis consisted\nof 4,882 adolescents and young adults who participated\nin the Wave III survey. Eight cases from Wave III were\n  3\nTable 1: Demographic characteristics of the sample at Wave III.\nTotal sample Asthma group Without asthma group\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nOther races (non-Black, non-White) 7% 6% 7%\nSpeak language other than English at home 7% 4% 7%\nHave health problems related to allergies 57% 3%\nBiological mother with asthma 19% 7%\nBiological father with asthma 15% 5%\nsubsequently excluded due to missing data for whether or\nnot they had asthma, resulting in a final analytic sample of\n2.3. Data Collection and Analysis. All analyses were con-\nducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nFor this analysis, cross-sectional sampling weights for Wave\nIII were used on all data. Chi-squared tests were used\nfor comparisons of categorical data, and independent two-\nsample t-tests were used for continuous/numeric variables.\nAdjustments for sampling designs were made using the Rao-\nScott method [29]. Analyses were adjusted for clustering and\nweighting from the publicly available dataset, but did not\naddress the stratification, as that variable was not available\nin the public-use dataset. However, it has been reported that\nexclusion of the strata variable in the public dataset \"only\nminimally affects the standard errors\" [30].\n2.4. Measures. The current study employed measures from\nthe Wave I and Wave III questionnaires. Demographic\nmeasures from adolescents included Wave I reports of\nage, gender, race, ethnicity, and household composition.\nBackground information from parents (usually the mother)\nat Wave I included age, marital status, asthma, smoking, and\nalcohol use.\nKey measures of interest in this study included questions\nfrom Waves I and III asking about asthma status, cigarette\nsmoking, and alcohol intake. Asthma status was assessed via\nself-report by asking, \"Have you ever been diagnosed with\nasthma?\" Participants responded \"yes\" or \"no.\" Cigarette\nsmoking and alcohol consumption were assessed with two\nsets of questions. The first asked participants whether they\nhad \"ever\" tried the behavior (smoking cigarettes or drinking\nalcoholic beverages). Second, participants were asked if they\nhad \"regularly\" smoked (defined as at least one cigarette per\nday for 30 days). The response choices were \"yes\" or \"no.\"\nParticipants were also asked to rate how much alcohol they\ndrank. The question was worded, \"Think of all of the times\nyou have had a drink in the past twelve months. How many\ndrinks did you usually have each time?\"\n3. Results\nidentified as having asthma and were included in the asthma\ngroup; 4,056 were self-identified as not having asthma and\nwere included in the nonasthma group. As is shown in\nTable 1, there were no significant differences in the two\ngroups in terms of age, sex, or race. The asthma group\nincluded slightly more females, although these differences\nwere not statistically significant. However, those in the\nasthma group were more likely to speak only English in the\nhome and were less likely to have been born outside the\nUSA compared to those in the nonasthma group (P < .01\nand P < .05, resp.). Those with asthma reported having\nmore health problems related to allergies when compared\nwere more likely to have a family history of asthma (P <\ngroup had a biological mother with asthma and 15% of the\nasthma group versus 5% of the nonasthma group reported\nhaving a biological father with asthma (P < .0001 for\nboth).\n3.1. Smoking Cigarettes. Findings from Wave III indicated\nthat those with asthma had higher rates of having tried\ncigarette smoking (79%) compared to those without asthma\n(75%; P < .05). In addition, those in the asthma group\nwere more likely to become later smokers than those in the\nnonasthma group. Comparing smoking patterns at Wave I\n4  \nand Wave III for both groups found that there was an increase\nof 18% in smoking within the asthma group (they reported\nnot smoking in Wave I but responded \"yes\" to regularly\nsmoking eight years later in Wave III). As is shown in Table 2,\nthere was additional evidence (P < 0.06) that suggested those\nwith asthma were more likely to smoke regularly than those\nwithout asthma (72% versus 67%). Those in the asthma\ngroup (33%) were also more likely to report experiencing\nfeelings of moderate or intense physical relaxation when they\nbegan smoking compared to 29% of the nonasthma group\n3.2. Drinking Alcohol. Participants in the asthma group\nreported drinking behaviors that were comparable to those\nwithout asthma at both Wave I and Wave III. There were\nno significant differences between the two groups' reports.\nHowever, differences were found between the groups in\nchanges in the amount of alcohol consumption that occurred\nbetween Waves I and III. As is shown in Table 3, the asthma\ngroup drank 0.22 drinks less than their nonasthma peers\nat Wave I (early- to mid-adolescence); six-seven years later\n(Wave III; young adulthood), the asthma group reported\ndrinking 0.30 drinks more than those in the nonasthma\ngroup. This represented an increase of almost one full drink\nper episode.\nIn addition, participants in the asthma group were more\nlikely to report alcohol-related risk behaviors at Wave III,\ncompared to those in the nonasthma group. Specifically,\nparticipants with asthma were more likely to report having at\nleast one best friend who was a binge drinker (5+ drinks on a\nparticipants also reported being slightly more likely to report\nhaving a sexual situation occur after drinking alcohol than\nthe group without asthma (24% versus 21%); this finding\nwas worrisome although not statistically significant.\n4. Discussion and Clinical Implications\nThree major findings emerged from this study: (1) adoles-\ncents and young adults with asthma are smoking cigarettes\nand drinking alcohol; two behaviors that are contraindi-\ncated for individuals with asthma; (2) the asthma group\nparticipated in these health-risk behaviors at rates that were\nsimilar to their nonasthma peers during adolescence and\nat even higher rates during young adulthood; (3) those\nin the asthma group reported elevated rates of lifestyle\nrisk behaviors associated with alcohol use. The study's\nfindings have implications for nurses, nurse practitioners,\nhealth educators, and other professionals who work with\nadolescents and young adults who have asthma.\nWhen a diagnosis of asthma is made, healthcare pro-\nfessionals begin anticipatory guidance related to health\npromotion and management of asthma symptoms. Asthma\neducation focuses on identifying triggers, recommendations\nfor a healthy lifestyle, limiting exposure to allergens, use\nof medications (rescue and maintenance), and adherence\nto a holistic plan of care. Goals of asthma therapy include\nminimal or no chronic symptoms (daytime or nighttime);\nTable 2: Smoking cigarettes: asthma group and without asthma\ngroup at Wave III.\nAsthma group\nWithout asthma\ngroup\nEver experienced\nmoderate/intense relaxation\nwhen smoking\nEver smoked cigarettes regularly 72% 67%#\nTable 3: Drinking alcohol: asthma group and without asthma\ngroup at Wave III.\nAsthma group\nWithout asthma\ngroup\nHave at least one of three\nbest friends who binge\ndrink\nNumber of times\nexperiencing a sexual\nsituation later drinking at\nleast once\nminimal or no exacerbations; no limitations on physical\nactivities (no missed school or work days); minimal use of\nshort-acting inhaled Beta2-agonists; minimal or no adverse\nevents from medication [2, 9, 31]. Successful treatment of\nasthma may be impeded when other risk behaviors are\npresent particularly in the face of severe asthma [6]. Smoking\ncigarettes is recognized as a deterrent to healthy pulmonary\nfunction and would be contraindicated in any plan of care\nfor asthma.\nAdolescent cigarette smoking can be viewed within a\nbroad profile of risk factors that incorporate the desire to\ntake health risks, peer influences, parental role modeling,\nenvironment, perception of current health, and any chronic\nasthma and gauge their participation in health-risk behav-\niors, ongoing risk behavior assessments should be conducted\nat each healthcare visit. Pediatric nurses, practitioners,\nclinicians, and other healthcare professionals are in an ideal\nposition to assess the type of and level of participation in\nan adolescent or a young adult with asthma. Using open-\nended questioning is ideal for exploring what experiences\nadolescents have had with cigarettes or alcohol, how long\nthey have been smoking or drinking, how the behavior\nbegan, where they are encountering cigarettes or alcohol,\nhow they perceive their friends' participation with these\nsubstances, and what behaviors they see in their household\nwith their parents.\nIn addition to assessment, a family-centered approach\nto asthma management is important. Whether or not the\n  5\nparents or other household members smoke needs to be\nassessed [6, 7]. The potential influence of parental monitor-\ning/supervision, role modeling of risk behaviors, and access\nto cigarettes and alcohol in the home should be discussed\nwith parents. Education on risk reduction strategies and\nreferrals for smoking cessation assistance should be offered\nwhen indicated.\nReasons for smoking and how cigarettes make ado-\nlescents feel should also be assessed. For example, in the\ncurrent study those with asthma reported feeling a physical\nrelaxation from smoking and were less likely to report having\ntried to quit smoking cigarettes. Asking questions during an\nexam or taking a history specific to cigarette smoking, age\nof first cigarette, how many cigarettes they smoke a day, how\nsmoking makes he or she feel, and if they have tried to quit\nsmoking may provide insight that can direct the development\nof an individualized plan of care to decrease or cease cigarette\nsmoking.\nDrinking alcohol was also found to be a health-risk\nbehavior for the asthma group in this study. As young adults\nthe asthma group reported drinking slightly more alcohol\nthan those without asthma. In addition, they reported some-\nwhat higher rates of risky lifestyle behaviors associated with\nalcohol use. Having a friend who binge drinks, participating\nin a sexual situation after drinking alcohol, and being drunk\nat school or work (8% of the asthma group versus 6%\nof the without asthma group) are behaviors that together\nor alone raise alarms. For example, adolescents without a\nchronic illness who have alcohol-related disorders or heavy\nconsumption of alcohol have been found to be more likely\nto smoke cigarettes, less likely to exercise, and less likely\neat a balanced diet and take vitamins compared to those\nwithout alcohol use disorders [33]. Further study is needed to\nbetter understand the participation in risky lifestyle choices\nassociated with drinking alcohol and how these are affecting\nindividuals with asthma, their level of health and disease\nknowledge in addition to their commitment to a wellness\nlifestyle. Research into how much alcohol is being consumed\nby adolescents and young adults with asthma and how\ntheir alcohol intake may relate to their lung functioning,\noccurrence of respiratory infections, and use of asthma\nmedications is also essential.\nAlcohol use and cigarette smoking are complex behaviors\nwhose prevalence appears to increase with age in the general\npopulation of adolescents and young adults [2]. Our study\nfindings support this literature with similar findings in an\nat-risk population, adolescents and young adults who have\nasthma. It is not uncommon for youth with or without a\nchronic illness to want to belong and behavior as others.\nThere is a growing body of research that has found youth\nwith a chronic condition may have additional risks for\nengaging in health-risk behaviors (e.g., smoking cigarettes,\nsmoking marijuana, performing violent, or antisocial acts)\nwhen compared with healthy peers [6, 34, 35]. Our study fur-\nthers the existing literature by comparing cigarette smoking\nand alcohol consumption between those with and without\nasthma and by examining these behaviors longitudinally\nacross adolescence and the transition to young adulthood.\nThat our study found an increase in smoking cigarettes\nand drinking alcohol in an asthma population suggests\nthat continued education and health promotion by nurses\nand other healthcare professionals is imperative during this\ntransitional time period.\nThe diagnosis of asthma in our study's population was\nmade before the 7th grade, a finding that implies that the\nchild's parent or guardian was aware of the condition. In\nasthma education and management parents or guardians are\ninvolved in every aspect of health and treatment when their\nchildren are young. As children age into adolescence, asthma\nmanagement may gradually shift from parent to adolescent\nand increase the youth's accountability and responsibility\nfor his or her disease and management. Nonetheless, strong\nparental support of positive behaviors that promote health\nhas been found to be associated with lower rates of risk\nbehaviors in adolescents with health issues [17].\nIn this study behaviors of cigarette smoking and drinking\nalcohol were found during adolescence and then again six to\nseven years later during the young adult time period. Pedi-\natric nurses have an influential role in how adolescents man-\nage their health, asthma management, and risk taking behav-\niors as they age. Providing positive anticipatory guidance and\nincluding both adolescents and parents in the plan of care\nmay have a better chance of succeeding in promoting healthy\nlifestyle choices that will be with them across their lifespan.\nNurses and other healthcare providers must consider\ndirecting their health promotion and educational efforts\ntowards two areas with an asthma population: prevention\nand smoking cessation. Nurses can find time during an\nindividual's primary health visit, specialty clinic visit, school\nnurse visit, parish visit, community or home visit to\nconvey health promotion information that is focused on\nthe prevention and abstinence from smoking. There are\ncurrently numerous cessation programs designed to educate\nindividuals about the hazards of cigarette smoking and\ndrinking alcohol for healthy adolescents and young adults.\nNurses, practitioners, educators, and other professionals are\nin ideal positions to create new programs or modify existing\nones to incorporate interventions and materials that address\nthe special needs of a young, chronically ill population.\n5. Research Implications\nWe do not fully appreciate the relationships between the\ndevelopmental needs of the adolescents, the physiology\nof their health condition, and social influences of family\nand peers. Health-related behavior is complex, involving\na myriad of factors that contribute to the occurrence of\nhealth promotion and health-risk behaviors that can begin\nin adolescence and continue into adulthood. Findings from\nthis study are consistent with the broader literature on\nhealth behavior that highlights that knowledge alone and a\ndiagnosis of asthma may not account for behavior or act\nstudy supports findings from Tercyak using Add Health\nWave II data [35]. Tercyak reported that adolescents with\nasthma were just as likely to experiment with smoking in\ntheir lifetime and were significantly more likely to be current\nsmokers than their peers without asthma. Further, rates of\n6  \ncurrent smoking were higher in the asthma group (48%)\ncompared to those without asthma (42%). Given the current\nstudy findings that smoking rates continued to increase\nas youth with asthma aged, equal to or exceeding rates\nin the nonasthma group, further research should focus on\nunderstanding the factors that contribute to the adoption of\nheath-risk behaviors of this chronically ill group.\n6. Limitations\nThe study findings should be viewed in light of the study\nlimitations. Two of the most significant shortcomings in the\ncurrent study relate to the use of abbreviated measures in\nthe Add Health dataset and the omission of several clini-\ncally relevant variables. Specifically, this study relied upon\nadolescents' self-reports of having asthma. No confirmatory\nmedical diagnoses were obtained, and no data regarding\nthe severity of the asthma (e.g., mild, moderate, or severe)\nwere collected. In addition, there were no data collected\nregarding the type of asthma (e.g., reactive airway, physical\nexertion, or allergy induced). These two shortcomings are\ncommonly encountered limitations in secondary analyses\nwith large, national datasets [23\u00ad25, 37]. While these types\nof datasets provide large, representative samples, and breadth\nof data, they tend to lack detailed measures in any single area\nwell suited to this initial examination of cigarette smoking\nand alcohol use among adolescents and young adults with\nasthma.\n"
