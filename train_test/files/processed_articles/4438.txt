In\ncontrast with PPARc, agonists of PPARd are more effective\nwhen given at later stages of EAE and increase myelin gene\nexpression, suggesting effects on OL (oligodendrocyte)\nmaturation. In the present study we examined effects of\nthe PPARd agonist GW0742 on OPCs (OL progenitor cells),\nand tested whether the effects involve modulation of BMPs\n(bone morphogenetic proteins). We show that effects of\nGW0742 are mediated through PPARd since no ameliora-\ntion of EAE clinical scores was observed in PPARd-null\nmice. In OPCs derived from E13 mice (where E is embryonic\nday), GW0742, but not the PPARc agonist pioglitazone,\nincreased the number of myelin-producing OLs. This was\ndue to activation of PPARd since process formation was\nreduced in PPARd-null compared with wild-type OPCs. In\nboth OPCs and enriched astrocyte cultures, GW0742\nincreased noggin protein expression; however, noggin\nmRNA was only increased in astrocytes. In contrast,\nwith lesser effects in astrocytes.

PPARd is expressed throughout the body in most\ntissues and is the most abundant PPAR in brain (Michalik\net al., 2003). The knowledge that activation of PPARd\nregulates lipid metabolism (Basu-Modak et al., 1999;\npossibility that PPARs might regulate lipid metabolism in OLs\n(oligodendrocytes). Studies from the Skoff laboratory\n(Granneman et al., 1998) have shown that PPARd is the\nmajor PPAR isotype expressed in optic and sciatic nerve, and\nis mainly expressed in the OL population. A subsequent study\n(Saluja et al., 2001) confirmed that PPARd, but not PPARc,\nselective agonists increased OL differentiation, including\nincreasing MBP (myelin basic protein) and PLP (proteolipid\nprotein) protein and mRNA levels.\nBased on the above findings, we previously tested whether\nPPARd agonists could provide protection in EAE (Polak et al.,\n2005). We found that, in contrast with PPARa and PPARc\nagonists, treatment with a PPARd agonist did not signifi-\ncantly reduce disease severity during the early stages of EAE,\nbut instead showed benefit when given at the peak of\ndisease. This was accompanied by reductions in the\nappearance of cortical lesions, neuronal damage and glial\ninflammation. Moreover, in contrast with PPARc agonists, the\nselective PPARd agonist GW0742 did not suppress pro-\ninflammatory cytokine production from T-cells, which may\naccount for its reduced efficacy to influence early stages of\nEAE. GW0742 also caused an increase in myelin gene\nexpression in EAE brains, suggesting a distinct mechanism\nof action possibly involving effects on OL maturation or\nsurvival.\nAmong the many factors implicated in OPC (OL progenitor\ncell) maturation are members of the BMP (bone morphoge-\nnetic protein) family. BMPs were originally identified as\nextracellular factors able to induce bone formation, but were\nlater shown to be expressed in other tissues and play a role in\ndevelopment of other organs, including the nervous system\nbelong to the TGF (transforming growth factor) superfamily\nwhich, upon binding to their cognate receptors, activate\nphosphorylation of Smad proteins, which in turn bind to\nspecific promoter elements and regulate gene transcription. A\nkey gene target of BMP signalling are Id (inhibitors of\ndifferentiation) proteins similar in structure to bHLH (basic\nhelix-loop-helix) transcription factors, but lacking the DNA-\nbinding domain (Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002). Id proteins\ncan therefore form heterodimers with other bHLH proteins,\nbut the resulting complex is inactive. Both BMPs and their\ncognate receptors have been shown to be expressed by OLs\nduring normal development (Cheng et al., 2007; See and\nBMP signalling is regulated by interactions with a class of\nmolecules referred to collectively as BMP antagonists\n(Yanagita, 2005) which function primarily by direct asso-\nciation with BMPs, thereby preventing binding to BMP\nreceptors. BMP signalling has been shown to play a role in\nOL maturation and survival, since treatment with BMP\nantagonists promotes OL maturation (Mehler et al., 1997;\n2002), and the BMP antagonist noggin induced oligoden-\ndrogenesis in human embryonic stem cells (Izrael et al., 2007).\nThe ability of BMPs to reduce OL maturation is due in large\npart to formation of complexes between Id proteins and the\nbHLH proteins Olig1 (OL transcription factor 1) and Olig2\nwhich have been well characterized for their involvement in\nthe importance of this signalling system in OL maturation,\nand in view of the fact that GW0742 increased myelin\nexpression, we hypothesized that the effects of PPARd\nagonists could involve modulation of the BMP signalling\nsystem.\nIn the present study we have used PPARd-null mice to\nshow that the beneficial effects of GW0742 in EAE are\ndependent upon the presence of functional PPARd, and that\nPPARd plays a role in regulating the normal processes of OL\nmaturation. We also demonstrate that the effects of PPARd\ninvolve regulation of BMP and BMP antagonist expression in\nOPCs and astrocytes. Taken together these findings support\nthe concept that PPARd plays an important role in the normal\nmaturation of OPCs, and suggest that PPARd agonists provide\nbenefit in EAE by accelerating OPC maturation.\nAnimals\nFemale C57BL/6 mice, aged 6\u00ad8 weeks, were from Charles\nRiver Breeding. PPARd-null mice were generated as prev-\niously described (Peters et al., 2000). Pregnant Sprague\u00ad\nDawley rats were purchased from Charles River Breeding, and\nused to provide P1 (where P is post-natal day) pups. Mice\nwere maintained in a controlled 12 h:12 h light/dark environ-\nment and provided food ad libitum. All experiments were\napproved by the local IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and\nUse Committee).\nCell culture\nEnriched cultures of primary mouse or rat astrocytes were\nprepared from P1 pups using procedures described previously,\nincluding complete change of media [DMEM (Dulbecco's\nmodified Eagle's medium) containing 10% fetal calf serum\nand antibiotics] every 3 days (Dello Russo et al., 2003). The\ncells reached confluency after 7\u00ad8 days. At that time the cells\nwere shaken for 2 h to remove adhering microglia, and\novernight at 225 rev./min at 37\u00b0C to dislodge OPCs. The\nremaining cells are approximately 95% astrocytes by staining\nfor the astrocyte-specific protein GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic\nprotein), and 5% adherent microglia.\nMV Simonini and others\n2 E 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nOPCs were prepared from E13 (where E is embryonic day)\nmouse pups using a recently described method (Pedraza et al.,\n2008). In brief, E13 embryos were removed, and then washed in\ncold PBS; the cerebellum was removed and meninges dissected\naway. The tissue from six to eight brains was triturated by 40\npassages through a 1 ml pipette tip in DMEM/F12 and B27\nneuronal supplement, and then filtered through a 70 mm-pore-\nsize cell strainer. The cells were plated at the equivalent of two\nbrains per T25 flask in 8 ml of NPM (neural proliferation medium)\nEGF (epidermal growth factor; Sigma). The cells were passaged\nevery 3 days by trituration and plated at a 1:5 ratio in NPM. After\ntwo passages, the cells were mechanically dissociated with a 1 ml\npipette, then plated on to PDL (poly-D-lysine)-coated coverslips\nin NPM supplemented with 10 ng/ml bFGF (basic fibroblast\ngrowth factor) and 10 ng/ml PDGFa (platelet-derived growth\nfactor a) [this is ODM (OL differentiation medium)].\nFor the data shown in Figure 2, cells were grown for 48 h\non PDL-coated coverslips in ODM, the medium was then\nchanged, and cells grown for a further 5 days in Sato\u00ad\nBottenstein media in the absence of bFGF/PDGF, but\ncontaining 30 nM T3 and 10 mM AraC to reduce astrocyte\nproliferation, and either 10 mM of the PPARc agonist\nequivalent amount of DMSO vehicle to determine whether\nthese drugs would induce further OPC maturation.\nInduction of EAE\nEAE was actively induced in 6\u00ad8-week-old mice using synthetic\n(myelin OL glycoprotein peptide 35\u00ad55) as described\npeptide\n(MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) was purchased from Anaspec.\nMice were injected subcutaneously (two 100 ml injections into\nadjacent areas in one hind limb) with an emulsion of 300 mg\nof complete Freund's adjuvant containing 500 mg of Mycobac-\nterium tuberculosis (Difco). Immediately after MOG35\u00ad55\ninjection, the animals received an i.p. (intraperitoneal) injection\nof 200 ng of PT (pertussis toxin; List Biochemicals) in 200 ml of\nPBS. At 2 days later, the mice received a second PT injection, and\n1 week later they received a booster injection of MOG35\u00ad55\n.\nClinical assessment of EAE\nClinical signs were scored on a 5 point scale: grade 0, no clinical\nsigns; 1, limp tail; 2, impaired righting; 3, paresis of one hind\nlimb; 4, paresis of two hind limbs; 5, death.

This dose is similar\nto that previously use by our group and others for studies of\nother PPAR agonists in EAE models (Feinstein et al., 2002).\nmRNA analysis\nTotal RNA from cells and tissues was isolated using TRIzolH\nreagent (Invitrogen/Gibco); aliquots were converted into cDNA\nusing random hexamer primers, and mRNA levels estimated by\nqPCR (quantitative PCR).

Comparisons between groups were made\nusing a Student's unpaired t test. Comparisons of the number of\nstained cells in Figure 2 was done using x2 analysis. Comparison\nof clinical signs in WT (wild-type) compared with PPARd-null\nmice was performed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA\nusing data from day 25 (the start of treatment) to the end of the\nstudy (day 49). Values are means\u00a1S.E.M., and for all\ncomparisons significance was taken at P,0.05.\nRESULTS\nPPARd mediates protective effects of GW0742\nWe have previously shown that treatment of C57BL/6 mice\nwith the PPARd agonist GW0742 ameliorated clinical and\nhistological signs of EAE when administered to mice with\nmoderate disease severity (Polak et al., 2005). To confirm that\nthese effects were mediated via activation of PPARd, and not\nby off-target actions of the agonist, we tested whether\nGW0742 influenced the course of disease in PPARd-null mice\nin which endogenous PPARd is inactivated in all cells and\ntissues by insertion of the neomycin gene into the DNA-\nbinding domain. As previously observed, providing GW0742\nto WT mice at 25 days after immunization (at which time they\nshow moderate clinical signs) significantly reduced clinical\nsigns beginning approx. 15 days later (Figure 1A).\nImmunization of PPARd-null mice with MOG peptide resulted\nin a similar disease incidence and severity as WT mice,\nsuggesting that PPARd does not play a significant role in the\nearly stages of EAE. However, in contrast with the WT mice,\ntreatment with GW0742 did not effect disease progression\nfor up to 25 days of treatment (Figure 1B). This provides\nstrong evidence that the effects of GW0742 are mediated\nthrough this receptor and are not due to off-target actions.\nSince the receptor is inactivated in all cells throughout the\nbody, these results do not allow us to conclude whether the\nloss of GW0742 benefit is due to lack of PPARd from brain, or\nfrom some other tissue; however, our previous studies did not\nreveal any effect of GW0742 on splenic T-cells, suggesting\nthat lack of PPARd from brain may account for the current\nfindings.\nWe hypothesized that GW0742 could provide benefit in EAE\ninvolving effects on OL maturation or survival. To address\nthis, we first tested whether GW0742 influenced maturation\nof OPCs generated from E13 mice. These preparations are\ngrown as neurospheres, then grown on PDL-coated plates in\nmedium containing bFGF and PDGF which leads to differ-\nentiation (Pedraza et al., 2008). After 7 days growth on PDL-\ncoated slides, OPCs show little staining for MBP (Figure 2A)\nFigure 1 GW0742 does not reduce EAE symptoms in PPARd-null mice\nC57Bl/6 control mice (A) and PPARd-null (B) mice were immunized with MOG35\u00ad55\npeptide and clinical scores monitored to 50 days.\nOn day 25 the mice were split into two subgroups having comparable disease progression (the two subgroups are indicated by the\nopen and closed circles) and were provided free access to chow containing 0, control (#) or 100 p.p.m. GW0742 ($). Values are\nmeans\u00a1S.E.M. of clinical scores. The incidence of disease reached 100% in all groups by day 14; there was no difference in the\naverage day of onset (9.3\u00a10.4 compared with 10.8\u00a10.9, null compared with WT; means\u00a1S.E.M.). In the WT mice, there was a\nstatistically significant effect of GW0742 on clinical scores over time (two-way repeated measures ANOVA of day 25\u00ad49 scores,\nMV Simonini and others\n4 E 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nand the presence of numerous GFAP+-stained cells. After 5\ndays growth in GW0742, the number of GFAP-stained cells\nwas significantly increased from 13% (in vehicle-treated\nand their morphology more closely resembled that of mature\nastrocytes. In these cultures we also observed an increased\nnumber of cells stained for MBP, which increased from none\nin vehicle-treated cultures to 4% in the treated cultures\nappearance of myelin sheaths and longer processes\n(Figure 2B).

After treatment\nsignificant increase in expression of Olig1, CGT, PDGFRa and\nan increase in GalC compared with vehicle-treated cells\n(Figures 3A\u00ad3D). However, at this timepoint there was no\nchange in PLP mRNA levels (Figure 3E). Levels of PPARd were\nalso significantly increased by GW0742 (Figure 3F), as were\nlevels of the well-characterized PPARd target gene ANGPTL-4,\nalthough interestingly, not of a second target gene UCP3\n(Figures 3G and 3H).\nStaining for the early OPC marker PDGFRa confirmed that\nas indicated by an increase in cell migration (Figure 4).\nGW0742 did not modify the total number of spheres present;\nhowever, the average size of the spheres was significantly\ntotal number of cells that migrated out from the spheres was\nP,0.05) (Figures 4C and 4D), and those cells showed a\ngreater number of processes (Figures 4E and 4F).\nPPARd mediates OPC maturation\nTo determine whether endogenous PPARd plays a role in normal\nOL maturation, we prepared primary OPCs from E13 WT and\nPPARd-null mice and examined process formation under full\ndifferentiation conditions (e.g. medium containing PDGFa, bFGF\nand B27 supplement). After 7 days, WT cells had more primary\nprocesses than did PPARd-null cells (Figure 5A), and quantifica-\ntion of process number (Figure 5B) revealed that PPARd-null\ncells had significantly fewer processes per cell (2.3\u00a10.04) than\nWT cells (3.1\u00a10.1). Analysis of process distribution (Figure 5C)\nshowed a left shift in the average number of processes per cell in\nPPARd-null cells, suggesting that process maturation was not\ncompletely inhibited, but either temporally delayed or limited to\nfewer processes in the null cells.\nIn view of reports that BMPs inhibit OL maturation (Gross\nBMP antagonist expression.

In\ncontrast with OPCs, GW0742 did not increase PPARd mRNA\nlevels (Figure 9A). Interestingly, GW0742 caused a significant\nincrease in the PPARd target gene UCP3, but not in ANGPTL-4.\nConsistent with the increase in noggin mRNA, we observed a\nlarge increase in noggin staining, present in vesicular\nstructures around the nucleus of primary astrocytes treated\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study we show that PPARd is involved in the\nregulation of OPC maturation and is associated with changes\nin the expression of BMPs and BMP antagonists.

In contrast, GW0742 significantly increased\nPLP and MBP mRNA levels in EAE mice, suggesting possible\neffects on OL maturation, survival or proliferation. The\nfindings of the present study support this possibility since, in\nFigure 3 Effects of GW0742 on myelin gene and PPARd target gene expression\nMouse E13 OPCs were plated on to PDL-coated coverslips, grown for 5 days in differentiation medium, medium replaced with Sato\u00ad\nBottenstein medium, and cells grown in the absence of growth factors and in the presence of vehicle or 3 mM GW0742.

Our findings also show that\nendogenous PPARd plays a role in OPC maturation, since in\nPPARd-deficient OPCs the distribution and average number\nof processes was significantly reduced compared with WT\nOPCs. It should be noted that, despite the absence of PPARd,\nthese OPCs still developed processes and sheaths, but OPC\nmaturation was reduced, pointing to PPARd as a modulator\nof the maturation process. PPARd may be considered as a\npotential feed-forward factor along OPC maturation, even\nthough it is not yet clear at which step through the\nmaturation PPARd exerts its role.\nWe focused attention on the class of BMPs and BMP\nantagonists for several reasons. Numerous studies have\nshown a role for BMPs in regulating neural stem cell\n2007); and in restricting OPC maturation during normal\nBMP-dependent induction of Id proteins that can bind to and\ninactivate the bHLH proteins Olig1 and Olig2 (Samanta and\nKessler, 2004) which promote OPC maturation.\nRecently, it was shown that in EAE, BMP4, -6 and -7 are\nup-regulated in lumbar spinal cord; with BMP4 being the\nmost abundant mRNA detected, and being detected in\nastrocytes as well as in oligodendrocytes and macrophages\n(Ara et al., 2008). In a second related study, it was found that\nBMP4 and BMP7 were increased following lysolecithin-\ninduced demyelination, and interestingly that phosphorylated\nsuggesting that BMPs can induce astrogliosis and inhibit\nremyelination. Taken together, these findings raised the\npossibility that treatments or interventions that increase BMP\nFigure 5 PPARd deficiency reduces OPC maturation\n(A) OPCs from WT and PPARd-null mice were plated on to PDL coverslides and kept in full differentiation medium for 7 days, after\nwhich the number of primary processes per cell were counted in three different slides of each, with approx. 100 cells counted per\nslide.

Several previous studies have\nshown that PPAR agonists can influence BMP signalling. In\nhuman umbilical vein endothelial cells, pioglitazone sup-\npressed BMP2 expression (Zhang et al., 2008), several PPARc\nagonists decreased BMP2 expression in human osteoblasts\n(Lin et al., 2007), and in mouse gonadotopinoma cells,\npioglitazone reduced BMP signalling including activation of\nId1 expression and DNA synthesis (Takeda et al., 2007). In the\npresent study we extend this list by demonstrating that a\nPPARd agonist can decrease BMP2 and BMP4 expression in\nOPCs, and to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of\nany PPAR agonist increasing a BMP antagonist.\nOur results point to distinct effects of GW0742 on BMPs\nand their antagonists' in astrocytes and OPCs. In OPCs\nmRNAs with lesser effects on the BMP antagonists; in\nastrocytes the PPARd agonist had greater effects on\nexpression of the BMP antagonists noggin and gremlin, with\nsmaller effects on BMPs. The lack of significant changes in\ntogether with down-regulation of the same BMPs in\nGW0742-treated OPCs, suggests the possibility of an auto-\ncrine short-range effect of BMPs in astrocytes and OPCs. This\nmay be similar to the balance of interactions between BMPs\nand their antagonists that occur in the optic nerve which\nresult in enhanced OPC maturation (Kondo and Raff, 2004).\nThis may guarantee cellular identity for astrocytes and\nprecursor cell identity for OPCs. On the other hand, increase\nin noggin expression in astrocytes following GW0742\nFigure 7 Noggin does not co-localize with OPC markers\nMouse E13 OPCs were grown for 5 days in differentiation medium, then treated for 24 h with 3 mM GW0742 or vehicle.

Whereas increased staining could\nbe due to an overall increase in noggin expression, the fact\nthat noggin is normally released raises the possibility that\nGW0742 reduced release from astrocytes. If so, the absence\nof strong intracellular noggin staining in the OPCs could be\ndue to increased release owing to GW0742, suggesting cell-\nspecific means of regulating release. The greater increase in\nprimary astrocyte cultures compared with the astrocytes\npresent in the OPC cultures could also be due to differences\nin the maturation state of astrocytes, suggesting that only\nmore mature cells can highly express noggin.\nPrevious characterization of BMPs and BMP antagonists in\nastrocytes is limited. In optic nerve astrocytes, the mRNAs for\ngremlin, follistatin, chordin and bambi, but not noggin, were\ndetected (Wordinger et al., 2002); and noggin mRNA was\nexpressed in type 1 astrocytes in P6 rat optic nerve (Kondo\nand Raff, 2004). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated\nthat noggin was primarily expressed in astrocytes in the\ndorsal spinal cord following rhizotomy, but was absent from\nnon-injured spinal cords (Hampton et al., 2007b).\nFigure 8 Regulation of BMP and BMP antagonist expression by GW0742\nMouse E13 OPCs (A) grown for 5 days in full medium and primary rat\nastrocytes (B) were treated with 3 mM GW0742 or vehicle for 24 h, and then\nRNA was isolated and qPCR used to measure relative mRNA levels of\nindicated genes.

It has\nalso been shown that BMP2/4 is increased in ischaemic\nastrocytes (Xin et al., 2006), and that the mRNA levels of\nBMP4, but not BMP2, are increased in astrocytes after spinal\ncord injury (Chen et al., 2005), suggesting regulation\nfollowing injury. These indications that BMP levels are\nincreased under pathological conditions are consistent with\nour findings that a treatment to reduce pathology leads to a\nreduction in astroglial BMP levels.\nThe findings in the present study that agonists of PPARd\ncan down-regulate the BMP signalling system may be of\nparticular relevance during diseases such as EAE since\ninflammatory conditions have been shown to increase BMP\nsignalling. For example, in prostate cancer cells, NF-kB\n(nuclear factor kB) binds to the BMP2 promoter and induces\nBMP2 expression, and in chondrocytes, TNFa (tumour necrosis\nfactor a) induces BMP2 (Fukui et al., 2006), most probably by\nalso binding to the BMP2 promoter (Feng et al., 2003). It is\nknown that certain cytokines including TNFa and IFNc, which\nare present in the EAE brain, cause reversible inhibition of\nOPC proliferation and maturation (Agresti et al., 1996), and\nthat neurogenesis is sensitive to the inflammatory milieu\nand that chronic inflammation can reduce neurogenesis\nWhitney et al., 2009). Therefore, in addition to direct effects\non BMPs and BMP antagonists, it is likely that PPARd down-\nregulates BMP signalling by attenuating inflammatory\nactivation, as it has been shown to do in different cells and\nIn summary, the results of the present study confirm that\nPPARd mediates the effects of the synthetic agonist GW0742\nin EAE and also plays a role in normal OPC maturation.\nTreatment with GW0742 regulates both BMP, as well as BMP\nantagonist, expression in astrocytes and OPCs, although with\ndistinct effects. The molecular mechanisms underlying the\nability of PPARd agonists to modulate BMP and BMP\nantagonist regulation could involve both direct effects on\ntranscription via binding to PPAR-responsive elements, and\nindirect effects due to anti-inflammatory actions which could\nreduce inflammatory up-regulation of BMPs. The recent\ndemonstration that PPARc agonists can be protective in\nrelapsing/remitting MS patients (Kaiser et al., 2009), together\nwith the observations that PPARd agonists promote OPC\nmaturation, suggests that clinical trials of pure or mixed\nPPAR agonists may be of therapeutic value in the treatment\nof MS.\n"
