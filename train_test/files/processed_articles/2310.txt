Further change is expected\nas recent federal legislation is implemented.4 Therefore,\nwe sought to describe the prevalence and management\nof substance use disorders in ambulatory care in a na-\ntionally representative sample.\nMethods. We analyzed data from the National Ambula-\ntory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hos-\npital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from\nnationally representative cross-sectional surveys of am-\nbulatory visits administered by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS).5,6 Survey data include up to 3\ndiagnoses coded using the International Classification of\nDiseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-\nCM) and up to 3 reasons for the visit coded using the\nNCHS Reason for Visit Classification. We identified vis-\nits by individuals 18 years or older in which a diagnosis\nor complaint of an alcohol or drug use disorder (de-\nfined as dependence, abuse, withdrawal, or intoxica-\ntion) was recorded. We defined pharmacotherapy as the\nprovision of any 1 of 5 medications approved by the US\nFood and Drug Administration for alcohol or opioid use\ndisorders: buprenorphine, methadone, acamprosate, di-\nsulfiram, and naltrexone.3 We defined psychosocial\ntherapy as the provision of psychotherapy, mental health\ncounseling, or stress management. We evaluated differ-\nences in proportions with the 2 test and trends with the\nCochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. We used multivariable lo-\ngistic regression to identify predictors of management,\nadjusting for patient- and practice-level characteristics\nas well as time period. We performed analyses using SAS\nversion 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) and SAS-callable SUDAAN\nrelease 10.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute) to account\nfor the complex survey design.\nResults. We analyzed 8930 visits, representing an esti-\nmated 42.2 million adult visits involving substance use\nVisits increased 70% over this period, from 10.6 million\nPhysicians prescribed pharmacotherapy in 6.3 mil-\nlion visits, representing 15% of all substance use disor-\nder visits.

Physicians provided psychosocial\ntherapy in an estimated 24.9 million visits, representing\n59% of all visits. This proportion did not change signifi-\ncantly over time (P=.87). In multivariable models, time\nperiod was independently associated with pharmaco-\never, neither therapy was provided in 15.4 million vis-\nits, accounting for 36% of visits and not varying signifi-\ncantly over time (P=.76).\nComment. In this nationally representative sample of adult\nambulatory visits, visits involving a substance use dis-\noid use disorders accounted for a markedly increased share\nof visits over time. This finding is consistent with trends\nin substance use disorder\u00adrelated utilization at the na-\ntion's community health centers and emergency depart-\nments and, sadly, use of its morgues.2,7,8 Our study pro-\nvides reason for optimism, however. Visits involving\nprovision of pharmacotherapy increased as well, likely\ndriven by the use of buprenorphine. Increasing recog-\nnition of previously undiagnosed disorders, improving\nfamiliarity with and use of available medications, and more\nfrequent ambulatory care by individuals with substance\nuse disorders all likely contribute to the trend of increas-\ning visits over time. As millions of visits did not involve\ntreatment, there remains both an opportunity and a need\nfor further expansion of treatment within ambulatory\nsettings.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the cross-\nsectional, visit-based nature of the data precludes causal\ninferences. Residual confounding is possible, and un-\nderdiagnosis is likely. Finally, the NAMCS/NHAMCS lacks\ndetailed clinical information, so we could not assess the\nappropriateness of management decisions by health care\nproviders.\nThe Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act\nwill provide increased support for the management of sub-\nstance use disorders in ambulatory settings.4 Our study\nprovides an important assessment of the national im-\npact of substance use disorders in ambulatory care at a\ntime when these laws have the potential to transform the\nUS health care system's ability to care for the millions of\nAmericans struggling with these disorders.\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of General Medicine and\nPrimary Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital (Drs Frank,\nAyanian, and Linder); Department of Health Care Policy\n(Dr Ayanian), Harvard Medical School (Drs Frank and\nLinder); and Department of Health Policy and Manage-\nment, Harvard School of Public Health (Dr Ayanian); Bos-\nton, Massachusetts.\nCorrespondence: Dr Frank, Division of General Medi-\ncine and Primary Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital,\n@partners.org).\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Frank had full access to all of\nthe study data, which are publicly available from the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics, and takes responsi-\nbility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the\ndata analysis.
