Nickerson, PhD\nBackground--Increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Previous\nstudies have suggested that genetic variation within the CRP gene is associated with serum CRP.\nMethods and Results--We genotyped CRP genetic variants in 7159 individuals from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III is American population-based sample linked to hundreds\nof phenotypes, including CRP; however, the CRP assay used in this survey is not a high-sensitivity CRP assay, and 65%\nof participants (n4679) had CRP measurements at or below the level of detection. Despite these limitations, we\nidentified specific CRP single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes associated with serum CRP levels in\nthe general population. Two variants were associated with increased levels of serum CRP: SNP rs3093058 (in linkage\ndisequilibrium with a CRP promoter SNP rs3093062) in the non-Hispanic black sample and the triallelic promoter SNP\nrs3091244 in the non-Hispanic black and Mexican American samples. Two other SNPs were associated with decreased\nThree haplotypes inferred from 7 SNPs (ATTGCGA, TTAGCGA, and AAAGAGA) were associated (P0.01) with\nincreased levels of serum CRP in the non-Hispanic black sample; 2 haplotypes (ATTGCGA and AAAGCGA) were\nassociated (P0.05) with increased levels in the Mexican American sample; and 1 haplotype (AAAGCGA) was\nassociated (P0.03) with increased levels in the non-Hispanic white sample. Post hoc analysis suggests that the AA\ngenotype of the triallelic SNP rs3091244, after adjustment for covariates, was associated with prevalent coronary heart\ndisease in the non-Hispanic white population sample.\nConclusions--Genetic variation within CRP is associated with serum CRP levels in the general population and may be\nKey Words: C-reactive protein  epidemiology  genes  genetics  inflammation  population\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of\ndeath in the United States1 and is a significant source of\nmorbidity and economic burden in the general population.\nGenes that affect lipid concentrations or are involved in\ninflammation have long been suspected to be involved in the\ndevelopment of CHD.2 Until recently,3,4 candidate gene\nassociation studies have mostly failed to identify a consistent\nrelationship between genetic variation and the development\nof CHD.5,6 The lack of a consistent association could be\naccounted for by several factors, including genetic heteroge-\nneity, unaccounted environmental factors, and inadequate sample\nsize. In addition, most early studies examined a single genetic\npolymorphism within a candidate gene, a design that assumes that\nthe polymorphism under study is directly involved in the expression\nof the phenotype or is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the\npolymorphism responsible for a proportion of the phenotype.7\nTo overcome the limitations afflicting most genetic asso-\nciation studies, we applied candidate gene variation data to\nFrom the Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle (D.C.C., J.D.S., C.S., M.W., L.W., M.J.R., D.A.N.), and Harris\nCorporation/National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, Hyattsville, Md (C.L.S., X.Q.).

NHANES III,\nnow one of the largest American population-based collections\nof DNAs linked to an extensive battery of phenotypic and\ndemographic data available. Thus, DNA from NHANES III,\nwhen coupled with high-throughput sequencing and genotyp-\ning technologies, is an ideal and powerful resource for\npresent-day genetic association studies.\nWe focus our present investigation on the factors that\nsignificantly influence serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels,\nboth genetic and environmental, in NHANES III. CRP is an\nindependent risk factor for CHD,8\u00ad10 and recent evidence\nsuggests that lowering CRP levels reduces the rate of athero-\nsclerosis progression11 and decreases the risk of recurrent\ncardiovascular events.12 Given its growing importance in\npotentially predicting and/or preventing cardiovascular\nevents, identifying the genetic variants that significantly\naffect CRP levels is an important step in understanding a\npossible target for CHD prevention. By combining NHANES\nIII with strategies to represent common genetic variation\nwithin the CRP gene,13 we can report here the significant\nassociation of genetic variants within CRP and CRP levels in\nNHANES III. We also estimate the proportion of CRP\nvariance explained by CRP single-nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs) and haplotypes in a population-based setting and\nassociated with prevalent CHD.\nMethods\nParticipants\nNHANES III is a nationally representative sample of noninstitution-\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC). Ascertainment and survey design\nhave been previously described.14,15 Briefly, NHANES III is a\ncomplex, multistaged survey that oversampled minorities (non-\nHispanic blacks and Mexican Americans), children, and the elderly.\nSample weights are provided for each individual included in the\nsurvey to correct for nonresponse and to correct for the fact that each\nindividual was not selected for the survey with equal probability.\nParticipants were asked to complete a household interview and a\nphysical examination in the Mobile Examination Center. If the\nparticipant could not visit the Mobile Examination Center, a special\nhome physical examination was arranged.\nDNA from the genetic component of the NHANES survey was\ngenerated using cell lines created from blood samples of participants\ntotal number of participants from NHANES III phase 2 was 16 530.\nThe sample weights were recalculated using previously described\nmethods16 for the 7159 participants for whom DNA was available to\navoid nonresponse bias. The present study was approved by the CDC\nEthics Review Board and the University of Washington Human\nSubjects Committee.\nLaboratory Measures\nCRP was measured in NHANES III participants using a modification\nof the Behring latex-enhanced CRP assay (Behring Diagnostics,\nWestwood, Mass) as previously described.17,18 Glucose was mea-\nsured using a modified hexokinase enzymatic method. Total choles-\nterol and triglycerides were measured enzymatically. High-density\nlipoprotein was measured after other lipoproteins were precipitated\nusing a polyanion/divalent cation. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C\n)\nwas measured using ion exchange chromatography. Details of the\nlaboratory protocols for each of these measures have been pub-\nlished19 and can be found on the CDC National Center for Health\nStatistics website at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes3/\nSequencing, tagSNPs, and Genotyping\nAs previously reported, the CRP gene (6.8 kb), including all exons,\nintrons, 1.7 kb upstream, and 2.8 kb downstream, was resequenced in\nDNA samples available through the Coriell Cell Repositories (http://\nlocus.umdnj.edu/ccr/) by the SeattleSNPs Program for Genomic\nApplications (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) for genetic\nvariation discovery in 23 and 24 Americans of European and African\nthe African-American sample and 12 in the European-American\nsample.20,21 All SNPs and genotypes from this resequencing effort\nare available on the SeattleSNPs website (http://pga.gs.washington.\nedu) and dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).\nWe used the LDSelect software at default settings (r20.64) to\nselect tagSNPs from all common variation within CRP (10% minor\nallele frequency).13 Because LD varies across different popula-\ntions,22,23 tagSNPs were determined for the European- and African-\ndescent samples separately, and the results were combined to\ndetermine the optimum set of tagSNPs that represent both population\nsamples. Recent evidence suggests that this optimum set of tagSNPs\nalso represents common CRP variation in a Mexican sample.21 A\nSNP (Leu184Leu) previously reported to be associated with CRP\nAll 9 SNPs for CRP were genotyped in 7159 NHANES III\nsamples by a single laboratory. The location of all SNPs and the\nallele frequencies are given in Table I of the online Data Supplement.\nSeven SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan Assays by Design\n(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) under standard condi-\nEclipse Probe Systems (Epoch Biosciences, Bothel, Wash). The\nIndividuals determined to be heterozygous by TaqMan Assays by\nDesign for the rare SNP Gly166Glu were confirmed by resequenc-\ning. The overall average genotyping success rate for the NHANES\nIII samples was 95%. For quality control and quality assurance, two\n96-well plates were provided that contained duplicate samples and\nno template controls. The genotyping error rate based on the blind\nquality control and quality assurance plates was 1%, and there was\nno evidence of contamination. All genotypes for NHANES III are\ndeposited in a database maintained by the NCHS\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nh3data_genetic.htm).\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were completed using SAS/Genetics 9.1 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC) and SUDAAN 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC). Haplotypes were inferred from tagSNPs using\nthe expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm provided by SAS/\nGenetics 9.1, which also provides the probabilities for each individ-\nual's inferred haplotype pair for subsequent regression analyses.\nCommon haplotypes (5% frequency) were determined from most\nlikely pair of haplotypes inferred by the EM algorithm and are listed\nin supplementary Table II by race/ethnicity.\nWhen appropriate, variables were transformed using the natural\nlog to create a more normal distribution. Univariate and multiple\nregressions were performed in which ln(CRP) was the dependent\nvariable. NHANES III participants with CRP levels below the limit\nof detection were coded as having a CRP level of 0.21 mg/dL. Most\ncovariates included in the model were previously reported in the\nCrawford et al Genetic Variation Is Associated With Serum CRP 2459\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nvariables are treated as continuous variables in the present study:\nage, total cholesterol (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (mg/dL),\ntriglycerides (mg/dL), glucose (mg/dL), glycosylated hemoglobin,\nsystolic blood pressure (mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg),\nand body mass index (kg/m2). Total cholesterol serves as a proxy for\nlow-density lipoprotein because it was not available for all partici-\npants. In addition, glycosylated hemoglobin is used rather than the\nglucose tolerance test because the latter was performed only on the\nmorning samples of participants who fasted.31 Smoking status was\ncoded as a categorical variable in which current smokers were\nindividuals who answered \"yes\" to the question, \"Do you smoke\ncigarettes now?\" or who had cotinine levels 15 ng/mL. Alcohol\nconsumption was coded as a categorical variable (135 drinks per\nweek, 235 drinks per week. Prevalent CHD was determined by\nself-reported myocardial infarction or angina pectoris and treated as\na categorical variable. Education was defined as having 0 to 8, 9 to\n12, or 12 years of education and was treated as an ordinal variable.\nSelf-described race/ethnicity was classified as non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other.\nFor all regression analyses, pregnant women were excluded\nCRP model, all variables listed above were allowed to enter the\nmodel for the multivariate regression. We also included interaction\nterms (gender-by-triglycerides and gender-by\u00addiastolic blood pres-\nsure). We excluded glucose because this variable had a substantial\namount of missing data in NHANES III because of fasting require-\nments. Systolic blood pressure was excluded because this measure,\nalthough significant, did not contribute substantially to the model.\nProbability values also were calculated using the Satterthwaite\nmethod. The Taylor series was implemented for the variance\nestimation method, and standard errors were calculated using a\nGenetic covariates were added to the model in 3 different ways:\ndominant (genotypes coded as 0 or 1, where 0 is homozygous for the\nmajor allele and 1 is heterozygous plus homozygous for the minor\nallele), general genotype (all genotypes), or haplotypes (7 tagSNPs\nphased). Models including SNPs as covariates are reported for each\nof which had 5 heterozygous individuals identified) adjusted for\nnon-CRP covariates. For the model including haplotypes, we used\nthe probabilities of correct haplotype inference provided by the EM\nalgorithm to adjust for haplotype uncertainty in the model. There-\nfore, each haplotype was considered a continuous variable to account\nfor the uncertainty in haplotype inference by the EM algorithm.\nBecause haplotypes inferred from the same tagSNPs were found to\nbe associated with CRP levels in a previous report,20 we chose to\ninclude the same major 8 haplotypes (H1 through H8) in the models\nin an attempt to replicate and further define these associations using\nour data set. To test for associations between prevalent CHD and\nCRP tagSNPs and haplotypes, logistic regressions were performed\nafter adjustment for covariates, including CRP levels.\nAll regression models, including genetic covariates, were stratified\nby race/ethnicity for 2 reasons. First, tests for effect modification\nbetween the race/ethnicity and CRP SNP covariates were significant\nethnicity is significant in all models when included as a covariate in\nthe multivariate regressions (data not shown). Second, stratification\nby race/ethnicity takes into account differing population demography\nand history that ultimately affect the structure of LD across the\nhuman genome.22,23 Because SNPs were chosen for genotyping on\nthe basis of r2, any resulting association must be interpreted within\nthe context of a population with a population history or demography\nsimilar to that from which the original tagSNP collection was\nderived. When population structure is ignored, the designation\n\"tagSNP\" for the genotyped SNP is no longer valid, and the ability\nto trace the association to the putative causal SNP is lost.\nC.L.

All authors have read and\nagree to the manuscript as written.\nResults\nThe NHANES III phase 2 study participants included in the\ngenetic portion of the study are described in Table 1.\nApproximately 50% of the study participants were female,\nand the overall mean age was 40.8 years. The mean CRP level\nmajority of CRP levels measured (4679) were below or at the\nlevel of detection. We found that 3.38% of the participants\nhad self-reported myocardial infarction or angina pectoris.\nUnivariate regressions were performed for each variable listed\nin Table 1. All covariates except alcohol consumption were\nsignificantly associated with serum CRP levels (P0.01). Mul-\ntiple regressions were then performed to determine the final\nmodel for non-CRP factors that affect CRP levels in NHANES\nIII. All variables listed in Table 1 except for glucose, alcohol\nconsumption, and systolic blood pressure remained in the final\nnon-CRP model (supplementary Table III). On the basis of\nprevious findings,20 first-order interactions (gender-by-triglycer-\nides and gender-by\u00addiastolic blood pressure) also were included\nin the final model. Collectively, non-CRP factors account for\nless than a quarter of the total variance in CRP levels (supple-\nTABLE 1.

Surprisingly, the association of the AT genotype with\nprevalent CHD was in the opposite direction (OR, 0.10; 95% CI,\nplementary Table VIII). These associations, however, should be\ninterpreted with caution because the number of cases with the\nAA or AT genotype (each n5) compared with the referent CC\npopulation sample was very small.

These haplotypes are identical to haplotypes H5, H6,\nH7, and H8 described by Carlson et al,20 who reported that all\nwere associated with increased CRP levels in the Coronary\nArtery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study.\nHere, all 4 haplotypes also are associated with increased levels\nof serum CRP (Table 3).

Although associations between CRP vari-\nants and CRP levels could be identified by genotyping\nmodeling both SNP and haplotype associations because neither\napproach alone is sufficient to identify as many of the genetic\nvariants as possible that contribute significantly to the variance\nof the phenotype for different populations.\nAlthough the present study has been successful in identifying\ngenetic variants that contribute to CRP levels in the general\npopulation, the overall contribution of these variants is small\ncompared with already known contributors such as body mass\nindex. The variance for CRP levels explained by CRP haplo-\ntypes is 5% for all population studies here. These estimates are\nsimilar to estimates from other cohorts for CRP haplo-\nof CRP haplotypes are far lower than the recent estimates for\nVKORC1 haplotypes, which explain 25% of the variance in\nDespite the fact that the genetic contributions measured here\nare very small, the possibility of larger genetic contributions yet\nto be discovered is still real because the full CRP genetic model\nleaves most of the variance unexplained (80%). In addition,\nheritability estimates suggest that 20% to 60% of the variance\nin basal CRP levels can be attributable to genetics.43,49\u00ad51 CRP is\n1 component of a complex acute-phase response that involves\nseveral genes, including its transcriptional regulators IL-6 and\nIL1B and the protein kinase C pathway.52,53 Preliminary studies\nciated with CRP levels, but the associations are somewhat\ninconsistent,43,56,58 and the size of the contribution is unclear.\nNevertheless, it may be that genes in these CRP regulatory\npathways have a greater impact on CRP levels in the general\npopulation compared with genetic variants within CRP, warrant-\ning further study of CRP-related pathways in large population-\nbased surveys such as NHANES III.\nThe study presented here has several strengths and limitations.\nThe major strength of the present study is the use of a large,\npopulation-based survey and its uniformly collected laboratory and\nexamination variables. This comprehensive data set allows exami-\nnation of both genetic and environmental variables in several\npopulation samples that contribute to the phenotype of interest.\nA limitation is that the measure of CRP is not the high-\nsensitivity test now available for investigation. The test used for\nNHANES III has a lower limit of 0.21 mg/dL, which makes the\ndistribution for NHANES III truncated at the lower limit of the\nmeasure. Despite this limitation in phenotype resolution, we\nwere able to confirm that CRP genetic variants are associated\nwith serum CRP levels. Another limitation is that CRP levels\nwere measured only once in this cross-sectional study and could\npossibly have changed if a second measurement were taken.\nHowever, on the basis of recent results from CARDIA that\ndemonstrated that CRP levels are stable when compared at\ndifferent time points several years apart,20 we do not anticipate\nthat a second measurement of CRP levels would be significantly\ndifferent than the original measurement in NHANES III.\nFinally, only prevalent CHD could be measured in this\ncross-sectional study, and the total number of reported events\namong NHANES III participants was low (n250), decreasing\nour power to identify meaningful associations. Surprisingly, we\nwere able to identify a significant association between the\nCrawford et al Genetic Variation Is Associated With Serum CRP 2463\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nHispanic white population sample after adjusting for covariates\nin a post hoc analysis.
