We employ a vector autoregression (VAR) model\nto estimate the dynamic effects of asset purchase programs on the macroeconomy and\nfinancial markets. The identification strategy we propose is novel in the literature and\nwell-suited to consider possible side effects on financial markets. Compared to existing\nempirical studies, our approach is explicitly agnostic about the effects of policy measures\non financial markets because we refrain from restricting the respective responses ex ante.\nRecent economic developments within the euro area macroeconomy have led the Eu-\nropean Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem1 to develop new tools in order to fulfill\ntheir mandate and keep inflation stable. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in\nSeptember 2008, financial markets in many countries experienced turbulent times, impair-\ning bank lending and monetary policy transmission. Due to increased uncertainty, the\ninterbank market was disrupted, which induced liquidity stress for the banking system.2\nBank lending to non-financial firms declined, which had severe consequences for the real\neconomy. Output dropped sharply and inflation rates fell below the ECB's definition of\nprice stability. In a situation with policy rates approaching the zero lower bound, the\nECB had to consider new measures, among which it implemented several asset purchase\nprograms and other lending schemes in the following years aiming to provide banks with\nliquidity and to improve bank lending. The euro area sovereign debt crisis emerged in\nlate 2009, which again induced pressure on financial markets and made new policy actions\nnecessary.\nWhile the transmission channel of conventional interest rate policy is well understood\nand many \u00ad empirical as well as theoretical \u00ad studies exist on that topic, the effects of the\ndiverse set of unconventional measures, of which balance sheet policy is one particular\nexample, are still being explored. There is, as yet, no consensus to what extent those\nmeasures are effective in bringing inflation and output back to their target levels, or\nwhether any unintended side effects unfold particularly within financial markets.\nThere is a small but growing literature on the effects of non-standard policies on\nthe macroeconomy.3 Some studies approach the question with event studies like Eser\nand Schwaab (2016), who show that the Securities Market Programme (SMP) had a\nsignificant impact on sovereign bond yields. They consider common factors to control\nfor aggregate developments. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) show that in\nthe US, the quantitative easing programs QE1 and QE2 were both effective in lowering\nnominal interest rates, but the magnitude of the effect differs across asset classes. Lambert\nand Ueda (2014) consider US banks and their reaction to policy news. They do not find\na positive effect on bank returns, while bank credit risk increases over the medium term.\nSzczerbowicz (2015) shows the effectiveness of different unconventional measures in the\neuro area. In particular, the interconnectedness between banks and sovereigns amplifies\n1For convenience, in the following we will not explicitly mention the Eurosystem but use `ECB' as an\nabbreviation for the institutions responsible for monetary policy decisions in the euro area.\n2See for instance Rixtel and Gasperini (2013), Abbassi, Bruning, Fecht, and Peydr\u00b4\nHeijmans, Heuver, Massarenti, Picillo, and Vacirca (2016).\n3An assessment of the ECB's asset purchase programs, for example, can be found in Andrade, Breck-\nenfelder, De Fiore, Karadi, and Tristani (2016).\nthe effect of policy announcements.\nWhile those studies distinguish specific purchase programs and focus an impact ef-\nfects, they cannot estimate a dynamic effect on the aggregate economy. In this respect,\nCasiraghi, Gaiotti, Rodano, and Secchi (2013) use a combination of two strategies. They\ninvestigate the effects of the SMP, Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) and Longer\nTerm Refinancing Operations (LTROs) within an event study. Subsequently, they feed\ntheir results into a macroeconomic model of the Italian economy. They find that the SMP\nas well as the OMTs were effective in decreasing government bond yields, while LTROs\nimproved lending conditions. K\u00a8\nuhl (2016) shows in a DSGE analysis that government\nbond purchases are beneficial with respect to economic activity especially if financial fric-\ntions are more \"severe\". Lenza, Pill, and Reichlin (2010) estimate a Bayesian VAR model\nand compute counterfactual developments of key macroeconomic variables. They show\nthat monetary policy in exceptional times, represented by central bank liquidity man-\nagement, is effective. Notably, their analysis refers to the fixed rate full allotment policy\nof the ECB and therefore highlights demand-driven liquidity provisioning of the banking\nsystem. Gambacorta, Hofmann, and Peersman (2014) apply a mean group estimator to a\ncross-country VAR model to show that balance sheet expansions have a positive effect on\noutput and prices. They consider information from eight currency areas, which helps them\nto overcome the problem of a relatively short sample. Peersman (2011) compares con-\nventional interest rate policy responses to unconventional balance sheet policy. He finds\nthat both measures have a positive effect on output and prices, while the transmission of\na balance sheet expansion is more sluggish. However, the analysis cannot distinguish ex-\nogenous policy shocks from endogenous demand-driven effects originating in the banking\nsector. Similarly, Darracq Pari`\nes and De Santis (2013) use information in the Bank Lend-\ning Survey in order to compute dynamic effects of a credit supply shock. They show that\nthe ECB's 3-year LTRO program from December 2011 is expansionary with respect to\noutput and inflation. Bluwstein and Canova (2016) find important cross-country spillover\neffects of unconventional policy measures taken by the ECB.\nOur analysis is related to the work of Peersman (2011), Gambacorta et al. (2014),\nand Boeckx, Dossche, and Peersman (2017), who investigated the effects of balance sheet\nshocks at an aggregate level. In particular, Boeckx et al. (2017) set up a VAR model and\nconsider the dynamic effects of the ECB's balance sheet policies. Their analysis focuses\non non-financial macroeconomic developments. They show that an increase in the ECB\nbalance sheet has a positive effect on output, prices, and bank lending. In general, they\nfind favorable macroeconomic effects, with heterogeneity among euro area countries. To\nidentify an expansionary balance sheet shock, they impose a negative reaction of euro area\nfinancial stress. Weale and Wieladek (2016) identify an `asset purchase announcement\nshock' (as opposed to an uncertainty shock) by requiring real stock prices to rise.\nOur contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we use a novel identification strat-\negy for the policy shock. It requires an ECB balance sheet expansion through particular\nbalance sheet items but is agnostic with respect to financial market variables. Since\nwe are particularly interested in the response of financial stress, we do not restrict this\nvariable in our identification scheme. We find favorable effects of balance sheet policies\nwith respect to financial stress and output within the first year. Thereafter, the effect on\noutput vanishes, while financial stress increases above its pre-shock level. The identified\neffect on prices is subject to a high degree of uncertainty; impulse responses can hardly\nbe distinguished from zero. Output, inflation and financial stress respond much more\nstrongly to a financial stress shock than to an asset purchase shock.\nSecond, we add to the literature a country-specific impact study, with a focus on\nthe German economy. Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2014) have shown\nthat the ECB's SMP and OMT were successful in reducing government bond yields in\nperiphery countries. We show that macroeconomic effects in Germany are similar to\nthose in the euro area as a whole: output rises, while prices do not respond. Financial\nstress, however, falls only initially. Over the medium run, the composite stress indicator\nactually increases, together with market risk aversion. While corporate lending does not\nincrease significantly, implicit default rates rise and write-offs go down, which may reflect\nan increase in risky lending as banks avoid writing off questionable loans.4\nWe note that our approach, which focuses on macroeconomic time series data, applies\nto lower frequencies and therefore generally does not pick up announcement effects that\nmight be visible at higher frequencies. However, as pointed out by Bluwstein and Canova\n(2016), event studies which employ high-frequency data cannot capture macroeconomic\neffects. Data may be more noisy, which potentially affects results.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our data set\nand gives a brief outline of the recent policy measures in the euro area. Section 3 describes\nthe econometric framework, as well as our identifying assumptions. The estimation results\nare discussed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.\n2 Data and the ECB balance sheet\nWe use time series data from July 2009 until March 2016. The short time period makes it\nnecessary to consider monthly observations in order to have sufficient information available\nto estimate the VAR model. While there exist monthly data before July 2009, it is\nimportant for our analysis to focus on the particular episode where the ECB injected\nliquidity through asset purchase programs. The following paragraph gives a short overview\nof the recent actions undertaken in response to the financial crisis and the European\nsovereign debt crisis.5 Figure 1 shows the evolution of the ECB's balance sheet item\n\"securities held for monetary policy purposes\" (SHMPP), which comprises assets affected\nby the purchase programs, as well as the sum of main refinancing operations (MROs)\nand longer term refinancing operations (LTROs). This distinction of balance sheet items\nis central for our structural shock identification as it helps us to distinguish exogenous\npolicy measures from endogenous balance sheet expansions.\nDuring the sample period, the ECB conducted several asset purchase programs in\norder to stabilize bank lending and to maintain a functioning monetary transmission\nmechanism. The ECB argues that purchase programs aim to bring inflation back to\nlevels comformable with the definition of price stability.6 Consequently, the effect on\nprices and output should appropriately reflect the effectiveness of the new measure. At\n4We use a confidential series on implicit firm defaults. Further information on this series can be found\n5For a more detailed exposition, see Szczerbowicz (2015) who provides a timeline of the ECB's deci-\nsions, announcements and the design of policy measures.\n6See e.g. https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html.\nMRO+LTRO vs securities held for monetary purposes (in bn Euro)\nSHFMPP\nFigure 1: Evolution of the sum of the ECB balance sheet items \"main refinancing opera-\ntions\" and \"longer term refinancing operations\", and \"securities held for monetary policy\npurposes\".

The total aggregate\nvalue of the purchase program was 60 billion euros. Even though the first Covered Bond\nPurchase Programme (CBPP1) ended in June 2010, there is still a significant fraction of\nthose assets on the ECB balance sheet.\nIn May 2010, the Eurosystem started the SMP where it bought securities for 230 billion\neuros. The second Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP2) was conducted between\nIn November 2014, national central banks started the Asset-Backed Securities Purchase\nProgramme (ABSPP). One month later, the third Covered Bonds Purchase Programme\n(CBPP3) was introduced and proposed to be conducted until June 2016. Finally, in March\n2015 the Public Sector Purchase Programme was launched. The Eurosystem planned to\nbuy a monthly aggregate volume of 60 billion euros under the ABSPP, the CBPP3 and\nthe PSPP. The PSPP represents the most important component of the Asset Purchase\nthe Corporate Sector Purchase Programme has been appended to the APP. In December\n2016, the Eurosystem decided to switch back to a monthly volume of 60 billion euros in\nPrior to these measures, the ECB announced a fixed rate full allotment policy in\nOctober 2008. At a predetermined interest rate, it allows banks to obtain as much liquidity\nas needed, given adequate collateral. The full allotment policy aims at improving the\nliquidity position of banks and it works through MROs and LTROs. One may argue that\nduring the time frame considered, MROs and LTROs can, to some extent, be regarded as\nunconventional policy measures as well, especially because of the full allotment policy. Our\nanalysis distinguishes asset purchase programs from other unconventional policy measures.\nWith respect to the aforementioned measures, we separate two types of instruments\nthat affect the balance sheet of the ECB through different positions. We label the first\none direct asset purchases. This shock induces an expansion of the ECB balance sheet\nitem \"Securities Held for Monetary Policy Purposes\",while it does not positively affect\nmain- and longer term refinancing operations. The second represents endogenous liquid-\nity provisioning and induces expansions of the balance sheet items \"Main Refinancing\nOperations\" and \"Longer Term Refinancing Operations\". While the first instrument is\nused by the central bank in a discretionary fashion, the second adjusts to the liquidity\ndemand of the financial sector and is therefore endogenous. The distinction is crucial for\nour identification scheme, which we explain in Section 3.2. In general, the aim of the as-\nset purchase programs was to encourage bank lending in order to repair the transmission\nchannel of monetary policy and ultimately to bring inflation back to a value of below (but\nFor the baseline specification of the VAR model we consider the MRO rate to represent\nthe conventional monetary policy instrument. The monthly data frequency does not\nallow us to directly use GDP as a measure of output or economic activity. We instead\ninterpolate the quarterly series using the Chow and Lin (1971) method on the basis of the\nmonthly industrial production index.8 Euro area prices are measured by the harmonized\nindex of consumer prices (HICP); for Germany, we use the consumer price index (CPI).\nIn order to measure financial stress in the euro area, we use the Composite Indicator\nof Systemic Stress (CISS) proposed by Holl\u00b4\no, Kremer, and Lo Duca (2012), while for\nthe German case we use the comparable Bundesbank Stress Indicator for the German\nFinancial System. Most of the data are publicly available, where the main data sources\nare the ECB Statistical Data Warehouse (SDW) and the Bundesbank.9 More detailed\ninformation on the data is provided in Table A.1 of the Appendix.\n3 VAR Model\nWe analyze the effects of monetary policy with a vector autoregression model, where we\nemploy a novel set of identifying assumptions on the asset purchase shock. The VAR\nallows us to model the effects of shocks dynamically, while imposing a minimum set of\nassumptions about the structure of the economy.\nLet us first consider the following reduced form VAR system,\nyt\nt +\np\n\nBj\nyt-j\n+ ut\n, with t = 1, . . . , T, (1)\nwhere yt\nis an N \u00d7 1 vector of endogenous variables, ut\n N(0, ) is an N \u00d7 1 vector of\nreduced form residuals, c1\nis an N \u00d7 1 intercept vector, c2\nis an N \u00d7 1 coefficient vector\non the linear time trend, and Bj\nare N \u00d7 N matrices containing the VAR coefficients.\n7See e.g. https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html.\n8We want to keep our estimation results comparable to the literature and therefore follow Boeckx\n9Data on the Stress Indicator for the German Financial System, presented in Bundesbank (2013, p.\n7\u00ad20), is not publicly available.\nIn order to generate results comparable to the literature, we opted for a lag length of\np = 4.10 We propose the following selection of endogenous variables:\nyt\n=\n[\nrt\nyt\npt\nst\nxt\nlt\n]\n\nwhere rt\ndenotes the policy rate, yt\ndenotes output, pt\ndenotes the price index, st\ndenotes\nthe central bank assets held for monetary policy purposes, xt\nis an indicator of financial\nstress or another financial market variable, and lt\nis the sum of MRO and LTRO volumes.\nAll variables, except for the policy rate and financial stress, are in logarithms.\nTo conduct a structural analysis, we identify the following model,\nyt\nt +\np\n\nAj\nyt-j\n+ et\n, with t = 1, . . . , T, (3)\nis an N\u00d7N matrix such that Aj\nBj\nand et\nut\nwith et\n), IN\nis the N \u00d7 N identity matrix and E(ut\nu\nt\n) = (A\nis the covariance matrix of the VAR residuals. Since the estimated model (1) does not\nallow us to identify the structural form (3) without additional assumptions, we impose\nidentifying restrictions on the impulse response functions (IRFs) of shocks. The literature\nhas developed several methods to determine A0\nbased on economic considerations. We\nidentify the shocks using a combined sign and zero restrictions approach and rely on the\nmethod of Arias, Rubio-Ramirez, and Waggoner (2014), who propose an algorithm which\nis robust to erroneous credible intervals and unintended additional sign restrictions.11\nThe literature has developed different identifying assumptions on the asset purchase shock.\nGiven the ECB's switch to fixed rate full allotment provisioning during the considered\ntime frame, banks can in principle obtain as much liquidity as they need at a given interest\nrate. Both exogenous balance sheet policy decisions and higher liquidity demand by banks\nlead to an expansion of the central bank balance sheet. Similarly, Szczerbowicz (2015)\ndiscriminates between \"asset purchases\" and \"other exceptional liquidity provisions\". In\ncontrast, Peersman (2011) does not distinguish demand-driven expansions from asset pur-\nchase programs. He argues that even though a balance sheet expansion is demand-driven,\nthe policy decision to provide the banking sector with as much liquidity as needed when\nfinancial stress occurs, is still taken by the ECB and as such represents a policy deci-\nsion. Boeckx et al. (2017) and Gambacorta et al. (2014) use variables which indicate\nfinancial stress periods or periods with high risk aversion in order to ensure exogeneity\nof their policy shock. They require those measures to be non-increasing if an expansion-\nary unconventional shock hits the economy. This assumption excludes demand-induced\nbalance sheet expansions which occur in stress periods but it precludes the authors from\n10Throughout the analysis and across different specifications, we keep the specification comparable by\nusing the same lag length. Robustness checks with different lag lengths showed similar results, see section\nB.2 in the Appendix.\n11Arias et al. (2014) show that other algorithms may lead to additional sign restrictions on variables\nwhich are seemingly unrestricted. Consequently, point estimates and confidence bands are estimated with\nerror.\nVariable Asset purchase shock Financial shock\nPolicy rate rt\nOutput yt\nPrices pt\nFinancial stress xt\nMRO + LTRO volumes lt\nTable 1: Identifying restrictions.\ninterpreting the responses to stress itself.\nIn order to investigate the effects of a discretionary asset purchase shock, it has to be\ndefined and identified unambiguously. In particular, the shock should be orthogonal to\nother possible shocks in the system. We impose a mixture of sign and zero restrictions on\nthe impulse responses of certain variables in our VAR model. Our identifying restrictions\nare summarized in Table 1.\nFor our analysis, we consider asset purchases associated with expansions of the ECB\nbalance sheet.12 In particular, we require securities held for monetary policy purposes (st\n)\nto increase if an expansionary asset purchase shock hits the economy. The literature on\nmonetary policy transmission traditionally assumes that output (yt\n) and prices (pt\n) are not\ncontemporaneously affected by the policy measure. In the same vein, it can be argued that\na discretionary expansion of the central bank's balance sheet should not change output and\nprices on impact. As discussed above, the ECB's fixed rate full allotment policy requires\nus to distinguish the asset purchase shock from a demand-driven balance sheet expansion.\nGenerally, a policy-induced increase in the balance sheet can be attributed either to the\nendogenous response of liquidity demand lt\nor to an exogenous asset purchase shock st\nIn order to make sure that our asset purchase shock is truly exogenous and does not reflect\nan endogenous response through a sort of \"balance sheet rule\", we impose an additional\nrestriction. Since demand-driven balance sheet expansions operate through either MROs\nor LTROs, we require the sum of the two, lt\n, not to increase. The restriction on the\nMRO and LTRO volumes is a convenient way to identify the shock without restricting\nthe responses of financial stress. The policy rate rt\ndoes not react when an asset purchase\nshock hits the system.14\nFor comparison, we also identify a financial shock that increases stress on financial\nmarkets xt\n. Differently from the asset purchase shock, banks are assumed to increase\nthe ECB's balance sheet through either MROs and LTROs or SHFMPP, while the policy\ninstrument remains unrestricted. Output and prices are sluggish and do not react contem-\nporaneously to the shock. We interpret the dynamic responses to this shock as picking up\nendogenous reactions to financial stress periods, which includes effects of the ECB's fixed\n12We abstract from other unconventional measures, such as loosening of collateral requirements, lower\nreserve requirements, maturity transformations of refinancing operations, or forward guidance.\n13Other balance sheet items are less relevant for our analysis.\n14The chosen sample period is well-suited to analyze asset purchase shocks while it seems not sensible\nto identify conventional policy rate shocks. However, for illustrative purposes we simulated responses to\na policy rate shock within our sample. Results can be found in section B.3 in the Appendix.\nrate full allotment policy. As we impose banks to demand liquidity through MROs and\nLTROs in response to the shock, the dynamics allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthose measures. Gambacorta et al. (2014) and Boeckx et al. (2017) identify their version\nof a balance sheet shock by excluding endogenous reactions to stress which we capture in\nthe financial shock. In this spirit, Lenza et al. (2010), focus on effects of those endogenous\nand demand-driven measures which should not be confused with the asset purchase shock\nin the second column of Table 1.\nRestrictions with respect to variables that relate to the ECB balance sheet or monetary\npolicy are generally applied at the 3-month horizon, while output and prices are allowed\nto react in the month after the shock.\nThe model is estimated with Bayesian methods using a flat prior distribution. In par-\nticular, we employ the specification in Uhlig (2005) and set the respective prior matrices\nto zero, which yields the posterior distribution with respect to the reduced form model\n(1). Regarding the structural model (3), we employ the algorithm in Arias et al. (2014)\nto draw the contemporaneous impact matrix A0\n. As suggested by the authors, we ob-\ntain the reduced form estimates B = [c1\n, . . . , Bp\n] and  first, then a candidate\nrandom matrix A0\nis proposed. If the sign restrictions are satisfied, we keep the matrices\n}. Otherwise, we discard the triple. This procedure is repeated until we have\ndraws are discarded in order to minimize the impact of the starting point.\nThe analysis is performed in two steps. First, we consider impulse response functions\nwith respect to aggregate euro area data. Estimates for the euro area aggregate are useful\nbecause they allow us to compare our estimated effects of asset purchase shocks to the\nexisting literature, which \u00ad as mentioned earlier \u00ad has focused on balance sheet shocks\nmore broadly. Beyond that, we discuss the validity of the identified asset purchase shock\nand identify a financial stress shock. Then, we estimate the model on German data in\norder to assume a country-specific perspective. In particular, we focus on variables that\ncontain information on firm and financial market responses.\nLet us start with our baseline specification, where the euro area composite stress index\ncaptures effects on financial markets. The CISS has been proposed by Holl\u00b4\nit consists of five sub-indices and lies on the unit interval. Since we employ a novel\nidentification scheme, the baseline specification also helps us to compare our results to\nthe existing literature on central bank balance sheet expansions.\nPolicy rate\nOutput\nPrices\nSHFMPP\nFinancial stress\nFigure 2: Euro area. Monthly impulse responses to a one standard deviation asset pur-\nchase shock, all multiplied by 100.\nWe assume that an asset purchase shock hits the economy in period 0. As shown in the\nrespective column of Table 1, the ECB balance sheet item SHFMPP (securities held for\nmonetary policy purposes) is restricted to increase, monetary policy is not allowed to use\nits conventional interest rate instrument, while at the same time the sum of the balance\nsheet positions related to the ECB's MROs and LTROs are required not to increase.\nInflation and output are allowed to react with a one-period lag to policy decisions. The\nkey innovation of our identification scheme is that we explicitly leave the reaction of\nthe stress index unrestricted, because we want to let the data speak on the response of\nfinancial stress.\nThe results of this first exercise are depicted in Figure 2. Throughout the paper, solid\nlines depict the median and the blue-shaded area includes the 16-84% quantiles of the\nposterior distribution.\nThe median initial effect on financial stress is positive, while surrounded by uncertainty\nbands that include zero. In the following periods, financial stress declines and falls below\nits pre-shock level. At the same time, the shock has a temporary expansionary effect\non the real economy; we observe a statistically significant15 increase in output over the\nmedium term.16 Prices do not change significantly. The tendency for the policy rate to\nrise in the medium term might reflect the central bank's reaction to the increase in output.\nThis contractionary monetary policy response may explain why, a few months after the\nshock, stress starts to increase and eventually overshoots its pre-shock level. To some\ndegree, then, conventional monetary policy offsets the initial stress-reducing effect of the\nasset purchase policy impulse. Following a peak after around one year, financial stress\n15Even though we use Bayesian estimation techniques we will in the following use the word `significant'\nto mean that the respective quantiles of the posterior distribution do not include zero.\n16Using industrial production instead produced similar results, which are available upon request.\nPolicy rate\nOutput\nPrices\nSHFMPP\nFinancial stress\nFigure 3: Euro area. Monthly impulse responses to a one standard deviation shock to\nfinancial stress, all multiplied by 100.\nfalls back to its initial level, while MRO and LTRO volumes expand as banks exploit\nthe fixed rate full allotment scheme. Note that we observe a stress-reducing impact of\nincreasing MROs and LTROs in response to a financial shock (see below).\nComparing our impulse response functions to those in Boeckx et al. (2017), reveals\nquantitative and qualitative differences. The size of the output reaction is smaller in our\ncase and the response of prices is insignificant. Most notably, as opposed to the identifying\nassumptions imposed by Boeckx et al. (2017), who propose that financial stress does not\nincrease initially, for our sample, stress falls with a lag of some months. In fact, after about\n10 months, we observe positive reactions of stress which draws a somewhat ambiguous\npicture of the overall impact on stress. One could worry that our approach may mix up\nheterogeneous and potentially opposing effects of the asset purchase programs undertaken\nby the ECB. However, as Szczerbowicz (2015) has shown, the interconnectedness between\nbanks and governments rather leads to an amplification of policy measures.\nAs our discussion about the identifying assumptions of the asset purchase shock has shown,\nit is important to disentangle such a shock from a financial stress shock which comprises\nendogenous reactions of private banks or the central bank in response to stress periods.\nIn order to show the differences in the transmission, we identify a financial shock, which\ninduces banks to obtain liquidity from MRO or LTRO operations and the central bank to\nreact through asset purchases. This shock captures the endogenous responses we excluded\nfor the structural and exogenous asset purchase shock. The identifying assumptions are\nsummarized more formally in the respective column of Table 1. We keep the duration of\nthe restrictions comparable to the asset purchase shock.\nThe dynamic responses to this shock are shown in Figure 3. Liquidity demand rises\nfor several months and financial stress shows some persistence as well. The combination\nPolicy rate\nOutput\nPrices\nSHFMPP\nFinancial stress\nFigure 4: Germany. Monthly impulse response functions to a one standard deviation\nasset purchase shock, all multiplied by 100.\nof asset purchases and liquidity provision through MROs and LTROs is quite effective in\ncontaining adverse effects on macroeconomic variables: output and prices do not change\nsignificantly over the response horizon. Financial stress peaks on impact and falls rapidly\nas the central bank provides liquidity. The median stress response eventually falls below\nits pre-shock level.\nThe responsibility for financial stability is not exclusively assigned to euro area institu-\ntions, but lies to a large degree at the national level. Since one might argue that the euro\narea is not a group of homogeneous countries, it is insightful to investigate the effects of\nthe asset purchase programs for specific cases. Access to internal firm- and bank-related\ndata allows us to evaluate the financial effects of unconventional policy measures for the\nGerman case.\nWe conduct similar experiments as for the euro area case. First, we estimate impulse\nresponse functions for the baseline specification. Then we replace the financial stress\nindex with other variables of interest. We consider the same time horizon, lag length, and\nidentification scheme as for the euro area.17\nResults for the baseline model are depicted in Figure 4. Compared to the euro area ex-\nercise, qualitatively responses of macroeconomic variables show a similar pattern. Output\nrises over the medium term, while prices do not change significantly. The composite stress\nindex for Germany displays a short-run drop. However, we also find that the purchase\nprograms significantly raise market financial stress over the medium run. This points to\npossible undesirable second-round effects of the purchase programs.\n17The only exception is the series on implicit firm defaults for which we have observations until March\nDefault rates\nWrite-offs over loans\nEquity ratio\nLending growth\nBank lending rates\nFigure 5: Germany. Monthly impulse responses of financial market variables to an asset\npurchase shock, all multiplied by 100.\nOne reason for these unfavorable effects might be that banks grant riskier loans in\nresponse to the shock, which has adverse effects on credit risk. Implicit default rates\nof German non-financial firms rise on impact, consistent with this conjecture. Eser and\nSchwaab (2016) find a strong but temporary reduction of liquidity risk premia due to the\nSMP in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, and Spain, while bid-ask spreads widened again\nafterwards. Lambert and Ueda (2014) find for US data that credit risk increases over the\nmedium term in response to unconventional policy news.\nIn order to get a more detailed picture on how the asset purchase programs affect\nthe corporate and financial sectors, we consider alternative specifications to our baseline\nchoice of variables (2). In particular, we successively replace the financial stress index xt\nwith a series from a set of variables that contain information on the policy transmission\nchannel or capture potential unintended side effects. Figure 5 contains the responses of\nthose variables to an asset purchase shock.18\nThe ECB argues that its unconventional measures help to restore the monetary trans-\nmission channel. They involve supporting banks' credit provision to non-financial firms in\norder to finance new investment projects. Figure 5 however indicates that, in Germany,\nasset purchases did not generate more lending to non-financial firms.\nWe proxy credit risk by loan write-offs as a fraction of German banks' lending stock\nto corporates. Ceteris paribus, i.e. for a given default risk in the corporate sector, a\nreduction in write-offs indicates that banks are less cautious with respect to potential\nlosses. Consequently, ex-ante credit risk rises. Our use of data on write-offs differs from\nAngbazo (1997) or Dick (2006) who view them as a direct measure of credit default, such\nthat increased write-offs reflect higher ex-post credit risk. One concern related to liquidity\ninjections is that banks might roll over existing loans or extend new loans to nonviable\n18We omit plots of the other 5 variables included in the VAR.\nfirms, which would be reflected in increased net loan write-offs.19 The median response\nshows that, at least in the short run, liquidity provisioning induces banks to reduce their\nloan write-offs. While this result is associated with much estimation uncertainty, it may\nsuggest that banks do not fully take into account credit risk. In connection with the\nincrease in implicit firm defaults, this result may point to higher financial stability risks.\nThe VDAX-NEW index reflects risk aversion in the stock market.20 Results show that\nmarket participants become less optimistic about future stock market developments over\nthe medium run. The initial response to the shock is insignificant.\nThe positive response of the equity ratio suggests that the banks to some extent use\nthe liquidity provided by the central bank in order to recapitalize their balance sheets by\nobtaining more equity financing.\nThe portfolio balancing channel has often been mentioned in connection with central\nbank asset purchase programs.21 Among other things, it predicts a decline in interest rates.\nIf the central bank undertakes large-scale asset purchases, the prices of those assets should\nrise and yields should decline accordingly. Since interest rates on assets fell and investors\nare equipped with liquidity from the central bank, they have an incentive to rebalance\ntheir portfolios and to buy comparable but more profitable assets. The increased demand\nwill in turn induce asset prices to increase and interest rates to fall further. We introduce\nbank lending rates in the VAR in order to test the pass-through to lending rates to non-\nfinancial corporations. From the impulse response functions we find that lending rates\nshow a tendency to fall initially. However, the width of the error bands shows that this\nresult is quite imprecise. Lending rates actually rise over the medium term in response to\nthe ECB's asset purchase programs. Thus, we do not observe a portfolio balance effect\non bank lending rates. Looking at this result more closely, we note that lending rates are\ntightly connected to the policy rate and follow its pattern. As the policy rate rises some\nmonths after the shock, lending rates mimic this response.22\nTo conclude, while macroeconomic effects of asset purchase programs in Germany are\nfavorable, with output increasing significantly and no effect on prices, financial market\nvariables paint a less optimistic picture. Lending to firms does not expand or become\ncheaper, implicit firm default rates rise and financial stress also increases eventually.\nOur results imply some uncertainty with respect to initial reactions to the shock while\nmedium-term effects are exposed more clearly. Different from event studies which focus\non short-term impact of measures, our model emphasizes the medium-term implications.\n19Lambert and Ueda (2014) find US banks to avoid repairing their balance sheet and call this \"ever-\ngreening\".\n20Similar to the VDAX, the VDAX-NEW is a volatility index. The construction of the VDAX-NEW\nis more closely related to the VSTOXX. Instead of of relying on fictitious option price data it is compiled\nwith traded options.\n22We carried out a robustness exercise, where we require the policy rate to stay unchanged only on\nimpact instead of three months. In that case, the policy rate is lowered in response to the shock, which\nallows bank lending rates to decline. The respective impulse response functions are available upon request.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper estimates the effects of ECB's asset purchase programs, focusing on financial\nmarket variables. We disentangle asset purchase shocks from changes in the balance sheet\nthat reflect endogenous liquidity provisioning through the fixed rate full allotment policy.\nWe find that ECB balance sheet policies, in the form of direct asset purchases, bring\ndown financial stress for some periods after the shock. This positive effect is reversed\nthereafter as stress increases above its pre-shock level. At the same time, asset purchase\nshocks have an expansionary effect on economic activity, while the effect on prices remains\ninsignificant. Our approach differs from the existing literature in that we do not impose\nrestrictions on financial stress in order to identify discretionary asset purchase shocks. We\nalso find that liquidity provisioning through a fixed rate full allotment policy in response\nto a financial shock appears to be successful in containing adverse effects on output and\nprices.\nMacroeconomic implications of the asset purchase programs for the German economy\nare generally similar. Initially, financial stress declines. However, after several months\nfinancial stress rises, which suggests that a more detailed analysis of financial market re-\nsponses is warranted. Stock market volatility and risk aversion increase in response to the\npolicy measure. We find that asset purchases are not successful in restoring credit creation\nin Germany. Bank lending rates, do not decrease as suggested by the portfolio balancing\nchannel. Loan write-offs decline while implicit firm default rates rise significantly, indi-\ncating that bank lending might be becoming more risky. To sum up, our analysis shows\nthat, while output effects in the euro area and Germany are positive, there are indications\nof increasing risks to financial stability. While event studies usually document short-term\nimplications of policy measures, our analysis gives insights into the dynamic responses of\nthe macroeconomy and financial variables.\nThe question remains to which extent asset purchase programs influence individual\nfinancial institutions and how effects feed back to the macroeconomy. It would be partic-\nularly interesting to consider data at an institutional level in order to overcome the small\nsample size problem. Examining more disaggregated data using appropriate empirical\nmodels is left for future research.\nReferences\nAbbassi, P., F. Bruning, F. Fecht, and J. L.

Some of the\nseries were transformed before estimation. Data on real GDP is not available on a monthly\nfrequency. For this reason we imputed the missing values using the Chow and Lin (1971)\nmethod as it is done in Boeckx et al. (2017) and Gambacorta et al. (2014). In general, we\nused seasonally and working day adjusted data where available. In the case of German\nloan write-offs and the equity ratio we used unadjusted data. The data on loan write-\noffs and the equity ratio are taken from the monthly balance sheet statistics (\"monatliche\nBilanzstatistik\") which consists of confidential data on German MFIs balance sheets.

Bank lending comprises lending to non-financial\ncorporations.\nA particularly important component of our exercise is the Composite Indicator of Sys-\ntemic Stress. The CISS is meant to condense the state of financial instability into a single\nstatistic. It aggregates five market-specific subindices created from a total of 15 individual\nfinancial stress measures. The weights used in the aggregation reflect time-varying cross-\ncorrelations between subindices. This puts relatively more weight on situations in which\nstress prevails in several market segments at the same time. The CISS provides an ex-post\nmeasure of systemic risk, i.e. risk which has materialized already. The construction of\nthe CISS considers comprises data from money markets, equity markets, bond markets,\nforeign exchange markets, and financial intermediaries. It uses standard securities market\nindicators, e.g. volatilities, risk spreads, cumulative valuation losses.\nB Other exercises\nB.1 Alternative identification\nWe have performed a robustness exercise regarding the horizon over which the sign re-\nstrictions are binding. In our baseline identification of the asset purchase shock, except for\noutput and prices, we choose a three-month horizon to take into account that the ECB's\nPolicy rate\nOutput\nPrices\nSHFMPP\nFinancial stress\nFigure B.1: Euro area. Monthly impulse responses to a one standard deviation asset\npurchase shock with alternative identifying assumptions, all multiplied by 100.\npurchase programs are generally quite persistent. In particular, we imposed prolonged\nzero restrictions on the policy rate rt\nfor two reasons. First, we do not want to mix up\nconventional policy shocks with balance sheet policy which leads us to keep this restric-\ntion at least as long as the sign restriction on the balance sheet prevails. Second, our\nresults should contain some information about constrained conventional monetary policy\nenvironments, i.e. the zero lower bound restriction. In Figure B.1 we provide results of\nan alternative identification scheme, where the restriction on the policy rate is imposed\nonly on impact.\nB.2 Alternative lag length\nWe performed an additional robustness exercise with respect to the lag length of the\nmodel. In Figure B.2 we provide results for the asset purchase shock in a model with only\ntwo lags. Impulse responses have a similar pattern compared to the baseline case. Stress\nfalls after some months but then rises again and rises above its pre-shock level. The\nresponse of output is positive over the medium term. Quantitatively, we find a longer\nlasting positive response of output and a very short-lived negative response of prices.\nHowever, we would still argue that we can hardly verify a noticeable effect on prices since\nerror bands include zero from period 4 onwards.\nB.3 Policy rate shock\nWe also computed impulse responses to a \"conventional\" policy rate shock. The policy\nrate is assumed to decrease on impact and in the following two months, while output,\nprices and the balance sheet items do not react on impact. Results are depicted in Figure\nB.3. We find that the policy instrument is ineffective with respect to output and we\nobserve a positive response of prices which lasts for a few months.
