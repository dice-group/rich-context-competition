Matthews, PhD\nContext: The contribution of reproductive hormones to\nmood has been the focus of considerable research. Re-\nsults from clinical and epidemiological studies have been\ninconsistent. It remains unclear whether alterations in\nserum hormone levels across the menopausal transition\nare linked to depressive symptoms.\nObjectives: To evaluate the relationship between se-\nrum hormone levels and high depressive symptoms and\nwhether hormone levels or their change might explain\nthe association of menopausal status with depressive\nsymptoms previously reported in a national sample of\nmidlife women.\nDesign: Alongitudinal,community-based,multisitestudy\nof menopause. Data were collected at baseline and annu-\nfactors. Early follicular phase serum samples were as-\nsayed for levels of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone,\ntestosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.\nSetting: Seven communities nationwide.\nParticipants: A community-based sample of 3302 mul-\ntiethnic women, aged 42 to 52 years, still menstruating\nand not using exogenous reproductive hormones.\nMain Outcome Measure: Depressive symptoms as-\nsessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies De-\npression Scale (CES-D). The primary outcome was a\nCES-D score of 16 or higher.\nResults: In multivariable random-effects logistic regres-\nsion models, log-transformed testosterone level was sig-\nnificantly positively associated with higher odds of a\nincrease in log-transformed testosterone from baseline\nto each annual visit was significantly associated with in-\ncreased odds of a CES-D score of 16 or higher (odds ra-\ncation, being Hispanic, and vasomotor symptoms, stressful\nlife events, and low social support at each visit were each\nindependently associated with a CES-D score of 16 or\nhigher. No other hormones were associated with a CES-D\nscore of 16 or higher. Being perimenopausal or post-\nmenopausal compared with being premenopausal re-\nmained significantly associated with a CES-D score of 16\nor higher in all analyses.\nConclusions: Higher testosterone levels may contrib-\nute to higher depressive symptoms during the meno-\npausal transition.

The Study\nof Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a pro-\nspective study of the menopausal transition, has fol-\nlowed up a large, ethnically diverse sample for 8 years.\nThus, SWAN has addressed many of the previous stud-\nies' limitations. In the current analyses, we build on our\nearlier findings from analyses of the first 5 annual as-\nsessments in which we reported that high depressive\nsymptoms as measured by a standard questionnaire, the\nCenterforEpidemiologicalStudiesDepressionScale(CES-\nD), were more likely to be reported when midlife women\nwere perimenopausal and postmenopausal than when pre-\nmenopausal,1 independent of multiple psychosocial fac-\ntors and vasomotor symptoms.\nThe overall aim of the current analyses was to exam-\nine the relationship between serum hormone levels and\nhigh depressive symptoms. We evaluated the following:\n(1) whether our previously reported findings were rep-\nlicated with 3 additional years of follow-up; (2) the con-\ncurrent relationships of depressive symptoms and se-\nrum levels of the reproductive hormones (FSH, E2\n, T, and\nthe somatic adrenal hormone DHEA-S) over 8 years; (3)\nassociations between changes in each hormone from base-\nline and high depressive symptoms; and (4) whether the\nhormones attenuated or nullified the association of meno-\npausal status defined by bleeding patterns with elevated\ndepressive symptoms.\nMETHODS\nThe Study of Women's Health Across the Nation is a longitu-\ndinal, multiethnic, multisite, community-based study of meno-\npause and aging among 3302 premenopausal and early peri-\nmenopausal women.13 Eligibility for enrollment was assessed\nsurvey of health, reproductive, demographic, and lifestyle in-\nwere enrolled in the longitudinal cohort. Each of 7 sites re-\ncruited white women and women from 1 specified minority\ngroup (African American women in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\nin Boston, Massachusetts, in the area of Detroit, Michigan, and\nin Chicago, Illinois; Japanese women in Los Angeles, Califor-\nnia; Chinese women in the region of Oakland, California; and\nHispanic women in Newark, New Jersey). Eligibility included\nbeing aged between 42 and 52 years, having an intact uterus,\nhaving at least 1 menstrual period and no use of exogenous re-\nproductive hormones in the previous 3 months, not being preg-\nnant or lactating, and self-identification with 1 of the site's des-\nignated racial/ethnic groups. Study retention at the end of the\neighth follow-up visit was 74%, at which time two-thirds of the\nparticipants (66%) were postmenopausal and 11% were late peri-\nmenopausal. The New Jersey site did not retain women be-\nyond year 5 because of administrative reasons unrelated to the\npurpose of the study. The institutional review boards at all par-\nticipating sites approved the study protocol. After excluding 2\nwomen missing the CES-D data,14 1 woman missing covariate\ndata, and 3 women missing serum hormone levels at all ex-\naminations, our sample consisted of 3296 women.\nPROCEDURES\nThe SWAN participants were assessed at study entry (base-\nline) and once a year with a common standardized protocol.\nAll study forms and materials were available in English, Span-\nish, Japanese, and Cantonese and bilingual staff was used as\nappropriate. Baseline and annual assessments included self- and\ninterviewer-administered questionnaires about health, life-\nstyle, and psychosocial factors. Height and weight were mea-\nsured using a common protocol, and a fasting blood sample\nwas obtained in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle\nif possible. Participants provided signed, written informed con-\nsent prior to study entry.\nMEASURES\nAssessment of Depressive Symptoms\nDepressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and annually\nwith the CES-D Scale, a 20-item measure that asks about the\nfrequency of being bothered by depressive symptoms during\nthe previous week on a 4-point scale of 0 (rarely) to 3 (most or\nall of the time).14 A score of 16 or higher is generally used to\nidentify potential clinical depression15 and was used to indi-\ncate clinically relevant depressive symptoms in this study. The\nCES-D has been shown to be valid and reliable in diverse eth-\nnic populations.16-18 To examine more or less severe depres-\nsive symptoms, we also compared 3 groups of women: those\nwith CES-D scores lower than 16, those with CES-D scores of\n16 to lower than 22, and those with CES-D scores of 22 or higher\n(the median of the group with CES-D scores of 16).\nSerum Hormone Measurements\nThe fasting blood draw was targeted to days 2 to 5 of the fol-\nlicular phase of the menstrual cycle in menstruating women and\nwithin 90 days of the anniversary of the baseline examination\ndate. If a timed sample could not be obtained after 2 attempts, a\nrandom fasting sample was taken within a 90-day window of the\nannual visit. Blood was refrigerated within 1 to 2 hours after phle-\nbotomy. All samples were maintained at 4\u00b0C until separated; fol-\nlowing centrifugation, the serum was aliquotted, frozen at -80\u00b0C,\nand shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory. All assays used\na double-antibody chemiluminescent immunoassay with a solid-\nphase anti-IgG immunoglobulin conjugated to paramagnetic par-\nticles, antiligand antibody, and competitive ligand labeled with\ndimethylacridinium ester.\nassay modified the rabbit anti-E2-6\nnoassay (Bayer Diagnostics Corp, Norwood, Massachusetts) to\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

Likewise, total E2\nwas indexed to SHBG to cal-\nculatethefreeE2\nindex(freeE2\ninpicogramsper\nmilliliter]/[272.11SHBGinnanomolesperliter]).Hormoneas-\nsays were conducted at the SWAN Endocrine Laboratory, Uni-\nversityofMichigan,AnnArbor,usingtheACS-180automatedana-\nlyzer (Bayer Diagnostics Corp).\nMenopausal Status\nMenopausal status was based on menstrual bleeding patterns\nin the previous 12 months and was categorized as the follow-\ning: (1) premenopausal (menstrual period in the past 3 months\nwith no change in regularity in the past 12 months); (2) early\nperimenopausal (menstrual period in the past 3 months with\nchange in regularity over the previous 12 months); (3) late peri-\nmenopausal (no menstrual period within the past 3 months but\nsome menstrual bleeding within the past 12 months); and (4)\npostmenopausal (no menstrual period within the past 12\nmonths). The classifications are similar to those recom-\nmended by the World Health Organization19 and the Stages of\nReproductive Aging Workshop.20 Based on SWAN eligibility\nrequirements, all women were premenopausal or early peri-\nmenopausal at baseline.\nCovariates\nAge, race/ethnicity, and education were obtained at the base-\nline examination. The CES-D score and all other variables were\nobtained at each annual examination. Body mass index (BMI)\nwas calculated as weight (obtained with a calibrated scale) in\nkilograms divided by height (obtained with a stadiometer) in\nmeters squared. Smoking status was assessed as current vs not.\nWomen self-reported medication use for nerves or depression\nat least twice per week in the month prior to interview; this\nwas verified by examination of medication containers in the\nclinic by the interviewers or participants reading labels to the\ninterviewer over the telephone.\nVasomotor symptoms were coded as presence or absence\nof hot flashes, cold sweats, or night sweats in the previous 2\nweeks. Psychosocial variables included social support, 4 items\nfrom the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (score\nranged from 0-16),21 and upsetting life events based on a check-\nlist of 18 life events since the last study visit rated according to\nhow upsetting they were (categorized as 0, 1, or 2 very up-\nsetting events).\nFor the longitudinal analyses, we excluded observations (ie, vis-\nits) at which a woman reported using exogenous hormones,\nbeing pregnant, or breastfeeding since the last study visit; we\ncensored data from women who reported surgical menopause\n(bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) at subsequent fol-\nlow-up visits; and we did not include observations with miss-\ning covariate data. Minimally adjusted models examining con-\ncurrent serum hormone levels from baseline through follow-up\nvisit 8 included 3296 women. Models examining change in hor-\nmone levels at the follow-up visits included 2882 women. The\ndecrease in sample size came primarily from women who\ndropped out after the initial visit (n=293). Women who dropped\nout were more likely than those who enrolled to smoke, to have\ndepressive symptoms, lower education, and higher BMI, and\nto be of Hispanic race/ethnicity and were less likely to be Chi-\nnese or Japanese. These women did not differ on menopausal\nstatus, age, or hormone levels at baseline.\nSeparate random-effects logistic regression analyses were con-\nducted to determine associations between CES-D scores of 16\nor higher and concurrent serum hormone levels and change\nin hormone levels through visit 8. We ran 3 sets of models: (1)\na replication of previously reported associations between meno-\npausal status and high depressive symptoms with 3 years of ad-\nditional data; (2) an analysis of concurrent hormones; and (3)\nan analysis of change in hormones from baseline. Each set of\nanalyses consisted of a minimally adjusted model and a fully\nadjusted model as described later. The inclusion of a (woman-\nspecific) random intercept quantifies the correlation between\nall observations from a given woman to overall variation and\nenables us to ascribe a woman-specific interpretation to model\nparameters. Random-effects logistic regression models are rela-\ntively robust to missing data and make use of all available data\nacross all visits. Natural logarithm transformation was used for\nserum hormone concentrations to reduce skewness. To exam-\nine more or less severe depressive symptoms, separate models\nwere repeated comparing the middle CES-D score group (scores\nwith the lowest CES-D score group (scores 16).\nWe modeled T and DHEA-S as a function of aging because\nthese hormones have been shown to decrease slowly with age\nand show little effect of the menopausal transition itself.22 In\nminimally adjusted models for each of the hormones predict-\ning high depressive symptoms, we included race/ethnicity, study\nsite, baseline age, and years since baseline (ie, aging). Al-\nand FSH manifest a clear inflection at the time of\nthe final menstrual period, only 1272 women had observable\nfinal menstrual periods. Thus, we conducted and report analy-\nand FSH as a function of time. Results of these analy-\nses were similar to those from analyses modeling E2\nand FSH\nas a function of age at the final menstrual period. We also in-\ncluded a quadratic term for each hormone to account for po-\ntential nonlinear associations with depression scores across time.\nNone of these analyses yielded significant results, and they are\nnot discussed further.\nHormones showing significant associations with depressive\nsymptoms in a minimally adjusted model were assessed further\nin analyses that included covariates. For the fully adjusted model,\nwe selected potential confounders and covariates based on the\nliterature and a priori hypotheses.

Final models also in-\ncluded baseline education and time-varying covariates of\nvasomotor symptoms, medication use, BMI, social support, life\nevents,smoking,andmenopausalstatus.Whenexaminingchange\nin hormone levels, the minimally and fully adjusted models in-\ncluded baseline serum hormone values.\nBecause bleeding patterns became less predictable as women\nprogressed through the transition, it became increasingly dif-\nficult to anchor a serum sample to a phase of the menstrual pe-\nriod. We previously found that the timing of the blood draw\ncan be considered a surrogate for the transition.23 Therefore,\ngiven the larger portion of noncycling observations (ie, late peri-\nmenopausal and postmenopausal) over the 8 years and ob-\nserved links between status and depressive symptoms in SWAN,1\nwe included menopausal status (rather than cycle day) in mul-\ntivariable analyses.\nAdditional analyses explored the association of the E2\n-T ratio\nwith high CES-D scores and examined whether the relationship\nbetween hormones and depressive symptoms differed for women\nwith certain characteristics, including low education, high finan-\ncial strain, low social support, or very upsetting life events, using\ninteraction terms between significant serum hormone levels and\ndichotomous variables of each characteristic. Neither the E2\n-T ra-\ntio nor any of the interactions were significant.\nAnalyses were run using SAS version 9.1 statistical soft-\nware (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and Stata ver-\nsion 9 statistical software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).\nP.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nParticipants are described in Table 1. At baseline, en-\ndogenous hormone levels did not differ between women\nwith high CES-D scores (16) and those with low CES-D\nscores (16). Women with depressive symptoms at base-\nline were more likely to be African American or His-\npanic, be current smokers, have a higher BMI, and be early\nperimenopausal. Over the 8 years of follow-up, mean\nlog\nFSH values increased and mean log\nvalues decreased,\nwhereas there were minimal changes in mean log\nT and\nmean log\nDHEA-S values (Figure 1).\nConsistent with the previously reported first 5 years of\nfollow-up, with an additional 3 years of follow-up, women\ncontinued to have monotonically increasing odds of a\nCES-D score of 16 or higher when they were early and\nlate perimenopausal and postmenopausal compared with\nwhen they were premenopausal (adjusted models ex-\ncluding hormone levels), with odds ratios (ORs) rang-\nTable 1.

Although associa-\ntions were significant, the covariates reduced the effect\nof log\nT by only a small amount (concurrent log\nin the minimally adjusted model; OR=1.15 in the fully\nadjusted model). Of note, in models of both concurrent\nlog\nT and change in log\nT over time, covariates including up-\nsetting life events, lower education, and vasomotor symp-\ntoms showed strong associations with high depressive\nsymptoms. Social support had a protective effect, being\nassociated with lower odds of having high depressive\nsymptoms (Table 3 and Table 4).\nCOMMENT\nIn this study, we assessed whether reproductive hor-\nmones were related to risk of high depressive symptoms\n(CES-D score 16) over 8 years of follow-up and whether\nthey might explain the previously observed association\nbetween menopausal status and these symptoms in the\nearly years of SWAN.1 Although we found no signifi-\ncant effect of the level of or change in E2\nor FSH on risk\nof depressive symptoms, we did find that higher current\ntotal testosterone levels and an increase in testosterone\nlevels from baseline were significantly associated with high\nCES-D scores whether defined as a score of 16 or greater\nor 22 or greater. This association was independent of mul-\ntiple covariates and confounders and, most important,\nof menopausal status and vasomotor symptoms. Impor-\ntantly, perimenopause and postmenopause continued to\nbe significantly independently associated with odds of\nhigh depressive symptoms.\nNeuroendocrine theories suggest that estrogens in par-\nticular have a role in the development of depression in\nwomen as they may modulate the activity of the seroto-\nnin neurotransmitter system that has been linked to de-\npression.24,25 At one time, the biological link between\nmenopause and mood was hypothesized to be that low\nlevels of estrogen were associated with negative mood.\nHowever, epidemiological studies of menopause have\nshown either no relationship between negative mood\nsymptoms and menopausal status26-28 or higher levels of\nsymptoms during perimenopause29-33 and not during post-\nmenopause when estrogen levels are low. Although sev-\neral short-term randomized controlled trials have shown\nefficacy of exogenous estrogen in attenuating depres-\nsion in perimenopausal women,34,35 no studies demon-\nstrate direct associations between depression and se-\nMore recently, it has been postulated that the fluctu-\nating and irregular pattern of E2\nand FSH secretion oc-\ncurring during the menopausal transition37,38 may con-\nfer neuroendocrine susceptibility to depression in\nvulnerable women.36 However, by its very nature, the\nchanging hormonal milieu during the transitional years\nis difficult to measure adequately. Two studies have sup-\nported this hypothesis.2,39 Freeman et al2 found that over\n8 years of follow-up of 231 premenopausal women with-\nout high depressive symptoms at baseline, average vari-\nability in the means of FSH and E2\nlevels was signifi-\ncantly positively associated with odds of high depressive\nsymptoms. Ryan et al39 reported that among postmeno-\npausal women, declines in serum E2\nlevels and large in-\ncreases in FSH levels over 2 years were associated with\nincreased odds of high depressive symptoms, but abso-\nlute hormone levels were not. These studies included only\nselect periods of the menopausal transition, including pre-\nmenopause and early perimenopause in the study by Free-\nman and colleagues and postmenopause in the study by\nRyan and colleagues. Neither study encompassed the en-\ntire menopausal transition through postmenopause. The\nuse of 2 annual blood draws 1 month apart by Freeman\net al2 may have increased the ability to detect effects of\nhormones during the transition. In the postmenopausal\ncohort,39 serum hormone levels of E2\nand FSH are more\nstable than are those obtained in perimenopausal wom-\nen; thus, the hormone measures may be more reliably\ninformative.\nTable 4.

Finally, among\nwomen with polycystic ovary syndrome, a common en-\ndocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, log\nT\nand depression were positively associated.55\nThe inconsistency in the results of multiple studies\nof T and mood associations may be explained in part by\nOdds Ratio\nQuartile\nA\nQuartile\nC\nOdds Ratio\nD\nB\nFigure 2.

Further,\nthe positive associations between log\nT and depression have\nbeen reported largely in select samples during periods\nof reproductive hormone fluctuations and extreme ex-\ncursions as exemplified by puberty, by peripartum, and\npremenstrually or among women with an endocrine dis-\norder, suggesting that the hormonal milieu at these times\nmay alter the dynamics of the relationship between T and\ndepressive symptoms in vulnerable women.\nIn women, the adrenal glands and the ovaries are the\nmain sources of circulating T, derived either directly from\nthese organs or indirectly through the peripheral con-\nversion of androstenedione.22,56 Testosterone is also aro-\nmatized to estradiol and, similar to E2\n, T increases den-\nsity of serotonin receptors in the brain.40 If this were the\nmechanism by which T influences mood, we would ex-\npect to find an inverse association between T and mood.\nOn the other hand, perhaps the relative androgenicity of\nthe hormonal milieu as women move through the meno-\npausal transition influences neurotransmission and dis-\nrupts mood. However, we found no significant effects of\na higher level of serum T relative to E2\n-T ratio) or\nchange in this ratio on depressive symptoms, which may\nbe owing to the limitations of annual serum samples to\nadequately measure the variability in E2\nlevels during the\nmenopausal transition. As noted later, T is not subject\nto the same variability.\nNoteworthy is that although we observed a significant\nassociation of log\nT with depressive symptoms, this was sub-\nstantially smaller than those between other independent\nvariables and symptoms, including menopausal status.\nImportantly,upsettinglifeeventsincreasedtheoddsofhigh\ndepressive symptoms by 2.5- to 5-fold, and high social sup-\nport decreased the odds by one-fifth.\nThe study had several limitations. Serum samples were\ncollected annually, which underrepresents the variabil-\nand FSH levels and limits the capturing of the\ndynamic nature of the changes in these hormones dur-\ning the early menopausal transition and the increasing\nmenstrual irregularity of late perimenopause. This is some-\nwhat less of a problem for the measurement of T be-\ncause it changes more slowly with age and is not subject\nto the variability that E2\nand FSH levels are during the\nmenopausal transition.22,57 Commercially available T as-\nsays have limitations.58 Therefore, SWAN used a modi-\nfied immunoassay that extends the low limit of detec-\ntion and was cross validated with mass spectrometry.\nAnother limitation was that the CES-D is a measure of\ndepressivesymptoms,notmajordepression.Additionally,\nsome studies in primary care settings show that the cut-\noff score of 16 or higher is also a useful screen for general\nanxietyandpanicdisorders59,60 andthattheCES-Dishighly\ncorrelated with anxiety measures such as the Beck Anxi-\netyInventory(r=0.68),59 suggestingthattheCES-Disnot\nspecificfordepression.However,ouranalysesusingahigher\nCES-Dcutoffscore(22)showedresultsconsistentwith\nthose identified with the cutoff score of 16 or higher.\nTo our knowledge, the current study is the first lon-\ngitudinal study of serum hormones, particularly T, and\ndepressive symptoms to be conducted in a large and di-\nverse sample of midlife women traversing the meno-\npausal transition. The results are independent of mul-\ntiple relevant and confounding covariates, including BMI\nand the presence of vasomotor symptoms. Notably, the\nassociation between menopausal status and high depres-\nsive symptoms remained strong and consistently inde-\npendent of any of the specific hormones. Along with the\nmodest association between T and high depressive symp-\ntoms, this suggests that high depressive symptoms dur-\ning the menopausal transition are unlikely to be due only\nto levels of or marked changes in the reproductive hor-\nmone environment during this period.\nStudy of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)\nClinical Centers\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor: MaryFran Sowers, PhD, principal investigator; Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston:\nRobert Neer, MD, principal investigator 1994 to 1999; Joel Finkelstein, MD, principal investigator 1999 to present; Rush\nUniversity Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois: Lynda Powell, PhD, principal investigator 1994 to 2009, Howard Kravitz, DO,\nMPH, principal investigator 2009 to present; University of California, Davis/Kaiser: Ellen Gold, PhD, principal investigator;\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles: Gail Greendale, MD, principal investigator; University of Medicine and Dentistry\u00ad\nNew Jersey Medical School, Newark: Gerson Weiss, MD, principal investigator 1994 to 2004; Nanette Santoro, MD, prin-\ncipal investigator 2004 to present; and University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Karen Matthews, PhD, principal\ninvestigator.\nNational Institutes of Health Program Office\nNational Institute of Nursing Research, Bethesda: program officers.\nCentral Laboratory\nUniversity of Michigan: Daniel McConnell, PhD (Central Ligand Assay Satellite Services).\nCoordinating Center\nNew England Research Institutes, Watertown, Massachusetts: Sonja McKinlay, PhD, principal investigator 1995 to 2001;\nUniversity of Pittsburgh: Kim Sutton-Tyrrell, PhD, principal investigator 2001 to present.\nSteering Committee\nChris Gallagher, MD, chair; Susan Johnson, MD, chair.\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.
