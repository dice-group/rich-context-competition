    "abstract": "Abstract\nResearch in social psychology has long established that racism emerges when people are threatened or confront negative\nexperiences (e.g., economic deprivation). An implicit assumption is that, conversely, positive experiences will be associated\nwith greater tolerance. Using national surveys, the present study contradicts this common sense expectation by revealing\nthat life satisfaction is also positively related to racism. Consistent with relative gratification theory, two psychological\nprocesses may partially account for this counterintuitive effect: increased national pride and endorsement of status quo\nideologies that support the advantages enjoyed by those who receive benefits from the society (i.e., political conservatism).\n",

The\nimplied converse is that positive experiences will lead to\ngreater tolerance. While the impact of negative life experi-\nences on racism has been studied for more than half a cen-\ntury, we know very little about the effect of the positive\nexperiences that tend to be associated with life satisfaction\n(Pettigrew, 2002). Interestingly, recent research in social\npsychology suggests that positive life experiences may actu-\nally be related to elevated levels of racism. This counterintui-\ntive theorizing points to the need to examine the link between\nracism and life satisfaction.\nInterestingly for our purpose, recent research reveals that\nRelative Gratification, the complete opposite of Relative\nDeprivation, is a powerful determinant of various forms of\nhostile intergroup attitudes (see, for example, Dambrun,\nAccording to Relative Gratification Theory (Dambrun,\nTaylor, McDonald, Crush, & M\u00e9ot, 2006), at least two psy-\nchological processes might explain the reasons why\nincreased life satisfaction could lead to higher levels of rac-\nism. First, people who feel satisfied with their circum-\nstances in life will naturally feel an elevated attraction to,\nand pride in, the nation state that supports their desirable\nliving conditions. Importantly, high levels of national pride\nhave been linked to increased racism (Branscombe &\nWann, 1992). Second, because people of privilege tend to\nendorse ideologies that favor the maintenance of their\nadvantaged lifestyle, (right-wing) political conservatism\nshould also mediate this effect. This is because political\nconservatism provides moral and intellectual support for\nthe status quo by resisting change, and rationalizing the\nexistent inequalities (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway,\n2003). In sum, we hypothesized a bilinear relationship\nbetween the life satisfaction-dissatisfaction continuum and\nracism, such that the negative and positive extremes of the\ncontinuum would be associated with greater racism.\nMoreover, we hypothesized that the effect of life satisfac-\ntion on racism would be mediated by national pride and\npolitical conservatism.\nMethod\nUsing the 1988 Euro-Barometer Survey, we tested our pre-\ndictions among participants from four European countries\n(France, Great Britain, Netherlands, and West Germany;\nn = 4,056). Different scales assessed four separate constructs:\nlife satisfaction-dissatisfaction, national pride, political con-\nservatism, and racism. Two items comprised the life satisfac-\ntion measure (e.g., \"All in all to what extent would you say\nyou are satisfied with the life you lead at this time?\";\n1Clermont Universit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, LAPSCO, CNRS,\nClermont-Ferrand, France\n2McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nMicha\u00ebl Dambrun, UFR de Psychologie, Clermont Universit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9\nBlaise Pascal, LAPSCO UMR CNRS, 34 avenue Carnot, Clermont-\nEmail: michael.dambrun@univ-bpclermont.fr\nThe Counterintuitive Association\nBetween Life Satisfaction and Racism\nMicha\u00ebl Dambrun1 and Donald M.

A single item assessed politi-\ncal conservatism (i.e., \"In political matters, people talk of\n\"the left\" [1] and \"the right\" [10]. How would you place\nyour views on this scale?\" Item 476). Finally, racism was\nmeasured using a 21-item scale (e.g., \"outgroup members\"\nliving here should not push themselves where they are not\nwanted\"; 1 = strongly agree, 4 = strongly disagree;  = .90;\n\"Outgroups\" included Turks (Sample 1, n = 1,047) in West\nGermany, Asians (Sample 2; n = 507) and North Africans\n(Sample 3; n = 494) in France, Surinamers (Sample 4;\nand Asians (sample 6; n = 500) and West Indians (sample\n7; n = 509) in Great Britain. Details about the sampling\nprocedures and the full schedule of the Euro-Barometer 30\nsurvey are available in Reif and Melich (1991).\nResults\nThe predicted bilinear model assumes a different slope for\nparticipants who enjoy life satisfaction (i.e., ratings equal\nor above the median) than for those who experience life\ndissatisfaction (i.e., ratings below the median). Confirming\nour main hypothesis, the bilinear function was significant\nated with greater levels of racism.\nTo better understand this intriguing relationship between\nlife satisfaction and racism, we used structural equation\nmodeling, and our predicted mediation model received\nstrong support (see Figure 1). This model, without the dotted\nline between life satisfaction and racism, produced a good fit\nwith the observed covariance. The chi-square value was not\nan increase in national pride (z = 6.66, p < .01) and political\nconservatism (z = 4.96, p < .01) significantly mediated the\neffect of life satisfaction on racism.\nDiscussion\nAfter decades of research on the negative life experiences\nthat are associated with racism, the present study reveals\nthat life satisfaction is also associated with greater racism,\nand apparently to the same degree as life dissatisfaction.\nThus, a more complete understanding of racism demands\nthat the role of positive life experiences for perpetrators be\naddressed.\nThese results confirm the key role of relative deprivation,\nbut in addition reveal that the relative gratification effect on\nintergroup attitudes, previously largely unexplored is robust\nand not limited to the laboratory context and to some coun-\ntries such as France (Guimond & Dambrun, 2002) or South\nAfrica ( Dambrun, Taylor, McDonald, Crush & M\u00e9ot, 2006).\nAn important aim of the present research was to explore\nthe potential mediating role of ethnic identification and politi-\ncal conservatism. We hypothesized that when people are sat-\nisfied with their circumstances in life, they might feel more\nattracted to and pride in the national state that supports their\ndesirable living conditions. Because stronger national identi-\nfication tends to be related to an increased bias against out-\ngroups (e.g., Dambrun, Taylor, et al., 2006; Perreault &\nBourhis, 1999), national identification should act as a media-\ntor of the effect of life satisfaction on intergroup attitudes.\nThe results of the present research provide a clear support for\nthis hypothesis. The model by which national identification\nmediates the effect of life satisfaction on racism was statisti-\ncally significant. However, when people are in a state of rela-\ntive gratification, they find themselves in a privileged position\n(Kawakami & Dion, 1995). Greater prejudice toward out-\ngroups may emerge in an attempt to justify and maintain such\nprivileges. As Crocker, Major, and Steele (1998) argue,\n\"People of higher status may stigmatize those of lower status\nto justify their advantages\" (p. 509). Because political conser-\nvatism provides moral and intellectual support for the status\nquo by resisting change, and rationalizing the existent\ninequalities (Jost et al., 2003), we predicted that political con-\nservatism also would mediate the relationship between life\nsatisfaction and racism. Again, the results provide support for\nthis hypothesis. The model by which political conservatism\nmediates the effect of life satisfaction on racism also was sta-\ntistically significant. The path-analysis confirms that national\nidentification and political conservatism were two indepen-\ndent mediators of this relationship. These results are the first\nto our knowledge supporting the hypothesis that when people\nfeel gratified or satisfied with their life circumstances, they\nenter in a process of justification and maintenance of their\nLife\nsatisfaction\nNational\npride\nPolitical\nconservatism\nRacism\nFigure 1. National pride and political conservatism as two\nmediators of the effect of life satisfaction on racism.\nDambrun and Taylor 3\nadvantaged position. Of course, a deeper investigation of this\njustification process is needed.\nWhile the results of the present research support our\nhypotheses, it must be acknowledged that the correlations\nbetween the variables are modest, accounting for a small per-\ncentage of variance. Because the present study is based on a\ncorrelational design, no strong claims about causal relations\namong variables can be made. For example, future research\ncould examine the mediating role of national identification\nand political conservatism using an experimental design. On\nthe positive side, the present research design provides an\nadequate ecological validity.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBranscombe, N.
