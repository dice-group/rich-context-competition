A smooth and seamless work experience has been the goal to strive for. Based\non document analysis and interviews with 15 stakeholders, we trace the setting up of a data infrastructure in Danish\nGeneral Practice that had achieved just this goal \u00ad only to end in a scandal and subsequent loss of public support. The\nease of data access made it possible for data to be extracted, exchanged and used by new actors and for new purposes \u00ad\nwithout those producing the data fully realizing the expansion of the infrastructure. We suggest that the case has wider\nrelevance for a still more data-intensive healthcare sector and a growing data economy: when those who produce the\ndata are not made aware of new uses of data, it makes it more difficult to resolve potential conflicts along the way. In the\nDanish case, conflicting views on legitimate data use led to the collapse of the infrastructure. Therefore, while seam-\nlessness may be a solution to the old problem of a poor fit between user and technology, this celebrated virtue may also\ninvolve new problems relating to social instability. As digital solutions tend to be integrated still more seamlessly in still\nmore of our activities, we need to develop political mechanisms to define and protect the rights and obligations of both\ndata suppliers and users in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of digital infrastructures.\n",

General practitioners [GPs]\nhave reported such information to a national database\nfor years without obtaining patients' consent. (Tynell\nIn the late summer of 2014, Danish news media were\nfull of reports like this. A public controversy developed\naround data extraction from medical records, akin to\nbut fiercer than similar contestations in other countries,\nsuch as Australia, England and the Netherlands\nVezyridis and Timmons, 2017). At the centre of the\nDanish controversy was a particular technology for\nthe extraction, storage and exchange of health data,\nviz. Dansk Almen Medicinsk Database, DAMD (the\nDanish General Practitioners Database). The contro-\nversy took the developers by surprise. DAMD was cele-\nbrated as one of the most important achievements in\nthe history of quality improvement in Danish general\npractice; a `visionary' and `impressive development'\n(Boysen, 2011). However, following the intense media\ndebate and the ensuing parliamentary discussion, the\ndatabase was officially abolished in 2014 and data\nflows were suspended (Langhoff et al., 2016).\n1The Danish Centre of Applied Social Science, VIVE, Denmark\n2Centre for Medical Science and Technology Studies (MeST), University\nof Copenhagen, Denmark\nCorresponding author:\nSarah Wadmann, The Danish Centre of Applied Social Science, VIVE,\nEmail: sawa@vive.dk\nCreative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC BY-NC-ND: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-\nmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) which permits\nnon-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work as published without adaptation or alteration, without further permission provided the\noriginal work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/bds\nDAMD was damned, as it were. This article revisits the\nDAMD case to explore what lessons it may hold for the\nsocial sustainability of digital infrastructures, also\nbeyond general practice and the Danish borders.\nIn building a nationwide infrastructure enabling\nautomatic data extraction from medical records with\nfast and tailored feedback on performance to GPs\n(Schroll et al., 2012), the developers of DAMD had\nmastered what had long been seen as a major challenge\nin digital development, namely to create a good fit\nbetween user and technology to allow for efficient and\nseamless work experiences (Ishii and Ulmer, 1997;\nUschold and Gruninger, 2004; Yankelovich et al.,\n1988). With seamless, we not only mean that the tech-\nnology was well-functioning, but also that it was\nembedded in a wider infrastructure that enabled the\ncollection and exchange of a wealth of health data,\nwithout requiring much effort on the part of those pro-\nviding the data. The ideal of a `digital fit' has long\nguided digital developments (Hyysalo et al., 2016). It\nhas even been worked into regulatory standards, such\nexperience as a precondition for the economic and\nsocial sustainability of digital solutions (International\nOrganization for Standardization, 2015). However, the\nsolution to the problems of yesterday often carries the\ngerm to the problems of tomorrow. The achievement of\nthe much desired `digital fit', led to the emergence of\nnew problems that eventually caused the shutdown of\nDAMD. It has previously been noted that incremental\nadditions of new uses of data that are unrelated to clin-\nical care may threaten the sustainability of digital infra-\nstructures (Winthereik et al., 2007). Such a gradual\nlayering of data uses has also been stated as a cause\nof the collapse in the case of DAMD: Langhoff et al.\n(2016) argue that the gradual inclusion of new data\nusers with agendas clashing with existing ones led the\ndata extraction to become politically contested and\neventually break down. We take this argument a step\nfurther and suggest that the mode of expansion mat-\ntered and that it might in fact contain one of the key\nlessons having value beyond the specific case. We argue\nthat the seamlessness strived for in the `digital fit'\nundermined the social sustainability because it not\nmerely enabled the expansion of data use, but did so\nwithout establishing the political checks and balances\nthrough which the legitimacy of new uses could be\nnegotiated.\nThis point, we believe, is of wider relevance for the\nemerging global infrastructures of the data economy,\neven beyond healthcare. High-tech companies such as\nGoogle, FaceBook, Baidu and Alibaba deal in data,\nand their data markets thrive on seamless technology\nexperiences (Creemers, 2016). On the one hand, these\ncompanies require enormous amounts of data to enable\nthe experience of seamlessness, because it is generated\nthrough tools of machine learning that are dependent\nof massive amounts of data. On the other hand, the\ncompanies depend on seamless data extraction to\nobtain these large amounts of data in the first place.\nIn a self-fuelling process, seamlessness is both the end\nand the means of large parts of the current digitalized\ndata markets. However, the seamless data generation\ntypically comes with a lack of clarity regarding data use\n(Pasquale, 2015). As digital solutions become seam-\nlessly integrated in still more of our activities, we there-\nfore advocate a need for developing political\nmechanisms to define and protect the rights and obli-\ngations of both data suppliers and users, in order to\nensure the sustainability of the emerging digital infra-\nstructures and data markets.\nInfrastructuring, seamlessness and\nsocial sustainability\nhow infrastructures are often mistakenly considered\ntechnical, neutral constructs upon which other entities\nand activities run. Science and Technology Studies\n(STS) scholars argue instead that infrastructures\nshould be understood not as a material conglomer-\nation, but as forms of practice co-produced by human\nand non-human actors; hence, the notion of infrastruc-\nturing (Bowker et al., 2010). In the words of Star and\nemerges for people in practice, connected to activities\nand structure'. Infrastructures are built, rebuilt and\nfunction in certain ways, depending on which actors\nare involved in which ways, and how they are related\n(Danholt and Langstrup, 2012). Analytically, infra-\nstructure therefore `appears only as a relational prop-\nerty, not as a thing stripped of use' (Star and Ruhleder,\nstructures tends to focus on the technical integration\nof system components (Ellingsen and Monteiro,\n2003), it is equally important to recognize the context-\nual nature of medical information and the work it\nrequires to make the information meaningful outside\na particular context (Berg and Goorman, 1999).\nWhen referring to this dynamic process of creating,\nextracting, curating and storing data while simultan-\neously making them available for multiple purposes,\nwe use the notion of intensified data sourcing (Hoeyer,\nthis work to non-human actors operating on the basis\nof algorithms and other scripts (Stacey and Suchman,\n2012). This may allow for seamless work experiences\nbecause the extraction, processing and storing of data\nrequire no immediate effort by the user. However, it\nalso creates challenges of opacity, as it becomes\n2 Big Data & Society\nincreasingly difficult for users to grasp how the data\nsourcing occurs unless specific effort is made to create\nDiscussions on visibility and invisibility in relation\nto infrastructure have a long history in STS. Star (1999)\nnoted that `the normally invisible quality of working\ninfrastructure becomes visible when it breaks' suggest-\ning that infrastructures are rarely noticed until they\nbreak down. Bowker et al. (2010) made a call for STS\nto do the work of what he called an `infrastructural\ninversion': making visible the backstage and often\nunder-valued work of infrastructuring and tracing the\npolitics buried in technical encodings. Contrasting this\napproach, others have paid attention to the ways in\nwhich infrastructures are made visible as political sym-\nbols. Larkin (2013) emphasises what he calls `the grand\nspectacles' of infrastructures: they often serve as highly\nvisible symbols in political projects, even when they do\nlittle infrastructural work. The breakdown of DAMD\nmade this infrastructure visible, while bringing an end\nto the infrastructural work \u00ad and we seek to understand\nhow the seamless mode of data sourcing influenced the\nability of the involved actors to `see' the digital infra-\nstructure they were part of and how the infrastructure\nwas made visible by the actors as part of political\nprojects.\nThe sustainability of digital infrastructures is not just\na matter of technical integration; they embark on both\ntechnical and social resources to evolve and endure\n(Bowker et al., 2010). Often, the failure of digital sys-\ntems to become infrastructures is depicted as unsuccess-\nful attempts to link with other systems and adapt to\nchanges in the environment (Edwards et al., 2009;\nEllingsen and Monteiro, 2003). In the present case,\nthe integration arguably became too successful\n(Langhoff et al., 2016) \u00ad but only because the expansion\nhappened in a way that did not allow for political\nrenegotiation of the interests at stake. It is this empha-\nsis on conflicting views on legitimate data sourcing we\nmean to signify when referring to the social sustainabil-\nity of infrastructures.\nWhere and how: Exploring the DAMD\ninfrastructure\nTo understand the historical rise and fall of DAMD, we\ntracked publicly available documents, and arranged\nthem into a timeline. The documents include articles in\nnational newspapers and professional journals (e.g.,\nDagens Medicin), an investigation of the case underta-\nken by a national healthcare authority (Statens Serum\nInstitut, 2014), news updates, annual reports and a\nresponse to the before-mentioned investigation pub-\nlished by the Danish general practice quality unit\n(retrieved from: www.dak-e.dk). Because various\ninstitutions and persons have differing interests in the\npresentation of the case, we made sure to include\naccounts that represented various viewpoints. Based\non this overview, we identified actors who either\nworked with or sought to influence decisions regarding\ndata sourcing in general practice.2 We contacted them\nfor semi-structured interviews to explore their percep-\ntion of the DAMD case and how data mattered to\nthem. Some of these actors played a central role in the\ndevelopment of the case, as they were involved in the\ndevelopment of the database, the administration of it\nor the political debate that ensued around it. Hence,\nthe topic is sensitive to them. To protect the identity of\nthe informants who requested this, we have had to with-\nhold information on the exact position from which they\nspoke. Interviews were conducted with 15 informants.\nThe interviews lasted between 65 and 180 minutes and\nwere recorded, transcribed and coded based on open\nempirical questions including: How are purposes of\ndata sourcing expressed, by whom and when? When\ndoes the infrastructure become visible for whom and in\nwhich ways? When do controversies arise, and what are\nthey about? From the interviews it became clear that the\nnotion of visibility of the infrastructure also mattered for\nhow the case evolved. Hence, the visibility of the infra-\nstructure became an empirical phenomenon worth\nexploring in its own right. We explored when it\nbecame visible and for whom, how the seamlessness of\nthe infrastructure mattered in this respect, and in which\nways the infrastructure was made visible. Before we\nmove to the analysis of these processes, some informa-\ntion about the Danish context is necessary.\nDenmark: A data-intensive country\nDenmark is a small and relatively wealthy welfare state\nin Northern Europe with 5.7 million inhabitants. While\nthe Ministry of Health is ultimately responsible for the\nnational healthcare system, five regional authorities are\npolitically and administratively responsible for organiz-\ning the delivery of healthcare, including GP services.\nHealthcare services are paid mainly through taxes and\nare free at the point of delivery for all citizens. GPs are\nself-employed but receive most of their income from the\nregional healthcare authority with which they contract.\nThese contracts are based on collective agreements.\nCitizens register with a GP, who will then refer them\nto the specialized healthcare services if necessary.\nThere is an option of side-stepping the referral and\nincreasing one's free choice of provider in return for a\nco-payment, but only 1% of the population make use\nof this coverage option (Olejaz et al., 2012). In this way,\nGPs act as gatekeepers to the healthcare services as well\nas custodians of a longitudinal health record (cf.\nWadmann and Hoeyer 3\nIn Denmark, the infrastructure of health data\nexchange goes to the core of the organization of the\nwelfare services, and its contestation potentially affects\neverything that professionals and citizens do. Compared\nto many other countries, the Nordic countries are not\nonly developed welfare states; they are also highly data\nintensive. We prefer the notion of data-intensive health-\ncare to the more fashionable notion of Big Data because\nit captures better the basic observation that multiple\nactors aim for more data, of a better quality and on\nmore people without necessarily agreeing on what the\nDenmark has also aimed for the position of being a\ndigital frontrunner, and the country is repeatedly rated\nas one of the most digitalized countries in the world\n(Frost & Sullivan, 2017). In the area of healthcare, con-\nsiderable state resources have been invested during the\npast four decades in the digitalization of medical records\nand in the enabling of data exchange across healthcare\nproviders and different IT systems, e.g., through the\nproduction of standards. The tradition of centralized\ndata registration of citizens, however, dates back to\nthe beginning of the 20th-century. Residence registries\nhave existed since 1924, before that the police kept resi-\ndence records, and with the introduction of a centralized\nperson register (CPR) in 1968 each citizen was assigned\na personal identification number at birth or immigration\n(Willumsen, 1999). The CPR number is used in all inter-\nactions with the public services, including not only\nhealth services, but also social services, education, mili-\ntary service, income and taxation. All this data accumu-\nlation takes place without informed consent. Most\nprivate services use the traceability of the CPR system\ntoo, for example telecommunication, transport, bank-\ning and even gyms and grocery shopping bonus pro-\ngrammes use this number.\nTaken together, these opportunities for tracking of\nindividuals throughout life have given Denmark the\nreputation as `the epidemiologist's dream' (Frank,\n2003). While such state-controlled data assemblage\nwould be controversial in many other contexts, it is\nrarely questioned in Denmark. The seamless data\nexchanges make a number of everyday operations run\nvery smoothly, and though some studies refer to a\n`crisis of trust', surveys of citizen attitudes continue to\nreport relatively high levels of trust in state institutions\n(Mandag Morgen, 2016). However, as the DAMD case\nrose to the national political agenda, it made visible the\nseamless data infrastructure in ways that made some\nhealth professionals and citizens publicly express dis-\ntrust in the public administration of health data.\nWe seek to develop these points, as we now turn to\nthe analysis. The analysis is divided into three parts.\nFirst, we describe the vision that the developers of\nDAMD pursued. Next, we demonstrate how the\npurposes of data sourcing gradually accumulated over\ntime, as more actors were included in the infrastructure.\nWe use the term purposes to signal an ambition of data\nuse; it does not necessarily imply actual use. As we will\ndemonstrate in the analysis, the articulations of ambi-\ntions can have profound effects, even when the actual\nstate of implementation is difficult to pinpoint. Last, we\nshow how the efforts of the developers to enable seam-\nless data flows also made it possible to overlook diver-\ngent views on legitimate data use, until they surfaced as\noutright conflict.\nA vision of data-driven quality\nimprovement\nDAMD was developed around 2005 by a small group\nof pioneering Danish GPs, who had led the way in\ndigitalizing medical records and worked hard to intro-\nduce what they called `data-driven quality develop-\nment' in general practice. For the developers, the\ntools they were developing constituted part of making\ngeneral practice a modern and future-oriented place of\nchronic care. One of the developers, whom we will\nname Erik,3 was a GP himself. Recognizing what he\nsaw as important virtues in general practice, he envi-\nsioned that GPs could lead the way in chronic care.\n`Our virtue is that we know the patients. [. . .] We also\nknow the social conditions and so on', he explained and\ncontinued: `so general practice is really well suited for\nchronic care'. What were missing, according to Erik,\nwere feedback mechanisms that would offer GPs a\nbetter overview of their patient populations and some\nmeans to evaluate their own work in a structured way.\nHe explained: `As a GP [. . .] you'd actually like to know\nhow you're doing'. But because the GPs lacked the\ntools to identify relevant patient populations, Erik\nnoted, it was difficult to know how well the patients\nwere being treated:\nIn general practice, it's patient contact full time. [. . .]\n[GPs] have individual contacts, but not really an over-\nview of the population. [. . .] You may have 20 really\nwell-treated diabetics. But if you haven't found the\nother 50, it might not look so good after all.\nIn the experience of Erik and his collaborators, shifting\nthe perspective from the individual patient to the popu-\nlation made them realize that the most vulnerable\npatients in the greatest need of care were also those\nwho did not show up for check-ups. Hence, to enable\nGPs to care better also for those patients who fail to\nappear they started to set up what they came to see as a\nsystem for `data-driven quality improvement'. DAMD\nwas the result of this work, but more effort was\nrequired before it was in place.\n4 Big Data & Society\nStandardizing, centralizing and automating to\nenable seamless data flows\nA first effort included the standardization of informa-\ntion registration through the development of a Danish\nversion of the International Classification of Primary\nHealth Care (ICPC). This was published in 1992. By\ncoding patient contacts in a uniform manner, Erik\nexplained, he and a handful of colleagues were able to\nstart `retrieving data from the electronic medical\nrecord' and combine them with other data sources,\ne.g., from laboratories. The purpose was to improve\nthe quality of care, and the means was a standardiza-\ntion that would allow comparisons between patients\nand patient populations. However, for the technology\nto fit into the busy work life of GPs, it needed to be\neasier to use. According to Erik, a pilot run in the late\n1990s showed that GPs had to spend a whole day every\nthird month to generate even very simple statistics for\njust one patient group. Erik remembered thinking: `it\nmust be possible to do this in a more rational way'. He\ncontinued: `it made me realize that these data needed to\nbe gathered automatically'. Thus, the developers strived\nto automate the mode of data sourcing. This agenda of\nautomation has become a key feature of the grander\ndata economy, creating a series of invisibilities\n(O'Neil, 2016). In the Danish case, the ambition was\nnot to create invisibility per se, but to generate data\n`without disturbing the physician' (Schroll, 2013: 3).\nThe rationalization efforts included new actors in the\ninfrastructure. Following a collective agreement\nbetween the general practitioners organization (PLO)\nand the regional authorities, a GP Quality Unit called\nDansk Almenmedicinsk Kvalitetsenhed, DAK-E, was\ndevelopers of DAMD, DAK-E was given a prominent\nrole in the data infrastructure. With responsibility for\nthe daily operation of DAMD, DAK-E undertook the\ndata cleaning, developed the algorithms that allowed\nfor the combination and presentation of data and deliv-\nered `readymade quality reports' to the GPs, as Erik\nphrased it. In this way, the `articulation work' neces-\nsary to keep the standardized processes on track was\nmoved from individual GPs to the quality unit (cf.\ndata sourcing also brought a new material actor into\nthe infrastructure: the software Sentinel Datafangst.\nSentinel means lighthouse: it `brings light and shows\nthe way forward in quality development', DAK-E\nexplained (DAK-E, 2013). The Danish notion of\nDatafangst can be translated into Data Catch. So it\nwas called because the software made it possible to\n`catch' data from the medical records, a developer\nexplained. The `catch', or the extraction we might say,\nentailed that the structured information in the\nelectronic medical records was automatically copied\non a daily basis and the copy stored in DAMD.\nHence, GPs could use the tool without bothering\nabout the concrete data management and analysis. In\nsum, through efforts to standardize, centralize and\nautomate the sourcing of data, the developers strived\nto achieve a seamless and efficient work experience, in\norder for the technology to fit into the busy work life of\nthe GPs.\nA helpful tool\nThe result of all these efforts was a system that made\nuse of data recorded as part of routine care and, for the\nfirst time ever, provided GPs with the option of easily\nhaving their patients shown as a population stratified\naccording to registered diagnoses. Clinical indicators\nwere provided for GPs to be able to check the treatment\nstatus of individual patients with certain registered\ndiagnoses. These indicators also allowed for bench-\nmarking against national averages, enabling GPs to\nidentify their own weak spots. For patients with dia-\nbetes, clinical indicators would for example include\nblood sugar levels, blood pressure and prescribed medi-\ncations. Moreover, visual cues were offered to make it\neasier for GPs to detect patients who might require\nclinical attention. For example, colour markings\nwould draw attention to potential risks (e.g., increased\nexcretion of protein through the kidneys, indicating\nkidney impairment) or provide swift identification of\npatients who had not attended an annual check-up\nwithin a given time frame. In addition, cross-tabula-\ntions made by DAK-E on the request of GPs allowed\nfor easy identification of patients who were eligible for\ncertain services (e.g., free influenza vaccination) or were\ntreated with certain medications (e.g., medicines soon\nto lose subsidization). `In this way, you could run the\nclinic more efficiently and provide better treatment for\nthe patients', Erik stated. Not only the developers liked\nthe system. It was also seen as helpful by GP-users, as it\nallowed them to keep better track of patients and pro-\nvided information of relevance to treatment decisions\n(Lippert, 2014). Even people who later became fierce\nopponents of the system look back upon it as being\nhelpful. In the words of one of the GPs who led the\nopposition against DAMD, it provided `a fantastic\noverview' for GPs when treating patients with chronic\ndiseases. A leader from a regional government even\nreferred to the system as `about the best thing that\nhas happened in the Danish healthcare services for\nyears'.\nAt this point in the development, GPs envisaged\ndata circulating in a closed loop. Developers and regio-\nnal authorities agreed with this view and saw GPs as\nboth the data producers and users. The purpose was\nWadmann and Hoeyer 5\nquality development understood as efforts to assist\nindividual GPs (and patients) in making decisions\nabout treatment practices. However, once the standards\nand means for easy data exchange were in place, stake-\nholders saw new opportunities. The purposes of data\nuse that they added transformed the infrastructure; in\nthe words of Langhoff et al. (2016), it fundamentally\naltered the ontology. The incremental addition of pur-\nposes of data use was seamless from the point of view\nof the GPs, in the sense that it did not require any extra\nwork of them (cf. Berg and Goorman, 1999). They\ncould continue their routines, while data began travel-\nling further and acquire new functions.\nThe seamless accumulation of purposes\nFrom overviews serving the individual GP, data from\nDAMD also came to be used for decision-support in\nthe encounter with patients. As collaborations devel-\noped between DAK-E and the scientific college of gen-\neral practitioners in Denmark (Dansk Selskab for\nAlmen Medicin, DSAM), the infrastructure expanded\nand DAMD also came to support the implementation\nof clinical guidelines. While this hardly challenged the\npurpose of enhancing the quality of clinical care, it\nopened up a process of adding new purposes and stake-\nholders to the infrastructure. Table 1 summarizes this\naccumulation of purposes. The table is intended as a\nsimplified illustration of the multitude of purposes and\nfor some of the purposes, it is difficult to say whether\nthey gave rise to actual data practices. In particular, it\nseems that the purposes of audit, healthcare manage-\nment and national economic growth were merely\narticulated as policy ambitions. Nevertheless, these\narticulations had profound effects among these GPs,\nwho disagreed with their legitimacy.\nAs data accumulated, researchers began to apply for\naccess to DAMD data. From about 2010, Erik\nexplained, enough data had been gathered for\nDAMD to constitute `a gold mine of information for\nresearch' and over time about 80 projects made use of\nanonymized data from DAMD. The regional authori-\nties who co-funded the activities also wanted to benefit.\nAccording to an administrative employee, who we will\ncall Morten, the regional authorities felt that `for quite\nsome years it had been limited what the Regions had\ngained from [financing the data collection]' and that the\nRegions `had to create some value'. In 2010, the regio-\nnal authorities initiated negotiations with the Danish\nGP organization about the collective agreement with\nan extensive `wish list', the employee explained, and\nthey succeeded in having most of their demands met.\nConsequently, it became mandatory for GPs to install\nSentinel Datafangst, code patient contacts for eight\nspecified conditions, let data from the medical records\nbe copied to DAMD, and subsequently to clinical data-\nbases administered by the regional authorities. This\nallowed the authorities to pursue an ambition of\ncross-sector quality monitoring by linking data from\ngeneral practice with data generated in the hospitals.\nMoreover, the agreement required GPs to publish\ndata from the medical record on a web portal,\nSundhed.dk (Health.dk), where citizens can access\ntheir own health data online with a log-in, and other\nhealth professionals than the GP are allowed to view it\nwhen relevant for a given treatment. In this way, a new\npurpose of patient empowerment entered the infra-\nstructure along with enhanced opportunities of cross-\nsector care. Whereas GPs had previously had the\noption of letting only selected data be copied to\nDAMD, Erik explained: `Now we had to send all the\ndata to Sundhed.dk. It was in the agreement'.\nTherefore, a material reconfiguration was made that\naltered the data flow profoundly: Sentinel Data Catch\nwas adapted so that all data except case notes were\nautomatically copied from the medical record to\nDAMD. The transfer to Sundhed.dk also necessitated\na translation of diagnostic codes because codes used in\ngeneral practice were not fully compatible with the\ncodes used on Sundhed.dk. In consequence, some\npatients were surprised to read diagnoses on the\nonline portal that they had never heard from their\nTable 1.

Not all translations were equally successful and\neven GPs were surprised by some of the algorithm-led\ntranslations; for instance some codes for mental strain\nwere mistakenly translated into a diagnosis of pyro-\nmania. The subsequent reactions illustrate the increas-\ning visibility of the new data flows for GPs.\nWhile officially serving the goal of patient empower-\nment, it was also acknowledged that enhanced trans-\nparency for patients might enable a new form of\ncontrol. An employee who had been involved in the\nset-up of the data extraction from DAMD to\nSundhed.dk noted that the project was given the work-\ning title `the snitch' because it was envisioned that `citi-\nzens would login and check whether doctors were\ncheating and inform [the authorities], if the doctors\nhad billed services which patients hadn't received'. In\nan interesting move, the system that was designed to\nallow individual doctors to identify the patients who\ndid not comply with treatment plans was now inverted\nand seen as a tool that would allow patients to single\nout the doctors who might not adhere to billing guide-\nlines. This ambition of monitoring doctors rather than\npatients was further expanded, when DAMD came to\nbe seen as a resource for external performance moni-\ntoring. A leader in a regional healthcare administration\nexplained: `you know, there are probably also some\nmavericks in general practice and one could imagine\nthat there might be clinics that do a really poor job'.\nAnother leader elaborated:\nIn my view, it should be a perfectly legitimate request\nfrom a customer \u00ad who pays a considerable sum to a\nprovider to complete a task on behalf of tax-payers and\npatients \u00ad to want some insight into how the task is\nsolved and which outcomes it generates.\nIn the view of these officials, the demand for data is\nlegitimate because it is understood as a precondition\nfor qualified administration of public resources. While\nthey saw it as a legitimate purpose, they also stressed\nthat it required agreement regarding the conditions for\ndata use and collaboration between GP representatives\nand the regional healthcare authorities. According to\nErik, however, he was contacted directly by a head of\ndivision in a region and asked for performance infor-\nmation on individual GPs:\nBefore the negotiations for the collective agreement\n[between the regional authorities and the GPs' organ-\nization] in 2013, [the head of division], called me during\nmy summer holidays and asked for data on which diag-\nnoses were given to the patients who had received con-\nversation therapy. Because he wanted to see if [the fee\nfor] conversation therapy had been used for anything\nelse [than what had been agreed].\nFor some officials, DAMD data was becoming a tool of\naccountability (cf. Winthereik et al., 2007). Other offi-\ncials emphasized the possibility of using DAMD data\nfor planning purposes, e.g., in the setting up of disease\nmanagement programmes, for revealing patterns of\ndemographic change and as early warning signs of epi-\ndemics. According to the informants we encountered,\nthese analyses were never performed, and DAMD data\nwas never forwarded to the regional authorities. DAK-E\nrejected the requests because they found them to be out-\nside the existing agreements. Nevertheless, it is clear that\nonce the set-up allowing for seamless data sourcing was\nin place, it inspired new uses and invited other data\nusers, as has been the case across a range of sectors\nusing new digital tools to reinvent the purposes of data\nAlong with the negotiations with regional authori-\nties, `state pressure' for access to DAMD data was also\ninstituted, people working in DAK-E noted. They\nexplained how representatives from the State Serum\nInstitute (SSI) under the Ministry of Health came to\nvisit in 2013 and requested a copy of all DAMD\ndata. In 2012, SSI had been tasked with the collection\nand dissemination of all national data on population\nhealth, health service activity, economy and quality, in\nan effort to centralize the administration of health data.\nDespite the pressure, DAK-E opposed this request. An\nemployee from DAK-E explained: `you know, the SSI\nwanted to use it for government consultancy \u00ad and gov-\nernment consultancy . . . that is control'. At that time,\nprominent themes in the political debates were reform\nof payment models in the healthcare services inspired\nby British models of pay-for-performance, but also the\nidea that health data constituted an under-used\nresource, which, if used in the right way, could poten-\ntially stimulate economic growth (cf. Vezyridis and\nTimmons, 2017). Hence, political ambitions were\nvoiced to turn Danish health data into a motor of\nnational economic growth, by providing private com-\npanies with easier data access (Regeringen, 2013).\nAccording to DAK-E, all these agendas `created pres-\nsure' and `made everybody nervous about how these\ndata would be used', as one of the informants noted.\nThe informant's notion of `everybody' illustrates an\nemerging sense of data anxiety.\nTo sum up, as new actors became part of the infra-\nstructural practices, DAMD data was put to new forms\nof use. Initially a tool for quality improvement, it also\nbecame articulated as a tool for research, patient\nempowerment, healthcare planning, efficiency gains\nand economic growth. These changes happened grad-\nually and without individual GPs necessarily noticing\nthe change. The seamless data experience was more or\nless unaffected by the new uses and the infrastructure\nremained largely invisible to the GPs and patients\nWadmann and Hoeyer 7\nproviding the data. However, the expansion of the\ninfrastructure involved a considerable potential for\nconflict. GP-users did not experience friction in their\ndaily work, but this did not mean that the potential\nfor conflict disappeared. Rather, conflict arose as GPs\ncame to realize how much data was collected from the\nmedical records and how many purposes data might\nserve. Whereas failure to enrol new actors in an infra-\nstructure is often seen as a cause of instability (e.g.,\nModol and Chekanov, 2014), the situation here appears\nto be reversed: the sustainability was threatened by too\nmuch integration (Langhoff et al., 2016). This propos-\nition we develop in the following as we unfold the con-\ntroversy evolving around DAMD.\nFrom seamless efficiency to fierce\ncontestation\nAn especially loud voice in what was to become a\nheated debate about DAMD came from a small frac-\ntion of GPs for whom the issue of data became a route\nto political engagement. They self-identified as an infor-\nmal group of what they themselves called the `data-\nengaged GPs' and coalesced around a network of\nGPs named SPRAL. SPRAL refers to Selvst\u00e6ndige\nPRAktiserende L\u00e6ger which means Independent\nGeneral Practitioners. For one of the data-engaged\nGPs who led the opposition against DAMD, the grad-\nual expansion of purposes was a key source of concern.\nShe explained: The idea was that DAMD would be `a\ntool to provide the physician with a better overview for\nthe sake of improved patient treatment. But when other\ninterests suddenly crop up, it upsets the whole thing.\nSomehow they don't serve the purpose'. Previously, the\nGP was a very active user of the tools that DAMD\nprovided:\nFor ten years, I have quietly looked after my business.\nI've been a good doctor, coded everything and all that,\nuntil I suddenly realized this . . . this invasion of the\nprofessional authority or whatever you want to call it\n[. . .]. This was crucial for my involvement.\nFirstly, it is important to note her experience of surprise\nwhen she suddenly realized that she provided data for\nmany more purposes than what she thought she had\nsigned up to do. It signals a new visibility of the infra-\nstructure for the GP. This feeling of being surprised\nstayed with her: she likened it to a wide open backdoor\nto the consultation room, in which she had previously\nbelieved that confidential conversations took place. The\ndevelopers of DAMD and the interviewed healthcare\nofficials could not understand this perception. They\nemphasized that the GPs had agreed to have a techni-\ncian come and install the software and had even\nreceived a fee for it from the regional authorities.\nTherefore, they should have known. Nevertheless,\nwhile the GPs were aware that they were providing\nsome data for the purpose of quality development,\nthe expansion of the infrastructure and the exact\ntravel routes of data had remained invisible to them.\nWhen and how did the infrastructure then become\nvisible to the GPs? When referring to an `invasion' of\nher professional authority, the data-engaged GP\nreferred to a particular political process: a process\nthat started with the negotiation of the collective agree-\nment for GPs in 2013 and developed into conflict, ter-\nmination of the agreement and intervention by the\nnational government. In this process, `data meant a\nlot', a former director of DAK-E noted, explaining\nthat the requirement of individual level performance\ndata `led to fierce resistance among the physicians'.\nWhereas the regional authorities saw their requirement\nof data as a legitimate way to ensure efficient spending\nof public resources, a sizeable group of the GPs saw it\nas an unacceptable violation of their professional\nautonomy and patient privacy. Moreover, in line with\nthe explanation of the DAK-E employees, the data-\nengaged GP expressed fears that expanded data\naccess by health authorities would pave the way for\ndata sale. It is unclear whether any concrete plans\nof data sale existed and whether they included\nDAMD data. However, the mere possibility of com-\nmercialization appears to have generated resistance.\nFollowing this value conflict, the data-engaged GPs\nstarted scrutinizing the flow of data from their com-\nputer systems in an effort to make themselves able to\nsee the digital infrastructure they were part of. One of\nthem recalled: `We found out that they not only had\naccess to the projects we'd signed up for [. . .] They had\naccess to the whole lot! This surprised us. This wasn't\nwhat we'd imagined at all'. With `they', the GP was\nreferring to DAK-E. However, the GP soon realized\nshe was part of an infrastructure with even more diffuse\nboundaries: she could not determine exactly who had\naccess to which pieces of information, in which form\nand under which conditions. This experience of diffuse\nboundaries echoes a more general concern expressed in\nrelation to the emerging data economy. As Pasquale\n(2015) notes: `Tracked ever more closely by firms and\ngovernment, we have no clear idea of just how far much\nof this information can travel, how it is used, or its\nconsequences' (p. 3). Through conversations with IT\nproviders, freedom of information requests, close read-\ning of policy documents and other meticulous work, the\ndigital infrastructure started to become visible to the\ndata-engaged GPs.\nMeanwhile, some of the GPs began having reactions\nfrom patients who had been pressured by insurance\ncompanies or municipal authorities to deliver printouts\n8 Big Data & Society\nof their medical records directly from the web portal\nSundhed.dk, thereby sidestepping a doctor's certificate.\nOthers saw how the availability of information at\nSundhed.dk could escalate conflict or even lead to vio-\nlence in some families, because partners or parents\nwould share log-in information and have access to sen-\nsitive health data, e.g., about abortion or sexually\ntransmitted diseases. It is unclear how widespread\nthese situations were. However, the data-engaged GPs\nwere dumbfounded by these scenarios. Akin to what\nhas been observed in a British context (Carter et al.,\n2015), the data-engaged GPs publicly declared DAMD\nand Sentinel Datafangst a serious threat to patients'\ntrust in GPs and a violation of privacy rights; broad-\ncasted among others in YouTube-videos. So, the infra-\nstructure that used to be seen as instrumental for good\npatient care was now made visible by these GPs to a\nbroad public as a threat to patients.\nGalvanized by what they discovered, the data-\nengaged GPs also started to dig into the legal basis\nfor the data activities. As it turned out, this was\nrather unclear. Like in the Swedish LifeGene case\ndescribed by Cool (2016), the infrastructure for data\nexchange had expanded in ways that did not fit the\nexisting legal categories. According to the data-engaged\nGP introduced above, she and some of her colleagues\nsought to voice their concerns over what they saw as\nillegitimate and illegal data activity. However, they felt\nthat they were not being heard \u00ad not even by their rep-\nresentatives in the GPs' own organization: `No one\ncould hear us!' the GP prompted. This fuelled an\nalready existing power struggle among the GPs.\nMeanwhile, the national government had intervened\nin the conflict between the regional authorities and\nthe GPs. Breaking with the tradition of consensus-\nbased regulation through collective agreements, legisla-\ntive measures were prepared that forced the GPs to\nreport certain data to DAMD and made them subject\nto fines if they did not. As a consequence, the data-\nengaged GPs and others from the SPRAL network\ndeclared themselves prepared to terminate their con-\ntracts with the regional healthcare authorities and\nbecome truly independent from the public healthcare\nsystem. Moreover, two of the data-engaged GPs\nturned against their own representatives as they\nreported DAK-E and a regional government to the\npolice for illegal data activity. The day before the new\nlegislation was to enter into force, the same two GPs\nmade it a Facebook-event when they and about 70 col-\nleagues de-installed the Data Catch software, which\nallowed for automatic data extraction. Ironically, we\nmay note, the use of Facebook to mobilize resistance\nmeant that in order to defend privacy the GPs ended up\nusing a commercial platform known for its voracious\nappetite for personal data. This seems to be the\nsituation in a data-intensive society, where nobody is\nable to know every aspect of the data sourcing in which\nthey take part (Obar, 2015). The resistance of the GPs\nsoon caught the attention of journalists. In the subse-\nquent broadcasting of the case in national news media,\nthe data extraction was repeatedly presented as illegal.\nIn the course of the visibility created by the ensuing\npublic debate, the focus of the parliamentary discussion\nbegan revolving around the legality of the data collec-\ntion per se, and citizens started to demand that their\ndata be deleted: about 20,000 citizens asked to opt out.\nIn the autumn of 2014, a consensus seems to be reached\namong the national and regional healthcare authorities\nthat the data extraction probably was illegal and the\ndata sourcing was suspended. It took another three\nyears before the GPs and the Regions reached an agree-\nment that opened up for the sourcing of selected types\nof data for selected purposes starting in the autumn of\nDiscussion and conclusion\nFor years, the challenge in digitalization of healthcare\nhas been one of creating a `digital fit' between users and\ntechnologies: a smooth and seamless work experience\nwith a minimum of friction. In this paper, we have\ntraced the rise and fall of a technology that had\nachieved just this goal. A group of dedicated GPs had\ncreated a promising infrastructure for data exchange; it\nprovided easy and efficient data traffic and it was\nacknowledged for being helpful in the daily practice\nof GPs. The efforts of the developers to obtain seamless\nwork experiences facilitated expansion of the infra-\nstructure to encompass still more purposes; an expan-\nsion that remained largely invisible to the practicing\nGPs because it did not require additional work (cf.\nBerg and Goorman, 1999). Data multiplied, as copies\nwere made and distributed to new actors and for new\npurposes. Hence, the seamlessness first created invisibil-\nity for those who produced the data (cf. Star and\nRuhleder, 1996), which in turn created a `spectacle'\nthat overshadowed the practical evaluation of what\nthe technology could and should do (cf. Larkin,\n2013). Eventually, it caused the collapse of the\nDAMD infrastructure.\nThe added purposes reflected competing political\nprojects. While first serving as a tool for doctors to\nmonitor their patients, the political vectors gradually\nturned, and the data sourcing software grew into a\npotential tool for patients and authorities to monitor\ntheir doctors. STS scholars have already observed how\ndigitalization of the medical record involved a trans-\nformation of the record itself from a clinical tool in\nthe hands of the GP to an audit tool in the hands of\nauthorities (e.g., Winthereik et al., 2007); simply\nWadmann and Hoeyer 9\nbecause data are available in an exchangeable format,\nthe payers of the services can also demand data access.\nOur point is to consider how this transformation can\nlead to social conflict and in particular how the other-\nwise praised virtue of seamlessness plays a role in this\nprocess. Seamlessness made the expansion of data uses\ninvisible, but did not erase the conflicting interests and\npolitical values. Seamlessness, in this way, has political\nimplications but offers no political tools for handling\npotential conflicts.\nAs already mentioned, the Danish case is not unique.\nIn England, care.data was met with opposition, when it\nbecame known that the database enabled reuse of data\nfrom electronic medical records from general practice\nfor research and other purposes, including the aim of\nstimulating national economic growth (Carter et al.,\n2015). Also here, it was not a question of technical\nproblems bringing data sourcing to a halt, but an\ninability to ensure political legitimacy (Vezyridis and\nout a tendency among decision-makers to focus on\nthe technical capabilities of new IT systems, while over-\nlooking the moral complexities of digitalized data sour-\ncing. In an American context, investigative journalist\nTanner (2017) calls attention to the invisible, seamless\nand ubiquitous data sourcing from pharmacies, labora-\ntories and clinics, which bolsters commercial markets\nfor health data, without providing the data sources \u00ad\nthe patients \u00ad with any tools of control. These examples\ndemonstrate how a seamless data exchange might have\nbeen a solution to the old problem of a poor fit between\nuser and technology; but new dangers lurk in its after-\nmath, if we do not develop tools to negotiate the legit-\nimacy of the emerging data infrastructures.\nWhile we have pointed out cases of conflict, it is\nequally important to note that not all efforts to build\nup health-data infrastructures are troubled in this way\nand Timmons, 2016). For example, the Scottish\nHealth Informatics Programme (SHIP) involved work\nto develop a new governance model, where `early and\nsustained stakeholder engagement was invaluable to\nidentifying the key and diverse ethical, legal, social\nand practical issues implicated in delivering a more\nThis is not to say that the Scottish governance model\nwill never encounter resistance or necessarily work else-\nwhere, but we think it points to a need for the develop-\nment of political mechanisms suited for the local\ncontext, to ensure the social sustainability of data infra-\nstructures. Discussion of the politics of social sustain-\nability must also take into account knowledge about\ndata validity. It is well-known that validity is affected\nby data reuse (Markus, 2001), and that healthcare pro-\nfessionals tend to report data strategically when they\nare aware that data are being used for control purposes\ncated way with political mechanisms must therefore\nalso involve engagement with studies of the social\nmechanisms of data reuse and not be limited to legal\ncontemplation of patient rights.\nThe paradox of seamlessness as a source of social\ninstability has even greater relevance when we look\nbeyond healthcare to the global data markets created\nby the big US high-tech companies, Microsoft, Google,\nFacebook, Apple and Amazon, as well as their Chinese\ncounterparts Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (Creemers,\n2016). They thrive on seamless technology experiences.\nWhile providing for easy use, however, seamlessness\nalso creates a blurred sense of control. As Obar\n(2015) notes, people are left with an obscure and insur-\nmountable task, should they be held responsible for\nmonitoring all data sourcing in which they engage in\na digitalized society. When the `digital fit' is finally\nachieved, new dangers lure in the shadows of the effort-\nless interface. The problems of sustainability, that we\nforefront here, are of course not the only dangers that\nneeds to be confronted considering the challenges to\ndemocracy, the role of media, national security and\npublic trust that digitalized data accumulation also\nwe find the discussion of social sustainability a fruitful\nplace to start as it raises questions of which mechanisms\nthat may be needed to ensure that users are able to see\nthe political work that is also being done by expanding\ndigital infrastructures.\nIf seamlessness is not just an ideal of technical oper-\nationability, but also a source of social instability, an\nimportant task for STS lies in supporting the establish-\nment of new forums for the negotiation of conflicting\nvalues related to data sourcing. In efforts to enable data\nexchange, friction can be seen as the antithesis of seam-\nlessness. Edwards (2010) speaks of `data friction' as `the\ncost in time, energy, and attention required simply to\ncollect, check, store, move, receive, and access data' (p.\n84). Friction creates a form of awareness of all the work\ngoing into data sourcing (cf. Berg and Goorman, 1999),\nbut we are now at a stage where it takes other means to\ncreate this awareness. It is hardly a solution to reintro-\nduce data friction and make the course of everyday\nwork more difficult, just to raise awareness of data\nuses. Rather, we suggest that there is a new need to\nfocus attention beyond the digital fit to political mech-\nanisms for negotiation of values and interests to ensure\nthe long-term sustainability of digital infrastructures.\nAlong with the already massive investments in new\ntechnologies, we need to allocate resources to the devel-\nopment of political mechanisms to define and protect\nthe rights and obligations of both data suppliers and\nusers. We do not hold a solution, nor do we believe in a\n10 Big Data & Society\nmaster plan, but we find it necessary for new initiatives\nto be introduced aimed at investigating what it takes for\ndigital infrastructures to be socially sustainable. First\nand foremost, it must be acknowledged that reuse of\ndata comes at a cost, and that some purposes may con-\nflict and eventually undermine an infrastructure. There\nare forms of reuse that are technically feasible but not\nworthwhile, considering the implications they have for\nprimary purposes. Moreover, the easy click to agree to\nterms of use provided by most social media platforms\ndoes not perform well \u00ad it is part of the problem (Obar,\n2015). Rather, a more socially sustainable digital devel-\nopment will necessitate development of legal frame-\nworks at both national and international levels to\nprotect data sources against data use working against\ntheir interests. This need for regulation has been\nacknowledged at the EU level. In August 2017, EU\nCommissioner of Competition Margrethe Vestager,\nwho has gained fame for battling the dominance of\nthe high-tech giants, called for a joint effort among\ninternational leaders to develop an International Data\nConvention (Fejerskov, 2017). It will take years of dedi-\ncated efforts to establish such an international conven-\ntion (and it will undoubtedly create new problems). In\nthe meantime there is work to be done in stipulating\nnational legal entitlements in relation to, for example,\ntransparency and limits to data uses (e.g., by limiting\nthe market in data profiles used in recruitment, credit\nscoring, etc.), and in providing citizens with rights to\nrectify erroneous data profiles. Other options could be\ndemocratically elected or administratively appointed\ndata guardians who can be held responsible for think-\ning through when and whether data reuse negatively\naffects the primary purposes of data collection.\nNone of these suggestions will in and by themselves\ncreate social sustainability, but we need to begin open-\ning new political spaces in which a multiplicity of new\ntools may develop and conflicting values can be nego-\ntiated. The dangers of the digital fit involve a challenge\nto democratic governance, and we need to find ways to\naddress this challenge without ruining the pleasures of a\nseamless user experience.\n"
