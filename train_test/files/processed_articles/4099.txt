The reported difference in the EQ-\n5D-3L score between the intervention group (intra-\narterial treatment) and the control group was not sig-\n0.18).1 Patient who died before assessment of the EQ-\n5D-3L were not included in the analyses. This was the\ndefault statistical approach. However, in the EQ-5D\nvaluations of health states, which make use of the\nTTO method, the state of death is given the anchor\nvalue of 0. We felt that these valuations should be\nincluded in order to reflect the total loss of quality of\nlife due to stroke.\nThe rather small and nonsignificant effect of treat-\nment on the EQ-5D-3L was remarkable since all clinical\n(modified Rankin Score, NIH Stroke Scale, and Barthel\nIndex) and radiological outcome scores favored the\nintervention.\nAims\nThe purpose of this study was to reanalyze the effect of\nintra-arterial treatment for intracranial large vessel\nocclusion in acute ischemic stroke patients on health-\nrelated quality of life. In the present study we included\npatients who died during follow-up. We estimated the\neffect of IAT on the total score, the EQ-5D-3L, and the\nscore on its dimensions. Furthermore, we studied\nthe relation with other clinical outcome measures like\nthe modified Rankin Score, the NIH Stroke Scale, and\nBarthel Index.\nMethods\nStudy design\nPatient eligibility and methods of the MR CLEAN trial\nhave been reported previously.1,2 In short, MR\nCLEAN was a randomized clinical trial of IAT versus\nno IAT along with best medical care in patients with a\nproximal intracranial arterial occlusion in the anterior\ncirculation demonstrated on vessel imaging, treatable\nwithin 6 h after symptom onset.\nOutcome measures\nEQ-5D-3L was scored at 90 days after inclusion. The\nEQ-5D-3L consists of a descriptive system with five\ndimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/\ndiscomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension\nhas three levels: 1, no problems; 2, some problems; 3,\nextreme problems. When three levels are included a\ntotal of 243 (35) possible health states are defined.\nThe EQ-5D-3L score was converted into a utility\nindex through a country-specific value set (the Dutch\ntariff).3,4 The Dutch tariff was established on the basis\nof the time trade-off method. The values represent the\npreferences of the Dutch population. Patients who died\nbefore the follow-up interviews at 90 days received a\nzero score on the EQ-5D-3L, an anchor score in the\nhigher values indicating a better quality of life. A\nsingle experienced investigator, who was unaware of\nthe treatment assignments, interviewed the patient,\nproxy, or health care provider by telephone to assess\nStatistics\nDifference in EQ-5D-3L utility scores between treat-\nment arms was compared with the Mann\u00adWhitney U\ntest. Treatment effect on the EQ-5D-3L utility score\nwas estimated with the use of linear regression.1,2 The\neffect of treatment on the EQ-5D-3L was adjusted for\nage, NIH Stroke Scale at baseline, time from stroke\nonset to randomization, previous stroke, atrial fibrilla-\ntion, diabetes mellitus, and occlusion of the internal\ncarotid artery terminus.\nWe assessed the effect of treatment on the distribu-\ntion of each of the dimension scores with ordinal logis-\ntic regression. To validate the EQ-5D-3L assessment we\ncorrelated (Spearman) it with the score on the modified\nRankin Score at 90 days, the NIH Stroke Scale at one\nweek, and the Barthel Index at 90 days. All analyses\nwere performed with Stata/SE statistical package, ver-\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\ntrial, we obtained an EQ-5D-3L score.

Compared to the pre-\nviously published results, the beta coefficient is\nunchanged, but now with a smaller 95% confidence\ninterval.

The SWIFT PRIME\nand EXTEND-IA trials did not report the EQ-5D as a\nsecondary outcome.7,8\nTable 1.

Particularly the dimension ``pain/discom-\nfort'' is originally defined as ``pain or other com-\nplaints.'' One could expect this dimension also covers\nneurological deficits that interfere less with mobility or\nself-care dimensions. However, our results indicate\notherwise. This raises the question if the EQ-5D-3L\nreflects quality of life in the full range of limitations\nrelevant to stroke patients. However, we showed that\nthe EQ-5D-3L correlated well with other valid meas-\nures of functional outcome and slightly less with neuro-\nlogical deficits.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the NIH\nStroke Scale was done 1 week after treatment allocation\nand the EQ-5D-3L at 90 days. Second, there was no\nformal blinding for treatment allocation of interviewer\nand of course, patients could also be aware of the treat-\nment they had received. Third, ideally we want to com-\npare EQ-5D-3L scores for each patient before and after\nstroke, but EQ-5D-3L scores before stroke were not\navailable. Last, in this study we only had three-month\nresults. Long-term results will be presented in CLOT\nMR CLEAN (cost-effectiveness analyses and long-term\nfollow-up in MR CLEAN).9\nIn conclusion, we found that treatment had a limited\neffect on quality of life, as measured with the EQ-5D-\n3L. Nevertheless, we can conclude that patients with\nacute ischemic stroke caused by an intracranial occlu-\nsion in the anterior circulation, who had intra-arterial\ntreatment within 6 h after stroke onset, experience a\nbetter health-related quality of life at three months\nafter onset than patients without intra-arterial\ntreatment.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial sup-\nport for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: The MR CLEAN trial was partly funded by the\nDutch Heart Foundation and by unrestricted grants from\nAngioCare BV, Medtronic/Covidien/EV3\u00d5, MEDAC\nGmbh/LAMEPRO, Penumbra Inc., Stryker\u00d5, and Top\nMedical/Concentric.
