They were evaluated at baseline and after 1\nyear. Genomic DNA was extracted from circulating leukocytes.\nResults: Subjects with the II genotype in the non-metabolic syndrome group were only to increase their fat-free\nmass after therapy. Regarding lipid profile, subjects with ID and DD genotypes from both groups reduced their low-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly. The metabolic parameters from the ID and DD genotypes of the non-\nmetabolic syndrome group showed a significantly improved insulin response.\nConclusion: In the present study, we showed that the ACE polymorphism was able to influence the fat-free mass in\nthe I-carry allele in the non-metabolic syndrome group positively. In addition, the I-carry allele was able to improve the\ninsulin resistance of the metabolic syndrome group significantly. These results suggest that the ACE I/D genotypes can\ninfluence, in different ways, the specific parameters of metabolism among obese adolescents submitted for long-term\ninterdisciplinary therapy.\n",

However, in\nthe last few years, genome-wide association studies have\nidentified numerous candidate polymorphisms that are\nunequivocally associated with metabolic-related traits,\nincluding obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidae-\nmia.4 These studies have shown a range of 10\u00ad30% of par-\nticipation in the heritability of MS.5\u00ad8\nAmong the candidate genes related to metabolic path-\nways, the genes for the B2 and B3-adrenergic receptors,\nlipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, peroxisome\nproliferator-activated receptor-, insulin receptor substrate-1\ninvolved in the development of MS.\nSeveral studies have recently concentrated on genetic\nvariants in the renin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS) in associa-\ntion with the components of MS. The RAS plays an essen-\ntial role in the regulation of blood pressure levels and renal\nhomeostasis, and it is involved in clinical alterations in\norgan damage through the variation of gene expression as\nwell as growth, fibrosis and inflammatory response.12\u00ad14\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is recognised\nas one of the main effector enzymes of this system; ACE\n(EC 3.4.15.1) is a zinc metallopeptidase that converts the\ninactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I) to the potent\nvasopressor angiotensin II (Ang II) in the RAS and inacti-\nvates the vasodilator bradykinin in the kallikrein\u00adkinin\nsystem (KKS).15,16 The KKS is involved in glycaemic\nmetabolism mainly via B2 receptor activation, which is\nable to mediate glucose uptake and improve insulin sensi-\ntivity. Thus the ACE enzyme concentration and activity\ncould regulate the energetic homeostasis through modula-\ntion of this system.17\nThe ACE gene is localised on the long arm of chromo-\nknown to contain polymorphisms consisting of an inser-\ntion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of a 287-bp Alu-repeat\nsequence in intron 16 of the ACE gene that was identified\nand for which three different genotypes (II, ID, DD) have\nbeen characterised. These three genotypes display distinct\nACE plasma activities of which the DD genotype is\nresponsible for the high activity of the enzyme.18,19 Studies\nhave demonstrated that ACE I/D polymorphism is associ-\nated with hypertension,20 nephropathy,21 elevated glu-\ncose,22 coronary artery disease,13 plasma triglyceride, total\ncholesterol levels, abdominal fat accumulation, central\nobesity and weight gain.23\nAn ample number of studies has recently focused on the\nACE I/D polymorphism in association with MS; however,\nACE polymorphism on the improvement of components\nof the MS profile in response to a multifaceted obesity-\nmanagement programme, addressed using a multidiscipli-\nnary team, has not been clarified in obese adolescents.\nThus the aim of the present study was to investigate\nwhether I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene might affect\nmetabolic changes related to MS through long-term inter-\ndisciplinary therapy in obese adolescents.\nMethods\nSubjects\naged between 15 and 19 years who entered the interdisci-\nplinary obesity programme of the Federal University of\nS\u00e3o Paulo \u00ad Escola Paulista de Medicina were assigned to\nthe following two subgroups: MS or non-metabolic syn-\ndrome (n-MS). Those who were considered to have MS\npresented with three or more criteria of the International\nDiabetes Federation.28 Both groups were submitted for\nweight loss therapy. The evaluations were performed at\nbaseline and after 1 year of an interdisciplinary approach.\nThe ages of the participants ranged from 15 to 19 years,\nand they all presented with simple obesity (body mass\nindex (BMI) >95th percentile).29 The inclusion criteria for\nthe post-pubertal stage were based on the Tanner scale\nstage 5,30 for both boys and girls. Non-inclusion criteria\nwere as follows: other metabolic or endocrine diseases,\nsuch as hypothyroidism and Cushing syndrome; chronic\nalcohol consumption; previous use of drugs, such as ana-\nbolic androgenic steroids or psychotropics, which may\naffect appetite regulation; and pregnancy. The study was\ncarried out in accordance with the principles of the\nDeclaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical\ncommittee of the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from all subjects and/or\ntheir parents. The clinical trial registration number was\nClinicalTrials.gov.\nSerum analysis\nBlood samples were collected in the outpatient clinic\napproximately 8 hours after an overnight fast. Insulin\nresistance was assessed by the homeostasis model\nassessment\u00adinsulin resistance (HOMA\u00adIR) index, and\nit was calculated using fasting blood glucose (FBG)\nand immunoreactive insulin (I), as follows: (FBG (mg/\ndL)\u00d7I (mU/L))/405. The concentrations of total cho-\nlesterol, glucose (commercial Beckman Coulter glu-\ncose kit, ref: OSR6221), insulin (commercial Architect\nInsulin reagent kit, ref: 8K41-27), triglycerides, high-\ndensity lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein\n(LDL)-cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein\n(VLDL)-cholesterol were determined and analysed by\nan automatic Beckman Coulter (Brea, California,\nUSA) with a enzymatic colorimetric method (CELM,\nBarueri, Brazil). The HOMA\u00adIR data were analysed\nAlmeida et al. 3\naccording to reference values reported by Schwimmer\net al.,31 and the cut-off adopted for adolescents was\nACE genotyping\nGenomic DNA was extracted from circulating leukocytes\nusing a blood DNA extraction kit (ChargeSwitch gDNA\nblood kits, Invitrogen).

Details of all procedures can be found in de\nCarvalho-Ferreira et al.36\nStatistical analysis\nThe SPSS statistical package version 22.0 for Mac (SPSS,\nChicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical evaluation, and\ngraphics were produced using GraphPad version 6.0\n(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The Gaussian\ndistribution of variables (including  values) was verified\nwith a Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test.Variables were expressed\nas the mean\u00b1SEM. Comparisons between measures at\nbaseline, after the weight loss intervention and between\ngroups were made using the univariate general linear model\nfollowed by a Bonferroni post-test. Genotype frequencies\nobserved in our cohort were in Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilib-\nrium. Differences were considered significant at P<0.05.\nStatistical data are provided in the figures.\nResults\nBaseline\nA total of 198 obese adolescents were enrolled in the pro-\ngirls) completed 1 year of the interdisciplinary obesity pro-\ngramme and more than 75% of the treatment sessions of the\nFederal University of S\u00e3o Paulo \u00ad Escola Paulista de\nMedicina. In the present study, the patients were analysed\nas two groups according to MS diagnosis, as follows: MS\nor non-MS; 40% fit the criteria for MS. The genotype and\nallele frequency of the ACE I/D polymorphism are listed in\nTable 1. The genotype frequency distributions of this\npolymorphism in the study did not differ between n-MS\nand MS and were all in accordance with Hardy\u00adWeinberg\nequilibrium.\nWhen analysing the prevalence of the alterations\nbetween groups, it was observed that HDL was the most\nfrequently altered parameter. Figure 1 illustrates the dif-\nferent percentages among the alterations between the\ngenotypes.\nBody composition\nWhen analysing the difference between groups (MS vs.\nn-MS), it was observed that the genotypes ID and DD in\nthe MS group presented a higher body mass (kg) and waist\ncircumference when compared with the same genotypes in\nthe n-MS group.

Considering carriers of the D allele\nfrom the MS group, higher values of systolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and triglycer-\nides were observed. In analysing insulin levels, the HOMA\nindex and LDL levels, the genotype ID presented higher\nvalues in the MS group when compared with the same\ngenotypes in the n-MS group.

The II genotype in the MS group showed\na greater decrease in subcutaneous fat when compared\nwith the same genotype in the n-MS group. We observed a\nreduction in the visceral\u00adsubcutaneous ratio in the ID and\nDD genotypes of n-MS, while this reduction was observed\nonly in the DD genotype in the MS group. These data are\npresented in Supplementary Table 1.\nMetabolic parameters\nBoth groups presented significant improvements in the\ninsulin levels in ID and DD genotypes (n-MS) as well in II\nand ID genotypes (MS). In the MS group, the DD geno-\ntype remained unchanged after therapy. Considering the\ndifference between the two groups (n-MS vs. MS), the ID\ngenotype in the MS group had a greater delta value than\nthe same genotype in the n-MS group (Figure 3).\nRegarding the lipid profile, the ID and DD genotypes\nfrom both groups (n-MS and MS) exhibited significantly\nreduced LDL-cholesterol, while VLDL-cholesterol was\nreduced only in the n-MS group with the DD genotype. On\nthe other hand, all MS genotypes were able to reduce tri-\nglyceride levels significantly. Comparing the same geno-\ntypes between the two groups, we observed that subjects\nwith ID and DD genotypes in the MS group had signifi-\ncantly lower HDL levels when compared with the same\ngenotypes in the n-MS group. In addition, both ID and DD\ngenotypes presented higher VLDL and triglycerides than\nsubjects from the n-MS group. In the analysis of the LDL,\nwe observed significant differences in the ID genotype\ncompared with the same genotype in the n-MS group.\nAlthough the MS group exhibited a significantly improved\nLDL\u00adHDL ratio, this group still presented with higher val-\nues in all three genotypes in relation to n-MS. All meta-\nbolic data are presented in Supplementary Table 2.\nConcerning SBP, the MS group showed a significant\nreduction in ID and DD genotypes, and it was observed\nthat none of the genotypes had a significant reduction in\nthe n-MS group. We observed that the ID genotype in the\nMS group maintained differences with regard to the same\ngenotype in the n-MS group after therapy. Only the DD\ngenotype in the n-MS group and ID from the MS group\npresented significant reductions in DBP after therapy. We\nFigure 1.

This result is the opposite of that of the\nsubjects with the DD genotype, who did not show changes\nin their insulin levels after therapy. In synergy with these\nresults, while the genotypes II and ID improved HOMA\u00ad\nIR, the DD genotype increased significantly (Figure 3).\nConsidering lipid metabolism, in the MS group only car-\nriers of the D allele improved LDL, while HDL and VLDL\ndid not respond to intervention. Regarding HDL-cholesterol\nand LDL\u00adHDL ratios, we observed a significant reduction\nonly in the ID and DD genotypes in the n-MS group.\nMoreover, the carriers of the D allele in the MS group\nshowed increased triglyceride\u00adHDL ratio values. Finally,\nthe MS group showed a significant reduction of SBP in the\nID and DD genotypes (Supplementary Table 2).\nDiscussion\nThe main purpose of the present study was to investigate\nwhether the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene might\naffect metabolic changes related to MS through a long-\nterm interdisciplinary therapy in obese adolescents. The\nmost important finding is that we have shown that genetic\nalteration in the ACE gene may influence the benefits of an\ninterdisciplinary therapy in obese adolescents with and\nwithout MS.\nIt is important to emphasise that, for the first time, we\nhave demonstrated that the II genotype might have a\nfavourable effect on the improvement of body composi-\ntion in obese adolescents without MS when compared with\nthe DD genotype. In agreement with this, the II genotype\npresented better results regarding glucose metabolism\nwhen compared with the ID and DD genotypes in the MS\ngroup. Finally, the II genotype seemed to impair improve-\nment in lipid metabolism when compared with ID and DD\nin both groups.\nAs previously demonstrated by our group,37 improve-\nment in body composition was observed in both groups\nafter an interdisciplinary weight loss therapy. However,\nwhen we stratified the groups by ACE genotype, the result\nwas different; the II genotype showed significant improve-\nment in fat-free mass in the n-MS group when compared\nwith ID and DD within the same group.\nAs mentioned before, the I-carry allele is associated with\nhigher levels of bradykinin, which could partly justify these\nresults. Bradykinin stimulates protein synthesis pathways,\nincluding the Pi3K/AKT/m-TOR pathway. The proposed\nmechanism is based on the role of bradykinin in increasing\nthe IRS receptor phosphorylation, which activates the\nAKT\u00admTOR pathway, favouring protein synthesis.17,38\nCorroborating results obtained by the group of Popadic\nGacesa39 provided evidence of a positive relationship\nbetween another polymorphism that can result in an increase\nin bradykinin signaling and a better response to an exercise\nintervention for which the goal was improving muscle mass\nin young men (Figure 4).\nInterestingly, it has recently been shown that an increase\nin free-fat mass, in response to exercise training, may\nenhance some myokines, including increased secretion of\nFGF-21 in muscle, mediation in white adipose tissue and\nbrown adipose tissue (BAT), the browning phenomenon\nand an increase in thermogenesis in humans. Moreover,\nthere is consensus on the presence of BAT in humans and\nits potential consequences on energy metabolism, glucose\nregulation and blood lipid balance.40\nIn addition, it has been suggested that exercise could\nexert a key role in BAT metabolism. Exercise training\nmight activate and recruit human BAT through activation\nof the sympathetic nervous system, heart and skeletal mus-\ncle. However, more investigations for understanding\nwhich type of exercise, the different effects of intensity,\nand how much time is needed to induce an effective BAT\nactivation and recruitment in humans with obesity and MS\nAll together, these results may suggest the importance\nof increases in free-fat mass after weight loss, as shown in\nthe present study. In order to ameliorate both factors, the\nenergy balance and whole body metabolism avoid undesir-\nable yo-yo effects and the inflammatory state related to\nobesity, which may lead to the development of MS and\ncardiometabolic risks.\nAnother interesting result observed in the present\ninvestigation was that only I-carry alleles presented an\nimprovement in insulin and HOMA\u00adIR in the MS group,\ndemonstrating that the DD genotype presented impairment\nof glucose metabolism. It is well established in the litera-\nture that bradykinin is capable of positively influencing\nglucose uptake.17 Bradykinin acts via a synergistic mecha-\nnism with the pathway of insulin and by translocation of\nGLUT-4 in an independent manner.42 Thus, considering\nthat the literature has strongly demonstrated that DD geno-\ntypes present lower values of bradykinin, this could partly\nexplain the difference between the genotypes after inter-\ndisciplinary therapy. A possible mechanism involved in\nI/D polymorphism and glucose homeostasis is also shown\nin Figure 4.\nInsulin resistance is one of the strongest predictors of\nmany chronic diseases in adolescents, including MS, non-\nalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), diabetes, dyslipi-\ndaemia and others. Therefore, the improvement of insulin\nsensitivity in the presence of MS in obese adolescents may\nAlmeida et al. 7\nbenefit obesity control as well as its above-mentioned\ncomorbidities. In addition, it was previously shown that\nafter weight loss therapy, an increase in adiponectin medi-\nates the improvements in insulin resistance in obese ado-\nlescents, leading to a reduction in the prevalence of MS\nHowever, regarding lipid metabolism, the framework\nseems to be different in the present study. The II genotype\nin the MS group presented a worse lipid profile at baseline\nthat did not improve after treatment. This result indicates\nthat, besides the unfavourable lipid profile at baseline, this\ngenotype also presents difficulty in responding positively\nto the intervention because it is expected that lifestyle\nchanges are able to modulate the lipid profile. D-carrier\nallele genotypes seemed to respond better, demonstrated\nby an increase in HDL-cholesterol and decreases in\nLDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in the MS group, while\nthe II genotype was able to improve triglyceride levels\nonly (Figure 4).\nThese effects can be modulated partially by the conver-\nsion of bradykinin in Des-Arg-9-BK, which is able to bind\nthe B1 kinin receptor. It is well known that these receptors\nare expressed only in pro-inflammatory conditions, which\nare observed in the present population, especially in the\nMS group.45 Experimental studies showed that B1 receptor\nknockout mice, which were submitted to a high-fat diet,\npresented a more favourable lipid profile when compared\nwith wild-type mice.46 Thus, considering that the I-carry\nallele has higher bradykinin levels, more substrate may be\navailable for the conversion of bradykinin in Des-Arg-\n9-BK. However, clinical studies to confirm this are recom-\nmended in the analysed population.\nFigure 4.

In eutrophic American\nchildren (NHANES III), this prevalence was only approxi-\nmately 0.1%. In addition, we were able to show that\n50% of obese adolescents have a diagnosis of NAFLD.\nUnfortunately, after weight loss therapy, some of them\ncontinue with MS and NAFLD, showing the importance\nof controlling lipid profiles in this population in order to\nCurrently, identifying obesity-resistant genotypes and how\nthey respond to different therapies is becoming extremely\ninteresting, as obesity has reached epidemic proportions glob-\nally. In the present study, genetic variation in the ACE gene\ninfluences the response to interdisciplinary treatment in dif-\nferent ways, acting positively in glucose metabolism and pro-\ntein synthesis and negatively on lipid profiles. Once the role\nof different polymorphisms is established, a more efficient\nand personalised treatment can be designed.\nNevertheless, to our knowledge, the current study is the\nfirst investigation showing the influence of these specific\npolymorphisms in response to a long-term interdiscipli-\nnary therapy in obese adolescents, and is an important\nissue for clinical practice. The limitations of the present\nstudy include the sample size and the lack of the quantifi-\ncation of kinin peptides. These issues may be explored in\nfuture studies.\nConclusion\nThe multicomponent intervention was able to improve\nbody composition and metabolism among obese adoles-\ncents. In the present study, we showed that the ACE poly-\nmorphism was able to influence positively fat-free mass in\nI-carry allele genotypes in the n-MS group. In addition, the\nI-carry allele was able to improve significantly insulin\nresistance in the MS group. Conversely, I-carry allele gen-\notypes seemed to hamper lipid profile improvement in the\nMS group. The results suggest that the genotypes can\ninfluence, in different ways and in specific parameters, the\nmetabolism of Brazilian obese adolescents.\n"
