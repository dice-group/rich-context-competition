CBA/lac male mice were irradiated at a dose rate of\n28.2 Gy/h (high dose rate) or 0.07 mGy/h (very low dose rate). The comet assay study on spleen\nlymphocytes showed that very low dose-rate irradiation resulted in a statistically significant increase\nin nucleoid relaxation (DNA breaks), starting from a dose of 20 cGy. Further prolongation of expo-\nsure time and, hence, increase of a total dose did not, however, lead to further increase in the extent\nof nucleoid relaxation. Doses of 20 and 61 cGy were equal in inducing DNA breaks in mouse spleen\nlymphocytes as assayed by the comet assay. Of note, the level of DNA damage by 20\u00ad61 cGy doses of\nchronic irradiation (0.07 mGy/h) was similar to that an induced by an acute (28.2 Gy/h) dose of\n14 cGy. The bone marrow micronucleus test revealed that an increase in polychromatic erythrocytes\nwith micronuclei over a background level was induced by very low-level  -irradiation with a dose\nof 61 cGy only, with the extent of the cytogenetic effect being similar to that of 10 cGy high-dose-rate\nexposure. In summary, presented results support the hypothesis of the nonlinear threshold nature of\nmutagenic action of chronic low dose-rate irradiation.\nKeywords. ionizing radiation, low doses, very low dose-rate irradiation, single-strand DNA breaks,\ncomet assay, cytogenetic effects\nINTRODUCTION\nAll living organisms, including humans, are continuously exposed to ion-\nizing radiation (IR) from natural sources. However, development of nuclear\ntechnologies and associated intentional (e.g., Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and\naccidental (e.g., Chernobyl) releases of radioisotopes have led to an increase\nAddress correspondence to Andreyan N. Osipov, Moscow Scientific and Industrial Association\nin a background level of IR. This technogenic part of IR exposure has risen\nsignificantly over the past few decades.\nAlthough there are no doubts about the negative biological effects of\nhigh-dose IR, debates about whether low-dose IR exposure is harmful or\nbeneficial (hormetic) still continue in the scientific community. Analysis\nof available literature indicates that low-dose IR exposure induces a com-\nplex of biochemical and biophysical reactions in animals (Calabrese and\nwhether those changes are consequences of organism adaptation to increase\nin IR background, and whether low doses cause any significant genetic\nalterations.\nThe aim of the present study was to compare genotoxicity induced by\nhigh- versus very low dose-rate exposure of mice to  -radiation within a dose\nrange of 5 to 61 cGy using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay\nand the micronucleus test.\nIn chronic IR exposure experiments, 4\u00ad5-week-old CBA/lac male mice\nweighting 12\u00ad14 g (purchased from Pitomnik-Stolbovaya) were used. Mice\nwere placed in plastic cages 14 days prior to IR exposure. Distribution of\nanimals into control and experimental groups was random. Mice were given\nstandard dry feed and water ad libitum. Experiments with chronic low dose-\nperiments with identical conditions were performed, utilizing a total of 280\nmice (140 animals in each of the two experiments).\nExperimental animals were chronically exposed to IR from a  -ray unit\n\"UOG-1\" (VNIIFTRI, Russia) equipped with a 137Cs source (activity 7.2 \u00d7\n108 Bq) mounted in a steel container and specifically designed for long-\nterm irradiation of biological objects. The IR source was placed above ex-\nposed targets. Chronic irradiation of animals was performed at a dose rate\nof 0.07 mGy/h (distance from mouse bedding to the  -radiation source was\n64 cm, filter-lens #5). Variability of a dose rate within the area to be irradiated\ndaily break for hygiene procedures. Control dosimetry was performed using\nthermoluminescent detectors TLD-100 (Sweden) and DTG-4 (Russia). To\nIn an experiment with acute (high-dose-rate)  -irradiation, 3\u00ad4-month-\nold CBA/lac male mice weighing 22\u00ad26 g were used. The total number of\nmice used for acute irradiation experiments was 120. Irradiation was per-\nformed using the Panorama-3C device equipped with four mobile 137Cs\nGenotoxic Action of High- Versus Very-Low-Dose-Rate  -Irradiation 225\nUpon completion of chronic low dose-rate or acute irradiation, mice were\nsacrificed and spleen and red bone marrow were removed and processed\nfor subsequent analysis. Suspension of spleen cells in phosphate-buffered\nfiltered through nylon mesh at 4C. Cell concentrations were counted using\na hemocytometer.\nAlkali single-cell gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Singh\net al. (1988). According to the assay, the number of alkali labile sites and single-\nstrand breaks (SSBs) is proportional to the number of DNA fragments and to\nthe distance that DNA migrated from the nucleus after alkali electrophoresis\nof agarose-immobilized single cells. Fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258 (Sigma\nChemical Co, St. Louis, MO) was used to visualize DNA. Analysis was per-\nformed using the \"Lumam I-2\" fluorescent microscope (LOMO, Russia).\nOne hundred comets were counted from each slide. Comets were divided\ninto classes 0\u00ad4 (0 corresponded to no visible tail, 4 corresponded to total\nmigration of DNA from the nucleus into the tail) depending on the shape\n(diameter, tail length, etc.). This method of visual damage is considered a\nvalid means of DNA damage analysis (Kobayashi et al., 1995). Results of the\nvisual classification were subsequently confirmed using the analytic package\nimage analysis software (Kinetic Imaging, Liverpool, UK).\nA number of comets in each class was recorded and the average comet\nindex (ACI) was calculated as ACI = (1 \u00b7 n1\n- n4 is a number of comets in classes 1\u00ad4, and is the sum of counted\ncomets, including comets in class 0.\nThe percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the DNA diffusion\nassay described elsewhere (Singh, 2000).\nFor cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells by the micronucleus test,\ncytological slides were prepared using standard procedure (Schmidt, 1975).\nPolychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) with micronuclei (MN) were recognized\nand counted as described by Zaichkina et al. (1998). Three thousand PCEs\nwere analyzed from each mouse.\nStatistical analysis of experimental results was performed using the stu-\ndent t-test. Results are presented as averages for a dose group of animals (20\nmice per dose group for chronic irradiation, and 10 mice per dose group for\nacute irradiation) \u00b1 standard errors.\nFigure 1 shows the results of the ACI determination in spleen lympho-\ncytes from mice exposed to acute and chronic (very low dose-rate) IR. Data\nare presented as differences of the ACI in irradiated and untreated con-\ntrol groups. A dose-response curve after acute IR exposure is perfectly fit-\nted by a linear regression ACI = a + 0.049  D, where a is the ACI value in\nthe control group, and D is a dose in cGy. Depending on cell type, and\nFIGURE 1 Dose-response curves of the ACI of comet DNA of spleen lymphocytes of mice exposed to\nacute (28.2 Gy/h) or chronic very low dose-rate (0.07 mGy/h) IR. Data are presented after subtraction\nof control (untreated) values from experimental (irradiated) values.\nproliferative and metabolic activity rate, the ACI in control animals varied\nUsing the BALB/c mouse strain, we have previously shown that the dose-\nresponse curve of initially induced DNA SSBs in mouse spleen lymphocytes\nafter acute IR exposure is linear in the range 5\u00ad50 cGy with the similar\nIn contrast to acute IR exposure, chronic low dose-rate irradiation re-\nsulted in a nonlinear dose-response curve (Figure 1). In the range of about\nof a dose did not, however, lead to further increase in the ACI. Its value\ndid not significantly change within a dose range of 20 to 61 cGy. These re-\nsults suggest that the dose-response curve of DNA SSBs formation in mouse\nspleen lymphocytes after in vivo chronic  -irradiation (0.07 mGy/h) contains\na \"plateau\" section that is not observed in cases with acute  -irradiation.\nBecause long periods of irradiation time can significantly change the\nACI value in a control group, interfering with accurate evaluation of the pa-\nrameter in an exposure group, the ACI values were recorded throughout all\nexperimental time (Table 1). The ACI value decreased with age of animals,\nTABLE 1 Changes in the ACI Values of Spleen Lymphocytes of Control Untreated Mice During\nChronic Irradiation Experiments\nLength of\nexperiment\n(arbitrary\nunits)\nGenotoxic Action of High- Versus Very-Low-Dose-Rate  -Irradiation 227\nprobably due to decrease in proliferation rate of spleen lymphocytes. Nev-\nertheless, starting from 40 and up to 270 days of the experiment (the main\nexperimental points), ACI values did not significantly change, confirming\nthat our way of presenting the results is accurate.\nIt is well known that some background level of DNA breakage is always\npresent in mammalian cells due to normal metabolism. These breaks can be\ndivided into two classes:\n1. breaks resulting from DNA damage by free radicals produced by cellular\noxygen metabolism; and\n2. breaks resulting from DNA replication, repair, transcription processes, as\nwell as chromatin condensation and decondensation.\nAn IR dose of 1 Gy induces approximately 1000 DNA SSBs per cell (Billen,\n1990). Simple calculations based on these data show that irradiation with a\ndose rate of 0.07 mGy/h (0.17 cGy/day) will induce about two DNA SSBs\nper cell per day, whereas a number of endogenous SSBs resulting from normal\nfore, obvious that low dose-rate IR-induced DNA SSBs can hardly influence a\ntotal number of DNA breaks. The nature of spontaneous and induced DNA\nbreaks is rather similar. IR-induced primary lesions could lead to genotoxic\neffects only if the spatial distribution of the lesions along the chromatin and\neffectiveness of their repair is different from those spontaneously induced.\nStudies of the past decade suggest that particular areas within chromatin pos-\nsessing hypersensitivity to IR do exist (Oleinick et al., 1994). Double-stranded\nDNA clusters composed of multiple lesions on opposing DNA strands within\na few helical turns are of particular danger to cells, because it is hard for\nDNA repair machinery to repair them (Goodhead, 1994). These clusters are\nthought to be crucial IR-induced DNA lesions leading to double-stand breaks\n(DSBs), and eventually to mutagenesis and cell death (Ahnstrom and Bryant,\nan increase in clustered DNA damage level in human monocytes. Consistent\nwith our results, nondividing primary human fibroblasts exposed to 1 mGy of\nIR were not able to repair DNA DSBs for several days, whereas effectiveness\nof DSB repair after higher doses was much better (Rothkamm and Lobrich,\nA minor part of cells that have an extremely high level of DNA damage\n(e.g., apoptotic cells) would supposedly contribute substantially to an overall\nDNA damage level within an entire cellular population. To take into account\nthe contribution of an apoptotic cell subpopulation to a final readout of DNA\nbreaks in our experiments, we measured the percentage of apoptotic spleen\nlymphocytes from mice exposed to very low dose-rate IR or untreated animals\ndiation (20, 45, and 61 cGy, respectively), an approximately twofold increase\nTABLE 2 Percent of Apoptotic Spleen Lymphocytes in Control Mice and Mice Exposed to Chronic\nVery Low Dose-Rate (0.07 mGy/h) IR\nLength of\nApoptotic cells (%)\nSignificantly increased compared to control (p < 0.05).\nover a control level in the apoptotic cell fraction was observed (Table 2). As\nexpected, a correlation (r = 0.86; p < 0.05) between an overall level of DNA\ndamage and percentage of apoptotic cells was noticed. These observations\nprompted us to recalculate overall DNA damage levels (the ACI coefficient)\nin irradiated versus untreated groups. When performed without counting\nhighly damaged cells (comets within classes 3 and 4), the comet assay yielded\nless, but still statistically significant, difference in DNA damage levels between\nirradiated (20\u00ad61 cGy) and untreated mice (data not shown). The appear-\nance of apoptotic cells with highly fragmented DNA in irradiated animals\ncannot, therefore, have a direct impact on overall level of DNA strand breaks.\nAn indirect mechanism, also known as a \"bystander effect,\" a response of unir-\nradiated cells due to signaling originating from irradiated cells (Hall, 2003),\ncan possibly be involved in the effects observed in this study. In this scenario,\nlesions within supersensitive chromatin regions in a minor, apoptotic cell\npopulation appear to trigger a cascade of metabolic processes in different\ncell populations on both organ and organism levels. Bystander effects have\nbeen demonstrated after both low-linear energy transfer (LET) and high-\nlinear energy transfer (LET) IR exposures (Mothersill et al., 2002). A signal\nfrom irradiated cells can be transmitted by direct intercellular contacts (gap\njunction communications), as well as by cytokines and/or oxygen species\nsecreted by irradiated cells (Lorimore and Wright, 2003). In our previous\nstudy, using mammalian cultured cells, we showed that low IR doses induced\nproduction and secretion of the ApoJ lipoprotein involved in the bystander ef-\nfect by regulating expression of genes downstream of the TFG-beta signaling\npathway (Klokov et al., n.d.). A variety of changes has been reported to oc-\ncur in bystander cells, including overproduction of free radicals (Narayanan\nJNK, ERK1/2, and others (Little et al., 2002); and cytokines Beta1-integrin\nTABLE 3 Changes in the Frequency of Bone Marrow PCE with MN of Control Untreated Mice During\nChronic Irradiation Experiments\nLength of\nGenotoxic Action of High- Versus Very-Low-Dose-Rate  -Irradiation 229\nand IL-1alpha (Osterreicher et al., 2003). In addition, reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) can act as signal molecules to propagate and regulate a particular cel-\nlular response such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Lehnert\nand Iyer, 2002). It is well known that actively transcribed DNA sequences are\nmuch more susceptible to DNA damage than those in compact chromatin\nregions due to unlimited accessibility of them for ROS (Chiu et al., 1982;\nWarters et al., 1987). An increase in actively transcribed genes, together with\nan increase in ROS production can, therefore, lead to elevated DNA damage.\nOn the other hand, DNA damage within active genes is repaired faster and\nmore efficiently compared to that in silent genes (Oleinick et al., 1984; Bohr,\nOur speculation is supported by results of monitoring reparative and\nreplicative DNA syntheses in mouse bone marrow cells reported by Mazurik\net al. (2002), within a collaborative effort with our group, performed on\nthe same mice used in our present study. The authors demonstrated that\nchronic low dose-rate irradiation of mice substantially induced reparative\nand replicative DNA syntheses in bone marrow cells (60 and 67% increase;\np < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). As mentioned earlier, activation of DNA\nreplication and repair is associated with increase in the DNA strand-breaks\nlevel. Besides, significant positive correlation (r = 0.87; p < 0.01) between\nDNA strand breaks and superoxide anion-radical content in bone marrow\ncells of the irradiated mice was shown, indicating additional production of\nDNA damage by ROS due to the loss of a part of structural proteins and\nconformational changes in expression sites of the chromatin during gene\nIt was suggested that the bystander effect has an alternative protective\nfeature due to elimination of highly damaged, potentially dangerous cells\ndance with this line of evidence, an adaptive response, an effect of increased\nradioresistance to high IR doses acquired after exposure to low doses, was\nassociated with overproduction of ROS (Lehnert and Iyer, 2002). In our pre-\nvious study, we demonstrated that an increase in DNA breaks level by days\n120\u00ad365 of low-level IR exposure is accompanied by elevated radioresistance\nto hydrogen peroxide treatment (Osipov et al., 2002). It was suggested that\nthe elevated cell radioresistance could be explained by either activation of\nDNA repair or elimination of a supersensitive cell population (Osipov et al.,\nThus, overall increase in the level of DNA breaks in mouse spleen lym-\nphocytes as a result of chronic low dose-rate IR exposure can possibly be\nexplained by structural rearrangement of the chromatin during gene ex-\npression activation, free radical overproduction, and DNA repair activation.\nAlthough insignificant, a contribution of apoptotic cells to an overall level of\nDNA damage was also recorded, providing further support for the proposed\nmechanisms of low dose-rate radiation-induced cytogenetic effects observed\nin this study.\nThe mutagenic effect in PCEs was determined using the micronucleus\ntest. MN are acentric chromosomal fragments or whole chromosomes lost\nduring mitosis as a result of DNA damage. As expected, an increase in the\nportion of PCEs with MN in aging mice was observed, which correlates with a\nwell-established age-related accumulation of mutations in bone marrow cells\n(Table 3).\nDose-response curves for frequency of PCEs with MN in mouse bone\nmarrow upon IR with two different dose rates are presented in Figure 2. The\ndose-response curve upon acute IR exposure is described by a linear function\nand is consistent with results obtained by other investigators using different\nSudheer Kumar et al., 2003). The genetic background of the mice seems\nto be an important factor for cytogenetic studies and interpretations. Our\nprevious data generated in experiments with SHK mice indicated that the\ndose-response curve for cytogenetic damage in bone marrow cells was de-\nscribed by a step function and consisted of two linear regions and a \"plateau\"\nchronic low dose-rate exposure did not result in an increase in cytogenetic\ndamage up to 61 cGy, with the damage induced by 61 cGy being comparable\nwith that induced by acute IR doses of 10 cGy. Using this assay, therefore,\nmutagenic activity of chronic IR exposure with a dose rate of 0.07 mGy/h\nwas at least six-fold lower than that of acute IR exposure with a dose rate of\n28.2 Gy/h. In addition, our results indicate a threshold in the dose\u00adeffect\nrelationship after chronic IR exposure with a dose rate of 0.07 mGy/h. The\nthreshold was observed to extend up to 35\u00ad61 cGy.\nFIGURE 2 Dose-response curves for MN induction in bone marrow PCE from mice exposed to acute\n(28.2 Gy/h) or chronic very low dose-rate (0.07 mGy/h) IR. Data are presented after subtraction of\ncontrol (untreated) values from experimental (irradiated) values.\nGenotoxic Action of High- Versus Very-Low-Dose-Rate  -Irradiation 231\nTo summarize, chronic IR exposure of three orders over a normal back-\nground level leads to a statistically significant increase in the number of DNA\nstrand breaks within a 20\u00ad61-cGy dose range. More probably, this increase\ncan be associated with the chromatin rearrangement accompanied by gene\noverexpression, increase in ROS production rate, and DNA repair activation,\nprocesses known to be triggered after low doses of IR. Six times higher dose\nof chronic 0.07 mGy/h IR exposure was required to induce cytogenetic dam-\nage in bone marrow cells comparable to that after acute 28.2 Gy/h exposure.\nBased on these results, we can suggest that mutagenic activity of chronic irra-\ndiation of three orders over the normal background level is at least six times\nlower than that of acute irradiation. Data on MN induction support the hy-\npothesis of the nonlinear threshold nature of mutagenic action of chronic\nlow dose-rate irradiation.\nREFERENCES\nAhnstrom G, Bryant PE.
