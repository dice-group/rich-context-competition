The authors evaluated participants from the 2003\u00ad\n2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged !6 years who wore an activity monitor for up to\n7 days. Among 6,329 participants with at least one 10-hour day of monitor wear, the average monitor-wearing time\nwas 13.9 hours/day (standard deviation, 1.9). Overall, participants spent 54.9% of their monitored time, or 7.7\nhours/day, in sedentary behaviors. The most sedentary groups in the United States were older adolescents and\nadults aged !60 years, and they spent about 60% of their waking time in sedentary pursuits. Females were more\nsedentary than males before age 30 years, but this pattern was reversed after age 60 years. Mexican-American\nadults were significantly less sedentary than other US adults, and White and Black females were similarly sed-\nentary after age 12 years. These data provide the first objective measure of the amount of time spent in sedentary\nbehavior in the US population and indicate that Americans spend the majority of their time in behaviors that expend\nvery little energy.\nenergy metabolism; monitoring, ambulatory; motor activity; obesity; population surveillance\nAbbreviations: IDEEA, Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Activity; MET, metabolic equivalent; NHANES, National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey; SD, standard deviation.\nThe amount of time spent in sedentary behaviors has been\nindependently associated with lower levels of physical-\nactivity energy expenditure (1, 2), increased risk of weight\ngain (2, 3), and increased risk of metabolic syndrome, di-\nabetes, and heart disease (3\u00ad5). In light of these links to\nadverse health outcomes and the continued increase in the\nprevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States\n(6), sedentary behaviors have emerged as an important tar-\nget of health promotion and obesity and disease prevention\nefforts (7\u00ad9), complementing efforts to increase levels of\nmoderate-to-vigorous physical activity (10\u00ad12). Sedentary\nbehaviors have been defined as a range of human endeavors\nthat result in an energy expenditure of no more than 1.5\ntimes' resting energy expenditure (8). These behaviors are\ntypically associated with time spent sitting, reclining, or\nlying down during waking hours (7, 8).\nCorrespondence to Dr. Charles E.

However,\nassessment of these behaviors provides only a partial picture\nof overall levels of sedentary behavior in a typical waking\nday. For example, the American Time Use Survey, a popula-\ntion-based survey of adolescents and adults aged !15 years,\nindicated that respondents reported an average of 2.6 hours/\nday of television viewing and less than 0.5 hours/day of com-\nputer use at home (13), which represents only a modest pro-\nportion of the average 15.4-hour waking day in this sample.\nSimilarly, 80 percent of adults in the United States reported\nonly three or fewer hours of television viewing or non-work-\nrelated computer use per day (4). The average amount of time\nspent in overall sedentary behaviors during waking hours in\nthe United States is unknown and may be substantially under-\nestimated by surveillance systems that have been used to\nassess only a limited number of discretionary behaviors.\nIncorporation of an objective measurement of physical\nactivity in the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) enabled the direct measurement of\ntime spent in sedentary behaviors in a representative sample\nof youth and adults in the United States. Accordingly, the\npurpose of this investigation was to describe, for the first time,\nthe amount of time spent in overall sedentary behaviors in the\nUnited States, by gender, age, and racial/ethnic group.\nStudy population and design\nthe US civilian, noninstitutionalized population, selected\nwith a complex multistage probability design. Participants\naged !6 years who were seen in NHANES mobile exami-\nnation centers were asked to wear an Actigraph accelerom-\neter (model 7164; Actigraph, LLC, Fort Walton Beach,\nFlorida) for 7 consecutive days.\nrecords integrated acceleration information as an activity\ncount, which provides an objective estimate of the intensity\nof bodily movement. The device was programmed to record\nin 1-minute epochs. Participants were instructed to wear the\nmonitor on their right hip attached by an elastic belt during\nall waking hours; however, because the monitors were not\nwaterproof, participants were asked to take them off while\nbathing or swimming. After the monitors had been worn,\nthey were returned by mail to the NHANES contractor,\nwhere data were downloaded and the instruments were\nchecked for calibration. Units that did not meet the manu-\nfacturer's specifications for calibration (\u00c65 percent) were\nrecalibrated or repaired prior to reuse.\nThe high sensitivity of the Actigraph results in wide\nvariability of activity count values over a range of human\nambulatory movements (e.g., walking at 2\u00ad3 miles/hour\ncounts/minute) (14). Activity counts recorded while sitting\nand working at a desk are very low ( 50 counts/minute),\nand counts recorded while driving an automobile are\ntypically below 100 counts/minute (unpublished observa-\ntions). The sensitivity and well-described measurement\nproperties of this device facilitated the development of\nan automated approach to objective estimation of monitor\nwear by scanning of the minute-by-minute data. Nonwear\ntime was defined as intervals of at least 60 consecutive\nminutes of zero counts, with allowance for up to 2 consec-\nutive minutes of observations of 1\u00ad100 counts/minute.\nPeriods of nonwear were defined as ending when count\nlevels exceeded 100 counts/minute or when 3 consecutive\nminutes of observation were between 1 and 100 counts/\nminute. Monitor-wearing time was estimated by subtracting\nnonwearing time from the total observation time for the day.\nWe estimated time spent in sedentary behaviors as the\namount of time accumulated below 100 counts/minute during\nperiods when the monitor was worn, expressed as a proportion\nof monitor-wearing time (percent) and as total duration\n(hours/day). This threshold was identified in a calibration\nstudy carried out among adolescent girls (15) and was used\nto identify an independent association between sedentary be-\nhavior and 2-hour postload glucose measures in adults (16).\nIn a small validation study in adults (n \u00bc 19; 53 percent\nfemale; mean age \u00bc 40.1 years (standard deviation (SD),\n(SD, 4.4)), we tested the 100-counts/minute Actigraph\nthreshold against data from the Intelligent Device for\nEnergy Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA) monitor, which\nis a near-gold-standard measure of amounts of time spent\nsitting, reclining, and lying down. Compared with direct\nobservation, the IDEEA monitor has been shown to\ncorrectly identify these body positions with greater than\n98 percent accuracy (17). In 2 days of observation in the\nvalidation study, average wear time for both devices was\nimately 65 percent of their time in sedentary behaviors.\nThe Actigraph (<100 counts/minute) and the IDEEA re-\ncorded similar amounts of time spent in sedentary behav-\nunpublished observations). These findings suggest that\nthe 100 counts/minute Actigraph threshold provides a useful\nmeasure of time spent in sedentary behaviors among adults.\nThere were 7,176 persons who participated in the Acti-\ngraph component of NHANES. Initial evaluation and clean-\ning of these data resulted in exclusion of the records of\nparticipants whose monitors were not in calibration upon\nreturn (n \u00bc 346). In addition, implausible minute-by-minute\nvalues that were consistent with monitor malfunction (e.g.,\n32,767 counts/minute) were replaced by imputed values that\nwere the averages of the counts recorded in the minute\nimmediately before and the minute immediately after the\nimplausible value(s). After exclusion of participants with no\nrecorded monitor-wearing time, 6,830 persons remained.\nWe then excluded records with fewer than 10 hours/day of\nmonitor wear, leaving 6,329 persons with at least one day of\nobservation available for analyses.\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were conducted with SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute,\nInc., Cary, North Carolina) and SUDAAN 9.0 (Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina)\nto account for the multistage probability design used in\nNHANES. Descriptive analyses were initially conducted\nto identify possible outliers and to describe the distributions\nof our primary data. These analyses revealed significant\ndifferences (p < 0.01) in monitor-wearing time by age,\ngender, and racial/ethnic group. Since wear time was posi-\ntively associated with sedentary time, we controlled for\nwear time in our analysis to enhance our ability to describe\ndifferences between groups. Men, middle-aged adults, and\nAfrican Americans tended to wear the monitor for longer\nperiods of time. Thus, we used analysis of variance to esti-\nmate amounts of time spent in sedentary behaviors (hours/\nday) after adjustment for average monitor-wearing time.\nStandard errors derived from SUDAAN were calculated\nvia Taylor series linearization. Tests for linear trend were\nconducted by constructing a continuous variable that con-\ntained the median value in each category of the variable and\nfitting the resulting variable in the regression model as a\ncontinuous variable. Pairwise statistical comparisons of\nthe conditional marginal means were employed to test the\nhypothesis that groups were not different from one another (18).\nRESULTS\nday of monitor wear, the average number of days of obser-\nvation was 5.0 (SD, 1.9). The average monitor-wearing time\npants provided 3 or more days of observation. Table 1\npresents the frequency distribution of the population sample\nby gender, age, and racial/ethnic group. Overall, children\nand adults in the United States spent 54.9 percent of their\nwaking time, or 7.7 hours/day, in sedentary behaviors (figure 1\nand table 2).\nDifferences by age and gender\nAcross the age range of the study population, there were\ntwo striking peaks in the amount of time spent in sedentary\nbehavior. Children aged 6\u00ad11 years were the least sedentary\ngroup in the United States (males: 41.4 percent, 6.0 hours/\nyears, time spent in sedentary pursuits had increased by\nfemales: 59.0 percent, 8.1 hours/day). Young adults (ages\n20\u00ad29 years) were less sedentary than older adolescents, but\nsedentary time increased by about 2 hours/day between the\nyears (table 2). Adults aged 70\u00ad85 years were the most\nsedentary group in the population (men: 67.8 percent, 9.5\nhours/day; women: 66.3 percent, 9.1 hours/day). Tests for\nlinear trend by age were significant (p < 0.001) overall\n(table 2) and when evaluated separately in youth and adult-\nhood (data not shown).\nThere was also an interaction between age and gender\n(figure 1 and table 2). Females were more sedentary than\nmales throughout youth and early adulthood, but this pattern\nwas reversed after age 60 years, when the level of sedentary\nbehavior in men surpassed that of women (p for interac-\ntion < 0.01). However, the interaction between age and\ngender in adulthood was significant in Whites (p < 0.01)\nbut not in Blacks or Mexican Americans.\nDifferences by race/ethnicity\nIn youths (ages 6\u00ad19 years), there were few significant\ndifferences by race/ethnicity, except that Black girls aged\n6\u00ad11 years were less sedentary than either Whites or Mexican\nAmericans (table 3). In addition, when males and females\nwere examined together, Mexican-American adolescents\nwere less sedentary than Whites. In adulthood (ages 20\u00ad\n85 years), Mexican Americans were less sedentary than\nWhites and Blacks, both before and after age 60 years.\nDifferences between White and Black adults were few, ex-\ncept that White men aged 40\u00ad59 years were more sedentary\nthan Black men of the same age. White and Black females\nTABLE 1.

Mexican-American\nmen aged 20\u00ad39 years were the least sedentary group of\nadults (about 6 hours/day). In general, there were consistent\npositive associations between age and time spent in seden-\ntary behaviors in all racial/ethnic groups.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first quantification of the\namount of time spent in overall sedentary behaviors in\na large representative population sample in the United\nStates. Time spent in these behaviors reflects the accumu-\nlated amount of time spent sitting, reclining, or lying down\nat home, at work, at school, in transit, and during leisure\ntime. These US children and adults spent approximately\n55 percent of their waking hours, or 7.7 hours/day, in be-\nhaviors that result in only very low levels of energy expen-\nditure. Older adolescents (ages 16\u00ad19 years) and older\ntime, or more than 8 hours/day, in sedentary behaviors. In\ncontrast, children aged 6\u00ad11 years spent only 6 hours/day in\nthese behaviors. Mexican-American adults were the least\nsedentary group of adults, while Black and White adults\ntended to be similarly sedentary. Given the amount of time\nspent in these behaviors on a daily basis, particularly for\nolder adolescents and adults, reducing the amount of time\nspent being sedentary represents an important opportunity for\nincreasing the level of physical activity in the population.\nOur study differs significantly from other population-\nbased estimates of sedentary behaviors, in terms of both\nmethodology and critical findings, and thus provides unique\ninsight into the current level of sedentary behavior in the\nUnited States. In contrast to previous estimates of sedentary\nbehavior derived from self-reports of a limited number of\nbehaviors (i.e., television viewing and computer use), we\ndirectly quantified the total amount of time spent at very\nlow activity levels over an average of 13.9 hours/day. Given\nour method of estimating time spent in sedentary behavior,\nit is not surprising that our results showed that children and\nadults are twice as sedentary as indicated by previous esti-\nmates derived only from assessment of media-related dis-\ncretionary behaviors (13, 19). These results highlight the\nidea that media use accounts for only about half of the over-\nall time spent in sedentary behavior in the US population.\nThe second important finding from our study is that pre-\nviously quantified differences in television viewing and\ncomputer use that have been described by age, gender,\nand ethnicity may not translate to differences in levels of\noverall sedentary behavior. For example, prevalence esti-\nmates of sedentary behavior, defined as spending 3 or more\nhours per day watching television or using a computer, from\nthe Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System in 2005 in-\ndicated that males were more sedentary than females,\nBlacks were more sedentary than Hispanics or Whites,\nand time spent in these behaviors decreased between grades\n9 and 11 (20). Our study revealed a markedly different\npicture among youth. We found that girls were more seden-\ntary than boys, Blacks were similar to both Whites and\nMexican Americans, and the level of overall sedentary be-\nhavior increased substantially during adolescence. Perhaps\nthe most striking variation in our results from previous stud-\nies was seen among Black and White children. Previous\nreports have found that approximately 40 percent of Black\nchildren reported watching 4 or more hours of television per\nday, while only about 20 percent of White children reported\nthis much television viewing (21, 22). We found no evidence\nthat this difference in television viewing translated into dif-\nferences in objectively determined levels of overall seden-\ntary behavior between White and Black children.\nTABLE 2.

Percentage of time spent in sedentary behaviors, by age\nClose evaluation of time spent in sedentary behaviors\nacross the wide age range in these data revealed two dra-\nmatic peaks that merit comment. Over the approximate de-\nabout a 2-hour/day increase in sedentary behavior, and this\nwas approximately the same magnitude of increase as that\nobserved across the four decades from young adulthood\nstudies have also reported that the rate of decline in physical\nactivity levels is greater in adolescence than in adulthood\n(23). Studies using objective measures of sedentary behav-\nior to describe age effects in youth have reported results that\nare similar to ours (24, 25). For example, Treuth et al. (24)\ndescribed nearly a 2-hour/day increase in time spent in sed-\nentary behaviors when comparing elementary, middle, and\nhigh school students (proportion of monitored time in sed-\ncent, respectively), and this increase was predominantly due\nto a reduction in time spent in light-intensity activities (i.e.,\ncently reported that sixth-grade girls (ages 11\u00ad12 years)\nspent 55.6 percent of their time, or 7.7 hours/day, in seden-\ntary behaviors, which is virtually identical to results from\nthe present study. Fewer studies have estimated the amount\nof time adults spend in sedentary behaviors, but results from\nthe American Time Use Survey indicate that a large pro-\nportion of the average 15.4-hour waking day is spent in\nactivities that expend very little energy (13). In concordance\nwith our study, Healy et al. (16) employed the Actigraph and\nreported that Australian adults (average age 53.3 years)\nspent 57 percent of their monitored time in activities below\n100 counts/minute. The reduction in time spent being sed-\nentary between adolescence (ages 16\u00ad19 years) and early\nadulthood (ages 20\u00ad39 years) may reflect entrance into the\nworkforce and domestic responsibilities related to raising\nfamilies (13). The increase in time spent in sedentary be-\nhaviors after age 60 years, particularly among men, may\nreflect an increase in leisure time following retirement\nand/or the development of comorbid health conditions that\nmay increasingly limit activity in later life. Troiano et al.\n(27) reported a reduction in overall activity levels with in-\ncreasing age among men in this NHANES sample, which\nsuggests that the increase in time spent in sedentary behav-\nior we observed may not be offset by increases in leisure-\ntime physical activity as reported by previous investigators\nTime spent in pursuits that require only low levels of\nenergy expenditure have been linked to increased risk of\nthe importance of lower-intensity (e.g., light-to-moderate)\nactivity on physical activity energy expenditure levels, and\nLevine et al. (2) suggested that an additional 2 hours/day\nspent sitting conserved approximately 350 kcal/day in\na small sample of obese adults, relative to lean adults. In\nthe context of the current study, where we observed two age-\nrelated increases in sedentary behaviors of approximately 2\nhours/day in adolescence and adulthood, we estimate that\napproximately 2 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/day (or\n2 kcal/kg/day) of energy would be conserved by shifting 2\nhours/day from light-intensity behaviors (2.5 METs) to sed-\nentary behaviors (1.5 METs). For a person with a resting\nenergy expenditure of 67 kcal/hour, this would equate to 134\nkcal/day. This amount of energy is slightly greater than that\nassociated with 30 minutes/day of brisk walking (0.5 hours/\nand is similar to the level of energy imbalance that has been\nassociated with the current obesity epidemic (33). Hence,\neven modest reductions in time spent in sedentary behaviors\nhave the potential to increase energy expenditure and alter\nenergy balance, if the increase in expenditure is not offset by\na compensatory increase in energy intake.\nStrengths of this study include the use of a large repre-\nsentative sample of children and adults in the United States,\nTABLE 3.

We\nsupported our accelerometer cutpoint selection with a vali-\ndation study in adults using a near-gold standard. This same\ncutpoint was identified in a calibration study among adoles-\ncent girls (15). An additional strength of our study was that\nthe majority of participants were quite compliant with the\nmeasurement procedures. While the minimum number of\ndays of observation required to be included in our analyses\nwas only 1, nearly 80 percent of the sample wore the device\nfor at least 10 hours/day on 3 or more days. There has been\nsome debate regarding the minimal number of days of ob-\nservation required to achieve useful estimates from acceler-\nometers in field-based studies (34, 35) and issues associated\nwith missing data (36). Our decision to use data for persons\nwith at least one day of observation differs from decisions\nmade by other investigators, but our results are virtually\nidentical to those of Healy et al. (16), who required at least\n5 days of observation, including one weekend day, and those\nof Pate et al. (26), who employed a minimum of 6 days of\nmeasured and imputed observation. This suggests that our\nmethods provide useful estimates of the population mean for\namount of time spent in sedentary behavior.\nLimitations of our study should also be considered. The\namount of monitor-wearing time in our study (13.9 hours/\nday) was approximately 1.5 hours/day less than the average\nwaking time reported in other national surveys (13). Thus,\nour estimates of time spent in sedentary behaviors are likely\nto have underestimated the actual amount of time spent in\nthese behaviors. If we normalized the population average for\nthe proportion of monitored time spent being sedentary\ntime spent in sedentary behavior would increase from 7.7\nhours/day to 8.5 hours/day. In addition, the assessment of\nsedentary behaviors by accelerometer is relatively new, and\nour estimates of time spent in these behaviors will have been\nsensitive to the cutpoints employed. That said, it is unlikely\nthat cutpoint selection would have affected our results with\nrespect to age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Future studies that\nuse more direct estimates of body position (e.g., see the\npaper by Grant et al. (37)) are needed to confirm the present\nresults. Additionally, our results provide estimates of the\naverage amount of time spent per day in sedentary behaviors\nand reflect the influence of both weekend days and weekdays;\npatterns of behavior may vary on these days. Finally, our\ncross-sectional study design limits causal inferences, partic-\nularly for the age differences reported, and our results are\ngeneralizable only to the noninstitutionalized population of\nthe United States. Results from this report should be inter-\npreted accordingly.\nIn conclusion, children and adults in the United States\nspend the majority of their waking time in sedentary behav-\niors. The most sedentary groups in the population are older\nyears), while the least sedentary groups are children (ages\n6\u00ad11 years) and Mexican-American males. Given the large\namount of time spent each day in sedentary behaviors in the\nUnited States, efforts to reduce the amount of time spent in\nlow-energy-expenditure pursuits are warranted.\n"
