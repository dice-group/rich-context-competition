This indicates\nthat the illumination information is one potentially important factor contributing to the color\nambiguity of #TheDress--possibly by amplification of a slight principal difference in\npsychophysics of color perception which the two observer groups showed for abstract\nuniformly colored fields displaying a white\u00adblue ambiguity (Experiment 2).\n",

It had been initialized by the photo of a lace dress posted on\nlink is not available anymore; alternatively see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nThe_dress_%28viral_phenomenon%29) that evoked ambiguous color perceptions in its\nobservers. The debate mainly went: It's white with golden lace!--No, it's blue and\nblack!--No, no, now it's this, then it's that, I can switch! . . . The observation that a stimulus\ncan induce intra- or interindividually varying, sometimes even switching perceptions is not\nnew, indeed. Perceptual multistability elicited by ambiguous figures such as the Necker cube\nis a classic example in this regard, and the evocation of perceptual challenge by means of\nambiguity is even a core aesthetic principle, for example, in modern art (Muth, Hesslinger, &\nCarbon, 2015). Concerning color perception, intra- or inter-individual variation is known as\nwell: Even though the human visual system is equipped with mechanisms to preserve color\nconstancy (e.g., Gegenfurtner, 2003), our perceptions of an object's color can vary, for\ninstance, as these mechanisms work more or less well depending on illumination condition\nand background (Pearce, Crichton, Mackiewicz, Finlayson, & Hurlbert, 2014). Interobserver\ndiscrepancies in perceived color can further be related to factors such as differing current\nstates of chromatic adaptation, different color memories of observers encountering an object,\nand differences in the composition of retinal photo pigments (e.g., Jameson, Highnote, &\nIn order to explain the differently perceived colors of #TheDress, several assumptions have\nbeen brought forward by vision scientists, for example, that the different perceptions were\nrelated to differential color sensitivity or differences in anchoring and the resulting lightness\nperception (cf. Gilchrist et al., 1999). In the present research, we focussed on the hypothesis\nthat interindividual differences in the use of illumination information (e.g., Palmer, 1999)\ncontribute to the variance in the perception of #TheDress. This hypothesis or, as Brainard\nand Hurlbert (2015) called it, the ``colour constancy explanation'' refers to the mechanism\nwhich enables color constancy under varying illumination conditions by inferring the type or\nquality of illumination of a scene and correcting the percept accordingly. With regards to\n#TheDress, it was hypothesized that some persons infer and correct for a bluish illumination,\nthus perceiving a white\u00adgolden dress, while others infer and correct for a yellowish\nillumination, thus perceiving a blue\u00adblack dress.\nGeneral Method\nThe sample, setting, and apparatus were the same for both experiments. We describe them\nhere in the first part. Detailed information on the procedure and results of each experiment\nwill follow straight afterwards in the respective sections.\nParticipants\nA total of 48 volunteers (24 women; Mage\n\u00bc 24.8 years) with normal or corrected-to-normal\nvision (checked via Snellen test) and normal color vision (checked via a short version of the\nIshihara test) participated in the study which comprised Experiments 1 and 2. Each\nparticipant completed both experiments within one session. In order to prevent the\npsychophysical functions assessed in Experiment 2 from being biased by previous exposure\nto the photo of #TheDress which was shown in Experiment 1, the order the experiments were\nactually executed in was inverse to the numbering we use here: first Experiment 2, then\nExperiment 1. On basis of the ratings participants gave for the original digital photo of\n#TheDress in Experiment 1, they were post-hoc classified as white\u00adgold perceivers and\nblue\u00adblack perceivers, respectively. The rating scale ranged from 0 (not blue at all) to 100\n(very blue), and participants' classification was executed on basis of a mean score of\n50--actually the result of classification would have been exactly the same if we had used a\nmedian split instead as the median was 52.5, so very close to the mean score of 50. By chance,\nit turned out that half of the sample was to be classified as white\u00adgold perceivers (n1\nwomen; Mage\n\u00bc 25.4 years), and the other half was to be classified as blue\u00adblack perceivers\n\u00bc 24.3 years). The two groups clearly differed from each other\n(Mdiff\nCohen's definition of a d \u00bc 0.80 as indicating an already large effect). Participants were\nnaive to the purpose of the experiments and were tested individually. All procedures were\nin accordance with the national ethical standards on human experimentation and with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2008. Informed written consent was obtained\nfrom all participants.\nSetting and Apparatus\nBoth experiments were conducted in the same laboratory with constant lighting conditions\n(no daylight entering from outside; illumination of the lab via Osram cool daylight\ntechnology). The experiments were run on a Dell Desktop PC with a true color Eizo\nlinearized via the integrated calibration routine (IPS Panel) at the beginning of each session.\nde l'E\n\u00b4 clairage (CIE) color space xyY values. During the experiments, the participants were\nsitting at a constant distance of 50 cm in front of the screen, which was ensured by using a\nchin\u00adforehead rest. For stimulus delivery and data collection we used the up-to-date\nExperiment Builder version 1.10.1241 (SR Research Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario).\nExperiment 1\nIn Experiment 1, we tested whether illumination information provided by the photo of\n#TheDress had an impact on the perception of the colors of #TheDress. Our rationale\nwas: If the color constancy explanation (see earlier text) is right, that is if interindividual\ndifferences in the use of illumination information significantly contribute to the differences in\nthe perception of the dress, these differences will decrease when the illumination information\nof the image is reduced. A reduction of illumination information was implemented by means\nof image scrambling.\nMethod\nStimuli. We used the original digital photo of #TheDress and multiple variants of the same\nthat varied with regards to the degree of information about illumination. Photographs\nusually provide some kind of information about the illumination of the original scene such\nas background or surround, detectable shadows, reflections, familiar objects the color of\nHesslinger and Carbon 3\nwhich is known, and so forth. For the present experiment, we systematically reduced\nillumination information by cropping and scrambling the digital photograph of #TheDress\nthat had been posted on tumblr. More precisely, we first selected a rectangular part of the\noriginal digital photo so that there was nothing of the original background left in the\nresulting cropped image rectangle to prevent integrative scrambling of the background (see\nFigure 1, leftmost depiction). Then we scrambled the cropped image rectangle (384 \u00c2 904\npixel, visual angle 11.8 \u00c2 27.4) several times using different sizes of scramble squares.\nThe scrambling process was executed via a self-programmed Matlab routine that\nsegmented the image into scramble squares with side length a which were randomly\npermuted. For the present experiment, we defined the following 17 side lengths: a \u00bc 200,\nused scramble squares were (i.e., the more ``segmented'' the image was), the less valid\nillumination information was preserved in the stimulus. So, for the scrambled version with\nthe smallest scramble squares, illumination information was most strongly reduced as\ncompared with the original photo (though not fully abolished, of course). The scrambling\nprocess was performed twice for each side length. We thus obtained 2 \u00c2 17 \u00bc 34 scrambled\nversions. In sum, we had 1 (original digital photo of #TheDress) \u00fe 1 (cropped image\nrectangle) \u00fe 34 (scrambled versions of the cropped image rectangle) \u00bc 36 stimuli to be used\nin Experiment 1. Several exemplary stimuli are presented in Figure 1 (Note. Scrambling is\nonly one possible procedure for systematically reducing the degree and validity of\nillumination information besides, for example, phase manipulation by adding noise, see\nWichmann, Braun, & Gegenfurtner, 2006. We decided to use scrambling as it preserves\nthe local color information of the image).\nProcedure. Participants rated the original digital photograph of #TheDress as well as a\ncropped rectangular version and scrambled variants of the same with regards to their\ndegree of being blue. The whole experiment comprised 36 trials. In each trial, one of the\n36 stimuli was presented singly in the center of the screen until participants pressed the space\nkey to indicate that they were ready to give their rating. On the following screen, participants\nwere asked to indicate their impression of how blue the just-presented stimulus was. In order\nto do so, they entered an integer between 0 \u00bc not blue at all and 100 \u00bc very blue and confirmed\ntheir decision by pressing the enter key. The next trial started automatically (inter trial\nFigure 1.

Instructions\nand a trial scheme for Experiment 1 are shown in Figure 2.\nResults and Discussion\nWhile white\u00adgold perceivers and blue\u00adblack perceivers differed markedly in their\ninterpretations of the color of less segmented versions, their ratings became closer and\ncloser to each other with increasing image segmentation (Figure 3). In fact, the difference\nbetween both groups' interpretations of the version that was segmented to a very high degree\n(where scramble squares of very small side length were used) and thus provided the least\nFigure 3.

General instructions (left) and trial scheme (right) for Experiment 1; wording translated (original\nwording was German).\nHesslinger and Carbon 5\nillumination information was statistically insignificant (see also caption of Figure 3).\nThe pattern of results we found indicates that the (specific) background and illumination\nof the original digital photo of #TheDress contribute to the variation in the perception of the\ncolors of the depicted garment. This is in line with some of the findings of Lafer-Sousa,\nHerman and Conway (2015), who showed that perceivers vary more in their judgments\nof the colors of #TheDress when the photo is presented with the original background\nthan when it is presented with alternative backgrounds that provide ``unambiguous\nillumination cues'' (p. R2).\nThe next question, however, is: Which factor(s) might underlie this individual difference in\ncolor constancy found for #TheDress? Brainard and Hurlbert (2015) suggested testing for\nother individual differences using stimuli that are much simpler than #TheDress (p. R553).\nThat was exactly what we did in the second experiment.\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, we investigated whether white\u00adgold and blue\u00adblack perceivers also differ in\ntheir perceptions of simpler stimuli. To that end, we assessed the different observers'\npsychophysical functions of color perception for a white\u00adblue and a gold\u00adblack\ncolor continuum, respectively, and compared the perceptions of the two observer groups\n(white\u00adgold and blue\u00adblack perceivers).\nMethod\nmonitor primaries. We divided each continuum into 51 color levels (shades) to be presented\non the screen in the form of uniformly colored full-screen rectangles (1,920 \u00c2 1,200 pixel,\nProcedure. The experiment comprised two parts. In the first part, participants rated all\n51 color levels of the white\u00adblue continuum; in the second part, they rated all 51 color\nlevels of the gold\u00adblack continuum. For each continuum, the respective stimuli were\npresented on the screen one by one in randomized order until participants pressed the\nspace key to indicate that they were ready to give their rating. On the following screen,\nparticipants were asked to indicate the color of the presented stimulus by entering an\nto confirm their decision by pressing the enter key. The next trial started automatically (inter\ntrials. Instructions and a trial scheme for the white\u00adblue continuum are shown in Figure 4.\nResults and Discussion\nOn the white\u00adblue but not the gold\u00adblack continuum, the average psychophysical function\nobtained for white\u00adgold perceivers differed slightly but systematically and significantly from\nthe function obtained for blue\u00adblack perceivers (p \u00bc .0434, p\ncolor levels (shades) that were colorimetrically more white than blue. Here, blue\u00adblack\nperceivers reported higher amounts of blue than white\u00adgold perceivers (see Figure 5;\nalthough interaction color level \u00c2 perceiver group was not reaching the significance level of\n.05, concretely: p \u00bc .0663, the systematic difference between both groups along a wide range\nof color levels was quite obvious although being quite small in size). This might reflect a\nslightly higher sensitivity for blue components or, at least, a slight bias toward interpreting\nwhite\u00adblue ambiguities as blue rather than white.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe divergent perceptions of #TheDress did also show up under highly standardized lab\nconditions with a color-calibrated monitor (see also, e.g., Gegenfurtner, Bloj, & Toscani,\n2015). This demonstrates that the observed variance in perceiving #TheDress is not merely a\nresult of different technical presentation devices used by different observers in the field.\nIn the present study, we tested the so-called ``colour constancy explanation'' (Brainard &\nHurlbert, 2015) that explains the variation in the perceptions of #TheDress on basis of a\nFigure 5. Psychophysics of color perception for the white\u00adblue continuum split by perceiver group. Error\nbars indicate \u00c6 1 SEM.\nFigure 4. General instructions (left) and trial scheme (right) for Experiment 2/part 1 (white\u00adblue\ncontinuum); wording translated (original wording was German).\nHesslinger and Carbon 7\nspecific mechanism involved in obtaining color constancy under different illumination\nconditions. In Experiment 1, we found that the illumination information provided by the\noriginal digital photo of #TheDress and the way it is used by the observer seems to be one\npotentially important factor for the divergence it evokes, indeed. Our results may support the\nassumption that white\u00adgold and blue\u00adblack perceivers process or interpret this information\ndifferently. This difference between the two observer groups might trace back to and amplify\na more basic interindividual difference in the psychophysics of perceiving stimuli that\n``display'' a color ambiguity on the white\u00adblue continuum. In Experiment 2, we found that\nobservers who perceive #TheDress as blue and black are a little bit more ready to interpret or\nperceive such ambiguity as blue rather than white. Interestingly, for the gold\u00adblack\ncontinuum, we did not find a significant difference between the psychophysical curves of\nthe two observer groups. This indicates that the interpretation and perception of colors on\nthe white\u00adblue continuum are of specific importance here.\nIt should be noted that our results are not only compatible with the color constancy\nexplanation. For instance, the scrambling method utilized in Experiment 1 does not only\nreduce illumination information, but also disrupts form, so Gestalt detection is undermined\nand, ultimately, the meaning of the image is not (easily) accessible any longer. The Gestalt\nitself, in this case the dress, its design and the texture of the material it is made of, however,\nare potential cues for inferences about color. Lafer-Sousa et al. (2015), for example, observed\nthat relatively more observers interpreted #TheDress as being white and golden, when the\nphoto was presented at larger sizes so that high-spatial frequency information, which\nprovides a cue to the material, was more evident.\nIn our study, the participants did not explicitly report changes of their percepts of\n#TheDress. Yet, in related studies in which we investigated further aspects of the\nphenomenon of #TheDress in different contexts (unpublished), we registered so-called\n``switchers'' as well, and according to the data of Lafer-Sousa et al. (2015), for instance,\nnumerous naive observers (45%) experience a switch between the first and following\nexposures. How to relate such cases of switching to our results on (static) group\ndifferences in psychophysics of interpreting and perceiving white\u00adblue ambiguities is a\nquestion that is not easily answered, but requires further empirical investigation.\nThe difference between the psychophysical curves of white\u00adgold and blue\u00adblack perceivers\nthat we found in Experiment 2 might be a first indication of more basic differences underlying\nthe phenomenon of different percepts observed for #TheDress. An important next step would\nbe locating the (physiological) basis of the found psychophysical results within the visual\napparatus. Furthermore, the processes relating them to the differential use of illumination\ninformation remain to be identified.\n"
