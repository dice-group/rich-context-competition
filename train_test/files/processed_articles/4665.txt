We show that this pattern closely mirrors the emergence of a partisan disparity in the proportion of women\nin the US public with the typical characteristics of high-level officeholders. Our analysis indicates that the proportion of\nwomen in the Democratic pool of potential candidates is now two to three times larger than in the Republican pool of\npotential candidates. Given the current association of party identification with gender and other characteristics, this gap\nis more likely to increase than decrease over the coming decade, with potential consequences for the descriptive and\nsubstantive representation of women in American politics.\n",

The\nprevalence of the Christian Right in the Republican party\nalso hinders the demand for Republican women candidates,\nwhile the support of women's groups particularly enhances\nDemocratic women's representation (Elder, 2012). These\nfindings are consistent with research demonstrating that\ninternationally, leftist parties typically run more women\ncandidates than rightist parties, due in part to the egalitarian\nideology more common in left-wing parties (Caul, 1999;\nLovenduski and Norris, 1993). Furthermore, at least in\nadvanced democracies, populations with more egalitarian\ncultures and greater openness to women's leadership \u00ad\nviews more common among left than right party identifiers\n\u00ad are more likely to elect women to political office (Inglehart\nOur analysis focuses on the supply of Democratic and\nRepublican women candidates. Since 1980, women have\ndemonstrated a preference for the Democratic party, sup-\nporting Democratic candidates and identifying as\nDemocrats at higher rates than men (Box-Steffensmeier\nthe supply of women candidates available to each party,\nbecause women's presence as party activists is positively\ncorrelated with their presence as elected officials in a num-\ndifferences in party identification by gender in theAmerican\npublic at large are insufficient to explain a much larger gap\nbetween Democratic and Republican women's representa-\ntion in political office. Thus, some have turned to narrower\nmeasures of the supply of political candidates to explain the\nparty gap among female officeholders.\nSeveral studies have focused on the supply of working\nwomen in the electorate and suggested that pools of women\ncandidates differ by party. Women's presence in the labor\nforce has a greater effect on women's representation as\nDemocratic than Republican state legislators (Elder, 2012;\nreveals, a larger proportion of women in education, law,\nand activism professions are Democrats than Republicans\n(Lawless and Fox, 2010).2 Focusing on the supply of candi-\ndates with political experience, Elder (2008) also notes that\nthere are significantly more Democratic than Republican\nwomen state legislators. Although adherence to traditional\ngender roles has waned among both Republican and\nDemocratic women (Sanbonmatsu, 2002a), any remaining\ndifferences in views about women's role in society between\nwomen partisans may contribute to these differences in\nlabor force patterns and influence the supply of women\npotential candidates. The relative prevalence of women\namong partisans matters, not because parties could not\nidentify a sufficient number of women candidates if gender\nbalance were prioritized in candidate selection, but because\nwithout such efforts the gender composition of representa-\ntives will reflect the populations from which successful\ncandidates are drawn.\nWe develop a measure of the supply of women candi-\ndates that goes beyond those considered in previous work\nin several ways. First, we focus our attention not on all\nwomen in the workforce, but specifically on women with\nhigh educational attainment working in the kinds of occu-\npations that one typically finds on a congressional candi-\ndate's resum\u00e9.3 Second, we focus on strong partisans, to\naddress the fact that even a well-educated person in a pres-\ntigious occupation is unlikely to run if they do not have a\nclear preference between the two parties. Existing studies\nthat examine the supply of women in the candidate pool\nnote that political activism is an important determinant of\nrecruitment to candidacy (e.g. Lawless and Fox, 2010), but\ndo not construct their sample of the candidate pool based on\nstrength of party identification. Third, we examine the dis-\ntribution of men and women among individuals with these\nelite, partisan characteristics, recognizing that men and\nwomen may be distributed differently by party within this\nsubset than they are in the broader population. Finally, and\nmost importantly, we estimate the gender composition of\nthis pool of potential candidates over a period of four dec-\nades by drawing on the General Social Survey, a long-\nrunning, nationally representative survey. This enables us\nto explain past changes in women's office holding by party\nand make projections into the near future. Existing studies\nhave provided helpful detail regarding women's presence\nin key feeder professions for political candidacy, but such\nnuance comes at the cost of being able to look back in time\nand examine the relationship between the supply of women\ncandidates and their election to public office as it emerged\nthrough US political history and is likely to proceed going\nforward. Previous research has indicated that more women\nDemocrats than Republicans are state legislators, educa-\ntors, lawyers, and activists (Elder, 2008; Lawless and Fox,\n2010). Our analysis pinpoints the moment in history when\nthis party gap emerged and highlights that it exists in a\nbroader population than these previous studies have\nindicated.\nData and method\nTo estimate how the pool of potential candidates has\nevolved in terms of gender composition, we used the cumu-\nlative file of the General Social Survey (GSS) from 1972 to\n2010. The GSS is the largest survey over this period that\nincludes self-reported party identification as well as age,\nCrowder-Meyer and Lauderdale 3\nbirth year, education, work status and occupational pres-\ntige.4 Our aim was to estimate how the gender composition\nof the pool of potential candidates for each party evolved\nover time, as birth cohorts with varying profiles of educa-\ntion, occupation and partisanship by gender passed through\nthe ages that are typical of new members of Congress. New\nrepresentatives are typically between 35 and 60, have col-\nlege and usually some post-graduate education, are\nemployed in a high status occupation and are strong parti-\nUnfortunately we cannot estimate the gender composi-\ntion of the candidate pool simply by looking at the gender\ncomposition of individuals who meet all of these criteria. In\nthe entire GSS time series, out of roughly 55,000 respond-\nmore years of education and jobs in the top 10% of occupa-\ntional prestige.5 Thus, simple cross-tabulation is not an\nattractive approach to estimate how gender balance has\nevolved by birth cohort for Democratic versus Republican\nidentifiers.\nInstead, we propose a new method to estimate the gen-\nder composition of the pool of candidates. We fit regression\nmodels with gender of the GSS respondent as the depend-\nent variable. This kind of specification is unusual, but\nappropriate here because we want to estimate a conditional\nprobability without any claim as to the underlying process\nthat generated the relationships in the data.6 We aim to esti-\nmate the probability of a citizen being female, conditional\non that citizen having the demographic and political char-\nacteristics typical of new representatives. By using regres-\nsion modeling to estimate these conditional probabilities,\nwe can leverage the gender composition of individuals who\nhave most of the attributes we are interested in order to help\nestimate the gender composition of individuals who have\nall of these attributes.\nA potential disadvantage is that our regression model\nmight assume too much, imposing relationships on the data\nthat lead to misleading inferences about the peculiar group\nof individuals that we are interested in. We address this risk\nby constructing our estimates using the nonparametric\n99), which assumes that the log-odds of being female vary\nlinearly as a function of birth cohort, age, occupational\nprestige and education, but only for values of these varia-\nbles near the values of interest. The local regression is\nachieved by means of kernel weighting that puts more\nweight on respondents whose characteristics more closely\nresemble those for whom we want to estimate composition\nby gender. In the supplemental appendix, we provide the\nexact GSS question wordings and our variable codings, an\nexplanation of why local logistic regression is superior to\nGLM and GAM regressions in this application, an explana-\ntion of how we used cross-validation to choose kernel\nbandwidths, and a relatively imprecise analysis of the same\ndata using cross-tabulation. Using our approach, we can\nestimate the proportion of women among Americans with\nthe typical (non-gender) characteristics of a potential candi-\ndate for the US House at a given point in time. The analysis\nwe present focuses on 48 year-old, employed strong parti-\nsans with 18 years of education at the 97.5 percentile of\noccupational prestige. The relevant features of the trends\nwe estimate are, however, robust to moderately changing\nthese values.\nWe also computed local logistic regression estimates of\nthe rate at which each party elected women to the US House\nturnover in House seats from the cumulative ICPSR code\nfile for the roll call database maintained by Keith Poole.7\nFrom these data, we found the number of new members of\nCongress across all states in each year, indicating the num-\nber of turnover and seat creation events.8 We constructed a\nlist of every woman who has ever served in the House and\nlinked this to the ICPSR code file to determine when each\nwoman was initially elected. This yielded a data set of 1501\nnewly elected members of Congress over 21 elections, with\nthe year, party and gender for each. For both local logistic\nregression analyses \u00ad on the pool of potential candidates\nand on the newly elected representatives \u00ad we calculate\n95% pointwise confidence bands around our estimates via\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of gender composition within\nthe estimated pool of potential candidates and the evolution\nof gender composition of newly elected members of\nCongress, for Democrats and Republicans. While the trends\nare not identical, they are strikingly similar in several\nrespects.\nIn the early 1970s, the proportion of women in the pool\nof potential candidates for each party was similar, less than\n10% of the total pool for each party. Women's presence in\nthe pool of candidates increased as they entered feeder pro-\nfessions in higher numbers, but unequally between the par-\nties. By 1990 there were twice as many women in the\nDemocratic pool of candidates as the Republican pool, a\ndifference maintained over the subsequent two decades as\nboth pools of candidates gained more women proportion-\nately. In 2012, the model estimates that women composed\n56% of the Democratic pool and 26% of the Republican\npool. Our model-based extrapolations become very uncer-\ntain by 2020, but the evidence based on GSS respondents\ncurrently younger than our target age of 48 indicates that\nthe partisan gender gap is increasing rather than decreasing\nin younger cohorts.\nThe proportion of women among newly elected repre-\nsentatives has followed a similar pattern. A gap between the\naround 1990, and has continued to drift upward subse-\n4 Research and Politics \n11% for Republicans, similar to actual figures in that elec-\ntively. While these new representative rates follow the\nsame historical patterns of growth among Democrats and\nstagnation among Republicans, they are consistently and\nsubstantially lower than our estimates of the proportion of\nwomen in the pool of candidates.\nNote also that 1992\u00adthe `Year of the Woman' (Berch,\nyear where the proportion of women elected matched the\nabsolute level of women in our estimated pool of candi-\ndates. The new Democratic cohorts elected in 1972 and\n1992 are outliers in the sense that our estimated trend in the\nrate at which women are elected is outside the 95% confi-\ndence interval based on those elections alone. However,\nsince there are 42 party-election-years in the data, two such\noutliers is what we would expect to see by chance. Thus,\nthere is a limit to how strongly we should interpret these\nyears in terms of the underlying processes that generate\nnew congressional cohorts, even though they are notewor-\nthy in terms of their outcomes.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThe gender composition of our estimated pool of candi-\ndates for Democrats and Republicans closely matches the\nhistorical trends in women's emergence in the US House.\nWhile this does not necessarily imply that this diverging\nsupply of women is the only explanation for the diverging\nproportions of women among Democratic and Republican\nmembers of Congress, it does provide a straightforward\nexplanation for this aspect of the historical trends.\nOne striking pattern in these estimates is that the propor-\ntion of women in the potential Republican candidate pool\nseems to have plateaued. Given that the partisan gap among\nnewly elected women representatives is already approach-\ning three to one, this indicates the possibility of an increas-\ningly stark discrepancy between the parties, with a\nDemocratic caucus approaching gender parity and a\nRepublican caucus that remains overwhelmingly male.\nBecause research indicates that women's presence in\noffice affects policymaking and voters in a variety of ways\nbetween the parties may have significant effects on the par-\nties'platforms, legislative priorities and appeals to the elec-\ntorate. For example, our research suggests that the\nRepublican Party's increasing desire to `develop a surro-\ngate list of women' to reach out to voters, and to focus on\n`encouraging and championing [women's] desire to seek\nelective office' (Republican National Committee, 2013:\n20\u00ad21) may be hindered by the supply of Republican\nwomen with the typical characteristics of political candi-\ndates. The additional effort needed to identify women in a\npool where they are substantially outnumbered by men may\nlimit the extent to which the Republican party draws on\neven the supply of women partisans currently available.\nThus our findings highlight the need for continuing research\nexamining the causes of this party gap.\nTo the extent that this gap is driven by differing gender\nnorms among Republicans and Democrats \u00ad whether due to\nwomen's selection of a party that matches their gender\nviews, or women's shifting of their gender role beliefs to\nmatch those of the party with which they affiliate \u00ad the\nFigure 1. Evolution of gender composition in the estimated pool of candidates (left panel) versus estimated trend for newly\nelected US House representatives (right panel). Confidence bands (shaded region) are based on 1000 bootstrap replications.\nIn 1972 and 1992 (plotted outliers with 95% intervals, right panel), the proportion of women among newly elected Democratic\ncandidates was significantly above the estimated trend.\nCrowder-Meyer and Lauderdale 5\nsupply of women candidates from within the Republican\nelectorate may expand only following extensive changes in\nthe ideology of the Republican party more broadly. Studies\nhave revealed shifts of this nature occurring internationally,\nwith more egalitarian gender norms expanding beyond left-\nist parties over time (Lovenduski and Norris, 1993; Matland\nand Studlar, 1996). In the US, however, time trends in\nresponses to GSS questions about gender roles are ambigu-\nous as to whether the differences between Democratic and\nRepublican partisans are narrowing or not since the 1980s.9\nIn fact, polarization of US parties on these issues may pre-\nvent the spread of egalitarianism across parties from occur-\nring in the same way as in other nations. While positions on\nsocial and cultural issues such as gender equity were previ-\nously minimally correlated with party identification in the\nelites polarized on these issues, and they became part of the\nprofile of disagreements distinguishing the parties (Adams,\nRepublican elites have continued to polarize on these and\nrelated social issues (Hetherington, 2010) and their views\nhave extended to many mass party identifiers (Layman and\nCarsey, 2002). Thus while further liberalizing of gender\nviews in the US could bring American women's political\nrepresentation closer to women's representation in other\nadvanced democracies by expanding the supply of women\nin the pool of candidates, polarization and conflict exten-\nsion may limit this movement within the Republican party,\nleading to growth rather than narrowing of the party gap in\nthe supply of women potential candidates in the US.\nThe other prominent disparity in these estimates is\nbetween the gender composition of high education, high\nprestige, middle aged partisans and the gender composition\nof those who are actually elected.10 Although women now\ncomprise a majority of those in our estimated pool of\nDemocratic potential candidates, and a significant minority\nof Republican potential candidates, women's representa-\ntion as members of Congress remains far lower. While a\nqualification gap between men and women may have been\nimportant before the post Title IX generation of women hit\nmiddle age in the 1990s, it cannot easily explain the differ-\nence in levels between the two plots in Figure 1. Many\nstudies demonstrate similarities in the qualifications and\ncampaign competencies of men and women candidates\ntors like differential recruitment (Crowder-Meyer, 2013;\nStambough and O'Regan, 2007), ambition (Lawless and\n2013), or some other force driving down the proportion of\neligible women actually running for and taking office.\nWhatever factors explain the difference between the two\nplots may also affect women in the two parties differently\n\u00ad particularly if different gender norms among Republicans\nand Democrats depress Republican women's political\nambition, recruitment by elites, or votes from the elector-\nate. So, while our projections indicate that the partisan gen-\nder gap in the US House is more likely to widen than not,\nchanges in these other factors could reshape this gap in the\nfuture.\nPrevious studies demonstrating single digit gender gaps\nin US party identification have not been able to explain the\nmuch larger gap when it comes to US elected officials. But\nrepresentatives do not emerge from the public at large:\nthey are disproportionately individuals with high educa-\ntion, high occupational prestige, and clear partisan prefer-\nences. By estimating the gender composition of this select\ngroup by partisanship, we find that the partisan gender gap\nis much larger among the kinds of citizens who tend to\nbecome representatives and that the emergence of this gap\nwas contemporaneous with the historical emergence of a\npartisan gender gap in the US House. Given the current\nassociations between gender, partisanship, and other attrib-\nutes among the public, the data suggest that future genera-\ntional replacement may exacerbate the already significant\ngap in women's descriptive representation between the\nparties, potentially reshaping the behavior of each party's\nelected officials, the quality of representation available to\ndiverse members of the public, and opinions of the public\ntoward the Republican and Democratic parties.\n"
