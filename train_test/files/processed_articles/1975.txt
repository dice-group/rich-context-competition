Using data from National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2005\nto 2008), hypertension was defined by current use of anti-\nhypertensive medication or systolic blood pressure\nSelf-reported sleep disorders and duration were catego-\nrized from a single household interview question, and sleep\nquality was determined from several questions on sleeping\nhabits. The prevalence of hypertension was 30.2% and\nders, short sleep, and poor sleep, respectively. After\nadjustment for demographic characteristics and comorbid-\nities, having sleep disorders only was not significantly\nassociated with hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95%\nconfidence interval [CI], 0.73)3.77). However, this associa-\ntion was modified by sleep duration: significant associa-\ntions were observed among adults with concurrent sleep\nand with sleep disorders, short sleep, and poor sleep (OR,\nciation between a combination of sleep problems and\nhypertension, but prospective studies are needed to\nunderstand the complex interplay between them. J Clin\nPeriodicals, Inc.\nAn estimated 1 in 3 adults in the United States has\nhypertension.1 Although the major risk factors for\nhypertension, including family history, sedentary life-\nstyle, poor diet, cigarette smoking, sex, race, and age,\nhave been widely established,1 one unconventional and\noften overlooked risk factor is sleep. Sleep is essential\nfor optimal health and vitality, but a 2008 study by\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nfound, based on self-reports, that 11% of adults in the\nUnited States got insufficient rest or sleep.2 Given its\nimportance, it is not surprising that researchers have\nfound an association between poor quality of sleep\nand negative health behaviors and outcomes.3,4 For\nexample, several studies have shown a link between\nshort sleep and hypertension among adults, with this\nassociation differing by sex (higher among women)\nand age (no association among the elderly aged 58\u00ad\n98 years).5\u00ad9 Furthermore, similar associations with\nhypertension have been documented for specific sleep\ndisorders (apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome)10\u00ad13\nand for the quality of sleep.14\nTo date, findings of the studies performed have been\nsomewhat limited because of variations in study popu-\nlations and study designs, small samples, and a focus\nlargely on one sleep abnormality at a time and its rela-\ntion with hypertension. Thus, the present study was\ndesigned to describe the distribution of demographic\nand health characteristics by hypertension status and\nto examine the simultaneous association of sleep disor-\nders, the duration of sleep, and sleep quality on hyper-\ntension among US adults.\nMETHODS\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES), a continuous series of cross-sectional\nsurveys based on nationally representative samples of\nthe US civilian noninstitutionalized population, uses a\ncomplex, stratified, multistage sampling design to\nrecruit participants from clusters of households.15 In\nNHANES, participants undergo a detailed home inter-\nview, followed by a physical examination and labora-\ntory evaluation at a local mobile examination center\n(MEC). The present study analyzed NHANES data\nwere excluded because of pregnancy, 1061 were\ndropped because of missing data on blood pressure\n(BP), and 32 were pregnant and lacking a measure-\nment of BP, yielding a final analytic sample of 10,308\nmen and women. Informed consent was obtained from\nall participants, and the protocol was approved by the\ninstitutional review board of the National Center for\nHealth Statistics.\nSleep disorders were identified by a response of\n``yes'' to the household interview question ``Have you\never been told that you have a sleep disorder?'' Indi-\nviduals that answered ``yes'' were asked to specify the\ntype of sleep disorder (sleep apnea, insomnia, restless\nlegs, and other). The duration of sleep was assessed by\nAddress for correspondence: Pooja Bansil, MPH, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, 4770 Buford Highway NE, MS-K47, Atlanta, GA\nE-mail: pbansil@cdc.gov\nOfficial Journal of the American Society of Hypertension, Inc.

Based on the\nnational recommendations for sleep, a cutpoint of\n<7 hours was used to categorize individuals as sleep\ndeprived (``short sleep'' in this study). Participants\nwere classified as having poor sleep (poor quality) if\nthey answered ``often'' or ``almost always'' (together\ndefined as 5\u00ad30 times a month) to any of the 6 items\non sleeping habits as follows: (1) having trouble falling\nasleep; (2) waking up during the night and having\ntrouble getting back to sleep; (3) waking up too early\nin the morning and being unable to get back to sleep;\n(4) feeling unrested during the day, no matter how\nmany hours of sleep were obtained; (5) feeling exces-\nsively or overly sleepy during the day; and (6) not get-\nting enough sleep. To assess the combined associations\nof sleep disorders, short sleep, and poor sleep, a com-\nposite sleep variable was created with 8 mutually\nexclusive categories: (1) sleep disorder, short sleep,\nand poor sleep; (2) sleep disorder and short sleep; (3)\nsleep disorder and poor sleep; (4) sleep disorder only;\n(5) short sleep and poor sleep; (6) short sleep only; (7)\npoor sleep only; and (8) none of the above.\nParticipants were defined as having hypertension if\nthey met any of 3 criteria: mean systolic BP (SBP)\nor currently taking prescription medication to lower\nhigh BP. The average of up to 3 brachial BP readings\nwas obtained at the visit for the physical examination.\nAccording to the standard protocol for both NHANES\ncycles, trained physicians measured the BP using a cuff\nsize appropriate for the participant.15 Additional vari-\nables of interest in this analysis were body mass index\n(BMI; weight in kilograms divided by height in meters\nsquared), diabetes (participant had ever been told that\nshe/he had diabetes), and current smoker (reported\nsmoking cigarettes every day or some days).\nDemographic information obtained from the inter-\nand older), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other). The\npoverty-income ratio (PIR), which is the ratio of a\nfamily's income to the federally defined poverty\nthreshold for a family of the same size in the same\ncalendar year, was used as a proxy for socioeconomic\nstatus.

We found no\nrelationship between having a sleep disorder and\nhypertension if short sleep and/or poor sleep was not\nalso present. Among people with both a sleep disorder\nand short sleep, however, we found that the likelihood\nof hypertension was slightly more than twice that for\npeople with no sleep problems at all. This relationship\nmay, in part, be the result of biologic mechanisms,\nsuggesting that sleep deprivation may alter cortisol\nstress hormones and the sympathetic nervous system,\nresulting in elevated BP.16,17 On the other hand, our\nfindings may reflect the growing trends in obesity and\ndiabetes, as evidence indicates a high and increasing\nprevalence of hypertension and sleep-related problems\nThe lack of association between having a sleep dis-\norder (considered individually) and hypertension in\nour study is inconsistent with findings from several\nthe fact that a large number of adults, in general, are\nlikely to experience and report an occasional short\nsleep or poor sleep as compared with having a sleep\ndisorder, which often requires a physician diagnosis\nbased on the presence of a number of characteristic\nsymptoms. Further, the fact that we examined all types\nof sleep disorders, collectively, rather than individu-\nally, may have diluted the magnitude of this associa-\ntion. While evidence indicates that sleep apnea, the\nmost common sleep disorder identified in our study,\nindependently influences the development of hyperten-\nsion by a factor of three,9,10,16 findings from recent\nstudies have shown that insomnia and restless leg syn-\ndrome are strongly (up to 5 times) associated with\nAlthough our results demonstrate that sleep prob-\nlems are common, they are a potentially treatable risk\nfactor for cardiovascular morbidity. However, a recent\npoll found that only 32% of adults have ever discussed\ntheir problems regarding sleep with their health care\nmated $8.4 million on sleep clinics and $285 million\non benzodiazepines as sleep aids,20 demonstrating a\ncommon problem that lowers quality of life. The fact\nthat only 54% of 116 US medical schools offer train-\ning in sleep physiology, and only 38% offer as much\nas 1 to 4 hours of lecture on this topic, further indi-\ncates that sleep-related problems may be overlooked in\nprimary care.20 Hence, it would be useful for health\ncare professionals to be educated on how to ade-\nquately diagnose and manage both sleep disorders and\ndisturbances among adults. Moreover, findings from a\nrecent study showing that low efficiency of sleep is\nhighly associated with both prehypertension and\nhypertension in adolescents suggests that screening\nneeds to start early in life.21\nTABLE II.

First,\nbecause of the cross-sectional design we could not\ndetermine a causal relationship or rule out bidirec-\ntional relationships between sleep and hypertension. In\naddition, it is likely that BP measurements were sub-\nject to the white-coat effect. Given that white-coat\nhypertension may affect up to 20% of all diagnosed\ncases of hypertension,22 the observed associations\nbetween sleep disorders and hypertension may be\nunderestimated in this study. Further, sleep disorders,\nduration of sleep, and sleep quality were elicited from\nself-reported questions and thus they may have been\nsubject to recall bias. We note that a validity study\nthat compared self-reported and actigraph-measured\nduration of sleep found only a moderate correlation\n(0.47), and there was systematic overreporting by an\naverage of 34 minutes for each additional hour slept.23\nThus, there is a potential for misclassification and\nunderdiagnosis of the duration of sleep in our study.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs sleep habits may be a marker for health status and\nquality of life, prospective studies are needed to better\nunderstand the complex interplay between sleep and\nhypertension. While some intervention studies to\nimprove the duration and quality of sleep have been\neffective in reducing both daytime and nighttime BPs,9\nadditional studies that examine the effect of the length\nand severity of any type of sleep-related problems on\nhypertension may be of added value.\nDisclosures: The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the\nauthors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.
