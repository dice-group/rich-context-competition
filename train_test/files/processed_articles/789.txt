In epidemio-\nlogic studies, the most common methods used to as-\nsess alcohol intake are self-reported. While much ef-\nfort has been devoted to assessment of the validity and\nreliability of self-reported alcohol intake (4-6), little\ninformation exists on the reliability of alcohol intake\nas recalled from the remote past. Because alcohol\nintake in the past may be more relevant to chronic\ndisease than is current intake and the case-control\nmethod is often used in studies of chronic diseases and\nalcohol, the ability to reliably recall alcohol intake in\nthe past is of central importance in examining the\nassociation between alcohol intake and chronic dis-\neases.\nReceived for publication November 9, 1994, and in final form\nAbbreviation: NHANES I, First National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey.\n1 Chronic Disease Prevention Branch, Division of Nutrition, Na-\ntional Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.\n2 Epidemic Intelligence Service, Epidemiology Program Office,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.\n3 Departments of Epidemiology and Nutrition, Harvard University\n4 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Emory\nUniversity, Atlanta, GA.\nReprint requests to Chronic Disease Prevention Branch, Division\nof Nutrition, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and\nHealth Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nPrevious studies with different follow-up intervals\nhave shown recalled alcohol intake to be reasonably\nreliable (7-9). However, evaluation of the reliability\nand accuracy in assessing past alcohol intake among\ndifferent subgroups of the general population has re-\nceived little attention. In particular, questions regard-\ning whether and how recalled alcohol intake is related\nto current drinking status have not been answered. In\nthis study, we use data from a national cohort of US\nadults to examine 1) the reliability of alcohol recall\nover a 10-year period; and 2) the factors possibly\ninfluential on the recall of past drinking and those that\nmight lead to systematic bias in recalled alcohol in-\ntake.\nFrom the First National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey (NHANES I), a prospective cohort\nstudy, the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up\nStudy, was developed. NHANES I was conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics from 1971 to\n1975. Details of the sample selection and methodology\nhave been published previously (10). In short, subjects\nwere traced and reinterviewed for the follow-up study\n25-74 years who were examined in NHANES I from\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. People\nwere excluded from the original cohort for the follow-\ning at follow-up; 838 (5.8 percent) were found to be\nhad died; 81 (0.6 percent) had drinking information\nmissing at baseline or follow-up; and 601 (4.2 percent)\nhad information missing on one or more other influ-\nencing factors. These exclusions left 9,841 members\nof the original cohort.\nWe assessed alcohol intake both at the baseline and\nduring follow-up interviews. Alcohol intake as a con-\ntinuous variable, expressed as drinks per day, was\nbased on a series of quantity-frequency questions on\nthe medical history interview. At the baseline inter-\nview, these questions were asked:\"During the past\nyear have you had at least one drink of beer, wine, or\nliquor? (yes, no)\". Those who answered yes were then\nasked: \"How often do you drink? (every day, just\nabout every day, about 2 or 3 times a week, about 1-4\ntimes a month, more than 3 but less than 12 times a\nyear, or no more than 2 or 3 times a year)\"; and \"When\nyou drink, how much do you usually drink over 24\nhours?\"\nWe categorized people into four groups at baseline:\n1) those who reported that they had less than 12 drinks\na year; 2) those who had less than one drink a week;\n3) those who had greater than or equal to one drink a\nweek, but less than 10 drinks a week; and 4) those who\nhad 10 or more drinks a week.\nAt the follow-up interview, we asked, \"Have you\nhad at least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic bever-\nage in any one year?\" (yes, no). Respondents who\nanswered yes were then asked: \"Have you had at least\none drink of beer, wine, or liquor during the past\nyear?\" \"On the average, how often do you drink alco-\nholic beverages, that is, beer, wine, or liquor?\" \"On the\ndays you have a drink, about how many drinks do you\nusually have?\"\nWe used the same categories as those at baseline to\ncategorize current drinking status into four groups.\nThe categorization and choice of cutoff points was\ncontingent upon the questions used in assessing the\nrecalled alcohol intake in this study.\nDuring the follow-up interview, the following set of\nretrospective questions on drinking habits at baseline\nwas also asked: \"Which category best describes your\nusual drinking pattern when you were about 25 years\nold?\" (nine or more drinks a day or 60 or more drinks\nweek; about four to five drinks a day or 25-39 drinks\na week; about two or three drinks a day or 10-24\ndrinks a week; 1-9 drinks a week; less than one drink\na week; and less than 12 drinks a year).\nThis question was repeated for each of the following\nticipants had more than 24 drinks per week; therefore,\nwe combined them with the 10-24 drinks per week as\nthe top-rank drinking group to get stable estimates.\nSince the average follow-up period was 10 years, we\nselected participants who recalled their alcohol intake\nbaseline. This led to a final sample of 2,907 persons\nwho were 10 years older at the time of the follow-up\ninterview. We found similar distributions in sex, race,\neducation status, smoking, drinking status at baseline,\nand disease status between the excluded members of\nthe original cohort and those who remained in the final\nanalysis, apart from the age difference. To treat alco-\nhol intake as a continuous variable in some of the\nanalyses, we also used the midpoint value of each\ndrinking category to represent each participant's aver-\nage alcohol intake.\nWe examined reliability by calculating the\nSpearman rank order correlation coefficients (11) and\nthe kappa statistics (12) between the two interviews.\nBy comparing the age-adjusted partial Spearman cor-\nrelation coefficients, we further examined factors that\nmight affect the reliability of the recall of past alcohol\nconsumption across strata of various factors. (Formu-\nlas and methods in calculation of the partial Spearman\ncorrelation coefficients can be found in SAS procedure\nincluded sex, education level (less than high school,\ncompleted high school, and more than high school),\nsmoking status (former, current, never), current drink-\ning status, and the occurrence of chronic disease dur-\ning the follow-up period. Disease status during the\nfollow-up period was based on chronic conditions\nreported at the follow-up interview that were not re-\nported at the baseline interview, including diabetes,\nhypertension, thyroid problem, heart disease, cancer,\nchronic lung disease, and colitis.\nWe calculated the means and standard deviations for\nalcohol intake at baseline, recalled alcohol intake, and\ncurrent alcohol intake at follow-up. We then used\nanalysis of covariance (14, 15) to examine further any\nsystematic bias of recalled alcohol intake by category\nof current drinkers, age, race, education, disease sta-\ntus, and smoking status. We further assessed the rel-\native validity of recall by examining the sensitivity,\nspecificity, predictive value positive, and predictive\nvalue negative (16) at two levels of intake: 12 or more\ndrinks per year versus less than 12 drinks per year and\n10 or more drinks per week versus less than 10 drinks\nper week.\nReliability of Recalled Alcohol Intake 179\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the sample\nBoth at baseline and at follow-up, drinkers were\nmore likely to be younger, white, and better educated\n(table 1). In general, the proportion of those who had\n10 or more drinks per week and those who had less\nthan 12 drinks per year increased during the follow-up\nperiod. The same trend was also observed among\ndifferent subgroups by sex, age, education, smoking\nstatus, and disease status (table 1).\nReliability of recalled alcohol intake and possible\ninfluencing factors\nIn general, there was good agreement between re-\ncalled alcohol intake and reported intake at baseline.\nThe concordance rates (recalled intake in the same\ncategory of baseline intake) ranged from 51 to 77\npercent, and the weighted kappa ranged from 0.29 to\n0.50, with older people recalling their past reported\nintake more consistently than did younger people (ta-\nble 2). However, heavier drinkers (10 or more drinks\nper week) tended to underestimate their recall, this\nwas more evident in women (table 2). Women tended\nto recall slightly better than men (kappa statistic =\nwith the average Spearman correlation coefficients\n(r = 0.7 for women and r = 0.6 for men).\nThe Spearman correlation coefficients between re-\ncalled and baseline alcohol intakes ranged from 0.52\nto 0.74 (table 3). Across different age groups, the\ncorrelations between current alcohol intake and base-\nline intake were somewhat lower than the correlations\nbetween recalled intake and baseline intake. In gen-\neral, the correlations were lowest for current alcohol\nintake versus baseline intake. After those who reported\nfewer than 12 drinks a year at both surveys were\nexcluded, the performance of recalled intake remained\nbetter than that of current intake in assessing the\nTABLE 1.

Among both\nmen and women, the reliability of recalled alcohol\nintake did not vary with disease status. There was no\ndifference in recalled alcohol intake versus baseline\nalcohol intake between white men and nonwhite men,\nalthough white women showed higher correlation than\ndid nonwhite women (table 4). Both men and women\nwith more than a high school education appeared to\nhave higher age-adjusted partial correlation coeffi-\ncients for recalled versus baseline intake than did those\nwith lower levels of education. In men, smoking status\nappeared to be a strong influencing factor on the\nreliability of recalled intake; current smokers appeared\nto be less reliable in recalling past intake than were\nnonsmokers.\nThe assessment of accuracy of recalled intake\nWe observed no differences in means for recalled\nalcohol intake and reported alcohol intake at baseline\nfor women, but men tended to underestimate their\nbaseline intake slightly (table 5). Table 5 also shows\nestimates of the difference between the recalled intake\nand baseline intake by category of race, age, educa-\ntion, smoking status, disease status, and current drink-\ners at follow-up. Age, education and current drinking\nstatus appeared to be strong influencing factors in\nrecalling past alcohol intake. For both men and\nwomen, older persons tended to underestimate their\nalcohol intake in the past, while younger people over-\nestimated their alcohol intake in the past. Among men,\nnever smokers and those who had at least a high\nschool education tended to underestimate their alcohol\nintake in the past. There were no systematic differ-\nences among subgroups by disease status. We ob-\nserved a systematic underestimation of recalled alco-\nhol intake among current heavier drinkers of both\nsexes, but no appreciable systematic bias among other\ngroups of current drinkers.\nTable 6 describes all of the screening indices in\nrelation to distinguishing drinkers from nondrinkers\n(defined as less than 12 drinks a year) and heavier\ndrinkers (10 or more drinks per week) from other\ndrinkers. For both men and women, sensitivity was\nhighest for assessing those who had at least 12 drinks\na year versus those who had fewer than 12 drinks a\nyear (e.g., 93 percent of the men and 84 percent of the\nwomen who reported that they had at least 12 drinks a\nyear at baseline recalled that they had drunk at least 12\nTABLE 4.

On the other hand, sensitivity and\npredictive value positive appeared to be much lower\nfor assessing those who had 10 or more drinks per\nweek (heavier drinker) versus other drinkers. This was\nmore evident in women than in men.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this sample of US adults, we found an overall\ngood agreement (r = 0.7) between recalled and re-\nported baseline intake. However, recall reliability dif-\nfered among different subgroups by age, education\nlevel, and smoking status, but not by disease status.\nWe also found that recalled alcohol intake was highly\ncorrelated with current alcohol intake and that current\nheavier drinkers tended to underestimate their previ-\nous amount of drinking.\nThe general agreement (r = 0.7) in our study is\nconsistent with that reported by Longnecker et al. (8).\nIn their sample of 211 female residents of Massachu-\nsetts and Wisconsin, the Spearman correlation coeffi-\nintake versus baseline intake. The authors also found\nthat 70 percent of the women recalled themselves in\nthe same drinking category after 6-12 months, which\nis also consistent with our findings: The concordance\nrates (recalled intake in the same category of baseline\nTABLE 6.

Giovannucci et\nal. (17) used the Nurses' Health Study to compare\nalcohol intake, which was assessed by detailed diet\nrecords. Four years after completing the diet records,\nthe subjects were asked to report their alcohol intake\nfrom 4 years earlier. The investigators also found a\nhigh correlation between recalled alcohol intake and\ndiet records (r = 0.84). However, no information on\nreliability of recalled intake among subsets of the\nsample in these studies was available (for example,\naccording to age, smoking status, or education status).\nOur study has the advantage of being large and based\non a sample from the general population. Thus, we had\nenough statistical power to examine the reliability of\nrecalled alcohol intake among different subsets of the\nsample. We did find that people from some subgroups\n(age, education, and current drinking status) had dif-\nferent degrees of reliability (tables 3 and 4). In addi-\ntion, one important point warrants special attention:\nPersons from subgroups with higher reliability did not\nnecessarily recall accurately. For example, we ob-\nserved that older people recalled more consistently\nthan did their younger counterparts, but they also\nunderestimated their alcohol intake in the past. Men\nwith a high school education or higher recalled more\nconsistently than did people with a less than high\nschool education (table 4), but they were more likely\nto underestimate their alcohol intake in the past (table\n5). In case-control studies in which these factors may\nact as confounders or effect modifiers of the associa-\ntion between alcohol intake early in life and any spe-\ncific disease of interest, use of recalled data can intro-\nduce biases. Unfortunately, there is no universal rule\nthat can be applied to assess the direction and magni-\ntude of the biases, and one should assess them on an\nindividual basis depending upon the specific outcome\nof interest. Additional data on characteristics related to\nthe recalled reliability and accuracy of the past drink-\ning would be warranted to confirm these findings.\nwhether recalled intake was influenced by current\nintake. Results of these studies are mixed. Lee et al.\n(9) studied the reliability of recalled measures of al-\ncohol intake in a cohort of 873 California residents.\nBaseline data were collected in 1972, and the partici-\npants were reinterviewed in 1983. The authors found\nthat the correlation between the recalled versus base-\nline intake (r = 0.73) was higher than that for current\nversus baseline intake (r = 0.68). In addition, similar\nto our findings, they also reported that the sensitivity\nfor detecting heavier drinkers from other drinkers was\nrecalled alcohol intake did not seem to be influenced\nby current intake in that study. Simpura and\nPoikalainen (18) reported that adult men reinterviewed\n18 years later overestimated their originally reported\nalcohol intake, but reports were not biased by current\nuse. In contrast, Czarnecki et al. (19) examined 73\ngynecologic outpatients and observed several system-\natic differences in the reliability of self-reported intake\nas a function of time, including both original and\ncurrent drinking patterns. A study conducted by\nCollins et al. (20) in a group of high school students\nshowed that over a 2.5-year interval, students tended\nto report less alcohol use in retrospect than they had\noriginally reported. They also found that reports were\ninfluenced by current alcohol intake. In our study,\nregardless of age, race, sex, education, smoking status,\nand disease status during the follow-up period, the\nSpearman correlation coefficients were higher for re-\ncalled versus baseline intake than for current versus\nbaseline intake. This finding suggests that recalled\nalcohol intake is a better predictor of past intake than\nReliability of Recalled Alcohol Intake 185\nis current intake, even though current drinking status\nmay influence recall of past drinking.\nWe found the recall of alcohol intake did not differ\nby disease status. Thus, in case-control studies in\nwhich one usually uses recalled information of alcohol\nintake, any association between the disease and alco-\nhol intake early in life would likely be biased toward\nthe null. Furthermore, we observed that heavier drink-\ners at baseline were less consistent in their recalled\nalcohol intake than were lighter drinkers, and they\ntended to underestimate past drinking in 10 year recall\nreports (tables 2 and 6). This might underestimate the\nassociation of heavy consumption with disease out-\ncomes and attenuate any possible dose-response rela-\ntion between alcohol intake and outcomes of interest.\nHowever, caution should also be exercised as the\npossible misclassification of past drinking early in life\nmight not always be nondifferential (21).\nLimitations need to be considered when interpreting\nthese study results. First, the drinking questions asked\nin this study were frequency of drinking and usual\nquantity of consumption. We did not have information\non the maximum that respondents drank on any occa-\nsion and the frequency of drinking that much. Such\nquestions may yield higher estimates of drinking and,\nhence, results in a greater range of variability of alco-\nhol consumption (6, 22). Thus, it is possible that\ninclusion of such questions would have lowered the\nconsistency of recall. However, the quantity-frequency\nquestions have indeed been used widely in assessing\nthe average alcohol intake in the studies of alcohol\nintake and chronic diseases (1-3, 22). Second, ques-\ntions on alcohol intake at the baseline interview were\nsomewhat different from those at the follow-up. We\nwere not able to distinguish those who had fewer than\n12 drinks a year from abstainers. Nevertheless, the\nmain findings were similar when we excluded those\nwho reported they had fewer than 12 drinks a year at\nboth the baseline and follow-up interviews. Third,\nassigning the midpoint value of each drinking category\nof recalled intake may also be a problem if the mid-\npoint values do not reflect average intake within that\ncategory. However, we conducted two sensitivity anal-\nyses by using means and medians of each of the\ncorresponding current drinking groups at follow-up\nand assigning these values to each of the recalled\ndrinking category. Results from the analysis of covari-\nance were similar (data not shown). In addition, we\nobserved almost no difference between the mean of\npast alcohol intake and that of the recalled intake in the\nentire sample, while we observed differences among\nsome of the subgroups (table 5). This finding could not\nbe explained by using midpoint values. Finally, it is\nimportant to note that no absolute gold standard re-\ngarding the measurement of alcohol intake was avail-\nable: We had to rely on self-reported alcohol intake at\nbaseline, which certainly included reporting errors, to\nassess the relative validity of the recalled intake as\nindicators of intake at baseline.\nIn summary, although recalled alcohol intake is\ngenerally reliable, accuracy differs somewhat among\ndifferent subgroups. In particular, there appears to be\nsubstantial underestimation of recalled alcohol intake\nby current heavier drinkers. Nonetheless, reports of\nrecalled past drinking provide better estimates of past\ndrinking than do measures of current drinking. Addi-\ntional data on the recalled reliability and accuracy of\nthe past drinking history among people with different\ncharacteristics as well as the recall of some other key\ninterrelated behavior such as smoking may help us in\nthe design, analysis, and interpretation of future case-\ncontrol studies.\n"
