Ann Carson2\nNatalia Emanuel4\n Introduction\nAs the US imprisonment rate has increased, scholars have realized that the penal system\nhas an impact upon the health and wellbeing of the men and women who come into\nin part by how imprisonment shapes mortality. While imprisoned males, especially non-\nHispanic black imprisoned males, die at significantly lower rates than males in the\ngeneral population, former prisoners die at very high rates (Binswanger et al. 2007;\nResearch on the imprisonment-mortality relationship has to date focused primarily\non national estimates of this relationship for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic\nblack males, with minimal attention paid to how the imprisonment-mortality\nrelationship varies across states (but see Noonan 2013; Rosen, Wohl, and Schoenbach\n2011; Spaulding et al. 2011) and whether the lower-than-expected mortality rates of\nnon-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black inmates can also be found among female\ninmates and Hispanic inmates. These omissions are unfortunate because the research\nconsidering such variation implies substantial variations across states, racial/ethnic\ngroups, and sexes (Mumola 2007; Noonan 2013). In this article, we fill this gap by\nconsidering the imprisonment-mortality relationship across seven to nine states for non-\nHispanic white (hereafter \"white\"), non-Hispanic black (hereafter \"black\"), and\nHispanic males and females.\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 361\n2. Data and method\nWe used data from the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program, the National Prisoner\nStatistics, and the National Corrections Reporting Program (Bureau of Justice Statistics\nyear old (a) male state prisoners in nine states (California, Georgia, Mississippi,\nMissouri, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington) and (b)\nfemale state prisoners in seven states (excluding Utah and Washington). All analyses\nannually to the National Corrections Reporting Program, had low levels of missing data\non race/ethnicity, and had at least 10 deaths among state prisoners over the period. We\nfocus on individuals in the 18-54 age range to consider how imprisonment shapes the\nrisk of premature mortality, but future analyses should also consider mortality at older\nages.\nSince 2001, the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (hereafter \"DCRP\") has\ncollected information on the age, sex, and race/ethnicity for each individual who died in\na state prison. All 50 state departments of corrections have participated since 2001, thus\nproviding a total custodial death count of all state prisoners. The DCRP data provide a\nmore precise count of the number of deaths than the National Prisoner Statistics data\n(hereafter NPS) for two reasons. First, since the DCRP data are based on individual\nrecords whereas the NPS data are limited to aggregate counts, there is no risk of double-\ncounting in the DCRP. Second, the DCRP includes information on all inmates who die\nwhile in the custody of a prison, while the NPS data include only sentenced inmates,\nData from the NPS and the National Corrections Reporting Program (hereafter\nNCRP) provide the denominator for our in-prison mortality estimates. By averaging\nyear-end custody counts from the NCRP and the NPS, we can generate estimates of the\ntotal mid-year population of prisoners in each state, as well as the race/ethnicity, sex,\nand age distribution of the penal population. We rely on the mid-year population count\nof state prisoners rather than yearend counts because this provides the closest\napproximation of person-years lived during the year.\nTo generate age-specific estimates of the correctional population by race/ethnicity,\nwe apply the NCRP age distribution to the NPS jurisdiction control totals, which does\nnot collect information on the age distribution of prisoners. When race/ethnicity is\nmissing in the NCRP data, we impute it assuming the data are missing completely at\nrandom. This should negligibly affect our estimates because of the very low levels of\nmissing data on race/ethnicity in the NCRP states we use.\nWildeman et al.: State-level variation in the imprisonment-mortality relationship, 2001-2010\n362 http://www.demographic-research.org\nWe use data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate\nmortality rates in the general population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n2.2 Analytic strategy\nThe analysis proceeds in three stages. In the first, we calculate crude mortality rates for\nall males and females aged 18-54 in state prisons and in the general population in each\nstate we consider in this analysis, as well as for males and females identified as black,\nwhite, and Hispanic. In the second, we use direct standardization (Preston, Heuveline,\nand Guillot 2001) to estimate what the mortality rate of male and female state prisoners\naged 18-54 and males and females aged 18-54 in the general population would be if\nwe used the average age distribution of the population (including males and females) of\nthese states as the referent. In the final stage, we estimate standardized mortality ratios\n(SMRs) for state prisoners relative to the general population.\nAlthough the individual-level data on inmates used for all analyses are confidential\nand therefore we cannot release the individual-level data we used, all state-level data\nand files used to produce the results presented here are available online through\nDemographic Research.\n3. Results\n3.1 The imprisonment-mortality relationship for males\nResults from Table 1 show that the crude mortality rate for male prisoners in all of the\nnine states is significantly lower than it is for males in the general population. Age-\nadjusted mortality rates for male prisoners are also lower in each state than they are for\nmales in the general population. These results also show, however, that there is far more\ncross-state variation in the adjusted mortality rates of the general population (from 215\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 363\nState Crude Rate\nTotal\nAdjusted\nRate Total\nCrude Rate\nNon-Hispanic\nWhite\nAdjusted\nRate\nNon-Hispanic\nWhite\nCrude Rate\nNon-Hispanic\nBlack\nAdjusted\nRate\nNon-Hispanic\nBlack\nCrude Rate\nHispanic\nAdjusted\nRate\nHispanic\nCalifornia\nCI\nGeorgia\nCI\nMissis-\nsippi\nCI\nMissouri\nCI\nNew\nYork\nCI\nNorth\nCarolina\nCI\nSouth\nCarolina\nCI\nUtah\nCI\nWashing-\nton\nCI\nNote: P= Prison, G= General\nTable 1: Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000) for males aged\n18-54 in state prison and in the general population by race/ethnicity\nWildeman et al.: State-level variation in the imprisonment-mortality relationship, 2001-2010\n364 http://www.demographic-research.org\nThe mortality advantage of black male prisoners over black males in the general\npopulation is larger than the mortality advantage for white and Hispanic male inmates.\nBlack male prisoner's adjusted mortality rates are also lower in each state, although not\nsignificantly so in all states, than are the adjusted mortality rates of white and Hispanic\nmales in the general population.\nTable 2 shows SMRs for male prisoners relative to males in the population for the\ntotal population. Although there is variation in SMRs across states, the amount of\nvariation is small, with the state with the highest SMR (New York) coming in at 0.77,\nand the state with the lowest SMR (Mississippi) coming in at 0.48, suggesting a\nmortality advantage across all states. Because cross-state differences in mortality are\nmore substantial in the general population than in the inmate population, however,\ncross-state variation in the SMRs of prisoners may provide more insight regarding the\nmortality of the general population than that of the inmate population.\nTable 2: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRSs) of male state prisoners aged\nState\nTotal Non-Hispanic White Non-Hispanic Black Hispanic\nSMRs were lowest for black male prisoners, ranging from 0.16 in Washington to\n0.46 in New York state, and there was relatively little cross-state variability in SMRs\nfor this group. Interestingly, even the highest SMR for black males was lower than the\nlowest SMR for white males (0.50) and for Hispanic males (0.65). Hispanic male\nprisoners were also at a significant mortality advantage relative to Hispanic males in the\npopulation for both states we consider, and white male prisoners were at a significant\nmortality advantage in every state except South Carolina, where they had an SMR of\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 365\nwith a low of 0.50 in Utah and a high of 0.93 in South Carolina.\n3.2 The imprisonment-mortality relationship for females\nResults from Table 3 show that the crude mortality rate for female prisoners is\nsignificantly lower in six of the seven states considered, with only female prisoners in\nNew York having higher, albeit not significantly so, crude mortality rates than females\nin the general population.\nAdjusted mortality rates were also higher for females in the population in six\nstates, although the difference was only significant in three states (California, Georgia,\nand Missouri) because age-standardizing the mortality rates reduced the mortality gap\nin the other three states in which female prisoners had a mortality advantage in the\ncrude mortality rate (Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina). Female\nprisoners in New York died at a higher rate than females in the general population, but\nthis difference was not significant at the .05 level.\nConsistent with the results from Table 1, there is more cross-state variation in the\ncrude and adjusted mortality rates of females in the general population than females in\nstate prisons.\nTable 3 also indicates marked racial/ethnic variation in the imprisonment-mortality\nrelationship. The crude mortality rate for white female prisoners was significantly lower\nthan that of females in the population in five states. After adjusting for differences in\nthe age distribution, white female prisoners died at a significantly lower rate than\nfemales in the population in only three states. Black female prisoners, on the other\nhand, died at a lower rate than black females in the general population in every state,\nbut some of these differences, while substantial, were not statistically significant.\nInterestingly, Hispanic female prisoners in New York died at a higher rate than\nHispanic females in the population, and the mortality disadvantage of Hispanic female\nprisoners remained after adjusting for differences in age distribution. However, this\nfinding should be treated with some caution, because only 20 Hispanic female state\nprisoners died in New York between 2001 and 2010. We discuss this finding further in\nthe discussion section of this article.\nWildeman et al.: State-level variation in the imprisonment-mortality relationship, 2001-2010\n366 http://www.demographic-research.org\nState\nCrude Rate\nTotal\nAdjusted\nRate Total\nCrude Rate\nNon-Hispanic\nWhite\nAdjusted\nRate\nNon-Hispanic\nWhite\nCrude Rate\nNon-Hispanic\nBlack\nAdjusted\nRate\nNon-Hispanic\nBlack\nCrude Rate\nHispanic\nAdjusted\nRate Hispanic\nCalifornia\nCI\nGeorgia\nCI\nMissis-\nsippi\nCI\nMissouri\nCI\nNew York\nCI\nNorth\nCarolina\nCI\nSouth\nCarolina\nCI\nNote: P= Prison, G= General\nTable 3: Crude and ae-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000) for females aged\n18-54 in state prisons and in the general population by race/ethnicity\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 367\nTable 4: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of female state prisoners aged\nState\nTotal Non-Hispanic White Non-Hispanic Black Hispanic\nThe mortality disadvantage of Hispanic female prisoners in New York is made\nmore transparent in Table 4, which shows standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for\nfemale prisoners relative to females in the general population. Hispanic female\nprisoners in New York were the one group at a significant mortality disadvantage\nrelative to females in the general population in the same state [SMR = 3.32; 95% CI:\n4. Discussion\nThe results from our analysis provide support for four conclusions. First, although there\nis some cross-state variation in the crude and adjusted mortality rates of male and\nfemale prisoners, there is far more variation in the crude and adjusted mortality rates of\nmales and females in the general population. This suggests that cross-state differences\nin SMRs partially reflect differences in inmate mortality but mostly reflect underlying\ndifferences in mortality in the general population.\nSecond, the \"mortality advantage\" of female inmates was smaller than for male\ninmates, with female inmates often dying at roughly the same rate as females in the\npopulation. In order to better understand why this might be the case, it is worth\nconsidering the mechanisms leading to the lower mortality of prisoners. Much of this\nrelationship is due to the better - and constitutionally mandated - healthcare inmates\nreceive relative to similar individuals in the general population (e.g., Patterson 2010), as\nwell as the lower risks of death due to accidents, homicide, and overdose they face\nWildeman et al.: State-level variation in the imprisonment-mortality relationship, 2001-2010\n368 http://www.demographic-research.org\nwhile incarcerated (e.g., Spaulding et al. 2011). Some have also speculated that inmates\nmay have just been in better health than individuals in the general population prior to\nbeing incarcerated, but new evidence suggests that is highly unlikely to be the case\n(Bacak and Wildeman 2015). In light of existing research on the topic, the lower SMRs\nfor female inmates than male inmates could be partially explained by the fact that\nfemale inmates were in worse health upon prison entry relative to their peers in the\npopulation than male inmates were. Two-thirds of female prisoners reported a chronic\nmedical condition whereas about one-half of male prisoners did; female inmates also\nsuffer disproportionately from ailments ranging from arthritis and asthma to\nhypertension, kidney problems, and hepatitis (Maruschak 2008; Maruschak, Berzofsky,\nand Unangst 2015). Another possibility is that because females in the general\npopulation die at far lower rates of the causes of mortality that prisons most diminish\n(homicide, accidents, and overdose) than do males in the general population, female\nprisoners might simply have less to gain in terms of mortality reductions than do male\nprisoners, especially in the 18-54 age range that we considered here.\nThird, there was significantly less cross-state variation in the imprisonment-\nmortality association for blacks, with especially minimal variation across states in this\nrelationship for black males. Black male inmates also had the lowest SMRs of all six\ngroups we considered, although this appears to be driven primarily by very high\nmortality in the general population.\nFourth, there seems to be a distinctive imprisonment-mortality relationship for\nHispanic female state prisoners in New York, although given the small number of\nHispanic female inmates in New York were at a significant mortality disadvantage\npopulation of New York. Because of how intriguing this finding is and how small an N\nit is based on, additional tests for the robustness of this relationship are especially\nneeded since this finding would be quite provocative if it held up to further scrutiny.\nThis study nonetheless has some notable limitations. First, we were able to\nconsider the imprisonment-mortality relationship in only nine states for males and\nseven for females. Second, we were only able to consider the imprisonment-mortality\nrelationship for Hispanics in two states. Future research should provide a more\ncomprehensive portrait of the imprisonment-mortality relationship - especially for\nHispanics. Third, the number of Hispanic female prisoners who die, even in populous\nstates such as New York, is small enough that our results should be considered with\nreservations. Fourth, our analysis is descriptive, and hence, it is unclear whether any of\nthe relationships we uncovered are causal. Fifth, because our data are drawn from\nadministrative sources, we lack a self-reported measure of race/ethnicity. Finally, we\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 12\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 369\nconsidered only total mortality rates, and future research using these data might also\nconsider causes of death.\nLimitations aside, this article enhances our understanding of the relationship\nbetween imprisonment and mortality by providing insight into state-level variation in\nthis relationship for black, white, and Hispanic males and females. The results suggest\nthat although cross-state variation in mortality in the general population is greater than\nvariation in mortality in the penal population, there is nonetheless significant variation\nin mortality in the penal population, calling for further investigation of conditions of\nconfinement that might shape the mortality of inmates.\n5.
