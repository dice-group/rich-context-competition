Antibiotic\nresistance is increasingly problematic, and\njudicious use of antibiotics is essential to\nprevent the emergence of multidrug-resis-\ntant bacteria. Information regarding anti-\nmicrobial resistance patterns and\nmechanisms will assist in determining the\nbest antibiotic regimens for AECOPD\ntreatment.\nThe aim of the present study was to\nconduct an epidemiological survey on the\ndistribution, antimicrobial susceptibility\nand drug resistance genes of bacteria iso-\nlated from sputum samples of patients with\nAECOPD from hospitals in Beijing, China,\nto provide data that may contribute to\nrational treatment and management of\nAECOPD in this region.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective surveillance study recruited\npatients hospitalized with AECOPD\ngeneral hospitals in Beijing, China (Chinese\nHospital, Chinese PLA 307 Hospital,\nChinese PLA 309 Hospital, Chinese PLA\nNavy General Hospital, Chinese PLA Air\nForce General Hospital, Chinese PLA\nSecond Artillery General Hospital, Chinese\nPLA General Hospital, Beijing Shijitan\nHospital, Beijing Electric Power Hospital,\nBeijing Fengtai Hospital).\nDiagnosis of COPD was based on GOLD\nguidelines.6,13 AECOPD was considered if a\npatient with background COPD presented\nwith an acute change of symptoms in at least\none of dyspnoea, cough and sputum pro-\nduction.6,13 Exclusion criteria were: (i)\nradiographic evidence of pneumonia; (ii)\ndiagnosis of other pulmonary disease (e.g.\nbronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis,\nasthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, heart fail-\nure); (iii) exacerbation triggered by drugs,\nasbestos, sulphur dioxide or another toxic\ngas.

At least two eligible\nconsecutive samples were obtained from\neach participant. Sputum samples were\ninoculated onto blood agar plates, chocolate\nagar plates and Macconkey agar plates using\nstandard techniques, and incubated at 37C\nBacterial identification\nBacteria were identified via colony charac-\nteristics and biochemical reactions using\nstandard microbiological methods or the\nVITEK\u00d5 2 system (BioMe\n\u00b4 rieux, Marcy\nl'Etoile, France).18 Isolates of the same\nspecies from the same patient were con-\nsidered a single isolate. Nonpathogenic\nmicro-organisms including Neisseria,\nStreptococcus viridans, Corynebacterium\nand others were excluded from further\nanalyses.\nStreptococcus pneumoniae was identified\nvia urinary pneumococcal antigen test\n(BinaxNOW\u00d5 S. pneumoniae Antigen\nCard; Binax, Portland, ME, USA).\nSerodiagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae\nwas performed using Serodia\u00d5-Myco II\nparticle agglutination test (Fujirebio,\nTokyo, Japan), with titres !40 considered\npositive. Both tests were performed accord-\ning to the manufacturers' instructions.\nAntibiotic susceptibility\nAntibiotics used in drug susceptibility tests\nfor Gram-negative bacteria included ampi-\ncillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium,\npiperacillin/tazobactam, cefazolin, cefox-\nitin, ceftriaxone sodium, cefepime, aztreo-\nnam, ertapenem, imipenem, amikacin,\ngentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin,\nlevofloxacin, tigecycline, nitrofurantoin,\ncosulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), cefopera-\nzone and ceftazidime. Antibiotics used\nin drug susceptibility tests of the Gram-\npositive bacterium S. aureus included\npenicillin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifam-\npicin, clindamycin, TMP/SMZ, tigecycline,\nteicoplanin, vancomycin and linezolid.\nTests were performed using the disk-\ndiffusion method on Mueller\u00adHinton agar\nmedium, with plates incubated for 16\u00ad20 h\nat 35C in room air. The re-identification of\nall bacterial isolates and minimal inhibitory\nconcentration (MIC) determination were\nperformed at the Department of\nMicrobiology, Chinese PLA General\nHospital, Beijing, China. MIC values were\ndefined as sensitive (S), intermediate (I) or\nresistant (R), based on cut-off values defined\nby the Clinical and Laboratory Standards\ncontrol strains.\nAntibiotic resistant gene amplification\nThe four most frequently isolated Gram-\nnegative species were selected for polymer-\nase chain reaction (PCR) detection of anti-\nbiotic resistance genes. Genomic DNA was\nextracted from each individual isolate\n($5 \u00c2 106 cells per isolate) using a Blood\nand Cell Culture DNA Maxi kit (QIAGEN,\nVenlo, Netherlands) according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions, then stored at \u00c020C\nuntil use. The PCR reaction mix comprised\n10 ml 2 \u00c2 GoldStar Best MasterMix\n(CWBIO company, Beijing, China), 2 ml\neach primer (Table 2), 2 ml DNA template,\nand 6 ml double-distilled water. The cycling\nprogramme involved preliminary denatur-\nannealing (temperatures given in Table 2)\nfollowed by a final elongation step at 72C\nfor 5 min. PCR was performed at the\nPneumology Laboratory, Chinese PLA\nGeneral Hospital Beijing, China, and prod-\nucts were sequenced by Beijing AuGCT\ncompany, Beijing, China.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD or n (%).\nResults\nThe study enrolled 326 patients, eight of\nwhom were excluded (three refused to sign\ninformed consent forms; five had congestive\nheart failure).

Full details of all other anti-\nbiotic resistance genes are shown in Table 5.\nData regarding antibiotic susceptibility\nare shown in Table 6. K. pneumoniae had\n>50% susceptibility to all antibiotics tested,\nwith the exception of ampicillin and nitro-\nfurantoin. P. aeruginosa was sensitive to\ncefoperazone (61.9%) and amikacin\n(57.1%), with lower sensitivity to other\nantibiotics. A. baumannii was most sensitive\nto tigecycline (64.2%). Tigecycline and ami-\nkacin were the most effective antibiotics\nTable 3.

All S.\naureus isolates were sensitive to tigecycline,\nteicoplanin, vancomycin and linezolid, but\nresistant to penicillin and levofloxacin (data\nnot shown).\nDiscussion\nPathogenic bacteria were found in 34.3% of\npatients with AECOPD in the present study,\nbased on sputum culture. Others have\nreported infection rates of 37.4% in\nThe primary pathogenic bacteria detected in\nthe present study were K. pneumoniae\n(8.87%), indicating that Gram-negative bac-\nteria may be the predominant cause of\nAECOPD in Beijing. These findings are\nconsistent with those from Indonesia,\nMalaysia and Taiwan,11,23 but substantially\ndifferent from Hong Kong, South Korea\nand the Philippines,23 and Western coun-\ntries,10 where the microbiology of commu-\nnity-acquired pneumonia (H. influenzae,\nS. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis) was\nresponsible for AECOPD.\nRegional variation in bacterial flora\nhas several possible explanations.\nTable 4.

Secondly, the sever-\nity of AECOPD varied between studies.\nSevere AECOPD is associated with a low-\nered immune response as well as hospital-\nization, both of which benefit bacterial\ncolonization. COPD severity is an important\ndeterminant of micro-organism type,24 and\nenteric Gram-negative bacilli and P. aerugi-\nnosa may be more frequently isolated from\npatients with more severe expiratory airflow\nlimitation.25 The distribution of pathogenic\nbacteria in patients with a single AECOPD\nepisode has been shown to be different from\nthat in patients with two or more episodes,\nsuch that H. influenzae was associated with a\nsingle episode and Enterobacteriaceae spe-\ncies were only isolated from patients with\nseveral exacerbations.26 Finally, sputum\nculture and strain identification methods\nvaried between studies, and included quan-\ntitative, semiquantitative and qualitative\nculture, biochemical studies, PCR and auto-\nmatic microbial identification systems. It has\nbeen shown that the use of PCR to detect\nChlamydia pneumoniae in sputum samples\ncould overestimate its frequency.26\nThe four primary Gram-negative bacteria\nspecies detected in this study are opportun-\nistic pathogens, which always result in a long\nterm disease course in AECOPD.22 These\nbacteria were shown to have vastly different\nantibiotic resistance profiles. K. pneumoniae\nwas >50% susceptible to all antibiotics used\nTable 5.

Notably, the susceptibility of\nP. aeruginosa to imipenem was 23.8%,\nwhich is significantly lower than reported\nin China.27 A. baumannii is a major patho-\ngen in nosocomial infections, and its anti-\nbiotic resistance is an increasing problem.\nImipenem has been shown to be the most\npowerful antimicrobial agent against\nA. baumannii,27 but half of A. baumannii\nstrains were resistant to imipenem in the\npresent study, and tigecycline was most\neffective. We found that the most effective\nantibiotics against E. coli were amikacin,\ntigecycline and cefoperazone, followed by\ncefepime and imipenem, but others have\nreported 100% sensitivity to imipenem, fol-\nlowed by amikacin and ceftazidime.20 It is\nclear that pathogenic bacteria have different\nantibiotic sensitivity profiles in different\ncountries or regions, possibly as a result of\ndifferent drug-resistance mechanisms.\nTable 6. Antibiotic susceptibility of the four most commonly isolated Gram-negative bacteria from the\nsputum of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Beijing, China\nAntibiotic\nKlebsiella\npneumonia\nPseudomonas\naeruginosa\nAcinetobacter\nbaumannii\nEscherichia coli\nAmoxicillin/Clavulanate\nPotassium\nCosulfamethoxazole\nData presented as %.\nR, resistant; I, intermediate; S, sensitive; ESBLs, extended spectrum b-lactamases.\nAntibiotic susceptibility determined according to guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.19\nThere are several antibiotic resistance\nmechanisms in Gram-negative bacterium,\nincluding the presence of extended spectrum\nb-lactamases and antibiotic modifying\nenzymes, and the loss of porins.28 Based on\nthese mechanisms, we evaluated the pres-\nence 14 antibiotic resistant genes in four\nGram-negative bacteria strains, in order to\nexamine the relationship between drug\nresistance genes and antibiotic susceptibil-\nity. b-lactamase inhibitor resistant genes\nblaTEM1, blaSHV, blaDHA-1 and\nblaCTX-M-15 were detected in most\nA. baumannii and E. coli isolates, which\nwere resistant to first- and second-genera-\ntion cephalosporins and sensitive to some\nthird- and fourth-generation cephalo-\nsporins. It is possible that blaTEM1,\nblaSHV, blaDHA-1 and blaCTX-M-15\nmight be responsible for this resistance to\nfirst- and second-generation cephalosporins.\nConversely, although some P. aeruginosa\nisolates were positive for blaTEM1,\nblaSHV, blaDHA-1 and blaCTX-M-15,\nthey were also resistant to first- and\nsecond-generation cephalosporins, suggest-\ning the possible existence of alternative\nresistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa.\nThe outer membrane protein oprD regulates\nthe entry of carbapenems,29 and the absence\nof oprD was the most prevalent mechanism\nof resistance in P. aeruginosa in the present\nstudy. Although OprD was absent from the\nlargely imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa\nisolates in the current study, it was also not\npresent in imipenem-sensitive K. pneumo-\nniae, A. baumannii and E. coli isolates.\nSimilar results were found with oxa-10 and\noxa-2, which were detected in most imipe-\nnem-sensitive K. pneumoniae isolates, but\nnot in imipenem-sensitive A. baumannii and\nE. coli isolates. This finding suggests that\noxa-10 and oxa-2 are not responsible for\nimipenem resistance in K. pneumoniae.\nPlasmid-mediated qnr genes can facilitate\nbacterial spread and are mainly present in\nK. pneumoniae and E. coli.30 In the present\nstudy, 52.4% of K. pneumoniae isolates and\n75.0% of E. coli isolates were positive for\nqnrB. Interestingly, the aminoglycosides\nresistance genes, aac6'-lb-cr and aac(3)-II,\nwere detected in all four Gram-negative\nbacteria in the present study, but all isolates\nwere highly susceptibility to amikacin. It is\npossible that the amikacin resistance mech-\nanism in Beijing is not related to aac6'-lb-cr\nand aac(3)-II.\nThe present study had two main limita-\ntions. First, the majority of patients (229/\n318) did not complete lung-function tests\nduring the study period. It was therefore not\npossible to evaluate the relationship between\nthe severity of airway obstruction and the\ndistribution of pathogenic bacteria.\nSecondly, sensitive techniques such as PCR\nwere not used for the identification of bac-\nteria in sputum samples, some of which (e.g.\nM. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and\nLegionella) require special culture media\nand methods, and are therefore difficult to\nidentify. To our knowledge, this is the first\nmulticentre study of bacteriology in patients\nwith AECOPD performed in Beijing. The\nstrengths of our study were its prospective\nnature, with a relatively large sample size,\nand the inclusion of tests for antibiotic\nsusceptibility and drug-resistance genes.\nIn conclusion, we found that K. pneumo-\nniae and P. aeruginosa are the most common\npathogenic bacteria in AECOPD in Beijing.\nAmikacin and cefoperazone provide suffi-\ncient antibacterial activity against the four\nmain Gram-negative bacilli isolated from\nthese patients (K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa,\nA. baumannii and E. coli), but the multidrug\nresistance of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii\nwarrants attention. These findings may be\nhelpful in selecting antibiotic therapy for\nAECOPD in Beijing.\n"
