    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPURPOSE Whether patients with 1 or more chronic illnesses are more or less\nlikely to receive recommended preventive services is unclear and an important\npublic health and health care system issue. We addressed this issue in a large\nnational practice-based research network (PBRN) that maintains a longitudinal\ndatabase derived from electronic health records.\nMETHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study as of October 1, 2011, of the\nassociation between being up to date with 10 preventive services and the preva-\nolder in 148 member practices in a national PBRN. We used generalized linear\nmixed models to assess for the association of being up to date with each preven-\ntive service as a function of the patient's number of chronic conditions, adjusted\nfor patient age and encounter frequency.\nRESULTS Of the patients 65.4% had at least 1 of the 24 chronic illnesses. For 9\nof the 10 preventive services there were strong associations between the odds\nof being up to date and the presence of chronic illness, even after adjustment\nfor visit frequency and patient age. Odds ratios increased with the number of\nchronic conditions for 5 of the preventive services.\nCONCLUSIONS Rather than a barrier, the presence of chronic illness was posi-\ntively associated with receipt of recommended preventive services in this large\nnational PBRN. This finding supports the notion that modern primary care prac-\ntice can effectively deliver preventive services to the growing number of patients\nwith multiple chronic illnesses.\nINTRODUCTION\nIt has long been argued that competing demands in the primary care\nencounter are barriers to the effective delivery of clinical preventive\nservices.1 One estimate is that 7.4 hours of a primary care clinician's\nworkday would be needed to provide services recommended by the US\nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF),2 clearly impossible given com-\npeting demands for acute care, chronic care, and other responsibilities.\nAn alternative perspective is that encounters primarily for other rea-\nsons, particularly for chronic illnesses that entail frequent clinician con-\ntacts, would facilitate delivery of clinical preventive services. Research to\ndate on this issue has yielded inconsistent findings. A 1997 study showed\nthat patients with chronic illness were less likely to receive recommended\npreventive services,3 as did a more recent report focused only on patients\nwith diabetes mellitus.4 In contrast, other reports have shown posi-\ntive associations between chronic disease comorbidity and osteoporosis\nscreening,5 and between rheumatoid arthritis and dyslipidemia and osteo-\nporosis screening.6\nSteven M.

In this report, we analyze the\ncross-sectional association between receipt of 10 pre-\nventive services recommended by the USPSTF and\nactive patients aged 18 years or older in 148 practices\naffiliated with a national primary care practice-based\nresearch network (PBRN).\nMETHODS\nThe study was conducted in PPRNet, a PBRN founded\nstates. Unique among US PBRNs is the PPRNet data-\nbase, which is derived from the Practice Partner elec-\ntronic health record (EHR) (McKesson Corporation)\nused in each participating practice. The longitudinal\ndatabase contains anonymized demographic and clini-\ncal data and is updated quarterly through automated\ndata extracts.\nFor this report, we used the PPRNet database\nbegun to use Practice Partner on or after January 1,\n2010, were excluded from the analyses to better assure\nadequate time for recording of chronic illnesses and\ndelivery or recording of prior preventive services.\nPractices whose primary specialty was not family prac-\ntice or general internal medicine or those with fewer\nthan 100 active patients aged at least 18 years were\nalso excluded. Patients were defined as active in the\npractice if there was a progress note recorded in the\nDemographics, problems, diagnoses, procedures,\nvital signs, preventive services, laboratory results, and\nprogress note titles recorded in the EHR from active\npatients were included in the analyses. Data from\nproblem and diagnoses lists were used to assess the\nprevalence of the chronic conditions; all data elements\nwere used to assess receipt of preventive services.\nBecause the EHR allows free-text data entry, PPRNet\nuses computer algorithms for pattern matching and\nexpert review to assign International Classification of Dis-\neases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes\nto diagnoses, Logical Observation Identifiers Names\nand Codes (LOINC) for laboratory data, and an inter-\nnal dictionary for other data elements. From audits\nconducted in the early phases of these analyses for the\nchronic conditions included in this report, we have\ndetermined that, compared with review by a clinician,\nour approach has at least 99% sensitivity and 99%\nspecificity for identification of these diagnoses.\nThe preventive services studied are all grade A or\nB screening recommendations of the USPSTF: screen-\ning for high blood pressure, lipid disorders, cervical\ncancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, urogenital\nchlamydial infection, type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults\nwith elevated blood pressure, alcohol misuse, depres-\nsion, and osteoporosis.8 The 24 chronic conditions\nstudied represent a broad spectrum of illnesses relevant\nto primary care practice and are conditions of priority\nfor comparative effectiveness research.9,10\nThe proportion of patients up to date with a given\npreventive service was calculated by dividing the num-\nber of patients who had received the service in the rec-\nommended interval by the number of patients eligible\nfor the service. The prevalence for each chronic condi-\ntion studied was calculated by dividing the number of\npatients with the condition by the number of active\npatients. The total number of chronic conditions (of\nthe 24 studied) was also determined for each patient.\nEncounter frequency was defined for each patient as\nthe number of progress notes between October 1,\nFor each preventive service, we first calculated the\nunadjusted percentages of eligible patients who were\nchronic illnesses. We then used generalized linear\nmixed models (GLMMs)11 to model the up-to-date sta-\ntus with the preventive service (yes/no) as a function\nof the patient's number of chronic conditions, treating\nnumber of chronic conditions as a categorical variable\nporated logit link functions and accounted for cluster-\ning of patients within practices by means of random\npractice effects with compound symmetry error struc-\ntures. In essence, the GLMMs served as hierarchical\nlogistic regression models. Models for each preventive\nservice were constructed with covariate adjustment for\npatient age and encounter frequency. Adjusted odds\nratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed\nand reported.\nRESULTS\nOne hundred seventy-two practices provided data as\nof October 1, 2011.

Almost all eligible patients had a blood pressure\nrecorded in their EHR. Three-quarters were up to date\nwith glucose screening for elevated blood pressure and\nwith cholesterol screening. About one-half of eligible\npatients were current with mammography screening\nand bone mineral density screening, and just over two-\nfifths with any form of colorectal cancer screening\nor Papanicolaou smears for cervical cancer screening.\nOnly 1 in 5 had recorded screening for depression or\nat-risk drinking, and 1 in 6 for screening for urogenital\nchlamydial infection.\nThe unadjusted associations between being up\nto date with each preventive service and the number\nof chronic conditions are depicted in Figure 1. For\neach preventive service, there is a curvilinear relation-\nship with the number of chronic conditions, with an\nincreased likelihood of being up to date with a pre-\nventive service as the number of chronic conditions\nincreases from 0 to 4 or 5. At that\npoint, for the most part, the asso-\nciation plateaus, and there are no\nfurther increases in the proportion\nof patients up to date with the pre-\nventive service as the number of\nchronic conditions increases above\n5. Blood pressure measurement\nis an exception to the pattern; it\nseems to plateau once there is at\nleast 1 chronic condition.\nTable 3 shows the association\nbetween being up to date with\neach of the preventive services\nand the number of chronic con-\nditions, adjusted for patient age\nand encounter frequency. For\neach preventive service other\nthan screening for urogenital\nchlamydia, there are strong asso-\nciations between the odds of being up to date and the\npresence of chronic illness, even after adjustment for\nvisit frequency and patient age.

These associations\npersisted regardless of the number of chronic illnesses.\nThis finding is in contrast to oft-expressed concerns\nthat increasing patient complexity (defined as having\nmore than 1 chronic illness) impedes the delivery of\npreventive services because of competing demands.1\nOur findings persisted even after adjustment for age\nand encounter frequency, suggesting that it is some-\nthing in the nature of the care provided to these\npatients that accounted for the finding of increased\nattention to prevention.\nThe explanation for our findings is unclear. Most\nPPRNet practices have attended PPRNet meetings\nand/or participated in PPRNet quality improvement\nresearch projects that emphasize the importance of evi-\ndence-based care, team care, and use of EHR decision\nsupport, such as preventive services reminders. PPRNet\nalso provides quarterly clinical quality reports to mem-\nber practices, which include practice-, provider-, and\npatient-level data on the preventive services studied, as\nwell as other quality indicators for acute and chronic ill-\nness care. It could be that practices, using these reports\nas chronic illness registries, may have attended to pre-\nventive services in addition to the chronic illness when\nconducting outreach efforts to patients. Such outreach\nefforts might not be directed to patients without\nchronic illness. It could also be that care management\nactivities inherent in encounters for chronic illness care,\nsuch as ordering tests and arranging follow-up, provide\nthe context for provision of preventive services. Indeed,\na direct observation study of primary care clinicians\nfound that preventive services were delivered during\nThere are several potential limitations of our\nreport. One is confounding by condition. For example,\nthat the odds ratios for cholesterol and blood glucose\nmeasurement increased with the number of chronic\nconditions could be confounded by several of the most\ncommon chronic conditions, such as diabetes mel-\nlitus and hyperlipidemia, being themselves indications\nfor these services. A subanalysis excluding the 79,641\npatients with diabetes mellitus, however, did not alter\nthe strong positive association between blood glucose\nmeasurement for elevated blood pressure and the\npatients with hyperlipidemia attenuated but did not\neliminate the association between screening for total\nand high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and patient\ncomplexity. That the odds of screening for depres-\nsion, colorectal cancer, and bone mineral density also\nincreased with the number of chronic conditions miti-\ngates the possibility of confounding being responsible\nfor most of the observed associations.\nAs in any secondary analysis, we could not inde-\npendently validate our data sources, the diagnoses,\nand preventive services data in the EHRs of patients in\nthe participating practices. A specific concern relevant\nto this limitation is the possibility of information bias,\nwhich might be present if practices or members of\npractices were both more diligent in recording chronic\nillnesses and receipt of a preventive service. It is\nunlikely that this potential bias was responsible for our\nstudy findings for 2 major reasons. First, the observed\nassociations were strong, which would not have\noccurred unless most of the practices were affected\nby information bias, an unlikely occurrence. Second,\nthe observed associations were present for 9 of the 10\npreventive services, most of which are documented\nin ways other than direct entry, including automated\ndownloading of laboratory and procedure results.\nA final limitation is that, despite the relatively large,\ngeographically diverse, sample of practices and clini-\ncians included in this study, all were users of a single\nEHR and voluntary members of a PBRN. The extent\nto which the findings from this group of practices can\nbe generalized across all primary care settings in the\nUnited States and other countries with similar health\ncare systems is unknown.Despite these limitations, we\nbelieve that our findings support the notion that modern\nprimary care practices, facilitated by tools like EHRs\nand joined in learning networks such as PBRNs, can\novercome competing demands and effectively deliver\npreventive services to the growing number of patients\nwith multiple chronic illnesses.13 Epidemiologic studies\nsuggest that principles of the patient-centered medical\nhome facilitate preventive services delivery.14,15 Empiri-\ncal evidence points to the positive impact on preventive\nservices delivery of EHR-based reminders and standing\norders for nonclinician staff,16 as well as multicomponent\ninterventions using audit and feedback, academic detail-\ning, and practice facilitation.16,17 Whether these strate-\ngies have a similar impact among patients with multiple\nchronic illnesses is a subject for future research.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\n",
